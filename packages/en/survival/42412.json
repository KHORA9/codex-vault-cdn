LXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL AGRICULTURE.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three reasons why the second edition of a good book, upon an\r\nadvancing branch of knowledge, should be better than the first. The\r\nauthor, however conversant he may have been with the subject when he\r\nwrote his book, is always more thoroughly read in it--supposing him a\r\nworthy instructor of the public--his opinions more carefully digested,\r\nand more fully matured, when a second edition is called for. Then he\r\nhas had time to reconsider, and, if necessary, remodel his\r\nplan--adding here, retrenching there--introducing new subject-matter\r\nin one place, and leaving out, in another, topics which he had\r\npreviously treated of with more or less detail. And, lastly, the\r\nknowledge itself has advanced. New ideas, which in the interval have\r\nestablished themselves, find a necessary place in the new issue; facts\r\nand hypotheses which have been proved unsound drop naturally out of\r\nhis pages; and, on the whole, the later work exhibits a nearer\r\napproach to that truthful summit, on which the eyes of all the\r\nadvancers of knowledge are supposed evermore to rest.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, the second edition of the _Book of the Farm_ is\r\nbetter than the first. The opinions of the author have been\r\nreconsidered and materially improved--especially in reference to\r\nscientific points; the arrangement has been simplified, and the whole\r\nbook condensed, by the exclusion of those descriptions of machinery\r\nwhich properly belong to the department of agricultural mechanics, and\r\nwhich we believe are about to be published as a separate work; and the\r\nstrides which practical agriculture has taken during the last ten\r\nyears, and the topics which have chiefly arrested attention, are\r\nconsidered with the aid of the better lights we now possess.\r\n\r\nOf all the arts of life, there is none which draws its knowledge from\r\nso great a variety of fountains as practical agriculture. Every branch\r\nof human knowledge is mutually connected--we may say interwoven\r\nwith--and throws light upon, or is enlightened by, every other. But\r\nnone of those which largely contribute to the maintenance of social\r\nlife, and conduce to the power and stability of states, is so varied\r\nin its demands upon the results of intellectual inquiry, as\r\nhusbandry,--or rural economy in its largest sense.\r\n\r\nLook at that magnificent ship, which cleaves the waters, now trusting\r\nto her canvass and wafted by favouring breezes; now, despite the\r\nfiercest gales, paddling her triumphant way over hill and valley,\r\nprecipice and ravine, which the raging sea, out of her fertile\r\nmaterials, is every moment fashioning beneath her feet. Is there any\r\nproduct of human art in which more intellect is embodied than in this\r\npiece of living mechanism? The timber can tell of the axe of the\r\nwoodman on far-distant hills, and of the toils of many craftsmen in\r\nfitting it for its present purpose. The iron of the researches of the\r\nmineralogist, the laborious skill of the miner, the alchemy of the\r\nsmelter, the wonders of the tilt-hammer, the ingenuity of the\r\nmechanist, and the almost inconceivable and mathematical nicety by\r\nwhich its various portions are fitted to each other, and, like the\r\nmuscles and sinews of the human body, made to play together for a\r\npurpose previously contemplated--an uninstructed man might almost say,\r\npreviously agreed upon among themselves. The steam, of what hidden\r\nsecrets of nature!--the mysteries of heat, which could not hide\r\nthemselves from the searching genius of Black,--the chemistry of\r\nwater, which the ever-pondering mind of Watt compelled from unwilling\r\nnature,--the endless contrivances by which its fierce power was tamed\r\nto most submissive obedience in the workshops of Soho. The compass may\r\nfor a moment carry us back to the fabled mountains of our infancy, in\r\nwhich the hidden loadstone attracted the fated vessel to its ruin; but\r\nit brings us forward again to the truer marvels of modern magnetism,\r\nand to the intellect which has been expended in keeping the needle\r\ntrue to the pole-star in the iron boat, where, surrounded by metallic\r\ninfluences, countless attractions are incessantly soliciting it to\r\ndeviate. And when, as the mid-day sun mounts to the zenith, the\r\nsextant and the quicksilver appear, how does it flash upon us that\r\nmodern navigation is the child of astronomy; and that the mind\r\nembodied in the latest Rossian telescope is part and parcel of the\r\ninappreciable mass of thought to which, \"walking the waters as a thing\r\nof life,\" that huge steam-frigate owes its being!\r\n\r\nWhat a concentration of varied knowledge is seen in this single work\r\nof art! From how many sources has this knowledge come!--how many\r\ndiverse pursuits or sciences have yielded their necessary quota to the\r\ncommon stock!--how many varied talents have been put under\r\ncontribution to contrive its many parts, and put them fittingly\r\ntogether!\r\n\r\nBut, to the pursuits of the humble farmer, more aids still contribute\r\nthan to those of the dauntless navigator. His patient and quiet life\r\non land is as dependent upon varied knowledge, draws its instruction\r\nfrom as many sources, and is more bound up in visible union with all\r\nthe branches of human science, than even the active and stirring life\r\nof the dweller on the sea.\r\n\r\nSome of our journal writers are accustomed to ridicule the results of\r\nagricultural skill; to undervalue our successful field improvements;\r\nto laugh at Smithfield Christmas cattle, and at the exhibitions of our\r\ngreat annual shows. In thoughtlessness, often in ignorance, they\r\nwrite, and always for a temporary effect, which our progressing\r\nagriculture can well afford to pass by.\r\n\r\nBut we ask our rural reader to turn up the first volume of the _Book\r\nof the Farm_, and to cast his eye for a moment on the triad of\r\nbeautiful shorthorns represented in the sixth plate; or on the\r\nmagnificent stallion of the fourth plate, or on the graceful sheep of\r\nthe seventh. We pass over the _points_ in which, to the educated eye,\r\ntheir beauty consists; we dismiss, for the present, all consideration\r\nof their perfection as well-bred animals, and their fitness for the\r\nspecial purposes for which they have been reared. We wish him to tell\r\nus, if he can, how much mind has gone to the breeding, rearing, and\r\nfeeding of these animals--how many varied branches of knowledge have\r\nlent their aid to this apparently simple and un-imposing result.\r\n\r\nThe food on which they have been brought up has been gathered from the\r\nsoil--the grass, the hay, the root crops, the linseed, the barley, the\r\noats. And how much intellect, from the earliest dawn of civilisation,\r\nhas been lavished upon the soil!--how many branches of knowledge are\r\nat this moment uniting their strength to develop its latent\r\ncapabilities! Geology yields the raw materials upon which, in after\r\nages, the toils of the husbandman are expended. She explains what are\r\nthe variations in the natural quality of these materials; how such\r\nvariations have arisen; where they lead to increased, and where to\r\ndiminished fertility; how and where the still living rocks may\r\ncontribute to the improvement of the dead earth which has been formed\r\nfrom them; and how, in some apparently insecure regions, the\r\nunsleeping volcano showers over the land, at varying periods, the\r\nelements of an endless fertility. Mineralogy lends her aid to unravel\r\nthe origin, and nature, and wants, and capabilities of the soil; and,\r\nas the handmaid and willing follower of geology, dresses and classes\r\nthe fragments which geology has let fall from her magnificent\r\nformations. But chemistry, especially, exhausts herself in the cause\r\nof the husbandman. No branch of rural art, as we shall see, is beyond\r\nher province and control. All that the soil originally derives from\r\ngeologic and mineral materials, chemistry investigates; all that these\r\nsubstances naturally become, all that they ought to yield, how they\r\nmay be persuaded to yield it; by what changes this is to be brought\r\nabout; by means of what agencies, and how applied, such changes are to\r\nbe induced:--chemistry busies herself with all this, and labours in\r\nsome sense to complete, for the purposes of rural art, the information\r\nwhich geology and mineralogy had begun.\r\n\r\nUpon the soil the plant grows. What a wonder and a mystery is the\r\nplant! A living, and growing, and breathing existence, that speaks\r\nsilently to the eye, and to the sense of touch, and to the sense of\r\nsmell--speaks kindly to man, and soothingly, and appeals to his\r\nreasoning powers--but is mute to the most open and wakeful of all his\r\nsenses, and by no verbal speech reveals the secrets with which its\r\nfull vessels are bursting. How many wise heads have watched, and\r\ntended, and studied it--the humble plant--interpreting its smallest\r\nmovements, the meaning of every change of hue upon its leaves and\r\nflowers, and gathering profoundest wisdom from its fixed and voiceless\r\nlife! To what new sciences has this study led the way! Botany never\r\nwearies in gathering and classifying; and of modern giants, Linnæus,\r\nand Jussieu, and Decandolle, and Brown, and Lindley, and Hooker, and\r\nSchleiden, have given their best years to unfold and perfect it.\r\nAlongside of descriptive and systematic botany has sprung up the\r\nallied branch of Structural Physiology, and the use of the microscope\r\nhas added to this the younger sister Histology; while these two\r\ntogether, calling in the aid of chemistry, have built up the further\r\ndepartments of Chemical Physiology and Chemical Histology--departments\r\ntoo numerous, too profound in their research, and too special in their\r\nseveral niceties of observation, for one head clearly to comprehend\r\nand limit them.\r\n\r\nAnd on the plant as it grows, and as a perfect whole, chemistry\r\nexpends entire and most gifted intellectual lives. Of what the plant\r\nconsists, whence it draws its subsistence, how it takes it in--in what\r\nform, in what quantity, at what period of the day--how the air feeds\r\nit, how the soil sustains it, why it grows well here and badly\r\nthere--what are the nature, composition, action, and special\r\ninfluences of manures--where and when, and of what kind, they should\r\nbe applied to the plant--how this or that effect is to be produced by\r\nthem, and this or that defect remedied.\r\n\r\nBut the life of the plant is an unravelled thread. The steam-frigate\r\nappears to live, and thunders as she moves, breathing fire and smoke.\r\nBut the still life of the plant awes and subdues more than all this.\r\nMan may forcibly obstruct the path of the growing twig, but it turns\r\nquietly aside and moves patiently on. The dead iron and wood, and the\r\nforceful steam, all obey man's will--his intellect overmasters their\r\nstubbornness, and tames them into crouching slaves--but the life of\r\nthe plant defies him. That life he can extinguish; but to use the\r\nliving plant he must obey it, and study its wants and tendencies. How\r\nvastly easier to achieve a boastful triumph over the most stubborn\r\nmineral matter, than to mould to man's will the humblest flower that\r\ngrows!\r\n\r\nAnd each new plant brings with it new conditions of life, new wants,\r\nnew virtues, new uses, new whims, if we may so speak, to be humoured.\r\nThe iron, and the timber, and the brass are always one and the same to\r\nthe mechanist; but with the constitution of each new plant, and its\r\nhabits, a new series of difficulties opens up to the cultivator, which\r\nonly time and experience, and much study, can overcome.\r\n\r\nBut mechanics also exert much influence upon the culture of the soil,\r\nand the rearing of useful plants. And though the greatest achievements\r\nof mechanical skill were not first made on her behalf, yet even the\r\nsteam-engine may be said to have become auxiliary to agriculture; and\r\nthe thousand ingenious implements which Northampton and York exhibited\r\nat their recent anniversaries, showed in how many quarters, and to how\r\nlarge an extent, the purely mechanical and constructive arts are\r\nexpending their strength in promoting her cause.\r\n\r\nOn meteorology, which studies the aërial meteors--registers,\r\ntabulates, and gives even a local habitation and a form to winds,\r\nhurricanes, and typhoons--the progress of the navigator much depends.\r\nThey hinder or hasten his progress; but he overcomes them at last. But\r\natmospheric changes are vital things to the plant and to the soil.\r\nWhere no rain falls, the plant withers and dies. If too much falls, it\r\nbecomes sickly, and fails to yield a profitable crop. If it falls too\r\nfrequently, though not in too large quantity on the whole, one plant\r\nluxuriates and rejoices in the genial season, while another with\r\ndifficulty produces a half return. If it falls at unseasonable times,\r\nthe seed is denied admission into the ground in spring, or the harvest\r\nrefuses to ripen in the autumn.\r\n\r\nSo the warmth and the sunshine, and the evening dews and the fogs, and\r\nthe electric condition of the air--its transparency and its varying\r\nweight--and prevailing winds and hoar-frosts, and blights and\r\nhail-storms, and the influence of the heavenly bodies on all these\r\nconditions--with all these things the interests of the plant and the\r\nsoil demand that scientific agriculture should occupy herself. On\r\nevery single branch of knowledge to which we have alluded, the power\r\nand skill profitably to influence the plant are dependent.\r\n\r\nAnd for what purpose does the plant spring up, the soil feed and\r\nnourish it, and the blessed sun mature its seeds? To adorn, no doubt,\r\nthe surface of the beautiful earth, and to keep alive and propagate\r\nits species; but principally to nourish the animal races which supply\r\nfood and yield their service to man. And, upon the study of this\r\nnurture and feeding of the animal races, how much intellect has been\r\nexpended! Has the stoker who heaps coals upon the engine fire, and\r\nturns one tap occasionally to maintain the water-level in the boiler,\r\nor another to give passage to the steam--and thus keeps the\r\npile-driver, or the coal-drawer, or the tin mine, or the locomotive,\r\nor the steam-boat, or the colossal pumps of the Haarlem lake, in easy\r\nand continuous operation--has he, or has the man who curiously watches\r\nhis operations--have either of them any idea of the long days of\r\nintellectual toil--of the sleepless nights, during which invention was\r\non the rack--of the mental dejection and throes of suffering, under\r\nwhich new thoughts were born--of the lives of martyred devotion which\r\nhave been sacrificed, while, or in order that the machine, which is so\r\nobediently simple and easily managed, was or might be brought to its\r\npresent perfection? Yet all this has been, and has been suffered by\r\nmen now gone, though the ignorance of the humble workman, little more\r\nthoughtful than the iron he works with, fails either to feel or to\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nAnd so too often it is with you who feed, and with you who look at the\r\nsimple process of feeding stock. As the turnip and the barley, and the\r\noats and the linseed, and the beans, are placed before the almost\r\nperfect short-horn, or the graceful Ayrshire, or the untamed West\r\nHighlander, or the stately stallion, or the well-bred Leicester or\r\nCheviot ram, or the cushioned and padded Berkshire porker--how little\r\ndo you know or think of the science, and long skill, and intellectual\r\nlabour, which have been expended in preparing what is to you so\r\nsimple! It is not without and beyond the ranks of the agricultural\r\ncommunity only that we need look for those who lessen the intellectual\r\ncharacter of rural industry, and of the rural life. Too many of our\r\npractical men, even of high pretensions, are themselves only the\r\nstokers of the agricultural machine; and, like ungrateful and\r\ndegenerate children, in their ignorance deny the head of the mother\r\nthat bred and fed them.[2]\r\n\r\nWhat are the functions of the animals you rear--what the composition\r\nof their several parts--what the nature of the food they require--what\r\nthe purposes it serves--what the proportions in which this or that\r\nkind of food ought to be given--what the changes, in the kind and\r\nproportion, to adapt it to the special habits and constitution of the\r\nanimal, and the purposes for which it is fed? Are these questions\r\ndeep? Yet they have all been thought over and long considered, and\r\ndiscussed and disputed about, and volumes have been written upon them;\r\nand the chemist, and the physiologist, and the anatomist have, unknown\r\nto you, all laboured zealously and without wearying, in your service.\r\nAnd what you now find so simple only proves how much their sciences\r\nhave done for you. _They_ have fitted the machinery together, _you_\r\nbut throw in the fuel and keep up the steam.\r\n\r\nWith the rearing of stock, and the improving of breeds, practical men\r\nare, or fancy themselves, all more or less conversant. How much warm\r\nand persevering genius, guided by purely scientific principles, has\r\nbeen expended upon our improved shorthorns and Leicesters! Are the\r\nwhole lives of a Collins, or a Bakewell, or a Bates, nothing to have\r\nbeen devoted to pursuits like this? That these were practical men, and\r\nnot scientific, and that what they have done is not a debt due by\r\nagriculture to science, is the saying of many. Men who have never read\r\na book can do, by imitation, what the patient services and skill of\r\nother men discovered, and perfected, and simplified. But in this they\r\nare only stokers. The improvers were sound and cautious experimental\r\nphysiologists, guided by the most fixed and certain principles of\r\nanimal physiology; and it is the results at which these men arrived\r\nthat have become the household words of the stokers of our day, who\r\ncall them _practice_ in opposition to _science_. If science could\r\nforget her high duties to the Deity, and to the human race, she might\r\nleave you and your art to your own devices.\r\n\r\nNeed we allude to the conditions of animal life--in a state of health,\r\nand in a state of disease; to the varied constitutions of different\r\nraces and varieties; to the several adaptations of food, warmth, and\r\nshelter which these demand; and to the extensive course of study which\r\nis now required to furnish the necessary resources to the accomplished\r\nveterinary surgeon? Yet would any breeder be safe for a moment to\r\ninvest his money in stock, in a country and climate like ours, had he\r\nnot, either in books, or in his own head, or in that of a neighbouring\r\nveterinarian, the results at which the long study of these branches of\r\nknowledge, in connexion with animal health, had discovered and\r\nestablished?\r\n\r\nWe pursue this topic no further at present. We fearlessly assert--we\r\nbelieve that we have shown--that as much intellect has been\r\nscientifically expended in elucidating and perfecting the various\r\noperations of rural life, by which those magnificent cattle have been\r\nproduced by art, as has gone to the elaboration of that wonderful\r\nwave-subduing ship. The vulgar mind, awed by bulk and sound, and\r\nvisible emblems of thought, may dissent--may say that we have not so\r\nmuch to show for it. But the laws of life are sought for and\r\nstudied--they are not made by science. The Deity has forbidden human\r\nskill to develop a sheep into an elephant. Living materials, as we\r\nhave said, are not plastic like wood and iron; and to change the\r\nconstitution and character of a breed of animals may require as great\r\nand as long-continued an exercise of inventive thought as to perfect\r\nan imposing piece of machinery. The real worth of a scientific result\r\nis the amount of mind expended in arriving at it, as the real height\r\nof an animal in the scale of organisation is measured by the\r\nproportionate size of its brain.\r\n\r\nBut we have our more palpable and sense-satisfying triumphs too. Look\r\nat that wide valley, with its snow-clad summits at a distance on\r\neither hand, and its glassy river flowing, cribbed and confined, in\r\nthe lowest bottom. Smiling fields, and well-trimmed hedge-rows, and\r\nsheltering plantations, and comfortable dwellings, and a busy\r\npopulation, and abundant cattle, cover its undulating slopes. For\r\nmiles industrious plenty spreads over a country which the river\r\nformerly usurped, and the lake covered, and the rush tufted over, and\r\nbog and mossy heath and perennial fogs and drizzling rains rendered\r\ninhospitable and chill. But mechanics has chained the river, and\r\ndrained the lakes, and bogs, and clayey bottoms; and giving thus scope\r\nto the application of all the varied practical rules to which science\r\nhas led, the natural climate has been subdued, disease extirpated, and\r\nrich and fertile and happy homes scattered over the ancient waste.\r\n\r\nTurn to another country, and a river flows deeply through an arid and\r\ndesolate plain. Mechanics lifts its waters from their depths, and from\r\na thousand artificial channels directs them over the parched surface.\r\nIt is as if an enchanter's wand had been stretched over it--the green\r\nherbage and the waving corn, companied by all the industries of rural\r\nlife, spring up as they advance.\r\n\r\nAnother country, and a green oasis presents itself, busy with life, in\r\nthe midst of a desert and sandy plain. Do natural springs here gush\r\nup, as in the ancient oasis of the Libyan wilderness? It is another of\r\nthe triumphs of human industry, guided by human thought. Geology, and\r\nher sister sciences, are here the pioneers of rural life and fixed\r\nhabitations. The seat of hidden waters at vast depths was discovered\r\nby her. Under her directions mechanics has bored to their sources, and\r\ntheir gushing abundance now spreads fertility around.\r\n\r\nSuch are more sensible and larger triumphs of progressing rural\r\neconomy--such as man may well boast of, not only in themselves, but in\r\ntheir consequences; and they may take their place with the gigantic\r\nvessel of war, as magnificent results of intellectual effort.\r\n\r\nBut it is after these first ruder though more imposing conquests over\r\nnature have been made, that the demand for mind, for applied science,\r\nbecomes more frequent, and the results of its application less\r\nperceptible. And it is because, in ordinary husbandry, we have not\r\nalways before us the striking illustrations which arrest the vulgar\r\neye, that prevailing ignorance persists in denying its obligations to\r\nscientific research.\r\n\r\nThe waters which descend from a chain of hills become a striking\r\nfeature in the geography of a country, when they happen to unite\r\ntogether into a large and magnificent river: they escape unseen and\r\nunnoticed if, keeping apart, they flow in countless tiny streamlets to\r\nthe sea. Yet, thus disunited, they may carry fertility over a whole\r\nregion, like the Nile when it overflows its banks, or as the river of\r\nDamascus straying among its many gardens; while the waters of the\r\ngreat river may only refresh and fertilise its own narrow margins, as\r\nthe Murray and the Darling do in South Australia, or the deep-bedded\r\nrivers of Southern Africa.\r\n\r\nThus much we have devoted to the introductory portion of the _Book of\r\nthe Farm_. Those of our readers who wish to follow up farther these\r\nscientific views may study _Johnston's Lectures, and Elements, of\r\nAgricultural Chemistry and Geology_: and by the way we would commend,\r\nfor applied science, these works of Johnston's, and for practical\r\nknowledge, the book of Stephens, to the special attention of our\r\nemigrating fellow-countrymen, of whom so many in their foreign homes\r\nare likely to regret the overflowing sources of information on every\r\nconceivable topic with which their home literature and home neighbours\r\nsupplied them.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a look at the body of Mr Stephens' work. These are the\r\ndays of pictorial embellishment--of speaking directly, and plainly,\r\nand palpably to the eye. We have accidentally opened the book at the\r\n217th page. What letterpress description could--so briefly we do not\r\nsay, for that is out of the question--but so graphically and fully,\r\nexplain the practice of eating off turnips with sheep, and all its\r\nappliances of hurdles and nets, and turnip shears, and feeding\r\ntroughs, and hay racks, as the single woodcut which this page\r\nexhibits? And so the practice of bratting and of stelling sheep is\r\nillustrated, and all the forms and fashions of stells in high and low\r\ncountries (pp. 231 to 236;) the pulling, dressing, and storing of\r\nturnips, (190 to 195;) the various modes of ploughing, with their ups\r\nand downs, and turnings, and crossings, and gatherings, and feerings,\r\nand gore furrows, and mould furrows, and broad furrows, and cross\r\nfurrows, and samcastings, and gaws, and ribs, and rafters, and slices,\r\nand crowns, and centres, and a host of other operations and things\r\nfamiliar to the farmer, but the very names and designations of which\r\nare Greek to the common English reader. All these the woodcuts explain\r\nbeautifully and familiarly to the uninitiated readers, and most\r\nusefully to the incipient farmer. How is the rural economy of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, in its best forms, stored up, not only for modern\r\nand immediate use, but for the understanding of future ages, by these\r\nillustrations! We would specify, in addition to those already referred\r\nto, the steam-boiling apparatus in page 320; and the taking down of a\r\nstack of corn in page 401; and the feeding of the threshing machine in\r\npage 406; and the hand-sowing of corn in page 553; and the pickling of\r\nwheat, (_chaulage_ of our Gallic neighbours,) page 536; and the\r\nmeasuring of the grain in the barn, &c., page 419; and the full sacks,\r\n_as they should be_, in the barn, in page 423. To the foreigner, how\r\ndo these pictures speak of English customs, costumes, and usages; to\r\nour Trans-atlantic brethren, of the source of those modes and manners\r\nwhich have at once placed them on an elevation in agricultural art, to\r\nwhich 800 years of intellectual struggle had barely sufficed to lift\r\nup their fathers and cousins at home; and to the still British\r\ncolonial emigrant the precise practices, and latest rural\r\nimprovements, which it will be his interest, at once, and his pride,\r\nto introduce into his adopted land!\r\n\r\nHow would the _Scriptores Rei Rusticæ_ have gained in usefulness in\r\ntheir own time, how immensely in interest in ours, had they been\r\naccompanied by such illustrations as these! The clearness of Columella\r\nwould have been made more transparent, the obscurity of Palladius\r\nlessened; and Cato and Varro would have preserved to us the actual\r\nliving forms, and costumes, and instruments of the ancient Etruscan\r\ntimes, more clearly than the painted tombs are now revealing to the\r\nantiquarian the fashions of their feasts, and games, and funereal\r\nrites. We have before us the singularly, richly, and extravagantly,\r\nyet graphically and most instructively illustrated book of Georgius\r\nAgricola, _De Re Metallica_ (Basil, 1621.) The woodcuts of the _Book\r\nof the Farm_ have induced us to turn it up, and it is with ever new\r\nadmiration that we turn over its old leaves. It has to us the interest\r\nof a child's picture-book; and though, as a _chef-d'oeuvre_ of\r\nillustrative art, the three hundred woodcuts of Stephens do not\r\napproach the book of Agricola, yet what a treasure would the work of\r\nAusonius Popma on the rural implements of the ancients--their\r\n_instrumenta_ in its widest sense--have been to us, could it have been\r\nillustrated when he wrote (1690) in the style of Agricola, and with\r\nthe minuteness and fulness of Stephens!\r\n\r\nThe same desire to render minutely intelligible the whole subject\r\ntreated of, which these woodcuts show, is manifested in the more solid\r\nletterpress of the book. It was said of Columella, by Matthew Gessner,\r\nthat he discoursed \"non ut argumentum simplex quod discere amat,\r\ndicendo obscuret, sed ut clarissimâ luce perfundat omnia.\" Such, the\r\nreader feels, must have been the aim of the author of this book. In\r\nhis descriptions, nothing appears to be omitted; nothing is too minute\r\nto be passed over. His book exposes not merely the every-day life, but\r\nthe very inmost life--the habits, and usages, and instruments of the\r\nmost humble as well as the most important of the operations of the\r\ndomestic, equally with the field economy of rural life. We do not\r\nknow if its effects upon our town population will ever be such as Beza\r\nascribes to that of Columella--\r\n\r\n    Tu vero, Juni, silvestria rura canendo,\r\n    Post te ipsas urbes in tua rura trahis;\r\n\r\nbut certainly, with a few more woodcuts, it would, in minute and\r\ngraphic illustration, by prints and letterpress be a most worthy\r\ncompanion to the work of Agricola.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the book is to give a history of the agricultural year,\r\nafter the manner of the Roman Palladius and our own old Tucker; and\r\nthe present volume embraces the operations of the skilful farmer in\r\nevery kind of husbandry during the winter and spring. But, before we\r\ncome to the heart of the book, hear what Mr Stephens says about the\r\nagricultural learning of our landed gentry:--\r\n\r\n     \"Even though he devote himself to the profession of arms or\r\n     the law, and thereby confer distinction on himself, if he\r\n     prefer either to the neglect of agriculture he is rendering\r\n     himself unfit to undertake the duties of a landlord. To\r\n     become a soldier or a lawyer, he willingly undergoes\r\n     initiatory drillings and examinations; but to acquire the\r\n     duties of a landlord before he becomes one, he considers it\r\n     quite unnecessary to undergo initiatory tuition. These, he\r\n     conceives, can be learned at any time, and seems to forget\r\n     that the conducting of a landed estate is a profession, as\r\n     difficult of thorough attainment as ordinary soldiership or\r\n     legal lore. The army is an excellent school for confirming,\r\n     in the young, principles of honour and habits of discipline;\r\n     and the bar for giving a clear insight into the principles\r\n     upon which the rights of property are based, and of the\r\n     relation betwixt landlord and tenant; but a knowledge of\r\n     practical agriculture is a weightier matter than either for a\r\n     landlord, and should not be neglected.\r\n\r\n     \"One evil arising from studying those exciting professions\r\n     before agriculture is, that, however short may have been the\r\n     time in acquiring them, it is sufficiently long to create a\r\n     distaste to learn agriculture afterwards practically--for\r\n     such a task can only be undertaken, after the turn of life,\r\n     by enthusiastic minds. But as farming is necessarily _the\r\n     profession_ of the landowner, it should be learned,\r\n     theoretically and practically, before his education is\r\n     finished. If he so incline, he can afterwards enter the army\r\n     or go to the bar, and the exercise of those professions will\r\n     not efface the knowledge of agriculture previously acquired.\r\n     This is the proper course, in my opinion, for every young man\r\n     destined to become a landowner to pursue, and who is desirous\r\n     of finding employment as long as he has not to exercise the\r\n     functions of a landlord. Were this course invariably pursued,\r\n     the numerous engaging ties of a country life would tend in\r\n     many to extinguish the kindling desire for any other\r\n     profession. Such a result would be most advantageous for the\r\n     country; for only consider the effects of the course pursued\r\n     at present by landowners. It strikes every one as an\r\n     incongruity for a country gentleman to be unacquainted with\r\n     country affairs. Is it not strange that he should require\r\n     inducements to learn his hereditary profession,--to become\r\n     familiar with the only business which can enable him to\r\n     enhance the value of his estate, and increase his income?\r\n     Does it not infer infatuation to neglect becoming well\r\n     acquainted with the condition of his tenants, by whose\r\n     exertions his income is raised, and by which knowledge he\r\n     might confer happiness on many families, and in ignorance of\r\n     which he may entail lasting misery on many more? It is in\r\n     this way too many country gentlemen neglect their moral\r\n     obligations.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a manifest inconvenience to country gentlemen, when\r\n     taking a prominent part in county matters without a competent\r\n     knowledge of agriculture, to be obliged to apologise for not\r\n     having sufficiently attended to agricultural affairs. Such an\r\n     avowal is certainly candid, but is anything but creditable to\r\n     those who have to make it. When elected members of the\r\n     legislature, it is deplorable to find so many of them so\r\n     little acquainted with the questions which bear directly or\r\n     indirectly on agriculture. On these accounts, the tenantry\r\n     are left to fight their own battles on public questions. Were\r\n     landowners practically acquainted with agriculture, such\r\n     painful avowals would be unnecessary, and a familiar\r\n     acquaintance with agriculture would enable the man of\r\n     cultivated mind at once to perceive its practical bearing on\r\n     most public questions.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what he says respectively of the ignorant and skilful factor or\r\nagent is quite as deserving of attention. Not merely whole estates,\r\nbut in some parts of the island, whole counties lag in arrear through\r\nthe defective education and knowledge of the agents as a class:--\r\n\r\n     \"A still greater evil, because less personal, arises on\r\n     consigning the management of valuable estates to the care of\r\n     men as little acquainted as the landowners themselves with\r\n     practical agriculture. A factor or agent, in that condition,\r\n     always affects much zeal for the interest of his employer.\r\n     Fired by it, and possessing no knowledge to form a sound\r\n     judgment, he soon discovers something he considers wrong\r\n     among the poorer tenants. Some rent perhaps is in arrear--the\r\n     strict terms of the lease have been deviated from--the\r\n     condition of the tenant seems declining. These are favourable\r\n     symptoms for a successful contention with him. Instead of\r\n     interpreting the terms of the lease in a generous spirit, the\r\n     factor hints that the rent would be better secured through\r\n     another tenant. Explanation of circumstances affecting the\r\n     actual condition of the farm, over which he has, perhaps, no\r\n     control,--the inapplicability, perhaps, of peculiar covenants\r\n     in the lease to the particular circumstances of the farm--the\r\n     lease having perhaps been drawn up by a person ignorant of\r\n     agriculture,--are excuses unavailingly offered to a factor\r\n     confessedly unacquainted with country affairs, and the result\r\n     ensues in disputes betwixt him and the tenant. To\r\n     explanations, the landlord is _unwilling_ to listen, in order\r\n     to preserve intact the authority of the factor; or, what is\r\n     still worse, is _unable_ to interfere, because of his own\r\n     inability to judge of the actual state of the case betwixt\r\n     himself and the tenant, and, of course, the disputes are left\r\n     to be settled by the originator of them. Thus commence\r\n     actions at law,--criminations and recriminations,--much\r\n     alienation of feeling; and at length a proposal for the\r\n     settlement of matters, at first perhaps unimportant, by the\r\n     arbitration of practical men. The tenant is glad to submit to\r\n     an arbitration to save his money; and in all such disputes,\r\n     being the weaker party, he suffers most in purse and\r\n     character. The landlord, who ought to have been the\r\n     protector, is thus converted into the unconscious oppressor\r\n     of his tenant.\r\n\r\n     \"A factor acquainted with practical agriculture would conduct\r\n     himself very differently in the same circumstances. He would\r\n     endeavour to prevent legitimate differences of opinion on\r\n     points of management from terminating in disputes, by skilful\r\n     investigation and well-timed compromise. He would study to\r\n     uphold the honour of both landlord and tenant. He would at\r\n     once see whether the terms of the lease were strictly\r\n     applicable to the circumstances of the farm, and, judging\r\n     accordingly, would check improper deviations from proper\r\n     covenants, whilst he would make allowances for inappropriate\r\n     ones. He would soon discover whether the condition of the\r\n     tenant was caused more by his own mismanagement than by the\r\n     nature of the farm he occupies, and he would conform his\r\n     conduct towards him accordingly--encouraging industry and\r\n     skill, admonishing indolence, and amending the objectionable\r\n     circumstances of the farm. Such a factor is always highly\r\n     respected, and his opinion and judgment are entirely confided\r\n     in by the tenantry. Mutual kindliness of intercourse,\r\n     therefore, always subsists betwixt such factors and the\r\n     tenants. No landlord, whether acquainted or unacquainted with\r\n     farming, especially in the latter case, should confide the\r\n     management of his estate to any person less qualified.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts are long, but we feel we are rendering the public a\r\nservice by placing them where they are likely to be widely read.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned above that the _Book of the Farm_ is full of that\r\nkind of clear home knowledge of rural life which the emigrant in\r\nforeign climes at all resembling our own will delight to read and\r\nprofit by; but it will not supply the place of previous agricultural\r\ntraining. There is much truth and sound practical advice in the\r\nfollowing observations:--\r\n\r\n     \"Let _every_ intending settler, therefore, _learn agriculture\r\n     thoroughly_ before he emigrates; and, if it suits his taste,\r\n     time, and arrangements, let him study in the colony the\r\n     necessarily imperfect system pursued by the settlers, before\r\n     he embarks in it himself; and the fuller knowledge acquired\r\n     here will enable him, not only to understand the colonial\r\n     scheme in a short time, but to select the part of the country\r\n     best suited to his purpose. But, in truth, he has much higher\r\n     motives for learning agriculture here; for a thorough\r\n     acquaintance will enable him to make the best use of\r\n     inadequate means--to know to apply cheap animal instead of\r\n     dear manual labour,--to suit the crop to the soil, and the\r\n     labour to the weather;--to construct appropriate dwellings\r\n     for himself and family, live stock, and provisions; to\r\n     superintend every kind of work, and to show a familiar\r\n     acquaintance with them all. These are qualifications which\r\n     every emigrant may acquire here, but not in the colonies\r\n     without a large sacrifice of time--and time to a settler thus\r\n     spent is equal to a sacrifice of capital, whilst eminent\r\n     qualifications are equivalent to capital itself. This\r\n     statement may be stigmatised by agricultural settlers who may\r\n     have succeeded in amassing fortunes without more knowledge\r\n     of agriculture than what was picked up by degrees on the\r\n     spot; but such persons are incompetent judges of a statement\r\n     like this, never having become properly acquainted with\r\n     agriculture; and however successful their exertions may have\r\n     proved, they might have realised larger incomes in the time,\r\n     or as large in a shorter time, had they brought an intimate\r\n     acquaintance of the most perfect system of husbandry known,\r\n     to bear upon the favourable circumstances they occupied.\"\r\n\r\nThe early winter is spent in ploughing, which we pass over, and\r\nmid-winter chiefly in feeding stock, in threshing out the corn, and in\r\nattending to composts and dunghills. Preparing and sowing the seed is\r\nthe most important business of the spring months, to which succeeds\r\nthe tending of the lambs and ewes, and the preparation of the land for\r\nthe fallow or root crops. These several operations are treated of in\r\ntheir most minute details, and the latest methods adopted in reference\r\nto every point are fully explained.\r\n\r\nIn the husbandry of the most advanced portions of our island, the\r\nturnip occupies a most important place in the estimation of the\r\nskilful farmer, whether his dependence for the means of paying his\r\nrent be placed upon the profits of his corn crops or of his cattle.\r\n\r\nOf the turnip we have now many varieties--though it is only seventy or\r\neighty years since it was first introduced into field culture--at\r\nleast in those districts of the island in which its importance is most\r\nfully recognised. The history of its introduction into Scotland is\r\nthus given by Mr Stephens--\r\n\r\n     \"The history of the turnip, like that of other cultivated\r\n     plants, is obscure. According to the name given to the swede\r\n     in this country, it is a native of Sweden; the Italian name\r\n     _Navoni di Laponia_ intimates an origin in Lapland, and the\r\n     French names _Chou de Lapone_, _Chou de Suède_, indicate an\r\n     uncertain origin. Sir John Sinclair says, 'I am informed that\r\n     the swedes were first introduced into Scotland _anno_ 1781-2,\r\n     on the recommendation of Mr Knox, a native of East Lothian,\r\n     who had settled at Gottenburg, whence he sent some of the\r\n     seeds to Dr Hamilton.' There is no doubt the plant was first\r\n     introduced into Scotland from Sweden, but I believe its\r\n     introduction was prior to the date mentioned by Sir John\r\n     Sinclair. The late Mr Airth, Mains of Dunn, Forfarshire,\r\n     informed me that his father was the first farmer who\r\n     cultivated swedes in Scotland, from seeds sent him by his\r\n     eldest son, settled in Gottenburg, when my informant, the\r\n     youngest son of a large family, was a boy of about ten years\r\n     of age. Whatever may be the date of its introduction, Mr\r\n     Airth cultivated them in 1777; and the date is corroborated\r\n     by the silence preserved by Mr Wight regarding its culture by\r\n     Mr Airth's father when he undertook the survey of the state\r\n     of husbandry in Scotland, in 1773, at the request of the\r\n     Commissioners of the Annexed Estates, and he would not have\r\n     failed to report so remarkable a circumstance as the culture\r\n     of so useful a plant, so that it was unknown prior to 1773.\r\n     Mr Airth sowed the first portion of seed he received in beds\r\n     in the garden, and transplanted the plants in rows in the\r\n     field, and succeeded in raising good crops for some years,\r\n     before sowing the seed directly in the fields.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight of a good turnip crop--not of an extraordinary crop, which\r\nsome persons can succeed in raising, and the accounts of which others\r\nonly refuse to credit--is a point of much importance; and it is so,\r\nnot merely to the farmer who possesses it, but to the rural community\r\nat large. The conviction that a certain given weight is a fair average\r\ncrop in well-farmed land, where it does not exceed his own, will be\r\nsatisfactory to the industrious farmer; while it will serve as a\r\nstimulus to those whose soil, or whose skill, have hitherto been\r\nunable to raise so large a weight. According to our author--\r\n\r\n     \"A good crop of swede turnips weighs from 30 to 35 tons per\r\n     imperial acre.\r\n\r\n     \"A good crop of yellow turnips weighs from 30 to 32 tons per\r\n     imperial acre.\r\n\r\n     \"A good crop of white globe turnips weighs from 30 to 40 tons\r\n     per imperial acre.\"\r\n\r\nOf all kinds of turnips, therefore, from 30 to 40 tons per imperial\r\nacre are a good crop.\r\n\r\nThe readers of agricultural journals must have observed that, of late\r\nyears, the results of numerous series of experiments have been\r\npublished. Among those that have been made upon turnips, he will have\r\nnoticed also that the crop, in about nine cases out of ten, is under\r\ntwenty tons; that these crops vary, for the most part, between nine\r\nand sixteen tons; and that some farmers are not ashamed to publish to\r\nthe world, that they are content with crops of from seven to ten tons\r\nof turnips an acre. Where is our skill in the management of turnip\r\nsoils, if, in the average of years, such culture and crops satisfy any\r\nconsiderable number of our more intelligent tenantry? We know that\r\nsoil, and season, and locality, and numerous accidents, affect the\r\nproduce of this crop; but the margin between the _actual_ and the\r\n_possible_ is far too wide to be accounted for in this way. More\r\nskill, more energy, more expenditure in draining, liming, and\r\nmanuring--a wider diffusion of our practical and scientific\r\nagricultural literature--these are the means by which the wide margin\r\nis to be narrowed; by which what is in the land is to be brought _out_\r\nof the land, and thereby the farmer made more comfortable, and the\r\nlandlord more rich.\r\n\r\nThe subject of sheep and cattle feeding is very important, and very\r\ninteresting, and our book is rich in materials which would provoke us\r\nto discuss it at some length, did our limits admit of it. We must be\r\ncontent, however, with a few desultory extracts.\r\n\r\nThe following, in regard to sheep feeding upon turnips, is curious,\r\nand, in our opinion, requires repetition:--\r\n\r\n     \"A curious and unexpected result was brought to light by Mr\r\n     Pawlett, and is thus related in his own words,--'Being aware\r\n     that it was the custom of some sheep-breeders to wash the\r\n     food,--such as turnips, carrots, and other roots,--for their\r\n     sheep, I was induced also to try the system; and as I usually\r\n     act cautiously in adopting any new scheme, generally bringing\r\n     it down to the true standard of experience, I selected for\r\n     the trial two lots of lambs. One lot was fed, in the usual\r\n     manner, on carrots and swedes _unwashed_; the other lot was\r\n     fed exactly on the same kinds of food, but the carrots and\r\n     swedes were _washed_ very clean every day: they were weighed\r\n     before trial, on the 2d December, and again on the 30th\r\n     December, 1835. The lambs fed with the unwashed food gained\r\n     each 7-1/2 lb., and those on the washed gained 4-3/4 lb.\r\n     each; which shows that those lambs which were fed in the\r\n     usual way, without having their food washed, gained the most\r\n     weight in a month by 2-3/4 lb. each lamb. There appears to me\r\n     no advantage in this method of management--indeed animals are\r\n     fond of licking the earth, particularly if fresh turned up;\r\n     and a little of it taken into the stomach with the food must\r\n     be conducive to their health, or nature would not lead them\r\n     to take it.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother experiment on the fattening properties of different breeds of\r\nsheep, under similar treatment, quoted from the _Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England_, is also deserving the attention of\r\nour readers:--\r\n\r\n     \"Experiments were made in 1844-5 on the Earl of Radnor's farm\r\n     at Coleshill, on the comparative fattening properties of\r\n     different breeds of sheep under the same treatment. The sheep\r\n     consisted of Leicesters, South-downs, half-breds,--a cross\r\n     between the Cotswold and South-down--and Cotswolds. The\r\n     sheep, being then lambs, were divided into lots of three each\r\n     of each breed, and were grazed four months, from 29th August\r\n     1844 to 4th January 1845, when they were put on hay and\r\n     swedes for three months, from 4th January to the 31st of\r\n     March following. While on grass, the different breeds gained\r\n     in weight as follows:--\r\n\r\n                              lb.                 lb.\r\n     The Leicesters being     46    each, gained  10-1/2 each.\r\n         South-downs          47         \"        11\r\n         Half-breds           44-1/2     \"        12\r\n         Cotswolds            56-1/2     \"        10-1/2\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most delicate qualifications connected with the\r\nstock-feeder's art to be able to select that stock, and that variety\r\nof it, which, under all the circumstances in which he is placed, will\r\ngive him the largest return in money--hence every experiment like the\r\nabove, if well conducted, is deserving of his close attention. At the\r\nsame time, in rural experiments, more almost than in any other, the\r\nnumber of elements which interfere with the result, and may modify it,\r\nis so great, that too much confidence ought not to be placed upon\r\nsingle trials. Repeated results _of one kind_ must be obtained, before\r\na farmer can be justified in spending much money on the faith of them.\r\n\r\nIn turning to the winter feeding of cattle upon turnips and other\r\nfood--a subject important enough to justify Mr Stephens in devoting\r\nforty of his closely printed pages to it--we are reminded of a\r\ncharacter of this book which we like very much, which squares\r\nadmirably with our own idea of neatness, order, and method, and which\r\nwe heartily commend to the attention of our farming friends: this is\r\nthe full and minute description he gives of the duties of every class\r\nof servants upon the farm, of the necessity of having these duties\r\nregularly and methodically performed, and of the way in which the\r\nmaster may bring this about.\r\n\r\nThe cattle-man is an important person in the winter feeding of cattle;\r\nhe therefore commences this section with an account of the duties and\r\nconduct of this man. Even his dress he describes; and the following\r\nparagraph shows his reason for drawing the young farmer's attention to\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n     \"The _dress_ of a cattle-man is worth attending to, as\r\n     regards its appropriateness for his business. Having so much\r\n     straw to carry on his back, a bonnet or round-crowned hat is\r\n     the most convenient head-dress for him; but what is of more\r\n     importance when he has charge of a bull, is to have his\r\n     clothes of a sober hue, free of gaudy or strongly-contrasted\r\n     colours, especially _red_, as that colour is peculiarly\r\n     offensive to bulls. It is with red cloth and flags that the\r\n     bulls in Spain are irritated to action at their celebrated\r\n     bull-fights. Instances are in my remembrance of bulls turning\r\n     upon their keepers, not because they were habited in red, but\r\n     from some strongly contrasted bright colours. It was stated\r\n     that the keeper of the celebrated bull Sirius, belonging to\r\n     the late Mr Robertson of Ladykirk, wore a red nightcap on the\r\n     day the bull attacked and killed him. On walking with a lady\r\n     across a field, my own bull--the one represented in the plate\r\n     of the Short-horn Bull, than which a more gentle and generous\r\n     creature of his kind never existed--made towards us in an\r\n     excited state; and for his excitement I could ascribe no\r\n     other cause than the red shawl worn by the lady, for as soon\r\n     as we left the field he resumed his wonted quietness. I\r\n     observed him excited, on another occasion, in his hammel,\r\n     when the cattle-man--an aged man, who had taken charge of him\r\n     for years--attended him one Sunday forenoon in a new red\r\n     nightcap, instead of his usual black hat. Be the cause of the\r\n     disquietude in the animal what it may, it is prudential in a\r\n     _cattle_-man to be habited in a sober suit of clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after insisting upon _regularity of time_ in everything he does,\r\nfollowing the man through a whole day's work, describing all his\r\noperations, and giving figures of all his tools,--his graip, his\r\nshovel, his different turnip choppers, his turnip-slicer, his\r\nwheel-barrow, his chaff-cutters, his linseed bruisers, and his\r\ncorn-crushers,--he gives us the following illustration of the\r\nnecessity of regularity and method, and of the way to secure them:--\r\n\r\n     \"In thus minutely detailing the duties of the cattle-man, my\r\n     object has been to show you rather how the turnips and fodder\r\n     should be distributed relatively than absolutely; but\r\n     whatever hour and minute the cattle-man finds, from\r\n     experience, he can devote to each portion of his work, you\r\n     should see that he performs _the same operation at the same\r\n     time every day_. By paying strict attention to time, the\r\n     cattle will be ready for and expect their wonted meals at the\r\n     appointed times, and will not complain until they arrive.\r\n     Complaints from his stock should be distressing to every\r\n     farmer's ears, for he may be assured they will not complain\r\n     until they feel hunger; and if allowed to hunger they will\r\n     not only lose condition, but render themselves, by\r\n     discontent, less capable of acquiring it when the food\r\n     happens to be fully given. Wherever you hear lowings from\r\n     cattle, you may safely conclude that matters are conducted\r\n     there in an irregular manner. The cattle-man's rule is a\r\n     simple one, and easily remembered,--_Give food and fodder to\r\n     cattle at fixed times, and dispense them in a fixed routine_.\r\n     I had a striking instance of the bad effects of irregular\r\n     attention to cattle. An old staid labourer was appointed to\r\n     take charge of cattle, and was quite able and willing to\r\n     undertake the task. He got his own way at first, as I had\r\n     observed many labouring men display great ingenuity in\r\n     arranging their work. Lowings were soon heard from the stock\r\n     in all quarters, both in and out of doors, which intimated\r\n     the want of regularity in the cattle-man; whilst the poor\r\n     creature himself was constantly in a state of bustle and\r\n     uneasiness. To put an end to this disorderly state of things,\r\n     I apportioned his entire day's work by his own watch; and on\r\n     implicitly following the plan, he not only soon satisfied the\r\n     wants of every animal committed to his charge, but had\r\n     abundant leisure to lend a hand to anything that required his\r\n     temporary assistance. His old heart overflowed with gratitude\r\n     when he found the way of making all his creatures happy; and\r\n     his kindness to them was so undeviating, they would have done\r\n     whatever he liked.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the money profit which this attention to regularity will give, in\r\naddition to the satisfaction which attends it, is thus plainly set\r\ndown:--\r\n\r\n     \"Let us reduce the results of bad management to figures.\r\n     Suppose you have three sets of beasts, of different ages,\r\n     each containing 20 beasts--that is, 60 in all--and they get\r\n     as many turnips as they can eat. Suppose that each of these\r\n     beasts acquires only half a pound less live weight every day\r\n     than they would under the most proper management, and this\r\n     would incur a loss of 30 lbs. a-day of live weight, which,\r\n     over 180 days of the fattening season, will make the loss\r\n     amount to 5400 lbs. of live weight; or, according to the\r\n     common rules of computation, 3240 lbs., or 231 stones, of\r\n     dead weight at 6s. the stone, £69, 6s.--a sum equal to more\r\n     than five times the wages received by the cattle-man. The\r\n     question, then, resolves itself into this--whether it is not\r\n     for your interest to save this sum annually, by making your\r\n     cattle-man attend your cattle according to a regular plan,\r\n     the form of which is in your own power to adopt and pursue?\"\r\n\r\nWe must pass over the entire doctrine of prepared food, which has\r\nlately occupied so much attention, and has been so ably advocated by\r\nMr Warner, Mr Marshall, Mr Thompson, and which, among others, has been\r\nso successfully practised by our friend Mr Hutton of Sowber Hill in\r\nYorkshire. We only quote, by the way, a curious observation of Mr\r\nRobert Stephenson of Whitelaw in East-Lothian:\r\n\r\n     \"'We shall conclude,' he says, 'by relating a singular\r\n     fact'--and a remarkable one it is, and worth\r\n     remembering--'that _sheep_ on turnips will consume nearly in\r\n     proportion to _cattle_, weight for weight; that is, 10 sheep\r\n     of 14 lbs. a-quarter, or 40 stones in all, will eat nearly\r\n     the same quantity of turnips as an ox of 40 stones; but turn\r\n     the ox to grass, and 6 sheep will be found to consume an\r\n     equal quantity. This great difference may perhaps,' says Mr\r\n     Stephenson, and I think truly, 'be accounted for by the\r\n     practice of sheep cropping the grass much closer and oftener\r\n     than cattle, and which, of course, prevents its growing so\r\n     rapidly with them as with cattle.'\"\r\n\r\nThe treatment of farm horses in winter is under the direction of the\r\nploughman, whose duties are first described, after which the system of\r\nmanagement and feeding of farm and saddle horses is discussed at a\r\nlength of thirty pages.\r\n\r\nAmong other pieces of curious information which our author gives us is\r\nthe nomenclature of the animals he treats of, at their various ages.\r\nThis forms a much larger vocabulary than most people imagine, and\r\ncomprises many words of which four-fifths of our population would be\r\nunable to tell the meaning.\r\n\r\nThus, of the sheep he informs us--\r\n\r\n     \"A new-born sheep is called a _lamb_, and retains the name\r\n     until weaned from its mother and able to support itself. The\r\n     generic name is altered according to the sex and state of the\r\n     animal; when a female it is a _ewe-lamb_, when a male\r\n     _tup-lamb_, and this last is changed to _hogg-lamb_ when it\r\n     undergoes emasculation.\r\n\r\n     \"After a lamb has been weaned, until the first fleece is\r\n     shorn from its back, it receives the name of _hogg_, which is\r\n     also modified according to the sex and state of the animal, a\r\n     female being a _ewe-hogg_, a male a _tup-hogg_, and a\r\n     castrated male a _wether-hogg_. After the first fleece has\r\n     been shorn, another change is made in the nomenclature; the\r\n     ewe-hogg then becomes a _gimmer_, the tup-hogg a\r\n     _shearling-tup_, and the wether-hog a _dinmont_, and these\r\n     names are retained until the fleece is shorn a second time.\r\n\r\n     \"After the second shearing another change is effected in all\r\n     these names; the gimmer is then a _ewe_ if she is _in lamb_,\r\n     but if not, a _barren gimmer_ and if never put to the ram a\r\n     _eild gimmer_. The shearling tup is then a _2-shear tup_, and\r\n     the dinmont is a _wether_, but more correctly a _2-shear\r\n     wether_.\r\n\r\n     \"A ewe three times shorn is a _twinter ewe_, (_two-winter\r\n     ewe_;) a tup is a _3-shear tup_; and a wether still a\r\n     _wether_, or more correctly a _3-shear wether_--which is an\r\n     uncommon name among Leicester sheep, as the castrated sheep\r\n     of that breed are rarely kept to that age.\r\n\r\n     \"A ewe four times shorn is a _three winter ewe_, or _aged\r\n     ewe_; a tup, an _aged tup_, a name he retains ever after,\r\n     whatever his age, but they are seldom kept beyond this age;\r\n     and the wether is now a _wether_ properly so called.\r\n\r\n     \"A _tup_ and _ram_ are synonymous terms.\r\n\r\n     \"A ewe that has borne a lamb, when it fails to be with lamb\r\n     again is a _tup-eill_ or _barren ewe_. After a ewe has ceased\r\n     to give milk she is a _yeld-ewe_.\r\n\r\n     \"A ewe when removed from the breeding flock is a _draft ewe_,\r\n     whatever her age may be; gimmers put aside as unfit for\r\n     breeding are _draft gimmers_, and the lambs, dinmonts or\r\n     wethers, drafted out of the fat or young stock are\r\n     _sheddings_, _tails_, or _drafts_.\r\n\r\n     \"In England a somewhat different nomenclature prevails. Sheep\r\n     bear the name of _lamb_ until eight months old, after which\r\n     they are _ewe_ and _wether teggs_ until once clipped. Gimmers\r\n     are _theares_ until they bear the first lamb, when they are\r\n     _ewes of 4-teeth_, next year _ewes of 6-teeth_, and the year\r\n     after _full-mouthed ewes_. Dinmonts are called _shear hoggs_\r\n     until shorn of the fleece, when they are _2-shear wethers_,\r\n     and ever after are _wethers_.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of cattle are a little less complicated.\r\n\r\n     \"The _names_ given to cattle at their various ages are\r\n     these:--A new-born animal of the ox-tribe is called a _calf_,\r\n     a male being a _bull-calf_, a female a _quey-calf_,\r\n     _heifer-calf_, or _cow-calf_; and a castrated male calf is a\r\n     _stot-calf_, or simply a _calf_. Calf is applied to all young\r\n     cattle until they attain one year old, when they are\r\n     _year-olds_ or _yearlings_--_year-old bull_, _year-old quey_\r\n     or heifer, _year-old stot_. _Stot_, in some places, is a bull\r\n     of any age.\r\n\r\n     \"In another year they are _2-year old bull_, _2-year-old\r\n     quey_ or _heifer_, _2-year-old-stot_ or _steer_. In England\r\n     females are _stirks_ from calves to 2-year-old, and males\r\n     _steers_; in Scotland both young male and females are\r\n     _stirks_. The next year they are _3-year-old bull_, in\r\n     England 3-year-old female a _heifer_, in Scotland a\r\n     _3-year-old quey_, and a male is a _3-year-old stot_ or\r\n     _steer_.\r\n\r\n     \"When a quey bears a calf, it is a _cow_, both in Scotland\r\n     and England. Next year the _bulls_ are _aged_; the _cows_\r\n     retain the name ever after, and the _stots_ or _steers_ are\r\n     _oxen_, which they continue to be to any age. A cow or quey\r\n     that has received the bull is _served_ or _bulled_, and is\r\n     then _in calf_, and in that state these are in England\r\n     _in-calvers_. A cow that suffers abortion _slips_ its calf. A\r\n     cow that has either _missed_ being in calf, or has _slipped_\r\n     calf, is _eill_; and one that has gone dry of milk is a\r\n     _yeld-cow_. A cow giving milk is a _milk_ or _milch-cow_.\r\n     When two calves are born at one birth, they are _twins_; if\r\n     three, _trins_. A quey calf of twins of bull and quey calves,\r\n     is a _free martin_, and never produces young, but exhibits no\r\n     marks of a hybrid or mule.\r\n\r\n     \"_Cattle_, _black cattle_, _horned cattle_, and _neat\r\n     cattle_, are all generic names for the ox tribe, and the term\r\n     _beast_ is a synonyme.\r\n\r\n     \"An ox without horns is _dodded_ or _humbled_.\r\n\r\n     \"A castrated bull is a _segg_. A quey-calf whose ovaries have\r\n     been obliterated, to prevent her breeding, is a _spayed\r\n     heifer_ or _quey_.\"\r\n\r\nThose of the horse are fewer, and more generally known--\r\n\r\n     \"The names commonly given to the different states of the\r\n     horse are these:--The new-born one is called a _foal_, the\r\n     male being a _colt foal_, and the female a _filly foal_.\r\n     After being weaned, the foals are called simply _colt_ or\r\n     _filly_, according to the sex, which the colt retains until\r\n     broken in for work, when he is a _horse_ or _gelding_ which\r\n     he retains all his life; and the filly is then changed into\r\n     _mare_. When the colt is not castrated he is an _entire\r\n     colt_; which name he retains until he serves mares, when he\r\n     is a _stallion_ or _entire horse_; when castrated he is a\r\n     _gelding_; and it is in this state that he is chiefly worked.\r\n     A mare, when served, is said to be _covered by_ or _stinted\r\n     to_ a particular stallion; and after she has borne a foal she\r\n     is a _brood mare_, until she ceases to bear, when she is a\r\n     _barren mare_ or _eill mare_; and when dry of milk, she is\r\n     _yeld_. A mare, while big with young, is _in foal_. Old\r\n     stallions are never castrated.\"\r\n\r\nThose of the pig are as follows--\r\n\r\n     \"When new-born, they are called _sucking pigs_, or simply\r\n     _pigs_; and the male is a _boar pig_, the female _sow pig_. A\r\n     castrated male, after it is weaned, is a _shot_ or _hog_. Hog\r\n     is the name mostly used by naturalists, and very frequently\r\n     by writers on agriculture; but, as it sounds so like the name\r\n     given to young sheep, (hogg,) I shall always use the terms\r\n     pig and swine for the sake of distinction. The term _hog_ is\r\n     said to be derived from a Hebrew noun, signifying 'to have\r\n     narrow eyes,' a feature quite characteristic of this species\r\n     of animal. A spayed female is a _cut sow pig_. As long as\r\n     both sorts of cut pigs are small and young, they are\r\n     _porkers_ or _porklings_. A female that has not been cut, and\r\n     before it bears young, is an _open sow_; and an entire male,\r\n     after being weaned, is always a _boar_ or _brawn_. A cut boar\r\n     is a _brawner_. A female that has taken the boar is said to\r\n     be _lined_; when bearing young she is a _brood sow_; and when\r\n     she has brought forth pigs she has _littered_ or _farrowed_,\r\n     and her family of pigs at one birth form a _litter_ or\r\n     _farrow_ of pigs.\"\r\n\r\nThe diseases of cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry, are treated\r\nof--their management in disease, that is, as well as in health. And it\r\nis one of the merits of Mr Stephens that he has taken such pains in\r\ngetting up his different subjects--that he seems as much at home in\r\none department of his art as in another; and we follow him with equal\r\nconfidence in his description of field operations, of servant-choosing\r\nand managing, of cattle-buying, tending, breeding, feeding,\r\nbutchering, and even cooking and eating--for he is cunning in these\r\nlast points also.\r\n\r\nHis great predecessor Tucker prided himself, in his \"_Five hundred\r\npoints_,\" in mixing up huswifry with husbandry:--\r\n\r\n    \"In husbandry matters, where _Pilcrow_[3] ye find,\r\n    That verse appertaineth to Huswif'ry kind;\r\n    So have ye more lessons, if there ye look well,\r\n    Than huswif'ry book doth utter or tell.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing Tucker's example, our author scatters here and there\r\nthroughout his book much useful information for the farmer's wife; and\r\nfor her especial use, no doubt, he has drawn up his curious and\r\ninteresting chapter on the treatment of fowls in winter. To show how\r\nminute his knowledge is upon this point, and how implicitly therefore\r\nhe may be trusted in greater matters, we quote the following:--\r\n\r\n\"Every yellow-legged chicken should be used, whether male or\r\nfemale--their flesh never being so fine as the others.\" \"Young fowls\r\nmay either be roasted or boiled, the male making the best roasted, and\r\nthe female the neatest boiled dish.\" \"The criterion of a fat hen, when\r\nalive, is a plump breast, and the rump feeling thick, fat, and firm,\r\non being handled laterally between the finger and thumb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of a fat goose the mark is, plumpness of muscle over the breast, and\r\nthickness of rump when alive; and in addition, when dead and plucked,\r\nof a uniform covering of _white_ fat under a fine skin on the breast.\"\r\n\"Geese are always roasted in Britain, though a boiled goose is not an\r\nuncommon dish in Ireland; and their flesh is certainly much heightened\r\nin flavour by a stuffing of onions, and an accompaniment of apple\r\nsauce.\"\r\n\r\nWe suppose a boiled goose must be especially tasteless, as we once\r\nknew an old schoolmaster on the North Tyne, whose very stupid pupils\r\nwere always christened _boiled geese_.\r\n\r\nThe threshing and winnowing of grain, which forms so important a part\r\nof the winter operations of a farm, naturally lead our author to\r\ndescribe and figure the different species of corn plants and their\r\nvarieties, and to discuss their several nutritive values, the\r\ngeographical range and distribution of each, and the special uses or\r\nqualities of the different varieties.\r\n\r\nWidely spread and known for so many ages, the home or native country\r\nof our cereal plants is not only unknown, but some suppose the several\r\nspecies, like the varieties of the human race, to have all sprung from\r\na common stock.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a very remarkable circumstance, as observed by Dr\r\n     Lindley, that the native country of wheat, oats, barley, and\r\n     rye should be entirely unknown; for although oats and barley\r\n     were found by Colonel Chesney, apparently wild, on the banks\r\n     of the Euphrates, it is doubtful whether they were not the\r\n     remains of cultivation. This has led to an opinion, on the\r\n     part of some persons, that all our cereal plants are\r\n     artificial productions, obtained accidentally, but retaining\r\n     their habits, which have become fixed in the course of ages.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the original source of our known species of grain, and\r\nof their numerous varieties, it cannot be doubted that their\r\nexistence, at the present time, is a great blessing to man. Of wheat\r\nthere are upwards of a hundred and fifty known varieties, of barley\r\nupwards of thirty, and of oats about sixty. While the different\r\nspecies--wheat, barley, and oats--are each specially confined to large\r\nbut limited regions of the earth's surface, the different varieties\r\nadapt themselves to the varied conditions of soil and climate which\r\nexist within the natural geographical region of each, and to the\r\ndifferent uses for which each species is intended to be employed.\r\n\r\nThus the influence of variety upon the adaptation of the oat to the\r\nsoil, climate, and wants of a given locality, is shown by the\r\nfollowing observations:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Siberian oat is cultivated in the poorer soils and\r\n     higher districts, resists the force of the wind, and yields a\r\n     grain well adapted for the support of farm-horses. The straw\r\n     is fine and pliable, and makes an excellent dry fodder for\r\n     cattle and horses, the saccharine matter in the joints being\r\n     very sensible to the taste. It comes early to maturity, and\r\n     hence its name.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tartarian oat, from the peculiarity of its form, and from its\r\n\"possessing a beard, is of such a hardy nature as to thrive in soils\r\nand climates where the other grains cannot be raised. It is much\r\ncultivated in England, and not at all in Scotland. It is a coarse\r\ngrain, more fit for horse-food than to make into meal. The grain is\r\ndark coloured and awny; the straw coarse, harsh, brittle, and rather\r\nshort.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will see from this extract that the English \"food for\r\nhorses\" is, in reality, not the same thing as the \"chief o' Scotia's\r\nfood;\" and that a little agricultural knowledge would have prevented\r\nDr Johnson from exhibiting, in the same sentence, an example of both\r\nhis ignorance and his venom.\r\n\r\nVariety affects appearance and quality; and how these are to be\r\nconsulted in reference to the market in which the grain is to be sold,\r\nmay be gathered from the following:--\r\n\r\n     \"When wheat is quite opaque, indicating not the least\r\n     translucency, it is in the best state for yielding the finest\r\n     flour--such flour as confectioners use for pastry; and in\r\n     this state it will be eagerly purchased by them at a large\r\n     price. Wheat in this state contains the largest proportion of\r\n     fecula or starch, and is therefore best suited to the\r\n     starch-maker, as well as the confectioner. On the other hand,\r\n     when wheat is translucent, hard, and flinty, it is better\r\n     suited to the common baker than the confectioner and starch\r\n     manufacturer, as affording what is called _strong_ flour,\r\n     that rises boldly with yeast into a spongy dough. Bakers\r\n     will, therefore, give more for good wheat in this state than\r\n     in the opaque; but for bread of finest quality the flour\r\n     should be fine as well as strong, and therefore a mixture of\r\n     the two conditions of wheat is best suited for making the\r\n     best quality of bread. Bakers, when they purchase their own\r\n     wheat, are in the habit of mixing wheat which respectively\r\n     possesses those qualities; and millers who are in the habit\r\n     of supplying bakers with flour, mix different kinds of wheat,\r\n     and grind them together for their use. Some sorts of wheat\r\n     naturally possess _both_ these properties, and on that\r\n     account are great favourites with bakers, though not so with\r\n     confectioners; and, I presume, to this mixed property is to\r\n     be ascribed the great and lasting popularity which Hunter's\r\n     white wheat has so long enjoyed. We hear also of '_high\r\n     mixed_' Danzig wheat, which has been so mixed for the\r\n     purpose, and is in high repute amongst bakers. Generally\r\n     speaking, the purest coloured white wheat indicates most\r\n     opacity, and, of course, yields the finest flour; and red\r\n     wheat is most flinty, and therefore yields the strongest\r\n     flour: a translucent red wheat will yield stronger flour than\r\n     a translucent white wheat, and yet a red wheat never realises\r\n     so high a price in the market as white--partly because it\r\n     contains a larger proportion of refuse in the grinding, but\r\n     chiefly because it yields less fine flour, that is, starch.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to wheat, it has been supposed, that the qualities referred\r\nto in the above extract, as especially fitting certain varieties for\r\nthe use of the confectioner, &c., were owing to the existence of a\r\nlarger quantity of gluten in these kinds of grain. Chemical inquiry\r\nhas, however, nearly dissipated that idea, and with it certain\r\nerroneous opinions, previously entertained, as to their superior\r\nnutritive value. Climate and physiological constitution induce\r\ndifferences in our vegetable productions, which chemical research may\r\ndetect and explain, but may never be able to remove or entirely\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe bran, or external covering of the grain of wheat, has recently\r\nalso been the subject of scientific and economical investigation. It\r\nhas been proved, by the researches of Johnston, confirmed by those of\r\nMiller and others, that the bran of wheat, though less readily\r\ndigestible, contains more nutritive matter than the white interior of\r\nthe grain. Brown, or household bread, therefore, which contains a\r\nportion of the bran, is to be preferred, both for economy and for\r\nnutritive quality, to that made of the finest flour.\r\n\r\nUpon the economy of mixing potato with wheaten flour, and of home-made\r\nbread, Mr Stephens has the following:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is assumed by some people, that a mixture of potatoes\r\n     amongst wheaten flour renders bread lighter and more\r\n     wholesome. That it will make bread whiter, I have no doubt;\r\n     but I have as little doubt that it will render it more\r\n     insipid, and it is demonstrable that it makes it dearer than\r\n     wheaten flour. Thus, take a bushel of 'seconds' flour,\r\n     weighing 56 lbs. at 5s. 6d. A batch of bread, to consist of\r\n     21 lbs., will absorb as much water, and require as much yeast\r\n     and salt, as will yield 7 loaves, of 4 lbs. each, for 2s.\r\n     4d., or 4d. per loaf. 'If, instead of 7 lbs. of the flour,\r\n     the same weight of raw potatoes be substituted, with the hope\r\n     of saving by the comparatively low price of the latter\r\n     article, the quantity of bread that will be yielded will be\r\n     _but a trifle more than would have been produced from 14 lbs.\r\n     of flour only_, without the addition of the 7 lbs. of\r\n     potatoes; for the starch of this root is the only nutritive\r\n     part, and we have proved that but one-seventh or one-eighth\r\n     of it is contained in every pound, the remainder being water\r\n     and innutritive matter. Only 20 lbs. of bread, therefore,\r\n     instead of 28 lbs., will be obtained; and this, though white,\r\n     will be comparatively flavourless, and liable to become dry\r\n     and sour in a few days; whereas, without the latter addition,\r\n     bread made in private families will keep _well_ for 3 weeks,\r\n     though, after a fortnight, it begins to deteriorate,\r\n     especially in the autumn.' The calculation of comparative\r\n     _cost_ is thus shown:--\r\n\r\n     Flour, 14 lbs., say at 1-1/4d. per lb., =  1s. 5-1/2d.\r\n     Potatoes, 7 lbs., say at 5s. per sack,  =  0   2\r\n     Yeast and fuel,                         =  0   4-1/2\r\n                                                ------\r\n                                                2s. 0d.\r\n\r\n     The yield, 20 lbs., or 5 loaves of 4 lbs. each, will be\r\n     nearly 5d. each, which is dearer than the wheaten loaves at\r\n     4d. each, and the bread, besides, of inferior quality.\r\n\r\n     \"'There are persons who assert--for we have heard them--that\r\n     there is no economy in baking at home. An accurate and\r\n     constant attention to the matter, with a close calculation of\r\n     every week's results for several years--a calculation induced\r\n     by the sheer love of investigation and experiment--enables us\r\n     to assure our readers, that a gain is invariably made of from\r\n     1-1/2d. to 2d. on the 4 lb. loaf. If _all_ be intrusted to\r\n     servants, we do not pretend to deny that the waste may\r\n     neutralise the _profit_; but, with care and investigation, we\r\n     pledge our veracity that the saving will prove to be\r\n     considerable.' These are the observations of a lady well\r\n     known to me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the natural history of barley the most remarkable fact is, the high\r\nnorthern latitudes in which it can be successfully cultivated. Not\r\nonly does it ripen in the Orkney and Shetland and Faroe Islands, but\r\non the shores of the White Sea; and near the North Cape, in north\r\nlatitude 70°, it thrives and yields nourishment to the inhabitants. In\r\nIceland, in latitude 63° to 66° north, it ceases to ripen, not because\r\nthe temperature is too low, but because rains fall at an unseasonable\r\ntime, and thus prevent the filling ear from arriving at maturity.\r\n\r\nThe oat is distinguished by its remarkable nutritive quality, compared\r\nwith our other cultivated grains. This has been long known in practice\r\nin the northern parts of the island, where it has for ages formed the\r\nstaple food of the mass of the population, though it was doubted and\r\ndisputed in the south so much, as almost to render the Scotch ashamed\r\nof their national food. Chemistry has recently, however, set the\r\nmatter at rest, and is gradually bringing oatmeal again into general\r\nfavour. We believe that the robust health of many fine families of\r\nchildren now fed upon it, in preference to wheaten flour, is a debt\r\nthey owe, and we trust will not hereafter forget, to chemical science.\r\n\r\nOn oatmeal Mr Stephens gives us the following information:--\r\n\r\n     \"The portion of the oat crop consumed by man is manufactured\r\n     into _meal_. It is never called flour, as the millstones are\r\n     not set so close in grinding it as when wheat is ground, nor\r\n     are the stones for grinding oats made of the same material,\r\n     but most frequently only of sandstone--the old red sandstone\r\n     or greywacke. Oats, unlike wheat, are always kiln-dried\r\n     before being ground; and they undergo this process for the\r\n     purpose of causing the thick husk, in which the substance of\r\n     the grain is enveloped, to be the more easily ground off,\r\n     which it is by the stones being set wide asunder; and the\r\n     husk is blown away, on being winnowed by the fanner, and the\r\n     grain retained, which is then called _groats_. The groats are\r\n     ground by the stones closer set, and yield the meal. The meal\r\n     is then passed through sieves, to separate the thin husk from\r\n     the meal. The meal is made in two states: one _fine_, which\r\n     is the state best adapted for making into bread, in the form\r\n     called oat-cake or bannocks; and the other is coarser or\r\n     _rounder_ ground, and is in the best state for making the\r\n     common food of the country people--porridge, _Scottice_,\r\n     parritch. A difference of custom prevails in respect to the\r\n     use of these two different states of oatmeal, in different\r\n     parts of the country, the fine meal being best liked for all\r\n     purposes in the northern, and the round or coarse meal in the\r\n     southern counties; but as oat-cake is chiefly eaten in the\r\n     north, the meal is there made to suit the purpose of bread\r\n     rather than of porridge; whereas, in the south, bread is made\r\n     from another grain, and oatmeal is there used only as\r\n     porridge. There is no doubt that the round meal makes the\r\n     best porridge, when properly made--that is, seasoned with\r\n     salt, and boiled as long as to allow the particles to swell\r\n     and burst, when the porridge becomes a pultaceous mass. So\r\n     made, with rich milk or cream, few more wholesome dishes can\r\n     be partaken by any man, or upon which a harder day's work can\r\n     be wrought. Children of all ranks in Scotland are brought up\r\n     on this diet, verifying the poet's assertion--\r\n\r\n     \"The halesome parritch, chief o' Scotia's food.\"\r\n\r\n                 BURNS.\r\n\r\n     Forfarshire has long been famed for the quality of its brose\r\n     and oat-cake, while the porridge of the Borders has as long\r\n     been equally famous. It is so everywhere, the sharp soil\r\n     producing the finest cake-meal, and clay land the best meal\r\n     for boiling. Of meal from the varieties of the oat\r\n     cultivated, that of the common Angus oat is the most thrifty\r\n     for a poor man, though its yield in meal is less in\r\n     proportion to the bulk of corn.\"\r\n\r\nMuch valuable information is given on the management of manure-heaps,\r\nand the forming of composts in winter. We especially recommend to the\r\nreader's attention section 2043, which is too long to extract.\r\nRailways have done much to benefit the farmer: in speaking of\r\ncomposts, our author gives us the following example of a local injury\r\nproduced by them:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the vicinity of villages where fish are cured and smoked\r\n     for market, refuse of fish heads and guts make an excellent\r\n     compost with earth. Near Eyemouth and Burnmouth, on the\r\n     Berwickshire coast, 30 barrels of fish refuse, with as much\r\n     earth from the head-ridges as will completely cover the heap,\r\n     are sufficient for an imperial acre. The barrel contains 30\r\n     gallons, and 4 barrels make a cart-load, and the barrel sells\r\n     for 1s. 6d. From 400 to 600 barrels may be obtained for each\r\n     farm in the neighbourhood, in the course of the season. Since\r\n     the opening of the North British railway, the curing of the\r\n     fish is given up, much to the loss of the farmers in that\r\n     locality; and the fishermen now send, by the railway, the\r\n     fish in a fresh state to the larger towns at a distance.\r\n     Thus, railways produce advantage to some, whilst they cause\r\n     loss to others. In the northern counties of Scotland, fish\r\n     refuse is obtained in large quantities during the herring\r\n     fishing season. On the coast of Cornwall, the pilchard\r\n     fishing affords a large supply of refuse for composts.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the calving of cows, to milking, and to the rearing of\r\ncalves, we have information as full, as minute, and as easily\r\nconveyed, as on any of the other subjects which have hitherto engaged\r\nour attention. When treating of the diseases to which cows, on\r\ncalving, are subject, we have been interested with the following\r\ncase:--\r\n\r\n     \"I may here mention an unaccountable fatality which overtook\r\n     a short-horn cow of mine, in Forfarshire, immediately after\r\n     calving. She was an extraordinary milker, giving not less\r\n     than thirty quarts a-day in summer on grass; but what was\r\n     more extraordinary, for two calvings the milk never dried up,\r\n     but continued to flow to the very day of calving, and after\r\n     that event returned in increased quantity. In the third year\r\n     she went naturally dry for about one month prior to the day\r\n     of reckoning; every precaution, however, was taken that the\r\n     milk should dry up without giving her any uneasiness. She\r\n     calved in high health, the milk returned as usual in a great\r\n     flush after calving, but it was impossible to draw it from\r\n     the udder; not a teat would pass milk, _all the four being\r\n     entirely corded_. Quills were first introduced into the\r\n     teats; and then tubes of larger size were pushed up into the\r\n     body of the udder. A little milk ran out of only one of\r\n     them--hope revived; but it soon stopped running, and all the\r\n     art that could be devised by a skilful shepherd proved\r\n     unavailing to draw milk from the udder; rubbing and softening\r\n     the udder with goose-fat, making it warmer with warm\r\n     water--all to no purpose. To render the case more\r\n     distressing, there was not a veterinary surgeon in the\r\n     district. At length the udder inflamed, mortified, and the\r\n     cow died in the most excruciating agony on the third day,\r\n     from being in the highest state of health, though not in high\r\n     condition, as her milking propensity usually kept her lean.\r\n     No loss of the kind ever affected my mind so much--that\r\n     nothing _could_ be done to relieve the distress of an animal\r\n     which could not help itself. I was told afterwards by a\r\n     shepherd, to whom I related the case, that I should have cut\r\n     off all the teats, and although the horrid operation would,\r\n     of course, have destroyed her for a milk cow, she might have\r\n     been saved for feeding. He had never seen a _cow_ so operated\r\n     on; but it suggested itself to him in consequence of having\r\n     been obliged at times to cut off the teats of ewes to save\r\n     their lives. The suggestion I think is good. The cow was bred\r\n     by Mr Currie, when at Brandon in Northumberland.\"\r\n\r\nIs there really no remedy for so distressing a case as this but that\r\nwhich his shepherd recommended? He might, for the benefit of his\r\nreaders, have consulted our friend Professor Dick, whose opinions he\r\nso frequently and so deservedly quotes.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph is very striking, as showing the cruel\r\nabsurdities which ignorance will sometimes not only perpetrate, but\r\nactually establish, as a kind of custom in a country.\r\n\r\n     \"_Tail-ill or Tail-slip._--A very prevalent notion exists in\r\n     Scotland amongst cattle-men, that when the tail of an ox or\r\n     of a cow feels soft and supple immediately above the tuft of\r\n     hair, there is disease in it; and it is called the tail-ill,\r\n     or tail-slip. The almost invariable remedy is to make large\r\n     incision with the knife along the under side of the soft\r\n     part, stuff the wound full of salt and butter, and sometimes\r\n     tar, and roll it up with a bandage for a few days, and when\r\n     the application is removed, the animal is declared quite\r\n     recovered. Now, this notion is an absurdity. There is no such\r\n     disease as that imputed; and as the poor animal subjected to\r\n     its cure is thus tormented, the sooner the absurd notion is\r\n     exposed the better. The notion will not soon be abandoned by\r\n     the cattle-men; but the farmer ought to forbid the\r\n     performance of such an operation on any of his cattle without\r\n     his special permission, and the absurd practice will fall\r\n     into desuetude.\"\r\n\r\nWe have not space for the remainder of this paragraph, which contains\r\nProfessor Dick's _demonstration_ that no such disease exists as the\r\nso-called _Tail-ill_. Mr Stephens' narrations are more like a tale\r\nfrom the times of witchcraft, when old women were supposed to have the\r\npower of bringing disease upon cattle, than of those days of general\r\nenlightenment.\r\n\r\nIn sections 2268 and 2269, there is a recipe for making a cow which\r\nhas once calved give a _full_ supply of milk all the rest of her life,\r\nand which recipe is said to be infallible. This is a _bon-bouche_,\r\nhowever, which we shall leave our readers to turn up for themselves;\r\nand we hope the desire to learn it will induce many of our dairy\r\nfriends to buy the book.\r\n\r\nThe following is the mode adopted in fattening calves at Strathaven,\r\nin Scotland, where the famous veal has been so long grown, chiefly for\r\nthe Glasgow market:--\r\n\r\n     \"Strathaven in Scotland has long been famed for rearing good\r\n     _veal_ for the Glasgow and Edinburgh markets. The dairy\r\n     farmers there retain the quey calves for maintaining the\r\n     number of the cows, while they feed the male calves for veal.\r\n     Their plan is simple, and may be followed anywhere. Milk only\r\n     is given to the calves, and very seldom with any admixture,\r\n     and they are not allowed to suck the cows. Some give milk,\r\n     but sparingly at first, to whet the appetite, and prevent\r\n     surfeit. The youngest calves get the first drawn milk, or\r\n     _fore-broads_, as it is termed, and the older the\r\n     _afterings_, even of two or three cows, being the richest\r\n     portion of the milk. After being three or four weeks old,\r\n     they get abundance of milk twice a-day. They get plenty of\r\n     dry litter, fresh air, moderate warmth, and are kept nearly\r\n     in the dark to check sportiveness. They are not bled during\r\n     the time they are fed, and a lump of chalk is placed within\r\n     their reach. They are fed from 4 to 6 weeks, when they fetch\r\n     from £3 to £4 a-piece; and it is found more profitable to\r\n     fatten the larger number of calves for that time, to succeed\r\n     each other, of from 25 lb. to 30 lb. per quarter, than to\r\n     force a fewer number beyond the state of marketable veal.\"\r\n\r\nThe Caledonian Railway now puts this choice veal within the reach of\r\nEnglish mouths; and we hope it will, at the same time, add to the\r\nprosperity and profits of the Strathaven breeders.\r\n\r\nThe lambing of ewes, the care of the mothers and offspring, the\r\ndiseases to which they are subject, as well as the other operations\r\nwhich demand the farmer's care in the months of spring, we must pass\r\nby. We could go on commenting and quoting from this book, as we have\r\nalready done, till an entire number of Maga was filled up. But as this\r\nwould be preposterous, we stop, earnestly pressing upon our readers to\r\nplace a copy of this storehouse of rural information in the hands of\r\nevery practical husbandman, in whose professional skill they are at\r\nall interested.\r\n\r\nThose who, like ourselves, take an interest in the diffusion of\r\nimproved agriculture, scientific, and practical--and especially of our\r\nown agricultural literature in other countries--will be pleased to\r\nlearn, not only that the work of which the title is prefixed to the\r\npresent article, as well as the others upon agricultural chemistry to\r\nwhich we have referred, have made their way into the common stock of\r\nthe book-stores of the United States, but that the editing of the\r\nAmerican reprint of the second edition of the _Book of the Farm_ has\r\nbeen undertaken by our friend Professor Norton, of Yale College, (may\r\nhis shadow never be less!) so well known and esteemed in Scotland,\r\nwhere he obtained the Highland Society's £50 prize for a chemical\r\nexamination of our native oat, which was published in their\r\nTransactions. He is a worthy representative of the \"country of steady\r\nhabits\" to which he belongs; and we hope his countrymen will be\r\ndiscriminating enough to appreciate his own character and scientific\r\nlabours, as well as the value of the books he undertakes to bring\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Stephens' _Book of the Farm_, Second Edition, vol. I.\r\n\r\n[2] In a recent number of the _North British Agriculturist_, it is\r\nstated that an agricultural stoker, who thought himself qualified to\r\ndiscourse on the uses of science to agriculture, had astonished a late\r\nmeeting of the Newcastle Farmers' Club by telling them that the only\r\nthing science had yet done for agriculture was to show them how to\r\ndissolve bones in sulphuric acid; and that chemistry might boast of\r\nhaving really effected something if it could teach him to raise long\r\npotatoes, as he used to do, or to grow potato instead of Tartary oats,\r\nas his next-door neighbour could do. No wonder the shrewd Tyne-siders\r\nwere astonished.\r\n\r\n[3] Where ¶ (_pilcrow_,) or paragraph, is placed at the side of the\r\nverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYCAMINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    The frail yellow leaves they are falling\r\n      As the wild winds sweep the grove;\r\n    Plashy and dank is the sward beneath,\r\n      And the sky it is gray above.\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n    Foaming adown the dark rocks,\r\n      Dirge-like, the waterfall\r\n    Mourns, as if mourning for something gone,\r\n      For ever beyond its call.\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n    Sing, redbreast! from the russet spray;\r\n      Thy song with the season blends:\r\n    For the bees have left us with the blooms,\r\n      And the swallows were summer friends.\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n    The hawthorn bare, with berries sere,\r\n      And the bramble by the stream,\r\n    Matted, with clay on its yellow trails,\r\n      Decay's wan emblems seem.\r\n\r\n    V.\r\n\r\n    On this slope bank how oft we lay\r\n      In shadow of the sycamine tree;\r\n    Pause, hoary Eld, and listen now--\r\n      'Twas but the roaring of the sea!\r\n\r\n    VI.\r\n\r\n    Oh, the shouts and the laughter of yore--\r\n      How the tones wind round the heart!\r\n    Oh, the faces blent with youth's blue skies--\r\n      And could ye so depart!\r\n\r\n    VII.\r\n\r\n    The crow screams back to the wood,\r\n      And the sea-mew to the sea,\r\n    And earth seems to the foot of man\r\n      No resting-place to be.\r\n\r\n    VIII.\r\n\r\n    Search ye the corners of the world,\r\n      And the isles beyond the main,\r\n    And the main itself, for those who went\r\n      To come not back again!\r\n\r\n    IX.\r\n\r\n    The rest are a remnant scatter'd\r\n      Mid the living; and, for the dead,\r\n    Tread lightly o'er the churchyard mounds;\r\n      Ye know not where ye tread!\r\n\r\n                [Delta]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER A YEAR'S REPUBLICANISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary year has almost closed; the anniversary of the days\r\nof February is at hand. A Year's Republicanism has run the course of\r\nits unchecked experience in France: to believe its own boast, it has\r\nridden boldly forward, seated upon public and popular opinion, in the\r\nform of the widest, and, upon republican principle, the honest basis\r\nof universal suffrage; it has been left to its own full career,\r\nunimpeded by enemies either at home or abroad. And what has been the\r\nresult of the race?--what has been the harvest which the republican\r\nsoil, so carefully turned over, tilled, and manured, has produced?\r\n\r\nIt would be a useless task to recapitulate all the different stages of\r\nthe growth of the so-called fair green tree of liberty, and enumerate\r\nall the fruits that it has let drop from time to time, from the\r\nearliest days of last spring, to the tempestuous summer month of June;\r\nand then, through the duller, heavier, and gloomy months of autumn, to\r\nthose of winter, which brought a president as a Christmas-box, and\r\nwhich have shown a few scattered gleams of fancied sunshine, cold at\r\nthe best, and quickly obscured again by thick-coming clouds of\r\ndis-accord, misapprehension, and startling opposition of parties. All\r\nthe world has had these fruits dished up to it--has handled them,\r\nexamined them, tasted them; and, according to their opinions or\r\nprejudices, men have judged their savour bitter or sweet. All that can\r\nbe said on the subject, for those who have digested them with\r\npleasure, is, that \"there's no accounting for tastes.\" In calculating\r\nthe value of the year's republicanism which France has treasured up in\r\nits history, it is as well, then, to make no further examination into\r\nthe items, but to look to the sum-total as far as it can be added up\r\nand put together, in the present aspect of affairs. In spite of the\r\nopenly expressed detestation of the provinces to the capital--in spite\r\nof the increasing spirit of decentralisation, and the efforts made by\r\nthe departments to insure a certain degree of importance to\r\nthemselves--it is still Paris that reigns paramount in its power, and\r\nas the influential expression, however false in many respects it may\r\nbe, of the general spirit of the country. It is upon the aspect of\r\naffairs in Paris, then, and all its numerous conflicting elements,\r\nthat observation must still be directed, in order to make a _résumé_,\r\nas far as it is practicable, of this sum-total of a year's republican\r\nrule. The account must necessarily be, more or less, a confused one,\r\nfor accounts are not strictly kept in Republican Paris--are\r\ncontinually varying in their results, according as the political\r\narithmeticians set about their \"casting up\"--and are constantly\r\nsubject to dispute among the accountants: the main figures, composing\r\nthe sum-total, may, however, be enumerated without any great error,\r\nand then they may be put together in their true amount, and according\r\nto their real value, by those before whom they are thus laid.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking figures in the row, inasmuch as the lateness\r\nof the events has made it one of the most prominent, is to be derived\r\nfrom the position and designs of those who declare themselves to be\r\nthe only true and pure republicans in the anomalous Republic of\r\nFrance, as exemplified by that revolutionary movement which, although\r\nit led to no better result than a _révolution avortée_, takes its date\r\nin the history of the Republic beside the more troublous one of May,\r\nand the more bloody one of June, as \"the affair of the 29th of\r\nJanuary.\" Paris, after the removal of the state of siege, had done its\r\nbest to put on its physiognomy of past years, had smeared over its\r\nwrinkles as best it might, and had made sundry attempts to smile\r\nthrough all this hasty plastering of its poor distorted face. Its\r\nshattered commerce still showed many rags and rents; but it had pulled\r\nits disordered dress with decency about it, and set it forth in the\r\nbest lights; it had called foreigners once more around it, to admire\r\nit; and they had come at the call, although slowly and with mistrust.\r\nIt had some hopes of mending its rags, then, and even furbishing up a\r\nnew fresh _toilette_, almost as smart as of yore; it danced and sang\r\nagain, although faintly and with effort. The National Assembly\r\nclamoured and fought, it is true; but Paris was grown accustomed to\r\nsuch discordant music, and at most only stopped its ears to it:\r\nministers held their portfolios with ticklish balance, as if about to\r\nlet them fall; but Paris was determined not to care who dropped\r\nportfolios, or who caught them: there were clouds again upon the\r\npolitical horizon, and distant rumblings of a crisis-thunderstorm; but\r\nParis seemed resolved to look out for fine weather. All on a sudden,\r\none bright morning, on the 29th of January, the smile vanished: the\r\ntroubled physiognomy was again there; the revolutionary air again\r\npervaded it; and foreigners once more, not liking the looks of the\r\nconvulsed face, began to start back in alarm. The _rappel_ was again\r\nbeaten, for the turning out of the national guards at the earliest\r\nhour of the morning: that drumming, which for many months had filled\r\nthe air incessantly, again deafened sensitive ears and harassed\r\nsensitive nerves. The streets were thronged with troops, marching\r\nforwards in thick battalions; while before them retreated some\r\nhundreds of those nameless beings, who come no one knows whence, and\r\ngo no one knows whither--those mysterious beings, peculiar to\r\nrevolutionary cities, who only appear like a cloud of stinging dust\r\nwhen the wind of the revolution-tempest begins to blow, and who in\r\nParis are either brigands or heroes of barricades, according as the\r\nlanguage of the day may go--back, back, grumbling and threatening,\r\ninto the faubourgs, where they vanished until the gale may blow\r\nstormier again, and meet with less resistance. The garden of the\r\nTuileries was closed to the public, and exhibited an armed array once\r\nmore among its leafless trees; the Champs Elysées had again become a\r\ncamp and a bivouac; cannon was again posted around the National\r\nAssembly. Formidable military posts surrounded every public building;\r\nthe streets were crowded with the curious; thick knots of men again\r\nstood at every corner; people asked once more, \"What's on foot now?\"\r\nbut no one at first could answer: they only repeated from mouth to\r\nmouth the mysterious words of General Changarnier, that \"he who should\r\nventure to displace a paving-stone would never again replace it;\" and\r\nthey knew what that meant. Paris was, all at once, its revolutionary\r\nself again; and, in some degree, so it remained during the ensuing\r\nweeks--with cannon displayed on hazardous points, and the great\r\nrailway stations of the capital filled with battalions of soldiers,\r\nbivouacking upon straw in courts and _salles d' attente_; and huge\r\nmilitary posts at every turn, and thick patrols parading gloomily at\r\nnight, and palaces and public buildings closed and guarded, just as if\r\nretrograde monarchy were about to suppress fervent liberalism, and a\r\n\"glorious republic\" had not been established for a country's happiness\r\nwellnigh a year already; just as if republicans, who had conspired\r\ndarkly a year before, had not obtained all they _then_ clamoured\r\nfor--a republic based upon institutions resulting from universal\r\nsuffrage--and were conspiring again. And so it was. A deep-laid\r\nconspiracy--a conspiracy of republicans against a republic, which they\r\nchose to call deceptive and illusory--was again on foot. They had\r\npossessed, for nigh a year, the blessing for which they had conspired,\r\nintrigued, and fought; and they conspired, intrigued, and would have\r\nfought again. One of the figures, then, to form the total which has to\r\nbe summed up as the result of a year's republicanism, is--conspiracy;\r\nconspiracy more formidable than ever, because more desperate, more\r\nbloody-minded in its hopes, more destructive in its designs to all\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the denegations of the Red-republican party, and the\r\ncounter-accusations of their allies the _Montagnards_ in the Assembly,\r\nthe question of all Paris, \"What's on foot now?\" was soon answered; and\r\nthe answer, spite of these same denegations, and counter-accusations,\r\nwas speedily understood and believed by all France. A conspiracy of the\r\nultra-democrats, Red republicans and Socialists, (all now so shaken up\r\ntogether in one common dark bag of underhand design, that it is\r\nimpossible to distinguish the shades of such parties,) was on the\r\npoint of breaking out in the capital: the 29th of January had been\r\nfixed upon by the conspirators for their general insurrection. The Red\r\nrepublicans (to include all the factions of the anarchist parties under\r\nthat title, in which they themselves rejoice, although the designation\r\nbe derived from \"blood\") had felt how strong and overpowering had\r\nbecome the clamour raised throughout the land against that National\r\nAssembly which had run its course, and was now placed in constant\r\nopposition, not only to the president of the republic, as represented\r\nby his ministers, but to the general spirit and feeling of the country\r\nat large; they were aware, but too feelingly, that, should the Assembly\r\ngive way before this clamour, in spite of its evidences of resistance,\r\nand decree its own dissolution, the elections of a new Legislative\r\nAssembly by that universal suffrage which had once been their idol, and\r\nwas now to be scouted and despised, would inevitably produce what they\r\ntermed a reactionary, and what they suspected might prove, a\r\ncounter-revolutionary and monarchic majority; and they had determined,\r\nin spite of their defeat in June, to attempt another revolution, in the\r\nhope of again surprising the capital by a _coup-de-main_, and seizing\r\nthe reins of power into their own hands at once. This conspiracy was\r\naffiliated together, in its various branches, by those formidable\r\n_sociétés secrètes_, which, long organised, had been again called into\r\nservice by the persevering activity of the party, not only in Paris,\r\nbut in all the larger provincial towns, and for which fresh recruits\r\nhad been zealously drummed together. A general outbreak all over the\r\ncountry was regulated to explode simultaneously on the 29th of January,\r\nor during the following night: that monomania, which has never ceased\r\nto possess the minds of the frantic chiefs of the Red-republican party,\r\nand which still entertains the vain dream that, if they rise, all the\r\nlower classes, or what they call \"the people,\" must rise at their call,\r\nto fight in their wild cause, gave them support in their designs.\r\nPretexts for discontent, at the same time, were not wanting. The\r\nproject of the government for a general suppression of the clubs--a\r\nmeasure which they declared unconstitutional, gave a colour to\r\ndisaffection and revolt; and hopes that fresh allies would join the\r\ninsurrection gave the party a bold confidence, which it had not\r\npossessed since the days of June. The _garde mobile_, in fact, had been\r\ntampered with. The spirit of these young janissaries of the capital,\r\nfor the most part but a year ago the mere _gamins de Paris_, always\r\nvacillating and little to be relied upon, spite of their deeds in June,\r\nhad already been adroitly worked upon by the fostering of that jealousy\r\nwhich subsisted between them and the regular army into a more decided\r\nhatred, when a decree of the government for the reorganisation of the\r\n_corps_ was interpreted by the designing conspirators into an insult\r\noffered to the whole institution, and a preparatory measure to its\r\ntotal dissolution. Such insinuations, carefully fomented among these\r\nyoung troops, led to tumultuous demonstrations of disaffection and\r\ndiscontent. This ferment, so opportune for the designs of the Red\r\nrepublicans, induced them to believe that their hour of struggle and of\r\napproaching triumph was at hand: they counted on their new allies; all\r\nwas ready for the outbreak. But the government was alive to the tempest\r\nrising around it; it was determined to do its duty to the country in\r\n_preventing_ the storm, rather than in suppressing it when once it\r\nshould have broken forth. Hence the military preparations which, on the\r\nmorning of the 29th of January, had once more rendered all Paris a\r\nfortress and a camp; hence the warning sound of the _rappel_, which at\r\nan early hour had once more roused all the citizens from their beds,\r\nand called alarmed faces forth at windows and upon balconies in the\r\ngloom of the dawn; hence the stern commanding words of General\r\nChangarnier, and the orders to the troops and the national guards, that\r\nany man attempting to raise a stone from the streets should be shot\r\nforthwith, and without mercy; hence the consternation with which the\r\noutpost allies of the Red republicans hurried back growling to their\r\nmysterious dens, wherever such may exist. Prevention was considered\r\nbetter than cure, in spite of the misinterpretations and\r\nmisapprehensions to which it might be exposed, and by which it was\r\nsubsequently assailed by the disappointed faction. Arrest then followed\r\nupon arrest; upwards of two hundred of the suspected chiefs of the\r\nconspiracy were hurried off to prison. Among them were former delegates\r\nto the once famous committee of the Luxembourg, whose conduct gave\r\nevidence of the results produced by the dangerous utopian theories set\r\nforth under the lectureship of M. Louis Blanc, and his noble friend the\r\n_soi-disant ouvrier_ Albert. Chiefs of the clubs bore them company in\r\ntheir incarceration; and the ex-Count D'Alton Shee, the _ex-élégant_ of\r\nthe fashionable _salons_ of Paris, but now the socialist-atheist and\r\nanarchist, suffered the same penalty of his actions as leading member\r\nof the club \"_De la Solidarité Républicaine_.\" Turbulent officers of\r\nthe Garde Mobile underwent a similar fate. Even the national guard was\r\nnot spared in the person of one of its superior officers, whose\r\nagitation and over-zealous movements excited suspicion; and, by the\r\nway, in the general summing up, arrest, imprisonment, restriction of\r\nliberty, may also take their place in the row as another little figure\r\nin the total.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy, however, was suppressed; the insurrection failed\r\nentirely for the time; and Paris was told that it might be perfectly\r\nreassured, and doze quietly again upon its pillow, without any fear\r\nthat Red-republicanism should again \"murder sleep.\" But Paris, which\r\nhas not learned yet to recover its old quiet habit of sleeping calmly,\r\nand has got too much fever in its system to close its eyes at will, is\r\nnot to be lulled by such mere sedatives of ministerial assurance. Once\r\nroused in startled hurry from its bed again, and seeing the opiate of\r\nconfidence which was beginning to work its effect in very small doses\r\nsnatched from its grasp, it cannot calm its nerves at once. It will\r\nnot be persuaded that the crisis is over, and has passed away for\r\never; like a child awakened by a nightmare, it looks into all sorts of\r\ndark holes and corners, thinking to see the spectre lurking there. It\r\nknows what it had to expect from the tender mercies of its pitiless\r\nenemies, had they succeeded in their will; what was the _programme_ of\r\na new Red-republican rule--a _comité du salut public_, the _régime_ of\r\nthe _guillotine_, the _épuration_ of suspected aristocrats, the\r\nconfiscation of the property of emigrants, a tax of three _milliards_\r\nupon the rich, a spoliation of all who \"possess,\" the dissolution of\r\nthe national guard, the exclusive possession of all arms by the\r\n_soi-disant_ people, and--but the list of such new-old measures of\r\nultra-republican government would be too long; it is an old tale often\r\ntold, and, after all, only a free translation from the measures of\r\nother times. Paris, then, knows all this; it knows the fanatic and\r\ninexpressible rage of its antagonist, to which the fever of madness\r\nlends strength; it allows itself to be told all sorts of fearful\r\ntales--how Socialists, in imitation of their London brethren, have\r\nhired some thousand apartments in different quarters of the capital,\r\nin order to light a thousand fires at once upon a given signal. It\r\ngoes about repeating the old vague cry--\"_Nous allons avoir quelque\r\nchose_;\" and, however foolishly exaggerated its alarm, the results it\r\nexperiences are the same--again want of confidence arising from\r\nanxiety, again suspension of trade, again a renewal of misery. The\r\nfresh want of confidence, then, with all the attendant evils in its\r\ntrain, may again, as the year of republicanism approaches to its\r\nclose, be taken as another figure in the sum-total that is sought.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this sudden ferment, which has appeared towards the end\r\nof the republican year like a _tableau final_ at the conclusion of an\r\nact of a drama--hastily thrust forward when the interest of the piece\r\nbegan to languish,--how stands the state of parties in that Assembly\r\nwhich, although it is said--and very correctly, it would appear--no\r\nlonger to represent the spirit of the country at large, must still be\r\nconsidered as the great axis of the republic, around which all else\r\nmoves? Always tumultuous, disorderly, and disdainful of those\r\nparliamentary forms which could alone insure it the aspect of a\r\ndignified deliberative body, the National Assembly, as it sees its\r\nlast days inevitably approaching--although it retards its dissolution\r\nby every quack-doctoring means within its grasp--seems to have plunged,\r\nin its throes, into a worse slough of triple confusion, disorder, and\r\nuncertainty than ever. Jealous of its dignity, unwilling to quit its\r\npower, unwilling--say malicious tongues--to quit its profit, and yet\r\npressed upon by that public opinion which it would vainly attempt to\r\ndeny, to misinterpret, or to despise, it has shown itself more\r\nvacillating, capricious, and childish than ever. It wavers, votes\r\nhither and thither, backwards and forwards--now almost inclined to fall\r\ninto the nets spread for it by the ultra-democratic party, that\r\nsupports its resistance against all attempts to dissolve it, and upon\r\nthe point of throwing itself into that party's arms; and now, again,\r\nalarmed at the allies to whom it would unite itself, starting back from\r\ntheir embrace, turning round in its majority, and declaring itself\r\nagainst the sense of its former decisions. Now, it offers an active and\r\nseemingly spiteful opposition to the government; and now, again, it\r\naccepts the first outlet to enable it to turn back upon its course. Now\r\nit is sulky, now alarmed at its own sulkiness; now angry, now begging\r\nits own pardon for its hastiness. It is like a child that does not know\r\nits own mind or temper, and gives way to all the first vagaries that\r\nspring into its childish brain: it neglects the more real interests of\r\nthe country, and loses the country's time in its service, in its\r\neternal interpellations, accusations, recriminations, jealousies,\r\nsuspicions, and offended susceptibilities; it quarrels, scratches,\r\nfights, and breaks its own toys--and all this in the midst of the most\r\ninextricable confusion. To do it justice, the Assembly, as represented\r\nby its wavering majority, is placed between two stools of apprehension,\r\nbetween which it is continually coming to the ground, and making\r\nwofully wry faces: and, between the two, it is not very easy to see how\r\nit should preserve a decent equilibrium. On the one hand, it suspects\r\nthe reactionary, and perhaps counter-revolutionary designs of the\r\nmoderate party on the right, whose chiefs and leaders have chosen to\r\nhold themselves back from any participation in the governmental posts,\r\nwhich they have otherwise coveted and fatally intrigued for, as if they\r\nhad an _arrière-pensée_ of better and more congenial opportunities in\r\nstore, and whose reliance in this respect seems equivocal; and it looks\r\nupon them as monarchists biding their time. On the other hand, it\r\ndreads the _Montagnards_ on the extreme left, with their frantic\r\nexcesses and violent measures, however much it has looked for their\r\nsupport in the momentous question of the dissolution of the Assembly.\r\nIt bears no good-will to the president, whose immense majority in the\r\nelections has been mainly due to the hopes of the anti-republicans that\r\nhis advent might lead to a total change of government: it bears still\r\nless good-will to the ministers of that president's choice. Between its\r\ntwo fears, then, no wonder that it oscillates like a pendulum. The\r\napproach of its final dissolution, which it has at last indefinitely\r\nvoted, and yet endeavours to retard by fresh obligations for remaining,\r\ngives it that character of bitterness which an old coquette may feel\r\nwhen she finds her last hope of conquest slipping indubitably away from\r\nher. Without accusing the majority of that desperate clinging to place\r\nfrom interested motives--which the country, however, is continually\r\ncasting in its teeth--it may be owned that it is not willing to see\r\npower wrested from it, when it fears, upon its return to its\r\nconstituents, it may never find that power placed in its hands again,\r\nand seeks every means of prolonging the fatal hour under the pretence\r\nof serving the best interests of that country to which it fears to\r\nappeal: and to this state of temper, its waspishness, uncertainty, and\r\nincreasing disorder, may be in some degree attributed.\r\n\r\nOf the hopes and designs of the extreme moderate and supposed\r\nreactionary party, little can be said, inasmuch as it has kept its\r\nthoughts to itself, and not permitted itself to give any open\r\nevidences whatever upon the point. But the ardent and impetuous\r\n_Montagnards_ are by no means so cautious: their designs, and hopes,\r\nand fears, have been clearly enough expressed; and they flash forth\r\ncontinually, as lightnings in the midst of the thunder of their\r\nincessant tumult. The allies and representatives, and, if all tales be\r\ntrue, the chiefs of the Red-republican party out of the Assembly--they\r\nstill cherish the hope of establishing an ultra-democratic republican\r\ngovernment, by some means or other--\"by foul if fair should fail\"--a\r\ngovernment of despotic rule by violence--of propagandism by\r\nconstraint--of systematic anarchy. They still form visions of some\r\nfuture Convention of which they may be the heroes--of a parliamentary\r\ntyrannical oligarchy, by which they may enforce their extravagant\r\nopinions. Driven to the most flagrant inconsistencies by their false\r\nposition, they declare themselves also the true and supreme organ--not\r\nonly of those they call \"the people,\" but of the nation at large;\r\nwhile, at the same time, they affect to despise, and they even\r\ndenounce as criminal, the general expression of public opinion, as\r\nevidenced by universal suffrage. They assume the attitudes of\r\n_sauveurs de la patrie_; and in the next breath they declare that\r\n_patrie traitre_ to itself. They vaunt themselves to be the _élus de\r\nla nation_; and they openly express their repugnance to meet again, as\r\ncandidates for the new legislative assembly, that majority of the\r\nnation which they now would drag before the tribunal of republicanism\r\nas counter-revolutionary and reactionary. In short, the only universal\r\nsuffrage to which they would appeal is that of the furious minority of\r\ntheir perverted or hired bands among the dregs of the people. They\r\nhave thus in vain used every effort to prolong to an indefinite\r\nperiod, or even to render permanent, if possible, the existence of\r\nthat Assembly which their own party attacked in May, and which they\r\nthemselves have so often denounced as reactionary. It is the rock of\r\nsalvation upon which they fix their frail anchor of power, in default\r\nof that more solid and elevated foundation for their sway, which they\r\nare well aware can now only be laid for them by the hands of\r\ninsurgents, and cemented by the blood of civil strife in the already\r\nblood-flooded streets of Paris. With the same necessary inconsistency\r\nwhich marks their whole conduct, they fix their hopes of advent to\r\npower upon the overthrow of the Assembly of which they are not\r\nmasters, together with the whole present system of government; while\r\nthey support the principle of the inviolability and immovability of\r\nthat same Assembly, under such circumstances called by them \"the holy\r\nark of the country,\" when a fresh appeal is to be made to the mass of\r\nthe nation at large. During the waverings and vacillations of the\r\nmajority--itself clinging to place and power--they more than once\r\nexpected a triumph for themselves in a declaration of the Assembly's\r\npermanence, with the secret hope, _en arrière pensée_, of finding fair\r\ncause for that insurrection by which alone they would fully profit, if\r\na _coup-de-main_ were to be attempted by the government, in obedience\r\nto the loudly-expressed clamour of popular opinion, to wreck that\r\n\"holy ark\" in which they had embarked their lesser hopes. When,\r\nhowever, they found that the crew were disposed to desert it, on\r\nfeeling the storms of public manifestation blowing too hard against\r\nit--when they found that they themselves must in a few weeks, or at\r\nlatest months, quit its tottering planks, their rage has known no\r\nbounds. Every manoeuvre that can be used to prolong life, by\r\nprolonging even the daily existence of the Assembly, is unscrupulously\r\nput into practice. They clamour, they interrupt discussion--they\r\ndenounce--they produce those daily \"_incidents_\" of French\r\nparliamentary tradition which prevent the progress of parliamentary\r\nbusiness--they invent fresh interpellations, to create further delays\r\nby long-protracted angry quarrel and acrimony. Part of all this system\r\nof denunciation, recrimination, and acrimonious accusation, belongs,\r\nit is true, to their assumed character as the _dramatis personæ_ of an\r\nimaginary Convention. They have their cherished models of old, to copy\r\nwhich is their task, and their glory; the dramatic traditions of the\r\nold Convention are ever in their winds, and are to be followed in\r\nmanner, and even costume, as far as possible. And thus Ledru Rollin,\r\nanother would-be Danton, tosses back his head, and raises his nose\r\naloft, and pulls up his burly form, to thunder forth his angry\r\nRed-republican indignation; and Felix Pyat, the melodramatic\r\ndramatist, of the _boulevard du crime_--fully in his place where\r\nliving dramas, almost as extravagant and ranting as those from his own\r\npen, are to be performed--rolls his large round dark eyes, and swells\r\nhis voice, and shouts, and throws about his arms, after the fashion of\r\nthose melodrama actors for whose noisy declamation he has afforded\r\nsuch good stuff, and because of his picturesque appearance, fancies\r\nhimself, it would seem, a new St Just. And Sarrans, _soi-disant_ \"the\r\nyoung,\" acts after no less melodramatic a fashion, as if in rivalry\r\nfor the parts of _jeune premier_ in the drama, but cannot get beyond\r\nthe airs of a provincial groundling; and Lagrange, with his ferocious\r\nand haggard countenance, and his grizzled long hair and beard, yells\r\nfrom his seat, although in the tribune he affects a milder language\r\nnow, as if to contradict and deny his past deeds. And Proudhon shouts\r\ntoo, although he puts on a benevolent _air patelin_, beneath the\r\nspectacles on his round face, when he proposes his schemes for the\r\ndestruction of the whole fabric of society. And Pierre Leroux, the\r\nfrantic philosopher, shakes his wild greasy mane of hair about his\r\nheavy greasy face, and raves, as ever, discordantly; and old\r\nLammenais, the renegade ex-priest, bends his gloomy head, and snarls\r\nand growls, and utters low imprecations, instead of priestly\r\nblessings, and looks like another Marat, even if he denies the moral\r\nresemblance to its full extent. And Greppo shouts and struggles with\r\nFelix Pyat for the much-desired part of St Just. And gray-bearded\r\nCouthons, who have not even the ardour of youth to excuse their\r\nextravagancies, rise from their curule chairs to toss up their arms,\r\nand howl in chorus. And even Jules Favre, although he belongs not to\r\ntheir party, barks, bites, accuses, and denounces too, all things and\r\nall men, and spits forth venom, as if he was regardless where the\r\nvenom fell, or whom it blistered; and, with his pale, bilious face,\r\nand scrupulously-attired spare form, seems to endeavour to preserve,\r\nas far as he can, in a new republic, the agreeable tradition of\r\nanother Robespierre. And let it not be supposed, that malice or\r\nprejudice attaches to the _Montagnards_ these names. The men of the\r\nlast republican era, whom history has execrated, calumniously and\r\nunjustly they will say, are their heroes and their demi-gods; the sage\r\nlegislators, whose principles they vaunt as those of republican\r\ncivilisation and humanity; the models whom they avowedly, and with a\r\nconfessed air of ambition, aspire to copy in word and deed. Part,\r\nhowever, of the systematic confusion, which it is their evident aim to\r\nintroduce into the deliberations of the Assembly, is, in latter days,\r\nto be attributable to their desire to create delays, and lead to\r\nepisodical discussions of angry quarrel and recrimination, which may\r\nprolong the convulsive existence of the Assembly to an indefinite\r\nperiod, or by which they may profit to forward their own designs. Thus\r\nthe day is rare, as a ray of sunshine in a permanent equinoctial\r\nstorm, when the _Montagnards_ do not start from their seats, upon the\r\nfaintest pretext for discontent or accusation of reactionary\r\ntendencies; and, either _en masse_ or individually, fulminate,\r\ngesticulate, clamour, shout, denounce, and threaten. The thunder upon\r\nthe \"Mountain's\" brow is incessant: if it does not burst forth in\r\nheavy peals, it never ceases to growl. Each _Montagnard_ is a Jupiter\r\nin his own conceit, and hurls his thunderbolt with what force he may.\r\nNot a word can be spoken by a supposed reactionary orator without a\r\nmurmur--not a phrase completed without a shout of denegation, a\r\ntorrent of interruptions, or peeling bursts of ironical laughter. The\r\n\"Mountain\" is in perpetual labour; but its produce bears more\r\nresemblance to a yelping pack of hungry blood-hounds, than to an\r\ninnocent mouse: it is in perpetual movement; and, like crushing\r\navalanches from its summit, rush down its most energetic members to\r\nthe tribune, to attempt to crush the Assembly by vehemence and\r\nviolence of language. These scenes of systematic tumult have\r\nnecessarily increased in force, since the boiling spite of\r\ndisappointment has flowed over in hot reality, in place of the\r\naffected and acted indignation: the rage and agitation no longer know\r\nthe least control. The affair of the abolition of the clubs had\r\nscarcely lent an excellent pretext for this violence, when the\r\nsuppression of the insurrection, and the arrests consequent upon the\r\ndiscomfiture of the conspiracy on the 29th of January, gave a wide\r\nfield for the exercise of the system of denunciation commonly pursued.\r\nTo be beforehand with accusation by counter-accusation, has been\r\nalways the tactics of the party: when the party-chiefs find themselves\r\ninvolved in the suspicion of subversive attempts, they begin the\r\nattack. The _Montagnards_ have burst forth, then, to declare that the\r\nmilitary precautions were a systematic provocation on the part of the\r\nministry and General Changarnier, to incite the population of Paris to\r\ncivil discord; that the only conspiracy existed in the government\r\nitself, to suppress liberty and overthrow the republic--at least to\r\ncast a slur upon the only true republicans, and have an excuse for\r\ntyrannical oppression towards them. They closed their eyes to the fact\r\nthat the insurrection, of the proposed reality of which no doubt can\r\nremain, spite of these angry denegations, would have produced a crisis\r\nto which the real reactionary anti-republicans looked as one that\r\n_must_ produce a change in the detested government of the country,\r\nshould the moderate party triumph in the struggle, as was probable;\r\nand that by the suppression of the insurrection the crisis was\r\naverted, and the republic evidently consolidated for a time, not\r\nweakened. With their usual inconsistency, and want of logical\r\ndeduction, at the same time that they accused the minister of a\r\nuseless and provocative display of the military force, they denounced\r\nthe conspiracy as real, but as proceeding from \"infamous royalists,\"\r\nand not anarchist Red republicans. And then, to follow up this\r\npell-mell of self-contradictions--while, on the one hand, they denied\r\nany insurrectionary movement at all, and, on the other, attributed it\r\nto royalists--they called, in their language at the rostrum, the\r\ncommencement of the street demonstration on the morning of the 29th of\r\nJanuary--which could not be denied, and which had come down as usual\r\nfrom the faubourgs, ever ripe for tumult--\"the sublime manifestation\r\nof the heroic people.\" Propositions couched in furious language, for\r\n\"_enquêtes parlementaires_,\" and for the \"_mise en accusation des\r\nministres_\"--every possible means of denunciation and intimidation\r\nwere employed, to increase the agitated hurly-burly of the Assembly,\r\nand subvert, as far as was possible, the few frail elements of order\r\nand of confidence that still subsisted in it. In marking thus, in\r\nhasty traits, the position of parties in the Assembly, called together\r\nto establish and consolidate the republic upon a basis of peace and\r\norder, what are the figures which are so noted down as forming part of\r\nthe sum-total, as the approaching conclusion of the revolutionary year\r\nis about to make up its accounts? As regards the Assembly, increased\r\nconfusion, disunion, bitter conflict of exasperated parties,\r\nsuspicion, mistrust, disaffection, violence.\r\n\r\nHow stands the government of the country after the year's\r\nrepublicanism? At its head is the Republican President, elected by the\r\nimmense majority of the country, but elected upon a deceptive\r\nbasis--elected neither for his principles, which were doubtful; nor\r\nfor his qualities, which were unknown or supposed to be null; nor even\r\nfor his name, (although much error has been founded upon the subject,)\r\nwhich, after all, dazzled only a comparatively small minority--but\r\nbecause he was supposed to represent the principle opposed to\r\nrepublicanism--opposed to the very _régime_ he was elected to\r\nsupport--opposed to that spirit of which the man who had once saved\r\nthe country from anarchy, and had once received the country's\r\nblessings, was considered to be the type--because hopes were founded\r\non his advent of a change in a system of government uncongenial, and\r\neven hateful, to the mass of the nation; whether by the _prestige_ of\r\nhis name he attempted to re-establish an empire, or whether, as\r\nanother Monk, he formed only a stepping-stone for a new monarch.\r\nElected thus upon false principles, the head of the government stands\r\nin an eminently false position. He may have shown himself moderate;\r\ninclined to support the republic upon that \"honest\" basis which the\r\nbetter-thinking republicans demand; firm in the support of a cabinet,\r\nthe measures of which he approves; and every way sincere and\r\nstraightforward, although not in all his actions wise: but his\r\nposition remains the same--placed between the ambitious hope of a\r\nparty which might almost be said to exist no longer, and which has\r\nbecome that only of a family and a few old adherents and connexions,\r\nbut which attempts to dazzle a country vain and proud of the word\r\n\"glory,\" like France, by the somewhat tarnished glitter of a name, and\r\nthe prospect of another which calls itself legitimate;--the _point de\r\nmire_ of the army, but, at the same time, the stalking-horse of a\r\nnation miserably wearied with the present hobby, upon which it has\r\nbeen forced unwillingly to ride, with about as much pleasure and\r\n_aplomb_ as the famous tailor of Brentford--and, on the other hand,\r\nsuspected, accused, and denounced by those who claim to themselves the\r\nonly true and pure essence of veritable republicanism. It is a\r\nposition placed upon a \"see-saw\"--placed in the centre, it is true,\r\nbut liable, in any convulsive crisis, to be seriously compromised by\r\nthe violent and abrupt elevation of either of the ends of the plank,\r\nas it tosses up and down: for the feet of the president, instead of\r\ndirecting the movements of this perpetually agitated \"see-saw,\" and\r\ngiving the necessary steadiness, without which the whole present\r\nrepublican balance must be overturned, seem more destined to slip\r\nhither and thither in the struggle, at the imminent risk of losing all\r\nequilibrium, and slipping off the plank altogether. As yet, the\r\npresident, whenever he appears in public, is followed by shouting and\r\nadmiring crowds, who run by his horse, clap their hands, call upon his\r\nname, greet him with noisy cries of \"_vive_,\" grasp his hands, and of\r\ncourse present some hundreds of petitions; but these demonstrations of\r\nrespect must be attributed far less to personal consideration, or\r\npopular affection, or even to the _prestige_ of the name of Napoleon,\r\nthan to the eagerness of the Parisian public, even of the lowest\r\nclasses--spite of all that may be said of their sentiments by their\r\nwould-be leaders, the ultra-democrats--to salute with acclamation the\r\npersonage who represents a head, a chief, a _point d'appui\r\nquelconque_--a leading staff, a guiding star, a unity, instead of a\r\ndisorderly body--in one word, a resemblance of royalty. It is the\r\n_president_, and not the _man_, who is thus greeted. The usual\r\ncuriosity and love of show and parade of the Parisian _badauds_, at\r\nleast as \"cockney\" as the famed Londoner, may be much mixed up again\r\nin all this, but the sentiment remains the same; nor do these\r\ndemonstrations alter the position of the man who stands at the head of\r\nthe government of France. The ministry, supported in _principle_ by\r\nthe country, although not from any personal respect or liking, stands\r\nin opposition to an Assembly, elected by that country, but no longer\r\nrepresenting it. The army shows itself inclined to protect the\r\ngovernment, on the one hand, and is said to be ready, on the other, to\r\nfollow in the cry of \"_vive l'Empereur!_\" should that cry be raised.\r\nThe _garde mobile_, although modified by its late reorganisation, is\r\nsuspected of versatility and unsoundness, if not exactly of\r\ndisaffection: it stands in instant collision with the dislike and\r\njealousy of the army, and, spite of its courageous part in June, is\r\nlooked upon askance by the lovers of order. What aspect, then, have\r\nthe figures which may be supposed to represent all this in the\r\nsum-total of the year's republicanism? They bear the forms of\r\ninstability, suspicion, doubt, collision, want of confidence in the\r\nfuture, and all the evils attendant upon the uncertainty of a state of\r\nthings which, spite of assurances, and spite of efforts, the greater\r\npart of France seems inclined to look upon merely as provisionary.\r\n\r\nUnder what form, then, does the public spirit exhibit itself in\r\ncircumstances of so much doubt and instability? The attitude of the\r\nworking classes in general, of the very great majority, in fact--for\r\nthose still swayed by the delusive arguments, and still more delusive\r\nand destructive promises of the Socialists and Republicans are\r\ncomparatively few, although formidable in the ferocity of their\r\ndoctrines and their plans, and in the active restlessness of their\r\nfeverish and excited energies, which resemble the reckless,\r\nsleepless, activity of the madman--the attitude of the working classes\r\nin Paris is calm, and even expectant; but calm from utter\r\nweariness--calm from the convictions, founded on the saddest\r\nexperience, in the wretched results of further revolutions--calm from\r\na sort of prostrate resignation, and almost despair, in the midst of\r\nthe miseries and privations which the last fatal year has increased\r\ninstead of diminishing, and written with a twofold scourge upon their\r\nbacks: an attitude reassuring, inasmuch as it implies hatred and\r\nopposition to the subversive doctrines of the anarchists, but not\r\nwithout its dangers, and, to say the least, heartrending and\r\nafflicting--and expectant in the hope and conviction of change in the\r\ncause of stability and order. The feeling which, after a few months of\r\nthe rule of a reckless provisionary government, was the prevailing one\r\namong the _majority_ of the working classes--the feeling, which has\r\nbeen already noted, that king Log, or even king Stork, or any other\r\nconcentrated power that would represent stability and order, would be\r\npreferable to the uncertainties of a vacillating republican rule--has\r\never gained ground among them since those hopes of re-established\r\nconfidence, and a consequent amelioration of their wretched position,\r\nwhich they first founded upon the meeting of the National Assembly,\r\nand then upon the election of a president, have twice deceived them,\r\nand left them almost as wretched as ever in the stagnation of trade\r\nand commercial affairs. The feeling thus prevalent among the working\r\nclasses in the capital, is, at the same time, the feeling of the\r\ncountry at large, but to an even far wider extent, and more openly\r\nexpressed. The hatred of the departments to Paris, as the chief seat\r\nof revolution and disorder, has also increased rather than diminished;\r\nand everywhere the sentiments of utter weariness, disaffection to the\r\nRepublic, and impatience under a system of government of which they\r\nare no longer inclined to await the promised blessings, are displayed\r\nupon all possible occasions, and by every possible organ. The upper\r\nclasses among moneyed men, and landed proprietors, remain quiet and\r\nhold their tongue. They may be expectant and desirous of change also,\r\nbut they show no open impatience, for _they can afford to wait_. It is\r\nthey, on the contrary, who more generally express their opinions in\r\nthe _possibility_ of the establishment of a prosperous republic--a\r\npossibility which the working classes in their impatience deny. In\r\nspite of all that ultra-democratic journals may say, in their raving\r\ndenunciations, borrowed of the language of another Republic, some of\r\nthe most eager and decided of those they term \"reactionary,\" and\r\ndenounce as \"aristocrats,\" are thus to be found among the lower\r\nworking classes. To do justice to the truth of the accusations brought\r\nby the Red republican party, in another respect, it is in the\r\n_bourgeois_ spirit that is to be found the strongest and most openly\r\navowed reactionary feeling. It is impossible to enter any shop of the\r\nbetter order in Paris, and speak upon the position of affairs, without\r\nhearing not only the hope, but the expectation openly expressed, of a\r\nmonarchic restoration, and that restoration in favour of the elder\r\nbranch of the Bourbons. The feeling is universal in this class: the\r\nname of \"Henri V.,\" scarce mentioned at all, and never under this\r\ntitle, during the reign of Louis Philippe, except in the exclusive\r\ncircles of the Faubourg St Germain, is now in every shopkeeper's\r\nmouth. Louis Philippe, the Regency, all the members of the Orleans\r\nfamily, the Empire, a Bonapartist rule--all are set aside in the minds\r\nof these classes for the now-desired idol of their fickle choice, the\r\nDuke of Bordeaux. In these classes a restoration in favour of Henri V.\r\nis no longer a question of possibility; it is a mere question of time:\r\nit is not \"_L'aurons-nous?_\" that they ask; it is \"_Quand\r\nl'aurons-nous?_\" In this respect the real and true republicans, in the\r\n\"honest\" designation of the term, have certainly every reason to raise\r\nan angry clamour; if sedition to the existing _régime_ of the country\r\nis not openly practised, it is, at all events, openly and generally\r\nexpressed. Nor are their accusations brought against the government\r\nentirely without justice; for while, on the one hand, a measure of a\r\nnature altogether arbitrary, under the freedom of a republican rule,\r\nis exercised against a well-known artist, by seizing in his _atelier_\r\nthe portraits of the Duke of Bordeaux, or, as he is called, the Count\r\nof Chambord, and of the Countess, as seditiously exhibited,\r\nlithographed likenesses of the Bourbon heir are to be seen on all\r\nsides at print-shop windows, and in popular temporary print-stalls; in\r\ngalleries, arcades, and upon street walls; in _vignettes_, upon\r\nballads, with such titles, as \"_Dieu le veut_,\" or \"_La France le\r\nveut_,\" or in busts of all dimensions. Again, the _Henri-quinquiste_\r\nfeeling, as it is called, is universal among the fickle _bourgeoisie_\r\nof Paris--the rock upon which Louis Philippe founded his throne, and\r\nwhich sank under him in his hour of need: and the _bourgeois_, eager\r\nand confident in their hopes, wilfully shut their eyes to the fact\r\nthat, were their detested republic overthrown, there might arise\r\nfuture convulsions, and future civil strife, between a Bonapartist\r\nfaction--which necessarily grows, and increases, and flourishes more\r\nand more under the rule, however temporary, of a chief of the\r\nname--and the legitimist party: for the Orleanists, whether fused by a\r\ncompromise of their hopes with the Legitimists, as has been said, or\r\nfallen into the obscurity of forgetfulness or indifference in the\r\nmajority of the nation, hold forth no decided banner at the present\r\nmoment. In regarding, then, the public spirit among the majority of\r\nall classes in Paris, without consulting the still more reactionary\r\nfeeling of the departments, the figures to be added to the sum-total\r\nof the year's republican account will be again found similar to those\r\nalready enumerated, in the shape of disaffection, abhorrence of the\r\nrepublican government, want of confidence in its stability,\r\nexpectation and hope of a change, however it may come, and although it\r\nmay be brought about by a convulsion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the uncertainty and anxiety are increased by the continued\r\nexpectation of some approaching crisis, which the explosion of the\r\ninsurrection, destined for the 29th of January, would have hastened,\r\nand which the precautions taken for the suppression of the outbreak\r\nhave evidently averted for the time. But what confidence can be\r\nexpressed in the stability of this temporary state of order in a\r\ncountry so full of excitement and love of change, and in a state of\r\ncontinual revolution, in which such conspiracy ceases not to work in\r\ndarkness, with the hope of attaining despotic power, and in which\r\ndisaffection to the state of things is openly expressed? Events have\r\nrun their course with such fearful rapidity, and the unexpected has\r\nbeen so greatly the \"order of the day,\" in the last year's history of\r\nFrance, that who can answer for the future of the next months, or even\r\nweeks? Political prophets have long since thrown up the trade of\r\noracle-giving in despair; and the tripod of the oracle has been left\r\nto the occupation of the chances of the _imprévu_. In spite, then, of\r\nthe temporary reassurance of peace given by the last measures of the\r\ngovernment, which have been denounced by the ultra-democrats as\r\narbitrary, subversive, and unconstitutional, the underground agitation\r\nstill continues. Paris dances once more, repeating to itself, however,\r\nthe often-repeated words, \"_Nous dansons sur un volcan_.\" The carnival\r\npursues its noisy pleasures, under the protection of the forests of\r\nbayonets that are continually glittering along the gay sunlit streets,\r\nand to the sound of the drum of the marching military, who still give\r\nParis the aspect of a garrison in time of war. Gay _salons_ are\r\nopened, and carriages again rattle along the streets on moonlit\r\nnights; but the spirit of Parisian gaiety reposes not upon confidence,\r\nand is but the practical application of the epicurean philosophy that\r\ntakes for its maxim, \"_Carpe diem_.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the reality of an approaching crisis, which, however\r\nfeeble the symptoms at present, the Parisians insist upon regarding as\r\nnear at hand,--whatever may be the hopes of some that the crisis,\r\nhowever convulsive, must produce a desired change, and the fears of\r\nothers of the civil strife,--whatever thus the desires of the\r\nsanguine, the expectations of the hopeful, the apprehensions of the\r\npeaceful, and the terrors of the timorous, the result is still the\r\nsame--the uncertainty, the want of confidence, the evils attendant\r\nupon this feeling of instability, so often already enumerated. The\r\nviolence and struggling rage of the ultra-democratic and socialist\r\njournals, increasing in denunciation to the death, and positively\r\nconvulsive in their rage, as the anti-republican reactionary spirit\r\ngrows, and spreads wider, and every day takes firmer root, and even\r\ndares to blossom openly in the expression of public opinion, are\r\nlooked upon as the throes of dying agony by the bold, but are regarded\r\nwith dread by the less courageous, who know the force of the party's\r\nexaggerated violence, and have already felt the miseries of their\r\nfanatic subversive attempts. Meanwhile, the moderate or honest\r\nrepublic, which vainly attempts a _juste milieu_ of republicanism,\r\nbetween extravagance and disaffection, limps sadly forwards; or, as\r\none of the late satirical pieces, which openly attack the republic on\r\nthe stage, expresses it--amidst the applause and shouts of deriding\r\nlaughter, which hail it nightly in crowded houses, not so much from\r\nthe boxes as from the galleries thronged with types of the\r\n\"people\"--\"_Elle boîte! elle boîte!_\" Republicans may thus clamour\r\nagainst the culpable laxity of a government, which permits these\r\nmuch-applauded attacks upon the Republic, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of freedom of opinion, and in pursuance of the abolition of\r\na theatrical censorship which they themselves condemned: but so it is;\r\nand therein may be sought and found one of the strongest popular\r\nevidences of popular disaffection. And satires too, and caricatures,\r\nabound, in which the unhappy Republic is still more soundly\r\nscourged--demonstrations not less lively, although they call not forth\r\nthe evident approbation of a congregated multitude. Now, then, that\r\nthe revolutionary year has almost closed there--now that the\r\nanniversary of the days of February is at hand--let people take the\r\nfigures enumerated, and justly enumerated, as they will, and place\r\nthem as they fancy in the sum-total, and cast them up as they please,\r\nor deduce what value they may from the amount of the first year of new\r\nrepublicanism in France. Another question. What _fêtes_ are to greet\r\nthe anniversaries of the \"glorious\" days of the \"glorious\" revolution\r\nwhich established a \"glorious\" Republic? Assuredly the _fête_ will not\r\nbe in the people's hearts: no, not even in the hearts of those whom\r\ntheir mis-named, self-appointed friends choose to call, _par\r\nexcellence_, \"the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAXTONS--PART XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nThe next day, on the outside of the Cambridge Telegraph, there was one\r\npassenger who ought to have impressed his fellow-travellers with a\r\nvery respectful idea of his lore in the dead languages; for not a\r\nsingle syllable, in a live one, did he vouchsafe to utter from the\r\nmoment he ascended that \"bad eminence,\" to the moment in which he\r\nregained his mother earth. \"Sleep,\" says honest Sancho, \"covers a man\r\nbetter than a cloak.\" I am ashamed of thee, honest Sancho! thou art a\r\nsad plagiarist; for Tibullus said pretty nearly the same thing before\r\nthee,--\r\n\r\n    \"Te somnus fusco velavit amictu.\"[4]\r\n\r\nBut is not silence as good a cloak as sleep?--does it not wrap a man\r\nround with as offusc and impervious a fold? Silence--what a world it\r\ncovers!--what busy schemes--what bright hopes and dark fears--what\r\nambition, or what despair! Do you ever see a man in any society\r\nsitting mute for hours, and not feel an uneasy curiosity to penetrate\r\nthe wall he thus builds up between others and himself? Does he not\r\ninterest you far more than the brilliant talker at your left--the airy\r\nwit at your right, whose shafts fall in vain on the sullen barrier of\r\nthe silent man! Silence, dark sister of Nox and Erebus, how, layer\r\nupon layer, shadow upon shadow, blackness upon blackness, thou\r\nstretchest thyself from hell to heaven, over thy two chosen\r\nhaunts--man's heart and the grave!\r\n\r\nSo, then, wrapped in my greatcoat and my silence, I performed my\r\njourney; and on the evening of the second day I reached the\r\nold-fashioned brick house. How shrill on my ears sounded the bell! How\r\nstrange and ominous to my impatience seemed the light gleaming across\r\nthe windows of the hall! How my heart beat as I watched the face of\r\nthe servant who opened the gate to my summons!\r\n\r\n\"All well?\" cried I.\r\n\r\n\"All well, sir,\" answered the servant, cheerfully. \"Mr Squills,\r\nindeed, is with master, but I don't think there is anything the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nBut now my mother appeared at the threshold, and I was in her arms.\r\n\r\n\"Sisty, Sisty!--my dear, dear son!--beggared, perhaps--and my\r\nfault,--mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours!--come into this room, out of hearing--your fault?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!--for if I had had no brother, or if I had not been led\r\naway,--if I had, as I ought, entreated poor Austin not to--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dearest mother, _you_ accuse yourself for what, it seems,\r\nwas my uncle's misfortune--I am sure not even his fault! (I made a\r\ngulp _there_.) No, lay the fault on the right shoulders--the defunct\r\nshoulders of that horrible progenitor, William Caxton the printer;\r\nfor, though I don't yet know the particulars of what has happened, I\r\nwill lay a wager it is connected with that fatal invention of\r\nprinting. Come, come,--my father is well, is he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you too, and I, and Roland, and little Blanche! Why then, you are\r\nright to thank Heaven, for your true treasures are untouched. But sit\r\ndown and explain, pray.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot explain. I do not understand anything more than that he, my\r\nbrother,--mine!--has involved Austin in--in--\" (a fresh burst of\r\ntears.)\r\n\r\nI comforted, scolded, laughed, preached, and adjured in a breath; and\r\nthen, drawing my mother gently on, entered my father's study.\r\n\r\nAt the table was seated Mr Squills, pen in hand, and a glass of his\r\nfavourite punch by his side. My father was standing on the hearth, a\r\nshade more pale; but with a resolute expression on his countenance,\r\nwhich was new to its indolent thoughtful mildness! He lifted his eyes\r\nas the door opened, and then, putting his finger to his lips, as he\r\nglanced towards my mother, he said gaily, \"No great harm done. Don't\r\nbelieve her! Women always exaggerate, and make realities of their own\r\nbugbears: it is the vice of their lively imaginations, as Wierus has\r\nclearly shown in accounting for the marks, moles, and hare-lips which\r\nthey inflict upon their innocent infants before they are even born. My\r\ndear boy,\" added my father, as I here kissed him and smiled in his\r\nface, \"I thank you for that smile! God bless you!\" He wrung my hand,\r\nand turned a little aside.\r\n\r\n\"It is a great comfort,\" renewed my father, after a short pause, \"to\r\nknow, when a misfortune happens, that it could not be helped. Squills\r\nhas just discovered that I have no bump of cautiveness; so that,\r\ncraniologically speaking, if I had escaped one imprudence, I should\r\ncertainly have run my head against another.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man with your development is made to be taken in,\" said Mr Squills,\r\nconsolingly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that, my own Kitty! and have you the heart to blame Jack\r\nany longer--a poor creature cursed with a bump that would take in the\r\nStock Exchange? And can any one resist his bump, Squills?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said the surgeon authoritatively.\r\n\r\n\"Sooner or later it must involve him in its airy meshes--eh, Squills?\r\nentrap him into its fatal cerebral cell. There his fate waits him,\r\nlike the ant-lion in its pit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too true,\" quoth Squills. \"What a phrenological lecturer you would\r\nhave made!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, my love,\" said my father, \"and lay no blame but on this\r\nmelancholy cavity of mine, where cautiveness--is not! Go, and let\r\nSisty have some supper; for Squills says that he has a fine\r\ndevelopment of the mathematical organs, and we want his help. We are\r\nhard at work on figures, Pisistratus.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother looked broken-hearted, and, obeying submissively, stole to\r\nthe door without a word. But as she reached the threshold she turned\r\nround, and beckoned to me to follow her.\r\n\r\nI whispered to my father, and went out. My mother was standing in the\r\nhall, and I saw by the lamp that she had dried her tears; and that her\r\nface, though very sad, was more composed.\r\n\r\n\"Sisty,\" she said, in a low voice which struggled to be firm, \"promise\r\nme that you will tell me all,--the worst, Sisty. They keep it from me,\r\nand that is my hardest punishment; for when I don't know all that\r\nhe--that Austin suffers, it seems to me as if I had lost his heart.\r\nOh, Sisty! My child, my child, don't fear me! I shall be happy\r\nwhatever befalls us, if I once get back my privilege--my privilege,\r\nSisty, to comfort, to share!--do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, my mother! And with your good sense, and clear woman's\r\nwit, if you will but feel how much we want them, you will be the best\r\ncounsellor we could have. So never fear, you and I will have no\r\nsecrets.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother kissed me, and went away with a less heavy step.\r\n\r\nAs I re-entered, my father came across the room and embraced me.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" he said in a faltering voice, \"if your modest prospects in\r\nlife are ruined--\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, father, can you think of me at such a moment! Me!--Is it\r\npossible to ruin the young, and strong, and healthy! Ruin me, with\r\nthese thews and sinews!--ruin me, with the education you have given\r\nme--thews and sinews of the mind! Oh no! there, Fortune is harmless!\r\nAnd you forget, sir,--the saffron bag!\"\r\n\r\nSquills leapt up, and, wiping his eyes with one hand, gave me a\r\nsounding slap on the shoulder with the other.\r\n\r\n\"I am proud of the care I took of your infancy, Master Caxton. That\r\ncomes of strengthening the digestive organs in early childhood. Such\r\nsentiments are a proof of magnificent ganglions in a perfect state of\r\norder. When a man's tongue is as smooth as I am sure yours is, he\r\nslips through misfortune like an eel.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed outright, my father smiled faintly; and seating myself, I\r\ndrew towards me a paper filled with Squills' memoranda, and said, \"Now\r\nto find the unknown quantity. What on earth is this? 'Supposed value\r\nof books, £750.' Oh, father! this is impossible. I was prepared for\r\nanything but that. Your books--they are your life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said my father; \"after all, they are the offending party in\r\nthis case, and so ought to be the principal victims. Besides, I\r\nbelieve I know most of them by heart. But, in truth, we are only\r\nentering all our effects, to be sure (added my father proudly) that,\r\ncome what may, we are not dishonoured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humour him,\" whispered Squills; \"we will save the Books.\" Then he\r\nadded aloud, as he laid finger and thumb on my pulse, \"One, two,\r\nthree, about seventy--capital pulse--soft and full--he can bear the\r\nwhole: let us administer it.\"\r\n\r\nMy father nodded--\"Certainly. But, Pisistratus, we must manage your\r\ndear mother. Why she should think of blaming herself, because poor\r\nJack took wrong ways to enrich us, I cannot understand. But, as I have\r\nhad occasion before to remark, Sphinx and Enigma are nouns feminine.\"\r\n\r\nMy poor father! that was a vain struggle for thy wonted innocent\r\nhumour. The lips quivered.\r\n\r\nThen the story came out. It seems that, when it was resolved to\r\nundertake the publication of the _Literary Times_, a certain number of\r\nshareholders had been got together by the indefatigable energies of\r\nUncle Jack; and, in the deed of association and partnership, my\r\nfather's name figured conspicuously as the holder of a fourth of this\r\njoint property. If in this my father had committed some imprudence, he\r\nhad at least done nothing that, according to the ordinary calculations\r\nof a secluded student, could become ruinous. But, just at the time\r\nwhen we were in the hurry of leaving town, Jack had represented to my\r\nfather that it might be necessary to alter a little the plan of the\r\npaper; and, in order to allure a larger circle of readers, touch\r\nsomewhat on the more vulgar news and interests of the day. A change of\r\nplan might involve a change of title; and he suggested to my father\r\nthe expediency of leaving the smooth hands of Mr Tibbets altogether\r\nunfettered, as to the technical name and precise form of the\r\npublication. To this my father had unwittingly assented, on hearing\r\nthat the other shareholders would do the same. Mr Peck, a printer of\r\nconsiderable opulence, and highly respectable name, had been found to\r\nadvance the sum necessary for the publication of the earlier numbers,\r\nupon the guarantee of the said act of partnership, and the additional\r\nsecurity of my father's signature to a document, authorising Mr\r\nTibbets to make any change in the form or title of the periodical that\r\nmight be judged advisable, concurrent with the consent of the other\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\nNow it seems that Mr Peck had, in his previous conferences with Mr\r\nTibbets, thrown much cold water on the idea of the _Literary Times_,\r\nand had suggested something that should \"catch the moneyed\r\npublic,\"--the fact being, as was afterwards discovered, that the\r\nprinter, whose spirit of enterprise was congenial to Uncle Jack's, had\r\nshares in three or four speculations, to which he was naturally glad\r\nof an opportunity to invite the attention of the public. In a word, no\r\nsooner was my poor father's back turned than the _Literary Times_ was\r\ndropped incontinently, and Mr Peck and Mr Tibbets began to concentre\r\ntheir luminous notions into that brilliant and comet-like apparition\r\nwhich ultimately blazed forth under the title of _The Capitalist_.\r\n\r\nFrom this change of enterprise the more prudent and responsible of the\r\noriginal shareholders had altogether withdrawn. A majority, indeed,\r\nwere left; but the greater part of those were shareholders of that\r\nkind most amenable to the influences of Uncle Jack, and willing to be\r\nshareholders in anything, since as yet they were possessors of\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAssured of my father's responsibility, the adventurous Peck put plenty\r\nof spirit into the first launch of _The Capitalist_. All the walls\r\nwere placarded with its announcements; circular advertisements ran\r\nfrom one end of of the kingdom to the other. Agents were engaged,\r\ncorrespondents levied _en masse_. The invasion of Xerxes on the Greeks\r\nwas not more munificently provided for than that of _The Capitalist_\r\nupon the credulity and avarice of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut as Providence bestows upon fishes the instrument of fins, whereby\r\nthey balance and direct their movements, however rapid and erratic,\r\nthrough the pathless deeps, so to the cold-blooded creatures of our\r\nown species--that may be classed under the genus MONEY-MAKERS--the\r\nsame protective power accords the fin-like properties of prudence and\r\ncaution, wherewith your true money-getter buoys and guides himself\r\nmajestically through the great seas of speculation. In short, the\r\nfishes the net was cast for were all scared from the surface at the\r\nfirst splash. They came round and smelt at the mesh with their shark\r\nbottle-noses, and then, plying those invaluable fins, made off as fast\r\nas they could--plunging into the mud--hiding themselves under rocks\r\nand coral banks. Metaphor apart, the capitalists buttoned up their\r\npockets, and would have nothing to say to their namesake.\r\n\r\nNot a word of this change, so abhorrent to all the notions of poor\r\nAugustine Caxton, had been breathed to him by Peck or Tibbets. He ate,\r\nand slept, and worked at the great Book, occasionally wondering why he\r\nhad not heard of the advent of the _Literary Times_, unconscious of\r\nall the awful responsibilities which _The Capitalist_ was entailing on\r\nhim;--knowing no more of _The Capitalist_ than he did of the last loan\r\nof the Rothschilds.\r\n\r\nDifficult was it for all other human nature, save my father's, not to\r\nbreathe an indignant anathema on the scheming head of the\r\nbrother-in-law who had thus violated the most sacred obligations of\r\ntrust and kindred, and so entangled an unsuspecting recluse. But, to\r\ngive even Jack Tibbets his due, he had firmly convinced himself that\r\n_The Capitalist_ would make my father's fortune; and if he did not\r\nannounce to him the strange and anomalous development into which the\r\noriginal sleeping chrysalis of the _Literary Times_ had taken\r\nportentous wing, it was purely and wholly in the knowledge that my\r\nfather's \"prejudices,\" as he termed them, would stand in the way of his\r\nbecoming a Croesus. And, in fact, Uncle Jack had believed so heartily\r\nin his own project, that he had put himself thoroughly into Mr Peck's\r\npower, signed bills in his own name to some fabulous amount, and was\r\nactually now in the Fleet, whence his penitential and despairing\r\nconfession was dated, arriving simultaneously with a short letter from\r\nMr Peck, wherein that respectable printer apprised my father that he\r\nhad continued, at his own risk, the publication of _The Capitalist_, as\r\nfar as a prudent care for his family would permit; that he need not say\r\nthat a new daily journal was a very vast experiment; that the expense\r\nof such a paper as _The Capitalist_ was immeasurably greater than that\r\nof a mere literary periodical, as originally suggested; and that now,\r\nbeing constrained to come upon the shareholders for the sums he had\r\nadvanced, amounting to several thousands, he requested my father to\r\nsettle with him immediately--delicately implying that he himself might\r\nsettle as he could with the other shareholders, most of whom, he\r\ngrieved to add, he had been misled by Mr Tibbets into believing to be\r\nmen of substance, when in reality they were men of straw!\r\n\r\nNor was this all the evil. The \"Great Anti-Bookseller Publishing\r\nSociety,\"--which had maintained a struggling existence--evinced by\r\nadvertisements of sundry forthcoming works of solid interest and\r\nenduring nature, wherein, out of a long list, amidst a pompous array\r\nof \"Poems;\" \"Dramas not intended for the Stage;\" \"Essays by\r\nPhileutheros, Philanthropos, Philopolis, Philodemus, and Philalethes,\"\r\nstood prominently forth \"The History of Human Error, Vols. I. and II.,\r\nquarto, with illustrations,\"--the \"Anti-Bookseller Society,\" I say,\r\nthat had hitherto evinced nascent and budding life by these\r\nexfoliations from its slender stem, died of a sudden blight, the\r\nmoment its sun, in the shape of Uncle Jack, set in the Cimmerian\r\nregions of the Fleet; and a polite letter from another printer (O\r\nWilliam Caxton, William Caxton!--fatal progenitor!) informing my\r\nfather of this event, stated complimentarily that it was to him, \"as\r\nthe most respectable member of the Association,\" that the said printer\r\nwould be compelled to look for expenses incurred, not only in the very\r\ncostly edition of the History of Human Error, but for those incurred\r\nin the print and paper devoted to \"Poems,\" \"Dramas, not intended for\r\nthe stage,\" \"Essays by Phileutheros, Philanthropos, Philopolis,\r\nPhilodemus, and Philalethes,\" with sundry other works, no doubt of a\r\nvery valuable nature, but in which a considerable loss, in a pecuniary\r\npoint of view, must be necessarily expected.\r\n\r\nI own that, as soon as I had mastered the above agreeable facts, and\r\nascertained from Mr Squills that my father really did seem to have\r\nrendered himself legally liable to these demands, I leant back in my\r\nchair, stunned and bewildered.\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" said my father, \"that as yet we are contending with\r\nmonsters in the dark--in the dark all monsters look larger and uglier.\r\nEven Augustus Cæsar, though certainly he had never scrupled to make as\r\nmany ghosts as suited his convenience, did not like the chance of a\r\nvisit from them, and never sate alone _in tenebris_. What the amount\r\nof the sums claimed from me may be, we know not; what may be gained\r\nfrom the other shareholders is equally obscure and undefined. But the\r\nfirst thing to do is to get poor Jack out of prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jack out of prison!\" exclaimed I: \"surely, sir, that is\r\ncarrying forgiveness too far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he would not have been in prison if I had not been so blindly\r\nforgetful of his weakness, poor man! I ought to have known better. But\r\nmy vanity misled me; I must needs publish a great book, as if (said Mr\r\nCaxton, looking round the shelves,) there were not great books enough\r\nin the world! I must needs, too, think of advancing and circulating\r\nknowledge in the form of a journal--I, who had not knowledge enough of\r\nthe character of my own brother-in-law to keep myself from ruin! Come\r\nwhat will, I should think myself the meanest of men to let that poor\r\ncreature, whom I ought to have considered as a monomaniac, rot in\r\nprison, because I, Austin Caxton, wanted common sense. And (concluded\r\nmy father resolutely) he is your mother's brother, Pisistratus. I\r\nshould have gone to town at once; but, hearing that my wife had\r\nwritten to you, I waited till I could leave her to the companionship\r\nof hope and comfort--two blessings that smile upon every mother in the\r\nface of a son like you. To-morrow I go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Mr Squills firmly; \"as your medical adviser, I\r\nforbid you to leave the house for the next six days.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" continued Mr Squills, biting off the end of a cigar which he\r\npulled from his pocket, \"you concede to me that it is a very important\r\nbusiness on which you propose to go to London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that there is no doubt,\" replied my father.\r\n\r\n\"And the doing of business well or ill entirely depends upon the habit\r\nof body!\" cried Mr Squills triumphantly. \"Do you know, Mr Caxton, that\r\nwhile you are looking so calm, and talking so quietly--just on purpose\r\nto sustain your son and delude your wife--do you know that your pulse,\r\nwhich is naturally little more than sixty, is nearly a hundred? Do you\r\nknow, sir, that your mucous membranes are in a state of high\r\nirritation, apparent by the _papillæ_ at the tip of your tongue? And\r\nif, with a pulse like this, and a tongue like that, you think of\r\nsettling money matters with a set of sharp-witted tradesmen, all I can\r\nsay is, that you are a ruined man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" began my father.\r\n\r\n\"Did not Squire Rollick,\" pursued Mr Squills--\"Squire Rollick, the\r\nhardest head at a bargain I know of--did not Squire Rollick sell that\r\npretty little farm of his, Scranny Holt, for thirty per cent below its\r\nvalue? And what was the cause, sir?--the whole county was in\r\namaze!--what was the cause, but an incipient simmering attack of the\r\nyellow jaundice, which made him take a gloomy view of human life, and\r\nthe agricultural interest? On the other hand, did not Lawyer Cool, the\r\nmost prudent man in the three kingdoms--Lawyer Cool, who was so\r\nmethodical, that all the clocks in the county were set by his\r\nwatch--plunge one morning head over heels into a frantic speculation\r\nfor cultivating the bogs in Ireland, (his watch did not go right for\r\nthe next three months, which made our whole shire an hour in advance\r\nof the rest of England!) And what was the cause of that nobody knew,\r\ntill I was called in, and fund the cerebral membranes in a state of\r\nacute irritation, probably just in the region of his acquisitiveness\r\nand ideality. No, Mr Caxton, you will stay at home, and take a\r\nsoothing preparation I shall send you, of lettuce leaves and\r\nmarshmallows. But I,\" continued Squills, lighting his cigar and taking\r\ntwo determined whiffs--\"but _I_ will go up to town and settle the\r\nbusiness for you, and take with me this young gentleman, whose\r\ndigestive functions are just in a state to deal safely with those\r\nhorrible elements of dyspepsia--the L. S. D.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Mr Squills set his foot significantly upon mine.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" resumed my father mildly, \"though I thank you very much,\r\nSquills, for your kind offer, I do not recognise the necessity of\r\naccepting it. I am not so bad a philosopher as you seem to imagine;\r\nand the blow I have received has not so deranged my physical\r\norganisation as to render me unfit to transact my affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" grunted Squills, starting up and seizing my father's pulse,\r\n\"ninety-six--ninety-six if a beat! And the tongue, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" quoth my father, \"you have not even seen my tongue!\"\r\n\r\n\"No need of that, I know what it is by the state of the eyelids--tip\r\nscarlet, sides rough as a nutmeg grater!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" again said my father, this time impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Squills solemnly, \"it is my duty to say, (here my mother\r\nentered, to tell me that supper was ready,) and I say it to you, Mrs\r\nCaxton, and you, Mr Pisistratus Caxton, as the parties most nearly\r\ninterested, that if you, sir, go to London upon this matter, I'll not\r\nanswer for the consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Austin, Austin!\" cried my mother, running up and throwing her\r\narms round my father's neck; while I, little less alarmed by Squills'\r\nserious tone and aspect, represented strongly the inutility of Mr\r\nCaxton's personal interference at the first moment. All he could do on\r\narriving in town would be to put the matter into the hands of a good\r\nlawyer, and that we could do for him; it would be time enough to send\r\nfor him when the extent of the mischief done was more clearly\r\nascertained. Meanwhile Squills griped my father's pulse, and my mother\r\nhung on his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Ninety-six--ninety-seven!\" groaned Squills in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it!\" cried my father, almost in a passion--\"never\r\nbetter nor cooler in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the tongue--look at his tongue, Mrs Caxton--a tongue, ma'am, so\r\nbright that you could see to read by it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Austin, Austin!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, it is not my tongue that is in fault, I assure you,\" said my\r\nfather, speaking through his teeth; \"and the man knows no more of my\r\ntongue than he does of the mysteries of Eleusis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it out then,\" exclaimed Squills, \"and if it be not as I say, you\r\nhave my leave to go to London, and throw your whole fortune into the\r\ntwo great pits you have dug for it. Put it out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Squills!\" said my father, colouring--\"Mr Squills, for shame!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear Austin! your hand is so hot--you are feverish, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, only just gratify Mr Squills,\" said I coaxingly.\r\n\r\n\"There, there!\" said my father, fairly baited into submission, and\r\nshyly exhibiting for a moment the extremest end of the vanquished\r\norgan of eloquence.\r\n\r\nSquills darted forward his lynx-like eyes. \"Red as a lobster, and\r\nrough as a gooseberry-bush!\" cried Squills, in a tone of savage joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nHow was it possible for one poor tongue, so reviled and persecuted, so\r\nhumbled, insulted, and triumphed over--to resist three tongues in\r\nleague against it?\r\n\r\nFinally, my father yielded; and Squills, in high spirits, declared\r\nthat he would go to supper with me, to see that I eat nothing that\r\ncould tend to discredit his reliance on my system. Leaving my mother\r\nstill with her Austin, the good surgeon then took my arm, and, as soon\r\nas we were in the next room, shut the door carefully, wiped his\r\nforehead, and said--\"I think we have saved him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it really, then, have injured my father so much?\"\r\n\r\n\"So much!--why, you foolish young man, don't you see that, with his\r\nignorance of business, where he himself is concerned--though, for any\r\nother one's business, neither Rollick nor Cool has a better\r\njudgment--and with his d--d Quixotic spirit of honour worked up into a\r\nstate of excitement, he would have rushed to Mr Tibbets, and exclaimed\r\n'How much do you owe? there it is!'--settled in the same way with\r\nthese printers, and come back without a sixpence; whereas you and I\r\ncan look coolly about us, and reduce the inflammation to the minimum!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, and thank you heartily, Squills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said the surgeon, with more feeling, \"your father has\r\nreally been making a noble effort over himself. He suffers more than\r\nyou would think--not for himself, (for I do believe that, if he were\r\nalone in the world, he would be quite contented if he could save fifty\r\npounds a-year and his books,) but for your mother and yourself; and a\r\nfresh access of emotional excitement, all the nervous anxiety of a\r\njourney to London on such a business, might have ended in a paralytic\r\nor epileptic affection. Now, we have him here snug; and the worst news\r\nwe can give him will be better than what he will make up his mind for.\r\nBut you don't eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat! How can I? My poor father!\"\r\n\r\n\"The effect of grief upon the gastric juices, through the nervous\r\nsystem, is very remarkable,\" said Mr Squills, philosophically, and\r\nhelping himself to a broiled bone; \"it increases the thirst, while it\r\ntakes away hunger. No--don't touch Port!--heating! Sherry and water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nThe house-door had closed upon Mr Squills--that gentleman having\r\npromised to breakfast with me the next morning, so that we might take\r\nthe coach from our gate--and I remained alone, seated by the\r\nsupper-table, and revolving all I had heard, when my father walked in.\r\n\r\n\"Pisistratus,\" said he, gravely, and looking round him, \"your\r\nmother!--suppose the worst--your first care, then, must be to try and\r\nsecure something for her. You and I are men--_we_ can never want,\r\nwhile we have health of mind and body; but a woman--and if anything\r\nhappens to me\"--\r\n\r\nMy father's lip writhed as it uttered these brief sentences.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dear father!\" said I, suppressing my tears with difficulty,\r\n\"all evils, as you yourself said, look worse by anticipation. It is\r\nimpossible that your whole fortune can be involved. The newspaper did\r\nnot run many weeks; and only the first volume of your work is printed.\r\nBesides, there must be other shareholders who will pay their quota.\r\nBelieve me, I feel sanguine as to the result of my embassy. As for my\r\npoor mother, it is not the loss of fortune that will wound her--depend\r\non it, she thinks very little of that; it is the loss of your\r\nconfidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"My confidence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah yes! tell her all your fears, as your hopes. Do not let your\r\naffectionate pity exclude her from one corner of your heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is that--it is _that_, Austin,--my husband--my joy--my pride--my\r\nsoul--my all!\" cried a soft, broken voice.\r\n\r\nMy mother had crept in, unobserved by us.\r\n\r\nMy father looked at us both, and the tears which had before stood in\r\nhis eyes forced their way. Then opening his arms--into which his Kitty\r\nthrew herself joyfully--he lifted those moist eyes upward, and, by the\r\nmovement of his lips, I saw that he thanked God.\r\n\r\nI stole out of the room. I felt that those two hearts should be left\r\nto beat and to blend alone. And from that hour, I am convinced that\r\nAugustine Caxton acquired a stouter philosophy than that of the\r\nstoics. The fortitude that concealed pain was no longer needed, for\r\nthe pain was no longer felt.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nMr Squills and I performed our journey without adventure, and, as we\r\nwere not alone on the coach, with little conversation. We put up at a\r\nsmall inn at the city, and the next morning I sallied forth to see\r\nTrevanion--for we agreed that he would be the best person to advise\r\nus. But, on arriving at St James's Square, I had the disappointment of\r\nhearing that the whole family had gone to Paris three days before, and\r\nwere not expected to return till the meeting of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis was a sad discouragement, for I had counted much on Trevanion's\r\nclear head, and that extraordinary range of accomplishment in all\r\nmatters of business--all that related to practical life--which my old\r\npatron pre-eminently possessed. The next thing would be to find\r\nTrevanion's lawyer, (for Trevanion was one of those men whose\r\nsolicitors are sure to be able and active.) But the fact was, that he\r\nleft so little to lawyers, that he had never had occasion to\r\ncommunicate with one since I had known him; and I was therefore in\r\nignorance of the very name of his solicitor; nor could the porter, who\r\nwas left in charge of the house, enlighten me. Luckily, I bethought\r\nmyself of Sir Sedley Beaudesert, who could scarcely fail to give me\r\nthe information required, and who, at all events, might recommend me\r\nsome other lawyer. So to him I went.\r\n\r\nI found Sir Sedley at breakfast with a young gentleman who seemed\r\nabout twenty. The good baronet was delighted to see me; but I thought\r\nit was with a little confusion, rare to his cordial ease, that he\r\npresented me to his cousin, Lord Castleton. It was a name familiar to\r\nme, though I had never before met its patrician owner.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Castleton was indeed a subject of envy to young idlers,\r\nand afforded a theme of interest to gray-beard politicians. Often had\r\nI heard of \"that lucky fellow Castleton,\" who, when of age, would step\r\ninto one of those colossal fortunes which would realise the dreams of\r\nAladdin--a fortune that had been out to nurse since his minority.\r\nOften had I heard graver gossips wonder whether Castleton would take\r\nany active part in public life--whether he would keep up the family\r\ninfluence. His mother (still alive) was a superior woman, and had\r\ndevoted herself, from his childhood, to supply a father's loss, and\r\nfit him for his great position. It was said that he was clever--had\r\nbeen educated by a tutor of great academic distinction, and was\r\nreading for a double first class at Oxford. This young marquis was\r\nindeed the head of one of those few houses still left in England that\r\nretain feudal importance. He was important, not only from his rank and\r\nhis vast fortune, but from an immense circle of powerful connections;\r\nfrom the ability of his two predecessors, who had been keen\r\npoliticians and cabinet-ministers; from the _prestige_ they had\r\nbequeathed to his name; from the peculiar nature of his property,\r\nwhich gave him the returning interest in no less than six\r\nparliamentary seats in Great Britain and Ireland--besides that\r\nindirect ascendency which the head of the Castletons had always\r\nexercised over many powerful and noble allies of that princely house.\r\nI was not aware that he was related to Sir Sedley, whose world of\r\naction was so remote from politics; and it was with some surprise that\r\nI now heard that announcement, and certainly with some interest that\r\nI, perhaps from the verge of poverty, gazed on this young heir of\r\nfabulous El-Dorados.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that Lord Castleton had been brought up with a\r\ncareful knowledge of his future greatness, and its serious\r\nresponsibilities. He stood immeasurably aloof from all the\r\naffectations common to the youth of minor patricians. He had not been\r\ntaught to value himself on the cut of a coat, or the shape of a hat.\r\nHis world was far above St James's Street and the clubs. He was\r\ndressed plainly, though in a style peculiar to himself--a white\r\nneckcloth, (which was not at that day quite so uncommon for morning\r\nuse as it is now,) trowsers without straps, thin shoes and gaiters.\r\nThere was nothing in his manner of the supercilious apathy which\r\ncharacterises the dandy introduced to some one whom he doubts if he\r\ncan nod to from the bow-window at White's--none of such vulgar\r\ncoxcombries had Lord Castleton; and yet a young gentleman more\r\nemphatically coxcomb it was impossible to see. He had been told, no\r\ndoubt, that, as the head of a house which was almost in itself a party\r\nin the state, he should be bland and civil to all men; and this duty\r\nbeing grafted upon a nature singularly cold and unsocial, gave to his\r\npoliteness something so stiff, yet so condescending, that it brought\r\nthe blood to one's cheek--though the momentary anger was\r\ncounterbalanced by something almost ludicrous in the contrast between\r\nthis gracious majesty of deportment, and the insignificant figure,\r\nwith the boyish beardless face, by which it was assumed. Lord\r\nCastleton did not content himself with a mere bow at our introduction.\r\nMuch to my wonder how he came by the information he displayed, he made\r\nme a little speech after the manner of Louis XIV. to a provincial\r\nnoble--studiously modelled upon that royal maxim of urbane policy\r\nwhich instructs a king that he should know something of the birth,\r\nparentage, and family, of his meanest gentleman. It was a little\r\nspeech, in which my father's learning, and my uncle's services, and\r\nthe amiable qualities of your humble servant, were neatly\r\ninterwoven--delivered in a falsetto tone, as if learned by heart,\r\nthough it must have been necessarily impromptu; and then, reseating\r\nhimself, he made a gracious motion of the head and hand, as if to\r\nauthorise me to do the same.\r\n\r\nConversation succeeded, by galvanic jerks and spasmodic starts--a\r\nconversation that Lord Castleton contrived to tug so completely out of\r\npoor Sir Sedley's ordinary course of small and polished small-talk,\r\nthat that charming personage, accustomed, as he well deserved, to be\r\nCoryphæus at his own table, was completely silenced. With his light\r\nreading, his rich stores of anecdote, his good-humoured knowledge of\r\nthe drawing-room world, he had scarce a word that would fit into the\r\ngreat, rough, serious matters which Lord Castleton threw upon the\r\ntable, as he nibbled his toast. Nothing but the most grave and\r\npractical subjects of human interest seemed to attract this future\r\nleader of mankind. The fact is that Lord Castleton had been taught\r\neverything that relates to _property_--(a knowledge which embraces a\r\nvery wide circumference.) It had been said to him \"You will be an\r\nimmense proprietor--knowledge is essential to your self-preservation.\r\nYou will be puzzled, bubbled, ridiculed, duped every day of your life,\r\nif you do not make yourself acquainted with all by which property is\r\nassailed or defended, impoverished or increased. You have a vast stake\r\nin the country--you must learn all the interests of Europe--nay, of\r\nthe civilised world--for those interests react on the country, and the\r\ninterests of the country are of the greatest possible consequence to\r\nthe interests of the Marquis of Castleton.\" Thus the state of the\r\nContinent--the policy of Metternich--the condition of the Papacy--the\r\ngrowth of Dissent--the proper mode of dealing with the general spirit\r\nof Democracy, which was the epidemic of European monarchies--the\r\nrelative proportions of the agricultural and manufacturing\r\npopulation--corn-laws, currency, and the laws that regulate wages--a\r\ncriticism on the leading speakers of the House of Commons, with some\r\ndiscursive observations on the importance of fattening cattle--the\r\nintroduction of flax into Ireland--emigration--the condition of the\r\npoor--the doctrines of Mr Owen--the pathology of potatoes; the\r\nconnexion between potatoes, pauperism, and patriotism; these, and\r\nsuchlike stupendous subjects for reflection--all branching, more or\r\nless intricately, from the single idea of the Castleton property--the\r\nyoung lord discussed and disposed of in half-a-dozen prim, poised\r\nsentences--evincing, I must say in justice, no inconsiderable\r\ninformation, and a mighty solemn turn of mind. The oddity was, that\r\nthe subjects so selected and treated should not come rather from some\r\nyoung barrister, or mature political economist, than from so gorgeous\r\na lily of the field. Of a less man, certainly, one would have\r\nsaid--\"Cleverish, but a prig;\" but there really was something so\r\nrespectable in a man born to such fortunes, and having nothing to do\r\nbut to bask in the sunshine, voluntarily taking such pains with\r\nhimself, and condescending to identify his own interests--the\r\ninterests of the Castleton property--with the concerns of his lesser\r\nfellow-mortals, that one felt the young marquis had in him the stuff\r\nto become a very considerable man.\r\n\r\nPoor Sir Sedley, to whom all these matters were as unfamiliar as the\r\ntheology of the Talmud, after some vain efforts to slip the\r\nconversation into easier grooves, fairly gave in, and, with a\r\ncompassionate smile on his handsome countenance, took refuge in his\r\neasy-chair and the contemplation of his snuff-box.\r\n\r\nAt last, to our great relief, the servant announced Lord Castleton's\r\ncarriage; and with another speech of overpowering affability to me,\r\nand a cold shake of the hand to Sir Sedley, Lord Castleton went his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast parlour looked on the street, and I turned mechanically\r\nto the window as Sir Sedley followed his guest out of the room. A\r\ntravelling carriage, with four post-horses, was at the door; and a\r\nservant, who looked like a foreigner, was in waiting with his master's\r\ncloak. As I saw Lord Castleton step into the street, and wrap himself\r\nin his costly mantle lined with sables, I observed, more than I had\r\nwhile he was in the room, the enervate slightness of his frail form,\r\nand the more than paleness of his thin, joyless face; and then,\r\ninstead of envy, I felt compassion for the owner of all this pomp and\r\ngrandeur--felt that I would not have exchanged my hardy health, and\r\neasy humour, and vivid capacities of enjoyment in things the slightest\r\nand most within the reach of all men, for the wealth and greatness\r\nwhich that poor youth perhaps deserved the more for putting them so\r\nlittle to the service of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Sir Sedley, \"and what do you think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is just the sort of man Trevanion would like,\" said I, evasively.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Sir Sedley, in a serious tone of voice, and\r\nlooking at me somewhat earnestly. \"Have you heard?--but no, you cannot\r\nhave heard yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heard what?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear young friend,\" said the kindest and most delicate of all fine\r\ngentlemen, sauntering away that he might not observe the emotion he\r\ncaused, \"Lord Castleton is going to Paris to join the Trevanions. The\r\nobject Lady Ellinor has had at heart for many a long year is won, and\r\nour pretty Fanny will be Marchioness of Castleton when her betrothed\r\nis of age--that is, in six months. The two mothers have settled it all\r\nbetween them!\"\r\n\r\nI made no answer, but continued to look out of the window.\r\n\r\n\"This alliance,\" resumed Sir Sedley, \"was all that was wanting to\r\nassure Trevanion's position. When parliament meets, he will have some\r\ngreat office. Poor man! how I shall pity him! It is extraordinary to\r\nme,\" continued Sir Sedley, benevolently going on, that I might have\r\nfull time to recover myself, \"how contagious that disease called\r\nbusiness is in our foggy England! Not only Trevanion, you see, has the\r\ncomplaint in its very worst and most complicated form, but that poor\r\ndear cousin of mine, who is so young, (here Sir Sedley sighed) and\r\nmight enjoy himself so much, is worse than you were when Trevanion was\r\nfagging you to death. But, to be sure, a great name and position, like\r\nCastleton's, must be a very heavy affliction to a conscientious mind.\r\nYou see how the sense of its responsibilities has _aged_ him\r\nalready--positively, two great wrinkles under his eyes. Well, after\r\nall, I admire him, and respect his tutor: a soil naturally very thin,\r\nI suspect, has been most carefully cultivated; and Castleton, with\r\nTrevanion's help, will be the first man in the peerage--prime-minister\r\nsome day, I dare say. And, when I think of it, how grateful I ought to\r\nfeel to his father and mother, who produced him quite in their old\r\nage; for, if he had not been born, I should have been the most\r\nmiserable of men--yes, positively, that horrible marquisate would have\r\ncome to me! I never think over Horace Walpole's regrets, when he got\r\nthe earldom of Orford, without the deepest sympathy, and without a\r\nshudder at the thought of what my dear Lady Castleton was kind enough\r\nto save me from--all owing to the Ems waters, after twenty years'\r\nmarriage! Well, my young friend, and how are all at home?\"\r\n\r\nAs when, some notable performer not having yet arrived behind the\r\nscenes, or having to change his dress, or not having yet quite\r\nrecovered an unlucky extra tumbler of exciting fluids--and the green\r\ncurtain has therefore unduly delayed its ascent--you perceive that the\r\nthorough-bass in the orchestra charitably devotes himself to a prelude\r\nof astonishing prolixity, calling in _Lodoiska_ or _Der Freischutz_ to\r\nbeguile the time, and allow the procrastinating histrion leisure\r\nsufficient to draw on his flesh-coloured pantaloons, and give himself\r\nthe proper complexion for a Coriolanus or Macbeth--even so had Sir\r\nSedley made that long speech, requiring no rejoinder, till he saw the\r\ntime had arrived when he could artfully close with the flourish of a\r\nfinal interrogative, in order to give poor Pisistratus Caxton all\r\npreparation to compose himself, and step forward. There is certainly\r\nsomething of exquisite kindness, and thoughtful benevolence, in that\r\nrarest of gifts,--_fine breeding_; and when now, remanned and\r\nresolute, I turned round and saw Sir Sedley's soft blue eye shyly, but\r\nbenignantly, turned to me--while, with a grace no other snuff-taker\r\never had since the days of Pope, he gently proceeded to refresh\r\nhimself by a pinch of the celebrated Beaudesert mixture--I felt my\r\nheart as gratefully moved towards him as if he had conferred on me\r\nsome colossal obligation. And this crowning question--\"And how are all\r\nat home?\" restored me entirely to my self-possession, and for the\r\nmoment distracted the bitter current of my thoughts.\r\n\r\nI replied by a brief statement of my father's involvement, disguising\r\nour apprehensions as to its extent, speaking of it rather as an\r\nannoyance than a possible cause of ruin, and ended by asking Sir\r\nSedley to give me the address of Trevanion's lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe good baronet listened with great attention; and that quick\r\npenetration which belongs to a man of the world enabled him to detect,\r\nthat I had smoothed over matters more than became a faithful narrator.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and, seating himself on the sofa, motioned me to\r\ncome to his side; then, leaning his arm over my shoulder, he said in\r\nhis seductive, winning way--\r\n\r\n\"We two young fellows should understand each other, when we talk of\r\nmoney matters. I can say to you what I could not to my respectable\r\nsenior--by three years; your excellent father. Frankly, then, I\r\nsuspect this is a bad business. I know little about newspapers, except\r\nthat I have to subscribe to one in my county, which costs me a small\r\nincome; but I know that a London daily paper might ruin a man in a few\r\nweeks. And as for shareholders, my dear Caxton, I was once teased into\r\nbeing a shareholder in a canal that ran through my property, and\r\nultimately ran off with £30,000 of it! The other shareholders were all\r\ndrowned in the canal, like Pharaoh and his hosts in the Red Sea. But\r\nyour father is a great scholar, and must not be plagued with such\r\nmatters. I owe him a great deal. He was very kind to me at Cambridge,\r\nand gave me the taste for reading, to which I owe the pleasantest\r\nhours of my life. So, when you and the lawyers have found out what the\r\nextent of the mischief is, you and I must see how we can best settle\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce! my young friend--I have no 'encumbrances,' as the\r\nservants, with great want of politeness, call wives and children. And\r\nI am not a miserable great landed millionnaire, like that poor dear\r\nCastleton, who owes so many duties to society that he can't spend a\r\nshilling, except in a grand way and purely to benefit the public. So\r\ngo, my boy, to Trevanion's lawyer: he is mine too. Clever\r\nfellow--sharp as a needle. Mr Pike, in Great Ormond Street--name on a\r\nbrass plate; and when he has settled the amount, we young scapegraces\r\nwill help each other, without a word to the old folks.\"\r\n\r\nWhat good it does to a man, throughout life, to meet kindness and\r\ngenerosity like this in his youth!\r\n\r\nI need not say that I was too faithful a representative of my father's\r\nscholarly pride, and susceptible independence of spirit, to accept\r\nthis proposal; and probably Sir Sedley, rich and liberal as he was,\r\ndid not dream of the extent to which his proposal might involve him.\r\nBut I expressed my gratitude, so as to please and move this last relic\r\nof the De Coverleys, and went from his house straight to Mr Pike's\r\noffice, with a little note of introduction from Sir Sedley. I found Mr\r\nPike exactly the man I had anticipated from Trevanion's\r\ncharacter--short, quick, intelligent, in question and answer;\r\nimposing, and somewhat domineering, in manner--not overcrowded with\r\nbusiness, but with enough for experience and respectability; neither\r\nyoung nor old; neither a pedantic machine of parchment, nor a jaunty\r\noff-hand coxcomb of West End manners.\r\n\r\n\"It is an ugly affair,\" said he, \"but one that requires management.\r\nLeave it all in my hands for three days. Don't go near Mr Tibbets, nor\r\nMr Peck; and on Saturday next, at two o'clock, if you will call here,\r\nyou shall know my opinion of the whole matter.\" With that Mr Pike\r\nglanced at the clock, and I took up my hat and went.\r\n\r\nThere is no place more delightful than a great capital, if you are\r\ncomfortably settled in it--have arranged the methodical disposal of\r\nyour time, and know how to take business and pleasure in due\r\nproportions. But a flying visit to a great capital, in an unsettled,\r\nunsatisfactory way--at an inn--an inn in the city, too--with a great\r\nworrying load of business on your mind, of which you are to hear no\r\nmore for three days; and an aching, jealous, miserable sorrow at the\r\nheart, such as I had--leaving you no labour to pursue, and no pleasure\r\nthat you have the heart to share in--oh, a great capital then is\r\nindeed forlorn, wearisome, and oppressive! It is the Castle of\r\nIndolence, not as Thomson built it, but as Beckford drew in his Hall\r\nof Eblis--a wandering up and down, to and fro--a great awful space,\r\nwith your hand pressed to your heart; and--oh for a rush on some\r\nhalf-tamed horse, through the measureless green wastes of Australia!\r\nThat is the place for a man who has no home in the Babel, and whose\r\nhand is ever pressing to his heart, with its dull, burning pain.\r\n\r\nMr Squills decoyed me the second evening into one of the small\r\ntheatres; and very heartily did Mr Squills enjoy all he saw, and all\r\nhe heard. And while, with a convulsive effort of the jaws, I was\r\ntrying to laugh too, suddenly, in one of the actors, who was\r\nperforming the worshipful part of a parish beadle, I recognised a face\r\nthat I had seen before. Five minutes afterwards, I had disappeared\r\nfrom the side of Squills, and was amidst that strange world--BEHIND\r\nTHE SCENES.\r\n\r\nMy beadle was much too busy and important to allow me a good\r\nopportunity to accost him, till the piece was over. I then seized hold\r\nof him, as he was amicably sharing a pot of porter with a gentleman in\r\nblack shorts and a laced waistcoat, who was to play the part of a\r\nbroken-hearted father in the Domestic Drama in Three Acts, that would\r\nconclude the amusements of the evening.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said I apologetically; \"but, as the Swan pertinently\r\nobserves,--'Should auld acquaintance be forgot?'\"\r\n\r\n\"The Swan, sir!\" cried the beadle aghast--\"the Swan never demeaned\r\nhimself by such d--d broad Scotch as that!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Tweed has its swans as well as the Avon, Mr Peacock.\"\r\n\r\n\"St--st--hush--hush--h--u--sh!\" whispered the beadle in great alarm,\r\nand eyeing me, with savage observation, under his corked eyebrows.\r\nThen, taking me, by the arm, he jerked me away. When he had got as far\r\nas the narrow limits of that little stage would allow us, Mr Peacock\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you have the advantage of me; I don't remember you. Ah! you need\r\nnot look!--by gad, sir, I am not to be bullied,--it was all fair play.\r\nIf you will play with gentlemen, sir, you must run the consequences.\"\r\n\r\nI hastened to appease the worthy man.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Mr Peacock, if you remember, I refused to play with you; and,\r\nso far from wishing to offend you, I now come on purpose to compliment\r\nyou on your excellent acting, and to inquire if you have heard\r\nanything lately of your young friend, Mr Vivian.\r\n\r\n\"Vivian?--never heard the name, sir. Vivian! Pooh, you are trying to\r\nhoax me; very good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, Mr Peac\"--\r\n\r\n\"St--st--How the deuce did you know that I was once called Peac--that\r\nis, people called me Peac--A friendly nickname, no more--drop it, sir,\r\nor you 'touch me with noble anger!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well; 'the rose, by any name, will smell as sweet,' as the\r\nSwan, this time at least, judiciously observes. But Mr Vivian, too,\r\nseems to have other names at his disposal. I mean a young, dark,\r\nhandsome man--or rather boy--with whom I met you in company by the\r\nroadside, one morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"O--h!\" said Mr Peacock, looking much relieved, \"I know whom you mean,\r\nthough I don't remember to have had the pleasure of seeing you before.\r\nNo; I have not heard anything of the young man lately. I wish I did\r\nknow something of him. He was a 'gentleman in my own way.' Sweet Will\r\nhas hit him off to a hair!--\r\n\r\n    'The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's eye, tongue, sword.'\r\n\r\nSuch a hand with a cue!--you should have seen him seek 'the bubble\r\nreputation at the _cannon's_ mouth!' I may say, (continued Mr Peacock,\r\nemphatically,) that he was a regular trump--trump!\" he reiterated with\r\na start, as if the word had stung him--\"trump! he was a BRICK!\"\r\n\r\nThen fixing his eyes on me, dropping his arms, interlacing his\r\nfingers, in the manner recorded of Talma in the celebrated \"Qu'en\r\ndis-tu?\" he resumed in a hollow voice, slow and distinct--\r\n\r\n\"When--saw--you--him,--young m--m--a--n--nnn?\"\r\n\r\nFinding the tables thus turned on myself, and not willing to give Mr\r\nPeac-- any clue to poor Vivian--who thus appeared, to my great\r\nsatisfaction, to have finally dropped an acquaintance more versatile\r\nthan reputable--I contrived, by a few evasive sentences, to keep Mr\r\nPeac--'s curiosity at a distance, till he was summoned in haste to\r\nchange his attire for the domestic drama. And so we parted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nI hate law details as cordially as my readers can, and therefore I\r\nshall content myself with stating that Mr Pike's management, at the\r\nend, not of three days, but of two weeks, was so admirable that Uncle\r\nJack was drawn out of prison, and my father extracted from all his\r\nliabilities, by a sum two-thirds less than was first startlingly\r\nsubmitted to our indignant horror--and that, too, in a manner that\r\nwould have satisfied the conscience of the most punctilious formalist,\r\nwhose contribution to the national fund, for an omitted payment to the\r\nIncome Tax. the Chancellor of the Exchequer ever had the honour to\r\nacknowledge. Still the sum was very large in proportion to my poor\r\nfather's income; and what with Jack's debts, the claims of the\r\nAnti-Publisher Society's printer--including the very expensive plates\r\nthat had been so lavishly bespoken, and in great part completed, for\r\nthe _History of Human Error_--and, above all, the liabilities incurred\r\non _The Capitalist_; what with the _plant_, as Mr Peck technically\r\nphrased a great upas-tree of a total, branching out into types, cases,\r\nprinting-presses, engines, &c., all now to be resold at a third of\r\ntheir value; what with advertisements and bills, that had covered all\r\nthe dead walls by which rubbish might be shot, throughout the three\r\nkingdoms; what with the dues of reporters, and salaries of writers,\r\nwho had been engaged for a year at least to _The Capitalist_, and\r\nwhose claims survived the wretch they had killed and buried; what, in\r\nshort, with all that the combined ingenuity of Uncle Jack and printer\r\nPeck could supply for the utter ruin of the Caxton family--even after\r\nall deductions, curtailments, and after all that one could extract in\r\nthe way of just contribution from the least unsubstantial of those\r\nshadows called the shareholders--my father's fortune was reduced to\r\nlittle more than £8000, which being placed at mortgage, at 4 per cent,\r\nyielded just £372, 10s. a-year--enough for my father to live upon, but\r\nnot enough to afford also his son Pisistratus the advantages of\r\neducation at Trinity College, Cambridge. The blow fell rather upon me\r\nthan my father, and my young shoulders bore it without much wincing.\r\n\r\nThis settled, to our universal satisfaction, I went to pay my farewell\r\nvisit to Sir Sedley Beaudesert. He had made much of me, during my stay\r\nin London. I had breakfasted and dined with him pretty often; I had\r\npresented Squills to him, who no sooner set eyes upon that splendid\r\nconformation, than he described his character with the nicest accuracy\r\nas the necessary consequence of such a development for the rosy\r\npleasures of life, and whose philosophy delighted and consoled Sir\r\nSedley. We had never once retouched on the subject of Fanny's\r\nmarriage, and both of us tacitly avoided even mentioning the\r\nTrevanions. But in this last visit, though he maintained the same\r\nreserve as to Fanny, he referred without scruple to her father.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my young Athenian,\" said he, after congratulating me on the\r\nresult of the negotiations, and endeavouring again in vain to bear at\r\nleast some share in my father's losses--\"well, I see I cannot press\r\nthis farther; but at least I _can_ press on you any little interest I\r\nmay have, in obtaining some appointment for yourself in one of the\r\npublic offices. Trevanion could of course be more useful, but I can\r\nunderstand that he is not the kind of man you would like to apply to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I own to you, my dear Sir Sedley, that I have no taste for\r\nofficial employment? I am too fond of my liberty. Since I have been at\r\nmy uncle's old tower, I account for half my character by the\r\nBorderer's blood that is in me. I doubt if I am meant for the life of\r\ncities, and I have odd floating notions in my head, that will serve to\r\namuse me when I get home, and may settle into schemes. And now, to\r\nchange the subject, may I ask what kind of person has succeeded me as\r\nMr Trevanion's secretary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he has got a broad-shouldered, stooping fellow, in spectacles\r\nand cotton stockings, who has written upon 'Rent,' I believe--an\r\nimaginative treatise in his case, I fear, poor man, for rent is a\r\nthing he could never have received, and not often been trusted to pay.\r\nHowever, he is one of your political economists, and wants Trevanion\r\nto sell his pictures, as 'unproductive capital.' Less mild than Pope's\r\nNarcissa, 'to make a wash,' he would certainly 'stew a child.' Besides\r\nthis official secretary, Trevanion trusts, however, a good deal to a\r\nclever, good-looking young gentleman, who is a great favourite with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"His name?--oh, Gower--a natural son, I believe, of one of the Gower\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\nHere two of Sir Sedley's fellow fine gentlemen lounged in, and my\r\nvisit ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n\"I swear,\" cried my uncle, \"that it _shall_ be so;\" and with a big\r\nfrown, and a truculent air, he seized the fatal instrument.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, brother, it must not,\" said my father, laying one pale,\r\nscholar-like hand mildly on Captain Roland's brown, bellicose, and\r\nbony fist; and with the other, outstretched, protecting the menaced,\r\npalpitating victim.\r\n\r\nNot a word had my uncle heard of our losses, until they had been\r\nadjusted, and the sum paid; for we all knew that the old tower would\r\nhave been gone--sold to some neighbouring squire or jobbing\r\nattorney--at the first impetuous impulse of Uncle Roland's\r\naffectionate generosity. Austin endangered! Austin ruined!--he would\r\nnever have rested till he came, cash in hand, to his deliverance.\r\nTherefore, I say, not till all was settled did I write to the Captain,\r\nand tell him gaily what had chanced. And, however light I made of our\r\nmisfortunes, the letter brought the Captain to the red brick house the\r\nsame evening on which I myself reached it, and about an hour later. My\r\nuncle had not sold the tower, but he came prepared to carry us off to\r\nit _vi et armis_. We must live with him, and on him--let or sell the\r\nbrick house, and put out the remnant of my father's income to nurse\r\nand accumulate. And it was on finding my father's resistance stubborn,\r\nand that hitherto he had made no way,--that my uncle, stepping back\r\ninto the hall, in which he had left his carpet-bag, &c., returned with\r\nan old oak case, and, touching a spring roller, out flew--the Caxton\r\npedigree.\r\n\r\nOut it flew--covering all the table, and undulating, Nile-like, till\r\nit had spread over books, papers, my mother's work-box, and the\r\ntea-service, (for the table was large and compendious, emblematic of\r\nits owner's mind)--and then, flowing on the carpet, dragged its slow\r\nlength along, till it was stopped by the fender.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said my uncle solemnly, \"there never have been but two causes\r\nof difference between you and me, Austin. One is over; why should the\r\nother last? Aha! I know why you hang back; you think that we may\r\nquarrel about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"About what, Roland?\"\r\n\r\n\"About it, I say--and I'll be d--d if we do!\" cried my uncle,\r\nreddening, (I never heard him swear before.) \"And I have been thinking\r\na great deal upon the matter, and I have no doubt you are right. So I\r\nbrought the old parchment with me, and you shall see me fill up the\r\nblank, just as you would have it. Now, then, you will come and live\r\nwith me, and we can never quarrel any more.\"\r\n\r\nThus saying, Uncle Roland looked round for pen and ink; and, having\r\nfound them--not without difficulty, for they had been submerged under\r\nthe overflow of the pedigree--he was about to fill up the _lacuna_, or\r\nhiatus, which had given rise to such memorable controversy, with the\r\nname of \"William Caxton, printer in the Sanctuary,\" when my father,\r\nslowly recovering his breath, and aware of his brother's purpose,\r\nintervened. It would have done your heart good to hear them--so\r\ncompletely, in the inconsistency of human nature, had they changed\r\nsides upon the question--my father now all for Sir William de Caxton,\r\nthe hero of Bosworth; my uncle all for the immortal printer. And in\r\nthis discussion they grew animated: their eyes sparkled, their voices\r\nrose--Roland's voice deep and thunderous, Austin's sharp and piercing.\r\nMr Squills stopped his ears. Thus it arrived at that point, when my\r\nuncle doggedly came to the end of all argumentation--\"I swear that it\r\nshall be so;\" and my father, trying the last resource of pathos,\r\nlooked pleadingly into Roland's eyes, and said, with a tone soft as\r\nmercy, \"Indeed, brother, it must not.\" Meanwhile the dry parchment\r\ncrisped, creaked, and trembled in every pore of its yellow skin.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, coming in, opportunely, like the Horatian deity, \"I\r\ndon't see that either of you gentlemen has a right so to dispose of my\r\nancestry. It is quite clear that a man has no possession in posterity.\r\nPosterity may possess him; but deuce a bit will he ever be the better\r\nfor his great great-grandchildren!\"\r\n\r\nSQUILLS.--Hear, hear!\r\n\r\nPISISTRATUS--(_warming_.)--But a man's ancestry is a positive property\r\nto him. How much, not only of acres, but of his constitution, his\r\ntemper, his conduct, character, and nature, he may inherit from some\r\nprogenitor ten times removed! Nay, without that progenitor would he\r\never have been born--would a Squills ever have introduced him into the\r\nworld, or a nurse ever have carried him _upo kolpo_?\r\n\r\nSQUILLS.--Hear, hear!\r\n\r\nPISISTRATUS--(_with dignified emotion_)--No man, therefore, has a\r\nright to rob another of a forefather, with a stroke of his pen, from\r\nany motives, howsoever amiable. In the present instance, you will say,\r\nperhaps, that the ancestor in question is apocryphal--it may be the\r\nprinter, it may be the knight. Granted; but here, where history is in\r\nfault, shall a mere sentiment decide? While both are doubtful, my\r\nimagination appropriates both. At one time I can reverence industry\r\nand learning in the printer; at another, valour and devotion in the\r\nknight. This kindly doubt gives me two great forefathers; and, through\r\nthem, two trains of idea that influence my conduct under different\r\ncircumstances. I will not permit you, Captain Roland, to rob me of\r\neither forefather--either train of idea. Leave, then, this sacred void\r\nunfilled, unprofaned; and accept this compromise of chivalrous\r\ncourtesy--while my father lives with the Captain, we will believe in\r\nthe printer; when away from the Captain, we will stand firm to the\r\nknight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Uncle Roland, as I paused, a little out of breath.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" said my mother softly, \"I do think, Austin, there is a way of\r\nsettling the matter which will please all parties. It is quite sad to\r\nthink that poor Roland, and dear little Blanche, should be all alone\r\nin the tower; and I am sure that we should be much happier\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" cried Roland, triumphantly. \"If you are not the most\r\nobstinate, hardhearted, unfeeling brute in the world--which I don't\r\ntake you to be--brother Austin, after that really beautiful speech of\r\nyour wife's, there is not a word to be said farther.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have not yet heard Kitty to the end, Roland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, a thousand times, ma'am--sister,\" said the\r\nCaptain, bowing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was going to add,\" said my mother, \"that we will go and live\r\nwith you, Roland, and club our little fortunes together. Blanche and I\r\nwill take care of the house, and we shall be just twice as rich\r\ntogether as we are separately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty sort of hospitality that!\" grunted the Captain. \"I did not\r\nexpect you to throw me over in that way. No, no; you must lay by for\r\nthe boy there,--what's to become of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we shall _all_ lay by for him,\" said my mother simply; \"you as\r\nwell as Austin. We shall have more to save, if we have both more to\r\nspend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, save!--that is easily said: there would be a pleasure in saving,\r\nthen!\" said the Captain mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"And what's to become of me?\" cried Squills, very petulantly. \"Am I to\r\nbe left here, in my old age--not a rational soul to speak to, and no\r\nother place in the village where there's a drop of decent punch to be\r\nhad! 'A plague on both your houses'! as the chap said at the theatre\r\nthe other night.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's room for a doctor in our neighbourhood, Mr Squills,\" said the\r\nCaptain. \"The gentleman in your profession who _does for us_, wants, I\r\nknow, to sell the business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Squills--\"a horrible healthy neighbourhood, I suspect!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it has that misfortune, Mr Squills; but with your help,\" said my\r\nuncle slily, \"a great alteration for the better may be effected in\r\nthat respect.\"\r\n\r\nMr Squills was about to reply, when ring--a-ting--ring--ting! there\r\ncame such a brisk, impatient, make-one's-self-at-home kind of\r\ntintanabular alarum at the great gate, that we all started up and\r\nlooked at each other in surprise. Who could it possibly be? We were\r\nnot kept long in suspense; for, in another moment, Uncle Jack's voice,\r\nwhich was always very clear and distinct, pealed through the hall; and\r\nwe were still staring at each other when Mr Tibbets, with a bran-new\r\nmuffler round his neck, and a peculiarly comfortable, greatcoat--best\r\ndouble Saxony, equally new--dashed into the room, bringing with him a\r\nvery considerable quantity of cold air, which he hastened to thaw,\r\nfirst in my father's arms, next in my mother's. He then made a rush at\r\nthe Captain, who ensconced himself behind the dumb waiter with a \"Hem!\r\nMr--sir--Jack--sir--hem, hem!\" Failing there, Mr Tibbets rubbed off\r\nthe remaining frost upon his double Saxony against your humble\r\nservant; patted Squills affectionately on the back, and then proceeded\r\nto occupy his favourite position before the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Took you by surprise, eh?\" said Uncle Jack, unpeeling himself by the\r\nhearth-rug. \"But no--not by surprise; you must have known Jack's\r\nheart: you at least, Austin Caxton, who know everything--you must have\r\nseen that it overflowed, with the tenderest and most brotherly\r\nemotions; that, once delivered from that cursed Fleet, (you have no\r\nidea what a place it is, sir,) I could not rest, night or day, till I\r\nhad flown here--here, to the dear family nest--poor wounded dove that\r\nI am!\" added Uncle Jack pathetically, and taking out his\r\npocket-handkerchief from the double Saxony, which he had now flung\r\nover my father's arm-chair.\r\n\r\nNot a word replied to this eloquent address, with its touching\r\nperoration. My mother hung down her pretty head, and looked ashamed.\r\nMy uncle retreated quite into the corner, and drew the dumb waiter\r\nafter him, so as to establish a complete fortification. Mr Squills\r\nseized the pen that Roland had thrown down, and began mending it\r\nfuriously--that is, cutting it into slivers--thereby denoting,\r\nsymbolically, how he would like to do with Uncle Jack, could he once\r\nget him safe and snug under his manipular operations. I leant over the\r\npedigree, and my father rubbed his spectacles.\r\n\r\nThe silence would have been appalling to another man: nothing appalled\r\nUncle Jack.\r\n\r\nUncle Jack turned to the fire, and warmed first one foot, then the\r\nother. This comfortable ceremony performed, he again faced the\r\ncompany--and resumed musingly, and as if answering some imaginary\r\nobservations--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--you are right there--and a deuced unlucky speculation it\r\nproved too. But I was overruled by that fellow Peck. Says I to\r\nhim--says I--'_Capitalist!_ pshaw--no popular interest there--it don't\r\naddress the great public! Very confined class the capitalists; better\r\nthrow ourselves boldly on the people. Yes,' said I, 'call it the\r\n_anti_-Capitalist.' By Jove, sir, we should have carried all before us!\r\nbut I was overruled. The _Anti-Capitalist_!--what an idea! Address the\r\nwhole reading world then, sir: everybody hates the capitalist--everybody\r\nwould have his neighbour's money. The _Anti-Capitalist_!--sir, we should\r\nhave gone off, in the manufacturing towns, like wildfire. But what could\r\nI do?\"--\r\n\r\n\"John Tibbets,\" said my father solemnly, \"capitalist or\r\nanti-capitalist, thou hadst a right to follow thine own bent, in\r\neither--but always provided it had been with thine own money. Thou\r\nsee'st not the thing, John Tibbets, in the right point of view; and a\r\nlittle repentance, in the face of those thou hast wronged, would not\r\nhave misbecome thy father's son, and thy sister's brother!\"--\r\n\r\nNever had so severe a rebuke issued from the mild lips of Austin\r\nCaxton; and I raised my eyes with a compassionate thrill, expecting to\r\nsee John Tibbets gradually sink and disappear through the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Repentance!\" cried Uncle Jack, bounding up, as if he had been shot.\r\n\"And do you think I have a heart of stone, of pummy-stone!--do you\r\nthink I don't repent? I have done nothing but repent--I shall repent\r\nto my dying day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is no more to be said, Jack,\" cried my father, softening,\r\nand holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" cried Mr Tibbets, seizing the hand, and pressing it to the heart\r\nhe had thus defended from the suspicion of being pummy--\"yes--that I\r\nshould have trusted that dunder-headed, rascally, curmudgeon Peck: that\r\nI should have let him call it _The Capitalist_, despite all my\r\nconvictions, when the _Anti_----\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" interrupted my father, drawing away his hand.\r\n\r\n\"John,\" said my mother gravely, and with tears in her voice, \"you\r\nforget who delivered you from prison,--you forget whom you have nearly\r\nconsigned to prison yourself,--you forg--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush!\" said my father, \"this will never do; and it is you who\r\nforget, my dear, the obligations I owe to Jack. He has reduced my\r\nfortune one half, it is true; but I verily think he has made the three\r\nhearts, in which lie my real treasures, twice as large as they were\r\nbefore. Pisistratus, my boy, ring the bell.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Kitty,\" cried Jack, whimperingly, and stealing up to my\r\nmother, \"don't be so hard on me; I thought to make all your\r\nfortunes--I did, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nHere the servant entered.\r\n\r\n\"See that Mr Tibbets' things are taken up to his room, and that there\r\nis a good fire,\" said my father.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" continued Jack, loftily, \"I _will_ make all your fortunes yet.\r\nI have it _here_!\" and he struck his head.\r\n\r\n\"Stay a moment,\" said my father to the servant, who had got back to\r\nthe door. \"Stay a moment,\" said my father, looking extremely\r\nfrightened; \"perhaps Mr Tibbets may prefer the inn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Austin,\" said Uncle Jack with emotion, \"if I were a dog, with no home\r\nbut a dog-kennel, and you came to me for shelter, I would turn out--to\r\ngive you the best of the straw!\"\r\n\r\nMy father was thoroughly melted this time.\r\n\r\n\"Primmins will be sure to see everything is made comfortable for Mr\r\nTibbets,\" said he, waving his hand to the servant. \"Something nice for\r\nsupper, Kitty, my dear--and the largest punch-bowl. You like punch,\r\nJack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Punch, Austin!\" said Uncle Jack, putting his handkerchief to his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe Captain pushed aside the dumb waiter, strode across the room, and\r\nshook hands with Uncle Jack; my mother buried her face in her apron,\r\nand fairly ran off; and Squills said in my ear, \"It all comes of the\r\nbiliary secretions. Nobody could account for this, who did not know\r\nthe peculiarly fine organisation of your father's--liver!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] Tibullus, iii. 4, 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. PRUDHON.--CONTRADICTIONS ECONOMIQUES.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we wished to convert some inveterate democrat--some one of those\r\neternal agitators of political and social revolutions--whose\r\nreasonings, though perhaps unconsciously to themselves, are all based\r\non a far too sanguine view of the probable destinies of human\r\nsociety--there is no text-book we should more willingly select than\r\nthis mad and apparently destructive work of M. Prudhon's. The bold\r\ndevelopment of those fundamental truths which have hitherto determined\r\nthe framework of society, and, still more, the display it presents of\r\nthe utter impotence of the wit of man, and all his speculative\r\ningenuity, to reshape and reorganise the social world, must have, on\r\nevery mind accustomed to reflection, a most sobering and\r\n_conservative_ influence. What it was intended to teach is another\r\nmatter; but to a mind well constituted it would convey this grave\r\nlesson--to recognise and submit to the inevitable; to be content to\r\nlabour for partial remedies and limited results; to be satisfied with\r\ndoing good, though it be something short of organic change; to think\r\nit sufficient ambition to be of that \"salt of the earth\" which\r\npreserves whatever is pure and excellent, without aspiring to be that\r\nconsuming flame which is to fuse and recast the world.\r\n\r\nSuch was the reflection with which we closed the perusal of the\r\n_Contradictions Economiques_; and this reflection has led us to the\r\npresent notice of a work which was not originally taken up with the\r\nintention of bringing it before our readers. We were referred to it as\r\nthe work in which a man who has obtained unenviable notoriety had most\r\nsystematically developed his ideas. Whether it is so, or not, we do\r\nnot pledge ourselves to decide: we have had enough of _Prudhonerie_.\r\nBut after a perusal, induced by mere curiosity, it occurred to us that\r\nsome brief account of the book, and of the train of thought which it\r\nhad suggested to us, and would probably suggest to most English\r\nreaders, would not be unacceptable.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that it is not uniformly from the most perfect\r\nworks that we derive the greatest stimulant to thinking, or the\r\nlargest supply of food for reflection. Many an important step in\r\nintellectual progress has been due to an author, not one of whose\r\nviews have been finally adopted, or would have borne perhaps a\r\nsearching examination. The startling effect of paradox--the conflict\r\nwith it--the perplexing entanglement of known truth with manifest\r\nerror,--all this has supplied a more bracing and vigorous exercise for\r\nthe mind, than lucid tenets lucidly set forth by writers of\r\nunimpeachable good sense. God forbid that any one should accuse us of\r\nsaying, that it is better to read a bad book than a good one; this\r\nwould be the greatest of all absurdities; but there are eras in our\r\nmental progress when much is gained by the contest with bold and\r\nsubtle fallacies. There is not a book in our own language more replete\r\nwith paradox and sophistry, with half truths and tortuous reasonings,\r\nthan Godwin's _Political Justice_; yet we doubt not there are those\r\nliving who would acknowledge that the perusal of that once, and for a\r\nshort time, celebrated treatise, did more, by the incessant combat it\r\nprovoked, to make evident to them the real constitution of human\r\nsociety, than the smooth sagacity of a hundred Paleys could have done.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when we compare the _Political Justice_ with the reveries of\r\nCommunism, so rife amongst our neighbours, we feel proud of our\r\nEnglish dreamer. Godwin's scheme was somewhat as if one of the ancient\r\nstoics, not content with imposing upon his wise man rules of conduct\r\nquite independent of all human passions and affections, had resolved\r\nthat the whole multitude of the species should demean themselves\r\naccording to the same impracticable rules, and should learn to live,\r\nand labour, and enjoy, like reasoning automata. Under the light\r\ndiffused upon them by the author of the _Political Justice_, men were\r\nto set aside all selfishness--all their natural, and even kindly\r\naffections--and to act in unceasing conformity to certain abstractions\r\nof the reasoning faculty; were, in short, neither to love nor to hate;\r\nbut, sitting in eternal judgment over themselves, were simply to\r\nreason and to act. Like the iron figures that formerly stood elevated\r\nabove the living crowd of Fleet Street, on either side of the\r\nvenerable clock of St Dunstan's, they were to keep their eye fixed on\r\nthe dial-plate of a most well-regulated conscience; and ever, as the\r\nhour came round, they were to rise and strike, and then subside into\r\ntheir metallic repose. Still, however, the great sentiment of justice,\r\nto which Godwin made his appeal, afforded him a far more noble and\r\nmanly topic than the affected philanthropy on which so many Frenchmen\r\nhave been descanting. Justice, though not understood after the manner\r\nof Mr Godwin, is a sentiment which really lives and moves in the very\r\nheart of society. Men respond to an appeal to their sense of justice;\r\nthey become ungovernable if that sense of justice is long outraged;\r\nthey work upon this sentiment; they can labour and endure according to\r\nits dictates: but for this philanthropy, or fraternity, of which we\r\nhear so much--what has it ever done? It never regulated the\r\ntransactions of a single day; never produced a grain of corn, or a\r\nshred of apparel; produces nothing but theories. It is a vain,\r\nimportunate, idle, and clamorous sentiment: it is justice all on one\r\nside; it demands incessantly, it gives never; it has hands to petition\r\nwith, to clutch with, to rob with, to murder with, but not to work\r\nwith; it has no hand that holds the plough, or strikes upon the anvil.\r\n\r\nThe _Système des Contradictions Economiques_ may lay claim to the same\r\nsort of praise we have accorded to the _Political Justice_: it prompts\r\nreflection; and a man of intellect sufficiently robust to profit by\r\nsuch rude gymnastics, will not regret its perusal. It also avoids,\r\nlike the work of Godwin, the pernicious cant of universal\r\nphilanthropy--pernicious when brought forward as a general motive of\r\nhuman actions--and looks for a renovation of society in a more\r\nenlightened sentiment of justice--determining anew the value of each\r\nman's labour, and securing to him that value--property being\r\nlegitimate only (so far as we can understand our author) when it\r\ncontains in it the labour of the proprietor. How Justice is to execute\r\nthe task which M. Prudhon, in very vague and mysterious terms, imposes\r\nupon her, we have not the least idea; nor has an attentive perusal of\r\nhis book given us the remotest conception of any practical scheme that\r\nhe would even make experiment of. But, at all events, it is better to\r\ndescant on the energetic sentiment of justice, which desires to earn\r\nand keep its own, than on the idle sublimities of a universal\r\nfraternity--a sentiment which relaxes the springs of industry, by\r\nteaching every man to expect everything from his neighbours, or from\r\nan omnipotent abstraction he calls the state. It is a difference of\r\nsome importance, because all these schemes for the renovation of\r\nsociety do, in fact, end in a sort of moral or immoral preachment.\r\n\r\nWhen we have said thus much, and added that M. Prudhon attacks the\r\nCommunists, of all shades and descriptions, in a quite overwhelming\r\nmanner, utterly crushing and annihilating them,--we have said the\r\nutmost that can be admitted, or devised, in praise of his work. It\r\nwould require a much longer paragraph to exhaust all that might be\r\njustly said in its condemnation. It is strewed over, knee-deep, with\r\nmetaphysical trash. It is steeped in atheism, or something worse, and\r\ninfinitely more foolish; for there is a pretence of sustaining \"the\r\nhypothesis\" of a God, for no other ostensible reason than to provide\r\nan object for the blasphemy that follows. The rudest savages, in their\r\nfirst conception of a God, regard him as an enemy, and offer\r\nsacrifices to propitiate an unprovoked and wanton anger--the reflected\r\nimage of their own wild passions. M. Prudhon's philosophy has actually\r\nbrought him, in one respect, back to the creed of the savages. He\r\nproves, by some insane process not worth following, that the Creator\r\nof man is essentially opposed to the progress of human society, and is\r\nto be utterly deserted, desecrated, defied. He does not, indeed,\r\nsacrifice, like the savage; he rather talks rebellion, like Satan. No\r\none would believe, who had not read the book, with what a mixture of\r\noutrage and levity he speaks of the most sacred of all beings: it is\r\nthe doctrine of the rebel-fiend taught with the gesticulation of a\r\nsatyr.\r\n\r\nWe shall not quote a single passage to justify this censure, for the\r\nsame reason that we should not extract the indecencies of a volume in\r\norder to prove the charge of obscenity. Why should the ear be wounded,\r\nor the mind soiled and disgusted, when no end is answered except the\r\nconviction of an offender who, utterly dead to shame, rejoices to see\r\nhis impurities or impieties pitched abroad?\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that formidable appearance of metaphysics to which we\r\nhave alluded--his Kant and his Hegel, his thesis, antithesis, and\r\nsynthesis, and all his pretensions to extraordinary profundity--it so\r\nhappens that the very first elements of that science of political\r\neconomy, which he affects to look down upon as from a higher level,\r\nare often miserably misapprehended; or--what is certainly not more to\r\nhis credit--they are thrown, for a season, into a wilful oblivion. If\r\nhe is discoursing upon the division of labour, and its effect upon the\r\nremuneration of the workman, he ignores, for the time being, the\r\nmanifest relation between population and wages, and represents the\r\nwages as decreasing only because the nature of the work required\r\nbecomes more and more simple and mechanical. If he is discoursing upon\r\npopulation, and its pressure upon the means of subsistence, he can\r\nventure to forget the very laws of nature. \"You state,\" he says, \"that\r\npopulation increases in a geometrical ratio--1, 2, 4, 8, 16; well, I\r\nwill show that capital and wealth follow a law of progression more\r\nrapid still, of which each term may be considered as the square of the\r\ncorresponding number of the geometrical series, as 1, 4, 16, 64,\r\n256.\"[6] Since all our wealth is derived originally from the soil, man\r\nmust, therefore, have it in his power to increase the fertility of the\r\nsoil according to the above ratio. It will be something new to our\r\nfarmers to learn this.\r\n\r\nIn compensation, we presume, for this occasional oblivion of the\r\ntruisms of political economy--truisms, in fact, of common sense--we\r\nhave, here and there, strange and novel definitions and explanations,\r\nushered in with that pomp which an egotistical Frenchman can alone\r\ndisplay, and turning out to be as idle verbiage as was ever penned.\r\nTake, as the first specimen we can call to mind, the following\r\ndefinition of labour. We cannot attempt to translate it: the English\r\nlanguage does not easily mould itself to nonsense of this\r\nsort:--\"Qu'est-ce donc que le travail? Nul encore ne l'a défini. Le\r\ntravail est l'émission de l'esprit. Travailler, c'est dépenser sa\r\nvie; travailler, en un mot, c'est se dévouer, c'est mourir. Que les\r\nutopistes ne nous parlent plus de dévoûment: c'est le travail, exprimé\r\net mesuré par ses oeuvres.\"--(Vol. ii., p. 465.) Labour needed to be\r\ndefined, it seemed; and this is the definition, \"L'émission de\r\nl'esprit!\" And in play, then, as well as in work, is there no emission\r\nof the spirits, or mind, or life of the man? Did M. Prudhon never run\r\na race, or handle a bat at cricket, or ride with the hounds? or can he\r\nnot remember that such things _are_, though not in his philosophy? But\r\ndear, inexpressibly dear to M. Prudhon, is every idea of his own that\r\nsavours of paradox; and the more it violates common sense, the more\r\ntenderly he clings to it, cherishes, and vaunts it. This, doubtless, is\r\none of his favourite children. His celebrated aphorism, \"La Propriété\r\nc'est le vol,\"--he contradicts it himself in every page of his\r\nwritings, yet boasts and cherishes it as his greatest possession, and\r\nthe most remarkable discovery of the age. \"La définition de la\r\npropriété,\" he says, in answer to a sarcasm of M. Michelet, \"est\r\nmienne, et toute mon ambition est de prouver que j'en ai compris le\r\nsens et l'étendue. _La propriété c'est le vol!_ il ne se dit pas, en\r\nmille ans, deux mots comme celui-là. Je n'ai d'autre bien sur la terre\r\nque cette définition de la propriété: mais je la tiens plus précieuse\r\nque les millions des Rothschild, et j'ose dire qu'elle sera l'évènement\r\nle plus considérable du gouvernement de Louis-Philippe.\"--(Vol. ii., p.\r\n328.)\r\n\r\nEven in that tenebrous philosophy which he has imported from Germany,\r\nand which he teaches with such caustic condescension to the political\r\neconomists, he is very much at fault. It is always, we know, an\r\nadventurous matter to accuse any one who deals in the idealistic\r\nmetaphysics of modern Germany of obscurity, or of imperfect knowledge\r\nof the theories taught in his own school. The man has but to dive into\r\ndeeper mud to escape from you. Follow him you assuredly cannot; he is\r\nout of sight, and the thick sediment deters; and thus, in the eyes of\r\nall who are not aware what the capture would cost to any hapless\r\npursuer, the fugitive is sure of his triumph. Nevertheless, we venture\r\nto assert that M. Prudhon is but a young, and a not very promising\r\nscholar in the philosophy of Kant and of Hegel. Two very manifest\r\nblunders it will be enough to indicate: he assimilates his\r\n_Contradictions Economiques_ to the _Antinomies of the Pure Reason_\r\ndeveloped by Kant; and he confounds Kant with Hegel in a matter where\r\nthey are widely opposed, and speaks as if the same law of\r\ncontradiction were common to both.\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to some of his own \"contradictions,\" he says, \"Tel est\r\nencore le problème de la divisibilité de la matière à l'infini, que\r\nKant a démontré pouvoir être nié et affirmé, tour-à-tour, par des\r\narguments également plausibles et irréfutables.\"--(Vol. i. p. 43.) It\r\nis the object of Kant, in one of the most striking portions of the\r\n_Critique of Pure Reason_, to show that, in certain problems, the mind\r\nis capable of being led with equal force of conviction to directly\r\nopposite conclusions. The pure reason, it seems, gets hold of the\r\nforms of the understanding, and can extract nothing from them but a\r\nseries of antinomies, like that which M. Prudhon has alluded to, where\r\nthe infinite divisibility of matter is both proved and disproved with\r\nequal success. Now what analogy is there between the contradictions\r\nwhich M. Prudhon can develop, in any one of our social laws, and the\r\nantinomies of Kant? In these last, two opposite conclusions of\r\nspeculative reason are arrived at, which destroy each other; in the\r\n_Contradictions Economiques_, the good and evil flowing from the same\r\nlaw may very easily co-exist. They affect different persons, or the\r\nsame persons at different times. Free competition, for instance, in\r\ntrade or manufacture, may be viewed on its bright side as the promoter\r\nof industry and invention; on its dark side as the fomenter of strife,\r\nand the inflicter of injury on those who lose in the game of wealth.\r\nBut the benefit and injury arising from this source do not destroy\r\neach other, like the yes and no of an abstract proposition; they can\r\nbe balanced against each other; they co-exist, and, for aught we see,\r\nwill eternally co-exist. Let them be as strikingly opposed as you\r\nwill, they can have nothing in common with the antinomies of Kant. M.\r\nPrudhon proves that there is darkness and brightness scattered over\r\nthe surface of society: he does not prove that the same spot, at the\r\nsame moment, is both black and white.\r\n\r\nFrom Kant he slides to Hegel, as if their tenets on this subject at\r\nall resembled each other. Kant saw in his contradictions an arrest of\r\nthe reason, Hegel the very principle and condition of all thought.\r\nThought involves contradictions. In the simplest idea, that of being,\r\nis involved the idea of no-being; neither can we think of no-being\r\nwithout having the idea of being. Now as _thought_ and _thing_ are\r\nidentical in the absolute, (this every one knows,) whatever may be\r\nsaid of the thought may be said of the thing, and hence the celebrated\r\nformula, Being = no being--_sein_ = _nicht sein_--something and\r\nnothing are identical.\r\n\r\nAs thought and thing are identical in the absolute, logic is a\r\ncreation and creation is a logic; thus the metaphysics of Hegel became\r\na cosmogony in which all things proceed according to the laws of\r\nthought, and are therefore developed in a series of contradictions.\r\nNow let M. Prudhon be as thorough master of the Hegelian logic, or the\r\nHegelian cosmogony, as he desires to be esteemed, how, in the name of\r\ncommon sense, can he hope to clear up the difficulties of political\r\neconomy by mixing them with a philosophy like this? How will his\r\nthesis and his antithesis help us to adjust the claims between labour\r\nand capital? If he has any adjustment to propose--if he has found what\r\nhe calls his synthesis--let us hear it. If the synthesis is only to be\r\ndeveloped in those future evolutions of time, which neither he nor we\r\ncan divine, of what use all this angry exposition of the inevitable\r\n_Contradictions_ that mark and constitute the progress of humanity?\r\n\r\nEnough of these metaphysics. It was necessary to say this much of the\r\npeculiar form into which M. Prudhon has chosen to cast his thoughts;\r\nbut there will be no occasion to allude to it again. Whatever there is\r\nof truth or significance in his work, may easily be transferred into a\r\nlanguage familiar and intelligible to all.\r\n\r\nWe have eaten, says one, of the forbidden fruit of the tree of the\r\nknowledge of good and evil, and the taste of them has been thenceforth\r\ninvariably blended together. There is a law of compensation--thus\r\nanother expresses it--throughout the world, both moral and physical,\r\nby which every evil is balanced by its good, and every good by its\r\nbesetting evil. Humanity, says a third, progresses without doubt, and\r\nobtains at each stage a fuller and a higher life; but there is an\r\noriginal proportion of misery in its lot, from which there is no\r\nescape: this also swells and darkens as we rise. To use the language\r\nof chemistry, you may increase the volume of this ambient life we\r\nbreathe, but still, to every one-hundred part of vital air there shall\r\nbe added twenty-five of mephitic vapour. All these are different modes\r\nof expressing the homely truth, that a shadow of evil falls even from\r\nthe best of things; and it is this truth which is really developed in\r\nthe _Contradictions Economiques_.\r\n\r\nIt is a truth which, at times, it may be very needful fully to\r\nrecognise. When men of sincere convictions are found agitating society\r\nfor some organic change, their errors may be always traced to an\r\nover-sanguine and one-sided view of the capabilities of man for\r\nhappiness. The conservative and the movement parties, philosophically\r\nconsidered, may be described as branching out of different opinions on\r\nthe probable or possible progress of society. The philosophical\r\nconservative has accepted humanity as it is--as, in its great\r\nfeatures, it is exhibited throughout all regions of the earth, and in\r\nthe page of history: he hails with welcome every addition to human\r\nhappiness; he believes in progress, he derides the notion of\r\nperfectibility,--it is a word he cannot use; he recognises much\r\nhappiness coming in to mankind from many and various sources, but\r\nstill believes that man will never find himself so content on earth as\r\nto cease looking forward for the complement and perfection of his\r\nfelicity to another world. The philosopher of the movement party has\r\nmade a sort of religion of his hopes of humanity: he conceives some\r\nideal state, and anticipates its development _here_; he dismantles\r\nheaven and immortality to furnish out his masquerade on earth; or,\r\nwith still vaguer notions, he rushes forward upon reforms that imply,\r\nfor their justification, the existence of what never yet was seen--a\r\ntemperate and enlightened multitude.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the conservative has allotted to him the ungracious\r\nand invidious task of discouraging the hopes of a too eager\r\nphilanthropy; he is compelled to show, of certain evils, that they are\r\nconstantly to be contended against, but never can be eradicated.\r\nSociety has been often compared to a pyramid; its broad basis on the\r\nearth, and towering high or not, according as circumstances were\r\npropitious to its formation; but always the broad basis lying on the\r\nearth. He accepts the ancient simile; he recognises the unalterable\r\npyramid. Without aid of priest or legislator, society assumes this\r\nform; it crystallises thus; higher and higher, broader and broader, it\r\nrises, and extends, but still the lowest stratum is lying close upon\r\nthe earth. Will you disguise the fact? It is fruitless, and the\r\nfalsehood only recoils upon yourself, rendering what truth you utter\r\nweak and suspicious. Will you strive to make the pyramid stand upon\r\nits apex? It will _not_ stand; and what god or giant have you to hold\r\nit there? Or will you join the madman, who, because the lowest stratum\r\ncannot be made the highest, nor any other but the lowest, would level\r\nthe whole pyramid to the ground, and make every part touch the earth?\r\nNo; you will do all in your power for that lowest stratum, but you\r\nwill not consent that, because all cannot be cultivated and refined,\r\nno one shall have a chance of becoming so. You accept the pyramid.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Prudhon criticises the laws which preside over the production\r\nand distribution of wealth, and shows their twofold and antagonistic\r\ninfluence, he is but illustrating the inevitable formation of our\r\npyramid. Let us follow him in a few instances.\r\n\r\n_The Division of Labour._--This is the first topic on which our author\r\ndescants--the first of our economic laws in which he finds his\r\ncontradictions--his two poles of good and evil. On the advantages of\r\nthe division of labour, we have but to call to mind the earlier\r\nchapters of Adam Smith, wherein these are so truthfully and vividly\r\ndescribed. Indeed, the least reflection is sufficient to show that, if\r\neach man undertook by his own labour to provide for all his wants, it\r\nwould be impossible for society to advance beyond the very rudest form\r\nof existence. One man must be tailor, another shoemaker, another\r\nagriculturist, another artist; and these trades or occupations, to be\r\nbrought to perfection, must again be subdivided into different\r\ndepartments of industry--and one man makes the coat, and another\r\nweaves the cloth, one man makes the shoe, and another dresses the\r\nleather. It is needless to say that these departments are again\r\ndivided into an almost infinite number of separate occupations; till,\r\nat length, we find that a man employs his whole day in turning one\r\nthread over another, or in manufacturing the eighteenth part of a pin.\r\n\r\nBut now, no sooner does this division of employments obtain in\r\nsociety, than our pyramid begins to form. The man of manual labour\r\nrests still at the basis; he of superior skill, the artist, or the\r\nintellectual workman, rises permanently above him. The more minute\r\nthis division of labour, the more simple and mechanical becomes the\r\nlabour of the artisan; the education he receives from his employment\r\nbecomes more and more limited; he is wanted for so little; he is\r\nesteemed, and, if other circumstances permit, remunerated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"Although,\" says the celebrated economist, J. B. Say, \"a man who\r\nperforms one operation all his life comes to execute it better and\r\nmore rapidly than any other man, yet at the same time he grows less\r\ncapable of every other occupation, physical and moral; his other\r\nfaculties are extinguished, and there results a degradation to the\r\nhuman being considered individually. It is a sad account to give of\r\none's-self to have accomplished nothing but the eighteenth part of a\r\npin.... In conclusion, it may be said that the separation of labours\r\nis a skilful employment of the force of man--that it increases\r\nprodigiously the products of society--but it destroys something of the\r\ncapacity of the individual man.\"\r\n\r\nThat this inevitable division and subdivision of labour gives rise to,\r\nand renders permanent, the distinction of classes in a community, is\r\nclear enough. But we do not agree with M. Say, and other economists,\r\nin representing that minute subdivision of labour which accompanies a\r\nvery advanced state of civilisation, as peculiarly injurious to the\r\nworkman. That degradation of the artisan, which might ensue from the\r\nmonotony and triviality of his employment, is counteracted by that\r\nvariety of interests which spring up in a civilised community. This\r\neighteenth part of a pin is not all that educates or engages his mind.\r\nHe is not a solitary workman. His file and his wire are not his sole\r\ncompanions. He has the gossip of his neighbourhood, the politics of\r\nhis parish, of his town, of his country--whatever fills the columns of\r\na newspaper, or gives topic of conversation to a populous city--he\r\nhas, at least, all this for intellectual food. The man of handicraft\r\nis educated by the city he lives in, not by his handicraft; and the\r\nhumblest artisan feels the influence of that higher civilisation from\r\nwhich he seems at first to be entirely shut out. Hodge the countryman,\r\nwho can sow, and plough, and reap; who understands hedging and\r\nditching, and the management of sheep; who is accomplished in all\r\nagricultural labours, ought to be, if his daily avocations alone\r\ndecided the matter, infinitely superior to the village cobbler, who\r\ntravels only from the sole to the upper leather, and who squats\r\nstitching all day long. But the cobbler is generally the more knowing,\r\nand certainly the more talkative man. Hodge himself is the first to\r\nrecognise it; for he listens to him at the ale-house, which sometimes\r\nbrings them together, as to an oracle of wisdom.\r\n\r\n_Machinery._--The benefit derived from machinery needs no explanation.\r\nThe more simple order of machines, or instruments--as the plough, the\r\naxe, and the spindle--have never been otherwise considered than as\r\nprecious gifts to human industry; and the more complicated machines,\r\nwhich have been invented in modern times, have no sooner established\r\nthemselves, so to speak, in society--have no sooner, at the expense of\r\nsome temporary evils, secured themselves a quiet recognised\r\nposition--than they, too, have been welcomed in the same character as\r\nsignal aids to human industry. But while the machine has added\r\nimmensely to the products of labour, it has done nothing to diminish\r\nthe class of manual labours. It has done nothing, nor does it seem\r\nprobable that it will ever effect anything, towards rendering that\r\nclass less requisite or less numerous. On the contrary, it has always,\r\nhitherto, multiplied that class. The machine will not go of itself,\r\nwill not manufacture itself, nor keep itself in repair. The human\r\nlabourer becomes the slave of the machine. He created it for his\r\nservice, and it serves him, but on condition only that he binds\r\nhimself to a reciprocal bondage. You spin by a steam-engine, and some\r\ncomplicated system of reels and pulleys, but the human finger is not\r\nspared--the human volition is still wanted. To manufacture this\r\nmachine, to tend it, to govern it--in short, to use it--far more\r\nmanual labour is called into requisition than ever turned the simple\r\nspinning-wheel, or teased the flax from the distaff. You have more\r\ngarments woven, but the better clad are not exactly those who weave\r\nthem. The machine has called into existence, for its own service, an\r\nimmense population, ill fed and ill clothed. Our pyramid is extending\r\nat the basis: as it rises higher it is growing broader.\r\n\r\n_Money--Capital._--We class these together because they are intimately\r\nconnected. Capital is not money, but there would have been little\r\naccumulation of capital but for the use of money.\r\n\r\nThe youthful student of political economy meets with no chapter in his\r\nbooks of science so amusing, and so thoroughly convincing, as that\r\nwhich shows him the utility of money, and the reasons which have led\r\nalmost all nations to prefer the precious metals for their instruments\r\nof exchange. Without some such instrument, what is to be done? A man\r\nhas made a hat, and wants a pound of butter. He cannot divide his hat:\r\nwhat would be half a hat? Besides, the man who has the butter does not\r\nwant the hat. But the precious metals come in marvellously to his aid.\r\nThey are divisible into the smallest portions; they are durable, will\r\nnot spoil by keeping; they are of steady value, and will not much\r\ndepreciate: if the man of butter does not want them, he can always\r\nfind somebody that does; no fear but that they will easily pass from\r\nhand to hand, as each one wishes to barter them for whatever he may\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nIt is generally said, that it is the steadiness of their value that\r\nconstituted one chief reason for the selection of gold and silver for\r\nthe purposes of money. This is undoubtedly true; but it is also true\r\n(and we do not remember to have heard this previously remarked) that\r\nthe use of the precious metals for money has tended to preserve and\r\nperpetuate that steadiness of value. Had gold and silver remained as\r\nsimple articles of merchandise, they would probably have suffered\r\nconsiderable fluctuations in their value from the caprice of fashion\r\nand the altered taste of society. In themselves, they were chiefly\r\narticles of luxury; the employment of them for money made them objects\r\nof indispensable utility.\r\n\r\nMoney there must be. Yet mark how its introduction tends to destroy\r\nequality, to favour accumulation, to raise the hill and sink the\r\nvalley. If men bartered article against article, they would generally\r\nbarter in order to consume. But when one of them barters for gold, he\r\ncan lay it by; he can postpone at his pleasure the period of\r\nconsumption; he can postpone it for the benefit of his issue. The\r\npiece of gold was bought originally with the sweat of his brow; who\r\nshall say that a year, ten years, fifty years hence, he may not\r\ntraffic it again for the sweat of the brow? The pieces of gold\r\naccumulate, his children possess them, and now a generation appears on\r\nthe face of the earth who have not toiled, who do not toil all their\r\nlives, who are sustained in virtue of the labours of their ancestor.\r\nTheir fathers saved, and they enjoy; or they employ a part of the\r\naccumulation in the purchase of the labour of others, by which means\r\ntheir riches still further increase. The pyramid rises. But the\r\ndescendants of those fathers who had consumed the product of their\r\nlabour, they bring no postponed claim into the market. These are they\r\nwho must sell their labour. They must work for the children of those\r\nwho had saved. Our pyramid broadens at the base. This perpetual value\r\ngiven to money has enabled the man of one generation to tax all\r\nensuing generations with the support of his offspring. Hence much\r\ngood; for hence the leisure that permits the cultivation of the mind,\r\nthat fosters art, and refinement, and reflection: we have to notice\r\nhere only how inevitably it builds the pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd now two classes are formed, distinct and far asunder--the\r\ncapitalist, and he who works for wages. Comes the social reformer, and\r\nhe would restore the equality between them. But how? We will fuse,\r\nsays one, the two classes together: they shall carry on their\r\nmanufacture in a joint partnership: all shall be partners--all shall\r\nbe workmen. But even M. Prudhon will tell us that, if the profits of\r\nthe great capitalist were divided equally amongst all the artisans he\r\nemploys, each one would find his gains increased by a very little; and\r\nit is morally certain that profits equal to those he had obtained\r\nwould never accrue from a partnership of many hundreds of workmen. The\r\nwealth of the country would, therefore, be put in jeopardy, and all\r\nthe course of its industry and property deranged, for no end whatever.\r\nAt all events, exclaims another, we will reduce the inequality which\r\nwe cannot expunge, and put down the enormous and tyrannical\r\ncapitalist: we will have a law limiting the fortune of each individual\r\nto so many hundreds or thousands; or, if we allow a man to earn and\r\nappropriate unlimited wealth, we will take care that it shall be\r\ndispersed at his death,--not even to his son shall he be permitted to\r\nbequeath more than a certain sum. But all schemes of this kind can\r\ntend only to equalise the fortunes of the first class--those who\r\nemploy labour; they do not affect, in the least, the condition of the\r\nsecond class--the employed. These will not obtain better wages from\r\nsmaller capitalists than from larger. A third--it is M. Prudhon\r\nhimself--will have a new law of value established, and a new law of\r\nproperty. It is labour only that shall give title to property, and the\r\nexchangeable value of every article shall be regulated according to\r\nthe labour it may be said to contain: propositions, however, which do\r\nnot help us in the least degree, for capital is itself the produce of\r\nlabour; its claims, therefore, are legitimate; and the very problem\r\ngiven is to arbitrate between the claims of capital and labour.\r\n\r\n_Rent and Property in Land._--This is the last topic we shall mention.\r\nThe absolute necessity of property in land, in order that the soil\r\nshould be cultivated, (that is, under any condition in which humanity\r\nhas hitherto presented itself,) is a palpable truism. Yet property in\r\nland leads to the exaction of rent--leads to the same division which\r\nwe have seen marked out by so many laws between two classes of\r\nsociety--those who may enjoy leisure, and those who must submit to\r\nlabour; classes which are generally distinguished as the rich and\r\npoor, never, we may observe in passing, as the happy and unhappy, for\r\nleisure may be as great a curse as labour.\r\n\r\nIt is true that large estates in land exist before corresponding\r\naccumulations of capital have been made in commerce, for land is often\r\nseized by the mere right of conquest; but still these large\r\npossessions would certainly arise as a nation increased its wealth.\r\nThe man who has cultivated land successfully will add field to field;\r\nand he who has gained a large sum of money by commerce, or\r\nmanufacture, will purchase land with it. The fact therefore, that, in\r\nthe early period of a nation's history, the soil has been usurped by\r\nconquest, or by the sheer right of the strongest, interferes not at\r\nall with the real nature of that property; as, independently of this\r\naccident of conquest, land would have become portioned in the same\r\nunequal manner by the operation of purely economical causes. Just in\r\nthe same way, the fact that warlike nations have subjected their\r\ncaptives to slavery--imposed the labours of life on slaves--cannot be\r\nsaid to have had any influence in originating the existence, at the\r\npresent time, of a class of working people.\r\n\r\nThus every law of political economy, having, as it were, its two\r\npoles, upwards and downwards, helps to erect our pyramid. Religion,\r\neducation, charity, permeate the whole mass, and labour to rectify the\r\napparent injustice of fortune. Admirable is their influence: but yet\r\nwe cannot build on any other model than this.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but we can!\" exclaim the Communists; and forthwith they project\r\na complete demolition of the old pyramid, and the erection of a series\r\nof parallelogram palaces, all level with the earth, and palace every\r\ninch of them.\r\n\r\nWe have said that M. Prudhon is a formidable adversary of these\r\nCommunists--the more formidable from the having himself no great\r\nattachment to \"things as they are.\" His exposition of the manifold\r\nabsurdities and self-contradictions into which they fall, may possibly\r\nrender good service to his countrymen. Especially we were glad to see,\r\nthat on the subject of marriage he is quite sound. No one could more\r\ndistinctly perceive, or more forcibly state, the intimate connexion\r\nthat lies between property and marriage. \"Mais, c'est surtout dans la\r\nfamille que se decouvre le sens profond de la propriété. La famille et\r\nla propriété marchent de front, appuyées l'une sur l'autre, n'ayant\r\nl'une et l'autre de signification, et de valeur, que par le rapport\r\nqui les unit. Avec la propriété commence le rôle de la femme. Le\r\nménage--cette chose toute idéale, et que l'on s'efforce en vain de\r\nrendre ridicule--le ménage est le royaume de la femme, le monument de\r\nla famille. Otez le ménage, otez cette pierre du foyer, centre\r\nd'attraction des époux, il reste des couples, il n'y a plus de\r\nfamilles.\"--(Vol. ii. 253.)\r\n\r\nIn this country, happily, it would be superfluous--a mere slaying of\r\nthe slain--to expose the folly of these Utopias. Utopias indeed!--that\r\nwould deprive men of personal liberty, of domestic affection, of\r\neverything that is most valued in life, to shut them up in a strange\r\nbuilding which is to be palace, prison, and workhouse, all in one;\r\nwhich must have a good deal of the workhouse, if it has anything of\r\nthe palace, and will probably have more of the prison in it than\r\neither.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the case may be stated thus:--The _cost_ of such a community\r\nwould be liberty, marriage, enterprise, hope, and generosity--for,\r\nunder such an institution, what could any man have to give or receive?\r\nThe _gain_ would be task-work for all, board and lodging for all, and\r\na shameless sensuality; the working-bell, the dinner-bell, and the\r\ncurfew. It would be a sacrifice of all that is high, ennobling, and\r\nspiritual, to all that is material, animal, and vile.\r\n\r\nBut if men think otherwise of the fraternal community--if they think\r\nthat, because philanthropy presides, or seems to preside, over its\r\nformation, that therefore philanthropy will continue to animate all\r\nits daily functions--why do they not voluntarily unite and form this\r\ncommunity? They are fond of quoting the example of the early\r\nChristians; these were really under the influence of a fraternal\r\nsentiment, and _acted_ on it: let them do likewise, there is nothing\r\nto prevent them. But no: the French Socialist sees in imagination a\r\nwhole state working for him; he has no idea of commencing by\r\npractising the stern virtues of industry, and abstinence, and\r\nfortitude. His mode of thinking is this--a certain being called\r\nSociety is to do everything _for him_--at the cost, perhaps, of some\r\nslight service rendered upon his part. If he is poor, it is society\r\nthat keeps him so; if he is vicious, it is society that makes him\r\nso--upon society rest all our crimes, and devolve all our duties.\r\n\r\nThere lies the great mischief of promulgating these impracticable\r\ntheories of Communism. All is taught as being done for the individual.\r\nThe egregious error is committed of trusting all to a certain\r\norganisation of society, which is to be a substitute for the moral\r\nefforts of individual man. Patience, fortitude, self-sacrifice, a high\r\nsense of imperative duty, are supposed to be rendered unnecessary in a\r\nscheme of things which, if it were possible, would require these\r\nvirtues in a pre-eminent degree. The virtuous enthusiast would find\r\nhimself, indeed, utterly mistaken--the stage which he thought prepared\r\nfor the exhibition of the serenest virtues, would be a scene given up\r\nto mere animal life: but still, if he limited himself to the teaching\r\nof these virtues--of a godlike temperance, and a perpetual\r\nself-negation--it is not probable, indeed, that he would find many\r\ndisciples; neither is it easy to see that any great mischief could\r\nensue. Every community, where possessions have been in common, which\r\nhas at all succeeded, has been sustained by religious zeal--the most\r\npotent of all sentiments, and one extraneous to the framework of\r\nsociety. French Communism is the product of idleness and sensuality,\r\nprovoked into ferocity by commercial distress; clamouring for means of\r\nself-indulgence _from the state_, and prepared to extort its claim by\r\nany amount of massacre.\r\n\r\nThus we have shown that the work of M. Prudhon, with its\r\n_contradictions_, or laws of good and of evil, tends but to illustrate\r\nthe inevitable rise and unalterable nature of our social pyramid. This\r\nwas our object, and here must end our present labours on M. Prudhon.\r\nIf our readers are disappointed that they have not heard more of his\r\nown schemes for the better construction of society--that they have not\r\nlearned more of the mystery concealed under the famous paradox that\r\nhas been blown about by all the winds of heaven--_la propriété c'est\r\nle vol!_--we can only say that we have not learned more ourselves.\r\nMoreover, we are fully persuaded he has nothing to teach. All his\r\nstrength lies in exposing evils he cannot remedy, and destroying the\r\nschemes of greater quacks than himself. That property itself is not\r\nthe subject of his attack, but the mode in which that property is\r\ndetermined, is all that we can gather. The value of every object of\r\nexchange is to be determined by the labour bestowed upon it; and the\r\nproperty in it, we presume, is to be decreed to him whose labour has\r\nbeen bestowed. But capital has been justly defined as accumulated\r\nlabour; he who supplies capital supplies labour. We are brought back,\r\ntherefore, to the old difficulty of adjusting (by any other standard\r\nthan the relative proportion which capital and labour bear at any time\r\nin the market) the claims of capital and labour. Any such equitable\r\nadjustment, by a legislative interference, we may safely pronounce to\r\nbe impossible.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] _Système des Contradictions Economiques; ou Philosophie de la\r\nMisère._ Par J. P. PRUDHON.\r\n\r\n[6] Vol. ii., p. 461.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN HAND.\r\n\r\nA \"SHORT\" YARN.--PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left the forecastle group of the \"Gloucester\" disappointed by the\r\nabrupt departure of their story-teller, Old Jack, at so critical a\r\nthread of his yarn. As old Jacobs went aft on the quarter-deck, where\r\nthe binnacle-lamp before her wheel was newly lighted, he looked in\r\nwith a seaman's instinct upon the compass-boxes, to see how the ship\r\nheaded; ere ascending to the poop, he bestowed an approving nod upon\r\nhis friend the steersman, hitched up his trousers, wiped his mouth\r\nwith the back of his hand in a proper deference to female society, and\r\nthen proceeded to answer the captain's summons. The passengers, in a\r\nbody, had left the grand cabin to the bustling steward and his boys,\r\npreviously to assembling there again for tea--not even excepting the\r\nlittle coterie of inveterate whist-players, and the pairs of\r\ninseparable chess-men, to whom an Indian voyage is so appropriately\r\nthe school for future nice practice in etiquette, war, and commerce.\r\nEverybody had at last got rid of sea-sickness, and mustered for a\r\npromenade; so that the lofty poop of the Indiaman, dusky as it was,\r\nand exposed to the breeze, fluttered with gay dresses like the midway\r\nbattlement of a castle by the waves, upon which its inmates have\r\nstolen out from some hot festivity. But the long heave from below,\r\nraising her stern-end slowly against the western space of\r\nclear-obscure, in the manner characteristic of a sea abaft the beam,\r\nand rolling her to either hand, exhibited to the eyes on the\r\nforecastle a sort of _alto-relievo_ of figures, amongst whom the male,\r\nin their blank attempts to appear nautical before the ladies, were\r\ndistinguished from every other object by their variety of ridiculous\r\npostures. Under care of one or two bluff, good-humoured young\r\nmates--officers polished by previous opportunities of a kind unknown\r\neither to navy-men or mere \"cargo-fenders,\" along with several roguish\r\nlittle quasi-midshipmen--the ladies were supported against the\r\npoop-rail, or seated on the after-gratings, where their contented\r\ndependence not only saved them from the ludicrous failures of their\r\nfellow-passengers, but gained them, especially the young ones, the\r\ncredit of being better sailors. An accompaniment was contributed to\r\nthis lively exercise on the part of the gentlemen promenaders, which\r\notherwise, in the glimmering sea-twilight, would have been striking in\r\na different sense; by the efforts, namely, of a little band of amateur\r\nmusicians under the break of the poop, who, with flute, clarionet,\r\nbugles, trombone, and violin, after sundry practisings by stealth, had\r\nfor the first time assembled to play \"Rule Britannia.\" What, indeed,\r\nwith the occasional abrupt checks, wild flourishes, and fantastic\r\nvariations caused by the ship's roll; and what with the attitudes\r\noverhead, of holding on refractory hats and caps, of intensely\r\nresisting and staggering legs, or of sudden pausing above the slope\r\nwhich one moment before was an ascent, there was additional force in\r\nthe designation quaintly given to such an aspect of things by the\r\nfore-mast Jacks--that of \"a cuddy jig.\" As the still-increasing\r\nmotion, however, shook into side-places this central group of cadets,\r\ncivilians, and planters adrift, the grander features of the scene\r\npredominated: the broad mass of the ship's hull--looming now across\r\nand now athwart the streak of sinking light behind--drawn out by the\r\nweltering outline of the waters; the entire length of her white decks,\r\never and anon exposed to view, with their parallel lines, their\r\nnautical appurtenances, the cluster of hardy men about the windlass,\r\nthe two or three \"old salts\" rolling to and fro along the gangway, and\r\nthe variety of forms blending into both railings of the poop. High out\r\nof, and over all, rose the lofty upper outline of the noble ship,\r\nstatelier and statelier as the dusk closed in about her--the expanse\r\nof canvass whitening with sharper edge upon the gloom; the hauled-up\r\nclues of the main-course, with their huge blocks, swelling and lifting\r\nto the fair wind--and the breasts of the topsails divided by their\r\ntightened bunt-lines, like the shape of some full-bosomed maiden, on\r\nwhich the reef-points heaved like silken fringes, as if three sisters,\r\nshadowy and goddess-like, trod in each other's steps towards the\r\ndeeper solitude of the ocean; while the tall spars, the interlacing\r\ncomplicated tracery, and the dark top-hamper showing between, gave\r\ngraceful unity to her figure; and her three white trucks, far\r\noverhead, kept describing a small clear arc upon the deep blue zenith\r\nas she rolled: the man at the wheel midway before the doors of the\r\npoop-cabin, with the light of the binnacle upon his broad throat and\r\nbearded chin, was looking aloft at a single star that had come out\r\nbeyond the clue of the main-topsail.\r\n\r\nThe last stroke of \"six bells\" or seven o'clock, which had begun to be\r\nstruck on the ship's bell when Old Jack broke off his story, still\r\nlingered on the ear as he brought up close to the starboard\r\nquarter-gallery, where a little green shed or pent-house afforded\r\nsupport and shelter to the ladies with the captain. The erect figure\r\nof the latter, as he lightly held one of his fair guests by the arm,\r\nwhile pointing out to her some object astern, still retained the\r\nattitude which had last caught the eyes of the forecastle group. The\r\nmusical cadets had just begun to pass from \"Rule Britannia\" to \"Shades\r\nof Evening;\" and the old sailor, with his glazed hat in his hand,\r\nstood waiting respectfully for the captain's notice. The ladies,\r\nhowever, were gazing intently down upon the vessel's wake, where the\r\nvast shapes of the waves now sank down into a hollow, now rose\r\nseething up into the rudder-trunk, but all marked throughout with one\r\nbroad winding track, where the huge body of the ship had swiftly\r\npassed. From foaming whiteness it melted into yesty green, that became\r\nin the hollow a path of soft light, where the sparks mingled like\r\ngolden seed; the wave-tops glimmered beyond: star-like figures floated\r\nup or sank in their long undulations; and the broad swell that heaped\r\nitself on a sudden under the mounting stern bore its bells, and\r\nbubbles, and flashes, upwards to the eye. When the ship rose high and\r\nsteady upon it, and one saw down her massy taffrail, it looked to a\r\nterrestrial eye rather like some mystic current issuing from the\r\narchway under a tall tower, whose foundations rocked and heaved: and\r\nso said the romantic girl beside the captain, shuddering at the\r\nvividness of an image which so incongruously brought together the\r\nfathomless deep and the distant shores of solid old England. The eye\r\nof the seaman, however, suggested to him an image more akin to the\r\nprofession, as he directed his fair companion's attention to the\r\ntrough of the ship's furrow, where, against the last low gleam of\r\ntwilight, and by the luminous wake, could be seen a little flock of\r\nblack petrels, apparently running along it to catch what the mighty\r\nploughshare had turned up; while a gray gull or two hovered aslant\r\nover them in the blue haze. As he looked round, too, to aloft, he\r\nexchanged glances with the old sailor who had listened--an expression\r\nwhich even the ladies understood. \"Ah! Jacobs,\"--said the captain,\r\n\"get the lamp lighted in my cabin, and the tea-kettle aft. With the\r\nroll she has on her, 'twill be more ship-shape there than in the\r\ncuddy.\" \"Ay, ay, sir,\" said the old seaman. \"How does she head just\r\nnow, Jacobs?\" \"Sou'-west and by south, sir.\" \"She'd lie easier for the\r\nladies though,\" said the captain, knowing his steward was a favourite\r\nwith them, \"were the wind a point or two less fair. Our old\r\nacquaintance Captain Williamson, of the Seringapatam now, Jacobs,\r\nold-fashioned as he was, would have braced in his lee-yards only to\r\nsteady a lady's tea-cup.\" \"Ay, your honour,\" replied Jacobs, and his\r\nweather eye twinkled, \"and washed the fok'sle under, too! But ye know,\r\nsir, he'd got a reg'lar-built Nabob aboard, and a beauty besides!\"\r\n\"Ah, Mr Jacobs!\" exclaimed the romantic young lady, \"what was that? Is\r\nit one of your stories?\" \"Well, your ladyship, 'tis a bit of a yarn,\r\nno doubt, and some'at of a cur'ous one.\" \"Oh!\" said another of the\r\ncaptain's fair protégées, \"I _do_ love these 'yarns,' as you call\r\nthem; they are so expressive, so--and all that sort of thing!\"\r\n\"Nonsense, my love,\" said her mother; \"you don't understand them, and\r\n'tis better you should not,--they are low, and contain a great many\r\nbad words, I fear.\" \"But think of the imagination, aunt,\" rejoined\r\nthe other girl, \"and the adventures! Oh, the ocean of all places for\r\nthat! Were it not for sea-sickness, I should dote upon it! As for the\r\n_storm_ just now, look how safe we are,--and see how the dear old ship\r\nrises up from the billows, with all her sails so delightfully\r\nmysterious one over another!\" \"Bless your heart, ma'rm, yes,\"\r\nresponded Old Jack, chuckling; \"you talks just like a seaman, beggin'\r\nyour pardon. As consarns the tea, sir, I make bould to expect the'll\r\nbe a shift o' wind directly, and a slant deck, as soon as we get fair\r\ninto the stream, rid o' this bit of a bubble the tail of it kicks up\r\nhereabouts.\" \"Bear a hand, then, Jacobs,\" said the captain, \"and see\r\nall right below for the party in the cabin,--we shall be down in a few\r\nminutes.\" The captain stood up on the quarter-gallery, to peer round\r\ninto the dusk and watch the lifting of the main-royal; but the next\r\nminute he called to the ladies, and their next neighbours, to look\r\ntowards the larboard bow, and see the moon rise. A long edge of gray\r\nhaze lay around the eastern horizon, on which the dark rim of the sea\r\nwas defined beyond the roll of the waves, as with the sweep of a soft\r\nbrush dipped in indigo; while to westward it heaved up, weltering in\r\nits own watery light against the gloom. From behind this low fringe of\r\nvapour was silently diffusing, as it were, a pool of faint radiance,\r\nlike a brook babbling from under ice; a thread of silver ran along the\r\nline of haze, growing keener at one point, until the arch of the moon\r\nshot slowly up, broad and fair; the wave-heads rising between were\r\ncrested here and there with light; the bow of the ship, the bellies of\r\nher fore-canvass, her bowsprit with the jibs hanging idly over it, and\r\nthe figure-head beneath, were tinged by a gentle lustre, while the\r\nhollow shadows stole out behind. The distant horizon, meanwhile, still\r\nlay in an obscure streak, which blended into the dark side of the low\r\nfog-bank, so as to give sea and cloud united the momentary appearance\r\nof one of those long rollers that turn over on a beach, with their\r\nglittering crest: you would expect to see next instant what actually\r\nseemed to take place--the whole outline plashing over in foam, and\r\nspreading itself clearly forward, as soon as the moon was free. With\r\nthe airy space that flowed from her came out the whole eastern\r\nsea-board, liquid and distinct, as if beyond either bow of the lifting\r\nIndiaman one sharp finger of a pair of compasses had flashed round,\r\ndrawing a semicircle upon the dull background, still cloudy,\r\nglimmering, and obscure. From the waves that undulated towards her\r\nstern, the ship was apparently entering upon a smoother zone, where\r\nthe small surges leapt up and danced in moonshine, resembling more the\r\ncurrent of some estuary in a full tide. To north-westward, just on the\r\nskirts of the dark, one wing of a large, soft-gray vapour was newly\r\nsmitten by the moon-gleam; and over against it on the south-east,\r\nwhere the long fog-bank sank away, there stretched an expanse of ocean\r\nwhich, on its farthest verge, gave out a tint of the most delicate\r\nopal blue. The ship, to the south-westward of the Azores, and going\r\nlarge before the trade-wind, was now passing into the great Gulf\r\nStream which there runs to the south-east; even the passengers on deck\r\nwere sensible of the rapid transition with which the lately cold\r\nbreeze became warmer and fitful, and the motion of the vessel easier.\r\nThey were surprised, on looking into the waves alongside, to perceive\r\nthem struggling, as it were, under a trailing net-work of sea-weed;\r\nwhich, as far as one could distinctly see, appeared to keep down the\r\nmasses of water like so much oil--flattening their crests,\r\nneutralising the force of the wind, and communicating a strangely\r\nsombre green to the heaving element. In the winding track of the\r\nship's wake the eddies now absolutely blazed: the weeds she had\r\ncrushed down rose to the surface again in gurgling circles of flame,\r\nand the showers of sparks came up seething on either side amongst the\r\nstalks and leaves: but as the moonlight grew more equally diffused it\r\nwas evident she was only piercing an arm of that local weed-bed here\r\nformed, like an island, in the _bight_ of the stream. Farther ahead\r\nwere scattered patches and bunches of the true Florida Gulf-weed,\r\nwhite and moss-like; which, shining crisp in the level moonlight, and\r\ntipping the surges as it floated past, gave them the aspect of\r\nhoary-bearded waves, or the garlanded horses of Neptune. The sight\r\nstill detained the captain's party on deck, and some of the ladies\r\ninnocently thought these phenomena indicative of the proximity of\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\"I have seldom seen the Stream so distinct hereabouts,\" said Captain\r\nCollins to his first officer, who stood near, having charge of the\r\nwatch. \"Nor I, sir,\" replied the chief mate; \"but it no doubt narrows\r\nwith different seasons. There goes a flap of the fore-topsail, though!\r\nThe wind fails, sir.\" \"'Tis only drawing ahead, I think,\" said the\r\ncaptain; \"the stream _sucks_ the wind with its heat, and we shall have\r\nit pretty near from due nor'-west immediately.\" \"Shall we round in on\r\nthe starboard hand, then, sir, and keep both wind and current _aft_?\"\r\n\"I think not, Mr Wood,\" said the captain. \"'Twould give us a good three\r\nknots more every hour of the next twenty-four, sir,\" persisted the\r\nfirst officer eagerly--and chief mates generally confine their theories\r\nto mere immediate progress. \"Yes,\" rejoined the captain, \"but we should\r\nlose hold of the 'trade' on getting out of the stream again. I intend\r\ndriving her across, with the nor'wester on her starboard beam, so as to\r\nlie well up afterwards. Get the yards braced to larboard as you catch\r\nthe breeze, Mr Wood, and make her course south-west by west.\" \"Very\r\nwell, sir.\" \"Ladies,\" said the captain, \"will you allow me to hand you\r\nbelow, where I fear Jacobs will be impatient with the tea?\" \"What a\r\npity, Captain Collins,\" remarked the romantic Miss Alicia, looking up\r\nas they descended the companion--\"what a pity that you cannot have that\r\ndelicious moonlight to shine in at your cabin windows just now; the\r\nsailors yonder have it all to themselves.\" \"There is no favour in these\r\nthings at sea, Miss Alicia,\" said the captain, smiling. \"Jack shares\r\nthe chance there, at least, with his betters; but I can promise those\r\nwho honour my poor suite this evening both fine moonshine and a\r\nsteadier floor.\" On reaching the snug little after-cabin, with its\r\nswinging lamp and barometer, its side \"state-room,\" seven feet long,\r\nand its two stern-windows showing a dark glimpse of the rolling waters,\r\nthey found the tea-things set, nautical style, on the hard-a-weather,\r\nboxed-up table--the surgeon and one or two elderly gentlemen waiting,\r\nand old Jacobs still trimming up the sperm-oil light. Mrs St Clair,\r\npresiding in virtue of relationship to their host, was still cautiously\r\npouring out the requisite half-cups, when, above all the bustle and\r\nclatter in the cuddy, could be heard the sounds of ropes thrown down on\r\ndeck, of the trampling watch, and the stentorian voice of the first\r\nofficer. \"Jacobs!\" said the captain, a minute or two afterwards; and\r\nthat worthy factotum instantly appeared from his pantry alongside of\r\nthe door--from whence, by the way, the old seaman might be privy to the\r\nwhole conversation--\"stand by to _dowse_ the lamp when she heels,\" an\r\norder purposely mysterious to all else but the doctor. Every one soon\r\nfelt a change in the movement of their wave-borne habitation; the\r\nrolling lift of her stern ceased; those who were looking into their\r\ncups saw the tea apparently take a decided inclination to larboard--as\r\nthe facetious doctor observed, a \"tendency to _port_.\" The floor\r\ngradually sloped down to the same hand, and a long, wild, gurgling wash\r\nwas suddenly heard to run careering past the timbers of the starboard\r\nside. \"Dear me!\" fervently exclaimed every lady at once; when the very\r\nnext moment the lamp went out, and all was darkness. Captain Collins\r\nfelt a little hand clutch his arm in nervous terror, but the fair owner\r\nof it said nothing; until, with still more startling effect than\r\nbefore, in a few seconds there shot through both stern-windows the full\r\nrays of the moon, pouring their radiance into the cabin, shining on the\r\nbacks of the books in the hanging shelves by the bulkhead, on the faces\r\nof the party, and the bald forehead of old Jacobs \"standing by\" the\r\nlamp,--lastly, too, revealing the pretty little Alicia with her hand on\r\nthe captain's arm, and her pale terrified face. \"Don't be alarmed,\r\nladies!\" said the surgeon, \"she's only hauled on the starboard tack!\"\r\n\"And her counter to the east,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"But who the dev--old gentleman, I mean--put out the lamp?\" rejoined\r\nthe doctor. \"Ah,--I see sir!--'But when the moon, refulgent lamp of\r\nnight.'\" \"Such a surprise!\" exclaimed the ladies, laughing, although\r\nas much frightened for a moment by the magical illumination as by the\r\nprevious circumstances. \"You see,\" said the captain, \"we are not like\r\na house,--we can bring round our scenery to any window we choose.\"\r\n\"Very prettily imagined it was, too, I declare!\" observed a stout old\r\nBombay officer, \"and a fine compliment to the ladies, by Jove, sir!\"\r\n\"If we had any of your pompous Bengal '_Quy hies_' here though,\r\ncolonel,\" said the doctor, \"they wouldn't stand being choused so\r\nunceremoniously out of the weather-side, I suspect.\" \"As to the\r\nagreeable little surprise I meant for the ladies,\" said Captain\r\nCollins, \"I fear it was done awkwardly, never having commanded an\r\n_Indiaman_ before, and laid up ashore this half-a-dozen years. But\r\none's old feelings get freshened up, and without knowing the old\r\nGloucester's points, I can't help reckoning her as a lady too,--a very\r\nparticular old 'Begum,' that won't let any one else be humoured before\r\nherself,--especially as I took charge of her to oblige a friend.\" \"How\r\neasily she goes now!\" said the doctor, \"and a gallant sight at this\r\nmoment, I assure you, to any one who chooses to put his head up the\r\ncompanion.\" \"Ah, mamma!\" said one of the girls, \"couldn't you almost\r\nthink this was our own little parlour at home, with the moonlight\r\ncoming through the window on both sides of the old elm, where we were\r\nsitting a month ago hearing about India and papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" responded her cousin, standing up, \"but there was no track of\r\nmoonshine dancing beyond the track of the ship yonder! How blue the\r\nwater is, and how much warmer it has grown of a sudden!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are crossing the great Gulf Stream!\" said the captain,--\"Jacobs!\r\nopen one of the stern-ports.\" \"'Tis the very place and time, this is,\"\r\nremarked a good-humoured cotton-grower from the Deckan, \"for one of\r\nthe colonel's tiger-hunts, now!\" \"Sir!\" answered the old officer,\r\nrather testily, \"I am not accustomed to thrust my _tiger-hunts_, as\r\nyou choose to call my humble experiences, under people's noses!\"\r\n\"Certainly not, my dear sir,\" said the planter,--\"but what do you say,\r\nladies, to one of the captain's sea-yarns, then? Nothing better, I'm\r\nsure, here and now, sir--eh?\" Captain Collins smiled, and said he had\r\nnever spun a yarn in his life, except when a boy, out of\r\nmatter-of-fact old junk and tar. \"Here is my steward, however,\"\r\ncontinued he, \"who is the best hand at it I know,--and I daresay he'll\r\ngive you one.\" \"Charming!\" exclaimed the young ladies; and \"What was\r\nthat adventure, Mr Jacobs,\" said Miss Alicia, \"with a beauty and a\r\nNabob in it, that you alluded to a short time ago?\" \"I didn't to say\r\ndisactly include upon it, your ladyship,\" replied old Jacobs, with a\r\ntug of his hair, and a bow not just _à la maître_; \"but the captain\r\ncan give you it better nor I can, seeing as his honur were the Nero on\r\nit, as one may say.\" \"Oh!\" said the surgeon, rubbing his hands \"a lady\r\nand a rupee-eater in the case!\" \"Curious stories, there _are_, too,\"\r\nremarked the colonel, \"of those serpents of nautch-girls, and rich\r\nfools they've managed to entangle. As for beauty, sir, they have the\r\ndevil's, and they'd melt the 'Honourable John's' own revenue! I know a\r\nvery sensible man,--shan't mention his name,--but made of rupees, and\r\na regular _beebee-hater_,--saw one of these--\" \"Hush, hush, my dear\r\nsir!\" interrupted the planter, winking and gesticulating; \"very good\r\nfor the weather poop,--but presence of ladies!\"--\"For which I'm not\r\nfit, you'd say, sir?\" inquired the colonel, firing up again. \"Oh! oh!\r\nyou know, colonel!\" said the unlucky planter, deprecatingly. \"But a\r\n_godown_[7] of best 'Banda' to a cowrie now, the sailor makes his\r\nbeauty a complete Nourmahal, with rose-lips and moon-eyes,--and his\r\nNabob a _jehan punneh_,[8] with a _crore_, besides diamonds. 'Twould\r\nbe worth hearing, especially from a lascar. For, 'twixt you and I,\r\ncolonel, we know how rare it is to hear of a man who saves his _lac_,\r\nnow-a-days, with Yankees in the market, no Nawaubs to fight, and\r\nreform in _cutcheries_[9]!\" \"There seems something curious about this\r\nsaid adventure of yours, my dear captain,\" said Mrs St Clair,\r\narchly,--\"and a Beauty too! It makes me positively inquisitive, but I\r\nhope your fair lady has heard the story?\" \"Why, not exactly, ma'am,\"\r\nreplied Captain Collins, laughing as he caught the doctor looking\r\npreternaturally solemn, after a sly lee-wink to the colonel; who,\r\nhaving his back to the moonlight, stretched out his legs and indulged\r\nin a grim, silent chuckle, until his royal-tiger countenance was\r\nunhappily brought so far _flush_[10] in the rays as to betray a\r\nsingular daguerreotype, resembling one of those cut-paper\r\nphantasmagoria thrown on a drawing-room wall, unmistakably black and\r\nwhite, and in the character of Malicious Watchfulness. The rubicund,\r\nfidgety little cotton-grower twiddled his thumbs, and looked modestly\r\ndown on the deck, with half-shut eyes, as if expecting some bold\r\nrevelation of nautical depravity; while the romantic Miss Alicia\r\ncoloured and was silent. \"However,\" said the captain, coolly, \"it is\r\nno matrimonial secret, at any rate! We both think of it when we read\r\nthe Church Service of a Sunday night at home, with Jacobs for the\r\nclerk.\" \"Do, Mr Jacobs, oblige us!\" requested the younger of the\r\ngirls. \"Well, Miss,\" said he, smoothing down his hair in the doorway,\r\nand hemming, \"'Tan't neither for the likes o' me to refuse a lady, nor\r\naccordin' to rules for to give such a yarn in presence of a supperior\r\nofficer, much less the captain,--with a midship helm, ye know marm, ye\r\ncarn't haul upon one tack nor the other. Not to say but next forenoon\r\nwatch----\" \"I see, Jacobs, my man,\" interrupted Captain Collins,\r\n\"there's nothing for it but to fore-reach upon you, or else you'll be\r\n'Green-Handing' me aft as well as forward; so I must just make the\r\nbest of it, and take the _winch_ in my own fashion at once!\" \"Ay, ay,\r\nsir--ay, ay, your honour!\" said Old Jack demurely, and concealing his\r\ngratification as he turned off into the pantry, with the idea of for\r\nthe first time hearing the captain relate the incidents in question.\r\n\"My old shipmate,\" said the latter, \"is so fond of having trained his\r\nfuture captain, that it is his utmost delight to spin out everything\r\nwe ever met with together into one endless yarn, which would go on\r\nfrom our first acquaintance to the present day, although no ship's\r\ncompany ever heard the last of it. Without falling knowingly to\r\nleeward of the truth, he makes out every lucky coincidence, almost, to\r\nhave been a feat of mine, and puts in little fancies of his own, so as\r\nto give the whole thing more and more of a marvellous air, the farther\r\nit goes. The most amusing thing is, that he almost always begins each\r\ntime, I believe, at the very beginning, like a capstan without a\r\npaul--sticking in one thing he had forgot before, and forgetting\r\nanother; sometimes dwelling longer on one part--a good deal like a\r\nship making the same voyages over again. I knew, now, this evening,\r\nwhen I heard the men laughing, and saw Old Jack on the forecastle,\r\nwhat must be in the wind. However, we have shared so many chances, and\r\nI respect the old man so much, not to speak of his having dandled my\r\nlittle girls on his knee, and being butler, steward, and\r\nflower-gardener at home, that I can't really be angry at him, in spite\r\nof the sort of every man's rope he makes of me!\" \"How very amusing a\r\ncharacter he is!\" said one young lady. \"A thought too tarry, perhaps?\"\r\nsuggested the surgeon. \"So very original and like a--seaman!\" remarked\r\nMiss Alicia, quietly, but as if some other word that crossed her mind\r\nhad been rejected, as descriptive of a different variety, probably\r\nhigher. \"_Original_, by Jove!\" exclaimed the colonel; \"if my\r\n_Khansa-man_, or my _Abdar_,[11] were to make such a dancing dervish\r\nand _tumasha_[12] of me behind back, by the holy Vishnu, sir, I'd\r\nrattan him myself within an inch of his life!\" \"Not an unlikely thing,\r\ncolonel,\" put in the planter; \"I've caught the scoundrels at that\r\ntrick before now.\" \"What did you do?\" inquired the colonel,\r\nspeculatively. \"Couldn't help laughing, for my soul, sir; the\r\n_puckree bund_[13] rascals did it so well, and so funnily!\" The\r\nirascible East-Indian almost started up in his imaginative fury, to\r\ncall for his palkee, and chastise his whole verandah, when the doctor\r\nreminded him it was a long way there. \"Glorious East!\" exclaimed the\r\nmedico, looking out astern, \"where we may cane our footmen, and\r\nwhence, meanwhile, we can derive such Sanscrit-sounding adjurations,\r\nwith such fine moonlight!\"\r\n\r\nThe presence of the first officer was now added to the party, who came\r\ndown for a cup of tea, fresh from duty, and flavouring strongly of a\r\npilot cheroot. \"How does she head, Mr Wood?\" asked the captain.\r\n\"Sou'-west by west, sir,--a splendid night, under everything that will\r\ndraw,--spray up to the starboard cat-head!\"\r\n\r\n\"But as to this story, again, Captain Collins?\" said Mrs St Clair, as\r\nsoon as she had poured out the chief mate's cup. \"Well,\" said the\r\ncaptain, \"if you choose to listen till bedtime to a plain draught of\r\nthe affair, why I suppose I must tell it you; and what remains then\r\nmay stand over till next fine night. It _may_ look a little romantic,\r\nbeing in the days when most people are such themselves; but at any\r\nrate, we sailors--or else we should never have been at sea, you know:\r\nand so you'll allow for that, and a spice to boot of what we used to\r\ncall at sea 'love-making;' happily there were no soft speeches in it,\r\nlike those in books, for then I shouldn't tell it at all.\r\n\r\nBy the time I was twenty-four, I had been nine years at sea, and, at\r\nthe end of the war, was third lieutenant of a crack twenty-eight, the\r\nsaucy Iris--as perfect a sloop-model, though over-sparred certainly, as\r\never was cased off the ways at Chatham, or careened to a north-easter.\r\nThe Admiralty had learnt to build by that day, and a glorious ship she\r\nwas, _made_ for going after the small fry of privateers, pirates, and\r\nslavers, that swarmed about the time. Though I had roughed it in all\r\nsorts of craft, from a first-rate to a dirty French lugger prize, and\r\nhad been eastward, so as to see the sea in its pride at the Pacific,\r\nyet the feeling you have depends on the kind of ship you are in. I\r\nnever knew so well what it was to be fond of a ship and the sea; and\r\nwhen I heard of the poor Iris, that had never been used to anything but\r\nblue water on three parts of the horizon at least, laying her bones not\r\nlong after near Wicklow Head, I couldn't help a gulp in the throat. I\r\nonce dreamt I had gone down in her, and risen again to the surface with\r\nthe _loss of something_ in my brain; while, at the same moment, there I\r\nwas, still sitting below on a locker in the wardroom, with the arms of\r\nher beautiful figure-head round me, and her mermaid's tail like the\r\nbest-bower cable, with an anchor at the end of it far away out of\r\nsoundings, over which I bobbed and dipped for years and years, in all\r\nweathers, like a buoy. We had no Mediterranean time of it, though, in\r\nthe Iris, off the Guinea coast, from Cape Palmas to Cape Negro: looking\r\nout to windward for white squalls, and to leeward for black ones, and\r\ninshore for Spanish cattle-dealers, as we called them, had made us all\r\nas sharp as so many marlin-spikes; and our captain was a man that\r\ntaught us seamanship, with a trick or two beyond. The slavers had not\r\ngot to be so clever then, either, with their schooners and clippers;\r\nthey built for stowage, and took the chance, so that we sent in _bale_\r\nafter bale to the West India Admiral, made money, and enjoyed ourselves\r\nnow and then at the Cape de Verds. However, this kind of thing was so\r\npopular at home, as pickings after the great haul was over, that the\r\nIris had to give up her station to a post-frigate, and be paid off. The\r\nwar was over, and nobody could expect to be promoted without a friend\r\nnear the blue table-cloth, although a quiet hint to a secretary's palm\r\nwould work wonders, if strong enough. But most of such lucky fellows as\r\nourselves dissipated their funds in blazing away at balls and parties,\r\nwhere the gold band was everything, and the ladies wore blue ribbons\r\nand anchor brooches in honour of the navy. The men spent everything in\r\na fortnight, even to their clothes, and had little more chance of\r\neating the king's biscuit with hopes of prize-money; I used to see\r\nknots of them, in red shirts and dirty slops, amongst the fore-mast\r\nJacks in outwardbound ships, dropping past Greenwich, and waving their\r\nhats to the Hospital. You knew them at once by one of them giving the\r\nsong for the topsail halliards, instead of the merchantmen's bull's\r\nchorus: indeed, I could always pick off the dashing man-o'-war's men,\r\nby face and eye alone, out from among the others, who looked as sober\r\nand solitary, with their serious faces and way of going about a thing,\r\nas if every one of them was the whole crew. I once read a bit of poetry\r\ncalled the \"Ancient Mariner,\" to old Jacobs, who by the bye is\r\nsomething of a breed betwixt the two kinds, and his remark was--\"That\r\nold chap warn't used to hoisting all together with a run, your honour!\r\nBy his looks, I'd say he was bred where there was few in a watch, and\r\nthe watch-tackle laid out pretty often for an eke to drag down the\r\nfore-tack.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was riding down to Croydon in Surrey, where my mother and sister\r\nhad gone to live, I fell in with a sample of the hard shifts the\r\nmen-o-war's-men were put to in getting across from harbour to some\r\nmerchant port, when all their earnings were chucked away. It was at a\r\nlittle town called Bromley, where I brought to by the door of a tavern\r\nand had a drink for the horse, with a bottle of cider for myself at\r\nthe open window, the afternoon being hot. There was a crowd of\r\ntownspeople at the other end of the street, country bumpkins and\r\nboys--women looking out at the windows, dogs barking, and children\r\nshouting--the whole concern bearing down upon us.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this?\" said I to the ostler.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know, sir,\" said he, scratching his head; \"'tis very hodd, sir!\r\nThat corner _is_ rather a sharp turn for the coach, sir, and she do\r\nsometimes run over a child there, or somethink. But 'taint her time\r\nyet! Nothink else hever 'appens 'ere, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could hear or see distinctly for the confusion, I observed\r\nthe magnet of it to be a party of five or six regular blue-jackets, a\r\ngood deal battered in their rig, who were roaring out sea-songs in\r\ngrand style as they came along, leading what I thought at first was a\r\nbear. The chief words I heard were what I knew well. \"We'll disregard\r\ntheir tommy-hawks, likewise their scalping-knifes--and fight alongside\r\nof our mates to save our precious lives--like British tars and\r\nsouldiers in the North Americay!\"\r\n\r\nOn getting abreast of the inn-door, and finding an offing with good\r\nholding-ground, I suppose, they hove to and struck up the \"Buffalo,\"\r\nthat finest of chaunts for the weather forecastle with a spanking\r\nbreeze, outward bound, and the pilot lately dropped--\r\n\r\n    \"Come all you young men and maidens, that _wishes_ for to sail,\r\n    And I will let you hear of where you must a-roam!\r\n    We'll embark into a ship which her taups'ls is let fall,\r\n    And all unto an ileyand where we never will go home!\r\n    Especiallye you _ladies_ that's inclined for to rove--\r\n    There's _fishes_ in the sea, my love--likewise the buck an' doe,\r\n    We'll lie down--on the _banks_--of yon pleasant shadye gro-ove,\r\n    Through the wild woods we'll wander and we'll chase the\r\n            Buffalo--ho--ho--we'll\r\n    Chase the BuffalO!\"\r\n\r\nI really couldn't help laughing to see the slapping big-bearded\r\nfellows, like so many foretopmen, showing off in this manner--one\r\nmahogany-faced thorough-bred leading, the rest thundering in at the\r\nchorus, with tremendous stress on the 'Lo-ho-ho,' that made the good\r\nBromley folks gape. As to singing for money, however, I knew no true\r\ntar with his members whole would do it; and I supposed it to be merely\r\nsome 'spree ashore,' until the curious-looking object from behind was\r\nlugged forward by a couple of ropes, proving to be a human figure\r\nabout six feet high, with a rough canvass cover as far as the knees.\r\nWhat with three holes at the face, and the strange colour of the legs,\r\nwhich were bare--with the pair of turned-up India shoes, and the whole\r\nshape like a walking smoke-funnel over a ship's caboose--I was puzzled\r\nwhat they would be at. The leading tar immediately took off his hat,\r\nwaved it round for a clear space, and gave a hem while he pointed to\r\nthe mysterious creature. \"Now, my lads!\" said he, \"this here\r\nwonderful bein' is a savitch we brought aboard of us from the Andyman\r\nIsles, where he was caught one mornin' paddling round the ship in a\r\ncanoe made out of the bark of a sartain tree. Bein' the ownly spice of\r\nthe sort brought to this country as yet is, and we havin' run short of\r\nthe needful to take us to the next port, we expects every lady and\r\ngemman as has the wherewithal, will give us a lift, by consideration\r\nof this same cur'ous sight, and doesn't----\" \"Heave ahead, Tom, lad!\"\r\nsaid another encouragingly, as the sailor brought up fairly out of\r\nbreath--\"Doesn't want no man's money for nou't d'ye see, but all fair\r\nan' above board. We're not agoin' to show this here sight excep' you\r\nmakes up half-a-guinea amongst ye--arter that, all hands may see\r\nshot-free--them's the articles!\" \"Ay, ay, Tom, well said, old ship!\"\r\nobserved the rest; and, after a considerable clinking of coin amongst\r\nthe crowd, the required sum was poured, in pence and sixpences, into\r\nTom's hat. \"All right!\" said he, as soon as he had counted it,--\"hoist\r\naway the tarpaulin, mates!\" For my part, I was rather surprised at the\r\nrare appearance of this said savage, when his cover was off--his legs\r\nand arms naked, his face streaked with yellow, and both parts the\r\ncolour of red boom-varnish; his red hair done up in a tuft, with\r\nfeathers all round it, and a bright feather-tippet over his shoulders,\r\nas he stood, six feet in his yellow slippers, and looking sulkily\r\nenough at the people. \"Bobbery puckalow!\" said the nautical\r\nhead-showman, and all at once up jumped the Andaman islander, dancing\r\nfuriously, holding a little Indian _punkah_ over his head, and\r\nflourishing with the other hand what reminded me strongly of a ship's\r\ntop-maul--shouting \"Goor--goor--gooree!\" while two of the sailors held\r\non by the ropes. The crowd made plenty of room, and Tom proceeded to\r\nexplain to them very civilly, that \"in them parts 'twas so hot the\r\nnatives wouldn't fight, save under a portable awning.\" Having\r\nexhibited the points of their extraordinary savage, he was calmed\r\nagain by another uncouth word of command, when the man-o'-war's-man\r\nattempted a further _traverse_ on the good Bromley folks, for which I\r\ngave him great credit. \"Now, my lads and lasses,\" said he, taking off\r\nhis hat again, \"I s'pose you're all British subjects and Englishmen!\"\r\nat which there was a murmur of applause. \"Very good, mates all!\"\r\ncontinued the foretopman approvingly.--\"Then, in course, ye knows as\r\nhow whatsomever touches British ground is _free_!\" \"Britons never,\r\nnever shall be slaves!\" sung out a boy, and the screaming and\r\nhurrahing was universal. Tom stuck his tongue in his cheek to his\r\nmessmates, and went on,--\"Though we was all pressed ourselves, and has\r\nknocked about in sarvice of our king and country, an' bein' poor men,\r\nwe honours the flag, my lads!\" \"Hoorah! hoorah! hoorr-ray!\" \"So you\r\nsee, gemmen, my shipmates an' me has come to the resolve of lettin'\r\nthis here wild savidge go free into the woods,--though, bein' poor\r\nmen, d'ye see, we hopes ye'll make it up to us a bit first! What d'ye\r\nsay, all hands?--slump together for the other guinea, will ye, and off\r\nhe goes this minute,--and d---- the odds! Eh? what d'ye say,\r\nshipmates?\" \"Ay, ay, Tom, sink the damage too!\" said his comrades;\r\n\"we'll always get a berth at Blackwall, again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to ease off his tow-lines, then,\" said Tom,--\"now look sharp\r\nwith the shiners there, my lads--ownly a guinea!\" \"No! no!\" murmured\r\nthe townspeople,--\"send for the constable!--we'll all be scalped and\r\nmurdered in our beds!--no, no, for God's sake, mister sailors!\" A\r\ngrocer ran out of his door to beg the tars wouldn't think of such a\r\nthing, and the village constable came shoving himself in, with the\r\nbeadle. \"Come, come,\" said the constable in a soothing style, while\r\nthe beadle tried to look big and blustering, \"you musn't do it, my\r\ngood men,--not on no desideration, _here_,--in his majesty's name!\r\nTake un on to the next parish!--I horder all good subjects to resist\r\nme!\" \"_What!_\" growled the foretopman, with an air of supreme disgust,\r\n\"han't ye no feelin's for liberty hereaway? Parish be blowed! Bill, my\r\nlad, let go his moorings, and give the poor devil his nat'ral\r\nfreedom!\" \"I'm right down ashamed on my country,\" said Bill. \"Hullo,\r\nshipmates, cast off at once, an' never mind the loss,--I hasn't slept\r\neasy myself sin' he wor cotched!\" \"Nor me either,\" said another, \"but\r\nI'm feared he'll play the devil when he's loose, mate.\"\r\n\r\nI had been watching the affair all this time from inside, a good deal\r\namused, in those days, at the trick--especially so well carried out as\r\nit was by the sailors. \"Here, my fine fellows,\" said I at last, \"bring\r\nhim in, if you please, and let me have a look at him.\" Next minute in\r\ncame the whole party, and, supposing from my dress that I was merely a\r\nlong-shore traveller, they put their savage through his dance with\r\ngreat vigour. \"Wonderful tame he's got, your honour!\" said the\r\ntop-man; \"it's nothing to what he does if you freshens his nip.\" \"What\r\ndoes he eat?\" I asked, pretending not to understand the hint. \"Why,\r\nnought to speak on, sir,\" said he; \"but we wonst lost a boy doorin'\r\nthe cruise, nobody know'd how--though 'twas thought he went o'board,\r\nsome on us had our doubts.\" \"Curiously tatooed, too,\" I said; \"I\r\nshould like to examine his arm.\" \"A bit obstropolous he is, your\r\nhonour, if you handles him!\" \"Never mind,\" said I, getting up and\r\nseizing the wrist of the Andaman islander, in spite of his grins; and\r\nmy suspicions were immediately fulfilled by seeing a whole range of\r\nfamiliar devices marked in blue on the fellow's arm--amongst them an\r\nanchor with a heart transfixed by a harpoon, on one side the word\r\n\"Sal,\" and on the other \"R.O. 1811.\" \"Where did you steal this\r\ntop-maul, you rascal?\" said I, coolly looking in his face; while I\r\nnoticed one of the men overhauling me suspiciously out of his\r\nweather-eye, and sidling to the door. \"I didn't stale it at all!\"\r\nexclaimed the savage, giving his red head a scratch, \"'twas Bill Green\r\nthere--by japers! whack, pillalew, mates, I'm done!\" \"Lord! oh Lord!\"\r\nsaid Bill himself, quite crestfallen, \"if I didn't think 'twas him!\r\nWe're all pressed again, mates! It's _the_ leftenant!\" \"Pressed, bo'?\"\r\nsaid Tom; \"more luck, I wish we was--but they wouldn't take ye now for\r\na bounty, ye know.\" Here I was fain to slack down and give a hearty\r\nlaugh, particularly at recognising Bill, who had been a shipmate of\r\nJacobs and myself in the old Pandora, and was nicknamed \"Green\"--I\r\nbelieve from a little adventure of ours--so I gave the men a guinea\r\na-piece to carry them on. \"Long life to your honour!\" said they; and\r\nsaid Tom, \"If I might make so bould, sir, if your honour has got a\r\nship yet, we all knows ye, sir, and we'd enter, if 'twas for the North\r\nPole itself!\" \"No, my lad,\" said I, \"I'm sorry to say I have not got\r\nso far yet. Dykes, my man, can you tell me where your old messmate\r\nJacobs has got to?\" \"Why, sir,\" replied Bill, \"I did hear he was\r\nlivin' at Wapping with his wife, where we means to give him a call,\r\ntoo, sir.\" \"Good day, your honour!\" said all of them, as they put on\r\ntheir hats to go, and covered their curiosity again with his\r\ntarpaulin. \"I'm blessed, Bill,\" said Tom, \"but we'll knock off this\r\nhere carrivanning now, and put before the wind for Blackwall.\" \"Won't\r\nyou give your savage his freedom, then,\" I asked. \"Sartinly, your\r\nhonour,\" replied the roguish foretopman, his eye twinkling as he saw\r\nthat I enjoyed the joke. \"Now, Mick, my lad, ye must run like the\r\ndevil so soon as we casts ye off!\" \"Oh, by the powers, thry me!\" said\r\nthe Irishman; \"I'm tired o' this cannible minnatchery! By the holy\r\nmouse, though, I must have a dhrop o' dew in me, or I'll fall!\" Mick\r\naccordingly swigged off a noggin of gin, and declared himself ready to\r\nstart. \"Head due nor'-east from the sun, Mick, and we'll pick you up\r\nin the woods, and rig you out all square again,\" said the captain of\r\nthe gang, before presenting himself to the mob outside. \"Now, gemmen\r\nand ladies all,\" said the sailor coolly, \"ye see we're bent on givin'\r\nthis here poor unfort'nate his liberty--an' bein' tould we've got the\r\nlaw on our side, why, we means to do it. More by token, there's a\r\nleftenant in the Roy'l Navy aboard there, as has made up the little\r\nsalvage-money, bein' poor men, orderin' us for to do it--so look out!\r\nIf ye only gives him a clear offing, he'll not do no harm. Steady,\r\nBill--slack off the starboard sheet, Jack--let go--all!\" \"Oh!\r\noh!--no! no!--for God's sake!\" screamed the bystanders, as they\r\nscuttled off to both hands--\"shame! shame!--knock un down! catch\r\nun!--tipstaff! beadle!\" \"Hurrah!\" roared the boys, and off went Mick\r\nO'Hooney in fine style, flourishing his top-maul, with a wild\r\n\"hullaloo,\" right away over a fence, into a garden, and across a field\r\ntowards the nearest wood. Everybody fell out of his way as he dashed\r\non; then some running after him, dogs barking, and the whole of the\r\nseamen giving chase with their tarpaulins in their hands, as if to\r\ndrive him far enough into the country. The whole scene was extremely\r\nrich, seen through the open air from the tavern window, where I sat\r\nlaughing, till the tears came into my eyes, at Jack-tars' roguishness\r\nand the stupefied Kent rustics, as they looked to each other; then at\r\nthe sailors rolling away full speed along the edge of the plantation\r\nwhere the outlandish creature had disappeared; and, lastly, at the\r\ncanvass cover which lay on the spot where he had stood. They were\r\nactually consulting how to guard against possible inroads from the\r\nsavage at night, since he might be lurking near, when I mounted and\r\nrode off; I daresay even their hearing that I was a live and real\r\nlieutenant would cap the whole story.\r\n\r\nCroydon is a pretty, retired little town, so quiet and old-fashioned\r\nthat I enjoyed the unusual rest in it, and the very look of the canal,\r\nthe marketplace, the old English trees and people--by comparison with\r\neven the Iris's white decks, and her circumference of a prospect,\r\ndifferent as it was every morning or hour of the day. My mother and my\r\nsister Jane were so kind--they petted me so, and were so happy to have\r\nme down to breakfast and out walking, even to feel the smell of my\r\ncigar,--that I hardly knew where I was. I gave them an account of the\r\nplaces I had seen, with a few tremendous storms and a frigate-fight or\r\ntwo, instead of the horse-marine stories about mermaids and flying\r\nDutchmen I used to pass upon them when a conceited youngster. Little\r\nJane would listen with her ear to a large shell, when we were upon sea\r\nmatters, and shut her eyes, saying she could fancy the thing so\r\nperfectly in that way. Or was it about India, there was a painted\r\nsandal-wood fan carved in open-work like the finest lace, which she\r\nwould spread over her face, because the seeing through it, and its\r\nscent, made her feel as if she were in the tropics. As for my mother,\r\ngood simple woman, she was always between astonishment and horror,\r\nnever having believed that lieutenants would be so heartless as to\r\nmasthead a midshipman for the drunkenness of a boat's crew, nor being\r\nable to understand why, with a gale brewing to seaward, a captain\r\ntried to get his ship as far as he could from land. The idea of my\r\ngoing to sea again never entered her head, the terrible war being\r\nover, and the rank I had gained being invariably explained to visiters\r\nas at least equal to that of a captain amongst soldiers. To the\r\npresent day, this is the point with respect to seafaring matters on\r\nwhich my venerated and worthy parent is clearest: she will take off\r\nher gold spectacles, smoothing down her silver hair with the other\r\nhand, and lay down the law as to reform in naval titles, showing that\r\nmy captain's commission puts me on a level with a military colonel.\r\nHowever, as usual, I got tired by little and little of this sort of\r\nthing; I fancy there's some peculiar disease gets into a sailor's\r\nbrain that makes him uneasy with a firm floor and no offing beyond;\r\ncertainly the country about Croydon was to my mind, at that time, the\r\nworst possible,--all shut in, narrow lanes, high hedges and orchards,\r\nno sky except overhead, and no horizon. If I could only have got a\r\nhill, there would have been some relief in having a look-out from it.\r\nMoney I didn't need; and as for fame or rank, I neither had the\r\nambition, nor did I ever fancy myself intended for an admiral or a\r\nNelson: all my wish was to be up and driving about, on account of\r\nsomething that was _within_ me. I enjoyed a good breeze as some do\r\nchampagne; and the very perfection of glory, to my thinking, was to be\r\nthe soul of a gallant ship in a regular Atlantic howler; or to play at\r\nlong bowls with one's match to leeward, off the ridges of a sea, with\r\nboth weather and the enemy to think of. Accordingly, I wasn't at all\r\ninclined to go jogging along in one of your easy merchantmen, where\r\nyou have nothing new to find out; and I only waited to hear from some\r\nfriends who were bestirring themselves with the Board, of a ship where\r\nthere might be something to do. These were my notions in those days,\r\nbefore getting sobered down, which I tell you for the sake of not\r\nseeming such a fool in this said adventure.\r\n\r\nWell, one evening my sister Jane and I went to a race-ball at Epsom,\r\nwhere, of course, we saw all the \"beauty and fashion,\" as they say, of\r\nthe country round, with plenty of the army men, who were in all their\r\nglory, with Waterloo and all that; we two or three poor nauticals being\r\nquite looked down upon in comparison, since Nelson was dead, and we had\r\nleft nothing at the end to fight with. I even heard one belle ask a\r\ndragoon \"what uniform that was--was it the horse-artillery corps?\"\r\n\"Haw!\" said the dragoon, squinting at me through an eyeglass, and then\r\nlooking with one eye at his spurs and with the other at his partner,\r\n\"Not at all sure! I _do_ think, after all, Miss ----, 'tis the--the\r\nmarine body,--a sort of amphibious animals! They weren't with _us_,\r\nthough, you know,--_couldn't_ be, indeed, though it _was_ _Water_-loo!\r\nHaw! haw! you'll excuse the joke, Miss ----?\" \"Ha! ha! how extremely\r\nwitty, Captain ----!\" said the young lady, and they whirled away\r\ntowards the other end of the hall. But, had there been an opportunity,\r\nby the honour of the flag, and nothing personal, I declare I should\r\nhave done--what the fool deserved,--had it been before all his brethren\r\nand the Duke himself! It was not ten minutes after, that I saw what I\r\nthought the loveliest young creature ever crossed my eyes, coming out\r\nof the refreshment-room with two ladies, an old and an elderly one. The\r\nfirst was richly dressed, and I set her down for an aunt, she was so\r\nunlike; the other for a governess. The young lady was near sixteen to\r\nappearance, dressed in white. There were many beauties in the ball-room\r\nyou would have called handsomer; but there was something about her\r\naltogether I could compare to nothing else but the white figure-head of\r\nthe Iris, sliding gently along in the first curl of a breeze, with the\r\nmorning-sky far out on the bow,--curious as you may think it, ladies!\r\nHer hair was brown, and her complexion remarkably pale notwithstanding;\r\nwhile her eyes were as dark-blue, too, as--as the ocean near the line,\r\nthat sometimes, in a clear calm, gets to melt till you scarcely know it\r\nfrom the sky. \"Look, Edward!\" whispered my sister, \"what a pretty\r\ncreature! She can't be English, she looks so different from everybody\r\nin the room! And such diamonds in her hair! such a beautifully large\r\npearl in her brooch! Who can she be, I wonder?\" I was so taken up,\r\nhowever, that I never recollected at all what Jane said till at night,\r\nin thinking the matter over; and then a whole breeze of whisperings\r\nseemingly came from every corner of the bedroom, of \"Who is she!\" \"Who\r\ncan she be?\" \"Who's her father?\" and so on, which I remembered to have\r\nheard. I only noticed at the time that somebody said she was the\r\ndaughter of some rich East India Nabob or other, just come home. I had\r\nactually forgot about the young dragoon I meant to find out again,\r\nuntil a post-captain who was present--one of Collingwood's\r\nflag-lieutenants--went up to the old _chaperone_, whom he seemed to\r\nknow, and got into talk with her; I found afterwards she was an\r\nadmiral's widow. In a little I saw him introduced to the young lady,\r\nand ask her to dance; I fancied she hung back for a moment, but the\r\nnext she bowed, gave a slight smile to the captain's gallant\r\nsea-fashion of deep respect to the sex, and they were soon gliding away\r\nin the first set. Her dancing was more like walking with spread wings\r\nupon air, than upon planks with one's arms out, as the captain did. I'd\r\nhave given my eyes, not to speak of my commission and chances to come,\r\nto have gone through that figure with _her_. When the captain had\r\nhanded her to her seat again, two or three of the dragoons sauntered up\r\nto Lady Somers's sofa: it was plain they were taken; and after\r\nconversing with the old lady, one of them, Lord somebody I understood,\r\ngot introduced, in his turn, to the young beauty. As may be supposed, I\r\nkept a look-out for his asking her to dance, seeing that, if she had\r\ndone so with one of the embroidered crew, and their clattering gear,\r\nI'd have gone out that instant, found out the Waterloo fellow next day,\r\nand, if not shot myself, shot him with an anchor button for a bullet,\r\nand run off in the first craft I could get. The cool, easy, cursed\r\nimpertinent way this second man made his request, though--just as if he\r\ncouldn't be refused, and didn't care about it--it was as different from\r\nthe captain of the Diomede's as red from blue! My heart went like the\r\nmain-tack blocks, thrashing when you luff too much; so you may guess\r\nwhat I felt to see the young lady, who was leaning back on the sofa,\r\ngive her head a pettish sort of turn to the old one, without a\r\nword,--as much as to say she didn't want to. \"My love!\" I heard the old\r\nlady say, \"I fear you are tired! My lord, your lordship must excuse\r\nMiss Hyde on this occasion, as she is delicate!\" The dragoon was a\r\npolite nobleman, according to his cloth; so he kept on talking and\r\nsmiling, till he could walk off without seeming as if he'd got his\r\nsabre betwixt his feet; but I fancied him a little down by the head\r\nwhen he did go. All the time, the young beauty was sitting with her\r\nface as quiet and indifferent as may be, only there was a sparkle in\r\nher blue eyes, and in nothing else but the diamonds in her hair, as she\r\nlooked on at the dancing; and, to my eye, there was a touch of the rose\r\ncame out on her cheek, clear pale though it was before the dragoon\r\nspoke to her. Not long after, an oldish gentleman came out with a\r\ngray-haired old general from the refreshment-room: a thin,\r\nyellow-complexioned man he was, with no whiskers and a bald forehead,\r\nand a bilious eye, but handsome, and his face as grand and solemn\r\nlooking as if he'd been First Lord, or had got a whole court-martial on\r\nhis shoulders for next day. I should have known him from a thousand for\r\na man that had lived in the East, were it nothing but the quick way he\r\nlooked over his shoulder for a servant or two, when he wanted his\r\ncarriage called--no doubt just as one feels when he forgets he's\r\nashore, like I did every now and then, looking up out to windward, and\r\ngetting a garden-wall or a wood slap into one's eyesight, as 'twere. I\r\nlaid down the old gentleman at once for this said Nabob; in fact, as\r\nsoon as a footman told him his carriage was waiting, he walked up to\r\nthe young lady and her companions, and went off with them, a steward\r\nand a lady patroness convoying them to the break of the steps. The only\r\nnotion that ran in my head, on the way home that night with my sister,\r\nwas, \"By heavens! I might just as well be in love with the bit of sky\r\nat the end of the flying-jib-boom!\" and all the while, the confounded\r\nwheels kept droning it into me, till I was as dizzy as the first time I\r\nlooked over the fore-royal-yard. The whole night long I dreamt I was\r\nmad after the figure-head of the Iris, and asked her to dance with me,\r\non which she turned round with a look as cold as water, or plain \"No.\"\r\nAt last I caught firm hold of her and jumped overboard; and next moment\r\nwe were heaving on the blue swell in sight of the black old Guinea\r\ncoast--when round turned the figure, and changed into Miss Hyde; and\r\nthe old Nabob hauled us ashore upon a beautiful island, where I woke\r\nand thought I was wanted on deck, although it was only my mother\r\ncalling me.\r\n\r\nAll I had found out about them was, that Sir Charles Hyde was the name\r\nof the East Indian, and how he was a Bengal judge newly come home;\r\nwhere they lived, nobody at the ball seemed to know. At home, of\r\ncourse, it was so absurd to think of getting acquaintance with a rich\r\nIndian judge and his daughter, that I said no more of the matter;\r\nalthough I looked so foolish and care-about-nothing, I suppose, that\r\nmy mother said to Jane she was sure I wanted to go to sea again, and\r\neven urged me to \"take a trip to the Downs, perhaps.\" As for going to\r\nsea, however, I felt I could no more stir _then_, from where I was,\r\nthan with a best-bower down, and all hands drunk but the captain.\r\nThere was a favourite lazy spot of mine near the house, where I used\r\nto lie after dinner, and smoke amongst the grass, at the back of a\r\nhigh garden-wall with two doors in it, and a plank across a little\r\nbrook running close under them. All round was a green paddock for\r\ncows; there was a tall tree at hand, which I climbed now and then\r\nhalf-mast high, to get a look down a long lane that ran level to the\r\nsky, and gave you a sharp gush of blue from the far end. Being a\r\nluxurious dog in those days, like the cloth in general when hung up\r\nashore, I used to call it \"The Idler's Walk,\" and \"The Lazy Watch,\"\r\nwhere I did duty somewhat like the famous bo'sun that told his boy to\r\ncall him every night and say the captain wanted him, when he turned\r\nover with a polite message, and no good to the old tyrant's eyes.\r\n\r\nWell, one afternoon I was stretched on the softest bit of this\r\nretreat, feeling unhappy all over, and trying to think of nothing\r\nparticular, as I looked at the wall and smoked my cheroot. Excuse me\r\nif I think that, so far as I remember, there is nothing so\r\nconsolatory, though it can't of course cure one, as a fine Manilla for\r\nthe \"green sickness,\" as our fore-mast fellows would say. My main idea\r\nwas, that nothing on earth could turn up to get me out of this scrape,\r\nbut I should stick eternally, with my head-sails shivering aback, or\r\nflapping in a sickening dead calm. It was a beautiful hot summer\r\nafternoon, as quiet as possible, and I was weary to death of seeing\r\nthat shadow of the branch lying against the white wall, down to the\r\nkeyhole of the nearest door. All of a sudden I heard the sweetest\r\nvoice imaginable, coming down the garden as it were, singing a verse\r\nof a Hindostanee song I had heard the Bengal girls chant with their\r\npitchers on their heads at the well, of an evening,--\r\n\r\n    \"'La li ta la, ta perisi,\r\n    La na comalay ah sahm-rè,\r\n    Madna, ca--rahm\r\n    Ram li ta, co-ca-la lir jhi!\r\n    La li ta la, vanga-la ta perisi.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Coc-coka-cokatoo!\" screamed a harsh voice, which I certainly could\r\ndistinguish from the first. \"Pretty cockatoo!\" said the other\r\ncoaxingly; and next minute the large pink-flushed bird itself popped\r\nhis head over the top-stones above the door, floundering about with\r\nhis throat foul of the silver chain fast to his leg, till he hung by\r\nhis beak on my side of the wall, half choked, and trying to croak out\r\n\"Pretty--pretty cocky!\" Before I had time to think, the door opened,\r\nand, by heavens! there was my very charmer herself, with the shade of\r\nthe green leaves showered over her alarmed face. She had scarcely seen\r\nme before I sprang up and caught the cockatoo, which bit me like an\r\nimp incarnate, till the blood ran down my fingers as I handed it to\r\nits mistress, my heart in my mouth, and more than a quarter-deck bow\r\nin my cap. The young lady looked at me first in surprise, as may be\r\nsupposed, and then, with a smile of thanks that set my brain all\r\nafloat, \"Oh, dear me!\" exclaimed she, \"you are hurt!\" \"_Hurt!_\" I\r\nsaid, looking so bewildered, I suppose, that she couldn't help\r\nlaughing. \"Tippoo is very stupid,\" continued she, smiling, \"because he\r\nis out of his own country, I think. You shall have no sugar to-night,\r\ncockatoo, for biting your friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you--ever in India--madam?\" I stammered out. \"Not since I was a\r\nchild,\" she answered; but just then I saw the figure of the Nabob\r\nsauntering down the garden, and said I had particular business, and\r\nmust be off. \"You are very busy here, sir?\" said the charming young\r\ncreature archly. \"You are longing till you go to sea, I daresay--like\r\nTippoo and me.\" \"You!\" said I, staring at the keyhole, whilst she\r\ncaught my eye, and blushed a little, as I thought. \"Yes, we are\r\ngoing--I long to see India again, and I remember the sea too, like a\r\ndream.\"\r\n\r\nOh heavens! thought I, when I heard the old gentleman call out, \"Lota!\r\nLota _beebee-lee_! _Kabultah, meetoowah?_\"[14] and away she vanished\r\nbehind the door, with a smile to myself. The tone of the Judge's\r\nvoice, and his speaking Hindoo, showed he was fond of his daughter at\r\nany rate. Off I went, too, as much confused as before, only for the\r\nnew thought in my head. \"The sea, the sea!\" I shouted, as soon as out\r\nof hearing, and felt the wind, as 'twere, coming from aft at last,\r\nlike the first ripple. \"Yes, by George!\" said I, \"outward bound for a\r\nthousand. I'll go, if it was before the mast.\" All at once I\r\nremembered I didn't know the ship's name, or when. Next day, and the\r\nnext again, I was skulking about my old place, but nobody\r\nappeared--not so much as a shadow inside the keyhole. At last one\r\nevening, just as I was going away, the door opened; I sauntered slowly\r\nalong, when, instead of the charming Lota, out came the flat brown\r\nturban of an ugly _kitmagar_, with a mustache, looking round to see\r\nwho was there. \"_Salaam_, sah 'b,\" said the brown fellow, holding the\r\ndoor behind him with one paw. \"_Burra judge sahib bhote bhote salaam_\r\nsend uppiser[15] sah 'b--'ope not _dekhe_[16] after sahib cook-maid.\"\r\n\"_Joot baht, hurkut-jee_,\"[17] said I, laughing. \"Sah 'b been _my_\r\ncoontree?\" inquired the Bengalee more politely. \"_Jee_, yes,\" I said,\r\nwishing to draw him out. \"I Inglitch can is-peek,\" continued the dark\r\nfootman, conceitedly; \"ver well sah 'b, but one _damned_ misfortune us\r\nfor come i-here. Baud _carry_ make--plenty too much _poork_--too much\r\ngraug drink. Turmeric--chili--banana not got--not coco-tree got--pah!\r\nBaud coontree, too much i-cold, sah 'b?\" \"Curse the rascal's\r\nimpudence,\" I thought, but I asked him if he wasn't going back. \"Yis,\r\nsah 'b, _such baht_[18] A-il-alàh! Mohummud _burra Meer-kea_. Bote too\r\nmuch i-smell _my_ coontree.\" \"When are you going?\" I asked carelessly.\r\n\"Two day this time, sah 'b.\" \"Can you tell me the name of the ship?\" I\r\nwent on. The Kitmagar looked at me slyly, stroked his mustache, and\r\nmeditated; after which he squinted at me again, and his lips opened so\r\nas to form the magic word, \"_Buckshish?_\" \"_Jee_,\" said I, holding out\r\na crown-piece, \"the ship's name and the harbour?\" \"Se,\" began he; the\r\ncoin touched his palm,--\"ring;\" his fingers closed on it, and\r\n\"Patahm,\" dropped from his leathery lips. \"The Seringapatam?\" I said.\r\n\"_Ahn_, sah 'b.\" \"London, eh?\" I added; to which he returned another\r\nreluctant assent, as if it wasn't paid for, and I walked off. However,\r\nI had not got round the corner before I noticed the figure of the old\r\ngentleman himself looking after me from the doorway; his worthy\r\nKitmagar salaaming to the ground, and no doubt giving information how\r\nthe \"cheep uppiser\" had tried to pump him to no purpose. The Nabob\r\nlooked plainly as suspicious as if I had wanted to break into his\r\nhouse, since he held his hand over his eyes to watch me out of sight.\r\n\r\nAt night, I told my mother and sister I should be off to London next\r\nday, for sea. What betwixt their vexation at losing me, and their\r\nsatisfaction to see me more cheerful, with talking over matters, we\r\nsat up half the night. I was so ashamed, though, to tell them what I\r\nintended, considering what a fool's chase it would seem to any one but\r\nmyself, that I kept all close; and, I am sorry to say, I was so full\r\nof my love-affair, with the wild adventure of it, the sea, and\r\neverything besides, as not to feel their anxiety enough. How it was to\r\nturn out I didn't know; but somehow or other I was resolved I'd\r\ncontrive to make a rope if I couldn't find one: at the worst, I might\r\ncarry the ship, gain over the men, or turn pirate and discover an\r\nisland. Early in the morning I packed my traps, drew a cheque for my\r\nprize-money, got the coach, and bowled off for London, to knock up Bob\r\nJacobs, my sea godfather; this being the very first step, as it seemed\r\nto me, in making the plan feasible. Rough sort of confidant as he may\r\nlook, there was no man living I would have trusted before him for\r\nkeeping a secret. Bob was true as the topsail sheets; and if you only\r\ngave him the course to steer, without any of the \"puzzlements,\" as he\r\ncalled the calculating part, he would stick to it, blow high, blow\r\nlow. He was just the fellow I wanted, for the lee brace as it were, to\r\ngive my weather one a purchase, even if I had altogether liked the\r\nnotion of setting off all alone on what I couldn't help suspecting\r\nwas a sufficiently hare-brained scheme as it stood; and, to tell the\r\ntruth, it was only to a straightforward, simple-hearted tar like\r\nJacobs that I could have plucked up courage to make it known. I knew\r\nhe would enter into it like a reefer volunteering for a cutting out,\r\nand make nothing of the difficulties--especially when a love matter\r\nwas at the bottom of it: the chief question was how to discover his\r\nwhereabouts, as Wapping is rather a wide word. I adopted the expedient\r\nof going into all the tobacco-shops to inquire after Jacobs, knowing\r\nhim to be a more than commonly hard smoker, and no great drinker\r\nashore. I was beginning to be tired out, however, and give up the\r\nquest, when, at the corner of a lane near the docks, I caught sight of\r\na little door adorned with what had apparently been part of a ship's\r\nfigure-head--the face of a nymph or nereid, four times as large as\r\nlife, with tarnished gilding, and a long wooden pipe in her mouth that\r\nhad all the effect of a bowsprit, being stayed up by a piece of\r\nmarline to a hook in the wall, probably in order to keep clear of\r\npeople's heads. The words painted on its two head-boards, as under a\r\nship's bow, were \"Betsy Jacobs,\" and \"licensed\" on the top of the\r\ndoor; the window was stowed full of cakes of cavendish, twists of\r\nnegrohead, and coils of pigtail; so that, having heard my old shipmate\r\nspeak of a certain Betsey, both as sweetheart and partner, I made at\r\nonce pretty sure of having lighted, by chance, on his very dry-dock,\r\nand went in without more ado. I found nobody in the little shop, but a\r\nrough voice, as like as possible to Jacobs' own, was chanting the\r\nsea-song of \"Come, cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,\" in the\r\nback-room, in a curious sleepy kind of drone, interrupted every now\r\nand then by the suck of his pipe, and a mysterious thumping sound,\r\nwhich I could only account for by the supposition that the poor fellow\r\nwas mangling clothes, or gone mad. I was obliged to kick on the\r\ncounter with all my might, in competition, before an eye was applied\r\nfrom inside to the little window; after which, as I expected, the head\r\nof Jacobs was thrust out of the door, his hair rough, three days'\r\nbeard on his chin, and he in his shirt and trousers. \"_Hisht!_\" said\r\nhe, in a low voice, not seeing me distinctly for the light, \"you're\r\nnot callin' the watch, my lad! Hold on a bit, and I'll sarve your\r\norders directly.\" After another stave of \"Hearts of oak are our\r\nships,\" &c. in the same drawl, and a still more vigorous thumping than\r\nbefore, next minute out came Bob again; with a wonderful air of\r\nimportance, though, and drawing in one hand, to my great surprise, the\r\nslack of a line of \"half-inch,\" on which he gave now and then a tug\r\nand an ease off, as he came forward, like a fellow humouring a\r\nnewly-hooked fish. \"Now, then, my hearty!\" said he, shading his eyes\r\nwith the other hand, \"bear a--\" \"Why, Jacobs, old ship,\" I said,\r\n\"what's this you're after? Don't you know your old apprentice, eh?\"\r\n\r\nJacobs looked at my cap and epaulette, and gave out his breath in a\r\nwhistle, the only other sign of astonishment being, that he let go his\r\nunaccountable-looking piece of cord. \"Lord bless me, Master Ned!\" said\r\nhe--\"I axes pardon, Lieutenant Collins, your honour!\" \"Glad you know\r\nme this time, Bob, my lad,\" said I, looking round,--\"and a comfortable\r\nberth you've got of it, I daresay. But what the deuce _are_ you about\r\nin there? _You_ haven't a savage _too_, like some friends of yours I\r\nfell in with a short time ago! Or perhaps a lion or a tiger, eh,\r\nJacobs?\" \"No, no, your honour--lions be blowed!\" replied he, laughing,\r\nbut fiddling with his hands all the while, and standing between me and\r\nthe room, as if half ashamed. \"'Tis ownly the tiller-ropes of a small\r\ncraft I am left in charge of, sir. But won't ye sit down, your honour,\r\ntill such time as my old 'ooman comes aboard to relieve me, sir?\r\nHere's a _cheer_, and maybe you'd make so free for to take a pipe of\r\nprime cavendish, your honour?\" \"Let's have a look into your cabin,\r\nthough, Bob my man,\" said I, curious to know what was the secret; when\r\nall at once a tremendous squall from within let me sufficiently into\r\nit. The sailor had been rocking the cradle, with a fine little fellow\r\nof a baby in it, and a line made fast to keep it in play when he\r\nserved the shop. \"All the pitch 's in the fire now, your honour,\"\r\nsaid he, looking terribly non-plussed; \"I've broached him to, and he's\r\nall aback till his mammy gets a hold of him.\" \"A good pipe the little\r\nrogue's got though,\" said I, \"and a fine child he is, Jacobs--do for a\r\nbo'sun yet.\" \"Why, yes, sir,\" said he, rubbing his chin with a\r\ngratified smile, as the urchin kicked, threw out his arms, and roared\r\nlike to break his heart; \"I'm thinking he's a sailor all over, by\r\nnatur', as one may say. He don't like a calm no more nor myself; but\r\nthat's the odds of bein' ashore, where you needs to keep swinging the\r\nhammocks by hand, instead of havin' it done for you, sir.\" In the\r\nmidst of the noise, however, we were caught by the sudden appearance\r\nof Mistress Jacobs herself--a good-looking young woman, with a\r\nmarket-basket full of bacon and greens, and a chubby little boy\r\nholding by her apron, who came through the shop. The first thing she\r\ndid was to catch up the baby out of the cradle, and begin hushing it,\r\nafter one or two side-glances of reproach at her husband, who\r\nattempted to cover his disgrace by saying, \"Betsy, my girl, where's\r\nyour manners? why don't you off hats to the leftenant?--it's my wife,\r\nyour honour.\" Mrs Jacobs curtseyed twice very respectfully, though not\r\nparticularly fond of the profession, as I found afterwards; and I soon\r\nquite gained her smiles and good graces by praising her child, with\r\nthe remark that he was too pretty ever to turn out a sailor; for,\r\nsharp as mothers are to detect this sort of flattery to anybody else's\r\nbantling, you always find it take wonderfully with respect to their\r\nown. Whenever Jacobs and I were left to ourselves, I struck at once\r\ninto my scheme--the more readily for feeling I had the weather-hand of\r\nhim in regard of his late appearance. It was too ridiculous, the\r\nnotion of one of the best foretopmen that ever passed a weather-earing\r\nstaying at home to rock his wife's cradle and attend the shop; and he\r\nwas evidently aware of it as I went on. It was a little selfish, I\r\ndaresay, and Mrs Jacobs would perhaps have liked me none the better\r\nfor it; but I proposed to him to get a berth in the Indiaman, sail\r\nwith me for Bombay, and stand by for a foul hitch in something or\r\nother. \"Why, sir,\" said he, \"it shan't be said of Bob Jacobs he were\r\never the man to hang back where a matter was to be done that must be\r\ndone. I doesn't see the whole bearings of it as yet, but ounly you\r\ngive the orders, sir, and I'll stick to 'em.\" \"'Tis a long stretch\r\nbetween this and Bombay, Jacobs,\" said I, \"and plenty of room for\r\nchances.\" \"Ay, ay, sir, no doubt,\" said he, \"ye can _talk_ the length\r\nof the best bower cable.\" \"More than that, Bob my lad,\" said I, \"I\r\nknow these Company men; if they once get out of their regular jog,\r\nthey're as helpless as a pig adrift on a grating; and before they grow\r\nused to sailing out of convoy, with no frigates to whip them in,\r\ndepend upon it Mother Carey[19] will have to teach them a new trick or\r\ntwo.\" \"Mayhap, sir,\" put in Jacobs, doubtfully, \"the best thing 'ud be\r\nif they cast the ship away altogether, as I've seen done myself for\r\nthe matter of an insurance. Ye know, sir, they lets it pass at Lloyd's\r\nnow the war's over, seein' it brings custom to the underwriters, if so\r\nbe ounly it don't come over often for the profits. Hows'ever it needs\r\na good seaman to choose his lee-shore well, no doubt.\" \"Oh!\" answered\r\nI, laughing, \"but the chances are, all hands would want to be Robinson\r\nCrusoe at once! No, no,--only let's get aboard, and take things as\r\nthey come.\" \"What's the ship's name, sir?\" inquired Jacobs, sinking\r\nhis voice, and looking cautiously over his shoulder toward the door.\r\n\"The Seringapatam,--do you know her?\" I said. \"Ay, ay, sir, well\r\nenough,\" said he, readily,--\"a lump of a ship she is, down off\r\nBlackwall in the stream with two more--country-built, and tumbles home\r\nrather much from below the plank-sheer for a sightly craft, besides\r\nbeing flat in the eyes of her, and round in the counter, just where\r\nshe shouldn't, sir. Them Par_chee_ Bombay ship-wrights _does_ clap on\r\na lot of onchristien flummeries and gilt mouldings, let alone\r\nquarter-galleries fit for the king's castle!\" \"In short, she's\r\ntea-waggon all over,\" said I, \"and just as slow and as leewardly, to\r\nboot, as teak can make her?\" \"Her lines is not that bad, though, your\r\nhonour,\" continued Jacobs, \"if you just knocked off her poop,--and\r\nshe'd bear a deal o' beating for a sea-boat. They've got a smart young\r\nmate, too; for I seed him t'other day a-sending up the yards, and now\r\nshe's as square as a frigate, all ready to drop down river.\" The short\r\nand long of it was, that I arranged with my old shipmate, who was\r\nfully bent on the cruise, whether Mrs Jacobs should approve or not,\r\nthat, somehow or other, we should both ship our hammocks on board of\r\nthe Seringapatam--he before the mast, and I wherever I could get. On\r\ngoing to the agent's, however--which I did as soon as I could change\r\nmy uniform for plain clothes--I found, to my great disappointment,\r\nfrom a plan of the accommodations, that not only were the whole of the\r\npoop-cabins taken, but those on the lower-deck also. Most of the\r\npassengers, I ascertained, were ladies, with their children and\r\nnurses, going back to India, and raw young cadets, with a few\r\ncommercial and civilian nondescripts; there were no troops or\r\nofficers, and room enough, except for one gentleman having engaged the\r\nentire poop, at an immense expense, for his own use. This I, of\r\ncourse, supposed was the Nabob, but the clerk was too close to inform\r\nme. \"You must try another ship, sir,\" said he, coolly, as he shut the\r\nbook. \"Sorry for it, but we have another to sail in a fortnight. A.1,\r\nsir; far finer vessel--couple of hundred tons larger--and sails\r\nfaster.\" \"You be hanged!\" muttered I, walking out; and a short time\r\nafter I was on board. The stewards told me as much again; but on my\r\nslipping a guinea into the fingers of one, he suddenly recollected\r\nthere was a gentleman in state-room No. 14, starboard side of the main\r\nskylight, who, being alone, might perhaps be inclined to take a chum,\r\nif I dealt with him privately. \"Yankee, sir, he is,\" said the steward,\r\nby way of a useful hint. However, I didn't need the warning: at sight\r\nof the individual's long nose, thin lips, and sallow jaw-bones,\r\nwithout a whisker on his face, and his shirt-collar turned down, as he\r\nsat overhauling his traps beside the carronade, which was tethered in\r\nthe state-room, with its muzzle through the port. He looked a good\r\ndeal like a jockey beside his horse; or, as a wit of a schoolboy cadet\r\nsaid afterwards, the Boston gentleman calling himself Daniel Snout,\r\nEsquire--like Daniel praying in the lion's den, and afraid it might\r\nturn round or roar. I must say the idea didn't quite delight me, nor\r\nthe sight of a fearful quantity of luggage which was stowed up against\r\nthe bulkhead; but after introducing myself, and objecting to the first\r\nfew offers, I at last concluded a bargain with the American for a\r\nhundred and twenty guineas, which, he remarked, was \"considerable low,\r\nI prognosticate, mister!\" \"However,\" said he, \"I expect you're a\r\nconversationable individual a little: I allowed for that, you know,\r\nmister. One can't do much of a trade at sea--that's a fact; and I\r\ncalculate we'll swap information by the way. I'm water-pruff, I tell\r\nyou, as all our nation is. You'll not _settle_ at Bumbay, I reckon,\r\nmister?\" But though I meant to pay my new messmate in my own coin at\r\nleisure afterwards, and be as frank and open as day with him--the only\r\nway to meet a Yankee--I made off at present as fast as possible to\r\nbring my things aboard, resolving to sleep at Blackwall, and then to\r\nstow myself out of sight for sick, until there was somebody to take\r\noff the edge of his confounded talk.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon, accordingly, I found myself once more afloat, the\r\nIndiaman dropping down with the first breeze. The day after, she was\r\nrunning through the Downs with it pretty strong from north-east, a\r\nfair wind--the pilot-boat snoring off close-hauled to windward, with\r\na white spray over her nose; and the three _dungaree_ topsails of the\r\nSeringapatam lifting and swelling, as yellow as gold, over her white\r\ncourses in the blue Channel haze. The breeze freshened, till she\r\nrolled before it, and everything being topsy-turvy on deck, the lumber\r\nin the way, the men as busy as bees setting her ship-shape--it would\r\nhave been as much as a passenger's toes were worth to show them from\r\nbelow; so that I was able to keep by myself, just troubling my\r\nseamanship so much as to stand clear of the work. Enjoy it I did, too;\r\nby Jove, the first sniff of the weather was enough to make me forget\r\nwhat I was there for. I was every now and then on the point of fisting\r\na rope, and singing out with the men; till at length I thought it more\r\ncomfortable, even for me, to run up the mizen shrouds when everybody\r\nwas forward, where I stowed myself out of sight in the cross-trees.\r\n\r\nAbout dusk, while I was waiting to slip down, a stronger puff than\r\nordinary made them clue up the mizen-royal from deck, which I took\r\nupon myself to furl off-hand--quick enough to puzzle a couple of boys\r\nthat came aloft for the purpose, especially as, in the mean time, I\r\nhad got down upon the topsail-yardarm out of their notice. When they\r\ngot on deck again, I heard the little fellows telling some of the men,\r\nin a terrified sort of way, how the mizen-royal had either stowed\r\nitself, or else it was Dick Wilson's ghost, that fell off the same\r\nyard last voyage,--more by token, he used always to make fast the\r\ngaskets just that fashion. At night, however, the wind having got\r\nlighter, with half moonlight, there was a muster of some passengers on\r\ndeck, all sick and miserable, as they tried to keep their feet, and\r\nhave the benefit of air,--the Yankee being as bad as the worst. I\r\nthought it wouldn't do for me to be altogether free, and accordingly\r\nstuck fast by Mr Snout, with my head over the quarter-deck bulwarks,\r\nlooking into his face, and talking away to him, asking all sorts of\r\nquestions about what was good for sea-sickness, then giving a groan to\r\nprevent myself laughing, when the spray splashed up upon his\r\n\"water-pruff\" face, he responding to it as Sancho Panza did to Don\r\nQuixote, when the one examined the other's mouth after a potion. All\r\nhe could falter out was, how he wondered I could speak at all when\r\nsick. \"Oh! oh dear!\" said I, with another howl. \"Yes,--'tis merely\r\nbecause I can't _think_! And I daresay you are thinking so much you\r\ncan't _talk_--the sea is so full of meditation, as Lord\r\nByron--Oh--oh--this water will be the death of me!\" \"I feel as if--the\r\nwhole--tarnation Atlantic was--inside of my bowls!\" gasped he through\r\nhis nostrils. \"Oh!\" I could not help putting in, as the ship and Mr\r\nSnout both gave a heave up, \"and coming out of you!\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this time I had felt so sure of my ground as scarcely to\r\ntrouble myself about the Bengal judge and his fairy treasure of a\r\ndaughter; only in the midst of the high spirits brought up by the\r\nbreeze, I hugged myself now and then at the thought of their turning\r\nout by degrees as things got settled, and my having such openings the\r\nwhole voyage through as one couldn't miss in four or five months.\r\nNobody would suspect the raw chap I looked, with smooth hair and a\r\nhigh collar, of any particular cue: I must say there was a little\r\nvanity at the bottom of it, but I kept thinking more and more how snug\r\nand quietly I'd enjoy all that went on, sailing on one tack with the\r\npassengers and the old Nabob himself, and slipping off upon the other\r\nwhen I could come near the charming young Lota. The notion looks more\r\nlike what some scamp of a reefer, cruising ashore, would have hit\r\nupon, than suits my taste now-a-days; but the cockpit had put a spice\r\nof the imp in me, which I never got clear of till this very voyage, as\r\nyou shall see, if we get through with the log of it. 'Twas no use, as\r\nI found, saying what one should have to do, except put _heart_ into\r\nit,--with wind, sea, and a love affair to manage all at once, after\r\nmaking a tangled coil instead of one all clear and above-board.\r\n\r\nThe first time I went down into the cuddy was that evening to tea,\r\nwhere all was at sixes and sevens like the decks; the lamps ill\r\ntrimmed, stewards out of the way, and a few lads trying to bear up\r\nagainst their stomachs by the help of brandy and biscuits. The main\r\nfigure was a jolly-looking East Indian, an indigo-planter as he turned\r\nout, with a bald forehead, a hook nose, and his gills covered with\r\nwhite whiskers that gave him all the cut of a cockatoo. He had his\r\nbrown servant running about on every hand, and, being an old stager,\r\ndid his best to cheer up the rest; but nothing I saw showed the least\r\nsign of the party I looked after. I was sure I ought to have made out\r\nsomething of them by this time, considering the stir such a grandee as\r\nSir Charles Hyde would cause aboard: in fact, there didn't seem to be\r\nmany passengers in her, and I began to curse the lying scoundrel of a\r\n_Kitmagar_ for working \"Tom Cox's traverse\" on me, and myself for\r\nbeing a greater ass than I'd fancied. Indeed I heard the planter\r\nmention by chance that Sir Charles Hyde, the district judge, had come\r\nhome last voyage from India in this very Seringapatam, which no doubt,\r\nI thought, put the Mahommedan rascal up to his trick.\r\n\r\nI was making up my mind to an Indian trip, and the pure pleasure of\r\nDaniel Catoson Snout, Esquire's company for two blessed months, when\r\nall of a sudden I felt the ship bring her wind a-quarter, with a\r\nfurious plunge of the Channel water along her bends, that made every\r\nlandsman's bowels yearn as if he felt it gurgle through him. One young\r\nfellow, more drunk than sick, gave a wild bolt right over the cuddy\r\ntable, striking out with both arms and legs as if afloat, so as to\r\nsweep half of the glasses down on the floor. The planter, who was\r\nthree cloths in the wind himself, looked down upon him with a comical\r\nair of pity as soon as he had got cushioned upon the wreck. \"My dear\r\nfellow,\" said he, \"what do you feel--eh?\" \"Feel, you--old blackguard!\"\r\nstammered the griffin, \"de--dam--dammit, I feel _everything_! Goes\r\nthrough--through my vitals as if--I was a con--founded _whale_!\r\nC--can't stand it!\" \"You've drunk yourself aground, my boy!\" sung out\r\nthe indigo man; \"stuck fast on the coral--eh? Never mind, we'll float\r\nyou off, only don't flounder that way with your tail!--by Jove, you\r\nscamp, you've ruined my toe--oh dear!\" I left the planter hopping\r\nround on one pin, and holding the gouty one in his hand, betwixt\r\nlaughing and crying: on deck I found the floating Nab Light bearing\r\nbroad on our lee-bow, with Cumberland Fort glimmering to windward, and\r\nthe half moon setting over the Isle of Wight, while we stood up for\r\nPortsmouth harbour. The old captain, and most of the officers, were on\r\nthe poop for the first time, though as stiff and uncomfortable from\r\nthe sort of land-sickness and lumber-qualms that sailors feel till\r\nthings are _in_ their places, as the landsmen did until things were\r\n_out_ of them. The skipper walked the weather side by himself and said\r\nnothing: the smart chief officer sent two men, one after another, from\r\nthe wheel for \"cows\" that didn't know where their tails were; and as\r\nfor the middies, they seemed to know when to keep out of the way. In a\r\nlittle, the spars of the men-of-war at Spithead were to be seen as we\r\nrose; before the end of the first watch, we were running outside the\r\nSpit Buoy, which was nodding and plashing with the tide in the last\r\nslant of moonshine, till at last we rounded to, and down went the\r\nanchor in five fathoms, off the Motherbank. What the Indiaman wanted\r\nat Portsmouth I didn't know; but, meantime, I had given up all hopes\r\nof the Nabob being in her, and the only question with me was, whether\r\nI should take the opportunity of giving all hands the slip here, even\r\nthough I left my Yankee friend disconsolate, and a clear gainer by\r\ndollars beyond count.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning there were plenty of wherries looking out for\r\nfares; so, as the Indiaman was not to sail before the night-ebb, when\r\nthe breeze would probably spring up fair again, I hailed one of them\r\nto go ashore at the Point, for a quiet stroll over Southsea Common,\r\nwhere I meant to overhaul the whole bearings of the case, and think if\r\nit weren't better to go home, and wait the Admiralty's pleasure for a\r\nship. I hadn't even seen anything of Jacobs, and the whole\r\nhotel-keeping ways of the Indiaman began to disgust me, or else I\r\nshould have at once decided to take the chance of seeing Lota Hyde\r\nsomehow or other in India; but, again, one could scarcely endure the\r\nnotion of droning on in a frigate without so much as a Brest lugger\r\nto let drive at. It was about six o'clock; the morning gun from the\r\nguard-ship off the Dockyard came booming down through the harbour, the\r\nblue offing shone like silver, and the green tideway sparkled on every\r\nsurge, up to where they were flashing and poppling on the copper of\r\nthe frigates at Spithead. I noticed them crossing yards and squaring;\r\nthe farthest out hove up anchor, loosed fore-topsail, cast her head to\r\nstarboard, and fired a gun as she stood slowly out to sea under all\r\nsail, with a light air freshening abeam. The noble look of her almost\r\nreconciled me of itself to the service, were it for the mere sake of\r\nhaving a share in driving such a craft between wind and water. Just\r\nthen, however, an incident turned up in spite of me, which I certainly\r\ndidn't expect, and which had more, even than I reckoned at the time,\r\nto do with my other adventure; seeing that it made me, both then and\r\nafterwards, do the direct opposite of what I meant to do, and both\r\ntimes put a new spoke in my wheel, as we say at sea here.\r\n\r\nI had observed a seventy-four, the Stratton, lying opposite the Spit\r\nBuoy; on board of which, as the waterman told me, a court-martial had\r\nbeen held the day before, where they broke a first lieutenant for\r\ninsulting his captain. Both belonged to one of the frigates: the\r\ncaptain I had seen, and heard of as the worst tyrant in the navy; his\r\nship was called \"a perfect hell afloat;\" that same week one of the\r\nboys had tried to drown himself alongside, and a corporal of marines,\r\nafter coming ashore and drinking a glass with his sweetheart, had\r\ncoolly walked down to the Point, jumped in between two boats at the\r\njetty, and kept himself under water till he was dead. The lieutenant\r\nhad been dismissed the service, and as I recognised the name, I\r\nwondered whether it could actually be my schoolfellow, Tom Westwood,\r\nas gallant a fellow and as merry as ever broke biscuit. Two\r\nsail-boats, one from around the Stratton's quarter, and the other from\r\nover by Gosport, steering on the same tack for Southsea, diverted my\r\nattention as I sauntered down to the beach. The bow of the nearest\r\nwherry grounded on the stones as I began to walk quicker towards the\r\ntown-gates, chiefly because I was pretty ready for an early breakfast\r\nat the old Blue Posts, and also because I had a slight notion of what\r\nthese gentlemen wanted on Southsea Beach at odd hours. Out they\r\njumped, however--one man in naval undress, another, a captain, in full\r\nfig, the third, a surgeon--coming right athwart my course to bring me\r\nto. The first I almost at once remembered for the notorious captain of\r\nthe Orestes, or N'Oreste, as the midshipmen called her, from her\r\nFrench build and her character together. \"Hallo, you sir!\" said the\r\nother captain decidedly, \"you must stand still.\" \"Indeed!\" said I;\r\n\"and why so, if you please?\" \"Since you _are_ here, we don't intend\r\nallowing you to pass for some few minutes.\" \"And what if I should do\r\nas I choose, sir?\" I asked. \"If you stir two steps, sir, I shall shoot\r\nyou!\" replied the captain, who was one of the bullying school. \"Oh,\r\nvery well,\" I said, rather confounded by his impertinence, \"then I\r\nshall stay;\" and I accordingly stood stock-still, with my arms folded,\r\nuntil the other boat landed its party of two. They were in plain\r\nclothes; nor did I give them any particular attention till the seconds\r\nhad stationed their men, when the captain of the Orestes had his back\r\nto me, and his antagonist stood directly facing. As his pale resolved\r\nfeatures came out before me with the morning sun on them, his lips\r\ntogether, and his nostrils large, I recognised my old friend Westwood.\r\nThe captain had broke him the day before, and now he had accepted his\r\nchallenge, being a known dead shot, while the lieutenant had never\r\nfired a bullet in cold blood: there was, no doubt, a settled purpose\r\nin the tyrant to crush the first man that had dared to thwart his\r\nwill. Westwood's second came forward and mentioned to the other that\r\nhis friend was still willing to withdraw the words spoken in first\r\nheat, and would accordingly fire in the air. \"Coward!\" shouted the\r\ncaptain of the Orestes immediately; \"I shall shoot you through the\r\nheart!\" \"Sir!\" said I to his second, \"I _will not_ look on; and if\r\nthat gentleman is shot, I will be witness against you both as\r\nmurderers!\" I dropped down behind a stone out of the line of fire,\r\nand to keep my eyes off the devilish piece of work, though my blood\r\nboiled to knock the fellow down that I was speaking to. Another\r\nminute, and the suspense was too great for me to help looking up: just\r\nat that moment I saw how _set_ Westwood's face was: he was watching\r\nhis enemy with an eye that showed to me what the other's must\r\nbe--seeking for his life. The seconds gave the word to each other in\r\nthe middle, and dropped two white handkerchiefs at once with their\r\nhands together; I caught the flash of Westwood's pistol, when, to my\r\nastonishment, I saw the captain of the Orestes next moment jerk up his\r\narm betwixt me and the sky, fire in the air, and slowly fall back--he\r\nwas dead!--shot through the heart. One glance at his face gave you a\r\nnotion of the devilish meaning he had had; but what was my surprise\r\nwhen his second walked up to Westwood, and said to him, \"Sir, you are\r\nthe murderer of Captain Duncombe;--my friend fired in the air as you\r\nproposed.\" \"You are mistaken, sir,\" answered Westwood, coldly;\r\n\"Captain Duncombe sought my life, and I have used the privilege of\r\nself-defence.\" \"The surgeon is of my opinion,\" said the other; \"and I\r\nam sorry to say that we cannot allow you to depart.\" \"I shall give\r\nmyself up to the authorities at once,\" said Westwood. \"We have only\r\nyour word for that, which I must be permitted, in such a case, to\r\ndoubt,\" replied the captain, whose evident wish was to detain Westwood\r\nby force or threats while he sent off his surgeon. The worst of it\r\nwas, as I now found, that since the court-martial and the challenge,\r\nan admiralty order had arrived, in consideration of several gallant\r\nacts during the war, as well as private representation, restoring him\r\nto the service: so that he had in fact called out and shot his\r\nsuperior officer. As for the charge now brought forward, it was too\r\nabsurd for any to believe it, unless from rage or prejudice; the case\r\nwas bad enough, at any rate, without it.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I had exchanged a word or two with Westwood's friend;\r\nafter which, lifting up a second pistol which lay on the sand, I went\r\nup to the captain. \"Sir,\" said I, \"you used the freedom, a little ago,\r\nof forcing me into your concerns, and I have seen the end of it. I\r\nhave now got to tell you, having watched your conduct, that either you\r\nmust submit to be made fast here for a bit, else, by the God that made\r\nme, I'll shoot you through the head!\" The captain looked at me, his\r\nsurgeon sidled up to him, and, being a man near my own size, he\r\nsuddenly tried to wrench the pistol out of my hands: however, I had\r\nhim the next moment under my knee, while Westwood's second secured the\r\nlittle surgeon, and took a few round sea-turns about his wrists and\r\nancles with a neckerchief. My companion then gave me a hand to do the\r\nsame with his superior officer--the medico all the time singing out\r\nlike a bull, and the captain threatening--while the dead body lay\r\nstark and stiff behind us, the eyes wide, the head down, and the\r\nbreast up, the hand clenching a pistol, just as he had fallen.\r\nWestwood stood quite unconscious of everything we did, only he seemed\r\nto be watching the knees drawn up as they stiffened, and the\r\nsand-flies hovering about the mouth. \"Shall we clap a stopper between\r\ntheir teeth?\" said the second to me--he had been at sea, but who he\r\nwas I never knew--\"the surgeon will be heard on the walls, he bellows\r\nso!\" \"Never mind,\" said I, \"we'll just drop them beyond tide-mark--the\r\nlee of the stones yonder.\" In fact, from the noise the tide was\r\nmaking, I question if the shots could have been heard even by the\r\nwatermen, who had prudently sheered out of sight round a point. I\r\ncouldn't help looking, when we had done this, from the captain's body\r\nto his own frigate, as she was sluing round head on to us, at single\r\nanchor, to the turn of tide, with her buoy dancing on the brisk blue\r\nsweep of water, and her figure-head shining in the sunlight. As soon\r\nas we covered over the corpse with dulse-weed, Westwood started as if\r\nwe had taken something away from him, or freed him of a spell.\r\n\"Westwood!\" said I, laying my hand on his shoulder, \"you _must_ come\r\nalong with me.\" He said nothing, but followed us quietly round to the\r\nwherries, where I told the watermen that the other party had gone a\r\ndifferent way to keep clear, and we wanted them to pull for Gosport.\r\nAt Gosport we had Westwood rigged out in black clothes, his hair\r\ncropped, and whiskers shaved off--as I thought it the fittest thing\r\nfor his case, and what he could best carry out, to go aboard of the\r\nIndiaman with me as if he were a missionary. Poor fellow! he didn't\r\nknow _what_ he was. So, having waited till dusk, to let the watermen\r\nlose our track, and his friend having posted off for Dover, he and I\r\nboth got safe over to the Seringapatam, where I had him stowed in the\r\nfirst empty state-room I found. I had actually forgot, through the\r\nexcitement, all about my missing my first chase: from one hour to\r\nanother I kept watching the tide-marks ashore, and the dog-vane on the\r\nship's quarter, all impatience to hear the word given for \"all hands\r\nup anchor,\" and hoping our worthy friends on Southsea Beach were still\r\nwithin hearing of the Channel flood. At last the order did come; round\r\nwent the capstan merrily enough, till she had hove short and up; the\r\nanchor was catted, and off went the lumbering old craft through the\r\nSolent about midnight, before a fine rattling breeze, in company with\r\nsix or seven others, all running for the Needles. They were loosing\r\nthe Indiaman's royals when I heard a gun from the guard-ship in\r\nharbour; and a little after up went a rocket, signalling to some\r\nfrigate or other at Spithead; and away they kept at it, with lights\r\nfrom the telegraph to her masthead, for several minutes. \"All's up!\"\r\nthought I, \"and both Westwood and myself are in for it!\"\r\n\r\nNext morning at daybreak, accordingly, no sooner did the dawn serve to\r\nshow us the Portland Light going out on the weather quarter, with a\r\nwhole fleet of Channel craft and Mediterranean brigs about us, we\r\nsurging through it as fast as the Indiaman could go,--than _there_ was\r\na fine forty-four standing off and on right in our course, in fact the\r\nvery identical Orestes herself! She picked us out in a moment--bore\r\nup, stood across our weather-bow, and hailed. \"What ship's that?\" said\r\nthe first Luff in her mizen rigging.\r\n\r\n\"The Seringapatam, Honourable Company's ship, Captain Williamson!\"\r\nsung out our first officer, with his cap off. \"Heave to, till I send a\r\nboat aboard of you!\" hailed the naval man, and there we bobbed to each\r\nother with mainyards backed. In a few minutes a master's mate with\r\ngig's crew was under our lee-quarter, and the mate came on deck.\r\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"the Port Admiral will thank you to deliver these\r\ndespatches for Sir Charles Hyde, who I believe is aboard.\" \"Certainly,\r\nsir,\" said the first officer, \"they shall be given to him in an hour's\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, and a fine voyage,\" said the master's mate politely;\r\nand I took the occasion of asking if Captain Duncombe were on board\r\nthe Orestes. \"No, sir,\" answered the midshipman, \"he happens to be\r\nashore at present.\" I have seldom felt so relieved as when I saw the\r\nfrigate haul round her mainyard, and go sweeping off to leeward, while\r\nwe resumed our course. By noon we had sunk the land about Start Point,\r\nwith a breeze which it was no use wasting at that season to take\r\n\"departures;\" and as the afternoon set in hazy, we were soon out of\r\nsight of Old England for good. For my part, I was bound Eastward at\r\nlast with a witness, and, like a young bear, again \"all my troubles\r\nbefore me.\"--\"There is two bells though,\" interrupted the narrator,\r\nstarting. \"Let us see what sort of night it is before the ladies\r\nretire.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Cellar for goods.\r\n\r\n[8] Asylum of the world.\r\n\r\n[9] District judicial courts.\r\n\r\n[10] _Flush_--_i.e._, level.\r\n\r\n[11] Steward and Butler.\r\n\r\n[12] Sport.\r\n\r\n[13] Turban-wearing.\r\n\r\n[14] Little Girl!

In the nautical creed,\r\n\"Davy Jones\" represents the abstract power, and \"Mother Carey\" the\r\npractically developed experience, which together make up the life\r\nOceanic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMÉRIMÉE'S HISTORY OF PETER THE CRUEL.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memoirs of a sovereign who had Alburquerque for a minister, Maria\r\nPadilla for a mistress, Henry of Trastamare for a rival, and Edward\r\nthe Black Prince for an ally and companion in arms, must be worthy the\r\nresearches even of so elegant a scholar and learned an antiquarian as\r\nProsper Mérimée. When the nations are engrossed by their difficulties\r\nand disasters, and the jarring discord of revolution and thundering\r\ncrash of monarchies on every side resound, the history of a\r\nsemi-barbarous period, and of a king now five hundred years in his\r\ngrave, should be set forth with surpassing talent to attract and\r\nsustain attention. But M. Mérimée is the literary Midas of his day and\r\ncountry: the subject he handles becomes bright and precious by the\r\nmagic of his touch. Though its interest be remote, he can invest it\r\nwith all the charm of freshness. Upon a former occasion[21] we noticed\r\nhis imaginative productions with well-merited praise; to-day, in the\r\nhistorian's graver garb, he equally commands admiration and applause.\r\nHe has been happy in his selection of a period rich in dramatic\r\nincident and fascinating details; and of these he has made the utmost\r\nprofit. In a previous paper, we quoted M. Mérimée's profession of\r\nfaith in matters of ancient and mediæval history. In his preface to\r\nthe _Chronique de Charles IX._, he avowed his predilection for\r\nanecdotes and personal traits, and the weight he is disposed to attach\r\nto them as painting the manners and character of an epoch, and as\r\nthrowing upon the motives and qualities of its prominent personages a\r\nlight more vivid and true, than that obtained from the tedious and\r\noften partial narratives of grave contemporary chroniclers. In the\r\npresent instance, he has liberally supplied his readers with the fare\r\nhe himself prefers. His _History of Pedro the First of Castile_\r\nabounds in illustrations, in anecdotes and legends of remarkable\r\nnovelty and interest; historical flowerets, most agreeably lightening\r\nand relieving the solid structure of a work for which the archives and\r\nlibraries of Madrid and Barcelona, the manuscripts of the old Spanish\r\nand Portuguese chroniclers, and the writings of more modern historians\r\nof various nations, have been with conscientious diligence ransacked\r\nand compared. The result has been a book equal in all respects to Mr\r\nPrescott's delightful _History of Ferdinand and Isabella_, to which it\r\nforms a suitable companion. As a master of classic and antiquarian\r\nlore, the Frenchman is superior to the American, to whom he yields\r\nnothing in the vigour of his diction and the grace of his style.\r\n\r\nWhen Alphonso the Eleventh, king of Castile, died of the plague, in\r\nhis camp before Gibraltar, upon Good Friday of the year 1350, the\r\nIberian peninsula consisted of five distinct and independent\r\nmonarchies--Castile, Arragon, Navarre, Portugal, and Granada. The\r\nfirst of the five, which extended from Biscay and Galicia to Tarifa,\r\nthe southernmost town in Europe, was by far the most extensive and\r\npowerful; the second comprised Arragon, Catalonia, and Valencia;\r\nNavarre, poor and scantily peopled, was important as commanding the\r\nprincipal passes of the Pyrenees, which its monarch could throw open\r\nto a French or English army; Portugal had nearly the same limits as at\r\nthe present day; the Moors, the boundary of whose European empire had\r\nlong been narrowing, still maintained a precarious footing in the\r\nkingdom of Granada. Alphonso, upon his accession in 1308, had found\r\nCastile a prey to anarchy, and groaning under feudal oppression. The\r\naudacity of the _ricos hombres_, or nobles,[22] had greatly increased\r\nduring long minorities, and under the reign of feeble princes. Whilst\r\nthey fought amongst themselves for privilege of pillage, the peasantry\r\nand inhabitants of towns, exasperated by the evils inflicted on them,\r\nfrequently rose in arms, and exercised bloody reprisals. A\r\ncontemporary author, quoted at length by M. Mérimée, represents the\r\nnobility as living by plunder, and abetted by the king's guardians.\r\nCertain towns refused to acknowledge these guardians, detained the\r\nking's revenue, and kept men-at-arms to oppress and rob the poor.\r\nJustice was nowhere in the kingdom; and the roads were impassable by\r\ntravellers, except in strong bodies, and well-armed. None dwelt in\r\nunwalled places; and so great was the evil throughout the land, that\r\nno one was surprised at meeting with murdered men upon the highways.\r\nThe king's guardians daily imposed new and excessive taxes; towns were\r\ndeserted, and the peasantry suffered exceedingly. Alphonso, a\r\ncourageous and intelligent prince, saw the evil, and resolved to\r\nremedy it. Without a party of his own, he was compelled to throw\r\nhimself into the arms of one of the great factions desolating the\r\ncountry. By its aid he destroyed the others, and then found himself\r\nstrong enough to rule in his own realm. Having proved his power, he\r\nmade an example of the most unruly, and pardoned the others. Then, to\r\ngive occupation to his warlike and turbulent nobility, he led them\r\nagainst the Moors of Granada; thus turning to his glory, and to the\r\naggrandisement of his dominions, the arms which previously had been\r\nbrandished but in civil contest. The commons of Castile, grateful for\r\ntheir deliverance from internal war, and from the exactions of the\r\nrich men, sent him soldiers, and generously supplied him with money.\r\nHe compelled the clergy to make sacrifices which, at another period,\r\nwould have compromised the tranquillity of the kingdom.[23] But he was\r\nvaliant and generous, and had the love of the people; not a voice was\r\nraised to oppose him. On the 29th October 1340, the army of Castile\r\nencountered, near Tarifa, that of Granada, whose ranks were swelled by\r\nprodigious reinforcements from the opposite shores of Barbary. The\r\nbattle of Rio Salado was fought; victory loudly declared herself for\r\nthe Christians: two hundred thousand Moors (it is said) remained upon\r\nthe field, and the power of the Mussulman in Spain was broken for\r\never. Following up his success, Alphonso took Algesiras after a long\r\nsiege, and was besieging Gibraltar when he was carried off by the\r\nfamous black plague, which for several years had ravaged Europe. His\r\ndeath was mourned by all Spain; and the mere terror of his name would\r\nseem to have dictated the advantageous treaty of peace concluded soon\r\nafterwards with the Saracen.\r\n\r\nAlphonso, a better king than husband, left behind him one legitimate\r\nson, Don Pedro--who at his father's death was fifteen years old, and\r\nwhose mother, Doña Maria, was a Portuguese princess--and ten bastards,\r\na daughter and nine sons, children of his mistress Leonora de Guzman.\r\nIn 1350, the first-born of this illegitimate progeny, Don Henry, was\r\neighteen years of age; he had the establishment of a prince of the\r\nblood, the magnificent domain of Trastamare, and the title of count.\r\nHis twin-brother, Don Fadrique, was grand-master of the Knights of\r\nSantiago. The two young men had won their spurs at Gibraltar, whilst\r\nthe Infante Pedro, rightful heir to the crown, had been kept in\r\nretirement at Seville, a witness of his mother's daily humiliations,\r\nand himself neglected by the courtiers, always prompt to follow a\r\nking's example. Idle in a deserted court, he passed his time in\r\nweeping over his mother's injuries and his own. Youthful impressions\r\nare ineffaceable. Jealousy and hatred were the first sentiments\r\nexperienced by Don Pedro. Brought up by a feeble and offended woman,\r\nthe first lessons he imbibed were those of dissimulation and revenge.\r\n\r\nThe premature and unexpected death of Don Alphonso was the alarum of a\r\nhost of ambitions. Amongst the great patricians of Spain, two in\r\nparticular were designated, by public opinion, to take the chief\r\ndirection of affairs: these were--Juan Alonzo de Alburquerque, and\r\nJuan Nuñez de Lara. The former, a Portuguese by birth, but holding\r\nvast estates in Spain, had stood beside Don Alphonso during his\r\nstruggle with his nobles; had rendered him great, and, to all\r\nappearance, disinterested services; and had been rewarded by the\r\nking's entire confidence. Grand chancellor and prime minister, he had\r\nalso had charge of Don Pedro's education. He had great influence with\r\nthe queen-mother, and had always skilfully avoided collision with\r\nLeonora de Guzman, who nevertheless feared and disliked him as a\r\nsecret and dangerous foe. All circumstances considered, Juan de Lara,\r\nalthough connected by blood with the royal family, and possessing, as\r\nLord of Biscay, great power in the north of Spain, thought it\r\nunadvisable to enter the lists with Alburquerque, who, on the other\r\nhand, openly sought his alliance, and even offered to divide with him\r\nthe authority devolved upon him by the king's death. With all this\r\napparent frankness there was little real friendship; and it was well\r\nunderstood that henceforward the leading characters on the political\r\nstage divided themselves into two opponent parties. On the one hand\r\nwere the dowager-queen Maria, Pedro the First, and the astute and\r\nprudent Alburquerque. Opposed to these, but with little union, and\r\nwith various views and pretensions, were Juan de Lara, his nephew,\r\n(the lord of Villena)--whose sister was soon afterwards secretly\r\nmarried to Henry of Trastamare--Leonora de Guzman, and her three\r\neldest sons. The third of these, Don Tello, was younger than Don\r\nPedro, but he was crafty and selfish beyond his years.\r\n\r\nAlphonso had hardly given up the ghost, when the reaction commenced.\r\nLeonora fled before the angry countenance of the injured queen-mother.\r\nRefused protection by Lara, from whom she first sought it, she\r\nrepaired to her strong fortress of Medina-Sidonia, a gift from her\r\nroyal lover. Its governor, her relative, Don Alonzo Coronel, although\r\nreputed a valiant and loyal knight, and, moreover, personally attached\r\nto the faction of the Laras, resigned his command, and would not be\r\nprevailed with to resume it. And amongst all the nobles and\r\nchevaliers, who during Alphonso's life professed themselves devoted to\r\nher, she now could not find one to defend her castle. She saw that her\r\ncause was desperate. Vague accusations were brought against her, of\r\nconspiracy against the new king; and from all sides alarming rumours\r\nreached her of her sons' arrest and probable execution. She lost\r\ncourage, and gave up her castle to Alburquerque, in exchange for a\r\nsafe-conduct to Seville, which was not respected; for, on her arrival\r\nthere, she was shut up in the Alcazar, and treated as a prisoner of\r\nstate. Meanwhile her two eldest sons endeavoured to stir up civil war.\r\nThey were totally unsuccessful, and finally esteemed themselves\r\nfortunate in being allowed to make their submission, and do homage to\r\nthe king. Alburquerque affected to treat them as refractory boys, and\r\nreserved his wrath for their mother, who, even in captivity, proved\r\nherself formidable. By her contrivance, the marriage of Don Henry and\r\nof the niece of Juan de Lara was secretly celebrated and consummated,\r\nin the palace that served her as a prison. When informed, a few hours\r\nsubsequently, of the trick that had been played them, the queen-mother\r\nand Alburquerque were furious. Doña Leonora was sent into strict\r\nconfinement, in the castle of Carmona. \"As to the Count Don Henry, he\r\nwas on his guard, and did not wait his enemies' vengeance: he left\r\nSeville by stealth, taking with him a quantity of jewels received from\r\nhis mother, and accompanied by two faithful knights--all three having\r\ntheir faces covered with leathern masks, according to a custom of the\r\ntimes. By forced marches, and with great fatigue, they traversed the\r\nwhole of Spain unrecognised, and reached the Asturias, where they\r\ntrusted to find safety amongst devoted vassals.\"\r\n\r\nThe sudden and severe illness of Don Pedro gave rise to fresh\r\nintrigues, and Juan de Lara and Don Fernando of Arragon stood forth as\r\npretenders to the crown in the event of the king's death. His recovery\r\ncrushed their ambitious hopes, but might not have prevented a civil\r\nwar between the factions of the two aspirants, had not Don Juan de\r\nLara and his nephew been suddenly carried off by the prevailing\r\nepidemic. \"At any other moment,\" M. Mérimée remarks, \"the premature\r\ndeath of these two men would doubtless have thrown odious suspicions\r\non their adversaries. But in no contemporary author do I find the\r\nleast insinuation against Alburquerque, thus rid in one day of the\r\nchief obstacles to his ambition. This general respect for a man who\r\nwas the object of so many jealousies and hatreds, is an honourable\r\ntestimony, worthy of note, as a rare exception to the usage of the\r\ntimes, and which it would be supremely unjust now to attempt to\r\ninvalidate.\" Alburquerque was now the virtual ruler of Castile: the\r\nyoung king passed his time in hunting, and left all cares of state to\r\nhis sagacious minister, who worked hard to consolidate his master's\r\npower. The Cortes were convoked at Valladolid, whither Pedro proceeded\r\nto open them in person. He was accompanied by the queen-mother,\r\ndragging in her train the unfortunate Leonora de Guzman. At Llerena,\r\nin Estremadura, one of the principal commanderys of the Knights of\r\nSantiago, Don Fadrique, grand-master of that powerful order, received\r\nhis half-brother Pedro with great respect, and offered him the\r\nmagnificent hospitality of his house. He then asked and obtained\r\npermission to see his mother.\r\n\r\n     \"In presence of the jailers, mother and son, both so fallen\r\n     from their high fortune, threw themselves into each other's\r\n     arms, and during the hour to which their interview was\r\n     limited, they wept, without exchanging a word. Then a page\r\n     informed Don Fadrique that the king required his presence.\r\n     After a last embrace he left his mother, never again to\r\n     behold her. The unfortunate woman's doom was sealed. From\r\n     Llerena, by Alburquerque's order, she was conducted to the\r\n     castle of Talavera, belonging to the queen-mother, and\r\n     governed by Gutier Fernandez of Toledo, one of her liege men.\r\n     There Leonora did not long languish. A few days after her\r\n     arrival, a secretary of the queen brought the governor an\r\n     order for her death. The execution was secret and mysterious,\r\n     and it is certain Don Pedro had no cognisance of it.\r\n     Doubtless the queen had exacted from Alburquerque the\r\n     sacrifice of her rival, who was no longer protected by the\r\n     pity of Juan Nuñez de Lara. 'Many persons,' says Pero Lopez\r\n     de Ayala, a Spanish chronicler whom M. Mérimée has taken as\r\n     one of his principal authorities, and whose trustworthiness,\r\n     impugned by modern authors, he ably vindicates in his\r\n     preface, 'were grieved at this deed, foreseeing that from it\r\n     wars and scandal would spring, inasmuch as Leonora had sons\r\n     already grown up and well-connected.'\r\n\r\n     \"But the hour of vengeance was not yet come, and the sons of\r\n     Leonora bowed their heads before her assassins.\"\r\n\r\nOne of them, whose youth might have been deemed incapable of such\r\ndissimulation, went beyond mere submission. A few days after Leonora's\r\ndeath, Don Pedro, during a progress through various provinces of his\r\nkingdom, reached the town of Palencia, in whose neighbourhood Tello,\r\nthen hardly fifteen years old, and who, following the example of his\r\nelder brothers, kept aloof from the court, had shut himself up in the\r\ncastle of Palenzuela.\r\n\r\n     \"As there was some fear he might prove refractory, Juan\r\n     Manrique, a Castilian noble, was sent to assure him of the\r\n     king's good will towards him, and at the same time to gain\r\n     over the knights, his counsellors. Manrique succeeded in his\r\n     mission, and brought Don Tello to Palencia. Instructed by his\r\n     guide, the youth hastened to kiss his brother's hand. 'Don\r\n     Tello,' said the king, 'do you know that your mother, Doña\r\n     Leonora, is dead?' 'Sire,' replied the boy-courtier, 'I have\r\n     no other mother or father than your good favour.'\"\r\n\r\nThe royal bastards humbled and subdued for a time, Alburquerque turned\r\nhis attention to more powerful adversaries. The death of its two\r\nchiefs had not entirely dissipated the Lara faction, now headed by Don\r\nGarci Laso de la Vega--a puissant Castilian noble, and an inveterate\r\nenemy of the minister. Garci Laso was in the rich and disaffected city\r\nof Burgos; and on the king's approach he issued some leagues forth to\r\nmeet him, escorted by a little army of vassals and retainers. His\r\nenemies took care to call Pedro's attention to this martial retinue,\r\nas indicative of defiance rather than respect. And the Manrique above\r\nmentioned, a creature of Alburquerque's, and a private enemy of Garci\r\nLaso's, took opportunity to quarrel with the latter, and would have\r\ncharged him with his troop but for the king's interference. The\r\ncommons of Burgos, hearing of these quarrels, and standing in mortal\r\nfear of Alburquerque, sent a deputation to represent to Don Pedro the\r\ndanger the city would be in from the presence of rival factions within\r\nits walls, and begged of him to enter with only a small escort. They\r\nadded an expression of regret at the arrival of Alburquerque, whom\r\nthey knew to be ill-disposed towards them. Although the formula was\r\nrespectful and humble, the freedom of these remonstrances incensed the\r\nking, who at once entered the city with his whole force, spears raised\r\nand banners displayed. The citizens made no resistance; a few of those\r\nmost compromised fled. Manrique, who commanded the advanced guard,\r\nestablished himself in the Jews' quarter, which, separated by a strong\r\nwall, according to the custom of the time, from the rest of the town,\r\nformed a sort of internal citadel. Garci Laso, confiding in his great\r\npopularity, and in the fidelity of his vassals, remained in Burgos,\r\ntaking up his lodging in one of the archbishop's palaces, of which\r\nanother was occupied by the king and his mother. Alburquerque had\r\nquarters in another part of the town. Thus Burgos contained four\r\ncamps; and it seemed, says M. Mérimée, as if all the factions in the\r\nkingdom had taken rendezvous there, to settle their differences.\r\n\r\nThat night an esquire of the queen-mother secretly sought Garci Laso,\r\nbearing him a strange warning from that princess. \"Whatever invitation\r\nhe received, he was to beware of appearing before the king.\" The proud\r\nnoble despised caution, repaired next morning to the palace, was\r\narrested by the king's command, and in his presence, and suffered\r\ndeath the same day.[24] This execution (murder were perhaps a fitter\r\nword) was followed by others, and terror reigned in Burgos. \"Whosoever\r\nhad lifted up his voice to defend the privileges of the commons, or\r\nthe rights of Don Juan de Lara, knew no retreat safe enough to hide\r\nhis head. Don Henry himself feared to remain in the Asturias, and took\r\nrefuge on Portuguese territory.\" The implacable Alburquerque was\r\ndetermined utterly to crush and exterminate the faction of the Laras.\r\nThe possessions of that princely house were confiscated to the crown,\r\nthe orphan son of Don Juan de Lara died in Biscay, and his two\r\ndaughters fell into the hands of the minister, who detained them as\r\nhostages. But the party, although vanquished, was not yet annihilated.\r\nAlonso Coronel, the same who had abandoned Leonora de Guzman in her\r\nmisfortunes, and who had been rewarded with the banner and cauldron of\r\na _rico hombre_, with the vast lordship and strong castle of Aguilar,\r\naspired to become its leader. He opened a correspondence with Count\r\nTrastamare and Don Fadrique, who, as enemies of Alburquerque, seemed\r\nto him his natural allies. He attempted to treat with the King of\r\nGranada, and even with the Moors of Africa. Alburquerque decreed his\r\nruin, assembled a small army round the royal standard, and marched\r\nwith Don Pedro to besiege Aguilar. Summoned to surrender, Coronel\r\nreplied by a volley of arrows, and was forthwith declared a rebel and\r\ntraitor. Leaving a body of troops in observation before Aguilar, which\r\nwas capable of a long defence, Alburquerque and his royal pupil set\r\nout for the Asturias, seizing, as they passed, various castles and\r\nfortified places belonging to Coronel, which surrendered without\r\nserious resistance--excepting that of Burguillos, whose commander,\r\nJuan de Cañedo, a liege man of Coronel, made an obstinate defence.\r\nTaken alive, his hands were cut off by the cruel victors. Some months\r\nafterwards, when the king and his vindictive minister, with a powerful\r\narmy and battering train, had effected, after a long siege, a breach\r\nin the ramparts of Aguilar, \"the mutilated knight, his wounds hardly\r\nhealed, suddenly appeared in the camp, and with incredible hardihood\r\ndemanded of Pedro permission to enter the fortress and die by the side\r\nof his lord. His heroic fidelity excited the admiration of his\r\nenemies, and the favour was accorded him. Many envied Coronel the\r\nglory of inspiring such devoted attachment, and every one awaited with\r\nthrilling interest the last moments of a man whom all Castile was\r\naccustomed to consider as the model of an accomplished and valiant\r\nknight.\" The assault was given, the castle taken, and Coronel was led\r\nbefore Alburquerque. \"What!\" exclaimed the minister, on beholding his\r\nfoe, \"Coronel traitor in a kingdom where so much honour has been done\r\nhim!\" \"Don Juan,\" replied Coronel, \"we are sons of this Castile, which\r\nelevates men and casts them down. It is in vain to strive against\r\ndestiny. The mercy I ask of you is to put me to a speedy death, even\r\nas I, fourteen years ago to-day, put to death the Master of\r\nAlcantara.\"[25] \"The king, present at the interview, his visor\r\nlowered, listened incognito to this dialogue, doubtless admiring\r\nCoronel's coolness, but giving no orders, for he was unaccustomed to\r\ninterfere with his minister.\" Coronel and several distinguished\r\nknights and gentlemen were led a few paces off, and there beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe Lara faction scattered and weakened, circumstances seemed to\r\npromise Alburquerque a long lease of power, when a fatal mistake\r\nprepared his downfall. Pedro grew restless--his high spirit gave forth\r\nflashes; his minister saw that, to check the desire of governing for\r\nhimself, it was necessary to provide him with pursuits of more\r\nengrossing interest than the chase.\r\n\r\n     \"The reign of Don Alphonso had shown what power a mistress\r\n     might acquire, and the prudent minister would not leave to\r\n     chance the choice of the woman destined to play so important\r\n     a part. Fearing a rival, he wished an ally, or rather a\r\n     slave. He chose for the king, and blundered egregiously. He\r\n     thought to have found the person best suited to his designs,\r\n     in Doña Maria de Padilla, a young girl of noble birth,\r\n     brought up in the house of his wife, Doña Isabel de Meneses.\r\n     She was an orphan, issue of a noble family, formerly attached\r\n     to the Lara faction, and ruined by the last civil wars. Her\r\n     brother and uncle, poor and ambitious, lent themselves, it\r\n     was said, to the degrading bargain. Persuaded that Doña\r\n     Maria, brought up in his family, would always consider him as\r\n     a master, Alburquerque directed Don Pedro's attention to her,\r\n     and himself facilitated their first interview, which took\r\n     place during the expedition to the Asturias. Dona Maria de\r\n     Padilla, was small in stature, like the majority of Spanish\r\n     women, pretty, lively, full of that voluptuous grace peculiar\r\n     to the women of Southern Spain, and which our language has no\r\n     word exactly to express.[26] As yet the only indication of\r\n     talent she had given was her great sprightliness, which\r\n     amused the noble lady with whom she lived in an almost\r\n     servile capacity. Older than the king, she had over him the\r\n     advantage of having already mingled with the crowd, studied\r\n     men and observed the court. She soon proved herself worthy to\r\n     reign.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Padilla made little opposition to Alburquerque's project. Her\r\nuncle, Juan de Hinestrosa, himself conducted her to Don Pedro, and\r\nplaced her, it may almost be said, in his arms. The complaisance was\r\nroyally rewarded. Hinestrosa and the other relations of the favourite\r\nemerged from their obscurity, appeared at court, and soon stood high\r\nin their sovereign's favour, although the pliant uncle was the only\r\none who retained it till the end of his career. Subsequently, before\r\nthe Cortes of 1362, Don Pedro declared that he had been, from the\r\nfirst, privately married to Maria Padilla--thus invalidating his\r\npublic union with Blanche of Bourbon, with whom he had never lived,\r\nand after whose death the declaration was made. He produced three\r\nwitnesses of the marriage--the fourth, Juan de Hinestrosa, was then\r\ndead--who positively swore it had taken place in their presence. M.\r\nMérimée, examines the question minutely, quoting various writers on\r\nthe subject, and discussing it _pro_ and _con_; one of his strongest\r\narguments in favour of the marriage, being the improbability that so\r\nfaithful, loyal, and valiant a knight as Hinestrosa proved himself,\r\nwould have consented, under any temptation, to play the base part of a\r\npander. It would not be difficult, however, to trace contradictions\r\nnearly as great in the code of honour and morality of the chevaliers\r\nof the fourteenth century; and, very much nearer to our own times, it\r\nhas frequently been seen how large an amount of infamy of that kind\r\nthe royal purple has been held to cloak.\r\n\r\nIn a very few months after the equivocal union he had brought about,\r\nAlburquerque began to experience its bad effects. Maria Padilla\r\nsecretly incited the young king to shake off his leading-strings, and\r\ngrasp the reins of government. Afraid to do this boldly and abruptly,\r\nPedro conspired with the Padillas, and planned a reconciliation with\r\nhis brothers Henry and Tello, believing, in his inexperience, that he\r\ncould nowhere find better friends, or more disinterested advisers. The\r\nsecret of the plot was well kept: Alburquerque unsuspiciously accepted\r\na frivolous mission to the King of Portugal; during his absence, a\r\ntreaty of amity was concluded between the king and the two bastards.\r\nWhilst these intrigues went on, Blanche of Bourbon, niece of the King\r\nof France, waited at Valladolid, in company with the dowager queens of\r\nCastile and Arragon, until it should please Pedro to go thither and\r\nmarry her. Pedro had established himself at Torrijos near Toledo,\r\nholding tournaments and festivals in honour of his mistress, with whom\r\nhe was more in love than ever; and the French princess waited several\r\nmonths, to the great indignation of her suite of knights and nobles.\r\nSuddenly a severe countenance troubled the joy of Maria Padilla's\r\nlover. It was that of Alburquerque, who, in grave and regretful words,\r\nrepresented to the king the affront he put upon the house of France,\r\nand the anxiety of his subjects, who awaited, in his marriage, a\r\nguarantee of future tranquillity. It was of the utmost importance to\r\ngive a legitimate heir to the crown of Castile. Subjugated by the\r\nvoice of reason, and by the old ascendency of his austere counsellor,\r\nPedro set out for Valladolid, and was joined on his way by Count Henry\r\nand Don Tello, who came to meet him on foot and unarmed; kissed his\r\nfoot and his right hand, as he sat on horseback; and were received by\r\nhim with all honour and favour, to the mortification of Alburquerque,\r\nwho saw in this reconciliation a proof of the credit of the Padillas,\r\nand a humiliating blow to his authority. The mortification was all the\r\ngreater that he, a veteran politician, had been outwitted by mere\r\nchildren. On the third day of June the king's marriage took place, the\r\nroyal pair being conducted in great pomp to the church, mounted upon\r\nwhite palfreys, and attired in robes of gold brocade trimmed with\r\nermine--a costume then reserved for sovereigns. In their retinue,\r\nHenry of Trastamare had the precedence of the princes of Arragon--an\r\nhonour held excessive by some, and attributed by others to the\r\nsincerity of the reconciliation between the sons of Don Alphonso. A\r\ntournament and bull-fight succeeded the ceremony, and were renewed the\r\nnext day. \"But in the midst of these festivities, all eyes were fixed\r\nupon the newly-married pair. Coldness, and even aversion for his young\r\nbride, were visible upon the king's countenance; and as it was\r\ndifficult to understand how a man of his age, ardent and voluptuous,\r\ncould be insensible to the attractions of the French princess, many\r\nwhispered that he was fascinated by Maria Padilla, and that his eyes,\r\ncharmed by magic art, beheld a repulsive object in place of the young\r\nbeauty he led to the altar. Aversion, like sympathy, has its\r\ninexplicable mysteries.\"[27]\r\n\r\nUpon the second day after his marriage, Don Pedro being alone at\r\ndinner in his palace, (the dinner hour in those days was at nine or\r\nten in the morning,) his mother and aunt appeared before him, all in\r\ntears, and, having obtained a private audience, taxed him with being\r\nabout to desert his wife, and return to Maria Padilla. The king\r\nexpressed his astonishment that they should credit idle rumours, and\r\ndismissed them, repeating that he thought not of quitting Valladolid.\r\nAn hour afterwards he called for mules, saying he would go visit his\r\nmother; but, instead of doing so, he left the city, accompanied only\r\nby the brother of his mistress, Don Diego Padilla, and by two of his\r\nmost confidential gentlemen. Regular relays were in waiting, and he\r\nslept that night at sixteen long leagues from Valladolid. The next day\r\nDoña Maria met him at Puebla de Montalvan. This strange and indecent\r\nescapade was simultaneous with a complete transfer of the king's\r\nconfidence from Alburquerque to his brothers and the Padillas. The\r\nminister preserved his dignity to the last, and sent a haughty but\r\nrespectful message to his sovereign, by the mouth of his majordomo.\r\n\"You know, sire,\" concluded this knight, Rui Diaz Cabeza de Vaca, \"all\r\nthat Don Juan Alonzo has done for your service, and for that of the\r\nqueen your mother. He has been your chancellor from your birth. He has\r\nalways loyally served you, as he served the late king your father. For\r\nyou he exposed himself to great perils, when Doña Leonora de Guzman,\r\nand her faction, had all power in the kingdom. My master is still\r\nignorant of the crimes imputed to him: make them known to him, and he\r\nwill refute them. Nevertheless, if any knight do doubt his honour and\r\nhis loyalty, I, his vassal, am here ready to defend him with my body,\r\nand with arms in hand.\" Thus did the arrogant _ricos hombres_ of the\r\nfourteenth century dare address their sovereign, by the mouth of\r\ntheir knightly retainers. What a contrast between these bold-spoken,\r\nstrong-armed magnates, and the puny degenerate grandees of the present\r\nday, sunk in vice, effeminacy, and sloth, and to whom valour,\r\nchivalry, and patriotism are but empty sounds! Alburquerque is a fine\r\ntype of the feudal lord--noble as a crowned king, and almost as\r\npowerful. Receiving a cold and discouraging reply to Cabeza de Vaca's\r\nlofty harangue, he retired, followed by an army of adherents and\r\nvassals, to his vast domains and strong castle in Portugal. On their\r\npassage, his men-at-arms pillaged and devastated the country, that\r\nbeing then the most approved manner for a feudal lord to testify his\r\ndiscontent. Don Pedro ill concealed his joy at being thus easily rid\r\nof an importunate mentor, whose faithful services to himself and his\r\nfather rendered a positive dismissal a most ungraceful act, the shame\r\nof which was saved the king by Alburquerque's voluntary retreat. The\r\nreaction was complete: all the ex-minister's friends were dismissed,\r\nand their places filled by partisans of the Padillas. Many of his acts\r\nwere annulled, and several sentences he had given were reversed. Pedro\r\nhad no rest till he had effaced every vestige of his wise and prudent\r\nadministration. Ingratitude has too often been the vice of kings; in\r\nthis instance it brought its own punishment. A few months later we\r\nfind Henry of Trastamare, and his brother Tello, leagued with\r\nAlburquerque against the sovereign who had disgraced him in great\r\nmeasure on their account. This perfidy of the bastards was perfectly\r\nin keeping with the character of the age. \"To characterise the\r\nfourteenth century in Spain by its most prevalent vice,\" says M.\r\nMérimée, \"one should cite, in my opinion, neither brutality of\r\nmanners, nor rapacity, nor violence. The most prominent feature of\r\nthat sad period is its falseness and deceit: never did history\r\nregister so many acts of treason and perfidy. The century, rude in all\r\nother things, shows itself ingenious in the art of deception. It\r\nrevels in subtleties. In all agreements, and even in the code of\r\nchivalrous honour, it conceals ambiguities, by which interest knows\r\nwell how to profit. The oaths lavished in all transactions,\r\naccompanied by the most solemn ceremonies, are but vain formalities\r\nand matters of habit. He who plights his word, his hand upon the holy\r\nScriptures, is believed by none unless he deliver up his wife and\r\nchildren, or, better still, his fortresses, as hostages for his truth.\r\nThe latter pledge is held to be the only safe guarantee. Distrust is\r\ngeneral, and every man sees an enemy in his neighbour.\" The fidelity\r\nof this gloomy picture is fully confirmed by the events of Don Pedro's\r\nreign. Alburquerque set the example to his royal pupil, who was not\r\nslow to follow it, and who soon, in his turn, suffered from the\r\ndominant vice of the time.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of pressing forward through a book whose every page\r\noffers temptations to linger, prevents our tracing, in detail, the\r\nsubsequent events of Alburquerque's life. He died in the autumn of\r\n1354, almost suddenly, at Medina del Campo, which he and his\r\nconfederates had taken by assault, and given up to pillage. His\r\nphysician, Master Paul, an Italian attached to the house of Prince\r\nFerdinand of Arragon, was suspected of having mixed a subtle poison in\r\nthe draught he administered to him for an apparently trifling\r\nindisposition. Don Pedro, the person most interested in the death of\r\nhis quondam counsellor, and now bitter enemy, was accused of\r\ninstigating the deed, and magnificent presents subsequently made by\r\nhim to the leech, gave an air of probability to the suspicion. \"In his\r\nlast moments, Alburquerque belied not the firmness of his character.\r\nNear to death, he assembled his vassals, and made them swear to accept\r\nneither peace nor truce with the king, till they had obtained\r\nsatisfaction for his wrongs. He ordered his body to be carried at the\r\nhead of their battalion so long as the war lasted, as if resolved to\r\nabdicate his hatred and authority only after triumph. Enclosed in his\r\ncoffin, he still seemed to preside over the councils of the league;\r\nand, when deliberations were held, his corpse was interrogated, and\r\nhis majordomo, Cabeza de Vaca, replied in the name of his departed\r\nmaster.\" There is something solemn and affecting in this post-humous\r\ndeference, this homage paid by the living to the dead. Alburquerque\r\nwas unquestionably _the_ man of his day in the Peninsula: his grand\r\nand haughty figure stands out upon the historical canvass, in imposing\r\ncontrast with the boy-brawlers and intriguing women by whom he was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nDeserted by all--betrayed even by his own mother, who gave up his last\r\nstronghold whilst he was absent on a visit to his mistress--the king\r\nhad no resource but to throw himself into the hands of the rebels,\r\ntrusting to their magnanimity and loyalty to preserve him his crown.\r\nWith Hinestrosa, Simuel Levi his Jew treasurer, and Fernand Sanchez\r\nhis private chancellor, for sole companions--and followed by a few\r\nlackeys and inferior officers, mounted on mules and unarmed--he set\r\nout for Toro, then the headquarters of the insurgent league. \"Informed\r\nof the approach of this melancholy procession, the chiefs of the\r\nconfederates rode out to meet him, well mounted and in magnificent\r\ndresses, beneath which their armour was visible, as if to contrast\r\ntheir warlike equipage with the humble retinue of the vanquished king.\r\nAfter kissing his hand, they escorted him to the town with great cries\r\nof joy, caracoling about him, performing _fantasias_, pursuing each\r\nother, and throwing reeds in the Arab manner. It is said that when Don\r\nHenry approached his brother to salute him, the unfortunate monarch\r\ncould not restrain his tears. 'May God be merciful to you!' he said;\r\n'for my part, I pardon you.'\" There was no sincerity in this\r\nforgiveness; already, in the hour of his humiliation, Pedro had vowed\r\nhatred and vengeance against its authors. At present, however,\r\nartifice and intrigue were the only weapons at his disposal. By the\r\nassistance of Simuel the Jew, who was sincerely attached to him, and\r\nwho rendered him many and great services, he gained over a portion of\r\nthe revolted nobility, concluded an alliance with the royal family of\r\nArragon, and finally effected his escape from the sort of\r\nsemi-captivity in which he was held. \"Profiting by dense fog, Don\r\nPedro rode out of Toro very early in the morning, a falcon on his\r\nwrist, as though he went a-hawking, accompanied by Levi, and by his\r\nusual escort of some two hundred cavaliers. Either these were bribed,\r\nor the king devised means of detaching them from him, for he soon\r\nfound himself alone with the Jew. Then, following the rout to Segovia\r\nat full speed, in a few hours they were beyond pursuit.\" During the\r\nshort period of Pedro's captivity, a great change had taken place in\r\npublic feeling. The king's misfortunes, his youth and firmness,\r\ninterested many in his behalf. The Cortes, which he summoned at\r\nBurgos, a few days after his escape, granted all his demands of men\r\nand money. M. Mérimée thinks it probable the commons obtained from\r\nhim, in return, an extension of their privileges and franchises; but\r\nthis is mere conjecture, no records existing of the proceedings of\r\nthis Cortes, which was, in fact, rendered irregular by the absence of\r\nthe clerical deputies, the Pope having just excommunicated Don Pedro\r\nfor his adulteries. \"The excommunication, fulminated by a papal legate\r\nat Toledo, the 19th January 1355, does not appear to have altered, in\r\nany degree, the disposition of the people towards the king. On the\r\ncontrary, it excited indignation, now that he was reconciled with his\r\nsubjects; for Spaniards have always disliked foreign interference in\r\ntheir affairs.\" The thunders of Avignon lost not Pedro a single\r\npartisan. He replied to them by seizing the possessions of Cardinal\r\nGilles Albornoz, and of some other prelates; and, returning threat for\r\nthreat, he announced his intention of confiscating the domains of all\r\nthe bishops who should waver between him and the Pope. The rebellion\r\nof his nobles, the treason of his mother and friends, the humiliation\r\nhe had suffered, had wrought a marked change in the still plastic\r\ncharacter of the young sovereign. Hitherto we have seen him violent\r\nand impetuous; henceforward we shall find dissimulation and cruelty\r\nhis most prominent qualities. He had prided himself on chivalrous\r\nloyalty and honour; now all means were good that led to a triumph over\r\nhis enemies. Full of hatred and contempt for the great vassals who,\r\nafter having insolently vanquished him, basely sold the fruits of\r\ntheir victory for fair promises and for Simuel Levi's gold, he vowed\r\nto destroy their power, and to build up his authority upon the ruins\r\nof feudal tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe angry king lost no time in commencing the work of vengeance. After\r\na fierce contest in and around Toledo, he routed the army of Count\r\nHenry and Don Fadrique, slew all the wounded, put to death one of the\r\ntwenty leaguers, whom he caught in the town, (two had already been\r\nmassacred by his order at Medina del Campo,) imprisoned many nobles,\r\nas well as the Bishop of Siguenza, whose palace was given up to\r\npillage. \"Twenty burgesses of Toledo were publicly decapitated as\r\nabettors of the rebellion. Amongst the unfortunate persons condemned\r\nto death was a jeweller, upwards of eighty years old. His son threw\r\nhimself at the feet of Don Pedro, petitioning to die in place of his\r\nfather. If we may credit Ayala, this horrible exchange was accepted\r\nboth by the king and by the father himself.\" From Toledo, Pedro\r\nmarched on Toro, where the bastards, the queen-mother, and most of the\r\n_ricos hombres_ and knights who adhered to the league, had\r\nconcentrated their forces, and prepared an obstinate resistance. He\r\nestablished himself in a village near the town, but lacked the\r\nengines, instruments, and stores necessary to invest the place\r\nregularly. Money was scarce. Fortunately, Simuel Levi was at hand, the\r\npearl of finance ministers, compared to whom the Mons and Mendizabals\r\nof the nineteenth century are bunglers of the most feeble description.\r\n\r\n\"Don Pedro, in his quarters at Morales, was amusing himself one day by\r\nplaying at dice. Before him stood open his military chest, which was\r\nalso his play-purse. It contained 20,000 doubloons. 'Gold and silver,'\r\nsaid the king, in a melancholy tone,--'here is all I possess.' The\r\ngame over, Simuel took his master aside: 'Sire,' he said, 'you have\r\naffronted me before all the court. Since I am your treasurer, is it\r\nnot disgraceful for me that my master be not richer? Hitherto, your\r\ncollectors have relied too much upon your easiness and indulgence. Now\r\nthat you are of an age to reign for yourself, that all Castile loves\r\nand fears you, it is time to put an end to disorder. Only be pleased\r\nto authorise me to treat with your officers of the finances, and\r\nconfide to me two of your castles, and I pledge myself that, in a very\r\nshort time, you shall have in each of them a treasure of greater value\r\nthan the contents of this casket.'\" The king gladly gave what was\r\nrequired of him, and the Jew kept his word. His manner of doing so\r\npaints the strange immorality of the times. It was customary to pay\r\nall court-salaries and pensions by orders on the royal receivers of\r\nimposts. These usually paid only a part of the amount of such orders,\r\nand unless the demand for the balance were backed by force, it was\r\nnever honoured. Simuel Levi, having men-at-arms, jailers, and\r\nexecutioners at his orders, compelled these reluctant paymasters to\r\ndisgorge all arrears; then sending for the king's creditors, he\r\noffered them fifty per cent of their due against receipts for the\r\nwhole. Most of them, never expecting to recover a real of the sums\r\nkept back by the dishonest stewards, caught eagerly at the offer. This\r\nclumsy fraud, against which none found anything to say, brought\r\nconsiderable wealth into the king's coffers, and gave him the highest\r\nopinion of his treasurer, by whose careful administration he soon\r\nfound himself the richest monarch in Spain.\r\n\r\nMoney removed the obstacles to the siege of Toro. Before the place was\r\ninvested, however, Henry of Trastamare, with his usual precocious\r\nselfishness and prudence, found a pretext to leave it. A breach made,\r\nand part of the exterior fortifications in the possession of the royal\r\ntroops, the Master of Santiago passed over to the king, who, from the\r\nopposite bank of the Douro, had given him verbal promise of pardon.\r\nThe same night an officer of the civic guard opened the gates of the\r\ntown to Pedro and his army. At daybreak the garrison of the castle saw\r\nthemselves surrounded by overpowering forces, about to mount to the\r\nassault. \"None spoke of resistance, or even of capitulation; safety of\r\nlife was almost more than they dared hope. Fearing the king's fury,\r\nall refused to go out and implore his clemency. At last a Navarrese\r\nknight, named Martin Abarca, who in the last troubles had taken part\r\nwith the bastards, risked himself at a postern, holding in his arms a\r\nchild of twelve or thirteen years, natural son of King Alphonso and of\r\nDoña Leonora. Recognising the king by his armour, he called to him and\r\nsaid--'Sire! grant me pardon, and I hasten to throw myself at your\r\nfeet, and to restore to you your brother Don Juan!'--'Martin Abarca,'\r\nsaid the king, 'I pardon my brother Don Juan; but for you, no\r\nmercy!'--'Well!' said the Navarrese, crossing the ditch, 'do with me\r\nas you list.' And, still carrying the child, he prostrated himself\r\nbefore the king. Don Pedro, touched by this hardihood of despair, gave\r\nhim his life in presence of all his knights.\" This clemency was soon\r\nobscured by the terrible scenes that followed the surrender of the\r\ncastle, when the robe of Pedro's own mother was stained with the blood\r\nof the nobles struck down by her side. She fainted with\r\nhorror--perhaps with grief; for Martin Telho, a Portuguese, and her\r\nreputed lover, was amongst the murdered; and, on recovering her\r\nsenses, \"she saw herself sustained in the arms of rude soldiers, her\r\nfeet in a pool of blood, whilst four mangled bodies lay before her,\r\nalready stripped of their armour and clothes. Then, despair and fury\r\nrestoring her strength, she cursed her son, in a voice broken by sobs,\r\nand accused him of having for ever dishonoured her. She was led away\r\nto her palace, and there treated with the mockery of respect which the\r\nleaguers had shown, the year before, to their royal captive.\"\r\n\r\nIt were quite incompatible with the necessary limits of this paper, to\r\ngive even the most meagre outline of the numerous vicissitudes of Don\r\nPedro's reign, and to glance at a tithe of the remarkable events and\r\nstriking incidents his biographer has so industriously and tastefully\r\nassembled. M. Mérimée's work does not bear condensing in a review;\r\nindeed, it is itself a condensation: an ordinary writer would have\r\nspread the same matter over twice the space, and still have deemed\r\nhimself concise. The impression left on the reader's mind by this\r\nspirited and admirably written volume is, that not one page could be\r\nomitted without being missed. Sparing as we have been of detail, and\r\nalthough confining ourselves to a glance at prominent circumstances,\r\nwe are still at the very commencement of Don Pedro's reign--the\r\nbusiest and most stirring, perhaps, that ever was comprised within the\r\nspace of twenty years. Not a few of this warlike, cruel, and amorous\r\nmonarch's adventures have been handed down in the form of ballads and\r\nheroic legends, still current in southern Spain, where many of them\r\nhave the weight of history--although the license of poetry, and the\r\ntransmission through many generations, have frequently greatly\r\ndistorted facts. Amongst the numerous objects of his fickle passion\r\nwas Doña Aldonza Coronel, who, after some show of resistance, and\r\ntaking refuge for a while in a convent where her sister was nun,\r\nshowed herself sensible to the solicitations of royalty. Popular\r\ntradition has substituted for Aldonza her sister Maria, widow of Juan\r\nde la Cerda, whom Pedro had put to death. The people of Seville the\r\nBeautiful still believe and tell how \"Doña Maria, chaste as lovely,\r\nindignantly repulsed the king's addresses. But in vain did she oppose\r\nthe gratings of the convent of St Clara as a bulwark against the\r\nimpetuous passion of the tyrant. Warned that his satellites were about\r\nto drag her from the sanctuary, she ordered a large hole to be dug in\r\nthe convent garden, in which she lay down, and had herself covered\r\nwith branches and earth. The fresh-turned soil would infallibly have\r\nbetrayed her, had not a miracle supervened. Scarcely had she entered\r\nthis manner of tomb, when flowers and herbage sprang up over it, so\r\nthat nothing distinguished it from the surrounding grass. The king,\r\ndiscrediting the report of his emissaries, went in person to the\r\nconvent to carry off the beautiful widow; this time it was not a\r\nmiracle, but an heroic stratagem, that saved the noble matron.\r\nAbhorring the fatal beauty that thus exposed her to outrage, she\r\nseized, with a steady hand, a vase of boiling oil, and poured it over\r\nher face and bosom; then, covered with horrible burns, she presented\r\nherself to the king, and made him fly in terror, by declaring herself\r\nafflicted with leprosy. 'On her body, which has been miraculously\r\npreserved,' says Zuñiga, 'are still visible the traces of the burning\r\nliquid, and assuredly it may with good reason be deemed the body of a\r\nsaint.'[28] I have dwelt upon this legend, unknown to the contemporary\r\nauthors,\" adds M. Mérimée, \"to give an idea of the transformation Don\r\nPedro's history has undergone at the hands of tradition, and of the\r\npoetical colours imparted to it by the lively imagination of the\r\npeople of Spain. After the marvellous narrative, comes the simple\r\ntruth of history.\" Ballads and traditions are echoes of the popular\r\nvoice; and, in many of those relating to Don Pedro, we may trace a\r\ndisposition to extenuate his faults, extol his justice, and bring into\r\nrelief his occasional acts of generosity. The truth is, that, although\r\nharsh and relentless with his arrogant nobles, he was affable with the\r\npeople, who beheld in him their deliverer from oppression, and the\r\nunflinching opponent of the iniquities of the feudal system. Facility\r\nof access is a great source of popularity in Spain, where the\r\nindependent tone and bearing of the lower orders often surprise\r\nforeigners. In no country in the world is the character of the people\r\nmore free from servility. In the poorest peasant there is an air of\r\nnative dignity and self-respect, which he loves to see responded to by\r\nconsideration and affability on the part of his superiors. Don Pedro\r\nwas very accessible to his subjects. When he met his first Cortes at\r\nValladolid, in 1351, he promised the deputies of the commons that\r\nevery Castilian should have liberty to appeal from the decisions of\r\nthe magistrates to the king in person. This promise he kept better\r\nthan was his wont. In the court of the Alcazar at Seville, near the\r\ngate known as that of the Banners, are shown the remains of a\r\ntribunal, in the open air, where he sat to give his judgments. He had\r\nanother habit likely to conciliate and please the people. In imitation\r\nof the Eastern caliphs, whose adventures had doubtless amused his\r\nchildhood, he loved to disguise himself, and to ramble at night in the\r\nstreets of Seville--to listen to the conversation of the populace, to\r\nseek adventures, and overlook the police. Here was a suggestive text\r\nfor balladists and romance writers, who have largely availed\r\nthemselves of it. The story of Don Pedro's duel with a stranger, with\r\nwhom he quarrelled on one of these expeditions, is well known. An old\r\nwoman, sole witness of the encounter, deposed that the combatants had\r\ntheir faces muffled in their cloaks, but that the knees of one of them\r\nmade a cracking noise in walking. This was known to be a peculiarity\r\nof Don Pedro's. Justice was puzzled. The king had killed his\r\nadversary, and had thereby incurred the punishment of decapitation.\r\nPedro had his head carved in stone, and placed in a niche in the\r\nstreet where the duel had taken place. The bust, which was\r\nunfortunately renewed in the seventeenth century, is still to be seen\r\nat Seville, in the street of the Candilejo, which takes its name,\r\naccording to Zuñiga, from the lamp by whose light the duel was fought.\r\nCondemned at his own tribunal, we need not wonder at the lenity of his\r\nsentence, more creditable to the royal culprit's invention than to his\r\njustice. He appears to have been frequently ingenious in his\r\njudgments. A rich priest had seriously injured a poor shoemaker, and,\r\nfor sole punishment, was condemned by the ecclesiastical tribunal to a\r\nfew months' suspension from his sacerdotal functions. The shoemaker,\r\ndeeming the chastisement inadequate, waylaid his enemy, and soundly\r\ndrubbed him. Arrested immediately, he was condemned to death. He\r\nappealed to the king. The partiality of the ecclesiastical judges had\r\nexcited some scandal; Don Pedro parodied their sentence by condemning\r\nthe shoemaker to make no shoes for one year. Whether this anecdote be\r\ntrue, or a mere invention, it is certain that a remarkable law was\r\nadded, about that time, to the code of the city of Seville, to the\r\neffect that a layman, injuring an ecclesiastic, should thenceforward\r\nbe liable only to the same punishment that the priest would have\r\nincurred by a like offence against the layman.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the Grand-master of Santiago, slain by his brother's\r\norder, and the death of the unfortunate French princess, who found a\r\ntyrant where she expected a husband, are recorded in the Romances of\r\nthe Master Don Fadrique, and of Blanche de Bourbon. The fate of\r\nBlanche, attributed by contemporary chroniclers and modern historians\r\nto Don Pedro's orders, is one of the blackest of the stains upon his\r\ncharacter. The poor queen died in the castle of Jerez--some say by\r\npoison, others by the mace of an arbalister of the guard. She had\r\nlived but twenty-five years, ten of which she had passed in prison.\r\nThere is no appearance or probability that Maria Padilla instigated\r\nher assassination. That favourite was kind-hearted and merciful, and\r\non more than one occasion we find her interceding with the king for\r\nthe lives of his enemies and prisoners, and weeping when her\r\nsupplications proved fruitless. The ballad makes free with fact, and\r\nsacrifices truth to poetry. It was dramatically correct that the\r\nmistress should instigate the wife's death. \"Be not so sad, Doña Maria\r\nde Padilla,\" says the king; \"if I married twice, it was for your\r\nadvantage, and to show my contempt for this Blanche of Bourbon. I send\r\nher to Medina Sidonia, to work me a banner--the ground, colour of her\r\nblood, the embroidery, of her tears. This banner, Doña Maria, I will\r\nhave it made for you:\" and forthwith the ruthless arbalister departs,\r\nafter a knight had refused to do the felon deed. \"Oh France, my noble\r\ncountry! oh my Bourbon blood!\" cries poor Blanche; \"to-day I complete\r\nmy seventeen years, and enter my eighteenth. What have I done to you,\r\nCastile? The crowns you gave me were crowns of blood and sighs!\" And\r\nthus she laments till the mace falls, \"and the brains of her head are\r\nstrewed about the hall.\" The song-writer, amongst other liberties, has\r\nstruck eight years off the victim's age, perhaps with the idea of\r\nrendering her more interesting. The exact manner of her death seems\r\nuncertain, although Ayala agrees with the ballad, and most subsequent\r\nhistorians have followed his version. M. Mérimée is disposed to\r\nexculpate Pedro, alleging the complete inutility of the murder, and\r\nthat ten years of captivity and ill treatment were sufficient to\r\naccount for the queen's death. Admitting the latter plea, we cannot\r\nsee in it a diminution of the crime. In either case Pedro was the\r\nmurderer of his hapless wife, who was innocent of all offence against\r\nhim; and his extraordinary aversion for whom might well give rise, in\r\nthat superstitious age, to the tales of sorcery and magic charms\r\nalready quoted. The details of Don Fadrique's death are more precise\r\nand authentic, as it was also more merited. But, although the Master\r\nof Santiago had been guilty of many acts of treason, and at the time\r\nof his death was conspiring against the king, his execution by a\r\nbrother's order, and before a brother's eyes, is shocking and\r\nrepugnant. It was Don Fadrique's policy, at that moment, to parade the\r\nutmost devotion to Pedro, the better to mask his secret plans.\r\nArriving one day at Seville, on a visit to the king, he found the\r\nlatter playing at draughts with a courtier. True to his habits of\r\ndissimulation, Pedro, who only a few hours previously had decided on\r\nthe Master's death, received him with a frank air and pleasant smile,\r\nand gave him his hand to kiss; and then, seeing that he was well\r\nattended, bade him take up his quarters, and then return. After\r\nvisiting Maria Padilla, who gazed at him with tears in her\r\neyes,--knowing his doom, but not daring to warn him,--Fadrique went\r\ndown into the court, found his escort gone, and the gates shut.\r\nSurprised and uneasy, he hesitated what to do, when two knights\r\nsummoned him to the king's apartments, in a detached building within\r\nthe walls of the Alcazar.\r\n\r\n     \"At the door stood Pero Lopez Padilla, chief of the\r\n     mace-bearers of the guard, with four of his people. Don\r\n     Fadrique, still accompanied by the Master of Calatrava (Diego\r\n     Padilla) knocked at the door. Only one of its folds opened,\r\n     and within appeared the king, who forthwith exclaimed, 'Pero\r\n     Lopez, arrest the Master!'--'Which of the two, sire?'\r\n     inquired the officer, hesitating between Don Fadrique and Don\r\n     Diego de Padilla. 'The Master of Santiago!' replied the king\r\n     in a voice of thunder. Immediately Pero Lopez, seizing Don\r\n     Fadrique's arm, said, 'You are my prisoner.' Don Fadrique,\r\n     astounded, made no resistance; when the king cried out,\r\n     'Arbalisters, kill the Master of Santiago!' Surprise, and\r\n     respect for the red cross of St James, for an instant\r\n     fettered the men to the spot. Then one of the knights of the\r\n     palace, advancing to the door, said: 'Traitors! what do you?\r\n     Heard you not the king's command to kill the Master?' The\r\n     arbalisters lifted the mace, when Don Fadrique, vigorously\r\n     shaking off the grasp of Pero Lopez, sprang back into the\r\n     court with the intention of defending himself. But the hilt\r\n     of his sword, which he wore under the large mantle of his\r\n     order, was entangled with the belt, and he could not draw.\r\n     Pursued by the arbalisters, he ran to and fro in the court,\r\n     avoiding their blows, but unable to get his sword out. At\r\n     last one of the king's guards, named Nuño Fernandez, struck\r\n     him on the head with his mace, and knocked him down; and the\r\n     three others immediately showered their blows upon the fallen\r\n     man, who lay bathed in his blood when Don Pedro came down\r\n     into the court, seeking the knights of Santiago, to slay them\r\n     with their chief.\"\r\n\r\nIn the very chamber of Maria Padilla, the assassin-king gave with his\r\nown hand the first stab to his brother's esquire, who had taken refuge\r\nthere. Leaving the ensanguined boudoir, (Maria Padilla's apartments in\r\nthe Alcazar were a sort of harem, where much oriental pomp was\r\nobserved,) he returned to the Master, and finding he still breathed,\r\nhe gave his dagger to an African slave to despatch him. Then he sat\r\ndown to dinner in an apartment two paces distant from his brother's\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\nIt is a relief to turn from acts of such unnatural barbarity to the\r\ntraits of chivalrous generosity that sparkle, at long intervals, it is\r\ntrue, upon the dark background of Pedro's character. One of these,\r\nconnected with a singularly romantic incident, is attested by Alonzo\r\nMartinez de Talavera, chaplain of John II. of Castile, a chronicler M.\r\nMérimée is disposed to hold in high esteem. In one of his campaigns\r\nagainst his rebellious brethren and their Arragonese allies, the king\r\nlaid siege to the castle of Cabezon, belonging to Count Trastamare;\r\nand whose governor, summoned to yield, refused even to parley.\r\n\r\n     \"Yet the whole garrison of the castle consisted but of ten\r\n     esquires, Castilian exiles; but behind thick and lofty walls,\r\n     in a tower built on perpendicular rocks, and against which\r\n     battering engines could not be brought, ten resolute men\r\n     might defend themselves against an army, and need only yield\r\n     to famine. The place being well provisioned, the siege was\r\n     likely to be long. But the ten esquires, all young men, were\r\n     better able bravely to repulse an assault than patiently to\r\n     endure the tedium of a blockade. Time hung heavy upon their\r\n     hands, they wanted amusement, and at last they insolently\r\n     insisted that the governor should give them women to keep\r\n     them company in their eyrie. Now, the only women in Cabezon\r\n     were the governor's wife and daughter. 'If you do not deliver\r\n     them to us, to be dealt with as we list,' said the garrison\r\n     to the governor, 'we abandon your castle, or, better still,\r\n     we open its gate to the King of Castile!' In such an\r\n     emergency, the code of chivalrous honour was stringent. At\r\n     the siege of Tarifa, Alonzo Perez de Guzman, summoned to\r\n     surrender the town, under penalty of seeing his son massacred\r\n     before his eyes, answered the Moors by throwing them his\r\n     sword, wherewith to slay the child. This action, which\r\n     procured the governor of Tarifa the surname of Guzman the\r\n     Good, was a _fazaña_ (an exploit)--one of those heroic\r\n     precedents which everyman of honour was bound to imitate.\r\n     _Permittitur homicidium filii potius quam deditio castelli_,\r\n     is the axiom of a doctor in chivalry of that epoch. The\r\n     governor of Cabezon, as magnanimous in his way as Guzman the\r\n     Good, so arranged matters that his garrison no longer thought\r\n     of abandoning him. But two of the esquires, less corrupt than\r\n     their comrades, conceived a horror of their treason, and\r\n     escaped from the castle. Led before the king, they informed\r\n     him of the mutiny they had witnessed, and of its\r\n     consequences. Don Pedro, indignant, forthwith entreated the\r\n     governor to let him do justice on the offenders. In exchange\r\n     for those felons, he offered ten gentlemen of his army, who,\r\n     before entering Cabezon, should take a solemn oath to defend\r\n     the castle against all assailants, even against the king\r\n     himself, and to die at their posts with the governor. This\r\n     proposal having been accepted, the king had the traitors\r\n     quartered, and their remains were afterwards burned. Through\r\n     the colours with which a romantic imagination has adorned\r\n     this incident, it is difficult to separate truth from\r\n     fiction; but we at least distinguish the popular opinion of\r\n     the character of Don Pedro--a strange amalgamation of\r\n     chivalrous sentiments, and of love of justice, carried to\r\n     ferocity.\"\r\n\r\nThere was very little justice, or gratitude either, in the king's\r\ntreatment of his Jew treasurer. Don Simuel el Levi,[29] Israelite\r\nthough he was, had proved himself a stancher friend and more loyal\r\nsubject than any Christian of Pedro's court. He had borne him company\r\nin his captivity--had aided his escape--had renovated his\r\nfinances--had been his minister, treasurer, and confidant. Suddenly\r\nSimuel was thrown into prison. On the same day, and throughout the\r\nkingdom, his kinsmen and agents were all arrested. His crime was his\r\nprodigious wealth. Pedro, ignorant of the resources of trade, could\r\nnot believe that his treasurer had grown rich otherwise than at his\r\nexpense. Simuel's property was seized; then, as he was suspected of\r\nhaving concealed the greater part of his treasures, he was taken to\r\nSeville and put to the torture, under which he expired. The king is\r\nsaid to have found in his coffers large sums of gold and silver,\r\nbesides a quantity of jewels and rich stuffs, all of which he\r\nconfiscated. A sum of 300,000 doubloons was also found in the hands of\r\nSimuel's relatives, receivers under his orders: this proceeded from\r\nthe taxes, whose collection was intrusted to him, and was about to be\r\npaid into the king's exchequer. There is reason to believe, adds M.\r\nMérimée, that Levi, like Jacques Coeur a century later, was the victim\r\nof the ignorance and cupidity of a master he had faithfully\r\nserved.[30]\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt so long upon the early pages of this history, and have\r\nso often been led astray by the interest of the notes and anecdotes\r\nwith which they are thickly strewn, that we have left ourselves\r\nwithout space for a notice of those portions of the bulky volume most\r\nlikely to rivet the attention of the English reader. When the _Grandes\r\nCompagnies_--those formidable condottieri, who, for a time, may be\r\nsaid to have ruled in France--crossed the Pyrenees to fight for Henry\r\nof Trastamare, whilst the troops of England and Guyenne came to the\r\nhelp of Pedro; when the great champions of their respective countries,\r\nEdward the Black Prince and Bertrand du Guesclin, bared steel in the\r\ncivil strife of Spain,--then came the tug of war and fierce\r\nencounter--then did the tide of battle roll its broad impetuous\r\nstream. For even at that remote period, although Spain boasted a\r\nvaliant chivalry and stubborn men-at-arms, her wars were often a\r\nseries of skirmishes, surprises, treacheries, and camp-intrigues,\r\nrather than of pitched battles in the field. The same sluggishness and\r\nindolence on the part of Spanish generals, so conspicuous at the\r\npresent day, was then frequently observable. We read of\r\ndivisions--whose timely arrival would have changed the fate of a\r\nbattle--coming up so slowly that their friends were beaten before they\r\nappeared; of generals marching out, and marching back again, without\r\nstriking a single blow; or remaining, for days together, gazing at\r\ntheir opponents without risking an attack. Even then, the Spaniards\r\nwere a nation of guerillas.\r\n\r\n     \"Accustomed to a war of rapid skirmishes against the Moors,\r\n     they had adopted their mode of fighting. Covered with light\r\n     coats of mail, or with doublets of quilted cloth, mounted on\r\n     light and active horses, their _genetaires_ (light horsemen)\r\n     hurled their javelins at a gallop, then turned bridle,\r\n     without caring to keep their ranks. With the exception of the\r\n     military orders, better armed and disciplined than the\r\n     _genetaires_, the Spanish cavalry were unable to offer\r\n     resistance in line to the English or French men-at-arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe infantry of Spain, afterwards esteemed the best in Europe, was at\r\nthat time so lightly considered as to be rarely enumerated in the\r\nstrength of an army. The English footsoldiers, on the other hand, had\r\nalready achieved a brilliant reputation. \"Armed with tall bows of\r\nyew,\" says M. Mérimée, \"they sheltered themselves behind pointed\r\nstakes planted in the ground, and, thus protected against cavalry, let\r\nfly arrows an ell long, which few cuirasses could resist.\" The\r\nequipment of the English cavalry was far superior to that of the\r\nSpanish horsemen. Ayala recapitulates, with astonishment, the various\r\npieces of armour in use amongst those northern warriors. Plates of\r\nsteel and forged iron were worn over jerkins of thick leather, and\r\neven over shirts of mail. The bull-dog courage of the men was not less\r\nremarkable than the strength of their defensive arms. It is\r\ninteresting to read of the exploits of a handful of English soldiers\r\non the very ground where, four hundred and forty-six years later, an\r\narmy of that nation crushed the hosts of France. Sir Thomas Felton,\r\nseneschal of Guyenne, was attacked, when at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the English army, near Ariñiz, two leagues from Vitoria, by more\r\nthan three thousand French gendarmes and Spanish light horse.\r\n\r\n     \"Felton had but two hundred men-at arms, and as many archers.\r\n     He lost not courage, but dismounted his cavalry, and drew\r\n     them up on a steep hillock. His brother, William Felton,\r\n     alone refused to quit his horse. With lance in rest, he\r\n     charged into the midst of the Castilians, and at the first\r\n     blow drove his weapon completely through the body and iron\r\n     armour of a foe; he was immediately cut to pieces. His\r\n     comrades, closing round their banner, defended themselves,\r\n     for several hours, with the courage of despair. At last the\r\n     adventurers, headed by the Marshal d'Audeneham and the Bègue\r\n     de Vilaines, dismounted, and, forming column, broke the\r\n     English phalanx, whilst the Spanish cavalry charged it in\r\n     rear. All were slain in the first fury of victory, but the\r\n     heroic resistance of this scanty band of Englishmen struck\r\n     even their enemies with admiration. The memory of Felton's\r\n     glorious defeat is preserved in the province, where is still\r\n     shown, near Ariñiz, the hillock upon which, after fighting an\r\n     entire day, he fell, covered with wounds. It is called, in\r\n     the language of the country, _Ingles-mendi_, the English\r\n     Hill.\"\r\n\r\nThis gallant but unimportant skirmish comprised (with the exception of\r\na dash made by Don Tello at the English foragers, of whom he killed a\r\ngood number) all the fighting that took place at that time upon the\r\nplain of Vitoria; although some historians have made that plain the\r\nscene of the decisive battle fought soon afterwards, between Edward of\r\nEngland and Don Pedro on the one hand, and du Guesclin and Henry of\r\nTrastamare on the other. Toreno correctly indicates the ground of this\r\naction, which occurred on the right bank of the Ebro, between Najera\r\nand Navarrete. It is true that the Prince of Wales offered battle near\r\nVitoria, drawing up his army on the heights of Santo Romano, close to\r\nthe village of Alegria, just in the line of the flight of the French\r\nwhen beaten in 1813. The Prince did this boldly and confidently,\r\nalthough anxious for the coming up of his rear-guard, which was still\r\nseven leagues off. \"That day,\" says Froissart, \"the prince had many a\r\npang in his heart, because his rear-guard delayed so long to come.\"\r\nBut the enemy were in no haste to attack. Only a day or two\r\npreviously, Don Henry had assembled his captains in council of war,\r\n\"to communicate to them,\" says M. Mérimée, \"a letter the King of\r\nFrance had written him, urging him not to tempt fortune by risking a\r\nbattle against so able a general as the Prince of Wales, and such\r\nformidable soldiers as the veteran bands he commanded. Bertrand du\r\nGuesclin, Marshal d'Audeneham, and most of the French adventurers,\r\nwere of the same opinion--frankly declaring that, in regular battle,\r\nthe English were invincible. Du Guesclin's advice was to harass them\r\nby continual skirmishes,\" &c., &c.; and the result of the council was,\r\nthat Don Henry resolved to keep as much as possible on the defensive,\r\nand in the mountains, where his light troops had a great advantage\r\nover their enemies, who were heavily armed, and unaccustomed to a\r\nguerilla warfare. It had been well for him had he adhered to this\r\nresolution, instead of allowing himself to be carried away by his\r\nardour, and by the confidence with which a successful skirmish had\r\ninspired him. In vain du Guesclin, and the other captains, tried to\r\ndetain him in rear of the little river Najerilla: declaring his\r\nintention of finishing the war by one decisive combat, he led his army\r\ninto the plain. When the Black Prince, who little expected such\r\ntemerity, was informed of the movement--\"By St George!\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"in yonder bastard there lives a valiant knight!\" Then he proceeded to\r\ntake up his position for the fight that now was certain to take place.\r\n\"At sunrise, Count Henry beheld the English army drawn up in line, in\r\nadmirable order; their gay banners and pennons floating above a forest\r\nof lances. Already all the men-at-arms had dismounted.[31]... The\r\nPrince of Wales devoutly offered up a prayer, and, having called\r\nheaven to witness the justice of his cause, held out his hand to Don\r\nPedro: 'Sir King,' he said, 'in an hour you will know if you are King\r\nof Castile.' Then he cried out, 'Banners forward, in the name of God\r\nand St George!\"\r\n\r\nWe will not diminish, by extract or abridgment, the pleasure of those\r\nof our readers who may peruse M. Mérimée's masterly and picturesque\r\naccount of the battle, whose triumphant termination was tarnished by\r\nan act of ferocious cruelty on the part of the Castilian king. Don\r\nPedro had proved himself, as usual, a gallant soldier in the fight;\r\nand long after the English trumpets had sounded the recall, he spurred\r\nhis black charger on the track of the fugitive foe. At last, exhausted\r\nby fatigue, he was returning to the camp, when he met a Gascon knight\r\nbringing back as prisoner Iñigo Lopez Orozco, once an intimate of the\r\nking's, but who had abandoned him after his flight from Burgos. In\r\nspite of the efforts of the Gascon to protect him, Pedro slew his\r\nrenegade adherent in cold blood, and with his own hand. The English\r\nwere indignant at this barbarous revenge, and sharp words were\r\nexchanged between Pedro and the Black Prince. Indeed, it was hardly\r\npossible that sympathy should exist between the generous and\r\nchivalrous Edward and his blood-thirsty and crafty ally, and this\r\ndispute was the first symptom of the mutual aversion they afterwards\r\nexhibited. From the very commencement, the Prince of Wales appears to\r\nhave espoused the cause of legitimacy in opposition to his personal\r\npredilections. His admiration of Count Henry, and good opinion of his\r\nabilities, frequently breaks out. After the signal victory of Najera,\r\nwhich seemed to have fixed the crown of Castile more firmly than ever\r\nupon Pedro's brow, Edward was the only man who judged differently of\r\nthe future. \"The day after the battle, when the knights charged by him\r\nto examine the dead and the prisoners came to make their report, he\r\nasked in the Gascon dialect, which he habitually spoke: '_E lo bort,\r\nes mort ó pres?_ And the Bastard, is he killed or taken?' The answer\r\nwas, that he had disappeared from the field of battle, and that all\r\ntrace of him was lost. '_Non ay res faït!_' exclaimed the prince;\r\n'Nothing is done.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Black Prince spoke in a prophetic spirit: the sequel proved the\r\nwisdom of his words. The battle of Najera was fought on the 3d April\r\n1367. Two years later, less eleven days, on the 23d March 1369--Edward\r\nand his gallant followers having in the interim returned to Guyenne,\r\ndisgusted with the ingratitude and bad faith of the king they had\r\nreplaced upon his throne--the Bastard was master of Spain, where Don\r\nPedro's sole remaining possession was the castle of Montiel, within\r\nwhose walls the fallen monarch was closely blockaded. Negotiations\r\nensued, in which Bertrand du Guesclin shared, and in which there can\r\nbe little doubt he played a treacherous part. It is to the credit of\r\nM. Mérimée's impartiality, that he does not seek to shield the French\r\nhero, but merely urges, in extenuation of his conduct, the perverted\r\nmorality and strange code of knightly honour accepted in those days.\r\nBy whomsoever lured, in the night-time Pedro left his stronghold,\r\nexpecting to meet, outside its walls, abettors and companions of a\r\nmeditated flight. Instead of such aid, he found himself a captive, and\r\npresently he stood face to face with Henry of Trastamare. The brothers\r\nbandied insults, a blow was dealt, and they closed in mortal strife.\r\nAround them a circle of chevaliers gazed with deep interest at this\r\ncombat of kings. Pedro, the taller and stronger man, at first had the\r\nadvantage. Then a bystander--some say du Guesclin, others, an\r\nArragonese, Rocaberti--pulled the king by the leg as he held his\r\nbrother under him, and changed the fortune of the duel. What ensued is\r\nbest told in the words of Lockhart's close and admirable version of a\r\npopular Spanish ballad:--\r\n\r\n    \"Now Don Henry has the upmost,\r\n    Now King Pedro lies beneath;\r\n    In his heart his brother's poniard\r\n    Instant finds its bloody sheath.\r\n\r\n    Thus with mortal gasp and quiver,\r\n    While the blood in bubbles well'd,\r\n    Fled the fiercest soul that ever\r\n    In a Christian bosom dwell'd.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] _Histoire de Don Pédre I^{er}, Roi de Castille._ Par PROSPER\r\nMÉRIMÉE, de l'Académie Française. Pp. 586. Paris, 1848.\r\n\r\n[21] _Blackwood's Magazine_, No. CCCLXXX.\r\n\r\n[22] The _ricos hombres_, literally rich men, did not yet bear titles,\r\nwhich were reserved for members of the royal family. Thus, Henry de\r\nTrastamare was commonly designated as \"the Count,\" he being the only\r\none in Castile. When crowned at Burgos, in 1366, he lavished the titles\r\nof count and marquis, previously so charily bestowed, not only upon the\r\nmagnates of the land, but upon Bertrand Duguesclin, Sir Hugh Calverley,\r\nDenia the Arragonese, and other foreign adventurers and allies. \"Such\r\nwas the generosity, or rather the profusion of the new king, that it\r\ngave rise to a proverbial expression long current in Spain: _Henry's\r\nfavours_ (_Mercedes Enriquenas_) was thenceforward the term applied to\r\nrecompenses obtained before they were deserved.\"--MÉRIMÉE, p. 451-2. A\r\n_rico hombre_ was created by receiving at the king's hand a banner and\r\na cauldron (_Pendon y Caldera_)--the one to guide his soldiers, the\r\nother to feed them. The fidalgos or hidalgos (from _hijodalgo_, the son\r\nof somebody) were dependants of the _ricos hombres_, as these were of\r\nthe king. \"Every nobleman had a certain number of gentlemen who did him\r\nhomage, and held their lands in fee of him. In their turn, these\r\ngentlemen had vassals, so that the labourer had many masters, whose\r\norders were often contradictory. These mediæval institutions gave rise\r\nto strange complications, only to be unravelled by violence.\r\nNevertheless, the laws and national usages directed the vassal,\r\nwhatever his condition, to obey his immediate superior. Thus, a mere\r\nknight did not incur penalty of treason by taking arms against the king\r\nby order of the rich-man to whom he paid homage.\"--MÉRIMÉE, p. 29. Some\r\ncurious illustrations are subjoined. In 1334, Alphonso took the field\r\nagainst an insubordinate vassal, and besieged him in his town of Lerma.\r\nGarcia de Padilla, a knight attached to the rebel, seeing an amicable\r\narrangement impossible, boldly demanded of Don Alphonso a horse and\r\narmour, to go and fight under the banner of his liege lord. The king\r\ninstantly complied with his request, warning him, however, that if\r\ntaken, he should pay with his head for his fidelity to the lord of\r\nLerma. \"I distinguish,\" says M. MÉRIMÉE, \"in the action and words of\r\nDon Alphonso, the contrast of the knight and the king united in the\r\nsame man. The one yields to his prejudices of chivalrous honour, the\r\nother will have the rights of his crown respected. The customs of the\r\nage and the dictates of policy contend in the generous monarch's\r\nbreast.\"--P. 30.\r\n\r\n[23] \"It were a great error to attribute to Spain, in the 14th\r\ncentury, the religious passions and intolerant spirit that animated it\r\nin the 16th. In the wars between Moors and Christians, politics had\r\nlong had a far larger share than fanaticism....  Although the\r\nInquisition had been established more than a century, its power was\r\nfar from being what it afterwards became. As to Jews and Moors, they\r\nwere subject to the jurisdiction of the Holy Office only when they\r\nsought, by word or writing, to turn Christians from the faith of their\r\nfathers; and even then, royal authorisation was necessary before they\r\ncould be prosecuted. And the kings showed themselves, in general,\r\nlittle disposed to let the clergy increase their influence. In 1350,\r\nPeter IV. of Arragon rigorously forbade ecclesiastics to infringe on\r\nsecular jurisdiction.... There was much lukewarmness in matters of\r\nreligion; and to this, perhaps, is to be attributed the very secondary\r\npart played by the clergy in all the political debates of the 14th\r\ncentury. The inferior clergy, living and recruiting its ranks amongst\r\nthe people, shared the ignorance and rudeness of the latter. Such was\r\nthe prevalent immorality, that a great number of priests maintained\r\nconcubines, who were vain of the holy profession of their lovers, and\r\nclaimed particular distinctions. The conduct of these ecclesiastics\r\noccasioned no scandal, but the luxury affected by their mistresses\r\noften excited the envy of rich citizens, and even of noble ladies.\r\nRepeatedly, and always in vain, the Cortes launched decrees intended\r\nto repress the insolence of the _damoiselles de prétres_, (_barraganas\r\nde clérigos_,) who formed a distinct class or caste, enjoying special\r\nprivileges, and sufficiently numerous to require the invention of laws\r\nfor them alone.\"--MÉRIMÉE, p. 34 to 38. These passages tend to explain\r\nwhat might otherwise seem incomprehensible--the passive submission of\r\nthe Spanish priesthood to encroachments upon their temporal goods.\r\nSince then they have rarely shown themselves so enduring; and the mere\r\nhint of an attack upon their power or opulence has usually been the\r\nsignal for mischievous intrigue, and often for bloody strife. It is a\r\nquestion, (setting aside the _barraganas_, although these, up to no\r\nremote date, may be said to have been rather _veiled_ than\r\nsuppressed,) whether the Spanish priests of the 14th century were not\r\nnearly as enlightened as their successors of the 19th. They certainly\r\nwere far more tolerant. \"Arab language and literature,\" M. Mérimée\r\ntells us, \"were cultivated in schools founded under ecclesiastical\r\npatronage.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Cortes held at Valladolid, in 1351, we find Don Pedro rejecting\r\nthe petitions of the clergy, who craved restitution of the revenues\r\nappropriated by the crown, to their prejudice, under his father's\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n[24] In various details of Don Pedro's life and character we trace\r\nresemblance to the eastern despot, although there seems no foundation\r\nfor the charges of infidelity brought against him towards the close of\r\nhis reign, and which may partly have originated, perhaps, in his close\r\nalliance with the Granadine Moors, a body of whose light cavalry for\r\nsome time formed his escort. Contiguity of territory, commercial\r\nintercourse, and political necessities, had assimilated to a certain\r\nextent the manners and usages of Spaniards and Saracens, and given the\r\nformer an oriental tinge, of which, even at the present day, faint\r\nvestiges are here and there perceptible. Don Pedro's orientalism was\r\nparticularly perceptible in the mode of many of the executions that\r\nensanguined his reign. He had constantly about him a band of\r\ncross-bowmen who waited on his nod, and recoiled from no cruelty.\r\nOccasionally we find him sending one of them to some distant place to\r\ncommunicate and execute the doom of an offending subject. This recalls\r\nthe Turkish mute and bowstring. These death-dealing archers seem to\r\nhave employed mace and dagger more frequently than axe or cord. They\r\nwere assassins rather than executioners. They officiated in the case\r\nof Garci Laso. \"Alburquerque, impatient of delay, warned the king that\r\nit was time to give final orders. Don Pedro, accustomed to repeat\r\nthose of his minister, bade two of Alburquerque's gentlemen go tell\r\nthe prisoner's guards to despatch him. The arbalisters, blind\r\ninstruments of the king's will, mistrusted an order transmitted to\r\nthem by Alburquerque's people, and desired to receive it from their\r\nmaster's mouth. One of them went to ask him what was to be done with\r\nGarci Laso. 'Let him be killed!' replied the king. This time duly\r\nauthorised, the arbalister ran to the prisoner, and struck him down\r\nwith a blow of a mace upon his head. His comrades finished him with\r\ntheir daggers. The body of Garci Laso was thrown upon the public\r\nsquare, where the king's entrance was celebrated, according to\r\nCastilian custom, by a bull-fight. The bulls trampled the corpse, and\r\ntossed it upon their horns. It was taken from them for exhibition upon\r\na scaffold, where it remained a whole day. At last it was placed upon\r\na bier, which was fixed upon the rampart of Camparanda. It was the\r\ntreatment reserved for the bodies of great malefactors.\"--MÉRIMÉE, p.\r\n73.\r\n\r\n[25] \"In 1339, Don Gonzalo Martinez, Master of Alcantara, having\r\nrebelled against the king Don Alphonso, was besieged and taken in his\r\ncastle of Valencia, and Coronel presided at his execution.\"--_Chronica\r\nde Don Alphonso XI._, p. 385.\r\n\r\n[26] The Castilian tongue is rich in words descriptive of grace in\r\nwomen. Spain is, certainly, the country where that quality is most\r\ncommon. I will cite only a few of those expressions, indicative of\r\nshades easier to appreciate than to translate. _Garbo_ is grace\r\ncombined with nobility; _donayre_, elegance of bearing, vivacity of\r\nwit; _salero_, voluptuous and provocative grace; _zandunga_, the kind\r\nof grace peculiar to the Andalusians--a happy mixture of readiness and\r\nnonchalance. People applaud the _garbo_ or _donayre_ of a duchess, the\r\n_salero_ of an actress, the _zandunga_ of a gipsy of Jerez.--MÉRIMÉE,\r\np. 110.\r\n\r\n[27] The enchantment of Don Pedro by Maria Padilla is a popular\r\ntradition in Andalusia, where the memory of both is vividly preserved.\r\nIt is further added, that Maria Padilla was a queen of the\r\ngipsies--their _bari crallisa_--consequently consummate mistress of\r\nthe art of concocting philters. Unfortunately, the gipsies were\r\nscarcely seen in Europe till a century later. The author of the\r\n_Première Vie du Pape Innocent VI._ gravely relates that Blanche,\r\nhaving made her husband a present of a golden girdle, Maria Padilla,\r\nassisted by a Jew, a notorious sorcerer, changed it into a serpent,\r\none day that the king had it on. The surprise of the king and his\r\ncourt may be imagined, when the girdle began to writhe and hiss;\r\nwhereupon the Padilla easily succeeded in persuading her lover that\r\nBlanche was a magician bent upon destroying him by her arts.--MÉRIMÉE,\r\np. 120.\r\n\r\n[28] ZUÑIGA, _Anales de Sevilla_.--\"The people say, that Maria\r\nCoronel, pursued by Don Pedro, in the suburb of Triana, plunged her\r\nhead into a pan in which a gipsy was cooking fritters. I was shown the\r\nhouse in front of which the incident occurred, and I was desired to\r\nremark, as an incontrovertible proof, that it is still inhabited by\r\ngipsies, whose kitchen is in the open street.\"--MÉRIMÉE, p. 247.\r\n\r\n[29] We have already adverted to the religious tolerance of the time,\r\nand to the intermixture of Mussulmans and Christians: M. Mérimée gives\r\nsome curious details on this subject. The nobility of Castile made no\r\ndifficulty to grant the _Don_ to the Moorish cavaliers, and the rich\r\nJew bankers obtained the same distinction, then very rare amongst the\r\nChristians themselves. Thus Ayala, the chronicler, speaks of Don\r\nFarax, Don Simuel, Don Reduan, &c.; although of Spaniards he gives the\r\nDon only to the princes of the blood, to a few very powerful _ricos\r\nhombres_, to certain great officers of the crown, and to the masters\r\nof the military orders of knights. The Andalusian Moors were\r\nfrequently treated as equals by the chevaliers of Castile; but this is\r\nfar less astonishing than that the Jews should have attained to high\r\nhonours and office. Pedro, however, seems always to have had a leaning\r\ntowards them, and the Israelites, on their part, invariably supported\r\nhim. He was more than once, in the latter part of his reign, heard to\r\nsay that the Moors and Hebrews were his only loyal subjects. At\r\nMiranda, on the Ebro, in 1360, the populace, stirred up by Henry of\r\nTrastamare, massacred the Jews, and pillaged their dwellings. The\r\nobject of the Count was to compromise the townspeople, and thus to\r\nattach them indissolubly to his cause. When Pedro arrived, he had the\r\nringleaders of the riot arrested; and, in his presence, the unhappy\r\nwretches were burned alive, or boiled in immense cauldrons. Obsolete\r\nlaws were revived, to justify these terrible executions; but the crime\r\nof the offenders was forgotten in the horror excited by such barbarous\r\npunishments. It was just after these scenes of cruelty that a priest,\r\ncoming from Santo-Domingo de la Calzada, craved private audience of\r\nthe king, 'Sire,' said he, 'my Lord Saint Dominick has appeared to me\r\nin a dream, bidding me warn you that, if you do not amend your life,\r\nDon Henry, your brother, will slay you with his own hand.' This\r\nprophecy, on the eve of a battle between the brothers, was probably\r\nthe result of fanatical hatred, on the part of the priests towards a\r\nking now generally accused of irreligion. Whatever dictated it, Pedro\r\nwas at first startled by the prophet's confident and inspired air, but\r\nsoon he thought it was a stratagem of his enemies to discourage him\r\nand his troops. The priest, who persisted that his mission was from St\r\nDominick, was burned alive in front of the army.--MÉRIMÉE, pp. 35,\r\n290, 299, &c.\r\n\r\n[30] \"According to the interpolator of the chronicle of the\r\n_Despensero Mayor_, Simuel Levi, whose death he erroneously fixes in\r\nthe year 1366, was denounced to the king by several Jews, envious of\r\nhis immense riches. Simuel, on being put to the torture, died of\r\nindignation, '_de puro corage_,' says the anonymous author, whom I\r\ncopy, since I cannot understand him. There were found, in a vault\r\nbeneath his house, three piles of gold and silver lingots, so lofty\r\n'that a man standing behind them was not seen.' The king, on beholding\r\nthis treasure, exclaimed--'If Don Simuel had given me the third part\r\nof the smallest of these heaps, I would not have had him tortured. How\r\ncould he consent to die rather than speak?' _Sumario de los Reyes de\r\nEspaña_, p. 73. Credat Judæus Apella.\"--MÉRIMÉE, p. 317.\r\n\r\nDon Pedro was often accused of avarice, although it appears probable\r\nthat his fondness of money sprang from his experience of the power it\r\ngave, and of its absolute necessity in the wars in which he was\r\ncontinually engaged, rather than from any abstract love of gold. When,\r\nafter his flight from Spain in 1366, his treasures were traitorously\r\ngiven up to his rival by Admiral Boccanegra, who had been charged to\r\nconvey them to Portugal, they amounted to thirty-six quintals of gold,\r\n(something like fourteen hundred thousand pounds sterling--a monstrous\r\nsum in those days,) besides a quantity of jewels.\r\n\r\n[31] The custom of the time, according to Froissart and others. On the\r\nmarch, most of the soldiers, sometimes even the archers, were on\r\nhorseback; but when the hour of battle arrived, spurs were removed,\r\nhorses sent away, and lances shortened. When the time came for flight\r\nand pursuit, the combatants again sprang into their saddles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPENING OF THE SESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British Parliament has again been summoned to resume its labours.\r\nThe period which intervened between the close of the last, and the\r\nopening of the present session, was fraught with great anxiety to\r\nthose who believed that the cause of order and peace depended upon the\r\ncheck that might be given to the democratic spirit, then raging so\r\nfearfully throughout Europe. France, under the dictatorship of\r\nCavaignac, had emerged a little from the chaotic slough into which she\r\nhad been plunged by the wickedness, imbecility, and treason of a junta\r\nof self-constituted ministers--men who held their commissions from the\r\nsovereign mob of Paris, and who were ready, for that sovereign's sake,\r\nto ruin and prostrate their country. Foremost among these ministers\r\nwas Lamartine, a theorist whose intentions might be good, but whose\r\nexorbitant vanity made him a tool in the hands of others who had\r\nembraced revolution as a trade. Of this stamp were Ledru-Rollin, Louis\r\nBlanc, and, we may add, Marrast,--men who had nothing to lose, but\r\neverything to gain, from the continuance of popular disorder.\r\nFortunately, the daring attempt of June--which, if it had succeeded,\r\nwould have surrendered Paris to be sacked--was suppressed with\r\nsufficient bloodshed. Military domination took the place of helpless\r\ndemocratic fraternity; the barricades went down amidst the thunder of\r\nthe cannon, and the rascaldom of the Faubourg St Antoine found, to\r\ntheir cost, that they were not yet altogether triumphant. Of the\r\nsubsequent election of Louis Napoleon to the presidentship we need not\r\nspeak. It would be in vain, under present circumstances, to speculate\r\nupon the probable destinies of France. All that we have to remark now\r\nis her attitude, which, we think, is symptomatic of improvement. The\r\nsocialist theories are wellnigh exploded. Equality may exist in name,\r\nbut it is not recognised as a reality. The provinces have suffered\r\nenough from revolution to abhor the thought of anarchy; and they long\r\nfor any government strong and resolute enough to enforce the laws, and\r\nto stamp with its heel on the head of the Jacobin hydra.\r\n\r\nAustria, on the other side, has done her duty nobly. Astounded as we\r\ncertainly were at the outbreak of revolution in Vienna, we had yet\r\nthat confidence, in the spirit and loyalty of the old Teutonic\r\nchivalry, that we never for a moment believed that the mighty fabric\r\nof ages would be allowed to crumble down, or the imperial crown to\r\nfall from the head of the descendant of the Cæsars. And so it has\r\nproved. The revolt occasioned in the southern provinces by the\r\nco-operation of Jacobinism, under the specious mask of nationality,\r\nwith the mean and selfish ambition of an intriguing Italian potentate,\r\nhas been triumphantly suppressed. Vienna, after experiencing the\r\nhorrors of ruffian occupation--after having seen assassination rife in\r\nher streets, and the homes of her burghers delivered over to the lust\r\nand pillage of the anarchists--has again returned to her fealty. The\r\ninsurrections in Bohemia and Hungary have been met by the strong arm\r\nof power; the schemes of treason and of faction have been discomfited;\r\nnor can modern history afford us nobler examples of heroism and\r\ndevotion than have been exhibited by Windischgrätz and Jellachich.\r\nWhilst the democratic press, even in this country, was sympathising\r\nwith the insurgents--whilst treason, murder, and rapine were palliated\r\nand excused, and fulsome and bombastic panegyrics pronounced upon the\r\nleading demagogues of the movement--we have watched the efforts of\r\nAustria towards the recovery of her equilibrium, with an anxiety which\r\nwe scarcely can express; because we felt convinced that, upon her\r\nsuccess or her defeat, upon the maintenance of her position as a\r\ncolossal united power, or her division into petty states, depended, in\r\na large measure, the future tranquillity of Europe. Most happily she\r\nhas succeeded, and has thereby given the death-blow to the hopes of\r\nthe besotted visionaries at Frankfort. The Central Power of Germany,\r\nas that singular assemblage of mountebanks, with a weak old imbecile\r\nat their head, has been somewhat facetiously denominated--that\r\npseudo-parliament, which, without power to enforce its decrees, or any\r\ncomprehensible scheme of action, has arrogated to itself the right of\r\nover-riding monarchies--is gradually dwindling into contempt. Even\r\nFrederick-William of Prussia, its chief supporter and stay, has found\r\nout his vast mistake in yielding to the democratic principle as the\r\nmeans of ultimately securing for himself the rule of a united Germany.\r\nThe attempt has already wellnigh cost him the crown which he wears. He\r\nnow sees, as he might have seen earlier, but for the mists of interest\r\nand ambition, that the present movement was essentially a democratic\r\none, and that its leaders merely held out the phantom of resuscitated\r\nimperialism in order to make converts, and to strike more effectually\r\nat every hereditary constitution. The farce cannot, in the ordinary\r\nnature of things, last much longer. Without Austria, Bavaria, and\r\nPrussia, there is no central power at all. The Frankfort parliament,\r\nas it at present exists, can be compared to nothing except a great\r\nMasonic assemblage. In humble imitation of the brethren of the mystic\r\ntie, it is solemnly creating grand chancellors, grand seneschals, and,\r\nfor aught we know, grand tylers also for an empire which is not in\r\nexistence; and, without a farthing in its treasury, is decreeing civil\r\nlists and bounties to its imperial grand master! Unfortunately, the\r\nstate of Europe has been such that we cannot afford to laugh even at\r\nsuch palpable fooleries. They tend to prolong excitement and disorder\r\nthroughout a considerable portion of the Continent; and already,\r\nthrough such antics, we have been on the eve of a general war,\r\noccasioned by the unjust attempts to deprive Denmark of her Schleswig\r\nprovinces. The sooner, therefore, that the parliament of Frankfort\r\nceases to have an existence the better. It hardly can exist if the\r\nlarger states do their duty, without jealousy of each other, but with\r\nreference to the common weal.\r\n\r\nBut though the democratic progress, under whatsoever form it appeared,\r\nhas thus received a check in northern Europe, it is still raging with\r\nundiminished violence in the south. British diplomatic relations with\r\nthe See of Rome have received the _coup-de-grace_, in the forcible\r\nexpulsion of the Sovereign Pontiff from his territories! The leading\r\nreformer of the age--the propagandist successor of St Peter--has\r\nsurrendered his pastoral charge, and fled from the howling of his\r\nflock, now suddenly metamorphosed into wolves. There, as elsewhere,\r\nliberalism has signalised itself by assassination. The star of\r\nfreedom, of which Lord Minto was the delegated prophet, has appeared\r\nin the form of a bloody and terrific meteor. Even revolutionised\r\nFrance felt her bowels moved by some latent Christian compunction, and\r\nprepared an armament to rescue, if needful, the unfortunate patriarch\r\nfrom his children. More recently, the Grand-duke of Tuscany--a prince\r\nwhose mild rule and kindly government were such that democracy itself\r\ncould frame no articulate charge against him, beyond the fact of his\r\nbeing a sovereign--has been compelled to abandon his territory, and to\r\ntake refuge elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of the continent of Europe at the opening of the new\r\nsession of Parliament--a state which, while it undeniably leaves great\r\nroom for hope, and in some measure indicates a return to more settled\r\nprinciples of government, is very far from conveying an assurance of\r\nlasting tranquillity. It is now just a year since the sagacious Mr\r\nCobden issued the second part of his prophecies to atone for the\r\nfailure of the first. The repeal of the corn laws, and the other\r\nfree-trade measures, having not only failed to enrich this country at\r\nthe ratio of a hundred millions sterling annually--the premium which\r\nwas confidently offered by the Manchester Association, as the price of\r\ntheir experiment--but, having somehow or other been followed by a\r\ncalamitous deficit in the ordinary revenue, the member for the West\r\nRiding bethought himself of a new agitation for the disbandment of the\r\nBritish army, and the suppression of the navy, founded upon the\r\nexperiences which he had gathered in the course of his Continental\r\novations. He told his faithful myrmidons that all Europe was in a\r\nstate of profound peace, and that war was utterly impossible. They\r\nechoed the cry, and at once, as if by magic, the torch of revolution\r\nwas lighted up in every country save our own. Nor are we entitled to\r\nclaim absolute exemption. Chartism exhibited itself at home in a more\r\ndaring manner than ever before: nor do we wonder at this, since the\r\ndepreciation of labour in the home market, the direct result of Peel's\r\ninjudicious tariffs, drove many a man, from sheer desperation, into\r\nthe ranks of the disloyal. Ireland was pacified only by a strong\r\ndemonstration of military force; and, had that been withdrawn,\r\nrebellion was the inevitable consequence. Still, though his promises\r\nare thus shown to be utterly false, the undaunted Free-trader, in the\r\nteeth of facts and logic, persists in maintaining his conclusions.\r\nAgain he shouts, raves, and agitates for an extensive military\r\nreduction; and, lo! the next Indian mail brings tidings of the war in\r\nthe Punjaub!\r\n\r\nPublic attention, during the recess, has been very generally directed\r\nto the state of the finances of the country. No wonder. Last year, in\r\nproposing the first of his abortive budgets, Lord John Russell\r\ndistinctly calculated the probable excess of the expenditure over the\r\nincome at the sum of three millions and a quarter; to balance which he\r\nasked for an augmentation of the income tax--a proposal which the\r\nnation very properly scouted. But, whilst we state now, as we stated\r\nthen, our determined opposition to the increase of the direct taxation\r\nof the country, we must remark that the free-trade party were hardly\r\njustified in withholding their support from a minister who had played\r\ntheir game with such unimpeachable docility, in an emergency directly\r\nresulting from the operation of their cherished system. The statement\r\nof Sir Charles Wood, to the effect that, during the last six years,\r\nthe nation had remitted seven and a half millions of annual taxation,\r\nought surely to have had the effect of an argument upon these\r\nimpenetrable men. Seven millions and a half had been sacrificed before\r\nthe Moloch of free trade. Good, benevolent, plain-dealing Sir Robert,\r\nand profound, calculating Lord John, had each, in preparing their\r\nannual estimates, lopped off some productive branch of the customs,\r\nand smilingly displayed it to the country, as a proof of their desire\r\nto lessen the weight of the national burdens. That our revenue should\r\nfall was, of course, a necessary consequence. Fall it did, and that\r\nwith such rapidity that Sir Robert Peel dared not take off the income\r\ntax, which he had imposed upon the country with a distinct and solemn\r\npledge that it was merely to be temporary in its duration, but handed\r\nit over as a permanent legacy to his successor, who coolly proposed to\r\naugment it! Now it really required no reflection at all to see that,\r\nif our statesmen chose, for the sake of popularity or otherwise, thus\r\nto tamper with the revenue, and to lessen the amount of the customs, a\r\ndeficit must, sooner or later, occur. Not the least baneful effect of\r\nthe policy pursued by Sir Robert Peel has been the system of\r\ncalculating the estimates so low, and adapting the income so closely\r\nto the national expenditure, that a surplus, to be handed over to the\r\ncommissioners for the reduction of the national debt, is now a\r\ntradition. We have abandoned the idea of a surplus, nor can it ever\r\nagain be realised under the operation of the present system. Instead\r\nof a surplus we have a permanent income tax, and, more than that, a\r\nfresh debt incurred by us, under Whig management, of no less than ten\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nSuch being the state of our finances, the question naturally suggests\r\nitself to the mind of every thinking man, how are we to find a remedy?\r\nThe Financial Reform Associations--which are nothing else than the\r\nbastard spawn of the Anti-Corn-law League--are perfectly ready with\r\ntheir answer. They see no difficulty about it at all. \"Act,\" they say,\r\n\"upon the same principle which every man adopts in private life. Since\r\nyour income has fallen off, reduce your expenditure. Cut your coat\r\naccording to your cloth. Find out what are the most expensive items of\r\nyour estimates, and demolish these. If you can't afford to have an\r\narmy, don't keep one. Your navy is anything but a source of income;\r\nput it down. In this way you will presently find that you can make\r\nout a satisfactory balance-sheet.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the pounds, shillings, and pence view of the case, and its\r\nsupporters are determined to enforce it. Dull statistical pamphlets,\r\ninveighing against the enormous expense of our establishments, are\r\ncompiled by pompous pseudo-economists, and circulated by the million.\r\nLooking to the past, it requires no familiarity to predict, that, as\r\nsure as winter follows autumn, so certainly will the Whigs yield to\r\nthe pressure from without. Nay, it is not a prediction; for already,\r\nin the Queen's speech, an intimation to that effect has been given.\r\nNow this is a matter of vital moment to every one of us. We are now\r\nverging towards the point which we have long foreseen, when the\r\neffects of unprincipled legislation will be wrested into an argument\r\nagainst the maintenance of the national greatness. We have a battle to\r\nfight involving a more important stake than ever. We must fight that\r\nbattle under circumstances of great disadvantage; for not only has\r\ntreachery thinned our ranks, but the abandonment of public principle\r\nby a statesman whose hairs have grown gray in office, has given an\r\nexample of laxity most pernicious to the morals of the age. But not\r\nthe less readily do we go forward at the call of honour and duty,\r\nknowing that our cause is truth, and confident, even now, that truth\r\nmust ultimately prevail.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let us set ourselves right with these same\r\nFinancial Reform Associations, so that no charge may be brought\r\nagainst us of factious opposition to salutary improvement. We have\r\nperused several of their tracts with great care; but, being tolerably\r\nfamiliar with their statistics already, we have not acquired any large\r\nstock of additional information. They point, however, to many things\r\nwhich are most undoubted abuses. That a reform is necessary in many\r\ncivil departments of the state, has long been our expressed opinion.\r\nMoney is not only misapplied, but the revenues which ought to be drawn\r\nfrom some portions of the public property, find their way into private\r\npockets, and are not accounted for. We do not doubt that the dockyards\r\nare largely jobbed, and that the nation suffers considerable loss by a\r\npartial and nefarious system of private instead of public contracts.\r\nWe are no admirers of sinecures, of unnecessary commissionerships, or\r\nthe multiplication of useless offices. The department of Woods and\r\nForests is an Augean stable, which requires a thorough cleansing. It\r\nis notoriously the most inefficient and the worst served of the public\r\nboards, and it has permitted and winked at peculation to an extent\r\nwhich is almost incredible. We desire to have the public accounts\r\nbetter kept, and some security given that the officials will do their\r\nduty. We wish to see patronage fairly and honourably exercised. We\r\nwish to see abuse corrected, curbed, and abolished.\r\n\r\nAnd why is this not done? Simply for this reason--that we are cursed\r\nwith a government in every way unfit for their charge. The present\r\nruling family party have not among them a vestige of a public virtue.\r\nJobbing with the Whigs is not an exceptional case--it is a living\r\nprinciple. It is more to them than the liberty of the press: it is\r\nlike the air they breathe; if they have it not, they die. They keep\r\ntheir adherents together solely by the force of jobbing. Look at their\r\nIrish Trevellyan jobs, their commissions, their unblushing and\r\nunparalleled favouritism! Never, in any one instance, have they\r\nattempted to save a shilling of the public revenue, when, by doing so,\r\nthey would interfere with the perquisites of some veteran servitor of\r\ntheir order. We know this pretty well in Scotland, where jobbing\r\nflourishes all the better because we are denied the superintendence of\r\na separate Secretary of State--an office which is imperatively called\r\nfor. The present is undeniably a time for the exertion of strict\r\neconomy in every department, and yet ministers will not vouchsafe to\r\ncommence it in their own. During the last two years, various offices\r\nwhich are not hereditary, which are notorious sinecures, and which are\r\nnevertheless endowed with large salaries, have become vacant; and, in\r\nevery case, these have been filled up by Lord John Russell, on the\r\nbroad ground that the government could not afford to dispense with\r\nsuch valuable patronage.\r\n\r\nSo far we are at one with the finance reformers. So long as their\r\nobject is to reform evident abuses, we are ready not only to applaud,\r\nbut to co-operate with them: but the correction of abuses is a very\r\ndifferent thing from that suicidal policy which has been over and over\r\nagain attempted in this country--that policy which, by saving\r\nthousands, insures the loss of millions.\r\n\r\nBecause our revenue has fallen off, is that any reason why we should\r\npart with our army and navy? Let us assume that the army and navy are\r\nnecessary for three purposes--first, for the defence of the country;\r\nsecondly, for the maintenance of internal order; and thirdly, for the\r\nretention of our colonies. Let us further assume, that, keeping these\r\nthree necessary points in view, it is impossible to effect a numerical\r\nreduction of the force: and we then ask the economists whether, these\r\npremises being allowed, they would push their doctrine of cloth-cutting\r\nso far as still to insist upon a reduction? Not one political tailor of\r\nthem all will dare to say so! They know the overwhelming storm of\r\ncontempt that would arise in every corner of Great Britain, if they\r\ndared to give vent to such a traitorous sentiment; they leave it\r\nunuttered, but they aver the non-necessity.[32] Here we meet at once\r\nupon fair and open ground; and we ask, whether they mean to aver that\r\nthe present force is greater than is required for the three purposes\r\nabove mentioned, or whether they mean to aver that any one of these\r\npurposes is unnecessary? This, as we shall presently have occasion to\r\nsee, is a very important distinction.\r\n\r\nTo the first question, as yet, we have only indefinite answers. We\r\nhear a good deal about clothing allowances and abuses, with which we\r\nhave nothing whatever to do. It may be, that there exist some faults\r\nin the army and navy department, and that these could be amended with\r\na saving of expense to the country: if so, let it be done. We\r\ncordially echo the language of Lord Stanley, on moving his amendment\r\nto the address: \"I believe it is possible to effect some reductions in\r\nthe civil departments of the army, ordnance, and navy. I also think\r\nthat large reductions may be made by checking the abuses which exist\r\nin the administration and management of the dockyards. But the\r\ngreatest security we could obtain for having the work well done in the\r\ndockyards, would be the passing of an enactment to deprive all persons\r\nin those yards from voting for members of parliament. I have heard at\r\nleast twenty naval officers express an opinion that, until persons\r\nemployed in the dockyards shall be prevented from voting for members\r\nof parliament, it will be impossible to exercise efficient control\r\nover the work performed in those establishments. If reductions can be\r\neffected, in God's name let them be made; and, although one may wonder\r\nhow such a course has been so long delayed, I will applaud the\r\ngovernment which shall economise without prejudice to the permanent\r\ninterests of the empire. But when the country is in a position which\r\nrequires that she should have all her resources and powers at hand, I\r\ncannot concur with those who, for the sake of economy, would largely\r\ndiminish the naval and military forces of the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr Cobden, so far as we can gather from his orations, advocates the\r\npropriety of disbanding the army on the score of peace. He thinks\r\nthat, if we were to dismiss our forces, all the other nations of the\r\nearth would follow the example. There is something positively\r\nmarvellous in the calm audacity of the man who can rise up, as Cobden\r\ndid at Manchester, on the last day of January, and enunciate to his\r\nenraptured audience, that, \"notwithstanding all that had been said on\r\nthat subject, he reiterated there never was a time when Europe was so\r\npredisposed to listen to advances made by the people of England, on\r\nthat subject, as now!\" Where, in the name of the Seven Sleepers of\r\nEphesus, has the man been during the last twelvemonths? What does Mr\r\nCobden understand by Europe? We should like to know this, for it is\r\nvery easy to use a general term, as in the present instance, without\r\nconveying any definite meaning. Does he refer to the governments or\r\nthe mobs of Europe--to the well-affected, who wish for order, or to\r\nthe Jacobins whose cause he adores? If he meant the latter class to\r\nsignify Europe, we can understand him readily enough. He is right:\r\ngreat indeed would be the joy of the clubs in Paris, Berlin, and\r\nVienna, if there were not a soldier left. What jubilee and triumph\r\nthere would be in every Continental capital! Not the suppression of\r\nthe police would excite deeper exultation in the hearts of the\r\ndenizens of St Giles', than would the abolition of standing armies in\r\nthose of the bearded patriots of the Continent. No need then of\r\nbarricades--no fighting for the partition of property--no bloodshed,\r\npreparatory to the coveted rape and pillage! The man who can talk in\r\nthis way is beneath the average of idiots; or, otherwise, he is\r\nsomewhat worse. Not only during the last year, but within the last\r\nfive months, we have seen that the whole standing armies of Europe\r\nhave been employed in the task of suppressing insurrection, and have\r\nnot been able to do it. Under these circumstances, what state would be\r\n\"predisposed\" to surrender its citizens to the tender mercies of\r\ndemocracy? Ignorant indeed must be the audience that could listen to\r\nsuch pitiable drivelling as this!\r\n\r\nUntil it can be shown or proved that our armaments, even in ordinary\r\ntimes, are larger than are required for the purposes of defence, of\r\ninternal tranquillity, and of colonial occupation, there is no cause\r\nfor reduction at all. The troops at home are maintained for the first\r\ntwo objects, since it would be as wise, in the time of peace, to\r\ndismantle the fortifications of a town and to spike the cannon, as to\r\ndispense with an army. Is there no necessity for the troops at home?\r\nThe experience of last year alone has shown us what we might expect if\r\nCobden's views were realised. Glasgow, the second largest city of the\r\nempire, was for a time in the hands of the mob. We doubt whether the\r\nstiffest free-trader in the West would now be disposed to renounce\r\nmilitary protection. Have the people of Liverpool already forgotten\r\nthat their shipping and warehouses were threatened with incendiarism,\r\nand that such apprehensions of a rising were entertained, that, at the\r\nearnest entreaty of the magistracy, a camp was established in their\r\nvicinity? What would be the state of Ireland, at this moment, if the\r\ntroops were withdrawn, or their number so materially lessened as to\r\ngive a chance of success, however momentary, to insurrection? But it\r\nis useless to ask such questions, for, in reality, there is hardly a\r\nsane man in the British islands who does not know what the immediate\r\nresult would be, and the horrible penalty we should ultimately pay for\r\nsuch weak and culpable parsimony.\r\n\r\nIt is a very favourite topic, with finance reformers, to refer to the\r\nstate of the army and navy as it existed previous to the French\r\nRevolution. \"In 1792,\" they say, \"the whole cost of these departments,\r\nincluding the ordnance, amounted only to five millions and a half--why\r\nshould we not now reduce our expenditure to the same amount?\" It is\r\nwearisome to enter into the task of explanation with these gentlemen,\r\nwho, after all, are but slenderly acquainted with statistics, else\r\nthey would at once divine the answer: nevertheless we shall undertake\r\nit. According to the nearest approximation which can be made, the\r\nBritish islands, in the year 1792, contained a population of about\r\n_fifteen and a half millions_. The census in 1841 showed a population\r\nof _twenty-seven millions_, and at the present moment the number is\r\nprobably not short of _thirty_. So that, on the reasonable principle\r\nthat military establishments should bear a certain ratio to the\r\npopulation, and excluding every other consideration, the annual\r\nestimates ought, according to the standard of the financial reformers,\r\nto be at least eleven millions. But then, be it observed, our colonial\r\npossessions were comparatively small compared with their present\r\nextent. Since 1792, we have received accession of the following\r\ncolonies and settlements:--Ceylon, Trinidad, St Lucia, Malta,\r\nHeligoland, British Guiana, the Falkland Islands, Hong-Kong, Labuan,\r\nCape of Good Hope, Mauritius, Van Diemen's Land, Western and Southern\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, and the Ionian Islands. The area of these new\r\npossessions is considerably more than _six times_ that of the whole\r\nextent of the British islands; the surface of the new colonies being,\r\nin square miles, no less than 828,408, whilst that of Britain proper\r\nis merely 122,823. We purposely abstain from alluding to the extent\r\nand increment of our older colonies, as our object is simply to show\r\nthe difference of our position now, from what it was in the year\r\nimmediately preceding the outbreak of the first French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, however, let us keep strictly to our present point,\r\nwhich is the necessity of maintaining a standing army at home. Within\r\nthe last fifty-seven years, the population at home has doubled--a fact\r\nwhich, of itself, will account for many social evils utterly beyond\r\nthe reach of legislation. The enormous increase of the manufacturing\r\ntowns has not been attended with any improvement in the morals of the\r\npeople. The statistical returns of criminal commitments show that vice\r\nhas spread in a ratio far greater than the increase of population; and\r\nalong with vice has appeared its invariable concomitant, disaffection.\r\nEvery period of stagnation of trade is marked by a display of\r\nChartism: the example set by such associations as the League has not\r\nbeen lost upon the greater masses of the people. Ireland is a volcano\r\nin which the fires of rebellion are never wholly extinguished, and\r\nevery internal movement there is sensibly felt upon this side of the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nBut it is needless, perhaps, to enlarge upon the point, because there\r\nare very few persons who maintain that our home force is greater than\r\nthe occasion requires. That admitted, the question is very\r\nconsiderably narrowed. The reductions demanded would then fall to be\r\nmade in that portion of our armaments which is used for colonial\r\noccupation and defence.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us see what we have to occupy and defend. In 1792, the area\r\nof the British colonies which we still retain was about 565,700 square\r\nmiles. Subsequent additions have extended this surface to 1,400,000.\r\nThis calculation, be it remarked, is altogether exclusive of India.\r\n\r\nThe free-traders themselves do not aver that we maintain a larger\r\nforce than is compatible with their magnitude for the occupation of\r\nthe colonies. \"I am quite aware,\" says Cobden, \"that any great\r\nreduction in our military establishments _must depend upon a complete\r\nchange_ in our colonial system; and I consider such a change to be the\r\nnecessary consequence of our recent commercial policy.\" We are glad at\r\nlast to arrive at the truth. That one sentence contains the key to the\r\npresent crusade against armaments, and it is very well that we should\r\nunderstand and consider it in time. Our readers must not, however,\r\nunderstand the word \"change\" in the literal sense; the following\r\nextract from the Edinburgh tract will put the matter in a clearer\r\nlight. \"The possession of the colonies is supposed to add lustre to\r\nthe crown; but it may be doubted whether the honour is not purchased\r\nat a price considerably beyond its value. The colonies pay no taxes\r\ninto the exchequer: we keep them, they do not keep us. An Englishman\r\nmay be told that he belongs to an empire on which the sun never sets;\r\nbut, as he pays dearly for this in taxation, and gets nothing but\r\nsentiment in return, he may be inclined to question the value of that\r\nvast dominion on his connexion with which he is congratulated. But if\r\nthe Englishman makes nothing by the colonial possessions, neither does\r\nthe colonist. As things are managed, the union is mutually\r\nembarrassing, while the expenses we incur for maintaining the colonies\r\nare ruinous.\" Were we right or wrong when we said, two years ago, that\r\nthe tendency of free trade was a deliberate movement towards the\r\ndismemberment of the British empire, and the separation of the\r\ncolonies from the mother country? Here you have the principle almost\r\nopenly avowed. The colonies are said to cost us about four millions\r\na-year, and this opens too rich a field for the penny-wise economist\r\nto be resisted. Nor are we in the slightest degree surprised at these\r\nmen availing themselves of the argument. If they are right in their\r\npremises, they are also right in their conclusion. If the people of\r\nthis country are deliberately of opinion that our commercial policy\r\nis, henceforward and for ever, to be regulated upon the principles of\r\nfree trade, the colonies should be left to themselves, and Earl Grey\r\nimmediately cashiered. This is what Cobden and his followers are\r\naiming at; this is the ultimate result of the measures planned, and\r\nproposed, and carried by Sir Robert Peel. It is no figment or false\r\nalarm of ours. The free-traders do not take the pains to disguise it:\r\ntheir main argument for the reduction of our forces is the uselessness\r\nand expense of the colonies, and they seem prepared to lower the\r\nBritish flag in every quarter of the globe. Our fellow-citizen who has\r\ncompiled the last Financial tract speaks to the point with a calm\r\nphilosophy which shows the thoroughness of his conviction: he says,\r\n\"As foreigners now trade with our colonies on the same terms with\r\nourselves, it is evident that the colonists prefer our goods, only\r\nbecause they are better and cheaper than those of foreigners; _it\r\ntherefore seems reasonable to suppose that the colonies would continue\r\nto buy from us were the connexion dissolved, or greatly changed in\r\ncharacter_. The United States of America once were our colonies, and\r\nthe trade with them has vastly increased since they became\r\nindependent.\" According to this view, it would appear that Papineau\r\nwas not only a disinterested patriot, but also, an enlightened\r\neconomist!\r\n\r\nSee, then, what great matters spring from petty sources!--how personal\r\nambition, and competition for power between two statesmen of no high\r\nor exalted principle, can in a few years lead to a deliberate project,\r\nand a large confederacy, for the dismemberment of the British empire!\r\nTo gain additional swiftness in the race for ascendency, Sir Robert\r\nPeel and Lord John Russell alternately threw away, most uselessly and\r\nrecklessly, many of the surest items of the national income. They\r\nsacrificed, until further sacrifice was no longer possible, without\r\nconceding a broad principle. The principle was conceded; and the\r\nbastard system of free trade, without reciprocity and without\r\nequivalent, was substituted for the wiser system which had been the\r\nfoundation of our greatness. By this time, indirect taxation had been\r\nreduced so low that the revenue fell below the mark of the\r\nexpenditure; the duties levied upon imports exhibited a marked\r\ndecline. Both Peel and Russell were committed to free trade, and\r\nneither of them could, with any consistency, retrace their steps.\r\nRussell, then in power, had no alternative except to propose\r\nadditional direct burdens, by augmenting the income-tax. This\r\nproposition was rejected, and there was a dead-lock. Lord John was at\r\nhis wits' end. The free-traders now propose to relieve him from his\r\nembarrassment, by cutting down the expenditure so as to meet the\r\ndiminished income. This can only be done by reducing the army and\r\nnavy, and the army and navy cannot be reduced except by sacrificing\r\nthe colonies; therefore, say the free-traders, get rid of the colonies\r\nat once, and, the work is ready-done to your hands.\r\n\r\nWe defy any man, be he Whig, Peelite, Free-trader, or Chartist, to\r\ncontrovert the truth of what we have stated above. We anticipated the\r\nresult from the first hour that Sir Robert Peel yielded, not to the\r\nexpressed will of the nation, but to the clamour of a selfish and\r\norganised faction; and every move since has been in exact concordance\r\nwith our anticipations. Last year, Lord John Russell showed some\r\nspirit of resistance to the power which was dragging him downward: he\r\nrefused to tamper with the army. In an article which appeared in this\r\nMagazine just twelve months ago, we said--\"It is to the credit of the\r\nWhigs that, far as they have been led astray by adopting the\r\nnew-fangled political doctrines--rather, as we believe, for the sake\r\nof maintaining power than from any belief in their efficacy--they have\r\ndeclined all participation with the Manchester crew, in their recent\r\nattempts to lower the position and diminish the influence of Great\r\nBritain.\" The country knows, by this time, that we cannot repeat the\r\nencomium. Last year, _before there was a single disturbance abroad_,\r\nbefore insurrection had arisen in Ireland, Lord John Russell brought\r\nforward his budget, and, with the support of the great majority of the\r\nHouse, not only peremptorily refused to accede to a diminution of our\r\nforces, but actually proposed an augmentation. _This year_, we find in\r\nthe royal speech the following paragraph--\"The present aspect of\r\naffairs has enabled me to make large reductions on the estimates of\r\nlast year.\"\r\n\r\n\"The present aspect of affairs!\"--Go to, then--let us see what the\r\nphrase is worth--how far the context of the whole speech will justify\r\nthe choice of the expression? This is no time for shuffling or\r\nweakness--no time for party-tricks. The atmosphere is dark around us.\r\nBy the help of Heaven we have stood the pelting of the storm, and yet\r\nstand unscathed; but the clouds are still black and threatening. We\r\ncannot take a vague assertion, even though it proceeded from a\r\nminister a thousand times more able and trustworthy than the present\r\npremier. We must have proofs before we loosen our cloak, and lessen\r\nthe security of our position.\r\n\r\nHow stand we with regard to the Continental powers? For the first\r\ntime, for many years, the British Sovereign has been unable to state\r\n\"that she continues to receive from all foreign powers assurances of\r\ntheir friendly relations.\" Instead of that we are simply told, what no\r\none doubts, that her Majesty is desirous to maintain the most friendly\r\nrelations with the other members of the European family.\r\nUnfortunately, however, desire does not always imply possession. Are\r\nwe to attribute this omission of the usual paragraph to mere\r\ninadvertence? or are we indeed to conclude that, abroad, there has\r\narisen a feeling so unfriendly that to hazard the assertion of former\r\nrelationship would really be equivalent to a falsehood? It is painful\r\nto allow that we must arrive at the latter conclusion. The moral\r\nweight and influence which Britain once exercised on the Continent has\r\nutterly decayed in the hands of Whig administrations. Instead of\r\nmaintaining that attitude of high dignified reserve which becomes the\r\nfirst maritime power of Europe, we have been exhibited in the light of\r\na nation of interfering intriguers, whose proffered mediation is\r\nalmost equivalent to an insult. Mediators of this kind never are, nor\r\ncan be, popular. The answer invariably is, in the language of holy\r\nwrit--\"Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to\r\nkill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?\" and, in consequence, wherever\r\nwe have interfered we have made matters worse, or else have been\r\ncompelled to submit to an ignominious rebuff. Every one knows what\r\nwere the consequences of Lord Palmerston's impertinent and gratuitous\r\nsuggestions to the crown of Spain. \"What,\" said Lord Stanley, \"is the\r\nstate of our relations with that court? You have most unwisely,\r\nthrough your minister, interfered in the internal administration of\r\nthe affairs of that country. That offence has been visited by the\r\nGovernment of that country upon our ministers in a manner so offensive\r\nthat, great as was the provocation given by the British minister, no\r\nman in your Lordship's House, with the information we possess, could\r\nstand up and say that the Government of Spain was justified in the\r\ncourse they had pursued, however much the magnitude of the offence\r\nmight have palliated it. But the state of affairs in Spain is this:\r\nYour minister has been ignominiously driven from Madrid, and you have\r\nquietly and tacitly acquiesced in the insult which the Spanish\r\nGovernment have put upon you.\" The immediate consequences of Minto\r\nnegotiation in Italy have been assassination and rebellion, the flight\r\nof the Pope from his dominions, and the surrender of the sacred city\r\nto the anarchy of the Club propagandists. But perhaps the worst\r\ninstance of our interference is that with the Neapolitan and Sicilian\r\naffairs. We have thus chosen openly to countenance rebellion: we have\r\ngone the length of negotiating with insurgents, for securing them an\r\nindependent government. We held out a threat, which we did not dare to\r\nfulfil. After menacing the King of Naples with a squadron off his own\r\nshores, apparently to prevent the expedition then prepared from\r\nsetting sail for Sicily--and thereby encouraging the insurgents by the\r\nprospect of British aid--we allowed the fleet to sail, the war to\r\nbegin, the city of Messina to be bombarded, and then, with a tardy\r\nhumanity, we interfered to check the carnage. In consequence, we are\r\nblamed and detested by both parties. The Neapolitan Government feel\r\nthat we have acted towards them in a manner wholly inconsistent with\r\nthe character of an ally; that in negotiating with rebels, as we have\r\ndone, we have absolutely broken faith, and violated honour; and that\r\neven our last interference was as unprincipled as our first. If the\r\nplea of humanity were to be allowed in such cases, where would be the\r\nend of interference? Durst we have said to Austria, after the\r\nreoccupation of Vienna, \"You have taken your city, and may keep it,\r\nbut you shall not punish the rebels. If you do, we shall interfere, to\r\nprevent the horrors of military execution\"? We think that even Lord\r\nPalmerston, notwithstanding his itch for interposition, would have\r\nhesitated in doing this. Lord Lansdowne, in touching upon the subject\r\nof the Austrian and Hungarian relations, is positively conservative in\r\nhis tone. According to him, the British cabinet views rebellion in a\r\nvery different light, according as it appears in the centre or the\r\nsouth of Europe--on the banks of the Danube, or on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean. \"As regarded the administration of the internal affairs\r\nof Austria and Hungary, the British Government had not been asked to\r\ninterfere, and had not desired to interfere. They contemplated, as all\r\nEurope did, with that feeling which was experienced when men were seen\r\nsuccessfully struggling with difficulties, a contest which had led to\r\nthe display of so much lofty character on the part of individuals. Had\r\nthis been the place, he (the Marquis of Lansdowne) should have been as\r\nready as the noble lord to pay his tribute of respect to individuals\r\nwho had appeared in that part of the world, and had been most\r\nsuccessful in their efforts to restore the glories of the Austrian\r\narmy in her own dominions. _In the negotiations between the Emperor\r\nand his subjects they had no right to interfere_, neither had they\r\nbeen invited by either party.\" This is sound doctrine, we admit, but\r\nwhy treat Naples otherwise than Austria? Had we any right to interfere\r\nin the negotiations between the King of the Two Sicilies and _his_\r\nsubjects? Not one tittle more than in the other case; and we beg to\r\nsuggest to Lord Palmerston, whether it is creditable that this country\r\nshould be considered in the light of a bully who hesitates not, in the\r\ncase of a lesser power, to take liberties, which he prudently abstains\r\nfrom doing where one more likely to resent such unwarrantable conduct\r\nis concerned. As for the Sicilians, they feel that they have been\r\nbetrayed. But for the prospect of British support, certainly warranted\r\nby our attitude, they might not have gone so far, nor drawn upon their\r\nheads the terrible retribution which overtook them. Such are the\r\nresults of Palmerstonian interference, at once dangerous, despicable,\r\nand humiliating.\r\n\r\nWe have read with much attention the speech of Lord John Russell, on\r\nthe first night of the Session, explanatory of the Italian\r\ntransactions; and we must say that his vindication of his\r\nfather-in-law is such as to inspire us with a devout hope that the\r\nnoble bungler may, in future, be forced to confine his talents for\r\nintrigue to some sphere which does not involve the general\r\ntranquillity of Europe. Considering the manner in which we are mulcted\r\nfor the support of the Elliots, we are fairly entitled to ask the\r\nhoary chief of that marauding clan to draw his salary in peace,\r\nwithout undertaking the task of fomenting civil discord between our\r\nallied powers and their subjects. But even more important is the sort\r\nof admission pervading the address of the Premier, that our\r\ninterference in the Sicilian business was regulated by the views\r\nentertained by the French admiral. Sir W. Parker, it seems, did not\r\ntake the initiative; it was not his finer sense of humanity which was\r\noffended; for, according to Lord John, \"when that expedition reached\r\nMessina, there took place, at the close of the siege of Messina,\r\nevents which appeared so horrible and so inhuman in the eyes of the\r\nFrench admiral that he determined to interfere. It appeared to the\r\nFrench admiral, that it was impossible such a warfare could continue\r\nwithout an utter desolation of Sicily, and such alienation from the\r\nNeapolitan Government, on the part of the Sicilians, that no final\r\nterms of agreement could arise; he therefore determined to take upon\r\nhimself to put a stop to the further progress of such a horrible\r\nwarfare. _After he had so determined, he communicated_ with Sir W.\r\nParker. Sir W. Parker had a most difficult duty to perform; but,\r\ntaking all the circumstances into consideration, our former friendly\r\nrelations with the Sicilians--the accounts he had received from the\r\ncaptain of one of her Majesty's ships then at Messina--the atrocities\r\nhe heard of, _and that the French admiral was about to act_--and that\r\nit was important at that juncture that the two nations should act in\r\nconcert, his determination was to give orders similar to those which\r\nhad been given by the French admiral.\" Now, although we are fully\r\nalive to the advantage of maintaining the best possible understanding\r\nwith the fluctuating French governments, and exceedingly anxious that\r\nno untoward cause for jealousy should arise, we do not think that Lord\r\nJohn's explanation will be felt as satisfactory by the country. It\r\nappears by this statement, that, had there been no French fleet there,\r\nSir W. Parker would not have thought himself entitled to interfere. It\r\nis _because_ the French admiral was about to move that he thought fit\r\nto move likewise. If there was any honour in the transaction, we have\r\nforfeited all claim to it by this avowal. If, on the contrary, there\r\nwas any wrong done, we excuse it only by the undignified plea, that we\r\nwere following the example of France. This is a new position for\r\nBritain to assume--not, in our eyes, one which is likely to raise us\r\nin Continental estimation, or to support the prestige of our maritime\r\nsupremacy. To quarrel with our allies is at all times folly; to\r\nvindicate interference on the ground of maintaining a good\r\nunderstanding with another power, is scarce consonant with principle,\r\nand betrays a conscious weakness on the part of those who have no\r\nbetter argument to advance.\r\n\r\nSee, then, how we are situated with the foreign powers. Spain is\r\nalienated from us--Austria not fervid in her love, for there too, it\r\nwould seem, we have most unnecessarily interfered. We are detested in\r\nNaples and Sicily, unpopular elsewhere in Italy, mixed up with the\r\nSchleswig dispute, and on no diplomatic terms with Central Germany.\r\nOur understanding with France has fortunately remained amicable, but\r\nwe neither know the policy of France, nor can we foresee under what\r\ncircumstances she may be placed in a month from the present time. Is\r\nthis a peaceful prospect? Let us hear Lord John Russell, whose\r\ninterest it is to make things appear in as favourable a light as\r\npossible:--\"I do not contend that there is not cause for anxiety in\r\nthe present state of Europe. I am far from thinking that the\r\nrevolutions which took place last year have run their course, and that\r\nevery nation in which they occurred can now be said to be in a state\r\nof solid security. I rejoice as much as any man that the ancient\r\nempire of Austria, our old ally, is recovering her splendour, and is\r\nshowing her strength in such a conspicuous manner. Still I cannot\r\nforget that there are many questions not yet settled with regard to\r\nthe internal institutions of Austria--that the question of the\r\nformation of what the honourable gentleman (Mr D'Israeli) has called\r\nan empire without an emperor, is still in debate, and that we cannot\r\nbe sure what the ultimate result of these events may be. It is also\r\ntrue that there may have been, during last year, an excess of\r\napprehension, caused by the great events that were taking place, and\r\nby the rising up of some wild theories, pretending to found the\r\nhappiness of the state and of mankind on visionary and unsound\r\nspeculations, on which the happiness of no people or country can ever\r\nbe founded. We have seen these opinions prevail in many countries to a\r\nconsiderable extent; and no one can say that events may not, at some\r\nunforeseen moment, take an unfortunate turn for the peace and\r\ntranquillity of Europe.\" These are sensible views, moderately but\r\nfairly stated; and we ask nothing more than that his lordship's\r\nmeasures should be framed in accordance with a belief which is not\r\nonly his, but is entertained by every man of ordinary capacity\r\nthroughout the country. Experience has shown us that war is almost\r\ninvariably preceded by revolution. These are not days in which\r\npotentates can assemble their armies, march across their frontiers\r\nwithout palpable cause of offence, and seize upon the territory of\r\ntheir neighbours. But for the spirit of innovation, restlessness, and\r\nlust of change, never more generally exhibited than now amongst the\r\npeople, the world would remain at peace. It is only when, as in the\r\ncase of Germany and Italy, the sceptre is wrenched from the hands of\r\nthe constitutional authorities, and when the rule of demagogues and\r\nexperimentalists commences, that the danger of war begins. At such a\r\ntime, there are no settled principles of polity or of action. Crude\r\ntheories are produced, and, for a time, perhaps, acted upon as though\r\nthey were sound realities. Men adopt vague and general terms as their\r\nwatchwords, and strive to shape out constitutions to be reared upon\r\nthese utterly unsubstantial foundations. Laws are changed, and the\r\nexecutive loses its power. All is anarchy and confusion, until, by\r\ncommon consent of those who still retain some portion of their senses,\r\nmilitary despotism is called in to strangle the new-born license. This\r\nis a state of matters which usually results in war. The dominant\r\nauthorities feel that their hold of public opinion is most precarious,\r\nunless they can contrive to give that opinion an impulse in another\r\ndirection, and, at the same time, to employ, in some way or other,\r\nthose multitudes whom revolution has driven from the arts and\r\noccupations of peace, and who, unless so provided for, immediately\r\ndegenerate into conspirators at home. War is sometimes resorted to as\r\nthe means of avoiding revolution. The disturbed state of the north of\r\nItaly furnished Charles Albert with a pretext for marching his army on\r\nMilan, as much, we believe, on account of the revolutionary spirit\r\nrife within his own dominions, as from any decided hope of territorial\r\naggrandisement. This was the policy of Napoleon, who perfectly\r\nunderstood the character of the people he had to deal with, and who\r\nacted on the thorough conviction that war was the necessary\r\nconsequence of revolution. We do not say that, in the present\r\ninstances, such calamitous results are inevitable--we have hope that\r\nFrance may this time achieve a permanent constitution without having\r\nrecourse to aggression. At the same time, it would be folly to shut\r\nour eyes to the fact that, throughout a great part of Europe, the old\r\nboundaries have been grievously disturbed; and that the modern system\r\nof intervention has a decided tendency to provoke war, at periods when\r\nthe popular mind is raised to a pitch of extraordinary violence, and\r\nwhen the passions are so keenly excited as to disregard the appeals of\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThese considerations are not only directed towards the course of our\r\nforeign policy; they are of vast moment in judging of the expediency\r\nof reducing our forces at this particular time. Last year, with NO\r\nrevolutions abroad, the Whigs not only refused to lessen the amount of\r\nour standing army, but increased it. This year, when the Continent is\r\nstill in a state of insurrection, and when war is pending in different\r\nparts of Europe--when, moreover, an Indian contest, more serious in\r\nits aspect than any other which we have recently seen, has\r\ncommenced--they propose to begin the work of reduction. Her Majesty is\r\nmade to say,--\"The present aspect of affairs has enabled me to make\r\nlarge reductions on the estimates of last year!\"\r\n\r\nWe never have suspected Lord John Russell of possessing much\r\naccomplishment in the art of logic; but, really, in the present\r\ninstance, he has the merit of inventing a new system. According to his\r\nown showing, according to his recorded admissions, his doctrine is\r\nthis: In time of peace, when there is no occasion for armaments,\r\nincrease them; in time of threatened war and actual disturbance, when\r\nthere may be every occasion for them, let them be reduced. Yet perhaps\r\nwe are wrong: Sir Robert Peel may possibly be admitted as the author\r\nof this vast discovery--in which case, Lord John can merely rank as a\r\ndistinguished pupil. The astute baronet, in his zeal for commercial\r\nconvulsions, has taught us to expand our currency when there is no\r\nmoney-famine, and to contract it in the case of exigency. Whether\r\nCalifornian facts may not hereafter get the better of Tamworth\r\ntheories, we shall not at the present moment stop to inquire. In the\r\nmean time let us confine our attention to the proposed reductions.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore compelled--reluctantly, for we had hoped better\r\nthings from men styling themselves British statesmen--to adopt the\r\nview of Lord Stanley, in his powerful and masterly estimate of the\r\npolicy of the present Government. \"In the face of all this,\" said the\r\nnoble lord, after recapitulating the posture of affairs at home and\r\nabroad, \"ministers have had the confidence to place in the mouth of\r\ntheir sovereign the astounding declaration, that the aspect of affairs\r\nis such as to enable them to effect large reductions in the estimates.\r\nI venture to state, openly and fearlessly, that it is not the aspect\r\nof affairs abroad or in Ireland, but the aspect of affairs in another\r\nplace, which has induced the government to make reductions. _I believe\r\nthat they have no alternative but to do as they are ordered._\" Here,\r\nthen, is the first yielding to the new movement--the first step taken,\r\nat the bidding of the Leaguers, towards a policy which has for its\r\navowed end the abandonment of the colonies! The question naturally\r\narises--where is to be the end of these concessions? Are we in reality\r\nruled by a Manchester faction, or by a body of men of free and\r\nindependent opinions, who hold their commissions from the Queen, and\r\nwho are sworn to uphold the interests and dignity of their mistress\r\nand of the realm? Let us see who compose that faction, what are their\r\nprinciples, what are their interests, and what means they employ to\r\nwork out the ends which they propose. The splendid speech of Mr\r\nD'Israeli, in moving his amendment to the address--a speech which we\r\nhesitate not to say is superior to any of his former efforts, and\r\nwhich displays an ability at the present time unequalled in the House\r\nof Commons--a speech not more eloquent than true, not more glowing in\r\nits rhetoric than clear and conclusive in its logical deductions--has\r\ntold with withering effect upon the new democratic faction, and has\r\nexposed the ministry which bows before it to the contumely of the\r\nnation at large. \"I am told,\" said the honourable member, \"that\r\nEngland must be contented with a lesser demonstration of brute force.\r\nI am not prepared to contradict that doctrine; but I should like to\r\nhave a clear definition of what brute force is. In my opinion, a\r\nhighly disciplined army, employed in a great performance--that of the\r\ndefence of the country, the maintenance of order, the vindication of a\r\nnation's honour, or the consolidation of national wealth and\r\ngreatness--that a body of men thus disciplined, influenced and led by\r\nsome of the most eminent generals--by an Alexander, a Cæsar, or a\r\nWellesley--is one in which moral force is as much entered into as\r\nphysical. But if, for instance, I find a man possessing a certain\r\nfacility of speech, happily adapted to his cause, addressing a great\r\nbody of his fellow-men in inflammatory appeals to their passions, and\r\nstirring them up against the institutions of the country, that is what\r\nI call brute force--which I think the country would be very well\r\ncontent to do without, and which, if there be any sense or spirit left\r\nin men, or any men of right feeling in the country, they will resolve\r\nto put down as an intolerable and ignominious tyranny! I have often\r\nobserved that the hangers-on of the new system are highly fond of\r\nquestioning the apothegm of a great Swedish minister, who said, 'With\r\nhow little wisdom a nation may be governed!' My observations for the\r\nlast few years have led me to the conclusion, not exactly similar, but\r\nanalogous to that remark; and if ever I should be blessed with\r\noffspring, instead of using the words of the Swedish statesman, I\r\nwould rather address my son in this way, 'My son, see with how much\r\nignorance you can agitate a nation!' Yes! but the Queen's Ministers\r\nare truckling to these men! That is the position of affairs. Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers have yielded to public opinion. Public opinion on\r\nthe Continent has turned out to be the voice of secret societies; and\r\npublic opinion in England is the voice and clamour of organised clubs.\r\nHer Majesty's Ministers have yielded to public opinion as a tradesman\r\ndoes who is detected in an act of overcharge--he yields to public\r\nopinion when he takes a less sum. So the financial affairs of this\r\ncountry are to be arranged, not upon principles of high policy, or\r\nfrom any imperial considerations, but because there is an unholy\r\npressure from a minority which demands it, and who have a confidence\r\nof success because they know that they have already beaten two Prime\r\nMinisters.\" No one who has perused the report of the proceedings at\r\nthe late free-trade dinner at Manchester can have failed to remark\r\nthat the League is still alive and active. It was not for mere\r\npurposes of jubilation, for the sake of congratulating each other on\r\nthe accomplishment of their old object, that these men assembled.\r\nExultation there was indeed, and some not over-prudent disclosures as\r\nto the nature and extent of the machinery which they had employed, and\r\nthe agencies they had used to excite one class of the community\r\nagainst the other; their inveterate hatred towards the aristocracy and\r\nlanded gentry of Great Britain was shown in the diatribes of almost\r\nevery one of the commercial orators. \"We cannot,\" says _The Times_,\r\n\"but regret that in those portions of the Manchester speeches which\r\nrefer to their corn-law achievements, the minds of the speakers appear\r\nstill imbittered with class hatred, and feelings of misplaced\r\nanimosity towards their fellow-countrymen.\" \"As a people,\" quoth\r\nFriend John Bright, \"we have found out we have some power. We have\r\ndiscovered we were not born with saddles on our backs, and country\r\ngentlemen with spurs.\" Ulterior objects are not only hinted at, but\r\nclearly and broadly propounded. The population of the towns is again\r\nto be pitted against that of the counties, and the counties, if\r\npossible, to be swamped by an inundation of urban voters. The banquet\r\nof Wednesday was followed by the financial meeting of Thursday. George\r\nWilson, the ancient president of the Anti-Corn-Law League, occupied\r\nthe chair. Bright and Cobden, the Bitias and Pandarus of the\r\ncotton-spinners, moved the first of a series of resolutions: and an\r\nassociation was formed, \"for maintaining an efficient care over the\r\nregistration of electors in boroughs and counties, and to promote the\r\nincrease of the county electors by the extension of the forty-shilling\r\nfreehold franchise.\" It was further agreed \"that the association\r\nshould co-operate with similar associations throughout the country,\r\nand that parties subscribing £10 annually shall be members of the\r\ncouncil, together with such persons, being members of the association,\r\nas shall be elected by any vote of the council.\" We hope that these\r\nannouncements will open the eyes of those who thought that by yielding\r\nto the former agitation they were adopting the best means of bringing\r\nit to a close. Agitation never is so quieted. The experiment has been\r\nmade in Ireland until further yielding was impossible; and so will it\r\nbe in Britain, if a higher, a bolder, and a more steadfast line of\r\npolicy should not be adopted by future governments. From the present\r\nCabinet we expect nothing. Their invariable course is to yield; for\r\nthey neither have the ability to devise measures for themselves, nor\r\nthe public virtue to resist unconstitutional encroachments. For where\r\nis the constitution of this country, if we are to be practically\r\ngoverned by Leagues, by huge clubs with their ramifications extending,\r\nas in France, throughout every town of the empire, and secretly worked\r\naccording to the will of an inscrutable and unscrupulous council?\r\nPublic opinion, as we understood the phrase in Britain, manifested\r\nitself in Parliament; now, we are told, that it is something\r\nelse--that it is the voice of clubs and assemblies without. Very well,\r\nand very powerfully did Mr D'Israeli allude to this system of\r\norganisation in the close of his animated speech:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have noticed the crude and hostile speculations that are\r\n     afloat, especially respecting financial reform, not only\r\n     because I consider them to be very dangerous to the country;\r\n     not only because, according to rumour, they have converted\r\n     the Government; but because, avowedly on the part of their\r\n     promulgators, they are only tending to ultimate efforts. This\r\n     I must say of the new revolutionary movement, that its\r\n     proceedings are characterised by frank audacity. They have\r\n     already menaced the church, and they have scarcely spared the\r\n     throne. They have denounced the constitutional estates of the\r\n     realm as antiquated and cumbrous machinery, not adapted to\r\n     the present day. No doubt, for the expedition of business,\r\n     the Financial Reform Association presents greater facilities\r\n     than the House of Commons. It is true that it may be long\r\n     before there are any of those collisions of argument and\r\n     intellect among them which we have here; they have no\r\n     discussions and no doubts; but still I see no part of the\r\n     go-a-head system which is likely to supersede the sagacity\r\n     and matured wisdom of English institutions; and so long as\r\n     the English legislature is the chosen temple of free\r\n     discussion, I have no fear, whatever party may be in power,\r\n     that the people of England will be in favour of the new\r\n     societies. I know very well the difficulties which we have to\r\n     encounter--the dangers which illumine the distance. The\r\n     honourable gentleman, who is the chief originator of this\r\n     movement, made a true observation when he frankly and freely\r\n     said, that the best chance for the new revolution lay in the\r\n     dislocation of parties in this House. I told you that, when I\r\n     ventured to address some observations to the house almost in\r\n     the last hour of the last session. I saw the difficulty which\r\n     such a state of things would inevitably produce. But let us\r\n     not despair; we have a duty to perform, and, notwithstanding\r\n     all that has occurred, we have still the inspiration of a\r\n     great cause. We stand here to uphold not only the throne, but\r\n     the empire; to vindicate the industrial privileges of the\r\n     working classes; to reconstruct the colonial system; to\r\n     uphold the church, no longer assailed by appropriation\r\n     clauses, but by vizored foes; and to maintain the majesty of\r\n     parliament against the Jacobin manoeuvres of Lancashire. This\r\n     is a stake not lightly to be lost. At any rate, I would\r\n     sooner my tongue were palsied before I counselled the people\r\n     of England to lower their tone. Yes, I would sooner quit this\r\n     House for ever than I would say to the people of England that\r\n     they overrated their position. I leave that delicate\r\n     intimation to the fervid patriotism of the gentlemen of the\r\n     new school. For my part, I denounce their politics, and I\r\n     defy their predictions; but I do so because I have faith in\r\n     the people of England, their genius, and their destiny!\"\r\n\r\nOur views therefore are simply these--that while it is the duty of\r\ngovernment to enforce and practise economy in every department of the\r\npublic service, they are not entitled, upon any consideration\r\nwhatever, to palter with the public safety. We cannot, until the\r\nestimates are brought forward, pronounce any judgment upon the merits\r\nof the proposed reductions--we cannot tell whether these are to be\r\nnumerical, or effected on another principle. Needless expenditure we\r\ndeprecate as strongly as the most sturdy adherent of the League, and\r\nwe expect and hope that in several departments there will be a saving,\r\nnot because that has been clamoured for, but because the works which\r\noccasioned the outlay have been completed. For example, the\r\nintroduction of steam vessels into our navy has cost a large sum,\r\nwhich may not be required in future. But to assign, as ministers have\r\ndone, the position of affairs abroad as a reason for reducing our\r\narmaments, is utterly preposterous. It is a miserable pretext to cover\r\ntheir contemptible truckling, and we are perfectly sure that it will\r\nbe appreciated throughout the country at its proper value. It remains\r\nto be seen whether these estimates can be reduced so low as to meet\r\nthe expenditure of the country. Our own opinion is, that they cannot,\r\nwithout impairing the efficiency of either branch of the service; and\r\nwe hardly think that ministers will venture to go so far.\r\n\r\nLet us, at all events, hope that Lord John Russell and his colleagues\r\nare not so lost to the sense of their duty, as to make the sweeping\r\nreduction which the Manchester politicians demand--that they will not\r\nconsent to renounce the colonies, or to leave them destitute of\r\ndefence. Still the question remains--how are we to raise our revenue?\r\nTo this point we perpetually recur, for it is in this that the real\r\ndifficulty lies. What says her Majesty's Government to this? The\r\nanswer is quite short--Nothing. They have no scheme, so far as we are\r\ngiven to understand. They cannot go back upon indirect taxation; the\r\ncountry will not stand any increase of the direct burdens. The old\r\nrule was, out of two evils choose the least: the new rule seems to be,\r\nchoose neither the one nor the other, but let matters go on as they\r\nbest can. We have that confidence in the good sense of the country,\r\nthat we cannot believe that this _laissez faire_ system will be much\r\nlonger tolerated. The family party, as the interwoven clique of\r\nRussells, Mintos, Greys, and Woods, has not unaptly been designated,\r\nwas not placed in power merely to enjoy the sweets of office, or to\r\nprovide for their numerous kindred; they must either grapple with the\r\npressing difficulties of the state, or surrender their places to\r\nothers who are more confident and capable.\r\n\r\nConfidence is not wanting in certain quarters, though capability may\r\nbe a matter of more dubiety. Mr M'Gregor, M.P. for Glasgow, and\r\nconcocter of the famous free-trade tables, is ready at a moment's\r\nnotice to produce a new financial scheme, founded upon unerring data,\r\nand promising a large increase of the revenue. Cobden has another\r\nscheme on the irons with the same view, benevolently proposing to lay\r\nthe land of Great Britain under further contribution. We believe that,\r\nafter the experience of the past, few people will be likely to accept\r\neither budget without considerable hesitation. Both gentlemen have\r\ncommitted a slight mistake in imitating Joseph's interpretation of the\r\ndream of Pharaoh; they should have inversed the order, and given the\r\nyears of famine the precedence of the years of plenty.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that it is a very simple matter to take off existing\r\ntaxes, but marvellously difficult to impose new ones. Granting that a\r\ncertain sum is required for the annual engagements and expenditure of\r\nthe country, no wise statesman would abolish any source of revenue,\r\nwithout, at the same time, introducing another equivalent. Our error\r\nhas been abolition without any equivalent at all. It is all very well\r\nto say, that by reducing import duties upon particular articles you\r\nstimulate the power of production: that stimulus may be\r\ngiven--individuals may in consequence be enriched--and yet still there\r\nis a defalcation of revenue. This, however, is the best case which can\r\nbe pointed out for the reduction of duties, and can only apply, in any\r\ndegree, to imports of raw material. The greater part of Sir Robert\r\nPeel's tariff is founded upon a principle directly opposite to this.\r\nHe removed import duties from articles which, so far from stimulating\r\nthe power of production at home, absolutely crushed that power, by\r\nbringing in foreign to supersede British labour. Thus, in both cases,\r\nthere was a sacrifice. In the one there was, at all events, a direct\r\nsacrifice of revenue; in the other, a sacrifice of revenue, and a\r\nsacrifice of labour also. The imposition (and the word is appropriate\r\neither in its plain or its metaphorical meaning) of the property and\r\nincome tax, which gave Sir Robert Peel the power of making his\r\ncommercial experiments, proved inadequate to replace the deficit. The\r\npromised gain was as visionary as the dividends on certain railway\r\nlines projected about the same period, and no new source of national\r\nincome has been opened to supply the loss.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham, no bad judge of human nature, observed the other night,\r\nthat \"such was the extent of the self-conceit of mankind, such the\r\nnature and amount of human frailty, that it became no easy matter to\r\ninduce a nation to retrace its steps.\" People are ever loath to accept\r\nas facts the most pregnant evidences of their own deliberate folly.\r\nPerfectly aware of this metaphysical tendency, we are not surprised\r\nthat, for the last two or three years, every remonstrance against the\r\ndangers of precipitate commercial legislation should have been treated\r\nwith scorn, both by the older advocates of the abolition system, and\r\nby the younger disciples who were converted in a body along with their\r\nmaster. They have been kind enough, over and over again, to entreat\r\nus to relinquish our defence of what they called an antiquated and\r\nworn-out theory. Their supplications on this score have been so\r\ncontinuous as to become absolutely painful; nor could we well\r\nunderstand why and wherefore they should be so very solicitous for our\r\nsilence. Our worst enemies cannot accuse us of advocating any\r\ndangerous innovations: our preachment may be tedious, but, at all\r\nevents, we do not take the field at the head of an organised\r\nassociation. Neither can we be blamed for solitary restiveness, for we\r\ndo not stand alone in the utterance of such opinions. The public press\r\nof this country has nobly fought the battle. We have had to cope with\r\ndexterous and skilled opponents; but never, upon any public question,\r\nhas a great cause been maintained more unflinchingly, more\r\ndisinterestedly, and more ably, than that of the true Conservative\r\nparty by the free Conservative press. We are now glad to see that our\r\ndenunciations of the new system have not been altogether without their\r\neffect. The temporary failure of free trade has been conceded even by\r\nits advocates; but we are referred to accidental causes for that\r\nfailure, and the entreaty now is, to give the system a longer trial.\r\nWe have no manner of objection to this, provided we are not asked to\r\nsubmit to any further experiments. We desire nothing better than that\r\nthe people of Great Britain, be they agriculturists, or be they\r\ntradesmen, should have the opportunity of testing by experience the\r\nblessings of the free-trade system. The first class, indeed, do not\r\nrequire any probationary period of low prices to strengthen their\r\nconviction of the fallacy of the anti-reciprocity system, or of the\r\niniquity of the arrangement which compels them to support the enormous\r\namount of pauperism engendered by the over amount of population,\r\nsystematically encouraged by the manufacturers. \"The manufacturers,\"\r\nsaid Lord Brougham, \"do not, perhaps, tell the world that they\r\nmanufacture other things besides cotton twist; but every one who knew\r\nanything of them, knew that they _manufactured paupers_. Where the\r\nland produced one pauper, manufacturers created half-a-dozen.\" Still\r\nwe can hardly expect to be thoroughly emancipated from the effects of\r\nthe great delusion, until men of every sort and quality are\r\npractically convinced that their interests have been sacrificed to the\r\nselfish objects of a base and sordid confederation. We have no wish to\r\nhark back without occasion, or prematurely, to the corn laws: but, at\r\nthe same time, we are not of the number of those who think that\r\nsubsequent events have justified the wisdom of the measure. If the\r\nloyalty of the people of Great Britain did really rest upon so very\r\nnarrow a point, that, even amidst the rocking and crashing of thrones\r\nand constitutions upon the Continent, ours would have been endangered\r\nby the maintenance of the former law, we should still have reason to\r\ndespair of the ultimate destinies of the country. Are we to understand\r\nthat, in such a case, the Jacobin faction would have had recourse to\r\narms--that the Manchester League would have preached rebellion, or\r\nexcited its adherents to insurrection? If not this, where would have\r\nbeen the danger? Never was any question agitated in which the mass of\r\nthe operatives took less interest than in the repeal of the corn laws.\r\nThey knew well that no benefit was thereby intended to be conferred\r\nupon them--that no philanthropic motives contributed to the erection\r\nof the bazaars--that the millions of popular tracts were poured forth\r\nfrom no cornucopia of popular plenty. The very fact, that the hard and\r\ngriping men of calico were so liberal with their subscriptions to\r\npromote an agrarian change, was sufficient of itself to create a\r\nstrong suspicion in their minds; for when was the purse of the\r\ntaskmaster ever produced, save from a motive of selfish interest? We\r\nwill not do the masses of the British population the foul injustice to\r\nbelieve that, under any circumstances, they would have emulated the\r\nfrantic example of the French. Cobden has not yet the power of his\r\nfriend and correspondent Cremieux: he is a wordy patriot, but nothing\r\nmore; and, even had he been inclined for mischief, we do not believe\r\nthat, beyond the immediate pale of his confederates, any considerable\r\nportion of the nation would readily have rallied round the standard\r\nof such a Gracchus, even though the tricolor stripes had been\r\ndisplayed on a field of the choicest calico.\r\n\r\n\"The corn law is a settled question!\" so shout the free-traders daily,\r\nin high wrath and dudgeon if any one even ventures to allude to\r\nagricultural distress. We grant the fact. It is a settled question,\r\nlike every other which has been decided by the legislature, and it\r\nmust remain a settled question until the legislature chooses to reopen\r\nit. We do not expect any such consummation for a long time. We agree\r\nperfectly with the other party, that it is folly to continue\r\nskirmishing after the battle is over, and we do not propose to adopt\r\nany such tactics. We are content to wait until the experiment is\r\ndeveloped, to see how the system works, and to accept it if it works\r\nwell; but not on that account shall we less oppose the free-traders\r\nwhen they advance to further innovations. The repeal of the corn laws\r\nwas not the whole, but a mere branch of the free-trade policy. It was\r\nundoubtedly the branch more calculated than any other to depress the\r\nagricultural interest, but the trial of it has been postponed longer\r\nthan the free-traders expected. They shall have the benefit of that\r\ncircumstance; nor shall we say one word out of season upon the\r\nsubject. But perhaps, referring again to the Queen's speech, and\r\nselecting this time for our text those paragraphs which stated that\r\n\"commerce is reviving,\" and that \"the condition of the manufacturing\r\ndistricts is likewise more encouraging than it has been for a\r\nconsiderable period,\" we may be allowed to offer a few observations.\r\n\r\nWe do not exactly understand what her Majesty's ministers mean by the\r\nrevival of commerce. This is a general statement which it is very easy\r\nto make, and proportionally difficult to deny. If they mean that our\r\nexports during the last half year have increased, we can understand\r\nthem, and very glad indeed we are to learn that such is the case. For\r\nalthough we have seen of late some elaborate arguments, tending, if\r\nthey have any meaning at all, to show that our imports and not our\r\nexports should be taken as the true measure of the national prosperity,\r\nwe have that faith in the simple rules of arithmetic which forbids us\r\nfrom adopting such reasoning. But our gladness at receiving such a\r\ncheering sentiment from the highest possible authority is a good deal\r\ndamped by the result of the investigations which we have thought it our\r\nduty to make. We have gone over the tables minutely, and we find that\r\nthe exports of the great staples of our industry--cotton, woollen,\r\nsilk, linen, hardware, and earthenware--were of less value than those\r\nof 1847 by FOUR MILLIONS AND A HALF, and less than those of 1846 by a\r\nsum exceeding FIVE MILLIONS AND A HALF. With such a fact before us, can\r\nit be wondered at if we are cautious of receiving such unqualified\r\nstatements, and exceedingly doubtful of the good faith of the men who\r\nmake them?\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, this is not the sense in which ministers understand\r\ncommerce. They are entitled to congratulate the country upon one sort\r\nof improvement, which certainly was not owing to any efforts upon\r\ntheir part. We have at last emerged from the monetary crisis, induced\r\nby the unhappy operation of the Banking Restriction Act, and, in this\r\nway, commerce certainly has improved. The fact that such a change in\r\nthe distribution of the precious metals should have taken place whilst\r\nour exports were steadily declining, is very instructive, because it\r\nclearly demonstrates the false and artificial nature of our present\r\nmonetary system. The consequences, however, may be serious, as the\r\nprice of the British funds cannot now be taken as an index of the\r\nprosperity of the country, either in its agricultural or its\r\nmanufacturing capacity, but has merely relation to the possession of a\r\ncertain quantity of bullion. The rise of the funds, therefore, does\r\nnot impress us with any confidence that there has been a healthy\r\nrevival in the commerce of the country. We cannot consider the\r\nquestion of commerce apart from the condition of the manufacturing\r\ndistricts; and it is to that quarter we must look, in order to test\r\nthe value of the free-trade experiments.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the enormous decrease, during the last three\r\nyears, in the annual amount of our exports. This, coupled with the\r\nimmense increase of imported articles of foreign manufacture, proves\r\nvery clearly that the British manufacturer has as yet derived no\r\nbenefit from the free-trade measures. We do not, of course, mean to\r\nsay that free trade has had any tendency to lessen our exports, though\r\nto cripple the colonies is certainly not the way to augment their\r\ncapabilities of consumption. We merely point to the fact of the\r\ncontinued decrease, even in the staples of British industry, as a\r\nproof of the utter fruitlessness of the attempt to take the markets of\r\nthe world by storm. We are told, indeed, of exceptional causes which\r\nhave interfered with the experiment; but these causes, even allowing\r\nthem their fullest possible operation, are in no way commensurate with\r\nthe results. For be it remarked, that the free-trade measures\r\ncontemplated this result,--that increased imports were to be\r\ncompensated by an enormous augmentation of exports: in other words,\r\nthat we were to meet with perfect reciprocity from every foreign\r\nnation. Now, admitting that exceptional causes existed to check and\r\nrestrain this augmentation, can we magnify these to such an extent as\r\nto explain the phenomenon of a steady and determined fall in our\r\nstaple exports, and that long before the occurrence of civil war or\r\ninsurrection on the continent of Europe? The explanation is just\r\nthis,--the exports fell because the markets abroad were glutted, and\r\nbecause no state is disposed to imitate the suicidal example of\r\nBritain, or to sacrifice its own rising industry for the sake of\r\nencouraging foreigners. What inducement, it may be asked, has any\r\nstate in the world to follow in our wake? Let us take for example\r\nGermany, to whose markets we send annually about six millions and a\r\nhalf of manufactures. Germany has considerable manufactures of her\r\nown, which give employment to a large portion of the population. Would\r\nit be wise in the Germans, for the sake of reducing the price either\r\nof linen, cotton, or woollen goods by an infinitesimal degree, to\r\nthrow all these people idle, and to paralyse labour in every\r\ndepartment, whenever they could be undersold by a foreign artisan?\r\nUndoubtedly not. Germany has nothing whatever to gain by pursuing such\r\na course. The British market is open to her, but she does not on that\r\naccount relax her right of laying duties upon imports from Britain.\r\nShe shelters herself against our competition in her home market,\r\naugments her revenue thereby, and avails herself to the very utmost of\r\nour reduced tariffs, to compete in our country with the artisans of\r\nSheffield and Birmingham. Every new return convinces us more and more\r\nthat commercial interchange is the proper subject of international\r\ntreaty; but that no nation whatever, and certainly not one so heavily\r\nburdened as ours, can hope for prosperity if it opens its ports\r\nwithout the distinct assurance of reciprocity.\r\n\r\nLet us try distinctly to ascertain the real amount of improvement\r\nvisible in the manufacturing districts. In order to do this, we must\r\nturn to the last official tables, which bring down the trade accounts\r\nfrom 5th January to 5th December 1848, being a period of eleven\r\nmonths. We find the following ominous result in the comparison with\r\nthe same period in former years:--\r\n\r\n  _Exports of British Produce and Manufactures from the United Kingdom._\r\n\r\n              1846.          1847.          1848.\r\n\r\n   Total,  £47,579,413   £47,345,354   £42,158,194\r\n\r\nFIVE MILLIONS, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS of decreased exports in\r\neleven months!--and the manufacturing districts are improving!\r\n\r\nLet us see the ratio of decline on some of the principal articles\r\nwhich are the product of these districts. We shall therefore omit such\r\nentries as those of butter, candles, cheese, fish, soap, salt, &c.,\r\nand look to the staples only. The following results we hardly think\r\nwill bear out the somewhat over-confident declaration of the\r\nministry:--\r\n\r\n      _Export of Principal Manufactures from the United Kingdom._\r\n\r\n                               1846.          1847.           1848.\r\n    Cotton manufactures,   £16,276,465    £16,082,313     £15,050,579\r\n      Do. yarn,              7,520,578      5,547,943       5,443,800\r\n    Linen manufactures,      2,553,658      2,690,536       2,475,224\r\n      Do. yarn,                797,640        615,550         440,118\r\n    Silk manufactures,         768,888        912,842         520,427\r\n    Woollen yarn,              858,953        941,158         712,035\r\n      Do. manufactures,      5,852,056      6,424,503       5,198,059\r\n    Earthenware,               742,295        773,786         651,184\r\n    Hardwares and cutlery,   2,004,127      2,138,091       1,669,146\r\n    Glass,                     241,759        272,411         216,464\r\n    Leather,                   307,336        327,715         244,663\r\n    Machinery,               1,050,205      1,186,921         779,759\r\n                           -----------    -----------     -----------\r\n                           £38,973,920    £37,913,769     £33,401,758\r\n\r\nLooking at these tables, we fairly confess that we can see no ground\r\nfor exultation whatever; on the contrary, there is in every article a\r\nmarked and steady decline. Some of the free-trade journals assert\r\nthat, although in the earlier part of the last year there certainly\r\nwas a marked falling off in our exports, yet that the later months\r\nhave almost redeemed the deficiency. That statement is utterly false\r\nand unfounded. In September last, we showed that the exports of the\r\nfirst seven commodities in the above table, exhibited a decline of\r\n£3,177,370, for the six earlier months of the year, as compared with\r\nthe exports in 1847. We continue the account of the same commodities\r\nfor eleven months, and we find the deficiency rated at £3,370,603; so\r\nthat we still have been going down hill, only not quite at so\r\nprecipitate a rate as before. Free-trade, therefore--for which we\r\nsacrificed our revenue, submitted to an income-tax, and ruined our\r\nWest India colonies--has utterly failed to stimulate our exports, the\r\nend which it deliberately proposed.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of exports implies of course a corresponding diminution\r\nof labour. This is a great evil, but one which is beyond the remedy of\r\nthe statesman. You cannot force exports--you cannot compel the foreign\r\nnations to take your goods. We beg attention to the following extract\r\nfrom the speech of Mr D'Israeli, which puts the matter of export upon\r\nits true and substantial basis:--\r\n\r\n     \"Look at your condition with reference to the Brazils. Every\r\n     one recollects the glowing accounts of the late\r\n     Vice-president of the Board of Trade with respect to the\r\n     Brazilian trade--that trade for which you sacrificed your own\r\n     colonies. There is an increase in the trade with the Brazils\r\n     of 26,500,000 of yards in 1846 over 1845; and 18,500,000\r\n     yards in 1847 over 1845; and this increase has so completely\r\n     glutted that market, that goods are selling at Rio and Bahia\r\n     at cost price. It is stated in the _Mercantile Journal_, that\r\n     'It is truly alarming to think what may be the result of a\r\n     continuance of imports, not only in the face of a very\r\n     limited inquiry, but at a period of the year when trade is\r\n     almost always at a stand. Why cargo after cargo of goods\r\n     should be sent hither, is an enigma we cannot solve. Some few\r\n     vessels have yet to arrive; and although trade may probably\r\n     revive in the beginning of 1849, what will become of the\r\n     goods received and to be received? This market cannot consume\r\n     them. Stores, warehouses, and the customhouse are full to\r\n     repletion; and if imports continue upon the same scale as\r\n     heretofore, and sales have to be forced, we may yet have to\r\n     witness the phenomenon of all descriptions of piece goods\r\n     being purchased here below the prime cost in the country of\r\n     production!' Such is the state of matters in these markets;\r\n     and I do not see that your position in Europe is better.\r\n     Russia is still hermetically sealed, and Prussia is not yet\r\n     stricken. I know that there are some who, at this moment,\r\n     think that it is a matter of no consequence how much we may\r\n     export; who say that foreigners will not give their\r\n     productions for nothing, and that, therefore, we must just\r\n     manage things in the most favourable way we can for\r\n     ourselves. There is no doubt that foreigners will not give us\r\n     their goods without some exchange for them; but the question\r\n     which the people of this country are looking at is, to know\r\n     exactly what are the terms of exchange which it is beneficial\r\n     for us to adopt. That is the whole question. You may glut\r\n     markets, as I have shown you have succeeded in doing; but the\r\n     only effect of your system, of your attempting to struggle\r\n     against those hostile tariffs, by opening your ports, is\r\n     that you exchange more of your labour every year and every\r\n     month for a less quantity of foreign labour; that you render\r\n     British labour or native industry less efficient; that you\r\n     degrade British labour--necessarily diminish profits, and,\r\n     therefore, must lower wages; while the first philosophers\r\n     have shown that you will finally effect a change in the\r\n     distribution of the precious metals that must be pernicious\r\n     to this country. It is for these reasons that all practical\r\n     men are impressed with the conviction that you should adopt\r\n     reciprocity as a principle of your commercial tariff--not\r\n     merely from its practical importance, but as an abstract\r\n     truth. This was the principle of the negotiations at Utrecht,\r\n     which was copied by Mr Pitt in his commercial negotiations at\r\n     Paris, which formed the groundwork of the instructions to Mr\r\n     Eden, and which was wisely adopted and upheld by the cabinet\r\n     of Lord Liverpool; but which was deserted, flagrantly, and\r\n     openly, and unwisely, in 1846. There is another reason why\r\n     you can no longer defend your commercial system--you can no\r\n     longer delay considering the state of your colonies. This is\r\n     called an age of principles, and no longer of political\r\n     expedients--you yourselves are the disciples of economy; and\r\n     you have, on every occasion, enunciated it as a principle\r\n     that the colonies of England were an integral part of this\r\n     country. You ought, then, to act towards your colonies on the\r\n     principle you have adopted, but which you have never\r\n     practised. The principle of reciprocity is, in fact, the only\r\n     principle on which you can reconstruct your commercial system\r\n     in a manner beneficial to the mother country and advantageous\r\n     to the colonies. It is, indeed, a great principle, the only\r\n     principle on which a large and expansive system of commerce\r\n     can be founded, so as to be beneficial. The system you are\r\n     pursuing is one quite contrary--you go fighting hostile\r\n     tariffs with fixed imports; and the consequence is that you\r\n     are following a course most injurious to the commerce of the\r\n     country. And every year, at the commencement of the session,\r\n     you come, not to congratulate the House or the country on the\r\n     state of our commerce, but to explain why it suffered, why it\r\n     was prostrate; and you are happy on this occasion to be able\r\n     to say that it is recovering--from what? From unparalleled\r\n     distress.\"\r\n\r\nThe labour market in this country, so far from improving, is, we have\r\nevery reason to believe, in a pitiable state. Let us take the one\r\ninstance of silk manufactures. Of these we exported, during eleven\r\nmonths of last year, an amount to the value of £912,842; this year we\r\nhave only sent out £520,427, or nearly £400,000 less. But this decline\r\ndoes not by any means express the amount of the curtailment of labour\r\nin this important branch of industry. The home market has been\r\ninundated with foreign silks, introduced under the tariffs of 1846,\r\nand that to a degree which is wholly without precedent. Let us see the\r\ncomparative amount of importations.\r\n\r\n                                  1846.         1847.         1848.\r\n  Silk or satin broad stuffs,  115,292 lbs.  147,656 lbs.  269,637 lbs.\r\n  Silk ribbons,                180,375  \"    182,978  \"    217,243  \"\r\n  Gauze or crape broad stuffs,   6,536  \"      5,588  \"      8,243  \"\r\n  Gauze ribbons,                31,307  \"     41,825  \"     49,460  \"\r\n  Gauze mixed,                      18  \"          8  \"         39  \"\r\n  Mixed ribbons,                 1,842  \"      3,094  \"      2,466  \"\r\n  Velvet broad stuffs,          26,798  \"     27,494  \"     29,669  \"\r\n  Velvet embossed ribbons,      13,550  \"     14,192  \"     41,461  \"\r\n                               ------------  ------------  ------------\r\n                               375,718 lbs.  422,835 lbs.  618,218 lbs.\r\n\r\nIs there any commentary required on these figures? We should hope that\r\nno one can be dull enough to misapprehend their import. In one year\r\nour exportation of silk goods has fallen to little more than a half:\r\nin two years our importations from the Continent have nearly doubled.\r\nWhere ninety British labourers worked for the exporting trade, only\r\nfifty are now employed; and if we suppose that the consumpt of silk\r\nmanufactures in this country is the same in 1848 as in 1846, the\r\nfurther amount of labour which has been sacrificed, by the increased\r\nimportations, must be something positively enormous. It is in this way\r\nthat free trade beggars the people and fills the workhouses; whilst,\r\nat the same time, it brings down the national revenue to such an ebb,\r\nthat it is utterly insufficient to balance the necessary expenditure.\r\nIt would be well if politicians would constantly keep in view this one\r\ngreat truth--That of all the burdens which can be laid upon a people,\r\nthe heaviest is the want of employment. No general cheapness, no class\r\naccumulations of wealth, can make up for this terrible want; and the\r\nstatesman who deliberately refuses to recognise this principle, and\r\nwho, from any motive, deprives the working man of his privilege, is an\r\nenemy to the interests of his country.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, and we do not, expect that men who have committed\r\nthemselves so deeply as Mr Cobden has done to the principles of free\r\ntrade in all its branches, should, under any development of\r\ncircumstances, be brought to acknowledge their error. No evidence\r\nhowever overwhelming, no ruin however widely spread, could shake their\r\nfaith, or at any rate diminish the obstinacy of their professions.\r\nThey would rather sacrifice, as indeed they seem bent on doing, the\r\nbest interests of the British empire, than acknowledge the extent of\r\ntheir error. Their motto avowedly is, _vestigia nulla retrorsum_. No\r\nsooner is one interest pulled down than they make a rapid and\r\ndetermined assault upon another, utterly reckless of the misery which\r\nthey have occasioned, and hopelessly deaf even to the warnings of\r\nexperience. They are true destructives; because they feel that they\r\ndare not pause in their career of violence, lest men should have\r\nleisure, to contemplate the ruin already effected, and should ask\r\nthemselves what tangible benefit has been obtained at so terrible a\r\ncost. Mr Cobden knows better than to resume consideration of\r\nfree-trade principles, now that we have seen them in actual operation.\r\nHe is advancing on with his myrmidons towards the Moscow of free\r\ntrade; but, unless we are greatly mistaken, he may have occasion, some\r\nday or other, to revisit his ancient battlefields, but not in the\r\ncapacity of a conqueror. There are, however, others, less deeply\r\npledged, who begin to perceive that in attempting to carry out free\r\ntrade without reciprocity, and in the face of hostile tariffs, we are\r\nruining the trade of Britain for the sole advantage of the foreigner.\r\nMr Muntz, the member for Birmingham, is not at one with ministers as\r\nto the cheerful prospect of the revival among the manufacturers.\r\n\r\n     \"When I came here,\" said he characteristically, \"I heard a\r\n     great deal about the improvement of trade in the country. But\r\n     I went home on Saturday, and there was not a man I met who\r\n     had experienced any of this improvement in trade. On the\r\n     contrary, every one said that trade was flat and\r\n     unprofitable, and that there was no prospect of improvement\r\n     because they were so much competed with by foreign\r\n     manufacturers. This very morning I met with one of my\r\n     travellers, who had just returned from the north of Germany;\r\n     and I asked him what was the state of trade. 'Oh,' said he,\r\n     'there is plenty of trade in Germany, but not trade with\r\n     England. They manufacture goods so cheaply themselves, that,\r\n     at the prices you sell, low as they are, you cannot compete\r\n     with the Germans.' I will tell the House another curious\r\n     thing. About three or four years ago, the glassmakers of\r\n     Birmingham were very anxious for free trade, and, though I\r\n     warned them that I did not think they could compete with\r\n     foreigners, yet they were quite certain they could. Well, I\r\n     introduced them to the minister of the day--the right\r\n     honourable baronet the member of Tamworth--when, to my horror\r\n     and astonishment, they asked, not for free trade, but for\r\n     three years of protection. Why, I said to them, I thought you\r\n     were for free trade? 'Yes,' they replied, 'so we are; but we\r\n     want the three years of protection to prepare us for free\r\n     trade.' Now, on Saturday last, I received a letter from one\r\n     of the leading manufacturers, stating that the import duties\r\n     on flint-glass would expire very soon, and with those duties\r\n     the trade in this country, he feared, was also in great\r\n     danger of expiring, owing to the produce of manufactures\r\n     being admitted duty-free into this country, while they had\r\n     protective duties in their own, thus keeping up the price at\r\n     home by sending over the surplus stock here. The letter\r\n     concluded by requesting that the protective duties, which\r\n     were about to expire, might be renewed. The improvement in\r\n     trade, which was so much talked of, is not an improvement in\r\n     quality, but an improvement in quantity: there are half a\r\n     dozen other trades which have vanished from Birmingham,\r\n     because of the over-competition of the Continent. And,\r\n     strangely enough, the manufactures that have been the most\r\n     injured are those which last week were held up by the public\r\n     press as in a most flourishing condition!\"\r\n\r\nThis statement furnishes ample ground for reflection. The truth is,\r\nthat the whole scheme of free trade was erected and framed, not for\r\nthe purpose of benefiting the manufacturers at the expense of the\r\nlanded interest, but rather to get a monopoly of export for one or\r\ntwo of the leading manufactures of the empire. Those who were engaged\r\nin the cotton and woollen trade, along with some of the iron-masters,\r\nwere at the head of the movement. No influx of foreign manufactured\r\nproduce could by possibility swamp _them_ in the home market, for they\r\nare not exposed to that competition with which the smaller trades must\r\nstruggle. The Germans will take shirtings, but they will not now take\r\ncutlery from us. The articles which they produce are certainly not so\r\ngood as ours, but they are cheaper, and protected, and it is even\r\nworth their while to compete with us in the home markets of Britain.\r\nThe same may be said of the trade in brass, gloves, shoes, hats,\r\nearthenware, porcelain, and fifty others. They are not now exporting\r\ntrades, and at home, under the new tariffs, we are completely\r\nundersold by the foreigners. As for the glass trade, no one who is\r\nacquainted with the present state of that manufacture on the\r\nContinent, can expect that it will ever again recover. This, in\r\nreality, is the cause of the present depression; and until this is\r\nthoroughly understood by the tradesmen who are suffering, there can be\r\nno improvement for the better. What advantage, we ask, can it be to a\r\nman who finds his profits disappearing, his trade reduced to\r\nstagnation, and his capability of giving employment absolutely\r\nannihilated, to know that, in consequence of some sudden impulse,\r\ntwenty million additional yards of calico have been exported from\r\nGreat Britain? The glass-blower, the brazier, and the cutler, have not\r\nthe remotest interest in calico. They may think, indeed, that part of\r\nthe profit so secured may be indirectly advantageous in the purchase\r\nof their wares, but they find themselves lamentably mistaken. The\r\nastute calico-master sells his wares to the foreigner abroad, and he\r\npurchases with equal disinterestedness from the manufacturing\r\nforeigner at home. This is the whole tendency of free trade, and it is\r\namazing to us that the juggle should find any supporters amongst the\r\nclass who are its actual victims. If they look soberly and\r\ndeliberately into the matter, they cannot fail to see that the\r\nadoption by the state of the maxim, to sell in the dearest and buy in\r\nthe cheapest market, more especially when that market is the home one,\r\nand when cheapness has been superinduced by the introduction of\r\nforeign labour, must end in the consummation of their ruin. Can we\r\nreally believe in the assertion of ministers, that manufactures are\r\nimproving, when we find, on all hands, such pregnant assurances to the\r\ncontrary? For example, there was a meeting held in St James's, so late\r\nas the 11th of January, \"to consider the unprecedented number of\r\nunemployed mechanics and workmen now in the metropolis, and to devise\r\nthe best means for diminishing their privations and sufferings, by\r\nproviding them with employment.\" Mr Lushington, M.P. for Westminster,\r\na thorough-paced liberal, moved the first resolution, the tendency of\r\nwhich was towards the institution of soup kitchens, upon this\r\npreamble, \"that the number of operatives, mechanics, and labourers now\r\nthrown out of employment is unusually great, and the consequent\r\ndestitution and distress which exist on all sides are painfully\r\nexcessive, and deeply alarming.\" And yet, Mr Lushington, like many of\r\nhis class and stamp, can penetrate no deeper into the causes of\r\ndistress, than is exhibited in the following paragraph of his\r\nspeech:--\"The great majority of those whose cases they were now met to\r\nconsider, were the victims of misfortune, and not of crime, and, on\r\nthat account, they had a legitimate claim upon their sympathy and\r\ncommiseration. But private sympathy was impotent to grapple with the\r\ngigantic evil with which they had to contend; isolated efforts and\r\nvoluntary alms-giving were but a mere drop in the ocean, compared with\r\nthe remedy that the case demanded. They must go further and deeper for\r\ntheir remedy; and the only efficacious one that could effectually be\r\nbrought to bear upon the miseries of the people, was the reduction of\r\nthe national expenditure--the cutting down of the army, navy, and\r\nordnance estimates, and the removal of those taxes that pressed so\r\nheavily upon the poorer portions of the community.\" This is about as\r\nfine a specimen of unadulterated senatorial drivel as we ever had the\r\ngood fortune to meet with; and it may serve as an apt illustration of\r\nthe absurd style of argument so commonly employed by the members of\r\nthe free-trade party. Suppose that the army were disbanded to-morrow,\r\nand all the sailors in the navy paid off, how would that give\r\nemployment to the unfortunate poor? Nay, would it not materially\r\ncontribute to increase the tide of pauperism, since no economist has\r\nas yet condescended to explain what sort of employment is to be given\r\nto the disbanded? As to the taxes spoken of by Mr Lushington, what are\r\nthey? We really cannot comprehend the meaning of this illustrious\r\nrepresentative of an enlightened constituency. Supposing there was not\r\na single tax levied in Britain to-morrow, how would that arrangement\r\nbetter the condition of the people, who are simply starving because\r\nthey can get no manner of work whatever? It is this silly but\r\nmischievous babbling, these false and illogical conclusions enunciated\r\nby men who either do not understand what they are saying, or who,\r\nunderstanding it, are unfit for the station which they occupy, which\r\ntend more than anything else to spread disaffection among the lower\r\norders, to impress them with the idea that they are unjustly dealt\r\nwith, and to stimulate them in their periodical outcry for organic\r\nchanges. The remedy lies in restoring to the labouring man those\r\nprivileges of which he has been insidiously robbed by the operation of\r\nthe free-trade measures. It lies in returning to the system which\r\nsecured a full revenue to the nation, whilst, at the same time, it\r\nprevented the minor trades from being swamped by foreign competition.\r\nIt lies in refusing to allow one class of the community to extinguish\r\nothers, and to throw the burden of the pauperism which it creates upon\r\nthe landed interest, already contending with enormous difficulties.\r\nUntil this be done, it is in vain to expect any real improvement in\r\nthe condition of the working-classes. Each successive branch of\r\nindustry that is pulled down, under the operation of the new system,\r\nadds largely to the mass of accumulating misery; and the longer the\r\nexperiment is continued, the greater will be the permanent injury to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nNot the least evil resulting from the free-trade agitation is the\r\nselfishness and division of classes which it has studiously\r\nendeavoured to promote. So long as the agriculturists alone were\r\nmenaced, the whole body of the manufacturers were against them. The\r\ntariffs of 1846 struck at the small traders and artisans, and the\r\nmerchants looked on with indifference. Now the question relates to the\r\nNavigation Laws, and the shipmasters of Britain complain that they\r\ncannot rouse the nation to a sense of the meditated wrong. Every one\r\nhas been ready to advocate free trade in every branch save that with\r\nwhich he was personally connected; and it is this shortsighted policy\r\nwhich has given such power to the assailing party. Deeply do we\r\ndeplore the folly as well as the wickedness of such divisions. No\r\nnation can ever hope to prosper through the prosperity of one class\r\nalone. It is not the wealth of individuals which gives stability to a\r\nstate, but the fair distribution of profitable labour throughout the\r\nwhole of the community. In contending for the support of the\r\nNavigation Laws, we are not advocating the cause of the shipmasters,\r\nbut that of the nation; and yet we feel that if the principle of free\r\ntrade be once fully admitted, no exception can be made, even in this\r\nvital point. If we intend to retain our colonies, we must do justice\r\nto them one way or another. We cannot deprive them of the advantages\r\nwhich they formerly enjoyed from their connexion with the parent\r\ncountry, and yet subject them to a burden of this kind, even although\r\nwe hold that burden necessary for the effectual maintenance of our\r\nmarine. We await the decision of this matter in parliament with very\r\ngreat anxiety indeed, because we look upon the adoption or the\r\nrejection of Mr Labouchere's bill as the index to our future policy.\r\nIf it receives the royal assent, we must perforce prepare for organic\r\nchanges far greater than this country has ever yet experienced. The\r\ncolonies may still, indeed, be considered as portions of the British\r\nempire, but hardly worth the cost of retention. Free trade will have\r\ndone its work. The excise duties cannot be suffered to continue, for\r\nthey too, according to the modern idea, are oppressive and unjust; and\r\nthe period, thus foreshadowed by Mr Cobden at the late Manchester\r\nbanquet, will rapidly arrive: \"It is not merely protective duties that\r\nare getting out of favour in this country; but, however strong or weak\r\nit may be at present, still there is firmly and rapidly growing an\r\nopinion decidedly opposed, _not merely to duties for protection, but\r\nto duties for revenue at all_. I venture to say you will not live to\r\nsee another statesman in England propose any customs-duty on a raw\r\nmaterial or article of first necessity like corn. I question whether\r\nany statesman who has any regard for his future fame will ever propose\r\nanother excise or customs-duty at all.\" The whole revenue will then\r\nfall to be collected directly: and how long the national creditor will\r\nbe able to maintain his claim against direct taxation is a problem\r\nwhich we decline to solve. The land of Great Britain, like that of\r\nIreland, will be worthless to its owner, and left to satisfy the\r\nclaims of pauperism; and America, wiser than the old country, will\r\nbecome to the middle classes the harbour of refuge and of peace.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that these things will happen, because we have faith\r\nin the sound sterling sense of Englishmen, and in the destinies of\r\nthis noble country. We are satisfied that the time is rapidly\r\napproaching when a thorough reconstruction of our whole commercial and\r\nfinancial policy will be imperatively demanded from the government--a\r\ntask which the present occupants of office are notoriously incapable\r\nof undertaking, but which must be carried through by some efficient\r\ncabinet. Such a measure cannot be introduced piecemeal after the\r\ndestructive fashion, but must be based upon clear and comprehensive\r\nprinciples, doing justice to all classes of the community, and showing\r\nundue favour to none.\r\n\r\nOur observations have already extended to such a length, that we have\r\nlittle room to speak of that everlasting topic, Ireland. \"Ireland,\"\r\nsays Lord John Russell, \"is undergoing a great transition.\" This is\r\nindeed news, and we shall be glad to learn the particulars so soon as\r\nconvenient. Perhaps the transition may be explained before the\r\ncommittee, to which, as usual, Whig helplessness and imbecility has\r\nreferred the whole question of Irish distress. The confidence of the\r\nWhigs in the patience of the people of this country must be boundless,\r\nelse they would hardly have ventured again to resort to so stale an\r\nexpedient. It is easy to devolve the whole duties of government upon\r\ncommittees, but we are very much mistaken if such trifling will be\r\nlonger endured. As to the distress in Ireland, it is fully admitted.\r\nWhenever the bulk of a nation is so demoralised as to prefer living on\r\nalms to honest labour, distress is the inevitable consequence; and the\r\nonly way to cure the habit is carefully to withhold the alms.\r\nMinisters think otherwise, and they have carried a present grant of\r\nfifty thousand pounds from the imperial exchequer, which may serve for\r\na week or so, when doubtless another application will be tabled. This\r\nis neither more nor less than downright robbery of the British people\r\nunder the name of charity. Ireland must in future be left to depend\r\nentirely upon her own resources; situated as we are, it would be\r\nmadness to support her further; and we hope that every constituency\r\nthroughout the United Kingdom will keep a watchful eye on the conduct\r\npursued by their representatives in the event of any attempt at\r\nfurther spoliation. From all the evidence before us, it appears that\r\nour former liberality has been thrown away. Not only was no gratitude\r\nshown for the enormous advances of last year, but the money was\r\nrecklessly squandered and misapplied, no doubt in the full and\r\nconfident expectation of continued remittances. And here we beg to\r\nsuggest to honourable members from the other side of the Channel,\r\nwhether it might not be well to consider what effect free trade has\r\nhad in ameliorating the condition of Ireland. If on inquiry at\r\nLiverpool they should chance to find that pork is now imported direct\r\nfrom America, not only salted, but fresh and preserved in ice, and\r\nthat in such quantities and at so low a rate as seriously to affect\r\nthe sale of the Irish produce, perhaps patriotism may operate in\r\ntheir minds that conviction which reasoning would not effect. If also\r\nthey should chance to learn that butter and dairy produce can no\r\nlonger command a remunerative price, owing to the increased imports\r\nboth from America and the Continent, they will have made one further\r\nstep towards the science of political economy, and may form some\r\nuseful calculations as to the prospect of future rentals. Should they,\r\nhowever, still be of opinion that the interests of the Irish people\r\nare inseparably bound up with the continuance of free trade--that\r\nneither prices nor useful labour are matters of any consequence--they\r\nmust also bear in mind that they can no longer be allowed to intromit\r\nwith the public purse of Britain. The Whigs may indeed, and probably\r\nwill, make one other vigorous effort to secure their votes; but no\r\nparty in this nation is now disposed to sanction such iniquitous\r\nproceedings, and all of us will so far respond to the call for\r\neconomy, as sternly to refuse alms to an indolent and ungrateful\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we shall merely remark that we look forward with much\r\ninterest to the financial exposition of the year, in the hope that it\r\nmay be more intelligible and satisfactory than the last. We shall then\r\nunderstand the nature and the amount of the reductions which have been\r\nannounced under such extraordinary circumstances, and the state of the\r\nrevenue will inform those who feel themselves oppressed by excise\r\nduties, of the chances of reduction in that quarter. Meanwhile we\r\ncannot refrain from expressing our gratitude to both Lord Stanley and\r\nMr D'Israeli for their masterly expositions of the weak and\r\nvacillating policy pursued by the Whig government abroad, and of the\r\nfalse colour which was attempted to be thrown upon the state and\r\nprospect of industry at home. Deeply as we lamented the premature\r\ndecease of Lord George Bentinck at the very time when the value of his\r\npublic service, keen understanding, and high and exalted principle,\r\nwas daily becoming more and more appreciated by the country, we are\r\nrejoiced to know that his example has not been in vain; that his noble\r\nand philanthropic spirit still lives in the councils of those who have\r\nthe welfare of the British people at heart, and who are resolute not\r\nto yield to the pressure of a base democracy, actuated by the meanest\r\nof personal motives, unscrupulous as to the means which it employs,\r\nimpervious to reason, and utterly reckless of consequences, provided\r\nit may attain its end. Against that democracy which has elsewhere not\r\nonly shattered constitutions but prostrated society, a determined\r\nstand will be made; and our heartfelt prayer is, that the cause of\r\ntruth may prevail.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[32] We find that we have given the leaguers rather too much credit in\r\nthe above paragraph. Some of them appear to think that, whether\r\nnecessary or not, our forces should be dispensed with; at least so we\r\ngather from the following expressions contained in a dull ill-written\r\ntract, purporting to emanate from the \"Edinburgh Financial Reform\r\nAssociation,\" which has just come into our hands. Let us hear the\r\npatriotic economists. \"If there be any other cause for maintaining a\r\nhuge and expensive force, it must be found in the desire to provide\r\nfor the scions of the nobility and landed gentry, with a view to\r\nsecure votes in both houses of parliament. As is well known,\r\ncommissions in the army and navy are held almost entirely by these\r\nclasses. No doubt, officers in active service may be said to give work\r\nfor their pay, while their gallantry as soldiers is beyond dispute;\r\nbut this, unfortunately, does not mend the matter. Their services we\r\nhold to be for the greater part unnecessary; _at all events, they are\r\nservices for which the nation cannot afford to pay any longer, and\r\nthey_ THEREFORE _ought to be relinquished_.\" This is intelligible\r\nenough; but we hardly think there are many reasoners of this calibre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors have been repaired.
