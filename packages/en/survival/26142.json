Examination of Peat with regard to its Value as Fuel            167\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the years 1857 and 1858, the writer, in the capacity of Chemist to\r\nthe State Agricultural Society of Connecticut, was commissioned to make\r\ninvestigations into the agricultural uses of the deposits of peat or\r\nswamp muck which are abundant in this State; and, in 1858, he submitted\r\na Report to Henry A. Dyer, Esq., Corresponding Secretary of the Society,\r\nembodying his conclusions. In the present work the valuable portions of\r\nthat Report have been recast, and, with addition of much new matter,\r\nform Parts I. and II. The remainder of the book, relating to the\r\npreparation and employment of peat for fuel, &c., is now for the first\r\ntime published, and is intended to give a faithful account of the\r\nresults of the experience that has been acquired in Europe, during the\r\nlast twenty-five years, in regard to the important subject of which it\r\ntreats.\r\n\r\nThe employment of peat as an amendment and absorbent for agricultural\r\npurposes has proved to be of great advantage in New-England farming.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be doubted, that, as fuel, it will be even more valuable\r\nthan as a fertilizer. Our peat-beds, while they do not occupy so much\r\nterritory as to be an impediment and a reproach to our country, as they\r\nhave been to Ireland, are yet so abundant and so widely\r\ndistributed--occurring from the Atlantic to the Missouri, along and\r\nabove the 40th parallel, and appearing on our Eastern Coast at least as\r\nfar South as North Carolina[1]--as to present, at numberless points,\r\nmaterial, which, sooner or later, will serve us most usefully when other\r\nfuel has become scarce and costly.\r\n\r\nThe high prices which coal and wood have commanded for several years\r\nback have directed attention to peat fuel; and, such is the adventurous\r\ncharacter of American enterprise, it cannot be doubted that we shall\r\nrapidly develop and improve the machinery for producing it. As has\r\nalways been the case, we shall waste a vast deal of time and money in\r\ncontriving machines that violate every principle of mechanism and of\r\neconomy; but the results of European invention furnish a safe basis from\r\nwhich to set out, and we have among us the genius and the patience that\r\nshall work out the perfect method.\r\n\r\nIt may well be urged that a good degree of caution is advisable in\r\nentering upon the peat enterprise. In this country we have exhaustless\r\nmines of the best coal, which can be afforded at a very low rate, with\r\nwhich other fuel must compete. In Germany, where the best methods of\r\nworking peat have originated, fuel is more costly than here; and a\r\nuniversal and intense economy there prevails, of which we, as a people,\r\nhave no conception.\r\n\r\nIf, as the Germans themselves admit, the peat question there is still a\r\nnice one as regards the test of dollars and cents, it is obvious, that,\r\nfor a time, we must \"hasten slowly.\" It is circumstances that make peat,\r\nand gold as well, remunerative or otherwise; and these must be well\r\nconsidered in each individual case. Peat is the name for a material that\r\nvaries extremely in its quality, and this quality should be investigated\r\ncarefully before going to work upon general deductions.\r\n\r\nIn my account of the various processes for working peat by machinery,\r\nsuch data as I have been able to find have been given as to cost of\r\nproduction. These data are however very imperfect, and not altogether\r\ntrustworthy, in direct application to American conditions. The cheapness\r\nof labor in Europe is an item to our disadvantage in interpreting\r\nforeign estimates. I incline to the belief that this is more than offset\r\namong us by the quality of our labor, by the energy of our\r\nadministration, by the efficiency of our overseeing, and, especially, by\r\nour greater skill in the adaptation of mechanical appliances. While\r\ncounselling caution, I also recommend enterprise in developing our\r\nresources in this important particular; knowing full well, however, that\r\nwhat I can say in its favor will scarcely add to the impulse already\r\napparent among my countrymen.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL W. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n_Sheffield Scientific School_,}\r\n_Yale College, June, 1866._   }\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The great Dismal Swamp is a grand peat bog, and doubtless other of\r\nthe swamps of the coast, as far south as Florida and the Gulf, are of\r\nthe same character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN, VARIETIES, AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERS\r\nOF PEAT.\r\n\r\n1. _What is Peat?_\r\n\r\nBy the general term Peat, we understand the organic matter or vegetable\r\nsoil of bogs, swamps, beaver-meadows and salt-marshes.\r\n\r\nIt consists of substances that have resulted from the decay of many\r\ngenerations of aquatic or marsh plants, as mosses, sedges, coarse\r\ngrasses, and a great variety of shrubs, mixed with more or less mineral\r\nsubstances, derived from these plants, or in many cases blown or washed\r\nin from the surrounding lands.\r\n\r\n2. _The conditions under which Peat is formed._\r\n\r\nIn this country the production of Peat from fallen and decaying plants,\r\ndepends upon the presence of so much water as to cover or saturate the\r\nvegetable matters, and thereby hinder the full access of air. Saturation\r\nwith water also has the effect to maintain the decaying matters at a\r\nlow temperature, and by these two causes in combination, the process of\r\ndecay is made to proceed with great slowness, and the solid products of\r\nsuch slow decay, are compounds that themselves resist decay, and hence\r\nthey accumulate.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there appears to be nothing like the extensive\r\n_moors_ or _heaths_, that abound in Ireland, Scotland, the north of\r\nEngland, North Germany, Holland, and the elevated plains of Bavaria,\r\nwhich are mostly level or gently sloping tracts of country, covered with\r\npeat or turf to a depth often of 20, and sometimes of 40, or more, feet.\r\nIn this country it is only in low places, where streams become\r\nobstructed and form swamps, or in bays and inlets on salt water, where\r\nthe flow of the tide furnishes the requisite moisture, that our\r\npeat-beds occur. If we go north-east as far as Anticosti, Labrador, or\r\nNewfoundland, we find true moors. In these regions have been found a few\r\nlocalities of the _Heather_ (_Calluna vulgaris_), which is so\r\nconspicuous a plant on the moors of Europe, but which is wanting in the\r\npeat-beds of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the countries above named, the weather is more uniform than here, the\r\nair is more moist, and the excessive heat of our summers is scarcely\r\nknown. Such is the greater humidity of the atmosphere that the\r\nbog-mosses,--the so-called _Sphagnums_,--which have a wonderful avidity\r\nfor moisture, (hence used for packing plants which require to be kept\r\nmoist on journeys), are able to keep fresh and in growth during the\r\nentire summer. These mosses decay below, and throw out new vegetation\r\nabove, and thus produce a bog, especially wherever the earth is springy.\r\nIt is in this way that in those countries, moors and peat-bogs actually\r\ngrow, increasing in depth and area, from year to year, and raise\r\nthemselves above the level of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nProf. Marsh informs the writer that he has seen in Ireland, near the\r\nnorth-west coast, a granite hill, capped with a peat-bed, several feet\r\nin thickness. In the Bavarian highlands similar cases have been\r\nobserved, in localities where the atmosphere and the ground are kept\r\nmoist enough for the growth of moss by the extraordinary prevalence of\r\nfogs. Many of the European moors rise more or less above the level of\r\ntheir borders towards the centre, often to a height of 10 or 20 and\r\nsometimes of 30 feet. They are hence known in Germany as _high_ moors\r\n(_Hochmoore_) to distinguish from the level or dishing _meadow-moors_,\r\n(_Wiesenmoore_). The peat-producing vegetation of the former is chiefly\r\nmoss and heather, of the latter coarse grasses and sedges.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the reclamation of a moor is usually an expensive\r\noperation, for which not only much draining, but actual cutting out and\r\nburning of the compact peat is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe warmth of our summers and the dryness of our atmosphere prevent the\r\naccumulation of peat above the highest level of the standing water of\r\nour marshes, and so soon as the marshes are well drained, the peat\r\nceases to form, and in most cases the swamp may be easily converted into\r\ngood meadow land.\r\n\r\nSpringy hill-sides, which in cooler, moister climates would become\r\nmoors, here dry up in summer to such an extent that no peat can be\r\nformed upon them.\r\n\r\nAs already observed, our peat is found in low places. In many instances\r\nits accumulation began by the obstruction of a stream. To that\r\nremarkable creature, the beaver, we owe many of our peat-bogs. These\r\nanimals, from time immemorial, have built their dams across rivers so as\r\nto flood the adjacent forest. In the rich leaf-mold at the water's\r\nverge, and in the cool shade of the standing trees, has begun the growth\r\nof the sphagnums, sedges, and various purely aquatic plants. These in\r\ntheir annual decay have shortly filled the shallow borders of the\r\nstagnating water, and by slow encroachments, going on through many\r\nyears, they have occupied the deeper portions, aided by the trees,\r\nwhich, perishing, give their fallen branches and trunks, towards\r\ncompleting the work. The trees decay and fall, and become entirely\r\nconverted into peat; or, as not unfrequently happens, especially in case\r\nof resinous woods, preserve their form, and to some extent their\r\nsoundness.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, ponds and lakes are encroached upon; or, if\r\nshallow, entirely filled up by peat deposits. In the Great Forest of\r\nNorthern New York, the voyager has abundant opportunity to observe the\r\nformation of peat-swamps, both as a result of beaver dams, and of the\r\nfilling of shallow ponds, or the narrowing of level river courses. The\r\nformation of peat in water of some depth greatly depends upon the growth\r\nof aquatic plants, other than those already mentioned. In our Eastern\r\nStates the most conspicuous are the Arrow-head, (_Sagittaria_); the\r\nPickerel Weed, (_Pontederia_;) Duck Meat, (_Lemna_;) Pond Weed,\r\n(_Potamogeton_;) various _Polygonums_, brothers of Buckwheat and\r\nSmart-weed; and especially the Pond Lilies, _(Nymphoea_ and _Nuphar_.)\r\nThe latter grow in water four or five feet deep, their leaves and long\r\nstems are thick and fleshy, and their roots, which fill the oozy mud,\r\nare often several inches in diameter. Their decaying leaves and stems,\r\nand their huge roots, living or dead, accumulate below and gradually\r\nraise the bed of the pond. Their living foliage which often covers the\r\nwater almost completely for acres, becomes a shelter or support for\r\nother more delicate aquatic plants and sphagnums, which, creeping out\r\nfrom the shore, may so develop as to form a floating carpet, whereon the\r\nleaves of the neighboring wood, and dust scattered by the wind collect,\r\nbearing down the mass, which again increases above, or is reproduced\r\nuntil the water is filled to its bottom with vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nIt is not rare to find in our bogs, patches of moss of considerable area\r\nconcealing deep water with a treacherous appearance of solidity, as the\r\nhunter and botanist have often found to their cost. In countries of more\r\nhumid atmosphere, they are more common and attain greater dimensions. In\r\nZealand the surfaces of ponds are so frequently covered with floating\r\nbeds of moss, often stout enough to bear a man, that they have there\r\nreceived a special name \"_Hangesak_.\" In the Russian Ural, there occur\r\nlakes whose floating covers of moss often extend five or six feet above\r\nthe water, and are so firm that roads are made across them, and forests\r\nof large fir-trees find support. These immense accumulations are in fact\r\nfloating moors, consisting entirely of peat, save the living vegetation\r\nat the surface.\r\n\r\nSometimes these floating peat-beds, bearing trees, are separated by\r\nwinds from their connection with the shore, and become swimming peat\r\nislands. In a small lake near Eisenach, in Central Germany, is a\r\nswimming island of this sort. Its diameter is 40 rods, and it consists\r\nof a felt-like mass of peat, three to five feet in depth, covered above\r\nby sphagnums and a great variety of aquatic plants. A few birches and\r\ndwarf firs grow in this peat, binding it together by their roots, and\r\nwhen the wind blows, they act as sails, so that the island is constantly\r\nmoving about upon the lake.\r\n\r\nOn the Neusiedler lake, in Hungary, is said to float a peat island\r\nhaving an area of six square miles, and on lakes of the high Mexican\r\nPlateau are similar islands which, long ago, were converted in fruitful\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n3. _The different kinds of Peat._\r\n\r\nVery great differences in the characters of the deposits in our\r\npeat-beds are observable. These differences are partly of color, some\r\npeats being gray, others red, others again black; the majority, when\r\ndry, possess a dark brown-red or snuff color. They also vary remarkably\r\nin weight and consistency. Some are compact, destitute of fibres or\r\nother traces of the vegetation from which they have been derived, and on\r\ndrying, shrink greatly and yield tough dense masses which burn readily,\r\nand make an excellent fuel. Others again are light and porous, and\r\nremain so on drying; these contain intermixed vegetable matter that is\r\nbut little advanced in the peaty decomposition. Some peats are almost\r\nentirely free from mineral matters, and on burning, leave but a few _per\r\ncent._ of ash, others contain considerable quantities of lime or iron,\r\nin chemical combination, or of sand and clay that have been washed in\r\nfrom the hills adjoining the swamps. As has been observed, the peat of\r\nsome swamps is mostly derived from mosses, that of others originates\r\nlargely from grasses; some contain much decayed wood and leaves, others\r\nagain are free from these.\r\n\r\nIn the same swamp we usually observe more or less of all these\r\ndifferences. We find the surface peat is light and full of partly\r\ndecayed vegetation, while below, the deposits are more compact. We\r\ncommonly can trace distinct strata or layers of peat, which are often\r\nvery unlike each other in appearance and quality, and in some cases the\r\nlight and compact layers alternate so that the former are found below\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nThe light and porous kinds of peat appear in general to be formed in\r\nshallow swamps or on the surface of bogs, where there is considerable\r\naccess of air to the decaying matters, while the compacter, older, riper\r\npeats are found at a depth, and seem to have been formed beneath the\r\nlow water mark, in more complete exclusion of the atmosphere, and under\r\na considerable degree of pressure.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the vegetation that flourishes in a bog, has much effect\r\non the character of the peat. The peats chiefly derived from mosses that\r\nhave grown in the full sunlight, have a yellowish-red color in their\r\nupper layers, which usually becomes darker as we go down, running\r\nthrough all shades of brown until at a considerable depth it is black.\r\nPeats produced principally from grasses are grayish in appearance at the\r\nsurface, being full of silvery fibres--the skeletons of the blades of\r\ngrasses and sedges, while below they are commonly black.\r\n\r\n_Moss peat_ is more often fibrous in structure, and when dried forms\r\nsomewhat elastic masses. _Grass peat_, when taken a little below the\r\nsurface, is commonly destitute of fibres; when wet, is earthy in its\r\nlook, and dries to dense hard lumps.\r\n\r\nWhere mosses and grasses have grown together simultaneously in the same\r\nswamp, the peat is modified in its characters accordingly. Where, as may\r\nhappen, grass succeeds moss, or moss succeeds grass, the different\r\nlayers reveal their origin by their color and texture. At considerable\r\ndepths, however, where the peat is very old, these differences nearly or\r\nentirely disappear.\r\n\r\nThe geological character of a country is not without influence on the\r\nkind of peat. It is only in regions where the rocks are granitic or\r\nsilicious, where, at least, the surface waters are free or nearly free\r\nfrom lime, that _mosses_ make the bulk of the peat.\r\n\r\nIn limestone districts, peat is chiefly formed from _grasses_ and\r\n_sedges_.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that mosses (sphagnums) need little lime for\r\ntheir growth, while the grasses require much; aquatic grasses cannot,\r\ntherefore, thrive in pure waters, and in waters containing the requisite\r\nproportion of lime, grasses and sedges choke out the moss.\r\n\r\nThe accidental admixtures of soil often greatly affect the appearance\r\nand value of a peat, but on the whole it would appear that its quality\r\nis most influenced by the degree of decomposition it has been subjected\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIn meadows and marshes, overflowed by the ocean tides, we have\r\n_salt-peat_, formed from Sea-weeds (_Algae_,) Salt-wort (_Salicornia_,)\r\nand a great variety of marine or strand-plants. In its upper portions,\r\nsalt-peat is coarsely fibrous from the grass roots, and dark-brown in\r\ncolor. At sufficient depth it is black and destitute of fibres.\r\n\r\nThe fact that peat is fibrous in texture shows that it is of\r\ncomparatively recent formation, or that the decomposition has been\r\narrested before reaching its later stages. Fibrous peat is found near\r\nthe surface, and as we dig down into a very deep bed we find almost\r\ninvariably that the fibrous structure becomes less and less evident\r\nuntil at a certain depth it entirely disappears.\r\n\r\nIt is not depth simply, but age or advancement in decomposition, which\r\ndetermines these differences of texture.\r\n\r\nThe \"ripest,\" most perfectly formed peat, that in which the peaty\r\ndecomposition has reached its last stage,--which, in Germany, is termed\r\n_pitchy-peat_ or _fat peat_, (_Pechtorf_, _Specktorf_)--is dark-brown or\r\nblack in color, and comparatively heavy and dense. When moist, it is\r\nfirm, sticky and coherent almost like clay, may be cut and moulded to\r\nany shape. Dried, it becomes hard, and on a cut or burnished surface\r\ntakes a luster like wax or pitch.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, West Friesland, Holstein, Denmark and Pomerania, a so-called\r\n_mud-peat_ (_Schlammtorf_, also _Baggertorf_ and _Streichtorf_,) is\r\n\"fished up\" from the bottoms of ponds, as a black mud or paste, which,\r\non drying, becomes hard and dense like the pitchy-peat.\r\n\r\nThe two varieties of peat last named are those which are most prized as\r\nfuel in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Vitriol peat_ is peat of any kind impregnated with sulphate of iron\r\n(_copperas_,) and sulphate of alumina, (the astringent ingredient of\r\nalum.)\r\n\r\n_Swamp Muck._--In New England, the vegetable remains occurring in\r\nswamps, etc., are commonly called _Muck_. In proper English usage, muck\r\nis a general term for manure of any sort, and has no special application\r\nto the contents of bogs. With us, however, this meaning appears to be\r\nquite obsolete, though in our agricultural literature--formerly, more\r\nthan now, it must be admitted,--the word as applied to the subject of\r\nour treatise, has been qualified as _Swamp Muck_.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, peat of whatever character, is designated by the single word\r\n_Torf_; in France it is _Tourbe_, and of the same origin is the word\r\n_Turf_, applied to it in Great Britain. With us turf appears never to\r\nhave had this signification.\r\n\r\nPeat, no doubt, is a correct name for the substance which results from\r\nthe decomposition of vegetable matters under or saturated with water,\r\nwhatever its appearance or properties. There is, however, with us, an\r\ninclination to apply this word particularly to those purer and more\r\ncompact sorts which are adapted for fuel, while to the lighter, less\r\ndecomposed or more weathered kinds, and to those which are considerably\r\nintermixed with soil or silt, the term muck or swamp muck is given.\r\nThese distinctions are not, indeed, always observed, and, in fact, so\r\ngreat is the range of variation in the quality of the substance, that it\r\nwould be impossible to draw a line where muck leaves off and peat\r\nbegins. Notwithstanding, a rough distinction is better than none, and\r\nwe shall therefore employ the two terms when any greater clearness of\r\nmeaning can be thereby conveyed.\r\n\r\nIt happens, that in New England, the number of small shallow swales,\r\nthat contain unripe or impure peat, is much greater than that of large\r\nand deep bogs. Their contents are therefore more of the \"mucky\" than of\r\nthe \"peaty\" order, and this may partly account for New England usage in\r\nregard to these old English words.\r\n\r\nBy the term muck, some farmers understand leaf-mold (decayed leaves),\r\nespecially that which collects in low and wet places. When the deposit\r\nis deep and saturated with water, it may have all the essential\r\ncharacters of peat. Ripe peat, from such a source is, however, so far as\r\nthe writer is informed, unknown to any extent in this country. We might\r\ndistinguish as _leaf-muck_ the leaves which have decomposed under or\r\nsaturated with water, retaining the well established term leaf-mold to\r\ndesignate the dry or drier covering of the soil in a dense forest of\r\ndeciduous trees.\r\n\r\n_Salt-mud._--In the marshes, bays, and estuaries along the sea-shore,\r\naccumulate large quantities of fine silt, brought down by rivers or\r\ndeposited from the sea-water, which are more or less mixed with finely\r\ndivided peat or partly decomposed vegetable matters, derived largely\r\nfrom Sea-weed, and in many cases also with animal remains (mussels and\r\nother shell-fish, crabs, and myriads of minute organisms.) This black\r\nmud has great value as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\n4. _The Chemical Characters and Composition of Peat._\r\n\r\nThe process of burning, demonstrates that peat consists of two kinds of\r\nsubstance; one of which, the larger portion, is combustible, and is\r\n_organic_ or vegetable matter; the other, smaller portion, remaining\r\nindestructible by fire is _inorganic matter_ or _ash_. We shall consider\r\nthese separately.\r\n\r\na. _The organic or combustible part of peat_ varies considerably in its\r\nproximate composition. It is in fact an indefinite mixture of several or\r\nperhaps of many compound bodies, whose precise nature is little known.\r\nThese bodies have received the collective names _Humus_ and _Geine_. We\r\nshall employ the term _humus_ to designate this mixture, whether\r\noccurring in peat, swamp-muck, salt-mud, in composts, or in the arable\r\nsoil. Its chemical characters are much the same, whatever its appearance\r\nor mode of occurrence; and this is to be expected since it is always\r\nformed from the same materials and under essentially similar conditions.\r\n\r\n_Resinous_ and _Bituminous matters_.--If dry pulverized peat be agitated\r\nand warmed for a short time with alcohol, there is usually extracted a\r\nsmall amount of _resinous_ and sometimes of _bituminous_ matters, which\r\nare of no account in the agricultural applications of peat, but have a\r\nbearing on its value as fuel.\r\n\r\n_Ulmic_ and _Humic acids_.--On boiling what remains from the treatment\r\nwith alcohol, with a weak solution of carbonate of soda (sal-soda), we\r\nobtain a yellowish-brown or black liquid. This liquid contains certain\r\nacid ingredients of the peat which become soluble by entering into\r\nchemical combination with soda.\r\n\r\nOn adding to the solution strong vinegar, or any other strong acid,\r\nthere separates a bulky brown or black substance, which, after a time,\r\nsubsides to the bottom of the vessel as a precipitate, to use a chemical\r\nterm, leaving the liquid of a more or less yellow tinge. This deposit,\r\nif obtained from light brown peat, is _ulmic acid_; if from black peat,\r\nit is _humic acid_. These acids, when in the precipitated state, are\r\ninsoluble in vinegar; but when this is washed away, they are\r\nconsiderably soluble in water. They are, in fact, modified by the action\r\nof the soda, so as to acquire much greater solubility in water than they\r\notherwise possess. On drying the bulky bodies thus obtained, brown or\r\nblack lustrous masses result, which have much the appearance of coal.\r\n\r\n_Ulmin_ and _Humin_.--After extracting the peat with solution of\r\ncarbonate of soda, it still contains ulmin or humin. These bodies cannot\r\nbe obtained in the pure state from peat, since they are mixed with more\r\nor less partially decomposed vegetable matters from which they cannot be\r\nseparated without suffering chemical change. They have been procured,\r\nhowever, by the action of muriatic acid on sugar. They are indifferent\r\nin their chemical characters, are insoluble in water and in solution of\r\ncarbonate of soda; but upon heating with solution of hydrate of soda\r\nthey give dark-colored liquids, being in fact converted by this\r\ntreatment into ulmic and humic acids, respectively, with which they are\r\nidentical in composition.\r\n\r\nThe terms ulmic and humic acids do not refer each to a single compound,\r\nbut rather to a group of bodies of closely similar appearance and\r\nproperties, which, however, do differ slightly in their characteristics,\r\nand differ also in composition by containing more or less of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen in equal equivalents.\r\n\r\nAfter complete extraction with hydrate of soda, there remains more or\r\nless undecomposed vegetable matter, together with sand and soil, were\r\nthese contained in the peat.\r\n\r\n_Crenic_ and _apocrenic acids_.--From the usually yellowish liquid out\r\nof which the ulmic and humic acids have been separated, may further be\r\nprocured by appropriate chemical means, not needful to be detailed\r\nhere, two other bodies which bear the names respectively of _Crenic\r\nAcid_ and _Apocrenic Acid_. These acids were discovered by Berzelius,\r\nthe great Swedish chemist, in the water and sediment of the Porla\r\nspring, in Sweden.\r\n\r\nBy the action upon peat of carbonate of ammonia, which is generated to\r\nsome extent in the decay of vegetable matters and is also absorbed from\r\nthe air, ulmic and humic acids are made soluble, and combine with the\r\nammonia as well as with lime, oxide of iron, etc. In some cases the\r\nulmates and humates thus produced may be extracted from the peat by\r\nwater, and consequently occur dissolved in the water of the swamp from\r\nwhich the peat is taken, giving it a yellow or brown color.\r\n\r\n_Ulmates_ and _Humates_.--Of considerable interest to us here, are the\r\nproperties of the compounds of these acids, that may be formed in peat\r\nwhen it is used as an ingredient of composts. The ulmates and humates of\r\nthe alkalies, viz.: _potash_, _soda_, and _ammonia_, dissolve readily in\r\nwater. They are formed when the alkalies or their carbonates act on\r\nulmin and humin, or upon ulmates or humates of lime, iron, etc. Their\r\ndilute solutions are yellow, or brown.\r\n\r\nThe ulmates and humates of _lime_, _magnesia_, oxide of _iron_, oxide of\r\n_manganese_ and _alumina_, are insoluble, or nearly so in water.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary soils, the earths and oxides just named, predominate over\r\nthe alkalies, and although they may contain considerable ulmic and humic\r\nacids, water is able to extract but very minute quantities of the\r\nlatter, on account of the insolubility of the compounds they have\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, peat, highly manured garden soil, leaf-mold, rotted\r\nmanure and composts, yield yellow or brown extracts with water, from the\r\nfact that alkalies are here present to form soluble compounds.\r\n\r\nAn important fact established by Mulder is, that when solutions of\r\nalkali-carbonates are put in contact with the insoluble ulmates and\r\nhumates, the latter are decomposed; soluble alkali-ulmates and humates\r\nbeing formed, and _in these, a portion of the otherwise insoluble\r\nulmates and humates dissolve_, so that thus, in a compost, lime,\r\nmagnesia, oxide of iron, and even alumina may exist in soluble\r\ncombinations, by the agency of these acids.\r\n\r\n_Crenates_ and _Apocrenates_.--The ulmic and humic acids when separated\r\nfrom their compounds, are nearly insoluble, and, so far as we know,\r\ncomparatively inert bodies; by further change, (uniting with oxygen)\r\nthey pass into or yield the crenic and apocrenic acids which, according\r\nto Mulder, have an acid taste, being freely soluble in water, and in all\r\nrespects, decided acids. The compounds of both these acids with the\r\nalkalies are soluble. The crenates of lime, magnesia, and protoxide of\r\niron are soluble, crenates of peroxide of iron and of oxide of manganese\r\nare but very slightly soluble; crenate of alumina is insoluble. The\r\napocrenates of iron and manganese are slightly soluble; those of lime,\r\nmagnesia, and alumina are insoluble. All the insoluble crenates and\r\napocrenates, are soluble in solutions of the corresponding salts of the\r\nalkalies.\r\n\r\nApplication of these facts will be given in subsequent paragraphs. It\r\nmay be here remarked, that the crenate of protoxide of iron is not\r\nunfrequently formed in considerable quantity in peat-bogs, and\r\ndissolving in the water of springs gives them a chalybeate character.\r\nCopious springs of this kind occur at the edge of a peat-bed at\r\nWoodstock, Conn., which are in no small repute for their medicinal\r\nqualities, having a tonic effect from the iron they contain. Such\r\nwaters, on exposure to the air, shortly absorb oxygen, and the substance\r\nis thereby converted into crenate and afterwards into apocrenate of\r\nperoxide of iron, which, being but slightly soluble, or insoluble,\r\nseparates as a yellow or brown ochreous deposit along the course of the\r\nwater. By further exposure to air the organic acid is oxidized to\r\ncarbonic acid, and hydrated oxide of iron remains. Bog-iron ore appears\r\noften to have originated in this way.\r\n\r\n_Gein and Geic acid._--Mulder formerly believed another substance to\r\nexist in peat which he called _Gein_, and from this by the action of\r\nalkalies he supposed geic acid to be formed. In his later writings,\r\nhowever, he expresses doubt as to the existence of such a substance,\r\nand we may omit further notice of it, especially since, if it really\r\ndo occur, its properties are not distinct from those of humic acid.\r\n\r\nWe should not neglect to remark, however, that the word gein has been\r\nemployed by some writers in the sense in which we use humus, viz.: to\r\ndenote the brown or black products of the decomposition of vegetable\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be doubted that other organic compounds exist in peat.\r\nAs yet, however, we have no knowledge of any other ingredients, while it\r\nappears certain that those we have described are its chief constituents,\r\nand give it its peculiar properties. With regard to them it must\r\nnevertheless be admitted, that our chemical knowledge is not entirely\r\nsatisfactory, and new investigations are urgently demanded to supply the\r\ndeficiencies of the researches so ably made by Mulder, more than twenty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n_Elementary Composition of Peat._\r\n\r\nAfter this brief notice of those organic _compounds_ that have been\r\nrecognized in or produced from peat, we may give attention to the\r\nelementary composition of peat itself.\r\n\r\nLike that of the vegetation from which it originates, the organic part\r\nof peat consists of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen. In the\r\nsubjoined table are given the proportions of these elements as found in\r\nthe combustible part of sphagnum, of several kinds of wood, and in that\r\nof a number of peats in various stages of ripeness.

Further, it\r\nis seen from analyses 1 and 5, that in the first stages of the\r\nconversion of sphagnum into peat--which are marked by a change of color,\r\nbut in which the form of the sphagnum is to a considerable extent\r\npreserved--but little alteration occurs in ultimate composition; about\r\none _per cent._ of carbon being gained, and one of hydrogen lost. We\r\nnotice in running down the columns that as the peat becomes heavier and\r\ndarker in color, it also becomes richer in carbon and poorer in oxygen.\r\nHydrogen varies but slightly.\r\n\r\nAs a general statement we may say that the ripest and heaviest peat\r\ncontains 10 or 12 _per cent._ more carbon and 10 or 12 _per cent._ less\r\noxygen than the vegetable matter from which it is produced; while\r\nbetween the unaltered vegetation and the last stage of humification, the\r\npeat runs through an indefinite number of intermediate stages.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is variable, but, in general, the older peats contain the most.\r\nTo this topic we shall shortly recur, and now pass on to notice--\r\n\r\n_The ultimate composition of the compounds of which peat consists._\r\n\r\nBelow are tabulated analyses of the organic acids of peat:--\r\n\r\n                                     _Carbon._  _Hydrogen._  _Oxygen._\r\n Ulmic acid, artificial from sugar     67.10       4.20        28.70\r\n Humic acid, from Frisian peat         61.10       4.30        34.60\r\n Crenic acid                           56.47       2.74        40.78\r\n Apocrenic acid                        45.70       4.80        49.50\r\n\r\nIt is seen that the amount of carbon diminishes from ulmic acid to\r\napocrenic, that of oxygen increases in the same direction and to the\r\nsame extent, viz.: about 21 _per cent._, while the hydrogen remains\r\nnearly the same in all.\r\n\r\nb. _The mineral part of peat, which remains as ashes_ when the organic\r\nmatters are burned away, is variable in quantity and composition.\r\nUsually a portion of sand or soil is found in it, and this not\r\nunfrequently constitutes its larger portion. Some peats leave on burning\r\nmuch carbonate of lime; others chiefly sulphate of lime; the ash of\r\nothers again is mostly oxyd of iron; silicic, and phosphoric acids,\r\nmagnesia, potash, soda, alumina and chlorine, also occur in small\r\nquantities in the ash of all peats.\r\n\r\nWith one exception (alumina) all these bodies are important ingredients\r\nof agricultural plants.\r\n\r\nIn some rare instances, peats are found, which are so impregnated with\r\nsoluble sulphates of iron and alumina, as to yield these salts to water\r\nin large quantity; and sulphate of iron (green vitriol,) has actually\r\nbeen manufactured from such peats, which in consequence have been\r\ncharacterized as _vitriol peats_.\r\n\r\nThose bases (lime, oxide of iron, etc.,) which are found as carbonates\r\nor simple oxides in the ashes, exist in the peat itself in combination\r\nwith the humic and other organic acids. When these compounds are\r\ndestroyed by burning, the bases remain united to carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n5.--_Chemical Changes that occur in the formation of Peat._ When a plant\r\nperishes, its conversion into humus usually begins at once. When exposed\r\nto the atmosphere, the oxygen of the air attacks it, uniting with its\r\ncarbon producing carbonic acid gas, and with its hydrogen generating\r\nwater. This action goes on, though slowly, even at some depth under\r\nwater, because the latter dissolves oxygen from the air in small\r\nquantity,[2] and constantly resupplies itself as rapidly as the gas is\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\nWhether exposed to the air or not, the organic matter suffers internal\r\ndecomposition, and portions of its elements assume the gaseous or liquid\r\nform. We have seen that ripe peat is 10 to 12 _per cent._ richer in\r\ncarbon and equally poorer in oxygen, than the vegetable matters from\r\nwhich it originates. Organic matters, in passing into peat, lose carbon\r\nand nitrogen; but they lose oxygen more rapidly than the other two\r\nelements, and hence the latter become relatively more abundant. The loss\r\nof hydrogen is such that its proportion to the other elements is but\r\nlittle altered.\r\n\r\nThe bodies that separate from the decomposing vegetable matter are\r\ncarbonic acid gas, carburetted hydrogen (marsh gas), nitrogen gas, and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid is the most abundant gaseous product of the peaty\r\ndecomposition. Since it contains nearly 73 _per cent._ of oxygen and but\r\n27 _per cent._ of carbon, it is obvious that by its escape the\r\nproportion of carbon in the residual mass is increased. In the formation\r\nof water from the decaying matters, 1 part of hydrogen carries off 8\r\nparts of oxygen, and this change increases the proportion of carbon and\r\nof hydrogen. Marsh gas consists of one part of hydrogen to three of\r\ncarbon, but it is evolved in comparatively small quantity, and hence has\r\nno effect in diminishing the _per cent._ of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe gas that bubbles up through the water of a peat-bog, especially if\r\nthe decomposing matters at the bottom be stirred, consists largely of\r\nmarsh gas and nitrogen, often with but a small proportion of carbonic\r\nacid. Thus Websky found in gas from a peat-bed\r\n\r\n Carbonic acid     2.97\r\n Marsh gas        43.36\r\n Nitrogen         53.67\r\n                 ------\r\n                 100.00\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid, however, dissolves to a considerable extent in water, and\r\nis furthermore absorbed by the living vegetation, which is not true of\r\nmarsh gas and nitrogen; hence the latter escape while the former does\r\nnot. Nitrogen escapes in the uncombined state, as it always (or usually)\r\ndoes in the decay of vegetable and animal matters that contain it. Its\r\nloss is, in general, slower than that of the other elements, and it\r\nsometimes accumulates in the peat in considerable quantity. A small\r\nportion of nitrogen unites with hydrogen, forming ammonia, which remains\r\ncombined with the humic and other acids.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nON THE AGRICULTURAL USES OF PEAT AND\r\nSWAMP MUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing account of the composition of peat, we may proceed\r\nto notice:\r\n\r\n1.--_The characters that adapt it for agricultural uses._\r\n\r\nThese characters are conveniently discussed under two heads, viz.:\r\n\r\nThose which render it useful in improving the texture and physical\r\ncharacters of the soil, and indirectly contribute to the nourishment of\r\ncrops,--characters which constitute it an _amendment_ to the soil (_A_);\r\nand\r\n\r\nThose which make it a direct _fertilizer_ (_B_).\r\n\r\nA.--Considered as an amendment, the value of peat depends upon\r\n\r\n_Its remarkable power of absorbing and retaining water, both as a liquid\r\nand as a vapor_ (I):\r\n\r\n_Its power of absorbing ammonia_ (II):\r\n\r\n_Its effect in promoting the disintegration and solution of mineral\r\ningredients, that is the stony matters of the soil_ (III): _and_\r\n\r\n_Its influence on the temperature of the soil_ (IV).\r\n\r\nThe agricultural importance of these properties of peat is best\r\nillustrated by considering the faults of a certain class of soils.\r\n\r\nThroughout the State of Connecticut, for instance, are found abundant\r\nexamples of light, leachy, hungry soils, which consist of coarse sand or\r\nfine gravel; are surface-dry in a few hours after the heaviest rains,\r\nand in the summer drouths, are as dry as an ash-heap to a depth of\r\nseveral or many feet.\r\n\r\nThese soils are easy to work, are ready for the plow early in the\r\nspring, and if well manured give fair crops in wet seasons. In a dry\r\nsummer, however, they yield poorly, or fail of crops entirely; and, at\r\nthe best, they require constant and very heavy manuring to keep them in\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nCrops fail on these soils from two causes, viz.; _want of moisture_ and\r\n_want of food_. Cultivated plants demand as an indispensable condition\r\nof their growth and perfection, to be supplied with water in certain\r\nquantities, which differ with different crops. Buckwheat will flourish\r\nbest on dry soils, while cranberries and rice grow in swamps.\r\n\r\nOur ordinary cereal, root, forage and garden crops require a medium\r\ndegree of moisture, and with us it is in all cases desirable that the\r\nsoil be equally protected from excess of water and from drouth. Soils\r\nmust be thus situated either naturally, or as the result of improvement,\r\nbefore any steadily good results can be obtained in their cultivation.\r\nThe remedy for excess of water in too heavy soils, is thorough drainage.\r\nIt is expensive, but effectual. It makes the earth more porous, opens\r\nand maintains channels, through which the surplus water speedily runs\r\noff, and permits the roots of crops to go down to a considerable depth.\r\n\r\nWhat, let us consider, is the means of obviating the defects of soils\r\nthat are naturally too porous, from which the water runs off too\r\nreadily, and whose crops \"burn up\" in dry seasons?\r\n\r\nIn wet summers, these light soils, as we have remarked, are quite\r\nproductive if well manured. It is then plain that if we could add\r\nanything to them which would retain the moisture of dews and rains in\r\nspite of the summer-heats, our crops would be uniformly fair, provided\r\nthe supply of manure were kept up.\r\n\r\nBut why is it that light soils, need more manure than loamy or heavy\r\nlands? We answer--because, in the first place the rains which quickly\r\ndescend through the open soil, wash down out of the reach of vegetation\r\nthe soluble fertilizing matters, especially the nitrates, for which the\r\nsoil has no retentive power; and in the second place, from the porosity\r\nof the soil, the air has too great access, so that the vegetable and\r\nanimal matters of manures decay too rapidly, their volatile portions,\r\nammonia and carbonic acid, escape into the atmosphere, and are in\r\nmeasure lost to the crops. From these combined causes we find that a\r\nheavy dressing of well-rotted stable manure, almost if not entirely,\r\ndisappears from such soils in one season, so that another year the field\r\nrequires a renewed application; while on loamy soils the same amount of\r\nmanure would have lasted several years, and produced each year a better\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nWe want then to _amend_ light soils by incorporating with them something\r\nthat prevents the rains from leaching through them too rapidly, and also\r\nthat renders them less open to the air, or absorbs and retains for the\r\nuse of crops the volatile products of the decay of manures.\r\n\r\nFor these purposes, vegetable matter of some sort is the best and almost\r\nthe only amendment that can be economically employed. In many cases a\r\ngood peat or muck is the best form of this material, that lies at the\r\nfarmer's command.\r\n\r\nI.--_Its absorbent power for liquid water_ is well known to every farmer\r\nwho has thrown it up in a pile to season for use. It holds the water\r\nlike a sponge, and, according to its greater or less porosity, will\r\nretain from 50 to 100 or more _per cent._ of its weight of liquid,\r\nwithout dripping. Nor can this water escape from it rapidly. It dries\r\nalmost as slowly as clay, and a heap of it that has been exposed to sun\r\nand wind for a whole summer, though it has of course lost much water, is\r\nstill distinctly wet to the eye and the feel a little below the surface.\r\n\r\n_Its absorbent power for vapor of water_ is so great that more than once\r\nit has happened in Germany, that barns or close sheds filled with\r\npartially dried peat, such as is used for fuel, have been burst by the\r\nswelling of the peat in damp weather, occasioned by the absorption of\r\nmoisture from the air. This power is further shown by the fact that when\r\npeat has been kept all summer long in a warm room, thinly spread out to\r\nthe air, and has become like dry snuff to the feel, it still contains\r\nfrom 8 to 30 _per cent._ (average 15 _per cent._) of water. To dry a\r\npeat thoroughly, it requires to be exposed for some time to the\r\ntemperature of boiling water. It is thus plain, as experience has\r\nrepeatedly demonstrated, that no ordinary summer heats can dry up a soil\r\nwhich has had a good dressing of this material, for on the one hand, it\r\nsoaks up and holds the rains that fall upon it, and on the other, it\r\nabsorbs the vapor of water out of the atmosphere whenever it is moist,\r\nas at night and in cloudy weather.\r\n\r\nWhen peat has once become _air-dry_, it no longer manifests this avidity\r\nfor water. In drying it shrinks, loses its porosity and requires long\r\nsoaking to saturate it again. In the soil, however, it rarely becomes\r\nair-dry, unless indeed, this may happen during long drouth with a peaty\r\nsoil, such as results from the draining of a bog.\r\n\r\nII.--_Absorbent power for ammonia._\r\n\r\nAll soils that deserve to be called fertile, have the property of\r\nabsorbing and retaining ammonia and the volatile matters which escape\r\nfrom fermenting manures, but light and coarse soils may be deficient in\r\nthis power. Here again in respect to its absorptive power for ammonia,\r\npeat comes to our aid.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show by direct experiment that peat absorbs and combines\r\nwith ammonia.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 I took a weighed quantity of air-dry peat from the New Haven\r\nBeaver Pond, (a specimen furnished me by Chauncey Goodyear, Esq.,) and\r\npoured upon it a known quantity of dilute solution of ammonia, and\r\nagitated the two together occasionally during 48 hours. I then distilled\r\noff at a boiling heat the unabsorbed ammonia and determined its\r\nquantity. This amount subtracted from that of the ammonia originally\r\nemployed, gave the quantity of ammonia absorbed and retained by the peat\r\nat the temperature of boiling water.\r\n\r\nThe peat retained ammonia to the amount of 0.95 of _one per cent._\r\n\r\nI made another trial at the same time with carbonate of ammonia, adding\r\nexcess of solution of this salt to a quantity of peat, and exposing it\r\nto the heat of boiling water, until no smell of ammonia was perceptible.\r\nThe entire nitrogen in the peat was then determined, and it was found\r\nthat the dry peat which originally contained nitrogen equivalent to 2.4\r\n_per cent._ of ammonia, now yielded an amount corresponding to 3.7 _per\r\ncent._ The quantity of ammonia absorbed and retained at a temperature\r\nof 212 deg., was thus 1.3 _per cent._\r\n\r\nThis last experiment most nearly represents the true power of\r\nabsorption; because, in fermenting manures, ammonia mostly occurs in the\r\nform of carbonate, and this is more largely retained than free ammonia,\r\non account of its power of decomposing the humate of lime, forming with\r\nit carbonate of lime and humate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe absorbent power of peat is well shown by the analyses of three\r\nspecimens, sent me in 1858, by Edwin Hoyt, Esq., of New Canaan, Conn.\r\nThe first of these was the swamp muck he employed. It contained in the\r\nair-dry state nitrogen equivalent to 0.58 _per cent._ of ammonia. The\r\nsecond sample was the same muck that had lain under the flooring of the\r\nhorse stables, and had been, in this way, partially saturated with\r\nurine. It contained nitrogen equivalent to 1.15 _per cent._ of ammonia.\r\nThe third sample was, finally, the same muck composted with white-fish.\r\nIt contained nitrogen corresponding to 1.31 _per cent._ of ammonia.[3]\r\n\r\nThe quantities of ammonia thus absorbed, both in the laboratory and\r\nfield experiments are small--from 0.7 to 1.3 _per cent._ The absorption\r\nis without doubt chiefly due to the organic matter of the peats, and in\r\nall the specimens on which these trials were made, the proportion of\r\ninorganic matter is large. The results therefore become a better\r\nexpression of the power of _peat_, in general, to absorb ammonia, if we\r\nreckon them on the organic matter alone. Calculated in this way, the\r\norganic matter of the Beaver Pond peat (which constitutes but 68 _per\r\ncent._ of the dry peat) absorbs 1.4 _per cent._ of free ammonia, and 1.9\r\n_per cent._ of ammonia out of the carbonate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nSimilar experiments, by Anderson, on a Scotch peat, showed it to\r\npossess, when wet, an absorptive power of 2 _per cent._, and, after\r\ndrying in the air, it still retained 1.5 _per cent._--[Trans. Highland\r\nand Ag'l Soc'y.]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider how small an ingredient of most manures nitrogen is,\r\nviz.: from one-half to three-quarters of one _per cent._ in case of\r\nstable manure, and how little of it, in the shape of guano for instance,\r\nis usually applied to crops--not more than 40 to 60 lbs. to the acre,\r\n(the usual dressings with guano are from 250 to 400 lbs. per acre, and\r\nnitrogen averages but 15 _per cent._ of the guano), we at once perceive\r\nthat an absorptive power of one or even one-half _per cent._ is greatly\r\nmore than adequate for every agricultural purpose.\r\n\r\nIII.--_Peat promotes the disintegration of the soil._\r\n\r\nThe soil is a storehouse of food for crops; the stores it contains are,\r\nhowever, only partly available for immediate use. In fact, by far the\r\nlarger share is locked up, as it were, in insoluble combinations, and\r\nonly by a slow and gradual change can it become accessible to the plant.\r\nThis change is largely brought about by the united action of _water_ and\r\n_carbonic acid gas_. Nearly all the rocks and minerals out of which\r\nfertile soils are formed,--which therefore contain those inorganic\r\nmatters that are essential to vegetable growth,--though very slowly\r\nacted on by pure water, are decomposed and dissolved to a much greater\r\nextent by water, charged with carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nIt is by these solvents that the formation of soil from broken rocks is\r\nto a great extent due. Clay is invariably a result of their direct\r\naction upon rocks. The efficiency of the soil depends greatly upon their\r\nchemical influence.\r\n\r\n_The only abundant source of carbonic acid in the soil, is decaying\r\nvegetable matter._\r\n\r\nHungry, leachy soils, from their deficiency of vegetable matter and of\r\nmoisture, do not adequately yield their own native resources to the\r\nsupport of crops, because the conditions for converting their fixed into\r\nfloating capital are wanting. Such soils dressed with peat or green\r\nmanured, at once acquire the power of retaining water, and keep that\r\nwater ever charged with carbonic acid: thus not only the extraneous\r\nmanures which the farmer applies are fully economized; but the soil\r\nbecomes more productive from its own stores of fertility which now begin\r\nto be unlocked and available.\r\n\r\nDr. Peters, of Saxony, has made some instructive experiments that are\r\nhere in point. He filled several large glass jars, (2-1/2 feet high and\r\n5-1/2 inches wide) with a rather poor loamy sand, containing\r\nconsiderable humus, and planted in each one, June 14, 1857, an equal\r\nnumber of seeds of oats and peas. Jar No. 2 had daily passed into it\r\nthrough a tube, adapted to the bottom, about 3-1/4 pints of common air.\r\nNo. 3 received daily the same bulk of a mixture of air and carbonic acid\r\ngas, of which the latter amounted to one-fourth. No. 1 remained without\r\nany treatment of this kind, _i. e._: in just the condition of the soil\r\nin an open field, having no air in its pores, save that penetrating it\r\nfrom the atmosphere. On October 3, the plants were removed from the\r\nsoil, and after drying at the boiling point of water, were weighed. The\r\ncrops from the pots into which air and carbonic acid were daily forced,\r\nwere about _twice as heavy_ as No. 1, which remained in the ordinary\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nExamination of the soil further demonstrated, that in the last two\r\nsoils, a considerably greater quantity of mineral and organic matters\r\nhad become soluble in water, than in the soil that was not artificially\r\naerated. The actual results are given in the table below in grammes, and\r\nrefer to 6000 grammes of soil in each case:--\r\n\r\n ACTION OF CARBONIC ACID ON THE SOIL.\r\n -----------------------------------+-----------+--------+------------\r\n                                    |  _No. 1,  |        |\r\n                                    |  Without  |_No. 2, |  _No. 3,\r\n _Substances soluble in water, etc._| Artificial| Common |  Air and\r\n                                    | Supply of |  Air   |  Carbonic\r\n                                    |   Air._   | Added._|acid added._\r\n -----------------------------------+-----------+--------+------------\r\n Mineral matters                    |    2.04   |  3.71  |    4.99\r\n Potash                             |    0.07   |  0.17  |    0.14\r\n Soda                               |    0.17   |  0.23  |    0.28\r\n Organic matters                    |    2.76   |  4.32  |    2.43\r\n                                    |           |        |\r\n Weight of Crops                    |    5.89   | 10.49  |   12.35\r\n -----------------------------------+-----------+--------+------------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that air alone exercised nearly as much\r\nsolvent effect as the mixture of air with one-fourth its weight of\r\ncarbonic acid; this is doubtless, in part due to the fact that the air,\r\nupon entering the soil rich in humus, caused the abundant formation of\r\ncarbonic acid, as will be presently shown must have been the case. It\r\nis, however, probable that organic acids (crenic and apocrenic,) and\r\nnitric acid were also produced (by oxidation,) and shared with carbonic\r\nthe work of solution.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain, that the acids of peat exert a powerful\r\ndecomposing, and ultimately solvent effect on the minerals of the soil;\r\nbut on this point we have no precise information, and must therefore be\r\ncontent merely to present the probability. This is sustained by the fact\r\nthat the crenic, apocrenic and humic acids, though often partly\r\nuncombined, are never wholly so, but usually occur united in part to\r\nvarious bases, viz.: lime, magnesia, ammonia, potash, alumina and oxide\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\nThe crenic and apocrenic acids (that are formed by the oxidation of\r\nulmic and humic acids,) have such decided acid characters,--crenic acid\r\nespecially, which has a strongly sour taste--that we cannot well doubt\r\ntheir dissolving action.\r\n\r\nIV.--_The influence of peat on the temperature_ of light soils dressed\r\nwith it may often be of considerable practical importance. A light dry\r\nsoil is subject to great variations of temperature, and rapidly follows\r\nthe changes of the atmosphere from cold to hot, and from hot to cold. In\r\nthe summer noon a sandy soil becomes so warm as to be hardly endurable\r\nto the feel, and again it is on such soils that the earliest frosts take\r\neffect. If a soil thus subject to extremes of temperature have a dressing\r\nof peat, it will on the one hand not become so warm in the hot day, and\r\non the other hand it will not cool so rapidly, nor so much in the night;\r\nits temperature will be rendered more uniform, and on the whole, more\r\nconducive to the welfare of vegetation. This regulative effect on\r\ntemperature is partly due to the stores of water held by peat. In a hot\r\nday this water is constantly evaporating, and this, as all know, is a\r\ncooling process. At night the peat absorbs vapor of water from the air,\r\nand condenses it within its pores, this condensation is again accompanied\r\nwith the evolution of heat.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a general, though not invariable fact, that dark\r\ncolored soils, other things being equal, are constantly the warmest, or\r\nat any rate maintain the temperature most favorable to vegetation. It\r\nhas been repeatedly observed that on light-colored soils plants mature\r\nmore rapidly, if the earth be thinly covered with a coating of some\r\nblack substance. Thus Lampadius, Professor in the School of Mines at\r\nFreiberg, a town situated in a mountainous part of Saxony, found that he\r\ncould ripen melons, even in the coolest summers, by strewing a coating\r\nof coal-dust an inch deep over the surface of the soil. In some of the\r\nvineyards of the Rhine, the powder of a black slate is employed to\r\nhasten the ripening of the grape.\r\n\r\nGirardin, an eminent French agriculturist, in a series of experiments on\r\nthe cultivation of potatoes, found that the time of their ripening\r\nvaried eight to fourteen days, according to the character of the soil.\r\nHe found, on the 25th of August, in a very dark soil, made so by the\r\npresence of much humus or decaying vegetable matter, twenty-six\r\nvarieties ripe; in sandy soil but twenty, in clay nineteen, and in a\r\nwhite lime soil only sixteen.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted then, that the effect of dressing a light sandy or\r\ngravelly soil with peat, or otherwise enriching it in vegetable matter,\r\nis to render it warmer, in the sense in which that word is usually\r\napplied to soils. The upward range of the thermometer is not, indeed,\r\nincreased, but the uniform warmth so salutary to our most valued crops\r\nis thereby secured.\r\n\r\nIn the light soils stable-manure wastes too rapidly because, for one\r\nreason, at the extremes of high temperature, oxidation and decay proceed\r\nwith great rapidity, and the volatile portions of the fertilizer are\r\nused up faster than the plant can appropriate them, so that not only are\r\nthey wasted during the early periods of growth, but they are wanting at\r\na later period when their absence may prove the failure of a crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The ingredients and qualities which make peat _a direct fertilizer_\r\nnext come under discussion. We shall notice:\r\n\r\n_The organic matters including nitrogen (ammonia and nitric acid)_ (I):\r\n\r\n_The inorganic or mineral ingredients_ (II):\r\n\r\n_Peculiarities in the decay of Peat_ (III), _and_\r\n\r\n_Institute a comparison between peat and stable manure_ (IV).\r\n\r\nI.--Under this division we have to consider:\r\n\r\n1. _The organic matters as direct food to plants._\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, when Chemistry and Vegetable Physiology began to be\r\napplied to Agriculture, the opinion was firmly held among scientific\r\nmen, that the organic parts of humus--by which we understand decayed\r\nvegetable matter, such as is found to a greater or less extent in all\r\ngood soils, and _abounds_ in many fertile ones, such as constitutes the\r\nleaf-mold of forests, such as is produced in the fermenting of stable\r\nmanure, and that forms the principal part of swamp-muck and peat,--are\r\nthe true nourishment of vegetation, at any rate of the higher orders of\r\nplants, those which supply food to man and to domestic animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Liebig, in his celebrated treatise on the \"Applications of\r\nChemistry to Agriculture and Physiology,\" gave as his opinion that these\r\norganic bodies do not nourish vegetation except by the products of their\r\ndecay. He asserted that they cannot enter the plant directly, but that\r\nthe water, carbonic acid and ammonia resulting from their decay, are the\r\nsubstances actually imbibed by plants, and from these alone is built up\r\nthe organic or combustible part of vegetation.\r\n\r\nTo this day there is a division of opinion among scientific men on this\r\nsubject, some adopting the views of Liebig, others maintaining that\r\ncertain soluble organic matters, viz., crenic and apocrenic acids are\r\nproper food of plants.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand it has been abundantly demonstrated that these organic\r\nmatters are not at all essential to the growth of agricultural plants,\r\nand can constitute but a small part of the actual food of vegetation\r\ntaken in the aggregate.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we are acquainted with no satisfactory evidence that\r\nthe soluble organic matters of the soil and of peat, especially the\r\ncrenates and apocrenates, are not actually appropriated by, and, so far\r\nas they go, are not directly serviceable as food to plants.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, practice has abundantly demonstrated the value of\r\nhumus as an ingredient of the soil, and if not directly, yet indirectly,\r\nit furnishes the material out of which plants build up their parts.\r\n\r\n2. _The organic matters of peat as indirect food to plants._ Very nearly\r\none-half, by weight, of our common crops, when perfectly dry, consists\r\nof _carbon_. The substance which supplies this element to plants is the\r\ngas, carbonic acid. Plants derive this gas mostly from the atmosphere,\r\nabsorbing it by means of their leaves. But the free atmosphere, at only\r\na little space above the soil, contains on the average but 1/2500 of its\r\nbulk of this gas, whereas plants flourish in air containing a larger\r\nquantity, and, in fact, their other wants being supplied, they grow\r\nbetter as the quantity is increased to 1/12 the bulk of the air. These\r\nconsiderations make sufficiently obvious how important it is that the\r\nsoil have in itself a constant and abundant source of carbonic acid gas.\r\nAs before said, _organic matter, in a state of decay_, is the single\r\nmaterial which the farmer can incorporate with his soil in order to make\r\nthe latter a supply of this most indispensable form of plant-food.\r\n\r\nWhen organic matters decay in the soil, their carbon ultimately assumes\r\nthe form of Carbonic acid. This gas, constantly exhaling from the soil,\r\nis taken up by the foliage of the crops, and to some extent is absorbed\r\nlikewise by their roots.\r\n\r\nBoussingault & Lewy have examined the air inclosed in the interstices of\r\nvarious soils, and invariably found it much richer (10 to 400 times)\r\nthan that of the atmosphere above. Here follow some of their results:\r\n\r\n CARBONIC ACID IN SOILS.\r\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Key:\r\n A - _Volumes of Carbonic acid in 100 of air in pores of Soil._\r\n B - _Cubic feet of air in acre to depth of 14 inches._\r\n C - _Cubic feet of Carbonic acid in acre to depth of 14 inches._\r\n D - _Volumes of Carbonic acid to 100 of air above the soil._\r\n E - _Cubic feet of air over one acre to height of 14 inches._\r\n F - _Cubic feet of Carbonic acid over one acre to a height of 14 inches._\r\n\r\n --------------------------------------------------------+-----+------+----\r\n           _Designation and Condition of Soil._          |  A  |  B   | C\r\n --------------------------------------------------------+-----+------+----\r\n Sandy subsoil of forest                                 |0.24 | 4,326|  14\r\n Loamy   \"     \"   \"                                     |0.82 | 3,458|  28\r\n Surface soil  \"   \"                                     |0.86 | 5,768|  56\r\n Clayey soil of artichoke field                          |0.66 |10,094|  71\r\n Soil of asparagus bed, unmanured for one year           |0.79 |10,948|  86\r\n \"    \"    \"       \"    newly manured                    |1.54 |10,948| 172\r\n Sandy soil, six days after manuring, and three          |     |      |\r\n                                            days of rain.|2.21 |11,536| 257\r\n \"      \"    ten   \"    \"      \"      \"   \"              |     |      |\r\n                                             \"   \"   \"   |9.74 |11,536|1144\r\n Compost of vegetable mold                               |3.64 |20,608| 772\r\n                                                         |     |      |\r\n              _Carbonic Acid in Atmosphere_              |  D  |  E   | F\r\n                                                         |-----+------+----\r\n                                                         |0.025|50,820|  14\r\n --------------------------------------------------------+-----+------+----\r\n\r\nFrom the above it is seen that in soils containing little decomposing\r\norganic matters--as the forest sub-soils--the quantity of carbonic acid\r\nis no greater than that contained in an equal bulk of the atmosphere. It\r\nis greater in loamy and clayey soils; but is still small. In the\r\nartichoke field (probably light soil not lately manured), and even in an\r\nasparagus bed unmanured for one year, the amount of carbonic acid is not\r\ngreatly larger. In newly manured fields, and especially in a vegetable\r\ncompost, the quantity is vastly greater.\r\n\r\nThe organic matters which come from manures, or from the roots and other\r\nresidues of crops, are the source of the carbonic acid of the soil.\r\nThese matters continually waste in yielding this gas, and must be\r\nsupplied anew. Boussingault found that the rich soil of his kitchen\r\ngarden (near Strasburg) which had been heavily manured from the\r\nbarn-yard for many years, lost one-third of its carbon by exposure to\r\nthe air for three months (July, August and September,) being daily\r\nwatered. It originally contained 2.43 _per cent._ At the conclusion of\r\nthe experiment it contained but 1.60 _per cent._, having lost 0.83 _per\r\ncent._\r\n\r\nPeat and swamp-muck, when properly prepared, furnish carbonic acid in\r\nlarge quantities during their slow oxidation in the soil.\r\n\r\n3. _The Nitrogen of Peat, including Ammonia and Nitric Acid._\r\n\r\nThe sources of the nitrogen of plants, and the real cause of the value\r\nof nitrogenous fertilizers, are topics that have excited more discussion\r\nthan any other points in Agricultural Chemistry. This is the result of\r\ntwo circumstances. One is the obscurity in which some parts of the\r\nsubject have rested; the other is the immense practical and commercial\r\nimportance of this element, as a characteristic and essential ingredient\r\nof the most precious fertilizers. It is a rule that the most valuable\r\nmanures, _commercially considered_, are those containing the most\r\nnitrogen. Peruvian guano, sulphate of ammonia, soda-saltpeter, fish and\r\nflesh manures, bones and urine, cost the farmer more money per ton than\r\nany other manures he buys or makes, superphosphate of lime excepted, and\r\nthis does not find sale, for general purposes, unless it contains\r\nseveral _per cent._ of nitrogen. These are, in the highest sense,\r\nnitrogenous fertilizers, and, if deprived of their nitrogen, they would\r\nlose the greater share of their fertilizing power.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the nitrogen of manures depends upon the fact that\r\nthose forms (compounds) of nitrogen which are capable of supplying it to\r\nvegetation are comparatively scarce.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that peat contains a considerable quantity of\r\nnitrogen. The average amount in thirty specimens, analyzed under the\r\nauthor's direction, including peats and swamp mucks of all grades of\r\nquality, is equivalent to 1-1/2 _per cent._ of the air-dried substance,\r\nor more than thrice as much as exists in ordinary stable or yard manure.\r\nIn several peats the amount is as high as 2.4 _per cent._, and in one\r\ncase 2.9 _per cent._ were found.\r\n\r\nOf these thirty samples, one-half were largely mixed with soil, and\r\ncontained from 15 to 60 _per cent._ of mineral matters.\r\n\r\nReducing them to an average of 15 _per cent._ of water and 5 _per cent._\r\nof ash, they contain 2.1 _per cent._ of nitrogen, while the organic\r\npart, considered free from water and mineral substances, contains on the\r\naverage 2.6 _per cent._ See table, page 90.\r\n\r\nThe five peats, analyzed by Websky and Chevandier, as cited on page 24,\r\nconsidered free from water and ash, contain an average of 1.8 _per\r\ncent._ of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWe should not neglect to notice that peat is often comparatively poor in\r\nnitrogen. Of the specimens, examined in the Yale Analytical Laboratory,\r\nseveral contained but half a _per cent._ or less. So in the analyses of\r\nWebsky, one sample contained but 0.77 _per cent._ of the element in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAs concerns the state of combination in which nitrogen exists in peat,\r\nthere is a difference of opinion. Mulder regards it as chiefly occurring\r\nin the form of _ammonia_ (a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen), united\r\nto the organic acids from which it is very difficult to separate it.\r\nRecent investigations indicate that in general, peat contains but a\r\nsmall proportion of ready-formed ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe great part of the nitrogen of peat exists in an insoluble and inert\r\nform: but, by the action of the atmosphere upon it, especially when\r\nmixed with and divided by the soil, it gradually becomes available to\r\nvegetation to as great an extent as the nitrogen of ordinary\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nIt appears from late examinations that weathered peat may contain\r\n_nitric acid_ (compound of nitrogen with oxygen) in a proportion which,\r\nthough small, is yet of great importance, agriculturally speaking. What\r\nanalytical data we possess are subjoined.\r\n\r\n PROPORTIONS OF NITROGEN, ETC., IN PEAT.\r\n ---------+-------------+------------+------------+---------+------------\r\n          |             |            |   Total    |Ammonia, |\r\n          |             |  Analyst.  | Nitrogen.  |per cent.|Nitric acid.\r\n ---------+-------------+------------+------------+---------+------------\r\n 1--Brown |             |            |            |         |\r\n      Peat|Air dry (?)  |Boussingault|    2.20    |  0.018  |   0.000\r\n 2--Black |             |            |            |         |\r\n      Peat|     \"       |     \"      |Undetermined|  0.025  |Undetermined\r\n 3--Peat  |Dried at 212 deg.|Reichardt[4]|     \"      |  0.152  |   0.483\r\n 4--Peat  |     \"       |     \"      |     \"      |  0.165  |   0.525\r\n 5--Peat  |     \"       |     \"      |     \"      |  0.305  |   0.241\r\n 6--Peat  |     \"       |     \"      |     \"      |  0.335  |   0.421\r\n ---------+-------------+------------+------------+---------+------------\r\n\r\nSpecimens 3, 4 and 5, are swamp (or heath) mucks, and have been\r\nweathered for use in flower-culture. 3 and 4 are alike, save that 3 has\r\nbeen weathered a year longer than 4. They contain respectively 41, 56\r\nand 67 _per cent._ of organic matter.\r\n\r\nSample 6, containing 86 _per cent._ of organic matter, is employed as a\r\nmanure with great advantage, and probably was weathered before analysis.\r\nIt contained 85 _per cent._ of organic substance.\r\n\r\nMore important to us than the circumstance that this peat contains but\r\nlittle or no ammonia or nitric acid, and the other contains such or such\r\na fraction of one _per cent._ of these bodies, is the grand fact that\r\nall peats may yield a good share of their nitrogen to the support of\r\ncrops, when properly treated and applied.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Liebig's teachings, which were logically based\r\nupon the best data at the disposal of this distinguished philosopher\r\nwhen he wrote 25 years ago, it has been believed that the nitrogen of a\r\nfertilizer, in order to be available, must be converted into ammonia and\r\npresented in that shape to the plant. It has been recently made clear\r\nthat nitric acid, rather than ammonia, is the form of nitrogenous food\r\nwhich is most serviceable to vegetation, and the one which is most\r\nabundantly supplied by the air and soil. The value of ammonia is however\r\npositive, and not to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nWhen peat, properly prepared by weathering or composting, is suitably\r\nincorporated with a poor or light soil, it slowly suffers decomposition\r\nand wastes away. If it be wet, and air have access in limited quantity,\r\nespecially if _lime_ be mixed with it, a portion of its nitrogen is\r\ngradually converted into ammonia. With full access of air _nitric acid_\r\nis produced. In either case, it appears that a considerable share of the\r\nnitrogen escapes in the free state as gas, thereby becoming useless to\r\nvegetation until it shall have become converted again into ammonia or\r\nnitric acid. It happens in a cultivated soil that the oxygen of the air\r\nis in excess at the surface, and less abundant as we go down until we\r\nget below organic matters: it happens that one day it is saturated with\r\nwater more or less, and another day it is dry, so that at one time we\r\nhave the conditions for the formation of ammonia, and at another, those\r\nfavorable to producing nitric acid. In this way, so far as our present\r\nknowledge warrants us to affirm, organic matters, decaying in the soil,\r\ncontinuously yield portions of their nitrogen in the forms of ammonia\r\nand nitric acid for the nourishment of plants.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who skillfully employs as a fertilizer a peat containing a\r\ngood proportion of nitrogen, may thus expect to get from it results\r\nsimilar to what would come from the corresponding quantity of nitrogen\r\nin guano or stable manure.\r\n\r\nBut the capacity of peat for feeding crops with, nitrogen appears not\r\nto stop here. Under certain conditions, _the free nitrogen of the air\r\nwhich cannot be directly appropriated by vegetation, is oxidized in the\r\npores of the soil to nitric acid, and thus, free of expense to the\r\nfarmer, his crops are daily dressed with the most precious of all\r\nfertilizers_.\r\n\r\nThis gathering of useless nitrogen from the air, and making it over into\r\nplant-food cannot go on in a soil destitute of organic matter, requires\r\nin fact that vegetable remains or humified substances of some sort be\r\npresent there. The evidence of this statement, whose truth was maintained\r\nyears ago as a matter of opinion by many of the older chemists, has\r\nrecently become nearly a matter of demonstration by the investigations of\r\nBoussingault and Knop, while the explanation of it is furnished by the\r\nresearches of Schoenbein and Zabelin. To attempt any elucidation of it\r\nhere would require more space than is at our disposal.\r\n\r\nIt is plain from the contents of this paragraph that peat or swamp muck\r\nis, in general, an abundant source of nitrogen, and is often therefore\r\nan extremely cheap means of replacing the most rare and costly\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\nII.--With regard to the _inorganic matters of peat_ considered as food\r\nto plants, it is obvious, that, leaving out of the account for the\r\npresent, some exceptional cases, they are useful as far as they go.\r\n\r\nIn the ashes of peats, we almost always find small quantities of\r\nsulphate of lime, magnesia and phosphoric acid. Potash and soda too, are\r\noften present, though rarely to any considerable amount. Carbonate and\r\nsulphate of lime are large ingredients of the ashes of about one-half,\r\nof the thirty-three peats and swamp mucks I have examined. The ashes of\r\nthe other half are largely mixed with sand and soil, but in most cases\r\nalso contain considerable sulphate of lime, and often carbonates of\r\nlime and magnesia.\r\n\r\nIn one swamp-muck, from Milford, Conn., there was found but two _per\r\ncent._ of ash, at least one-half of which was sand, and the remainder\r\nsulphate of lime, (gypsum.) In other samples 20, 30, 50 and even 60 _per\r\ncent._ remained after burning off the organic matter. In these cases the\r\nash is chiefly sand. The amount of ash found in those peats which were\r\nmost free from sand, ranges from five to nine _per cent._ Probably the\r\naverage proportion of true ash, viz.: that derived from the organic\r\nmatters themselves, not including sand and accidental ingredients, is\r\nnot far from five _per cent._\r\n\r\nIn twenty-two specimens of European peat, examined by Websky, Jaeckel,\r\nWalz, Wiegmann, Einhof and Berthier, eleven contained from 0.6 to 3.5\r\n_per cent._ of ash. The other eleven yielded from 5.3 to 22 _per cent._\r\nThe average of the former was 2.4, that of the latter 12.7 _per cent._\r\nMost of these contained a considerable proportion of sand or soil.\r\n\r\nVariation in the composition as well as in the quantity of ash is very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThree analyses of peat-ashes have been executed at the author's instance\r\nwith the subjoined results:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ANALYSES OF PEAT-ASHES.\r\n ---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------\r\n                            |     A.    |     B.    |     C.\r\n Potash.                    |    0.69   |    0.80   |    3.46\r\n Soda.                      |    0.58   |           |   trace.\r\n Lime.                      |   40.52   |   35.59   |    6.60\r\n Magnesia.                  |    6.06   |    4.92   |    1.05\r\n Oxide of iron and alumina. |    5.17   |    9.08   |   15.59\r\n Phosphoric acid.           |    0.50   |    0.77   |    1.55\r\n Sulphuric acid.            |    5.52   |   10.41   |    4.04\r\n Chlorine.                  |    0.15   |    0.43   |    0.70\r\n Soluble silica.            |    8.23   |    1.40 } |\r\n Carbonic acid.             |   19.60   |   22.28 } |   67.01\r\n Sand.                      |   12.11   |   15.04 } |\r\n                            +-----------+-----------+----------\r\n                            |   99.13   |  100.74   |  100.00\r\n ---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\nA was furnished by Mr. Daniel Buck, Jr., of Poquonock, Conn., and comes\r\nfrom a peat which he uses as fuel.\r\n\r\nB was sent by Mr. J.

Potash and phosphoric acid are three times more\r\nabundant in C than in the others.\r\n\r\nInstead of citing in full the results of Websky, Jaeckel and others, it\r\nwill serve our object better to present the maximum, minimum and average\r\nproportions of the important ingredients in twenty-six recent analyses,\r\n(including these three,) that have come under the author's notice.\r\n\r\n VARIATIONS AND AVERAGES IN COMPOSITION OF PEAT-ASHES.\r\n\r\n                   _Minimum._       _Maximum._     _Average._\r\n Potash               0.05     to      3.64       0.89 per cent.\r\n Soda                 none     \"       5.73       0.83    \"\r\n Lime                 4.72     \"      58.38      24.00    \"\r\n Magnesia             none     \"      24.39       3.20    \"\r\n Alumina              0.90     \"      20.50       5.78    \"\r\n Oxide of iron        none     \"      73.33      18.70    \"\r\n Sulphuric acid       none     \"      37.40       7.50    \"\r\n Chlorine              \"       \"       6.50       0.60    \"\r\n Phosphoric acid       \"       \"       6.29       2.56    \"\r\n Sand                 0.99     \"      56.97      25.50    \"\r\n\r\nIt is seen from the above figures that the ash of peat varies in\r\ncomposition to an indefinite degree. Lime is the only ingredient that is\r\nnever quite wanting, and with the exception of sand, it is on the\r\naverage the largest. Of the other agriculturally valuable components,\r\nsulphuric acid has the highest average; then follows magnesia; then\r\nphosphoric acid, and lastly, potash and soda: all of these, however, may\r\nbe nearly or quite lacking.\r\n\r\nWebsky, who has recently made a study of the composition of a number of\r\nGerman peats, believes himself warranted to conclude that peat is so\r\nmodified in appearance by its mineral matters, that the quantity or\r\ncharacter of the latter may be judged of in many cases by the eye. He\r\nremarks, (_Journal fuer Praktische Chemie, Bd. 92, S. 87_,) \"that while\r\nfor example the peats containing much sand and clay have a red-brown\r\npowdery appearance, and never assume a lustrous surface by pressure;\r\nthose which are very rich in lime, are black, sticky when moist, hard\r\nand of a waxy luster on a pressed surface, when dry: a property which\r\nthey share indeed with very dense peats that contain little ash. Peats\r\nimpregnated with iron are easily recognized. Their peculiar odor, and\r\ntheir changed appearance distinguish them from all others.\"\r\n\r\nFrom my own investigations on thirty specimens of Connecticut peats, I\r\nam forced to disagree with Websky entirely, and to assert that except as\r\nregards sand, which may often be detected by the eye, there is no\r\nconnection whatever between the quantity or character of the ash and the\r\ncolor, consistency, density or any other external quality of the peat.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this variation in the ash-content of peat, deserve a\r\nmoment's notice. The plants that produce peat contain considerable\r\nproportions of lime, magnesia, alkalies, sulphuric acid, chlorine and\r\nphosphoric acid, as seen from the following analysis by Websky.\r\n\r\n COMPOSITION OF THE ASH OF SPHAGNUM.\r\n\r\n Potash.                        17.2\r\n Soda.                           8.3\r\n Lime.                          11.8\r\n Magnesia.                       6.7\r\n Sulphuric acid.                 6.5\r\n Chlorine.                       6.2\r\n Phosphoric acid.                6.7\r\n     _Per cent._ of ash, 2.5.\r\n\r\nThe mineral matters of the sphagnum do not all become ingredients of\r\nthe peat; but, as rapidly as the moss decays below, its soluble matters\r\nare to a great degree absorbed by the vegetation, which is still living\r\nand growing above. Again, when a stream flows through a peat-bed,\r\nsoluble matters are carried away by the water, which is often dark-brown\r\nfrom the substances dissolved in it. Finally the soil of the adjacent\r\nland is washed or blown upon the swamp, in greater or less quantities.\r\n\r\nIII.--_The decomposition of peat in the soil offers some peculiarities_\r\nthat are worthy of notice in this place. Peat is more gradual and\r\nregular in decay than the vegetable matters of stable dung, or than that\r\nfurnished by turning under sod or green crops. It is thus a more steady\r\nand lasting benefit, especially in light soils, out of which ordinary\r\nvegetable manures disappear too rapidly. The decay of peat appears to\r\nproceed through a regular series of steps. In the soil, especially in\r\ncontact with soluble alkaline bodies, as ammonia and lime, there is a\r\nprogressive conversion of the _insoluble_ or _less soluble_ into\r\n_soluble_ compounds. Thus the inert matters that resist the immediate\r\nsolvent power of alkalies, absorb oxygen from the air, and form the\r\nhumic or ulmic acids soluble in alkalies; the humic acids undergo\r\nconversion into crenic acid, and this body, by oxidation, passes into\r\napocrenic acid. The two latter are soluble in water, and, in the porous\r\nsoil, they are rapidly brought to the end-results of decay, viz.: water,\r\ncarbonic acid, ammonia and free nitrogen.\r\n\r\nGreat differences must be observed, however, in the rapidity with which\r\nthese changes take place. Doubtless they go on most slowly in case of\r\nthe fibrous compact peats, and perhaps some of the lighter and more\r\nporous samples of swamp muck, would decay nearly as fast as rotted\r\nstable dung.\r\n\r\nIt might appear from the above statement, that the effect of exposing\r\npeat to the air, as is done when it is incorporated with the soil, would\r\nbe to increase relatively the amount of soluble organic matters; but the\r\ntruth is, that they are often actually diminished. In fact, the\r\noxidation and consequent removal of these soluble matters (crenic and\r\napocrenic acids,) is likely to proceed more rapidly than they can be\r\nproduced from the less soluble humic acid of the peat.\r\n\r\nIV.--_Comparison of Peat with Stable Manure._\r\n\r\nThe fertilizing value of peat is best understood by comparing it with\r\nsome standard manure. Stable manure is obviously that fertilizer whose\r\neffects are most universally observed and appreciated, and by setting\r\nanalyses of the two side by side, we may see at a glance, what are the\r\nexcellencies and what the deficiencies of peat. In order rightly to\r\nestimate the worth of those ingredients which occur in but small\r\nproportion in peat, we must remember that it, like stable manure, may\r\nbe, and usually should be, applied in large doses, so that in fact the\r\nsmallest ingredients come upon an acre in considerable quantity. In\r\nmaking our comparison, we will take the analysis of Peat from the farm\r\nof Mr. Daniel Buck, Jr., of Poquonock, Conn., and the average of\r\nseveral analyses of rotted stable dung of _good quality_.\r\n\r\nNo. _I_, is the analysis of Peat; No. _II_, that of well rotted stable\r\nmanure:--\r\n\r\n                                              _I._      _II._\r\n Water expelled at 212 degrees.              79.000     79.00\r\n         {Soluble in dilute solution                 }\r\n Org.    {     of carbonate of soda.          7.312  }\r\n Matter. {Insoluble in solution                      }  14.16\r\n         {     of carbonate of soda.         12.210  }\r\n Potash.                                      0.010      0.65\r\n Soda.                                        0.009\r\n Lime.                                        0.608      0.57\r\n Magnesia.                                    0.091      0.19\r\n Phosphoric acid.                             0.008      0.23\r\n Sulphuric acid.                              0.082      0.27\r\n Nitrogen.                                    0.600      0.55\r\n Matters, soluble in water.                   0.450      4.42\r\n\r\nTo make the comparison as just as possible, the peat is calculated with\r\nthe same content of water, that stable dung usually has.\r\n\r\nWe observe then, that the peat contains in a given quantity, _about\r\none-third more organic matter, an equal amount of lime and nitrogen_;\r\nbut is _deficient in potash, magnesia, phosphoric and sulphuric acids_.\r\n\r\nThe deficiencies of this peat in the matter of composition may be\r\ncorrected, as regards potash, by adding to 100 lbs. of it 1 lb. of\r\npotash of commerce, or 5 lbs. of unleached wood-ashes; as regards\r\nphosphoric and sulphuric acids, by adding 1 lb. of good superphosphate,\r\nor 1 lb. each of bone dust and plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the additions just named, will convert _any fresh peat_,\r\ncontaining not more than 80 _per cent._ of water and not less than 20\r\n_per cent._ of organic matter, into a mixture having as much fertilizing\r\nmatters as stable dung, with the possible exception of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, however, that two manures may reveal to the chemist the\r\nsame composition, and yet be very unlike in their fertilizing effects,\r\nbecause their conditions are unlike, because they differ in their\r\ndegrees of solubility or availability.\r\n\r\nAs before insisted upon, it is true in general, that peat is more slow\r\nof decomposition than yard-manure, and this fact, which is an advantage\r\nin an amendment, is a disadvantage in a fertilizer. Though there may be\r\nsome peats, or rather swamp mucks, which are energetic and rapid in\r\ntheir action, it seems that they need to be applied in larger quantities\r\nthan stable manure in order to produce corresponding fertilizing\r\neffects. In many cases peat requires some preparation by weathering, or\r\nby chemical action--\"fermentation\"--induced by decomposing animal\r\nmatters or by alkalies. This topic will shortly be discussed.\r\n\r\nWe adopt, as a general fact, the conclusion that peat is inferior in\r\nfertilizing power to stable manure.\r\n\r\nExperience asserts, however, with regard to some individual kinds, that\r\nthey are equal to common yard manure without any preparation whatever.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel Buck, of Poquonock, Conn., says, of the 'muck,' over-lying\r\nthe peat, whose composition has just been compared with stable manure,\r\nthat it \"has been applied fresh to meadow with good results; the grass\r\nis not as tall but thicker and finer, and of a darker green in the\r\nspring, than when barn-yard manure is spread on.\"\r\n\r\nA swamp muck, from Mr. A. M. Haling, Rockville, Conn., \"has been used as\r\na top-dressing, on grass, with excellent results. It is a good\r\nsubstitute for barn-yard manure.\"\r\n\r\nA peat, from Mr. Russell U. Peck, of Berlin, Conn., \"has been used\r\nfresh, on corn and meadow, with good effect.\"\r\n\r\nOf the peat, from the 'Beaver Pond,' near New Haven, Mr. Chauncey\r\nGoodyear, says, \"it has been largely used in a fresh state, and in this\r\ncondition is as good as cow dung.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Keeler, remarks, concerning a swamp muck occurring at South\r\nSalem, N. Y., that \"it has been used in the fresh state, applied to corn\r\nand potatoes, and appears to be equal to good barn manure:\"\r\nfurther:--\"it has rarely been weathered more than two months, and then\r\napplied side by side with the best yard manure has given equally good\r\nresults.\"\r\n\r\nA few words as to the apparent contradiction between Chemistry, which\r\nsays that peat is not equal to stable dung as a fertilizer, and\r\nPractice, which in these cases affirms that it is equal to our standard\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the chemical conclusion is a general one, and does\r\nnot apply to individual peats, which, in a few instances, may be\r\nsuperior to yard manure. The practical judgment also is, that, in\r\ngeneral, yard manure is the best.\r\n\r\nTo go to the individual cases; second: A peat in which nitrogen exists\r\nin as large a proportion as is found in stable or yard manure, being\r\nused in larger quantity, or being more durable in its action, may for a\r\nfew seasons produce better results than the latter, merely on account of\r\nthe presence of this one ingredient, it may in fact, for the soil and\r\ncrop to which it is applied, be a better fertilizer than yard manure,\r\nbecause nitrogen is most needed in that soil, and yet for the generality\r\nof soils, or in the long run, it may prove to be an inferior fertilizer.\r\n\r\nAgain; third--the melioration of the physical qualities of a soil, the\r\namendment of its dryness and excessive porosity, by means of peat, may\r\nbe more effective for agricultural purposes, than the application of\r\ntenfold as much fertilizing, _i. e._ plant-feeding materials; in the\r\nsame way that the mere draining of an over-moist soil often makes it\r\nmore productive than the heaviest manuring.\r\n\r\n2.--_On the characters of Peat that are detrimental, or that may\r\nsometimes need correction before it is agriculturally useful._\r\n\r\nI.--_Bad effects on wet heavy soils._\r\n\r\nWe have laid much stress on the amending qualities of peat, when applied\r\nto dry and leachy soils, which by its use are rendered more retentive of\r\nmoisture and manure. These properties, which it would seem, are just\r\nadapted to renovate very light land, under certain circumstances, may\r\nbecome disadvantageous on heavier soils. On clays no application is\r\nneeded to retain moisture. They are already too wet as a general thing.\r\n\r\nPeat, when put into the soil, lasts much longer than stubble, or green\r\ncrops plowed in, or than long manure. If buried too deeply, or put into\r\na heavy soil, especially if in large quantity, it does not decay, but\r\nremains wet, and tends to make a bog of the field itself.\r\n\r\nFor soils that are rather heavy, it is therefore best to compost the\r\npeat with some rapidly fermenting manure. We thus get a compound which\r\nis quicker than muck, and slower than stable manure, etc., and is\r\ntherefore better adapted to the wants of the soil than either of these\r\nwould be alone.\r\n\r\nHere it will be seen that much depends on the character of the peat\r\nitself. If light and spongy, and easily dried, it may be used alone with\r\nadvantage on loamy soils, whereas if dense, and coherent, it would most\r\nlikely be a poor amendment on a soil which has much tendency to become\r\ncompact, and therefore does not readily free itself from excess of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBut even a clay soil, if _thorough-drained and deeply plowed_, may be\r\nwonderfully improved by even a heavy dressing of muck, as then, the\r\nwater being let off, the muck can exert no detrimental action; but\r\noperates as effectually to loosen a too heavy soil, as in case of sand,\r\nit makes an over-porous soil compact or retentive. A clay may be made\r\nfriable, if well drained, by incorporating with it any substance as\r\nlime, sand, long manure or muck, which interposing between the clayey\r\nparticles, prevents their adhering together.\r\n\r\nII.--_Noxious ingredients._\r\n\r\na. _Vitriol peat._ Occasionally a peat is met with which is injurious if\r\napplied in the fresh state to crops, from its containing some substance\r\nwhich exerts a poisonous action on vegetation. The principal detrimental\r\ningredients that occur in peat, appear to be sulphate of protoxide of\r\niron,--the same body that is popularly known under the names copperas\r\nand green-vitriol,--and sulphate of alumina, the astringent component of\r\nalum.\r\n\r\nI have found these substances ready formed in large quantity in but one\r\nof the peats that I have examined, viz.: that sent me by Mr. Perrin\r\nScarborough; of Brooklyn, Conn. This peat dissolved in water to the\r\nextent of 15 _per cent._, and the soluble portion, although containing\r\nsome organic matter and sulphate of lime, consisted in great part of\r\ngreen-vitriol.\r\n\r\nPortions of this muck, when thrown up to the air, become covered with \"a\r\nwhite crust, having the taste of alum or saltpeter.\"\r\n\r\nThe bed containing this peat, though drained, yields but a little poor\r\nbog hay, and the peat itself, even after weathering for a year, when\r\napplied, mixed with one-fifth of stable manure to corn in the hill, gave\r\nno encouraging results, though a fair crop was obtained. It is probable\r\nthat the sample analyzed was much richer in salts of iron and alumina,\r\nthan the average of the muck.\r\n\r\nGreen-vitriol in minute doses is not hurtful, but rather beneficial to\r\nvegetation; but in larger quantity it is fatally destructive.\r\n\r\nIn a salt-marsh mud sent me by the Rev. Wm. Clift, of Stonington, Conn.,\r\nthere was found sulphate of iron in considerable quantity.\r\n\r\nThis noxious substance likewise occurred in small amount in swamp muck\r\nfrom E. Hoyt, Esq., New Canaan, Conn., and in hardly appreciable\r\nquantity in several others that I have examined. Besides green-vitriol,\r\nit is possible that certain organic salts of iron, may be deleterious.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous properties of vitriol-peats may be effectually corrected\r\nby composting with lime, or wood-ashes. By the action of these\r\nsubstances, sulphate of lime, (plaster of Paris) is formed, while the\r\niron separates as peroxide, which, being insoluble, is without\r\ndeleterious effect on vegetation. Where only soluble organic salts of\r\niron (crenate of iron) are present, simple exposure to the air suffices\r\nto render them innocuous.\r\n\r\nb. _The acidity of Peats._--Many writers have asserted that peat and\r\nmuck possess a hurtful \"acidity\" which must be corrected before they can\r\nbe usefully employed. It is indeed a fact, that peat consists largely of\r\nacids, but, except perhaps in the vitriol-peats, (those containing\r\ncopperas,) they are so insoluble, or if soluble, are so quickly modified\r\nby the absorption of oxygen, that they do not exhibit any \"acidity\" that\r\ncan be deleterious to vegetation. It is advised to neutralize this\r\nsupposed acidity by lime or an alkali before using peat as a fertilizer\r\nor amendment, and there is great use in such mixtures of peat with\r\nalkaline matters, as we shall presently notice under the head of\r\ncomposts.\r\n\r\nBy the word acidity is conveyed the idea of something hurtful to plants.\r\nThis something is, doubtless, in many cases, the salts of iron we have\r\njust noticed. In others, it is simply the inertness, \"coldness\" of the\r\npeat, which is not positively injurious, but is, for a time at least, of\r\nno benefit to the soil.\r\n\r\nc. _Resinous matters_ are mentioned by various writers as injurious\r\ningredients of peat, but I find no evidence that this notion is\r\nwell-founded. The peat or muck formed from the decay of resinous wood\r\nand leaves does not appear to be injurious, and the amount of resin in\r\npeat is exceedingly small.\r\n\r\n3.--_The Preparation of Peat for Agricultural use._\r\n\r\na. _Excavation._--As to the time and manner of getting out peat, the\r\ncircumstances of each case must determine. I only venture here to offer\r\na few hints on this subject, which belongs so exclusively to the farm.\r\nThe month of August is generally the appropriate time for throwing up\r\npeat, as then the swamps are usually most free from water, and most\r\naccessible to men and teams; but peat is often dug to best advantage in\r\nthe winter, not only on account of the cheapness of labor, and from\r\nthere being less hurry with other matters on the farm at that season,\r\nbut also, because the freezing and thawing of the peat that is thrown\r\nout, greatly aid to disintegrate it and prepare it for use.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of The _Homestead_, signing himself \"Commentator,\" has\r\ngiven directions for getting out peat that are well worth the attention\r\nof farmers. He says:--\r\n\r\n     \"The composting of muck and peat, with our stable and\r\n     barn-yard manures, is surely destined to become one of the\r\n     most important items in farm management throughout all the\r\n     older States at least. One of the difficulties which lie in\r\n     the way, is the first removal of the muck from its low and\r\n     generally watery bed; to facilitate this, in many locations,\r\n     it is less expensive to dry it before carting, by beginning an\r\n     excavation at the border of the marsh in autumn, sufficiently\r\n     wide for a cart path, throwing the muck out upon the surface\r\n     on each side, and on a floor of boards or planks, to prevent\r\n     it from absorbing moisture from the wet ground beneath; this\r\n     broad ditch to be carried a sufficient length and depth to\r\n     obtain the requisite quantity of muck. Thus thrown out, the\r\n     two piles are now in a convenient form to be covered with\r\n     boards, and, if properly done, the muck kept covered till the\r\n     succeeding autumn, will be found to be dry and light, and in\r\n     some cases may be carted away on the surface, or it may be\r\n     best to let it remain a few months longer until the bottom of\r\n     the ditch has become sufficiently frozen to bear a team; it\r\n     can then be more easily loaded upon a sled or sleigh, and\r\n     drawn to the yards and barn. In other localities, and where\r\n     large quantities are wanted, and it lies deep, a sort of\r\n     wooden railroad and inclined plane can be constructed by means\r\n     of a plank track for the wheels of the cart to run upon, the\r\n     team walking between these planks, and if the vehicle is\r\n     inclined to 'run off the track,' it may usually be prevented\r\n     by scantlings, say four inches thick, nailed upon one of the\r\n     tracks on each side of the place where the wheel should run.\r\n     Two or more teams and carts may now be employed, returning\r\n     into the excavation outside of this track. As the work\r\n     progresses, the track can be extended at both ends, and by\r\n     continuing or increasing the inclination at the upper end, a\r\n     large and high pile may be made, and if kept dry, will answer\r\n     for years for composting, and can be easily drawn to the barn\r\n     at any time.\"\r\n\r\nb. _Exposure, weathering, or seasoning of peat._--In some cases, the\r\nchief or only use of exposing the thrown-up peat to the action of the\r\nair and weather during several months or a whole year, is to rid it of\r\nthe great amount of water which adheres to it, and thus reduce its bulk\r\nand weight previous to cartage.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of exposure as indicated by my analyses, is to reduce\r\nthe amount of matter soluble in water, and cause peats to approach in\r\nthis respect a fertile soil, so that instead of containing 2, 4, or 6\r\n_per cent._ of substances soluble in water, as at first, they are\r\nbrought to contain but one-half these amounts, or even less. This\r\nchange, however, goes on so rapidly after peat is mingled with the soil,\r\nthat previous exposure on this account is rarely necessary, and most\r\npeats might be used perfectly fresh but for the difficulty often\r\nexperienced, of reducing them to such a state of division as to admit of\r\nproper mixture with the soil.\r\n\r\nThe coherent peats which may be cut out in tough blocks, must be\r\nweathered, in order that the fibres of moss or grass-roots, which give\r\nthem their consistency, may be decomposed or broken to an extent\r\nadmitting of easy pulverization by the instruments of tillage.\r\n\r\nThe subjection of fresh and wet peat to frost, speedily destroys its\r\ncoherence and reduces it to the proper state of pulverization. For this\r\nreason, fibrous peat should be exposed when wet to winter weather.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of exposure is, to bring the peat into a state of more\r\nactive chemical change. Peat, of the deeper denser sorts, is generally\r\ntoo inert (\"sour,\" cold) to be directly useful to the plant. By exposure\r\nto the air it appears gradually to acquire the properties of the humus\r\nof the soil, or of stable manure, which are vegetable matters, altered\r\nby the same exposure. It appears to become more readily oxidable, more\r\nactive, chemically, and thus more capable of exciting or rather aiding\r\nvegetable growth, which, so far as the soil is concerned, is the result\r\nof chemical activities.\r\n\r\nAccount has been already given of certain peats, which, used fresh, are\r\naccounted equal or nearly equal to stable manure. Others have come under\r\nthe writer's notice, which have had little immediate effect when used\r\nbefore seasoning.\r\n\r\nMr. J. H. Stanwood says of a peat, from Colebrook, Conn., that it \"has\r\nbeen used to some extent as a top-dressing for grass and other crops\r\nwith satisfactory results, _although no particular benefit was\r\nnoticeable during the first year_. After that, the effects might be seen\r\nfor a number of years.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Wm. Clift observes, concerning a salt peat, from Stonington,\r\nConn.:--\"It has not been used fresh; is too acid; even potatoes do not\r\nyield well _in it the first season_, without manure.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of the chemical changes induced by weathering, is to some\r\nextent understood so far as the nitrogen, the most important fertilizing\r\nelement, is concerned. The nitrogen of peat, as we have seen, is mostly\r\ninert, a small portion of it only, existing in a soluble or available\r\nform. By weathering, portions of this nitrogen become converted into\r\nnitric acid. This action goes on at the surface of the heap, where it is\r\nmost fully exposed to the air. Below, where the peat is more moist,\r\nammonia is formed, perhaps simply by the reduction of nitric acid--not\r\nunlikely also, by the transformation of inert nitrogen. On referring to\r\nthe analyses given on page 44, it is seen, that the first two samples\r\ncontain but little ammonia and no nitric acid. Though it is not stated\r\nwhat was the condition of these peats, it is probable they had not been\r\nweathered. The other four samples were weathered, and the weathering had\r\nbeen the more effectual from the large admixture of sand with them. They\r\nyielded to the analyst very considerable quantities of ammonia and\r\nnitrates.\r\n\r\nWhen a peat contains sulphate of protoxide of iron, or soluble organic\r\nsalts of iron, to an injurious extent, these may be converted into other\r\ninsoluble and innocuous bodies, by a sufficient exposure to the air.\r\nSulphate of protoxide of iron is thus changed into sulphate of peroxide\r\nof iron, which is insoluble, and can therefore exert no hurtful effect\r\non vegetation, while the soluble organic bodies of peat are oxydized and\r\neither converted into carbonic acid gas, carbonate of ammonia and water,\r\nor else made insoluble.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable, however, that merely throwing up a well\r\ncharacterized vitriol-peat into heaps, and exposing it thus imperfectly\r\nto the atmosphere, is sufficient to correct its bad qualities. Such\r\npeats need the addition of some alkaline body, as ammonia, lime, or\r\npotash, to render them salutary fertilizers.\r\n\r\nc. _This brings us to the subject of composting_, which appears to be\r\nthe best means of taking full advantage of all the good qualities of\r\npeat, and of obviating or neutralizing the ill results that might follow\r\nthe use of some raw peats, either from a peculiarity in their\r\ncomposition, (soluble organic compounds of iron, sulphate of protoxide\r\nof iron,) or from too great indestructibility. The chemical changes\r\n(oxidation of _iron_ and _organic acids_), which prepare the inert or\r\neven hurtful ingredients of peat to minister to the support of\r\nvegetation, take place most rapidly in presence of certain other\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe substances which rapidly induce chemical change in peats, are of two\r\nkinds, viz.: 1.--animal or vegetable matters that are highly susceptible\r\nto alteration and decay, and 2.--alkalies, either _ammonia_ coming from\r\nthe decomposition of animal matters, or _lime_, _potash_ and _soda_.\r\n\r\nA great variety of matters may of course be employed for making or\r\nmixing with peat composts; but there are comparatively few which allow\r\nof extensive and economical use, and our notice will be confined to\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the composting of peat with _animal manures_ deserves\r\nattention. Its advantages may be summed up in two statements.\r\n\r\n1.--It is an easy and perfect method of economizing all such manures,\r\neven those kinds most liable to loss by fermentation, as night soil and\r\nhorse dung; and,\r\n\r\n2.--It develops most fully and speedily the inert fertilizing qualities\r\nof the peat itself.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting any explanation of the changes undergone by a peat\r\nand manure compost, further than to say that the fermentation which\r\nbegins in the manure extends to and involves the peat, reducing the\r\nwhole nearly, if not exactly, to the condition of well-rotted dung, and\r\nthat in this process the peat effectually prevents the loss of nitrogen\r\nas ammonia,--I may appropriately give the practical experience of\r\nfarmers who have proved in the most conclusive manner how profitable it\r\nis to devote a share of time and labor to the manufacture of this kind\r\nof compost.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Composts with Stable Manure._--The best plan of\r\ncomposting is to have a water tight trench, four inches deep and twenty\r\ninches wide, constructed in the stable floor, immediately behind the\r\ncattle, and every morning put a bushel-basketful of muck behind each\r\nanimal. In this way the urine is perfectly absorbed by the muck, while\r\nthe warmth of the freshly voided excrements so facilitates the\r\nfermentative process, that, according to Mr. F. Holbrook, Brattleboro,\r\nVt., who has described this method, _much more muck can thus be well\r\nprepared for use_ in the spring, than by any of the ordinary modes of\r\ncomposting. When the dung and muck are removed from the stable, they\r\nshould be well intermixed, and as fast as the compost is prepared, it\r\nshould be put into a compact heap, and covered with a layer of muck\r\nseveral inches thick. It will then hardly require any shelter if used in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nIf the peat be sufficiently dry and powdery, or free from tough lumps,\r\nit may usefully serve as bedding, or litter for horses and cattle, as it\r\nabsorbs the urine, and is sufficiently mixed with the dung in the\r\noperation of cleaning the stable. It is especially good in the pig-pen,\r\nwhere the animals themselves work over the compost in the most thorough\r\nmanner, especially if a few kernels of corn be occasionally scattered\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin Hoyt, of New Canaan, Conn., writes:--\"Our horse stables are\r\nconstructed with a movable floor and pit beneath, which holds 20 loads\r\nof muck of 25 bushels per load. Spring and fall, this pit is filled with\r\nfresh muck, which receives all the urine of the horses, and being\r\noccasionally worked over and mixed, furnishes us annually with 40 loads\r\nof the most valuable manure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our stables are sprinkled with muck every morning, at the rate of one\r\nbushel per stall, and the smell of ammonia, etc., so offensive in most\r\nstables, is never perceived in ours. Not only are the stables kept\r\nsweet, but the ammonia is saved by this procedure.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it is preferred to make the compost out of doors, the plan\r\ngenerally followed is to lay down a bed of weathered peat, say eight to\r\ntwelve inches thick; cover this with a layer of stable dung, of four to\r\neight inches; put on another stratum of peat, and so, until a heap of\r\nthree to four feet is built up. The heap may be six to eight feet wide,\r\nand indefinitely long. It should be finished with a thick coating of\r\npeat, and the manure should be covered as fast as brought out.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of manure and peat should vary somewhat according to\r\ntheir quality and characters. Strawy manure, or that from milch-cows,\r\nwill \"ferment\" less peat than clear dung, especially when the latter is\r\nmade by horses or highly fed animals. Some kinds of peat heat much\r\neasier than others. There are peats which will ferment of themselves in\r\nwarm moist weather--even in the bog, giving off ammonia in perceptible\r\nthough small amount. Experience is the only certain guide as to the\r\nrelative quantities to be employed, various proportions from one to five\r\nof peat for one of manure, by bulk, being used.\r\n\r\nWhen the land is light and needs amending, as regards its retentive\r\npower, it is best to make the quantity of peat as large as can be\r\nthoroughly fermented by the manure.\r\n\r\nThe making of a high heap, and the keeping it trim and in shape, is a\r\nmatter requiring more labor than is generally necessary. Mr. J. H.\r\nStanwood, of Colebrook, Conn., writes me:--\r\n\r\n\"My method of composting is as follows: I draw my muck to the barn-yard,\r\nplacing the loads as near together as I can tip them from the cart. Upon\r\nthis I spread whatever manure I have at hand, and mix with the feet of\r\nthe cattle, and heap up with a scraper.\"\r\n\r\nPeat may be advantageously used to save from waste the droppings of the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin Hoyt, of New Canaan, Conn., says:--\"We use muck largely in our\r\nbarn-yards, and after it becomes thoroughly saturated and intermixed\r\nwith the droppings of the stock, it is piled up to ferment, and the yard\r\nis covered again with fresh muck.\"\r\n\r\nMr. N. Hart, Jr., of West Cornwall, Conn., writes:--\"In the use of muck\r\nwe proceed as follows: Soon after haying we throw up enough for a year's\r\nuse, or several hundred loads. In the fall, the summer's accumulation in\r\nhog-pens and barn cellars is spread upon the mowing grounds, and a\r\nliberal supply of muck carted in and spread in the bottoms of the\r\ncellars, ready for the season for stabling cattle. When this is well\r\nsaturated with the drippings of the stables, a new supply is added. The\r\naccumulation of the winter is usually applied to the land for the corn\r\ncrop, except the finer portion, which is used to top-dress meadow land.\r\nA new supply is then drawn in for the swine to work up. This is added to\r\nfrom time to time, and as the swine are fed on whey, they will convert a\r\nlarge quantity into valuable manure for top-dressing mowing land.\"\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion exists as to the treatment of the compost. Some\r\nhold it indifferent whether the peat and manure are mixed, or put in\r\nlayers when the composting begins. Others assert, that the fermentation\r\nproceeds better when the ingredients are stratified. Some direct, that\r\nthe compost should not be stirred. The general testimony is, that\r\nmixture, at the outset, is as effectual as putting up in layers; but,\r\nif the manure be strawy, it is, of course, difficult or impracticable to\r\nmix at first. Opinion also preponderates in favor of stirring, during or\r\nafter the fermentation.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoyt remarks:--\"We are convinced, that the oftener a compost pile of\r\nyard manure and muck is worked over after fermenting, the better. We\r\nwork it over and add to it a little more muck and other material, and\r\nthe air being thus allowed to penetrate it, a new fermentation or\r\nheating takes place, rendering it more decomposable and valuable.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Wm. Clift, writes:--\"Three or four loads of muck to one of stable\r\nmanure, put together in the fall or winter in alternate layers, forked\r\nover twice before spreading and plowing in, may represent the method of\r\ncomposting.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams White, of Brooklyn, Conn., proceeds in a different manner. He\r\nsays:--\"In composting, 20 loads are drawn on to upland in September, and\r\nthrown up in a long pile. Early in the spring 20 loads of stable manure\r\nare laid along side, and covered with the muck. As soon as it has heated\r\nmoderately, the whole is forked over and well mixed.\"\r\n\r\nThose who have practiced making peat composts with their yard, stable,\r\nand pen manure, almost invariably find them highly satisfactory in use,\r\nespecially upon light soils.\r\n\r\nA number of years ago, I saw a large pile of compost in the farm-yard of\r\nMr. Pond, of Milford, Conn., and witnessed its effect as applied by that\r\ngentleman to a field of sixteen acres of fine gravelly or coarse sandy\r\nsoil. The soil, from having a light color and excessive porosity, had\r\nbecome dark, unctuous, and retentive of moisture, so that during the\r\ndrouth of 1856, the crops on this field were good and continued to\r\nflourish, while on the contiguous land they were dried up and nearly\r\nruined. This compost was made from a light muck, that contained but\r\nthree _per cent._ of ash (more than half of which was sand), and but 1.2\r\n_per cent._ of nitrogen, in the air-dry state--(twenty _per cent._ of\r\nwater). Three loads of this muck were used to one of stable manure.\r\n\r\nHere follow some estimates of the value of this compost by practical\r\nmen. They are given to show that older statements, to the same effect,\r\ncannot be regarded as exaggerated.\r\n\r\nMr. J. H. Stanwood, of Colebrook, Conn., says:--\"Experiments made by\r\nmyself, have confirmed me in the opinion that a compost of equal parts\r\nof muck and stable manure is equal to the same quantity of stable\r\nmanure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel Buck, Jr., of Poquonock, Conn., remarks:--\"8 loads of muck\r\nand 4 of manure in compost, when properly forked over, are equal to 12\r\nloads of barn-yard manure on sandy soil.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Wm. Clift, of Stonington, Conn., writes:--\"I consider a compost\r\nmade of one load of stable manure and three of muck, equal in value to\r\nfour loads of yard manure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. N. Hart, Jr., of West Cornwall, Conn., observes of a peat sent by\r\nhim for analysis:--\"We formerly composted it in the yard with stable\r\nmanure, but have remodeled our stables, and now use it as an absorbent\r\nand to increase the bulk of manure to double its original quantity. We\r\nconsider the mixture more valuable than the same quantity of stable\r\nmanure.\" Again, \"so successful has been the use of it, that we could\r\nhardly carry on our farming operations without it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Adams White, of Brooklyn, Conn., states:--\"The compost of equal\r\nbulks of muck and stable manure, has been used for corn (with plaster in\r\nthe hill,) on dry sandy soil to great advantage. I consider the compost\r\nworth more per cord than the barn-yard manure.\"\r\n\r\n_Night Soil_ is a substance which possesses, when fresh, the most\r\nvaluable fertilizing qualities, in a very concentrated form. It is also\r\none which is liable to rapid and almost complete deterioration, as I\r\nhave demonstrated by analyses. The only methods of getting the full\r\neffect of this material are, either to use it fresh, as is done by the\r\nChinese and Japanese on a most extensive and offensive scale; or to\r\ncompost it before it can decompose. The former method, will, it is to be\r\nhoped, never find acceptance among us. The latter plan has nearly all\r\nthe advantages of the former, without its unpleasant features.\r\n\r\nWhen the night soil falls into a vault, it may be composted, by simply\r\nsprinkling fine peat over its surface, once or twice weekly, as the case\r\nmay require, _i. e._ as often as a bad odor prevails. The quantity thus\r\nadded, may be from twice to ten times the bulk of the night soil,--the\r\nmore within these limits, the better. When the vault is full, the mass\r\nshould be removed, worked well over and after a few days standing, will\r\nbe ready to use to manure corn, tobacco, etc., in the hill, or for any\r\npurpose to which guano or poudrette is applied. If it cannot be shortly\r\nused, it should be made into a compact heap, and covered with a thick\r\nstratum of peat. When signs of heating appear, it should be watched\r\nclosely; and if the process attains too much violence, additional peat\r\nshould be worked into it. Drenching with water is one of the readiest\r\nmeans of checking too much heating, but acts only temporarily. Dilution\r\nwith peat to a proper point, which experience alone can teach, is the\r\nsurest way of preventing loss. It should not be forgotten to put a thick\r\nlayer of peat at the bottom of the vault to begin with.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent plan, when circumstances admit, is, to have the\r\nearth-floor where the night soil drops, level with the surface of the\r\nground, or but slightly excavated, and a shed attached to the rear of\r\nthe privy to shelter a good supply of peat as well as the compost\r\nitself. Operations are begun by putting down a layer of peat to receive\r\nthe droppings; enough should be used to absorb all the urine. When this\r\nis nearly saturated, more should be sprinkled on, and the process is\r\nrepeated until the accumulations must be removed to make room for more.\r\nThen, once a week or so, the whole is hauled out into the shed, well\r\nmixed, and formed into a compact heap, or placed as a layer upon a\r\nstratum of peat, some inches thick, and covered with the same. The\r\nquantity of first-class compost that may be made yearly upon any farm,\r\nif due care be taken, would astonish those who have not tried it. James\r\nSmith, of Deanston, Scotland, who originated our present system of\r\nThorough Drainage, asserted, that the excrements of one man for a year,\r\nare sufficient to manure half an acre of land. In Belgium the manure\r\nfrom such a source has a commercial value of $9.00 gold.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that the skillful farmer may make considerably more than\r\nthat sum from it in New England, _per annum_. Mr. Hoyt, of New Canaan,\r\nConn., says:--\r\n\r\n\"Our privies are deodorized by the use of muck, which is sprinkled over\r\nthe surface of the pit once a week, and from them alone we thus prepare\r\nannually, enough \"poudrette\" to manure our corn in the hill.\"\r\n\r\n_Peruvian Guano_, so serviceable in its first applications to light\r\nsoils, may be composted with muck to the greatest advantage. Guano is an\r\nexcellent material for bringing muck into good condition, and on the\r\nother hand the muck most effectually prevents any waste of the costly\r\nguano, and at the same time, by furnishing the soil with its own\r\ningredients, to a greater or less degree prevents the exhaustion that\r\noften follows the use of guano alone. The quantity of muck should be\r\npretty large compared to that of the guano,--a bushel of guano will\r\ncompost six, eight, or ten of muck. Both should be quite fine, and\r\nshould be well mixed, the mixture should be moist and kept covered with\r\na layer of muck of several inches of thickness. This sort of compost\r\nwould probably be sufficiently fermented in a week or two of warm\r\nweather, and should be made and kept under cover.\r\n\r\nIf no more than five or six parts of muck to one of guano are employed,\r\nthe compost, according to the experience of Simon Brown, Esq., of the\r\nBoston _Cultivator_, (Patent Office Report for 1856), will prove\r\ninjurious, if placed in the hill in contact with seed, but may be\r\napplied broadcast without danger.\r\n\r\nThe _Menhaden_ or \"_White fish_\", so abundantly caught along our Sound\r\ncoast during the summer months, or any variety of fish may be composted\r\nwith muck, so as to make a powerful manure, with avoidance of the\r\nexcessively disagreeable stench which is produced when these fish are\r\nput directly on the land. Messrs. Stephen Hoyt & Sons, of New Canaan,\r\nConn., make this compost on a large scale. I cannot do better than to\r\ngive entire Mr. Edwin Hoyt's account of their operations, communicated\r\nto me several years ago.\r\n\r\n\"During the present season, (1858,) we have composted about 200,000\r\nwhite fish with about 700 loads (17,500 bushels) of muck. We vary the\r\nproportions somewhat according to the crop the compost is intended for.\r\nFor rye we apply 20 to 25 loads per acre of a compost made with 4,500\r\nfish, (one load) and with this manuring, no matter how poor the soil,\r\nthe rye will be as large as a man can cradle. Much of ours we have to\r\nreap. For oats we use less fish, as this crop is apt to lodge. For corn,\r\none part fish to ten or twelve muck is about right, while for grass or\r\nany top-dressing, the proportion of fish may be increased.\"\r\n\r\n\"We find it is best to mix the fish in the summer and not use the\r\ncompost until the next spring and summer. Yet we are obliged to use in\r\nSeptember for our winter rye a great deal of the compost made in July.\r\nWe usually compost the first arrivals of fish in June for our winter\r\ngrain; after this pile has stood three or four weeks, it is worked over\r\nthoroughly. In this space of time the fish become pretty well\r\ndecomposed, though they still preserve their form and smell\r\noutrageously. As the pile is worked over, a sprinkling of muck or\r\nplaster is given to retain any escaping ammonia. At the time of use in\r\nSeptember the fish have completely disappeared, bones and fins\r\nexcepted.\"\r\n\r\n\"The effect on the muck is to blacken it and make it more loose and\r\ncrumbly. As to the results of the use of this compost, we find them in\r\nthe highest degree satisfactory. We have raised 30 to 35 bushels of rye\r\nper acre on land that without it could have yielded 6 or 8 bushels at\r\nthe utmost. This year we have corn that will give 60 to 70 bushels per\r\nacre, that otherwise would yield but 20 to 25 bushels. It makes large\r\npotatoes, excellent turnips and carrots.\"\r\n\r\nFish compost thus prepared, is a uniform mass of fishy but not\r\nputrefactive odor, not disagreeable to handle. It retains perfectly all\r\nthe fertilizing power of the fish. Lands, manured with this compost,\r\nwill keep in heart and improve: while, as is well known to our coast\r\nfarmers, the use of fish alone is ruinous in the end, on light soils.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that _any other easily decomposing animal matters, as\r\nslaughter-house offal, soap boiler's scraps, glue waste, horn shavings,\r\nshoddy, castor pummace, cotton seed-meal, etc., etc._, may be composted\r\nin a similar manner, and that several or all these substances may be\r\nmade together into one compost.\r\n\r\nIn case of the composts with yard manure, guano and other animal\r\nmatters, the alkali, _ammonia_, formed in the fermentation, greatly\r\npromotes chemical change, and it would appear that this substance, on\r\nsome accounts, excels all others in its efficacy. The other alkaline\r\nbodies, _potash_, _soda_ and _lime_, are however scarcely less active in\r\nthis respect, and being at the same time, of themselves, useful\r\nfertilizers, they also may be employed in preparing muck composts.\r\n\r\n_Potash-lye_ and _soda-ash_ have been recommended for composting with\r\nmuck; but, although they are no doubt highly efficacious, they are too\r\ncostly for extended use.\r\n\r\nThe other alkaline materials that may be cheaply employed, and are\r\nrecommended, are _wood-ashes_, leached and unleached, _ashes of peat_,\r\n_shell marl_, (consisting of carbonate of lime,) _quick lime_, _gas\r\nlime_, and what is called \"_salt and lime mixture_.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the proportions to be used, no very definite rules can be\r\nlaid down; but we may safely follow those who have had experience in the\r\nmatter. Thus, to a cord of muck, which is about 100 bushels, may be\r\nadded, of unleached wood ashes twelve bushels, or of leached wood ashes\r\ntwenty bushels, or of peat ashes twenty bushels, or of marl, or of gas\r\nlime twenty bushels. Ten bushels of quick lime, slaked with water or\r\nsalt-brine previous to use, is enough for a cord of muck.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the above mentioned substances singly, any or all of\r\nthem may be employed together.\r\n\r\nThe muck should be as fine and free from lumps as possible, and must be\r\nintimately mixed with the other ingredients by shoveling over. The mass\r\nis then thrown up into a compact heap, which may be four feet high. When\r\nthe heap is formed, it is well to pour on as much water as the mass will\r\nabsorb, (this may be omitted if the muck is already quite moist,) and\r\nfinally the whole is covered over with a few inches of pure muck, so as\r\nto retain moisture and heat. If the heap is put up in the Spring, it may\r\nstand undisturbed for one or two months, when it is well to shovel it\r\nover and mix it thoroughly. It should then be built up again, covered\r\nwith fresh muck, and allowed to stand as before until thoroughly\r\ndecomposed. The time required for this purpose varies with the kind of\r\nmuck, and the quality of the other material used. The weather and\r\nthoroughness of intermixture of the ingredients also materially affect\r\nthe rapidity of decomposition. In all cases five or six months of summer\r\nweather is a sufficient time to fit these composts for application to\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanwood of Colebrook, Conn., says: \"I have found a compost made of\r\ntwo bushels of unleached ashes to twenty-five of muck, superior to\r\nstable manure as a top-dressing for grass, on a warm, dry soil.\"\r\n\r\nN. Hart, Jr., of West Cornwall, Conn., states: \"I have mixed 25 bushels\r\nof ashes with the same number of loads of muck, and applied it to 3/4 of\r\nan acre. The result was far beyond that obtained by applying 300 lbs.\r\nbest guano to the same piece.\"\r\n\r\nThe use of \"_salt and lime mixture_\" is so strongly recommended, that a\r\nfew words may be devoted to its consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen quick-lime is slaked with a brine of common salt (chloride of\r\nsodium), there are formed by double decomposition, small portions of\r\ncaustic soda and chloride of calcium, which dissolve in the liquid. If\r\nthe solution stand awhile, carbonic acid is absorbed from the air,\r\nforming carbonate of soda: but carbonate of soda and chloride of calcium\r\ninstantly exchange their ingredients, forming insoluble carbonate of\r\nlime and reproducing common salt.\r\n\r\nWhen the fresh mixture of quick-lime and salt is incorporated with _any\r\nporous body_, as soil or peat, then, as Graham has shown, _unequal\r\ndiffusion_ of the caustic soda and chloride of calcium occurs from the\r\npoint where they are formed, through the moist porous mass, and the\r\nresult is, that the small portion of caustic soda which diffuses most\r\nrapidly, or the carbonate of soda formed by its speedy union with\r\ncarbonic acid, is removed from contact with the chloride of calcium.\r\n\r\nSoda and carbonate of soda are more soluble in water and more strongly\r\nalkaline than lime. They, therefore, act on peat more energetically than\r\nthe latter. It is on account of the formation of soda and carbonate of\r\nsoda from the lime and salt mixture, that this mixture exerts a more\r\npowerful decomposing action than lime alone. Where salt is cheap and\r\nwood ashes scarce, the mixture may be employed accordingly to advantage.\r\nOf its usefulness we have the testimony of practical men.\r\n\r\nSays Mr. F. Holbrook of Vermont, (Patent Office Report for 1856, page\r\n193.) \"I had a heap of seventy-five half cords of muck mixed with lime\r\nin the proportion of a half cord of muck to a bushel of lime. The muck\r\nwas drawn to the field when wanted in August. A bushel of salt to six\r\nbushels of lime was dissolved in water enough to slake the lime down to\r\na fine dry powder, the lime being slaked no faster than wanted, and\r\nspread immediately while warm, over the layers of muck, which were about\r\nsix inches thick; then a coating of lime and so on, until the heap\r\nreached the height of five feet, a convenient width, and length enough\r\nto embrace the whole quantity of the muck. In about three weeks a\r\npowerful decomposition was apparent, and the heap was nicely overhauled,\r\nnothing more being done to it till it was loaded the next Spring for\r\nspreading. The compost was spread on the plowed surface of a dry sandy\r\nloam at the rate of about fifteen cords to the acre, and harrowed in.\r\nThe land was planted with corn and the crop was more than sixty bushels\r\nto the acre.\"\r\n\r\nOther writers assert that they \"have decomposed with this mixture, spent\r\ntan, saw dust, corn stalks, swamp muck, leaves from the woods, indeed\r\nevery variety of inert substance, and in _much shorter time than it\r\ncould be done by any other means_.\" (Working Farmer, Vol. III. p. 280.)\r\n\r\nSome experiments that have a bearing on the efficacy of this compost\r\nwill be detailed presently.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the soluble and more active (caustic) forms of\r\nalkaline bodies exert a powerful decomposing and solvent action on peat.\r\nIt is asserted too that the _nearly insoluble and less active matters of\r\nthis kind_, also have an effect, though a less complete and rapid one.\r\nThus, _carbonate of lime_ in the various forms of chalk, shell marl,[6]\r\nold mortar, leached ashes and peat ashes, (for in all these it is the\r\nchief and most \"alkaline\" ingredient,) is recommended to compost with\r\npeat. Let us inquire whether carbonate of lime can really exert any\r\nnoticeable influence in improving the fertilizing quality of peat.\r\n\r\nIn the case of vitriol peats, carbonate of lime is the cheapest and most\r\nappropriate means of destroying the noxious sulphate of protoxide of\r\niron, and correcting their deleterious quality. When carbonate of lime\r\nis brought in contact with sulphate of protoxide of iron, the two bodies\r\nmutually decompose, with formation of sulphate of lime (gypsum) and\r\ncarbonate of protoxide of iron. The latter substance absorbs oxygen from\r\nthe air with the utmost avidity, and passes into the peroxide of iron,\r\nwhich is entirely inert.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of any earthy matter with peat, will facilitate its\r\ndecomposition, and make it more active chemically, in so far as it\r\npromotes the separation of the particles of the peat from each other,\r\nand the consequent access of air. This benefit may well amount to\r\nsomething when we add to peat one-fifth of its bulk of marl or leached\r\nashes, but the question comes up: Do these insoluble mild alkalies exert\r\nany direct action? Would not as much soil of any kind be equally\r\nefficacious, by promoting to an equal degree the contact of oxygen from\r\nthe atmosphere?\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which carbonate of lime may exert a chemical\r\naction on the organic matters of peat. Carbonate of lime, itself, in the\r\nforms we have mentioned, is commonly called insoluble in water. It is,\r\nhowever, soluble to a very slight extent; it dissolves, namely, in about\r\n30,000 times its weight of pure water. It is nearly thirty times more\r\nsoluble in water saturated with carbonic acid; and this solution has\r\ndistinct alkaline characters. Since the water contained in a heap of\r\npeat must be considerably impregnated with carbonic acid, it follows\r\nthat when carbonate of lime is present, the latter must form a\r\nsolution, very dilute indeed, but still capable of some direct effect on\r\nthe organic matters of the peat, when it acts through a long space of\r\ntime. Again, it is possible that the solution of carbonate of lime in\r\ncarbonic acid, may act to liberate some ammonia from the soluble\r\nportions of the peat, and this ammonia may react on the remainder of the\r\npeat to produce the same effects as it does in the case of a compost\r\nmade with animal matters.\r\n\r\nWhether the effects thus theoretically possible, amount to anything\r\npractically important, is a question of great interest. It often happens\r\nthat opinions entertained by practical men, not only by farmers, but by\r\nmechanics and artisans as well, are founded on so untrustworthy a basis,\r\nare supported by trials so destitute of precision, that their accuracy\r\nmay well be doubted, and from all the accounts I have met with, it does\r\nnot seem to have been well established, practically, that composts made\r\nwith carbonate of lime, are better than the peat and carbonate used\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime (leached ashes, shell marl, etc.), is very well to use\r\n_in conjunction with_ peat, to furnish a substance or substances needful\r\nto the growth of plants, and supply the deficiencies of peat as regards\r\ncomposition. Although in the agricultural papers, numerous accounts of\r\nthe efficacy of such mixtures are given, we do not learn from them\r\nwhether these bodies exert any such good effect upon the peat itself, as\r\nto warrant the trouble of making a _compost_.\r\n\r\n4.--_Experiments by the author on the effect of alkaline bodies in\r\ndeveloping the fertilizing power of Peat._\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1862, the author undertook a series of experiments\r\nwith a view of ascertaining the effect of various composting materials\r\nupon peat.\r\n\r\nTwo bushels of peat were obtained from a heap that had been weathering\r\nfor some time on the \"Beaver Meadow,\" near New Haven. This was\r\nthoroughly air-dried, then crushed by the hand, and finally rubbed\r\nthrough a moderately fine sieve. In this way, the peat was brought to a\r\nperfectly homogeneous condition.\r\n\r\nTwelve-quart flower-pots, new from the warehouse, were filled as\r\ndescribed below; the trials being made in duplicate:--\r\n\r\nPots 1 and 2 contained each 270 grammes of peat.\r\n\r\nPots 3 and 4 contained each 270 grammes of peat, mixed-with 10 grammes\r\nof ashes of young grass.\r\n\r\nPots 5 and 6 contained each 270 grammes of peat, 10 grammes of ashes,\r\nand 10 grammes of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nPots 7 and 8 contained each 270 grammes of peat, 10 grammes of ashes,\r\nand 10 grammes of slaked (hydrate of) lime.\r\n\r\nPots 9 and 10 contained each 270 grammes of peat, 10 grammes of ashes,\r\nand 5 grammes of lime, slaked with strong solution of common salt.\r\n\r\nPots 11 and 12 contained each 270 grammes of peat, 10 grammes of ashes,\r\nand 3 grammes of Peruvian guano.\r\n\r\nIn each case the materials were thoroughly mixed together, and so much\r\nwater was cautiously added as served to wet them thoroughly. Five\r\nkernels of dwarf (pop) corn were planted in each pot, the weight of each\r\nplanting being carefully ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe pots were disposed in a glazed case within a cold grapery,[7] and\r\nwere watered when needful with pure water. The seeds sprouted duly, and\r\ndeveloped into healthy plants. The plants served thus as tests of the\r\nchemical effect of carbonate of lime, of slaked lime, and of salt and\r\nlime mixture, on the peat. The guano pots enabled making a comparison\r\nwith a well-known fertilizer. The plants were allowed to grow until\r\nthose best developed, enlarged above, not at the expense of the peat,\r\netc., but of their own lower leaves, as shown by the withering of the\r\nlatter. They were then cut, and, after drying in the air, were weighed\r\nwith the subjoined results.\r\n\r\n                 VEGETATION EXPERIMENTS IN PEAT COMPOSTS.\r\n KEY\r\n A - _Weight of crops in grammes._\r\n B - _Comparative weight of crops, the sum of 1. and 2. taken as unity._\r\n C - _Ratio of weight of crops to weight of seeds, the latter assumed\r\n     as unity._\r\n\r\n -------------------------------------------+---------------+----+-------\r\n _Nos._       _Medium of Growth._           |      A        |  B |    C\r\n -------------------------------------------+---------------+----+-------\r\n   1 }                                      |  1.61}        |    |\r\n   2 }  Peat alone.                         |  2.59}   4.20 |  1 |  2-1/2\r\n                                            |               |    |\r\n   3 }                                      | 14.19}        |    |\r\n   4 }  Peat, and ashes of grass,           | 18.25}  32.44 |  8 | 20-1/2\r\n                                            |               |    |\r\n   5 }                                      | 18.19}        |    |\r\n   6 }  Peat, ashes, and carbonate of lime, | 20.25}  38.44 |  9 | 25-1/2\r\n                                            |               |    |\r\n   7 }                                      | 21.49}        |    |\r\n   8 }  Peat, ashes, and slaked lime,       | 20.73}  42.22 | 10 | 28-1/2\r\n                                            |               |    |\r\n   9 }                                      | 23.08}        |    |\r\n  10 }  Peat, ashes, slaked lime, and salt, | 23.34}  46.42 | 11 | 30-1/2\r\n                                            |               |    |\r\n  11 }                                      | 26.79}        |    |\r\n  12 }  Peat, ashes, and Peruvian Guano,    | 26.99}  53.78 | 13 | 35-1/2\r\n -------------------------------------------+---------------+----+-------\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the above results. The experiments 1 and 2,\r\ndemonstrate that the peat itself is deficient in something needful to\r\nthe plant. In both pots, but 4.2 grammes of crop were produced, a\r\nquantity two and a half times greater than that of the seeds, which\r\nweighed 1.59 grammes. The plants were pale in color, slender, and\r\nreached a height of but about six inches.\r\n\r\nNos. 3 and 4 make evident what are some of the deficiencies of the peat.\r\nA supply of mineral matters, such as are contained in all plants, being\r\nmade by the addition of _ashes_, consisting chiefly of phosphates,\r\ncarbonates and sulphates of lime, magnesia and potash, a crop is\r\nrealized nearly eight times greater than in the previous cases; the\r\nyield being 32.44 grammes, or 20-1/2 times the weight of the seed. The\r\nquantity of ashes added, viz.:--10 grammes, was capable of supplying\r\nevery mineral element, greatly in excess of the wants of any crop that\r\ncould be grown in a quart of soil. The plants in pots 3 and 4 were much\r\nstouter than those in 1 and 2, and had a healthy color.\r\n\r\nThe experiments 5 and 6 appear to demonstrate that _carbonate of lime_\r\nconsiderably aided in converting the peat itself into plant-food. The\r\nashes alone contained enough carbonate of lime to supply the wants of\r\nthe plant in respect to that substance. More carbonate of lime could\r\nonly operate by acting on the organic matters of the peat. The amount of\r\nthe crop is raised by the effect of carbonate of lime from 32.44 to\r\n38.44 grammes, or from 20-1/2 to 25-1/2 times that of the seed.\r\n\r\nExperiments 7 and 8 show, that _slaked lime_ has more effect than the\r\ncarbonate, as we should anticipate. Its influence does not, however,\r\nexceed that of the carbonate very greatly, the yield rising from 38.44\r\nto 42.22 grammes, or from 25-1/2 to 28-1/2 times the weight of the seed.\r\nIn fact, quick-lime can only act as such for a very short space of time,\r\nsince it rapidly combines with the carbonic acid, which is supplied\r\nabundantly by the peat. In experiments 7 and 8, a good share of the\r\ninfluence exerted must therefore be actually ascribed to the carbonate,\r\nrather than to the quick-lime itself.\r\n\r\nIn experiments 9 and 10, we have proof that the \"_lime and salt\r\nmixture_\" has a greater efficacy than lime alone, the crop being\r\nincreased thereby from 42.22, to 46.42 grammes, or from 28-1/2 to 30-1/2\r\ntimes that of the seed.\r\n\r\nFinally, we see from experiments 11 and 12 that in all the foregoing\r\ncases it was a limited supply of _nitrogen_ that limited the crop; for,\r\non adding Peruvian guano, which could only act by this element (its\r\nother ingredients, phosphates of lime and potash, being abundantly\r\nsupplied in the ashes), the yield was carried up to 53.78 grammes, or\r\n35-1/2 times the weight of the seed, and 13 times the weight of the crop\r\nobtained from the unmixed peat.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--_The Examination of Peat (muck and marsh-mud) with reference to its\r\nAgricultural Value._\r\n\r\nSince, as we are forced to conclude, the variations in the composition\r\nof peat stand in no recognizable relations to differences of appearance,\r\nit is only possible to ascertain the value of any given specimen by\r\nactual trial or by chemical investigation.\r\n\r\nThe method _by practical trial_ is usually the cheaper and more\r\nsatisfactory of the two, though a half year or more is needful to gain\r\nthe desired information.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to apply to small measured plots of ground, each say\r\ntwo rods square, known quantities of the fresh, the weathered, and the\r\ncomposted peat in order, by comparison of the growth and _weight_ of the\r\ncrop, to decide the question of their value.\r\n\r\nPeat and its composts are usually applied at rates ranging from 20 to 40\r\nwagon or cart loads per acre. There being 160 square rods in the acre,\r\nthe quantity proper to a plot of two rods square (= four square rods,)\r\nwould be one half to one load.\r\n\r\nThe composts with stable manure and lime, or salt and lime mixture, are\r\nthose which, in general, it would be best to experiment with. From the\r\neffects of the stable manure compost, could be inferred with safety the\r\nvalue of any compost, of which animal manure is an essential ingredient.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of the practical trial on the small scale is, that\r\nthe adaptation of the peat or of the compost to the _peculiarities of\r\nthe soil_, is decided beyond a question.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that the results of experiments can\r\nonly be relied upon, when the plots are accurately measured, when the\r\npeat, etc., are applied in known quantities, and when the crops are\r\nseparately harvested and carefully weighed.\r\n\r\nIf experiments are made upon grass or clover, the gravest errors may\r\narise by drawing conclusions from the appearance of the standing crop.\r\nExperience has shown that two clover crops, gathered from contiguous\r\nplots differently manured, may strikingly differ in appearance, but\r\nyield the same amounts of hay.\r\n\r\nThe _chemical examination_ of a peat may serve to inform us, without\r\nloss of time, upon a number of important points.\r\n\r\nTo test a peat for _soluble iron salts_ which might render it\r\ndeleterious, we soak and agitate a handful for some hours, with four or\r\nfive times its bulk of warm soft water. From a _good fresh-water peat_\r\nwe obtain, by this treatment, a yellow liquid, more or less deep in\r\ntint, the taste of which is very slight and scarcely definable.\r\n\r\nFrom a _vitriol peat_ we get a dark-brown or black solution, which has a\r\nbitter, astringent, metallic or inky taste, like that of copperas.\r\n\r\n_Salt peat_ will yield a solution having the taste of salt-brine, unless\r\nit contains iron, when the taste of the latter will prevail.\r\n\r\nOn evaporating the water-solution to dryness and heating strongly in a\r\nChina cup, a _vitriol peat_ gives off white choking fumes of sulphuric\r\nacid, and there remains, after burning, brown-red oxide of iron in the\r\ndish.\r\n\r\nThe above testings are easily conducted by any one, with the ordinary\r\nconveniences of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThose that follow, require, for the most part, the chemical laboratory,\r\nand the skill of the practised chemist, for satisfactory execution.\r\n\r\nBesides testing for soluble iron compounds, as already indicated, the\r\npoints to be regarded in the chemical examination, are:--\r\n\r\n1st. _Water or moisture._--This must be estimated, because it is so\r\nvariable, and a knowledge of its quantity is needful, if we will compare\r\ntogether different samples. A weighed amount of the peat is dried for\r\nthis purpose at 212 deg. F., as long as it suffers loss.\r\n\r\n2d. The _proportions of organic matter and ash_ are ascertained by\r\ncarefully burning a weighed sample of the peat. By this trial we\r\ndistinguish between peat with 2 to 10 _per cent._ of ash and peaty soil,\r\nor mud, containing but a few _per cent._ of organic matter.\r\n\r\nThis experiment may be made in a rough way, but with sufficient accuracy\r\nfor common purposes, by burning a few lbs. or ozs. of peat upon a piece\r\nof sheet iron, or in a sauce pan, and noting the loss, which includes\r\nboth _water_ and _organic matter_.\r\n\r\n3d. As further regards the organic matters, we ascertain _the extent to\r\nwhich the peaty decomposition has taken place_ by boiling with dilute\r\nsolution of carbonate of soda. This solvent separates the humic and\r\nulmic acids from the undecomposed vegetable fibers.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes this treatment with carbonate of soda may be\r\ndispensed with, since the amount of undecomposed fiber is gathered with\r\nsufficient accuracy from careful inspection of the peat.\r\n\r\nSpecial examination of the organic acids is of no consequence in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge.\r\n\r\n4th. The _proportion of nitrogen_ is of the first importance to be\r\nascertained. In examinations of 30 samples of peat, I have found the\r\ncontent of nitrogen to range from 0.4 to 2.9 _per cent._, the richest\r\ncontaining seven times as much as the poorest. It is practically a\r\nmatter of great moment whether, for example, a Peruvian guano contains\r\n16 _per cent._ of nitrogen as it should, or but one-seventh that amount,\r\nas it may when grossly adulterated. In the same sense, it is important\r\nbefore making a heavy outlay in excavating and composting peat, to know\r\nwhether (as regards nitrogen) it belongs to the poorer or richer sorts.\r\nThis can only be done by the complicated methods known to the chemist.\r\n\r\n5th. The estimation of _ammonia_ (actual or ready-formed,) is a matter\r\nof scientific interest, but subordinate in a practical point of view.\r\n\r\n6th. _Nitric acid_ and _nitrates_ can scarcely exist in peat except\r\nwhere it is well exposed to the air, in a merely moist but not wet\r\nstate. Their estimation in composts is of great interest, though\r\ntroublesome to execute.\r\n\r\n7th. As regards the ash, its red color indicates _iron_. Pouring\r\nhydrochloric acid upon it, causes effervescence in the presence of\r\n_carbonate of lime_. This compound, in most cases, has been formed in\r\nthe burning, from humate and other organic salts of lime. _Sand_, or\r\n_clay_, being insoluble in the acid, remains, and may be readily\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric acid_ and alkalies, especially _potash_, are, next to lime,\r\nthe important ingredients of the ash. _Magnesia_ and _sulphuric acid_,\r\nrank next in value. Their estimation requires a number of tedious\r\noperations, and can scarcely be required for practical purposes, until\r\nmore ready methods of analyses shall have been discovered.\r\n\r\n8th. The quantity of _matters soluble in water_ has considerable\r\ninterest, but is not ordinarily requisite to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n6.--_Composition of Connecticut Peats_.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1857 and 1858, the author was charged by the Connecticut\r\nState Agricultural Society[8] with the chemical investigation of 33\r\nsamples of peat and swamp muck, sent to him in compliance with official\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages, the facts revealed by the laborious analyses\r\nexecuted on these samples, have been for the most part communicated,\r\ntogether with many valuable practical results derived from the\r\nexperience of the gentlemen who sent in the specimens. The analytical\r\ndata themselves appear to me to be worthy of printing again, for the\r\ninformation of those who may hereafter make investigations in the same\r\ndirection.--See Tables I, II, and III, p.p. 89, 90, and 91.\r\n\r\nThe specimens came in all stages of dryness. Some were freshly dug and\r\nwet, others had suffered long exposure, so that they were air-dry; some\r\nthat were sent in the moist state, became dry before being subjected to\r\nexamination; others were prepared for analysis while still moist.\r\n\r\nA sufficient quantity of each specimen was carefully pulverized,\r\nintermixed, and put into a stoppered bottle and thus preserved for\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe analyses were begun in the winter of 1857 by my assistant, Edward H.\r\nTwining, Esq. The samples 1 to 17 of the subjoined tables were then\r\nanalyzed. In the following year the work was continued on the remaining\r\nspecimens 18--33 by Dr. Robert A. Fisher. The method of analysis was the\r\nsame in both cases, except in two particulars.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier analyses, 1 to 17 inclusive, the treatment with carbonate\r\nof soda was not carried far enough to dissolve the whole of the soluble\r\norganic acids. It was merely attempted to make _comparative_\r\ndeterminations by treating all alike for the same time, and with the\r\nsame quantity of alkali. I have little doubt that in some cases not more\r\nthan one-half of the portion really soluble in carbonate of soda is\r\ngiven as such. In the later analyses, 18 to 33, however, the treatment\r\nwas continued until complete separation of the soluble organic acids was\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nBy acting on a peat for a long time with a hot solution of carbonate of\r\nsoda, there is taken up not merely a quantity of organic matter, but\r\ninorganic matters likewise enter solution. Silica, oxyd of iron and\r\nalumina are thus dissolved. In this process too, sulphate of lime is\r\nconverted into carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of these soluble inorganic matters has been determined\r\nwith approximate accuracy in analyses 18 to 33.\r\n\r\nIn the analyses 1 to 17 the collective amount of matters soluble in\r\nwater was determined. In the later analyses the proportions of organic\r\nand inorganic matters in the water-solution were separately estimated.\r\n\r\nThe process of analysis as elaborated and employed by Dr. Fisher and the\r\nauthor, is as follows:\r\n\r\nI. To prepare a sample for analysis, half a pound, more or less, of the\r\nsubstance is pulverized and passed through a wire sieve of 24 meshes to\r\nthe inch. It is then thoroughly mixed and bottled.\r\n\r\nII. 2 grammes of the above are dried (in tared watch-glasses) at the\r\ntemperature of 212 degrees, until they no longer decrease in weight. The\r\nloss sustained represents the _amount of water_, (according to MARSILLY,\r\nAnnales des Mines, 1857, XII., 404, peat loses carbon if dried at a\r\ntemperature higher than 212 degrees.)\r\n\r\nIII. The capsule containing the residue from I. is slowly heated to\r\nincipient redness, and maintained at that temperature until the organic\r\nmatter is entirely consumed. The loss gives the total amount of\r\n_organic_, the residue the total amount of _inorganic_ matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In peats containing sulphate of the protoxide of iron, the loss\r\nthat occurs during ignition is partly due to the escape of sulphuric\r\nacid, which is set free by the decomposition of the above mentioned salt\r\nof iron. But the quantity is usually so small in comparison with the\r\norganic matter, that it may be disregarded. The same may be said of the\r\ncombined water in the clay that is mixed with some mucks, which is only\r\nexpelled at a high temperature.\r\n\r\nIV. 3 grammes of the sample are digested for half an hour, with 200\r\ncubic centimeters (66.6 times their weight,) of boiling water, then\r\nremoved from the sand bath, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the\r\nclear liquid is decanted. This operation is twice repeated upon the\r\nresidue; the three solutions are mixed, filtered, concentrated, and\r\nfinally evaporated to dryness (in a tared platinum capsule,) over a\r\nwater bath. The residue, which must be dried at 212 degrees, until it\r\nceases to lose weight, gives the _total amount soluble in water_. The\r\ndried residue is then heated to low redness, and maintained at that\r\ntemperature until the organic matter is burned off. The loss represents\r\nthe amount of _organic matter soluble in water_, the ash gives the\r\nquantity of _soluble inorganic matter_.\r\n\r\nV. 1 gramme is digested for two hours, at a temperature just below the\r\nboiling point, with 100 cubic centimeters of a solution containing 5\r\n_per cent._ of crystallized carbonate of soda. It is then removed from\r\nthe sand bath and allowed to settle. When the supernatant liquid has\r\nbecome perfectly transparent, it is carefully decanted. This operation\r\nis repeated until all the organic matter soluble in this menstruum is\r\nremoved; which is accomplished as soon as the carbonate of soda solution\r\ncomes off colorless. The residue, which is to be washed with boiling\r\nwater until the washings no longer affect test papers, is thrown upon a\r\ntared filter, and dried at 212 degrees. It is the _total amount of\r\norganic and inorganic matter insoluble in carbonate of soda_. The loss\r\nthat it suffers upon ignition, indicates the amount of _organic matter_,\r\nthe ash gives the _inorganic_ matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The time required to insure perfect settling after digesting with\r\ncarbonate of soda solution, varies, with different peats, from 24 hours\r\nto several days. With proper care, the results obtained are very\r\nsatisfactory. Two analyses of No. 6, executed at different times, gave\r\n_total insoluble in carbonate of soda_--1st analysis 23.20 _per cent._;\r\n2d analysis 23.45 _per cent._ These residues yielded respectively 14.30\r\nand 14.15 _per cent._ of ash.\r\n\r\nVI. The quantity of _organic matter insoluble in water but soluble in\r\nsolution of carbonate of soda_, is ascertained by deducting the joint\r\nweight of the amounts soluble in water, and insoluble in carbonate of\r\nsoda, from the total amount of organic matter present. The _inorganic\r\nmatter insoluble in water, but soluble in carbonate of soda_, is\r\ndetermined by deducting the joint weight of the amounts of inorganic\r\nmatter soluble in water, and insoluble in carbonate of soda, from the\r\ntotal inorganic matter.\r\n\r\nVII. The amount of nitrogen is estimated by the combustion of 1 gramme\r\nwith soda-lime in an iron tube, collection of the ammonia in a standard\r\nsolution of sulphuric acid, and determination of the residual free acid\r\nby an equivalent solution of caustic potash and a few drops of tincture\r\nof cochineal as an indicator.\r\n\r\nThe results of the analyses are given in the following Tables. Table I.\r\ngives the direct results of analysis. In Table II. the analyses are\r\ncalculated on dry matter, and the nitrogen upon the organic matters.\r\nTable III. gives a condensed statement of the external characters and\r\nagricultural value[9] of the samples in their different localities, and\r\nthe names of the parties supplying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n TABLE I.-COMPOSITION OF CONNECTICUT PEATS AND MUCKS.\r\n\r\n KEY:\r\n A - _Soluble in water._\r\n B - _Insol. in water, but soluble in carbonate of soda._\r\n C - _Insol. in water and carbonate of soda._\r\n D - _Total._\r\n E - _Water._\r\n F - _Nitrogen._\r\n G - _Total matters soluble in water._\r\n\r\n -------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n                          |     ORGANIC MATTER.   |\r\n     _From Whom and       |-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n     Whence Received_     |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |\r\n -------------------------+~~~~~v~~~~~+-----+-----+\r\n  1.

The powdery or friable surface peat,\r\nwhich has been disintegrated by frost and exposure, is ordinarily\r\nuseless as fuel, unless it be rendered coherent by some mode of\r\npreparation. Unripe peat which contains much undecomposed moss or grass\r\nroots, which is therefore very light and porous, is in general too bulky\r\nto make an effective heating material before subjection to mechanical\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe best peat for burning, is that which is most free from visible fiber\r\nor undecomposed vegetable matters, which has therefore a homogeneous\r\nbrown or black aspect, and which is likewise free from admixture of\r\nearthy substances in the form of sand or clay. Such peat is unctuous\r\nwhen moist, shrinks greatly on drying, and forms hard and heavy masses\r\nwhen dry. It is usually found at a considerable depth, where it has been\r\nsubjected to pressure, and then has such consistence as to admit of\r\ncutting out in blocks; or it may exist as a black mud or paste at the\r\nbottom of bogs and sluices.\r\n\r\nThe value of peat as fuel stands in direct ratio to its content of\r\ncarbon. We have seen that this ranges from 51 to 63 _per cent. of the\r\norganic matter_, and the increase of carbon is related to its ripeness\r\nand density. The poorest, youngest peat, has the same proportion of\r\ncarbon as exists in wood. It does not, however, follow that its heating\r\npower is the same. The various kinds of wood have essentially the same\r\nproportion of carbon, but their heating power is very different. The\r\nclose textured woods--those which weigh the most per cord--make the best\r\nfuel for most purposes. We know, that a cord of hickory will produce\r\ntwice as much heat as a cord of bass-wood. Peat, though having the same\r\nor a greater proportion of carbon, is generally inferior to wood on\r\naccount of its occupying a greater bulk for a given weight, a necessary\r\nresult of its porosity. The best qualities of peat, or poor kinds\r\nartificially condensed, may, on the other hand, equal or exceed wood in\r\nheating power, bulk for bulk. One reason that peat is, in general,\r\ninferior to wood in heating effect, lies in its greater content of\r\nincombustible ash. Wood has but 0.5 to 1.5 _per cent._ of mineral\r\nmatters, while peat contains usually 5 to 10 _per cent._, and often\r\nmore. The oldest, ripest peats are those which contain the most carbon,\r\nand have at the same time the greatest compactness. From these two\r\ncircumstances they make the best fuel.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that peat which is light, loose in structure, and much\r\nmixed with clay or sand, is a poor or very poor article for producing\r\nheat: while a dense pure peat is very good.\r\n\r\nA great drawback to the usefulness of most kinds of peat-fuel, lies in\r\ntheir great friability. This property renders them unable to endure\r\ntransportation. The blocks of peat which are commonly used in most parts\r\nof Germany as fuel, break and crumble in handling, so that they cannot\r\nbe carried far without great waste. Besides, when put into a stove,\r\nthere can only go on a slow smouldering combustion as would happen in\r\ncut tobacco or saw-dust. A free-burning fuel must exist in compact lumps\r\nor blocks, which so retain their form and solidity, as to admit of a\r\nrapid draught of air through the burning mass.\r\n\r\nThe bulkiness of ordinary peat fuel, as compared with hard wood, and\r\nespecially with coal, likewise renders transportation costly, especially\r\nby water, where freights are charged by bulk and not by weight, and\r\nrenders storage an item of great expense.\r\n\r\nThe chief value of that peat fuel, which is simply cut from the bog, and\r\ndried without artificial condensation, must be for the domestic use of\r\nthe farmer or villager who owns a supply of it not far from his\r\ndwelling, and can employ his own time in getting it out. Though worth\r\nperhaps much less cord for cord when dry than hard wood, it may be\r\ncheaper for home consumption than fuel brought from a distance.\r\n\r\nVarious processes have been devised for preparing peat, with a view to\r\nbringing it into a condition of density and toughness, sufficient to\r\nobviate its usual faults, and make it compare with wood or even with\r\ncoal in heating power.\r\n\r\nThe efforts in this direction have met with abundant success as regards\r\nproducing a good fuel. In many cases, however, the cost of preparation\r\nhas been too great to warrant the general adoption of these processes.\r\nWe shall recur to this subject on a subsequent page, and give an\r\naccount of the methods that have been proposed or employed for the\r\nmanufacture of condensed peat fuel.\r\n\r\n2.--_Density of Peat._\r\n\r\nThe apparent[10] specific gravity of peat in the air-dry state, ranges\r\nfrom 0.11 to 1.03. In other words, a full cubic foot weighs from\r\none-tenth as much as, to slightly more than a cubic foot of water, =\r\n62-1/3 lbs. Peat, which has a specific gravity of but 0.25, may be and\r\nis employed as fuel. A full cubic foot of it will weigh about 16 lbs. In\r\nGermany, the cubic foot of \"good ordinary peat\" in blocks,[11] ranges\r\nfrom 15 to 25 lbs. in weight, and is employed for domestic purposes. The\r\nheavier peat, weighing 30 or more lbs. per cubic foot in blocks, is used\r\nfor manufacturing and metallurgical purposes, and for firing\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\nKarmarsch has carefully investigated more than 100 peats belonging to\r\nthe kingdom of Hanover, with reference to their heating effect. He\r\nclassifies them as follows:--\r\n\r\nA. _Turfy peat_, (_Rasentorf_,) consisting of slightly decomposed mosses\r\nand other peat-producing plants, having a yellow or yellowish-brown\r\ncolor, very soft, spongy and elastic, sp. gr. 0.11 to 0.26, the full\r\nEnglish cubic foot weighing from 7 to 16 lbs.\r\n\r\nB. _Fibrous peat_, unripe peat, which is brown or black in color, less\r\nelastic than turfy peat, the fibres either of moss, grass, roots,\r\nleaves, or wood, distinguishable by the eye, but brittle, and easily\r\nbroken; sp. gr. 0.24 to 0.67, the weight of a full cubic foot being from\r\n15 to 42 lbs.\r\n\r\nC. _Earthy peat._--Nearly or altogether destitute of fibrous structure,\r\ndrying to earth-like masses which break with more or less difficulty,\r\ngiving lustreless surfaces of fracture; sp. gr. 0.41 to 0.90, the full\r\ncubic foot weighing, accordingly, from 25 to 56 lbs.\r\n\r\nD. _Pitchy peat_, (_Pechtorf_,) dense; when dry, hard; often resisting\r\nthe blows of a hammer, breaking with a smooth, sometimes lustrous\r\nfracture, into sharp-angled pieces. Sp. gr. 0.62 to 1.03, the full cubic\r\nfoot weighing from 38 to 55 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn Kane and Sullivan's examination of 27 kinds of Irish peat, the\r\nspecific gravities ranged from 0.274 to 1.058.\r\n\r\n3.--_Heating power of peat as compared with wood and anthracite._\r\n\r\nKarmarsch found that in absolute heating effect\r\n\r\n 100 lbs. of turfy, air-dry peat, on the average = 95 lbs. of pine wood.\r\n  \"          fibrous       \"      \"        \"     = 108       \"       \"\r\n  \"          earthy        \"      \"        \"     = 104       \"       \"\r\n  \"          pitchy        \"      \"        \"     = 111       \"       \"\r\n\r\nThe comparison of heating power by bulk, instead of weight, is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n 100 cubic ft. of turfy peat, on the average[12] =  33 cubic ft. of pine\r\n                                                       wood, in sticks.\r\n   \"       \"      fibrous       \"       \"        =  90 cubic ft. of pine\r\n                                                       wood, in sticks.\r\n   \"       \"      earthy        \"       \"        = 145 cubic ft. of pine\r\n                                                       wood, in sticks.\r\n   \"       \"      pitchy        \"       \"        = 184 cubic ft. of pine\r\n                                                       wood, in sticks.\r\n\r\nAccording to Brix, the weight per English cord and relative heating\r\neffect of several air-dry peats--the heating power of an equal bulk of\r\noak wood being taken at 100 as a standard--are as follows, _bulk for\r\nbulk_:[13]\r\n\r\n                                                 _Weight per    _Heating\r\n                                                   cord._       effect._\r\n Oak wood                                          4150 lbs.       100\r\n Peat from Linum, 1st quality, dense and pitchy    3400  \"          70\r\n       \"     \"    2d     \"     fibrous             2900  \"          55\r\n       \"     \"    3d     \"     turfy               2270  \"          53\r\n Peat from Buechsenfeld, 1st quality, pitchy,\r\n      very hard and heavy                          3400 lbs.        74\r\n Peat from Buechsenfeld, 2d quality                2730  \"          64\r\n\r\nThese statements agree in showing, that, while weight for weight, the\r\nordinary qualities of peat do not differ much from wood in heating\r\npower; the heating effect of _equal bulks_ of this fuel, as found in\r\ncommerce, may vary extremely, ranging from one-half to three quarters\r\nthat of oak wood.\r\n\r\nCondensed peat may be prepared by machinery, which will weigh more than\r\nhard wood, bulk for bulk, and whose heating power will therefore exceed\r\nthat of wood.\r\n\r\nGysser gives the following comparisons of a good peat with various\r\nGerman woods and charcoals, equal weights being employed, and split\r\nbeech wood, air-dry, assumed as the standard.[14]\r\n\r\n Beech wood, split, air dry                                          1.00\r\n Peat, condensed by Weber's & Gysser's method,[15] air-dried,\r\n      with 25 _per cent._ moisture.                                  1.00\r\n Peat, condensed by Weber's & Gysser's method, hot-dried,\r\n      with 10 _per cent._ moisture.                                  1.48\r\n Peat-charcoal, from condensed peat.                                 1.73\r\n The same peat, simply cut and air-dried.                            0.80\r\n Beech-charcoal.                                                     1.90\r\n Summer-oak wood.                                                    1.18\r\n Birch wood.                                                         0.95\r\n White pine wood.                                                    0.72\r\n Alder.                                                              0.65\r\n Linden.                                                             0.65\r\n Red pine.                                                           0.61\r\n Poplar.                                                             0.50\r\n\r\nSome experiments have been made in this country on the value of peat as\r\nfuel. One was tried on the N. Y. Central Railroad, Jan. 3, 1866. A\r\nlocomotive with 25 empty freight cars attached, was propelled from\r\nSyracuse westward--the day being cold and the wind ahead--at the rate of\r\n16 miles the hour. The engineer reported that \"the peat gave us as much\r\nsteam as wood, and burnt a beautiful fire.\" The peat, we infer, was cut\r\nand prepared near Syracuse, N. Y.\r\n\r\nIn one of the pumping houses of the Nassau Water Department of the City\r\nof Brooklyn, an experiment has been made for the purpose of comparing\r\npeat with anthracite, for the results of which I am indebted to the\r\ncourtesy of Moses Lane, Esq., Chief Engineer of the Department.\r\n\r\nFire was started under a steam boiler with wood. When steam was up, the\r\npeat was burned--its quantity being 1743 lbs., or 18 barrels--and after\r\nit was consumed, the firing was continued with coal. The pressure of\r\nsteam was kept as nearly uniform as possible throughout the trial, and\r\nit was found that with 1743 lbs. of peat the engine made 2735\r\nrevolutions, while with 1100 lbs. of coal it made 3866 revolutions. In\r\nother words, 100 lbs. of coal produced 351-45/100 revolutions, and 100\r\nlbs. of peat produced 156-91/100 revolutions. One pound of coal\r\ntherefore equalled 2-24/100 lbs. of peat in heating effect. The peat\r\nburned well and generated steam freely.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane could not designate the quality of the peat, not having been\r\nable to witness the experiment.\r\n\r\nThese trials have not, indeed, all the precision needful to fix with\r\naccuracy the comparative heating effect of the fuels employed; for a\r\nfurnace, that is adapted for wood, is not necessarily suited to peat,\r\nand a coal grate must have a construction unlike that which is proper\r\nfor a peat fire; nevertheless they exhibit the relative merits of wood,\r\npeat, and anthracite, with sufficient closeness for most practical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nTwo considerations would prevent the use of ordinary cut peat in large\r\nworks, even could two and one-fourth tons of it be afforded at the same\r\nprice as one ton of coal. The Nassau Water Department consumes 20,000\r\ntons of coal yearly, the handling of which is a large expense, six\r\nfiremen being employed to feed the furnaces. To generate the same amount\r\nof steam with peat of the quality experimented with, would require the\r\nforce of firemen to be considerably increased. Again, it would be\r\nnecessary to lay in, under cover, a large stock of fuel during the\r\nsummer, for use in winter, when peat cannot be raised. Since a barrel of\r\nthis peat weighed less than 100 lbs., the short ton would occupy the\r\nvolume of 20 barrels; as is well known, a ton of anthracite can be put\r\ninto 8 barrels. A given weight of peat therefore requires 2-1/2 times as\r\nmuch storage room, as the same weight of coal. As 2-1/4 tons of peat, in\r\nthe case we are considering, are equivalent to but one ton of coal in\r\nheating effect, the winter's supply of peat fuel would occupy 5-5/8\r\ntimes the bulk of the same supply in coal, admitting that the unoccupied\r\nor air-space in a pile of peat is the same as in a heap of coal. In\r\nfact, the calculation would really turn out still more to the\r\ndisadvantage of peat, because the air-space in a bin of peat is greater\r\nthan in one of coal, and coal can be excavated for at least two months\r\nmore of the year than peat.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by some, that, because peat can be condensed so as to\r\napproach anthracite in specific gravity, it must, in the same ratio,\r\napproach the latter in heating power. Its effective heating power is,\r\nindeed, considerably augmented by condensation, but no mechanical\r\ntreatment can increase its percentage of carbon or otherwise alter its\r\nchemical composition; hence it must forever remain inferior to\r\nanthracite.\r\n\r\nThe composition and density of the best condensed peat is compared with\r\nthat of hard wood and anthracite in the following statement:--\r\n\r\n _In 100    _Carbon._ _Hydrogen._ _Oxygen and  _Ash._ _Water._ _Specific\r\n  parts._                           Nitrogen._                  Gravity._\r\n Wood,        39.6        4.8         34.8      0.8     20.0      0.75\r\n Condensed\r\n   peat       47.2        4.9         22.9      5.0     20.0      1.20\r\n Anthracite   91.3        2.9          2.8      3.0               1.40\r\n\r\nIn combustion in ordinary fires, the _water_ of the fuel is a source of\r\nwaste, since it consumes heat in acquiring the state of vapor. This is\r\nwell seen in the comparison of the same kind of peat in different states\r\nof dryness. Thus, in the table of Gysser, (page 97) Weber's condensed\r\npeat, containing 10 _per cent._ of moisture, surpasses in heating effect\r\nthat containing 25 _per cent._ of moisture, by nearly one-half.\r\n\r\nThe _oxygen_ is a source of waste, for heat as developed from fuel, is\r\nchiefly a result of the chemical union of atmospheric or free oxygen,\r\nwith the carbon and hydrogen of the combustible. The oxygen of the fuel,\r\nbeing already combined with carbon and hydrogen, not only cannot itself\r\ncontribute to the generation of heat, but neutralizes the heating effect\r\nof those portions of the carbon and hydrogen of the fuel with which it\r\nremains in combination. The quantity of heating effect thus destroyed,\r\ncannot, however, be calculated with certainty, because physical changes,\r\nviz: the conversion of solids into gases, not to speak of secondary\r\nchemical transformations, whose influence cannot be estimated, enter\r\ninto the computation.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen_ and ash are practically indifferent in the burning process,\r\nand simply impair the heating value of fuel in as far as they occupy\r\nspace in it and make a portion of its weight, to the exclusion of\r\ncombustible matter.\r\n\r\nAgain, as regards density, peat is, in general, considerably inferior to\r\nanthracite. The best uncondensed peat has a specific gravity of 0.90.\r\nCondensed peat usually does not exceed 1.1. Sometimes it is made of sp.\r\ngr. 1.3. Assertions to the effect of its acquiring a density of 1.8, can\r\nhardly be credited of pure peat, though a considerable admixture of sand\r\nor clay might give such a result.\r\n\r\nThe comparative heating power of fuels is ascertained by burning them in\r\nan apparatus, so constructed, that the heat generated shall expend\r\nitself in evaporating or raising the temperature of a known quantity of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_The amount of heat that will raise the temperature of one gramme of\r\nwater, one degree of the centigrade thermometer, is agreed upon as the\r\nunit of heat._[16]\r\n\r\nIn the complete combustion of carbon in the form of charcoal or\r\ngas-coal, there are developed 8060 units of heat. In the combustion of\r\none gramme of hydrogen gas, 34,210 units of heat are generated. The\r\nheating effect of hydrogen is therefore 4.2 times greater than that of\r\ncarbon. It was long supposed that the heating effect of compound\r\ncombustibles could be calculated from their elementary composition. This\r\nview is proved to be erroneous, and direct experiment is the only\r\nsatisfactory means of getting at the truth in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe data of Karmarsch, Brix, and Gysser, already given, were obtained by\r\nthe experimental method. They were, however, made mostly on a small\r\nscale, and, in some cases, without due regard to the peculiar\r\nrequirements of the different kinds of fuel, as regards fire space,\r\ndraught, etc. They can only be regarded as approximations to the truth,\r\nand have simply a comparative value, which is, however, sufficient for\r\nordinary purposes.\r\n\r\nThe general results of the investigations hitherto made on all the\r\ncommon kinds of fuel, are given in the subjoined statement. The\r\ncomparison is made in units of heat, and refers to equal weights of the\r\nmaterials experimented with.\r\n\r\n HEATING POWER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF FUEL.\r\n\r\n Air-dry Wood                               2800\r\n   \"     Peat                           2500    3000\r\n Perfectly dry Wood                         3600\r\n    \"       \"  Peat                     3000    4000\r\n Air-dry Lignite or Brown Coal          3300    4200\r\n Perfectly dry Lignite or Brown Coal    4000    5000\r\n Bituminous Coal                        3800    7000\r\n Anthracite                                 7500\r\n Wood Charcoal                          6300    7500\r\n Coke                                   6500    7600\r\n\r\n4.--_Modes of Burning Peat._\r\n\r\nIn the employment of peat fuel, regard must be had to its shape and\r\nbulk. Commonly, peat is cut or moulded into blocks or sods like bricks,\r\nwhich have a length of 8 to 18 inches; a breadth of 4 to 6 inches, and a\r\nthickness of 1-1/2 to 3 inches. Machine peat is sometimes formed into\r\ncircular disks of 2 to 3 inches diameter, and 1 to 2 inches thickness\r\nand thereabouts. It is made also in the shape of balls of 2 to 3 inches\r\ndiameter. Another form is that of thick-walled pipes, 2 to 3 inches in\r\ndiameter, a foot or more long, and with a bore of one-half inch.\r\n\r\nFlat blocks are apt to lie closely together in the fire, and obstruct\r\nthe draft. A fire-place, constructed properly for burning them, should\r\nbe shallow, not admitting of more than two or three layers being\r\nsuperposed. According to the bulkiness of the peat, the fire-place\r\nshould be roomy, as regards length and breadth.\r\n\r\nFibrous and easily crumbling peat is usually burned upon a hearth, _i.\r\ne._ without a grate, either in stoves or open fire-places. Dense peat\r\nburns best upon a grate, the bars of which should be thin and near\r\ntogether, so that the air have access to every part of the fuel. The\r\ndenser and tougher the peat, and the more its shape corresponds with\r\nthat usual to coal, the better is it adapted for use in our ordinary\r\ncoal stoves and furnaces.\r\n\r\n5.--_Burning of broken peat._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1--STAIR GRATE.]\r\n\r\nBroken peat--the fragments and waste of the cut or moulded blocks, and\r\npeat as obtained by plowing and harrowing the surface of drained\r\npeat-beds--may be used to advantage in the _stair grate_, fig. 1, which\r\nwas introduced some years ago in Austria, and is adapted exclusively for\r\nburning finely divided fuel. It consists of a series of thin iron bars 3\r\nto 4 inches wide, _a_, _a_, _a_, ... which are arranged above each other\r\nlike steps, as shown in the figure. They are usually half as long as the\r\ngrate is wide, and are supported at each end by two side pieces or\r\nwalls, _l._ Below, the grate is closed by a heavy iron plate. The fuel\r\nis placed in the hopper _A_, which is kept filled, and from which it\r\nfalls down the incline as rapidly as it is consumed. The air enters from\r\nthe space _G_, and is regulated by doors, not shown in the cut, which\r\nopen into it. The masonry is supported at _u_, by a hollow iron beam.\r\nBelow, a lateral opening serves for clearing out the ashes. The effect\r\nof the fire depends upon the width of the throat of the hopper at _u_,\r\nwhich regulates the supply of fuel to the grate, and upon the\r\ninclination of the latter. The throat is usually from 6 to 8 inches\r\nwide, according to the nature of the fuel. The inclination of the grate\r\nis 40 to 45 deg. and, in general, should be that which is assumed by the\r\nsides of a pile of the fuel to be burned, when it is thrown up into a\r\nheap. This grate ensures complete combustion of fuel that would fall\r\nthrough ordinary grates, and that would merely smoulder upon a hearth.\r\nThe fire admits of easy regulation, the ashes may be removed and the\r\nfuel may be supplied without _checking the fire_. Not only broken peat,\r\nbut coal dust, saw dust, wood turnings and the like may be burned on\r\nthis grate. The figure represents it as adapted to a steam boiler.\r\n\r\n6.--_Hygroscopic water of peat fuel._\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water retained by air-dried peat appears to be the same\r\nas exists in air-dried wood, viz., about 20 _per cent._ The proportion\r\nwill vary however according to the time of seasoning. In thoroughly\r\nseasoned wood or peat, it may be but 15 _per cent._; while in the poorly\r\ndried material it may amount to 25 or more _per cent._ When _hot-dried_,\r\nthe proportion of water may be reduced to 10 _per cent._, or less.\r\n\r\nWhen peat is still moist, it gathers water rapidly from damp air, and in\r\nthis condition has been known to burst the sheds in which it was stored,\r\nbut after becoming dry to the eye and feel, it is but little affected by\r\ndampness, no more so, it appears, than seasoned wood.\r\n\r\n7.--_Shrinkage._\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value and cost of peat fuel, it must be remembered\r\nthat peat shrinks greatly in drying, so that three to five cords of\r\nfresh peat yield but one cord of dry peat. When the fiber of the peat is\r\nbroken by the hand, or by machinery, the shrinkage is often much\r\ngreater, and may sometimes amount to seven-eighths of the original\r\nvolume.--_Dingler's Journal, Oct. 1864_, _S._ 68.\r\n\r\nThe difference in weight between fresh and dry peat is even greater.\r\nFibrous peat, fresh from the bog, may contain ninety _per cent._ of\r\nwater, of which seventy _per cent._ must evaporate before it can be\r\ncalled dry. The proportion of water in earthy or pitchy peat is indeed\r\nless; but the quantity is always large, so that from five to nine\r\nhundred weight of fresh peat must be lifted in order to make one hundred\r\nweight of dry fuel.\r\n\r\n8.--_Time of excavation, and drying._\r\n\r\nPeat which is intended to be used after simply drying, must be excavated\r\nso early in the season that it shall become dry before frosty weather\r\narrives: because, if frozen when wet, its coherence is destroyed, and on\r\nthawing it falls to a powder useless for fuel.\r\n\r\nPeat must be dried with certain precautions. If a block of fresh peat be\r\nexposed to hot sunshine, it dries and shrinks on the surface much more\r\nrapidly than within: as a consequence it cracks, loses its coherence,\r\nand the block is easily broken, or of itself falls to pieces. In Europe,\r\nit is indeed customary to dry peat without shelter, the loss by too\r\nrapid drying not being greater than the expense of building and\r\nmaintaining drying sheds. There however the sun is not as intense, nor\r\nthe air nearly so dry, as it is here. Even there, the occurrence of an\r\nunusually hot summer, causes great loss. In our climate, some shelter\r\nwould be commonly essential unless the peat be dug early in the spring,\r\nso as to lose the larger share of its water before the hot weather; or,\r\nas would be best of all, in the autumn late enough to escape the heat,\r\nbut early enough to ensure such dryness as would prevent damage by\r\nfrost. The peculiarities of climate must decide the time of excavating\r\nand the question of shelter.\r\n\r\nThe point in drying peat is to make it lose its water gradually and\r\nregularly, so that the inside of each block shall dry nearly as fast as\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\nSome of the methods of hot-drying peat, will be subsequently noticed.\r\n\r\nSummer or fall digging would be always advantageous on account of the\r\nswamps being then most free from water. In Bavaria, peat is dug mostly\r\nin July and the first half of August.\r\n\r\n9.--_Drainage._\r\n\r\nWhen it is intended to raise peat fuel _in the form of blocks_, the bog\r\nshould be drained no more rapidly than it is excavated. Peat, which is\r\nto be worth cutting in the spring, must be covered with water during the\r\nwinter, else it is pulverized by the frost. So, too, it must be\r\nprotected against drying away and losing its coherency in summer, by\r\nbeing kept sufficiently impregnated with water.\r\n\r\nIn case an extensive bog is to be drained to facilitate the cutting out\r\nof the peat for use as fuel, the canals that carry off the water from\r\nthe parts which are excavating, should be so constructed, that on the\r\napproach of cold weather, the remaining peat may be flooded again to the\r\nusual height.\r\n\r\nIn most of the smaller swamps, systematic draining is unnecessary, the\r\nwater drying away in summer enough to admit of easy working.\r\n\r\nIn some methods of preparing or condensing peat by machinery, it is best\r\nor even needful to drain and air-dry the peat, preliminary to working.\r\nBy draining, the peat settles, especially on the borders of the ditches,\r\nseveral inches, or even feet, according to its nature and depth. It thus\r\nbecomes capable of bearing teams and machinery, and its density is very\r\nconsiderably augmented.\r\n\r\n10.--_The Cutting of Peat._--a. _Preparations._\r\n\r\nIn preparing to raise peat fuel from the bog, the surface material,\r\nwhich from the action of frost and sun has been pulverized to \"muck,\" or\r\nwhich otherwise is full of roots and undecomposed matters, must be\r\nremoved usually to the depth of 12 to 18 inches. It is only those\r\nportions of the peat which have never frozen nor become dry, and are\r\nfree from coarse fibers of recent vegetation, that can be cut for fuel.\r\n\r\nPeat fuel must be brought into the form of blocks or masses of such size\r\nand shape as to adapt them to use in our common stoves and furnaces.\r\nCommonly, the peat is of such consistence in its native bed, that it may\r\nbe cut out with a spade or appropriate tool into blocks having more or\r\nless coherence. Sometimes it is needful to take away the surplus water\r\nfrom the bog, and allow the peat to settle and drain a while before it\r\ncan be cut to advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen a bog is to be opened, a deep ditch is run from an outlet or lowest\r\npoint a short distance into the peat bed, and the working goes on from\r\nthe banks of this ditch. It is important that system be followed in\r\nraising the peat, or there will be great waste of fuel and of labor.\r\n\r\nIf, as often happens, the peat is so soft in the wet season as to break\r\non the vertical walls of a ditch and fill it, at the same time\r\ndislocating the mass and spoiling it for cutting, it is best to carry\r\ndown the ditch in terraces, making it wide above and narrow at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nb. _Cutting by hand._\r\n\r\nThe simplest mode of procedure, consists in laying off a \"field\" or plot\r\nof, say 20 feet square, and making vertical cuts with a sharp spade\r\nthree or four inches deep from end to end in parallel lines, as far\r\napart as it is proposed to make the breadth of the peats or sods,\r\nusually four to five inches. Then, the field is cut in a similar manner\r\nin lines at right angles to the first, and at a distance that shall be\r\nthe length of the peats, say 18 to 20 inches. Finally, the workman lifts\r\nthe peats by horizontal thrusts of his spade, made at a depth of three\r\ninches. The sods as lifted, are placed on a light barrow or upon a board\r\nor rack, and are carried off to a drying ground, near at hand, where\r\nthey are laid down flatwise to drain and dry. In Ireland, it is the\r\ncustom, after the peats have lain thus for a fortnight or so, to \"foot\"\r\nthem, i. e. to place them on end close together; after further drying\r\nthe \"footing\" is succeeded by \"clamping,\" which is building the sods up\r\ninto stacks of about twelve to fifteen feet long, four feet wide at\r\nbottom, narrowing to one foot at top, with a height of four to five\r\nfeet. The outer turfs are inclined so as to shed the rain. The peat\r\noften remains in these clamps on the bog until wanted for use, though in\r\nrainy seasons the loss by crumbling is considerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--GERMAN PEAT-KNIFE.]\r\n\r\nOther modes of lifting peat, require tools of particular construction....\r\nIn Germany it is common to excavate by _vertical_ thrusts of the tool,\r\nthe cutting part of which is represented above, fig. 2. This tool is\r\npressed down into the peat to a depth corresponding to the thickness of\r\nthe required block: its three edges cut as many sides of the block, and\r\nthe bottom is then broken or torn out by a prying motion.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, this or a similar tool is forced down by help of the\r\nfoot as deeply into the peat as possible by a workman standing above,\r\nwhile a second man in the ditch cuts out the blocks of proper thickness\r\nby means of a sharp spade thrust horizontally. When the peats are taken\r\nout to the depth of the first vertical cutting, the knife is used again\r\nfrom above, and the process is thus continued as before, until the\r\nbottom of the peat or the desired depth is reached.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, is employed the \"slane,\" a common form of which is shown in\r\nfig. 3, it being a long, narrow and sharp spade, 20 inches by six, with\r\na wing at right angles to the blade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--IRISH SLANE.]\r\n\r\nThe peats are cut by one thrust of this instrument which is worked by\r\nthe arms alone. After a vertical cut is made by a spade, in a line at\r\nright angles to a bank of peat, the slane cuts the bottom and other side\r\nof the block; while at the end the latter is simply lifted or broken\r\naway.\r\n\r\nPeat is most easily cut in a vertical direction, but when, as often\r\nhappens, it is made up of layers, the sods are likely to break apart\r\nwhere these join. Horizontal cutting is therefore best for stratified\r\npeat.\r\n\r\n_System employed in East Friesland._--In raising peat, great waste both\r\nof labor and of fuel may easily occur as the result of random and\r\nunsystematic methods of working. For this reason, the mode of cutting\r\npeat, followed in the extensive moors of East Friesland, is worthy of\r\nparticular description. There, the business is pursued systematically on\r\na plan, which, it is claimed, long experience[17] has developed to such\r\nperfection that the utmost economy of time and labor is attained. The\r\ncost of producing marketable peat in East Friesland in 1860, was one\r\nsilver groschen=about 2-1/2 cents, per hundred weight; while at that\r\ntime, in Bavaria, the hundred weight cost three times as much when fit\r\nfor market; and this, notwithstanding living and labor are much cheaper\r\nin the latter country.\r\n\r\nThe method to be described, presupposes that the workmen are not\r\nhindered by water, which, in most cases, can be easily removed from the\r\nhigh-moors of the region. The peat is worked in long stretches of 10\r\nfeet in width, and 100 to 1000 paces in length: each stretch or plot is\r\nexcavated at once to a considerable depth and to its full width. Each\r\nsuccessive year the excavation is widened by 10 feet, its length\r\nremaining the same. Sometimes, unusual demand leads to more rapid\r\nworking; but the width of 10 feet is adhered to for each cutting, and,\r\non account of the labor of carrying the peats, it is preferred to extend\r\nthe length rather than the width.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the peat bed has been opened by a previous cutting, to the\r\ndepth of 5-1/2 feet, and the surface muck and light peat, 1-1/2 feet\r\nthick, have been thrown into the excavation of the year before--a new\r\nplot is worked by five men as follows.\r\n\r\nOne man, the \"Bunker,\" removes from the surface, about two inches of\r\npeat, disintegrated by the winter's frost, throwing it into last year's\r\nditch.\r\n\r\nFollowing him, come two \"Diggers,\" of whom one stands on the surface of\r\nthe peat, and with a heavy, long handled tool, cuts out the sides and\r\nend of the blocks, which are about seventeen by five inches; while the\r\nother stands in the ditch, and by horizontal thrusts of a light, sharp\r\nspade, removes the sods, each of five and a half inches thickness, and\r\nplaces them on a small board near by. Each block of peat has the\r\ndimensions of one fourth of a cubic foot, and weighs about 13 pounds.\r\nTwo good workmen will raise 25 such peats, or 6-1/4 cubic feet, per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nA fourth man, the \"Loader,\" puts the sods upon a wheel-barrow, always\r\ntwo rows of six each, one upon the other, and--\r\n\r\nA fifth, the \"Wheeler,\" removes the load to the drying ground, and with\r\nsome help from the Bunker, disposes them flatwise in rows of 16 sods\r\nwide, which run at right angles to the ditch, and, beginning at a little\r\nmore than 10 feet from the latter, extend 50 feet.\r\n\r\nThe space of 10 feet between the plot that is excavating, and the drying\r\nground, is, at the same time, cleared of the useless surface muck by the\r\nBunker, in preparation for the next year's work.\r\n\r\nWith moderate activity, the five men will lift and lay out 12,000 sods\r\n(3000 cubic feet,) daily, and it is not uncommon that five first-rate\r\nhands get out 16,800 peats (4200 cubic feet,) in this time.\r\n\r\nA gang of five men, working as described, suffices for cutting out a bed\r\nof four feet of solid peat. When the excavation is to be made deeper, a\r\nsixth man, the \"Hanker,\" is needful for economical work; and with his\r\nhelp the cutting may be extended down to nine and a half feet; i. e.\r\nthrough eight feet of solid peat. The cutting is carried down at first,\r\nfour feet as before, but the peats are carried 50 feet further, in order\r\nto leave room for those to be subsequently lifted. The \"Hanker\" aids\r\nhere, with a second wheel-barrow. In taking out the lower peat, the\r\n\"Hanker\" stands on the bottom of the first excavation, receives the\r\nblocks from the Diggers, on a broad wooden shovel, and hands them up to\r\nthe Loader; while the Wheeler, having only the usual distance to carry\r\nthem, lays them out in the drying rows without difficulty.\r\n\r\nAfter a little drying in the rows, the peats are gradually built up into\r\nnarrow piles, like a brick wall of one and a half bricks thickness.\r\nThese piles are usually raised by women. They are made in the spaces\r\nbetween the rows, and are laid up one course at a time, so that each\r\nblock may dry considerably, before it is covered by another. A woman can\r\nlay up 12,000 peats daily--the number lifted by 5 men--and as it\r\nrequires about a month of good weather to give each course time (two\r\ndays) to dry, she is able to pile for 30 gangs of workmen. If the\r\nweather be very favorable, the peats may be stacked or put into sheds,\r\nin a few days after the piling is finished. Stacking is usually\r\npractised. The stacks are carefully laid up in cylindrical form, and\r\ncontain 200 to 500 cubic feet. When the stacks are properly built, the\r\npeat suffers but little from the weather.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schroeder, from whose account (Dingler's Polytechnisches\r\nJournal, Bd. 156, S. 128) the above statements are derived, the peats\r\nexcavated under his direction, in drying thoroughly, shrank to about\r\none-fourth of their original bulk (became 12 inches x 3 inches x 3\r\ninches,) and to one-seventh or one-eighth of their original weight.\r\n\r\nc. _Machines for Cutting Peat._\r\n\r\nIn North Prussia, the Peat Cutting Machine of Brosowsky, see fig. 4, is\r\nextensively employed. It consists of a cutter, made like the four sides\r\nof a box, but with oblique edges, _a_, which by its own weight, and by\r\nmeans of a crank and rack-work, operated by men, is forced down into the\r\npeat to a depth that may reach 20 feet. It can cut only at the edge of a\r\nditch or excavation, and when it has penetrated sufficiently, a spade\r\nlike blade, _d_, is driven under the cutter by means of levers _c_, and\r\nthus a mass is loosened, having a vertical length of 10 feet or more,\r\nand whose other dimensions are about 24 x 28 inches. This is lifted by\r\nreversing the crank motion, and is then cut up by the spade into blocks\r\nof 14 inches x 6 inches x 5 inches. Each parallelopipedon of peat, cut\r\nto a depth of 10 feet, makes 144 sods, and this number can be cut in\r\nless than 10 minutes. Four hands will cut and lay out to dry, 12,000 to\r\n14,000 peats daily, or 3100 cubic feet. One great advantage of this\r\nmachine consists in the circumstance that it can be used to raise peat\r\nfrom below the surface of water, rendering drainage in many cases\r\nunnecessary. Independently of this, it appears to be highly labor\r\nsaving, since 1300 machines were put to use in Mecklenburg and Pomerania\r\nin about 5 years from its introduction. The Mecklenburg moors are now\r\ntraversed by canals, cut by this machine, which are used for the\r\ntransportation of the peat to market.[18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--BROSOWSKY'S PEAT CUTTER.]\r\n\r\nLepreux in Paris, has invented a similar but more complicated machine,\r\nwhich is said to be very effective in its operation. According to Herve\r\nMangon, this machine, when worked by two men, raises and cuts 40,000\r\npeats daily, of which seven make one cubic foot, equal to 5600\r\ncubic feet. The saving in expense by using this machine[19] is said to\r\nbe 70 _per cent._, when the peat to be raised is under water.\r\n\r\n11.--_The Dredging of Peat._\r\n\r\nWhen peat exists, not as a coherent more or less fibrous mass, but as a\r\npaste or mud, saturated with water, it cannot be raised and formed by\r\nthe methods above described.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the peat is dredged from the bottom of the bog by means of\r\nan iron scoop, like a pail with sharp upper edges, which is fastened to\r\na long handle. The bottom is made of coarse sacking, so that the water\r\nmay run off. Sometimes, a stout ring of iron with a bag attached, is\r\nemployed in the same way. The fine peat is emptied from the dredge upon\r\nthe ground, where it remains, until the water has been absorbed or has\r\nevaporated, so far as to leave the mass somewhat firm and plastic. In\r\nthe mean time, a drying bed is prepared by smoothing, and, if needful,\r\nstamping a sufficient space of ground, and enclosing it in boards 14\r\ninches wide, set on edge. Into this bed the partially dried peat is\r\nthrown, and, as it cracks on the surface by drying, it is compressed by\r\nblows with a heavy mallet or flail, or by treading it with flat boards,\r\nattached to the feet, somewhat like snow shoes. By this treatment the\r\nmass is reduced to a continuous sheet of less than one-half its first\r\nthickness, and becomes so firm, that a man's step gives little\r\nimpression in it. The boards are now removed, and it is cut into blocks\r\nby means of a very thin, sharp spade. Every other block being lifted out\r\nand placed crosswise upon those remaining, air is admitted to the whole\r\nand the drying goes on rapidly. This kind of peat is usually of\r\nexcellent quality. In North Germany it is called \"Baggertorf,\" i. e.\r\nmud-peat.\r\n\r\nPeat is sometimes dredged by machinery, as will be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\n12.--_The Moulding of Peat._\r\n\r\nWhen black, earthy or pitchy peat cannot be cut, and is not so saturated\r\nwith water as to make a mud; it is, after raking or picking out roots,\r\netc., often worked into a paste by the hands or feet, with addition of\r\nwater, until it can be formed into blocks which, by slow drying, acquire\r\ngreat firmness. In Ireland this product is termed \"hand-peat.\" In\r\nGermany it is called \"Formtorf,\" _i. e._ moulded peat, or \"Backtorf,\"\r\n_i. e._ baked peat.\r\n\r\nThe shaping is sometimes accomplished by plastering the soft mass into\r\nwooden moulds, as in making bricks.\r\n\r\n13.--_Preparation of Peat Fuel by Machinery, etc._\r\n\r\nWithin the last 15 years, numerous inventions have been made with a view\r\nto improving the quality of peat fuel, as well as to expedite its\r\nproduction. These inventions are directed to the following points, viz.:\r\n1. _Condensation_ of the peat, so as bring more fuel into a given space,\r\nthus making it capable of giving out an intenser heat; at the same time\r\nincreasing its hardness and toughness, and rendering it easier and more\r\neconomical of transportation. 2. _Drying_ by artificial heat or reducing\r\nthe amount of water from 20 or 25 _per cent._ to half that quantity or\r\nless. This exalts the heating power in no inconsiderable degree. 3.\r\n_Charring._ Peat-charcoal is as much better than peat, for use where\r\nintense heat is required, as wood charcoal is better than wood. 4.\r\n_Purifying from useless matters._ Separation of earthy admixtures which\r\nare incombustible and hinder draught.\r\n\r\nA.--_Condensation by Pressure._\r\n\r\n_Pressing Wet Peat._--The condensation of peat was first attempted by\r\nsubjecting the fresh, wet material, to severe pressure. As long ago as\r\nthe year 1821, Pernitzsch, in Saxony, prepared peat by this method, and\r\nshortly afterwards Lord Willoughby d'Eresby, in Scotland, and others,\r\nadopted the same principle. Simple pressure will, indeed, bring fresh\r\npeat at once into much smaller bulk; but, if the peat be fibrous and\r\nlight, and for this reason require condensation, it is also elastic,\r\nand, when the pressure is relieved, it acquires again much of its\r\noriginal volume.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, although pressure will squeeze out much water from a\r\nsaturated well-ripened peat, the complete drying of the pressed blocks\r\nusually requires as much or more time than that of the unpressed\r\nmaterial, on account of the closeness of texture of the surface produced\r\nby the pressure.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of subjecting fresh peat to pressure in the ordinary\r\npresses, it is found, are more than offset by the expense of the\r\noperation, and it is therefore unnecessary to give the subject further\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nFresh peat appears however to have been advantageously pressed by other\r\nmechanical means. Two methods require notice.\r\n\r\n_Mannhardt's Method_, invented about the year 1858, has been practically\r\napplied on the large scale at _Schleissheim_, Bavaria. Mannhardt's\r\nmachine consists of two colossal iron rolls, each of 15 feet diameter,\r\nand 6-1/2 feet length, geared into each other so as to revolve\r\nhorizontally in opposite directions and with equal velocity. These rolls\r\nare hollow, their circumference consists of stout iron plate perforated\r\nwith numerous small holes, and is supported by iron bars which connect\r\nthe ends of the roll, having intervals between them of about one inch.\r\nEach roll is covered by an endless band of hair cloth, stretched over\r\nand kept in place by rollers. The rolls are operated by a steam engine\r\nof 12 horse power. The fresh peat is thrown into a hopper, and passing\r\nbetween the rolls, loses a considerable share of its water, issuing as a\r\nbroad continuous sheet, which is divided into blocks by an arrangement\r\npresently to be described. The cloth, covering the rolls, must have\r\ngreat strength, sufficient porosity to allow water to pass it freely,\r\nand such closeness of texture as to retain the fine particles of peat.\r\nMany trials have led to the use of a fabric, specially made for the\r\npurpose, of goat's hair. The cloth for each pair of rolls, costs $160.\r\n\r\nThe peat at Schleissheim is about 5 feet in depth, and consists of a\r\ndark-brown mud or paste, free from stones and sticks, and penetrated\r\nonly by fine fibers. The peat is thrown up on the edge of a ditch, and\r\nafter draining, is moved on a tram-way to the machine. It is there\r\nthrown upon a chain of buckets, which deliver it at the hopper above the\r\nrolls. The rolls revolve once in 7-1/3 minutes and at each revolution\r\nturn out a sheet of peat, which cuts into 528 blocks. Each block has,\r\nwhen moist, a length of about 12 inches, by 5 inches of width and 1-1/4\r\ninches of thickness, and weighs on the average 1-1/2 lbs. The water that\r\nis pressed out of the peat, falls within the rolls and is conducted\r\naway; it is but slightly turbid from suspended particles. The band of\r\npressed peat is divided in one direction as it is formed, by narrow\r\nslats which are secured horizontally to the press-cloth, at about 5\r\ninches distance from each other. The further division of the peat is\r\naccomplished by a series of six circular saws, under which the peat is\r\ncarried as it is released from the rolls, by a system of endless cords\r\nstrung over rollers. These cords run parallel until the peat passes the\r\nsaws; thenceforth they radiate, so that the peat-blocks are separated\r\nsomewhat from each other. They are carried on until they reach a roll,\r\nover which they are delivered upon drying lattices. The latter move\r\nregularly under the roll; the peats arrange themselves upon them\r\nedgewise, one leaning against the other, so as to admit of free\r\ncirculation of air. The lattices are loaded upon cars, and moved on a\r\ntram-way to the drying ground, where they are set up in frames.\r\n\r\nThe peat-cake separates well from the press-cloths; but the pores of the\r\nlatter become somewhat choked by fine particles that penetrate them.\r\nThey are therefore washed at each revolution by passing before a pipe\r\nfrom which issue, against them, a number of jets of water under high\r\npressure. The blocks, after leaving the machine, are soft, and require 5\r\nor 6 days to become air-dry. When dry they are dense and of good\r\nquality, but not better than the same raw material yields by simple\r\nmoulding. The capacity of the rolls, which easily turn out 100,000 peats\r\nin 24 hours, greatly exceeds at present that of the drying arrangements,\r\nand for this reason the works are not, as yet, remunerative. The rolls\r\nare, in reality, a simple forming machine. The pressure they exert on\r\nthe peat, is but inconsiderable, owing to its soft pasty character; and\r\nsince the pair of rolls costs $8000 and can only be worked 3 to 4\r\nmonths, this method must be regarded rather as an ingenious and\r\ninstructive essay in the art of making peat-fuel, than as a practical\r\nsuccess. The persevering efforts of the inventor may yet overcome all\r\ndifficulties and prove the complete efficacy of the method. It is\r\nespecially important, that blocks of greater thickness should be\r\nproduced, since those now made, pack together too closely in the fire.\r\n\r\n_Neustadt Method._--At Neustadt, in Hanover, a loose-textured fibrous\r\npeat was prepared for metallurgical use in 1860, by passing through iron\r\nrolls of ordinary construction. The peat was thereby reduced two-thirds\r\nin bulk, burned more regularly, gave a coherent coal, and withstood\r\ncarriage better. The peat was, however, first cut into sods of regular\r\nsize, and these were fed into the rollers by boys.\r\n\r\nb. _Pressing Air-dried Peat._\r\n\r\nSome kinds of peat, when in the air-dry and pulverized state, yield by\r\ngreat pressure very firm, excellent, and economical fuel.\r\n\r\n_Lithuanian Process._--In Lithuania, according to Leo,[20] the following\r\nmethod is extensively adopted. The bog is drained, the surface moss or\r\ngrass-turf and roots are removed, and then the peat is broken up by a\r\nsimple spade-plow, in furrows 2 inches wide and 8 or 10 inches deep. The\r\nbroken peat is repeatedly traversed with wooden harrows, and is thus\r\npulverized and dried. When suitably dry, it is carried to a magazine,\r\nwhere it is rammed into moulds by a simple stamp of two hundred pounds\r\nweight. The broken peat is reduced to two-fifths its first bulk, and the\r\nblocks thus formed are so hard, as to admit of cutting with a saw or ax\r\nwithout fracture. They require no further drying, are of a deep-brown\r\ncolor, with lustrous surfaces, and their preparation may go on in winter\r\nwith the stock of broken peat, which is accumulated in the favorable\r\nweather of summer. In this manufacture there is no waste of material.\r\n\r\nThe peat is dry enough for pressing when, after forming in the hands to\r\na ball, it will not firmly retain this shape, but on being let fall to\r\nthe ground, breaks to powder. The entire cost of preparing 1000 peats\r\nfor use, or market, was 2 Thalers, or $1.40. Thirty peats, or \"stones\"\r\nas they are called from their hardness, have the bulk of two cubic feet,\r\nand weigh 160 lbs. The cost of preparing a hundred weight, was\r\ntherefore, (in 1859,) four Silver-groschen, or about 10 cents.\r\n\r\nThe stamp is of simple construction, somewhat like a pile driver, the\r\nmould and face of the ram being made of cast iron. The above process is\r\nnot applicable to _fibrous peat_.\r\n\r\nc. _Pressing Hot-dried Peat._\r\n\r\nThe two methods to be next described, are similar to the last mentioned,\r\nsave that the peat is _hot-pressed_.\r\n\r\n_Gwynne's Method._--In 1853, Gwynne of London, patented machinery and a\r\nmethod for condensing peat for fuel. His process consisted, first, in\r\nrapidly drying and pulverizing the fresh peat by a centrifugal machine,\r\nor by passing between rollers, and subsequent exposure to heat in\r\nrevolving cylinders; and, second, in compressing the dry peat-powder in\r\na powerful press at a high temperature, about 180 deg. F. By this heat it is\r\nclaimed, that the peat is not only thoroughly dried, but is likewise\r\npartially decomposed; _bituminous matters being developed, which cement\r\nthe particles to a hard dense mass_. Gwynne's machinery was expensive\r\nand complicated, and although an excellent fuel was produced, the\r\nprocess appears not to have been carried put on the large scale with\r\npecuniary success.\r\n\r\nA specimen of so-called \"Peat coal\" in the author's possession, made in\r\nMassachusetts some years ago, under Gwynne's patent, appears to consist\r\nof pulverized peat, prepared as above described; but contains an\r\nadmixture of rosin. It must have been an excellent fuel, but could not\r\nat that time compete with coal in this country.\r\n\r\n_Exter's Method._[21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--EXTER'S DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--EXTER'S DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\nIn 1856, Exter, of Bavaria, carried into operation on an extensive\r\nscale, a plan of preparing peat-fuel in some respects not unlike the\r\nlast mentioned method. Exter's works, belonging to the Bavarian\r\nGovernment, are on the Haspelmoor, situated between Augsburg and Munich.\r\nAccording to Ruehlmann, who examined them at the command of the\r\nHanoverian Government in 1857, the method is as follows:--1. The bog is\r\nlaid dry by drains and the surface is cleared of bushes, roots, and\r\ngrass-turf, down to good peat. 2. The peat is broken up superficially to\r\nthe depth of about one inch, by a gang of three plows, propelled by a\r\nportable steam engine. 3. The peat is further pulverized by a harrow,\r\ndrawn by a yoke of oxen. 4. In two or three days after harrowing, the\r\npeat is turned by an implement like our cultivator, this process being\r\nrepeated at suitable intervals. 5. The fine and air-dry peat is gathered\r\ntogether by scrapers, and loaded into wagons; then drawn by rope\r\nconnected with the engine, to the press or magazine. 6. If needful, the\r\npeat, thus collected, is further pulverized by passing it through\r\ntoothed rollers. 7. The fine peat is now introduced into a complicated\r\ndrying oven, see figures 5 and 6. It falls through the opening _T_, and\r\nis moved by means of the spirals along the horizontal floors _O_, _O_,\r\nfalling from one to another until it emerges at _Q_. The floors, _O_,\r\n_O_, are made by wide and thin iron chambers, through which passes waste\r\nsteam from an engine. The oven is heated further by hot air, which\r\ncirculates through the canals _K_, _K_. The peat occupies about one hour\r\nin its passage through the oven and falls from _Q_, into the press,\r\nhaving a temperature of from 120 deg. to 140 deg.Fahrenheit. The press employed\r\nat Staltach is essentially the same as that now used at the Kolbermoor,\r\nand figured on p. 125. It is a powerful eccentric of simple\r\nconstruction, and turns out continuously 40 finished peats per minute.\r\nThese occupy about one-fourth the space of the peat before pressing, the\r\ncubic foot weighing about 72 lbs. The peats are 7 inches long, 3 inches\r\nwide, and one half to three quarters of an inch thick, each weighing\r\nthree quarters of a pound. Three presses furnish annually 180,000 cwt.\r\nof condensed peat, which is used exclusively for firing locomotives. Its\r\nspecific gravity is 1.14, and its quality as fuel is excellent.\r\nRuehlmann estimated its cost, at Haspelmoor in 1857, at 8-1/2 Kreuzers,\r\nor a little more than 6 cents per cwt., and calculated that by adopting\r\ncertain obvious improvements, and substituting steam power for the labor\r\nof men and cattle, the cost might be reduced to 6-1/2 Kreuzers, or a\r\nlittle more than 4 cents per cwt.\r\n\r\nExter's method has been adopted with some modifications at Kolbermoor,\r\nnear Munich, in Bavaria, at Miskolz, in Hungary, and also at the\r\nNeustadt Smelting Works, in Hanover. At the latter place, however, it\r\nappears to have been abandoned for the reasons that it could be applied\r\nonly to the better kinds of peat; and the expense was there so great,\r\nthat the finished article could not compete with other fuel in the\r\nHanoverian markets.\r\n\r\nDetails of the mechanical arrangements at present employed on the\r\nKolbermoor, are as follows: After the bog is drained, and the surface\r\ncleared of dwarf pines, etc., and suitably leveled, the peat is plowed\r\nby steam. This is accomplished in a way which the annexed cut serves to\r\nillustrate. The plot to be plowed, is traversed through the middle by\r\nthe railway _x_, _y_. A locomotive _a_, sets in motion an endless\r\nwire-rope, which moves upon large horizontal pulleys _o_, _o_, stationed\r\nat either border of the land. Four gang plows _b_, _b_, are attached to\r\nthe rope, and as the latter is set in motion, they break up the strip of\r\npeat they pass over, completely. The locomotive and the pulleys are then\r\nmoved back, and the process is repeated until the whole field has been\r\nplowed. The plows are square frames, carrying six to eight shares and as\r\nmany coulters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe press employed at Kolbermoor, is shown in figs. 8 and 9. The hot\r\npeat falls into the hopper, _b_, _c_. The plunger _d_, worked in the\r\ncavity _e_, by an eccentric, allows the latter to fill with peat as it\r\nis withdrawn, and by its advance compresses it into a block. The blocks\r\n_m_, once formed, by their friction in the channel _e_, oppose enough\r\nresistance to the peat to effect its compression. In order to regulate\r\nthis resistance according to the varying quality of the peat, the piece\r\nof metal _g_, which hangs on a pivot at _o_, is depressed or raised, by\r\nthe screw _i_, so as to contract or enlarge the channel. At each stroke\r\nof the plunger a block is formed, and when the channel _e_ is once\r\nfilled, the peats fall continuously from its extremity. Their dimensions\r\nare 7 inches long, 3-1/2 wide, and 1-1/2 thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--EXTER'S PEAT PRESS.]\r\n\r\nSeveral presses are worked by the same engine at the Kolbermoor, each of\r\nwhich turns out daily 200 to 300 cwt. of peats, which, in 1863, were\r\nsold at 24 Kreuzers (16 cents), per cwt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--EXTER'S PEAT PRESS.]\r\n\r\nC. Hodgson has patented in Great Britain a compressing-ram similar to\r\nExter's, and works were put up at Derrylea, in Ireland, some years ago,\r\nin which Exter's process of manufacturing peat fuel appears to have been\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n_Elsberg's Process._\r\n\r\nDr. Louis Elsberg, of New York City, has invented a modification of\r\nExter's method, which appears to be of great importance. His\r\nexperimental machine, which is in operation near Belleville, N. J.,\r\nconsists of a cylindrical pug-mill, in which the peat, air-dried as in\r\nExter's method, is further broken, and at the same time is subjected to\r\na current of steam admitted through a pipe and jacket surrounding the\r\ncylinder. The steamed peat is then condensed by a pair of presses\r\nsimilar to that just described, which are fed directly from the mill. In\r\nthis way the complicated drying oven of Exter is dispensed with. Elsberg\r\n& Co. are still engaged in perfecting their arrangements. Some samples\r\nof their making are of very excellent quality, having a density of 1.2\r\nto 1.3.\r\n\r\nThe pressing of air-dry peat only succeeds when it is made warm, and is,\r\nat the same time, moist. In Exter's original process the peat is\r\nconsiderably dried in the ovens, but on leaving them, is so moist as to\r\nbedew the hand that is immersed in it. It is, in fact, steamed by the\r\nvaporization of its own water. In Elsberg's process, the air-dry peat is\r\nnot further desiccated, but is made moist and warm by the admission of\r\nhot steam. The latter method is the more ready and doubtless the more\r\neconomical of the two. Whether the former gives a dryer product or not,\r\nthe author cannot decide. Elsberg's peat occurs in cylindrical cakes 2\r\ninches broad, and one inch in thickness. The cakes are somewhat cracked\r\nupon the edges, as if by contraction, in drying. When wet, the surface\r\nof the cakes swells up, and exfoliates as far as the water has\r\npenetrated. In the fire, a similar breaking away of the surface takes\r\nplace, and when coked, the coal is but moderately coherent.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why steamed peat admits of solidification by pressure, are\r\nsimply that the air, ordinarily adhering to the fibres and particles, is\r\nremoved, and the fibres themselves become softened and more plastic, so\r\nthat pressure brings them into intimate contact. The idea that the heat\r\ndevelops bituminous matters, or fuses the resins which exist in peat,\r\nand that these cement the particles, does not harmonize with the fact\r\nthat the peat, thus condensed, flakes to pieces by a short immersion in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of Exter's and Elsberg's method consists in avoiding\r\nwhat most of the others require, viz.: the expensive transportation and\r\nhandling of fresh peat, which contains 80 to 90 _per cent._ of water,\r\nand the rapid removal of this excess of water before the manufacture. In\r\nthe other methods the surplus water must be slowly removed during or\r\nafter condensation.\r\n\r\nAgain, enough peat may be air-dried and stored during summer weather, to\r\nsupply a machine with work during the whole year.\r\n\r\nIts disadvantages are, that it requires a large outlay of capital and\r\ngreat expenditure of mechanical force. Its product is, moreover, not\r\nadapted for coking.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.--_Condensation without Pressure._\r\n\r\nThe methods of condensing peat, that remain to be described, are based\r\nupon radically different principles from those already noticed. In\r\nthese, little or no pressure is employed in the operations; but\r\nadvantage is taken of the important fact that when wet or moist peat is\r\nground, cut or in any way reduced to a pulpy or pasty consistence, with\r\ndestruction of the elastic fibres, it will, on drying, shrink together\r\nto a coherent mass, that may acquire a density and toughness much\r\ngreater than it is possible to obtain by any amount of mere pressure.\r\n\r\nThe various processes that remain to notice are essentially reducible to\r\ntwo types, of which the French method, invented by Challeton, and the\r\nGerman, invented it appears by Weber, are the original representatives.\r\nThe former method is only applicable to earthy, well-decomposed peat,\r\ncontaining little fibre. The latter was originally applied to fibrous\r\nmoss-peat, but has since been adapted to all kinds. Other inventors,\r\nEnglish, German, and American, have modified these methods in their\r\ndetails, or in the construction of the requisite machinery, rendering\r\nthem more perfect in their execution and perhaps more profitable in\r\ntheir results; but, as regards the essential principles of production,\r\nor the quality of product, no advance appears to have been made beyond\r\nthe original inventors.\r\n\r\na. _Condensation of Earthy Peat._\r\n\r\n_Challeton's Method_ consists essentially in destroying the fibres, and\r\nreducing the peat by cutting and grinding with water to a pulp; then\r\nslowly removing the liquid, until the peat dries away to a hard coherent\r\nmass. It provides also for the purification of the peat from earthy\r\nmatters. It is, in many respects, an imitation of the old Dutch and\r\nIrish mode of making \"hand peat\" (_Baggertorf_), and is very like the\r\npaper manufacture in its operations. Challeton's Works, situated near\r\nParis, at Mennecy, near Montanges, were visited in 1856 by a Commission\r\nof the Agricultural Society of Holstein, consisting of Drs. Meyn and\r\nLuetkens, and also by Dr. Ruehlmann, in the interest of the Hanoverian\r\nGovernment. From their account[22] the following statements are derived.\r\n\r\nThe peat at Mennecy comes from the decay of grasses, is black, well\r\ndecomposed, and occasionally intermingled with shells and sand. The moor\r\nis traversed by canals, which serve for the transport of the excavated\r\npeat in boats. The peat, when brought to the manufactory, is emptied\r\ninto a cistern, which, by communicating with the adjacent canal,\r\nmaintains a constant level of water. From this cistern the peat is\r\ncarried up by a chain of buckets and emptied into a hopper, where it is\r\ncaught by toothed cylinders in rapid revolution, and cut or torn to\r\npieces. Thence it passes into a chamber where the fine parts are\r\nseparated from unbroken roots and fibres by revolving brushes, which\r\nforce the former through small holes in the walls of the chamber, while\r\nthe latter are swept out through a larger passage. The pulverized peat\r\nfinally falls into a cistern, in which it is agitated by revolving arms.\r\nA stream of water constantly enters this vessel from beneath, while a\r\nchain of buckets as rapidly carries off the peat pulp. All sand, shells,\r\nand other heavy matters, remain at the bottom of this cistern.\r\n\r\nThe peat pulp, thus purified, flows through wooden troughs into a series\r\nof basins, in which the peat is formed and dried. These basins are made\r\nupon the ground by putting up a square frame (of boards on edge,) about\r\none foot deep, and placing at the bottom old matting or a layer of flags\r\nor reeds. Each basin is about a rod square, and 800 of them are\r\nemployed. They are filled with the peat pulp to the top. In a few days\r\nthe water either filters away into the ground, or evaporates, so that a\r\nsoft stratum of peat, about 3 inches in thickness, remains. Before it\r\nbegins to crack from drying, it is divided into blocks, by pressing into\r\nit a light trellis-like framework, having thin partitions that serve to\r\nindent the peat in lines corresponding to the intended divisions. On\r\nfurther drying, the mass separates into blocks at the lines thus\r\nimpressed, and in a few days, they are ready to remove and arrange for\r\nfurther desiccation.\r\n\r\nThe finished peats from Challeton's works, as well as those made by the\r\nsame method near Neuchatel, Switzerland, by the Messrs. Roy, were of\r\nexcellent quality, and in the opinion of the Commission from Holstein,\r\nthe method is admirably adapted for the purification and concentration\r\nof the heavy kinds of peat.\r\n\r\nIn Holstein, a French company constructed, and in 1857 worked\r\nsuccessfully a portable machine for preparing peat on this plan, but\r\nwere shortly restrained by legal proceedings. Of their later operations\r\nwe have no information.\r\n\r\nNo data are at hand regarding the cost of producing fuel by Challeton's\r\nmachinery. It is believed, however, that his own works were\r\nunremunerative, and several manufactories on his pattern, erected in\r\nGermany, have likewise proved unprofitable. The principle is, however, a\r\ngood one, though his machinery is only applicable to earthy or pitchy,\r\nand not to very fibrous peat. It has been elsewhere applied with\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\n_Simplified machinery_ for applying Challeton's method is in operation\r\nat Langenberg, near Stettin, in Prussia.[23] The moss-meadows along the\r\nriver Oder, near which Langenberg is situated, are but a foot or so\r\nhigher at the surface than the medium level of this river, and are\r\nsubject to frequent and sudden inundations, so that draining and partial\r\ndrying of the peat are out of the question. The character of the peat is\r\nunadapted to cutting by hand, since portions of it are pitchy and\r\ncrumble too easily to form good sods; and others, usually the lower\r\nlayers, at a depth of seven feet or more, are made up to a considerable\r\nextent of quite firm reeds and flags, having the consistence of half\r\ndecayed straw. The earthy peat is manufactured after Challeton's method.\r\nIt is raised with a steam dredger of 20 horse power, and emptied into\r\nflat boats, seven in number, which are drawn to the works by an endless\r\nrope operated by horse power. The works themselves are situated on a\r\nsmall sand hill in the middle of the moor, and communicate by canal with\r\nthe dredger and with the drying ground. A chain of buckets, working in\r\na frame 45 feet long, attached by a horizontal hinge to the top of the\r\nmachine house, reaches over the dock where the boats haul up, into the\r\nrear end of the latter; and, as the buckets begin to raise the peat, the\r\nboat itself is moved under the frame towards the house, until, with a\r\nman's assistance, its entire load is taken up. The contents of one boat\r\nare six square yards, with a depth of one foot, and a boat is emptied in\r\n20 minutes time. Forty to forty-four boatloads are thus passed into the\r\npulverizing machine daily, by two chains of buckets.\r\n\r\nThe peat-mud falls from the buckets into a large wooden trough, which\r\nbranches into two channels, conducting to two large tubs standing side\r\nby side. These tubs are 10 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep, and are\r\nmade of 2-inch plank. Within each tub is placed concentrically a\r\ncylindrical sieve, or colander, 8 feet in diameter and 2 feet high, made\r\nof 3/8 round iron, and it is within this that the peat is emptied. The\r\npeat is stirred and forced through the meshes of the sieve by four arms\r\nof a shaft that revolves 20 times per minute, the arms carrying at their\r\nextremities stiff vertical brooms, which rub the inside of the sieve.\r\n\r\nIn these four tubs the peat is pulverized under addition of water; the\r\nfine parts pass the sieves, while the latter retain the coarse fibres,\r\nroots, etc. The peat-mud flows from the tubs into mills, made like a\r\nflour mill, but the \"stones\" constructed of hard wood. The \"stones\" have\r\na diameter of 8 feet 6 inches; the lower is 8 inches; the upper 21\r\ninches thick. The pressure of the upper \"stone\" is regulated by\r\nadjusting the level of the discharging channel, so that the \"stone\" may\r\nbe more or less buoyed, or even fully floated by the water with which it\r\nis surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe peat-substance, which is thus finely ground, gathers from the four\r\nmills into a common reservoir whence it is lifted by a centrifugal pump\r\ninto a trough, which distributes it over the drying ground.\r\n\r\nThe drying ground consists of the surface formed by grading the sand\r\nhill, on which the works are built, and includes about 30 English acres.\r\nThis is divided into small plots, each of which is enclosed on three\r\nsides with a wall of earth, and on the fourth side by boards set on\r\nedge. Each plot is surrounded by a ditch to carry off water, and by\r\nmeans of portable troughs, the peat is let on from the main channel. The\r\npeat-slime is run into these beds to the depth of 20 to 22 inches, an\r\nacre being covered daily. After 4 to 8 days, according to the weather,\r\nthe peat has lost so much water, which, rapidly soaks off through the\r\nsand, that its surface begins to crack. It is then thoroughly trodden by\r\nmen, shod with boards 5 inches by 10 inches, and after 6 to 8 days more,\r\nit is cut with sharp spades into sods. The peats are dried in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe works at Langenberg yielded, in 1863, as the result of the\r\noperations of 60 days of 12 hours each, 125,000 cwt. of marketable peat.\r\nIt is chiefly employed for metallurgical purposes, and sells at 3-1/3\r\nSilver-groschen, or nearly 8 cents per cwt. The specific gravity of the\r\npeat ranges from 0.73 to 0.90.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roberts' Process._\r\n\r\nIn this country attempts have been made to apply Challeton's method. In\r\n1865, Mr. S. Roberts, of Pekin, N. Y., erected machinery at that place,\r\nwhich was described in the \"Buffalo Express,\" of Nov. 17, 1865, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"In outward form, the machine was like a small frame house on wheels,\r\nsupposing the smoke-stack to be a chimney. The engine and boiler are of\r\nlocomotive style; the engine being of thirteen horse power. The\r\nprincipal features of the machine are a revolving elevator and a\r\nconveyer. The elevator is seventy-five feet long, and runs from the top\r\nof the machine to the ground, where the peat is dug up, placed on the\r\nelevator, carried to the top of the machine, and dropped into a\r\nrevolving wheel that cuts it up; separates from it all the coarse\r\nparticles, bits of sticks, stones, etc.; and throws them to one side.\r\nThe peat is next dropped into a box below, where water is passed in,\r\nsufficient to bring it to the consistency of mortar. By means of a slide\r\nunder the control of the engineer, it is next sent to the rear of the\r\nmachine, where the conveyer, one hundred feet long, takes it, and\r\ncarries it within two rods of the end; at which point the peat begins to\r\ndrop through to the ground to the depth of about four or five inches.\r\nWhen sufficient has passed through to cover the ground to the end of the\r\nconveyer,--two rods,--the conveyer is swung around about two feet, and\r\nthe same process gone through, as fast as the ground under the elevator,\r\nfor the distance of two rods in length and two feet in width gets\r\ncovered, the elevator being moved. At each swing of the elevator, the\r\npeat just spread is cut into blocks (soft ones, however) by knives\r\nattached to the elevator. It generally takes from three to four weeks\r\nbefore it is ready for use. It has to lie a week before it is touched,\r\nafter the knives pass through it; when it is turned over, and allowed to\r\nlie another week. It has then to be taken up, and put in a shed, and\r\nwithin a week or ten days can be used, although it is better to let it\r\nremain a little longer time. The machine can spread the peat over\r\neighteen square rods of ground--taking out one square rod of\r\npeat--without being moved. After the eighteen rods are covered, the\r\nmachine is moved two rods ahead, enabling it to again spread a\r\nsemicircular space of some thirty-two feet in width by eighteen rods in\r\nlength. The same power, which drives the engine, moves the machine. It\r\nis estimated by Mr. Roberts, that, by the use of this machine, from\r\ntwenty to thirty tons of peat can be turned out in a day.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Roberts informs us that he is making (April 1866,) some\r\nmodifications of his machinery. He employs a revolving digger to take up\r\nthe peat from the bed, and carry it to the machine. At the time of going\r\nto press, we do not learn whether he regards his experiments as leading\r\nto a satisfactory conclusion, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Siemens' method._\r\n\r\nSiemens, Professor of Technology, in the Agricultural Academy, at\r\nHohenheim, successfully applied the following mode of preparing peat for\r\nthe Beet Sugar Manufactory at Boeblingen, near Hohenheim, in the year\r\n1857. Much of the peat there is simply cut and dried in the usual\r\nmanner. There is great waste, however, in this process, owing to the\r\nfrequent occurrence of shells and clay, which destroy the coherence of\r\nthe peat. Besides, a large quantity of material accumulates in the\r\ncolder months, from the ditches which are then dug, that cannot be\r\nworked in the usual manner at that time of the year. It was to economize\r\nthis otherwise useless material that the following process was devised,\r\nafter a failure to employ Challeton's method with profit.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the peat was dumped into a boarded cistern, where it\r\nwas soaked and worked with water, until it could be raised by a chain of\r\nbuckets into the pulverizer.\r\n\r\nThe pulverization of the peat was next effected by passing it through a\r\nmachine invented by Siemens, for pulping potatoes and beets. This\r\nmachine, (the same we suppose as that described and figured in Otto's\r\nLandwirthschaftliche Gewerbe), perfectly breaks up and grates the peat\r\nto a fine pulp, delivers it in the consistency of mortar into the\r\nmoulds, made of wooden frames, with divisions to form the peats. The\r\npeat-paste is plastered by hand into these moulds, which are immediately\r\nemptied to fill again, while the blocks are carried away to the drying\r\nground where they are cured in the ordinary style without cover.\r\n\r\nIn this simple manner 8 men were able to make 10,000 peats daily, which,\r\non drying, were considerably denser and harder than the cut peat.\r\n\r\nThe peat thus prepared, cost about one-third more than the cut peat.\r\nSiemens reckoned, this greater cost would be covered by its better\r\nheating effect, and its ability to withstand transportation without\r\nwaste by crumbling.\r\n\r\nb. _Condensation of fibrous peat._\r\n\r\n_Weber's method._\r\n\r\nAt Staltach, in Southern Bavaria, Weber has established an extensive\r\npeat works, of which Vogel has given a circumstantial account.[24] The\r\npeat at Staltach is very light and fibrous, but remarkably free from\r\nmineral matters, containing less than 2 _per cent._ of ash in the\r\nperfectly dry substance. The moor is large, (475 acres), and the peat is\r\nfrom 12 to 20 feet in depth. The preparation consists in converting the\r\nfresh peat into pulp or paste, forming it into moulds and drying it; at\r\nfirst by exposure to the air at ordinary temperature, and finally, by\r\nartificial heat, in a drying house constructed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe peat is cut out by a gang of men, in large masses, cleared of coarse\r\nroots and sticks, and pushed on tram wagons to the works, which, are\r\nsituated lower than the surface of the bog. Arrived at the works, the\r\npeat is carried upon an inclined endless apron, up to a platform 10 feet\r\nhigh, where a workman pushes it into the pulverizing mill, the\r\nconstruction of which is seen from the accompanying cut. The vertical\r\nshaft _b_ is armed with sickle-shaped knives, _d_, which revolve between\r\nand cut contrary to similar knives _c_, fixed to the interior of the\r\nvessel. The latter is made of iron, is 3-1/2 feet high, 2 feet across at\r\ntop and 1-1/2 feet wide at the bottom. From the base of the machine at\r\n_g_, the perfectly pulverized or minced peat issues as a stiff paste. If\r\nthe peat is dry, a little water is added. Vogel found the fresh peat to\r\ncontain 90 _per cent._, of water, the pulp 92 _per cent._ Weber's\r\nmachine, operated by an engine of 10 horse power, working usually to\r\nhalf its capacity only, reduced 400 cubic feet of peat per hour, to the\r\nproper consistency for moulding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--WEBER'S PEAT MILL.]\r\n\r\nThree modes of forming the paste into blocks have been practiced. One\r\nwas in imitation of that employed with mud-peat. The paste was carried\r\nby railway to sheds, where it was filled by hand into moulds 17 inches\r\nby 7-1/4 by 5-1/2 inches, and put upon frames to dry. These sheds\r\noccupied together 52,000 square feet, and contained at once 200,000\r\npeats. The peats remained here 8 to 14 days or more, according to the\r\nweather, when they were either removed to the drying house, or piled in\r\nlarge stacks to dry slowly out-of-doors. The sheds could be filled and\r\nemptied at least 12 times each season, and since they protected from\r\nlight frosts, the season began in April and lasted until November.\r\n\r\nThe second mode of forming the peat was to run off the pulp into large\r\nand deep pits, excavated in the ground, and provided with drains for\r\ncarrying off water. The water soaked away into the soil, and in a few\r\nweeks of good weather, the peat was stiff enough to cut out into blocks\r\nby the spade, having lost 20 to 25 _per cent._ of its water, and 15 _per\r\ncent._ of its bulk. The blocks were removed to the drying sheds, and set\r\nupon edge in the spaces left by the shrinking of the peats made by the\r\nother method. The working of the peat for the pits could go on, except\r\nin the coldest weather, as a slight covering usually sufficed to protect\r\nthem from frost.\r\n\r\nBoth of these methods have been given up as too expensive, and are\r\nreplaced, at present, by the following:\r\n\r\nIn the third method the peat-mass falls from the mill into a hopper,\r\nwhich directs it between the rolls _A B_ of fig. 11, (see next page).\r\nThe roll _A_ has a series of boxes on its periphery _m m_, with movable\r\nbottoms which serve as moulds. The peat is carried into these boxes by\r\nthe rolls _c c_. The iron projections _n n_ of the large roll _B_, which\r\nwork cog-like into the boxes, compress the peat gently and, at last, the\r\neccentric p acting upon the pin _z_, forces up the movable bottom of the\r\nbox and throws out the peat-block upon an endless band of cloth, which\r\ncarries it to the drying place.\r\n\r\nThe peats which are dried at first under cover and therefore slowly,\r\nshrink more evenly and to a greater extent than those which are allowed\r\nto dry rapidly. The latter become cracked upon the surface and have\r\ncavities internally, which the former do not. This fact is of great\r\nimportance for the density of the peat, for its usefulness in producing\r\nintense heat, and its power to withstand carriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11--WEBER'S PEAT MOULDING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe _complete drying_ is, on the other hand, by this method, a much\r\nslower process, since the dense, fissureless exterior of the peats\r\nhinders the escape of water from within. It requires, in fact, several\r\nmonths of ordinary drying for the removal of the greater share of the\r\nwater, and at the expiration of this time they are still often moist in\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nArtificial drying is therefore employed to produce the most compact,\r\ndriest, and best fuel.\r\n\r\nWeber's _Drying house_ is 120 feet long and 46 feet wide. Four large\r\nflues traverse the whole length of it, and are heated with the pine\r\nroots and stumps which abound in the moor. These flues are enclosed in\r\nbrick-work, leaving a narrow space for the passage of air from without,\r\nwhich is heated by the flues, and is discharged at various openings in\r\nthe brick-work into the house itself, where the peat is arranged on\r\nframes. The warm air being light, ascends through the peat, charges\r\nitself with moisture, thereby becomes heavier and falls to the floor,\r\nwhence it is drawn off by flues of sheet zinc that pass up through the\r\nroof. This house holds at once 300,000 peats, which are heated to 130 deg.\r\nto 145 deg. F., and require 10 to 14 days for drying.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the hot air upon the peat is, in the first place, to\r\nsoften and cause it to swell; it, however, shortly begins to shrink\r\nagain and dries away to masses of great solidity. It becomes almost\r\nhorny in its character, can be broken only by a heavy blow, and endures\r\nthe roughest handling without detriment. Its quality as fuel is\r\ncorrespondingly excellent.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the mechanical treatment and drying on the Staltach peat,\r\nare seen from the subjoined figures:\r\n\r\n                                                    _Lbs.\r\n                                     _Specific    per Cubic  _Per cent of\r\n                                      Gravity._      Foot._      Water._\r\n\r\n Peat, raised and dried in usual way,  0.24          15        18 to 20\r\n Machine-worked and hot-dried          0.65          35           12\r\n\r\nVogel estimates the cost of peat made by Weber's method at 5 Kreuzers\r\nper (Bavarian) hundred weight, while that of ordinary peat is 13-1/2\r\nKreuzers. Schroeder, in his comparison of machine-wrought and ordinary\r\npeat, demonstrates that the latter can be produced much cheaper than was\r\ncustomary in Bavaria, in 1859, by a better system of labor.\r\n\r\nWeber's method was adopted with some improvements in an extensive works\r\nbuilt in 1860, by the Government of Baden, at Willaringen, for the\r\npurpose of raising as much fuel as possible, during the course of a\r\nlease that expired with the year 1865.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--GEYSSER'S PEAT MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n_Gysser's method._[25]--Rudolph Gysser, of Freiburg, who was charged\r\nwith the erection of the works at Willaringen just alluded to, invented\r\na portable hand-machine on the general plan of Weber, but with\r\nimportant improvements; and likewise omitted and varied some details of\r\nthe manufacture, bringing it within the reach of parties of small means.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying cuts, (figs. 12, 13, and 14), are given an elevation\r\nof Gysser's machine, together with a bird's-eye view and vertical\r\nsection of the interior mechanism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a cast iron funnel _c d i_ of the elevation, (fig. 12),\r\nhaving above a sheet iron hopper _a b_ to receive the peat, and within a\r\nseries of six knives fastened in a spiral, and curving outwards and\r\ndownwards, (figs. 13 and 14); another series of three similar knives is\r\naffixed to a vertical shaft, which is geared to a crank and turned by a\r\nman standing on the platform _j k_; these revolving knives curve upwards\r\nand cut between and in a direction contrary to the fixed knives; below\r\nthe knives, and affixed to the shaft a spiral plate of iron and a\r\nscraper _m_, (fig. 13), serve to force the peat, which has been at once\r\nminced and carried downwards by the knives, as a somewhat compressed\r\nmass through the lateral opening at the bottom of the funnel, whence it\r\nissues as a continuous hollow cylinder like drain-tile, having a\r\ndiameter of four inches. The iron cone _i_, held in the axis of the\r\nopening by the thin and sharp-edged support _g h_, forms the bore of the\r\ntube of peat as it issues. Two men operate the machine; one turning the\r\ncrank, which, by suitable gearing, works the shaft, and the other\r\ndigging and throwing in the peat. The mass, as it issues from the\r\nmachine, is received by two boys alternately, who hold below the opening\r\na semi-cylindrical tin-plate shovel, (fig. 15), of the width and length\r\nof the required peats, and break or rather wipe them off, when they\r\nreach the length of 14 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe formed peats are dried in light, cheap and portable houses, Fig. 17,\r\neach of which consists of six rectangular frames supported one above\r\nanother, and covered by a light roof. The frames, Fig. 16, have square\r\nposts at each corner like a bedstead, and are made by nailing light\r\nstrips to these posts. The tops of these posts are obtusely beveled to\r\nan edge, and at the bottom they are notched to correspond. The direction\r\nof the edges and of the notches in two diagonally opposite posts, is at\r\nright angles to that of the other two. By this construction the frames,\r\nbeing of the same size, when placed above each other, fit together by\r\nthe edges and notches of their posts into a structure that cannot be\r\nreadily overturned. The upper frame has a light shingled roof, which\r\ncompletes the house. Each frame has transverse slats, cast in plaster of\r\nParis, 20 in number, which support the peats. The latter being tubular,\r\ndry more readily, uniformly, and to a denser consistence than they could\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThe machine being readily set up where the peat is excavated, the labor\r\nof transporting the fresh and water-soaked material is greatly reduced.\r\nThe drying-frames are built up into houses as fast as they are filled\r\nfrom the machine. They can be set up anywhere without difficulty,\r\nrequire no leveling of the ground, and, once filled, no labor in turning\r\nor stacking the peats is necessary; while the latter are insured against\r\ndamage from rain. These advantages, Gysser claims, more than cover their\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe daily production of a machine operated by two men with the\r\nassistance of one or two boys, is 2500 to 3000 peats, which, on drying,\r\nhave 9-1/2 to 10 inches of length, and 2-1/2 in diameter, and weigh, on\r\nthe average, one pound each.\r\n\r\nc.--_Condensation of peat of all kinds._--_Weber's method with modified\r\nmachinery._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--SCHLICKEYSEN'S PEAT MILL.]\r\n\r\n_Schlickeysen's Machine._[26]--This machine has been in use in Germany\r\nsince 1860, in the preparation of peat. It appears to have been\r\noriginally constructed for the working and moulding of clay for making\r\nbricks. The principle of its operation is identical with that of Weber's\r\nprocess. The peat is finely pulverized, worked into a homogenous mass,\r\nand moulded into suitable forms. Like Gysser's machine, it forces the\r\npeat under some pressure through a nozzle, or, in the larger kinds\r\nthrough several nozzles, whence it issues in a continuous block or pipe\r\nthat is cut off in proper lengths, either by hand or by mechanism It\r\nconsists of a vertical cylinder, through the axis of which revolves a\r\nshaft, whereon are fastened the blades, whose edges cut and whose\r\nwinding figure forces down the peat. The blades are arranged nearly, but\r\nnot exactly, in a true spiral; the effect is therefore that they act\r\nunequally upon the mass, and thus mix and divide it more perfectly. No\r\nblades or projections are affixed to the interior of the cylinder.\r\nAbove, where the peat enters into a flaring hopper, is a scraper, that\r\nprevents adhesion to the sides and gives downward propulsion to the\r\npeat. The blades are, by this construction, very strong, and not liable\r\nto injury from small stones or roots, and effectually reduce the\r\ntoughest and most compact peat.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, addition of water is not only unnecessary in any case, but\r\nthe peat may be advantageously air-dried to a considerable extent before\r\nit enters the machine. Wet peat is, indeed, worked with less expenditure\r\nof power; but the moulded peats are then so soft as to require much care\r\nin the handling, and must be spread out in single courses, as they will\r\nnot bear to be placed one upon another. Peat, that is somewhat dry,\r\nthough requiring more power to work, leaves the machine in blocks that\r\ncan be piled up on edge and upon each other, six or eight high, without\r\ndifficulty, and require, of course, less time for curing.\r\n\r\nThe cut, (fig. 18), represents one of Schlickeysen's portable\r\npeat-mills, with elevator for feeding, from which an idea of the\r\npulverizing arrangements may be gathered.\r\n\r\nIn Livonia, near Pernan, according to Leo, two of Schlickeysen's\r\nmachines, No. 6, were put in operation upon a purely fibrous peat. They\r\nwere driven by an engine of 12 horse-power. The peat was plowed, once\r\nharrowed, then carted directly to the hopper of the machine. These two\r\nmachines, with 26 men and 4 horses, produced daily 60,000 peats = 7500\r\ncubic feet. 100 cubic feet of these peats were equal in heating effect\r\nto 130 cubic feet of fir-wood, and cost but two-thirds as much. The\r\npeats were extremely hard, and dried in a few days sufficiently for use.\r\nIn 1864, five large Schlickeysen machines were in operation at one\r\nestablishment at St. Miskolz, in Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe smaller sizes of Schlickeysen's machine are easily-portable, and\r\nadapted for horse or hand-power.\r\n\r\n_Leavitt's Peat-condensing and Moulding Mill._[27]--In this country, Mr.\r\nT. H. Leavitt, of Boston, has patented machinery, which is in operation\r\nat East Lexington, Mass., at the works of the Boston Peat Company. The\r\nprocess is essentially identical with that of Weber, the hot-drying\r\nomitted. The fresh peat is pulverized or cut fine, moulded into blocks,\r\nand dried on light frames in the open air. The results claimed by Mr.\r\nLeavitt, indicate, that his machine is very efficacious.\r\n\r\nIt consists, principally, of a strong box or cistern, three feet in\r\ndiameter, and six feet high, the exterior of which, with its gearing, is\r\nshown in figure 19. The mill is adapted to be driven by a four\r\nhorse-power engine.\r\n\r\n\"The upper portion of the box is divided by a series of horizontal\r\npartitions, the upper ones being open latticework, and the lower ones\r\nperforated with numerous holes. The upright shaft, which rotates in the\r\ncentre of the box, carries a series of arms or blades, extending\r\nalternately on opposite sides, and as these revolve, they cut the peat,\r\nand force it through the openings in the diaphragms. The lower portion\r\nof the box, in place of complete partitions, has a series of corrugated\r\nshelves extending alternately from opposite sides, and the peat is\r\npressed and scraped from these by a series of arms adapted to the work.\r\nBy this series of severe operations the air-bubbles are expelled from\r\nthe peat, and it is reduced to a homogeneous paste. When it arrives at\r\nthe bottom of the box, it is still further compressed by the converging\r\nsides of the hopper, and it is received in light moulds which are\r\ncarried on an endless belt.\" Mr. Leavitt has patented the use of\r\npowdered peat for the purpose of preventing the prepared peat from\r\nadhering to the moulds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--LEAVITT'S PEAT MILL.]\r\n\r\nThis mill, it is asserted, will condense 40 tons of crude peat daily,\r\nwhich, at Lexington, is estimated to yield 10 to 14 tons of dry\r\nmerchantable fuel. The cost of producing the latter is asserted to be\r\nless than $2.00 per ton; while its present value, in Boston, is $10 per\r\nton. It requires seven men, three boys, and two horses to dig, cart,\r\nmill, and spread the peat. The machine costs $600, the needful\r\nbuildings, engine, etc., from $2000 to $3000. The samples of peat,\r\nmanufactured by this machine, are of excellent quality. The drying in\r\nthe open air is said to proceed with great rapidity, eight or ten days\r\nbeing ordinarily sufficient in the summer season. The dry peat, at\r\nLexington, occupies one-fourth the bulk, and has one-fourth to one-third\r\nthe weight of the raw material; the latter, as we gather, being by no\r\nmeans saturated with water, but well drained, and considerably dry,\r\nbefore milling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ashcroft & Betteley's Machinery._\r\n\r\nThe American Peat Company, of Boston, are the owners of five patents,\r\ntaken out by Messrs. Ashcroft & Betteley, for peat machinery. They claim\r\nto \"make fuel equal to the best English Cannel coal,\" and really do make\r\na very good peat, though with a rather complicated apparatus. The\r\nfollowing statement is derived from the circular issued by the company.\r\nThe machinery consists of the following parts:--\r\n\r\n_First._--TRITURATING MACHINE--36 inches diameter, 4 feet 6 inches high,\r\nwith arms both on the inside of this cylinder and on the upright\r\nrevolving shaft. In the bottom of the cylinder or tub a large slide gate\r\nis fitted to work with a lever, so that the peat may be discharged, at\r\npleasure, into the Combing Machine, which is placed directly under this\r\nTriturator.\r\n\r\n_Second._--COMBING MACHINE--Semi-circular vessel 6 feet long and 3 feet\r\n6 inches in diameter. Inside, a shaft is placed, which is provided with\r\nfingers, placed one inch apart; the fingers to be 20 inches long, so as\r\nto reach within 2 inches of the bottom and sides of this vessel. Another\r\nshaft, of the same size and dimensions, is placed at an angle of 45 deg., 26\r\ninches from the first shaft, with arms of the same dimensions placed\r\nupon this shaft, with the same spaces, and so placed that this set of\r\narms pass between the first set, both shafts revolving in the same\r\ndirection; the second shaft mentioned being driven at double the speed\r\nof the first. At the bottom of this Combing Machine is to be fixed a\r\ngate, to be operated by a lever, to deliver, at pleasure, the cleansed\r\npeat into the Manipulator or Kneading Machine.\r\n\r\n_Third._--MANIPULATOR.--A Tube of iron 7 feet long and 16 inches\r\ndiameter, fitted with a shaft, with flanges upon it, to gain 6 inches in\r\neach revolution.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._--CONVEYOR.--This Conveyor, to be made with two endless chains\r\nand buckets of iron, with a driving shaft. The hopper, to receive the\r\npeat when first taken from the bog, to be placed below the surface of\r\nthe ground, so that the top edge of the hopper may be level with the\r\nsurface, that the peat may be dumped from the car by which it is taken\r\nfrom the bog, and carried to the hopper without hand labor; and this\r\nconveyor to be so arranged that the peat will be delivered into the\r\nTriturator without hand labor.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._--CONVEYOR.--Another conveyor, precisely like the one above\r\ndescribed, is to be placed so as to convey the peat from the Manipulator\r\ninto the Tank without hand labor.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._--TANK.--A tank 35 feet high and 15 feet in diameter; the bottom\r\nof this tank is made sloping towards the sides, at an angle of 65 deg., and\r\nis covered with sole tile or drain tile, and the entire inside of this\r\ntank is also ribbed with these tile; the ends of these pipes of tile\r\nbeing left open, so that the water which percolates through the pores of\r\nthe tile, by the pressure of the column of peat, will pass out at the\r\nbottom, through the false floor of the tank into the drain, and the\r\nsolid peat is retained in the tank. A worm is fixed in the bottom of\r\nthis tank, which is driven by machinery, which forces out the peat in\r\nthe form of brick, which are cut to any length, and stacked up in sheds,\r\nfor fuel, after it is fully dried by the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--VERSMANN'S PEAT PULVERIZER.]\r\n\r\n_Versmann's Machine_[28]--This machine, see Fig. 20, was invented by a\r\nGerman engineer, in London, and was patented there in Sept., 1861. It\r\nconsists of a funnel or hollow cone _b_, of boiler-plate, from one to\r\ntwo feet in diameter at top, and perforated with 200 to 300 small holes\r\nper square foot of surface, within which rapidly revolves an iron cone\r\n_a_, carrying on its circumference two spiral knives. The peat thrown in\r\nat the top of the funnel is carried down by the knives, and at once cut\r\nor broken and forced in a state of fine division through the holes of\r\nthe funnel, as through a colander. The fine peat collects on the\r\ninclined bottom of the chamber _d_, whence it is carried by means of\r\nArchimedean screws to a moulding machine. The coarse stuff that escapes\r\npulverization falls through _e_ into the cavity _c_. It may be employed\r\nas fuel for the engine, or again put through the machine.\r\n\r\nThis machine effects a more perfect pulverization of the peat, than any\r\nother hitherto described. This extreme division is, however, unnecessary\r\nto the perfection of the product, and is secured at great expense of\r\npower. Through the opening at the bottom of the funnel, much\r\nunpulverized peat finds its way, which must be continually returned to\r\nthe machine. Again, stones, entering the funnel, are likely to break or\r\ndamage the spiral knives, which bear close to the walls of the funnel.\r\n\r\nThe pulverized peat must be moulded by hand, or by a separate\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n_Buckland's Machine_[29] is identical in principle with Versmann's, and\r\nin construction differs simply in the fact of the interior cone having\r\nspiral grooves instead of spiral knives. This gives greater simplicity\r\nand durability to the machine. It appears, however, to require too much\r\npower to work it, and can hardly equal other machines in the quantity of\r\nproduct it will deliver for a given expenditure. The ground peat yielded\r\nby it, must be moulded by hand, or by other machinery. This machine, we\r\nunderstand, has been tried near Boston, and abandoned as uneconomical.\r\n\r\nThe machines we have described are by no means all that have been\r\nproposed and patented. They include, however, so the author believes,\r\nall that have been put into actual operation, at the date of this\r\nwriting, or that present important peculiarities of construction.\r\n\r\nThe account that has been given of them will serve to illustrate what\r\nmechanism has accomplished hitherto in the manufacture of peat-fuel, and\r\nmay save the talent of the American inventor from wasting itself on what\r\nis already in use, or having been tried, has been found wanting. At\r\npresent, very considerable attention is devoted to the subject.\r\nScarcely a week passes without placing one or more Peat-mill patents on\r\nrecord. In this treatise our business is with what has been before the\r\npublic in a more or less practical way, and it would, therefore, be\r\nuseless to copy the specifications of new, and for the most part untried\r\npatents, which can be found in the files of our mechanical Journals.\r\n\r\n14. _Artificial Drying of Peat._\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, air-dry peat contains 20 to 30 and may easily contain\r\n50 _per cent._ of water, and the best hot-made machine peat contains 15\r\n_per cent._ When peat is used as fuel in ordinary furnaces, this water\r\nmust be evaporated, and in this process a large amount of heat is\r\nconsumed, as is well understood. It is calculated, that the temperature\r\nwhich can be produced in perfectly burning full-dried peat, compares\r\nwith that developed in the combustion of peat containing water, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n Pyrometric effect of perfectly dry peat                   4000 deg.  F.\r\n    \"         \"       peat with 30 _per cent._ of water    3240 deg.  \"\r\n    \"         \"         \"       50        \"         \"      2848 deg.  \"\r\n\r\nBut, furthermore, moist or air-dried peat does not burn in ordinary\r\nfurnaces, except with considerable waste, as is evident from the\r\nsmokiness of its flame. When air-dried peat is distilled in a retort, a\r\nheavy yellow vapor escapes for some time after the distillation begins,\r\nwhich, obviously, contains much inflammable matter, but which is so\r\nmixed and diluted with steam that it will not burn at all, or but\r\nimperfectly. It is obvious then, that when a high temperature is to be\r\nattained, anhydrous or full-dried peat is vastly superior to that which\r\nhas simply been cured in the open air.\r\n\r\nNotice has already been made of Weber's drying-house, the use of which\r\nis an essential part of his system of producing peat-fuel. Various other\r\narrangements have been proposed from time to time, for accomplishing\r\nthe same object. It appears, however, that in most cases the\r\nanticipations regarding their economy have not been fully realized. It\r\nis hardly probable, that artificially dried peat can be employed to\r\nadvantage except where waste heat is utilized in the operation.\r\n\r\nA point of the utmost importance in reference to the question of drying\r\npeat by artificial warmth is this, viz.: Although the drying may be\r\ncarried so far as to remove the whole of the water, and produce an\r\nabsolutely dry fuel, the peat absorbs moisture from the air again on\r\nexposure; so that drying to less than 15 _per cent._ of water is of no\r\nadvantage, unless the peat is to be used immediately, or within a few\r\ndays. The employment of highly dried peat is consequently practicable\r\nonly for smelting-works, locomotives, and manufacturing establishments,\r\nwhere it may be consumed as fast as it is produced.\r\n\r\nA fact likewise to be regarded is, that artificial drying is usually\r\ninapplicable to fresh peat. The precautions needful in curing peat have\r\nalready been detailed. Above all, slow drying is necessary, in order\r\nthat the blocks shrink uniformly, without cracking and warping in such a\r\nway as to seriously injure their solidity and usefulness. In general,\r\npeat must be air-dried to a considerable extent before it can be\r\nkiln-dried to advantage. If exposed to dry artificial heat, when\r\ncomparatively moist, a hard crust is formed externally, which greatly\r\nhinders subsequent desiccation. At the same time this crust, contracting\r\naround the moist interior, becomes so rifted and broken, that the\r\nultimate shrinkage and condensation of the mass is considerably less\r\nthan it would have been had the drying proceeded more slowly.\r\n\r\nBesides Weber's drying oven, the fuel for firing which is derived\r\nwithout cost from the stumps and roots of trees that are abundant on the\r\nmoor, at Staltach, and which are thus conveniently disposed of, we have\r\nbriefly to notice several other drying kilns with regard to all of\r\nwhich, however, it must be remarked, that they can only be employed with\r\nprofit, by the use of waste heat, or, as at Staltach, of fuel that is\r\ncomparatively worthless for other purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--CARINTHIAN PEAT DRYING-KILN.]\r\n\r\nThe _Peat Kilns_ employed at Lippitzbach, in Carinthia, and at Neustadt,\r\nin Hanover, are of the kind shown in fig. 21. The peat with which the\r\nmain chamber is filled, is heated directly by the hot gases that arise\r\nfrom a fire made in the fire-place at the left. These gases first enter\r\na vault, where they intermingle and cool down somewhat; thence they\r\nascend through the openings of the brick grating, and through the mass\r\nof peat to the top of the chamber. On their way they become charged\r\nwith vapor, and falling, pass off through the chimney, as is indicated\r\nby the arrows. The draught is regulated by the damper on the top of the\r\nchimney. To manage the fire, so that on the one hand the chimney is\r\nsufficiently heated to create a draught, and on the other waste of fuel,\r\nor even ignition of the peat itself is prevented, requires some care.\r\n\r\nIn _Welkner's Peat Kiln_[30] (fig. 22) the peat, previously air-dried,\r\nis exposed to a stream of hot air, until it is completely desiccated,\r\nand the arrangement is such, that air-dried peat may be thrown in at the\r\ntop, and the hot-dried fuel be removed at the bottom, continuously.\r\n\r\nIn the cut, _A_ represents the section of a wooden cylinder about 10\r\nfeet wide and 6-1/2 feet deep, which surmounts a funnel of iron plate\r\n_A'_. The mouth of the funnel is closed by a door _n_; about 20 inches\r\nabove the door the pipe _B_, which conducts hot air, terminates in the\r\nring _a a_, through the holes in which, _e e_, it is distributed into\r\nthe funnel filled with peat. The air is driven in by a blower, and is\r\nheated by circulating through a system of pipes, which are disposed in\r\nthe chimney of a steam boiler. From time to time a quantity of dried\r\npeat is drawn off into the wagon _D_, which runs on rails, and a similar\r\namount of undried peat is thrown in above.\r\n\r\nAccording to Welkner, a kiln of the dimensions stated, which cost, about\r\n$1800 gold, is capable of desiccating daily ten tons of peat with 20\r\n_per cent._ of water, using thereby 2000 cubic feet of air of a\r\ntemperature of 212 deg. F. When the air is heated by a fire kept up\r\nexclusively for that purpose, 10 _per cent._ of the dried peat, or its\r\nequivalent, is consumed in the operation. At the Alexis Smelting Works,\r\nnear Lingen, in Hanover, this peat kiln furnishes about half the fuel\r\nfor a high furnace, in which bog iron ore is smelted. The drying costs\r\nbut little, since half the requisite heat is obtained from the waste\r\nheat of the furnace itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--WELKNER'S PEAT DRYING KILN.]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this drying kiln are, that it is cheap in construction\r\nand working; dries gradually and uniformly; occupies little ground, and\r\nruns without intermission.\r\n\r\nOther drying ovens are described in Knapp's _Lehrbuch_ der _Chemischen\r\nTechnologie_, 3. Aufl.

Auflage, Bd. I, pp. 23-25.\r\n\r\n15. _Peat Coal, or Coke._\r\n\r\nWhen peat is charred, it yields a coal or coke which, being richer in\r\ncarbon, is capable of giving an intenser heat than peat itself, in the\r\nsame way that charcoal emits an intenser heat in its combustion than the\r\nwood from which it is made.\r\n\r\nPeat coal has been and is employed to some extent in metallurgical\r\nprocesses, as a substitute for charcoal, and when properly prepared from\r\ngood peat, is in no way inferior to the latter; is, in fact, better.\r\n\r\nIt is only, however, from peat which naturally dries to a hard and dense\r\nconsistency, or which has been solidified on the principles of\r\nChalleton's and Weber's methods, that a coal can be made possessing the\r\nfirmness necessary for furnace use. Fibrous peat, or that condensed by\r\npressure, as in Exter's, Elsberg's, and the Lithuanian process, yields\r\nby coking or charring, a friable coal comparatively unsuited for heating\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nA peat which is dense as the result of proper mechanical treatment and\r\nslow drying, yields a very homogeneous and compact coal, superior to any\r\nwood charcoal, the best qualities weighing nearly twice as much per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nPeat is either charred in pits and heaps, or in kilns. From the\r\nregularity of the rectangular blocks into which peat is usually formed,\r\nit may be charred more easily in pits than wood, since the blocks admit\r\nof closer packing in the heap, and because the peat coal is less\r\ninflammable than wood coal. The heaps may likewise be made much smaller\r\nthan is needful in case of wood, viz.: six to eight feet in diameter,\r\nand four feet high. The pit is arranged as follows: The ground is\r\nselected and prepared as for charcoal burning, and should be elevated,\r\ndry and compact. Three stout poles are firmly driven into the ground, so\r\nas to stand vertically and equi-distant from each other, leaving within\r\nthem a space of six or eight inches. Around these poles the peats are\r\nplaced endwise, in concentric rows to the required width and height,\r\nleaving at the bottom a number of air-channels of the width of one peat,\r\nradiating from the centre outwards. The upper layers of peat are\r\nnarrowed in so as to round off the heap, which is first covered with dry\r\nleaves, sods, or moss, over which a layer of soil is thrown. Dry, light\r\nwood being placed at the bottom of the central shaft, it is kindled from\r\none of the canals at the bottom, and the charring is conducted as is\r\nusual in making wood coal. The yield of coal ranges from 25 to 35 _per\r\ncent._ of the peat by weight, and from 30 to 50 _per cent._ by volume.\r\n\r\nGysser recommends to mould the peat for charring in the form of\r\ncylinders of 3 to 4 feet long, which, when dry, may be built up into a\r\nheap like wood.\r\n\r\nA great variety of ovens or kilns have been constructed for coking peat.\r\n\r\nAt the Gun Factory of Oberndorf, in Wirtemberg, peat is charred in the\r\nkiln represented in the accompanying figure. The chamber is 9 feet high,\r\nand 5-1/2 feet in diameter. The oven proper, _b b_, is surrounded by a\r\nmantle of brick _a a_, and the space between, _c c_, is filled with\r\nsand. Each wall, as well as the space, is 15 inches in thickness, and\r\nthe walls are connected by stones _d d_, at intervals of three feet.\r\nAbove the sole of the kiln, are three series of air holes, made by\r\nimbedding old gun barrels in the walls. The door, which serves to empty\r\nthe kiln, is a plate of cast iron, the sides of its frame are wider than\r\nthe thickness of the wall, and by means of a board _e_, a box _m_ can be\r\nmade in front of the door, which is filled with sand to prevent access\r\nof air. The peat is filled in through _i_, a channel being arranged\r\nacross the bottom of the kiln, from the door _f_, for kindling. When the\r\nfiring begins, the lowest air-holes and _i_ are open. When, through the\r\nlower gun barrels, the peat is seen to be ignited, these are corked, and\r\nthose above are opened. When the smoke ceases to escape above, all the\r\nopenings are closed, _m_, is filled with sand, _i_ is covered over with\r\nit, and the whole is left to cool. It requires about 8 to 9 days to\r\nfinish the charring of a charge. Several kilns are kept in operation, so\r\nthat the work proceeds uninterruptedly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--OBERNDORFER PEAT CHARRING KILN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--WEBER'S CHARRING FURNACE.--TRANSVERSE SECTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--WEBER'S CHARRING FURNACE.--LONGITUDINAL\r\nSECTION.]\r\n\r\nAt Staltach, Weber prepares peat coal in a cylinder of sheet iron, which\r\nis surrounded by masonry. Below, it rests on a grating of stout wire.\r\nAbove, it has a cover, that may be raised by a pulley and on one side is\r\nattached a small furnace, figure 24, the draught of which is kept up by\r\nmeans of a blower, or an exhauster, and the flame and hot gases from\r\nit, _which contain no excess of oxygen_, play upon the peat and\r\ndecompose it, expelling its volatile portions without burning or wasting\r\nit in the slightest degree. The construction of the furnace, see fig.\r\n24, is such, that the sticks of wood, which are employed for fuel, are\r\nsupported at their ends on shoulders in the brick-work, and the draught\r\nenters the fire above instead of below. The wood is hereby completely\r\nconsumed, and by regulating the supply of air at _a_ (fig. 25) by a\r\nsliding cover, and at _b_ by a register, the flame and current of air\r\nwhich enters the cylinder containing the peat, is intensely hot and\r\naccomplishes a rapid carbonization of the peat, but as before stated,\r\ndoes not burn it. In this furnace the wood, which is cut of uniform\r\nlength, is itself the grate, since iron would melt or rapidly burn out;\r\nand the coals that fall are consumed by the air admitted through c. The\r\nhot gases which enter the cylinder filled with peat near its top, are\r\ndistributed by pipes, and, passing off through the grating at the\r\nbottom, enter the surrounding brick mantle. Before reaching the\r\nexhaustor, however, they pass through a cooler in which a quantity of\r\ntar and pyroligneous acid is collected.\r\n\r\nWeber's oven is 15 feet in diameter, and 3-1/2 feet high; 528 cubic feet\r\nof peat may be coked in it in the space of 15 hours. The wood furnace is\r\n2 feet in section, and consumes for the above amount of peat 3-1/2 cwt.\r\nof wood. So perfectly are the contents of the iron cylinder protected\r\nfrom contact of oxygen, that a rabbit placed within it, has been\r\nconverted into coal without the singeing of a hair; and a bouquet of\r\nflowers has been carbonized, perfectly retaining its shape. The yield of\r\ncoal in Weber's oven is nearly 50 _per cent._ of the peat by weight.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, charring of peat should be carried on, or aided by\r\nwaste heat, or the heat necessary to coking should be itself economized.\r\nIn manufacturing and metallurgical establishments, a considerable\r\neconomy in both the drying and coking may often be effected in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nOn the bog of Allen, in Ireland, we have an example of this kind. Peat\r\nis placed in iron ovens in the form of truncated pyramids, the bottoms\r\nof which consist of movable and perforated iron plates. The ovens are\r\nmounted on wheels, and run on a rail track.\r\n\r\nFive ovens filled with peat are run into a pit in a drying house, in\r\nwhich blocks of fresh peat are arranged for drying. Each oven is\r\nconnected with a flue, and fire is applied. The peat burns below, and\r\nthe heat generated in the coking, warms the air of the drying house.\r\nWhen the escaping smoke becomes transparent, the pit in which the ovens\r\nstand is filled with water slightly above their lower edges, whereby\r\naccess of air to the burning peat is at once cut off. When cool, the\r\novens are run out and replaced by others filled with peat. Each oven\r\nholds about 600 lbs. of peat, and the yield of coal is 25 _per cent._ by\r\nweight. The small yield compared with that obtained by Weber's method,\r\nis due to the burning of the peat and the coal itself, in the draught of\r\nair that passes through the ovens.\r\n\r\nThe author has carbonized, in an iron retort, specimens of peat prepared\r\nby Elsberg's, Leavitt's, and Aschcroft and Betteley's processes.\r\nElsberg's gave 35, the others 37 _per cent._ of coal. The coal from\r\nElsberg's peat was greatly fissured, and could be crushed in the fingers\r\nto small fragments. That from the other peats was more firm, and\r\nrequired considerable exertion to break it. All had a decided metallic\r\nbrilliancy of surface.\r\n\r\n16.--_Metallurgical Uses of Peat._\r\n\r\nIn Austria, more than any other country, peat has been employed in the\r\nmanufacture of iron. In Bavaria, Prussia, Wirtemberg, Hanover, and\r\nSweden, and latterly in Great Britain, peat has been put to the same\r\nuse. The general results of experience, are as follows:--\r\n\r\nPeat can only be employed to advantage, when wood and mineral coal are\r\nexpensive, or of poor quality.\r\n\r\nPeat can be used in furnaces adapted for charcoal, but not in those\r\nbuilt for mineral coal.\r\n\r\nGood air-dry peat, containing 20 to 30 _per cent._ of water, in some\r\ncases may replace a share of charcoal in the high furnace.\r\n\r\nAt Pillersee, in Austria, spathic iron ore has been reduced by a mixture\r\nof fir-wood charcoal, and air-dry peat in the proportions of three\r\nparts by bulk of the former to one of the latter. The use of peat was\r\nfound to effect a considerable saving in the outlay for fuel, and\r\nenabled the production to be somewhat increased, while the excellence of\r\nthe iron was in no way impaired. The peat was of the best quality, and\r\nwas worked and moulded by hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the ore is refractory and contains impurities that must be fluxed\r\nand worked off in slag, a large proportion of air-dry peat cannot be\r\nused to advantage, because the evaporation of the water in it consumes\r\nso much heat, that the requisite temperature is not easily attained.\r\n\r\nAt Achthal, in Bavaria, air-dry peat was employed in 1860, to replace a\r\nportion of the fir wood charcoal, which had been used for smelting an\r\nimpure clay-iron-stone: the latter fuel having become so dear, that peat\r\nwas resorted to as a make shift. Instead of one \"sack,\" or 33 cubic feet\r\nof charcoal, 24 cubic feet of charcoal and 15 cubic feet of peat were\r\nemployed in each charge, and the quantity of ore had to be diminished\r\nthereby, so that the yield of pig was reduced, on the average, by about\r\n17 _per cent._ In this case the quality of the iron, when worked into\r\nbar, was injured by the use of peat, obviously from an increase of its\r\ncontent of phosphorus. The exclusive use of air-dry peat as fuel in the\r\nhigh furnace, appears to be out of the question.\r\n\r\nAt Ransko, in Bohemia, _kiln-dried peat_, nearly altogether free from\r\nwater, has been employed in a high furnace, mixed with but one-third its\r\nbulk of charcoal, and in cupola furnaces for re-melting pig, full-dried\r\npeat has been used alone, answering the purpose perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe most important metallurgical application of peat is in the refining\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\nDried peat is extensively used in puddling furnaces, especially in the\r\nso-called gas puddling furnaces, in Carinthia, Steyermark, Silesia,\r\nBavaria, Wirtemberg, Sweden, and other parts of Europe. In Steyermark,\r\npeat has been thus employed for 25 years.\r\n\r\nAir-dry peat is, indeed, also employed, but is not so well adapted for\r\npuddling, as its water burns away a notable quantity of iron. It is one\r\nof the best known facts in chemistry, that ignited iron is rapidly\r\noxidized in a stream of water-vapor, free hydrogen being at the same\r\ntime evolved.\r\n\r\nIn the high furnace, _peat-coal_, when compact and firm (not crumbly)\r\nmay replace charcoal perfectly, but its cost is usually too great.\r\n\r\nWhen peat or peat-coal is employed in smelting, it must be as free as\r\npossible from ash, because the ash usually consists largely of silica,\r\nand this must be worked off by flux. If the ash be carbonate of lime, it\r\nwill, in most cases, serve itself usefully as flux. In hearth puddling,\r\nit is important not only that the peat or peat-coal contain little ash,\r\nbut especially that the ash be as free as possible from sulphates and\r\nphosphates, which act so deleteriously on the metal. The notion that, in\r\ngeneral, peat and peat charcoal are peculiarly adapted for the iron\r\nmanufacture, because they are free from sulphur and phosphorus, is\r\nextremely erroneous. Not infrequently they contain these bodies in such\r\nquantity, as to forbid their use in smelting.\r\n\r\nIn the gas-puddling furnace, or in the ordinary reverberatory, impure\r\npeat may, however, be employed, since the ashes do not come in contact\r\nwith the metal. The only disadvantage in the use of peat in these\r\nfurnaces is, that the grates require cleaning more frequently, which\r\ninterrupts the fire, and, according to Tunner, increases the consumption\r\nof fuel 8 to 10 _per cent._, and diminishes the amount of metal that can\r\nbe turned out in a given time by the same quantity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the interruption of work, it has been found, at\r\nRothburga, in Austria, that by substitution of machine-made and\r\nkiln-dried peat for wood in the gas-puddling furnace, a saving of 50\r\n_per cent._ in the cost of bar iron was effected, in 1860. What is to\r\nthe point, in estimating the economy of peat, is the fact that while 6.2\r\ncubic feet of dry fir-wood were required to produce 100 lbs. of crude\r\nbar, this quantity of iron could be puddled with 4.3 cubic feet of peat.\r\n\r\nIn the gas furnace, a second blast of air is thrown into the flame,\r\neffecting its complete combustion; Dellvik asserts, that at Lesjoeforss,\r\nin Sweden, 100 lbs. of kiln-dried peat are equal to 197 lbs. of\r\nkiln-dried wood in heavy forging. In an ordinary fire, the peat would be\r\nless effective from the escape of unburned carbon in the smoke.\r\n\r\nIn other metallurgical and manufacturing operations where flame is\r\nrequired, as well as in those which are not inconvenienced by the\r\ningredients of its ash, it is obvious that peat can be employed when\r\ncircumstances conspire to render its use economical.\r\n\r\n17.--_Peat as a source of illuminating gas._\r\n\r\nProf Pettenkofer, of Munich, was the first to succeed in making\r\nilluminating gas from wood; and peat, when operated according to his\r\nmethod, furnishes also a gas of good quality, though somewhat inferior\r\nto wood-gas in illuminating power.\r\n\r\nIt is essential, that well-dried peat be employed, and the waste heat\r\nfrom the retorts may serve in part, at least, for the drying.\r\n\r\nThe retorts must be of a good conducting material; therefore cast iron\r\nis better than clay. They are made of the [symbol: D] form, and must be\r\nrelatively larger than those used for coal. A retort of two feet width,\r\none foot depth, and 8 to 9 feet length, must receive but 100 lbs. of\r\npeat at a charge.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of gas yielded in a given time, is much greater than from\r\nbituminous coal. From retorts of the size just named, 8000 to 9000 cubic\r\nfeet of gas are delivered in 24 hours. The exit pipes must, therefore,\r\nbe large, not less than 5 to 6 inches, and the coolers must be much more\r\neffective than is needful for coal gas, in order to separate from it the\r\ntarry matters.\r\n\r\nThe number of retorts requisite to furnish a given volume of gas, is\r\nmuch less than in the manufacture from coal. On the other hand, the\r\ndimensions of the furnace are considerably greater, because the\r\nconsumption of fuel must be more rapid, in order to supply the heat,\r\nwhich is carried off by the copious formation of gas.\r\n\r\nGas may be made from peat at a comparatively low temperature, but its\r\nilluminating power is then trifling. At a red heat alone can we procure\r\na gas of good quality.\r\n\r\nThe chief impurity of peat-gas is carbonic acid: this amounts to 25 to\r\n30 _per cent._ of the gas before purification, and if the peat be\r\ninsufficiently dried, it is considerably more. The quantity of slaked\r\nlime that is consumed in purifying, is therefore much greater than is\r\nneeded for coal-gas, and is an expensive item in the making of peat-gas.\r\n\r\nWhile wood-gas is practically free from sulphur compounds and ammonia,\r\npeat-gas may contain them both, especially the latter, in quantity that\r\ndepends upon the composition of the peat, which, as regards sulphur and\r\nnitrogen, is very variable.\r\n\r\nPeat-gas is denser than coal-gas, and therefore cannot be burned to\r\nadvantage except from considerably wider orifices than answer for the\r\nlatter, and under slight pressure.\r\n\r\nThe above statements show the absurdity of judging of the value of peat\r\nas a source of gas, by the results of trials made in gas works arranged\r\nfor bituminous coal.\r\n\r\nAs to the yield of gas we have the following data, weights and measures\r\nbeing English:--\r\n\r\n 100 lbs. of peat of medium quality from Munich, gave REISSIG   303 cub. ft.\r\n      \"   air-dry peat from Biermoos, Salzburg, gave RIEDINGER  305    \"\r\n      \"   very light fibrous peat, gave REISSIG          379 to 430    \"\r\n      \"   Exter's machine-peat, from Haspelmoor, gave           367    \"\r\n\r\nThenius states, that, to produce 1000 English cubic feet of purified\r\npeat-gas, in the works at Kempten, Bavaria, there are required in the\r\nretorts 292 lbs of peat. To distil this, 138-1/2 lbs. of peat are\r\nconsumed in the fire; and to purify the gas from carbonic acid, 91-1/2\r\nlbs. of lime are used. In the retorts remain 117 lbs. of peat coal, and\r\nnearly 6 lbs. of tar are collected in the operation, besides smaller\r\nquantities of acetic acid and ammonia.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stammer, 4 cwt. of dry peat are required for 1000 cubic\r\nfeet of purified gas.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the gas is somewhat better than that made from bituminous\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\n18.--_The examination of Peat as to its value for Fuel_, begins with and\r\nrefers to the air-dry substance, in which:\r\n\r\n1.--Water is estimated, by drying the pulverized peat, at 212 deg., as long\r\nas any diminution of weight occurs. Well-dried peat-fuel should not\r\ncontain more than 20 _per cent._ of water. On the other hand it cannot\r\ncontain less than 15 _per cent._, except it has been artificially dried\r\nat a high temperature, or kept for a long time in a heated apartment.\r\n\r\n2.--_Ash_ is estimated by carefully burning the dry residue in 1. In\r\nfirst-rate fuel, it should amount to less than 3 _per cent._ If more\r\nthan 8 _per cent._, the peat is thereby rendered of inferior quality,\r\nthough peat is employed which contains considerably more.\r\n\r\n3.--_Sulphur_ and _phosphorus_ are estimated by processes, which it\r\nwould be useless to describe here. Only in case of vitriol peats is so\r\nmuch sulphur present, that it is recognizable by the suffocating fumes\r\nof sulphuric acid or of sulphurous acid, which escape in the burning.\r\nWhen peat is to be employed for iron manufacture, or under steam\r\nboilers, its phosphorus, and especially its sulphur, should be\r\nestimated, as they injure the quality of iron when their quantity\r\nexceeds a certain small amount, and have a destructive effect on\r\ngrate-bars and boilers. For common uses it is unnecessary to regard\r\nthese substances.\r\n\r\n4.--The quantity of _coal_ or _coke_ yielded by peat, is determined by\r\nheating a weighed quantity of the peat to redness in an iron retort, or\r\nin a large platinum crucible, until gases cease to escape. The neck of\r\nthe retort is corked, and when the vessel is cool, the coal is removed\r\nand weighed. In case a platinum crucible is employed, it should have a\r\ntight-fitting cover, and when gases cease to escape, the crucible is\r\nquickly cooled by placing it in cold water.\r\n\r\nCoal, or coke, includes of course the ash of the peat. This, being\r\nvariable, should be deducted, and the _ash-free coal_ be considered in\r\ncomparing fuels.\r\n\r\n5.--The _density_ of peat-fuel may be ascertained by cutting out a block\r\nthat will admit of accurate measurement, calculating its cubic contents,\r\nand comparing its weight with that of an equal bulk of water. To avoid\r\ncalculation, the block may be made accurately one or several cubic\r\ninches in dimensions and weighed. The cubic inch of water at 60 deg. F.,\r\nweighs 252-1/2 grains.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The apparent specific gravity here means the weight of the\r\nmass,--the air-filled cavities and pores included--as compared with an\r\nequal bulk of water. The real specific gravity of the _peat itself_ is\r\nalways greater than that of water, and all kinds of peat will sink in\r\nwater when they soak long enough, or are otherwise treated so that all\r\nair is removed.\r\n\r\n[11] The \"full\" cubic foot implies a cubic foot having no cavities or\r\nwaste space, such as exist in a pile, made up of numerous blocks. If a\r\nnumber of peat blocks be put into a box and shaken together, the empty\r\nspace between the more or less irregular blocks, may amount to 46 _per\r\ncent._ of the whole; and when closely packed, the cavities amount to 30\r\n_per cent._, according to the observations of _Wasserzieher_.\r\n(_Dingler's Journal_, Oct., 1864, p. 118.) Some confusion exists in the\r\nstatements of writers in regard to this matter, and want of attention to\r\nit, has led to grave errors in estimating the weight of fuel.\r\n\r\n[12] The _waste space_ in peat and wood as commonly piled, is probably\r\nincluded here in the statement, and is usually about the same in both;\r\nviz.: not far from 40 _per cent._\r\n\r\n[13] See note on the preceding page.\r\n\r\n[14] _Der Torf, etc._, S. 43.\r\n\r\n[15] See page 00.\r\n\r\n[16] On account of the great convenience of the decimal weights and\r\nmeasures, and their nearly universal recognition by scientific men, we\r\nhave adopted them here. The gramme = 15 grains; 5 degrees centigrade = 9\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n[17] Pliny, Hist. Nat. (Lib. XVI, 1) expresses his pity for the\r\n\"miserable people\" living in East Friesland and vicinity in his day, who\r\n\"dug out with the hands a moor earth, which, dried more by wind than\r\nsun, they used for preparing their food and warming their bodies:\"\r\n_captum manibus lutum ventis magis quam sole siccantis, terra cibos et\r\nrigentia septembrione viscera sua urunt_.\r\n\r\nAs regards the \"_misera gens_,\" it should be said that rich grain fields\r\nand numerous flourishing villages have occupied for several centuries\r\nlarge portions of the Duevel moor near Bremen.\r\n\r\n[18] For further account and plans of this machine see Dingler's\r\nPolytechnisches Journal, Bd. 176, S. 336.\r\n\r\n[19] Described and figured in Bulletin de la Societe d'Encouragement,\r\nAugust 1857, p. 513; also Dingler's Polytechnisches Journal, Bd. 146, S.\r\n252.\r\n\r\n[20] Berg- und Huettenmaennische Zeitung, 1859, Nr. 26.\r\n\r\n[21] Henneberg's Journal fuer Landwirthschaft, 1858, S. 42.\r\n\r\n[22] Henneberg's Journal fuer Landwirthschaft, 1858, p.p. 42 and 83.\r\n\r\n[23] Dingler's Journal, Oct., 1864.\r\n\r\n[24] Dingler's Polytechnisches Journal, Bd. 152, S. 272.
