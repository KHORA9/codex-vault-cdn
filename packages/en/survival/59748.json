A. Krug, _Secretary_\r\n           NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, Newton B. Drury, _Director_\r\n\r\n  _An 865-foot tower of rock, serving as evidence of volcanic activity\r\n  that occurred many millions of years ago_\r\n\r\nDevils Tower National Monument has the distinction of being the first\r\nnational monument to be created. It was established by proclamation of\r\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt in the year 1906 under authority of the\r\nso-called Antiquities Act.\r\n\r\nThe great natural feature, Devils Tower (known to the Sioux Indian as\r\nMATEO TEPEE, meaning Grizzly Bears’ Lodge), is like a huge fluted\r\nmonumental shaft set upon a mound, alongside the Belle Fourche River and\r\namidst rolling grasslands and pine forests.\r\n\r\nThe Tower rises to a height of 1,280 feet from the river bed and some\r\n865 feet from its apparent base on the hilltop. The diameter at its base\r\nis approximately 1,000 feet, and at the top averages 275 feet. The top\r\nsurface embraces about an acre and a half, upon which mosses, ferns,\r\ngrasses, shrubs, and sagebrush grow. Mice, pack rats, and chipmunks have\r\nbeen seen there, and the falcon and hawk make it their home. As viewed\r\nfrom various angles, the Tower has many shapes.\r\n\r\nThe fresh rock is of a dark grey color which, after weathering, bleaches\r\nto a light grey with tinges of buff. Lichens of various colors and\r\nshades grow on its face, reflecting tones of light, so that in color its\r\nappearance may change several times during the day, depending on\r\nconditions of atmosphere and light. On occasion, a red sunset may give\r\nit a reddish glow, fading to dull purple.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _A Geologic Mystery_\r\n\r\nAs to the mode of origin of the Devils Tower geologists are by no means\r\nin agreement. That the rock of the Tower was at one time molten and was\r\nforced upward from deep within the earth is no question, and that it\r\ncooled beneath the surface is probable. But whether the great shaft as\r\nit now stands is in reality hardened lava in the neck of an old volcano\r\nthe enclosing walls of which have been removed by erosion, or whether it\r\nis part of a great sheet or sill of molten rock which was injected\r\nbetween rock layers, cannot be positively stated.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of either explanation hundreds of feet of rock have\r\nobviously been removed by erosion from around the Tower and carried by\r\nrivers toward the sea.\r\n\r\nThe columns present an interesting problem. They appear to have been\r\nproduced in the rapidly cooling volcanic rock by regularly arranged\r\ncracks which were due to contraction of the cooling mass. The fact that\r\nthey are not well developed in the base of the Tower may be due to the\r\nslower cooling of the more deeply buried part. The flare of the columns\r\nis a subject too involved for this brief account.\r\n\r\nAs to the age of the Tower it is believed to have been formed early in\r\nthe Age of Mammals, perhaps 50 million years ago, but to have been\r\nuncovered by erosion only in the last one or two million years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Plant and Animal Life_\r\n\r\nAbout a half mile from the entrance to Devils Tower National Monument\r\nthe visitor finds himself driving through a thriving prairie dog “town.”\r\nThese animals were as typical of the original West as the buffalo. Their\r\npresence in towns covering several square miles was incompatible with\r\nagriculture, and the elimination of the species has progressed to the\r\npoint where they are now rarely found. Since all forms of plant and\r\nanimal life are protected within national monuments, this colony of\r\nprairie dogs gives one a glimpse of the Old West.\r\n\r\nMule deer may be seen occasionally, and also many small animals\r\nincluding cottontails and chipmunks.\r\n\r\nA wide diversity of weather conditions, soil, and elevation, and the\r\nlocation of the monument between the mountains and plains, produce an\r\ninteresting and extensive fauna and flora. These factors, together with\r\ninteresting geological problems, afford the student of natural history a\r\nwealth of observation and information if he will but take the time to\r\nfollow not only the trail which encircles the Devils Tower proper but\r\nthe 4½ miles of nature trail as well.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Devils Tower and the Belle Fourche River_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Distant view of Devils Tower_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Fragments of fallen columns at base of Devils\r\n    Tower_]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _The Monument Museum_\r\n\r\nMany questions come to those who view Devils Tower, and an effort is\r\nmade to answer them through exhibits in the museum at the parking area.\r\nThere, by use of pictures, diagrams, artifacts, and specimens, is\r\npresented an explanation of some of the features of the Tower, its\r\ngeology, setting, history, and legend. These exhibits, of interest to\r\nthe layman and student alike, are a logical prelude to a walk along the\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Location and Facilities_\r\n\r\nLocated a little west of the center of Crook County, which lies in the\r\nnortheast corner of Wyoming, the monument entrance is 7 miles northward\r\nfrom U. S. Highway 14, 29 miles northwest of Sundance, Wyo., and 33\r\nmiles northeast of Moorcroft, Wyo.\r\n\r\nIn the days gone by, because of its inspiring setting, the area close to\r\nthe Tower was a favorite camping and picnicking site, first by the\r\nIndian and then by the pioneer who braved the rugged and traillike\r\naccess to the very base of the great rock. Not the least inviting\r\nfeature was the large spring of unusually pure and cold water located\r\nbut a few feet from the base of the Tower, as if flowing from it.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the area, to afford easy access and more comfort\r\nfor the hurried vacationist and thoroughgoing student as well, these\r\nsalient primitive features are preserved by making the water available\r\nat nearly all principal points and by the development of the natural\r\npicnic and campground areas within the shadows of the Tower. Adjacent to\r\nthe area, as well as within a few miles of it, are tourist cabins for\r\nthose wishing overnight lodging, but who are not equipped to camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Administration_\r\n\r\nDevils Tower National Monument, containing 1,194 acres of federally\r\nowned land, is one of the areas of the National Park System owned by the\r\npeople of the United States and administered for them by the National\r\nPark Service. In these areas the scenery and the objects of historic,\r\nprehistoric, and scientific interest are carefully preserved and\r\ndisplayed for public enjoyment.\r\n\r\nInquiries regarding the monument should be addressed to the\r\nSuperintendent, Devils Tower National Monument, Devils Tower, Wyo.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DEVILS TOWER NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n    WYOMING]\r\n\r\n  DEVILS TOWER ELEV. 5117\r\n    Store\r\n    Devils Tower Post Office and Store\r\n  BELLE FOURCHE RIVER\r\n  ENTRANCE STATION\r\n  PRAIRIE DOG COLONY\r\n  LOOKOUT POINT\r\n  Fossil Hill\r\n  Museum and Office\r\n    Campgrounds\r\n    Picnic Grounds\r\n  _REVISED APR. 1947 NM.-DT.-7001 J.J.
