Yet the progressive farmer of\r\nto-day should not only provide his own fresh and cured pork for family\r\nuse, but also should be able to supply at remunerative prices such persons\r\nin his neighborhood as appreciate the excellence and general merit of\r\ncountry or \"homemade\" pork product. This is true, also, though naturally\r\nin a less degree, of the townsman who fattens one or two pigs on the\r\nfamily kitchen slops, adding sufficient grain ration to finish off the\r\npork for autumn slaughter.\r\n\r\nThe only popular book of the kind ever published, \"Home Pork Making\"\r\nfurnishes in a plain manner just such detailed information as is needed to\r\nenable the farmer, feeder, or country butcher to successfully and\r\neconomically slaughter his own hogs and cure his own pork. All stages of\r\nthe work are fully presented, so that even without experience or special\r\nequipment any intelligent person can readily follow the instructions.\r\nHints are given about finishing off hogs for bacon, hams, etc. Then,\r\nbeginning with proper methods of slaughtering, the various processes are\r\nclearly presented, including every needful detail from the scalding vat to\r\nthe kitchen baking dish and dining-room table.\r\n\r\nThe various chapters treat successively of the following, among other\r\nbranches of the art of pork making: Possibilities of profit in home\r\ncuring and marketing pork; finishing off hogs for bacon; class of rations\r\nbest adapted, flesh and fat forming foods; best methods of slaughtering\r\nhogs, with necessary adjuncts for this preliminary work; scalding and\r\nscraping; the construction of vats; dressing the carcass; cooling and\r\ncutting up the meat; best disposition of the offal; the making of sausage\r\nand scrapple; success in producing a fine quality of lard and the proper\r\ncare of it.\r\n\r\nSeveral chapters are devoted to putting down and curing the different cuts\r\nof meat in a variety of ways for many purposes. Here will be found the\r\nprized recipes and secret processes employed in making the popular pork\r\nspecialties for which England, Virginia, Kentucky, New England and other\r\nsections are noted. Many of these points involve the old and well-guarded\r\nmethods upon which more than one fortune has been made, as well as the\r\nnewest and latest ideas for curing pork and utilizing its products. Among\r\nthese the subject of pickling and barreling is thoroughly treated,\r\nrenewing pork brine; care of barrels, etc. The proper curing of hams and\r\nshoulders receives minute attention, and so with the work of dry salting\r\nbacon and sides. A chapter devoted to smoking and smokehouses affords all\r\nnecessary light on this important subject, including a number of helpful\r\nillustrations; success in keeping bacon and hams is fully described,\r\ntogether with many other features of the work of home curing. The\r\nconcluding portion of the book affords many interesting details relating\r\nto the various cuts of meat in the big packing houses, magnitude of the\r\nswine industry and figures covering the importance of our home and foreign\r\ntrade in pork and pork product.\r\n\r\nIn completing this preface, descriptive of the various features of the\r\nbook, the editor wishes to give credit to our friends who have added to\r\nits value through various contributions and courtesies. A considerable\r\npart of the chapters giving practical directions for cutting and curing\r\npork are the results of the actual experience of B. W. Jones of Virginia;\r\nwe desire also to give due credit to contributions by P. H. Hartwell,\r\nRufus B. Martin, Henry Stewart and many other practical farmers; to Hately\r\nBrothers, leading packers at Chicago; North Packing and Provision Co. of\r\nBoston, and to a host of intelligent women on American farms, who, through\r\ntheir practical experience in the art of cooking, have furnished us with\r\nmany admirable recipes for preparing and serving pork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPORK MAKING ON THE FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the marvelous growth of the packing industry the past generation,\r\nmethods of slaughtering and handling pork have undergone an entire\r\nrevolution. In the days of our fathers, annual hog-killing time was as\r\nmuch an event in the family as the harvesting of grain. With the coming of\r\ngood vigorous frosts and cold weather, reached in the Northern states\r\nusually in November, every farmer would kill one, two or more hogs for\r\nhome consumption, and frequently a considerable number for distribution\r\nthrough regular market channels. Nowadays, however, the big pork packing\r\nestablishments have brought things down to such a fine point, utilizing\r\nevery part of the animal (or, as has been said, \"working up everything but\r\nthe pig's squeal\"), that comparatively few hogs out of all the great\r\nnumber fattened are slaughtered and cut up on the farm.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably there is room for considerable business of this character,\r\nand if properly conducted, with a thorough understanding, farmers can\r\nprofitably convert some of their hogs into cured meats, lard, hams, bacon,\r\nsausage, etc., finding a good market at home and in villages and towns.\r\nMethods now in use are not greatly different from those followed years\r\nago, although of course improvement is the order of the day, and some\r\nimportant changes have taken place, as will be seen in a study of our\r\npages. A few fixtures and implements are necessary to properly cure and\r\npack pork, but these may be simple, inexpensive and at the same time\r\nefficient. Such important portions of the work as the proper cutting of\r\nthe throat, scalding, scraping, opening and cleaning the hog should be\r\nundertaken by someone not altogether a novice. And there is no reason why\r\nevery farmer should not advantageously slaughter one or more hogs each\r\nyear, supplying the family with the winter's requirements and have\r\nsomething left over to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBILITIES OF PROFIT\r\n\r\nin the intelligent curing and selling of homemade pork are suggested by\r\nthe far too general custom of farmers buying their pork supplies at the\r\nstores. This custom is increasing, to say nothing of the very large number\r\nof townspeople who would be willing to buy home cured pork were it\r\nproperly offered them. Probably it is not practicable that every farmer\r\nshould butcher his own swine, but in nearly every neighborhood one or two\r\nfarmers could do this and make good profits. The first to do so, the first\r\nto be known as having home cured pork to sell, and the first to make a\r\nreputation on it, will be the one to secure the most profit.\r\n\r\nIn the farm census of live stock, hogs are given a very important place.\r\nAccording to the United States census of 1890 there were on farms in this\r\ncountry 57,409,583 hogs. Returns covering later years place the farm\r\ncensus of hogs, according to compilations of _American Agriculturist_ and\r\n_Orange Judd Farmer_, recognized authorities, at 47,061,000 in 1895,\r\n46,302,000 in 1896, and 48,934,000 in 1899. According to these authorities\r\nthe average farm value of all hogs in 1899 was $4.19 per head. The\r\ngovernment report placed the average farm price in 1894 at $5.98, in '93,\r\n$6.41, and in 1892, $4.60.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRAVELING PIGPEN.\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to change the location of a pigpen, especially where\r\na single pig is kept. It may be placed in the garden at the time when\r\nthere are waste vegetables to be disposed of, or it may be penned in a\r\ngrass lot. A portable pen, with an open yard attached, is seen in the\r\naccompanying illustrations. Figure 1 presents the pen, the engraving\r\nshowing it so clearly that no description is needed. The yard, seen in\r\nFig. 2, is placed with the open space next to the door of the pen, so that\r\nthe pig can go in and out freely. The yard is attached to the pen by hooks\r\nand staples, and both of them are provided with handles, by which they can\r\nbe lifted and carried from place to place. Both the yard and pen should\r\nbe floored, to prevent the pig from tearing up the ground. The floors\r\nshould be raised a few inches from the ground, that they may be kept dry\r\nand made durable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. PORTABLE PEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. YARD ATTACHMENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFINISHING OFF HOGS FOR BACON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general subject of feeding and fattening hogs it is not necessary here\r\nto discuss. It will suffice to point out the advisability of using such\r\nrations as will finish off the swine in a manner best fitted to produce a\r\ngood bacon hog. An important point is to feed a proper proportion of\r\nflesh-forming ration rather than one which will serve to develop fat at\r\nthe expense of lean. The proper proportion of these will best subserve the\r\ninterest of the farmer, whether he is finishing off swine for family use\r\nor for supplying the market with home cured bacon. A diet composed largely\r\nof protein (albuminoids) results in an increased proportion of lean meat\r\nin the carcass. On the other hand, a ration made up chiefly of feeds which\r\nare high in starchy elements, known as carbohydrates, yields very largely\r\nin fat (lard). A most comprehensive chart showing the relative values of\r\nvarious fodders and feeding stuffs has been prepared by Herbert Myrick,\r\neditor of _American Agriculturist_, and will afford a good many valuable\r\nhints to the farmer who wishes to feed his swine intelligently. This\r\npoints out the fact that such feeds as oats, barley, cowpea hay, shorts,\r\nred clover hay and whole cottonseed are especially rich in flesh-forming\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nCorn, which is rich in starch, is a great fat producer and should not be\r\nfed too freely in finishing off hogs for the best class of bacon. In\r\naddition to the important muscle-producing feeds noted above, there are\r\nothers rich in protein, such as bran, skim milk, buttermilk, etc. While\r\ncorn is naturally the standby of all swine growers, the rations for bacon\r\npurposes should include these muscle-producing feeds in order to bring the\r\nbest results. If lean, juicy meat is desired, these muscle forming foods\r\nshould be continued to the close. In order to get\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST THE QUALITY OF BACON THAT IS WANTED,\r\n\r\nfeeders must so arrange the ration that it will contain a maximum of\r\nmuscle and a minimum of fat. This gives the sweet flavor and streaked meat\r\nwhich is the secret of the popularity of the Irish and Danish bacon. Our\r\nAmerican meats are as a rule heavy, rich in fat and in marked contrast\r\nwith the light, mild, sweet flavored pork well streaked with lean, found\r\nso generally in the English market and cured primarily in Ireland and\r\nDenmark. What is wanted is a long, lean, smooth, bacon hog something after\r\nthe Irish hog. Here is a hint for our American farmers.\r\n\r\nEngland can justly boast of her hams and bacon, but for sweet, tender,\r\nlean pork the Normandy hogs probably have no superior in the world. They\r\nare fed largely on meat-producing food, as milk, peas, barley, rye and\r\nwheat bran. They are not fed on corn meal alone. They are slaughtered at\r\nabout six months. The bristles are burned off by laying the carcass on\r\nstraw and setting it on fire. Though the carcasses come out black, they\r\nare scraped white and clean, and dressed perfectly while warm. It is\r\nbelieved that hogs thus dressed keep better and that the meat is sweeter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-CLOSING DOOR FOR PIGPEN.\r\n\r\nNeither winter snows nor the spring and summer rains should be allowed to\r\nbeat into a pigpen. But the difficulty is to have a door that will shut\r\nitself and can be opened by the animals whenever they desire. The\r\nengraving, Fig. 3, shows a door of this kind that can be applied to any\r\npen, at least any to which a door can be affixed at all. It is hung on\r\nhooks and staples to the lintel of the doorway, and swinging either way\r\nallows the inmates of the pen to go out or in, as they please,--closing\r\nautomatically. If the door is intended to fit closely, leather strips two\r\ninches wide should be nailed around the frame of the doorway, then as the\r\ndoor closes it presses tightly against these strips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. AUTOMATIC DOOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA HOG-FEEDING CONVENIENCE.\r\n\r\nThe usual hog's trough and the usual method of getting food into it are\r\nconducive to a perturbed state of mind on the part of the feeder, because\r\nthe hog is accustomed to get bodily into the trough, where he is likely to\r\nreceive a goodly portion of his breakfast or dinner upon the top of his\r\nhead. The ordinary trough too, is difficult to clean out for a similar\r\nreason--the pig usually standing in it. The diagram shown herewith, Fig.\r\n4 gives a suggestion for a trough that overcomes some of the difficulties\r\nmentioned, as it is easily accessible from the outside, both for pouring\r\nin food and for removing any dirt or litter that may be in it. The\r\naccompanying sketch so plainly shows the construction that detailed\r\ndescription does not appear to be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. PROTECTED TROUGH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said as to the most humane modes of putting to death\r\ndomestic animals intended for food, butchering with the knife, all things\r\nconsidered, is the best method to pursue with the hog. The hog should be\r\nbled thoroughly when it is killed. Butchering by which the heart is\r\npierced or the main artery leading from it severed, does this in the most\r\neffectual way, ridding the matter of the largest percentage of blood, and\r\nleaving it in the best condition for curing and keeping well. The very\r\nbest bacon cannot be made of meat that has not been thoroughly freed from\r\nblood, and this is a fact that should be well remembered. Expert butchers,\r\nwho know how to seize and hold the hog and insert the knife at the proper\r\nplace, are quickly through with the job, and often before the knife can be\r\nwithdrawn from the incision, the blood will spurt out in a stream and\r\ninsensibility and death will speedily ensue. It is easy, however, for a\r\nnovice to make a botch of it; hence the importance that none but an expert\r\nbe given a knife for this delicate operation.\r\n\r\nThere are some readily made devices by which one man at killing time may\r\ndo as much as three or four, and with one helper a dozen hogs may be made\r\ninto finished pork between breakfast and dinner, and without any\r\nexcitement or worry or hard work. It is supposed that the hogs are in a\r\npen or pens, where they may be easily roped by a noose around one hind\r\nleg. This being done, the animal is led to the door and guided into a\r\nbox, having a slide door to shut it in. The bottom of the box is a hinged\r\nlid. As soon as the hog is safely in the box and shut in by sliding down\r\nthe back door, and fastening it by a hook, the box is turned over,\r\nbringing the hog on his back. The bottom of the box is opened immediately\r\nand one man seizes a hind foot, to hold the animal, while the other sticks\r\nthe hog in the usual manner. The box is turned and lifted from the hog,\r\nwhich, still held by the rope is moved to the dressing bench. All this may\r\nbe done while the previous hog is being scalded and dressed, or the work\r\nmay be so managed that as soon as one hog is hung and cleaned the next one\r\nis ready for the scalding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. HEATING WATER IN KETTLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNECESSARY AIDS.\r\n\r\nBefore the day for slaughter arrives, have everything ready for performing\r\nthe work in the best manner. There may be a large boiler for scalding set\r\nin masonry with a fireplace underneath and a flue to carry off the smoke.\r\nIf this is not available, a large hogshead may be utilized at the proper\r\ntime. A long table, strong and immovable, should be fixed close to the\r\nboiler, on which the hogs are to be drawn after having been scalded, for\r\nscraping. On each side of this table scantlings should be laid in the form\r\nof an open flooring, and upon this the farmer and helpers may stand while\r\nat work, thus keeping their feet off the ground, out of the water and mud\r\nthat would otherwise be disagreeable. An appreciated addition on a rainy\r\nday would be a substantial roof over this boiler and bench. This should be\r\nstrong and large enough so that the hog after it is cleaned may be\r\nproperly hung up. Hooks and gambrels are provided, knives are sharpened, a\r\npile of dry wood is placed there, and everything that will be needed on\r\nthe day of butchering is at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATING WATER FOR SCALDING.\r\n\r\nFor heating scalding water and rendering lard, when one has no kettles or\r\ncauldrons ready to set in brick or stone, a simple method is to put down\r\ntwo forked stakes firmly, as shown in Fig. 5, lay in them a pole to\r\nsupport the kettles, and build a wood fire around them on the ground. A\r\nmore elaborate arrangement is shown in Fig. 6, which serves not only to\r\nheat the water, but as a scalding tub as well. It is made of two-inch pine\r\nboards, six feet long and two feet wide, rounded at the ends. A heavy\r\nplate of sheet iron is nailed with wrought nails on the bottom and ends\r\nLet the iron project fully one inch on each side. The ends, being rounded,\r\nwill prevent the fire from burning the woodwork. They also make it handier\r\nfor dipping sheep, scalding hogs, or for taking out the boiled food. The\r\nbox is set on two walls 18 inches high, and the rear end of the brickwork\r\nis built into a short chimney, affording ample draft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. PRACTICAL HEATING AND SCALDING VAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSCALDING AND SCRAPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext comes the scalding and dressing of the carcass. Lay the hog upon the\r\ntable near the boiler and let the scalders who stand ready to handle it\r\nplace it in the water heated nearly to a boiling point. The scalders keep\r\nthe hog in motion by turning it about in the water, and occasionally they\r\ntry the bristles to see if they will come away readily. As soon as\r\nsatisfied on this point, the carcass is drawn from the boiler and placed\r\nupon the bench, where it is rapidly and thoroughly scraped. The bristles\r\nor hair that grow along the back of the animal are sometimes sold to brush\r\nmakers, the remainder of the hair falling beside the table and gathered up\r\nfor the manure heap. The carcass must not remain too long in the hot\r\nwater, as this will set the hair. In this case it will not part from the\r\nskin, and must be scraped off with sharp knives. For this reason an\r\nexperienced hand should attend to the scalding. The hair all off, the\r\ncarcass is hung upon the hooks, head down, nicely scraped and washed with\r\nclean water preparatory to disemboweling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. TACKLE FOR HEAVY HOGS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALDING TUBS AND VATS.\r\n\r\nVarious devices are employed for scalding hogs, without lifting them by\r\nmain force. For heavy hogs, one may use three strong poles, fastened at\r\nthe top with a log chain, which supports a simple tackle, Fig. 7. A very\r\ngood arrangement is shown in Fig. 8. A sled is made firm with driven\r\nstakes and covered with planks or boards. At the rear end the scalding\r\ncask is set in the ground, its upper edge on a level with the platform and\r\ninclined as much as it can be and hold sufficient water. A large, long hog\r\nis scalded one end at a time. The more the cask is inclined, the easier\r\nwill be the lifting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. SCALDING CASK ON SLED.]\r\n\r\nA modification of the above device is shown in Fig. 9. A lever is rigged\r\nlike a well sweep, using a crotched stick for the post, and a strong pole\r\nfor the sweep. The iron rod on which the sweep moves must be strong and\r\nstiff. A trace chain is attached to the upper end, and if the end of the\r\nchain has a ring instead of a hook, it will be quite convenient. In use, a\r\ntable is improvised, unless a strong one for the purpose is at hand, and\r\nthis is set near the barrel. A noose is made with the chain about the leg\r\nof the hog, and he is soused in, going entirely under water, lifted out\r\nwhen the bristles start easily, and laid upon the table, while another is\r\nmade ready.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. SCALDING IN A HOGSHEAD.]\r\n\r\nFigure 10 shows a more permanent arrangement. It is a trough of plank with\r\na sheet iron bottom, which can be set over a temporary fireplace made in\r\nthe ground. The vat may be six feet long, three feet wide and two and\r\none-half feet deep, so as to be large enough for a good-sized hog. Three\r\nropes are fastened on one side, for the purpose of rolling the hog over\r\ninto the vat and rolling it out on the other side when it is scalded. A\r\nnumber of slanting crosspieces are fitted in, crossing each other, so as\r\nto form a hollow bed in which the carcass lies, with the ropes under it,\r\nby which it can be moved and drawn out. These crosspieces protect the\r\nsheet iron bottom and keep the carcass from resting upon it. A large,\r\nnarrow fireplace is built up in the ground, with stoned sides, and the\r\ntrough is set over it. A stovepipe is fitted at one end, and room is made\r\nat the front by which wood may be supplied to the fire to heat the water.\r\nA sloping table is fitted at one side for the purpose of rolling up the\r\ncarcass, when too large to handle otherwise, by means of the rope\r\npreviously mentioned. On the other side is a frame made of hollowed boards\r\nset on edge, upon which the hog is scraped and cleaned. The right\r\ntemperature for scalding a hog is 180 degrees, and with a thermometer\r\nthere need be no fear of overscalding or a failure from the lack of\r\nsufficient heat, while the water can be kept at the right temperature by\r\nregulating the fuel under the vat. If a spot of hair is obstinate, cover\r\nit with some of the removed hair and dip on hot water. Always pull out\r\nhair and bristles; shaving any off leaves unpleasant stubs in the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGEING PIGS.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, \"singers\" were general favorites with a certain class of\r\ntrade wanting a light bacon pig, weighing about 170 lbs., the product\r\nbeing exported to England for bacon purposes. Packers frequently paid a\r\nsmall premium for light hogs suitable for this end, but more recently the\r\ndemand is in other directions. The meat of singed hogs is considered by\r\nsome to possess finer flavor than that of animals the hair of which has\r\nbeen removed by the ordinary process. Instead of being scalded and scraped\r\nin the ordinary manner, the singeing process consists in lowering the\r\ncarcass into an iron or steel box by means of a heavy chain, the\r\nreceptacle having been previously heated to an exceedingly high\r\ntemperature. After remaining there a very few seconds the hog is removed\r\nand upon being placed in hot water the hair comes off instantly.\r\n\r\nAn old encyclopedia, published thirty years ago, in advocating the\r\nsingeing process, has this to say: \"The hog should be swealed (singed),\r\nand not scalded, as this method leaves the flesh firm and more solid. This\r\nis done by covering the hog lightly with straw, then set fire to it,\r\nrenewing the fuel as it is burned away, taking care not to burn the skin.\r\nAfter sufficient singeing, the skin is scraped, but not washed. After\r\ncutting up, the flesh side of the cuts is rubbed with salt, which should\r\nbe changed every four or five days. The flitches should also be\r\ntransposed, the bottom ones at the top and the top ones at the bottom.\r\nSome use four ounces saltpetre and one pound coarse sugar or molasses for\r\neach hog. Six weeks is allowed for thus curing a hog weighing 240 lbs. The\r\nflitches before smoking are rubbed with bran or very fine sawdust and\r\nafter smoking are often kept in clear, dry wood ashes or very dry sand.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. PERMANENT VAT FOR SCALDING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDRESSING AND CUTTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the carcasses have lost the animal heat they are put away till the\r\nmorrow, by which time, if the weather is fairly cold, the meat is stiff\r\nand firm and in a condition to cut out better than it does when taken in\r\nits soft and pliant state. If the weather is very cold, however, and there\r\nis danger that the meat will freeze hard before morning, haste is made to\r\ncut it up the same day, or else it is put into a basement or other warm\r\nroom, or a large fire made near it to prevent it from freezing. Meat that\r\nis frozen will not take salt, or keep from spoiling if salted. Salting is\r\none of the most important of the several processes in the art of curing\r\ngood bacon, and the pork should be in just the right condition for taking\r\nor absorbing the salt. Moderately cold and damp weather is the best for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS THE CARCASS IS DRESSED\r\n\r\nit is lifted by a hook at the end of a swivel lever mounted on a post and\r\nswung around to a hanging bar, placed conveniently. This bar has sliding\r\nhooks made to receive the gambrel sticks, which have a hook permanently\r\nattached to each so that the carcass is quickly removed from the swivel\r\nlever to the slide hook on the bar. The upper edge of the bar is rounded\r\nand smoothed and greased to help the hooks to slide on it. This serves to\r\nhang all the hogs on the bar until they are cooled. If four persons are\r\nemployed this work may be done very quickly, as they may divide the work\r\nbetween them; one hog is being scalded and cleaned while another is being\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. EASY METHOD OF HANGING A CARCASS.]\r\n\r\nDivested of its coat, the carcass is washed off nicely with clean water\r\nbefore being disemboweled. For opening the hog, the operator needs a sharp\r\nbutcher's knife, and should know how to use it with dexterity, so as not\r\nto cut the entrails. The entrails and paunch, or stomach, are first\r\nremoved, care being taken not to cut any; then the liver, the \"dead ears\"\r\nremoved from the heart, and the heart cut open to remove any clots of\r\nblood that it may contain. The windpipe is then slit open, and the whole\r\ntogether is hung upon the gambrel beside the hog or placed temporarily\r\ninto a tub of water. The \"stretcher,\" a small stick some sixteen inches\r\nlong, is then placed across the bowels to hold the sides well open and\r\nadmit the air to cool the carcass, and a chip or other small object is\r\nplaced in the mouth to hold it open, and the interior parts of the hog\r\nabout the shoulders and gullet are nicely washed to free them from stains\r\nof blood. The carcass is then left to hang upon the gallows in order to\r\ncool thoroughly before it is cut into pieces or put away for the night.\r\n\r\nWhere ten or twelve hogs are dressed every year, it will pay to have a\r\nsuitable building arranged for the work. An excellent place may be made in\r\nthe driveway between a double corncrib, or in a wagon shed or an annex to\r\nthe barn where the feeding pen is placed. The building should have a\r\nstationary boiler in it, and such apparatus as has been suggested, and a\r\nwindlass used to do the lifting.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOG KILLING MADE EASY.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying cut, Fig. 11, the hoister represents a homemade\r\napparatus that has been in use many years and it has been a grand success.\r\nThe frames, _a_, _a_, _a_, _a_, are of 2x4 inch scantling, 8 ft. in\r\nlength; _b_, _b_, are 2x6 inch and 2 ft. long with a round notch in the\r\ncenter of the upper surface for a windlass, _d_, to turn in; _c_, _c_ are\r\n2x4 and 8 ft. long, or as long as desired, and are bolted to _a_, _a_. Ten\r\ninches beyond the windlass, _d_, is a 4x4 inch piece with arms bolted on\r\nthe end to turn the windlass and draw up the carcass, which should be\r\nturned lengthwise of the hoister until it passes between _c_, _c_. The\r\ngambrel should be long enough to catch on each side when turned crosswise,\r\nthus relieving the windlass so that a second carcass may be hoisted. The\r\npeg, _e_, is to place in a hole of upright, _a_, to hold the windlass.\r\nBrace the frame in proportion to the load that is to be placed upon it.\r\nThe longer it is made, the more hogs can be hung at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAWBUCK SCAFFOLD.\r\n\r\nFigure 12 shows a very cheap and convenient device for hanging either hogs\r\nor beeves. The device is in shape much like an old-fashioned \"sawbuck,\"\r\nwith the lower rounds between the legs omitted. The legs, of which there\r\nare two pairs, should be about ten feet long and set bracing, in the\r\nmanner shown in the engraving. The two pairs of legs are held together by\r\nan inch iron rod, five or six feet in length, provided with threads at\r\nboth ends. The whole is made secure by means of two pairs of nuts, which\r\nfasten the legs to the connecting iron rod. A straight and smooth wooden\r\nroller rests in the forks made by the crossing of the legs, and one end\r\nprojects about sixteen inches. In this two augur holes are bored, in which\r\nlevers may be inserted for turning the roller. The rope, by means of which\r\nthe carcass is raised, passes over the rollers in such a way that in\r\nturning, by means of the levers, the animal is raised from the ground.\r\nWhen sufficiently elevated, the roller is fastened by one of the levers to\r\nthe nearest leg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. RAISING A CARCASS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPER SHAPE OF GAMBRELS.\r\n\r\nGambrels should be provided of different lengths, if the hogs vary much in\r\nsize. That shown in Fig. 13 is a convenient shape. These should be of\r\nhickory or other tough wood for safety, and be so small as to require\r\nlittle gashing of the legs to receive them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. A CONVENIENT GAMBREL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLOWS FOR DRESSED HOGS.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying device, Fig. 14, for hanging dressed hogs, consists of a\r\nstout, upright post, six or eight inches square and ten feet long, the\r\nlower three feet being set into the ground. Near the upper end are two\r\nmortises, each 2x4 inches, quite through the post, one above the other, as\r\nshown in the engraving, for the reception of the horizontal arms. The\r\nlatter are six feet long and just large enough to fit closely into the\r\nmortises. They should be of white oak or hickory. At butchering time the\r\ndead hogs are hung on the scaffold by slipping the gambrels upon the\r\nhorizontal crosspieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL HINTS ON DRESSING.\r\n\r\nLittle use of the knife is required to loosen the entrails. The fingers,\r\nrightly used, will do most of the severing. Small, strong strings, cut in\r\nproper lengths, should be always at hand to quickly tie the severed ends\r\nof any small intestines cut or broken by chance. An expert will catch the\r\nentire offal in a large tin pan or wooden vessel, which is held between\r\nhimself and the hog. Unskilled operators, and those opening very large\r\nhogs, need an assistant to hold this. The entrails and then the liver,\r\nheart, etc., being all removed, thoroughly rinse out any blood or filth\r\nthat may have escaped inside. Removing the lard from the long intestines\r\nrequires expertness that can be learned only by practice. The fingers do\r\nmost of this cleaner, safer and better than a knife. A light feed the\r\nnight before killing leaves the intestines less distended and less likely\r\nto be broken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. SIMPLE SUPPORT FOR DRESSED HOG.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CUT UP A HOG.\r\n\r\nWith a sharp ax and a sharp butcher's knife at hand, lay the hog on the\r\nchopping bench, side down. With the knife make a cut near the ear clear\r\nacross the neck and down to the bone. With a dextrous stroke of the ax\r\nsever the head from the body. Lay the carcass on the back, a boy holding\r\nit upright and keeping the forelegs well apart. With the ax proceed to\r\ntake out the chine or backbone. If it is desired to put as much of the hog\r\ninto neat meat as possible, trim to the chine very close, taking out none\r\nof the skin or outside fat with it. Otherwise, the cutter need not be\r\nparticular how much meat comes away with the bone. What does not go with\r\nthe neat meat will be in the offal or sausage, and nothing will be lost.\r\nLay the chine aside and with the knife finish separating the two\r\ndivisions of the hog. Next, strip off with the hands the leaves or flakes\r\nof fat from the middle to the hams. Seize the hock of the ham with the\r\nleft hand and with the knife in the other, proceed to round out the ham,\r\ngiving it a neat, oval shape. Be very particular in shaping the ham. If it\r\nis spoiled in the first cutting, no subsequent trimming will put it into a\r\nform to exactly suit the fastidious public eye. Trim off the surplus lean\r\nand fat and projecting pieces of bone. Cut off the foot just above the\r\nhock joint. The piece when finished should have nearly the form of a\r\nregular oval, with its projecting handle or hock.\r\n\r\nWith the ax cut the shoulder from the middling, making the cut straight\r\nacross near the elbow joint. Take off the end ribs or \"spare bone\" from\r\nthe shoulder, trim the piece and cut off the foot. For home use, trim the\r\nshoulder, as well as the other pieces, very closely, taking off all of\r\nboth lean and fat that can be spared. If care is taken to cut away the\r\nhead near the ear, the shoulder will be at first about as wide as long,\r\nhaving a good deal of the neck attached. If the meat is intended for sale\r\nand the largest quantity of bacon is the primary object, let the piece\r\nremain so. But if it is preferred to have plenty of lard and sausage, cut\r\na smart strip from off the neck side of the shoulder and make the piece\r\nassume the form of a parallelogram, with the hock attached to one end.\r\nTrim a slice of fat from the back for lard, take off the \"short ribs,\"\r\nand, if preferred, remove the long ribs from the whole piece. The latter,\r\nhowever, is not often done by the farmers. Put the middling in nice shape\r\nby trimming it wherever needed, which, when finished, will be very much\r\nlike a square in form, perhaps a little longer than broad, with a small\r\ncircular piece cut out from the end next the ham.\r\n\r\nThe six pieces of neat meat are now ready for the salter. The head is next\r\ncut open longitudinally from side to side, separating the jowl from the\r\ntop or \"head,\" so-called. The jawbone of the jowl is cut at the angle or\r\ntip and the \"swallow,\" which is the larynx or upper part of the windpipe,\r\nis taken out. The headpiece is next cut open vertically and the lobe of\r\nthe brain is taken out, and the ears and nose are removed.\r\n\r\nThe bone of the chine is cut at several places for the convenience of the\r\ncook, and the task of the cutter is finished. Besides the six pieces of\r\nneat meat, there are the chine, souse, jowl, head, fat, sausage, two spare\r\nand two short ribs and various other small bits derived from each hog. A\r\ngood cutter, with an assistant to carry away the pieces and help\r\notherwise, can cut out from 50 to 60 hogs in a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO DO WITH THE OFFAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from the pieces of meat into which a hog is usually cut, there will\r\nbe left as offal the chine or backbone, the jowl, the souse, the liver and\r\nlungs, pig's feet, two spareribs and two short ribs or griskins. Nearly\r\nevery housekeeper knows what disposition to make of all this, yet too\r\noften these wholesome portions of the hog are not utilized to best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\nSausage has formed a highly prized article of food for a good many hundred\r\nyears. Formed primarily as now, by chopping the raw meat very fine, and\r\nadding salt and other flavoring materials, and often meal or bread crumbs,\r\nthe favorite varieties of to-day might not be considered any improvement\r\nover the recipes of the ancient Romans were they to pass judgment on the\r\nsame. History tells us that these early Italian sausages were made of\r\nfresh pork and bacon, chopped fine, with the addition of nuts, and\r\nflavored with cumin seed, pepper, bay leaves and various pot herbs. Italy\r\nand Germany are still celebrated for their bologna sausages and with many\r\npeople these smoked varieties are highly prized.\r\n\r\nLike pure lard, sausage is too often a scarce article in the market. Most\r\ncity butchers mix a good deal of beef with the pork, before it is ground,\r\nand so have a sausage composed of two sorts of meat, which does not\r\npossess that agreeable, sweet, savory taste peculiar to nice fresh pork.\r\nThe bits of lean, cut off when trimming the pieces of neat meat, the\r\ntenderloins, and slices of lean from the shoulders and hams, together with\r\nsome fat, are first washed nicely, cleared of bone and scraps of skin,\r\nthen put into the chopper, and ground fine. If a great deal of sausage is\r\nwanted, the neat meat is trimmed very close, so as to take all the lean\r\nthat can be spared from the pieces. Sometimes whole shoulders are cut up\r\nand ground. The heads, too, or the fleshy part, make good sausage. Some\r\nhousekeepers have the livers and \"lights,\" or lungs, ground up and\r\nprepared for sausage, and they make a tolerable substitute. This\r\npreparation should be kept separate from the other, however, and be eaten\r\nwhile cold weather lasts, as it will not keep as long as the other kind.\r\n\r\nAfter sausage is properly ground, add salt, sage, rosemary, and red or\r\nblack pepper to suit the taste. The rosemary may be omitted, but sage is\r\nessential. All these articles should be made fine before mixing them with\r\nthe meat. In order to determine accurately whether the sausage contains\r\nenough of these ingredients, cook a little and taste it.\r\n\r\nIf sausage is to be kept in jars, pack it away closely in them, as soon as\r\nit is ground and seasoned, and set the jars, securely closed, in a cool\r\nroom. But it is much better to provide for smoking some of it, to keep\r\nthrough the spring and early summer. When the entrails are ready, stuff\r\nthem full with the meat, after which the ends are tied and drawn together,\r\nand the sausage hung up in the smokehouse for smoking. This finishes the\r\nprocess of making pork sausage. Put up in this way, it deserves the name\r\nof sausage and it makes a dish good enough for any one. It is one of the\r\nluxuries of life which may be manufactured at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLOGNA SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\nThe popular theory is that these familiar sausages originated in the\r\nItalian city of that name, where the American visitor always stops for a\r\nbit of \"the original.\" Many formulas are used in the preparation of\r\nbologna sausages, or rather many modifications of a general formula. Lean,\r\nfresh meat trimmings are employed and some add a small proportion of\r\nheart, all chopped very fine. While being chopped, spices and seasoning\r\nare added, with a sufficient quantity of salt. The meat employed is for\r\nthe most part beef, to which is added some fresh or salted pork. When\r\nalmost completed, add gradually a small quantity of potato flour and a\r\nlittle water. The mixture being of the proper consistency, stuff in beef\r\ncasings, tie the ends together into rings of fair length and smoke\r\nthoroughly. This accomplished, boil until the sausages rise to the top,\r\nwhen they are ready for use. Some recipes provide for two parts of beef\r\nand one part of fat pork and the addition of a little ground coriander\r\nseed to the seasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTPHALIAN SAUSAGES\r\n\r\nare made in much the same manner as frankforts, chopped not quite so fine,\r\nand, after being cased, are smoked about a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKFORT SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\nClean bits of pork, both fat and lean, are chopped fine and well moistened\r\nwith cold water. These may be placed in either sheep or hog casings\r\nthrough the use of the homemade filler shown on another page.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUABIAN SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\nChop very finely fat and lean meat until the mass becomes nearly a paste,\r\napplying a sprinkling of cold water during the operation. Suabian\r\nsausages are prepared by either smoking or boiling, and in the latter case\r\nmay be considered sufficiently cooked when they rise to the surface of the\r\nwater in which they are boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN PORK SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of these requires considerable care, but the product is\r\nhighly prized by many. For every nine pounds of raw pork add an equal\r\namount of boiled salt pork and an equal amount of raw veal. Then add two\r\npounds selected sardines with all bones previously removed. Chop together\r\nto a fine mass and then add five pounds raw fat pork previously cut into\r\nsmall cubes. For the seasoning take six ounces salt, four ounces ground\r\npepper, eight ounces capers, eight ounces pistachio nuts peeled and boiled\r\nin wine. All of these ingredients being thoroughly mixed, add about one\r\ndozen pickled and boiled tongues cut into narrow strips. Place the sausage\r\nin beef casings of good size. In boiling, the sausages should be wrapped\r\nin a cloth with liberal windings of stout twine and allowed to cook about\r\nan hour. Then remove to a cool place about 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONGUE SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\nTo every pound of meat used add two pounds of tongues, which have\r\npreviously been cut into small pieces, mixing thoroughly. These are to be\r\nplaced in large casings and boiled for about an hour. The flavor of the\r\nproduct may be improved if the tongues are previously placed for a day in\r\nspiced brine. Pickled tongues are sometimes used, steeped first in cold\r\nwater for several hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK FOREST SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\nThis is an old formula followed extensively in years gone by in Germany.\r\nVery lean pork is chopped into a fine mass and for every ten pounds,\r\nthree pounds of fat bacon are added, previously cut comparatively fine.\r\nThis is properly salted and spiced and sometimes a sprinkling of blood is\r\nadded to improve the color. Fill into large casings, place over the fire\r\nin a kettle of cold water and simmer without boiling for nearly an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVER SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\nThe Germans prepare this by adding to every five pounds of fat and lean\r\npork an equal quantity of ground rind and two and one-half pounds liver.\r\nPreviously partly cook the rind and pork and chop fine, then add the raw\r\nliver well chopped and press through a coarse sieve. Mix all thoroughly\r\nwith sufficient seasoning. As the raw liver will swell when placed in\r\nboiling water, these sausages should be filled into large skins, leaving\r\nsay a quarter of the space for expansion. Boil nearly one hour, dry, then\r\nsmoke four or five days.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL CAMBRIDGE SAUSAGES\r\n\r\nare made by adding rice in the proportion of five pounds to every ten\r\npounds of lean meat and six pounds of fat. Previously boil the rice about\r\nten minutes, then add gradually to the meat while being chopped fine, not\r\nforgetting the seasoning. The rice may thus be used instead of bread, and\r\nit is claimed to aid in keeping the sausages fresh and sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAIN SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\nFree from all skin and wash thoroughly the brain of two calves. Add one\r\npound of lean and one pound of fat pork previously chopped fine. Use as\r\nseasoning four or five raw grated onions, one ounce salt, one-half ounce\r\nground pepper. Mix thoroughly, place in beef casings and boil about five\r\nminutes. Afterward hang in a cool place until ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\nAdd one and one-half pounds pulp of choice ripe tomatoes to every seven\r\npounds of sausage meat, using an addition of one pound of finely crushed\r\ncrackers, the last named previously mixed with a quart of water and\r\nallowed to stand for some time before using. Add the mixture of tomato and\r\ncracker powder gradually to the meat while the latter is being chopped.\r\nSeason well and cook thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH SAUSAGE\r\n\r\nis made by using one-third each leaf lard, lean and fat pork, first\r\nthoroughly boiling and chopping fine the meat. Add to this the leaf lard\r\npreviously chopped moderately fine, mix well and add a little blood to\r\nimprove the color and moisten the whole. This sausage is to be placed in\r\nlarge casings and tied in links eight to twelve inches long. In an old\r\nrecipe for Spanish sausage seasoning it is made of seven pounds ground\r\nwhite pepper, six ounces ground nutmeg, eight ounces ground pimento or\r\nallspice and a sprinkling of bruised garlic.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER SAUSAGE SEASONING.\r\n\r\nTo five pounds salt add two pounds best ground white pepper, three ounces\r\nground mace, or an equal quantity of nutmeg, four ounces ground coriander\r\nseed, two ounces powdered cayenne pepper and mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIXTURE OF BREAD.\r\n\r\nVery often concerns which manufacture sausage on a large scale add\r\nconsiderable quantities of bread. This increases the weight at low cost,\r\nthus cheapening the finished product, and is also said to aid in keeping\r\nqualities. While this is no doubt thoroughly wholesome, it is not in vogue\r\nby our most successful farmers who have long made a business of preparing\r\nhome-cured sausage. Bread used for sausages should have the crust removed,\r\nshould be well soaked in cold water for some time before required, then\r\npressed to remove the surplus moisture, and added gradually to the pork\r\nwhile being chopped. Some sausage manufacturers add 10 to 15 per cent in\r\nweight of crushed crackers instead of bread to sausage made during hot\r\nweather. This is to render the product firm and incidentally to increase\r\nthe weight through thoroughly mixing the cracker crumbs or powder with an\r\nequal weight or more of water before adding to the meat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE IN CASES.\r\n\r\nMany prefer to pack in sausage casings, either home prepared or purchased\r\nof a dealer in packers' supplies. Latest improved machines for rapidly\r\nfilling the cases are admirably adapted to the work, and this can also be\r\naccomplished by a homemade device. Figure 15 shows a simple bench and\r\nlever arrangement to be used with the common sausage filler, which\r\nlightens the work so much that even a small boy can use it with ease, and\r\nany person can get up the whole apparatus at home with little or no\r\nexpense. An inch thick pine board one foot wide and four and one-fourth\r\nfeet long is fitted with four legs, two and one-half feet long, notched\r\ninto its edges, with the feet spread outward to give firmness. Two oak\r\nstandards eighteen inches high are set thirty-four inches apart, with a\r\nslot down the middle of each, for the admission of an oak lever eight feet\r\nlong. The left upright has three or four holes, one above another, for the\r\nlever pin, as shown in the engraving. The tin filler is set into the\r\nbench nearer the left upright and projects below for receiving the skins.\r\nAbove the filler is a follower fitting closely into it, and its top\r\nworking very loosely in the lever to allow full play as it moves up and\r\ndown. The engraving shows the parts and mode of working.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. HOMEMADE SAUSAGE FILLER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA SCRAPPLE.\r\n\r\nThis is highly prized in some parts of the country, affording a breakfast\r\ndish of great relish. A leading Philadelphia manufacturer has furnished us\r\nwith the following recipe: To make 200 lbs. of scrapple, take about 80\r\nlbs. of good clean pork heads, remove the eyes, brains, snout, etc. Put in\r\nabout 20 gals. of water and cook until it is thoroughly done. Then take\r\nout, separate the bones and chop the meat fine. Take about 15 gals, of the\r\nliquor left after boiling the heads, and if the water has boiled down to a\r\nquantity less than 15 gals., make up its bulk with hot water; if more than\r\n15 gals. remain, take some of the water out, but be sure to keep some of\r\nthe good fat liquor. Put this quantity of the liquor into a kettle, add\r\nthe chopped meat, together with 10 oz. pure white pepper, 8 oz. sweet\r\nmarjoram, 2 lbs. fine salt. Stir well until the liquor comes to a good\r\nboil. Have ready for use at this time 25 lbs. good Indian meal and 7 lbs.\r\nbuckwheat flour. As soon as the liquor begins to boil add the meal and\r\nflour, the two being previously mixed dry. Be careful to put the meal in a\r\nlittle at a time, scattering it well and stirring briskly, that it may not\r\nburn to the kettle. Cook until well done, then place in pans to cool. The\r\npans should be well greased, also the dipper used, to prevent the scrapple\r\nsticking to the utensils. When cold, the scrapple is cut into slices and\r\nfried in the ordinary manner as sausage. Serve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUSE.\r\n\r\nAfter being carefully cleaned and soaked in cold water, the feet, ears,\r\nnose and sometimes portions of the head may be boiled, thoroughly boned,\r\nand pressed into bowls or other vessels for cake souse. But frequently\r\nthese pieces, instead of being boned, are placed whole in a vessel and\r\ncovered with a vinegar, and afterwards taken a little at a time, as\r\nwanted, and fried.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOWLS AND HEAD.\r\n\r\nIf not made into souse or sausage, these may be boiled unsmoked, with\r\nturnips, peas or beans; or smoked and cooked with cabbage or salad. The\r\nliver and accompanying parts, if not converted into sausage, may be\r\notherwise utilized.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARERIBS AND SHORT BONES\r\n\r\nmay be cooked in meat pies with a crust, the same as chicken, or they may\r\nbe fried or boiled. The large end of the chine makes a good piece for\r\nbaking. The whole chine may be smoked and will keep a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRACKNELS.\r\n\r\nThis is the portion of the fat meat which is left after the lard is\r\ncooked, and is used by many as an appetizing food. The cracknels may be\r\npressed and thus much more lard secured. This latter, however, should be\r\nused before the best lard put away in tubs. After being pressed the\r\ncracknels are worked into a dough with corn meal and together made into\r\ncracknel bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAWN\r\n\r\nis comparatively little used in this country, though formerly a highly\r\nrelished dish in Europe, where it was often prepared from the flesh of the\r\nwild boar. An ancient recipe is as follows: \"The bones being taken out of\r\nthe flitches (sides) or other parts, the flesh is sprinkled with salt and\r\nlaid on a tray, that the blood may drain off, after which it is salted a\r\nlittle and rolled up as hard as possible. The length of the collar of\r\nbrawn should be as much as one side of the boar will permit; so that when\r\nrolled up the piece may be nine or ten inches in diameter. After being\r\nthus rolled up, it is boiled in a copper or large kettle, till it is so\r\ntender that you may run a stiff straw through it. Then it is set aside\r\ntill it is thoroughly cold, put into a pickle composed of water, salt, and\r\nwheat-bran, in the proportion of two handfuls of each of the latter to\r\nevery gallon of water, which, after being well boiled together, is\r\nstrained off as clear as possible from the bran, and, when quite cold, the\r\nbrawn is put into it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAD CHEESE.\r\n\r\nThis article is made usually of pork, or rather from the meat off the\r\npig's head, skins, and coarse trimmings. After having been well boiled,\r\nthe meat is cut into pieces, seasoned well with sage, salt, and pepper,\r\nand pressed a little, so as to drive out the extra fat and water. Some add\r\nthe meat from a beef head to make it lean. Others add portions of heart\r\nand liver, heating all in a big pan or other vessel, and then running\r\nthrough a sausage mill while hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD PUDDINGS\r\n\r\nare usually made from the hog's blood with chopped pork, and seasoned,\r\nthen put in casings and cooked. Some make them of beef's blood, adding a\r\nlittle milk; but the former is the better, as it is thought to be the\r\nricher.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPICED PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\nThese are made somewhat like head-cheese, and often prepared by the German\r\ndealers, some of whom make large quantities. They are also made of the\r\nmeat from the pig's chops or cheeks, etc., well spiced and boiled. Some\r\nsmoke them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FINE POINTS IN MAKING LARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPure lard should contain less than one per cent of water and foreign\r\nmatter. It is the fat of swine, separated from the animal tissue by the\r\nprocess of rendering. The choicest lard is made from the whole \"leaf.\"\r\nLard is also made by the big packers from the residue after rendering the\r\nleaf and expressing a \"neutral\" lard, which is used in the manufacture of\r\noleomargarine. A good quality of lard is made from back-fat and leaf\r\nrendered together. Fat from the head and intestines goes to make the\r\ncheaper grades. Lard may be either \"kettle\" or \"steam rendered,\" the\r\nkettle process being usually employed for the choicer fat parts of the\r\nanimal, while head and intestinal fat furnish the so-called \"steam lard.\"\r\nSteam lard, however, is sometimes made from the leaf. On the other hand,\r\nother parts than the leaf are often kettle rendered. Kettle rendered lard\r\nusually has a fragrant cooked odor and a slight color, while steam lard\r\noften has a strong animal odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO REFINE LARD,\r\n\r\na large iron pot is set over a slow fire of coals, a small quantity of\r\nwater is put into the bottom of the pot, and this is then filled to the\r\nbrim with the fat, after it has first been cut into small pieces and\r\nnicely washed, to free it from blood and other impurities. If necessary to\r\nkeep out soot, ashes, etc., loose covers or lids are placed over the\r\nvessels, and the contents are made to simmer slowly for several hours.\r\nThis work requires a careful and experienced hand to superintend it.\r\nEverything should be thoroughly clean, and the attendant must possess\r\npatience and a practical knowledge of the work. It will not do to hurry\r\nthe cooking. A slow boil or simmer is the proper way. The contents are\r\noccasionally stirred as the cooking proceeds, to prevent burning. The\r\ncooking is continued until the liquid ceases to bubble and becomes clear.\r\nSo long as there is any milky or cloudy appearance about the fat, it\r\ncontains water, and in this condition will not keep well in summer--a\r\nmatter of importance to the country housekeeper.\r\n\r\nIt requires six to eight hours constant cooking to properly refine a\r\nkettle or pot of fat. The time will depend, of course, somewhat upon the\r\nsize of the vessel containing it and the thickness of the fat, and also\r\nupon the attention bestowed upon it by the cook. By close watching, so as\r\nto keep the fire just right all the time, it will cook in a shorter\r\nperiod, and vice versa. When the liquid appears clear the pots are set\r\naside for the lard to cool a little before putting it into the vessels in\r\nwhich it is to be kept. The cracknels are first dipped from the pots and\r\nput into colanders, to allow the lard to drip from them. Some press the\r\ncracknels, and thus get a good deal more lard. As the liquid fat is dipped\r\nfrom the pots it is carefully strained through fine colanders or wire\r\nsieves. This is done to rid it of any bits of cracknel, etc., that may\r\nremain in the lard. Some country people when cooking lard add a few sprigs\r\nof rosemary or thyme, to impart a pleasant flavor to it. A slight taste of\r\nthese herbs is not objectionable. Nothing else whatever is put into the\r\nlard as it is cooked, and if thoroughly done, nothing else is needed. A\r\nlittle salt is sometimes added, to make it firmer and keep it better in\r\nsummer, but the benefit, if any, is slight, and too much salt is\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAF LARD.\r\n\r\nIn making lard, all the leaf or flake fat, the two leaves of almost solid\r\nfat that grow just above the hams on either side about the kidneys, and\r\nthe choice pieces of fat meat cut off in trimming the pork should be tried\r\nor rendered first and separate from the remainder. This fat is the best\r\nand makes what is called the leaf lard. It may be put in the bottom of the\r\ncans, for use in summer, or else into separate jars or cans, and set away\r\nin a cool place. The entrail fat and bits of fat meat are cooked last and\r\nput on top of the other, or into separate vessels, to be used during cool\r\nweather. This lard is never as good as the other, and will not keep sweet\r\nas long; hence the pains taken by careful housewives to keep the two sorts\r\napart. It must be admitted, however, that many persons, when refining lard\r\nfor market, do not make any distinction, but lump all together, both in\r\ncooking and afterward. But for pure, honest \"leaf\" lard not a bit of\r\nentrail fat should be mixed with the flakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT POINT\r\n\r\nin making lard is to take plenty of time. The cooking must not be hurried\r\nin the least. It requires time to thoroughly dry out all the water, and\r\nthe keeping quality of the lard depends largely upon this. A slow fire of\r\ncoals only should be placed under the kettle, and great care exercised\r\nthat no spark snaps into it, to set fire to the hot oil. It is well to\r\nhave at hand some close-fitting covers, to be put immediately over the\r\nkettle, closing it tightly in case the oil should take fire. The mere\r\nexclusion of air will put out the fire at once. Cook slowly in order not\r\nto burn any of the fat in the least, as that will impart a very\r\nunpleasant flavor to the lard. The attendants should stir well with a long\r\nladle or wooden stick during the whole time of cooking. It requires\r\nseveral hours to thoroughly cook a vessel of lard, when the cracknels will\r\neventually rise to the top.\r\n\r\nA cool, dry room, such as a basement, is the best place for keeping lard.\r\nLarge stone jars are perhaps the best vessels to keep it in, but tins are\r\ncheaper, and wooden casks, made of oak, are very good. Any pine wood,\r\ncedar or cypress will impart a taste of the wood. The vessels must be kept\r\nclosed, to exclude litter, and care should be observed to prevent ants,\r\nmice, etc., from getting to the lard. A secret in keeping lard firm and\r\ngood in hot weather is first to cook it well, and then set it in a cool,\r\ndry cellar, where the temperature remains fairly uniform throughout the\r\nyear. Cover the vessels after they are set away in the cellar with closely\r\nfitting tops over a layer of oiled paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPICKLING AND BARRELING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor salt pork, one of the first considerations is a clean barrel, which\r\ncan be used over and over again after yearly renovation. A good way to\r\nclean the barrel is to place about ten gallons of water and a peck of\r\nclean wood ashes in the barrel, then throw in well-heated irons, enough to\r\nboil the water, cover closely, and by adding a hot iron occasionally, keep\r\nthe mixture boiling a couple of hours. Pour out, wash thoroughly with\r\nfresh water, and it will be as sweet as a new barrel. Next cover the\r\nbottom of the barrel with coarse salt, cut the pork into strips about six\r\ninches wide, stand edgewise in the barrel, with the skin next the outside,\r\nuntil the bottom is covered. Cover with a thick coat of salt, so as to\r\nhide the pork entirely. Repeat in the same manner until the barrel is\r\nfull, or the pork all in, covering the top thickly with another layer of\r\nsalt. Let stand three or four days, then put on a heavy flat stone and\r\nsufficient cold water to cover the pork. After the water is on, sprinkle\r\none pound best black pepper over all. An inch of salt in the bottom and\r\nbetween each layer and an inch and a half on top will be sufficient to\r\nkeep the pork without making brine.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to pickle pork by pouring brine over the filled barrel,\r\nthe following method is a favorite: Pack closely in the barrel, first\r\nrubbing the salt well into the exposed ends of bones, and sprinkle well\r\nbetween each layer, using no brine until forty-eight hours after, and\r\nthen let the brine be strong enough to bear an egg. After six weeks take\r\nout the hams and bacon and hang in the smokehouse. When warm weather\r\nbrings danger of flies, smoke a week with hickory chips; avoid heating the\r\nair much. If one has a dark, close smokehouse, the meat can hang in it all\r\nsummer; otherwise pack in boxes, putting layers of sweet, dry hay between.\r\nThis method of packing is preferred by some to packing in dry salt or\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. BOX FOR SALTING MEATS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRENEWING PORK BRINE.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently from insufficient salting and unclean barrels, or other\r\ncause, pork placed in brine begins to spoil, the brine smells bad, and the\r\ncontents, if not soon given proper attention, will be unfit for food. As\r\nsoon as this trouble is discovered, lose no time in removing the contents\r\nfrom the barrel, washing each piece of meat separately in clean water.\r\nBoil the brine for half an hour, frequently removing the scum and\r\nimpurities that will rise to the surface. Cleanse the barrel thoroughly by\r\nwashing with hot water and hard wood ashes. Replace the meat after\r\nsprinkling it with a little fresh salt, putting the purified brine back\r\nwhen cool, and no further trouble will be experienced, and if the work be\r\nwell done, the meat will be sweet and firm. Those who pack meat for home\r\nuse do not always remove the blood with salt. After meat is cut up it is\r\nbetter to lie in salt for a day and drain before being placed in the brine\r\nbarrel.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HANDY SALTING BOX.\r\n\r\nA trough made as shown at Fig. 16 is very handy for salting meats, such as\r\nhams, bacon and beef, for drying. It is made of any wood which will not\r\nflavor the meat; ash, spruce or hemlock plank, one and a half inches\r\nthick, being better than any others. A good size is four feet long by two\r\nand one-half wide and one and one-half deep. The joints should be made\r\ntight with white lead spread upon strips of cloth, and screws are vastly\r\nbetter than nails to hold the trough together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCARE OF HAMS AND SHOULDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn too many instances farmers do not have the proper facilities for curing\r\nhams, and do not see to it that such are at hand, an important point in\r\nsuccess in this direction. A general cure which would make a good ham\r\nunder proper conditions would include as follows: To each 100 lbs. of ham\r\nuse seven and a half pounds Liverpool fine salt, one and one-half pounds\r\ngranulated sugar and four ounces saltpeter. Weigh the meat and the\r\ningredients in the above proportions, rub the meat thoroughly with this\r\nmixture and pack closely in a tierce. Fill the tierce with water and roll\r\nevery seven days until cured, which in a temperature of 40 to 50 degrees\r\nwould require about fifty days for a medium ham. Large hams take about ten\r\ndays more for curing. When wanted for smoking, wash the hams in water or\r\nsoak for twelve hours. Hang in the smokehouse and smoke slowly forty-eight\r\nhours and you will have a very good ham. While this is not the exact\r\nformula followed in big packing houses, any more than are other special\r\nrecipes given here, it is a general ham cure that will make a first-class\r\nham in every respect if proper attention is given it.\r\n\r\nAnother method of pickling hams and shoulders, preparatory to smoking,\r\nincludes the use of molasses. Though somewhat different from the above\r\nformula, the careful following of directions cannot fail to succeed\r\nadmirably. To four quarts of fine salt and two ounces of pulverized\r\nsaltpeter, add sufficient molasses to make a pasty mixture. The hams\r\nhaving hung in a dry, cool place for three or four days after cutting up,\r\nare to be covered all over with the mixture, more thickly on the flesh\r\nside, and laid skin side down for three or four days. In the meantime,\r\nmake a pickle of the following proportions, the quantities here named\r\nbeing for 100 lbs. of hams. Coarse salt, seven pounds; brown sugar, five\r\npounds; saltpeter, two ounces; pearlash or potash, one-half ounce; soft\r\nwater, four gallons. Heat gradually and as the skim rises remove it.\r\nContinue to do this as long as any skim rises, and when it ceases, allow\r\nthe pickle to cool. When the hams have remained the proper time immersed\r\nin this mixture, cover the bottom of a clean, sweet barrel with salt about\r\nhalf an inch deep. Pack in the hams as closely as possible, cover them\r\nwith the pickle, and place over them a follower with weights to keep them\r\ndown. Small hams of fifteen pounds and less, also shoulders, should remain\r\nin the pickle for five weeks; larger ones will require six to eight weeks,\r\naccording to size. Let them dry well before smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTPHALIAN HAMS.\r\n\r\nThis particular style has long been a prime favorite in certain markets of\r\nEurope, and to a small extent in this country also. Westphalia is a\r\nprovince of Germany in which there is a large industry in breeding swine\r\nfor the express purpose of making the most tender meat with the least\r\nproportion of fat. Another reason for the peculiar and excellent qualities\r\nwhich have made Westphalian hams so famous, is the manner of feeding and\r\ngrowing for the hams, and finally the preserving, curing, and last of all,\r\nsmoking the hams. The Ravensberg cross breed of swine is a favorite for\r\nthis purpose. They are rather large animals, having slender bodies, flat\r\ngroins, straight snouts and large heads, with big, overhanging ears. The\r\nskin is white, with straight little bristles.\r\n\r\nA principal part of the swine food in Westphalia is potatoes; these are\r\ncooked and then mashed in the potato water. The pulp thus obtained is\r\nthoroughly mixed with wheat bran in a dry, raw state; little corn is used.\r\nIn order to avoid overproduction of fat and at the same time further the\r\ngrowth of flesh of young pigs, some raw cut green feed, such as cabbage,\r\nis used; young pigs are also fed sour milk freely. In pickling the hams\r\nthey are first vigorously rubbed with saltpeter and then with salt. The\r\nhams are pressed in the pickling vat and entirely covered with cold brine,\r\nremaining in salt three to five weeks. After this they are taken out of\r\nthe pickle and hung in a shady but dry and airy place to \"air-dry.\" Before\r\nthe pickled hams can be put in smoke they are exposed for several weeks to\r\nthis drying in the open air. As long as the outside of the ham is not\r\nabsolutely dry, appearing moist or sticky, it is kept away from smoke.\r\n\r\nSmoking is done in special large chambers, the hams being hung from the\r\nceiling. In addition to the use of sawdust and wood shavings in making\r\nsmoke, branches of juniper are often used, and occasionally beech and\r\nalder woods; oak and resinous woods are positively avoided. The smoking is\r\ncarried on slowly. It is recommended to smoke for a few days cautiously,\r\nthat is, to have the smoke not too strong. Then expose the hams for a few\r\ndays in the fresh air, repeating in this way until they are brown enough.\r\nThe hams are actually in smoke two or three weeks, thus the whole process\r\nof smoking requires about six weeks. Hams are preserved after their\r\nsmoking in a room which is shady, not accessible to the light, but at the\r\nsame time dry, cool and airy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIG AND THE ORCHARD.\r\n\r\nThe two go together well. The pig stirs up the soil about the trees,\r\nletting in the sunshine and moisture to the roots and fertilizing them,\r\nwhile devouring many grubs that would otherwise prey upon the fruit. But\r\nmany orchards cannot be fenced and many owners of fenced orchards, even,\r\nwould like to have the pig confine his efforts around the trunk of each\r\ntree. To secure this have four fence panels made and yard the pig for a\r\nshort time in succession about each tree, as suggested in the diagram,\r\nFig. 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. FENCE FOR ORCHARD TREE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDRY SALTING BACON AND SIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor hogs weighing not over 125 or 130 lbs. each, intended for dry curing,\r\none bushel fine salt, two pounds brown sugar and one pound saltpeter will\r\nsuffice for each 800 lbs. pork before the meat is cut out; but if the meat\r\nis large and thick, or weighs from 150 to 200 lbs. per carcass, from a\r\ngallon to a peck more of salt and a little more of both the other articles\r\nshould be taken. Neither the sugar nor the saltpeter is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the preservation of the meat, and they are often omitted.\r\nBut both are preservatives; the sugar improves the flavor of the bacon,\r\nand the saltpeter gives it greater firmness and a finer color, if used\r\nsparingly. Bacon should not be so sweet as to suggest the \"sugar-cure;\"\r\nand saltpeter, used too freely, hardens the tissues of the meat, and\r\nrenders it less palatable. The quantity of salt mentioned is enough for\r\nthe first salting. A little more\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SALT IS ADDED AT THE SECOND SALTING\r\n\r\nand used together with the old salt that has not been absorbed. If sugar\r\nand saltpeter are used, first apply about a teaspoonful of pulverized\r\nsaltpeter on the flesh side of the hams and shoulders, and then taking a\r\nlittle sugar in the hand, apply it lightly to the flesh surface of all the\r\npieces. A tablespoonful is enough for any one piece.\r\n\r\nIf the meat at the time of salting is moist and yielding to the touch,\r\nrubbing the skin side with the gloved hand, or the \"sow's ear,\" as is\r\nsometimes insisted on, is unnecessary; the meat will take salt readily\r\nenough without this extra labor. But if the meat is rigid, and the weather\r\nvery cold, or if the pieces are large and thick, rubbing the skin side to\r\nmake it yielding and moist causes the salt to penetrate to the center of\r\nthe meat and bone. On the flesh side it is only necessary to sprinkle the\r\nsalt over all the surface. Care must be taken to get some salt into every\r\ndepression and into the hock end of all joints. An experienced meat salter\r\ngoes over the pieces with great expedition. Taking a handful of the salt,\r\nhe applies it dextrously by a gliding motion of the hand to all the\r\nsurface, and does not forget the hock end of the bones where the feet have\r\nbeen cut off. Only dry salt is used in this method of curing. The meat is\r\nnever put into brine or \"pickle,\" nor is any water added to the salt to\r\nrender it more moist.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST DISTRIBUTION OF THE SALT.\r\n\r\nA rude platform or bench of planks is laid down, on which the meat is\r\npacked as it is salted. A boy hands the pieces to the packer, who lays\r\ndown first a course of middlings and then sprinkles a little more salt on\r\nall the places that do not appear to have quite enough. Next comes a layer\r\nof shoulders and then another layer of middlings, until all these pieces\r\nhave been laid. From time to time a little more salt is added, as appears\r\nto be necessary. The hams are reserved for the top layer, the object being\r\nto prevent them from becoming too salt. In a large bulk of meat the brine,\r\nas it settles down, lodges upon the lower pieces, and some of them get\r\nrather more than their quota of salt. Too much saltiness spoils the hams\r\nfor first-class bacon. In fact, it spoils any meat to have it too salt,\r\nbut it requires less to spoil the hams, because, as a rule, they are\r\nmostly lean meat. The jowls, heads and livers, on account of the quantity\r\nof blood about them, are put in a separate pile, after being salted. The\r\nchines and spareribs are but slightly salted and laid on top of the bulk\r\nof neat meat. The drippings of brine and blood from the meat are collected\r\nin buckets and sent to the compost heaps. If there are rats, they must be\r\ntrapped or kept out in some way. Cats, also, should be excluded from the\r\nhouse. Close-fitting boxes, which some use to keep the rats from the meat,\r\nare not the best; the meat needs air.\r\n\r\nIn ten days to three weeks, according to weather and size of the meat,\r\nbreak bulk and resalt, using the old salt again, with just a little new\r\nsalt added. In four to six weeks more, or sooner, if need be, break up and\r\nwash the meat nicely, preparatory to smoking it. Some farmers do not wash\r\nthe salt off, but the meat receives smoke better and looks nicer, if\r\nwashed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING PORK FOR THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nThis requires a little different treatment. It is dry-salted and smoked.\r\nThe sides, hams and shoulders are laid on a table and rubbed thoroughly\r\nwith salt and saltpeter (one ounce to five pounds of salt), clear\r\nsaltpeter being rubbed in around the ends of the bones. The pieces are\r\nlaid up, with salt between, and allowed to lie. The rubbing is repeated at\r\nintervals of a week until the meat is thoroughly salted through, and it is\r\nthen smoked. It must afterward be left in the smokehouse, canvased or\r\nburied in a box of ashes, to protect it from the flies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSMOKING AND SMOKEHOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor best quality of bacon, the proper meat is of first importance. Withes\r\nor strings of basket wood, bear's grass, or coarse, stout twine, one in\r\nthe hock end of each ham and shoulder, and two in the thick side of each\r\nmiddling, are fastened in the meat by which to suspend it for smoking.\r\nBefore it is hung up the entire flesh surface of the hams and shoulders,\r\nand sometimes the middlings also, is sprinkled thickly with fine black\r\npepper, using a large tin pepper box to apply it. Sometimes a mixture of\r\nabout equal parts of black and red pepper helps very much to impart a good\r\nflavor to the meat. It was thought formerly that black pepper, applied to\r\nmeat before smoking it, would keep the bacon bug (Dermestes) \"skippers\"\r\nfrom being troublesome. But it is now known that the skipper skips just as\r\nlively where the pepper is. The meat is hung upon sticks or on hooks\r\noverhead very close together, without actually touching, and is ready for\r\nsmoking.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMOKEHOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe meat house is of course one with an earth, brick, or cement floor,\r\nwhere the fire for the smoke is made in a depression in the center of the\r\nroom, so as to be as far as possible from the walls. A few live coals are\r\nlaid down, and a small fire is made of some dry stuff. As it gets well to\r\nburning, the fire is smothered with green hickory or oak wood, and a\r\nbasket of green chips from the oak or hickory woodpile is kept on hand and\r\nused as required to keep the fire smothered so as to produce a great smoke\r\nand but little blaze. If the chips are too dry they are kept wet with\r\nwater. Care is taken not to allow the fire to get too large and hot, so as\r\nto endanger the meat hung nearest to it. Should the fire grow too strong,\r\nas it sometimes will, a little water is thrown on, a bucketful of which is\r\nkept always on hand. The fire requires constant care and nursing to keep\r\nup a good smoke and no blaze. Oak and hickory chips or wood impart the\r\nbest color to meat. Some woods, as pine, ailanthus, mulberry and\r\npersimmon, are very objectionable, imparting a disagreeable flavor to the\r\nbacon. Corn cobs make a good smoke for meat, but they must be wet before\r\nlaying them on the fire. Hardwood sawdust is sometimes advantageously used\r\nin making a fire for smoking meats. No blaze is formed, and if it burns\r\ntoo freely can be readily checked by sprinkling a little water upon it.\r\nThis is a popular method in parts of Europe, and in that country damp\r\nwheat straw is also sometimes used to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBINED SMOKEHOUSE AND OVEN.\r\n\r\nThe oven, shown in Fig. 18, occupies the front and that part of the\r\ninterior which is represented in our illustration by the dotted lines. The\r\nsmokehouse occupies the rear, and extends over the oven. The advantages of\r\nthis kind of building are the perfect dryness secured, which is of great\r\nimportance in preserving the meat, and the economy in building the two\r\ntogether, as the smoke that escapes from the oven may be turned into the\r\nsmokehouse. This latter feature, however, will not commend itself to many\r\nwho prefer the use of certain kinds of fuel in smoking which are not\r\nadapted to burning in a bake oven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. COMBINATION SMOKEHOUSE AND OVEN.]\r\n\r\nCloudy and damp days are the best for smoking meat. It seems to receive\r\nthe smoke more freely in such weather, and there is also less danger of\r\nfire. The smoke need not be kept up constantly, unless one is in a hurry\r\nto sell the meat. Half a day at a time on several days a week, for two or\r\nthree weeks, will give the bacon that bright gingerbread color which is\r\ngenerally preferred. It should not be made too dark with smoke. It is a\r\ngood plan, after the meat is smoked nearly enough, to smoke it\r\noccasionally for half a day at a time all through the spring until late in\r\nMay. It is thought that smoke does good in keeping the Dermestes out of\r\nthe house. The work of smoking may be finished up in a week, if one\r\nprefers, by keeping up the smoke all day and at night until bedtime. Some\r\nsmoke more, others less, according to fancy as to color. No doubt, the\r\nmore it is smoked, the better the bacon will keep through the summer. But\r\nit need not, and, in fact, should not, be made black with smoke.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, before the smoking is quite completed, to remove the meat\r\nthat is in the center just over the fire to one side, and to put the\r\npieces from the sides in the center. The meat directly over the smoke\r\ncolors faster than that on the sides, although the house is kept full of\r\nsmoke constantly. Some farmers do not care to risk the safety of their\r\nmeat by having an open fire under it, and so set up an old stove, either\r\nin the room or on the outside, in which latter case a pipe lets the smoke\r\ninto the house. A smoldering fire is then kept up with corn cobs or chips.\r\nBut there is almost as much danger this way as the other. The stovepipe\r\nmay become so hot as to set fire to the walls of the house where it\r\nenters, or a blaze may be carried within if there is too much fire in the\r\nstove. There is some risk either way, but with a properly built\r\nsmokehouse, there is no great danger from the plan described.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEAT IS NOW CURED\r\n\r\nand, if these directions have been observed, the farmer has a supply of\r\nbacon as good as the world can show. Some may prefer a \"shorter cut\" from\r\nthe slaughter pen to the baking pan, and with their pyroligenous acid may\r\nscout the old-fashioned smoke as heathenish, and get their bacon ready for\r\neating in two hours after the salt has struck in. But they never can show\r\nsuch bacon by their method as we can by ours. There is but one way to have\r\nthis first-class bacon and ham, and that way is the one herein portrayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A SMOKEHOUSE FIREPROOF\r\n\r\nas far as the stove ashes are concerned, is not necessarily an expensive\r\njob; all that is required is to lay up a row of brick across one end,\r\nalso two or three feet back upon each side, connecting the sides with a\r\nrow across the building, making it at least two feet high. As those who\r\nhave a smokehouse use it nearly every year, that part can also be made\r\nsafe from fire by the little arch built at the point shown in the\r\nillustration, Fig. 19. The whole is laid up in mortar, and to add strength\r\nto the structure an iron rod or bar may be placed across the center of the\r\nbin and firmly imbedded in the mortar, two or three rows of brick from the\r\ntop. Of course, the rear of the arch is also bricked up. In most cases,\r\nless than 250 brick will be all that is required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. FIREPROOFING A SMOKEHOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA WELL ARRANGED SMOKEHOUSE.\r\n\r\nA simple but satisfactory smokehouse is shown in the illustration, Fig.\r\n20, and can be constructed on the farm at small cost. It is so arranged as\r\nto give direct action of smoke upon the meat within, and yet free from the\r\nannoyance that comes from entering a smoke-filled room to replenish the\r\nfire. The house is square, and of a size dependent upon the material one\r\nmay have yearly to cure by smoke. For ordinary use, a house ten feet\r\nsquare will be ample. There are an entrance door on one side and a small\r\nwindow near the top that can be opened from the outside to quickly free\r\nthe inside from the smoke when desired. At the bottom of one side is a\r\nsmall door, from which extends a small track to the center of the room.\r\nUpon this slides a square piece of plank, moved by an iron rod with a hook\r\non one end. On the plank is placed an old iron kettle, Fig. 21, with four\r\nor five inches of earth in the bottom, and upon this is the fire to be\r\nbuilt. The kettle can be slid to the center of the room with an iron rod\r\nand can be drawn to the small door at any time to replenish the fire\r\nwithout entering the smoky room or allowing the smoke to come out. The\r\nhouse has an earthen floor and a tight foundation of stone or brick. The\r\nwalls should be of matched boarding and the roof shingled. The building is\r\nmade more attractive in appearance if the latter is made slightly\r\n\"dishing.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. FARM SMOKEHOUSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. FIRE, KETTLE AND TRACK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKING MEATS IN A SMALL WAY.\r\n\r\nA fairly good substitute for a smokehouse, where it is desired to\r\nimprovise something for temporary use in smoking hams or other meat, may\r\nbe found in a large cask or barrel, arranged as shown in the engraving,\r\nFig. 22. To make this effective, a small pit should be dug, and a flat\r\nstone or a brick placed across it, upon which the edge of the cask will\r\nrest. Half of the pit is beneath the barrel and half of it outside. The\r\nhead and bottom may be removed, or a hole can be cut in the bottom a\r\nlittle larger than the portion of the pit beneath the cask. The head or\r\ncover is removed, while the hams are hung upon cross sticks. These rest\r\nupon two cross bars, made to pass through holes bored in the sides of the\r\ncask, near the top. The head is then laid upon the cask and covered with\r\nsacks to confine the smoke. Some coals are put into the pit outside of the\r\ncask, and the fire is fed with damp corn cobs, hardwood chips, or fine\r\nbrush. The pit is covered with a flat stone, by which the fire may be\r\nregulated, and it is removed when necessary to add more fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. A BARREL SMOKEHOUSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER BARREL SMOKEHOUSE.\r\n\r\nFor those who have only the hams and other meats from one or two hogs to\r\nsmoke, a practicable smokehouse, like that shown in Fig. 23, will serve\r\nthe purpose fairly well. A large barrel or good-sized cask should be\r\nused, with both heads removed. A hole about a foot deep is dug to receive\r\nit, and then a trench of about the same depth and six or eight feet long,\r\nleading to the fireplace. In this trench can be laid old stovepipe and the\r\nground filled in around it. The meat to be smoked is suspended in the\r\nbarrel and the lid put on, but putting pieces under it, so there will be\r\nenough draft to draw the smoke through. By having the fire some distance\r\nfrom the meat, one gets the desired amount of smoke and avoids having the\r\nmeat overheated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. BARREL SMOKEHOUSE WITH FRENCH DRAFT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING BACONS AND HAMS.\r\n\r\nThe ideal meat house or smokehouse is a tall frame structure, twelve by\r\nfifteen or fifteen by eighteen feet, underpinned solidly with brick set a\r\nfoot or more into the ground, or with a double set of sills, the bottom\r\nset being buried in the soil. This mode of underpinning is designed to\r\nprevent thieves from digging under the wall and into the house. Stout,\r\ninch-thick boards are used for the weatherboarding, and sometimes the\r\nstuds are placed near enough together to prevent a person from getting\r\nthrough between them. The house is built tall to give more room for meat\r\nand to have it farther from the fire while it is being smoked. The\r\nweatherboarding and the roof should be tight to prevent too free escape of\r\nthe smoke. No window, and but one door, is necessary. The floor should be\r\nof clay, packed firm, or else laid in cement or brick. Indeed, it would be\r\nbetter to have the entire walls built of brick, but this would add\r\nconsiderably to the cost of construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROOM SHOULD BE LARGE ENOUGH\r\n\r\nto admit of a platform on one or both sides, upon which to pack the pork\r\nwhen salted. There should be a salt barrel, a large wooden tray made of\r\nplank, in which to salt the meat, and a short, handy ladder for reaching\r\nthe upper tier of joists. A large basket for holding chips, a tub for\r\nwater when smoking meat, a large chopping block and a meat axe, for the\r\nconvenience of the cook, are necessary articles for the meat house.\r\nNothing else should be allowed to cumber the room to afford a harbor for\r\nrats or to present additional material for a blaze, in case a spark from\r\nthe fire should snap out to a distance. The house should be kept neatly\r\nswept, and rats should not be allowed to make burrows under anything in\r\nthe room. The floor of the meat house should always be of some hard\r\nmaterial like cement or brick, or else clay pummeled very hard, so that\r\nthere would be no hiding place for the pupae of the Dermestes (parent of\r\nthe \"skipper\").\r\n\r\nThe skipper undergoes one or two moltings while in the meat, and at last\r\ndrops from the bacon to the floor, where, if the earth is loose, it\r\nburrows into the ground and, remaining all winter, comes out a perfect\r\nbeetle in spring. A hard, impervious floor will prevent it from doing\r\nthis, and compel it to seek a nesting place elsewhere. The reason why\r\ncountry bacon is sometimes so badly infested with the skipper is that the\r\nhouse and floor afford or become an excellent incubator, as it were, for\r\nthe Dermestes, and the bacon bugs become so numerous that all the meat\r\ngets infested with them. In case the floor of the smokehouse is soft and\r\nyielding, it becomes necessary each winter, before the meat is packed to\r\nsalt, to remove about two inches of the soil and put in fresh earth or\r\nclay in its place. Thus, many of the insects would be carried out, where\r\nthey would be destroyed. The walls and roof of the room on the interior\r\nshould also be swept annually to dislodge any pupae that might be\r\nhibernating in the cracks and crevices. With these precautions, there\r\nshould not be many of the pests left within the building, though it is a\r\nhard matter when a house once gets badly infested to dislodge them\r\nentirely. There are so many hiding places about a plain shingle roof that\r\nit is next to impossible not to have some of these insects permanently\r\nlodged in the meat house. But with a good, hard floor, frequent sweeping\r\nand the use of plenty of black pepper on the meat, the number of the\r\nDermestes should be reduced to the minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACON KEEPS NOWHERE SO WELL\r\n\r\nas in the house where it is smoked, and if the bugs do not get too\r\nnumerous it is decidedly better to allow it to remain hanging there. Bacon\r\nneeds air and a cool, dry, dark room for keeping well in summer. The least\r\ndegree of dampness is detrimental, causing the bacon to mold. It has been\r\nnoticed, however, that moldy bacon is seldom infested with the skipper.\r\nHence some people, to keep away the skippers, hang their bacon in a cellar\r\nwhere there is dampness, preferring to have it moldy rather than\r\n\"skippery.\" Some housekeepers preserve hams in close boxes or barrels, in\r\na cool, dark room, and succeed well. Others pack in shelled oats or bran,\r\nor wrap in old newspapers and lay away on shelves or in boxes. Inclosing\r\nin cloth sacks and painting the cloth is also practiced. All these plans\r\nare more or less successful, but oblige the housekeeper to be constantly\r\non the watch to prevent mice and ants from getting to the bacon. But if\r\nanyone should prefer\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EXCLUDE THE BUGS ENTIRELY\r\n\r\nfrom his meat the following contrivance is offered as a cheap and entirely\r\nsatisfactory arrangement: After the meat is thoroughly smoked, hang all of\r\nit close together, or at least all the hams, in the center of the house,\r\nand inclose it on all sides with a light frame over which is stretched\r\nthin cotton cloth, taking care that there shall be no openings in the\r\ncloth or frame through which the bugs might crawl. There let it hang all\r\nsummer. This contrivance will prevent the bug from getting at the meat to\r\ndeposit its eggs, and the thin, open fabric of the cloth will at the same\r\ntime admit plenty of air. The bottom or one side of the frame should be\r\nfixed upon hinges, for convenience in getting at the bacon as wanted. As\r\nthe bacon bug comes out in March, or April farther south, in February it\r\nis necessary to get the meat smoked and inclosed under the canvas before\r\nthe bug leaves its winter quarters. Hams may be thus kept in perfect\r\ncondition as long as may be desirable, and will remain sweet and nice many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOX FOR STORING BACON.\r\n\r\nIf the smokehouse is very dark and close, so that the flies or bugs will\r\nnot be tempted to or can get in, all that is necessary is to have the meat\r\nhung on the pegs; but, if not, even when the meat is bagged, there is\r\nstill some risk of worms. To provide a box that will be bugproof,\r\nratproof, and at the same time cool, as seen in the illustration, Fig. 24,\r\nmake a frame one inch thick and two or three inches wide, with a close\r\nplank bottom; cover the whole box with wire cloth, such, as is used for\r\nscreens. Let the wire cloth be on the outside, so that the meat will not\r\ntouch it. The top may be of plank and fit perfectly tight, so that no\r\ninsect can creep under. Of course, the box may be of any size desired. It\r\nwill be well to have the strips nailed quite closely together, say, about\r\none and a half inches apart. When the meat is put in, lay sticks between,\r\nso that the pieces will not touch. If the box is made carefully, it is\r\nbugproof and ratproof, affording ventilation at the same time, and so\r\npreventing molding. Meat should be kept in a dry and cool place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. SECURE BOX FOR STORING BACON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDELIGHTS ON PORK MAKING.\r\n\r\nThe trade in country dressed hogs varies materially from year to year.\r\nSince the big packing houses have become so prominent in the industry\r\nthere is, of course, less done in country dressed hogs, yet a market is\r\nalways found for considerable numbers. Thirty years ago Chicago received\r\nas many as 350,000 dressed hogs in one year. With a growth of the packing\r\nindustry this business decreased, until 1892, when only 5000 were handled\r\nat Chicago, but since that date there has been a revival of interest, with\r\nas many as 60,000 received in 1894 and an ever changing number since that\r\ndate. Thirty years ago the number of hogs annually packed at Chicago was\r\nabout 700,000. This business has increased since to as many as 8,000,000\r\nin a year, the industry in other packing centers being in much the same\r\nproportion. At all packing centers in the west there are slaughtered\r\nannually 20,000,000 to 24,000,000 hogs.\r\n\r\nCompared with the enormous numbers fattened and marketed on the hoof, a\r\nvery small proportion of the hogs turned off the farms each year are sold\r\ndressed. Yet with many farmers, particularly those who have only a small\r\nnumber to dispose of, it is always a question as to which is the better\r\nway to sell hogs, dressed or alive. No individual experience can be taken\r\nas a criterion, yet here is a record of what one Michigan farmer did in\r\nthe way of experiment. He had two lots of hogs to sell. One litter of\r\nseven weighed a total of 1605 lbs. alive, and dressed 1,335 lbs., which\r\nwas three pounds over a one-sixth shrinkage; one litter of five weighed\r\n1540 lbs. and dressed 1320 lbs., losing exactly one-seventh, they being\r\nvery fat. The sow weighed 517 lbs. and dressed 425, dressing away about 18\r\nlbs. to the 100 lbs. He was offered $3.80 per 100 lbs. live weight, for\r\nall the hogs, and $3 for the sow. He finally sold the seven hogs, dressed,\r\nat $5 per 100 lbs., the second lot of five at $4.75, and the sow at $4.25.\r\nHe decided that by dressing the hogs before selling, he gained about\r\n$12.50, aside from lard and trimmings. The experience here noted would not\r\nnecessarily hold good anywhere and any time. Methods employed in packing\r\nhogs have been brought down to such a fine point, however, with\r\npractically every portion utilized, that unless a farmer has a\r\nwell-defined idea where he can advantageously sell his dressed pork, it\r\nwould not pay, as a general thing, to butcher any considerable number of\r\nhogs, with a view of thus disposing of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EASILY FILLED PIG TROUGH.\r\n\r\nTo get swill into a pig trough is no easy matter if the hogs cannot be\r\nkept out until it is filled. The arrangement shown in Fig. 25 will be\r\nfound of much value and a great convenience. Before pouring in the swill,\r\nthe front end of the pen, in the form of a swinging door suspended from\r\nthe top, is placed in the position shown at _b_. The trough is filled and\r\nthe door allowed to assume the position shown at _a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. PIG TROUGH ATTACHMENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AID IN RINGING HOGS.\r\n\r\nA convenient trap for holding a hog while a ring is placed in its nose\r\nconsists of a trunk or a box without ends, 6 feet long, 30 inches high and\r\n18 inches wide, inside measure. This trunk has a strong frame at one end,\r\nto which the boards are nailed. The upper and lower slats are double, and\r\nbetween them a strong lever has free play. To accommodate large or small\r\npigs, two pins are set in the lower slat, against which the lever can\r\nbear. The pins do not go through the lever. This trunk is placed in the\r\ndoor of the pen, and two men are required to hold it and ring the hogs.\r\nWhen a hog enters and tries to go through, one man shoves the lever up,\r\ncatching him just back of the head, and holds him there. The second man\r\nthen rings him, and he is freed. Fig. 26 exhibits the construction of the\r\ntrap, in the use of which one can hold the largest hog with ease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. TRAP FOR HOLDING HOG.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE WEIGHTS OF LIVE HOGS.\r\n\r\nThe average weight of all hogs received at Chicago in 1898 was 234 lbs.;\r\nin 1896, 246 lbs. The average weight of all hogs received at Chicago in\r\n1895 was 230 lbs.; in 1894, 233 lbs.; in 1893, 240 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTREMES IN MARKET PRICE OF PORK AND LARD.\r\n\r\nThe highest price of mess pork at Chicago during the last forty years,\r\naccording to the Daily Trade Bulletin, was $44 per bbl. in 1864, and the\r\nlowest price $5.50 per bbl., paid in 1896. The highest price of lard was\r\nnaturally also in war times, 30c per lb. in 1865; the lowest price a shade\r\nmore than 3c, in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nNET TO GROSS.\r\n\r\nGood to prime hogs, when cut up into pork, hams, shoulders and lard, will\r\ndress out 73 to 75 per cent, according to the testimony of the large\r\npacking concerns. That is, for every 100 lbs. live weight, it is fair to\r\nestimate 73 to 75 lbs. of product of the classes named. If cut into ribs\r\ninstead of pork, prime hogs would net 70 to 72 per cent, while those which\r\nare not prime run as low as 65 per cent. For comparative purposes, it may\r\nbe well to note here that good farm-fed cattle will dress 54 to 56 per\r\ncent of their live weight in beef, the remainder being hide, fat, offal,\r\netc., and sheep will dress 48 to 54 per cent, 50 per cent being a fair\r\naverage.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE WEIGHTS OF PORTIONS OF CARCASS.\r\n\r\nTo determine the relation of the different parts of the hog as usually\r\ncut, to the whole dressed weight, the Alabama experiment station reports\r\nthe following results. The test was made with a number of light hogs\r\nhaving an average dressed weight of 137 lbs. The average weight of head\r\nwas 12.2 lbs.; backbone, 6.8 lbs.; the two hams, 25.4 lbs.; the two\r\nshoulders, 33.1 lbs.; leaf lard, 8.3 lbs.; ribs, 5.5 lbs.; the two\r\n\"middling\" sides, 35 lbs.; tender loin, 1.1 lbs.; feet, 3.6 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATES FOR HANDLING HOGS.\r\n\r\nThe device shown in the accompanying illustrations for handling hogs when\r\nthey are to be rung or for other purposes, is very useful on the ordinary\r\nfarm. Fig. 27 represents a chute and gate which will shut behind and\r\nbefore the hog and hold him in position. There is just room enough for him\r\nto stick his nose out, and while in this position rings can be inserted.\r\nThe sides of the chute must be much closer together than shown in the\r\nengraving, so that the hog cannot turn about. In fact, the width should be\r\njust sufficient to allow the hog to pass through. Fig. 28 represents the\r\nside view of another gate and pen, so arranged that the door can be opened\r\nand shut without getting into the pen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. HOG CHUTE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. DEVICE FOR OPENING GATE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING HOUSE CUTS OF PORK.\r\n\r\nWhile considering primarily the proper curing of pork for use on the farm\r\nand for home manufacture by farmers, it will not be out of the way to\r\nbecome acquainted with some of the leading cuts of meat as made by the\r\nbig pork packers at Chicago and elsewhere. In the speculative markets, a\r\nlarge business is done in \"mess pork,\" \"short ribs\" and lard. These are\r\nknown as the speculative commodities in pork product. The prices\r\nestablished, controlled largely by the amount offered and the character of\r\nthe demand, regulate to a considerable extent the market for other cuts of\r\npork, such as long clear middles, hams and shoulders. Our illustrations of\r\nsome of the leading cuts of meats, furnished us through the courtesy of\r\nHately Bros., prominent pork packers in Chicago, together with\r\naccompanying descriptions, give a very good idea of the shape pork product\r\ntakes as handled in the big markets of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. MESS PORK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. SHORT RIBS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. SHOULDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMESS PORK.\r\n\r\nThis standard cut, Fig. 29, is made from heavy fat hogs. The hog is first\r\nsplit down the back, the backbone being left on one side. Ham and\r\nshoulders taken off, the sides are then cut in uniform strips of four or\r\nfive pieces. Equal portions of both sides are then packed in barrels, 200\r\nlbs. net, the pieces numbering not more than sixteen nor less than nine.\r\nBarrels to be filled with a pickle made with 40 lbs. of salt to each\r\nbarrel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT RIBS.\r\n\r\nThese are made from the sides, with the ham and shoulder taken off and\r\nbackbone removed; haunchbone and breastbone sawed or cut down smooth and\r\nlevel with the face of the side. The pieces (Fig. 30) are made to average\r\n32 lbs. and over.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULDERS.\r\n\r\nRegular shoulders (Fig. 31), or commonly called dry salted shoulders, are\r\ncut off the sides between first and second ribs, so as not to expose\r\nforearm joint. Shank cut off at knee joint. Neck bone taken out and neck\r\ntrimmed smooth. Shoulders butted off square at top. Made to average 12 to\r\n14, 14 to 16, and 16 to 18 lbs. On the wholesale markets can usually be\r\nbought at about the price per pound of live hogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMS.\r\n\r\nAmerican cut hams are cut short inside the haunchbone, are well rounded at\r\nbutt and all fat trimmed off the face of the hams to make as lean as\r\npossible. See Fig. 32. Cut off above the hock joint. Hams are made to\r\naverage 10 to 12, 12 to 14, 14 to 16, 16 to 18, and 18 to 20 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICNIC HAMS.\r\n\r\nThis is a contradictory term, for the picnic ham is in truth a shoulder.\r\nPicnic hams (Fig. 33) are made from shoulders cut off sides between\r\nsecond and third ribs. Shank bone cut off one inch above knee joint, and\r\nneck bone taken out. Butt taken off through the middle of the blade and\r\nnicely rounded to imitate a ham. Made to average 5 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 10,\r\nand 10 to 14 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILTSHIRE CUT BACON.\r\n\r\nThis cut (Fig. 34) is from hogs weighing about 150 lbs. Formerly the hair\r\nwas removed by singeing, but this method is not so much employed now. The\r\nWiltshire bacon is consumed almost entirely in London, Bristol and the\r\nsouth of England generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. AMERICAN CUT HAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. PICNIC HAM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD LARD.\r\n\r\nThe following is the rule in force at Chicago for the manufacture of\r\nstandard prime steam lard: Standard prime steam lard shall be solely the\r\nproduct of the trimmings and other fat parts of hogs, rendered in tanks by\r\nthe direct application of steam and without subsequent change in grain or\r\ncharacter by the use of agitators or other machinery, except as such\r\nchange may unavoidably come from transportation. It must have proper\r\ncolor, flavor and soundness for keeping, and no material which has been\r\nsalted must be included. The name and location of the renderer and the\r\ngrade of the lard shall be plainly branded on each package at the time of\r\npacking.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUTRAL LARD.\r\n\r\nThis is made at the big packing houses from pure leaf lard, which after\r\nbeing thoroughly chilled is rendered in open tanks at a temperature of\r\nabout 120 degrees. The portion rendered at this temperature is run into\r\npackages and allowed to cool before closing tightly.\r\n\r\nLard stearine is made from the fat of hogs which is rendered and then\r\npressed and the oil extracted. The oil is used for lubricating purposes,\r\nand the stearine by lard refiners in order to harden the lard, especially\r\nin warm weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMAGNITUDE OF THE SWINE INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere it not for the foreign demand for our pork and pork product there\r\nwould be much less profit in fattening hogs for market than there is,\r\nirrespective of the price of corn and other feeds. England is our best\r\ncustomer, taking by far the larger part of our entire exports of all lard,\r\ncured meats and other hog product, but there is an encouraging trade with\r\nother foreign countries. The authorities at Washington are making every\r\neffort to enlarge this foreign outlet. Certain European countries, notably\r\nFrance and Germany, place irksome embargoes on American pork product.\r\nOstensibly, these foreign governments claim the quality and healthfulness\r\nof some of the American pork are in question, but in reality back of all\r\nthis is the demand from the German and French farmers that the competition\r\nafforded by American pork must be kept down. It is believed that\r\neventually all such restrictions will be swept away, through international\r\nagreement, and that thus our markets may be further extended, greatly\r\nbenefiting the American farmer. Our exports of hog product, including\r\npork, bacon, hams and lard, represent a value annually of about\r\n$100,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD'S SUPPLY OF BACON\r\n\r\nis derived chiefly from the United States, which enjoys an enormous trade\r\nwith foreign consuming countries, notably England and continental Europe.\r\nIrish bacon is received with much favor in the English markets, while\r\nWiltshire and other parts of England also furnish large quantities,\r\nspecially cured, which are great favorites among consumers. Some idea of\r\nthe magnitude of the foreign trade of the United States, so far as hog\r\nproduct is concerned, may be formed by a glance at the official figures\r\nshowing our exports in a single year. During the twelve months ended June\r\n30, 1899, the United States exported 563,000,000 lbs. bacon, 226,000,000\r\nlbs. ham, 137,000,000 lbs. pickled pork and 711,000,000 lbs. lard, a total\r\nof 1,637 million pounds pork product. On the supposition that live hogs\r\ndress out, roughly speaking, 70 per cent product, this suggests the\r\nenormous quantity of 2,340 million pounds of live hogs taken for the\r\nforeign trade in one year. Estimating the average weight at 240 lbs., this\r\nmeans nearly 10,000,000 hogs sent to American slaughterhouses in the\r\ncourse of one year to supply our foreign trade with pork product. The\r\nUnited Kingdom is by far our best customer, although we export liberal\r\nquantities to Belgium, Holland, Germany, France, Canada, Brazil, Central\r\nAmerica and the West Indies. Total value of our 1899 exports of pork\r\nproduct was $116,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. WILTSHIRE CUT BACON.]\r\n\r\nThe enormous business of the big packing houses, located chiefly in the\r\nwest, with a few in the east, can scarcely be comprehended in its extent.\r\nChicago continues to hold the prestige of the largest packing center in\r\nthe world, but other western cities are crowding it. In 1891 Chicago\r\nreceived 8,600,000 hogs, the largest on record, most of which were packed\r\nin that city, and the product shipped all over the world. In recent years\r\nthe Chicago receipts have averaged smaller, but the proportion going to\r\nthe packing concerns remains about the same. It is estimated that the hogs\r\nreceived at that city in 1898 had a value of $84,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATIVE CURING HOUSES IN DENMARK.\r\n\r\nAbout half the pork exported to England from Denmark is cured by the\r\nco-operative curing houses, established first in 1888 and since that date\r\ngreatly increased in number. Enormous quantities of cheap Black Sea barley\r\nhave been brought into Denmark the last few years, used principally for\r\nfodder. The principal advantage of the co-operative system, doing away\r\nwith the middleman, applies to these establishments. Farmers who raise\r\nhogs in a given district of say ten to twenty miles' circumference, unite\r\nand furnish the money necessary for the construction and operation of the\r\nco-operative curing establishment. The farmers bind themselves to deliver\r\nall hogs that they raise to the curing house, and severe fines are\r\ncollected when animals are sold elsewhere. At every curing house there is\r\na shop for the sale of sausage, fat, etc., these as a rule paying well and\r\nforming an important part of the profits in this co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOG PRICES AT CHICAGO, PER 100 POUNDS.\r\n\r\n                  Heavy packing,   Mixed packing,    Light bacon.\r\n  Year.          260 to 450 lbs.   200 to 250 lbs.  150 to 200 lbs.\r\n\r\n  1899               $3.10@4.75     $3.50@5.00     $3.75@5.00\r\n  1898                3.25@4.80      3.30@4.75      3.00@4.65\r\n  1897                3.00@4.50      3.20@4.60      3.20@4.65\r\n  1896                2.40@4.45      2.75@4.45      2.80@4.45\r\n  1895                3.25@5.45      3.25@5.55      3.25@5.70\r\n  1894                3.90@6.75      3.90@6.65      3.50@6.45\r\n  1893                3.80@8.75      4.25@8.65      4.40@8.50\r\n  1892                3.70@7.00      3.65@6.70      3.60@6.85\r\n  1891                3.25@5.70      3.25@5.75      3.15@5.95\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL PACKING AND MARKETING OF HOGS.\r\n\r\n[Year Ended March 1--Cincinnati Price Current.]\r\n\r\n                                           Receipts.\r\n                  Western      Eastern    N.

The illustration, Fig. 35, shows\r\na crate on wheels, with handles permitting it to be used as a wheelbarrow.\r\nInto this the pig can be driven, the door closed and the crate wheeled\r\naway. It will also be found a very useful contrivance in bringing in\r\ncalves that have been dropped by their dams in the pasture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. HANDY MOVABLE CRATE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERING THE MERITS OF ROAST PIG.\r\n\r\nBy Charles Lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of roasting, or rather broiling (which I take to be the elder\r\nbrother) was accidentally discovered in the manner following. The\r\nswineherd, Ho-ti, having gone out into the woods one morning, as his\r\nmanner was, to collect mast for his hogs, left his cottage in the care of\r\nhis eldest son, Bo-bo, a great, lubberly boy, who, being fond of playing\r\nwith fire, as younkers of his age commonly are, let some sparks escape\r\ninto a bundle of straw, which, kindling quickly, spread the conflagration\r\nover every part of their poor mansion, till it was reduced to ashes.\r\nTogether with the cottage (a sorry, antediluvian makeshift of a building,\r\nyou may think it), what was of much more importance, a fine litter of\r\nnew-farrowed pigs, no less than nine in number, perished. China pigs have\r\nbeen esteemed a luxury all over the east, from the remotest periods that\r\nwe read of. Bo-bo was in the utmost consternation, as you may think, not\r\nso much for the sake of the tenement, which his father and he could easily\r\nbuild up again with a few dry branches, and the labor of an hour or two,\r\nat any time, as for the loss of the pigs.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thinking what he should say to his father, and wringing his\r\nhands over the smoking remnants of one of those untimely sufferers, an\r\nodor assailed his nostrils, unlike any scent which he had before\r\nexperienced. What could it proceed from?--not from the burnt cottage--he\r\nhad smelt that smell before--indeed, this was by no means the first\r\naccident of the kind which had occurred through the negligence of this\r\nunlucky firebrand. Much less did it resemble that of any known herb, weed\r\nor flower. A premonitory moistening at the same time overflowed his nether\r\nlip. He knew not what to think. He next stooped down to feel the pig, if\r\nthere were any signs of life in it. He burnt his fingers, and to cool them\r\nhe applied them in his booby fashion to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of\r\nthe scorched skin had come away with his fingers, and for the first time\r\nin his life (in the world's life, indeed, for before him no man had known\r\nit), he tasted--crackling!\r\n\r\nAgain he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn him so much now,\r\nstill he licked his fingers from a sort of habit. The truth at length\r\nbroke into his slow understanding, that it was the pig that smelt so, and\r\nthe pig that tasted so delicious, and, surrendering himself up to the\r\nnew-born pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls of the scorched\r\nskin with the flesh next it, and was cramming it down his throat in his\r\nbeastly fashion, when his sire entered amid the smoking rafters, armed\r\nwith retributory cudgel, and, finding how affairs stood, began to rain\r\nblows upon the young rogue's shoulders, as thick as hailstones, which\r\nBo-bo headed not any more than if they had been flies. The tickling\r\npleasure, which he experienced in his lower regions, had rendered him\r\nquite callous to any inconveniences that he might feel in those remote\r\nquarters. His father might lay on, but he could not beat him from his pig\r\ntill he had made an end of it, when, becoming a little more sensible of\r\nhis situation, something like the following dialogue ensued:\r\n\r\n\"You graceless whelp, what have you got there devouring? Is it not enough\r\nthat you have burnt me down three houses with your dog's tricks, and be\r\nhanged to you! but you must be eating fire, and I know not what--what have\r\nyou got there, I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, father, the pig, the pig! do come and taste how nice the burnt pig\r\neats.\"\r\n\r\nThe ears of Ho-ti tingled with horror. He cursed his son, and he cursed\r\nhimself that ever he should beget a son that should eat burnt pig.\r\n\r\nBo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since morning, soon raked out\r\nanother pig, and fairly rending it asunder, thrust the lesser half by main\r\nforce into the fists of Ho-ti, still shouting out, \"Eat, eat, eat the\r\nburnt pig, father, only taste--O Lord!\" with suchlike barbarous\r\nejaculations, cramming all the while as if he would choke.\r\n\r\nHo-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped the abominable thing,\r\nwavering whether he should not put his son to death for an unnatural young\r\nmonster, when the crackling scorched his fingers, as it had done his\r\nson's, and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn tasted some of\r\nits flavor, which, make what sour mouths he would for a pretence, proved\r\nnot altogether displeasing to him. In conclusion, both father and son\r\nfairly sat down to the mess, and never left off till they had dispatched\r\nall that remained of the litter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCOOKING AND SERVING PORK.\r\n\r\nFIRST PRIZE WINNERS IN THE AMERICAN AGRICULTURIST CONTEST FOR BEST RECIPES\r\nFOR COOKING AND SERVING PORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK PIE.\r\n\r\nUnless you have a brick oven do not attempt this dish, as it requires a\r\nlong and even baking, which no stove oven can give. Make a good pie crust\r\nand line a large pan, one holding about 6 quarts; in the bottom put a\r\nlayer of thin slices of onions, then a layer of lean salt pork, which has\r\nbeen previously browned in the frying pan, next place a layer of peeled\r\napples, which sprinkle with a little brown sugar, using 1/2 lb. sugar to 3\r\nlbs. apples; then begin with onions, which sprinkle with pepper, pork and\r\napples again, and so on until the dish is full. Wet the edges of the\r\ncrust, put on the top crust, well perforated, and bake at least four\r\nhours, longer if possible. These pies are eaten hot or cold and are a\r\ngreat favorite with the English people. Potatoes may be used in place of\r\napples, but they do not give the meat so fine a flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK POTPIE.\r\n\r\nThree pounds pork (if salt pork is used, freshen it well), cut into inch\r\ncubes. Fry brown, add a large onion sliced, and a teaspoon each of chopped\r\nsage, thyme and parsley. Cover with 5 pints of water and boil for two\r\nhours, add a large pepper cut small or a pinch of cayenne, and a\r\ntablespoon of salt if fresh pork has been used. Add also 3 pints\r\nvegetables, carrots, turnips and parsnips cut small, boil half an hour\r\nlonger, when add a pint of potatoes cut into small pieces, and some\r\ndumplings. Cover closely, boil twenty minutes, when pour out into a large\r\nplatter and serve. The dumplings are made of 1 pint of flour, 1 teaspoon\r\nsalt, and 1 teaspoon baking powder, sifted together. Add 2 eggs, well\r\nbeaten and 1 cup of milk. Mix out all the lumps and drop by spoonfuls into\r\nthe stew. Serve this potpie with a salad of dandelion leaves, dressed with\r\nolive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK GUMBO.\r\n\r\nCut into small dice 2 lbs. lean pork. (In these recipes where the pork is\r\nstewed or baked in tomatoes or water, salt pork may be used, provided it\r\nis well freshened.) Fry the pork a pale brown, add 2 sliced onions, and\r\nwhen these are brown add 3 bell peppers sliced, and 2 quarts peeled\r\ntomatoes, with 2 teaspoons salt. Let boil gently, stirring frequently, for\r\n1-1/2 hours. Peel and cut small 1 pint of young tender okra pods, and add.\r\nCover again and boil half an hour longer. Cook in a lined saucepan, as tin\r\nwill discolor the okra. With this serve a large dish of rice or hominy.\r\nCorn may be used in place of okra if the latter is disliked. The corn\r\nshould be cut from the cobs and added half an hour before dinner time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCOTASH.\r\n\r\nBoil a piece of lean pork (about 5 lbs. in weight) in 3 quarts water,\r\nuntil the meat is tender. The next day take out the pork, and remove the\r\ngrease risen on the liquor from the pork during cooking. To 3 pints of the\r\nliquor add 1 pint of milk and 1-1/2 pints lima beans. Let them boil until\r\ntender--about one hour--when add 1-1/2 pints corn cut from the cob. Let\r\nthe whole cook for ten minutes, add a teaspoon of salt if necessary, half\r\na teaspoon of pepper, and drop in the pork to heat. When hot, pour into a\r\ntureen and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK PILLAU.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of pork (about 4 lbs.) and 2 lbs. bacon. Wash and put to boil\r\nin plenty of water, to which add a pepper pod, a few leaves of sage and a\r\nfew stalks of celery. One hour before dinner, dip out and strain 2 quarts\r\nof the liquor in which the pork is boiling, add to it a pint of tomatoes\r\npeeled, a small onion cut fine, and salt if necessary; boil half an hour,\r\nwhen add 1 pint of rice well washed. When it comes to a boil draw to the\r\nback of stove and steam until the rice is cooked and the liquor absorbed.\r\nThe pork must boil three or four hours. Have it ready to serve with the\r\nrice. This makes a good dinner, with a little green salad, bread and\r\nbutter and a good apple pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK ROLL.\r\n\r\nChop fine (a meat chopper will do the work well and quickly) 3 lbs. raw\r\nlean pork and 1/4 lb. fat salt pork. Soak a pint of white bread crumbs in\r\ncold water. When soft squeeze very dry, add to the chopped meat with a\r\nlarge onion chopped fine, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, 1/2 teaspoon each\r\nof chopped sage and thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix together\r\nthoroughly and form into a roll, pressing it closely and compactly\r\ntogether. Have ready about a tablespoon of fat in a frying pan, dredge the\r\nroll thickly with flour and brown it in the fat, turning it until nicely\r\nbrowned on all sides. Then place it in a baking pan, and bake in a hot\r\noven for one hour. Baste it every ten minutes with water. Do not turn or\r\ndisturb the meat after it has been put into the oven. Half an hour before\r\ndinner add 12 or 14 small carrots that have been parboiled in salted\r\nboiling water for fifteen minutes. When done, place the roll on a platter,\r\nsurround it with plain boiled macaroni, dot with the carrots and pour over\r\nall a nicely seasoned tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPER POT.\r\n\r\nCut 3 lbs. rather lean pork into 2-inch cubes, fry until brown, place in a\r\n3-quart stone pot (a bean jar is excellent for this purpose) having a\r\nclose-fitting lid; add 2 large onions sliced, 6 large green peppers (the\r\nbell peppers are the best, being fine in flavor and mild), a tablespoon of\r\nsalt (if fresh pork was used), and 3 large tomatoes peeled and cut small.\r\nFill the pot with water and place in the oven or on the back of the stove\r\nand allow to simmer five or six hours, or even longer. The longer it is\r\ncooked the better it will be. Persons who ordinarily cannot eat pork will\r\nfind this dish will do them no harm. The sauce will be rich and nicely\r\nflavored, and the meat tender and toothsome. Serve with it plenty of\r\nboiled rice or potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CROQUETTES (IN CABBAGE LEAVES).\r\n\r\nTo 1 lb. lean pork chopped fine add 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon each of\r\npepper, chopped sage and thyme, 1 teaspoon chopped parsley and a large\r\nonion also chopped. Mix well and stir in 2-3 cup (half-pint cup) of\r\nwell-washed raw rice. Wash a large cabbage, having removed all the\r\ndefective outer leaves. Plunge it whole into a large pot of boiling salted\r\nwater and boil for five minutes, remove and drain. This will render the\r\nleaves pliable. Let cool a little, when pull the leaves apart, and wrap in\r\neach leaf a tablespoon of the pork and rice. Wrap it up securely and\r\nneatly as if tying up a parcel and secure with wooden toothpicks or twine.\r\nWhen all are done, lay in a baking dish and cover with a quart of tomatoes\r\npeeled and cut fine, mixed with half a pint of water, and a teaspoon of\r\nsalt. Bake one hour in a hot oven, turning the croquettes occasionally. If\r\nthe sauce becomes too thick, dilute with a little hot water. When done,\r\ndish, pour over the sauce and serve with potatoes or hominy. These are\r\nvery good indeed. If desired the croquettes may be steamed over hot water\r\nin a steamer for three hours, or plunged directly into a kettle of boiling\r\nwater and boiled for one hour. They are not so delicate as when baked.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK WITH PEA PUDDING (ENGLISH STYLE).\r\n\r\nBoil the pork as directed above, and do not omit the vegetables, as they\r\nflavor the meat and the pudding. Use the yellow split peas and soak a pint\r\nin cold water over night. Drain and tie them loosely in a pudding bag and\r\nboil with the pork for three hours. An hour before dinner remove and press\r\nthrough a colander, add a teaspoon salt, half a teaspoon pepper and 3 eggs\r\nwell beaten. Chop enough parsley to make a teaspoonful, add to the peas\r\nwith a little grated nutmeg. Beat up well, sift in half a pint of flour\r\nand pour into a pudding bag. The same bag used before will do if well\r\nwashed. Tie it up tightly, drop into the pork water again and boil another\r\nhour. Remove, let drain in the colander a few minutes, when turn out onto\r\na dish. Serve with the pork, and any preferred sauce; mint sauce is good\r\nto serve with pork, and a tomato sauce is always good. In fact, it is a\r\nnatural hygienic instinct which ordains a tart fruit or vegetable to be\r\neaten with pork. The Germans, who are noted for their freedom from skin\r\ndiseases, add sour fruit sauces to inordinately fat meats.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK WITH SAUERKRAUT (GERMAN STYLE).\r\n\r\nBoil a leg of pork for three or four hours, wash 2 quarts sauerkraut, put\r\nhalf of it into an iron pot, lay on it the pork drained from the water in\r\nwhich it was cooking and cover with the remainder of sauerkraut, add 1\r\nquart water in which the pork was cooking, cover closely and simmer gently\r\nfor one hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CHOWDER.\r\n\r\nHave ready a quart of potatoes sliced, 2 large onions sliced, and 1 lb.\r\nlean salt pork. Cut the pork into thin slices and fry until cooked, drain\r\noff all but 1 tablespoon fat and fry the onions a pale brown. Then put the\r\ningredients in layers in a saucepan, first the pork, then onions, potatoes\r\nand so on until used, adding to each layer a little pepper. Add a pint of\r\nwater, cover closely and simmer fifteen minutes, then add a pint of rich\r\nmilk, and cover the top with half a pound of small round crackers. Cover\r\nagain and when the crackers are soft, serve in soup plates. If you live\r\nwhere clams are plentiful, add a quart of cleaved clams when the potatoes\r\nare almost done and cook ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA PIE.\r\n\r\nMake a crust of 1 quart flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt,\r\nmix well, rub in a tablespoon of fat--pork fat melted or lard--and mix\r\ninto a smooth paste with a pint of water. Line a deep pudding dish with\r\nthis, put in a layer of onions, then potatoes sliced, then a thin layer of\r\npork in slices, more onions, etc., until the dish is full. Wet the edges,\r\nput on a top crust. Tie a floured cloth over the top and drop into a pot\r\nof boiling water. Let the water come up two-thirds on the dish, and keep\r\nthe water boiling for four hours. Invert on a dish, remove the mold and\r\nserve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For Fresh Pork Only._\r\n\r\nCORN AND PORK SCALLOP.\r\n\r\nCut about 2 lbs. young pork into neat chops and reject all fat and bone.\r\nFry them until well cooked and of a pale brown, dust with salt and pepper.\r\nCut some green corn from the cob. Take a 2-quart dish, put a layer of corn\r\nin the bottom, then a layer of pork, and so on until the dish is full, add\r\n1 pint of water, cover and bake for one hour. Remove the cover fifteen\r\nminutes before serving, so the top may be nicely browned. Serve with\r\npotatoes and a lettuce salad. Onions and pork may be cooked in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUFFED SHOULDER OF PORK.\r\n\r\nTake a shoulder of pork and bone it. Cut out the shoulder blade, and then\r\nthe leg bone. After the cut made to extract the shoulder blade, the flesh\r\nhas to be turned over the bone as it is cut, like a glove-finger on the\r\nhand; if any accidental cut is made through the flesh it must be sewed up,\r\nas it would permit the stuffing to escape. For the stuffing, the following\r\nis extra nice: Peel 4 apples and core them, chop fine with 2 large onions,\r\n4 leaves of sage, and 4 leaves of lemon thyme. Boil some white potatoes,\r\nmash them and add 1 pint to the chopped ingredients with a teaspoon of\r\nsalt and a little cayenne. Stuff the shoulder with this and sew up all the\r\nopenings. Dredge with flour, salt and pepper and roast in a hot oven,\r\nallowing twenty minutes to the pound. Baste frequently, with hot water at\r\nfirst, and then with gravy from the pan. Serve with currant jelly,\r\npotatoes and some green vegetables. Another extra good stuffing for pork\r\nis made with sweet potatoes as a basis. Boil the potatoes, peel and mash.\r\nTo a half pint of potato add a quarter pint of finely chopped celery, 2\r\ntablespoons chopped onions, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, teaspoon each of salt and\r\nchopped parsley and a tablespoon of butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK ROASTED WITH TOMATOES.\r\n\r\nTake a piece for roasting and rub well with salt and pepper, dredge with\r\nflour, and pour into the pan a pint of hot water, and place in a brisk\r\noven. This must be done two or three hours before dinner, according to the\r\nsize of roast; baste the meat often. An hour before dinner peel some\r\ntomatoes (about a quart), put them into a bowl and mash with the hands\r\ntill the pulp is in fine pieces, add to them a chopped onion, a teaspoon\r\nof chopped parsley and 1/2 teaspoon each of sage and thyme. Draw the pan\r\ncontaining the roast to the mouth of oven and skim all the fat from the\r\ngravy; pour the tomatoes into the pan, and bake for one hour. With this\r\nserve a big dish of rice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK WITH SWEET POTATOES.\r\n\r\nPrepare the roast as described above, either stuffed or otherwise. When\r\npartly done, peel and cut some sweet potatoes into slices about three\r\ninches long. Bank these all around the meat, covering it and filling the\r\npan. Baste often with the gravy and bake one hour. Serve with this a\r\nRussian salad, made of vegetables. Young carrots may be used in place of\r\nsweet potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRARE OLD FAMILY DISHES, DESCRIBED FOR THIS WORK BY THE BEST COOKS IN\r\nAMERICA. EVERY ONE OF THESE RECIPES IS A SPECIAL FAVORITE THAT HAS BEEN\r\nOFTEN TRIED AND NEVER FOUND WANTING. NONE OF THESE RECIPES HAS EVER BEFORE\r\nBEEN PRINTED, AND ALL WILL BE FOUND SIMPLE, ECONOMICAL AND HYGIENIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ham._\r\n\r\nBOILED.\r\n\r\nWash well a salted, smoked pig's ham, put this in a large kettle of\r\nboiling water and boil until tender, remove from the kettle, take off all\r\nof the rind, stick in a quantity of whole cloves, place in a baking pan,\r\nsprinkle over with a little sugar, pour over it a cup of cider, or, still\r\nbetter, sherry. Place in the oven and bake brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR LUNCH.\r\n\r\nMince cold ham fine, either boiled or fried, add a couple of hard-boiled\r\neggs chopped fine, a tablespoon of prepared mustard, a little vinegar and\r\na sprinkling of salt. Put in a mold. When cold cut in thin slices or\r\nspread on bread for sandwiches.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONED.\r\n\r\nHaving soaked a well-cured ham in tepid water over night, boil it until\r\nperfectly tender, putting it on in warm water; take up, let cool, remove\r\nthe bone carefully, press the ham again into shape, return to the boiling\r\nliquor, remove the pot from the fire and let the ham remain in it till\r\ncold. Cut across and serve cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTED.\r\n\r\nMince left-over bits of boiled ham and to every 2 lbs. lean meat allow 1/2\r\nlb. fat. Pound all in a mortar until it is a fine paste, gradually adding\r\n1/2 teaspoon powdered mace, the same quantity of cayenne, a pinch of\r\nallspice and nutmeg. Mix very thoroughly, press into tiny jars, filling\r\nthem to within an inch of the top; fill up with clarified butter or\r\ndrippings and keep in a cool place. This is nice for tea or to spread\r\npicnic sandwiches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEW.\r\n\r\nA nice way to use the meat left on a ham bone after the frying slices are\r\nremoved is to cut it off in small pieces, put into cold water to cover\r\nand let it come to a boil. Pour off the water and add enough hot to make\r\nsufficient stew for your family. Slice an onion and potatoes into it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH VEAL.\r\n\r\nA delicious picnic dish is made of ham and veal. Chop fine equal\r\nquantities of each and put into a baking dish in layers with slices of\r\nhard-boiled eggs between; boil down the water in which the veal was\r\ncooked, with the bones, till it will jelly when cold; flavor with celery,\r\npepper and salt and pour over the meat. Cover with a piecrust half an inch\r\nthick and bake until the crust is done. Slice thin when cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOMELET.\r\n\r\nBeat 6 eggs very light, add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3 tablespoons sweet milk,\r\npepper to taste, have frying pan very hot with 1 tablespoon butter in;\r\nturn in the mixture, shake constantly until cooked, then put 1 cup finely\r\nchopped ham over the top and roll up like jelly cake, cut in slices.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED.\r\n\r\nMost persons boil ham. It is much better baked, if baked right. Soak it\r\nfor an hour in clean water and wipe dry. Next spread it all over with thin\r\nbatter and then put it into a deep dish, with sticks under it to keep it\r\nout of the gravy. When it is fully done, take off the skin and batter\r\ncrusted upon the flesh side, and set away to cool. It should bake from six\r\nto eight hours. After removing the skin, sprinkle over with two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sugar, some black pepper and powdered crackers. Put in\r\npan and return to the oven to brown; then take up and stick cloves through\r\nthe fat, and dust with powdered cinnamon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH CORN MEAL.\r\n\r\nTake bits of cold boiled ham, cut into fine pieces, put in a frying pan\r\nwith water to cover, season well. When it boils, thicken with corn meal,\r\nstirred in carefully, like mush. Cook a short time, pour in a dish to\r\nmold, slice off and fry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALLS.\r\n\r\nChop 1/2 pint cold boiled ham fine. Put a gill of milk in a saucepan and\r\nset on the fire. Stir in 1/2 teacup stale bread crumbs, the beaten yolks\r\nof 2 eggs and the ham. Season with salt, cayenne and a little nutmeg. Stir\r\nover the fire until hot, add a tablespoon chopped parsley, mix well and\r\nturn out to cool. When cold make into small balls, dip in beaten egg, then\r\nin bread crumbs and fry in boiling fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAST.\r\n\r\nRemove the fat from some slices of cold boiled ham, chop fine. Put 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan on the stove, add the chopped ham\r\nand half a cup of sweet cream or milk. Season with pepper and salt; when\r\nhot, remove from the stove and stir in quickly 3 well-beaten eggs. Pour\r\nonto toast and serve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAVORED WITH VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nTake a small ham, as it will be finer grained than a large one, let soak\r\nfor a few hours in vinegar and water, put on in hot water, then add 2\r\nheads of celery, 2 turnips, 3 onions and a large bunch of savory herbs. A\r\nglass of port or sherry wine will improve the flavor of the ham. Simmer\r\nvery gently until tender, take it out and remove the skin, or if to be\r\neaten cold, let it remain in the liquor until nearly cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATTIES.\r\n\r\nOne pint of ham which has previously been cooked, mix with two parts of\r\nbread crumbs, wet with milk. Put the batter in gem pans, break 1 egg over\r\neach, sprinkle the top thickly with cracker crumbs and bake until brown. A\r\nnice breakfast dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATTIES WITH ONIONS.\r\n\r\nTwo cups bread crumbs moistened with a little milk, and two cups cooked\r\nham thoroughly mixed. If one likes the flavor, add a chopped onion. Bake\r\nin gem pans. Either break an egg over each gem or chop cold hard-boiled\r\negg and sprinkle over them. Scatter a few crumbs on top. Add bits of\r\nbutter and season highly with pepper and salt, and brown carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED PATTIES.\r\n\r\nOne cup cold boiled ham (chopped fine), 1 cup bread crumbs, 1 egg, salt\r\nand pepper to taste, mix to the right thickness with nice meat dressing or\r\nsweet milk, mold in small patties and fry in butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAM SANDWICHES.\r\n\r\nMince your ham fine and add plenty of mustard, 3 eggs, 1 tablespoon flour,\r\n1 tablespoon butter and as much chopped cucumber pickles as you have ham.\r\nBeat this thoroughly together and pour into 1 pint of boiling vinegar, but\r\ndo not let the mixture boil. When it cools, spread between your\r\nsandwiches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt Pork._\r\n\r\nFRIED WITH FLOUR.\r\n\r\nSlice the pork thinly and evenly, placing it in a large frying pan of\r\nwater, and turning it twice while freshening. This prevents it humping in\r\nthe middle, as pork, unless the slices are perfectly flat, cannot be fried\r\nevenly. When freshened sufficiently, drain, throw the water off, and,\r\nrolling each slice in flour, return to the frying pan. Fry a delicate\r\nbrown, place on a platter dry, add slices of lemon here and there. Drain\r\nall the frying fat off, leaving a brown sediment in the pan. Pour 1 cup of\r\nrich milk on this, and when it thickens (keep stirring constantly until of\r\nthe consistency of rich, thick cream), pour into a gravy boat, and dust\r\nwith pepper.--[M. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED PORK AND GRAVY.\r\n\r\nCut the rind from a firm piece of fat salt pork that has a few streaks of\r\nlean (if preferred). Slice thin, scald in hot water, have the frying pan\r\nsmoking hot, put in the slices of pork and fry (without scorching) until\r\ncrisp. Then pour off nearly all the fat, add some hot water after the\r\nslices have been removed from the pan, and stir in some flour moistened\r\nwith cold water for a thickened gravy.--[Farmer's Wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED IN BATTER OR WITH APPLES.\r\n\r\nSlice thin and fry crisp in a hot frying pan, then dip in a batter made as\r\nfollows: One egg well beaten, 3 large spoons rich milk, and flour enough\r\nto make a thin batter. Fry once more until the batter is a delicate brown,\r\nand if any batter remains it may be fried as little cakes and served with\r\nthe pork. Instead of the batter, apples, sliced, may be fried in the fat,\r\nwith a little water and sugar added, or poor man's cakes, made by scalding\r\n4 spoons granulated (or other) corn meal with boiling water, to which add\r\na pinch of salt and 1 egg, stirred briskly in.--[F. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET FRIED.\r\n\r\nTake nice slices of pork, as many as you need, and parboil in buttermilk\r\nfor five minutes, then fry to a golden brown. Or parboil the slices in\r\nskimmilk, and while frying sprinkle on each slice a little white sugar and\r\nfry a nice brown. Be watchful while frying, as it burns very easily after\r\nthe sugar is on.--[I. M. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRY IN BATTER.\r\n\r\nPrepare as for plain fried pork, fry without dipping in flour, and when\r\ndone, dip into a batter made as follows: One egg beaten light, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of milk and the same of sifted flour, or enough to make a\r\nthin batter. Stir smooth, salt slightly, dip the fried pork into it and\r\nput back into the hot drippings. Brown slightly on both sides, remove to a\r\nhot platter and serve immediately.--[R. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED WITH SAGE.\r\n\r\nFreshen the pork in the usual manner with water or soaking in milk, partly\r\nfry the pork, then put three or four freshly picked sprigs of sage in the\r\nfrying pan with the pork. When done, lay the crisp fried sage leaves on\r\nplatter with the pork.--[Mrs. W. L. R.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. BISBEE'S CREAMED PORK.\r\n\r\nSlice as many slices as your frying pan will hold, pour on cold water,\r\nplace upon the range to freshen; when hot, pour off the water and fry\r\nuntil crispy; take out upon a platter, pour the fat in a bowl. Pour some\r\nmilk, about a pint, in the frying pan, boil, thicken and pour upon the\r\nfried pork. Serve at once.--[Mrs. G. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of salt pork as large as needed, score it neatly and soak in\r\nmilk and water half an hour, or longer if very salt; put into a baking pan\r\nwith water and a little flour sprinkled over the scoring. Bake until\r\ndone. Always make a dressing to eat with this, of bread and cracker\r\ncrumbs, a lump of butter, an egg, salt, pepper and sage to taste; mix with\r\nhot milk, pack in a deep dish and bake about twenty minutes. Keep water in\r\nthe baking dish after the meat is taken up, pour off most of the fat and\r\nthicken the liquor. Tomatoes go well with this dish, also cranberry sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED.\r\n\r\nBoil 4 or 5 lbs. of pork having streaks of lean in it, in plenty of water,\r\nfor one and one-half hours. Take out, remove skin, cut gashes across the\r\ntop, sprinkle over powdered sage, pepper and rolled crackers. Brown in the\r\noven. Slice when cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED IN MILK AND WATER.\r\n\r\nFreshen 10 or 12 slices of fat pork and fry a nice brown, then take up the\r\npork and arrange on a deep platter. Next pour off half the fat from the\r\nfrying pan and add 1 cup of milk and 1 of boiling water, and 1 tablespoon\r\nflour mixed with a little cold milk or water, or else sifted in when the\r\nmilk and water begin to boil, but then a constant stirring is required to\r\nprevent it from being lumpy. Next add a pinch of salt and a dust of\r\npepper, let it boil up, and pour over the pork. Enough for six.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG PORK.\r\n\r\nTake slices of pork and parboil in water, sprinkle a little pepper on the\r\npork and put into the frying pan with a small piece of butter and fry.\r\nTake 1 egg and a little milk and beat together. When the meat is nearly\r\ndone, take each slice and dip into the egg, lay back in the pan and cook\r\nuntil done.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED PORK.\r\n\r\nTake 6 slices nice pork, or as many as will fry in the frying pan, and\r\nparboil for five minutes, then take out of the water and roll one side of\r\neach slice in flour and fry to a golden brown. When fried, turn nearly all\r\nof the fat off and set the pan on the stove again and turn on a cup of\r\nnice sweet cream; let it boil up, then serve on a platter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soups, Stews, Etc._\r\n\r\nPORK SOUP.\r\n\r\nPut pork bones in pot of cold salted water. Add the following ingredients,\r\nin a cheesecloth bag: A few pepper seeds, a bit of horse-radish, mace, and\r\n1 sliced turnip. Boil as for beef soup; strain and add a teaspoon of rice\r\nflour to each pint, and let come to a boil. Serve with crackers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK STEW\r\n\r\nSlice and fry in a kettle from 1/4 to 1/2 lb. salt pork, drain off the fat\r\nand save for shortening, add 3 pints boiling water, 2 or 3 onions sliced\r\nthin, 1 quart potatoes sliced and pared, a sprinkling of pepper, large\r\nspoon flour mixed in 1 cup of cold water. Let the onions boil a few\r\nmoments before adding the potatoes and flour. Five minutes before serving,\r\nadd 1 dozen crackers, split and moistened with hot water, or make\r\ndumplings as for any stew.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRY STEW.\r\n\r\nPlace slices of pork in the frying pan and fill full with chipped\r\npotatoes; pour over a little water and cover tightly, and cook until the\r\npork begins to fry, then loosen from the bottom with a wide knife and\r\npour over more water, and so on until done. Pepper and salt and a bit of\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD-FASHIONED STEW.\r\n\r\nPlace 6 large slices of pork in the kettle with nearly a quart of water,\r\nlet it boil half an hour, then add 8 sliced potatoes and 2 sliced onions,\r\nand when nearly done add a little flour, pepper and salt, and a lump of\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOWDER.\r\n\r\nCut 4 slices of salt pork in dice, place in kettle and fry, add 6\r\ngood-sized onions chopped fine, let fry while preparing 8 potatoes, then\r\nadd 1 quart boiling water and the potatoes sliced thin. Season with salt\r\nand pepper to taste. Boil one-half hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous._\r\n\r\nBACON, BROILED OR FRIED.\r\n\r\nThe first essential is to have the bacon with a streak of lean and a\r\nstreak of fat, and to cut or slice it as thin as possible. Then lay it in\r\na shallow tin and set it inside a hot stove. It will toast evenly and the\r\nslices will curl up and be so dry that they may be taken in the fingers to\r\neat. The lard that exudes may be thickened with flour, a cup of sweet new\r\nmilk and a pinch of black pepper added, and nice gravy made. Or if\r\npreferred, the bacon, thinly sliced, may be fried on a hot skillet, just\r\nturning it twice, letting it slightly brown on both sides. Too long in the\r\nhot skillet, the bacon gets hard and will have a burned taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAINS.\r\n\r\nLay the brains in salt and water for an hour to draw out the blood. Pick\r\nthem over and take out any bits of bone and membrane. Cook for half an\r\nhour in a small quantity of water. When cooked drain off the water, and to\r\neach brain add a little pepper, nearly an even teaspoon of salt, a\r\ntablespoon of butter and 1 beaten egg. Cook until the egg thickens. Or\r\nwhen the brains are cooked, drain off the water, season with salt, pepper\r\nand sage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK AND BEANS.\r\n\r\nPick over and let soak over night 1 quart beans; in the morning wash and\r\ndrain, and place in a kettle with cold water, with 1/2 teaspoon soda, boil\r\nabout twenty minutes, then drain and put in earthen bean dish with 2\r\ntablespoons molasses, season with pepper. In the center of the beans put 1\r\nlb. well-washed salt pork, with the rind scored in slices or squares, rind\r\nside uppermost. Cover all with hot water and bake six hours or longer, in\r\na moderate oven. Keep covered so they will not burn on the top, but an\r\nhour or so before serving remove the pork to another dish and allow it to\r\nbrown. Beans should also brown over the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED DINNER.\r\n\r\nPut a piece of salt pork to cook in cold water about 9 o'clock. At 10\r\no'clock add a few beets, at 11 o'clock a head of cabbage, quartered.\r\nOne-half hour later add the potatoes. Serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN WICK-A-WACK.\r\n\r\nSave the rinds of salt pork, boil until tender, then chop very fine, add\r\nan equal amount of dried bread dipped in hot water and chopped. Season\r\nwith salt, pepper and summer savory; mix, spread one inch deep in baking\r\ndish, cover with sweet milk. Bake one-half hour. Very nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED PORK.\r\n\r\nSoak the pork in cold water over night. Wipe dry and broil over coals\r\nuntil crisp. Pour over it 1/2 pint sweet cream. Ham cooked this way is\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNCH LOAF.\r\n\r\nChop remnants of cold boiled ham or salt pork, add crushed crackers and\r\nfrom 3 to 6 eggs, according to the amount of your meat. Bake in a round\r\nbaking powder box, and when cold it can be sliced for the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK HASH.\r\n\r\nTake scraps of cold pork and ham, chop very fine, put in frying pan, add a\r\nvery little water, let cook a few minutes, then add twice this amount of\r\nchopped potato. Salt and pepper to taste, fry and serve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR SUNDAY LUNCHEON.\r\n\r\nTake the trimmings saved from ribs, backbone, jowl, shanks of ham and\r\nshoulder, and all the nice bits of meat too small for ordinary use; place\r\nin a kettle with sufficient water to barely cover meat, and boil slowly\r\nuntil quite tender. Fit a piece of stout cheesecloth in a flat-bottomed\r\ndish and cover with alternate strips of fat and lean meat while hot;\r\nsprinkle sparingly with white pepper, add another layer of meat and a few\r\nvery thin slices of perfectly sound tart apples. Repeat until pork is\r\nused, then sew up the ends of the cloth compactly, place between agate\r\nplatters and subject to considerable pressure over night. Served cold this\r\nmakes a very appetizing addition to Sunday suppers or luncheon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CHEESE.\r\n\r\nCut 2 lbs. cold roast pork into small pieces, allowing 1/4 lb. fat to each\r\npound of lean; salt and pepper to taste. Pound in a mortar a dessert\r\nspoon minced parsley, 4 leaves of sage, a very small bunch of savory\r\nherbs, 2 blades of mace, a little nutmeg, half a teaspoon of minced lemon\r\npeel. Mix thoroughly with the meat, put into a mold and pour over it\r\nenough well-flavored strong stock to make it very moist. Bake an hour and\r\na half and let it cool in the mold. Serve cold, cut in thin slices and\r\ngarnished with parsley or cress. This is a cooking school recipe. For\r\nordinary use the powdered spices, which may be obtained at almost any\r\ncountry store, answer every purpose. Use 1/4 teaspoon sage, 1/2 teaspoon\r\neach of summer savory and thyme, and a pinch of mace.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK FLOUR-GRAVY.\r\n\r\nTake the frying pan after pork has been fried in it, put in a piece of\r\nbutter half as large as an egg, let it get very hot, then put in a\r\nspoonful of flour sprinkled over the bottom of the pan. Let this get\r\nthoroughly browned, then turn boiling water on it, say about a pint. Now\r\ntake a tablespoon of flour, heaping, wet it up with a cup of sweet milk\r\nand stir into the boiling water, add salt and pepper to taste, and a small\r\npiece more butter, cook well and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK OMELET.\r\n\r\nCut the slices of pork quite thin, discarding the rind, fry on both sides\r\nto a light brown, remove from the spider, have ready a batter made of from\r\n2 or 3 eggs (as the amount of pork may require), beaten up with a little\r\nflour and a little sweet milk, pouring half of this batter into the\r\nspider. Then lay in the pork again, and pour the remaining part of the\r\nbatter over the pork. When cooked on the one side, cut in squares and\r\nturn. Serve hot. Sometimes the pork is cut in small squares before adding\r\nthe batter.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER OMELET.\r\n\r\nPut 1 cup cold fried salt pork (cut in dice) and 3 tablespoons sweet milk\r\non back of stove to simmer, then beat 6 eggs and 1 teaspoon salt until\r\njust blended. Put 2 tablespoons butter in frying pan. When hot add eggs\r\nand shake vigorously until set, then add the hot creamed pork, spread over\r\ntop, fold, and serve immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIG'S FEET.\r\n\r\nCut off the feet at the first joint, then cut the legs into as many pieces\r\nas there are joints, wash and scrape them well and put to soak over night\r\nin cold, slightly salted water; in the morning scrape again and change the\r\nwater; repeat at night. The next morning put them on to boil in cold water\r\nto cover, skim carefully, boil till very tender, and serve either hot or\r\ncold, with a brown sauce made of part of the water in which they were\r\nboiled, and flavored with tomato or chopped cucumber pickles. If the pig's\r\nfeet are cooled and then browned in the oven, they will be much nicer than\r\nif served directly from the kettle in which they were boiled. Save all the\r\nliquor not used for the sauce, for pig's feet are very rich in jelly; when\r\ncold, remove the fat, which should be clarified, and boil the liquor down\r\nto a glaze; this may be potted, when it will keep a long time and is\r\nuseful for glazing, or it may be used for soups either before or after\r\nboiling, down.--[R. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED PIG'S FEET.\r\n\r\nClean them well, boil until very tender, remove all the bones. Chop the\r\nmeat, add it to the water they were boiled in, salt to taste. Add enough\r\nvinegar to give a pleasing acid taste, pour into a dish to cool. When\r\nfirm, cut in slices. Or leave out the vinegar and serve catsup of any\r\nkind with the meat. Or before cooking the feet, wrap each one in cloth and\r\nboil seven hours. When cold take off the cloth and cut each foot in two\r\npieces. Serve cold with catsup or pepper sauce or horse-radish. Or the\r\nfeet may be put into a jar and covered with cold vinegar, to which is\r\nadded a handful of whole cloves.--[A. L. N.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDNEY ON TOAST.\r\n\r\nCut a kidney in large pieces and soak in cold water an hour. Drain and\r\nchop fine, removing all string and fiber; also chop separately one onion.\r\nPut a tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add the\r\nchopped kidney and stir till the mixture turns a whitish color, then add\r\nthe onion. Cook five minutes, turn into a small stewpan, season and add a\r\ncupful of boiling water. Simmer an hour and thicken with a teaspoonful of\r\ncornstarch wet with cold water. Cook five minutes longer, pour over slices\r\nof nicely browned toast and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork Fritters._\r\n\r\nCORN MEAL FRITTERS.\r\n\r\nMake a thick batter of corn meal and flour, cut a few slices of pork and\r\nfry until the fat is fried out; cut a few more slices, dip them in the\r\nbatter, and drop them in the bubbling fat, seasoning with salt and pepper;\r\ncook until light brown, and eat while hot.\r\n\r\nFRITTERS WITH EGG.\r\n\r\nFry slices of freshened fat pork, browning both sides, then make a batter\r\nof 1 egg, 1 cup milk, 1 teaspoon baking powder sifted through enough flour\r\nto make a rather stiff batter, and a pinch of salt. Now remove the pork\r\nfrom the frying pan and drop in large spoonfuls of the batter, and in the\r\ncenter of each place a piece of the fried pork, then cover the pork with\r\nbatter, and when nicely brown, turn and let the other side brown. Currant\r\njelly is nice with them.\r\n\r\nFRICATELLE.\r\n\r\nChop raw fresh pork very fine, add a little salt and plenty of pepper, 2\r\nsmall onions chopped fine, half as much bread as there is meat, soaked\r\nuntil soft, 2 eggs. Mix well together, make into oblong patties and fry\r\nlike oysters. These are nice for breakfast. If used for supper, serve with\r\nsliced lemon.\r\n\r\nCROQUETTES.\r\n\r\nRaw pork chopped fine, 2 cups, 1 small onion chopped very fine, 1 teaspoon\r\npowdered sage, 1 cup bread crumbs rubbed fine, salt and pepper to taste, 2\r\neggs beaten light. Mix thoroughly, make small flat cakes, roll lightly in\r\nflour and fry in hot lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork Pies, Cakes and Puddings._\r\n\r\nPORK PIE.\r\n\r\nCut fresh pork in small inch and half-inch pieces, allowing both fat and\r\nlean. Boil until done in slightly salted water. Lay away in an earthen\r\ndish over night. In the morning it will be found to be surrounded with a\r\nfirm meat jelly. Will not soak pie crust. Make a rich baking powder\r\nbiscuit paste. Roll out thin, make top and bottom crust, fill with the\r\nprepared pork. Bake.--[H. M. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HINT FOR PORK PIE.\r\n\r\nEvery housekeeper knows how to make pork pie, but not every one knows that\r\nif the bottom crust is first baked with a handful of rice to prevent\r\nbubbling--the rice may be used many times for the same purpose--and the\r\npork partially cooked before the upper crust is added, the pie will be\r\ntwice as palatable as if baked in the old way. The crust will not be soggy\r\nand the meat juices will not lose flavor by evaporation.--[Mrs. O. P.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK PIE WITH APPLES.\r\n\r\nLine a deep pudding dish with pie crust. Place a layer of tart apples in\r\nthe dish, sprinkle with sugar and a little nutmeg, then place a layer of\r\nthin slices of fat salt pork (not cooked), sprinkle lightly with black\r\npepper. Continue to add apples and pork until the dish is full. Cover with\r\na crust and bake until the apples are cooked, when the pork should be\r\nmelted. Serve as any pie.--[M. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPARERIB PIE.\r\n\r\nChop the small mussy pieces of meat, put in a pudding or bread tin, add\r\nsome of the gravy and a little water. Make a biscuit crust, roll half an\r\ninch thick and put over the top and bake. A tasty way is to cut the crust\r\ninto biscuits, place close together on top of the meat and bake. More\r\ndainty to serve than the single crust. A cream gravy or some left from the\r\nrib is nice with this pie. Any of the lean meat makes a nice pie, made the\r\nsame as the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CAKE WITHOUT LARD.\r\n\r\nOver 1 lb. fat salt pork, chopped very fine, pour a pint of boiling water.\r\nWhile it is cooling, sift 9 cups flour with 1 heaping teaspoon soda and 2\r\nof cream tartar, stir in 2 cups sugar and 1 of molasses, 4 eggs, teaspoon\r\nof all kinds spice, 2 lbs. raisins, 1 lb. currants and 1/2 lb. citron.\r\nLastly, thoroughly beat in the pork and water and bake slowly. This will\r\nkeep a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CAKE.\r\n\r\nTake 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup strong coffee, 1/2 cup molasses, 1/2 cup\r\nchopped salt pork, 1/4 cup lard, 1 cup raisins, stoned and chopped, 2 cups\r\nflour, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon soda, dissolved in coffee, 1 teaspoon cloves,\r\ncinnamon and nutmeg.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK PUDDING.\r\n\r\nThis is made somewhat after the style of the famous English beefsteak\r\npudding--differs only in two points. Cut up the pieces of fresh pork and\r\nstew in the skillet, in slightly salted water, till soft. Make a rich\r\nbiscuit dough or plain pie paste. Line a quart basin and fill with the\r\nstewed pork. Add pepper, a few chopped potatoes if desired, cover all with\r\nthe paste pinched tightly over, tie a small cloth tightly over the basin,\r\nthen place basin in a larger cloth, gather the corners together and tie\r\nsnugly over top, boil in a kettle for half an hour. Be sure the water is\r\nboiling hot before placing the basin in, and keep it boiling, with a tight\r\nlid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roasts._\r\n\r\nFRESH LEG.\r\n\r\nScore the leg with sharp knife in half-inch gashes, fill with a filling\r\nmade of chopped onion, sage, bread crumbs and mixed with the beaten yolks\r\nand whites of 2 eggs, salt; stuff knuckle and gashes also. Pepper freely\r\nand roast it well. A leg weighing 8 lbs. requires three hours of a steady\r\nfire. Drain off fat from roasting tin and make a brown gravy. Serve with\r\ntart apple sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH BUTTERMILK.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of pork that is quite lean, soak over night in buttermilk and\r\nboil until about half done, then put it in the baking pan, cut through the\r\nrind in slices, sprinkle with pepper and sugar and bake to a golden brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANISH PORK ROAST.\r\n\r\nBraise the roast, and between each slit insert a bit of sage--which may be\r\nremoved before serving; place in a deep stewpan and fill the corners and\r\ncrevices with prunes that have been previously soaked in water long enough\r\nto regain their natural size. Roast in moderate oven, basting as usual,\r\ntaking care not to break the prunes. When half done, take up the prunes,\r\nremove pits, crush and add to a dressing made as follows: Moisten 2 cups\r\nbread crumbs--one-third corn bread is preferable to all wheat--season with\r\nsalt, pepper and a mere hint of onions. Put into a cheesecloth\r\nbag--saltbag if at hand--and bake beside the roast for half an hour,\r\ntaking care to prevent scorching. Serve in slices with the roast.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPARERIB.\r\n\r\nSeason well with salt, pepper and a little sage. Put in roasting pan with\r\na little water, bake a nice brown. By cracking the ribs twice, you can\r\nroll up and fasten with skewers, or tie up with coarse twine. Put the\r\nstuffing inside, same as turkey. After it is done, take meat from pan. If\r\nthe water is not all cooked out, set on top of stove until none remains.\r\nPour out the grease, leaving about half a cup. Set back to cool so as not\r\nto cook the gravy too fast at first. Stir 2 spoons or more of flour into\r\nthe grease and let brown. Add boiling water to make the required amount of\r\ngravy. Before removing from fire, add 1/2 cup sweet cream. Baked or\r\nmashed potatoes with cold slaw are in order with sparerib, with currant,\r\ncranberry or apple sauce. Very nice cold with fried potatoes or chips for\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liver._\r\n\r\nWITH BACON.\r\n\r\nPour salted boiling water over the liver and let it stand a few minutes,\r\ndrain and slice. Crisp thin slices of bacon in a hot frying pan, lay them\r\nneatly around the edge of a platter or deep dish, and set the dish where\r\nit will keep hot. Fry the liver in the drippings from the bacon and put it\r\nin the middle of the dish. Pour a little boiling water into the frying\r\npan, season to taste with pepper and salt, thicken with browned flour and\r\npour over the liver or serve separately.--[R. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVER AND ONIONS.\r\n\r\nUse two frying pans. In both have a generous supply of fryings or salted\r\nlard. Cut the liver in thin, even slices, and wash in cold water. Wipe\r\neach slice dry before placing it in the hot grease; fill the frying pan\r\nfull, pepper and salt all, cover with lid and set over a brisk fire. Slice\r\nthe onions and place them in the second frying pan of hot grease, pepper,\r\nsalt and stir frequently. Turn the liver once, each slice. When done,\r\nplace on a platter, with the onions heaped over and around.--[H. M. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASHED.\r\n\r\nParboil the liver, chop it fine and put it into a hot frying pan with just\r\nenough of the liquor it was boiled in to moisten it so it won't be hard\r\nand dry. When hot, season with salt, pepper and butter, and serve with\r\nmashed potato. Or you can chop cold boiled potatoes with the liver and\r\nmake a regular hash of it if preferred.--[R. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heart._\r\n\r\nSTUFFED.\r\n\r\nTake three hearts, remove the ventricles and dividing wall, wash and wipe\r\nout dry. Fill with 3 tablespoons chopped ham, 4 tablespoons bread crumbs,\r\na little melted butter, some pepper and salt; beat up an egg and mix the\r\nmeat, etc., with as much of the egg as is needed to bind it together. Tie\r\neach heart in a piece of cloth and boil three hours, or till tender, in\r\nsalt and water. Remove the cloths carefully, so as to keep the dressing in\r\nplace, rub them over with butter and sprinkle with a little flour, and\r\nbrown in a brisk oven. Reduce the liquor and thicken it. Serve with mashed\r\npotatoes and apple jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED.\r\n\r\nMake a biscuit dough rather stiff, sprinkle a well-cleaned heart over with\r\na little pepper and salt, roll the heart securely in the biscuit dough,\r\nwrap all in a clean white cloth and sew or baste together loosely, then\r\nput in a kettle of hot water and boil about four hours. Serve hot by\r\nremoving cloth and slicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sausage._\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE WITH DRIED BEEF.\r\n\r\nTo 10 lbs. meat allow 5 tablespoons salt, 4 of black pepper, 3 of sage,\r\nand 1/2 tablespoon cayenne. Some persons prefer to add a little ginger,\r\nthinking that it keeps the sausage from rising on the stomach. Mix the\r\nspices thoroughly through the meat, which may be put into skins or muslin\r\nbags and hung in a cold, dry place, or partly cooked and packed in jars\r\nwith a covering of lard. Every housekeeper uses fried and baked sausages,\r\nbut sausage and dried beef is a more uncommon dish. Cut the sausage into\r\nsmall pieces, put it into a stewpan with water to cover, and put on to\r\ncook. Slice the dried beef and tear it into small pieces, removing fat and\r\ngristle, and put into the stew pan. When done, thicken slightly with\r\nflour, season and stir an egg quickly into it. Don't get the gravy too\r\nthick and don't beat the egg--it wants to show in little flakes of white\r\nand yellow.--[Rosalie Williams.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE ROLLS.\r\n\r\nMake a rich pie paste, roll out thin and cut, with a large cooky cutter or\r\na canister lid, large discs of the paste. Take a small cooked sausage, and\r\nplacing it on the edge of the circle of paste, roll it up and pinch the\r\nends together. Bake in a quick oven and serve hot or cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH CABBAGE.\r\n\r\nPut some pieces of fat and lean pork through the sausage mill; add a\r\nfinely chopped onion, pepper, salt and a dash of mace. Cut a large, sound\r\nhead of cabbage in two, scoop out the heart of both halves and fill with\r\nsausage meat; tie up the head securely with stout twine, put into salted\r\nwater sufficient to cover the cabbage, and boil one hour and a half. Drain\r\nthoroughly and save the liquid, which should not exceed one cupful in all.\r\nBrown a tablespoonful of butter over a hot fire, stir in a teaspoon of\r\nbrowned flour and add the liquid; pour over cabbage and serve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD SAUSAGE.\r\n\r\nThis sausage recipe has been proved good. Take 30 lbs. pork and 12 oz.\r\nsalt, 2 oz. pepper, 2 oz. sage. Put sage in a pan and dry in oven, then\r\nsift. You can add two ounces of ground mustard if you wish. Add 2 or 3\r\nlbs. sugar, mix all together, salt, pepper, etc., and mix with meat before\r\nit is chopped. After it is well mixed, cut to your liking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fresh Pork._\r\n\r\nCUTLETS.\r\n\r\nCut them from a loin of pork, bone and trim neatly and cut away most of\r\nthe fat. Broil fifteen minutes on a hot gridiron, turning them three or\r\nfour times, until they are thoroughly done but not dry. Dish, season with\r\npepper and salt and serve with tomato sauce or with small pickled\r\ncucumbers as a garnish.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREADED CUTLETS.\r\n\r\nA more elaborate dish is made by dipping the cutlets into beaten egg\r\nseasoned to taste with salt, pepper and sage, then into rolled cracker or\r\nbread crumbs. Fry slowly till thoroughly done, and serve with mashed\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTLETS FROM COLD ROAST PORK.\r\n\r\nMelt an ounce of butter in a saucepan, lay in the cutlets and an onion\r\nchopped fine, and fry a light brown; then add a dessertspoon of flour,\r\nhalf a pint of gravy, pepper and salt to taste, and a teaspoon each of\r\nvinegar and made mustard. Simmer gently a few minutes and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CHOPS.\r\n\r\nThe white meat along the backbone (between the ribs and ham) is not always\r\nsufficiently appreciated, and is often peeled from the fat, cut from the\r\nbones and put into sausage, which should never be done, as it is the\r\nchoicest piece in the hog to fry. Leave fat and lean together, saw through\r\nthe bone, fry or broil. The meat gravy should be served in a gravy boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREADED PORK CHOPS.\r\n\r\nCut chops about an inch thick, beat them flat with a rolling pin, put them\r\nin a pan, pour boiling water over them, and set them over the fire for\r\nfive minutes; then take them up and wipe them dry. Mix a tablespoon of\r\nsalt and a teaspoon of pepper for each pound of meat; rub each chop over\r\nwith this, then dip, first into beaten egg, then into crackers, rolled, as\r\nmuch as they will take up. Fry in hot lard.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBECUED PORK.\r\n\r\nPut a loin of pork in a hot oven without water, sprinkle with flour,\r\npepper and salt, baste with butter, cook two or three hours, or until very\r\nbrown. Pour in the gravy half a teacup of walnut catsup. Serve with fried\r\napples.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roast Pig._\r\n\r\nSUCKING PIG.\r\n\r\nScald carefully and scrape clean, wipe dry, chop off the toes above first\r\njoint, remove entrails, and although some cook head entire, it is not\r\nadvisable. Remove brains, eyes, upper and lower jaws, leaving skin\r\nsemblance of head, with ears thoroughly scraped and cleaned. Make a\r\ndressing composed of one large boiled onion chopped, powdered sage, salt,\r\npepper, 4 cups stale bread crumbs, a bit of butter, and all mixed with\r\nwell-beaten eggs. Stuff the body part with this. Stitch it up. Previously\r\nboil the heart in salted water and stuff this into the boneless head skin\r\nto preserve its shape and semblance. Place it down on its feet, head\r\nresting on front feet, hind legs drawn out, just as you want it to lie on\r\nthe platter when served or sent to table. Roast three hours, constantly\r\nbasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROAST WHOLE.\r\n\r\nA pig ought not to be under four nor over six weeks old, and ought to be\r\nplump and fat. In the city, the butcher will sell you a shoat already\r\nprepared, but in the country, we must prepare our own pig for roasting. As\r\nsoon as the pig is killed, throw it into a tub of cold water to make it\r\ntender; as soon as it is perfectly, cold, take it by the hind leg and\r\nplunge into scalding water, and shake it about until the hair can all be\r\nremoved, by the handful at a time. When the hair has all been removed, rub\r\nfrom the tail up to the end of the nose with a coarse cloth. Take off the\r\nhoofs and wash out the inside of the ears and nose until perfectly clean.\r\nHang the pig up, by the hind legs, stretched open so as to take out the\r\nentrails; wash well with water with some bicarbonate of soda dissolved in\r\nit; rinse again and again and let it hang an hour or more to drip. Wrap it\r\nin a coarse, dry cloth, when taken down, and lay in a cold cellar, or on\r\nice, as it is better not to cook the pig the same day it is killed. Say\r\nkill and clean it late in the evening and roast it the next morning.\r\nPrepare the stuffing of the liver, heart and haslets, stewed, seasoned and\r\nchopped fine. Mix with these an equal quantity of boiled Irish potatoes,\r\nmashed, or bread crumbs, and season with hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine,\r\nparsley and sage, or thyme, chopped fine, pepper and salt. Scald the pig\r\non the inside, dry it and rub with pepper and salt, fill with the stuffing\r\nand sew up. Bend the forelegs under the body, the hind legs forward, and\r\nskewer to keep in position. Place in a large baking pan and pour over it\r\none quart of boiling water. Rub fresh butter all over the pig and sprinkle\r\npepper and salt over it, and put a bunch of parsley and thyme, or sage, in\r\nthe water. Turn a pan down over it and let it simmer in a hot oven till\r\nperfectly tender. Then take off the pan that covers the pig, rub it with\r\nmore butter and let brown, basting it frequently with the hot gravy. If\r\nthe hot water and gravy cook down too much, add more hot water and baste.\r\nWhen of a fine brown, and tender and done all through, cover the edges of\r\na large, flat china dish with fresh green parsley and place the pig,\r\nkneeling, in the center of the dish. Place in its mouth a red apple, or an\r\near of green corn, and serve hot with the gravy; or serve cold with grated\r\nhorse-radish and pickle. Roast pig ought to be evenly cooked, through and\r\nthrough, as underdone pork of any kind, size or age is exceedingly\r\nunwholesome. It ought also to be evenly and nicely browned on the outside,\r\nas the tender skin when cooked is crisp and palatable. It is easily\r\nscorched, therefore keep a pig, while roasting, covered till tender and\r\nalmost done.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tongue._\r\n\r\nThe tongues should be put into the pickle with the hams; boil after three\r\nor four weeks, pickle in vinegar which has been sweetened. Add a\r\ntablespoon ground mustard to a pint of vinegar. Will keep months. They\r\nshould be pickled whole. Also nice when first cooked without pickling.\r\nSlice cold, to be eaten with or without mayonnaise dressing. Sliced thin,\r\nand placed between thin slices of bread, make delicious sandwiches.\r\nChopped fine, with hard-boiled eggs and mayonnaise, make nice sandwiches.\r\nMany boil pork and beef tongues fresh. An old brown tongue is an\r\nabomination. The saltpeter gives the pink look canned tongues have; the\r\nsalt and sugar flavor nicely.\r\n\r\nWhen fresh, tongues are nice for mince pies. They may be corned with the\r\nhams and boiled and skinned and hot vinegar seasoned with salt and pepper\r\npoured over them; or are nice sliced with cold potatoes, garnished with\r\ncress or lettuce and a cream salad dressing poured over them. Cream salad\r\ndressing: Stir thoroughly together 1 teaspoon sugar, six tablespoons thick\r\nsweet cream and 2 tablespoons vinegar, salt and pepper or mustard to\r\ntaste. The cream and vinegar should be very cold, and the vinegar added to\r\nthe cream a little at a time, or it will curdle. Stir till smooth and\r\ncreamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Souse._\r\n\r\nTake off the horny parts of feet by dipping in hot water and pressing\r\nagainst them with a knife. Singe off hair, let soak in cold water for 24\r\nhours, then pour on boiling water, scrape thoroughly, let stand in salt\r\nand water a few hours; before boiling wrap each foot in a clean white\r\nbandage, cord securely to keep skin from bursting, which causes the\r\ngelatine to escape in the water. Boil four hours. Leave in bandage until\r\ncold. If you wish to pickle them, put in a jar, add some of the boiling\r\nliquor, add enough vinegar to make a pleasant sour, add a few whole\r\npeppers. Very nice cold. If you want it hot, put some of the pickle and\r\nfeet in frying pan. When boiling, thicken with flour and serve hot.--[Nina\r\nGorton.\r\n\r\nSee that the feet are perfectly clean, the toes chopped off and every\r\nparticle cleanly scraped, washed and wiped. Boil for three hours\r\ncontinually, or until every particle falls apart, drain from liquid, pick\r\nout all the bones, chop slightly, return to the liquid, add 1/2 cup\r\nvinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, pepper, salt and a dash of nutmeg. (Do not\r\nhave too much liquid.) Boil up once more and turn all out into a mold,\r\npress lightly, and cut cold.--[H. M. Gee.\r\n\r\nThoroughly clean the pig's feet and knock off the horny part with a\r\nhatchet. Pour boiling water over them twice and pour it off, then put them\r\non to cook in plenty of water. Do not salt the water. Boil until very\r\ntender, then take out the feet, pack in a jar, sprinkle each layer with\r\nsalt, whole pepper and whole cloves, and cover with equal portions of\r\nvinegar and the broth in which the feet were boiled. Put a plate over the\r\ntop with a weight to keep the souse under the vinegar. If there remains\r\nany portion of the broth, strain it and let stand until cold, remove the\r\nfat and clarify the broth with a beaten white of egg. It will be then\r\nready for blancmange or lemon jelly and is very delicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scrapple._\r\n\r\nTake hog's tongue, heart, liver, all bones and refuse trimmings (some use\r\nears, snout and lights, I do not), soak all bloody pieces and wash them\r\ncarefully, use also all clean skins, trimmed from lard. Put into a kettle\r\nand cover with water, boil until tender and bones drop loose, then cut in\r\nsausage cutter while hot, strain liquor in which it was boiled, and\r\nthicken with good corn mush meal, boil it well, stirring carefully to\r\nprevent scorching. This mush must be well cooked and quite stiff, so that\r\na stick will stand in it. When no raw taste is left, stir in the chopped\r\nmeat and season to taste with salt, pepper and herb, sage or sweet\r\nmarjoram, or anything preferred. When the meat is thoroughly mixed all\r\nthrough the mush, and seasoning is satisfactory, dip out into pans of\r\nconvenient size, to cool. Better lift off fire and stir carefully lest it\r\nscorch. When cold, serve in slices like cheese, or fry like mush (crisp\r\nboth sides) for breakfast, serving it with nice tomato catsup. It tastes\r\nvery much like fried oysters. Some prefer half buckwheat meal and half\r\ncorn. To keep it, do not let it freeze, and if not covered with grease\r\nmelt some lard and pour over, or it will mold. This ought to be sweet and\r\ngood for a month or more in winter, but will crumble and fry soft if it\r\nfreezes.--[Mrs. R. E. Griffith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Head Cheese._\r\n\r\nHave the head split down the face, remove the skin, ears, eyes and brains,\r\nand cut off the snout; wash thoroughly and soak all day in cold salted\r\nwater; change the water and soak over night, then put on to cook in cold\r\nwater to cover. Skim carefully and when done so the bones will slip out,\r\nremove to a hot pan, take out every bone and bit of gristle, and chop the\r\nmeat with a sharp knife as quickly as possible, to keep the fat from\r\nsettling in it. For 6 lbs. meat allow 2 tablespoons salt, 1 teaspoon black\r\npepper, a little cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon clove and 2 tablespoons sage. Stir\r\nthe meat and seasoning well together and put into a perforated mold or tie\r\nin a coarse cloth, put a heavy weight on it and let it stand till cold and\r\nfirm. The broth in which the meat was cooked may be used for pea soup, and\r\nthe fat, if clarified, may be used for lard.--[R. W.\r\n\r\nCut the head up in suitable pieces to fit the receptacle you wish to boil\r\nit in, first cutting off all pieces that are not to be used. If too fat,\r\ncut off that, too, and put with the lard to be rendered. Take out the\r\nbrains and lay them in a dish of cold water, then put the head on to boil\r\ntill tender. Be sure to skim well. When it begins to boil, cook till the\r\nmeat is ready to drop off the bones, then take up, remove all bones or\r\ngristle and grind or chop, not too fine; put in salt, pepper and cloves to\r\ntaste, also sage if liked, mix all well together, heat it all together,\r\nand pour in a cloth, which is laid in a crock, tie it up tight and put on\r\na weight, to press it. Next day remove the cloth and the head cheese is\r\nready for the table. Skim the fat off the liquor the head was boiled in\r\nand set aside for future use. Heat the liquor to a boil and stir in nicely\r\nsifted corn meal. After salting, take up in crock and let it get cold,\r\nthen cut off in slices and fry a nice brown. Nice for breakfast.--[Mrs. A.\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pig's Head._\r\n\r\nEnglish Brawn: Cut off the hearty cheek or jowl, and try it out for\r\nshortening. Saw the pig's head up in small pieces, carefully removing the\r\nbrains, snoot, eyes, jawbones or portions of teeth sockets. (It is\r\nsurprising with saw and a keen, sharp-pointed knife how much of the\r\nunpleasant pieces of a pig's head can be removed before it is consigned to\r\nthe salt bath.) Soak all night in salt and water, drain in the morning and\r\nset over the fire to boil in slightly salted water. Place the tongue in\r\nwhole also. When the flesh leaves the bone, take out and strip all into a\r\nwooden chopping bowl, reserving the tongue whole. Skin the tongue while\r\nwarm. Chop the head pieces fine, add pepper, salt, powdered sage to suit\r\ntaste. Pack all in a deep, narrow mold and press the tongue whole into the\r\nmiddle of the mass. Weight down and set away all night to cool. Keep this\r\nalways in a cold place until all is used, and, as usual, use a sharp knife\r\nto slice.--[Aunt Ban.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Keep Hams and Shoulders._\r\n\r\nWe pack them for a few days with a sprinkle of dry salt, then lift and\r\nwipe dry (both barrel and meat), repack and cover with brine, which may be\r\nprepared thus: To 16 gals. brine (enough to carry an egg) placed in a\r\nkettle to boil add 1/4 lb. saltpeter, 3 pts. syrup molasses and a large\r\nshovel of hickory ashes tied in a clean saltbag or cloth; boil, skim and\r\ncool.--[Mrs. R. E. Griffith.\r\n\r\nTo prepare smoked ham for summer use: Slice the ham and cut off the rind.\r\nFill a spider nearly full, putting the fat pieces on top. Place in the\r\noven and bake. When partly cooked, pack the slices of hot ham closely in a\r\nstone jar and pour the meat juice and fat over the top. Every time that\r\nany of the meat is taken out, a little of the lard should be heated and\r\npoured back into the jar to keep the meat fresh and good. Be very careful\r\neach time to completely cover the meat with lard.--[Marion Chandler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Albuminoids, 5\r\n\r\n  Animal heat, 18\r\n\r\n  Average weights of hogs,
