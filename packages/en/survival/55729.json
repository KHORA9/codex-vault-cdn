BANANAS: WHAT\r\n    THEY ARE, HOW THEY GROW, WHAT THEY COST, AND WHAT THEY GIVE TO\r\n    MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the dawn of history in the Old World, mayhap long before\r\nthat Old World arose from the waters, man lived on the fruit of the\r\n_Musas_. There are those who would tell you that the banana is the\r\nfruit which tempted Eve, to the downfall of Adam; and that evidence\r\nof the truth of this may be found in the fact that if one will cut\r\nacross a banana, of the right kind, he may find in its heart the sign\r\nof the cross; and in the other fact that men of learning have given to\r\na banana the name of _Musa paradisiaca_, which being interpreted means\r\nthe Fruit of paradise, and to another banana they have given the name\r\n_Musa sapientum_, which the sapient know means the Fruit of knowledge.\r\nLess evidence has served well enough to burn heretics at the stake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BUNCH OF BANANAS]\r\n\r\nMan has carried this gigantic herb to every fertile spot in a belt that\r\ngirdles the waist of the globe--a girdle that is four thousand miles\r\nand more in width. Millions uncounted have looked to it for the chief\r\nof their diet, as other millions have looked to the cereals. And to\r\nthis hour puling babes and doddering ancients are fed with the fruit in\r\nall its stages and conditions, green or over-ripe, raw or roasted,\r\nbaked or fried, liquid or dried. At least forty species of the _Musas_\r\nare known and described, and of these there are several sub-varieties.\r\nThey have been classed by Dr. Sagot into three groups, as follows:\r\n\r\n Giant bananas, of which _M. ensete_ is the type. In this group no\r\n suckers are formed. Fruit leathery and not edible, with few seeds.\r\n\r\n Fleshy-fruited bananas; _M. sapientum_ the type. Stem produces\r\n suckers; spike long and decurved; fruit fleshy and usually eatable.\r\n\r\n Ornamental bananas. Spike often erect, not pendant; bracts persistent,\r\n brightly colored, each with a few flowers on its axil; suckers many;\r\n fruit leathery. _M. rosacea_ furnish familiar examples of this group.\r\n\r\nWhen in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the single\r\nman of the tropics to take unto himself a helpmeet for him, and to\r\nprovide for other events likely to come after, he selects some fertile\r\nspot, usually on the border of waters over which his canoe may easily\r\ncarry the bulky harvests he will have; and there he cuts down tree and\r\nvine, bush and bamboo, and lets them lie as they fall in tangled mass.\r\nEvery day the ardent sun helps the constant wind to shrivel leaf and\r\ntwig until, one day, the windward edge of that snarl is touched by the\r\ntorch, and in a moment a blazing hades is where a cool and shady grove\r\nwill soon rustle in the breeze.\r\n\r\nWhen the last flame has flickered out and coals lie dead beneath their\r\ngray shroud, women paddle to that place with canoes laden with banana\r\nsprouts. With machetes they dig little pits amid charred stumps and\r\ntrunks and branches, and in each hole they set a sprout. Then they\r\ngo away to wait, and rest; and the sun shines warmly down into that\r\nclearing, breezes sift a gray veil of ashes over the wilted suckers\r\nthat look like black and ragged stakes; and at last come showers which\r\nwash them clean.\r\n\r\nThose stakes are made up of sheathes of leaves tightly rolled one\r\naround another, the inner ones narrow, cream-colored and tender; those\r\nnearer the outer ones wider and yet wider, until the outer one is\r\nreached. The outer one covers nearly or quite three-fourths of the\r\nstem. When the warm rains fall, the tender leaves unroll and spread to\r\ntheir widest, and the sun dries and the wind whips them until soon they\r\nare split into narrow ribbons; and a few weeks after that planting a\r\nsea of giant leaves waves and whispers in the breeze--a roof of bright\r\nand tender green covering the moist, black ground.\r\n\r\nNot before the plant has grown to a height of ten to twenty, and in\r\nsome places to thirty feet, does the flower-stem begin pushing its\r\nway up from the base through the middle of the stalk. In a short time\r\nit sends out at the top one or more leaves, smaller than their older\r\nfellows, as a signal that flower and fruit will quickly follow. Soon\r\nevery supporting column of those graceful arches ends in a cone of\r\nred that deepens into purple and swells until its outer petals are\r\ncrowded off by the fatness of the fruit they hide, that these may have\r\nair and light. Under those petals the baby bananas are packed close,\r\nlike fingers tightly gripping the parent stem. These closed ranks,\r\neach separate hand or whorl reaching half way around the stalk, grow\r\nso quickly that in six or eight weeks the bunch weighs fifty pounds or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nTo most people of northern climes bananas are merely--bananas. For\r\nsuch folk know as little of the many varieties of bananas as they know\r\nof the many and varied uses of that fruit. Perchance that is why they\r\nfry the common yellow guineo which comes by millions of bunches each\r\nyear to the United States, and then wonder that folk who have dwelt\r\nin the tropics, and who extol fried bananas, show nevertheless that\r\nthey cannot like the mushy, cloying mess set before them here. He\r\nwho grows bananas, and she who cooks them for him, select for frying\r\nthat thick-bodied, hard-fleshed and rather tart fruit which they call\r\nplátano, and which is by blundering English-speaking tongues misnamed\r\nplantain. And even among the plátanos there is room for choosing, for\r\nthere are of them several varieties. Best of these is that little\r\none which bears, on the Mosquito Shore whence good bananas come, the\r\nSpanish name “miel,” or honey, coupled with the Waika word “silpe,” or\r\nlittle. The name “maiden” plátano also is given to the “little honey,”\r\nmost fittingly, for it has just enough of piquant tartness to give\r\nunfailing relish, yet is tender, plump and mighty comforting withal,\r\nupon occasion.\r\n\r\nIf he is so lucky as to live near a port where steamships stop, the\r\nplanter may sell his plátanos for a cent or even two cents for each\r\nfinger or fruit; and as the plants may be set only eight or ten feet\r\napart, and each will mature a bunch of thirty to fifty fingers every\r\nnine months, it is clear that he who has an acre of plátanos may have\r\na tidy income of food or of cash. Usually the planter prefers to eat\r\nthis food, for which reason people in the North have few opportunities\r\nfor learning the superior virtues of the fruit. The planter is quite\r\nright, for the plátano is the one banana fit to be cooked; and is by no\r\nmeans bad to eat raw.\r\n\r\nSometimes a planter may leave a bunch of bananas to ripen on the\r\nstanding stalk, but that will rarely be, for the fruit so ripened is\r\nstrong in flavor, dry and too soft to bear transportation; its skin\r\nsplits, and ants, bees and other insects gather about the exposed\r\nflesh. Therefore the women lug home green bunches and hang them in the\r\nhouse to ripen, where everybody who has the right--and that is every\r\nvisitor, every member of the family and every passing acquaintance--may\r\npluck and eat as the fruit turns yellow and becomes tender. Meanwhile\r\nmany of the fruits will have been taken from the bunch, peeled and\r\nbroken into bits, to be boiled with beef or pork, or flesh of the deer,\r\npeccary or other game.\r\n\r\nAnother sub-variety of plátanos bears, in Mosquitia, the name of\r\n“butuco,” perhaps from the name of the River Patuca--or maybe the river\r\nhas taken its name from the banana. The butuco is perhaps rather more\r\ntart than the miel silpe, and when fried reminds one of fried greening\r\napples, and when stewed has somewhat of the flavor of stewed peaches.\r\nIn either way it is most agreeable to the taste. There are other\r\nplátanos, also, most of them giants among bananas, many being fifteen\r\nor more inches long and some two or three inches in diameter. These are\r\nfirm in flesh, resist decay much longer than do the common guineos, and\r\nwill, therefore, much better bear transportation. They should become\r\nknown to the millions of northern lands, for they would afford a vast\r\nsupply of food much more convenient and palatable than, and equal in\r\nvalue to, potatoes.\r\n\r\nProf. Wynter Blythe, of London, is an analyst who tells us that the\r\nrelative values of bananas and sago, corn meal and wheat flour are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  =========================+=========+===========+=========+============\r\n        Constituents       |  Banana |   Sago    |Corn Meal|Wheat Flour\r\n  -------------------------+---------+-----------+---------+------------\r\n                           |Per Cent.| Per Cent. |Per Cent.| Per Cent.\r\n  Water                    |  8.05   |   13.00   |  11.09  |   15.08\r\n  Soluble albumen dextrine |  4.45   |           |         |\r\n  Starch                   | 82.57   |   78.06   |  85.30  |   81.60\r\n  Albumenoids              |  2.28   |    2.57   |   2.37  |    2.11\r\n  Fat                      |  0.77   |           |         |\r\n  Ash                      |  1.88   |    0.53   |   0.43  |    0.35\r\n  =========================+=========+===========+=========+============\r\n\r\nIn a report on the constituents and food values of most articles\r\nin common use on northern tables, the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture gave, in the year 1903, very valuable figures which show\r\nthat nineteen vegetables and ten varieties of fruits which make up the\r\nchief of our diet, have the following parts and values:\r\n\r\n  ======================+==========+========+=========\r\n         Elements       |Vegetables| Fruits | Bananas\r\n  ----------------------+----------+--------+---------\r\n  Carbohydrates, parts  |    8.9   |  11.1  |   14.3\r\n  Fats                  |    0.4   |   0.4  |    0.4\r\n  Protein               |    2.0   |   0.6  |    0.8\r\n  Ash                   |    0.9   |   0.5  |    0.6\r\n  Water                 |   73.0   |  64.3  |   48.9\r\n  Refuse                |   14.8   |  23.1  |   35.0\r\n  Fuel values           |  203.9   | 204.0  |  260.0\r\n  ======================+==========+========+=========\r\n\r\nThis shows that while of valuable nutritive elements, the nineteen\r\nfresh vegetables have 11.3 parts and the ten varieties of succulent\r\nfruits have 12.1 parts, the bananas have 15.5 parts. From this it\r\nappears, also, that if the fresh fruits and vegetables were actually\r\nworth, as food, say $1.17, bananas of like weight would be worth 38\r\ncents more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARD LABOR AMONG THE BANANAS]\r\n\r\nStatements made by other analysts seem to warrant the deduction that\r\nthe nutritive value of a ton of potatoes, at one cent per pound, is 19\r\ncents more than that of a ton of bananas at the same price. There is a\r\ndifference, too, in the cost of production of a ton of potatoes and the\r\ncost of raising a ton of bananas. The field for potatoes must be plowed\r\nand harrowed in the spring, the seed dropped in furrows, which are then\r\nto be covered, after which comes cultivating again and again until the\r\ntime has come for digging and picking, carting, sacking and hauling,\r\noften to a distant market.\r\n\r\nLuckily for the millions who have depended so largely on the banana for\r\nsustenance, the plant has few, if any, insect enemies and diseases, in\r\nwhich they differ somewhat from some fruits and tubers of the North.\r\n\r\nMany times an assertion has been printed to the effect that Humboldt\r\nsaid that an acre of bananas yields forty-four times as much food as\r\ndoes an acre of wheat. In the year 1902 the average yield of wheat in\r\nthe United States equalled 12.79 bushels, or 767.4 pounds. This had\r\na food value equal to nearly one-third that of the average output of\r\nbananas from an acre. It is often said that one pound of bananas has\r\nas much nutrition as has a pound of beef. The truth is that one pound\r\nof beef is worth three and one-third pounds of bananas. Bananas are\r\nfar enough ahead of the harvests the farmer of the North gets, without\r\nmaking exaggerated claims for the fruit of the tropics.\r\n\r\nSo the planter of bananas has each year four and a half times as much\r\npalatable food from an acre as the farmer gets from his potatoes:\r\nand there is the further difference that the one has bananas at no\r\nother cost than that of keeping down bush and grass and vine, that\r\nwould quickly cover every spot to which the sunshine could penetrate,\r\nalong the edges of the plantation. For bananas yield year after year\r\nwithout replanting. Each new stalk springs from the foot of its parent,\r\ngrows to a height of fifteen to thirty-five feet, bears its burden of\r\nluscious fruit, and dies; but not before it has sent up from its own\r\nroot new stalks to fruit and die--and so on through the centuries.\r\n\r\nHe who would grow bananas for market must plant on the border of\r\nnavigable waters giving access to some harbor or anchorage where ships\r\nmay safely lie while receiving the fruit. For it is easily bruised, and\r\nwetting by salt water blackens the skins, thus injuring or preventing\r\nthe sale. Plantations are usually on the banks of rivers or of\r\nestuaries, but some are beside railroads, to which the fruit is carried\r\nby carts thickly carpeted with banana leaves. A cruder way is to hang a\r\nfew bunches over the back of a burro or of a mule, which plods along to\r\nthe shipping place.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the entire area which can so be devoted to banana\r\nculture must be small, for most Central American and Mexican rivers\r\nare obstructed at their mouths by sandbars, over which ships cannot\r\npass. Bluefields, Nicaragua, has been a most profitable field for\r\nbanana growing, because it has a river into which sea-going ships can\r\nsafely enter, and up which such ships may go fifty or sixty miles, and\r\nreceive their cargoes from landings on the plantations which border the\r\nRio Escondido. Yet millions of bunches of bananas have been shipped\r\nfrom the open coast of Honduras, where the one good harbor is that at\r\nPuerto Cortez.\r\n\r\nOther millions have been shipped from Port Limón and from Bocas del\r\nToro, in Costa Rica, whence a few hundred bunches were sent as a\r\nbeginning to the United States in the year 1883. Twenty years later\r\nthe port of Limón itself sent 4,174,200 bunches to the markets of the\r\nworld. They brought to Costa Rica credit for producing the best bananas\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nFor ages the native of banana lands was content with the fact that he\r\ngot from his plantation more than enough food. Some thirty-five years\r\nago a few bold men ventured to pay twelve or fifteen cents a bunch\r\nfor a few cargoes in the Bay Islands, off the coast of Honduras, and\r\ncarried them to the Gulf States. There they found they could sell the\r\nfruit, for there lived people who had traveled to the tropics, and\r\nlearned to eat their foods. To-day millions of bunches are each year\r\nsold in the United States and even in Canada, and in 1902 ship-loads\r\nwere sent from Costa Rica direct to Europe. That little republic alone\r\nreceived not less than $1,127,400 for bananas sold abroad during the\r\nyear that ended with September, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe United Fruit Company, of Boston, was formed in the year 1888, and\r\nten years later was said to have a surplus of more than $6,000,000,\r\nowned thousands of acres of bananas, and had built expressly for its\r\nfruit carrying business four superb steamers, and employed many others.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to assume that more than $6,000,000 was paid in the year\r\n1902, in Central America alone, to planters of bananas. Nearly all of\r\nthat was paid by products of American farms, factories and forests.\r\nFarmer, manufacturer and miner, lumberman, railroad man and sailor,\r\nmerchant and broker of this country, are all concerned in and benefited\r\nby the work done in shady aisles beneath banana leaves on the banks of\r\ntropic rivers.\r\n\r\nBananas reach their best estate on the low, deep alluvium near the\r\nCaribbean coast, where the temperature never sinks below 60° and is\r\nseldom below 80° F. Such low lands serve all the better if flooded\r\ntwo or three times in the year, for the banana will drink much water,\r\nand such floods bring silt from the hills, and thus keep the ground\r\nfertilized without cost to the owner. In 1897 famed banana fields of\r\nthe Rio Escondido were so deeply flooded that the steamship “Saga”\r\nvoyaged through the main streets of Rama, fully sixty miles from\r\nthe mouth of the river, to pick off from their roofs the dwellers\r\nin that town. The bananas barely showed their tops above the yellow\r\nflood. Along the coast flew reports that the plantations were ruined;\r\nsubscriptions were asked to help the planters: and three months\r\nlater they were harvesting better crops than in years before. Their\r\nplantations had been so enriched that they bore most bountifully.\r\n\r\nBananas may be grown wherever there is some moisture and no near\r\napproach to the frost line; but a touch of frost cuts down the banana\r\nas a breath from a fiery furnace would blight a tender lily. The city\r\nof Tegucigalpa is 3,600 feet above the level of the sea, yet in that\r\ntown is a field some thirty feet above the current in the swift river\r\nwhich it borders. It is very dry during months of each year, but in\r\nthat field are plátanos which reach a height of more than twenty feet\r\nand bear bunches enough comfortably to support the owner. In narrow\r\ncañon and wider valley near that place are many patches of bananas\r\nwhich bring to their planters a sufficient income. And at that altitude\r\nthe mercury sometimes falls below 65° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nIn the land of bananas, cats, dogs and pigs, mules, horses and cattle,\r\nparrots, babies and all other domestic animals thrive on this perfect\r\nnature-food, when they can get it. I have seen an Indian woman pry open\r\nwith her fingers the jaws of a baby peccary, and with a gruel of green\r\nbananas choke off its incessant, rasping cry of “ma, ma!” And the next\r\ninstant she put that same calabash of gruel to the lips of her own babe\r\nof three or four months. I’ve seen other Indians feed infant tapir,\r\nsuckling jaguar, skinny squabs of parrots and very young monkeys on\r\nsuch pap, which those folk call wabool. I, myself, have safely carried\r\nabandoned cardinals through from their infant days of a beggarly few\r\npin feathers to those of full regimentals of brilliant scarlet and\r\nepaulets of jet; and they were as overflowing with joyful song and\r\nsaucy happiness as they could have been had worms and bugs been the\r\nchief of their diet every day of their lives, instead of the bananas on\r\nwhich they had been largely fed.\r\n\r\nWhy not, indeed, when cakes and beer, brandy and sugar, pies, puddings\r\nand sauce, and many another thing good for man to take for his\r\nstomach’s sake, are made from bananas. So, too, are paper and laces,\r\nbrushes and cloth, and cordage enough to pull up the earth by its\r\nroots, if only we had a place to hook the tackle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVESTING BANANAS]\r\n\r\nWhen he has set out an acre or two of bananas, the planter need have no\r\nfears for the future. He has ample insurance against such privations\r\nas come from illness, accident or old age: and they who by a little\r\nlabor pay for such insurance share each day its material benefits. No\r\nneed for them to die that others may enjoy the blessings of such wise\r\nprovision; nor need the planter toil with hoe or spade, cultivator or\r\nplow. It may be he will slash away with machete such vine or sapling,\r\ngrass or weed as happens to obstruct his path; but as a whole he\r\ninterferes as little as possible with the operations of kindly Mother\r\nNature. She is more than ready to do his work: he is willing to let her\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nHe whose acre of bananas has been well planted has on it 225 hills,\r\nor 900 stalks. Each stalk will give him a bunch which, on rich, new\r\nground, should weigh 60 pounds, say 54,000 pounds each 12 or 14 months.\r\nThat is the theory. The fact seems to be that the average yield is\r\nreally 175 to 300 full bunches to the acre per annum, say a mean of\r\n270 bunches weighing about 16,000 pounds. The average yield reported\r\nall along the Caribbean shore and from Jamaica, during a dozen years,\r\nequaled 270.95 full bunches an acre per annum.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1902 the average yield of potatoes in the United States was\r\n80.44 bushels per acre, and the average farm value was 49 cents per\r\nbushel, or $39.45 an acre. In Costa Rica the average price of bananas\r\non the plantation was equal to at least 27 cents a bunch. At that\r\nfigure 261 bunches would bring $70.47. In August, 1903, the price was\r\nraised to 31 cents a bunch on contracts to run three to five years;\r\nwhich should give $84.00 per acre each year. That is a cash difference\r\nof $44.55 in favor of the man whose bananas raised themselves for him.\r\nThere was another difference in his favor, for his fruit may be eaten\r\ngreen or ripe, raw or roasted, boiled or fried, with fish, flesh or\r\nfowl, or with none of these.\r\n\r\nThose who dwell in the mountain regions, far from the ports whence\r\nbananas are shipped, dip in lye and dry in the sun many a plátano.\r\nIt is then shriveled, moldy-looking and altogether unlovely; but if\r\nkept dry it remains sweet and wholesome many a year. It may be eaten\r\nuncooked, when it is a gummy, sugary paste; but drop it into scalding\r\nwater, put it into a hot oven, or stick it up beside the fire, and it\r\nbecomes mightily puffed up, tender and savory. It might be sent thus\r\ndried to feed the people of the North or of Europe, for it would be\r\neasily packed and carried.\r\n\r\nNaturally the intelligent planter concerns himself mainly with the\r\nquestion: What is the cost, the yield and the profit of banana growing?\r\nThere are evidences that many people in the North feel a lively\r\ncuriosity about the same points.\r\n\r\nBefore one can give a trustworthy reply to such question he must study\r\nthe evidence of those who have had opportunity to learn the truth, and\r\nhe should be able to present the general averages of the results shown\r\nby many such witnesses. The planter of medium ability and industry\r\nmay confidently expect to attain the average results; he who has less\r\nintelligence and thrift should not complain if he fails to get as\r\ngood returns; he who shows more than common skill, application and\r\nenergy will win greater reward than is shown by the average of the\r\nbanana-growing of the many, as in other occupations great skill and\r\nindustry bring the larger rewards.\r\n\r\nReports covering years of experience by thousands of planters in the\r\nWest Indies and along the Atlantic coast of Mexico and of Central\r\nAmerica, indicate that the cost per acre of making banana plantations\r\nand cultivating and harvesting the first crop therefrom, the yield in\r\nbunches and the income, are as shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  ===========+=========+=========+=========+=========\r\n  Countries  | Bunches |  Income |   Cost  |  Profit\r\n  Costa Rica | 250.0   | $ 70 67 | $ 28 84 | $ 41 83\r\n  Guatamala  | 267.5   |  124 36 |   42 80 |   81 56\r\n  Honduras   | 294.0   |  121 13 |   18 97 |  102 16\r\n  Jamaica    | 288.0   |  109 48 |   27 58 |   81 90\r\n  Mexico     | 280.0   |  123 61 |   28 12 |   95 49\r\n  Nicaragua  | 246.2   |   86 36 |   22 07 |   64 29\r\n  -----------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  Averages   | 270.95  |$ 105 94 | $ 28 06 | $ 77 87\r\n  ===========+=========+=========+=========+=========\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it appears that the general average yield per acre\r\nduring the twenty years covered by the figures given, was 270.95\r\nbunches per acre; the average cost per acre was $28.06, which was only\r\n10.3 cents per bunch. The profit per bunch was 28.7 cents, or 287.9 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nA report dated August 1, 1903, by Las Haciendas de Santa Clara, Costa\r\nRica, which has 550 acres of bananas in full bearing, and where wages\r\nare one colon or 47 cents per diem, gives the cost of cultivating and\r\ndelivering the fruit at the railroad, as $17.69 per acre, the yield\r\nat 173 bunches and the income at $54.90 annually. That shows that the\r\nbananas cost 10.2 cents per bunch, and that the profit was 20.8 cents\r\na bunch, or 200 per cent. But as the fruit is sold five years ahead\r\nat those figures, the small percentage of profit may be regarded as a\r\nfair return for the investment, combined as it is with an assurance of\r\ncontinued gain.\r\n\r\nThere are those who insist that the higher results shown in the\r\nforegoing table may easily be obtained by any one who will give as much\r\nthought and labor to growing bananas as are required for the successful\r\nraising of corn or of potatoes. It is true that the figures on which\r\nthe averages shown are based were, in many cases, from the experience\r\nof native and other planters of little diligence and skill, and that\r\nthey got smaller results than might easily have been obtained. It may\r\nbe possible that if one will allow two or three stalks to rise from\r\neach stand of bananas, and together mature their fruit, he many get\r\n444 to 780 bunches from an acre each of a few years, and that in such\r\na case he might get $185 to $278 for the crop; but it will be clear\r\nto all that he who expects to make only 270 bunches per annum from an\r\nacre, and get only $78 profit therefrom, will be safer than he who\r\ninvests his money with the expectation of making greater gains.\r\n\r\nThe Hand Book of Nicaragua, published by the Bureau of American\r\nRepublics, which is under the direction of the U. S. Department of\r\nState, says:\r\n\r\n There is, perhaps, no industry in Central America that is more\r\n attractive to men of small capital than banana growing, from the fact\r\n that the clearing of the land is effected cheaply, and from the small\r\n cost of after-cultivation, which is limited only to such clearing of\r\n weeds and undergrowth as may be sufficient to allow access to the\r\n trees, and the short time necessary to produce a paying crop. When\r\n the trees and brush that have been cut in clearing the land become\r\n sufficiently dry, they are burned, and the banana suckers are then\r\n planted among the charred remains and ashes, without any further\r\n preparation of the soil. The best results are obtained by giving the\r\n trees plenty of space, say from 15 to 18 feet apart. In about ten\r\n months the first fruit can be gathered; but in the second year the\r\n trees reach maturity, and by a proper management of the fruit stalks\r\n in a fair sized plantation a constant succession in the crop may be\r\n secured, and fruit gathered every week throughout the year.\r\n\r\n The only careful work necessary on a banana plantation is in handling\r\n the heavy bunches so as to avoid bruising them, as any such injury\r\n causes a black spot to appear, beneath which decay quickly begins as\r\n the fruit ripens. The natives have learned by experience when they cut\r\n into the fruit stalk so to gauge the strength of the blow as to cut\r\n just deep enough to cause the stalk to bend slowly over until the end\r\n of the bunch reaches the ground, when another slash with the machete\r\n severs it, and it is loaded carefully into the cart.\r\n\r\n A plantation of 40 manzanas (about 69 acres) will, during and after\r\n the second year, produce about 54,000 bunches. The lowest price paid\r\n for bunches for some years past is 37½ cents per bunch, which would\r\n give an annual value of the crop of $20,250, or more than double the\r\n expenditure for purchase of land, clearing, cultivating and gathering\r\n the crop, and all expenses to the end of the second year.\r\n\r\nAs the cost of producing bananas after the first crop from a plantation\r\nis confined to cultivating and harvesting, which may be done for $10\r\nper acre yearly, it is scarcely wonderful that Judge O’Hara, late U.\r\nS. Consul at Greytown, Nicaragua, a lawyer whose acute mind is trained\r\nto sifting evidence, reported to the Department of State at Washington\r\nregarding banana-growing on the Atlantic coast of that republic, that:\r\n\r\n It seems reasonably certain that bananas on the Bluefields River pay\r\n better than many crops in the United States. * * * * These figures\r\n would seem to indicate that at the end of a year a planter having 36\r\n acres of bananas under cultivation would have $3,847.32 left after\r\n paying for all necessary labor and provisions--figures apt to bring\r\n discontent to an American farmer having but 36 acres of wheat or corn;\r\n and especially so when he compares the price of his land, ranging from\r\n $15 to $80 per acre, with that of land in eastern Nicaragua, where\r\n cultivated lands may be said to have no established market value, few\r\n improved plantations having ever been sold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEGINNING OF A LONG JOURNEY]\r\n\r\nSuch discontent might be aggravated by consideration of the differences\r\nwhich exist between the results obtained from the chief eight crops of\r\nthe United States and those shown by the foregoing summary of banana\r\nfarming. These differences are illustrated by the following figures,\r\nthose for the crops of the North showing the yield and values for the\r\nyear 1897. The last column shows the difference in favor of bananas per\r\nacre:\r\n\r\n  =================+==========+==========+===================\r\n        CROPS      |  Yield   |  Value   | Difference, favor\r\n                   | per acre | per acre | of Bananas\r\n  -----------------+----------+----------+-------------------\r\n  Barley, bushels  |   23.11  |  $12 34  |      $93 59\r\n  Buckwheat, 〃    |   16.08  |    9 69  |       96 25\r\n  Corn,      〃    |   24.62  |    9 51  |       96 43\r\n  Oats,      〃    |   27.19  |    8 29  |       97 65\r\n  Potatoes,  〃    |   80.44  |   39 45  |       66 49\r\n  Rye,       〃    |   13.30  |    8 22  |       97 72\r\n  Wheat,     〃    |   12.78  |   10 11  |       95 83\r\n  Hay, tons        |    1.26  |   10 93  |       95 01\r\n  Tobacco, pounds  |  797.30  |   55 81  |       50 13\r\n  -----------------+----------+----------+-------------------\r\n  General averages |          |  $18 28  |      $87 66\r\n  =================+==========+==========+===================\r\n\r\nFrom this it is evident that bananas give five and one-half times as\r\nmuch as the principal crops of the United States give the farmer for\r\nhis toil.\r\n\r\nMany native planters seem content with the returns their bananas give,\r\nand appear to have no thought of increasing that income.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you plant more bananas? See how well this little patch has\r\npaid,” I have said to many of them.\r\n\r\n“Why should I do that? Have I not plenty to eat? I have enough money;\r\nif I plant more I shall have to do more work to get more money which I\r\ndon’t need,” is the substance of their replies.\r\n\r\nYears ago U. S. Consul Burchard complained of the banana business of\r\nthe Honduras coast, that “A large proportion of the fruit-growers\r\nwere formerly vacqueros in the interior, working on a salary of $30\r\nto $40 a year. They are now owners of plantations, and have a steady\r\nincome of $30 to $300 a month. The large amount of money distributed\r\nalong this coast in exchange for fruit would make any civilized and\r\ntemperate community prosperous and happy. There would be public and\r\nprivate schools, churches and banks, newspapers and libraries, parks\r\nand carriages, and handsome dwellings supplied with every comfort and\r\nluxury, surrounded by gardens of flowers, fruits and vegetables natural\r\nto this climate of perpetual seedtime and harvest.”\r\n\r\nSo it soon will be, for already Italian and German, Englishman and\r\nAmerican have accepted the invitation of a most kindly Nature, and the\r\nsincere welcome of friendly natives, and cottages peep here and there\r\nfrom out the glossy greenery, hammocks swing beneath the never-ceasing\r\nrustle of the palms in the blessed trade winds, and the fruit of\r\nParadise gives to all a most generous support.\r\n\r\nBut those who have good lands back from navigable water and remote from\r\nrailroads, are not without hope of profit from bananas. For they may\r\ndry the fruit, pack it in dainty boxes with a liberal dusting of sugar\r\nto fill vacant spaces, and send it to the hungry millions of Europe.\r\nThis has been successfully done by planters of Trinidad and of Jamaica,\r\nwho, in at least some instances, found that they could sell the dried\r\nfruit at 16 to 20 cents a pound. Green bunches average nearly 60 pounds\r\nin weight, two-thirds of which is lost in peeling and drying, leaving\r\nabout 20 pounds, which, at 15 cents, will give $3 per bunch. If the\r\nproduction of the green bananas and the drying should cost $2 a bunch,\r\nthe income from an acre of bananas would be $288 yearly. In practice it\r\nhas been found that the total cost and income of dried bananas give a\r\nnet return of $2.72 per bunch, which equaled about $783 per acre.\r\n\r\nBoth plátanos and guineos, or ordinary yellow bananas, may be\r\nprofitably dried or made into flour. This will utilize the surplus\r\nfruit and such bunches as are too small to sell to advantage. Frequent\r\nmention is made by Stanley, of banana flour in his “In Darkest Africa.”\r\nHe strongly indorses its nutritive qualities, and wonders that the\r\nnatives did not appear to have discovered what invaluable nourishing\r\nand easily digested food they had in the plátano and banana. He\r\nexpressed the conviction that, “If only the virtues of banana flour\r\nwere publicly known, it is not to be doubted but it would be largely\r\nconsumed in Europe. For infants, persons of delicate digestion,\r\ndyspeptics and those suffering from temporary derangement of the\r\nstomach, the flour properly prepared would be of universal demand.\r\nDuring my two attacks of gastritis a light gruel of this, mixed with\r\nmilk, was the only matter that could be digested.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that such a high authority as the “Dictionary\r\nof Economical Productions of India” says:\r\n\r\n The large crop of food produced by bananas and plantains may be\r\n preserved for an indefinite period either by drying the fruit or\r\n by preparing meal from it. When the nearly ripe fruit is cut into\r\n slices and dried in the sun, a certain part of the sugar contained\r\n in the fruit crystalizes on the surface and acts as a preservative.\r\n The slices thus prepared, if made from the finer varieties, make an\r\n excellent dessert preserve, and if from the coarser, may be used for\r\n cooking in the ordinary way. They keep well if carefully packed when\r\n dry, and ought to form a valuable antiscorbutic for long voyages.\r\n The fruit may also be similarly preserved whole by stripping off the\r\n skin and drying it in the sun. Plantain meal is prepared by stripping\r\n off the husk and reducing it to powder, and finely sifting. It is\r\n calculated that the fresh core will yield 40 per cent. of this meal,\r\n and that an acre of average quality will yield over a ton.\r\n\r\n Plantain meal is of a slightly brownish color, and has an agreeable\r\n odor, which becomes more perceptible when warm water is poured upon\r\n it, and has a considerable resemblance to that of orris root. When\r\n mixed with cold water it forms a feebly tenacious dough, more adhesive\r\n than that of oatmeal, but much less so than that of wheaten flour.\r\n When baked on a hot plate this dough forms a cake which is agreeable\r\n to the sense of smell, and is by no means unpleasant to the taste.\r\n When boiling water is poured over the meal it is changed into a\r\n transparent jelly, having an agreeable taste and smell. Boiled with\r\n water it forms a thick gelatinous mass, very much like boiled sago in\r\n color, but possessing a peculiar pleasant odor.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be interesting to note that, according to\r\nan analysis published in the _American Analyst_, New York, February\r\n15th, 1893, the chemical composition of bananas and potatoes is almost\r\nidentical, as shown by the following comparison:\r\n\r\n                                              Banana  Potato\r\n  Water                                        75.71  75.77\r\n  Albumenoids                                   1.71   1.79\r\n  Total carbonaceous matter (non-nitrogenous)  20.13  20.72\r\n  Woody fibre                                   1.74    .75\r\n  Ash                                            .71    .97\r\n\r\nNor do the food elements in bananas and plátanos vary greatly, the sum\r\nof each being about the same.\r\n\r\nIn a communication to Kew by Mr. Louis Asser, of the Hague, Holland,\r\nit was announced that a syndicate proposes to take up the manufacture\r\nof banana and plantain meal and the preparation of dried bananas on\r\na large scale in Dutch Guiana. The communication referred to gives\r\nthe following list of commercial preparations from the banana and the\r\nplátano:\r\n\r\n 1. Dried slices of the entire fruit (pulp and peel) in the starchy\r\n state suitable for the preparation of alcohol or for making into a\r\n nourishing bread.\r\n\r\n 2. Meal in a starchy state from the pulp only for making into a\r\n superior kind of bread or porridge.\r\n\r\n 3. Flakes and meal in a dextrinous state for use in breweries or for\r\n making into nourishing soups, puddings, etc.\r\n\r\n 4. Dried peel and coarse meal prepared from it for feeding cattle and\r\n pigs.\r\n\r\n 5. Banana marmalade.\r\n\r\n 6. Dried bananas entire without peel put up like dried figs in boxes.\r\n\r\n 7. Raw alcohol from fresh bananas, and also from dried banana meal.\r\n\r\n 8. Syrup of bananas for confectionery, for preparations of liquors and\r\n for sweetening champagne.\r\n\r\n 9. Banana meal for the manufacture of glucose.\r\n\r\n 10. Fibre of banana and plantain prepared from the stems after\r\n fruiting, and intended for the manufacture of paper and cordage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEGINNING OF A GREAT TRAFFIC]\r\n\r\nMr. Asser estimates the entire cost of a ton of banana meal, delivered\r\nin Europe, at $23. This includes cost of cultivation, gathering the\r\ncrop, making the meal, and the freight. At that time the average market\r\nvalue of Indian wheat in Liverpool was $30 per ton. Considering the\r\nselling value of the meal to be no greater than that of the wheat, the\r\nprices quoted would show a margin of profit equal to about 30 per cent.\r\non the capital invested.\r\n\r\nFrom British Guiana comes the following interesting information\r\nabout plátano flour, taken from a report by Dr. Shier on the\r\n“Starch-producing Plants” of that country:\r\n\r\n The plantain is so abundant and cheap that it might, if cut and dried\r\n in its green state, be exported with advantage. It is in this unripe\r\n state that it is so largely used by the peasantry of this Colony as\r\n an article of food. When dried and reduced to the state of meal, it\r\n cannot like wheat flour, be manufactured into macaroni or vermicelli,\r\n or, at least, the macaroni made from it falls into powder when put\r\n into hot water. Plantain meal is prepared by stripping off the husk\r\n of the plantain, slicing the core, and drying it in the sun. When\r\n thoroughly dry it is powdered and sifted. It has a fragrant odor,\r\n acquired in drying, somewhat resembling fresh hay or tea. It is\r\n largely employed as the food of infants and invalids. In respect to\r\n nutritiveness it deserves a preference over all the pure starches on\r\n account of the proteine compounds it contains. The flavor of the meal\r\n depends a good deal on the rapidity with which the slices are dried.\r\n Above all, the plantain must not be allowed to approach too closely\r\n to yellowness or ripeness, otherwise it becomes impossible to dry it.\r\n The color of the meal is injured when steel knives are used in husking\r\n or slicing, but silver or nickel blades do not injure the color.\r\n Full-sized and well-filled bunches give 60 per cent. of core to 40\r\n per cent. of husk and top-stem; but in general it would be found that\r\n the core did not much exceed 50 per cent. of dry meal, so that from\r\n 20 to 25 per cent. of meal is obtained from the plantain, or 5 pounds\r\n from the average bunch of 25 pounds; and an acre of plantain walk of\r\n average quality, producing during the year 450 such bunches, would\r\n yield 4 tons and 10 pounds of meal.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, C. W. Meaden wrote from Trinidad to the following effect in\r\nrelation to a trial shipment of dried bananas:\r\n\r\n This experiment will prove of importance to banana growers, as drying\r\n bananas seems to open a way no other means offers of utilizing fruit.\r\n It overcomes the difficulty of bad roads, long hauls and other\r\n drawbacks some planters have to face in marketing bananas.\r\n\r\n The result of drying six bunches, weighing an average of 52 pounds\r\n per ripe bunch, was 97 pounds of dried fruit. There was a loss of\r\n two-thirds in peeling and drying. The fruit sold for $19.40, or 20\r\n cents per pound. Deducting freight charges left $15.47, or a fraction\r\n under 16 cents per pound. This was at the rate of $2.72 per bunch. The\r\n cost was put at 53 cents, which covered purchase of land, clearing\r\n woods and draining, planting, weeding and cutting, drying, fuel, boxes\r\n and packing; but did not include cost of dryer, as that would be but\r\n a fraction on each bunch dried. After deducting the above there was a\r\n profit of $2.19 per bunch.\r\n\r\nMr. Meaden said of this:\r\n\r\n I do not desire to set up as a teacher, but facts and figures speak\r\n for themselves. The account shown is not an approximate one, but the\r\n money has been received and the Canadians are asking for more at the\r\n same price. An order is now in hand for 224 pounds for London at\r\n 6d. per pound in bulk, the consignee to do the retail packing and\r\n advertising. As the fruit is something new it is being sought, and\r\n all that can be dried is being profitably disposed of. I may add that\r\n the dryer does his work well, turning out the fruit in uniform color.\r\n Attention must be paid to this, and also that fruit as nearly as\r\n possible of one size be dried, as this facilitates packing. Small ones\r\n can be used for stock, etc. Twelve good sized fruits weigh one pound.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Gleaner_, of Kingston, Jamaica, said in March, 1899, in\r\nreference to an enterprise on the Montpelier estate of Hon. Evelyn\r\nEllis:\r\n\r\n As far as dried bananas are concerned the investment is a success.\r\n Orders are already taken for more than can be supplied. The factory\r\n will be duplicated as soon as possible. Every one who has tasted the\r\n bananas is of the opinion that they are superior to figs in every way,\r\n and there is likely to be a large home consumption as soon as the\r\n factory can supply the market.\r\n\r\nHousewives who wish for novelties to lend new charm to their tables,\r\nto tickle the palate of the epicure, or to coax the reluctant appetite\r\nof the invalid, will find them in novel dainties made from bananas.\r\nExcellent and nutritious bread may be made of the flour. Puddings,\r\nfritters and sauce have already been mentioned; but bananas glacé are\r\nnew to most northern folk, and may be made a most delightful addition\r\nto our desserts. They are superior to dried figs, for when split into\r\nfour slices, thickly covered with powdered sugar, and exposed to the\r\nsun awhile they turn themselves into a jelly-like, delicious and\r\ndelicate confection, such as is at its best when made in the native\r\nhome of the fruit, and packed in pretty boxes to be sent to people of\r\nfine taste in the cold North.\r\n\r\nHaving in view all these facts, why should not multitudes make homes\r\nwhere scorching heat and biting cold are never felt, and tornado and\r\ndeadly blizzard are unknown; where no destructive floods nor ruinous\r\ndroughts ever come, and never ceasing winds bring coolness from the\r\nsea; where spring is eternal and harvests never end, and delicious\r\nfruits yield profusely all the years; where the pine and palm together\r\nshade the ground, and the coco and banana yield generous provision\r\nfor every need; where a little work insures against want and care, and\r\nhealth and leisure make old age secure and content?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note\r\n\r\nMinor typographical errors (i.e. missing punctuation and “egiv”\r\nchanged to “give”) have been corrected.",
