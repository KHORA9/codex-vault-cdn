Carse; Edin_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nIf ever the story of any private man's adventures in the world were\r\nworth making public, and were acceptable when published, the Editor of\r\nthis account thinks this will be so.\r\n\r\nThe wonders of this man's life exceed all that (he thinks) is to be\r\nfound extant; the life of one man being scarce capable of a\r\ngreater variety.\r\n\r\nThe story is told with modesty, with seriousness, and with a religious\r\napplication of events to the uses to which wise men always apply them,\r\nviz. to the instruction of others by this example, and to justify and\r\nhonour the wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our circumstances,\r\nlet them happen how they will.\r\n\r\nThe editor believes this narrative to be a just history of fact; neither\r\nis their any appearance of fiction in it: and though he is well aware\r\nthere are many, who on account of the very singular preservations the\r\nauthor met with, will give it the name of romance; yet in which ever of\r\nthese lights it shall be viewed, he imagines, that the improvement of\r\nit, as well as the diversion, as to the instruction of the reader, will\r\nbe the same; and as such, he thinks, without farther compliment to the\r\nworld, he does them a great service in the publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nLIFE AND ADVENTURES\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nROBINSON CRUSOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born at York, in the year 1632, of a reputable family. My father\r\nwas a native of Bremen, who by merchandizing at Hull for some time,\r\ngained a very plentiful fortune. He married my mother at York, who\r\nreceived her first breath in that country: and as her maiden name was\r\nRobinson, I was called _Robinson Kreutznaer_: which not being easily\r\npronounced in the English tongue, we are commonly known by the name\r\nof Crusoe.\r\n\r\nI was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was a lieutenant\r\ncolonel in Lochart's regiment, but slain by the Spaniards: what became\r\nof the other, I could never learn.\r\n\r\nNo charge or pains were wanting in my education.--My father designed me\r\nfor the law; yet nothing would serve me but I must go to sea, both\r\nagainst the will of my father, the tears of my mother, and the\r\nentreaties of friends. One morning my father expostulated very warmly\r\nwith me: What reason, says he, have you to leave your native country,\r\nwhere there must be a more certain prospect of content and happiness, to\r\nenter into a wandering condition of uneasiness and uncertainty? He\r\nrecommended to me Augur's wish, \"Neither to desire poverty nor riches:\"\r\nthat a middle state of life was the most happy, and that the high\r\ntowering thoughts of raising our condition by wandering abroad, were\r\nsurrounded with misery and danger, and often ended with confusion and\r\ndisappointment. I entreat you, nay, I command you, (says he) to desist\r\nfrom these intentions. Consider your elder brother, who laid down his\r\nlife for his honour, or rather lost it for his disobedience to my will.\r\nIf you will go (added he) my prayers shall however be offered for your\r\npreservation; but a time may come, when, desolate, oppressed, or\r\nforsaken, you may wish you had taken your poor despised father's\r\ncounsel.--He pronounced these words with such a moving and paternal\r\neloquence, while floods of tears ran down his aged cheeks, that it\r\nseemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But this soon wore, off,\r\nand a little after I informed my mother, that I could not settle to any\r\nbusiness, my resolutions were so strong to see the world; and begged she\r\nwould gain my father's consent only to go one voyage; which, if I did\r\nnot prove prosperous, I would never attempt a second. But my desire was\r\nas vain as my folly in making. My mother passionately expressed her\r\ndislike of this, proposal, telling me, \"That as she saw I was bent upon\r\nmy own destruction, contrary to their will and my duty, she would say no\r\nmore; but leave me to do whatever I pleased.\"\r\n\r\nI was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one time being Hull; I met\r\na school-fellow of mine, going along with his father, who was master of\r\na ship, to London; and acquainted him with my wandering desires; he\r\nassured me of a free passage, and a plentiful share of what was\r\nnecessary. Thus, without imploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my\r\nparents, I took shipping on the first of September 1651. We set sail\r\nsoon after, and our ship had scarce left the Humber astern, when there\r\narose so violent a storm, that, being extremely sea-sick, I concluded\r\nthe judgment of God deservedly followed me for my disobedience to my\r\ndear parents. It was then I called to mind, the good advice of my\r\nfather; how easy and comfortable was a middle state of life; and I\r\nfirmly resolved, if it pleased God to set me on dry land once more, I\r\nwould return to my parents, implore their forgiveness, and bid a final\r\nadieu to my wandering inclinations.\r\n\r\nSuch were my thoughts while the storm continued: but these good\r\nresolutions decreased with the danger; more especially when my companion\r\ncame to me, clapping me on the shoulder: \"What, Bob!\" said he, \"sure you\r\nwas not frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind?\"--\"And do\r\nyou\" cried I, \"call such a violent storm a capful of wind?\"--\"A storm,\r\nyou fool you,\" said he, \"this is nothing; a good ship and sea-room\r\nalways baffles such a foolish squall of wind as that: But you're a fresh\r\nwater sailor: Come boy, turn out, see what fine weather we have now, and\r\na good bowl of punch will drown all your past sorrows.\" In short, the\r\npunch was made, I was drunk and in one night's time drowned both my\r\nrepentance and my good resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows and\r\npromises I made in my distress: and whenever any reflections would\r\nreturn on me, what by company, and what by drinking, I soon mastered\r\nthose fits, as I deridingly called them. But this only made way for\r\nanother trial, whereby I could not but see how much I was beholden to\r\nkind Providence.\r\n\r\nUpon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich road, where we lay\r\nwind bound with some Newcastle ships; and there being good anchorage,\r\nand our cables found, the seamen forgot their late toil and danger, and\r\nspent the time as merry as if they had been on shore. But on the eight\r\nday there arose a brisk gale of wind, which prevented our tiding it up\r\nthe river; and still increasing, our ship rode forecastle in, and\r\nshipped several large seas.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before horror seized the seamen themselves, and I heard\r\nthe master express this melancholy ejaculation, \"Lord have mercy upon\r\nus, we shall be all, lost and undone!\" For my part, sick unto death, I\r\nkept my cabin till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions of\r\nour speedy fate made me get upon deck; and there I was affrighted\r\nindeed. The sea went mountains high: I could see nothing but distress\r\naround us; two ships had cut their masts on board, and another was\r\nfoundered; two more that had lost their anchors, were forced out to the\r\nmercy of the ocean; and to save our lives we were forced to cut our\r\nforemast and mainmast quite away.\r\n\r\nWho is their so ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful condition? I was\r\nbut a fresh-water sailor and therefore it seemed more terrible. Our ship\r\nwas very good, but over-loaded; which made the sailors often cry out,\r\n\"She would founder!\" Words I then was ignorant of. All this while the\r\nstorm continuing, and rather increasing, the master and the most sober\r\npart of his men went to prayers, expecting death every moment. In the\r\nmiddle of the night one cried out, \"We had sprung a leak;\" another,\r\n\"That there was four feet water in the hold.\" I was just ready to expire\r\nwith fear, when immediately all hands were called to the pump; and the\r\nmen forced me also in that extremity to share with them in their labour.\r\nWhile thus employed, the master espying some light colliers, fired a gun\r\nas a signal of distress; and I, not understanding what it meant, and\r\nthinking that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing happened,\r\nfell into a swoon. Even in that common condition of woe, nobody minded\r\nme, excepting to thrust me aside with their feet, thinking me dead, and\r\nit was a great while before I recovered.\r\n\r\nHappy it was for us, when, upon the signal given, they ventured out\r\ntheir boats to save our lives. All our pumping had been in vain, and\r\nvain had all our attempts been, had they not come to our ship's side,\r\nand our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, which\r\nafter great labour they got hold of, and we hauling them up to us got\r\ninto their boat, and left our ship which we perceived sink within less\r\nthan a quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what was meant by\r\n_foundering at sea._ And now the men incessantly laboured to recover\r\ntheir, own ship; but the sea ran so high, and the wind blew so hard,\r\nthat they thought it convenient to hale within shore; which, with great\r\ndifficulty and danger, at last we happily effected landing at a place\r\ncalled _Cromer_, not far from Winterton lighthouse; from whence we all\r\nwalked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of pity, many good people\r\nfurnished us with necessaries to carry us either to Hull or London.\r\n\r\nStrange, after all this, like the prodigal son, I did not return to my\r\nfather; who hearing of the ship's calamity, for a long time thought me\r\nentombed in the deep. No doubt but I should have _shared on his fatted\r\ncalf_, as the scripture expresseth it; but my ill fate still pusheth me\r\non, in spite of the powerful convictions of reason and conscience.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my old companion, who had\r\ngiven me the invitation to go on board along with his father. His\r\nbehaviour and speech were altered, and in a melancholy manner asked me\r\nhow I did, telling his father who I was, & how I had made this voyage\r\nonly for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon which the old gentleman\r\nturning to me gravely, said, \"Young man, you ought never to go to sea\r\nany more, but to take this for a certain sign that you never will\r\nprosper in a sea-faring condition.\" \"Sir\" answered I, \"will you take the\r\nsame resolution?\" \"It is a different case,\" said he, \"it is my calling,\r\nand consequently my duty; but as you have made this voyage for a trial,\r\nyou see what ill success heaven has set before your eyes; and perhaps\r\nour miseries have been on your account, like _Jonah_ in the ship of\r\n_Tarshish_. But pray what are you, and on what account did you go to\r\nsea?\" Upon which I very freely declared my whole story: at the end of\r\nwhich he made this exclamation: \"Ye sacred powers: what had I committed,\r\nthat such a wretch should enter into my ship to heap upon me such a\r\ndeluge of miseries!\" But soon recollecting his passion, \"Young man\" said\r\nhe, \"if you do not go back, depend upon it, wherever you go, you will\r\nmeet with disasters and disappointments till your father's words are\r\nfulfilled upon you.\" And so we parted.\r\n\r\nI thought at first to return home; but shame opposed that good motion,\r\nas thinking I should be laughed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So\r\nstrange is the nature of youth, who are not ashamed to sin, but yet\r\nashamed to repent; and so far from being ashamed of those actions for\r\nwhich they may be acounted fools, they think it folly to return to their\r\nduty, which is the principal mark of wisdom. In short I travelled up to\r\nLondon, resolving upon a voyage, and a voyage I soon heard of, by my\r\nacquaintance with a captain who took a fancy to me, to go to the coast\r\nof Guinea. Having some money, and appearing like a gentleman, I went on\r\nboard, not as a common sailor or foremast man; nay, the commander agreed\r\nI should go that voyage with him without any expence; that I should be\r\nhis messmate and companion, and I was very welcome to carry any thing\r\nwith me, and make the best merchandise I could.\r\n\r\nI blessed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked my captain for this\r\noffer; and acquainting my friends in Yorkshire, forty pounds were sent\r\nme, the greatest part of which my dear father and mother contributed to,\r\nwith which I bought toys and trifles, as the captain directed me. My\r\ncaptain also taught me navigation, how to keep an account of the ship's\r\ncourse, take an observation, and led me into the knowledge of several\r\nuseful branches of the mathematics. And indeed this voyage made me both\r\na sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of\r\ngold-dust for my adventure which produced, at my return to London,\r\nalmost three hundred pounds. But in this voyage I was extremely sick,\r\nbeing thrown into a violent calenture through the excessive heat,\r\ntrading upon the coast from the latitude of fifteen degrees north, even\r\nto the line itself.\r\n\r\nBut alas! my dear friend the captain soon departed this life after his\r\narrival. This was a sensible grief to me; yet I resolved to go another\r\nwith his mate, who had now got command of the ship. This proved a very\r\nunsuccessful one; for though I did not carry quite a hundred pounds of\r\nmy late acquired wealth, (so that I had two hundred pounds left, which I\r\nreposed with the captain's widow, who was an honest gentlewoman) yet my\r\nmisfortunes in this unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship sailing\r\ntowards the Canary islands, we were chased by a Salee rover; and in\r\nspite of all the haste we could make by crowding as much canvas as our\r\nyards could spread, or our masts carry, the pirate gained upon us, to\r\nthat we prepared ourselves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and we had\r\nbut twelve. About three in the afternoon there was a desperate\r\nengagement, wherein many were killed and wounded on both sides; but\r\nfinding ourselves overpowered with numbers, our ship disabled and\r\nourselves too impotent to have the least hopes of success, we were\r\nforced to surrender; and accordingly were all carried prisoners into the\r\nport of Salee. Our men were sent to the Emperor's court to be sold\r\nthere, but the pirate captain taking notice of me, kept me to be his\r\nown slave.\r\n\r\nIn this condition, I thought myself the most miserable creature on\r\nearth, and the prophecy of my father came afresh into my thoughts.\r\nHowever, my condition was better than I thought it to be, as will soon\r\nappear. Some hopes indeed I had that my new patron would go to sea\r\nagain, where he might be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war,\r\nand then I should be set at liberty. But in this I was mistaken; for he\r\nnever took me with him, but left me to look after his little garden, and\r\ndo the drudgery of his house, and when he returned from sea, would make,\r\nme lie in the cabin, and look after the ship. I had no one that I could\r\ncommunicate my thoughts to, which were continually meditating my escape;\r\nno Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here but myself; and for two years\r\nI could see nothing practicable, but only pleased myself with the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAfter some length of time, my patron, as I found, grew; so poor that he\r\ncould not fit out his ship as usual; and then he used constantly, once\r\nor twice a week, if the weather was fair, to go out a fishing, taking me\r\nand a young Moresco Boy to row the boat; and to much pleased was he with\r\nme for my dexterity in catching the fish, that he would often send me\r\nwith a Moor, who was one of his kinsemen, and the Moresco youth, to\r\ncatch a dish of fish for him.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as we were at the sport, there arose such a thick fog that\r\nwe lost sight of the shore; and rowing we knew not which way, we\r\nlaboured all the night, and in the morning found ourselves in the ocean,\r\ntwo leagues from land. However, we attained there at length, and made\r\nthe greater haste, because our stomachs were exceedingly sharp and\r\nhungry. In order to prevent such disasters for the future, my patron\r\nordered a carpenter to build a little state room or cabin in the middle\r\nof the long-boat, with a place behind it to steer and hale home the\r\nmain-sheet, with other conveniences to keep him from the weather, as\r\nalso lockers to put in all manner of provisions, with a handsome\r\nshoulder of mutton sail, gibing over the cabin.\r\n\r\nIn this he frequently took us out a fishing: and one time inviting two\r\nor three persons of distinction to go with him, made provision\r\nextraordinary, providing also three fusees with powder and shot, that\r\nthey might have some sport at fowling along the sea-coast. The next\r\nmorning the boat was made clean, her ancient and pendants on, and every\r\nthing ready: but their minds altering, my patron ordered us to go a\r\nfishing, for that his guests would certainly sup with him that night.\r\n\r\nAnd now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. In order to this I\r\npersuaded to Moor to get some provisions on board, as not daring to\r\nmeddle with our patron's: and he taking my advice, we stored ourselves\r\nwith rusk biscuit, and three jars of water. Besides, I privately\r\nconveyed into the boat a bottle or brandy, some twine, thread, a hammer,\r\nhatchet, and a saw; and, in particular, some bees wax, which was a great\r\ncomfort to me, and served to make candles. I then persuaded Muley (for\r\nso was the Moor called) to procure some powder and shot, pretending to\r\nkill sea curlues, which he innocently and readily agreed to. In short,\r\nbeing provided with all things necessary, we sailed out, resolving for\r\nmy own part to make my escape, though it should cost me my life.\r\n\r\nWhen we had passed the castle, we fell a fishing; but though I knew\r\nthere was a bite, I dissembled the matter, in order to put out further\r\nto sea. Accordingly we ran a league further; when giving the boy the\r\nhelm, and pretending to stoop for something, I seized Muley by surprise\r\nand threw him overboard. As he was an excellent swimmer, he soon arose\r\nand made towards the boat; upon which I took out a fusee, and presented\r\nat him: \"Muley\" said I, \"I never yet designed to do you any harm, and\r\nseek nothing now but my redemption. I know you are able enough to swim\r\nto shore, and save your life: but if you are resolved to follow me to\r\nthe endangering of mine, the very moment you proceed, I will shoot you\r\nthrough the head.\" The harmless creature at these words, turned himself\r\nfrom me, and I make no doubt got safe to land. Them turning to the boy\r\nXury, I perceived he trembled at the action: but I put him out of all\r\nfear, telling him, that if he would be true and faithful to me, I would\r\ndo well by him. \"And therefore,\" said I, \"you must stroke your face to\r\nbe faithful: and, as the Turks have learned you, swear by Mahomet, and\r\nthe beard of your father, or else I will throw you into the sea also.\"\r\nSo innocent did the child then look, and with such an obliging smile\r\nconsented, that I readily believed him, and from that day forward began\r\nto love him entirely.\r\n\r\nWe then pursued our voyage: and least they should think me gone to the\r\nStraits' mouth, I kept to the southward to the truly Barbarian coast;\r\nbut in the dusk of the evening, I changed my course, and steering\r\ndirectly S. and by E. that I might keep near the shore: and, having a\r\nfresh gale of wind, with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o'clock next\r\nday I was one hundred and fifty miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco's\r\ndominions. Yet still having the dreadful apprehensions of being retaken,\r\nI continued sailing for five days successively, till such time as the\r\nwind shifting to the southward, made me conclude, that if any vessel was\r\nin the chase of me, they would proceed no farther. After so much fatigue\r\nand thought, I anchored at the mouth of a little river, I knew not what\r\nor where: neither did I then see, any people. What I principally wanted\r\nwas fresh water; and I was resolved about dusk to swim ashore. But no\r\nsooner did the gloomy clouds of night begin to succeed the declining\r\nday, when we heard such barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures,\r\nthat one might have thought the very strongest monsters of nature, or\r\ninfernal spirits had their residence there. Poor Xury, almost dead with\r\nfear, entreated me not to go on shore that night. \"Supposing I don't,\r\nXury,\" said I, \"and in the morning we should see men who are worse than\r\nthose we fear, what then?\" \"O den we may give dem de shoot gun,\" replied\r\nXury, laughing, \"and de gun make dem all run away.\"\r\n\r\nThe wit and broken English which the boy had learned among the captives\r\nof our nation, pleased me entirely: and, to add to his cheerfulness I\r\ngave him a dram of the bottle: we could get but little sleep all the\r\nnight for those terrible howlings they made; and, indeed, we were both\r\nvery much affrighted, when, by the rollings of the water, and other\r\ntokens, we justly concluded one of these monsters made towards our boat.\r\nI could not see till it came within two oars length, when taking my\r\nfusee, I let fly at him. Whether I hit him or no, I cannot tell; but he\r\nmade towards the shore, and the noise of my gun increased the\r\nstupendious noise of the monsters.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was resolved to go on shore to get fresh water, and\r\nventure my life among the beasts or savages should either attack me.\r\nXury said, he would take one of the jars and bring me some. I asked him\r\nwhy he would go and not I? The poor boy answered, \"If wild mans come\r\nthey eat me, you go away.\" A mind scarcely now to be imitated, so\r\ncontrary to self-preservation, the most powerful law of Nature. This\r\nindeed increased my affection to the child. \"Well, dear Xury,\" said I,\r\nwe will both go ashore, both kill wild mans, and they \"shall eat neither\r\nof us.\" So giving Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we\r\nwaded ashore, carrying nothing with us but our arms, and two jars for\r\nwater. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as dreading the savages\r\ncoming down the river in their canoes; but the boy seeing a low descent\r\nor vale about a mile in the country, he wandered to it: and then running\r\nback to me with great precipitation, I thought he was pursued by some\r\nsavage or wild beast; upon which I approached, resolving to perish or\r\nprotect him from danger. As he came nearer to me, I saw something\r\nhanging over his shoulders, which was a creature he had shot like a\r\nhare, but different in colour, and longer legs; however, we were glad of\r\nit, for it proved wholesome, and nourishing meat: but what added to our\r\njoy was, my boy assured me there was plenty of water, and that he _see\r\nno wild mans. _And greater still was our comfort when we found fresh\r\nwater in the creek where we were when the tide was out, without going so\r\nfar up into the country.\r\n\r\nIn this place I began to consider that the Canary and Cape de Verde\r\nislands lay not for off: but having no instrument, I knew not what\r\nlatitude, or when to stand off to sea for them; yet my hopes were, I\r\nshould meet some of the English trading vessels, who would relieve and\r\ntake us in.\r\n\r\nThe place I was in was no doubt that wild country, inhabited only by a\r\nfew, that lies between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the\r\nNegroes. It is filled with wild beasts and the Moors use it for hunting\r\nchiefly.--From this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain\r\nTeneriff in the Canaries: which made me try twice to attain it: but as\r\noften was I drove back, and so forced to pursue my fortune along shore.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning we came to an anchor under a little point of land, but\r\npretty high; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready to go further\r\nin--But Xury, whose youthful and penetrating eyes were sharper then\r\nmine, in a soft tone, desired me to keep far from land, lest we should\r\nbe devoured, \"For look yonder, mayter,\" said he, \"and see de dreadful\r\nmonster fast asleep on de side of de hill.\" Accordingly looking where he\r\npointed, I espied a fearful monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion\r\nthat lay on shore, covered as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill.\r\n\"Xury,\" said I, \"you shall go on shore and kill him.\" But the boy looked\r\namazed: \"Me kill him!\" says he, \"he eat me at one mouth:\" meaning one\r\nmouthful. Upon which I bid him lie still, and charging my biggest gun\r\nwith two slugs, and a good charge of powder, I took the best aim I could\r\nto shoot him through the head, but his leg lying over his nose, the slug\r\nbroke his knee-bone. The lion awaking with the pain, got up, but soon\r\nfell down, giving the most hideous groan I ever heard: but taking my\r\nsecond piece, I shot him through the head, and then he lay struggling\r\nfor life. Upon this Xury took heart and desired my leave to go on shore.\r\n\"Go then,\" said I. Upon which taking a little gun in one hand, he swam\r\nto shore with the other, and coming close to the lion, put a period to\r\nhis life, by shooting him again through the head.\r\n\r\nBut this was spending our ammunition in vain, the flesh not being good\r\nto eat. Xury was like a champion, and comes on board for a hatchet, to\r\ncut of the head of his enemy: but not having strength to perform it, he\r\ncut off and brought me a foot. I bethought me, however, that his skin\r\nwould be of use. This work cost Xury and me a whole day: when spreading\r\nit on the top of our cabin, the hot beams of the sun effectually dried\r\nit in two days time, and it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on.\r\n\r\nAnd now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our provisions, and\r\nwent no oftener on shore than we were obliged for fresh water. My design\r\nwas to make the river Gambia or Senegal, or any where about the Cape de\r\nVerde, in hopes to meet some European ship. If Providence did not so\r\nfavour me, my next course was to seek for the islands, or lose my life\r\namong the Negroes. And in a word, I put my whole stress upon this,\r\n\"Either that I must meet with some ship or certainly perish.\"\r\n\r\nOne day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand on the shore\r\nlooking at us: we could also perceive they were black and stark naked. I\r\nwas inclined to go on shore, but Xury cried, \"No, no:\" however, I\r\napproached nearer, and I found they run along the shore by me a good\r\nway. They had no weapons in their hands, except one, who held a long\r\nstick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which they could kill at a\r\ngreat distance. I talked to them by signs and made them sensible I\r\nwanted something to eat: they beckoned to me to stop my boat, while two\r\nof them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour came\r\nback, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh, and some corn,\r\nwhich we kindly accepted; and to prevent any fears on either side, they\r\nbrought the food to the shore, laid it down, then went and stood a great\r\nway off till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again.\r\n\r\nBut while we were returning thanks to them, being all we could afford,\r\ntwo mighty creatures came from the mountains: one as it were pursuing\r\nthe other with great fury, which we were the rather inclined to believe\r\nas they seldom appear but in the night: and both these swiftly passing\r\nby the Negroes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swimming about, as tho'\r\nthe diversion of the waters had put a stop to their fierceness. At last\r\none of them coming nearer to my boat than I expected or desired, I shot\r\nhim directly through the head; upon which he sunk immediately, and yet\r\nrising again, would have willingly made the shore: but between the wound\r\nand the strangling of the water, he died before he could reach it.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the consternation the poor Negroes were in\r\nat the firing of my gun; much less can I mention their surprise, when\r\nthey perceived the creature to be slain by it. I made signs to them to\r\ndraw near it with a rope, and then gave it them to hale on shore. It was\r\na beautiful leopard, which made me desire its skin: and the Negroes\r\nseeming to covet the carcase, I freely gave it to them. As for the other\r\nleopard, it made to shore, and ran with prodigious swiftness out of\r\nsight. The Negroes having kindly furnished me with water, and with what\r\nroots and grains their country afforded, I took my leave, and, after\r\neleven days sail, came in sight of the Cape de Verde, and those islands\r\ncalled by its name. But the great distance I was from it, and fearing\r\ncontrary winds would prevent my reaching them, I began to grow\r\nmelancholy and dejected, when, upon a sudden, Xury cried out, \"Master!\r\nMaster! a ship with a sail!\" and looked as affrighted as if it was his\r\nmaster's ship sent in search of us. But I soon discovered she was a\r\nPortuguese ship, as I thought bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes.\r\nUpon which I strove for life to come up to them. But vain had it been,\r\nif through their perspective glasses they had not perceived me and\r\nshortened their sail to let me come up. Encouraged at this, I set up my\r\npatron's ancient, and fired a gun, both as signals of distress; upon\r\nwhich they very kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came up\r\nwith them. They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and French, but\r\nneither of these did I understand; till at length a Scots sailor called,\r\nand then I told him I was an Englishman, who had escaped from the Moors\r\nat Sallee: upon which they took me kindly on board, with all my effects.\r\n\r\nSurely none can express the inconceivable joy I felt at this happy\r\ndeliverance! who from being a late miserable and forlorn creature was\r\nnot only relieved, but in favour with the master of the ship, to whom,\r\nin return for my deliverance, I offered all I had. \"God forbid,\" said\r\nhe, \"that I should take any thing from you. Every thing shall be\r\ndelivered to you when you come to Brazil. If I have saved your life it\r\nis no more than I should expect to receive myself from any other, when\r\nin the same circumstances I should happen to meet the like deliverance.\r\nAnd should I take from you what you have, and leave you at Brazil, why,\r\nthis would be only taking away a life I had given. My charity teaches me\r\nbetter. Those effects you have will support you there, and provide you a\r\npassage home again.\" And, indeed, he acted with the strictest justice in\r\nwhat he did, taking my things into his possession, and giving me an\r\nexact inventory, even to my earthen jars. He bought my boat of me for\r\nthe ship's use, giving me a note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at\r\nBrazil; and if any body offered more, he would make it up. He also gave\r\nme 60 pieces for my boy Xury. It way with great reluctance I was\r\nprevailed upon to sell the child's liberty, who had served me so\r\nfaithfully; but the boy was willing himself; and it was agreed, that\r\nafter ten years he should be made free, upon his renouncing\r\nMahometanism, and embracing Christianity.\r\n\r\nHaving a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in the Bay de Todos\r\nlos Santos, or All Saints Bay, in twenty-two days after. And here I\r\ncannot forget the generous treatment of the captain. He would take\r\nnothing for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin,\r\nand thirty for the lion's. Every thing he caused to be delivered, and\r\nwhat I would sell he bought. In short I made about 220 pieces of my\r\ncargo; and with this stock I entered once more, as I may say into the\r\nscene of life.\r\n\r\nBeing recommended to an honest planter, I lived with him till such time\r\nas I was informed of the manner of their planting and making sugar; and\r\nseeing how well they lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, I was\r\nfilled with a desire to settle among them, and resolved to get my money\r\nremitted to me, and to purchase a plantation.\r\n\r\nTo be brief, I bought a settlement next door to an honest and kind\r\nneighbour, born at Lisbon, of English parents, whose plantation joining\r\nto mine, we improved it very amicably together. Both our stocks were\r\nlow, and for two years we planted only for food: but the third year we\r\nplanted some tobacco, and each of us dressed a large piece of ground the\r\nensuing year for planting canes. But now I found how much I wanted\r\nassistance, and repented the loss of my dear boy Xury.\r\n\r\nHaving none to assist me, my father's words came into my mind; and I\r\nused to ask myself, if what I sought was only a middle station of life,\r\nwhy could it not as well be obtained in England as here? When I pondered\r\non this with regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook me. I\r\nhad none to converse with but my neighbour; no work to be done but by my\r\nown hands; it often made me say, my condition was like to that of a man\r\ncast upon a desolate island. So unhappy are we in our reflections, so\r\nforgetful of what good things we receive ourselves, and so unthankful\r\nfor our deliverance from these calamities that others endure.\r\n\r\nI, was in some measure settled, before the captain who took me up\r\ndeparted from the Brazils. One day I went to him, and told him what\r\nstock I had in London, desiring his assistance in getting it remitted;\r\nto which the good gentleman readily consented, but would only have me\r\nsend for half my money, lest it should miscarry; which, if it did, I\r\nmight still have the remainder to support me: and so taking letters of\r\nprocuration of me, bid me trouble myself no farther about it.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me; for he not only\r\nprocured the money I had drawn for upon my captain's widow, but sent me\r\nover a servant with a cargo proportionable to my condition. He also sent\r\nme over tools of all sorts, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my\r\nplantation, which proved to be of the greatest use to me in my business.\r\n\r\nWealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon success crowning my\r\nprosperous labours, I might have rested happy in that middle state of\r\nlife my father had so often recommended, yet nothing would content me,\r\nsuch was my evil genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a\r\nfoolish ambition in rising; and thus, once more, I cast myself into the\r\ngreatest gulph of misery that ever poor creature fell into. Having lived\r\nfour years in Brazil, I had not only learned the language, but\r\ncontracted acquaintance with the most eminent planters, and even the\r\nmerchants of St. Salvadore; to whom, once, by way of discourse, having\r\ngiven account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea and the manner of\r\ntrading there for mere trifles, by which we furnish our plantations with\r\nNegroes, they gave such attention to what I said, that three of them\r\ncame one morning to me, and told me they had a secret proposal to make.\r\nAfter enjoining me to secrecy (it being an infringement on the powers of\r\nthe Kings of Portugal and Spain) they told me they had a mind to fit out\r\na ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plantation with Negroes,\r\nwhich as they could not be publicly sold, they would divide among them:\r\nand if I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading\r\npart, I should have ah equal share of the Negroes, without providing any\r\nstock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in another\r\ncondition. But I, born to be my own destroyer, could not resist the\r\nproposal, but accepted the offer upon condition of their looking after\r\nmy plantation. So making a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my\r\ngood friend the captain, as my universal heir; but obliged him to\r\ndispose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce to himself,\r\nand the other to be shipped to England.\r\n\r\nThe ship being fitted out, and all things ready, we set sail the first\r\nof September, 1659, being the same day eight-years I left my father and,\r\nmother in Yorkshire. We sailed northward upon the coast, in order to\r\ngain Africa, till we made Cape Augustine; from whence going farther into\r\nthe ocean, out of sight of land, we steered as though we were bound for\r\nthe isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the islands on the east; and then\r\nit was that we met with a terrible tempest, which continued for twelve\r\ndays successively, so that the wind carried us wheresoever they pleased.\r\nIn this perplexity one of our men died, and one man and a boy were\r\nwashed overboard. When the weather cleared up a little, we found\r\nourselves eleven degrees north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon\r\nthis the captain gave reasons for returning; which I opposed,\r\ncounselling him to stand away for Barbadoes, which as I supposed, might\r\nbe attained in fifteen days. So altering our course, we sailed\r\nnorth-west and by west, in order to reach the Leeward Islands; but a\r\nsecond storm succeeding, drove us to the westward; so that we were\r\njustly afraid of falling into the hands of cruel savages, or the paws of\r\ndevouring beasts of prey.\r\n\r\nIn this great distress, one of our men, early in the morning cried out,\r\n_Land, land!_ which he had no sooner cried out, but our ship struck upon\r\na sand bank, and in a moment the sea broke over her in such a manner\r\nthat we expected we should all have perished immediately. We knew\r\nnothing where we were, or upon what land we were driven; whether an\r\nisland or the main, inhabited or not inhabited; and we could not so much\r\nas hope that the ship would hold out many minutes, without breaking in\r\npieces, except the wind by a miracle should turn about immediately.\r\nWhile we stood looking at one another, expecting death every moment, the\r\nmate lay a hold of the boat, and with the help of the rest got her flung\r\nover the ship's side, and getting all into her, being eleven of us,\r\ncommitted ourselves to God's mercy and the wild sea. And now we saw that\r\nthis last effort would not be a sufficient protection from death; so\r\nhigh did the sea rise, that it was impossible the boat should live. As\r\nto making sail, we had none; neither if we had, could we make use of\r\nany. So that when we had rowed, or rather were driven about a league and\r\na half, a raging wave, like a lofty mountain, came rolling astern of us,\r\nand took us with such fury, that at once it overset the boat. Thus being\r\nswallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call upon the tremendous\r\nname of God; much less to implore, in dying ejaculations, his infinite\r\nmercy to receive our departing souls.\r\n\r\nMen are generally counted insensible, when struggling in the pangs of\r\ndeath; but while I was overwhelmed with water, I had the most dreadful\r\napprehensions imaginable. For the joys of heaven and the torments of\r\nhell, seemed to present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and\r\neven small space of time, as it were, between life and death. I was\r\ngoing I thought I knew not whither, into a dismal gulf unknown, and as\r\nyet unperceived, never to behold my friends, nor the light of this world\r\nany more! Could I even have thought of annihilation, or a total\r\ndissolution of soul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no\r\nfurther being, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an eternal\r\n_quietus_, without life or sense: even that, I say, would have been\r\nenough to strike me with horror and confusion! I strove, however, to the\r\nlast extremity, while all my companions were overpowered and entombed in\r\nthe deep: and it was with great difficulty I kept my breath till the\r\nwave spent itself, and retiring back, left me on the shore half dead\r\nwith the water I had taken in. As soon as I got on my feet, I ran as\r\nfast as I could, lest another wave should pursue me, and carry me back\r\nagain. But for all the haste I made, I could not avoid it: for the sea\r\ncame after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy; so that my\r\nbusiness was to hold my breath, and by raising myself on the water,\r\npreserve it by swimming. The next dreadful wave buried me at once twenty\r\nor thirty feet deep, but at the same time carried me with a mighty force\r\nand swiftness toward the shore: when raising myself, I held out as well\r\nas possible, till at length the water having spent itself, began to\r\nreturn, at which I struck forward, and feeling ground with my feet, I\r\ntook to my heels again. Thus being served twice more, I was at length\r\ndashed against a piece of a rock, in such a manner as left me senseless;\r\nbut recovering a little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt,\r\nwould then have overwhelmed me, I held fast by the rock till those\r\nsucceeding waves abated; and then fetching another run, was overtaken by\r\na small wave, which was soon conquered. But before any more could\r\novertake me, I reached the main land, where clambering up the cliffs of\r\nthe shore, tired and almost spent I sat down on the grass, free from the\r\ndangers of the foaming ocean.\r\n\r\nNo tongue can express the ecstasies and transports that my soul felt at\r\nthe happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve to a dying malefactor,\r\nwith a halter about his neck, and ready to be turned off. I was wrapt up\r\nin contemplation and often lifted up my hands, with the profoundest\r\nhumility, to the Divine Powers, for saving, my life, when the rest of my\r\ncompanions were all drowned. And now I began to cast my eyes around, to\r\nbehold what place I was in and what I had next to do. I could see no\r\nhouse nor people; I was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me; hungry and\r\nthirsty, yet had nothing to eat or drink; no weapon to destroy any\r\ncreature for my sustenance; nor defend myself against devouring beasts;\r\nin short, I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco pipe, and a box half\r\nfilled with tobacco. The darksome night coming on upon me, increased my\r\nfears of being devoured by wild creatures; my mind was plunged in\r\ndespair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life before me, I\r\nprepared for another kind of death then what I had lately escaped. I\r\nwalked about a furlong to see if I could find any fresh water, which I\r\ndid, to my great joy: and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I\r\ngot up into a thick bushy tree, and seating myself so that I could not\r\nfall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried my sorrows in\r\na quiet repose.\r\n\r\nIt was broad day the next morning before I awaked; when I not only\r\nperceived the tempest was ceased, but law the ship driven almost as far\r\nas the rock before-mentioned, which the waves had dashed me against, and\r\nwhich was about a mile from the place where I was. When I came down from\r\nmy apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles distant\r\non my right-hand, lying on shore, as the waves had cast her. I thought\r\nto have got to her; but there being an inlet of water of about half a\r\nmile's breadth between it and me, I returned again towards the ship, as\r\nhoping to find something for my more immediate subsistence. About noon,\r\nwhen the sea was calm, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of\r\nher, it was to my grief I perceived, that, if we had kept on board all\r\nour lives had been saved. These thoughts, and my solitude drew tears\r\nfrom my eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to get to the ship, I\r\nstripped and leapt into the water, when swimming round her, I was afraid\r\nI should not get any thing to lay hold of; but it was my good fortune to\r\nespy a small piece of rope hang down by the fore chains, so low that, by\r\nthe help of it, though with great difficulty, I got into the forecastle\r\nof the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal\r\nof water in her hold: her stern was lifted up against a bank, and her\r\nhead almost to the water. All her quarter and what was there, was free\r\nand dry. The provisions I found in good order, with which I crammed my\r\npockets, and losing no time, ate while I was doing other things: I also\r\nfound some rum, of which I took a hearty dram: and now I wanted for\r\nnothing except a boat, which indeed was all, to carry away what was\r\nneedful for me.\r\n\r\nNecessity occasions quickness of thought. We had several spare yards, a\r\nspare topmast or two, and two or three large spars of wood. With these I\r\nfell to work, and flung as many of them overboard as I could manage,\r\ntying every one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away.\r\nThis done, I went down to the ship's side, and tyed four of them fast\r\ntogether at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two or three short\r\npieces of plank upon them crosswise, I found it would bear me, but not\r\nany considerable weight. Upon which I went to work again, cutting a\r\nspare topmast into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great\r\ndeal of labour and pains. I then considered what I should load it with,\r\nit being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And this I soon thought\r\nof, first laying upon it all the planks and boards I could get; next I\r\nlowered down three of the seamen's chests, after I had filled them with\r\nbread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and\r\nsome European corn, what little the rats had spared: and for liquors, I\r\nfound several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were\r\nsome cordial waters, and four or five gallons of rack, which I stowed by\r\nthemselves. By this time the tide beginning to flow, I perceived my\r\ncoat, waistcoat, and shirt, swim away, which I had left on the shore; as\r\nfor my linen breeches and stockings, I swam with them to the ship; but I\r\nsoon found clothes enough, though I took no more than I wanted for the\r\npresent. My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with; and after a long\r\nsearch, I found out the carpenter's chest, which I got safe down on my\r\nraft. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and in the great cabin\r\nfound two good fowling pieces, two pistols, several powder horns filled,\r\na small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I likewise found three\r\nbarrels of powder, two of which were good, but the third had taken\r\nwater, also two or three broken oars, two saws, an ax, and a hammer. I\r\nthen put to sea, and in getting to shore had three encouragements. 1. A\r\nsmooth calm sea. 2. The tide rising and letting in to shore. 3. The\r\nlittle wind there was blew towards the land. After I had sailed about a\r\nmile, I found the raft to drive a little distance from the place where I\r\nfirst landed; and then I perceived a little opening of the land, with a\r\nstrong current of the tide running into it: upon which I kept the middle\r\nof the stream. But great was my concern, when on a sudden the fore part\r\nof my raft ran a ground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, for\r\nnear half an hour, kept my back straining against the chests to keep my\r\neffects in their places, all I had would have gone into the sea. But\r\nafter some time, the rising of the water caused the raft to float again,\r\nand coming up a little river with land on both sides, I landed in a\r\nlittle cove, as near the mouth as possible, the better to discover a\r\nsail, if any such providentially passed that way.\r\n\r\nNot far off, I espied a hill of stupendous height, surounded with lesser\r\nhills about it, and thither I was resolved to go and view the country\r\nthat I might see what part was best, to fix my habitation. Accordingly,\r\narming myself with a pistol a fowling piece, powder and ball, I ascended\r\nthe mountain. There I perceived I was in an island, encompassed by the\r\nsea; no distant lands to be seen but scattering rocks that lay to the\r\nwest: that it seemed to be a barren place, and, as I thought, inhabited\r\nonly by wild beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant of\r\nwhat kind, or whether good for nourishment; I shot one of them at my\r\nreturn, which occasioned a confused screaming among the other birds, and\r\nI found it, by its colours and beak, to be a kind of a hawk, but its\r\nflesh was perfect carrion.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my raft, I brought my effects on shore, which work spent\r\nthat day entirely; and fearing that some cruel beasts might devour me in\r\nthe night time while I slept, I made a kind of hut or barricade with the\r\nchests and boards I had brought onshore. That night I slept very\r\ncomfortably; and the next morning my thoughts were employed to make a\r\nfurther attempt on the ship, and bring away what necessaries I could\r\nfind, before another storm should break her to pieces. Accordingly I got\r\non board as before, and prepared a second raft far more nice then the\r\nfirst, upon which I brought away the carpenter's stores, two or three\r\nbags full of nails, a great jack-screw, a dozen or two of hatchets, and\r\na grind-stone. I also took away several things that belonged to the\r\ngunner, particularly two or three iron crows, two barels of\r\nmusket-bullets, another fowling-piece, a small quantity of powder, and a\r\nlarge bagful of small shot. Besides these, I took all the men's clothes\r\nI could find, a spare fore topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and\r\nthus completing my second cargo, I made all the haste to shore I could,\r\nfearing some wild beast might destroy what I had there already. But I\r\nonly found a little wild cat sitting on one of the chests, which seeming\r\nnot to fear me or the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece\r\nof biscuit, which she instantly ate, and departed.\r\n\r\nWhen I had gotten these effects on shore, I went to work in order to\r\nmake me a little tent with the sail and some poles which I had cut for\r\nthat purpose; and having finished it, what things might be damaged by\r\nthe weather I brought in, piling all the empty chests and calks in a\r\ncircle, the better to fortify it against any sudden attempt of man or\r\nbeast. After this, I blocked up the doors with some boards, and an empty\r\nchest, turned the long way out. I then charged my gun and pistol, and\r\nlaying my bed on the ground, slept as comfortably, till next morning, as\r\nthough I had been in a christian country.\r\n\r\nNow, though I had enough to subsist me a long time, yet despairing of a\r\nsudden deliverance, or that both ammunition and provision might be spent\r\nbefore such a thing happened, I coveted as much as I could; and so long\r\nas the ship remained in that condition, I daily brought away one\r\nnecessary or other; particularly the rigging, sails, and cordage, some\r\ntwine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of meal, 3 calks of\r\nrum, &, what indeed was most welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread.\r\n\r\nThe next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried off a hawser\r\nwhole, with a great deal of iron work, and made another raft with the\r\nmizen and sprit-sail-yard; but this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy\r\nburden I had upon it, and not being able so dextrously to guide it, as\r\nthe former, both my cargo and I were overturned. For my part, all the\r\ndamage I sustained was a wet skin; and, at low water, after much labour\r\nin diving, I got most of the cables, and some pieces of iron.\r\n\r\nThirteen days I had now been in the island, and eleven times on board,\r\nbringing away all that was possible, and, I believe, had the weather\r\nbeen calm, I should have brought away the whole ship piece by piece. As\r\nI was going the twelfth time, the wind began to rise; however, I\r\nventured at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found\r\nseveral razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives and forks; and in\r\nanother thirty-six pounds in pieces of eight, silver and gold. _Ah!\r\nsimple vanity_ said I _whom this world so much dotes on, where is now\r\nthy virtue, thy excellency to me? You cannot procure me one thing\r\nneedful, nor remove me from this desolate island to a place of plenty.\r\nOne of these knives, so meanly esteemed, is to me more preferable than\r\nall this heap. E'en therefore remain where thou art to sink in the deep\r\nas unregarded, even as a creature whose life is not worth preserving._\r\nYet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it up in a piece of canvas,\r\nand began to think of making another raft, but I soon perceived the wind\r\nbegan to arise, a fresh gale blowing from the shore, and the sky\r\novercast with clouds and darkness; so thinking a a raft to be in yaw, I\r\nlet myself into the water with what things I had about me, and it was\r\nwith much difficulty I got ashore, when soon after it blew a\r\nfearful storm.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, surrounded with\r\nall my effects; but when I looked out in the morning no more ship was to\r\nbe seen. This much surprised me for the present; yet, when I considered\r\nI had lost no time, abated no pains and had got every thing useful out\r\nof her, I comforted myself in the best manner, and entirely submitted to\r\nthe will of Providence.\r\n\r\nMy next thoughts were, how I should defend and secure myself from\r\nsavages and wild beasts, if any such were in the island. At one time I\r\nthought of digging a cave, at another I was for erecting a tent; and, at\r\nlength, I resolved to do both: The manner or form of which will not, I\r\nhope, be unpleasing to describe.\r\n\r\nWhen I considered the ground where I was, that it was moorish, and had\r\nno fresh water near it, my resolutions were to search for a soil healthy\r\nand well watered, where I might not only be sheltered from the sun's\r\nscorching heat, but be more conveniently situated, as well to be secured\r\nfrom wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to discover any distant\r\nsail, should it ever happen.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, it was not long before I had my desire. I found a little\r\nplain near a rising hill, the front towards which being as steep as a\r\nhouse side, nothing could descend on me from the top. On the side of\r\nthis rock, was a little hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of\r\na cave. Just before this place; on the circle of the green, I resolved\r\nmy tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed a hundred yards\r\nbroad, and about twice as long, like a delightful green, before my door,\r\nwith a pleasing, though an irregular descent every way to the low\r\ngrounds by the sea-side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill, so that it\r\nwas sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I drew a\r\nsemi-circle, containing ten yards in a semi-diameter, and twenty yards\r\nin the whole, driving down two rows; of strong stakes, not 6 inches from\r\neach other. Then with the pieces of cable which I had cut on board, I\r\nregularly laid them in a circle between the piles up to their tops,\r\nwhich were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove another\r\nrow of piles looking within side against them, between two or three feet\r\nhigh, which made me conclude it a little impregnable castle against men\r\nand beasts. And for my better security I would have no door, but entered\r\nin and came out by the help of a ladder, which I also made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robinson Crusoe building his castle. _Dr. & Eng. by A.\r\nCarse, Edin._]\r\n\r\nHere was my fence and fortress, into which I carried all my riches,\r\nammunition, and stores. After which, working on the rock, what with dirt\r\nand stones I dug out, I not only raised my ground two feet, but made a\r\nlittle cellar to my mansion-house; and this cost me many days labour and\r\npains. One day in particular a shower of rain falling, thunder and\r\nlighting ensued, which put me in terror lest my powder should take fire,\r\nand not only hinder my necessary subsistence, by killing me food, but\r\neven blow up me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell to making\r\nboxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near 150lb.\r\nweight. And thus being established as king of the island, every day I\r\nwent out with my gun to see what I could kill that was fit to eat. I\r\nsoon perceived numbers of goats but very shy, yet having watched them\r\nnarrowly, and seeing I could better shoot off the rocks than when in the\r\nlow grounds, I happened to shoot a she-goat suckling a young kid; which\r\nnot thinking its dam slain, stood by her unconcerned; and when I took\r\nthe dead creature up, the young one followed me even to the inclosure. I\r\nlifted the kid over the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive;\r\nbut finding it could not be brought to eat, I was forced to slay it also\r\nfor my subsistence.\r\n\r\nThus entered into as strange a scene of life as ever any man was in, I\r\nhad most melancholy apprehensions concerning my deplorable condition:\r\nand many times the tears would plentifully run down my face, when I\r\nconsidered how I was debarred from all communications with human kind.\r\nYet while these disponding cogitations would seem to make me accuse\r\nProvidence, other good thoughts would interpose and reprove me after\r\nthis manner: Well, supposing you are desolate, it is not better to be so\r\nthan totally perish? Why, were you singled out to be saved and the rest\r\ndestroyed? Why should you complain, when not only your life is\r\npreserved, but the ship driven into your reach, in order to take what\r\nwas necessary out of her for your subsistence? But to proceed, it was,\r\nby the account I kept, the 30th of September, when I first landed on\r\nthis island. About twelve days after, fearing lest I should lose my\r\nreckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for want of pen,\r\nink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a large post, in great\r\nletters; and set it up: in the similitude of a cross, on the seashore\r\nwhere I landed, I CAME ON SHORE, _Sept._ 30 1659. Every day I cut a\r\nnotch with my knife on the sides of the square post, and this on the\r\nSabbath was as long again as the rest; and every first day of the month\r\nas long again as that long one. In this manner I kept my calendar,\r\nweekly, monthly or yearly reckoning of time. But had I made a more\r\nstrict search (as afterwards I did) I needed not have set up this mark;\r\nfor among the parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's\r\nmate, I found those very things I wanted; particularly pens, ink, and\r\npaper. So I found two or three compasses, some mathematical\r\ninstruments, dials, perspective glasses, books of navigation, three\r\nEnglish Bibles, and several other good books, which I carefully put\r\nup.--Here I cannot but call to mind our having a dog and two cats on\r\nboard, whom I made inhabitants with me in my castle. Though one might\r\nthink I had all the necessities that were desirable, yet still I found\r\nseveral things wanting. My ink was daily wasting; I wanted needles,\r\npins, and thread to mend or keep my clothes together; and particularly a\r\nspade, pickax, or shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year before I\r\nfinished my little bulwark; and having some intervals of relaxation,\r\nafter my daily wandering abroad for provision, I drew up this plan,\r\nalternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me of the miseries and\r\nblessings of my life, under so many various circumstances.\r\n\r\nE V I L\r\n\r\nI am cast upon a desolate island, having no hopes, no prospects of a\r\nwelcome deliverance.\r\n\r\nThus miserably am I singled out from the enjoyment or company of all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nLike an hermit (rather should I say a lonely anchorite) am I forced from\r\nhuman conversation.\r\n\r\nMy clothes after some time will be worn out; and then I shall have none\r\nto cover me.\r\n\r\nWhen my ammunition is wasted, then shall I remain without any defence\r\nagainst wild men and beasts.\r\n\r\nI have no creature, no soul to speak to; none to beg assistance from.\r\nSome comfort would it be to resound my woes where I am understood, and\r\nbeg assistance where I might hope for relief.\r\n\r\nGOOD\r\n\r\nBut yet I am preserved, while my companions are perished in the raging\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nYet set apart to be spared from death. And he, who has so preserved me,\r\ncan deliver me from this condition.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have food to eat, and even a happy prospect of subsistence\r\nwhile life endures.\r\n\r\nAt present I enjoy what is absolutely needful; and the climate is so\r\nhot, that had I never so many, I would hardly wear them.\r\n\r\nYet if it does, I see no danger of any hurt to me, as in Africa; And\r\nwhat if I had been cast away, upon that coast.\r\n\r\nIs there not God to converse to, and is not he able to relieve thee?\r\nAlready has he afforded thee sustenance, and put it in thy power to\r\nprovide for thyself till he sends thee a deliverance.\r\n\r\nAnd now easing my mind a little by these reflections, I began to render\r\nmy life as easy as possible.\r\n\r\nI must here add, to the description I have given of my habitation, that\r\nhaving raised a turf wall against the outside of it, I thatched it so\r\nclose as might keep it from the inclemency of the weather; I also\r\nimproved it within, enlarged my cave, and made a passage and door in the\r\nrock, which came out beyond the pale of my fortification. I next\r\nproceeded to make a chair and a table, and so began to study such\r\nmechanical arts as seemed to me practicable. When I wanted a plank or\r\nboard I hewed down a tree with my hatchet, making it as thin with my ax\r\nas possible, and then smooth enough with an adz to answer my designs:\r\nyet though I could make no more this way than one board out of a tree,\r\nin length of time I got boards enough to shelter all my stores, every\r\nthing being regularly placed, and my guns securely hanging against the\r\nside of the rock. This made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the\r\nresult of vast labour and diligence; which leaving for a while, and me\r\nto the enjoyment of it, I shall give the reader an account of my Journal\r\nfrom the day of my landing, till the fixing and settling of my\r\nhabitation, as heretofore shown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n_September 30, 1659_. I unhappy Robinson Crusoe, having suffered\r\nshipwreck, was driven on this desolate island, which I named the\r\n_Desolate Island of Despair_, my companions being swallowed up in the\r\ntempestous ocean. The next day I spent in consideration of my unhappy\r\ncircumstances, having no prospect but of death, either to be starved\r\nwith hunger, or devoured with beasts or merciless savages.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 1_. That morning, with great comfort, I beheld the ship drove\r\nashore. Some hopes I had, that when the storm was abated I might be able\r\nto get some food and necessaries out of her, which I conceived were not\r\ndamaged, because the ship did stand upright. At this time I lamented the\r\nloss of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the vessel. When I\r\nperceived the ship as it were lay dry, I waded through the sands, then\r\nswam aboard, the weather being very rainy, and with scarcely any wind.\r\n\r\nTo the 14th of this month, my time was employed in making voyages, every\r\ntide getting what I could out of the ship. The weather very wet and\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 20_. My raft and all the goods thereon were overset: yet I\r\nrecovered most again at low water.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 25_. It blew hard, and rained night and day, when the ship went in\r\npieces, so that nothing was seen of her but the wreck at low water. This\r\nday I secured my goods from the inclemency of the weather.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 26_. I wandered to see where I could find a place convenient for\r\nmy abode. I fixed upon a rock in the evening, marked out a half-moon,\r\nintending to erect a wall, fortified with piles, lined within with\r\npieces of cables, and covered with turf.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 1_. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up my lodgings very\r\ncontentedly in a hammock that night.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber, chests, and boards.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 3. I shot two wild fowl, resembling ducks, which were good to\r\neat, and in the afternoon made me a table.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 4. I began to live regularly. In the morning I allowed myself two\r\nor three hours to walk out with my gun; I then worked till near eleven\r\no'clock, and afterwards refreshed myself, with what I had to eat. From\r\ntwelve to two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sultry weather. In\r\nthe evening go to work again.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 5. Went out with my gun and dog, shot a wild cat with a soft skin,\r\nbut her flesh was good for nothing. The skins of those I killed, I\r\npreserved. In my return, I perceived many wild birds, and was terrified\r\nby some seals which made off to sea.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 6. Completed my table.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but omitted the 11th,\r\nwhich, according to my calculation, I supposed to be Sunday.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 13. Rain in abundance, which, however, much cooled the air; with\r\nthunder and lightening, caused in me a terrible surprise. The weather\r\nclearing, I secured my powder in separate parcels.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 14--16. I made little boxes for my powder, lodging them in\r\nseveral places. I also shot a large fowl, which proved excellent meat.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged to desist for\r\nwant of a pickax, shovel, and wheel-barrow. Iron crows I caused to\r\nsupply the place of the first; but with all my art I could not make a\r\nwheel-barrow.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 18. It was my fortune to find a tree, resembling what Brazilians\r\ncall an iron tree. I had like to have spoiled my ax with cutting it,\r\nbeing very hard and exceedingly heavy; yet with much labour & industry,\r\nI made a sort of a spade out of it.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 21. These tools being made, I daily carried on my business;\r\neighteen days I allowed for enlarging my cave, that it might serve me,\r\nnot only for a warehouse, but kitchen, parlour, and cellar. I commonly\r\nlay in the tent, unless the weather was rainy that I could not lie dry.\r\nSo wet would it be at certain seasons, that I was obliged to cover all\r\nwithin the pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against\r\nthe rock, and loaded them with flags and large leaves of trees,\r\nresembling a thatch.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 10. No sooner did I think my habitation finished, but suddenly a\r\ngreat deal of the top broke in, so that it was a mercy I was not buried\r\nin the ruins. This occasioned a great deal of pains and trouble to me,\r\nbefore I could make it firm and durable.\r\n\r\n_Dec_ 17. I nailed up some shelves and drove nails and staples in the\r\nwall and posts to hang things out of the way.\r\n\r\n_Dec_ 20. Every thing I got into its place, then made a sort of a\r\ndresser, and another table.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 24. 25. Rain in abundance.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 26. Very fair weather.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 27. I chanced to light on some goats, shot one and wounded\r\nanother. I led it home in a string, bound up its leg, and cured it in a\r\nlittle time; at length it became so tame and familiar as to feed before\r\nthe door, and follow me where I pleased. This put me in mind to bring up\r\ntame creatures, in order to supply me with food after my ammunition\r\nwas spent.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 28, 29, 30. The weather being excessively hot, with little air,\r\nobliged me for the most part, to keep within doors.\r\n\r\n_Jan_ 1. Still sultry, however, obliged by necessity, I went out with my\r\ngun, and found a great store of goats in the valleys; they were\r\nexceedingly shy, nor could my dog hunt them down.\r\n\r\n_Jan._ 3 to 14. My employment this time was to finish the wall before\r\ndescribed, and search the island. I discovered a kind of pigeons like\r\nour house-pigeons in a nest among the rocks. I brought them home, nursed\r\nthem till they could fly, and then they left me. After this, I shot\r\nsome, which proved excellent food. Some time I spent vainly in\r\ncontriving to make a cask; I may well say it was vain, because I could\r\nneither joint the staves; nor fix the heads, so as to make it tight: So,\r\nleaving that, took some goat's tallow I had about me, and a little okum\r\nfor the wick, and provided myself with a lamp, which served me instead\r\nof candles.\r\n\r\nBut now a very strange event happened. For being in the height of my\r\nsearch, what should come into my hand, but a bag, which was used to hold\r\ncorn (as I supposed) for the fowls; so immediately resolving to put\r\ngunpowder in it, I shook all the hulks and dirt upon one side of the\r\nrock, little expecting what the consequences would be. The rain had\r\nfallen plentifully a few days before; and about a month after, to my\r\ngreat amazement something began to lock out very green and flourishing;\r\nand when I came to view it more nicely, every day as it grew, I found\r\nabout ten or twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very same shape\r\nand make as that in England.\r\n\r\nI can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this sight. Hitherto I\r\nhad looked upon the actions of this life no otherwise than only as the\r\nevents of blind chance and fortune. But now the appearance of this\r\nbarley, flourishing in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving\r\nhow it should come there, made me conclude _that miracles were not yet\r\nceased:_ nay, I even thought that God had appointed it to grow there\r\nwithout any seed, purely for my sustenance in this miserable and\r\ndesolate island. And indeed such great effect this had upon me, that it\r\noften made me melt into tears, through a grateful sense of God's\r\nmercies; and the greater still was my thankfulness, when I perceived\r\nabout this little field of barley some rice stalks, also wonderfully\r\nflourishing.\r\n\r\nWhile thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be more corn in the\r\nisland; and therefore made a diligent search narrowly among the rocks;\r\nbut not being able to find any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I\r\nhad shaken the husks of corn out of the bag, and then my admiration\r\nceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, _as thinking it was but\r\nnatural_, and not to be conceived a miracle; though even the manner of\r\nits preservation might have made me own it as a wonderful event of God's\r\nkind providence.\r\n\r\nIt was about the latter end of June when the ears of this corn ripened,\r\nwhich I laid up very carefully together with 20 or 30 stalks of rice,\r\nexpecting one day I should reap the fruit of my labour; yet four years\r\nwere expired before I could allow myself to eat any barley-bread, and\r\nmuch longer time before I had any rice. After this, with indefatigable\r\npains and industry for three or four months, at last I finished my wall\r\non the 14th, of April, having no way to go into it, but by ladder\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\n_April_ 16. I finished my ladder, and ascended it; afterwards pulled it\r\nup, then let it down on the other side, and descended into my new\r\nhabitation, where I had space enough, and so fortified that nothing\r\ncould attack me, without scaling the walls.\r\n\r\nBut what does all human pains and industry avail, if the blessing of God\r\ndoes not crown our labours? Or who can stand before the Almighty, when\r\nhe stretcheth forth his arm? For one time as I was at the entrance of my\r\ncave, there happened such a dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof\r\nof the cave came rumbling about my ears, but the posts seemed to crack\r\nterribly at the same time. This put me in great amazement; and running\r\nto the ladder, and getting over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an\r\nearthquake, the place I stood on sustaining three terrible shocks in\r\nless than three minutes. But judge of my terror when I saw the top of a\r\ngreat rock roll into the sea; I then expected the island would be\r\nswallowed up every moment: And what made the scene still more dreadful,\r\nwas to see the sea thrown into the most violent agitations and disorders\r\nby this tremendous accident.\r\n\r\nFor my part I stood like a criminal at the place of execution ready to\r\nexpire. At the moving of the earth, I was, as it were, sea-sick; and\r\nvery much afraid lest the rock, under which was my fence and habitation,\r\nshould overwhelm it and myself in a lasting tomb.\r\n\r\nWhen the third dreadful shock had spent itself, my spirits began to\r\nrevive; yet still I would not venture to ascend the ladder, but\r\ncontinued fitting, not knowing what I should do. So little grace had I\r\nthen, as only to say _Lord have mercy upon me!_ and no sooner was the\r\nearthquake over, but that pathetic prayer left me.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after, when a horrible tempest arose, at the same time\r\nattended with a huricane of wind. The sea seemed mountains high, and the\r\nwaves rolled so impetously, that nothing could be perceived but froth\r\nand foam. Three hours did this storm continue, and in so violent a\r\nmanner, as to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was succeeded\r\nby abundance of rain. When the tempest was over I went to my tent: but\r\nthe rain coming on in a furious manner, I was obliged to take shelter in\r\nthe cave, where I was forced to cut a channel through my fortification\r\nto let the water out. It continued raining all that night, and some time\r\nthe next day. These accidents made me resolve, as soon as the weather\r\ncleared up, to build me a little hut in some open place, walled round to\r\ndefend me from wild creatures and savages; not doubting but at the next\r\nearthquake, the mountain would fall upon my habitation and me, and\r\nswallow up all in its bowels.\r\n\r\n_April_ 16--20. These days I spent in contriving how and in what manner\r\nI should fix my place of abode. All this while I was under the most\r\ndreadful apprehensions. When I looked round my habitation, every thing I\r\nfound in its proper place. I had several resolutions whether I should\r\nmove or not; but at length resolved to stay where I was, till I found\r\nout a convenient place where I might pitch my tent.\r\n\r\n_April_ 22. When I began to put my resolutions in practice, I was stopt\r\nfor want of tools and instruments to work with. Most of my axes and\r\nhatchets were useless, occasioned by cutting the hard timber that grew\r\non the island. It took me up a full week to make my grind-stone of use\r\nto me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about with my foot, by\r\nhelp of a wheel and a string.\r\n\r\n_April_ 28--29. These days were spent in grinding my tools.\r\n\r\n_April_ 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but one biscuit a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_May_ 1. As I walked along the sea shore I found a barrel of gunpowder,\r\nand several pieces of the wreck, the sea had flung up. Having secured\r\nthose, I made to the ship, whose stern was torn off, and washed a great\r\ndistance ashore; but the rest lay in the sands. This I suppose was\r\noccasioned by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my old place of\r\nabode; and also to go to the ship that day, but then found it\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n_May_ 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw sawed off one of the\r\nbeams, which kept her quarter-deck. I then cleared the sand till flood.\r\n\r\n_May_ 4. I caught some fish, but they were not wholesome, The same day I\r\nalso catched a young dolphin.\r\n\r\n_May 5._ 'This day I also repaired to the wreck, and sawed another\r\npiece of timber, and when the flood came, I made a float of three great\r\nplanks, which were driven ashore by the tide.\r\n\r\n_May 6, 7, 8, 9._ These days I brought off the iron bolts, opened the\r\ndeck with the iron crow, and carried two planks to land, having made a\r\nway into the very middle of the wreck.\r\n\r\n_May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14._ All this time I spent in bringing off great\r\nquantities of iron and timber.\r\n\r\n_May 15._ Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut off some lead from\r\nthe roll, but all in vain, for it lay too low under water.\r\n\r\n_May 16._ I omitted going to the wreck this day, for employing myself in\r\nlooking for pigeons, I outstaid my time.\r\n\r\n_May 17._ I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven ashore, which I\r\nfound belonged to the head of the ship.\r\n\r\n_May 24._ To this day I worked on the wreck, and with great difficulty\r\nloosened some things so much with the crow, that at the first flowing\r\ntide several casks floated out, and many of the seamen's chests, yet\r\nthat day nothing came to land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which\r\nhad some Brazil pork in it. I continued working to the 15th of June;\r\n(except necessary times for food and rest) and had I known how to have\r\nbuilt a boat, I had timber and planks enough; I had also near 100 weight\r\nof sheet lead.\r\n\r\n_June 16._ As I was wandering towards the sea-side, I found a large\r\ntortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen on the island, though, as\r\nI afterwards found, there were many on the other side of it.\r\n\r\n_June 17._ This day I spent in cooking it, found in her threescore eggs,\r\nand her flesh the most savoury and pleasant I ever tasted in my life.\r\n\r\n_June 18._ I staid within this day, there being a continual rain; and it\r\nwas somewhat more chilly and cold than usual.\r\n\r\n_June 19._ Exceedingly bad, being taken with a trembling and shivering.\r\n\r\n_June 20._ Awake all night, my head racked with pain and feverish.\r\n\r\n_June 21._ Sick unto death, and terrified with the dismal apprehensions\r\nof my condition. Prayed to God more frequently, but very confusedly.\r\n\r\n_June 22._ Something better, but still uneasy in my mind.\r\n\r\n_June 23._ Again relapsed much as before.\r\n\r\n_June 24._ Mended a second time.\r\n\r\n_June 25._ A violent ague for seven hours, cold and hot fits succeeded\r\nwith faint sweats.\r\n\r\n_June 26._ Better, but very weak, yet I scrambled out, shot a she-goat,\r\nbrought it home and broiled some of it; I would willingly have stewed\r\nit, and made some broth, but had no pod.\r\n\r\n_June 27_ All this day I was afflicted with an ague; thirsty, yet I\r\ncould not help myself to water: Prayed to God in these words: _Lord, in\r\npity look upon me: Lord, have mercy upon me: have mercy upon me!_ After\r\nthis I fell asleep, which I found had much refreshed me when I awaked. I\r\nfell fast asleep a second time, and fell into this strange and terrible\r\nsort of dream.\r\n\r\nMethought I was sitting on the same spot of ground at the outside of the\r\nwall where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake; and that I\r\nsaw a man descending from a great black cloud, and alight upon the\r\nground. He was all over as bright as a flash of fire that a little\r\nbefore surrounded him; his countenance inconceivably terrible; the earth\r\nas it were trembled when he stept upon the ground, and flashes of fire\r\nseemed to fill all the air. No sooner I thought him landed upon the\r\nearth, but with a long spear, or other weapon, he made towards me; but\r\nfirst ascending a rising ground, his voice added to my amazement, when I\r\nthought I heard him pronounce these dreadful words, _Unhappy wretch!\r\nseeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance, thou shalt\r\nimmediately die._ In pronouncing this dreadful sentence, I thought he\r\nwent to kill me with the spear that was in his hand.\r\n\r\nAny body may think it impossible for me to express the horrors of my\r\nmind at this vision: and even when I awaked, this very dream made a deep\r\nimpression upon my mind. The little divine knowledge I had, I received\r\nfrom my father's instructions, and that was worn out by an uninterrupted\r\nseries of sea-faring impiety for eight years space. Except what sickness\r\nforced from me, I do not remember I had one thought of lifting up my\r\nheart towards God, but rather had a certain stupidity of soul, not\r\nhaving the least sense or fear of the Omnipotent Being when in distress,\r\nnor of gratitude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when I was on the\r\ndesperate expedition on the desert African shore, I cannot remember I\r\nhad one thought of what would become of me, or to beg his consolation\r\nand assistance in my sufferings and distress. When the Portugal captain\r\ntook me up and honorably used me, nay, farther, when I was even\r\ndelivered from drowning by escaping to this island, I never looked upon\r\nit as a judgment, but only said I was an unfortunate dog, and that's\r\nall. Indeed some secret transports of soul I had, which was not through\r\ngrace but only a common flight of joy, that I was yet alive, when my\r\ncompanions were all drowned, and no other joy could I conceive but what\r\nis common with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they have escaped\r\nthe greatest dangers.\r\n\r\nThe likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveniences, might have\r\ncalled upon me for a thankful acknowledgment to Providence. Indeed, the\r\ngrowth of my corn touched with some sense, but that soon wore off again.\r\nThe terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were, the finger of God,\r\nbut my dreadful amazement continued no longer than its duration. But\r\nnow, when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong\r\ndistemper, and I could leisurely view the miseries of death present\r\nthemselves before my eyes, then my awakened conscience began to reproach\r\nme with my past life, in which I had so wickedly provoked the justice of\r\nGod to pour down his vengeance upon me.\r\n\r\nSuch reflections as these oppressed me even in the violence of\r\ndistemper. Some prayers I uttered, which only proceeded from the fear of\r\ndeath. But when I considered my father's advice and prophecy, I could\r\nnot forbear weeping; for he told me, _That if I did persist in my folly,\r\nI should not only be deprived of God's blessing, but have time enough to\r\nreflect upon my despising his instructions, and this, in a wretched\r\ntime, when none could help me_. And now concluding it to be fulfilled,\r\nhaving no soul in the island to administer any comfort to me, I prayed\r\nearnestly to the Lord, that he would help me in this great calamity. And\r\nthis, I think, was the first time I prayed in sincerity for many years.\r\nBut now I must return to my journal.\r\n\r\n_June_ 28. Something refreshed with sleep, and the fit quite off, I got\r\nup. My dream still occasioned in me a great consternation; and, fearing\r\nthat the ague might return the succeeding day, I concluded it time to\r\nget something to comfort me. I filled a case bottle with water, and set\r\nit within reach of my bed; and, to make it more nourishing and less\r\nchilly, I put some rum in it. The next thing I did was to broil me a\r\npiece of goat's flesh, of which I ate but little. I was very weak;\r\nhowever, walked about, dreading the return of my distemper; and at night\r\nI supped on three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate, begging\r\nGod's blessing therewith.\r\n\r\nAfter I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of doors with my gun;\r\nbut was so weak, that I sat down, and looked at the sea, which was\r\nsmooth and calm. While I continued here, these thoughts came into\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\nIn what manner is the production of the earth and sea, of which I have\r\nseen so much? From whence came myself, and all other creatures living,\r\nand of what are they made?\r\n\r\nOur beings were assuredly created by some almighty invisible Power, who\r\nframed the earth the sea, and air, and all therein. But what is\r\nthat Power?\r\n\r\nCertainly it must follow that God has created it all. Yet, said I, if\r\nGod has made all this he must be the Ruler of them all, and what is\r\nrelating thereto; for certainly the Power that makes, must indisputably\r\nhave a power to guide and direct them. And if this be so, (as certainly\r\nit must) nothing can happen without his knowledge and appointment. Then,\r\nsurely, if nothing happens without God's appointment, certainly God has\r\nappointed these my sufferings to befal me. And here I fixed my firm\r\nbelief that it was his will that it should be so; and then proceeded to\r\nenquire, why should God deal with me in this manner? Or what have I done\r\nthus to deserve his indignation.\r\n\r\nHere conscience flew in my face, reprehending me as a blasphemer; crying\r\nwith a loud and piercing voice, _Unworthy wretch! how dare you ask what\r\nyou have done? Look on your past life, and see what you have left\r\nundone? Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the merciless hands\r\nof death? Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads, or killed in the fight,\r\nwhen the ship was taken by the Sallee man of war? Why not entombed in\r\nthe bowels of wild beasts on the African coast, or drowned here when all\r\nthy companions suffered shipwreck in the ocean._\r\n\r\nStruck dumb with these reflections, I rose up in a pensive manner, being\r\nso thoughtful that I could not go to sleep; and fearing the dreadful\r\nreturn of my distemper, it caused me to remember, that the Brazilians\r\nuse tobacco for almost all diseases. I then went to my chest in older to\r\nfind some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a cure for both\r\nsoul and body; for there I found one of the Bibles, which, till this\r\ntime, I had neither leisure nor inclination to look into, I took both\r\nthe tobacco and that out of the chest, and laid them on the table.\r\nSeveral experiments did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece or\r\nleaf, and chewed it; but it being very green and strong, almost\r\nstupified me. Next I steeped it in some rum an hour or two, resolving\r\nwhen I went to bed to take a dole of it: and, in the third place, I\r\nburnt some over a pan of fire, holding my nose over it as long as I\r\ncould endure it without suffocation.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of this operation, though my head was giddy and\r\ndisturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to read. No sooner did I\r\nopen it, but there appeared to me these words _Call on me in the day of\r\ntrouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me_.\r\n\r\nAt first this sentence made a very deep impression on my heart, but it\r\nsoon wore off again, when I considered the word _deliver_ was foreign to\r\nme. And as the children of Israel said, when they were promised flesh to\r\neat, _Can God spread a table in the wilderness?_ in like manner I began\r\nto say, _Can God himself deliver me from this desolate island?_ However,\r\nthe words would still return to my mind, and afterwards made a greater\r\nimpression upon me. As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dazed\r\nmy head, I was inclined to sleep: but before I would lie down I fell on\r\nmy knees, and implored the promise that God had made to me in the Holy\r\nScriptures, that _if I called upon him in the day of trouble he would\r\ndeliver me._ With much difficulty I afterwards drank the rum wherein I\r\nhad steeped the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me into such a\r\nprofound sleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before I awaked;\r\nor rather, I believe, I slept two days, having certainly lost a day in\r\nmy account, and I could never tell any other way. When I got up, my\r\nspirits were lively and cheerful; my stomach much better, being very\r\nhungry; and, in short, no fit returned the next day, which was the 29th,\r\nbut I found myself much altered for the better.\r\n\r\nThe 30th, I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and killed a sea-fowl\r\nor two, resembling a brand goose, which, however, I cared not to eat\r\nwhen I brought them home, but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. In\r\nthe evening I renewed my medicine, excepting that I did not take so\r\nlarge a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my head over the\r\nsmoke: but the next day, which was the 1st of _July_, having a little\r\nreturn of the cold fit, I again took my medicine as I did the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n_July_ 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this condition, I\r\noften thought of these words, _I will deliver thee_; and while, at some\r\ntimes, I would think of the impossibility of it, other thoughts would\r\nreprehend me for disregarding the deliverances I had received, even from\r\nthe most forlorn and distressed condition. I asked myself, what regard\r\nhave I had to God for his abundant mercies? Have I done my part_: He has\r\ndelivered me, but I have not glorified him:_--as if I had said, I had\r\nnot owned and been thankful for these as deliverances, and how could I\r\nexpect greater? So much did this sensibly touch my heart, that I gave\r\nGod thanks for my recovery from weakness in the most humble prostration.\r\n\r\n_July_ 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on what is written in\r\nthe New Testament, resolving to read a chapter every morning and night\r\nas long an my thoughts would engage me. As soon as I set about this work\r\nseriously, I found my heart deeply affected with the impiety of my past\r\nlife; these words that I thought were spoken to me in my dream revived,\r\n_All these things have not brought thee to repentance._ After this, I\r\nbegged of God to assist me with his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty.\r\nOne day in perusing the Scriptures, I came to these words, _He is\r\nexalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give\r\nremission_: Immediately I laid down the book, and with uplifted hands to\r\nHeaven, loudly cried, _O blessed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou\r\nexalted Prince and Saviour, give we repentance!_ And now indeed I prayed\r\nwith a true sense of my condition, and a more certain hope, founded on\r\nthe word of God. Now I had a different sense of these words, _Call on me\r\nand I will deliver thee_, that is from the dreadful load of guilt which\r\noppressed my sinful soul, and not from a solitary life, which might\r\nrather be called, a blessing, seeing I wanted neither food nor raiment,\r\nwhen compared living amongst the human race, surrounded with so much\r\noppression, misery, and affliction; in a word, I came to this\r\nconclusion, that a deliverance from sin was a much greater blessing,\r\nthan a deliverance from affliction. But again I proceed to my journal.\r\n\r\nTo the 14th of _July_, I walked about with my gun, little and little at\r\na time, having been reduced to the greatest extremity of weakness. The\r\napplications and experiments I used were perfectly new: neither could I\r\nrecommend them to any one's practice. For though it carried off the fit,\r\nit very much weakened me, and I had frequently convulsions in my nerves\r\nand limbs for some time. From this I learned, that going abroad in rainy\r\nweather, especially when it was attended with storms and hurricanes of\r\nwind, was most pernicious to health. I had now been about ten months in\r\nthe island; and as I never had seen any of the human kind, I therefore\r\naccounted myself as sole monarch; and as I grew better, having secured\r\nmy habitation to my mind, I resolved to make a tour round my kingdom, in\r\norder to make new discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe 15th of _July_, I began my journey; I first went to the creek, where\r\nI had brought my rafts on shore; and travelling farther, found the tide\r\nwent no higher than two miles up, where there was a little brook of\r\nrunning water, on the banks of which were many pleasant savannahs or\r\nmeadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the rising parts,\r\nwhere I supposed the water did not reach, I perceived a great deal of\r\ntobacco growing to a very strong stalk. Several other plants I likewise\r\nfound, the virtues of which I did not understand. I searched a long time\r\nfor the Cassava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate made\r\ntheir bread of, but all in vain. There were several plants of aloes,\r\nthough at that time I knew not what they were; likewise I saw several\r\nsugar canes, but imperfect for want of cultivation. With these few\r\ndiscoveries, I came back that night, and slept contentedly in my\r\nlittle castle.\r\n\r\nThe next day, being the 16th, going the same way, but farther then the\r\nday before, I found the country more adorned with woods and trees. Here\r\nI perceived different fruits in great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on\r\nthe ground, and clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread over the\r\ntrees. You may imagine I was glad of this discovery, yet ate very\r\nsparingly, lest I should throw myself into a flux or fever. The grapes I\r\nfound of excellent use; for when I had dried them in the sun, which\r\npreserved them as dried raisins are kept, they proved very wholesome and\r\nnourishing, and served me in those seasons when no grapes were to\r\nbe had.\r\n\r\nThe night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and slept very\r\ncomfortably, though it was the first time I had lain out of my\r\nhabitation. And when the morning came, I proceeded with great pleasure\r\non my way, travelling about four miles, as I imagined, by the length of\r\nthe valley, directing my course northward, there being a ridge of hills\r\non the south and north side of me. At the end of this valley, I came to\r\nan opening, where the country seemed to descend to the west; there I\r\nfound a little spring of fresh water, proceeding out of the side of the\r\nhill, with its chrystal streams running directly east. And, indeed, here\r\nmy senses were charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature could\r\nafford; for the country appeared flourishing, green, and delightful,\r\nthat to me it seemed like a planted garden. I then descended on the side\r\nof that delicious vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon,\r\nand citron trees, but very wild and barren at that time. As for the\r\nlimes, they were delightful and wholesome, the juice of which I after\r\nused to mix in water, which made it very cooling and refreshing. And now\r\nI was resolved to carry home and lay up a store of grapes, limes, and\r\nlemons, against the approaching wet season. So laying them up in\r\nseparate parcels, and then taking a few of each with me, I returned to\r\nmy little castle, after having spent three days in this journey. Before\r\nI got home, the grapes were so bruised that they were utterly spoiled;\r\nthe limes indeed were good, but of those I could bring only a few.\r\n\r\n_July 19_. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither again, but, to\r\nmy great surprise, found all the grapes spread about, trod to pieces,\r\nand abundance eaten, which made me conclude there were wild beasts\r\nthereabouts. To prevent this happening again, I gathered a large\r\nquantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches of the tree,\r\nboth to keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry in the sun;\r\nand having well loaded myself with limes and lemons, I returned once\r\nmore to my old place of residence.\r\n\r\nAnd now contemplating on the fruitfulness of this valey, and\r\npleasantness of its situation, its security from storms, and the\r\ndelightfulness of the adjacent woods, I concluded I was settled in the\r\nworst part of the country, and therefore was thinking to remove my\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nBut when I considered again, that though it was pleasant, it was off\r\nfrom the sea-side, where there was a possibility, some time or other, a\r\nship might either be driven or sail by; and that to inclose myself among\r\nhills and woods must certainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance; I\r\nresolved to let my castle remain where Providence had first assigned it.\r\nYet so ravished was I with this place, that I made me a little kind of\r\nbower, surrounding it with a double hedge, as high as I could reach,\r\nwell staked and filled with bullrushes: and having spent a great part of\r\nthe month of _July_, I think it was the first of _August_ before I began\r\nto enjoy my labour.\r\n\r\n_Aug. 3._ Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them from the trees,\r\nand they proved excellent good raisins of the sun: the most of which I\r\ncarried to my cave; and happy for me I did so; by which I saved the best\r\npart of my winter food.\r\n\r\n_Aug_. 14. This day it began to rain; and though I had made me a tent\r\nlike the other, yet having no shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,\r\nnor a cave behind me to retreat to, I was obliged to return to my old\r\ncastle. The rain continued more or less every day, till the middle of\r\n_October;_ and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my\r\ncave for several days. This season I found my family to increase; for\r\none of my cats that ran away from me, and which I thought had been dead,\r\nreturned about _August_, with three kittens at her heels, like herself,\r\nwhich I thought strange, because both my cats were females, and the wild\r\ncats of the island seemed to be of a different kind from our European\r\ncats; but from these cats proceeded such numbers, that I was forced to\r\nkill and destroy them as I would do wild beasts and vermin.\r\n\r\nTo the 26th of this month, I could not stir out, it raining incessantly;\r\nwhen beginning to want food, I was compelled to venture twice, the first\r\nof which I shot a goat, and afterwards found a very large tortoise. The\r\nmanner of my regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raisins served me\r\nfor my breakfast; a piece of goat's flesh or turtle boiled for my\r\ndinner, and two or three turtle's eggs for my supper. While the rain\r\nlasted, I daily worked two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by\r\ndegrees worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the\r\nhill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall,\r\nand so I came in and out this way. But after I had done this, I was\r\ntroubled to see myself thus exposed; though I could not perceive any\r\nthing to fear, a goat being the biggest creature I had seen upon\r\nthis island.\r\n\r\n_Sept_. 30. Casting up my notches on my post, which amounted to 365, I\r\nconcluded this to be the anniversary of my landing; and, therefore,\r\nhumbly prostrating myself on the ground, confessing my sins,\r\nacknowledging God's righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus\r\nChrist to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve hours till the going\r\ndown of the sun; and then eating a biscuit and a bunch of grapes, laid\r\nme on the bed, and with great comfort took my night's repose. Till this\r\ntime I never had distinguished the Sabbath-day; but now made a longer\r\nnotch than ordinary for the days of rest, and divided the weeks as well\r\nas I could, though I found I had lost a day or two in my account. My ink\r\nfailing soon after, I omitted in my daily memorandum things of an\r\nindifferent nature, & contented myself to write down only the most\r\nremarkable events of my life. The rainy and dry seasons appeared now\r\nregular to me, and experience taught me how to provide for them; yet, in\r\none thing I am going to relate, my experience very much failed me. You\r\nmay call to mind what I have mentioned of some barley and rice which I\r\nhad saved; about thirty stalks of the former, and twenty of the latter;\r\nand at that time, the sun being in its southern position, going from\r\nme, together with the rains, made me conclude it a very proper season to\r\nsow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, with my wooden spade,\r\nand dividing it into two parts, sowed about two thirds of my seed,\r\npreserving by me about a handful of each. And happy it was I did so; for\r\nno rains falling, it was choaked up, and never appeared above the earth\r\ntill the wet season came again, and then part of it grew, as if it had\r\nbeen newly sown.\r\n\r\nI was resolved all to make another trial; and seeking for a moister\r\npiece of ground near my bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed in\r\nFebruary, a little before the vernal equinox; which having the rainy\r\nmonths of March and April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang\r\nup very pleasantly. I had still saved part of the seed, not daring to\r\nventure all; and by the time I found out the proper seasons to sow it\r\nin, and that I might expect every year two seed-times and two harvests,\r\nmy stock amounted to above half a peck of each sort of grain.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the rains over, but the stakes which I had cut from the\r\ntrees, shot out like willows the first year after lopping their heads. I\r\nwas ignorant of the tree I cut them from; but they grew so regularly\r\nbeautiful, that they made a most lively appearance, and so flourished in\r\nthree year's time, that I resolved to cut more of them; and these soon\r\ngrowing made a glorious fence, as afterwards I shall observe.\r\n\r\nAnd now I perceived that the seasons of the year might generally be\r\ndivided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into wet and dry\r\nseasons, as in this manner:\r\n\r\n     / February,\\\r\nHalf<  March,    >  Rainy, sun coming near the Equinox.\r\n     \\ April,   /\r\n\r\n      / April,  \\\r\n     |  May,     |\r\nHalf<   June,     > Dry, sun getting north of the Line.\r\n     |  July,    |\r\n      \\ August, /\r\n\r\n     / August,   \\\r\nHalf<  September, >  Wet, the sun being then come back.\r\n     \\ October,  /\r\n\r\n      / October,  \\\r\n     |  November,  |\r\nHalf<   December,   >  Dry, sun running south of the Line.\r\n     |  January,   |\r\n      \\ February, /\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wet seasons would continue longer or shorter, as the winds happened\r\nto blow. But having found the ill consequences of being abroad in the\r\nrain, I took care beforehand to furnish myself with provisions; and\r\nduring the wet months sat within doors as much as possible. At this time\r\nI contrived to make many things that I wanted, though it cost me much\r\nlabour and pains, before I could accomplish them. The first I tried was\r\nto make a basket; but all the twigs I could get proved so brittle, that\r\nI could not then perform it. It now proved of great advantage to me that\r\nwhen a boy, I took great delight in standing at a basket-maker's in the\r\nsame town where my father lived, to view them at work; and like other\r\nboys, curious to see the manner of their working these things and very\r\nofficious to assist, I perfectly learned the method of it, and wanted\r\nnothing but the tools. And it coming into my mind that the twigs of that\r\ntree of which I made my stakes, might be as tough as a fallow willow, or\r\nosiers, growing in England, I resolved to make an experiment, and went\r\nthe next day to my country-seat, and found some fit for my turn; and\r\nafter cutting down a quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale,\r\nand, when fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where I employed\r\nmyself in making several sorts of baskets, insomuch that I could put in\r\nwhatsoever I pleased. It is true, they were not cleverly made, yet they\r\nserved my turn upon all occasions.\r\n\r\nBut still I wanted two necessary things. I had no cask to hold my\r\nliquor, except two rundlets almost full of rum, a few bottles of an\r\nordinary size, and some square case bottles, neither had I a pot to boil\r\nany thing in, only a large kettle unfit to make broth, or stew a bit of\r\nmeat: I wanted, likewise at the beginning of this dry season a tobacco\r\npipe; but for this I afterwards found an expedient.\r\n\r\nI kept myself employed in planting my second row of stakes, But\r\nremembering that when I travelled up to the brook, I had a mind to see\r\nthe whole island, I now resumed my intention, and taking my dog, gun,\r\nhatchet, two biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger\r\nquantity of powder and shot than usual, I began my journey. Having\r\npassed the vale where my bower stood, I came within view of the sea\r\nlying to the west when it being a clear day, I fairly descried land,\r\nextending from the W. to the S.W. about ten or fifteen leagues, as I\r\nconcluded; but could not say whether it was an island or a\r\ncontinent.--Neither could I tell what this place might be; only thought\r\nit was part of America, & where I might have been in a miserable\r\ncondition, had I landed. Again I considered that if this was the Spanish\r\ncoast, certainly, one time or other, I should see some ship pass by; and\r\nif it was not, then it must be the savage coast, between the Spanish\r\ncountry and Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man-eaters.\r\n\r\nAs I proceeded forward I found this side of the island much more\r\npleasant than mine; the fields fragrant adorned with sweet flowers &\r\nverdant grass, together with several very, fine woods. There were\r\nparrots in plenty, which made me long for one to be my companion; but\r\nit was with great difficulty I could knock one down with my stick; and I\r\nkept him at home some years before I could get him to call me by\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\nIn the low grounds, I found various sorts of hares and foxes, as I took\r\nthem to be, but much different from those in England. Several of these I\r\nkilled, but never ate them; neither indeed had I any occasion; for\r\nabounding with goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, I could defy\r\nLeadenhall market to furnish me a better table. In this journey I did\r\nnot travel above two miles a-day, because I took several turns and\r\nwindings, to see what discoveries I could make, returning weary enough\r\nto the place where I designed to rest all night, which was either in a\r\ntree, or in a place which I surrounded with stakes, that no wild\r\ncreature might suddenly surprise me. When I came to the sea shore, I was\r\namazed to see the splendour of it. Its strand was covered with shells of\r\nthe most beautiful fish, and constantly abounding with innumerable\r\nturtles, and fowls of many kinds, which I was ignorant of, except those\r\ncalled penguins. I might have shot as many as I pleased, but was sparing\r\nof my ammunition, rather choosing to kill a she-goat, which I did with\r\nmuch difficulty, on account of the flatness of the country.\r\n\r\nNow though this journey produced me the most pleasing satisfaction, yet\r\nmy habitation was so much to my liking, that I did not repine at my\r\nbeing seated on the worst part of the island. I continued my journey,\r\ntravelling about twelve miles further towards the east, where I set a\r\ngreat pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next journey\r\nshould bring me to the other side of the island, east from my castle,\r\nand so round till I came to my post again. As I had a constant view of\r\nthe country, I thought I could not miss my way; but scarce had I\r\ntravelled three miles, when I descended into a very large valley, so\r\nsurrounded with hills covered with wood, that I having no guide but the\r\nsun, nor even this, unless I knew will the position of the sun at the\r\ntime of day; and to add to my misfortune, the weather proving very hazy,\r\nI was obliged to return to my post by the sea-side, and so backwards the\r\nsame way I came. In this journey my dog surprised a kid and would have\r\nkilled it, had I not prevented him. As I had often been thinking of\r\ngetting a kid or two, and so raising a breed of tame goats to supply me\r\nafter my ammunition was spent, I took this opportunity of beginning: and\r\nhaving made a collar for this little creature, with a string made of\r\nrope-yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there inclosed and left him;\r\nand, having spent a month in this journey, at length I returned to my\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nNobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I returned to my little\r\ncastle, and reposed myself in my hammock. After my journey I rested\r\nmyself a week, which time I employed in, making a cage for my pretty\r\nPoll. I now began to consider the poor kid I had left in the bower, and\r\nI immediately went to fetch it home. When I came there I found the young\r\ncreature almost starved; I gave it some food, and tied it as before: but\r\nthere was no occasion, for it followed me like a dog; and, as I\r\nconstantly fed it, it became so loving, gentle, and fond, that it\r\ncommenced one of my domestics, and would never leave me.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now come, I kept the 30th\r\nof September in the most solemn manner, as usual, it being the third\r\nyear of my abode in the island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging\r\nGod's mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life as\r\nagreeable, and less sinful, than that of human society; and for the\r\ncommunications of his grace to my soul, in supporting, comforting, and\r\nencouraging me to depend, upon his Providence, and hope for his eternal\r\npresence in the world to come.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I often did consider how much more happy I was in this fate of\r\nlife, than in that accursed manner of living formerly used; and\r\nsometimes when hunting, or viewing the country, the anguish of my soul\r\nwould break out upon me, and my very heart would sink within me, to\r\nthink of the woods, the mountains, the desarts I was in; and how I was a\r\nprisoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an\r\nuninhabited wilderness, without hopes, and without redemption: In this\r\ncondition I would often wring my hands, and weep like a child: And even\r\nsometimes, in the middle of my work, this fit would take me; and then I\r\nwould sit down and sigh, looking on the ground for an hour or two\r\ntogether, till such time as my grief got vent in a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nOne morning as I was sadly employed in this manner, I opened my Bible,\r\nwhen I immediately fixed my eyes upon these words, _I will never leave\r\nthee, nor forsake thee!_ Surely, thought I, these words are directed to\r\nme, or else why should they appear just at a moment when I am bemoaning\r\nmy forlorn condition? and if God does not forsake, what matters it,\r\nsince he can me more happy in this state of life, than if I enjoyed the\r\ngreatest splendour in the world? But while I was going to return God\r\nthanks for my present state, something seemed to shock my mind, as if it\r\nhad thus said: _Unworthy wretch; can you pretend to be thankful for a\r\ncondition, from which you would pray to be delivered_? Therefore I\r\nstopt:--and tho' I could not say, I thanked the Divine Majesty for\r\nbeing there, yet I gave God thanks for placing in my view my former\r\ncourse of life, and granting me a true knowledge of repentance. And\r\nwhenever I opened or read the Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that\r\ndirected my good friend in England to send it among my goods without\r\nany order, and for assisting me to save it from the power of the\r\nraging ocean.\r\n\r\nAnd now beginning my third year, my several daily employments were\r\nthese: _First_, My duty to Heaven, and diligently reading the Holy\r\nScriptures, which I did twice or thrice every day: _Secondly_, Seeking\r\nprovision with my gun, which commonly took me up, when it did not rain,\r\nthree hours every morning: _Thirdly_, The ordering, curing, preserving,\r\nand cooking what I killed, or catched for my supply which took me up\r\ngreat part of the day: for, in the middle of the day, the sun being in\r\nits height, it was so hot, that I could not stir out; so that I had only\r\nbut four hours in the evening to work in: and then the want of tools, of\r\nassistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little purpose. I\r\nwas no less than two and forty days making a board fit for a long shelf,\r\nwhich two sawyers with their tools and saw-pit, would have cut off the\r\nsame tree in half a day. It was a large tree, as my board was to be\r\nbroad. I was three days in cutting it down and two more in lopping off\r\nthe boughs, and reducing it to a piece of timber. This I hacked and\r\nhewed off each side, till it became light to move; then I turned it,\r\nmade one side of is smooth and flat as a board from end to end, then\r\nturned it downward, cutting the other side, till I brouht the plank to\r\nbe about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any body may\r\njudge my great labour and fatigue in such a piece of work; but this I\r\nwent through with patience, as also many other things that my\r\ncircumstances made necessary for me to do.\r\n\r\nThe harvest months, November and December, were now at hand, in which I\r\nhad the pleasing prospect of a very good crop. But here I met with a new\r\nproblem; for the goats and hares, having tasted of the outshoot of the\r\nblade, kept it to short that it had not strengthen to shoot up into a\r\nstalk. To prevent this, I enclosed it with a hedge, and by day shot some\r\nof its devourers; and my dog which I had tied to the field-gate, keeping\r\nbarking all night; so frightened those creatures, that I got entirely\r\nrid of them.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner did I get rid of these, than other enemies appeared, to\r\nwit, whole flocks of several sorts of birds, who only waited till my\r\nback was turned, to ruin me: so much did this provoke me, that I let\r\nfly, and killed three of the malefactors; and afterwards served them as\r\nthey do notorious thieves in England, hung them up in chains as a terror\r\nto others. And, indeed, to good an effect had this that they not only\r\nforsook the corn, but all that part of the island, so long as these\r\ncriminals hung there.\r\n\r\nMy corn having ripened apace, the latter end of December, which was my\r\nsecond harvest, I reaped it with a scythe, made of one of my broad\r\nswords. I had no fatigue in cutting down my my first crop it was so\r\nslender. The ears I carried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands,\r\ninstead of threshing it: and when the harvest was over, found my half\r\npeck of seed produced near two bushels of rice, and two bushels and a\r\nhalf of barley. And now I plainly foresaw, that by God's goodness, I\r\nshould be furnished with bread; but yet I was concerned, because I knew\r\nnot how to grind or make meal of my corn, nor bread, neither knew how to\r\nbake it. I would not however, taste any of the crop, but resolved to\r\npreserve it against next season, and, in the mean while, use my best\r\nendeavours to provide myself with other food.\r\n\r\nBut where were my labours to end? The want of a plough to turn up the\r\nearth, or shovel to dig it, I conquered by making me a wooden spade. The\r\nwant of a harrow I supplied myself, with dragging over the corn a great\r\nbough of a tree. When it was growing I was forced to fence it; when ripe\r\nto mow it, carry it home, thrash it, part it from the chaff, and save\r\nit. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind it, sieve to dress it, yest\r\nand salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my\r\nbrains to work to find some expedient for every one of these necessaries\r\nagainst the next harvest.\r\n\r\nAnd now having more seed, my first care was to prepare me more land. I\r\npitched upon two large flat pieces of ground near my castle, for that\r\npurpose, in which sowed my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This\r\ntook me up three months: by which time the wet season coming on, and the\r\nrain keeping me within doors, I found several occasions to employ\r\nmyself; and, while at work, used to divert myself in talking to my\r\nparrot, learning him to know and speak his own name _Poll_ the first\r\nwelcome word I ever heard spoke in the island. I had been a long time in\r\ncontriving how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted extremely; and\r\nwhen I considered the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I\r\ncould find any such clay, I might botch up a pot, strong enough, when\r\ndried in the sun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that was dry,\r\nas corn, meal, and other things.\r\n\r\nTo be short, the clay I found; but it would occasion the most serious\r\nperson to smile, to see what aukward ways I took, and what ugly\r\nmisshapen things I made; how many either fell out or cracked by the\r\nviolent heat of the sun, and fell in pieces when they were removed; so\r\nthat I think it was two months time before I could perfect any thing:\r\nand even then but two clumsy things in imitation of earthen jars. These,\r\nhowever, I very gently placed in wicker baskets, made on purpose for\r\nthem, and between the pot and the baskets, stuffed it full of rice and\r\nbarley straw, and these I presume would hold my dried corn, and perhaps\r\nthe meal when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller thing, I made\r\nthem with better success, such as little round pots, flat dishes,\r\npitchers, and pipkins, the fun baking them very hard.\r\n\r\nYet still I wanted one thing absolutely necessary, and that was an\r\nearthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but also to bear the fire,\r\nwhich none of these could do. It once happened that as I was putting out\r\nmy fire, I found therein a broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as\r\nhard as a rock, and red as a tile. This made me think of burning some\r\npots; and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with leaf, I\r\nfixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a pile one upon\r\nanother. The fire I piled round the outside, and dry wood on the top,\r\ntill I saw the pots in the inside red hot, and found out that, they were\r\nnet crackt at all: and when I perceived them perfectly red, I let one of\r\nthem stand in the fire about five or six hours, till the clay melted by\r\nthe extremity of the heat, and would have run to glass, had I suffered\r\nit; upon which I slacked my fire by degrees, till the redness abated;\r\nand watching them till the morning, I found I had three very good\r\npipkins, and two earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn as I\r\ncould desire.\r\n\r\nNo joy could be greater than mine at this discovery. For after this, I\r\nmay say, I wanted for no fort of earthen ware. I filled one of my\r\npipkins with water to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well,\r\nand with a piece of kid I made me some good broth, as well as my\r\ncircumstances would afford me at that time.\r\n\r\nThe next concern I had was to get me a stone-morter to beat some corn\r\nin, instead of a mill to grind it. Here indeed I was at a great loss, as\r\nnot being fit for a stone-cutter; and many days I spent to find out a\r\ngreat stone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for a morter, and\r\nstrong enough to bear the weight of a pestil, and that would break the\r\ncorn without filling it with sand. But all the stones of the island\r\nbeing of a mouldering nature, rendered my search fruitless; and then I\r\nresolved to look out for a great block of hard wood, which having found,\r\nI formed it with my ax and hammer, and then, with infinite labour, made\r\na hollow in it, just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I\r\nhad finished this, I made a great pestil of iron wood, and then laid\r\nthem up against my succeeding harvest.\r\n\r\nMy next business was to make me a sieve, to sift my meal and part it\r\nfrom the bran and husk. Having no fine thin canvas to search the meal\r\nthrough, I could not tell what to do. What linen I had was reduced to\r\nrags: I had goat's hair, enough, but neither tools to work it, nor did I\r\nknow how to spin it: At length I remembered I had some neckcloths of\r\ncalico or muslin of the sailors, which I had brought out of the ship,\r\nand with these I made three small sieves proper enough for the work.\r\n\r\nI come now to consider the baking part. The want of an oven I supplied\r\nby making some earthen pans very broad but not deep. When I had a mind\r\nto bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which I had\r\nmade myself; and when the wood was burnt into live coals, I spread them\r\nover it, till it became very hot; then sweeping them away, I set down my\r\nloaves, and whelming down the earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes and\r\ncoals all around the outsides of the pots to continue the heat; and in\r\nthis manner I baked my barley loaves, as well as if I had been a\r\ncomplete pastry-cook, and also made of the rice several cakes\r\nand puddings.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that these things took me up the best part of a year,\r\nsince what intermediate time I had was bestowed in managing my new\r\nharvest and husbandry; for in the proper season I reaped my corn,\r\ncarried it home, and laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, til I\r\nhad time to rub, instead of thrashing it. And now, indeed, my corn\r\nincreased so much, that it produced me twenty bushels of barley, and as\r\nmuch rice, that I not only began to use it freely, but was thinking how\r\nto enlarge my barns, and resolved to sow as much at a time as would be\r\nsufficient for me for a whole year.\r\n\r\nAll this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen from the other\r\nside of the island, ran in my mind. I still meditated a deliverance from\r\nthis place, though the fear of greater misfortunes might have deterred\r\nme from it.--For, allowing that I had attained that place, I run the\r\nhazard of being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals: and if they\r\nwere not so, yet I might be slain, as other Europeans had been, who fell\r\ninto their hands. Notwithstanding all this, my thoughts ran continually\r\nupon that shore. I now wished for my boy Xury, and the long boat, with\r\nthe shoulder of mutton sail: I went to the ship's boat that had been\r\ncast a great way on the shore in the late storm. She was removed but a\r\nlittle; but her bottom being turned up by the impetuosity and fury of\r\nthe waves and wind, I fell to work with all the strength I had, with\r\nlevers and rollers I had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the\r\ndamages she had sustained. This work took me up three or four weeks,\r\nwhen finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to undermining it by\r\ndigging away the sand, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of\r\nwood to thrust and guide it in the fall. But after this was done, I was\r\nstill unable to stir it up, or to get under it, much less to move it\r\nforward towards the water, and so I was forced to give it over.\r\n\r\nThis disapointment, however did not frighten me. I began to think\r\nwhether it was not possible for me to make a canoe or perigua, such as\r\nthe Indians make of the trunk of a tree, But here I lay under particular\r\ninconveniencies; want of tools to make it, and want of hands to move it\r\nin the water when it was made. However, to work I went upon it, stopping\r\nall the inquiries I could make, with this very simple answer I made to\r\nmyself, _Let's first make it, I'll warrant I'll find some way or other\r\nto get it along when it is done_.\r\n\r\nI first cut down a cedar tree, which was five feet ten inches diameter\r\nat the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter\r\nat the end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for a space, and\r\nthen parted into branches. Twenty days was I a hacking and hewing this\r\ntree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off the branches and limbs,\r\nand a whole month in shaping it like the bottom of the boat. As for the\r\ninside, I was three weeks with a mallet and chissel, clearing it in such\r\na manner, as that it was big enough to carry twenty-six men, much bigger\r\nthan any canoe I ever saw in my life, and consequently sufficient to\r\ntransport me and all my effects to that wished-for shore I so\r\nardently desired.\r\n\r\nNothing remained now, but, indeed, the greatest difficulty to get it\r\ninto the water, it lying about one hundred yards from it. To remedy the\r\nfirst inconvenience, which was a rising hill between the boat and the\r\ncreek, with wonderful pains and labour I dug into the bowels of the\r\nearth, and made a declivity. But when this was done, all the strength I\r\nhad was as insufficient to remove it, as it was when I attempted to\r\nremove the boat. I then proceeded to measure the difference of ground,\r\nresolving to make a canal, in order to bring the water to the canoe,\r\nsince I could not bring the canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be\r\nimpracticable to myself alone, under the space of eleven or twelve\r\nyears, it brought me into some sort of consideration: so that I\r\nconcluded this also to be impossible, and the attempt altogether vain. I\r\nnow saw, and not before, _what stupidity it is to begin a work before we\r\nreckon its costs, or judge rightly our own abilities to go through with\r\nits performance_.\r\n\r\nIn the height of this work my fourth year expired, from the time I was\r\ncast on this island, At this time I did not forget my anniversary; but\r\nkept it with rather greater devotion than before. For now my hopes being\r\nfrustrated, I looked upon this world as a thing had nothing to do with;\r\nand very well might I say as Father Abraham said unto Dives, _Between\r\nthee and me there is a gulph fixed._ And indeed I was separated from its\r\nwickedness too, having neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the\r\neye, nor the pride of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king and\r\nemperor over the whole country I had in possession, without dispute and\r\nwithout control: I had loadings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in\r\nabundance, and grapes above measure. What was all the rest to me? the\r\nmoney I had lay by me as despicable dross, which I would freely have\r\ngiven for a gross of tobacco pipes, or a hard mill to grind my corn: in\r\na word the-nature and experience of these things dictated to me this\r\njust reflection: _That the good things of this world are no farther\r\ngood to us, than they are for our use; and that whatever we may heap up\r\nto give to others, we can but enjoy as much as we use, and no more._\r\n\r\nThese thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usual. Every time I sat\r\ndown to meat, I did it with thankfulness, admiring the providential hand\r\nof God, who in this wilderness had spread a table to me. And now I\r\nconsidered what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted, compared my\r\npresent condition with what I at first expected it should be; _how I\r\nshould have done, if I had got nothing out of the ship, that I must have\r\nperished before I had caught fish or turtles; or lived, had I found\r\nthem, like a mere savage, by eating them raw, and pulling them in pieces\r\nwith my claws, like a beast_. I next compared my station to that which I\r\ndeserved: _how undutiful I had been to my parents; how destitute of the\r\nfear of God; bow void of every thing that was good; and how ungrateful\r\nfor those abundant mercies I had received from Heaven, being fed as it\r\nwere, by a miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed by ravens; and\r\ncast on a place where there is no venomous creatures to poison or devour\r\nme_; in short making God's tender mercies matter of great consolation, I\r\nrelinquished all sadness, and gave way to contentment.\r\n\r\nAs long as my ink continued, which with water I made last as long as I\r\ncould, I used to minute down the days of the month on which any\r\nremarkable event happened.--And,\r\n\r\nFirst, I observed, _that the same day I forsook my parents and friends,\r\nand ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards in\r\nthe next year, I was taken and made a slave by the Sallee rovers_.\r\n\r\n_That the very day I escaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yarmouth\r\nroads, a year after on the same day, I made my escape from Sallee in my\r\npatron' fishing boat_.\r\n\r\n_And on the 30th of September, being the day of the year I was born on,\r\non that day twenty-six years after, was I miraculously saved, and cast\r\nashore on this island_.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that wasted after my ink, was the biscuit which I had\r\nbrought out of the ship, and though I allowed myself but one cake a day,\r\nfor above a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out of bread for near a year,\r\nbefore I got any corn of my own.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my linen had been gone\r\nlong before. However, I had preserved about three dozen of the sailors\r\nchequered shirts, which proved a great refreshment to me, when the\r\nviolent beams of the sun would not suffer me to bear any of the seamen's\r\nheavy watch coats, which made me turn taylor, and, after a miserable\r\nbotching manner, convert them to jackets. To preserve my head, I made\r\nme a cap of goat-skins, with the hair outwards to keep out the rain;\r\nwhich indeed served me so well, that afterwards I made me a waistcoat\r\nand opened-kneed breeches of the fame: And then I contrived a sort of an\r\numbrella, covering it with skins, which not only kept out the heat of\r\nthe sun, but rain also. Thus being easy, and settled in my mind, my\r\nchief happiness was to converse with God, in most heavenly and\r\ncomfortable ejaculations.\r\n\r\nFor five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary thing occured\r\nto me. My chief employment was to cure my raisins, and plant my barley\r\nand rice, of both which I had a year's provision beforehand. But though\r\nI was disapointed in my first canoe, I made it, at intermediate times,\r\nmy business to make a second, of much inferior size; and it was\r\ntwo-years before I had finished it. But as I perceived it would no way\r\nanswer my design of sailing to the other shore, my thoughts were\r\nconsigned to take a tour round the island, to see what further\r\ndiscoveries I could make. To this intent, after having moved her to the\r\nwater, and tried how she would sail, I fitted up a little raft to my\r\nboat, and made a sail of the ships sail that by me. I then made lockers\r\nor boxes at the end of it, to put in necessaries, provision, and\r\nammunition, which would preserve them dry, either from rain or the spray\r\nof the sea; and in the inside of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place\r\nto lay my gun in, and to keep it dry made a flag to hang over it. My\r\numbrella I fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the heat\r\nof the sun off me. And now resolving to see the circumference of my\r\nlittle kingdom, I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two\r\ndozen of my barley-bread loaves, an earthen pot-full of parched rice, a\r\nlittle bottle of rum, half a goat, powder and shot, and two watch coats.\r\nIt was the _6th_ of November, in the _6th_ year of my reign, or\r\ncaptivity, that I set out in this voyage; which was much longer than I\r\nexpected, being obliged to put further out, by reason of the rocks that\r\nlay a great way in the sea. And indeed so much did these rocks surprise\r\nme, that I was for putting back, fearing that if I ventured farther it\r\nwould be out of my power to return in this uncertainty I came to an\r\nanchor just off shore, to which I waded with my gun on my shoulder, and\r\nthen climbing up a hill, which overlooked that point, I saw the full\r\nextent of it, and so resolved to run all hazards.\r\n\r\nIn this prospect from the hill, I perceived a violent current running to\r\nthe east, coming very close to the point; which I the more carefully\r\nobserved, thinking it dangerous, and that when I came to it, I might be\r\ndrove into the sea by its force, and not able to return to the island;\r\nand certainly it must have been so, had I not made this observation; for\r\non the other side was the like current, with this difference, that it\r\nset off at a greater distance; and I perceived there was a strong eddy\r\nunder the land; so that my chief business was to work out of the first\r\ncurrent, and conveniently get into the eddy. Two days I staid here, the\r\nwind blowing very briskly E.S.E. which being contrary to the current,\r\nleaves a great breach of the sea upon the point; so it was neither fit\r\nfor me to keep too near the shore, on account of the breach; nor stand\r\nat too great a distance, for fear of the streams. That night the wind\r\nabating, it grew so calm, that I ventured out; & here I may be a\r\nmonument to all rash and ignorant pilots; for I was no sooner come to\r\nthe point and not above the boat's length from shore, but I was going\r\ninto a deep water, with a current like a mill, which drove my boat along\r\nso violently, that it was impossible for me to keep near the edge of it,\r\nbut forced me more and more out from the eddy to the left of me; and all\r\nI could do with my paddle were useless, there being no wind to help me.\r\n\r\nNow I began to look upon myself as quite lost, since as, the current ran\r\non both sides of the island, I was very certain they must join again,\r\nand then I had no hope but of perishing for want in the sea, after what\r\nprovision I had was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise.\r\n\r\nWho can conceive the present anguish of my mind at this calamity? with\r\nlonging eyes did I look upon my little kingdom, and thought the island\r\nthe pleasantest place in the universe. _Happy, thrice happy desert_,\r\nsaid I, _shall I never see thee more?_ _Wretched creature! wither am I\r\ngoing? Why did I murmur at my lonesome condition, when now I would give\r\nthe whole world to be thither again?_ While I was thus complaining, I\r\nfound myself to be driven about two leagues into the sea; however, I\r\nlaboured till my strength was far spent, to keep my boat as far north as\r\npossibly I could, to that side of the current where the eddy lay on.\r\nAbout noon I perceived a little breeze of wind spring up from the S.S.E.\r\nwhich overjoyed my heart; and was still more elated, when, in about half\r\nan hour it blew a gentle fine gale. Had any thick weather sprung up, I\r\nhad been left another way; for having no compass onboard, I should never\r\nhave found the way to steer towards the island, if once it had\r\ndisappeared; but it proving the contrary, I set up my mast again, spread\r\nmy sail, and stood away northward, as much as I could, to get rid of the\r\ncurrent. And no sooner did the boat begin to stretch away, but I\r\nperceived by the clearness of the water, a change of the current was\r\nnear; for, where it was strong, the water was foul; and where it was\r\nclear the current abated. To the east, I soon saw about half a mile, a\r\nbreach of the sea upon, some rocks, which caused it again to separate;\r\nand as the main force of it drove away more southwardly, leaving the\r\nrocks to the north-east, so the other came back by the repulse of the\r\nrocks making a sharp eddy, which returned back again to the north-west\r\nwith a very swift stream.\r\n\r\nThey who have experienced what it is to be reprieved upon the ladder, or\r\nto be saved from thieves, just going to take away their lives, or such\r\nas have been in the like calamities with my own, may guess my present\r\nexcess of joy, how heartily I ran my boat into the stream of this eddy,\r\nand how joyfully I spread my sail to the refreshing wind, standing\r\ncheerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot. By the assistance of\r\nthis eddy, I was carried above a league home again, when being in the\r\nwake of the island, betwixt the two currents, I found the water to be in\r\na sort of a stand. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within\r\na league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock, which\r\ncaused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed before, to the\r\nsouthward, which throwing off the current more southwardly had\r\noccasioned another eddy to the north. But having a fair brisk gale, I\r\nstretched across this eddy, and in an hour came within a mile of the\r\nshore, where I soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after an\r\nhumble prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with a resolution\r\nto lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my boat safe to a\r\nlittle cove, and laid me down to take a welcome repose. When I awoke I\r\nwas considering how I might get my boat home; and coasting along the\r\nshore, I came to a good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where\r\nfinding a safe harbour, I stowed her as safe as if she had been in a\r\ndry-dock made on purpose for her.\r\n\r\nI now perceived myself not far from the place where before I had\r\ntravelled on foot; so taking nothing with me except my gun and umbrella,\r\nI began my journey, and in the evening came to my bower, where I again\r\nlaid me down to rest. I had not slept long before I was awakened in\r\ngreat surprise, by a strange voice that called me several times. _Robin,\r\nRobin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin! Where are you, Robinson Crusoe?\r\nWhere are you? Where have you been_?\r\n\r\nSo fast was I asleep at first, that I did not awake thoroughly: but half\r\nasleep and half awake, I thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me.\r\nBut, as the voice repeated _Robinson Crusoe_ several times, being\r\nterribly affrighted, I started up in utmost confusion; and, no sooner\r\nwere my eyes fully open, but I beheld my pretty Poll sitting on the top\r\nof the hedge, and soon knew that it was he that called me; for just in\r\nsuch bewailing language I used to talk and teach him; which he so\r\nexactly learned that he would sit upon my finger and lay his bill close\r\nto my face, and cry, _Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you? where have\r\nyou been? how came you here_? and such like prattle I had constantly\r\ntaught him. But even though I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great\r\nwhile before I could adjust myself; being amazed how the creature got\r\nthither, and that he should fix about that place; and no where else.\r\nBut now being assured it could be no other than my honest Poll, my\r\nwonder ceased, and reaching out my hand, and calling familiarly Poll,\r\nthe creature came to me, and perched upon my thumb as he was wont,\r\nconstantly prating to me with _Poor Robinson Crusoe, and how did I come\r\nhere, and where had I been?_ as if the bird was overjoyed to see me; and\r\nso I took him home along with me.\r\n\r\nI was now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea; yet I could wish my\r\nboat, which had cost me so much trouble and pains, on this side the\r\nisland once more, but which indeed was impracticable. I therefore began\r\nto lead a very retired life, living near a twelvemonth in a very\r\ncontented manner, wanting for nothing except conversation. As to\r\nmechanic labours, which my necessities obliged me to, I fancied I could,\r\nupon occasion, make a tolerable carpenter were the poor tools I had to\r\nwork withal but good. Besides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I\r\ncontrived to make them with a wheel, which I found much easier and\r\nbetter, making my work shapely, which before was rude and ugly. But I\r\nthink I was never so elevated with my own performance or project, than\r\nfor being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which though it proved an awkward\r\nclumsy thing, yet it was very sound, and carried the smoke perfectly\r\nwell, to my great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI also improved my wicker ware, making me abundance of necessary\r\nbaskets, which though not very handsome, were very handy and convenient\r\nto fetch things home in, as also for holding my stores, barley, rice,\r\nand other provisions.\r\n\r\nMy powder beginning to fail, made me examine after what manner I should\r\nkill the goats or birds to live on after it was all gone. Upon which I\r\ncontrived many ways to ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them\r\nalive, particularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire, for\r\nmaking pitfalls and traps baited with barley and rice, I found one\r\nmorning, in one of them, an old he-goat, and in the other three kids,\r\none male, the other two females.\r\n\r\nSo boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him away. But I\r\nforgot the old proverb, _That hunger will tame a lion_: For had I kept\r\nhim three or four days without provisions, and then given him some\r\nwater, with a little corn, he would have been as tame as a young kid.\r\nThe other creatures I bound with strings together; but I had great\r\ndifficulty before I could bring them to my habitation. It was some time\r\nbefore they would feed; but throwing them sweet corn it so much tempted\r\nthem, that they began to be tamer. From hence I concluded, that if I\r\ndesigned to furnish myself with goat's flesh, when my ammunition was\r\nspent, the tamely breeding them up, like a flock of sheep, about my\r\nsettlement, was the only method I could take. I concluded also I must\r\nseparate the wild from the tame, or else they would always run wild as\r\nthey grew up; and the best way for this, was to have some inclosed piece\r\nof ground, well fenced, either with a hedge or pale, to keep them so\r\neffectually, that those within might not break out, or those without\r\nbreak in. Such an undertaking was very great for one pair of hands; but\r\nas there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first care was to\r\nfind a convenient piece of ground where there was likely to be herbage\r\nfor them to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.\r\n\r\nHere again, I gave another instance of my ignorance and inexperience,\r\npitching upon a piece of meadow land so large, that had I inclosed it,\r\nthe hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about. Indeed had it\r\nbeen ten miles, I had time enough to do it in; but then I did not\r\nconsider that my goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they\r\nhad had the whole island, and consequently as difficult for me to catch\r\nthem. This thought came into my head, after I had carried it on, I\r\nbelieve, about fifty yards; I therefore altered my scheme, and resolved\r\nto inclose a piece of ground about one hundred and fifty yards in\r\nlength, and one hundred in breadth, sufficient enough for as many as\r\nwould maintain me, till such time as my flock increased, and then I\r\ncould add more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and it took\r\nme about three months in hedging the first piece; in which time I\r\ntethered the three kids in the best part of it, feeding them as near me\r\nas possible, to make them familiar: and indeed I very often would carry\r\nsome ears of barley or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hands;\r\nby which they grew so tame, that when my inclosure was finished, and I\r\nhad let them loose they would run after me for a handful of corn. This\r\nindeed answered my end; and in a year and half's time I had a flock of\r\nabout twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years after, they amounted\r\nto forty-three, besides what I had taken and killed for my sustenance.\r\nAfter which I inclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in,\r\nwith pens to drive them into, that I might take them as I had occasion.\r\n\r\nIn this project I likewise found additional blessings; for I not only\r\nhad plenty of goat's flesh, but milk too, which in my beginning I did\r\nnot so much as think of. And, indeed, though I had never milked a cow,\r\nmuch less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made, yet, after some essays\r\nand miscarriages, I made the both, and never afterwards wanted.\r\n\r\nHow mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his creatures, even in\r\nthe midst of their greatest calamities? How can be sweeten the bitterest\r\nprovidences, and give us reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons?\r\nwhat a bounteous table was here spread in a wilderness for me, where I\r\nexpected nothing thing at first but to perish for hunger.\r\n\r\nCertainly a Stoic would have smiled to see me at dinner. There sat my\r\nroyal majesty, and absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended by\r\nmy dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased, I could either hang, draw,\r\nquarter, give them liberty, or take it away. When I dined, I seemed a\r\nking eating alone, none daring to presume to do so till I had done.\r\n_Poll_, as if he had been my principal court favorite, was the only\r\nperson, permitted to talk with me. My old but faithful dog, now grown\r\nexceedingly crazy, and who had no species to multiply his kind upon,\r\ncontinually sat on my right hand; while my two cats sat on each side of\r\nthe table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a principal mark of my royal\r\nfavour. These were not the cats I had brought from the ship; they had\r\nbeen dead long before, and interred near my habitation by mine own hand.\r\nBut one of them, as I suppose, generating with a wild cat, a couple of\r\ntheir young I had made tame; the rest ran wild into the woods, and in\r\ntime grew so impudent as to return and plunder me of my stores, till\r\nsuch time as I shot a great many, and the rest left me without troubling\r\nme any more. In this plentiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing\r\nbut conversation. One thing indeed concerned me, the want of my boat; I\r\nknew not which way to get her round the island. One time I resolved to\r\ngo along the shore by land to her; but had any one in England met such a\r\nfigure, it would either have affrighted them, or made them burst into\r\nlaughter; nay, I could not but smile myself at my habit, which I think\r\nin this place will be very proper to describe.\r\n\r\nThe cap I wore on my head, was great, high, and shapeless, made of a\r\ngoat's skin, with a flap of pent-house hanging down behind, not only to\r\nkeep the sun from me, but to shoot the rain off from running into my\r\nneck, nothing being more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh\r\nin these climates. I had a short jacket of goat's skin, whose hair hung\r\ndown such a length on each side, that it reached down to the calves of\r\nmy legs. As for shoes and stockings, I had none, but made a semblance of\r\nsomething, I know not what to call them; they were made like buskins,\r\nand laced on the sides like spatterdashes, Barbarously shaped like the\r\nrest of my habit. I had a broad belt of goat's skin dried, girt round me\r\nwith a couple of thongs, instead of buckles; on each of which, to supply\r\nthe deficiency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and saw. I had\r\nanother belt, not so broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which hung\r\nover my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two\r\npouches, made of goat's skin, to hold my powder and shot. My basket I\r\ncarried on my back, and my gun on my shoulder; and over my head a great\r\nclumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella; which, however, next to my gun, was\r\nthe most necessary thing about me. As for my face, the colour was not\r\nso swarthy as the Mulattoes, or might have been expected from one who\r\ntook to little care of it, in a climate within nine or ten degrees of\r\nthe equinox. At one time my beard grew so long that it hung down about a\r\nquarter of a yard; but as I had both razors scissors in store, I cut it\r\nall off, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan\r\nwhiskers, the like of which I had seen wore by some Turks at Sallee, not\r\nlong enough indeed to hang a hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as\r\nwould have amazed any in England to have seen.\r\n\r\nBut all this was of no consequence here, there being none to observe my\r\nbehavior or habit. And so, without fear and without controul, I\r\nproceeded on my journey, the prosecution of which took me up five or six\r\ndays. I first travelled along the sea shore, directly to the place where\r\nI first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; but now\r\nhaving no boat to take care of, I went overland a nearer way to the same\r\nheight that I was before upon; when looking forward to the point of the\r\nrock, which lay out, and which I was forced to double with my boat, I\r\nwas amazed to see the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no ripling\r\nmotion, nor current, any more than in other places. This made me ponder\r\nsome time to guess the reason of it, when at last I was convinced that\r\nthe ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of water\r\nfrom some great river on shore, must be the occasion of these rapid\r\nstreams; & that, consequently, as the winds blew more westwardly, or\r\nmore southwardly, so the current came he nearer, or went the farther\r\nfrom the shore. To satisfy my curiosity, I waited there till evening,\r\nwhen the time of ebb being made, I plainly perceived from the rock the\r\ncurrent again as before, with the difference that it ran farther off,\r\nnear half a league from the shore, whereas in my expedition, it set\r\nclose upon it, furiously hurrying me and my canoe along with it, which\r\nat another time would not have done. And now I was convinced, that, by\r\nobserving the ebbing and flowing of the tide I might easily bring my\r\nboat round the island again. But when I began to think of putting it in\r\npractice, the remembrance of the late danger, struck me with such\r\nhorror, that I changed my resolution, and formed another, which was more\r\nsafe, though more laborious; and this was to make another canoe, and to\r\nhave one for one side of the island, and one for the other.\r\n\r\nI had now two plantations in the island; the first my little\r\nfortification, fort, or castle, with many large and spacious\r\nimprovements; for by this time I had enlarged the cave behind me with\r\nseveral little caves, one with another, to hold my baskets, corn, and\r\nstraw. The piles with which I made my wall were grown so lofty and great\r\nas obscured my habitation. And near this commodious and pleasant\r\nsettlement, lay my well cultivated and improved corn-fields, which\r\nkindly yielded me their fruit in the proper season. My second plantation\r\nwas that near my country seat, or little bower, where my grapes\r\nflourished, and where, having planted many stakes, I made inclosures for\r\nmy goats, so strongly fortified by labour and time, that it was much\r\nstronger than a wall, and consequently impossible for them to break\r\nthrough. As for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in repair, and cut\r\nthe trees in such a manner, as made them grow thick and wild, and form a\r\nmost delightful shade. In the centre of this stood my tent, thus\r\nerected. I had driven four piles in the ground, spreading over it a\r\npiece of the ship's sail; beneath which I made a sort of couch with the\r\nskins of the creatures I had slain, and other things; and having laid\r\nthereon one of the sailor's blankets, which I had saved from the wreck\r\nof the ship, and covering myself with a great watch-coat, I took up this\r\nplace for my country retreat.\r\n\r\nVery frequently from this settlement did I use to visit my boat, and\r\nkeep her in very good order. And sometimes I would venture in her a cast\r\nor two from shore, but no further, lest either a strong current, a\r\nsudden stormy wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from the\r\nisland as before. But now I entreat your attention, whilst I proceed to\r\ninform you of a new, but most surprising scent of life which there\r\nbefel me.\r\n\r\nYou may easily suppose, that, after having been here so long, nothing\r\ncould be more amazing than to see a human creature. One day it happened,\r\nthat going to my boat I saw the print of a man's naked foot on the\r\nshore, very evident on the sand, as the toes, heel, and every part of\r\nit. Had I seen an apparition in the most frightful shape, I could not\r\nhave been more confounded. My willing ears gave the strictest attention.\r\nI cast my eyes around, but could satisfy neither the one nor the other,\r\nI proceeded alternately in every part of the shore, but with equal\r\neffect; neither could I see any other mark, though the sand about it was\r\nas susceptible to take impression, as that which was so plainly stamped.\r\nThus struck with confusion and horror, I returned to my habitation,\r\nfrightened at every bush and tree, taking every thing for men; and\r\npossessed with the wildest ideas. That night my eyes never closed. I\r\nformed nothing but the most dismal imaginations, concluding it must be\r\nthe mark of the devil's foot which I had seen. For otherwise how could\r\nany mortal come to this island? where was the ship that transported\r\nthem? & what signs of any other footsteps? Though these seemed very\r\nstrong reasons for such a supposition, yet (thought I) why should the\r\ndevil make the print of his foot to no purpose, as I can see, when he\r\nmight have taken other ways to have terrified me? why should he leave\r\nhis mark on the other side of the island, and that too on the sand,\r\nwhere the surging waves of the ocean might soon have erased the\r\nimpression. Surely this action is not consistent with the subtility of\r\nSatan, said I to myself; but rather must be some dangerous creature,\r\nsome wild savage of the main land over against me, that venturing too\r\nfar in the ocean, has been driven here, either by the violent currents\r\nor contrary winds; and not caring to stay on this desolate island, has\r\ngone back to sea again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robinson Crusoe struck with confusion and horror, at\r\nseeing the print of a man's foot upon the sand _Dr. & Eng. by A.\r\nCarse, Edin._]\r\n\r\nHappy, indeed, said I to myself, that none of the savages had seen me in\r\nthat place: yet I was not altogether without fear, lest, having found my\r\nboar, they should return in numbers and devour me; or at least carry\r\naway all my corn, and destroy my flock of tame goats. In a word, all my\r\nreligious hopes vanished, as though I thought God would not now protect\r\nme by his power, who had so wonderfully preserved me so long.\r\n\r\nWhat various chains of Providence are there in the life of man! How\r\nchangeable are our affections, according to different circumstances! We\r\nlove to-day, what we hate to-morrow; we shun one hour, what we seek the\r\nnext. This was evident in me in the most conspicous manner: For I, who\r\nbefore had so much lamented my condition, in being banished from all\r\nhuman kind, was now even ready to expire, when I considered that a man\r\nhad set his foot on this desolate island. But when I considered my\r\nstation of life decreed by the infinitely wise and good providence of\r\nGod, that I ought not to dispute my Creator's sovereignty, who has an\r\nunbounded right to govern and dispose of his creatures as he thinks\r\nconvenient; and that his justice and mercy could either punish or\r\ndeliver me: I say when I considered all this, I comfortably found it my\r\nduty to trust sincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly resign\r\nmyself to his divine will.\r\n\r\nOne morning, lying on my bed, these words of the sacred writings came\r\ninto my mind, _Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver\r\nthee, and thou shalt glorify me._ Upon this sentence, rising more\r\ncheerfully from my bed, I offered up my prayers in the most heavenly\r\nmanner; and when I had done, taking up my Bible to read, these words\r\nappeared first in my sight:--_Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer,\r\nand he shall strengthen thy heart: Wait, I say, on the Lord._ Such\r\ndivine comfort did this give me, as to remove all cause of sadness upon\r\nthat occasion.\r\n\r\nThus, after a world of apprehensions and fears, for three days and\r\nnights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and milked my goats, one of\r\nwhich was almost spoiled for want of it. I next (though in great fear)\r\nvisited my bower, and milked my flocks there also; when, growing bolder,\r\nI went down to the shore again, and measuring the print of the foot to\r\nmine, to see, perhaps, whether I myself had not occasioned that mark, I\r\nfound it much superior in largeness; and so returned home, now\r\nabsolutely convinced that either some men had been ashore, or that the\r\nisland must be inhabited, and therefore that I might be surprised before\r\nI was aware.\r\n\r\nI now began to think of providing for my security, and resolved in my\r\nmind many different schemes for that purpose. I first proposed to cut\r\ndown my inclosures; and turn my tame cattle wild into the woods that the\r\nenemy might not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing\r\nthe same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn fields for the very\r\nsame reason. An, lastly, I concluded to demolish my bower, lest, seeing\r\na place of human contrivance, they might come farther and find out and\r\nattack me in my little castle.\r\n\r\nSuch notions did the fear of danger suggest to me; and I looked I\r\nthought like the unfortunate king Saul, when not only oppressed by the\r\nPhilistines, but also forsaken by God himself. And, it is strange, that\r\na little before, having entirely resigned myself to the will of God, I\r\nshould now have little confidence in him, fearing those more who could\r\nkill this fading body, than him who could destroy my immortal soul.\r\n\r\nSleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that night: yet nature, spent and\r\ntired, submitted to a silent repose the next morning, and then joining\r\nreason with fear, I considered that this delightful and pleasant island\r\nmight not be to entirely forsaken as I might think; but that the\r\ninhabitants from the other shore might fail, either with design or from\r\nnecessity, by cross winds; and if the latter circumstance. I had reason\r\nto believe they would depart the first opportunity. However, my fear\r\nmade me think of a place for retreat upon an attack. I now repented that\r\nI had made my door to come out beyond my fortification; to remedy which,\r\nI resolved to make me a second one: I fell to work, therefore, and drove\r\nbetwixt that double row of trees, which I planted above twelve years\r\nbefore, several strong piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and\r\nold cables, and strengthening the foot of it with earth which I dug out\r\nof my cave; I also made me seven holes, wherein I planted my muskets\r\nlike cannon, fitting them into frames resembling carriages. This being\r\nfinished with indefatigable industry, for a great way every where, I\r\nplanted sticks of osier like a wood, about twenty thousand of them,\r\nleaving a large space between them and my wall, that I might have room\r\nto see an enemy, and that they might not be sheltered among the young\r\ntrees, if they offered to approach the outer wall. And, indeed, scarce\r\ntwo years had passed over my head, when there appeared a lovely shady\r\ngrove, and in six years it became a thick wood perfectly impassable. For\r\nmy safety, I left no avenue to go in or out: instead of which I set two\r\nladders, one to a part of a rock which was low, and then broke in,\r\nleaving room to place another ladder upon that; so that when I took\r\nthese down, it was impossible for any man to descend without hurting\r\nhimself; and if they had, they would still be at the outside of my outer\r\nwall. But while I took all these measures of human prudence for my own\r\npreservation I was not altogether unmindful of other affairs. To\r\npreserve my stock of tame goats, that the enemy should not take all at\r\nonce, I looked out for the most retired part of the island, which was\r\nthe place where I had lost myself before-mentioned; and there finding a\r\nclear piece of land, containing three acres, surrounded with thick\r\nwoods, I wrought so hard, that in less than a month's time, I fenced it\r\nso well round, that my flocks were very well secured in it, and I put\r\ntherein two he-goats and ten she ones.\r\n\r\nAll this labour was occasioned purely by fearful apprehensions, on\r\naccount of seeing the print of a man's foot. And not contented yet with\r\nwhat I had done, I searched for another place towards the west point of\r\nthe island, where I might also retain another flock. Then wandering on\r\nthis errand more to the west of the island than ever I had yet done, and\r\ncasting my eyes towards the sea, methought I perceived a boat at a great\r\ndistance; but could not possibly tell what it was for want of my\r\nperspective glass. I considered then it was no strange thing to see the\r\nprint of a man's foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed God for\r\nbeing cast on the other side of the island, where none of the savages,\r\nas I thought, ever came. But when I came down the hill to the shore,\r\nwhich was the S.W. point of the island, I was soon confirmed in my\r\nopinion; nor can any one describe my horror and amazement, when I saw\r\nthe ground spread with sculls, hands, feet, and bones of human bodies;\r\nand particularly, I perceived a space like a circle, in the midst of\r\nwhich had been a fire, about which I conjectured these wretches sat, and\r\nunnaturally sacrificed and devoured their fellow creatures.\r\n\r\nThe horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle, both confounded\r\nmy senses, and made me discharge from my stomach in an excessive manner.\r\nI then returned towards my habitation; and, in my way thither, shedding\r\nfloods of tears, and falling down on my bended knees, gave God thanks\r\nfor making my nature contrary to these wretches, and delivering me so\r\nlong out of their hands.\r\n\r\nThough reason and my long residence here had assured me, that these\r\nsavages never came up to the thick woody parts of the country, and that\r\nI had no reason to be apprehensive of a discovery; yet such an abhorence\r\ndid I still retain, that, for two years after, I confined myself only to\r\nmy three plantation: I mean my castle, country-seat, and inclosure in\r\nthe woods. And though in process of time, my dreadful apprehensions\r\nbegan to wear away, yet my eyes were more vigilant for fear of being\r\nheard by those creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I resolved,\r\nhowever, manfully to lose my life if they did, and went armed with three\r\npistols stuck in my girdle, which added to the description I have given\r\nof myself before, made me look with a very formidable appearance.\r\n\r\nThus my circumstances for some time remained very calm and undisturbed;\r\nand when I compared my condition to others, I found it far from being\r\nmiserable. And, indeed, would all persons compare their circumstances,\r\nnot with those above them, but with those innumerable unhappy objects\r\nbeneath them, I am sure we should not hear these daily murmurings and\r\ncomplainings that are in the world. For my part, I wanted but few\r\nthings. Indeed, the terror which the savages had put me in, spoiled some\r\ninventions for my own conveniences. One of my projects was to brew me\r\nsome beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when it is considered that I had\r\nneither casks sufficient; nor could I make any to preserve it in;\r\nneither had I hops to make it keep, yest to make it work, nor a copper\r\nor kettle to make it boil. Perhaps, indeed, after some years, I might\r\nbring this to bear, as I had done other things. But now my inventions\r\nwere placed another way; and day and night I could think of nothing but\r\nhow I might destroy some of these cannibals, when proceeding to their\r\nbloody entertainments; and so saving a victim from being sacrificed,\r\nthat he might after become my servant. Many were my contrivances after\r\nthis purpose, and as many more objections occurred after I hatched them.\r\nI once contrived to dig a hole under the place where they made their\r\nfire, and put therein five or six pounds of gunpowder, which would\r\nconsequently blow up all those that were near it: but then I was loth to\r\nspend so much upon them, lest it should not do that certain execution I\r\ncould desire, & but only affright & not kill them. Having laid this\r\ndesign aside, I again proposed to myself to lie privately in ambush, in\r\nsome convenient place, with my three guns double loaded, and let fly at\r\nthem in the midst of their dreadful ceremony: and having killed two or\r\nthree of them at every shot, fall upon the rest suddenly with my three\r\npistols, & not let one mother's son escape. Thus imagination pleased my\r\nfancy so much that I used to dream of it in the night time. To put my\r\ndesign in execution, I was not long in seeking for a place convenient\r\nfor my purpose, where unseen I might behold every action of the savages.\r\nHere I placed my two muskets, each of which was loaded with a brace of\r\nslugs, and four or five smaller bullets about the size of pistol\r\nbullets; the fowling-piece was charged with near a handful of the\r\nlargest swan-shot, and in every pistol were about four bullets. And thus\r\nall things being prepared, no sooner would the welcome light spread over\r\nthe element, but, _like a giant refreshed with wine_, as the Scripture\r\nhas it, would I issue forth from my castle, and from a lofty hill, three\r\nmiles distant, view if I could see any invaders approach unlawfully to\r\nmy kingdom. But having waited in vain two or three months, it not only\r\ngrew very tiresome to me, but brought me to some consideration, and\r\nmade me examine myself, what right I had to kill these creatures in\r\nthis manner.\r\n\r\nIf (argued I to myself) this unnatural custom of theirs be a sin\r\noffensive to Heaven, it belongs to the Divine Being, who alone has the\r\nvindictive power in his hands, to shower down his vengeance upon them.\r\nAnd perhaps he does so, in making them become one another's\r\nexecutioners. Or, if not, if God thinks these doings just, according to\r\nthe knowledge they conceive, what authority have I to pretend to thwart\r\nthe decrees of Providence, which has permitted these actions for so many\r\nages, perhaps from almost the beginning of the creation? They never\r\noffended me, what right have I then to concern myself in their shedding\r\none another's blood: And, indeed, I have since known, they value no more\r\nto kill and devour a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox or\r\neat mutton. I then concluded it necessarily followed, that these people\r\nwere no more murderers than Christians, who many times put whole troops\r\nto the sword, after throwing down their arms.--Again I considered, that\r\nif I fell upon them, I should be as much in the wrong as the Spaniards,\r\nwho had committed the greatest barbarities upon these people who had\r\nnever offended them in their whole lives; as if the kingdom of Spain was\r\neminent for a race of men without common compassion to the miserable, a\r\nprincipal sign of the most generous temper: these considerations made me\r\npause, and made me think I had taken wrong measures in my resolution: I\r\nnow argued with myself, it was better for me never to attack, but to\r\nremain undiscovered as long as I possibly could; that an opposite\r\nconduct would certainly prove destructive; for as it was scarcely to be\r\nsupposed I could kill them all, I might either be overpowered by the\r\nremaining, or that some escaping, might bring thousands to my certain\r\ndestruction. And, indeed, religion took their part so much as to\r\nconvince me how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding\r\nhuman blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they are to one\r\nanother: that I had nothing to do with it, but leave it to the God of\r\nall power and dominion, as I said before, to do therein what seemed\r\nconvenient to his heavenly wisdom. And, therefore, on my knees I thanked\r\nthe Almighty for delivering me from blood guiltiness, and begged his\r\nprotection that I might never fall into their hands.\r\n\r\nThus giving over an attempt which I had rashly begun, I never ascended\r\nthe hill on that occasion afterwards: I only re-removed my boat, which\r\nlay on the other side of the island, and every thing that belonged to\r\nher, towards the east, into a little cove; that there might not be the\r\nleast shadow of any boat near, or habitation upon the island.--My castle\r\nthen became my cell, keeping always retired in it, except when I went\r\nout to milk my she-goats, and order my little flock in the wood, which\r\nwas quite out of danger: for sure I was that these savages never came\r\nhere with expectations to find any thing, consequently never wandered\r\nfrom the coast; however, as they might have several times been on shore,\r\nas well before as after my dreadful apprehensions, I looked back with\r\nhorror to think in what state I might have been, had I suddenly met them\r\nslenderly armed; with one gun only loaded with small shot; and how great\r\nwould have been my amazement, if, instead of seeing the print of one\r\nman's foot, I had perceived fifteen, or twenty savages, who having once\r\nset their eyes upon me, by the swiftness of their feet would have left\r\nme no possibility of escaping? These thoughts would sink my very soul,\r\nso that I would fall into a deep melancholy, till such time as the\r\nconsideration of my gratitude to the Divine Being moved it from my\r\nheart. I then fell into a contemplation of the secret springs of\r\nProvidence, and how wonderfully we are delivered, when insensible of it;\r\nand when intricated in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or\r\nhesitation, what secret hint directs us in the right way, when we\r\nintended to go out of it, nay, perhaps contrary to our business, sense\r\nor inclination. Upon which, I fixed within me this as a certain rule,\r\nnever to disobey those secret impressions of the mind, to the acting or\r\nnot acting any thing that offered, for which I yet could assign no\r\nreason. But let it be how it will, the advantage of this conduct very\r\neminently appeared in the latter part of my abode on this island; I am,\r\na stranger in determining whence these secret intimations of Providence\r\nderive; yet methinks they are not only some proof of the converse of\r\nspirits, but also of the secret communications they are supposed to have\r\nwith those that have not passed through the gloomy vale of death.\r\n\r\nThese anxieties of mind, and the care of my preservation, put a period\r\nto all future inventions and contrivances, either for accommodation or\r\nconvenience. I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun\r\nor make a fire, lest either the noise should be heard, or the smoke\r\ndiscover me. And on this account I used to burn my earthen ware\r\nprivately in a cave which I found in the wood, and which I made\r\nconvenient for that purpose; the principal cause that brought me here\r\nwas to make charcoal, so that I might bake and dress my bread and meat\r\nwithout any danger. At that time a curious accident happened me, which I\r\nshall now relate.\r\n\r\nWhile I was cutting down some wood for making my charcoal, I perceived a\r\ncavity behind a very thick branch of underwood. Curious to look into it,\r\nI attained its month, and perceived it sufficient for me to stand\r\nupright in. But when I had entered, and took a further view, two rolling\r\nshining eyes like flaming stars seemed to dart themselves at me; so that\r\nI made all the haste out that I could, as not knowing whither it was the\r\ndevil or a monster that had taken his residence in that place. When I\r\nrecovered a little from my surprise, I called myself a thousand fools,\r\nfor being afraid to see the devil one moment, who had now lived almost\r\ntwenty years in the most retired solitude. And therefore resuming all\r\nthe courage I had, I took a flaming firebrand, and in I rushed again. I\r\nhad not proceeded above three steps, when I was more affrighted than\r\nbefore; for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human creature\r\nin the greatest agony, succeeded with a broken noise, resembling words\r\nhalf expressed, and then a broken sigh again. Stepping back, _Lord!_\r\n(thought I to myself) _where am I got, into what enchanted place have I\r\nplunged myself, such as are reported to contain miserable captives, till\r\ndeath puts an end to their sorrow_? And, indeed, in such great amazement\r\nwas I, that it struck me into a cold sweat; and had my hat been on my\r\nhead, I believe my hair would have moved it off. But again encouraging\r\nmyself with the hopes of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and, by\r\nthe light of my firebrand, perceived it to be a monstrous he-goat, lying\r\non the ground, gasping for life, and dying of mere old age. At first, I\r\nstirred him, thinking to drive him out, but the poor ancient creature\r\nstrove to get upon his feet, but was not able; so I e'en let him lie\r\nstill to affright the savages, should they venture into this cave. I now\r\nlooked round me and found the place but small and shapeless. At the\r\nfarther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance, yet so low, as\r\nmust oblige me to creep upon my hands and knees to it; so, having no\r\ncandle, I suspended my enterprise till the next day, and then I came\r\nprovided with two large ones of my own making.\r\n\r\nHaving crept upon my hands and feet, through this strait, I found the\r\nroof higher up, I think about twenty feet. But surely mortal never saw\r\nsuch a glorious sight before! The roof and walls of this cave reflected\r\na hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles, as though they were\r\nindented with mining gold, precious stones, or sparkling diamonds. And\r\nindeed it was the most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind that\r\ncould be desired, though entirely dark. The floor was dry and level, and\r\nhad a kind of gravel upon it: no nauseous venomous creatures to be seen\r\nthere, neither any damp or wet about it. I could find no fault but in\r\nthe entrance, and I began to think that even this might be very\r\nnecessary for my defence, and therefore resolved to make it my most\r\nprincipal magazine. I brought hither two fowling-pieces, and three\r\nmuskets, leaving only five pieces at my castle, planted in the nature of\r\ncannon. Of the barrel of gunpowder, which I took up out of the sea, I\r\nbrought away about sixty pounds powder, which was not damaged, and this\r\nwith a great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed for my castle to\r\nthis retreat, now fortified both by art and nature.\r\n\r\nI fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who were said to\r\nlive in caves and holes among the rocks, inaccessible to any but\r\nthemselves, or, at lest, a most dangerous to attempt. And now I despised\r\nboth the cunning and strength of the savages, either to find me out or\r\nto hurt me.\r\n\r\nBut I must not forget the old goat, which caused my late dreadful\r\namazement. The poor creature gave up the ghost the day after my\r\ndiscovery; & it being difficult to drag him out, I dug his grave, and\r\nhonourably entombed him in the same place where is departed, with as\r\nmuch ceremony as any Welch goat that has been interred about the high\r\nmountain Penmanmawn.\r\n\r\nI think I was now in the twenty-third year of my reign, and my thoughts\r\nmuch easier than formerly, having contrived several pretty amusements\r\nand diversions to pass away the time in a pleasant manner. By this time\r\nmy pretty Poll had learned to speak English, and pronounce his words\r\nvery articulately and plain; so that for many hours we used to chat\r\ntogether after a familiar manner, and he lived with me no less than\r\ntwenty-six years. My dog which was nineteen years old, sixteen of which\r\nhe lived with me, died some time ago of mere old age. As for my cats,\r\nthey multiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into\r\nthe woods, except two or three which became my particular favourites.\r\nBesides these, I continually kept two or three household kids about me,\r\nwhich I learned to feed out of my hand, and two more parrots which could\r\ntalk indifferently, and call _Robinson Crusoe_, but not so excellently\r\nas the first, as not taking that pains with them. I had also several\r\nsea-owls which I had wounded and cut their wings; and growing tame, they\r\nused to breed among the low trees about my castle walls, all which made\r\nmy abode very agreeable.\r\n\r\nBut what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoyment, of this\r\nuncertain state of life, when we least expect them! it was now the month\r\nof December, in the southern solstice, and particular time of my\r\nharvest, which required my attendance in the fields; when going out\r\npretty early one morning, before it was day-light, there appeared to me,\r\nfrom the sea shore, a flaming light, about two miles from me at the east\r\nend of the island, where I had observed some savages had been before,\r\nnot on the other side, but to my great affliction, it was on my side\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nStruck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehensions, that the\r\nsavages would perceive my improvements, I returned directly to my\r\ncastle, pulled the ladder after me, making all things look as wild and\r\nnatural as I possibly could. In the next place, I put myself into a\r\nposture of defence, loading my muskets and pistols, and committing\r\nmyself to God's protection, I resolved to defend myself till my last\r\nbreath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence, I set my ladder up\r\nto the side of the hill, where there was a flat place, and then pulling\r\nthe ladder after me ascended to the top, where laying myself on my\r\nbelly, with my perspective glass, I perceived no less than nine naked\r\nsavages, sitting round a small fire, eating, as I supposed human flesh,\r\nwith their two canoes haled on shore, waiting for the flood to carry\r\nthem off again. You cannot easily express the consternation I was in at\r\nthis sight, especially seeing them near me; but when I perceived their\r\ncoming must be always with the current of the ebb, I became more easy in\r\nmy thoughts, being fully convinced that I might go abroad with security\r\nall the time of flood, if they were not before landed. And, indeed, this\r\nproved just as I imagined; for no sooner did they all take boat and\r\npaddle away, but the tide made N.W. Before they went off they danced,\r\nmaking ridiculous postures and gestures for above an hour, all stark\r\nnaked; but whether men or women, or both, I could not perceive. When I\r\nsaw them gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, and placing a couple\r\nof pistols in my belt, with my great sword hanging by my side, I went to\r\nthe hill, where at first I made a discovery of these cannibals, and then\r\nsaw there had been three canoes more of the savages on shore at that\r\nplace, which with the rest were making over to the main land.\r\n\r\nBut nothing could be more horrid to me, when going to the place of\r\nsacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other mangled parts of human bodies\r\nappeared in my sight; and so fired was I with indignation, that I was\r\nfully resolved to be revenged on the first that came there, though I\r\nlost my life in the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visits\r\nwhich they make to this island are not very frequent, it being fifteen\r\nmonths before they came again; but still I was very uneasy, by reason of\r\nthe dismal apprehensions of their surprising me unawares; nor dared I\r\noffer to fire a gun on that side of the island where they used to\r\nappear, lest, taking the alarm, the savages might return with many\r\nhundred canoes, and then God knows in what manner I should have made my\r\nend. Thus was I a year or more before I saw any of these devouring\r\ncannibals again.\r\n\r\nBut to wave this, the following accident, which demands attention, for a\r\nwhile eluded the force of my thoughts in revenging myself on\r\nthose Heathens.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of May (according to my wooden calendar) the wind blew\r\nexceedingly hard, accompanied with abundance of lightning and thunder\r\nall day, and succeeded by a very stormy night. The seeming anger of the\r\nHeavens made me have recourse to my Bible. While I was seriously\r\npondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the noise of a gun, which\r\nI conjectured was fired upon the ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me\r\nstart up in a minute, when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain as\r\nbefore, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the report of another\r\ngun which I presently heard, and found it was from that part of the sea\r\nwhere the current drove me away. I could not but then think, that this\r\nmust be a ship in distress, and that there were the melancholy signals\r\nfor a speedy deliverance. Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon this\r\noccasion; but my labours to assist them must have proved altogether vain\r\n& fruitless. However, I brought together all the dry wood that was at\r\nhand, and making a pretty large pile, set it on fire on the hill. I was\r\ncertain they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun as soon\r\nas it began to blaze, and after that several more from the same quarter.\r\nAll night long I kept up my fire: and when the air cleared up, I\r\nperceived something a great way at sea, directly E. but could not\r\ndistinguish what it was, even with my glass, by reason that the weather\r\nwas so very foggy out at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly fixed\r\nupon it, and perceiving it did not stir, I presently concluded it must\r\nbe a ship at anchor, and so very hasty I was to be satisfied, that\r\ntaking the gun, I went to the S.E. part of the island, to the same rocks\r\nwhere I had been formerly drove away by the current, in which time the\r\nweather being perfectly cleared up, to my great sorrow, I perceived the\r\nwreck of a ship cast away upon those hidden rocks I found when I was out\r\nwith my boat; and which, by making a kind of an eddy, were the occasion\r\nof my preservation.\r\n\r\nThus, _what is one man's safety is another's ruin_; for undoubtedly this\r\nship had been driven on them in the night, the wind blowing strong at\r\nE.N.E. Had they perceived the island, as I now guessed they had not,\r\ncertainly, instead of firing there guns for help, they would rather have\r\nventured in their boat and saved themselves that way. I then thought,\r\nthat perhaps they had done so, upon seeing my fire, and were cast away\r\nin the attempt: for I perceived no boat in the ship. But then I again\r\nimagined, that, perhaps, they had another vessel in company, which, upon\r\nsignal, saved their lives, and took the boat up: or that the boat might\r\nbe driven into the main ocean, where these poor creatures might be in\r\nthe most miserable condition. But as all these conjectures were very\r\nuncertain, I could do no more than commiserate there distress, and thank\r\nGod for delivering me, in particular, when so many perished in the\r\nraging ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen I considered seriously every thing concerning this wreck, and could\r\nperceive no room to suppose any of them saved, I cannot explain, by any\r\npossible force of words, what longings my soul felt on this occasion,\r\noften breaking out in this manner: _O that there had been but two or\r\nthree, nay even one person saved, that we might have lived together,\r\nconversed with, and comforted one another!_ and so much were my desires\r\nmoved, that when I repeated these words, _Oh! that there had been but\r\none!_ my hands would clench together, and my fingers press the palms of\r\nmy hands to close, that, had any soft thing been between, it would have\r\ncrushed it involuntarily, while my teeth would strike together, and set\r\nagainst each other so strong that it required some time for me to\r\npart them.\r\n\r\nTill the last year of my being on this island, I never knew whether or\r\nnot any had been saved out of this ship. I had the affliction, some time\r\nafter, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore, at the end of\r\nthe island which was next the shipwreck; there was nothing on him but a\r\nseaman's waistcoat, a pair of opened kneed linen drawers, and a blue\r\nlinen shirt, but no particular mark to guess what nation he was of. In\r\nhis pocket were two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe, the last of\r\nwhich I preferred much more than I did the first. And now the calmness\r\nof the sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck, not only\r\nto get something necessary out of the ship, but perhaps, some living\r\ncreature might be on board, whose life I might preserve. This had such\r\nan influence upon my mind, that immediately I went home, and prepared\r\nevery thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on board my boat\r\nprovisions of all sorts, with a good quantity of rum, fresh water, and a\r\ncompass: so putting off, I paddled the canoe along the shore, till I\r\ncame at last to the north-east part of the island, from whence I was to\r\nlaunch into the ocean; but here the currents ran so violently, and\r\nappeared so terrible, that my heart began to fail me; foreseeing that if\r\nI was driven into any of these currents, I might be carried not only out\r\nof reach or sight of the island, but even inevitably lost in the boiling\r\nsurges of the ocean.\r\n\r\nSo oppressed was I at these troubles, that I gave over my enterprize,\r\nsailing to a little creek on the shore, where stepping out, I set me\r\ndown on a rising hill, very pensive and thoughtful. I then perceived\r\nthat the tide was turned; and the flood came on, which made it\r\nimpracticable for me to go out for so many hours. To be more certain how\r\nthe sets of the tides or currents lay when the flood came in, I ascended\r\na higher piece of ground, which overlooked the sea both ways; and here I\r\nfound that as the current of the ebb set out close by the south point of\r\nthe island, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the\r\nnorth side; and all that I had to do was to keep to the north of the\r\nisland in my return.\r\n\r\nThat night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with my watch coat,\r\ninstead of a blanket, the heavens being my tester. I set out with the\r\nfirst of the tide full north, till I felt the benefit of the current,\r\nwhich carried me at a great rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity\r\nas before, as to take from me all government of my canoe; so that in two\r\nhours time I came up to the wreck, which appeared to me a most\r\nmelancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanish vessel by its building,\r\nstuck fast between two rocks; her stern and quarter beaten to pieces by\r\nthe sea; her mainmast and foremast were brought off by the board, that\r\nis broken off short. As I approached near, I perceived a dog on board,\r\nwho seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and no sooner did I call him,\r\nbut the poor creature jumped into the sea, out of which I took him up,\r\nalmost famished with hunger and thirst; so that when I gave him a cake\r\nof bread, no ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily; and he drank\r\nto that degree of fresh water, that he would have burst himself, had I\r\nsuffered him.\r\n\r\nThe first sight I met with in the ship, were two men drowned in the\r\ncook-room or forecastle, inclosed in one another's arms: hence I very\r\nprobably supposed, that _when the vessel struck in the storm, so high\r\nand incessantly did the waters break in and over her, that the men not\r\nbeing able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing in of the\r\nwaves_. There were several casks of liquor, whether wine of brandy, I\r\ncould not be positive, which lay in the lower hold, as were plainly\r\nperceptible by the ebbing out of the water, yet were too large for me to\r\npretend to meddle with; likewise I perceived several chests, which I\r\nsupposed to belong to the seamen, two of which I got into my boat,\r\nwithout examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been\r\nfixed, and the forepart broken off, I should have made a very prosperous\r\nvoyage; since by what I after found in these two chests, I could not\r\notherwise conclude, but that the ship must have abundance of wealth on\r\nboard; nay, if I must guess by the course she steered, she must have\r\nbeen bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the\r\nsouthern parts of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the\r\ngulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. What became of the rest of the\r\nsailors, I could not certainly tell; and all her riches signified\r\nnothing at that time to any body.\r\n\r\nSearching farther, I found a cask containing about twenty gallons, full\r\nof liquor, which, with some labour, I got into my boat; in her cabin\r\nwere several muskets, which I let remain there; but took away with me a\r\ngreat powder horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. I took also a\r\nfire-shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to make\r\nchocolate, and a gridiron; all which were extremely necessary to me,\r\nespecially the fire-shovel and tongs. And so with this cargo,\r\naccompanied with my dog, I came away, the tide serving for that purpose;\r\nand the same evening, about an hour within night, I attained the island,\r\nafter the greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.\r\n\r\nThat night I reposed my wearied limbs in the boat, resolving the next\r\nmorning to harbour what I had gotten in my new-found subterraneous\r\ngrotto; & not to carry my cargo home to my ancient castle. Having\r\nrefreshed myself, and got all my effects on shore I next proceeded to\r\nexamine the particulars; and so tapping the cask, I found the liquor to\r\nbe a kind of rum, but not like what we had at the Brazils, nor indeed\r\nnear so good. At the opening of the chest, several things appeared very\r\nuseful to me; for instance, I found in one a very fine case of bottles,\r\ncontaining the finest and best sorts of cordial waters; each bottle held\r\nabout three pints, curiously tip with silver. I found also two pots full\r\nof the choicest sweetmeats, and two more which the water had utterly\r\nspoiled. There were likewise several good shirts exceedingly welcome to\r\nme, and about one dozen and a half white linen handkerchiefs and\r\ncoloured neckcloths, the former of which was absolutely necessary for\r\nwiping my face in a hot day; and, in the till, I found three bags of\r\npieces of eight, about eleven hundred in all, in one of which, decently\r\nwrapped up in a piece of paper, were six doubloons of gold, and some\r\nsmall bars and wedges of the same metal, which I believe might weigh\r\nnear a pound. In the other chest, which I guessed to belong to the\r\ngunner's mate, by the mean circumstances which attended it, I found only\r\nsome clothes of very little value, except about two pounds of fine\r\nglazed powder, in three flasks, kept, as I believe, for charging their\r\nfowling pieces on any occasion; so that, on the whole, I had no great\r\nadvantage by this voyage. The money was indeed as mere dirt to me,\r\nuseless and unprofitable, all which I would freely have parted with for\r\ntwo or three pair of English shoes and stockings; things that for many\r\nyears I had not worn, except lately those which I had taken of the feet\r\nof those unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, yet not so good\r\nas English shoes either for ease or service. I also found in the\r\nseaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold; so\r\nconcluded that what I took from the first belonged to an officer, the\r\nlatter appearing to have a much inferior person for its owner. However,\r\nas despicable as the money seemed, I likewise lugged it to my cave,\r\nlaying it up securely, as I did the rest of my cargo; and after I had\r\ndone all this, I returned back to my boat, rowing and paddling her along\r\ntill I came to my old harbour, where I carefully laid her up, and so\r\nmade the best of my way to my castle. When I arrived there, every thing\r\nseemed safe and quiet: so that now my only business was to repose myself\r\nafter my wonted manner, and take care of my domestic affairs. But though\r\nI might have lived very easy, as wanting nothing absolutely needful, yet\r\nstill I was more vigilant than usual upon account of the savages, never\r\ngoing much abroad; or, if I did, it was to the east part of the island,\r\nwhere I was well assured that the savages never came, and where I might\r\nnot be troubled to carry that heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I\r\nwas obliged to do if I went the other way.\r\n\r\nTwo years did I live in this anxious condition, in all which time,\r\ncontrary to my former resolutions, my head was filled with nothing but\r\nprojects and designs, how I might escape from this island; and so much\r\nwere my wandering thoughts bent upon a rambling disposition that had I\r\nhad the same boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured\r\nonce more to the uncertainty of the raging ocean.\r\n\r\nI cannot, however, but consider myself as one of the unhappy persons,\r\nwho make themselves wretched by there dissatisfaction with the stations\r\nwhich God has placed them in; for, not to take a review of my primitive\r\ncondition, and my father's excellent advice, the going contrary to which\r\nwas, as I may say, my original sin, the following mistakes of the same\r\nnature certainly had been the means of my present unhappy station. What\r\nbusiness had I to leave a settled fortune, and well stocked plantation,\r\nimproving and increasing, where, by this time, I might have been worth a\r\nhundred thousand moidores, to turn supercargo to Guinea, to fetch\r\nNegroes, when time and patience would so much enlarge my stock at home,\r\nas to be able to employ those whose more immediate business it was to\r\nfetch them home even to my door?\r\n\r\nBut as this is commonly the fate of young heads, so a serious reflection\r\nupon the folly of it ordinarily attends the exercise of future years,\r\nwhen the dear bought experience of time teaches us repentance. Thus was\r\nit with me; but not withstanding the thoughts of my deliverance ran so\r\nstrongly in my mind, that is seemed to check all the dictates of reason\r\nand philosophy. And now to usher in my kind reader with greater pleasure\r\nto the remaining part of my relation, I flatter myself it will not be\r\ntaken amiss, to give him an account of my first conceptions of the\r\nmanner of escaping, and upon what foundation I laid my foolish schemes.\r\n\r\nHaving retired to my castle, after my late voyage to the ship, my\r\nfrigate laid up and secured, as usual, and my condition the same as\r\nbefore, except being richer, though I had as little occasion for riches\r\nas the Indians of Peru had for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came\r\namong them: One night in March, being the rainy season in the four and\r\ntwentieth year of my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very well in health,\r\nwithout distemper pain, or uncommon uneasiness, either of body or mind;\r\nyet notwithstanding, I could not compose myself to sleep all the night\r\nlong. All this tedious while, it is impossible to express what\r\ninnumerable thoughts came into my head. _I traced quite over the whole\r\nhistory of my life in miniature, from my utmost remembrance of things\r\ntill I came to this island, and then proceeded to examine every action\r\nand passage that had occurred since I had taken possession of my\r\nkingdom._ In my reflections upon the latter, I was _comparing the happy\r\nposture of my affairs from the beginning of my reign, to this life of\r\nanxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered a print of a foot in\r\nthe sand; that while I continued without apprehension, I was incapable\r\nof feeling the dread and terror I now suffered._ How thankful rather\r\nought I to have been for the knowledge of my danger, since the greatest\r\nhappiness one can be possessed of is to have sufficient time to provide\r\nagainst it? How stupendous is the goodness of Providence, which sets\r\nsuch narrow bounds to the sight and knowledge of human nature, that\r\nwhile men walk in the midst of so many dangers they are kept serene and\r\ncalm, by having the events of things hid from their eyes and knowing\r\nnothing of those many dangers that surround them, till perhaps they are\r\ndissipated and vanish away.\r\n\r\nWhen I came more particularly to considerer of _the real danger I had\r\nfor so many years escaped; how I had walked about in the greatest\r\nsecurity and tranquility, at a time, perhaps, when even nothing but the\r\nbrow of a hill, a great tree, or the common approach of night, had\r\ninterposed between me and the destructive hands of the cannibals, who\r\nwould devour me with as good an appetite, as I would a pigeon or\r\ncurlew;_ surely all this, I say, could not but make me sincerely\r\nthankful to my great Preserver, whose singular protection I acknowledge\r\nwith the greatest humility, and without which I must inevitably have\r\nfallen into the cruel hands of those devourers.\r\n\r\nHaving thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest manner, according to\r\nmy weak understanding, I next proceeded to consider _the wretched nature\r\nof those destroying savages, by seeming, though with great reverence,_\r\nto enquire _why God should give up any of his creatures to such\r\ninhumanity, even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind?_ but as\r\nthis was rather matter of obstruse speculation, and as my miserable\r\nsituation made me think this of mine the most uncomfortable situation in\r\nthe world, I then began rather to inquire _what part of the world these\r\nwretches lived in; how far off the coast was from whence they came; why\r\nthey ventured over so far from home; what kind of boats conveyed them\r\nhither; and why I could not order myself and my business so, that I\r\nmight be able to attack their country, as they were to come to\r\nmy kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut then_ thought I, _how shall I manage myself when I come thither?\r\nwhat will become of me if I fall into the hands of the savages? or how\r\nshall I escape from them if they make an attempt upon me? and supposing\r\nI should not fall into their power, what shall I do for provisions, or\r\nwhich way shall I bend my course?_ These counter thoughts threw me into\r\nthe greatest horror and confusion imaginable; but then I still looked\r\nupon my present condition to be the most miserable that possibly could\r\nbe, and that nothing could be worse, except death _For_ (thought I)\r\n_could I but attain the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with\r\nsome reliefs, or coast it along, as I did with my boy Xury, on the\r\nAfrican shore, till I came to some inhabited country, where I might meet\r\nwith some relief, or fall in with some Christian ship that might take me\r\nin; and if I failed, why then I could but meet with death, which would\r\nput an end to all my miseries._ These thoughts, I must confess, were the\r\nfruit of a distempered mind and impatient temper made desperate, as it\r\nwere, by long continuance of the troubles and disappointments I had met\r\nwith in the wreck; where I hoped to have found some living person to\r\nspeak to, by whom I might have known in what place I was, and of the\r\nprobable means of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated,\r\nmy resignation to the will of heaven was entirely suspended; to that I\r\nhad no power to fix my mind to any thing, but to the project of a voyage\r\nto the main land. And indeed so much was I inflamed upon this account,\r\nthat it set my blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat high, as though I\r\nhad been in a fever; till nature being, as it were, fatigued and\r\nexhausted with the thoughts of it, made me submit myself to a\r\nsilent repose.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation, it is very strange, that I did not dream of what I\r\nwas so intent upon; but, instead of it, my mind roved on a quite\r\ndifferent thing, altogether foreign. I dreamed, that as I was issuing\r\nfrom my castle one morning, as customary, when I perceived upon the\r\nshore two canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, who had brought\r\nwith them another Indian, whom they designed to make a sacrifice of, in\r\norder to devour; but just as they were going to give the fatal blow,\r\nmethought the poor designed victim jumped away, and ran directly into my\r\nlittle thick grove before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies,\r\nwhen perceiving that the others did not follow him that way, I appeared\r\nto him; that he humbly kneeled down before me, seeming to pray for my\r\nassistance; upon which I showed him my ladder, made him ascend, carried\r\nhim to my cave, and he became my servant; and when I had gotten this\r\nman, I said to myself, _now surely I may have some hopes to attain the\r\nmain land; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, tell me what to do,\r\nand where I must go for provisions, what places to shun, what to venture\r\nto, and what to escape._ But when I awaked, and found all these\r\ninexpressible impressions of joy entirely vanished, I fell into the\r\ngreatest dejection of spirit imaginable.\r\n\r\nYet this dream brought me to reflect, that one sure way of escaping was\r\nto get a savage; that after I had ventured my life to deliver him from\r\nthe bloody jaws of his devourers, the natural sense he might have of\r\nsuch a preservation, might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and most\r\nsincere affection. But then this objection reasonably interposed: _how\r\ncan I effect this,_ thought I, _without I attack a whole company of\r\nthem, and kill them all? why should I proceed on such a desperate\r\nattempt, which my scruples before had suggested to be unlawful?_ and\r\nindeed my heart trembled at the thoughts of so much blood, though it\r\nwere a means to procure my deliverance. 'Tis true, I might reasonably\r\nenough suppose these men to be real enemies to my life, men who would\r\ndevour me, was it in their power, so that it was self preservation in\r\nthe highest degree to free myself, by attacking them in my own defence,\r\nas lawfully as if they were actually assaulting me: though all these\r\nthings, I say, seemed to me to be of the greatest weight, yet, as I just\r\nsaid before, the dreadful thoughts of shedding human blood, struck such\r\na terror to my soul, that it was a long time before I could reconcile\r\nmyself to it.\r\n\r\nBut how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on? For notwithstanding\r\nthe many disputes and perplexities I had with myself, I at length\r\nresolved, right or wrong, to get one of these savages into my hands,\r\ncost what it would, or even though I should lose my life in the attempt.\r\nInspired with this firm resolution, I set all my wits at work, to find\r\nout what methods I should take to answer my design: this, indeed, was so\r\ndifficult a task, that I could not pitch upon any probable means to\r\nexecute it: I, therefore, resolved continually to be in a vigilant\r\nposture, to perceive when the savages came on shore and to leave the\r\nrest to the event, let the opportunities offer as they would.\r\n\r\nSuch was my fixed resolutions; and accordingly I set myself upon the\r\nscout, as often as I could, till such time as I was heartily tired of\r\nit. I waited for above a year and a half, the greatest part of which I\r\nwent out to the west, and south-west corner of the island, almost every\r\nday, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was a very great\r\ndiscouragement; yet, though I was very much concerned, the edge of my\r\ndesign was as keen as ever, and the longer it seemed to be delayed, the\r\nmore eager was I for it: in a word, I never before was so careful to\r\nshun the loathing sight of these savages, as I was now eager to be with\r\nthem; and I thought myself sufficiently able to manage one, two, or\r\nthree savages if I had them, so as to make them my entire slaves, to do\r\nwhatsoever I should direct them, and prevent their being able at any\r\ntime to do me any mischief. Many times did I used to please myself with\r\nthese thoughts, with long and ardent expectations; but nothing\r\npresenting, all my deep projected schemes and numerous fancies vanished\r\naway, as though, while I retained such thoughts, the decrees of\r\nProvidence was such, that no savages were to come near me.\r\n\r\nAbout a year and a half after, when I was seriously musing of sundry\r\nother ways how I should attain my end, one morning early I was very much\r\nsurprised by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together, on\r\nmy side the island, and the savages that belonged to them all landed,\r\nand out of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted all my measures;\r\nfor, seeing so many boats, each of which would contain six, and\r\nsometimes more, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to order my\r\nmeasures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; upon which, much\r\ndispirited and perplexed, I lay still in my castle; which, however, I\r\nput in a proper posture for an attack: and, having formerly provided all\r\nthat was necessary, was soon ready to enter upon an engagement, should\r\nthey attempt. Having waited for some time, my impatient temper would let\r\nme bear it no longer; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as\r\nusual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two stages, standing,\r\nhowever, in such a manner, that my head did not appear above the hill,\r\nso that they could easily perceive me; and here, by the assistance of my\r\nperspective glass, I observed no less than thirty in number around a\r\nfire, feasting upon what meat they had dressed: how they cooked it, or\r\nwhat it was, I could not then perfectly tell; but they were all dancing\r\nand capering about the flames, using many frightful and\r\nbarbarous gestures.\r\n\r\nBut while, with a curious eye, I was beholding these wretches, my\r\nspirits sunk within me, when I perceived them drag two miserable\r\ncreatures from the boats, to act afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I\r\nsupposed they had done before. It was not long before one of them fell\r\nupon the ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with a club or wooden\r\nsword, for that was their manner; while two or three others went\r\nimmediately to work, cutting him open for their cookery, and then fell\r\nto devour him as they had done the former, while the last unhappy\r\ncaptive was left by himself, till such time as they were ready for him.\r\nThe poor creature looked round him with a wishful eye, trembling at the\r\nthoughts of death; yet, seeing himself a little at liberty, nature, that\r\nvery moment, as it were, inspired him with hopes of life: He started\r\naway from them, and ran, with incredible swiftness along the sands,\r\ndirectly to that part of the coast where my ancient and venerable\r\ncastle stood.\r\n\r\nYou may well imagine, I was dreadfully affrighted upon this occasion,\r\nwhen, as I thought, they pursued him in a whole body, all running\r\ntowards my palace. And now, indeed, I expected that part of my dream was\r\ngoing to be fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly to my grove for\r\nprotection; but, for the rest of my dream, I could depend nothing on it;\r\nthat the savages would pursue him thither, and find him there. However\r\nmy spirits, beginning to recover, I still kept upon my guard; and I now\r\nplainly perceived, there were but three men out of the number that\r\npursued him. I was infinitely pleased with what swiftness the poor\r\ncreature ran from his pursuers, gaining so much ground upon them, that I\r\nplainly perceived, could he thus hold out for half an hour, there was\r\nnot the least doubt but he would save his life from the power of\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\nBetween them and my castle there was a creek, that very same which I\r\nsailed into with all my effects from the wreck of the ship on the steep\r\nbanks of which I very much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he\r\ncould not swim for his escape: but soon was I out of pain for him, when\r\nI perceived he made nothing of it, though at full tide, but with an\r\nintrepid courage, spurred on by the sense of danger, he plunged into the\r\nflood, swimming over in about thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with\r\nthe same incredible strength and swiftness as before. When the three\r\npursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I perceived could not swim,\r\nhappily for his part, returned to his company, while the others, with\r\nequal courage, but much less swiftness attained the other side, as\r\nthough they were resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now or or\r\nnever I thought was the time for me to procure me a servant, companion,\r\nor assistant; and that I was decreed by Providence to be the instrument\r\nto save this poor creature's life. I immediately descended my two\r\nladders with the greatest expedition: I took up my two guns, which, I\r\nsaid before, were at the bottom of them, and getting up again with the\r\nsame haste towards the hill, I made nearer the sea. In a word, taking a\r\nshort cut down the hill, I interposed between the pursuers and pursued,\r\nhallooing aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back, was, no\r\ndoubt, as much terrified at me as I at them. I beckoned to him with my\r\nhand, to return back, in the mean time advancing towards the pursuers,\r\nand rushing on the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my\r\npiece, and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to fire\r\nlest the rest should hear, though at a distance, I question whether they\r\ncould or no; and being out of sight of the smoke, they could not easily\r\nhave known what to make of it. The other savage seeing his fellow fall,\r\nstopped as if he had been amazed; when advancing towards him, I could\r\nperceive him take his bow from his back, and, fixing and arrow to it,\r\nwas preparing to shoot at me, and, without dispute, might have lodged\r\nthe arrow in my breast; but, in this absolutely necessary case of self\r\npreservation, I immediately fired at him, and shot him dead, just as his\r\nhand was going to draw the fatal string. All this while, the savage who\r\nhad fled before stood still, and had the satisfaction to see his enemies\r\nkilled, as he thought, who designed to take away his life; so affrighted\r\nwas he with the fire and noise of my piece, _that he stood as it were\r\nlike Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without either sense or motion_.\r\nThis obliged me to halloo to him again, making the plainest signs I\r\ncould to him to draw nearer. I perceived he understood those tokens by\r\nhis approaching to me a little way, when, as is afraid I should kill him\r\ntoo, he stopped again. Several times did he advance, as often stop in\r\nthis manner, till coming more, to my view, I perceived him trembling, as\r\nif he was to undergo the same fate. Upon which I looked upon him with a\r\nsmiling countenance, and still beckoning to him, at length he came close\r\nto me and kneeled down, kissed my hand, laid his head upon it, and\r\ntaking me by the foot, placed it upon his head; and this, as I\r\nunderstood afterwards, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever.\r\nI took him up, and, making much of him, encouraged him in the best\r\nmanner I could. But my work was not yet finished; for I perceived the\r\nsavage whom I knocked down, was not killed, but stunned with the blow,\r\nand began to come to himself, Upon which I pointed to my new servant,\r\nand shewed him that his enemy was not yet expired, he spoke some words\r\nto me, but which I could not understand; yet being the first sound of a\r\nman's voice I had heard for above twenty-five years, they were very\r\npleasing to me. But there was no time for reflection now, the wounded\r\nsavage recovering himself so far as to sit upon the ground, which made\r\nmy poor prisoner as much afraid as before; to put him out of which fear,\r\nI presented my other gun at the man, with an intent to shoot him; but my\r\nsavage, for so I must now call him, prevented my firing, by making a\r\nmotion to me, to lend him my sword, which hung naked in my belt by my\r\nside. No sooner did I grant his request, but away he runs to his enemy,\r\nand at one blow cut off his head as dextrously as the most accomplished\r\nexecutioner in Germany could have done; for, it seems, these creatures\r\nmake use of wooden swords made of hard wood which will bear edge enough\r\nto cut off heads and arms at one blow. When this valorous exploit was\r\ndone, he comes to me laughing, as a token of triumph, delivered me my\r\nsword again, with abundance of suprising gestures, laying it, along with\r\nthe bleeding and ghastly head of the Indian, at my feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON CRUSOE rescuing FRIDAY from his pursuers.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest astonishment that my new servant conceived was the manner\r\nof killing the savage at such a distance, without a bow and arrow; and\r\nsuch was his longing desire to know it, that he first pointed to the\r\ndead carcase, and then made signs to me to grant him leave to go up to\r\nhim. Upon which I bid him go, and, as well as I could, made him sensible\r\nI granted his request. But when he came there, how wonderfully was he\r\nstruck with amazement! First, he turned him on one side, then on\r\nanother, wondering he could perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding\r\ninwardly; and after sufficiently admiring the wound the bullet had made\r\nin his breast, he took up his bow and arrows, and came back again; upon\r\nwhich I turned to go away, making signs to him to follow, left the rest\r\nmissing their companions, might come in pursuit of them, and this I\r\nfound he understood very well, by his making me understand that his\r\ndesign was to bury them, that they might not be seen if it happened; and\r\nwhich by signs again I made him sensible I very much approved of.\r\nImmediately he fell to work, and never was a grave-digger more dextrous\r\nin the world than he was; for in an instant, as I might say, he scraped\r\na large hole in the sand with his hands, sufficient to bury the first\r\nin; there he dragged him; and without any ceremony he covered him over;\r\nin like manner he saved the other; so that I am sure no undertaker could\r\nbe more expert in his business, for all this was done in less than a\r\nquarter of an hour. I then called him away, and instead of carrying him\r\ndirectly to my castle at first, I conveyed him to my cave on the farther\r\npart of the island; and so my dream was now fulfilled in that\r\nparticular, that my grove should prove an asylum or sanctuary to him.\r\n\r\nWeary and faint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must this poor creature\r\nbe, supported chiefly by the vivacity of spirit, and, uncommon\r\ntransports of joy that his deliverance occasioned. Here I gave him bread\r\nand a bunch of raisins to eat, and water to drink, on which he fed very\r\ncheerfully, to his exceeding refreshment. I then made him a convenient\r\nbed with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, (a bed which I\r\nused myself sometimes) and then pointing to it, made signs for him to\r\nlie down to sleep, upon which the poor creature went to take a\r\nwelcome repose.\r\n\r\nIndeed he was a very comely, handsome, young fellow, extremely well\r\nmade, with straight long limbs, not too large, but tall and well shaped,\r\nand, as near as I could reckon, about twenty-six years of age. His\r\ncountenance had nothing in it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of\r\nmajesty in his face; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had all the\r\nsweetness and softness of an European. His hair was not curled like\r\nwool, as many of the blacks are, but long and black, with the most\r\nbeautiful, yet careless tresses spreading over his shoulders. He had a\r\nvery high and large forehead, with a great vivacity and sparkling\r\nsharpness in his eyes. His skin was not so tawney, as the Virginians,\r\nBrazilians, or other Americans; but rather of a bright dun, olive\r\ncolour, that had something agreeable in it, though not very easy to give\r\na description of. His face was round and plump, with a small nose, very\r\ndifferent from the flatness of the negroes, a pretty small mouth, thin\r\nlips, fine teeth, very well set, and white as the driven snow. In a\r\nword, such handsome features, and exact symmetry in every part, made me\r\nconsider that I had saved the life of an Indian prince, no less graceful\r\nand accomplished than the great _Oroonoko_ whose memorable behavior and\r\nunhappy contingencies of life have charmed the world, both to admiration\r\nof his person, and compassion to his sufferings.\r\n\r\nBut let him be either prince or peasant, all my happiness centered in\r\nthis, that I had now got a good servant or companion, to whom, as he\r\ndeserved, I was resolved to prove a kind master and a lasting friend. He\r\nhad not, I think, slept above an hour when he awakened again, and while\r\nI was milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards me in\r\nmy inclosure, and laying himself down on the ground, in the lowest\r\nprostration, made all the antic gestures imaginable, to express his\r\nthankfulness to me for being his deliverer. I confess though the manner\r\nof his behaviour seemed to be ludicrous enough to occasion, laughter,\r\nyet I was very much moved at his affection, so that my heart melted\r\nwithin me, fearing he might die away in excess of joy, like reprieved\r\nmalefactors, especially as I was incapable either to let him blood, or\r\nadminister physic. It were to be wished, that Christians would take\r\nexample by this Heathen, to have received by the kind mediation and\r\npowerful interposition of their benefactors and deliverers; and it would\r\nbe likewise happy for mankind, were there no occasion to blame many,\r\nwho, instead of thankfully acknowledging favours and benefits, rather\r\nabuse and condemn those who have been the instruments to save them from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nBut, leaving these just reflections, I return to the object that\r\noccasioned them; for my man, to conclude the last ceremony of obedience,\r\nlaid down his head again on the ground, close to my foot, and set my\r\nother foot upon is head, as he had done before, making all the signs of\r\nsubjection, servitude, and submission imaginable, and let me understand\r\nhe would serve me as long as his life endured. As I understood him in\r\nmany things, I made him sensible I was very well pleased with him; and,\r\nin a little time, I began to speak to him, and learn him to talk to me\r\nagain. In the first place, I made him understand his name was to be\r\n_Friday_, because it was upon that day I saved his life; then I taught\r\nhim to say _Master_, which I made him sensible was to be my name. I\r\nlikewise taught him to say _Yes_ and _No_, and to know what they meant.\r\nI gave him some milk in an earthen pot, making him view me while I drank\r\nit before him, and soaked my bread in it; I gave him a cake of bread,\r\nand caused him to soak it likewise, to which he readily consented,\r\nmaking signs of the greatest satisfaction imaginable.\r\n\r\nAll that night did I keep him there; but no sooner did the morning light\r\nappear, when I ordered him to arise, and come along with me, with\r\ncertain tokens that I would give him some clothes like mine, at which he\r\nseemed very glad, being stark naked, without the least covering\r\nwhatever. As we passed by the place where the two men had been interred,\r\nmy man pointed directly to their graves, showing me the marks that he\r\nhad made to find them again, giving me to understand, by signs, that we\r\nshould dig them up, and devour them. At this I appeared extremely\r\ndispleased, expressed my utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the\r\napprehensions of it, beckoning with my hand to come away, which he did\r\nwith the greatest reverence and submission. After this I conducted him\r\nto the top of the hill, to view if the rest of the savages were yet\r\nremaining there; but when I looked through my perspective glass, I could\r\nsee no appearance of them, nor of their canoes; so that it was evident\r\nthey never minded their deceased companions whom we had slain: which if\r\nthey had, they would surely have searched for, or left one boat behind\r\nfor them to follow, after they returned from their pursuit.\r\n\r\nCuriosity, and a desire of satisfaction, animating me with courage to\r\nsee this scene of barbarity, I took my man Friday with me, putting a\r\nsword into his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I\r\nperceived he could use very dexterously, causing him to carry one gun\r\nfor me, and I two for myself; and thus equipped against all attacks,\r\naway we marched directly to the place of their bloody entertainment. But\r\nwhen I came there, I was struck with the utmost horror at so dreadful a\r\nspectacle, whilst Friday was no way concerned about it, being no doubt\r\nin his turn one of these devourers. Here lay several human bones, there\r\nseveral pieces of mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled, and scorched,\r\nwhilst streams of blood ran promiscuously as waters from a fountain. As\r\nI was musing on this dreadful sight, Friday took all the pains he could,\r\nby particular signs, to make me understand, that they had brought over\r\nfour prisoners to feast upon, three of whom they had eaten up, and that\r\nhe was the fourth, pointing to himself; that there having been a bloody\r\nbattle between them and his great king, in the just defence of whom he\r\nwas taken prisoner, with many others; all of these were carried off to\r\ndifferent places to be devoured by their conquerors; and that it was his\r\nmisfortune to be brought hither by these wretches for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter I was made sensible of these things, I caused Friday to gather\r\nthose horrid remains, and lay them together upon a heap, which I ordered\r\nto be set on fire, and burnt them to ashes: My man, however, still\r\nretained the nature of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach after some\r\nof the flesh; but such an extreme abhorrence did I express at the least\r\nappearance of it, that he durst not but conceal it; for I made him very\r\nsensible, that if he offered any such thing, I would certainly\r\nshoot him.\r\n\r\nThis being done, I carried my man with me to my castle, and gave him a\r\npair of linen drawers, which I had taken out of the poor gunner's chest\r\nbefore mentioned; and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very\r\nwell; in the next place I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, such as my\r\nskill was able to manage, and indeed I thought myself then a tolerable\r\ngood tailor. I gave him also a cap which I made of a hare's skin, very\r\nconvenient and fashionable. Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man\r\nwas no less proud of his habit, than I was at seeing him in it. Indeed\r\nhe went very aukwardly at first, the drawers being too heavy on his\r\nthighs not used to bear any weight, and the sleeves of the waistcoat\r\ngalled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but by a little easing\r\nwhere he complained they hurt him, and by using himself to them, at\r\nlength he took to them very well.\r\n\r\nMy next concern was, where I should lodge him; and that I might do well\r\nby him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I erected a tent for him in\r\nthe vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the\r\nlast, and the outside of the first; and, as there was an entrance or\r\ndoor into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to open\r\non the inside; I barred it up in the night time, taking in my ladders\r\ntoo, so that, was my man to prove treacherous, there could be no way to\r\ncome at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much\r\nnoise in getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my first wall\r\nhad now a complete roof over it of long poles, spreading over my tent,\r\nand leaning up to the side of the mountain, which was again laid cross\r\nwith smaller sticks instead of laths, and thatched over a great\r\nthickness with the rice straw, which was as strong as reeds; and at the\r\nhole of the place, left on purpose to go in or out by the ladder, had\r\nplaced a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the\r\noutside, would not have opened at all, but have fallen down, and made a\r\ngreat noise; and as to my weapons, every night I took them all to my\r\nbed side.\r\n\r\nBut there was no occasion for this precaution; for surely never master\r\nhad a more sincere, faithful, and loving servant, than Friday proved to\r\nme. Without passion, sullenness, or design, perfectly obliging and\r\nengaging, his affections were as much tied to me, as those of a child to\r\nits parents; & I might venture to say, he would have sacrificed his life\r\nfor the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever. And indeed the many\r\ntestimonies he gave me of this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no\r\noccasion to use these precautions. And here I could not but reflect with\r\ngreat wonder, that however it hath pleased the Almighty in his\r\nprovidence, and in the government of the creation, to take from so great\r\na part of the world of his creatures, the noblest uses to which their\r\nfaculties, and the powers of their souls are adapted; yet that he has\r\nbestowed upon them the same reason, affections, sentiments of kindness\r\nand obligation, passions of resentment, sincerity, fidelity, and all the\r\ncapacities of doing and receiving good that he has given us; and that\r\nwhen he is graciously pleased to offer them occasions of exerting these,\r\nthey are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper uses for\r\nwhich they were bestowed, than we often are. These thoughts would make\r\nme melancholy, especially when I considered how mean a use we make of\r\nall these, even though we have these powers enlightened by the Holy\r\nSpirit of God, and by the knowledge of this world, as an addition to our\r\nunderstanding; and why it has pleased the heavenly Wisdom to conceal the\r\nlife saving knowledge from so many millions of souls who would certainly\r\nmake a much better use of it than generally mankind do at this time.\r\nThese reflections would sometimes lead me so far, as to invade the\r\nsovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of such\r\nan arbitrary disposition of things, that should obscure that light from\r\nsome, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from all. But\r\nI closed it up, checking my thoughts with this conclusion; first, That\r\nwe were ignorant of that right and law by which those should be\r\ncondemned; but as the Almighty was necessarily, and by the nature of his\r\nessence, infinitely just and holy; so it could not be otherwise, but\r\nthat if these creatures were all destined to absence from himself, it\r\nwas on account of sinning against that light, _which_, as the Scripture\r\nsays, _was a law to themselves_ and by such rules as their consciences\r\nwould acknowledge to be just, though the first foundation was not\r\ndiscovered to us. And, secondly, That still as we were the clay in the\r\nhand of the potter, no vessel could thus say to him, _Why hast thou\r\nfashioned me after this manner_?\r\n\r\nI had not been above two or three days returned to my castle, but my\r\nchief design was, how I should bring Friday off from this horrid way of\r\nfeeding; and to take from him that inhuman relish he by nature had been\r\naccustomed to, I thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which\r\nmight the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so often expressed\r\nagainst their accursed way of living. Upon which, one morning I took him\r\nout with me, with an intention to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring\r\nit home and dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying down\r\nin the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Immediately I catched\r\nhold of my man Friday, and bidding him stand still, and not stir, I\r\npresented my piece, and shot one of the kids. My poor servant, who had\r\nat a distance perceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not know by\r\nwhat means, or how it was done, stood trembling and surprised, and\r\nlooked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk into the earth. He\r\ndid not see the kid I aimed at, or behold I had killed it, but ripped up\r\nhis waistcoat to see if he was not wounded, thinking my resolution was\r\nto kill him; for coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly\r\npronouncing many things which I did not understand the meaning of; which\r\nat length I perceived was, that I would not take away his life.\r\n\r\nIndeed I was much concerned to see him in that condition, where nature\r\nis upon the severest trial, when the immediate hand of death is ready to\r\nput for ever a period to this mortal life; and indeed so much compassion\r\nhad I to this creature, that it was with difficulty I restrained from\r\ntears. But, however, as another sort of countenance was necessary, and\r\nto convince him that I would do no harm, I took him smiling by the hand,\r\nthen laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had slain, made\r\nsigns to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less curious was\r\nhe in viewing how the creature was killed, than he had been before in\r\nbeholding the Indian; which, while he was admiring at, I charged my gun\r\nagain, and presently perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perching upon a\r\ntree within shot; and therefore, to let Friday understand what I was\r\ngoing to do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which I\r\nfound to be a parrot. I made him understand that I would shoot and kill\r\nthat bird; accordingly I fired, and bade him look, when immediately he\r\nsaw the parrot fall down. Again he stood like one amazed,\r\nnotwithstanding all I had said to him: and the more confounded he was,\r\nbecause he did not perceive me put any thing into my gun. Undoubtedly a\r\nthing so utterly strange, carrying death along with it, far or near,\r\neither to man or beast, must certainly create the greatest astonishment\r\nto one who never had heard such a thing in his whole life; and really\r\nhis amazement continued so long, that had I allowed it, he would have\r\nprostrated himself before me and my gun, with the greatest worship and\r\nadoration. As for the gun in particular, he would not so much as touch\r\nit for several days after, but would come & communicate his thoughts to\r\nit, & talk to it, as if the senseless piece had understood and answered\r\nhim; all this I could perceive him do, when he thought my back was\r\nturned, the chief intent of which was, to desire it not to kill him, as\r\nI afterwards came to understand.\r\n\r\nI never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him from those\r\ncomical gestures he used on such occasions; but when his astonishment\r\nwas a little over, I make tokens to him to run and fetch the parrot that\r\nI had shot; which accordingly he did, staying some time longer than\r\nusual, by reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some way\r\nfurther from the place where she fell. In the mean time, as he was\r\nlooking for her, I took the advantage of charging my gun again, that so\r\nI might be ready for any other mark that offered; but nothing more\r\noccurred at that time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening\r\ntook off the skin and divided the carcase as well as I could. Part of\r\nthe flesh I stewed and boiled in a pot I had for this purpose. And then\r\nspreading my table, I sat down, giving my man some of it to eat, who was\r\nwonderfully pleased and seemed to like it very well: but what was the\r\nmost surprising to him was to see me eat salt with it: upon which he\r\nmade me understand, that the salt was very bad for me; when putting a\r\nlittle into his mouth, he seemed to nauseate it in such a manner as to\r\nspit and sputter at it, and then washed his mouth with fresh water: but\r\nto shew him how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put some meat into\r\nmy mouth without salt and feigned to spit and sputter as much for the\r\nwant of it, as he had done at it; yet all this proved of no\r\nsignification to Friday; and it was a long while before he could endure\r\nsalt in his meat or broth, and even then but a small quantity.\r\n\r\nThus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and broth at that\r\ntime, the next day I was resolved to feast him with a roasted piece of\r\nthe kid. And having no spit to fasten it, nor jack to turn it, I made\r\nuse of that common artifice which many of the common people of England\r\nhave, that is to let two poles upon each side of the fire, and one cross\r\non top, hanging the meat thereon with a string, and so turning round\r\ncontinually, roast it, in the same manner as we read bloody tyrants of\r\nold cruelly roasted the holy martyrs. This practice caused great\r\nadmiration in my man Friday, being quite another way than that to which\r\nthe savages were accustomed. But when he came to taste the sweetness and\r\ntenderness of the flesh, he expressed his entire satisfaction above a\r\nthousand different ways. And as I could not but understand his meaning,\r\nyou may be sure I was as wonderfully pleased, especially when he made it\r\nalso very plain to me, that he would never, while he lived eat man's\r\nflesh more.\r\n\r\nIt was now high time I should set my servant to work; so next day I set\r\nhim to beat out some corn, and sat it in the same manner as I had done\r\nbefore. And really the fellow was very quick and handy in the execution\r\nof any thing I ordered him to go about. I made him understand that it\r\nwas to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him see me make it.\r\nIn short, he did every thing as I ordered him, and in a little time as\r\nwell as I could perform it myself.\r\n\r\nBut now considering that I had two mouths to feed instead of one, it was\r\nnecessary that I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a\r\nlarger quantity of corn than I commonly used to do; upon which I marked\r\nout a larger piece of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as I had\r\ndone before; in the execution of which I must give Friday this good\r\nword; that no man could work, more hardy or with better will than he\r\ndid: and when I made him sensible that it was for bread to serve him as\r\nwell as me, he then very passionately made me understand that he thought\r\nI had much more labour on his account, than I had for myself; and that\r\nno pains or diligence should be wanting in him, if I would but direct\r\nhim in those works wherein he might proceed.\r\n\r\nI must certainly own, that this was the most pleasant year I ever had on\r\nthe island; for after some time Friday began to talk pretty well, and\r\nunderstood the names of those things which I was wont to call for, and\r\nthe places where I used to send him. So that my long silent tongue,\r\nwhich had been useless so many years, except in an exclamatory manner,\r\neither for deliverance or blessings, now began to be occupied in\r\nteaching, and talking to my man Friday for indeed I had such a singular\r\nsatisfaction in the fellow himself, so innocent did his simple and\r\nunfeigned honesty appear more and more to me every day, that I really\r\nbegan entirely to love him; and for his part, I believe there was no\r\nlove lost, and that his nature had been more charmed by his exceeding\r\nkindness, and his affections more placed upon me, than any other object\r\nwhatsoever among his own countrymen. I once had a great mind to try if\r\nhe had any hankering inclination to his own country again; and by this\r\ntime, having learned the English so well; that he could give me\r\ntolerable answer to any question which I demanded. I asked him whether\r\nthat nation to which he belonged, ever conquered in battle? This\r\nquestion made Friday to smile, and to which he answered, _Yes, yes, we\r\nalways fight the better;_ as much as to say, they always got the better\r\nin fight. Upon which we proceeded on the following discourse: _You say_,\r\nsaid I, _that you always fight the better; why, then, Friday, how came\r\nyou to be taken prisoner_?\r\n\r\nFriday. _But for all that my nation beat much_.\r\n\r\nMaster. _How say you, beat? if your nation beat them, how came you to be\r\ntaken_?\r\n\r\nFriday. _They more many mans than my nation in the place where me was;\r\nthey take one, two, three, and me: my nation much over beat them in the\r\nyonder place where me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three,\r\ngreat tousand_.\r\n\r\nMaster. _Then why did not your men recover you from the hands of your\r\nenemies?_\r\n\r\nFriday. _They run one, two, or three, and me: they make all go in the\r\ncanoe; my nation have no canoe that time_--\r\n\r\nMaster. _'Tis very well, Friday; but what does your nation do with the\r\nprisoners they take? Do they carry them away and eat them as these\r\nhave done_?\r\n\r\nFriday. _Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up all_.\r\n\r\nMaster. _To what place do they carry them to be devoured_?\r\n\r\nFriday. _Go to other nations where they think_.\r\n\r\nMaster. _Do they bring them hither_?\r\n\r\nFriday. _Yes, come over hither, came over other place_.\r\n\r\nMaster. _And have you been with them here, Friday_?\r\n\r\nFriday. _Yes, me been here_, (pointing to the north-west of the island,\r\nbeing the side where they used to land.)\r\n\r\nThus having gotten what account I could from my man, I plainly\r\nunderstood that he had been as bad as any of the rest of the cannibals,\r\nhaving been formerly among the savages who used to come on shore on the\r\nfarthest part of the island, upon the same bloody occasion as he was\r\nbrought hither for; and some time after I carried him to that place\r\nwhere he pointed; and no sooner did he come there, but he presently knew\r\nthe ground, signifying to me that he was once there when they ate up\r\ntwenty men, two women and a young child; but as he could not explain the\r\nnumber in English, he did it by so many stones in a row, making a sign\r\nto me to count them.\r\n\r\nThis passage I have the rather mentioned, because it led to things more\r\nimportant and useful for me to know; for after I had this satisfactory\r\ndiscourse with him, my next question was, how far it was from the island\r\nto the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost in the ocean?\r\nto which he answered, _there was no danger, that no canoes were ever\r\nlost; but that after a little way out to the sea, there was a strong\r\ncurrent and a wind always one way in the afternoon_. This I thought at\r\nfirst to be no more than the sets of the tide, of going out or coming\r\nin; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great-draught\r\nand reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which I\r\nimagined my kingdom lay: and that the land which I perceived to the W.\r\nand N.W. must be the great island Trinidad, on the north of the river. A\r\nthousand questions (if that would satisfy me) did I ask Friday about the\r\nnature of the country, the sea, the coasts, the inhabitants, and what\r\nnations were nearest them: To which questions the poor fellow declared\r\nall he knew with the greatest openness & utmost sincerity. When I\r\ndemanded of him the particular names of the various nations of his sort\r\nof people, he could only answer me in general that they were called\r\n_Carrabee_. Hence it was I considered that these must be the Carribees,\r\nso much taken notice of by our maps to be on that part of America, which\r\nreaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and so on to St.\r\nMartha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, _that up a great way beyond\r\nthe moon_, as much as to say, beyond the setting of the moon, which must\r\nbe W. from their country, _there dwelt white-bearded men, such as I\r\nwas_, pointing to my whiskers, _and that they kill much mans_. I was not\r\nignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated these creatures; so\r\nthat I presently concluded it must be them, whose cruelties had spread\r\nthroughout America, to be remembered even to succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nWell, you may be sure, this knowledge, which the imperfect knowledge of\r\nmy man had led me to, was very comfortable to me, and made me so curious\r\nas to ask him how I might depart from this island, & get amongst those\r\nwhite men? He told me, _Yes, yes, I might go in two canoes_. In two\r\ncanoes, thought I, what does my man mean? surely he means one for\r\nhimself, and another for me; and if not, how must two canoes hold me\r\nwithout being joined, or one part of my body being put in one, and\r\nanother in another? And indeed it was a long time before I understood\r\nhis meaning; which was, that it must be a large boat, as big as two\r\ncanoes, able to bear with the waves, and not so liable to be overwhelmed\r\nas a small one must be.\r\n\r\nI believe there is not a state of life but what may be happy, if people\r\nwould but endeavour for their part to make it so. He is not the\r\nhappiest man that has the most riches; but he that is content with what\r\nhe hath. Before I had my servant, I thought myself miserable till I had\r\nhim; and now that I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I still\r\ncomplained, and begged a deliverance from a place of retirement, ease,\r\nand plenty, where Providence had sufficiently blessed me. In a word,\r\nfrom this time I entertained some hopes, that one time or other I might\r\nfind an opportunity to make my escape from this island, and that this\r\npoor savage might be a great furtherance thereto.\r\n\r\nAll the time since my man became so intelligent as to understand and\r\nspeak to me, I spared no pain nor diligence to instruct him, according\r\nto my poor share of knowledge in the principles of religion, and the\r\nadoration that he ought to pay to the TRUE GOD. One time, as I very well\r\nremember, I asked him who made him? At first the innocent creature did\r\nnot understand what I meant, but rather thought I asked him who was his\r\nfather? upon which I took another way to make him sensible, by demanding\r\nfrom him an answer to this question. \"Friday,\" I said, \"who is it that\r\nmade the sea, this ground whereon we walk, and all the hills and woods\r\nwhich we behold?\" And here, indeed, I did not miss my intention; for he\r\ntold me _it was Old Benamuckee_ (the God whom I supposed these savages\r\nadored) _who lived a great way beyond all_. But as to his attributes,\r\npoor Friday was an utter stranger. He could describe nothing of this\r\ngreat person; and all that he could say was, _that he was very old, much\r\nolder than the sea and land, the moon, or the stars_. \"Friday,\" said I\r\nagain, \"if this great and old person has made all things in the world,\r\nhow comes it to pass, that all things, as you in particular, do not\r\nadore and worship him? upon this looking very grave, with a perfect\r\nsweet look of innocence, he replied: _Master all things say O to him_,\"\r\nby which it may reasonably be supposed he meant adoration. \"And where,\"\r\nsaid I, \"do the people of your country go when they die?\" He answered\r\n_to Benamuckee_. \"What, and those people that are eaten up, do they go\r\nthere?\" _Benamuckee_, said he, _love 'em dearly; me pray to Benamuckee\r\nin the canoe, and Benamuckee would love me when dey eat me all up_.\r\n\r\nSuch discourses as these had I with my man, and such made me sensible,\r\nthat the true God is worshipped, tho' under imperfect similitudes; and\r\nthat the false adoration which the Heathens give to their imaginary\r\nDeity, is as great an argument of the divine essence, as the most\r\nlearned Atheists _(falsely so called)_ can bring against it; for God\r\nwill be glorified in his works, let their denominations be what it will;\r\nand I cannot be of that opinion which some conceive, that God should\r\ndecree men to be damned for want of a right notion of faith, in a place\r\nwhere the wisdom of the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached;\r\nand therefore cannot but conclude, that since obedience is the best\r\nsacrifice, these poor creatures are acting by that light and knowledge\r\nwhich they are possessed of, may undoubtedly obtain a happy salvation,\r\nthough not that enjoyment with Christ, as his saints, confessors, and\r\nmartyrs must enjoy.\r\n\r\nBut laying these determinations aside, more fit for divines than me to\r\ndiscuss, I began to instruct my servant in the saving knowledge of the\r\ntrue Deity, in which the direction of God's Holy Spirit assisted me. I\r\nlifted up my hands to Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him \"that the\r\ngreat Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there; that as his infinite power\r\nfashioned this world out of a confused chaos, and made it in that\r\nbeautiful frame which we behold; so he governs and preserves it by his\r\nunbounded knowledge, sovereign greatness and peculiar providence; that\r\nhe was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give every thing to us,\r\nand take every thing away from us; that he was a rewarder and punisher\r\nof good, and evil actions; that there was nothing but what he knew, no\r\nthoughts so secret, but what he could bring to light;\" and thus, by\r\ndegrees, I opened his eyes, and described to him \"the manner of the\r\ncreation of the world, the situation of paradise, the transgression of\r\nour first parents, the wickedness of God's peculiar people, and the\r\nuniversal sins and abominations of the whole earth.\" When these things\r\nwere implanted in his mind, I told him \"that as God's justice was equal\r\nto his mercy, he resolved to destroy this world, till his Son Jesus\r\nChrist interposed in our behalf; and to procure our redemption, obtained\r\nleave of his heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the world,\r\nWhere he took human nature upon him, instructed us in our way to eternal\r\nlife, and died as a sacrifice for our sins; that he was now ascended\r\ninto Heaven, mediating for our pardon, delivering our petitions, and\r\nobtaining all those good benefits which we ask in his name, by humble\r\nand hearty prayers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven.\" As\r\nfrequently I used to inculcate things into his mind. Friday one day told\r\nme, _that if our great God could hear us beyond the sun, he must surely\r\nbe a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off,\r\nyet could not hear them till they ascended the great mountains, where he\r\ndwelt to speak to him._ 'What' said I, 'Friday, did you go thither to\r\nspeak to him too?' He answered, _No, they never went that were young\r\nmen, none but old men, called their Oowakakee_, meaning the Indian\r\npriests, _who went to say O,_ (so he called saying their prayers) _and\r\nthey returned back, and told them what Benamuckee said._ From hence, I\r\ncould not but observe how happy we Christians are, who have God's\r\nimmediate revelation for our certain guide; and that our faith is\r\nneither misled, nor our reason imposed upon, by any set of men,\r\nsuch as these Indian impostures.\r\n\r\nBut to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday, I told\r\nhim, \"that the pretence of their ancient men going up to\r\nthe mountain to say O to their God _Benamuckee_ was an imposture,\r\nand that their bringing back an answer was all a sham, if\r\nnot worse; for that, if there was any such thing spoken to them,\r\nsurely it must proceed from an infernal spirit.\" And here I\r\nthought it necessary to enter into a long discourse with him,\r\nwhich I did after this manner.\r\n\r\n\"Friday,\" said I, \"you must know, that before the world\r\nwas made, there was an Almighty power existing, by whose\r\npower all things were made, and whose Majesty shall have no\r\nend. To be glorified and adored by beings of a heavenly nature,\r\nhe created angels and archangels, that is glorified spirits\r\nresembling himself, to encompass his throne, eternally singing\r\nforth his praise in the most heavenly sounds and divine harmony.\r\nAnd, among this heavenly choir, Lucifer bore a great sway, as being\r\nthen one of the peculiar favourites of these celestial abodes;\r\nbut he, contrary to that duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign,\r\nwith unbounded ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only\r\nenvied him that adoration which was his due, but thought to\r\nusurp that throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor\r\ntitle to pretend to. He raised a dissention and civil war in\r\nHeaven, and had a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded\r\nfolly! stupendous pride! to hope for victory, and aspire\r\nabove his powerful Creator! The Deity, not fearful of such\r\nan enemy, yet justly provoked at this rebellion, commissioned\r\nhis archangel Michael to lead forth the heavenly host, and give\r\nhim battle; the advantage of which was quickly perceived,\r\nby Satan's being overthrown, and the prince of the air, for so\r\nwas the devil called, with all his fallen angels, driven headlong\r\ninto a dismal place, which is called _Hell_.\"\r\n\r\nThe recital of this truth made my man give the greatest attention,\r\nand he expressed a great satisfaction by his gestures, that God\r\nhad sent the devil into a deep hole. And then I desired him to\r\ngive great heed to what I had further to say.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner,\" proceeded I, \"was God freed from, and the Heaven clear\r\nof this arch-traitor, but the Father speaks to the Son and Holy\r\nSpirit, who belonged to his essence, and were equal to him in power\r\nand glory, _Come let us make man_, said he _in our own image, after\r\nour own likeness_, Gen. i. 26. to have dominion over the creatures\r\nof the world which we have created. And these he intended should\r\nglorify him in Heaven, according to their obedience in this state of\r\nprobation on earth, which was, as it were, to be the school to train\r\nthem up for these heavenly mansions. Now, Satan seeing himself foiled;\r\nyet that God had taken the power from him as prince of the air, which\r\npower Heaven designed he should retain, whereby his creatures might\r\nbe tried; in revenge for the disgrace he had received, he tempts\r\nAdam's wife, Eve, to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and\r\nevil, which God had forbidden. He appears to her in the shape of a\r\nserpent, then a most beautiful creature, and tells her that it was no\r\nbetter than an imposition, which God had put upon her and her husband\r\nnot to eat of that fair fruit which he had created; that the taste\r\nthereof would make them immortal like God himself; and consequently as\r\ngreat and powerful as he. Upon which she not only eat thereof herself,\r\nbut made her husband eat also, which brought them both under the\r\nheavenly displeasure.\"\r\n\r\nHere Friday expressed a great concern: _Ah, poor mans!_ cried he,\r\n_naughty womans! naughty devil! make God not love de mans, made mans\r\nlike devil himself._\r\n\r\n'Friday,' said I, 'God still loved mankind, and though the devil tempted\r\nhuman nature so far, he would not suffer him to have an absolute power\r\nover them. I have told you before of his tender love to his people, till\r\nthey, like Lucifer, disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him; and\r\neven then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save sinners. But\r\nstill every man that lives in the world is under temptation and trial.\r\nThe devil has yet a power, as prince of the air, to suggest evil\r\ncogitations in our minds, and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he\r\nmight glory in our destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have, proceed\r\nfrom him; so that God in this our distress, expects we should apply\r\nourselves to him by fervent prayer for speedy redress. He is not like\r\n_Benamuckee,_ to let none come near him but _Oowakakee_, but suffers the\r\npeople as well as priests to offer themselves at his feet, thereby to be\r\ndelivered from the power and temptation of the devil.\r\n\r\nBut though at first my man Friday expressed some concern at the\r\nwickedness of Lucifer, I found it not so easy to imprint the right\r\nnotions of him in his mind, as it was about the divine essence of God;\r\nfor there nature assisted me in all my arguments, to show him plainly\r\nthe necessity of a great first cause, and over-ruling, governing power,\r\nof a secret directing Providence, and of the equity and reasonableness\r\nof paying adoration to our Creator: whereas there appeared nothing of\r\nall this in the notion of an evil spirit, of his first beginning, his\r\nnature, and, above all, of his inclination to evil actions, and his\r\npower to tempt us to the like. And indeed this unlearned _Indian_, by\r\nthe mere force of nature, puzzled me with one particular question, more\r\nthan ever I could have expected.\r\n\r\nI had, it seems, one day, been talking to him of the omnipotent power of\r\nGod, and his infinite abhorrence of sin, insomuch that the Scriptures\r\nstyled him _a consuming fire_ to all the workers of iniquity; and that\r\nit was in his power, whenever he pleased, to destroy all the world in a\r\nmoment, the greater part of which are continually offending him.\r\n\r\nWhen, with a serious attention, he had listened a great while to what\r\nI said, after I had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy in\r\nthe hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good\r\ndesigns of Providence, and destroy the kingdom of Christ in the world,\r\nand so forth: _Very well, Master_, said Friday, _you say God is so\r\nstrong, so great, is he not much strong, much mightier than the naughty\r\ndevil?_ \"To be sure, Friday,\" said I, \"God is more wise and stronger\r\nthan the serpent: he is above the devil, which makes us pray to him,\r\nthat he would tread down Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the\r\nviolent temptations; and quench his fiery darts.\" _Why then_, answered\r\nFriday quickly, _if God, as you say, has much strong, much might as the\r\ndevil, why God no kill devil, make no more tempt, no more do wicked._\r\n\r\nYou may be certain, I was strangely surprised at this question of my\r\nman's: and, though an old man, I was but a young doctor, and\r\nconsequently very ill qualified for a causuist, or a resolver of\r\nintricate doubts in religion, and as it required some time for me to\r\nstudy for an answer, I pretended not to hear him, nor to ask him what he\r\nsaid; but, to so earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his\r\nquestion which he repeated in the very same broken words as above. When\r\nI had recovered myself a little, \"Friday,\" said I, \"God will at last\r\npunish him severely, being reserved for judgment, and is to be cast into\r\nthe bottomless pit, to remain in fire everlasting.\" But all this did not\r\nsatisfy Friday, for, returning upon me, he repeated my words \"RESERVE AT\r\nLAST, _me no understand; but, why not kill devil now, not kill devil,\r\ngreat, great while ago_?\" \"Friday\" said I \"you may as well ask me why\r\nGod does not kill you and me, when, by our wicked actions, we so much\r\noffend his divine Majesty? He gives us time to repent of our sins, that\r\nthereby we may obtain pardon.\" At these words _obtain pardon_, Friday\r\nmused a great while; and, at last, looking me stedfastly in the face,\r\n_Well, well_, said he, _that's very well; so you, I, devil, all wicked\r\nmans, all preserve, repent, God pardon all._\r\n\r\nIndeed, here I was ran down to the last extremity, when it became very\r\nevident to me; how mere natural notions will guide reasonable creatures\r\nto the knowledge of a Deity, and to the homage due to the Supreme Being\r\nof God; but, however, nothing but divine revelation can form the\r\nknowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for us, of the\r\nmediator of the new covenant, and of an intercessor at the footstool of\r\nGod's throne; and, therefore, the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus\r\nChrist; that is, the word and Spirit of God, promised for the guide and\r\nthe sanctifier of his people, are the most necessary instructors of the\r\nsouls of men, in the saving knowledge of the Almighty, and the means to\r\nattain eternal happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd now I found it necessary to put an end to this discourse between my\r\nman and me; for which purpose I rose up hastily, and made as if I had\r\nsome occasion to go out, sending Friday for something that was a good\r\nway off, I then fell on my knees, and beseeched God that he would\r\ninspire me so far as to guide this poor savage in the knowledge of\r\nChrist, to answer his questions more clearly, that his conscience might\r\nbe convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he returned\r\nagain, I entered into a very long discourse with him, upon the subject\r\nof the world's redemption by the Saviour of it, and the doctrine of\r\nrepentance preached from heaven, together with an holy faith of our\r\nblessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then I proceeded to explain to him,\r\naccording to my weak capacity, the reason why our Saviour took not on\r\nhim the nature of angels, but rather the seed of Abraham; and how the\r\nfallen angels had no benefit by that redemption; and, lastly, that he\r\ncame only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. God\r\nknows I had more sincerity than knowledge in all the ways I took for the\r\npoor Indian's instruction; and, I must acknowledge what I believe, every\r\nbody that acts upon the same principle will find, that in laying\r\nheavenly truths open before him, I informed and instructed myself in\r\nmany things that either I did not know, or had not perfectly considered\r\nbefore: so that, however, this poor creature might be improved by my\r\ninstructions, certain it is, that I myself had great reason to be\r\nthankful to Providence for sending him to me. His company allayed my\r\ngrief, and made my habitation comfortable; and when I reflected that the\r\nsolitary life to which I had been so long confined, had made me to look\r\nfurther towards Heaven, by making me the instrument under Providence, to\r\nsave the life, and for ought I know, the soul of this poor savage, by\r\nbringing him to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret joy to\r\nspread through every part of my soul; and I frequently rejoiced, that\r\never I was brought to this place, which I once thought the most\r\nmiserable part of the world.\r\n\r\nIn this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards continue, while I abode\r\non the island, and for three years did my man and I live in the greatest\r\nenjoyment of happiness. Indeed, I believe the savage was as good a\r\nChristian as I; and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents\r\nas were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit; for now we had the\r\nword of the Lord to instruct us in the right way, as much as if we had\r\nbeen on the English shore.\r\n\r\nBy the constant application I made to the Scriptures, as I read them to\r\nmy man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to make him understand every part\r\nof it, as much as lay in my power. He also, on the other hand, by his\r\nvery serious questions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient\r\nin Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by my own private\r\nreading and study. I must not omit another thing, proceeding from the\r\nexperience I had in my retirement: It was that infinite and\r\ninexpressible blessing, the knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which\r\nwas so plain and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct me to\r\ncarry on the great work of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying\r\nhold of a Saviour for eternal life, to a practical stated reformation,\r\nand obedience to all God's institutions, without the assistance of a\r\nreverend and orthodox divine; and especially by this same instruction,\r\nso to enlighten this savage creature, as to make him so good a\r\nChristian, as very few could exceed him. And there was only this great\r\nthing wanting, that I had no authority to administer the Holy Sacrament,\r\nthat heavenly participation of Christ's body and blood; yet, however, we\r\nrested ourselves content; that God would accept our desires, and\r\naccording to our faith, have mercy on us.\r\n\r\nBut what we wanted one way, was made up in another, and that was\r\nuniversal peace in our little church. We had no disputes and wrangling\r\nabout the nature and equality of the holy, blessed, and undivided\r\nTrinity, no niceties in doctrine, or schemes of church government; no\r\nsour or morale dissenters to impose more sublimated notions upon us; no\r\npedant sophisters to confound us with unintelligible mysteries: but,\r\ninstead of all this, we enjoyed the most certain guide to Heaven; that\r\nis, the word of God: besides which, we had the comfortable views of his\r\nSpirit leading us to the truth, and making us both willing and obedient\r\nto the instruction of his word. As the knowledge and practice of this\r\nare the principal means of salvation, I cannot see what it avails any\r\nchristian church, or man in the world, to amuse himself with\r\nspeculations and opinions, except it be to display their particular\r\nvanity and affectation.\r\n\r\nYou may well suppose, that, by the frequent discourse we had together,\r\nmy man and I became most intimately acquainted, and that their was but\r\nvery little that I could say, but what Friday understood; and, indeed,\r\nhe spoke very fluently, though it was but broken English. I now took a\r\nparticular pleasure in relating all my adventures, especially those that\r\noccurred since my being cast on this island. I made him understand that\r\nwonderful mystery, as he conceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught\r\nhim how to shoot. I also presented to him a knife, which pleased him\r\nexceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hanging thereto, like those\r\nin which we wear hangers in England; and, instead of a hanger to put in\r\nthe frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good, but even a\r\nbetter weapon upon many occasions. In a word, my man thus accoutred,\r\nlooked upon himself as great as Don Quixote, when that celebrated\r\nchampion went to combat the windmill.\r\n\r\nI next gave him a very particular description of the territories of\r\nEurope, and in a particular manner of Old England, the place of my\r\nnativity. I laid, before him the manner of our worshipping God, our\r\nbehaviour one to another, and how we trade in ships to every part of the\r\nuniverse. I then told him my misfortunes in being shipwrecked, showing\r\nhim, as near as I could the place where the ship lay, which had been\r\ngone long before; but I brought him to the ruins of my boat which before\r\nmy whole strength could not move, but now was a most rotten, and fallen\r\nto pieces. I observed my man Friday to view this boat with uncommon\r\ncuriosity; which, when he had done, he stood pondering a great while,\r\nand said nothing. At last, said I, \"Friday, what makes you ponder so\r\nmuch?\" He replied, _O master, me see like boat come to place at\r\nmy nation_.\r\n\r\nIt was some time, indeed, before I understood what my man meant; but\r\nexamining strictly into it, I plainly found, that such another boat\r\nresembling mine, had come up on the country where he dwelt: that is to\r\nsay, by his farther explanation, that the boat was driven there through\r\nstress of weather. It then came into my mind that some European ship\r\nhaving been cast away, the poor distressed creatures were forced to have\r\nrecourse to the boat to save their lives; and being all, as I thought\r\ndrowned, I never concerned my self to ask any thing concerning, them,\r\nbut my only inquiry was about the boat, and what description my man\r\ncould give of it.\r\n\r\nIndeed Friday answered my demands very well; making everything very\r\nplain to my understanding: but beyond measure was I satisfied, when he\r\ntold me with great warmth and ardour. _O master, we save white mans from\r\ndrown;_ upon which I immediately asked him, If there were any white\r\nmans, as he called them in the boat? _Yes, yes_, said he, _the boat\r\nfull, very full of white mans_ \"How many, Friday?\" said I. Hereupon he\r\nnumbered his fingers, and counted seventeen. And when I asked him what\r\nbecame of them all, and whether they lived or not? he replied, _Yes\r\nmaster, they all live, they be live among my nation._ This information\r\nput fresh thoughts into my head, that these must be those very men who\r\nbefore I concluded had been swallowed up in the ocean, after they had\r\nleft the ship that had struck upon the rocks of my kingdom, and after\r\nescaping the fury of the deep, landed upon the wild shore, and committed\r\nthemselves to the fury of the devouring Indians.\r\n\r\nThe manner of their cruelties to one another, which consequently, as I\r\nthought, must be acted with greater barbarity to strangers, created in\r\nme a great anxiety, and made me still more curious to ask Friday\r\nconcerning them. He told me, he was sure they still lived there, having\r\nresided among them above four years, and that the savages gave them\r\nvictuals to live upon: \"But pray, Friday,\" said I, \"whence proceeded all\r\nthis good nature and generosity? How came it to pass that they did not\r\nkill and eat them, to please their devouring appetites, and occasion to\r\nsplendid an entertainment among them?\" _No, no,_ said Friday, _they not\r\nkilt 'em, they make brothers with 'em_; by which I understood there was\r\na truce between them. And then I had a more favourable opinion of the\r\nIndians, upon Friday uttering these words, _My nation, t'other nation no\r\neat man, but when mans, make war fight:_ as though he had said, that\r\nneither those of his kingdom, nor any other nations that he knew of,\r\never ate their fellow-creatures, but such as their law of arms allowed\r\nto be devoured; that is, those miserable captives, whose misfortune it\r\nshould be to be made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nSome considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day, in most serene\r\nweather, my man and I stood upon the top of a hill, on the east side of\r\nthe island, whence I had once before beheld the continent of America. I\r\ncould not tell immediately what was the matter, for suddenly Friday fell\r\na jumping and dancing as if he had been mad, and upon my demanding the\r\nreason of his behaviour, _O joy_! said he, _O glad! there see my\r\ncountry, there my nation, there live white mans gether_. And indeed such\r\na rapturous sense of pleasure appeared in his countenance that his eyes\r\nhad an uncommon sparkling and brightness, and such a strange eagerness,\r\nas if he had a longing desire to be in his country again. This made me\r\nno so well satisfied with my man Friday as before; for by this\r\nappearance, I made no dispute, but that if he could get back thither\r\nagain, he would not only be unmindful of what religion I had taught him,\r\nbut likewise of the great obligation he owed me for his wonderful\r\ndeliverance; nay, that he would not only inform his countrymen of me,\r\nbut accompany hundreds of them to my kingdom, and make me a miserable\r\nsacrifice like those unhappy wretches taken in battle.\r\n\r\nIndeed I was very much to blame to have those cruel and unjust\r\nsuspicions, and must freely own I wronged the poor creature very much,\r\nwho was of a quite contrary temper. And had he had that discerning\r\nacuteness which many Europeans have, he would certainly have perceived\r\nmy coldness and indifference, and also have been very much concerned\r\nupon that account; as I was now more circumspect, I had much lessened my\r\nkindness and familiarity with him, and while this jealousy continued, I\r\nused that artful way (now to much in fashion, the occasion of strife and\r\ndissention) of pumping him daily thereby to discover whether he was\r\ndeceitful in his thoughts and inclinations; but certainly he had nothing\r\nin him but what was consistent with the best principles, both as a\r\nreligious Christian and a grateful friend; and indeed; I found every\r\nthing he said was ingenuous and innocent, that I had no room for\r\nsuspicion, and, in spite of all uneasiness, he not only made me entirely\r\nhis own again, but also caused me much to lament that I ever conceived\r\none ill thought of him.\r\n\r\nAs we were walking up the same hill another day, when the weather was\r\nso hazy at sea, that I could not perceive the continent, \"Friday,\" said\r\nI \"don't you wish yourself to be in your own country, your nation, among\r\nyour old friends and acquaintances?\" _Yes,_ said he, _me much O glad to\r\nbe at my own nation._ \"And what would you do there, Friday? Would you\r\nturn wild again, eat man's flesh, and be a savage as you were formerly.\"\r\n_No, no,_ (answered he, full of concern and making his head) _Friday now\r\ntell them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them to eat corn bread,\r\ncattle flesh, milk, no eat man again._ \"But surely,\" replied I, \"if you\r\nshould offer to do all this, they will kill you; and to manifest their\r\ncontempt of such instruction eat you up when they have done.\" He then\r\nput on a grave, yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying, _No, they\r\nno kill me, they willing love learn_: that is that they would be very\r\nwilling to learn: adding withal, _that they had learned much of the\r\nbearded mans that came in the boat_. \"Will you,\" said I \"go back again,\r\nFriday?\" He smiled at that, and told me, that he could not swim so far.\r\nBut said I, I will make a canoe for you. _Yes, Master_ said he, _me go\r\nif you go, me no go if you stay_. \"I go, Friday! why would you have them\r\nto eat me up, and devour your kind master?\" _No no_, said he, _me make\r\nthem not eat master, and me make them much love you_; that is, he would\r\ntell them how I had slain his enemies, and thereby saved his life, for\r\nwhich reason he would make them love me: and then he related to me, as\r\nwell as he was able, how exceedingly kind those his nation were to the\r\nwhite, or bearded men, as he called them, who, in their great calamity,\r\nwere driven into their country.\r\n\r\nIt was from this time, indeed, I had strong inclinations to venture\r\nover, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to join these white\r\nbearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguese; for, thought\r\nI, it must be certainly a better and safer way to escape when there is a\r\ngood company, than for me alone, from an island forty miles off the\r\nshore, and without any assistance. Some days, after, Friday and I being\r\nat work, as usual, at the same time diverting ourselves with various\r\ndiscourses; I told him I had a boat which I would bestow upon him,\r\nwhenever he pleased to return to his own nation; and to convince him of\r\nthe truth of what I said, I took him with me to the other side of the\r\nisland, where my frigate lay, and then taking it from under the water,\r\n(for I always kept it sunk for fear of a discovery) we went both into it\r\nto see how it would manage such an expedition.\r\n\r\nAnd really never could any be more dexterous in rowing than my faithful\r\nservant, making the boat go as fast again as I could. \"Well now,\r\nFriday\", said I, \"shall we now go to your so much admired nation.\" But\r\ninstead of meeting with that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very\r\ndull and melancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first surprised\r\nme, till he made me sensible, that his concern was about the boat's\r\nbeing too small to go so far a voyage. Upon which I let him understand I\r\nhad a much bigger; and accordingly, the next day went to the place where\r\nthe first boat lay, which I had made, when all the strength I had or art\r\nI could use failed me in my attempt to get it into the water: but now it\r\nhaving lain in the sun two and twenty years, and no care being taken of\r\nit all that while, it became in a manner rotten. My man told me, that\r\nsuch a boat would do very well for the purpose, sufficient to carry\r\n_enough vittle, drink, bread_, for that was his manner of talking. In\r\nshort, my mind being strongly fixed upon my design of going over with\r\nhim to the Continent, I very plainly told him that we would both go and\r\nmake a boat full as big, and more proportionable than that, wherein he\r\nmight safely return to his own nation.\r\n\r\nThese words made Friday look so very pensive that I thought he would\r\nhave fallen at my feet. It was some time before he could speak a word,\r\nwhich made me ask him, what was the matter with him? He replied in a\r\nvery soft and moving tone, _What has poor Friday done? why are you angry\r\nmad with poor servant? What me done, O what me done?_ \"Friday,\" said I,\r\n\"you never yet have offended me, what makes you think I am angry with\r\nyou, when I am not angry at all.\" _You no angry, no angry,_ said he\r\nseveral times, _if you be no angry, why den send Friday over great water\r\nto my own nation?_ \"Why from a mountain you beheld the place where you\r\nwas born, and is it not to satisfy your desires that I am willing to\r\ngive you leave to return thither?\" _Yes, yes_, said Friday, _me wish to\r\nbe there sure enough, but then me with master there too: no wish Friday\r\nthere, no master there._ In short, he could not endure the thoughts of\r\ngoing there without me. \"I go there! Friday,\" said I, \"what shall I do\r\nthere?\" He answered very quickly, _O master you do great deal much good,\r\nyou teach all de wild mans to be good tame mans: you learn dem to be\r\nsober, life good live, to know God, and pray God._ \"Alas! poor Friday,\"\r\nsaid I, \"what can I do against their priests of _Benamuckee_, or indeed\r\nwhat good can I make your nation sensible of, when I myself am but a\r\npoor ignorant man?\" _No, no, master,_ said he, _you be no ignorant, you\r\nteachee me good, you teachee dem good._ \"You shall go without me,\r\nFriday,\" said I, \"for I don't care to accompany you thither; I would\r\nrather live in this solitude than venture among such inhuman savages.\r\n_Go your way since you desire it, and leave me alone by myself as I was\r\nbefore I saved your life_.\"\r\n\r\nNever was any creature more thunderstruck than Friday was at these\r\nwords. _Go me away, leave master away, (said he after a long silence,)\r\nno, no, Friday die, Friday live not master gone_, as though he had\r\nsaid, I neither can nor will live, if my master sends me from him. And\r\nhere I cannot but take notice of the strong ties of friendship, which\r\nmany times surpass those of consanguinity: For often we find a great\r\ndisagreement among kindred; and when there is any seeming regard for\r\neach other, it is very seldom true, and scarce ever lasting, if powerful\r\ninterest does not bear the sway; and that alone is often the occasion of\r\nthe greatest hatred in the world, which is to desire the death of\r\nparents and relations, for the sake of acquiring their fortunes. But\r\nthere was no such thing between my servant and me; instead of which\r\nthere was the greatest gratitude and the most sincere love; he found me\r\nnot only his deliverer, but his preserver and comforter; not a severe\r\nand cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving, and affable friend. He wanted for\r\nno manner of sustenance; and when he was ill or out of order, I was his\r\nphysician, not only for his body but his soul; and therefore no wonder\r\nwas it, that such an innocent creature long since divested of his former\r\nnatural cruelty, should have an uncommon concern at so cruel a\r\nseperation from me, which pierced him to the very soul, and made him\r\ndesire even to die, rather than live without me..\r\n\r\nAfter I had told Friday, in a very careless manner, that he should be at\r\nhis liberty as soon as the boat was made, the language of his eyes\r\nexpressed all imaginable confusion; when, immediately running to one of\r\nhis hatchets, which he used to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it\r\ninto my hand, with a heart so full, that he could scarcely speak.\r\n'Friday,' said I, 'what is it you mean? What must I do with this?' _Only\r\nkill Friday_, said he, _Friday care not live long._' 'But what must I\r\nkill you for? replied I again, _Ah! dear master, what made you Friday\r\nsave from eat a me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday love God, and\r\nlove not Benamuckee, and now Friday send away; never see Friday more._\r\nAs though the poor creature had said, Alas! my dearest kind master, how\r\ncomes it to pass, that after having ventured your precious life to save\r\nme from the jaws of devouring cannibals, like myself, after such a\r\ntender regard to provide for me such a comfortable nourishment, and\r\ncontinuing so long a kind master, and a most sincere friend; and after\r\nmaking me forsake the false notion of an Indian Deity, and worship the\r\ntrue God in spirit and in truth; and after all this how comes it now,\r\nthat you are willing to send me away to my former course of living, by\r\nwhich means undoubtedly we shall be dead to each other; but greater must\r\nbe my misfortune, that I shall never behold my best friend I have in the\r\nworld any more. And this undoubtedly, though he could not express\r\nhimself so clearly, must be his sentiments; for the tears ran down his\r\ncheeks in such a plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain from\r\nweeping also, when I beheld the poor creature's affection; so that I was\r\nforced to comfort him in the best manner I could, which I did, by\r\ntelling him, if he was content to abide with me, I should be ever\r\nwilling to keep him.\r\n\r\nAfter Friday's grief was something abated, more fully to convince me of\r\nhis affection, he said, _O master, me not care to be in my nation, leave\r\nyou here; me desire nation learn good, that's all;_ meaning, that his\r\ndesire was for the conversion of that barbarous people. But as I had no\r\napostolic mission, nor any concern about their salvation; so I had not\r\nthe least intention or desire of undertaking it; and the strength of my\r\ninclination, in order to escape, proceeded chiefly from my late\r\ndiscourse with Friday, about these seventeen white bearded men, that had\r\nbeen driven upon the Barbarian coast; whom I designed to join, as the\r\nonly means to further our escape. To which intent my man and I went to\r\nsearch for a proper tree to fell, whereof we might make a large perigua\r\nor canoe, to undertake the voyage; and, indeed, we were not long in\r\nfinding one fit for our purpose, there being enough of wood in the\r\nisland to have built a fleet of large vessels, but the thing we\r\nprincipally wanted was to get one so near the water, that we might\r\nlaunch it after it was finished, and not commit so horrid a mistake as I\r\nhad once done before.\r\n\r\nWell, after a great search for what was best and most convenient,\r\nFriday, at last, whose judgment in such affairs was much superior to\r\nmine, pitches upon a kind of wood the most fitting for it. To this day I\r\ncannot tell the name of the tree, nor describe it any other way, than\r\nonly by saying, that it is like what we call _fustic_, or between that\r\nand the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour and smell. But\r\nthough my man exceeded me in the knowledge of the most proper tree, yet\r\nI shewed him a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he\r\nknew before; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity of the tree, in\r\norder to make this boat; but I then told him how he might do it with\r\ntools, learning him at the same time how to use them, which indeed he\r\ndid very dexterously; so that in a month's time we finished it, making\r\nit very handsome, by cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat.\r\nAfter this it took us a full fortnight before we could get her into the\r\nwater, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers; but\r\nwhen she was in, she would have carried twenty men, with all the ease\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nAs I was very well pleased, you may be sure at the launching of this man\r\nof war of mine, I was no less amazed to behold with what dexterity my\r\nman would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. 'Well Friday,'\r\nsaid I, 'what do you think of it now? Do you think this will carry us\r\nover? _Yes, master_, said he, _me venture over well, though great blow\r\nwind_. But my design was yet farther, which he was insensible of; and\r\nthat was to make a mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor\r\nand cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all to procure:\r\nso I fixed upon a strait young cedar-tree; which I found near the place,\r\ngreat plenty of it abounding in the island; and setting Friday to cut it\r\ndown, I gave him particular directions how to shape and order it; but as\r\nto the sail, that I managed myself. I very well knew I had some old\r\nones, or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six and twenty years by\r\nme; but not being careful to preserve them, as thinking I should have no\r\noccasion to use them any more, when I came to overlook them I found them\r\nalmost all rotten, except two; and with these I went to work, and after\r\na great deal of pains and aukward tedious stitching for want of needles,\r\nat length I finished a three-cornered ugly thing, like those which our\r\nlong boats use, and which I very well knew how to manage, especially\r\nsince it was like that which I had in my patron's fishing boat, when,\r\nwith my boy Xury, I made my escape from the Barbarian shore.\r\n\r\nIt was near two months, I think, before I completed this work, that is,\r\nthe rigging and fitting my mast and sails; and indeed they were nicely\r\ndone, having made a small stay and a sail, or a foresail to it, to\r\nassist, if we should turn to the westward; and what is still more, I\r\nfixed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with; and though I was but\r\na very indifferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensible of the great\r\nusefulness and absolute necessity of a thing like this, I applied myself\r\nto it with such a confident application, that at last I accomplished my\r\ndesign; but what with the many dull contrivances I had about it, and the\r\nfailure of many things, it cost me as much pains in ordering as in\r\nmaking the boat. Besides when all this was done, I had my man to teach\r\nwhat belonged to its navigation; for though he very well understood how\r\nto paddle a canoe along, he was an utter stranger to a sail and a\r\nrudder, and was amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the\r\nsea, by them, and how the sail gibbed and filled this way or that way,\r\nas the course we sailed changed. After some time and a little use, I\r\nmade all these things very familiar to him, so that he became an expert\r\nsailor, except in relation to the compass, and that I could make him\r\nunderstand but little of. But, as it happened, there was seldom occasion\r\nfor it, there being but little cloudy weather, and scarce any fog in\r\nthose parts; the stars were always visible in the night, and the shore\r\nperspicuous by day, except in the rainy season, which confined every one\r\nto his habitation. Thus entered in the seven and twentieth year of my\r\nreign, or captivity, which you please, (the last three of which blessed\r\nwith the company of my man Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept the\r\nanniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God, for\r\nhis tender mercies, as I did before; and certainly, as I had great\r\ncause for a thankful acknowledgement for my deliverance at first, I had\r\nmuch greater now for such singular and additional testimonies of the\r\ncare of Providence over me, in all my distress of both body and mind,\r\nand the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered;\r\nfor I had a strong impression upon my mind, that I should not be another\r\nyear in this island. But, however, I still continued on with my\r\nhusbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as usual; gathering and\r\ncuring my grapes, and doing all other things that were necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd now the rainy season beginning to come on, obliged me to keep the\r\nlonger within doors; but before this I brought my new vessel into the\r\ncreek, where I had landed my rafts from the ship, and haling her up to\r\nthe shore, I ordered my man Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold her\r\nin, and deep enough to give her water, wherein she might float; and then\r\nwhen the tide was out, we made a strong dam cross the end of it, to keep\r\nout the water; by which means she lay dry, as to the tide from the sea;\r\nand to keep the rain from her, we thatched her over, as it were, with\r\nboughs of trees, like a house, so we waited for the months of November\r\nand December, in which I designed to venture over the ocean.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the seasonable weather begin to draw near, but so much was\r\nI elevated with this new designed adventure, that I daily prepared for\r\nthe voyage. The first thing I thought on was, to lay by a certain\r\nquantity of provisions, as a sufficient store for such an expedition,\r\nintending in a week or fortnight's time to open the dock, and to launch\r\nout the boat for that purpose. But one morning as I was very busy upon\r\nsomething necessary for this occasion, I called Friday to me, and bid\r\nhim go to the seashore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a\r\nthing which we commonly had once a week, as much upon account of the\r\neggs, as for the sake of the flesh. He had not been long gone, but he\r\ncame running back, as though he was pursued for life, and as if it were\r\nflew over my outer-wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or\r\nsteps he set his feet on; and before I had time to enquire the reason of\r\nthis precipitation, he cries out, _O dear master, O sorrow, sorrow! Bad!\r\nO bad!_ 'Why, what's the matter Friday,' said I. _O yonder, yonder!_\r\nsaid he; _there be one, two, or three canoes! two three!_ Surely,\r\nthought I, there must be six, by my man's way of reckoning; but on a\r\nstricter inquiry, I found there were but three. 'Well Friday,' said I,\r\n'don't be terrified, I warrant you we will not only defend ourselves\r\nagainst them, but kill the most of these cruel savages.' But though I\r\ncomforted him in the best manner I could, the poor creature trembled so,\r\nthat I scarce knew what to do with him:--_O master_, said he, _they come\r\nlook Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up_. 'Why Friday,' said I,\r\n'they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is as great as\r\nyours. But since it is so, we must resolve to fight for our lives. What\r\nsay you? Can you fight Friday? _Yes,(said he, very faintly) me shoot, me\r\nkill what I can, but there come a great many number._'That's no matter,'\r\nsaid I again, 'our guns will terrify those that we do not kill: I am\r\nvery willing to stand by you to the last drop of my blood. Now tell me\r\nif you will do the like by me, and, obey my orders in whatsoever I\r\ncommand?' Friday then answered, _O master, me loses life for you, me die\r\nwhen you bid die._ Thus concluding all questions concerning his\r\nfidelity, immediately I fetched him a good dram of rum, (of which I had\r\nbeen a very good husband) and gave it him to comfort his heart. After he\r\nhad drank it, I ordered him to take the two-fowling pieces, which we\r\nalways carried, and load them with large swan-shot, as big as small\r\npistol bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs\r\nand five small bullets each; charging my two pistols each with a brace;\r\nI hung my great sword, as customary, naked to my side, and gave Friday\r\nhis hatchet, as a most excellent weapon for defence.\r\n\r\nThus prepared, I thought as well of myself, as any knight errant that\r\never handled a sword and spear. I took my perspective glass and went up\r\nto the side of the hill, to see what I could discover; and I perceived\r\nvery soon, by my glass, that there were one and twenty savages, three\r\nprisoners, and three canoes, and that their chief concern seemed to be\r\nthe triumphant banquet upon the three poor human bodies, a thing which\r\nby this time I had observed was very common with them. I also remarked,\r\nthat they did not land at that place from whence Friday made his escape,\r\nbut nearer to the creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood\r\ncame very close to the sea. My soul was then filled with indignation and\r\nabhorrence at such inhuman wretches, which put a period to all my former\r\nthoughts in their vindication, neither would I give myself time to\r\nconsider their right of conquest, as I had done before: but descending\r\nfrom the mountain, I came down to Friday, and told him, I was resolved\r\nto go speedily to them, and kill them all; asking him again in the same\r\nbreath, if he would stand by me; when by this time being recovered from\r\nhis fright, and his spirits much cheered with the dram I had given him,\r\nhe was very pleasant, yet seriously telling me, as he did before, _When\r\nI bid die, he would die_.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was, having fixed my resolution in so strong a manner, that\r\nnothing could divest my breast of its uncommon fury. I immediately\r\ndivided the loaded arms betwixt us. To my man Friday I gave a pistol to\r\nstick in his girdle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too\r\ngreat, I confess, to bear but what must a poor king do, who has but one\r\nsoldier in the world? But to show I made him bear no more than what I\r\nwould lay on myself, I stuck the other pistol in my girdle, and the\r\nother three guns upon my shoulders; nay, something more, but that was\r\nlike Aesop's burden, a small bottle of rum, which was soon lightened to\r\nour exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched out, under a ponderous load\r\nof armour, like two invincible champions, with a quantity of powder and\r\nbullets to stand our battle, and load again, when the pieces were\r\ndischarged. And now my orders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to\r\nkeep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or attempt anything\r\ntill I commanded him; and in the interim, not to speak so much as one\r\nword. It was in this order I fetched a compass to the right hand, of\r\nnear a mile, as well to get over the creek, as to attain the wood; and\r\nby this, I thought to come within shot of them before I could be\r\ndiscerned, as I found by my glass, would not be difficult to accomplish.\r\n\r\nBut how fickle and wavering is the mind of man, even in our greatest\r\nfury and strongest inclinations. For while I was taking this march, my\r\nresolution began to abate, not through fear of their numbers, who were a\r\nparcel of naked unarmed wretches, but those reflections occurred to my\r\nthoughts: _what power was I commissioned with, or what occasion or\r\nnecessity had I to go and imbrue my hands in human blood, and murder\r\npeople that had neither done nor intended to do me any wrong? They were\r\ninnocent in particular as to me: and their barbarous custom was not only\r\ntheir misfortune but a sign that God had left them in the most immense\r\nstupidity; but yet did not warrant me to be a judge of their actions,\r\nmuch less an executioner of his righteous judgments? That, on the\r\ncontrary, whenever he thought fit, he would take vengeance on them\r\nhimself, and punish them in a national way, according to their national\r\ncrimes; but this was nothing at all to me, who had no concern with them.\r\nIndeed my man Friday might justify himself, because they were his\r\ndeclared enemies, of that very same nation that went to sacrifice him\r\nbefore; and indeed it was lawful for him to attack them, which I could\r\nnot say was so with respect to me,_--So warmly did these things press\r\nupon my thoughts all the way I went, that I only resolved to place\r\nmyself so as to behold their bloody entertainment, without falling upon\r\nthem, except something more than ordinary, by God's special direction,\r\nshould oblige me thereto.\r\n\r\nThus fixed in my resolution, I entered into the thick wood, (my man\r\nFriday following me close behind) when with all possible wariness and\r\nsilence, I marched till I came close to the skirt of it, on that side\r\nwhich was the nearest to them; for only one end of the wood interposed\r\nbetween me and them. Upon which I called very softly to Friday, and\r\nshewing him a great tree, that was just at the corner of the wood, I\r\nordered him to repair thither, and bring me word, if he could plainly\r\nperceive their actions; accordingly he did as I commanded him, and came\r\nback with this melancholy story, _that they were all about their fire,\r\neating the flesh of one of their prisoners; and that another lay bound\r\nupon the sands at a little distance from them, which they designed for\r\nthe next sacrifice, and this, he told me was not one of their nation,\r\nbut one of those very bearded men, who were driven by a storm into their\r\ncountry, and of whom he had so often talked to me about_--You may be\r\nsure, that upon hearing this, my soul was ready to sink within me: when\r\nascending into a tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay\r\nupon the beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied with flags, or\r\nthings resembling rushes, being covered with clothes, and seemed to be\r\nan European. From the tree where I took this prospect I perceived\r\nanother tree and a thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer to them\r\nthan where I was, which, by taking a small circle round, I might come at\r\nundiscovered, & then I should be within half a shot of these devourers.\r\nAnd this consideration alone, to be more perfectly revenged upon them,\r\nmade me withhold my passion, though I was enraged to the highest degree\r\nimaginable; when going back about twenty paces I got behind some bushes,\r\nwhich held all the way till I came to the other tree; and then I\r\nascended to a little rising ground, not above eighteen yards distance,\r\nand there I had a full view of these creatures, and I could perceive all\r\ntheir actions.\r\n\r\nSuch a fight did then appear, as obliged me not to lose a moment's time.\r\nNo less than nineteen of these dreadful wretches sat upon the ground,\r\nclose huddled together, expressing all the delight imaginable at so\r\nbarbarous an entertainment; and they had just sent the other two to\r\nmurder this poor unhappy Christian, and bring him limb by limb to their\r\nfire; for they were then just going to untie the bands from his feet, in\r\norder for death, as fetters are knocked off the feet of malefactors\r\nbefore they go to the place of execution. Hereupon, immediately turning\r\nto my man, 'now, Friday' said I 'mind what I say, fail in nothing, but\r\ndo exactly as you see me do'. All which he promising--he would perform,\r\nI let down one of my muskets, and fowling-piece upon the ground, and\r\nFriday did the same by his; and with the other musket I took my aim at\r\nthe savages, bidding him do the like: 'Are you ready' said I: _Yes,\r\nMaster,_ said he; 'why then fire at them,' said I; and that very moment\r\nI gave fire likewise.\r\n\r\nI only killed one and wounded two; but my man Friday, taking his aim\r\nmuch better than I, killed two and wounded three. You may be sure they\r\nwere in a dreadful consternation, at, such an unexpected disaster, and\r\nthose who had yet escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon\r\ntheir feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew not which way\r\nto run or look; not knowing from whence their destruction came. We threw\r\ndown our pieces, and took up others, giving a second dreadful volley;\r\nbut as they were loaded only with swan shot, or small pistol bullets, we\r\nperceived only two of them fall; tho many were wounded, who run yelling\r\nand screaming about like mad creatures. 'Now, Friday,' said I, 'lay down\r\nyour piece, and take up the musket, and follow me.' He did so, with\r\ngreat courage, when showing ourselves to the savages we give a great\r\nshout, and made directly to the poor victim, who would have been\r\nsacrificed, had not our first fire obliged the butchers, with three\r\nothers, to jump into a canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them, at\r\nwhich shot I thought he had killed them all, by reason of their falling\r\nto the bottom of the boat; however, he killed two, and mortally wounded\r\na third. In the mean time, I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet\r\nof the poor creature, and lifting him up asked him in the Portuguese\r\ntongue, _What he was?_ He answered me in Latin, _Christiantis;_ but so\r\nvery weak and faint, that he could scarce stand or speak. Immediately I\r\ngave him a dram; and a piece of bread to cherish him, and asked him,\r\nWhat countryman he was? He said, _Hispaniola;_ and then uttered all the\r\nthankfulness imaginable for his deliverance. 'Signior,' said I, with as\r\nmuch Spanish as I was master of, 'let us talk afterwards, but fight now;\r\nhere, take this sword and pistol, and do what you can.' And, indeed, he\r\ndid so with much courage and intrepidity, that he cut two of them to\r\npieces in an instant, the savages not having the power to fly for their\r\nlives. I ordered Friday to run for those pieces we had left at the tree,\r\nwhich he brought me with great swiftness, and then I gave him my musket,\r\nwhile I loaded the rest. But now their happened a fierce encounter\r\nbetween the Spaniard & one of the savages who had made at him with one\r\nof their wooden swords; and though the former was as brave as could be\r\nexpected, having twice wounded his enemy in the head, yet being weak &\r\nfaint, the Indian had thrown him upon the ground, & was wrestling my\r\nsword out of his hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quiting, drew out\r\nhis pistol, and shot him through the body before I could come near him,\r\nthough I was running to his assistance.' As to Friday, he pursued the\r\nflying wretches with his hatchet, dispatching three, but the rest were\r\ntoo nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one of the fowling pieces,\r\nwounded two, who running into the wood Friday pursued and killed; but\r\nthe other, notwithstanding his wounds, plunged himself into the sea &\r\nswam to those who were left in the canoe; which, with one wounded, were\r\nall that escaped out of one and twenty. The account is as follows.\r\n\r\n_Killed at first shot from the tree ..... 3\r\nAt the second shot ...................... 2\r\nBy Friday in the boat ................... 2\r\nDitto of those first wounded ............ 2\r\nDitto in the wood ....................... 1\r\nBy the Spaniard ......................... 3\r\nKilled or died of their wounds .......... 4\r\nEscaped in the boat, whereof one wounded,\r\n  if not slain_ ......................... 4\r\n                                   --------\r\n                                   Total 21\r\n                                   --------\r\n\r\nThe savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out of our reach, and\r\nFriday was as eager in pursuing them; and indeed I was no less anxious\r\nabout their escape, lest after the news had been carried to their\r\npeople, they should return in multitudes and destroy us. So being\r\nresolved to pursue them, I jumped into one of the canoes and bid Friday\r\nfollow me; but no sooner was I in, than to my surprise, I found another\r\npoor creature bound hand and foot for the slaughter, just as the\r\nSpaniard had been, with very little life in him. Immediately I unbound\r\nhim, and would have helped him up; but he could neither stand nor speak,\r\nbut groaned so piteously, as thinking he was only unbound in order to be\r\nslain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to him, and tell him of his\r\ndeliverance; when pulling out my bottle I made the poor wretch drink a\r\ndram; which, with the joyful news he had received, so revived his heart\r\nthat he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday began to hear him speak,\r\nand look more fully in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to\r\nperceive his uncommon transports of joy; for he kissed, embraced him,\r\nhugged him, cried, laughed, hollooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then\r\ncried again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head, then sung and\r\njumped about again, like a distracted creature; so that it was a great\r\nwhile before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the\r\nmatter with him; but when he came to the liberty of his speech at last,\r\nhe told me it was his father.\r\n\r\nHere indeed I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful and tender\r\naffection this poor savage had to his aged parent. He would sit down by\r\nhim in the boat, open his breast and hold his father's head close to his\r\nbosom half an hour together to cherish him: then he took his arms &\r\nankles, which were stiff and numbed with binding, and chaffed and rubbed\r\nthem with his hands; by which means perceiving what the case was, I gave\r\nhim some rum, which proved of great benefit to him.\r\n\r\nWhile we were busy in this action the savages had gotten almost out of\r\nsight; and happy it was we did not pursue them: For there arose from the\r\nnorth-west, which continued all night long, such a violent storm that I\r\ncould not suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After this I\r\ncalled Friday to me, and asked him if he had given his father any bread?\r\nHe shook his head and said, _None, not one bit, me eat-a up all;_ so I\r\ngave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I\r\nlikewise gave him a dram for himself, & two or three bunches of raisins\r\nfor his father. Both these he carried to him, for he would make him\r\ndrink the dram to comfort him.\r\n\r\nAway then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched, with such an\r\nextraordinary swiftness, that he was out of sight as it were in an\r\ninstant; but at his return I perceived him slacken his pace, because he\r\nhad something in his hand. And this I found to be as he approached\r\nnearer, an earthen jug with some water for his father, with two more\r\ncakes of bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being very thirsty\r\nmyself I drank some of the water, of which his father had drank\r\nsufficiently, it more revived his spirits than all the rum I had\r\ngiven him.\r\n\r\nI then called Friday to me and ordered him to carry the Spaniard one of\r\nthe cakes and some water, who was reposing himself under a green place\r\nunder the shade of a tree, but so weak, that though he exerted himself\r\nhe could not stand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to rub and\r\nbathe his ankles with rum as he did his father's. But every minute he\r\nwas employed in this he would cast a wishful eye towards the boat, where\r\nhe left his father sitting; who suddenly disappearing he flew like\r\nlightning to him, and finding he had only laid himself down to ease his\r\nlimbs, he returned back to me presently; and then I spoke to the\r\nSpaniard to let Friday help him and lead him to the boat, in order to be\r\nconveyed to my dwelling where I would take care of him. Upon which\r\nFriday took him upon his back and so carried him to the canoe, setting\r\nhim close by his father; and presently stepping out again, launched the\r\nboat off and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, though\r\nthe wind blew very hard too, and having brought them safe to the creek,\r\naway he runs to fetch the other canoe, which he brought to the creek\r\nalmost as soon as I got to it by land, when wafting me over, he took our\r\nnew guests out of the boat; but so weak were they that I was forced to\r\nmake a kind of a hand-barrow; and when I came to my castle, not being\r\nwilling to make an entrance into my wall, we made them a handsome tent\r\ncovered with old sails and boughs of trees, making two good beds of rice\r\nstraw, with blankets to lie upon and cover them. Thus like an absolute\r\nking over subjects who owed their lives to me, I thought myself very\r\nconsiderable, especially as I had now three religions in my kingdom, my\r\nman Friday being a Protestant, his father a Pagan, and the Spaniard a\r\nPapist: but I gave liberty of conscience to them all.\r\n\r\nTo get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered Friday to kill me\r\na yearling goat; which when he had done I cut off the hinder quarters,\r\nand chopping it into small pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley\r\nand rice into the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table,\r\ndined with them myself and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter to\r\nhis father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, who spoke the language of\r\nthe savages pretty well. After dinner I ordered Friday to fetch home all\r\nour arms from the field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead\r\nbodies, which he did accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnd now I made Friday inquire of his father, whether he thought these\r\nsavages had escaped the late storm in their canoe? and if so, whether\r\nthey would not return with a power too great for us to resist? He\r\nanswered, _that he thought it impossible they could outlive the storm;\r\nor, if they were driven southwardly, they would come to a land where\r\nthey would as certainly be devoured, as if they were drowned in the sea.\r\nAnd suppose they had attained their own country, the strangeness of\r\ntheir fatal and bloody attack, would make them tell their people, that\r\nthe rest of them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand\r\nof man, but by two heavenly spirits_ (meaning Friday and me) _who were\r\nsent from above to destroy them. And this_, he said, _he knew because he\r\nheard them say the same to one another_. And indeed he was in the right\r\non't; for I have heard since, that these four men gave out that whoever\r\nwent to that inchanted island, would be destroyed by fire from the gods.\r\n\r\nNo canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my apprehensions ceased:\r\ninstead of which my former thoughts of a voyage took place, especially\r\nwhen Friday's father assured me, I should have good usage in his nation.\r\nAs to the Spaniard, he told me, that sixteen more of his countrymen and\r\nPortuguese, who had been shipwrecked, made their escape thither; that\r\nthough they were in union with the savages, yet they were very miserable\r\nfor want of provisions and other necessaries. When I asked him about the\r\nparticulars of his voyage, he answered that their ship was bound from\r\nthe Rio de la Plata to the Havannah; that when the ship was lost, only\r\nfive men perished in the ocean; the rest having saved themselves in the\r\nboat, were now landed on the main continent. 'And what do they intend to\r\ndo there?' said I. He replied, they have concerted measures to escape,\r\nby building a vessel, but that they had neither tools nor provisions,\r\nfor that all their designs came to nothing. 'Supposing, said I, I should\r\nmake a proposal, and invite them here, would they not carry me prisoner\r\nto New Spain?' he answered no; for he knew them to be such honest men,\r\nas would scorn to act such inhuman baseness to their deliverer: That, if\r\nI pleased, he and the old savage would go over to them, talk with them\r\nabout it, and bring me an answer: That they should all swear fidelity to\r\nme as their leader, upon the Holy Sacrament; and for his, part he would\r\nnot only do the same, but stand to the last drop of his blood should\r\nthere be occasion.\r\n\r\nThese solemn assurances made me resolve to grant them relief, and to\r\nsend these two over for that purpose; but when every thing was ready,\r\nthe Spaniard raised an objection, which carried a great deal of weight\r\nin it: _You know, Sir, said he, that having been some time with you, I\r\ncannot but be sensible of your stock of rice and corn, sufficient,\r\nperhaps for us at present, but not for them, should they come over\r\npresently; much less to victual a vessel for an intended voyage. Want\r\nmight be as great an occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the\r\nchildren of Israel did against God himself, when they wanted to break\r\nbread in the wilderness. And therefore, my advice is to await another\r\nharvest and in the mean time cultivate and improve more land, whereby we\r\nmay have plenty of provisions in order to execute our design_.\r\n\r\nThis advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely; and so satisfied was\r\nI of his fidelity that I esteemed him ever after. And thus we all four\r\nwent to work upon some more land, and against seed time we had gotten so\r\nmuch cured and trimmed up sufficient to sow twenty-two bushels of barley\r\non, and sixteen jars of rice, which was in short all the feed we had to\r\nspare. As we were four in number and by this time all in good health, we\r\nfeared not a hundred Indians should they venture to attack us; and while\r\nthe corn was growing, I pitched upon some trees, fit to build us a large\r\nvessel in case the Spaniards came over; which being marked, I ordered\r\nFriday and his father to cut them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was\r\nnow my privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the work. I likewise\r\nincreased my flocks of goats by shooting the wild dams and bringing home\r\ntheir kids to my inclosure. Nor did I neglect the grape season, but\r\ncured them as usual, though I had such a quantity now as would have\r\nfilled eighty barrels with raisins. And thus all of us being employed,\r\nthey in working, and I in providing for them till harvest came, God\r\nAlmighty blessed the increase of it so much, that from twenty-two\r\nbarrels of barley we thrashed out two hundred and twenty, and the like\r\nquantity of rice; sufficient to victual a ship fit to carry me and all\r\nthe Spaniards to any part of America.\r\n\r\nThus the principal objection being answered, by a sufficient stock of\r\nprovisions, I sent my two ambassadors over to the main land, with a\r\nregal authority to administer the oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and\r\nhave an instrument signed under their hands, though I never asked\r\nwhether they had pen, ink, or paper; when giving each of them a musket,\r\neight charges of powder and ball, and provisions enough for eight days,\r\nthey sailed away with a fair gale on a day when the moon was at full.\r\n\r\nScarce a fortnight had passed over my head, but impatient for their\r\nreturn, I laid me down to sleep one morning, when a strange accident\r\nhappened, which was ushered in by Friday's coming running to me, and\r\ncalling aloud, _Master, Master, they are come, they are come._ Upon\r\nwhich, not dreaming of any danger, out I jumped from my bed, put on my\r\nclothes and hurried through my little grove; when looking towards the\r\nsea, I perceived a boat about a league and a half distant, standing in\r\nfor the shore with the wind fair. I beheld they did not come from the\r\nside where the land lay on, but from the southerhmost end of the island:\r\nSo these being none of the people we wanted, I ordered Friday to lie\r\nstill, till such time as I came down from the mountain, which, with my\r\nladder, I now ascended in order to discover more fully what they were;\r\nand now, with the help of my perspective glass, I plainly perceived an\r\nEnglish ship, which I concluded it to be; by the fashion of its long\r\nboat; and which filled me with such uncommon transports of joy, that I\r\ncannot tell how to describe; and yet some secret doubts hang about me,\r\nproceeding from I know not what cause, as though I had reason to be upon\r\nmy guard. And, indeed, I would have no man contemn the secret hints and\r\nintimations of danger, which very often are given, when he may imagine\r\nthere is no possibility of its being real; for had I not been warned by\r\nthis silent admonition, I had been in a worse situation than before, and\r\nperhaps inevitably ruined.\r\n\r\nNot long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach the shore, as\r\nthough they looked for a place where they might conveniently land; and\r\nat last they ran their boat on shore upon the beach, about half a mile\r\ndistance; which proved so much the happier for me, since, had they come\r\ninto the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might not only have\r\nforced me out of my castle, but plundered me of all I had in the world.\r\nNow I was fully convinced they were all Englishmen, three of which were\r\nunarmed and bound; when immediately the first four or five leaped on\r\nshore, and took those three out of the boat as prisoners; one of whom I\r\ncould perceive used the most passionate gestures of entreaty,\r\naffliction, and despair, while the others in a lesser degree, showed\r\nabundance of concern.\r\n\r\nNot knowing the meaning of this, I was very much astonished, and I\r\nbeckoned to Friday, who was below, to ascend the mountain, and likewise\r\nview this sight. _O master_, said he to me, _you see English mans eat\r\nprisoners as well as Savage mans_. 'And do you think they will eat them\r\nFriday?' said I. _Yes_, said Friday, _they eat all up_. 'No, no,' said\r\nI, 'Friday, I am much more concerned lest they murder them, but as for\r\neating them up, that I am sure they will never do.'\r\n\r\nAnd now I not only lamented my misfortune in not having the Spaniard and\r\nSavage with me, but also that I could not come within shot of them\r\nunperceived, they having no fire arms among them, and save these three\r\nme, whom I thought they were going to kill with their swords. But some\r\ncomfort it was to me, that I perceived they were set at liberty to go\r\nwhere they pleased, the rascally seamen scattering about as though they\r\nhad a mind to see the place; and so long did they negligently ramble,\r\nthat the tide had ebbed so low, as to leave the boat aground. Nor were\r\nthe two men who were in her more circumspect; for having drunk a little\r\ntoo much liquor, they fell fast asleep; but one of them waking before\r\nthe other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground for his strength to\r\nmove it, he hallooed out to the rest, who made all possible expedition\r\nto come to him; but as Providence ordered it, all their force was\r\nineffectual to launch her, when I could hear them speak to one another,\r\n_Why let her alone, Jack, can't ye, she'll float next tide_; by which\r\nwords I was fully convinced they were my own countrymen. I all this\r\nwhile lay very quiet, as being fully sensible it could be no less than\r\nten hours before the boat would be afloat, and then it would be so dark,\r\nthat they could not easily perceive me, by which means I should be at\r\nmore liberty to hear their talk, and observe all their motions: not but\r\nthat I prepared for my defence: yet, as I had another sort of enemy to\r\ncombat with I acted with more caution. I took two fusees on my shoulder,\r\nand gave Friday three muskets; besides my formidable goat-skin coat and\r\nmonstrous cap made me look as fierce and terrible as Hercules of old,\r\nespecially when two pistols were stuck in my belt, and my naked sword\r\nhanging by my side.\r\n\r\nIt was my design at first not to make any attempt till it was dark; and\r\nit being now two o'clock, in the very heat of the day, the sailors were\r\nall straggling in the woods, and undoubtedly were lain down to sleep.\r\nThe three poor distressed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were\r\nhowever seated under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter of a\r\nmile from me. Upon which, without any more ado, I approached towards\r\nthem, with my man following behind me, and before I was perceived, I\r\ncalled aloud to them in Spanish, _What are ye, Gentlemen_.\r\n\r\nAt these words, they started up in great confusion, when they beheld the\r\nstrange figure I made; they returned no answer, but seemed as if they\r\nwould fly from me: 'Gentlemen,' said I, in English 'don't be afraid,\r\nperhaps you have a friend nearer than you expect.' _He must be from\r\nHeaven_, said one of them, gravely pulling off his hat, _for we are past\r\nall help in this world._ 'All help is from Heaven,' said I: 'But Sir, as\r\nI have perceived every action between you and these brutes since your\r\nlanding only inform me, how to assist you, and I will do it to the\r\nutmost of my power.'\r\n\r\n_Am I talking with God or man_, said he, in melting tears. _Are you of\r\nhuman kind or an angel_? 'Sir,' said I, 'my poor habit will tell you I\r\nam a man, and an Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this\r\nservant only: here are arms and ammunition: tell freely your condition:\r\nCan we save you?' _The story_, said he, _is too long to relate, since\r\nour butchers are so near: but, Sir, I was master of that ship, my men\r\nhave mutinied, and it is a favour they have put my mate, this\r\npassenger, and me, on shore without murdering us, though we expect\r\nnothing but perishing here_. 'Are your enemies gone?' said I. _No_,\r\nreplied he, pointing to a thicket, _there they lie, while my heart\r\ntrembles, lest having seen and heard us they should murder us all._\r\n'Have they fire arms?' said I. _They have but two pieces_, said he, _one\r\nof which is left in the boat._ He also told me there were two enormous\r\nvillains among them, that were the authors of this mutiny, who, if they\r\nwere killed or seized, might induce the rest to return to their\r\nobedience. 'Well, well,' said I, 'let us retire farther under the\r\ncovering of the woods;' and there it was I made these conditions\r\nwith him:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. Crusoe accosting the Captain, &c. set ashore by the\r\nMutineers.]\r\n\r\nI. That, while they staid in the island, they should not pretend to any\r\nauthority; but should entirely conform to my orders, and return me the\r\narms which I should put in their hands.\r\n\r\nII. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afford Friday and\r\nmyself a passage _gratis_ to England.\r\n\r\nWhen he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire, I gave him and\r\nhis two companions each of them a gun, with powder and ball sufficient,\r\nadvising them to fire upon them as they lay sleeping. The Captain\r\nmodestly said, that he was sorry to kill them; though, on the other\r\nhand, to let these villains escape, who were the authors of his misery,\r\nmight be the ruin of us all. _Well,_ said he, _do as you think fit;_ and\r\nso accordingly I fired, killed one of the Captain's chief enemies and\r\nwounding the other; who eagerly called for assistance, but the Captain\r\nwho had reserved his piece, coming up to him, _Sirrah_, said he, _'tis\r\ntoo late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to God to pardon\r\nyour villany;_ and so knocked him down with the stock of his gun: three\r\nothers were also slightly wounded, who at my approach cried out for\r\nmercy. This the Captain granted upon condition that they would swear to\r\nbe true to him in recovering the ship, which they solemnly did; However\r\nI obliged the Captain to keep them bound. After which I sent Friday and\r\nthe Captain's mate to secure the boat and bring away the oars and sails;\r\nwhen, at their return, three men coming back, and seeing their late\r\ndistressed Captain, now their conqueror, submitted to be bound also. And\r\nthen it was, that having more liberty, I related the adventures of my\r\nwhole life, which he heard with a serious and wonderful attention. After\r\nthis, I carried him and his two companions into my little fortified\r\ncastle, shewed them all my conveniences, and refreshed them with such\r\nprovisions as I could afford. When this was over, we began to consider\r\nabout regaining the ship: he said, that there were twenty-six hands on\r\nboard, who knowing their lives were forfeited by the law, for conspiracy\r\nand mutiny, were so very hardened, that it would be dangerous for our\r\nsmall company to attack them. This was a reasonable inference indeed;\r\nbut something we must resolve on, and immediately, put in execution:\r\nwe, therefore heaved the boat upon the beach so high that she could not\r\nshoot off at high water mark, and broke a hole in her not easily to be\r\nstopped; so that all the signals they gave for the boat to come on board\r\nwere in vain. This obliged them to send another boat ashore, with ten\r\nmen armed, whose faces the Captain plainly descried, the boatswain being\r\nthe chief officer; but he said there were three honest lads among them,\r\nwho were forced into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage\r\n(for I had perceived he was in concern): In the mean while securing our\r\nprisoners, except two, whom we took to our assistance, we thought\r\nourselves able enough to adventure a battle. When the sailors landed,\r\nand beheld their boat in that condition, they not only hallooed, but\r\nfired for their companions to hear, yet they received no answer. This\r\nstruck them with horror and amazement, thinking their companions were\r\nmurdered, they made as if they would return to the ship. I could\r\nperceive the Captain's countenance change at this, till of a sudden\r\nthree men were ordered to look after the boat, while the other seven\r\nleapt on shore in order to search for their companions; and, indeed,\r\nthey came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient castle, from whence\r\nthey could see to a great distance in the woods, and there shooting and\r\nhallooing till tired and weary, they at length seated themselves under a\r\nspreading tree. My opinion was, that nothing could be done till night,\r\nwhen I might use some artifice to get them all out of the boat; but of a\r\nsudden they started up, and made to the sea-side; hereupon I ordered\r\nFriday and the Captain's mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud\r\nas they could, and so decoying them into the woods, come round to me\r\nagain. And this, indeed, had good effect; for they followed the noise,\r\ntill coming westward to the creek, they called for their boat to carry\r\nthem over, and taking one of the men out of her, left two to look after\r\nher, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on shore.\r\nHereupon immediately the Captain and our party passing the creek, out of\r\ntheir sight, we surprised them both, by the Captain's knocking down one,\r\nand ordering the other in surrender upon pain of death, and who being\r\nthe honestest of them all, sincerely joined with us. By this time it was\r\npretty late; when the rest returning to there boat, which they found\r\naground in the creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran about\r\nwringing their hands, crying it was an enchanted island, and that they\r\nshould be all murdered by spirits or devils. My men would willingly have\r\nfallen upon them, but I would not agree to hazard any of our party. But\r\nto be more certain, Friday & the Captain crawled upon their hands &\r\nfeet, as near as possible; and when the boatswain approached in sight,\r\nso eager was the Captain, that he fired and killed him on the spot;\r\nFriday wounded the next man, and a third ran away. Hereupon I advanced\r\nwith, my whole army: and, it being dark, I ordered the man we had\r\nsurprised in the boat, to call them by their names, and to parley with\r\nthem. Accordingly he called out aloud, _Tom Smith, Tom Smith!_ He\r\nanswered, _Who's that? Robinson!_ answered the other. _For God's sake\r\nTom, surrender immediately, or you're all dead men. Who must we\r\nsurrender to?_ says Smith. _To our captain and fifty men here, who have\r\ntaken me prisoner, wounded Will Frye, and killed the boatswain. Shall we\r\nhave quarter then?_ said he. Hereupon the Captain calls out, _You Smith,\r\nyou know my voice, surrender immediately, and you shall all have your\r\nlives granted, except Will Atkins_. Hereupon Atkins cries out, _What\r\nhave I done Captain, more than the rest, who have been as bad as me?_\r\nBut that was a lie, for he was the person that laid hold of him, and\r\nbound him. However, he was ordered to submit to the governor's mercy,\r\nfor such was I called. And so, laying down their arms, we bound them\r\nall, and seized on their boat.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Captain expostulated with them, telling them that the\r\ngovernor was an Englishman, who might execute them there; but he thought\r\nthey would be sent to England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to\r\nprepare for death next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the Captain to\r\nintercede for his life, and the rest begged they might not be sent to\r\nEngland. This answered our project for seizing the ship. For after\r\nsending Atkins and two of the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest\r\nbeing committed to my bower, I sent the Captain to treat with them in\r\nthe, governor's name, offering them pardon if they would assist in\r\nrecovering the ship. Upon which they all promised to stand by him till\r\nthe last drop of their blood; and whoever acted treacherously, should be\r\nhanged in chains upon the beach. They were all released on these\r\nassurances: and then the Captain repaired to the other boat, making his\r\npassenger Captain of her, and gave him four men well armed; while\r\nhimself, his mate, and five more, went in the other boat. By midnight\r\nthey came within call of the ship, when the Captain ordered Robinson to\r\nhale her, and tell them that with great difficulty they had found the\r\nmen at last. But while they were discoursing, the Captain, his mate and\r\nthe rest entered, and knocked down the second mate and carpenter,\r\nsecured those that were upon the deck, by putting them under hatches,\r\nwhile the other boat's crew entered and secured the forecastle; they\r\nthen broke into the round-house, where the mate after some resistance,\r\nshot the pirate captain through the head, upon which all the rest\r\nyielded themselves prisoners. And thus the ship being recovered, the\r\njoyful signal was fired, which I heard with the greatest joy imaginable:\r\nnor was it long before he brought the ship to an anchor at the creek's\r\nmouth, where, coming to me unawares, _There_, says he _my dearest friend\r\nand deliverer, there is your ship, and we are your servants_: a comfort\r\nso unspeakable, as made me swoon in his arms while, with gratitude to\r\nHeaven, we were tenderly embracing each other.\r\n\r\nNothing now remaining, but to consult what we should do with the\r\nprisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to take on board. Hereupon\r\nconcerting with the Captain, I dressed myself in one of his suits, and\r\nsending for them, told them, that I was going to leave the island with\r\nall my people, if they would tarry there, their lives should be spared;\r\nif not, they should be hanged at the first port they came at. They\r\nagreed to stay. Hereupon I told them my whole story, charging them to be\r\nkind to the Spaniards that were expected, gave them, all my arms, and\r\ninforming them of every thing necessary for their subsistence, I and my\r\nman Friday went on board. But the next morning two of the men came\r\nswimming to the ship's side, desiring the Captain to take them on board,\r\nthough he hanged them afterwards, complaining mightily how barbarously\r\nthe others used them. Upon which I prevailed with the Captain to take\r\nthem in; and being severely whipt and pickled, they proved more honest\r\nfor the future, and so I bid farewell to this island, carrying along\r\nwith me my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-skin cap; setting sail\r\nDecember 12, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen\r\ndays residence, that same day and month that I escaped from Sallee;\r\nlanding in England, June 11, 1687, after five and thirty years absence\r\nfrom my own country; which rendered me altogether a stranger there.\r\n\r\nHere I found my first Captain's widow alive, who had buried a second\r\nhusband, but in very mean circumstances, and whom I made easy upon his\r\naccount. Soon after I went down to Yorkshire, where all my family were\r\nexpired, except two sisters, and as many of one of my brother's\r\nchildren. I found no provision had been made for me, they concluding I\r\nhad been long since dead; so that I was but in a very slender station.\r\nIndeed the Captain did me a great kindness, by his report to the owners,\r\nhow I had delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, upon which they\r\nmade me a present of 200£. sterling. I next went to Lisbon, taking my\r\nman Friday with me, and there arriving in April, I met the Portuguese\r\nCaptain who had taken me on board on the African coast; but, being\r\nancient, he had left off the sea, and resigned all his business to his\r\nson, who followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that we\r\ndid not know each other at first, till I discovered myself more fully to\r\nhim. After a few embraces, I began to enquire of my concerns; and then\r\nthe old gentleman told me that it was nine years since he had been at\r\nBrazil, where my partner was then living, but my trustees were both\r\ndead; that he believed I should have a good account of the product of my\r\nplantation; that the imagination of my being lost, had obliged my\r\ntrustees to give an estimate of my share to the procurator fiscal, who,\r\nin case of my not returning, had given one third to the king & the rest\r\nto the monastery of St. Augustine: but if I put in my claim, or any one\r\nfor me, it would be returned, except the yearly product which was given\r\nto the poor. I then desired him to tell me what improvement he thought\r\nhad been made of my plantation, and whether he imagined it was worth my\r\nwhile to look after it? he answered, he did not know how much it was\r\nimproved; but this he was certain of, that my partner was grown vastly\r\nrich upon his half of it; and, that he had been informed, that the kind\r\nhad 200 moidores per annum of his third part. He added, that the\r\nsurvivors of my trustees were nervous of an ingenuous character; that my\r\npartner could witness my title, my name being registered in the country,\r\nby which means I should indefensibly recover considerable sums of money,\r\nbut, answered, I, how could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I\r\nmade you only my heir? This, said he, was true but, there being no\r\naffidavit made of my death he could not act as my executor. However, he\r\nhad ordered his don,(then at Brazil), to act by procuration upon my\r\naccount, and he had taken possession of my sugar-house, having accounted\r\nhimself for eight years with my partner and trustees for the profits, of\r\nwhich he would give me a very good account.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few days, making\r\nhimself indebted to me 470 moidores of gold, over and above what had\r\nbeen lost at sea, after I had left the place. And then he recounted to\r\nme what misfortune he had gone through, which forced my money out of his\r\nhands, to buy part in a new ship-but says he, _you shall not want, take\r\nthis; and, when my son returns, every farthing shall be paid you._ Upon\r\nwhich he put into my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold, as likewise\r\nthe instrument, containing the title to the ship which his son was in,\r\nand which he offered as security for the remainder. But really when I\r\nsaw so much goodness, generosity, tenderness, and real honesty, I had\r\nnot the heart to accept it, for fear he should straiten himself upon my\r\naccount. _It is true,_ said he, _it may be so; but then the money is\r\nyours, not mine, and you may have the greatest occasion for it._\r\nHowever, I returned fifty of them back again, promising that I would\r\nfreely forgive him the other hundred when I got my effects into my\r\nhands, and that I designed to go myself for that purpose. But he told me\r\nhe could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter my name with a\r\npublic notary, as likewise my affidavit, with a procuration affixed to\r\nit; and this he ordered me to send in a letter to one of his\r\nacquaintance, a merchant in Brazil; and, indeed, nothing could be more\r\nfaithfully and honourably observed; for, in seven months time, I had a\r\nvery faithful account of all my effects, what sums of money were raised,\r\nwhat expended, and what remained for myself! In a word I found myself\r\nto be worth 5000£. sterling, and 1000 per annum. Nor was this all, for\r\nmy partner congratulated me upon my being alive, telling me how much my\r\nplantation was improved; what Negroes were at work, and how many _Ave\r\nMarias_ he had said to the Virgin Mary for my preservation, desiring me\r\nto accept kindly some presents he had sent me, which I found showed the\r\ngreatest generosity.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the ship arrive, but I rewarded my faithful Captain, by\r\nreturning him the hundred moidores, and not only forgiving him all he\r\nowed me, I allowed him yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his son,\r\nduring their lives. And now being resolved to go to England, I returned\r\nletters of thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in particular to my\r\nold partner, with very suitable presents. By the Captain's advice, I was\r\npersuaded to go by land to Calais, and there take passage for England:\r\nwhen, as it happened, I got a young English gentleman, a merchant's son\r\nat Lisbon, to accompany me, together with two English, and two\r\nPortuguese gentleman: so that with a Portuguese servant, an English\r\nsailor, and my man Friday, there were nine of us in number.\r\n\r\nThus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to Madrid, when the summer\r\ndecaying, we hasted to Navarre, where we were informed that there was\r\nscarcely any passing, be reason of the prodigious quantity of snow; so\r\nthat we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pamoeluria, and at\r\nlast to take a guide to conduct us safe towards Tholouse. And now twelve\r\nother gentlemen joining with us, together with their servants, we had a\r\nvery jolly company. Away our guide led us by frightful mountains, and\r\nthrough so many intricate mazes and windings, that we insensibly passed\r\nthem, which, as we travelled along, ushered us into the prospect of the\r\nfruitful and charming provinces of Languedoc and Galcoigne.\r\n\r\nBut now came on two adventures, both tragical and comical. First, our\r\nguide was encountered by three wolves and a bear, who set upon him and\r\nhis horse, and wounded him in three places; upon which my man, riding up\r\nto his assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which made the\r\nothers retire into the woods. But the pleasantest adventure was, to\r\nbehold my man attack the bear. 'Tis such a creature, that if you let him\r\nalone, he will never meddle with you, and this my man very well knew,\r\nand so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us, _he would make\r\ngood laugh_. 'Why, you silly fool,' said I, 'he'll eat you up at a\r\nmouthful.' _Eatee me up,_ replied he, by way of scorn, _me not only\r\neatee him, but make much good laugh._ Upon which, pulling off his boots,\r\nhe claps on his pumps, and running after the monstrous beast, he called\r\nout, that he wanted to discourse with him, and then throwing stones on\r\npurpose to incense him, the beast turns about in fury, and, with\r\nprodigious strides, shuffles after him. But though he was not swift\r\nenough to keep up pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were for\r\nhelp; yet being angry, 'You dog,' said I, 'immediately take horse, and\r\nlet us shoot the creature.' But he cried, _Dear master, no shoot, me\r\nmake you laugh much._ And so he turned about, making signs to follow,\r\nwhile the bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he ascended in a\r\nminute, leaving his gun, at the bottom of it. Nor did the bear make any\r\ndifficulty of it, but ascended like a cat, though his weight was very\r\ngreat. You must consider I was not a little amazed at the folly of my\r\nman, as not perceiving any thing to occasion our laughter, till such\r\ntime as we rode up nearer, and beheld the bear mounted upon the oak, on\r\nthe beginning of the same branch, to which Friday clung at the farther\r\nend, where the bear durst not come. Hereupon Friday cried out, _Now\r\nmaster, me make much laugh, me make bear dance._ Upon which he fell a\r\nshaking the bough, which made the creature look behind him, to see how\r\nhe could retreat. Then as if the bear had understood his stammering\r\nEnglish, _Why you no come farther, Mr. Bear_ said he, _pray, Mr. Bear\r\ncome farther_; and then indeed we all burst into a laughter; especially\r\nwhen we perceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the ground, leaving\r\nthe beast to make the best of his way down the tree. And now thinking it\r\nthe most convenient time to shoot the creature, Friday cried out, _O\r\ndear master, no shoot, me shoot by and by_; when taking up the gun, _me\r\nno shoot yet_, said he _me make one more much laugh._ And accordingly he\r\nwas as good as his word; for the creature descending backwards from the\r\ntree very leisurely, before he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday\r\nshot him through the ear, stone dead; and looking to see whether we were\r\npleased, he burst out into a hearty laughter, saying, _So we kill de\r\nbear in my country, not with the gun, but with much long arrows._ Thus\r\nended our diversion, to our great satisfaction; especially in a place\r\nwhere the terrible howlings struck us with a continual terror. But the\r\nsnows now growing very deep, particularly on the mountains, the ravenous\r\ncreatures were then obliged to seek for sustenance in the villages, were\r\ncoming by surprise on the country people, killed several of them,\r\nbesides a great number of their sheep and horses.\r\n\r\nOur guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous place to pass by; and\r\nif their were any more wolves in the country, there we should find them.\r\nThis was a small plain encompassed with woods, to get through a long\r\nlane to the village where we were to lodge. When we entered the wood,\r\nthe sun was within half an hour of setting: and a little after it was\r\nset, we came into the plain, which was not above two furlongs over, and\r\nthen we perceived five great wolves cross the road, without taking\r\nnotice of us, and so swift as though they were pursuing after their\r\nprey. Hereupon our guide, believing there were more coming, desired us\r\nto be on our guard. Accordingly our eyes were very circumspect, till\r\nabout half a league farther, we perceived a dead horse, and near a dozen\r\nof wolves devouring its carcase. My man Friday fain would have fired at\r\nthem, but I would not permit him; nor had we gone half over the plain,\r\nbut we heard dreadful howlings in a wood on our left, when presently we\r\nsaw an hundred come up against us, as though they had been an\r\nexperienced army. This obliged us to form ourselves in the best manner;\r\nand then I ordered that every other man should fire, that those who did\r\nnot, might be ready to gave a second volley, should they advance upon\r\nus; and then every man should make use of his pistols. But there was no\r\nnecessity for this; for the enemy being terrified stopped at the noise\r\nof the fire; four of them were shot dead, and, several others being\r\nwounded; went bleeding away, as we could very plainly discover by the\r\nsnow. And now remembering what had been often told me, that such was the\r\nmajesty of a man's voice, as to strike terror even in the fiercest\r\ncreatures, I ordered all our companions to halloo as loud as possible;\r\nand in this notion I was not altogether mistaken; for they immediately\r\nturned about upon the first halloo, and began to retire; upon which,\r\nordering a second volley in their rear, they galloped into the woods\r\nwith great precipitation.\r\n\r\nThus we had some small time to load our pieces again, and then made all\r\nthe haste we could on our way; but we had not rode far, before we were\r\nobliged to put ourselves in a posture of defence as before, being\r\nalarmed with a very dreadful noise in the same wood, on our left hand,\r\nthe same way as we were to pass, only that it was at some distance from\r\nus. By this time the darksome clouds began to spread over the elements,\r\nand the night growing very dusky, made it so much the more to our\r\ndisadvantage; but still the noise increasing, we were fully assured,\r\nthat it was the howling and the yelling of those ravenous creatures;\r\nwhen presently three troops of wolves on our front appeared in sight, as\r\nthough a great number of them had a design to surround us, and devour us\r\nin spite of fate. But as they did not fall upon us immediately, we\r\nproceeded on our journey in as swift a manner as the roads would permit\r\nour horses, which was only a large trot. It was in this manner we\r\ntravelled, till such a time as we discovered another wood, and had the\r\nprospect of its entrance through which were to pass, at the farthest\r\nside of the plain. But surely none can express the terror we were in,\r\nwhen approaching the lane, we perceived a confused number of the\r\nfiercest wolves, standing, as it were guarding its entrance. Nor were we\r\nlong in this amazement, before another occasion of horror presented\r\nitself; for suddenly we heard the report of a gun at another opening in\r\nthe wood and, looking that way, out ran a horse bridled and saddled,\r\nflying with the greatest swiftness, and no less than sixteen or\r\nseventeen wolves pursuing after him, in order to devour the poor\r\ncreature; and unquestionably they did so, after they had run him down,\r\nnot being able to hold out that swiftness with which he at first\r\nescaped them.\r\n\r\nWhen we rode up to that entrance from whence the horse came forth, there\r\nlay the carcases of another horse & two men, mangled and torn by these\r\ndevouring wolves; and undoubtedly one of these men was the person who\r\nfired the gun which we had heard, for the piece lay by him; but alas!\r\nmost of the upper part of his body and his head were entombed in the\r\nbowels of these ravenous creatures.\r\n\r\nWhat course to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we could not tell;\r\nbut it was not long before the wolves themselves made us to come to a\r\nresolution; for such numbers surrounded us, every one of whom expected\r\ntheir prey, that were our bodies to be divided among them, there would\r\nnot be half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very happy it was for us,\r\nthat but a little way from the entrance, there lay some very large\r\ntimber trees, which I supposed had been cut down and laid there for\r\nsale: amongst which I drew my little troop, placing ourselves in a line\r\nbehind one long tree, which served us for a breast work, when desiring\r\nthem to alight, we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, closing our\r\nbodies in the centre, the only place where we could preserve them.\r\n\r\nNever certainly was there a more furious charge than what the wolves\r\nmade upon us in this place: and the sight of the horses, which was the\r\nprincipal prey they aimed at, provoked their hunger, and added to their\r\nnatural fierceness. They came on us with a most dreadful noise, that\r\nmade the woods ring again: and beginning to mount the pieces of timber,\r\nI ordered every man to fire, as before directed: and, indeed, so well\r\ndid they take their aim, that they killed several of the wolves at the\r\nfirst volley; but still we were obliged to keep a continual firing, by\r\nreason they came on like devils, pushing one another with the greatest\r\nfury. But our second volley something abated their courage, when\r\nstopping a little, we hoped they would have made the best of their way,\r\nhowever, it did not prove so, for others made a new attempt upon us; and\r\nthough in four firings, we killed seventeen or eighteen of them, laming\r\ntwice as many, yet they several times successively came on, as though\r\nthey valued not their lives for the sake of their prey.\r\n\r\nUnwilling was I to spend our last shot too suddenly, and therefore\r\ncalling my other servant, and giving him a horn of powder, bid him lay a\r\nlarge train quite along the timber, which he did, while Friday was\r\ncharging my fusee and his own, with the greatest dexterity. By this time\r\nthe wolves coming up the timber, I set fire to the train, by snapping a\r\ndischarged pistol close to the powder. This so scorched and terrified\r\nthem, that some fell down, and others jumped in among us: but there\r\nwere immediately dispatched, when all the rest, frighted with the\r\nlight, which the darksome night caused to appear more dreadful, began at\r\nlength to retire; upon which ordering our last pistols to be fired at\r\nonce, giving at the same time a great shout, the wolves were obliged to\r\nhave recourse to their swiftness, and turn tail; and then we sallied out\r\nupon twenty lame ones, cutting them in pieces with our swords, which\r\nobliged them to howl lamentably, to the terror of their fellows, who\r\nresigned to us the field as victorious conquerors. And, indeed, I\r\nquestion whether Alexander king of Macedonia, in any of his conquests,\r\nhad more occasion for triumph than we had; for he was but attacked with\r\nnumerous armies of soldiers; whereas our little army was obliged to\r\ncombat a legion of devils, as it were, worse than the cannibals, who,\r\nthe same moment they had slain us, would have sacrificed us, to satisfy\r\ntheir voracious appetites.\r\n\r\nThus ended our bloody battle with the beasts, having killed threescore\r\nof them, and saved our lives from their fury. We still had a league\r\nfurther to go, when, as we went, our ears were saluted with their most\r\nunwelcome howlings, and we expected every moment another attack. But, in\r\nan hour's time, we arrived at the town where we were to lodge; and here\r\nwe found the place strictly guarded, and all in terrible confusion, as\r\nwell they might, for fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the\r\nvillage, in order to prey upon their cattle and people. The next morning\r\nwe were obliged to take a new guide, by reason the other fell very bad\r\nof his wounds, which he had received as before mentioned. After we had\r\nreached Tholouse, we came into a warm, pleasant, and fruitful country,\r\nnot infested with wolves, nor any sort of ravenous creatures: and when\r\nwe told our story there, they much blamed our guide, for conducting us\r\nthrough the forest at the foot of the mountains, in such a severe\r\nseason, when the snow obliged the wolves to seek for shelter in the\r\nwoods. When we informed them in what manner we placed ourselves, and the\r\nhorses in the centre, they exceedingly reprehended us, and told us, it\r\nwas an hundred to one, but we had been all destroyed; for that it was\r\nthe very sight of the horses, their so much desired prey, that made the\r\nwolves more ragingly furious than they would have been, which was\r\nevident, by their being at other times really afraid of a gun; but then\r\nbeing exceedingly hungry and furious upon that account, their eagerness\r\nto come at the horses made them insensible of their danger; and that, if\r\nwe had not, by a continual fire, and at last by the cunning stratagem of\r\nthe train of powder, got the better of them, it had been great odds if\r\ntheir number had not overpowered us; besides, it was a great mercy we\r\nalighted from our horses, and fought them with that courage and conduct,\r\nwhich, had we failed to do, every man of us, with our beasts, had been\r\ndevoured: and, indeed, this was nothing but truth; for never in my life\r\nwas I so sensible of danger, as when three hundred, devils came roaring\r\nupon us, to shun whose unwelcome company, if I was sure to meet a storm\r\nevery week; I would rather go a thousand leagues by sea.\r\n\r\nI think I have, nothing uncommon in my passage through France to take\r\nnotice of, since other travellers of greater learning and ingenuity,\r\nhave given more ample account than my pen is able to set forth. From\r\nTholouse I travelled to Paris, from thence to Calais, where I took\r\nshipping, and landed at Dover the 14th of January, in a very\r\ncold season.\r\n\r\nThus come to the end of my travels, I soon discovered my new found\r\nestate, and all the bills of exchange I had were currently paid. The\r\ngood ancient widow, my only privy counsellor, thought no pains nor care\r\ntoo great to procure my advantage, nor had I ever occasion to blame her\r\nfidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was for leaving my\r\neffects in her hands, intending to set out for Lisbon, and so the\r\nBrazils; but as in the Desolate Island I had some doubt about the Romish\r\nreligion, so I knew there was little encouragement to settle there,\r\nunless I would apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live in continual\r\nfear of the Inquisition. Upon this account I resolved to sell my\r\nplantation; and, for that intent, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,\r\nwho returned to me an answer to my great satisfaction; which was, that\r\nhe could sell it to good account; however, if I thought it convenient to\r\ngive him liberty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the\r\nsurvivors of my trustees residing at the Brazils, who consequently knew\r\nits intrinsic value, having lived just upon the spot, and who I was\r\nsensible were very rich, and therefore might be the more willing to\r\npurchase it: he did not in the least doubt, but that I should make four\r\nor five thousand pieces of eight more of it, than I could, if I disposed\r\nof it in any other manner whatsoever.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure I could not but agree with this kind and ingenuous\r\nproposal; and immediately I sent him an order to offer it to them, which\r\nhe accordingly did; so that about eight months after, the ship being in\r\nthat time returned, he gave me a satisfactory account, that they not\r\nonly willingly accepted the offer, but that they had also remitted\r\n33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondence of their own at Lisbon, in\r\norder to pay for the purchase.\r\n\r\nHereupon, in return, I signed the instrument of sale, according to form,\r\nwhich they had sent from Lisbon, and returned it again to my old friend,\r\nhe having sent me, for me estate, bills of three hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight thousand pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one\r\nhundred moidores per annum, which I had allowed him during life,\r\nlikewise: fifty to his son during life also, according to my faithful\r\npromise, which the plantation was to make good as a rent charge.\r\n\r\nAnd thus having led my reader to the knowledge of the first parts of my\r\nlife so remarkable for the many peculiar providences that attended it,\r\nfloating in the ocean of uncertainty and disappointment, of adversity\r\nand prosperity, beginning foolishly, and yet ending happily; methinks\r\nnow that I am come to a safe & pleasant haven, it is time to cast out my\r\nanchor, &c, laying up my vessel, bid, for a while, adieu to foreign\r\nadventures. I had no other concerns to look after but the care of my\r\nbrother's two sons, which, with the good widow's persuasions, obliged me\r\nto continue at home seven years. One of these children I bred up a\r\ngentleman, and the other an experienced sailor, remarkable for his\r\ncourage and bravery. Besides this, I married a virtuous young\r\ngentlewoman, of a very good family, by whom I had two sons and one\r\ndaughter. But my dear and tender wife leaving this earthly stage (as in\r\nthe second part of my life you will hear) which rent my soul as it were\r\nasunder, my native country became weary and tiresome to me; and my\r\nnephew happening to come from sea, tempted me to venture another voyage\r\nto the East Indies, which I did in the year 1694, at which time I\r\nvisited my island, and informed myself of every thing that happened\r\nsince my departure.\r\n\r\nOne might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffered, together with an\r\nadvanced age, and the fear of losing not only what I had gotten, but my\r\nlife also, might have choaked up all the seeds of youthful ambition and\r\ncuriosity, and put a lasting period to my wandering inclinations. But as\r\nnothing but death can fully allay the active part of my life, no less\r\nremarkable for the many various contingencies of it, you will next\r\nperceive how I visited my little kingdom, saw my successors the\r\nSpaniards, had an account of the usage they met with from the\r\nEnglishmen, agreeing and disagreeing, uniting and separating, till at\r\nlast they were subjected to the Spaniards, who yet used them very\r\nhonorably, together with the wonderful and successful battles over the\r\nIndians who invaded, and thought to have conquered the island, but were\r\nrepelled by their invincible courage and bravery, having taken eleven\r\nmen and five woman prisoners by which at my return, I found about twenty\r\nyoung children on my little kingdom. Here I staid twenty days, left them\r\nsupplies of all necessary things, as also a carpenter and smith, and\r\nshared the islands into parts, reserving the whole property to myself.\r\nNor will you be insensible, by the account of these things, of several\r\nnew adventures I have been engaged in, the battles I have fought, the\r\ndeliverances I have met with; and while, in the surprising relation of\r\nsuch remarkable occurrences, I shall describe many of God's kindest\r\nprovidences to me in particular, no less conspicuous in the same\r\ngoodness, power, and majesty of our great creator, shown one way or\r\nother, over the face of the earth, if duly adverted to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF\r\n\r\nROBINSON CRUSOE.\r\n\r\n_Wherein are contained several strange and surprising accounts of his\r\ntravels, and his most remarkable transactions both by sea and by land;\r\nwith his wonderful vision of the angelic world_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the puissant force of Nature and, what mighty influence\r\nit has many times over the temper of the mind, it will be no such great\r\nwonder to think, that my powerful reason should be overcome by a much\r\nstronger inclination. My late acquired kingdom ran continually in my\r\nthoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it in the night: nay, I made it\r\nthe continual subject of my talk, even to impertinence, when I was\r\nawake. I had such vapours in my head, that I actually supposed myself at\r\nmy castle; that I not only perceived Friday's father the old Spaniard,\r\nand the wicked sailors, but that I talked and discoursed with them about\r\ntheir manner of living; that I heard the things related to me, which I\r\nfound afterwards to be true; & that I executed my judgments with the\r\ngreatest severity upon the offenders. And, indeed, this anticipating all\r\nthe pleasing joys of my life, scarcely afforded me one pleasant hour: my\r\ndear and tender wife could not but take notice of it, which drew those\r\naffectionate speeches from her: _My dear,_ said she, _I am really\r\npersuaded that some secret impulse from Heaven occasions in you a\r\ndetermination to see the island again; nor am I less sensible, but your\r\nbeing engaged to me and these dear children is the only hinderance of\r\nyour departure. I know my dear, if I were in the grave, you would not\r\nlong continue at home; prevent not your happiness on my account, whose\r\nonly comfort centres in you. All that I can object is, that such an\r\nhazardous undertaking is no way consistent with a person of your years;\r\nbut if you are resolved to go,_ added she, weeping, _only permit me to\r\nbear you company, and that is all that I desire._\r\n\r\nSuch endearing tenderness, graced with the most innocent and yet most\r\npowerful charms, brought me insensibly into my right understanding; and\r\nwhen I considered all the transactions of my life, and particularly my\r\nnew engagement, that I had now one child already born, and my wife big\r\nof another; and that I had no occasion to seek for more riches, who\r\nalready was blessed with sufficiency, with much struggling I altered my\r\nresolutions at last, resolving to apply myself to some business or\r\nother, which might put a period to such wandering inclinations. Hereupon\r\nI bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, with a resolution to\r\nmove thither; upon this there was a pretty convenient house surrounded\r\nwith land, very capable of improvement, which suited my temper, as to\r\nplanting, managing, and cultivating. Nor was I long before I entered\r\nupon my new settlement, having bought ploughs, harrows, carts, waggons,\r\nhorses, cows, and sheep; so that I now led the life of a country\r\ngentleman, and as happy in my retirement as the greatest monarch in the\r\nworld. And what made me think my happiness the greater was, that I was\r\nin the middle state of life, which my father had so often recommended,\r\nmuch resembling the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly\r\ndescribed by the poet in these lines:\r\n\r\n_Free from all vices, free from care,\r\nAge has no pain, and youth no snare._\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of this my happiness, I was suddenly plunged in the\r\ngreatest sorrow that I could possibly endure; for when I least expected\r\nit, my dear and tender wife was forced to submit to the irresistable\r\npower of Death, leaving this transitory life for a better. It is\r\nimpossible for me to express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness\r\nof her person; neither can I too much lament her loss, which my latest\r\nbreath shall record; her influence was greater over me, than the powers\r\nof my own reason, the importunities of friends, the instructions of a\r\nfather, or the melting tears of a tender and disconsolate mother; in a\r\nword, she was the spirit of all my affairs, and the centre of my\r\nenterprizes. But now, since the cruel hand of Death had closed my\r\ndearest's eyes, I seemed in my thoughts a stranger to the world; my\r\nprivy counsellor being gone, I was like a ship without a pilot, that\r\ncould only run before the wind. And when I looked around me in this busy\r\nworld, one party labouring for bread, and the other squandering away\r\ntheir estates; this put me in mind how I had lived in my little kingdom,\r\nwhere both reason and religion dictated to me, that there was something\r\nthat certainly was the reason and end of life, which was far superior to\r\nwhat could be hoped for on this side the grave. My country delights were\r\nnow as insiped and dull, as music and science to those who have neither\r\ntaste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave off house-keeping, I\r\nleft my farm, and in a few months returned to London.\r\n\r\nBut neither could that great city, so famous for its variety of\r\nentertainment, afford me any agreeable delight; a state of idleness I\r\nfound to be the very dregs of life, and most hurtful to body and soul.\r\nIt was now the beginning of the year 1684, at which time my nephew (who\r\nas I before observed had been brought up to the sea, and advanced to be\r\ncaptain of a ship) was returned from a short voyage to Bilboz, the first\r\nhe had made in that station. He comes to me one morning, telling me that\r\nsome merchants of his acquaintance had proposed to him to go a voyage\r\nfor them to the East Indies and China in the manner of private traders;\r\n_and now uncle_, said he, _if you'll accompany me thither, I'll engage\r\nto land you upon your old island, to visit the state of your\r\nlittle kingdom_.\r\n\r\nJust before he came in, my thoughts were fixed to get a patent for its\r\npossession, and then to fill it with inhabitants. After I had paused a\r\nwhile, and looked stedfastly on him. _What devil or spirit_, said I,\r\n_sent you with this unlucky errand_? He started at first; but recovering\r\nhimself, when he perceived I was not offended; _Sir_, replied he, _what\r\nI have proposed cannot I hope, be styled unlucky, since certainly you\r\nmust be desirous to see your little territory, where you reigned with\r\nmore content, than any of your brother kings in the universe. Nephew_,\r\nsaid I, _if you will leave me there, and call for me as you came back, I\r\ncare not if I give my consent_: but he answered, _that the merchants\r\nwould not allow their vessel loaden with an infinite value, to return\r\nthere again, which was a month's sail out of the way; besides, Sir_ said\r\nhe, _if I should miscarry, was your request granted, why then you would\r\nbe locked up as before_. This indeed carried a great deal of reason in\r\nit; but we found out a remedy, and that was to carry a framed sloop on\r\nboard, ready to be set up in the island, by the assistance of some\r\ncarpenters, which we should carry with us, that might be fitted in a few\r\ndays to go to sea. I was not long in forming my resolution, which\r\noverswayed my good friend the widow's persuasions, and the natural\r\naffection I bore to my young children. I made my will, and settled my\r\nestate in such manner, that I was perfectly sure my poor infants would\r\nhave justice done them. The good widow not only undertook to make\r\nprovision, for my voyage, but also took the charge of my domestic\r\naffairs, and to provide for my children's education; and indeed no\r\nmother could take more care, or understood that office better; for which\r\nI lived to reward and return her my hearty thanks.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of January, 1694.5, my nephew being ready to sail, I and\r\nFriday went on board in the Downs on the 8th, having, besides that sloop\r\nalready mentioned, a very considerable cargo for my new colony. First, I\r\nhad some servants, whom I proposed to leave there, as they should appear\r\nwilling; there were two carpenters, a smith, and a very ingenuous fellow\r\nwho was Jack-of-all-trades; for he was not only a cooper by trade, but\r\nalso he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn,\r\nlikewise a good turner, and a good pot-maker. I also carried a tailor,\r\nwho consented to stay in my plantation, and proved a most necessary\r\nfellow in the island. As to my cargo, it consisted of a sufficient\r\nquantity of linen, and English stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I\r\nexpected to find there; as likewise gloves, hats, shoes, stockings;\r\ntogether with beds, bedding, and household stuff, especially kitchen\r\nutensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c. also nails, tools of\r\nall sorts, staples, hooks, hinges, and all other things necessary; all\r\nwhich, I think, cost me about three hundred pounds. Nor was this all for\r\nI carried an hundred spare arms, muskets, & fusees, besides some\r\npistols, a considerable quantity of several sorts of shot, two brass\r\ncannon, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and\r\nhalberts. I made my nephew take with us two small quarter-deck guns,\r\nmore than he had occasion for in his ship, to leave behind, if there was\r\na necessity; so that we might build a fort there, and man it against all\r\nopposers whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWell, we put out to sea; and though I can't say this voyage was so\r\nunprosperous as my others had been, yet contrary winds drove us so far\r\nnorthward, that we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we\r\nlay wind-bound two and twenty days. Here indeed our provisions were very\r\ncheap, and we added to our ship's stores by taking several live hogs,\r\ntwo cows and calves, which I then resolved to put on shore in my island,\r\nif our necessities did not call for them. On the 5th of February we\r\nsailed from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for some days;\r\nand I think it was about the 20th of the same month late in the evening,\r\nwhen the mate informed us, that he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun\r\nfired: and when he was speaking a boy came in and told us, that the\r\nboatswain had heard another. Upon which we all ran to the quarter-deck,\r\nfrom whence, in a few moments, we perceived a terrible fire at a\r\ndistance. We had immediately recourse to our reckonings, in which, we\r\nwere all of opinion, that there could be no land that way, it appearing\r\nto be at N.N.W. Hereupon we concluded that some ship had taken fire at\r\nsea, and that it could not be far off by the report of the guns which we\r\nhad heard. We made up directly to it, and in half an hour's time the\r\nwind being fair, we could plainly perceive a great ship on fire in the\r\nmiddle of the sea. Touched with this unhappy disaster, and considering\r\nmy former circumstances, when the Portuguese Captain took me up, I\r\nimmediately ordered five guns to be fired that the poor creatures, not\r\nseeing us, it being dark, (though we could perceive their flame) might\r\nbe sensible there was deliverance at hand, and consequently might\r\nendeavor to save themselves in their boat. Nor was it long before the\r\nship blew up in the air and the fire was extinguished in the ocean. But\r\nsupposing them all to be in their boats, we hung out our lanterns and\r\nkept firing till eight o'clock in the morning; when with our\r\nperspectives, we beheld two boats full of people making towards us tho'\r\nthe tide was against them then spreading out our ancient; and hanging\r\nout a waft, as a signal for them to come on board, in half an hour's\r\ntime; we came up to them, and took them all in, there being no less than\r\nsixty-four men, women, and children. It was a French merchant ship of\r\nthree hundred tons; homeward bound from Quebec in the river of Canada.\r\nThe master informed me how, by the negligence of the steersman, the\r\nsteerage was set on fire: that, at his outcry for help, the fire was, as\r\nwe thought totally extinguished; but, that some sparks getting between\r\nthe timber, and within the ceiling, it proceeded into the hold, where\r\nthere was no resisting it; & then they got into their boats, as\r\ncreatures in the last extremity, with what provision they had, together\r\nwith oars, sails, and a compass, intending to go back to Newfoundland,\r\nthe wind blowing at S.E. and by E. though there were several chances\r\nagainst them as storms to overset and founder them, rains and colds to\r\nbenumb and perish their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them back and\r\nstarve them; _But_, said he, _in this our great distress we heard the\r\nwelcome report of your guns, when with unspeakable joy, taking down our\r\nmasts and sails, we were resolved to lie by till morning; but perceiving\r\nyour light, we set our oars at work, to keep our boat a head, the sooner\r\nto attain your ship, the happy instrument of our deliverance_.\r\n\r\nIndeed no one can express the joy of these poor creatures on this\r\noccasion: fear and grief are easily set forth; sighs and tears, with a\r\nfew motions of the hands and head, are all the demonstrations of these\r\npassions; but an excess of joy, carries in it a thousand extravagancies;\r\nespecially, I think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to be\r\nmore volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that of other\r\nnations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in the greatest agonies\r\nof sorrow, and running stark mad about the ship, while the rest were\r\nstamping with their feet, wringing their hands, singing, laughing,\r\nswooning away, vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to\r\nthe Almighty; and crossing themselves. I think, if I am not mistaken,\r\nour surgeon was obliged to let thirty of them blood. But among the\r\npassengers, there were two priests, the one an old, and the other a\r\nyoung man; but what amazed me more was, that the oldest was in the worst\r\nplight; for no sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he\r\ndropt down as it were without life, and to every one's appearance quite\r\ndead; but the surgeon chasing and rubbing his arm, opened a vein, which\r\nat first dropped, and then flowing more freely, the old man began to\r\nopen his eyes; and in a quarter of an hour was well again. But soon\r\nremembering this happy change, the joy of which whirled his blood about\r\nfaster than the vessels could convey it, he became so feverish, as made\r\nhim more fit for bedlam than any other place. But the surgeon giving\r\nhim a sleepy dose, he was perfectly composed the next morning.\r\n\r\nRemarkable indeed was the behaviour of the young priest. At his entrance\r\non board the ship, he fell on his face in the most humble prostration to\r\nthe Almighty. I thought, indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran\r\nto help him up; but he modestly told me, _he was returning his thanks to\r\nthe Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to\r\nhis Creator, he would return me thanks also_. And indeed he did so about\r\nthree minutes after, with great seriousness, and affection, while the\r\ntears stood in his eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of his\r\nsoul. Nor did he less show his piety and wisdom in applying himself to\r\nhis country people, and labouring to compose them, by the most powerful\r\nreasons, arguments, and persuasions. And when, indeed, these people had\r\ntaken their night's repose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we\r\nfound nothing but the best of manners, and the most civil\r\nacknowledgements, for which the French are eminently remarkable. The\r\nnext day the Captain and one of the priests desired to speak with me and\r\nmy nephew the commander. They told us, _that they had saved some money\r\nand valuable things out of the ruined vessel, which was at our service;\r\nonly that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way_. At the\r\nfirst my nephew was for accepting the money; but I (who knew how hard my\r\ncase would have been, had the Portuguese Captain served me so) persuaded\r\nhim to the contrary; and therefore told them, _that as we had done\r\nnothing but what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, and what\r\nwe ourselves might expect from others in such calamity; so we took them\r\nup to save them, not to plunder them, or leave them naked upon the land,\r\nto perish for want of subsistance, and therefore would not accept their\r\nmoney: but as to landing them, that was a great difficulty; for being\r\nbound to the East Indies, it was impossible wilfully to change our\r\nvoyage upon their particular account, nor could my nephew_ (who was\r\nunder charter party to pursue it by was of Brazil) _answer it to the\r\nfreighters_. All that we could do, was to put ourselves in the way of\r\nmeeting some ships homeward bound from the West Indies, that, if\r\npossible, they might get a passage to France or England. Indeed, they\r\nwere very thankful for our first kindness; but were under great concern,\r\nespecially the passengers, at their being carried to the East Indies.\r\n_They begged therefore, I would keep on the banks of Newfoundland,\r\nwhere, probably, they might meet with some ship, or sloop to carry them\r\nto Canada, whence they came._ As this was but a reasonable request, I\r\nwas inclined to grant it, since it was no breach of charter party, and\r\nthat the laws of God and nature obliged us to do what good we could to\r\nour fellow-creatures; and besides the danger we ourselves should be in\r\nfor want of provisions: so we consented to carry them to Newfoundland,\r\nif wind and weather would permit; if not, that we should carry them to\r\nMartinico in the West Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time we\r\nmade the banks of Newfoundland, where the French people hired a bark to\r\ncarry them to France. But the young priest being desirous to go to the\r\nEast Indies, I readily agreed to it, because I liked his conversation,\r\nand two or three of the French sailors also entered themselves on\r\nboard our ship.\r\n\r\nNow directing our course for the West Indies, steering S. and S. by E.\r\nabout twenty days, with little wind, another adventure happened to\r\nexercise our humanity. In the latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north,\r\nthe 19th of March 1694-5, we perceived a sail, (our course S. E. and by\r\nS.) which bore upon us, and then she appeared to be a large vessel,\r\nhaving lost her main topmast and boltsprit; when firing a gun as a\r\nsignal of distress, wind N. N.W. we soon came to speak with her. She was\r\na ship from Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, out of which road she\r\nhad been forced in a hurricane to the westward, in which they lost\r\ntheir masts.\r\n\r\nThey told us, _their expectations were to see the Bahama islands, but\r\nwere driven away by a strong wind at N.N.W. and having no sails to work\r\nthe ship with, but the main-course and a kind of square sail upon a jury\r\nforemast, because they could not come near the land, were endeavouring\r\nto stand for the Canaries: nay what was worse, besides all their\r\nfatigue, they were almost starved for want of provision, having ate\r\nnothing for eleven all that they had aboard, was sugar, a barrel of\r\nfresh water and seven casks of rum_. In this ship were passengers, a\r\nyouth, his mother, and a maid-servant, who were in a most deplorable\r\ncondition for want of food. If I had not gone on board their ship, the\r\nknowledge of their misery had been concealed from me, and they would\r\nhave inevitably perished; though, indeed, their second mate who was\r\nCaptain, by reason the true Captain was not on board when the hurricane\r\nhappened, had before informed me that there was such persons on board,\r\nwhom he supposed to be dead, being afraid to inquire after them, because\r\nhe had nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon we resolved to let them\r\nhave what we could spare, ordering the mate to bring some of his men on\r\nboard us, which he did accordingly: as he and they looked like\r\nskeletons, when meat was set before them, I ordered them to eat\r\nsparingly. But, however they soon fell sick; which obliged the surgeon\r\nto mix something in their broth, which was to be to them both food and\r\nphysic. When they were fed, we ordered our mate to carry them a sack of\r\nbread, and four or five pieces of beef; but the surgeon charged them to\r\nsee it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook-room, to prevent the men\r\nfrom eating it raw, and consequently killing themselves with what was\r\ndesigned for their relief. But, particularly, I desired the mate to see\r\nwhat condition the poor passengers were in, and the surgeon gave him a\r\npitcher of the same broth which he had prepared for the men. And being\r\ncurious to see this scene of misery myself, I took the Captain (as we\r\ncalled the mate of the ship) in our own boat, and sailed after them.\r\n\r\nHere was a sad sight indeed! scarce were the victuals half boiled in the\r\npot; but they were ready to break open the cook-room door. To stay their\r\nstomachs the mate gave them biscuits, which were dipped in and softened\r\nthem with the liquor of the meat, which they call _bruise_; telling\r\nthem, it was for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them but\r\na little at a time; and so feeding them gradually, their bellies were\r\ncomfortable filled, and the men did very well again. But when they came\r\nto the poor gentlewoman in the cabin, who for several days had continued\r\nwithout food, giving what she had to her son, they found her as it were\r\nin the arms of death. She was sitting upon the floor of the deck, with\r\nher back up against the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed\r\nfast, and her head shrunk, between her shoulders, like a senseless\r\ncorpse. Nothing was wanting in my mate to revive and encourage her;\r\nopening her lips, and putting some broth into her mouth with a spoon.\r\nBut not having strength to speak, she lifted up her head with much\r\ndifficulty, intimating that it was now too late! at the same time\r\npointing to the youth her son, as though she desired him to do what he\r\ncould to save the lad; and in a little time after she died.\r\n\r\nThe youth, indeed, was not so far gone; yet lay stretched out on a cabin\r\nbed, like one that had scarce any life. In his mouth was a piece of an\r\nold glove, the rest of which he had ate up. At first he vomited what the\r\nmate had given him; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in\r\nthe greatest concern for the death of his tender mother.\r\n\r\nAs to the poor maid, she lay by her mistress, like one in the last pangs\r\nof death: her limbs were distorted, one of her hands were clasped round\r\nthe frame of a chair, which she grasped so hard, that it was with some\r\ndifficulty we separated her from it; her other arm lay over her head,\r\nand her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin\r\ntable; not only being, starved with hunger, but overcome with grief at\r\nthe loss of her mistress, whom she loved most tenderly. It was a great\r\nwhile before the surgeon could bring her to life, and a much longer time\r\nbefore she came to her senses.\r\n\r\nAfter we had sailed with them some days, we sent them five barrels of\r\nbeef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, with peas, flour, and other\r\nthings; taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight\r\nas payment, we left them, but took the youth and maid with us, with all\r\ntheir goods. The lad was about seventeen years old, very handsome,\r\nmodest, sensible, and well-bred, but mightily concerned for the loss\r\nof his honoured mother, having lost his father at Barbadoes but a few\r\nmonths before. He beseeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take him\r\nout of the ship; for that the sailors, not sparing a small sustenance,\r\nhad starved his mother. But hunger has no bounds, no right, and\r\nconsequently is incapable of any compassion. When the surgeon told him,\r\nour voyage might put him in bad circumstances, and farther from his\r\nfriends, he said _he did not care, if he was delivered from that terrible\r\ncrew; that as the Captain_ (meaning me) _had saved him from death, so he\r\nwas sure he would do him no harm; and, as for the maid, when she was\r\nrestored to her senses, she would be no less thankful, let us carry them\r\nwhere we would_. And indeed the surgeon so represented their case to me,\r\nthat I consented, and took them on board with all their goods, except\r\neleven hogsheads of sugar; but the youth having a bill of lading, I made\r\nthe commander oblige himself to deliver a letter and the deceased widow's\r\ngoods to Mr. Rogers, a merchant in Bristol; but I believe the ship was\r\nlost at sea, for we never could hear what became of her afterwards. We\r\nwere now in the latitude 19 deg. 32 min. having as yet a tolerable good\r\nvoyage. But, passing by several little incidents relating to wind and\r\nweather, I shall relate what is most remarkable concerning my little\r\nkingdom, to which I was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in\r\nfinding it, for as I came to, and went from it before, on the south and\r\neast side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so now approaching\r\nbetween the main and the island, not having any chart for the coast, nor\r\nland mark, it obliged us to go on shore on several islands in the mouth\r\nof the river Oroonoko, but to the purpose. Thus I perceived, that what\r\nI thought was a continent before, was no such thing, but a long island,\r\nor rather a ridge of sands. On one of these islands I found some\r\nSpaniards, but they belonged to the isle of Trinidad, who came hither\r\nin a sloop to make salt, and try to find some pearl muscles. But at\r\nlength I came fair on the south side of my island, and there I\r\npresently knew the countenance of my little kingdom; so we brought the\r\nship safe to an anchor, broadside within the creek, where stood my\r\nancient and venerable castle.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did I see the place, but calling for Friday, I asked him where\r\nhe was? But when he looked a little, he clapped his hands, crying, _O\r\njoy, O there, O yes, O there!_ pointing to our old abode, and then fell\r\na dancing and capering as if he was mad, and I had much ado to keep him\r\nfrom jumping into the sea, to swim ashore. 'Friday,' said I, 'what do you\r\nthink, shall we go to see your father?' at the mentioning his father's\r\nname, the poor affectionate creature fell a-weeping: _No, no,_ says he,\r\n_me see him no more, never see poor father more! he long ago die, die\r\nlong ago: he much old man._ 'You don't know that,' said I, 'but shall we\r\nsee anybody else?' He looks about, and pointing to the hill above my\r\nhouse, cries out, _We see, we see there much men and there_: which,\r\nthough I could not perceive them with my perspective glass, was true,\r\nby what the men themselves told me the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen the English ancient was spread, and three guns fired, as a signal\r\nof friendship, we perceived a smoke rise from the creek; upon which I\r\nordered the boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out a white\r\nflag of truce, I went on shore, accompanied also by the young friar, to\r\nwhom I had related the history of the first part of my life; besides we\r\nhad sixteen men well armed, in case we had met with any opposition.\r\n\r\nAfter we had rowed directly into the creek, the first man I fixed my eye\r\nupon was the Spaniard, whose life I had saved, and whose face I\r\nperfectly well knew. I ordered them all to stay in the boat for a while:\r\nbut Friday, perceiving his father at a distance, would have jumped into\r\nthe sea, had they not let the boat go. No sooner was he on shore, but he\r\nflew like a swift arrow out of a bow to embrace his aged father.\r\nCertainly it would melt a man of the firmest resolution into the softest\r\ntears to see with what uncommon transports of joy he saluted him; he\r\nfirst kissed him, then stroked his face, took him in his arms, laid him\r\nunder a shady tree, sat down by him, then looked as earnestly at him as\r\none could do at a picture, for a quarter of an hour together. After this\r\nhe would lie upon the ground, stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up\r\nand stare at him, as though he was bewitched; but the next day one could\r\nnot forbear laughter to see his behaviour, for he would walk several\r\nhours with his father along the shore, leading him by the hand as tho'\r\nhe was a lady; while, every now and then, he would run to the boat to\r\nget something for him, as a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit, or something\r\nor other that was good. His frolics ran in another channel in the\r\nafternoon; when he set old Friday on the ground, he would dance round\r\nhim, making comical postures and gestures; and all this while would be\r\ntelling him one story or another of his travels and adventures.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 10th of April, _anno_ 1695, that I set my foot upon the\r\nisland a second time. When my faithful Spaniard, accompanied by one\r\nmore, approached the boat, he little knew who I was, till I discovered\r\nmyself to him. _Seignor_, said I, in Portuguese, _don't you know me_? He\r\nspoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attendant, extended his\r\narms, and saying something in Spanish that I did not then understand, he\r\ncame forward & embraced me, saying, _he was inexcusable not to know his\r\ndeliverer: who, like an angel sent from heaven, had saved his life_; He\r\nthen beckoned to the man to call out his companions, asking me if I\r\nwould walk to my own habitation and take possession, where I should find\r\nsome mean improvements; but indeed they were extraordinary ones: for\r\nthey had planted so many trees so close together, that the place was\r\nlike a labyrinth, which none could find out except themselves, who knew\r\nits intricate windings. I asked him the meaning of all these\r\nfortifications? he told me _he would give a large account of what had\r\npassed since my departure till this time, and how he had subdued some\r\nEnglish, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I would not be\r\ndispleased, since necessity compelled them to it_. As I knew they were\r\nwicked villains, so I told him, that I was not only far from finding\r\nfault with it, but was rather heartily glad that they had subdued them.\r\nWhile we were thus talking, the man whom he sent returned, accompanied\r\nby eleven more, but in such habits, that it was impossible to tell what\r\nnations they were of. He first turned to me, and pointing to them,\r\n_These Sir,_ said he, _are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to\r\nyour goodness_, then turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them\r\nsensible who I was; and, then indeed they saluted me one by one, not as\r\nordinary men, but as tho' they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a\r\ntriumphant conqueror; for their behaviour not only agreed with a\r\nmanlike, majestic gravity, but at the same time was so obliging and\r\ncourteous, as made them agreeable to the last degree.\r\n\r\nBefore I relate the history of the transactions of my kingdom, as I had\r\nit from the Spaniard's own mouth, I must here insert what I omitted in\r\nmy former relation. The matter is this: Just before we weighed anchor\r\nand set sail, there happened a quarrel on board the ship, which had like\r\nto have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time the courageous\r\nCapitan, taking two of the most refractory prisoners, laid them in irons\r\nthreatening, as they were concerned in the former disorders, so have\r\nthem hanged in England for running away with the ship. This frightened\r\nsome of the rest, as thinking the Captain would serve them in the same\r\nmanner, though he seemed to give them good word for the present. But the\r\nmate having intelligence of this, mad me acquainted with their fears; so\r\nthat to make them more easy, and ourselves more safe from their\r\nconspiracies I was obliged to go down, and pass my honour's word for it,\r\nthat upon their good behaviour, all that was past should be forgiven; in\r\ntestimony of which, I ordered the two men's irons to be taken off; &\r\nthemselves forgiven. But as this had brought us to an anchor that night,\r\nin which there was a calm; the two men that had been in irons stole each\r\nof them a musket, and some other weapons, and taking the ship's pinnace,\r\nnot yet hauled up, ran away to their brother rogues. The next morning we\r\nsent the long-boat with men to pursue them, but all in vain; the mate,\r\nin revenge, would have demolished my little castle, burnt his furniture\r\nand destroyed their plantations, but having no orders for it, he did not\r\nput it in execution. And thus there were five Englishmen in the island,\r\nwhich caused great differences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a\r\nperfect account of, in the following manner:\r\n\r\nYou cannot, Sir, but remember the embassy you sent me about, and what a\r\ndisappointment we met with, by your absence, at our return. There is but\r\nlittle variety in the relation of all our voyage, being blessed with\r\ncalm weather and a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy of my countrymen\r\nto see me alive, having acted as the principal man on board, the captain\r\nof the shipwrecked vessel dying before; nor was their surprise less, as\r\nknowing I was taken prisoner by the savages of another nation, they had\r\nthought me long since entombed in their monstrous bowels. But when I\r\nshowed them the arms, ammunition, and provisions I had brought for them,\r\nthey looked upon me as a second Joseph advanced in Pharoah's court, and\r\nimmediately prepared to come along with me. Indeed they were obliged to\r\ntrespass upon their friendly savages, by borrowing two of their canoes,\r\nunder a pretext for fishing; and they came away the next morning, but\r\nwithout any provisions of their own, except a few roots which served\r\nthem instead of bread. After three weeks absence we arrived at our\r\nhabitation. Here we met with three English sailors, who, I confess, gave\r\nus provisions, and that letter of direction you had left for us, which\r\ninformed us how to bring up tame goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make\r\npots, and, in short, every thing that was necessary for our life. As, in\r\nparticular, I knew your method best, so taking Friday's father to assist\r\nme, we managed all the affairs; nor were the rest of the Spaniards\r\nwanting in their kind offices, dressing food for the Englishmen, who did\r\nnothing but ramble and divert themselves in the woods, either shooting\r\nparrots, or catching tortoises. But we had not been long ashore, before\r\nwe were informed of two more Englishmen, unnaturally turned out of their\r\ncommon place of residence, by the three others above mentioned; this\r\nmade my Spaniards and me (whom they now looked upon as their governor in\r\nyour absence) endeavour to persuade them to take them in, that we might\r\nbe as one family; but all our intreaties were in vain, so that the poor\r\nfellows finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their tents\r\non the north side of the island, a little inclining to the west, for\r\nfear of savages. Here they built two huts, one to lodge, and the other\r\nto lay their stores in; for my good natured Spaniards giving them some\r\nseeds, they dug and planted as I had done, and began to live prettily.\r\nBut while they were thus comfortably going on, the three unnatural\r\nbrutes, their countrymen, in a mere bullying humour, insulted them by\r\nsaying, 'the governor (meaning you) had given them a possession of the\r\nisland, and d-mn 'em they should build no houses upon their ground,\r\nwithout paying rent.' The two honest men (for so let me now distinguish\r\nthem) thought their three countrymen only jested, and one of them\r\ninvited them in, to see their fine habitations; while the other\r\nfacetiously told them 'that since they built tenements with great\r\nimprovements, they should, according to the custom of lords, give them\r\na longer lease;' at the same time desiring them to fetch a scriviner to\r\ndraw the writings. One of these wretches swearing _he should pay for the\r\njest_, snatches up a fire brand, and clapping it to the outside of their\r\nhut, very fairly set it on fire, which would soon have consumed it, had\r\nnot the honest man thrust him away, and trod it with his feet. Hereupon\r\nthe fellow returns with his pole, with which he would have ended his\r\ndays, had not the poor man avoided the blow when fetching his musket, he\r\nknocked down the villain that began the quarrel. The other two coming to\r\nassist their fellow, obliged the honest man to take his musket also, and\r\nboth of them presenting their pieces bid the villains stand off; and if\r\nthey did not lay down their arms, death should decide the dispute one\r\nway or other. This brought them to a parley, in which they agreed to\r\ntake their wounded man and begone; but they were in the wrong that they\r\ndid not disarm them when they had the power, and then make their\r\ncomplaint to me and my Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented\r\ntheir farther designs against them. And indeed so many trespass did they\r\nafterwards commit, by treading down their corn, shooting their young\r\nkids and goats, and plaguing them night and day, that they resolved to\r\ncome to my castle, challenge all the three, and decide their right by\r\none plain battle, while the Spaniards stood by to see fair play. One day\r\nit happened, that two of my Spaniards (one of whom understood English)\r\nbeing in the woods, were met by one of the honest men, who complained\r\nhow barbarous their countrymen had been in destroying their corn,\r\nkilling their milk-goat and three kids, which deprived them of their\r\nsubsistence; and that if we did not grant them relief, they must be\r\ninevitably starved, and so they parted; but when my Spaniards came home\r\nat night, and supper being on the table, one of them began to reprehend\r\nthe Englishmen, but in a very mannerly way; which they resenting,\r\nreplied, _What business had their countrymen in that place without\r\nleave, when it was none of their ground? Why_, said my Spaniard, calmly,\r\n_Inglise, they must not starve:_ but they replied, _Let them starve and\r\nbe damn'd, they should neither plant nor build, and damn them, they\r\nshould be their servants, and work for them, for the island was their's,\r\nand they would burn all the huts they should find in the island. By this\r\nrule_, said my Spaniard, smiling, _We shall be your servants too. Aye,\r\nby God, and so you shall_ replied the impudent rascal. Upon which,\r\nstarting up, Will Atkins cries, _Come Jack, let's have t'other brush\r\nwith them; who dare to build in our dominions?_--Thus leaving us\r\nsomething heated with just passion, away they trooped, every man having\r\na gun, pistol, and sword, muttering some threatening words, that we\r\ncould then but imperfectly understand. That night they designed to\r\nmurder their two companions, and slept till midnight in the bower,\r\nthinking to fall upon them in their sleep: not were the honest men less\r\nthoughtful concerning them; for at this juncture they were coming to\r\nfind them out, but in a much fairer way. As soon as the villains came to\r\nthe huts, and found nobody there, they concluded that I and my Spaniard\r\nhad given them notice, and therefore swore to be revenged on us. Then\r\nthey demolished the poor men's habitations; not by fire, as they\r\nattempted before, but pulled down their houses, limb from limb, not\r\nleaving stick nor stone on the ground where they stood, broke their\r\nhousehold stuff in pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled their\r\ninclosures, and, in short, quite ruined them of every thing they had.\r\nHad these people met together, no doubt but there would have been a\r\nbloody battle; but Providence ordered it for the better; for just as the\r\nthree were got together the two were at our castle; and when they left\r\nus, the three came back again, but in great rage, scoffingly telling us\r\nwhat they had done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's hat, twirls it\r\nround, saying, _And you Seignor Jack Spaniard, shall have the same\r\nsauce, if you don't mind your manners_. My Spaniard, a grave but\r\ncourageous man, knocked him down with one blow of his fist; at which\r\nanother villain fired his pistol, and narrowly missed his body, but\r\nwounded him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard takes up\r\nthe fellow's musket who he had knocked down, and would have shot him, if\r\nI and the rest had not come out, and taken their arms from every one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\"These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us their enemies,\r\nbegan to cool; but not withstanding their better words the Spaniards\r\nwould not return them their arms again, telling them, 'they would do\r\nthem no manner of harm, if they would live peaceably; but if they\r\noffered any injury to the plantation or castle, they would shoot them as\r\nthey would do ravenous beasts. This made them so mad, that they went\r\naway raging like furies of hell. They were no sooner gone, but in came\r\nthe two honest men, fired with the justest rage, if such can be, having\r\nbeen ruined as aforesaid. And indeed it was very hard, that nineteen of\r\nus should be bullied by three villains, continually offending\r\nwith impunity.\r\n\r\n\"It was a great while, Sir, before we could persuade the two Englishmen\r\nfrom pursuing, and undoubtedly killing them with their fire-arms; but we\r\npromised them 'justice should be done them, and, in the mean time, they\r\nshould reside with us in our habitation.' In about five days after,\r\nthese three vagrants, almost starved with hunger, drew near our grove,\r\nand perceiving me, the governor, & two others walking by the side of the\r\ncreek, they very submissively desired to be received into the family\r\nagain. We told them of 'their great incivility to us, and of their\r\nunnatural barbarity to their countrymen; but yet we would see what the\r\nrest agreed to, and in half an hour's time would bring them word.'\r\nAfter some debate, we called them in, where their two countrymen laid a\r\nheavy charge against them, for not only ruining, but designing to murder\r\nthem, which they could not deny. But here I was forced to interpose as a\r\nmediator, by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt them, being naked &\r\nunarmed, and that the other three should make them restitution, by\r\nbuilding their two huts, and fencing their ground in the same manner as\r\nit was before. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submitted to\r\nthis at present, and lived some time regularly enough, except as to the\r\nworking part, which they did not care for, but the Spaniards would have\r\ndispensed with that, had they continued easy and quiet. Their arms being\r\ngiven them again, they scarce had them a week when they became as\r\ntroublesome as ever; but an accident happening soon after, obliged us to\r\nlay aside private resentments, and look to our common preservation.\r\n\r\n\"One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in health, and yet by no\r\nmeans could I compose myself to sleep; upon which, being very uneasy, I\r\ngot up and looked out, but it being dark, I could perceive nothing but\r\nthe trees around the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all one, I\r\ncould not sleep; when one of my Spaniards, hearing me walk about, asked\r\nwho it was up? I answered, _It is I_. When I told him the occasion,\r\n_Sir_, said he, _such things are not to be slighted; for certainly there\r\nis some mischief plotting against us. Where are the Englishmen?_ said I.\r\nHe answered _In their huts_; for they lay separate from us, Sir, since\r\nthe last mutiny. _Well,_ said I, _some kind spirit gives this\r\ninformation for advantage. Come let us go abroad, and see if any thing\r\noffers to justify our fears._ Upon which I and some of my Spaniards went\r\nup the mountain, not by the ladder, but through the grove, and then we\r\nwere struck with a panic fear on seeing a light, as though it were a\r\nfire, at a very little distance, and hearing the voices of several men.\r\nHereupon we retreated immediately, and raised the rest of our forces,\r\nand made them sensible of the impending danger; but with all my\r\nauthority, I could not make them stay where they were, so earnest were\r\nthey to see how things went. Indeed the darkness of the night gave them\r\nopportunity enough to view them by the light of the fire undiscovered.\r\nAs they were in different parties, and straggling over the shore, we\r\nwere much afraid that they should find out our habitations, and destroy\r\nour flocks of goats: to prevent which, we sent immediately an Englishman\r\nand two Spaniards to drive the goats into the valley where the cave lay;\r\nor, if there was occasion, into the cave itself: As to ourselves,\r\nresuming our native courage and prudent conduct, had we not been\r\ndivided, we durst venture to attack an hundred of them; but before it\r\nwas very light, we resolved to send out Friday's father as a spy, who,\r\nimmediately stripping himself naked, gets among them undiscovered, and\r\nin two hours time brings word, that 'they were two parties of two\r\ndifferent nations, who lately having a bloody battle with one another,\r\nhappened to land by mere chance on the same island, to devour their\r\nmiserable prisoners; that they were entirely ignorant of any person's\r\ninhabiting here; but rather filled with rage and fury against one\r\nanother, he believed, that as soon as day light appeared, there would be\r\na terrible engagement.' Old Friday had scarce ended his relation, when\r\nwe heard an uncommon noise, and perceived that there was a horrid\r\nengagement between the two armies.\r\n\r\n\"Such was the curiosity of our party, especially the Englishmen, that\r\nthey would not lie close, tho' Old Friday told them, 'their safety\r\ndepended upon it; and that if we had patience, we should behold the\r\nsavages kill one another.' However they used some caution, by going\r\nfarther into the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient place to\r\nbehold the battle.\r\n\r\n\"Never could there be a more bloody engagement, or men of more\r\ninvincible spirits and prudent conduct, according to their manner and\r\nway of fighting. It lasted near two hours, till the party which was\r\nnearest our castle began to decline, and at last to fly from their\r\nconquerors. We were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on this\r\naccount, lest they should run into our grove, and consequently bring us\r\ninto the like danger. Hereupon we resolved to kill the first that came,\r\nto prevent discovery, and that too with our swords, and the butt end of\r\nour muskets, for fear the report of our guns should be heard.\r\n\r\n\"And so indeed, as we thought, it happened; for three of the vanquished\r\narmy crossing the creek, ran directly to the place, as to a thick wood\r\nfor shelter; nor was it long before our scout gave us notice of it: as\r\nalso, that the victors did not think fit to pursue them. Upon this I\r\nwould not suffer them to be slain, but had them surprised and taken by\r\nour party; afterwards they proved very good servants to us, being stout\r\nyoung creatures, and able to do a great deal of work. The remainder of\r\nthe conquered savages fled to their canoes, and put out into the ocean,\r\nwhile the conquerors, joining together, shouted by way of triumph, and\r\nabout three in the afternoon they also embarked for their own nation.\r\nThus we were freed at once from these savages and our fears, not\r\nperceiving any of these creatures for some considerable time after. We\r\nfound two and thirty men dead in the field of battle; some were slain\r\nwith long arrows, which we found sticking in their bodies; & the rest\r\nwere killed with great unwieldy wooden swords, which denoted their vast\r\nstrength, and of which we found seventeen, besides bows and arrows: but\r\nwe could not find one wounded creature among them alive; for they either\r\nkill their enemies quite, or carry those wounded away with them.\r\n\r\n\"This terrible fight tamed the Englishmen for some time, considering\r\nhow unfortunate they might have been had they fallen into their hands,\r\nwho would not only kill them as enemies, but also for food, as we do\r\ncattle; and indeed so much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it not\r\nonly made them very sick, but more tractable to the common necessary\r\nbusiness of the whole society, planting, sowing, and reaping, with the\r\ngreatest signs of amity and friendship; so, that being now all good\r\nfriends, we began to consider of circumstances in general; and the first\r\nthing we thought of was, whether, as we perceived the savages haunted\r\nthat side of the island, and there being more retired parts of it, and\r\nyet as well suited to our manner of living, and equally to our\r\nadvantage, we ought not rather to move our place of residence, & plant\r\nit in a much safer place, both for the security of our corn and cattle.\r\n\r\n\"After a long debate on this head; it was resolved, or rather voted,\r\n_nemine comradicente_, not to remove our ancient castle, and that for\r\nthis very good reason, that some time or other we expected to hear from\r\nour supreme governor, (meaning you, Sir) whose messengers not finding us\r\nthere, might think the place demolished, and all his subjects destroyed\r\nby the savages.\r\n\r\n\"As to the next concern relating to our corn and cattle, we consented to\r\nhave them removed to the valley where the cave was, that being most\r\nproper and sufficient for both. But yet when we considered farther, we\r\naltered one part of our resolution, which was to remove part of our\r\ncattle thither and plant only part of our corn there; so that in case\r\none part was destroyed, the other might be preserved. Another resolution\r\nwe took, which really had a great deal of prudence in it; and that was,\r\nin not trusting the three savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any\r\nknowledge of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what number\r\nof cattle we had there, much less of the cave, wherein we kept several\r\narms, and two barrels of powder you left for us at your departure from\r\nthis island. But though we could not change our habitation, we resolved\r\nto make it more fortified and more secret. To this end, Sir, as you\r\nplanted trees at some distance before the entrance of your palace; so\r\nwe, imitating your example, planted and filled up the whole space of\r\nground, even to the banks of the creek, nay, into the very ooze where\r\nthe tide flowed, not leaving a place for landing; and among those I had\r\nplanted, they had intermingled so many short ones, all of which growing\r\nwonderfully fast and thick, a little dog could scarcely find a passage\r\nthrough them. Nor was this sufficient, as we thought, for we did the\r\nsame to all the ground, on the right and left hand of us, even to the\r\ntop of the hill, without so much as leaving a passage for ourselves,\r\nexcept by the ladder; which being taken down, nothing but what had\r\nwings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us. And indeed this was\r\nexceedingly well-contrived, especially to serve that occasion for which\r\nwe afterwards found it necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, having, all this time,\r\nnot one visit from the savages. Indeed one morning we had an alarm,\r\nwhich put us in some amazement; for a few of my Spaniards being out very\r\nearly, perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were coming on shore:\r\nupon which returning home, with great precipitation, they gave us the\r\nalarm, which obliged us to keep at home all that day and the next, going\r\nout only in the night-time to make our observations; but, as good luck\r\nwould have it, they were upon another design, and did not land that time\r\nupon the island.\r\n\r\n\"But now there happened another quarrel between the three wicked\r\nEnglishmen, and some of my Spaniards.--- The occasion was this: One of\r\nthem being enraged at one of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner,\r\nfor not being able to comprehend something which he was showing him,\r\nsnatched up a hatchet in a great fury not to correct, but to kill him;\r\nyet missing his head gave him such a barbarous--cut in the shoulder,\r\nthat he had like to have struck off his arm; at which one of my\r\ngood-natured Spaniards interposing between the Englishman and the savage\r\nbeseeched the former, not to murder the poor creature, but this kindness\r\nhad like to have cost the Spaniard his life, for the Englishman, struck\r\nat him in the same manner; which he nimbly and wisely avoiding, returned\r\nsuddenly upon him with his shovel, (being all at work about their corn\r\nland), and very fairly knocked the brutish creature down. Hereupon\r\nanother Englishman coming to his fellow's assistance, laid the good\r\nSpaniard on the earth; when immediately two others coming to his relief\r\nwere attacked by the third Englishman, armed with an old cutlass, who\r\nwounded them both. This uproar soon reached our ears, when we rushing\r\nout upon them, took the three Englishmen prisoners, and then our next\r\nquestion was, what would be done to such mutinous, and impudent fellows,\r\nso furious, desperate, and idle, that they were mischievious to the\r\nhighest degree and consequently not safe for the society to let them\r\nlive among them.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Sir, as I was governor in your absence, so I also took the\r\nauthority of a judge, and, having them brought before me; I told them,\r\nthat if they had been of my country, I would have hanged every mother's\r\nson of them, but since it was an Englishman (meaning you, kind Sir,) to\r\nwhom we were indebted for our preservation and deliverance, I would, in\r\ngratitude, use them with all possible mildness, but at the same time\r\nleave them to the judgment of the other two Englishmen who, I hoped,\r\nforgetting their resentments, would deal impartially by them.'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up: _Sir_, said he, _leave it not\r\nfor us, for you may be sensible we have reason to sentence them to the\r\ngallows: besides, Sir, this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two others,\r\nproposed to us, that we might murder you all in your sleep, which we\r\ncould not consent to: but knowing their inability, and your vigilance,\r\nwe did not think fit to discover it before now._\r\n\r\n\"_How, Signor_, said I, _do you hear what is alledged against you? What\r\ncan you say to justify so horrid an action, as to murder us in cold\r\nblood?_ So far, Sir, was the wretch from denying it, that he swore,\r\n_damn him but he would do it still. But what have we done to you, Seignor\r\nAtkins_, said I, _or what will you gain by killing us? What shall we do\r\nto prevent you? Must we kill you, or you kill us? Why will you Seignor\r\nAtkins,_ said I, smiling, _put us to such an unhappy dilemma, such a\r\nfatal necessity?_ But so great a rage did my scoffing and yet severe\r\njest put him into, that he was going to fly at me and undoubtedly had\r\nattempted to kill me if he had been possessed of weapons, and had not\r\nbeen prevented by three Spaniards. This unparalleled and villainous\r\ncarriage, made us seriously consider what was to be done. The two\r\nEnglishmen and the Spaniard, who had saved the poor Indian's life,\r\nmightily petitioned me to hang one of them, for an example to the\r\nothers, which should be him that had twice attempted to commit murder\r\nwith his hatchet, it being at that time thought impossible the poor\r\nslave should recover. But they could never gain my consent to put him to\r\ndeath, for the reasons above mentioned, since it was an Englishman (even\r\nyourself) who was my deliverer; and as merciful counsels are most\r\nprevailing when earnestly pressed, so I got them to be of the same\r\nopinion as to clemency. But to prevent them doing us any farther\r\nmischief; we all agreed, that they should have no weapons, as sword,\r\ngun, powder, or shot, but be expelled from the society, to live as they\r\npleased by themselves; that neither the two Englishmen, nor the rest of\r\nthe Spaniards, should have conversation with them upon any account\r\nwhatsoever; that they should be kept from coming within a certain\r\ndistance of our castle; and if they dared to offer us any violence,\r\neither by spoiling, burning, killing, or destroying any of the corn,\r\nplantings, buildings, fences, or cattle, belonging to the society, we\r\nwould shoot them as freely as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever\r\nplaces we should find them.\r\n\r\n\"This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves; when, like a\r\nmerciful judge, I called out to the two honest Englishmen, saying, _You\r\nmust consider they ought not to be starved neither: and since it will be\r\nsome time before they can raise corn and cattle of their own, let us\r\ngive them some corn to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by\r\nwhich time they'll raise some for themselves; let us also bestow upon\r\nthem six milch goats, four he ones, and six kids, as well for their\r\npresent support, as for a further increase; with tools necessary for\r\ntheir work, as hatchets, an ax, saw, and other things convenient to\r\nbuild them huts:_ all which were agreed: but before they took them into\r\npossession, I obliged them solemnly to swear, never to attempt any thing\r\nagainst us, or their countrymen for the future. Thus dismissing them\r\nfrom our society, They went away, sullen & refractory, as though neither\r\nwilling to go nor stay; however seeing no remedy, they took what\r\nprovision was given them, proposing to choose a convenient place where\r\nthey might live by themselves.\r\n\r\n\"About five days after, they came to those limits appointed, in order\r\nfor more victuals, and sent me word by one of my Spaniards, whom they\r\ncalled to, where they had pitched their tents; and marked themselves out\r\nan habitation and plantation, at the N.E. and most remote part of the\r\nisland. And, indeed, there they built themselves two very handsome\r\ncottages, resembling our little castle, being under the side of a\r\nmountain, with some trees already growing on three sides of it; so that\r\nplanting a few more, it would be obscured from sight, unless\r\nparticularly sought for. When these huts were finished, we gave them\r\nsome dry goat-skins for bedding and covering; & upon their giving us\r\nfuller assurances of their good behaviour for the future, we gave them\r\nsome pease, barley, and rice for sowing and whatever tools we\r\ncould spare.\r\n\r\n\"Six months did they live in this separate condition, in which they got\r\ntheir first harvest in, the quantity of which was but small, because\r\nthey had planted but little land; for, indeed, all their plantations\r\nbeing to form, made it more difficult; especially as it was a thing out\r\nof their element; and when they were obliged to make their boards and\r\npots, &c. they could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy season\r\ncoming on, put them into a greater perplexity for want of a cave to keep\r\ntheir corn dry, and prevent it from spoiling: and so much did this\r\nhumble them, that they begged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the\r\ngood-natured men readily consented, and in four days space, worked a\r\ngreat hole in the side of the hill for them, large enough for their\r\npurpose, to secure their corn and other things from the rain, though not\r\ncomparable to ours, which had several additional appartments.\r\n\r\n\"But a new whim possessed these rogues about three quarters of a year\r\nafter, which had like to have ruined us, and themselves too: for it\r\nseems, being tired and weary of this sort of living, which made them\r\nwork for themselves, without hopes of changing their condition, nothing\r\nwould serve them, but that they would make a voyage to the continent,\r\nand try if they could seize upon some of the savages, and bring them\r\nover as slaves, to do their drudgery, while they lived at ease\r\nand pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed the project was not so preposterous, if they had not gone\r\nfarther; but they neither did, nor proposed any thing, but what had\r\nmischief in the design, or the event. One morning, these three fellows\r\ncame down to the limited station, and humbly desired to be admitted to\r\ntalk with us, which we readily granted; they told us in short, that\r\n_being tired of their manner of living, and the labour of their hands in\r\nsuch employments, not being sufficient to procure the necessaries of\r\nlife, they only desired one of the canoes we came over in, with some\r\narms and ammunition for their defence, and they would seek their\r\nfortunes abroad, and never trouble us any more._ To be sure we were glad\r\nenough to get rid of such wretched plagues; but yet honesty made us\r\ningenuously represent to them, by what we ourselves had suffered, the\r\ncertain destruction they were running into, either of being starved to\r\ndeath or murdered by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied,\r\n_that they neither could nor would work: and consequently that they\r\nmight as well be starved abroad as at home: & neither had they any wives\r\nor children to cry after them: nay, so intent were they upon their\r\nvoyage, that if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they had but\r\nthe canoe they would have gone without them._\r\n\r\n\"Though we could not well spare our fire arms, rather than they should\r\ngo like naked men, we let them have two muskets, a pistol, a cutlass,\r\nand three hatchets, which were thought very sufficient: we gave them\r\nalso goat's flesh, a great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh\r\nbutter, a young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to carry twenty\r\nmen. And thus, with a mast made of a long pole, and a sail of six large\r\ngoat-skins dried, having a fair breeze, and a flood-tide with them, they\r\nmerrily sailed away, the Spaniards calling after them, _Bon voyaje_, no\r\nman ever expecting to see them more.\r\n\r\n\"When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen would often say to\r\none another, _O how peaceably do we now live, since these turbulent\r\nfellows have left us!_ Nothing could be farther from their thoughts than\r\nto behold their faces any more; and yet scarce two and twenty days had\r\npassed over their heads, but one of the Englishmen, being abroad a\r\nplanting, perceived at a distance, three men well armed, approaching\r\ntowards him. Away he flies with speed to our castle, and tells me and\r\nthe rest, that we were all undone, for that strangers were landed upon\r\nthe island, and who they were he could not tell; but added that they\r\nwere not savages but men habited, bearing arms. _Why then,_ said I, _we\r\nhave the less occasion to be concerned, since, if they were not Indians,\r\nthey must be friends; for I am sure there is no Christian people upon\r\nearth, but what will do us good rather than harm._ But while we were\r\nconsidering of the event, up came the three Englishmen, whose voices we\r\nquickly knew, and so all our admiration of that nature ceased at once.\r\nAnd our wonder was succeeded by another sort of inquiry, which was, what\r\ncould be the occasion of their returning so quickly to the island, when\r\nwe little expected, and much less desired their company? But as this was\r\nbetter to be related by themselves, I ordered them to be brought in,\r\nwhen they gave me the following relation of their voyage.\r\n\r\n\"After two days sail, or something less, they reached land, where they\r\nfound the people coming to give them another sort of reception than what\r\nthey expected or desired; for, as the savages were armed with bows and\r\narrows, they durst not venture on shore, but steered northward, six or\r\nseven hours, till they gained an opening, by which they plainly\r\nperceived, that the land that appeared from this place, was not the main\r\nland, but an island. At their entrance into the opening of the sea, they\r\ndiscovered another island, on the right hand northward, and several more\r\nlying to the westward; but being resolved to go on shore some where or\r\nother, they put over to one of the western islands. Here they found the\r\nnatives very courteous to them, giving them several roots and dried\r\nfish; nay, even their women too were as willing to supply them with what\r\nthey could procure them to eat, bringing it a great way to them upon\r\ntheir heads. Among these hospitable Indians they continued some days,\r\ninquiring by signs and tokens, what nations lay around them; and were\r\ninformed, that there were, several fierce and terrible people lived\r\nevery way, accustomed to eat mankind; but for themselves they never used\r\nsuch diet, except those that were taken in battle, and of them they made\r\na solemn feast.\r\n\r\n\"The Englishmen inquired how long it was since they had a feast of that\r\nkind? They answered, _about two moons ago_, pointing to the moon, and\r\nthen two fingers; that, _at this time, their king had two hundred\r\nprisoners, which were fattening up for the slaughter_. The Englishmen\r\nwere mighty desirous of seeing the prisoners, which the others\r\nmistaking, thought that they wanted some of them for their own food:\r\nupon which they beckoned to them, pointing to the rising, and then to\r\nthe setting of the sun; meaning, that by the time it appeared in the\r\neast next morning, they would bring them some: and indeed they were as\r\ngood as their word; for by that time they brought eleven men & five\r\nwomen, just as so many cows & oxen are brought to sea-port towns to\r\nvictual a ship. But as brutish as these Englishmen were, their stomachs\r\nturned at the sight. What to do in this case, they could not tell: to\r\nrefuse the prisoner, would have been the highest affront offered to the\r\nsavage gentry; and to dispose of them, they knew not, in what manner;\r\nhowever, they resolved to accept them, and so gave them, in return, one\r\nof their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their\r\nbullets; things which, tho' they were wholly ignorant of, yet of seemed\r\nentirely contented with; & dragging the poor wretches into the boat,\r\nwith their hands bound behind them, delivered them to the Englishmen.\r\nBut this obliged them to put off as soon as they had these presents,\r\nlest the donors should have expected two or three of them to be killed,\r\nand to be invited to dinner the next day; and so taking leave with all\r\npossible respect and thanks, though neither of them understood what the\r\nothers said, they sailed away back to the first island, and there set\r\neight of the prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to\r\ncomfort, and have some conversation with the poor captives; but it was\r\nimpossible to make them sensible of any thing; and nothing they could\r\nsay or give, or do for them, could make them otherwise persuaded, but\r\nthat they were unbound only to be devoured: if they gave them any food,\r\nthey thought it was only to fatten them for the slaughter; or looked at\r\nany one more particularly, the poor creature supposed itself to be the\r\n'first sacrifice'; and even when we brought them to our island, and\r\nbegan to use them with the greatest humanity and kindness, yet they\r\nexpected every day that their new masters would devour them.\r\n\r\n\"And thus, Sir, did these three strange wanderers conclude their\r\nunaccountable relation of their voyage, which was both amazing and\r\nentertaining. Hereupon, I asked them, where there new family was? They\r\ntold me _they had put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg\r\nsome victuals for them_. This, indeed, made us all long to see them; and\r\ntaking Friday's father with us, leaving only two at our castle, we came\r\ndown to behold these poor creatures.\r\n\r\n\"When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound again by the Englishmen,\r\nfor fear of escaping) we found them stark naked, expecting their fatal\r\ntragedy: there were three lusty men, well shaped, with straight and good\r\nlimbs, between thirty and five and thirty years old; and five women, two\r\nof them might be from thirty to forty, two more not above four and\r\ntwenty; and the last, a comely tall maiden of about seventeen. Indeed,\r\nall the women were very agreeable, both in proportion and features,\r\nexcept that they were tawny, which their modest behaviour, and other\r\ngraces, made amends for, when they afterwards came to be clothed.\r\n\r\n\"This naked appearance, together with their miserable circumstances, was\r\nno very comfortable sight to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may\r\nventure, Sir, without flattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour,\r\ncalmest tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be; for they\r\nimmediately ordered Friday's father to see if he knew any of them, or if\r\nhe understood what they could say. No sooner did the old Indian appear,\r\nbut he looked at them with great seriousness; yet, as they were not of\r\nhis nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could understand\r\nhis speech or signs, but one woman. This was enough to answer the\r\ndesign, which was to assure them they would not be killed, being fallen\r\ninto the hands of Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they\r\nwere fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such strange\r\ngestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible for me to describe.\r\nBut the woman their interpreter, was ordered next to enquire, whether\r\nthey were content to be servants, and would work for the men who had\r\nbrought them hither to save their lives? Hereupon, (being at this time\r\nunbound) they fell a capering and dancing, one taking this thing upon\r\nher shoulders, and the other that, intimating, that they were willing to\r\ndo any thing for them. But now, Sir, having women among us, and dreading\r\nthat it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked the three men\r\n'what they would do, and how they intended to use these creatures,\r\nwhether as servants or women?' One of them very pertly and readily\r\nanswered, 'they would use them as both,' _Gentlemen_, said I _as you are\r\nyour own masters, I am not going to restrain you from that; but\r\nmethinks, for avoiding dissentions among you, I would only desire you to\r\nengage, that none of you will take more than one for a woman or wife,\r\nand that having taken this one, none else should presume to touch her;\r\nfor though we have not yet a priestly authority to marry you, yet it is\r\nbut reasonable, that whoever thus takes a woman, should be obliged to\r\nmaintain her, since nobody has any thing to do with her_; and this,\r\nindeed, appeared so just to all present, that it was unanimously agreed\r\nto. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, 'whether they designed to\r\ntake any of them? but they all answered, _No_; some declaring they had\r\nalready wives in Spain; and others that they cared not to join with\r\ninfidels. On the reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a temporary\r\nwife, and so set up a new method of living. As to Friday's father, the\r\nSpaniards, and the three savage servants we had taken in the late\r\nbattle, they all lived with me in our ancient castle; and indeed we\r\nsupplied the main part of the island with food, as necessity required.\r\nBut the most remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, who\r\nhad been so much at variance, should agree about the choice of those\r\nwomen; yet they took a way good enough to prevent quarreling among\r\nthemselves. They let the five women in one of their huts, and going\r\nthemselves to the other, drew lots which should have the first choice.\r\nNow, he that had the first lot went to the hut, and fetched out her he\r\nchose; and it is remarkable, that he took her that was the most homely\r\nand eldest of the number, which made the rest of the Englishmen\r\nexceedingly merry; the Spaniards themselves could not help but smile at\r\nit; but as it happened, the fellow had the best thought, in choosing\r\none fit for application and business; and indeed she proved the best\r\nwife of all the parcel.\r\n\r\n\"But when the poor creatures perceived themselves placed in a row, and\r\nseparated one by one, they were again seized with an unspeakable terror,\r\nas now thinking they were going to be slain in earnest; and when the\r\nEnglishmen came to take the first, the rest set up a lamentable cry,\r\nclasped their arms around her neck, and hanging about her, took their\r\nlast farewell, as they thought, in such trembling agonies, and\r\naffectionate embraces, as would have softened the hardest heart in the\r\nworld, and made the driest eyes melt into tears; nor could they be\r\npersuaded but that they were going to die, till such time as Friday's\r\nfather made them sensible that the Englishmen had chosen them for their\r\nwives, which ended all their terror and concern upon this occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Well, after this, the Englishmen went to work, and being assisted by my\r\ngood natured Spaniards, in a few hours they, erected every one of them a\r\nnew hut or tent for their separate lodging, since those they had already\r\nwere, filled with tools, household stuff, and provision. They all\r\ncontinued on the north shore of the island, but separate as before; the\r\nthree wicked ones pitching farther off, and the two honest men nearer\r\nour castle; so that the island seemed to be peopled in three places,\r\nthree towns beginning to be built for that purpose. And here I cannot\r\nbut remark, what is very common, that the two honest men had the worst\r\nwives, (I mean as to industry, cleanliness, and ingenuity) while the\r\nthree reprobates enjoyed women of quite contrary qualities.\r\n\r\n\"But another observation I made was, in favour of the two honest men, to\r\nshow what disparity there is between a diligent application to business,\r\non the one hand, and a slothful negligent, and idle temper, on the\r\nother. Both of them had the same parcel of ground laid out, and corn to\r\nsow, sufficient either in their cultivation or their planting. The two\r\nhonest men had a multitude of young trees planted about their\r\nhabitations, so that when you approached near them, nothing appeared but\r\na wood, very pleasing and delightful. Every thing they did prospered and\r\nflourished: their grapes, planted in order, seemed as though managed in\r\na vineyard and were infinitely preferable to any of the others. Nor were\r\nthey wanting to find out a place of retreat, but dug a cave in the most\r\nretired part of a thick wood, to secure their wives and children, with\r\ntheir provision and chiefest goods, surrounded with innumerable stakes,\r\nand having a most subtle entrance, in case any mischief should happen\r\neither from their fellow countrymen, or the devouring savages.\r\n\r\n\"As to the reprobates, (though I must own they were much more civilized\r\nthan before) instead of delightful wood surrounding their dwellings, we\r\nfound the words of King Solomon too truly verified: _I went by the\r\nvineyard of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns_. In many\r\nplaces their crop was obliterated by weeds: the hedges having several\r\ngaps in them, the wild goats had got in, and eaten up the corn, and here\r\nand there was a dead bush to stop these gaps for the present, which was\r\nno more than shutting the stable door after the steed was stolen away.\r\nBut as to their wives, they (as I observed before) were more diligent,\r\nand cleanly enough, especially in their victuals, being instructed by\r\none of the honest men, who had been a cook's mate on board a ship: &\r\nvery well it was so, for as he cooked himself, his companion and their\r\nfamilies lived as well as the idle husbands, who did nothing but loiter\r\nabout, fetch turtle's eggs, catch fish and birds, and do any thing but\r\nwork, and lived accordingly; while the diligent lived very handsomely\r\nand plentifully, in the most comfortable manner.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Sir, I come to lay before your eyes a scene quite different\r\nfrom any thing that ever happened to us before, and perhaps ever befel\r\nyou in all the time of your residence on this island. I shall inform you\r\nof its original in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\"One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or six canoes of Indians\r\non shore, indisputably upon their old custom of devouring their\r\nprisoners. All that we had to do upon such an occasion, was to lie\r\nconcealed, that they, not having any notice of inhabitants, might depart\r\nquietly after performing their bloody execution: whoever first\r\ndiscovered the savages, was to give notice to all the three plantations\r\nto keep within doors, and then a proper scout was to be placed to give\r\nintelligence of their departure. But notwithstanding these wise\r\nmeasures, an unhappy disaster discovered us to the savages, which was\r\nlike to have caused the desolation of the whole island; for, after the\r\nsavages were gone off in their canoes, some of my Spaniards and I\r\nlooking abroad; and being inflamed with a curiosity to see what they had\r\nbeen doing, to our great amazement beheld three savages fast asleep on\r\nthe ground, who, either being gorged, could not awake when the others\r\nwent off, or having wandered too far into the woods, did not come\r\nback in time.\r\n\r\n\"What to do with them as first, we could not tell; as for slaves we had\r\nenough of them already; and as to killing them, neither Christianity or\r\nhumanity would suffer us to shed the blood of persons who never did us\r\nwrong. We perceived they had no boat left them to transport them to\r\ntheir own nation; and that, by letting them wander about, they might\r\ndiscover us, and inform the first savages that should happen to land\r\nupon the same bloody occasion, which information might entirely ruin us;\r\nand therefore I counselled my Spaniards to secure them, and set them\r\nabout some work or other, till we could better dispose of them.\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake, took them prisoners.\r\nIt is impossible to express the horror they were in, especially when\r\nbound, as thinking they were going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon\r\neased them of their fear as to that point. We first took them to the\r\nbower, where the chief of our country work lay as keeping goats,\r\nplanting corn, &c and then carried them to the two Englishmen's\r\nhabitation, to help them in their business; but happy it was for us all\r\nwe did not carry them to our castle, as by the sequel will appear. The\r\nEnglishmen, indeed, found them work to do; but whether they did not\r\nguard them strictly, or that they thought they could not better\r\nthemselves, I cannot tell; but certainly one of them ran away into the\r\nwoods, and they could not hear of him for a long time after.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he got home in some of\r\nthe canoes, the savages returning in about four weeks time, and going\r\noff in the space of two days. You may be certain, Sir, this thought\r\ncould not but terrify us exceedingly, and make us justly conclude, that\r\nthe savage would inform his countrymen of our abode in the island, how\r\nfew and weak we were in comparison to their numbers & we expected it\r\nwould not be long before the Englishmen would be attacked in their\r\nhabitations; but the savages had not seen their places of safety in the\r\nwoods, nor our castle, which it was a great happiness they did not know.\r\n\r\n\"Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon this occasion: for, about\r\neight months after this, six canoes, with about ten men in each canoe,\r\ncame sailing by the north side of the island, which they were never\r\naccustomed to do before, and landed about an hour after sunrise, near a\r\nmile from the dwelling of the two Englishman, who, it seems, had the\r\ngood fortune to discover them about a league off: to that it was an hour\r\nbefore they could come at them. And now being confirmed in this opinion\r\nthat they were certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the two slaves\r\nwhich were left, causing two of the three men, whom they brought with\r\nthe women, and who proved very faithful to lead them with their wives,\r\nand other conveniences, into their retired care in the wood, and there\r\nto bind the two fellows hand and foot till they had further orders. They\r\nthen opened their fences, where they kept their milch goats, and drove\r\nthem all out, giving the goats liberty to ramble in the woods, to make\r\nthe savages believe that they were wild ones; but the slave had given a\r\ntruer information, which made them come to the very inclosures. The two\r\nfrighted men sent the other slave of the three, who had been with them\r\nby accident, to alarm the Spaniards, and desire their assistance; in\r\nthe mean time they took their arms and ammunition, and made to the cave\r\nwhere they had sent their wives, and securing their slaves, seated\r\nthemselves in a private place, from whence they might behold all the\r\nactions of the savages. Nor had they gone far, when ascending a rising\r\nground, they could see a little army of Indians approach to their\r\nbeautiful dwelling, and in a few moments more, perceive the same, and\r\ntheir furniture, to their unspeakable grief, burning in a consuming\r\nflame, and when this war done, they spread here and there, searching\r\nevery bush and place for the people, of whom it was very evident, they\r\nhad information. Upon which the two Englishmen, not thinking themselves\r\nsecure where they stood, retreated about half a mile higher in the\r\ncountry, rightly concluding, that the farther the savages strolled,\r\nthere would be less numbers together: upon which they next took their\r\nstand by the trunk of an old tree, very hollow and large, whence they\r\nresolved to see what would offer: but they had not stood long there,\r\nbefore two savages came running directly towards them, as though having\r\nknowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved to attack them; a\r\nlittle farther were three more, and five more behind them again, all\r\nrunning the same way. It cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men\r\nwere in at this sight, thinking that if assistance did not speedily come\r\ntheir cave in the wood would be discovered, and consequently all therein\r\nlost; so they resolved to resist them there, and, when overpowered, to\r\nascend to the top of the trees, where they might defend themselves as\r\nlong as their ammunition lasted, and sell their lives as dear as\r\npossible to those devouring savages. Thus fixed in their resolution,\r\nthey next considered, whether they should fire at the first two, or wait\r\nfor the three, and so take the middle party, by which the two first &\r\nthe five last would be separated. In this regulation the two savages\r\nalso confirmed them, by turning a little to another part of the wood:\r\nbut the three, & the five after them, came directly towards the tree.\r\nHereupon they resolved to take them in a direct line, as they approached\r\nnearer, because perhaps the first shot might hit them all three; and\r\nupon this occasion, the man who was to fire, charged his piece with\r\nthree or four bullets. And thus while they were waiting, the savages\r\ncame on, one of them was the runaway, who had caused all the mischief;\r\nso they resolved he should not escape, if they both fired at once. But,\r\nhowever, though they did not fire together, they were ready charged;\r\nwhen the first that let fly, was too good a marksman to miss his aim;\r\nfor he killed the foremost outright, the second (_who was the runaway\r\nIndian_) fell to the ground, being shot through the body, but not dead\r\nand the third was a little wounded in the shoulder, who, sitting down on\r\nthe ground, fell a screaming in a most fearful manner. The noise of the\r\nguns, which not only made the most resounding echoes, from one side to\r\nthe other, but raised the birds of all sorts, fluttering with the most\r\nconfused noise, so much terrified the five savages behind that they\r\nstood still at first, like so many inanimate images. But when all things\r\nwere in profound silence, they came to the place where there companions\r\nlay; and here, not being sensible that they were liable to the same\r\nfate, stood over the wounded man, undoubtedly inquiring the occasion of\r\nthis sad calamity; and 'tis as reasonable to suppose he told them, that\r\nit came by thunder and lightning from the gods, having never seen or\r\nheard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives. By this time\r\nthe Englishmen, having loaded their pieces, fired both together a second\r\ntime, when seeing them all fall immediately on the ground, they thought\r\nthey had killed every creature of them. This made them come up boldly\r\nbefore they had charged their guns, which indeed was a wrong step; for,\r\nwhen they came to the place, they found four alive, two of them very\r\nlittle wounded, and one not at all, which obliged them to fall upon them\r\nwith their muskets: they first knocked the runaway savage on the head,\r\nand another that was but a little wounded in the arm, & then put the\r\nother languishing wretches out of their pain: while he that was not\r\nhurt, with bended knees and uplifted hands, made piteous moans, and\r\nsigns to them to spare his life; nor, indeed, were they unmerciful to\r\nthe poor wretch, but pointed to him to sit down at the root of a tree\r\nhard by; and then, one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope twine he\r\nhad in his pocket, by mere chance, tying his two feet fast together, and\r\nhis two hands behind him, they left him there, making all the haste they\r\ncould after the other two, fearing they should find out their cave; but\r\nthough they could not overtake them, they had the satisfaction to\r\nperceive them at a distance, cross a valley towards the sea, a quite\r\ncontrary way to their retreat: upon which they returned to the tree, to\r\nlook after their prisoner; but when they came there, he was gone,\r\nleaving the piece of rope-yarn, wherewith he was bound, behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now they were as much concerned as ever, as not knowing how near\r\ntheir enemies might be, or in what numbers. Immediately they repaired to\r\nthe cave, to see if all was well there, and found every thing safe,\r\nexcept the women, who were frightened upon their husbands account, whom\r\nthey now loved entirely. They had not been long here, before seven of my\r\nSpaniards came to assist them; while the other ten, their servants, and\r\nFriday's father, were gone to defend their bower, corn, and cattle, in\r\ncase the savages should have rambled so far. There accompanied the seven\r\nSpaniards, one of the three savages that had formerly been taken\r\nprisoner; and with them also that very Indian whom the Englishmen had,\r\na little before, left under the tree; for it seems, they passed by that\r\nway where the slaughter was made, and so carried along with them that\r\npoor wretch that was left bound. But so many prisoners now becoming a\r\nburthen to us, and fearing the dreadful consequence of their escaping,\r\nmost of the Spaniards and English urged the absolute necessity there was\r\nof killing them for our common preservation; but, Sir, the authority I\r\nbore, as a governor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty; and then I\r\nordered them to be sent prisoners to the old cave in the valley, bound\r\nhands and feet, with two Spaniards to guard them.\r\n\r\n\"So much encouraged were the Englishmen at the approach of the\r\nSpaniards, and so great was their fury against the savages for\r\ndestroying their habitations, that they had not patience to stay any\r\nlonger; but, taking five Spaniards along with them, armed with four\r\nmuskets, a pistol, and a quarter staff, away they went in pursuit of\r\ntheir enemies. As they passed by the place where the savages were slain,\r\nit was very easy to be perceived that more of them had been there,\r\nhaving attempted to carry off their dead bodies, but found it\r\nimpracticable. From a rising ground our party had the mortification to\r\nsee the smoke that proceeded from their ruins; when coming farther in\r\nflight of the shore, they plainly perceived that the savages had\r\nembarked in their canoes, and were putting out to sea. This they were\r\nvery sorry for, there being no coming at them to give them a parting\r\nsalute, but however, they were glad enough to get clear of such\r\nunwelcome guests.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the two honest, but unfortunate Englishmen, being ruined a second\r\ntime, and their improvements quite destroyed, most of my good natured\r\nSpaniards helped them to rebuild, and we all assisted them with needful\r\nsupplies; nay, what is more remarkable, their three mischievous\r\ncountrymen, when they heard of it _(which was after all these disasters\r\nwere over, they living more remote eastward)_ very friendly sympathised\r\nwith them, and worked for them several days; so that, in a little, their\r\nhabitations were rebuilt, their necessities supplied, and themselves\r\nrestored to their former tranquility.\r\n\r\n\"Though the savages had nothing to boast of in this adventure, _(several\r\ncanoes being driven ashore, followed by two drowned creatures, having\r\nundoubtedly met with a storm at sea that very night they departed)_ yet\r\nit was natural to be supposed, that those whose better fortune it was to\r\nattain their native shore, would inflame their nation to another ruinous\r\nattempt, with a greater force, to carry all before them. And, indeed, so\r\nit happened: for about seven months after, our island was invaded with a\r\nmost formidable navy, no less than eight and twenty canoes full of\r\nsavages, armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows and arrows, and\r\nsuch like instruments of war, landing at the east end of the island.\r\n\r\n\"You may well, Sir, imagine what consternation our men were in upon\r\nthis account, and how speedy they were to execute their resolution,\r\nhaving only that night's time allowed them. They knew that since they\r\ncould not withstand their enemies, concealment was the only way to\r\nprocure their safety; and, therefore, they took down the huts that were\r\nbuilt for the two Englishmen, and drove their flocks of goats together\r\nwith their own at the bower, to the old cave in the valley, leaving as\r\nlittle appearance of inhabitants as possible; and then posted\r\nthemselves, with all their force, at the plantation of the two men. As\r\nthey expected, so it happened: for early the next morning, the Indians,\r\nleaving their canoes at the east-end of the island, came running along\r\nthe shore, about two hundred and fifty in number, as near as could be\r\nguessed. Our army was but little indeed; and what was our greatest\r\nmisfortune, we had not arms sufficient for them. The account, as to the\r\nmen, Sir, is an follows: viz. 17 _Spaniards_, 5 _Englishmen, Old Friday,\r\nthe three savages, taken with the five women, who proved faithful\r\nservants, and three other slaves, living with the Spaniards. To arm\r\nthese they had_ 11 _muskets_, 5 _pistols_, 3 _fowling-pieces_, 2\r\n_swords_, 3 _old halberts_, 5 _muskets, or fowling-pieces, taken from\r\nthe sailors whom you reduced. As to the slaves, we gave three of them\r\nhalberts, and the other three long staves, with great iron spikes at the\r\nend of them, with hatchets by their sides; we also had hatchets sticking\r\nin our girdles, besides the fire-arms: nay, two of the women, inspired\r\nwith Amazonian fortitude, could not be dissuaded from fighting along\r\nwith their dear husbands, and if they died, to die with them, Seeing\r\ntheir resolution, we gave them hatchets likewise; but what pleased them\r\nbest, were the bows and arrows (which they dexterously knew how to use)\r\nthat the Indians had left behind them, after their memorable battle one\r\nagainst another_.\r\n\r\n\"Over this army, which though little, was of great intrepidity, I was\r\nconstituted chief general and commander: and knowing Will Atkins, though\r\nexceedingly wicked, yet a man of invincible courage, I gave him the\r\npower of commanding under me: he had six men with their muskets loaded\r\nwith six or seven bullets a-piece, and were planted just behind a small\r\nthicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, having orders to let the first\r\npass by; and then, when he fired into the middle of them, making a\r\nnimble retreat round a part of the wood, and so come in the rear of the\r\nSpaniards, who were shaded by a thicket of trees: for though the savages\r\ncame on with the fierceness of lions, yet they wanted the subtility of\r\nfoxes, being out of all manner of order, and straggling in heaps every\r\nway: and, indeed, when Will Atkins, after fifty of the savages had\r\npassed by, had ordered three of his men to give fire, so great was their\r\nconsternation, to see so many men killed and wounded, and hear such a\r\ndreadful noise, and yet knew not whence it came, that they were\r\nfrightened to the highest degree: and when the second volley was given,\r\nthey concluded no less but that their companions were slain by thunder\r\nand lightning from Heaven. In this notion they would have continued, had\r\nWill Atkins and his men retired, as soon as they fired, according to\r\norder: or had the rest been near them, to pour in their shot\r\ncontinually, their might have been a complete victory obtained: but\r\nstaying to load their pieces again, discovered the whole matter. They\r\nwere perceived by some of the scattering savages at a distance, who let\r\nfly their arrows among them, wounded Atkins himself, and killed his\r\nfellow Englishman, and one of the Indians taken with the women. Our\r\nparty did not fail to answer them, and in their retreat killed about\r\ntwenty savages. Here I cannot but take notice of our poor dying slave,\r\nwho, tho' stopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his staff\r\nand hatchet, desperately and gallantly assailed his pursuers, and killed\r\nfive of the savages, before his life submitted to a multiplicity of\r\nwounds. Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to be less remarked,\r\nin breaking the arms, legs, and heads of the two dead bodies, with their\r\nclubs and wooden swords, after a most wretched manner. As Atkins\r\nretreated our party advanced, to interpose between him and the savages:\r\nbut after three vollies, we were obliged to retreat also: for they were\r\nso numerous and desperate, that they came up to our very teeth, shot\r\ntheir arrows like a cloud, and their wounded men, enraged with cruel\r\npain, fought like madmen. They did not, however, think fit to follow us,\r\nbut drawing themselves up in a circle, they gave two triumphant shouts\r\nin token of victory, though they had the grief to see several of their\r\nwounded men bleed to death before them.\r\n\r\n\"After I had, Sir, drawn up our little army together, upon a rising\r\nground, Atkins, wounded as he was, would have had us attack the whole\r\nbody of the savages at once, I was extremely well pleased with the\r\ngallantry of the man: but, upon consideration, I replied, _You perceive,\r\nSeignor Atkins, how their wounded men fight; let them alone till\r\nmorning, when they will be faint, stiff, and sore, and then we shall\r\nhave fewer to combat with_. To which Atkins, smiling, replied, _That's\r\nvery true, Seignor, so shall I too; and that's the reason I would fight\r\nthem now I am warm_. We all answered, _Seignor Atkins for your part you\r\nhave behaved very gallantly; and, if you are not able to approach the\r\nenemy in the morning, we will fight for you, till then we think it\r\nconvenient to wait_, and so we tarried.\r\n\r\n\"By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceived the savages in\r\ngreat disorder about their dead and wounded men. This made us change our\r\nresolution, and resolve to fall upon them in the night, if we could\r\ngive them one volley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do,\r\nby one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between the woods and the\r\nsea-side westward, and turning short south, came privately to a place\r\nwhere the thickest of them were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us\r\nfired among them, and did dreadful execution; and in half a minute\r\nafter, eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abundance of them;\r\nand then dividing ourselves into three bodies, eight persons in each\r\nbody we marched from among the trees, to the very teeth of the enemy,\r\nsending forth the greatest shouts and acclamations. The savages hearing\r\na different noise from three quarters at once, stood in the utmost\r\nconfusion; but coming in sight of us, let fly a volley of arrows, which\r\nwounded poor old Friday, yet happily it did not prove mortal. We did\r\nnot, however, give them a second opportunity; but rushing in among them,\r\nwe fired three several ways, and then fell to work with our swords,\r\nstaves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our muskets, with a fury not to be\r\nresisted; so that with the most dismal screaming and howling they had\r\nrecourse to their feet, to save their lives by a speedy flight. Nor must\r\nwe forget the valour of the two women; for they exposed themselves to\r\nthe greatest dangers, killed many with their arrows, and valiantly\r\ndestroyed several more with their hatchets.\r\n\r\n\"In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired, that we did not\r\nthen trouble ourselves to pursue them to their canoes, in which we\r\nthought they would presently put to the ocean; but their happening a\r\ndreadful storm at sea, which continuing all that night, it not only\r\nprevented their voyage, but dashed several of their boats to pieces\r\nagainst the beach, and drove the rest so high upon the shore, that it\r\nrequired infinite labour to get them off. After our men had taken some\r\nrefreshment and a little repose, they resolved early in the morning to\r\ngo towards the place of their landing, and see whether they were gone\r\noff, or in what posture they remained. This necessarily led them to the\r\nplace of battle, where several of the savages were expiring, a sight no\r\nway pleasing to generous minds, to delight in misery, though obliged to\r\nconquer them by the law of arms; but our own Indian slaves put them out\r\nof their pain, by dispatching them with their hatchets. At length,\r\ncoming in view of the remainder of the army, we found them leaning upon\r\ntheir knees, which were bended towards their mouth, and the head between\r\nthe two hands. Hereupon, coming within musket shot of them, I ordered\r\ntwo pieces to be fired without ball, in order to alarm them, that we\r\nmight plainly know, whether they had the courage to venture another\r\nbattle, or were utterly dispirited from such an attempt, that so we\r\nmight accordingly manage them. And indeed, the prospect took very well;\r\nfor, no sooner did the savages hear the first gun, and perceive the\r\nflash of the second, but they suddenly started upon their feet in the\r\ngreatest consternation; and when we approached towards them, they ran\r\nhowling and screaming away up the hill into the country.\r\n\r\n\"We could rather, at first, have wished, that the weather had permitted\r\nthem to have gone off to the sea; but when we considered, that their\r\nescape might occasion the approach of multitudes, to our utter ruin and\r\ndissolution; we were very well pleased the contrary happened; and Will\r\nAtkins (who, tho' wounded, would not part from us all this while)\r\nadvised us not to let slip this advantage, but clapping between them and\r\ntheir boats, deprive them of the capacity of ever returning to plague\r\nthe island: _I know_, said he, _there is but on objection you can make,\r\nwhich is, that these creatures, living like beasts in the wood, may make\r\nexcursions, rifle the plantations, and destroy the tame goats; but then,\r\nconsider, we had better to do with an hundred men whom we can kill, or\r\nmake slaves of at leisure, than with an hundred nations, whom it is\r\nimpossible we should save ourselves from, much less subdue_. This\r\nadvice, and these arguments being approved of, we set fire to their\r\nboats; and though they were so wet that we could not burn them entirely,\r\nyet we made them incapable for swimming in the seas. As soon as the\r\nIndians perceived what we were doing, many of them ran out of the woods,\r\nin fight of us, and kneeling down, piteously cried out, _Oa, Oa!\r\nWaramakoa_. Intimating, I suppose, that, if we would but spare their\r\ncanoes, they would never trouble us again.\r\n\r\n\"But all their complaints, submissions, and entreaties, were in vain;\r\nfor self-preservation obliging us to the contrary, we destroyed every\r\none of them that had escaped the fury of the ocean. When the Indians\r\nperceived this, they raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the woods,\r\nwhere they continued ranging about; making the woods ring with their\r\nlamentation. Here we should have considered, that making these\r\ncreatures, thus desperate, we ought, at the same time to have set a\r\nsufficient guard upon the plantations: for the savages, in their ranging\r\nabout, found out the bower, destroyed the fences, trod the corn down\r\nunder their feet, and tore up the vines and grapes. It is true, we were\r\nalways able to fight these creatures; but, as they were too swift for\r\nus, and very numerous, we durst not go out single, for fear of them;\r\nthough that too was needless, they having no weapons, nor any materials\r\nto make them; and, indeed, their extremity appeared in a little\r\ntime after.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: The Spaniard, &c. burning the Indian canoes. _Dr. & Eng.\r\nby A. Carse, Edin._]\r\n\r\n\"Though the savages, as already mentioned, had destroyed our bower, and\r\nall our corns, grapes, &c. yet we had still left our flock of cattle in\r\nthe valley, by the cave, with some little corn that grew there, and the\r\nplantation of Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom being killed\r\nby an arrow, they were now reduced to two: it is remarkable that this\r\nwas the fellow who cut the poor Indian with his hatchet, and had design\r\nto murder me and my countrymen the Spaniards. As our condition was low,\r\nwe came to the resolution to drive the savages up to the farther part of\r\nthe island, where no Indians landed, to kill as many of them as we\r\ncould, till we had reduced their number; and then to give the remainder\r\nsome corn to plant, and to teach them how to live by their daily labour,\r\naccordingly we pursued them with our guns, at the hearing of which they\r\nwere so terrified, that they would fall to the ground. Every day we\r\nkilled and wounded some of them, and many were found starved to death,\r\nso that our hearts began to relent at the sight of such miserable\r\nobjects. At last, with great difficulty, taking one of them alive, and\r\nusing him with kindness, & tenderness, we brought him to Old Friday, who\r\ntalked to him, & told him how good we would be to them all, giving them\r\ncorn and land to plant and live in, and present nourishment, provided\r\nthey should keep within such bounds as should be allotted them, and not\r\ndo prejudice to others: _Go then_, said he, _and inform your countrymen\r\nof this; which, if they will not agree to, every one of them shall\r\nbe slain_.\r\n\r\n\"The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being reduced to about\r\nthirty-seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and earnestly begged for\r\nfood; hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen well armed,\r\ntogether with Old Friday, and three Indian slaves were loaded with a\r\nlarge quantity of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats: and the\r\npoor Indians being ordered to sit down on the side of the hill, they ate\r\nthe victuals very thankfully, and have proved faithful to the last,\r\nnever trespassing beyond their bounds, where at this day they quietly\r\nand happily remain, and where we now and then visit them. They are\r\nconfined to a neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and three or\r\nfour in length, on the south-east corner of the island, the sea being\r\nbefore, and lofty mountains behind them, free from the appearance of\r\ncanoes; and indeed their countrymen never made any inquiry after them.\r\nWe gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; have taught them\r\nto build huts, make wooden spades, plant corn, make bread, breed tame\r\ngoats and milk them, as likewise to make wicker work, in which I must\r\ningenuously confess, they infinitely out do us, having made themselves\r\nseveral pretty necessaries and fancies, as baskets, sieves, bird-cages,\r\nand cupboards, as also stools, beds and couches, no less useful than\r\ndelightful; and now they live the most innocent and inoffensive\r\ncreatures that ever were subdued in the world, wanting nothing but wives\r\nto make them a nation.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, kind Sir, have I given you, according to my ability, an\r\nimpartial account of the various transactions that have happened, in the\r\nisland since your departure to this day; and we have great reason to\r\nacknowledge the kind providence of Heaven in our merciful deliverance.\r\nWhen you inspect your little kingdom, you will find in it some little\r\nimprovement, your flocks increased, and your subjects augmented, so that\r\nfrom a desolate island, as this was before your wonderful deliverance\r\nupon it, here is a visible prospect of its becoming a populous and well\r\ngoverned little kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt to suppose but that the preceeding relation of my\r\nfaithful Spaniard was very agreeable and no less surprising to me, to\r\nthe young priest, and to all who heard it: now were these people less\r\npleased with those necessary utensils that I brought them, such as the\r\nknives, scissars, spades, shovels, and pick-axes, with which they now\r\nadorn their habitations.\r\n\r\nSo much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work, prompted by the\r\ningenuity of the Indians, who assisted them, that when I viewed the\r\nEnglishmen's colonies, they seemed at a distance as though they had\r\nlived like bees in a hive: for Will Atkins, who was now become a very\r\nindustrious and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work round\r\nthe outside; the walls were worked in as a basket, in pannels or strong\r\nsquares of thirty-two in number, standing about seven feet high: in the\r\nmiddle was another, not above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger\r\nbuilt, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood eight\r\nstrong poles, round the top of which he raised a pyramid for the roof,\r\nmighty pretty, I assure you, and joined very well together, with iron\r\nspikes, which he made himself; for he had made him a forge, with a pair\r\nof wooden bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil cut of one\r\nof the iron crows, to work upon, and in the manner would he make himself\r\nhooks, staples, spikes, bolts, and hinges. After he had pitched the roof\r\nof his innermost tent, he made it so firm between the rafters with\r\nbasket-work, thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a\r\nlarge leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled\r\nor slated. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, quite round this\r\ninner appartment, laying long rafters from the thirty-two angles to the\r\ntop posts of the inner house, about twenty-feet distant, so that there\r\nwas a space like a wall between the outer and inner wall, near twenty\r\nfeet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned off with the same\r\nwicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments every one of which had\r\na door, first into the entry of the main tent, and another into the\r\nspace and walk that was round it, not only convenient for retreat, but\r\nfor family necessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was\r\na passage directly to the door of the inner house; on either side was a\r\nwicker partition, and a door, by which you go into a room twenty-two\r\nfeet wide, and about thirty long, and through that into another of a\r\nsmaller length; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six\r\nof which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner\r\ntent, serving as retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner\r\ncircle, and four large warehouses, which went in through one another,\r\ntwo on either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the\r\ninner tent. In short, nothing could be built more ingeniously, kept more\r\nneat, or have better conveniences; and here lived the three families,\r\nWill Atkins, his companion, their wives and children, and the widow of\r\nthe deceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught their wives the\r\nknowledge of God, any more than the sailors' custom of swearing by his\r\nname. The greatest improvement their wives had, was, they taught them to\r\nspeak English, so as to be understood.\r\n\r\nNone of their children were then above six years old; they were all\r\nfruitful enough; and I think the cook's mate's wife was big of her\r\nsixth child.\r\n\r\nWhen I inquired of the Spaniards about their circumstances while among\r\nthe savages, they told me, _that they abandoned themselves to despair,\r\nreckoning themselves a poor and miserable people, that had no means put\r\ninto their hands, and consequently must soon be starved to death._ They\r\nowned, however, that they were in the wrong to think so, and for\r\nrefusing the assistance that reason offered for their support, as well\r\nas future deliverance, confessing that grief was a most insignificant\r\npassion, as it looked upon things as without remedy, and having no hope\r\nof things to come; all which verified this noted proverb,\r\n\r\n_In trouble to be troubled,\r\nIs to have your trouble doubled._\r\n\r\nNor did his remarks end here, for, making observations upon my\r\nimprovement, and on my condition at first, infinitely worse than theirs,\r\nhe told me that Englishmen had, in their distress, greater presence of\r\nmind than those of any other country that he had met with; and that they\r\nand the Portuguese were the worst men in the world to struggle under\r\nmisfortunes. When they landed among the savages, they found but little\r\nprovision except they would turn cannibals, there being but a few roots\r\nand herbs, with little substance in them, and of which the natives gave\r\nthem but very sparingly. Many were the ways they took to civilize and\r\nteach the savages, but in vain; for they would not own them to be their\r\ninstructors, whose lives were owing to their bounty. Their extremities\r\nwere very great and many days being entirely without food, the savages\r\nthere being more indolent and less devouring than those who had better\r\nsupplies. When they went out to battle they were obliged to assist these\r\npeople, in one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had like to\r\nhave been devoured. They had lost their ammunition, which rendered their\r\nfire-arms useless; nor could they use the bows and arrows that were\r\ngiven them, so that while the armies were at a distance, they had no\r\nchance but when close, then they could be of service with halberts, &\r\nsharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets. They made\r\nthemselves targets of wood covered with the skins of wild beasts; and\r\nwhen one happened to be knocked down, the rest of the company fought\r\nover him till he recovered; and then standing close in a line, they\r\nwould make their way through a thousand savages. At the return of their\r\nfriend, who they thought had been entombed in the bowels of their\r\nenemies, their joy was inconceivable. Nor were they less surprised at\r\nthe sight of the loaves of bread I had sent them, things that they had\r\nnot seen for several years, at the same time crossing and blessing it,\r\nas though it was manna sent from Heaven: but when they knew the errand,\r\nand perceived the boat which was to carry them back to the person and\r\nplace from whence such relief came, this struck them with such a\r\nsurprise of joy as made some of them faint away, and others burst out\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\nThis was the summary account that I had from them. I shall now inform\r\nthe reader what I next did for them, and in what condition I left them.\r\nAs we were all of opinion that the savages would scarce trouble them any\r\nmore, so we had no apprehensions on the score. I told them I was come\r\npurely to establish, and not to remove them; and upon that occasion, had\r\nnot only brought them necessaries for convenience and defence, but also\r\nartificers, and other persons, both for their necessary employments, and\r\nto add to their number. They were altogether when I thus talked to them;\r\nand before I delivered to them the stores I brought, I asked them, one\r\nby one, if they had entirely forgot their first animosities, would\r\nengage in the strictest friendship; and shake hands with one another? On\r\nthis Will Atkins, with abundance of good humour, said, _they had\r\nafflictions enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough to make\r\nthem all friends: as for himself, he would live and die among them,\r\nowning that what the Spaniards had done to him, his own mad humour had\r\nmade necessary for them to do_. Nor had the Spaniards occasion to\r\njustify their proceeding to me; but they told me, _that since Will\r\nAtkins had behaved himself so valiantly in fight, and at other times\r\nshowed such a regard to the common interest of them all, they had not\r\nonly forgotten all that was past, but thought he ought as much to be\r\ntrusted with arms and necessaries as any of them, which they testified\r\nby making him next in command to the governor: and they most heartily\r\nembraced the occasion of giving me this solemn assurance, that they\r\nwould never separate their interest again, as long as they lived_.\r\n\r\nAfter these kind declarations of friendship, we appointed all of us to\r\ndine together the next day; upon this I caused the ship's cook and his\r\nmate to come on shore for that purpose, to assist in dressing our\r\ndinner. We brought from the ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork,\r\ntogether with our punch bowl, and materials to fill it; and in\r\nparticular I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of English\r\nbeer, which was very acceptable to them. The Spaniards added to our\r\nfeast, five whose kids, which being roasted, three of them were sent as\r\nfresh meat to the sailors on board, and the other two we ate ourselves.\r\nAfter our merry and innocent feast was over, I began to distribute my\r\ncargo among them. First, I gave them linen sufficient to make every one\r\nfour shirts, and at the Spaniard's request made them up six. The thin\r\nEnglish stuffs I allotted to make every one a light coat like a frock,\r\nagreeable to the climate, and left them such a quantity as to make more\r\nupon their decay; as also pumps, shoes, hats, and stockings. It is not\r\nto be expressed the pleasing satisfaction which sat upon the\r\ncountenances of these poor men, when they perceived what care I took of\r\nthem, as if I had been a common father to them all; and they all engaged\r\nnever to leave the island, till I gave my consent for their departure. I\r\nthen presented to them the people I brought, viz. the tailor, smith, and\r\nthe two carpenters; but my Jack-of-all-trades was the most acceptable\r\npresent I could make them. My tailor fell immediately to work, and made\r\nevery one of them a shirt; after which, he learned the women how to sew\r\nand stitch, thereby to become the more helpful to their husbands.\r\nNeither were the carpenters less useful, taking in pieces their clumsy\r\nthings; instead of which they made convenient and handsome tables,\r\nstools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, and shelves. But when I carried\r\nthem to see Will Atkins's basket-house, they owned they never saw such a\r\npiece of natural ingenuity before: _I am sure,_ said one of the\r\ncarpenters, _the man that built this has no need of us; you need, Sir,\r\ndo nothing but give him tools._\r\n\r\nI divided the tools among them in this manner: to every man I gave a\r\ndigging spade, a shovel, and a rake, as having no harrows or ploughs;\r\nand to every separate place a pickax, a crow, a broad ax, and a saw,\r\nwith a store for a general supply, should any be broken or worn out. I\r\nleft them also nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives,\r\nscissors, and all sorts of tools and iron work; & for the use of the\r\nsmith, gave them three tons of unwrought iron, for a supply; and as to\r\narms and ammunition, I stored them even to profusion; or at least to\r\nequip a sufficient little army against all opposers whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe young man (whose mother was unfortunately starved to death) together\r\nwith the maid, a pious and well educated young woman, seeing things so\r\nwell ordered on shore (for I made them accompany me) and considering\r\nthey had no occasion to go so far a voyage as to the East Indies, they\r\nboth desired of me, that I would leave them there, and enter them among\r\nmy subjects. This I readily agreed to, ordering them a plat of ground,\r\non which were three little houses erected, environed with basket-work,\r\npallisadoed like Atkins's and adjoining to his plantation. So contrived\r\nwere their tents that each of them had a room apart to lodge in, while\r\nthe middle tent was not only their store-house, but their place for\r\neating and drinking. At this time the two Englishmen removed their\r\nhabitation to their former place; in that now the island was divided\r\ninto three colonies: first, Those I have just now mentioned; secondly\r\nThat of Will Atkins, where there were four families of Englishmen, with\r\ntheir wives and children, the widow and her children; the young man and\r\nthe maid, who, by the way, we made a wife of before our departure; three\r\nsavages, who were slaves; the tailor, smith, (who served also as a\r\ngunsmith) and my other celebrated person called Jack-of-all-trades.\r\nThirdly, my chief colony, which consisted of the Spaniards, with Old\r\nFriday, who still remained at my old habitation, which was my capital\r\ncity, and surely never was there such a metropolis, it now being hid in\r\nso obscure a grove, that a thousand men might have ranged the island a\r\nmonth, and looked purposely for it, without being able to find it,\r\nthough the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries, both without and\r\nwithin, in a most surprising manner.\r\n\r\nBut now I think it high time to speak of the young French priest of the\r\norder of St. Benedict, whose judicious and pious discourses, upon sundry\r\noccasions, merit an extraordinary observation; nor can his being a\r\nFrench Papist priest, I presume, give offence to any of my readers, when\r\nthey have this assurance from me, that he was a person of the most\r\ncourteous disposition, extensive charity, and exalted piety. His\r\narguments were always agreeable to reason, and his conversation the most\r\nacceptable of any person that I had ever yet met with in my life.\r\n\r\n_Sir,_ said he, to me, one day, _since, under God,_ at the same time\r\ncrossing his breast, _you have not only saved my life; but, by\r\npermitting me to go this voyage, have granted me the happiness of free\r\nconversation, I think is my duty as my profession obliges me, to save\r\nwhat souls I can, by bringing them to the knowledge of some Catholic\r\ndoctrine, necessary to salvation; and since these people are under your\r\nimmediate government, in gratitude, justice, and decency, for what you\r\nhave done for me, I shall offer no farther points in religion, that what\r\nshall merit your approbation_. Being a-pleased with the modesty of his\r\ncarriage, I told him he should not be worse used for being of a\r\ndifferent persuasion, if upon that very account, we did not differ in\r\npoints of faith, not decent in a part of the country where the poor\r\nIndians ought to be instructed in the knowledge of the true God, and his\r\nSon Jesus Christ. To this he replied, that conversation might easily be\r\nseparated from disputes; that he would discourse with me rather as a\r\ngentleman than a religious: but that, if we did enter upon religious\r\nargument, upon my desiring the same, I would give him liberty to defend\r\nhis own principles. He farther added, that he would do all that became\r\nhim in his office, as a priest as well as a Christian, to procure the\r\nhappiness of all that were in the ship: that though he could not pray\r\nwith, he would pray for us on all occasions; and then he told me several\r\nextraordinary events of his life, within a few years past; but\r\nparticularly in this last, which was the most remarkable: that, in this\r\nvoyage, he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipped:\r\nhis first design was to have gone to Martinico; for which, taking ship\r\nat St. Malos, he was forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the vessel\r\nrunning aground in the mouth of the Tagus; that from thence he went on\r\nboard a Portuguese ship, bound to the Madeiras, whose master being but\r\nan indifferent mariner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove to\r\nFial, where selling their commodity, which was corn, they resolved to\r\ntake in their loading at the Isle of May, and to sail to Newfoundland;\r\nat the banks of which, meeting a French ship bound to Quebec, in the\r\nriver of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, in this ship he embarked;\r\nthe master of which dying at Quebec, that voyage was suspended; and\r\nlastly, shipping himself for France, this last ship was destroyed by\r\nfire, as before has been related.\r\n\r\nAt this time we talked no further; but another morning he comes to me,\r\njust as I was going to visit the Englishman's colony, and tells me, that\r\nas he knew; the prosperity of the island, was my principal desire, he\r\nhad something to communicate agreeable to my design, by which perhaps he\r\nmight put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the way of the\r\nbenediction of heaven. _How, Sir,_ said I, in a surprise, _are we not\r\nyet in the way of God's blessings, after all these signal providences\r\nand deliverances, of which you have had such an ample relation?_ He\r\nreplied, _Nope, Sir, you are in the way, and that your good design will\r\nprosper: but still there are some among you that are not equally right\r\nin their actions; and remember, I beseech you, Sir, that Achan, by his\r\ncrime, removed God's blessing from the camp of the children of Israel;\r\nthat though six and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became the\r\nobject of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of his punishment\r\naccordingly._\r\n\r\nSo sensibly was I touched with this discourse, and so satisfied with\r\nthat ardent piety that inflamed his soul, that I desired him to\r\naccompany me to the Englishman's plantations, which he was very glad of,\r\nby reason they were the subject of what he designed to discourse with me\r\nabout: and while we walked on together, he began in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, said he, I must confess it as a great unhappiness that we disagree\r\nin several doctrinal articles of religion; but surely both of us\r\nacknowledge this, that there is a God, who having given us some stated\r\nrules for our service and obedience, we ought not willingly and\r\nknowingly to offend him; either by neglecting what he has commanded, or\r\nby doing what he has forbidden. This truth every Christian owns, that\r\nwhen any one presumptuously sins against God's command, the Almighty\r\nthen withdraws his blessing from him; every good man therefore ought\r\ncertainly to prevent such neglect of, or sin against, God and his\r\ncommands.\" I thanked the young priest for expressing so great a concern\r\nfor us, and desired him to explain the particulars of what he had\r\nobserved, that according to the parable of Achan, I _might remove the\r\naccursed thing from among us_ \"Why then, Sir, said he, in the first\r\nplace, you have four Englishmen, who have taken savage women to their\r\nwives, by whom they have several children, though none of them are\r\nlegally married, as the law of God and man requires; they, I say, Sir,\r\nare no less than adulterers, and as they still live in adultery, are\r\nliable to the curse of God. I know, Sir, you may object the want of a\r\npriest or clergyman of any kind; as also, pen, ink and paper, to write\r\ndown a contract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But\r\nneither this, nor what the Spanish governor has told you of their\r\nchoosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage, nor any more than an\r\nagreement to keep them from quarrelling among themselves; for, Sir, the\r\nessence or sacrament of matrimony (so he called it) not only consists in\r\nmutual consent, but in the legal obligation, which compels them to own\r\nand acknowledge one another, to abstain from other persons, the men to\r\nprovide for their wives and children, and the woman to the same and like\r\nconditions, _nutatis mutandis,_ on their side: whereas, Sir, these men,\r\nupon their own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those women and\r\nmarry others, and by disowning their children, suffer them utterly to\r\nperish. Now, Sir, 'added he, 'can God be honoured in such an unlawful\r\nliberty as this; how can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if\r\nmen are allowed to live in so licentious a way?\" I was indeed struck\r\nwith the thing myself, and thought that they were much to blame, that no\r\nformal contract had been made, though it had been but breaking a stick\r\nbetween them, to engage them to live as man and wife, never to separate,\r\nbut love, cherish, and comfort one another all their lives; _yet Sir,_\r\nsaid I, _when they took these wommen, I was not here, and if it is\r\nadultery, it is past my remedy, and I cannot help it_. \"True, Sir,'\r\nanswered the young priest, you cannot be charged with that part of the\r\ncrime which was done in your absence: but I beseech you, don't flatter\r\nyourself, that you are under no obligation now to put a period to it:\r\nwhich if you neglect to do, the guilt will be entirely on you alone,\r\nsince it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to alter their\r\ncondition.\" I must confess, I was so dull, that I thought he meant, I\r\nshould part them, and knowing that this would put the whole island in\r\nconfusion, I told him, I could not consent to it upon any account\r\nwhatsoever. \"Sir,' said he, in a great surprise, 'I do not mean that you\r\nshould separate, but marry them, by a written contract, signed by both\r\nman and woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the European\r\nlaws decree to be of sufficient efficacy.\" Amazed with such true piety\r\nand sincerity, and considering the validity of a written contract, I\r\nacknowledged all that he said to be very just and kind, and that I would\r\ndiscourse with the man about it; neither could I see what reason they\r\ncould have not to let him marry them, whose authority in that affair is\r\nowned to be as authentic as if they were married by any of our clergymen\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nThe next complaint he had to make to me was this, that though these\r\nEnglish subjects of mine have lived with these women seven years, and\r\nthough they were of good understanding, and capable of instruction,\r\nhaving learned not only to speak, but to read English, yet all this\r\nwhile they had never taught them any thing of the Christian religion, or\r\nthe knowledge of God, much less in what manner he ought to be served.\r\n\"And is not this an unaccountable neglect:' said he warmly. 'Depend upon\r\nit, God Almighty will call them to account for such contempt. And though\r\nI am not of your religion, yet I should be glad to see these people\r\nreleased from the devil's power, and be saved by the principles of the\r\nChristian religion, the knowledge of God, of a Redeemer, the\r\nresurrection, and of a future state. But as it is not too late, if you\r\nplease to give me leave to instruct them, I doubt not but I shall supply\r\nthis great defect, by bringing them into the great circle of\r\nChristianity, even while you continue in the island.\"\r\n\r\nI could hold no longer, but embracing him, told him, with a thousand\r\nthanks, I would grant whatever he requested, and desired him to proceed\r\nin the third article, which he did in the following manner;\r\n\r\n\"Sir,' said he, 'it should be a maxim among all Christians, that\r\nChristian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means, and on\r\nall occasion. Upon this account our church sends missionaries into\r\nPersia, India, and China, men who are willing to die for the sake of God\r\n& the Christian faith, in order to bring poor infidels into the way of\r\nsalvation. Now, Sir, as here is an opportunity to convert seven & thirty\r\npoor savages, I wonder how you can pass by such an occasion of doing\r\ngood, which is really worth the expence of a man's whole life.\"\r\n\r\nI must confess I was so confounded at this discourse, that I could not\r\ntell how to answer him. \"Sir,' said he, feeling me in disorder, 'I shall\r\nbe very sorry if I have given you offence.\" _No Sir,_ said I, _I am\r\nrather confounded; and you know my circumstances, that being bound to\r\nthe East Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot wrong the owners so much,\r\nas to detain the ship here, the men lying at victuals and savages on\r\ntheir account. If I stay aboard several days, I must pay 3l. sterling_\r\nper diem _demurage, nor must the ship stop above eight days more; so\r\nthat I am unable to engage in this work, unless I would leave the ship,\r\nand be reduced to my former condition._ The priest, though he owned this\r\nwas hard upon me, yet laid it to my conscience, whether the blessing of\r\nsaving seven and thirty souls was not worth venturing all that I had in\r\nthe world? _Sir,_ said I, _it is very true; but as you are an\r\necclesiastic, it naturally falls into your profession: why, therefore,\r\ndon't you rather offer to undertake it yourself than press me to it?_\r\nupon this he turned about, making a very low bow, \"I most humbly thank\r\nGod and you, Sir, (said he) for so blessed a call; and most willingly\r\nundertake so glorious an office, which will sufficiently compensate all\r\nthe hazards and difficulties I have gone through in a long and\r\nuncomfortable voyage.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture in his face, by\r\nhis colour going and coming; at the same time his eyes sparkled like\r\nfire, and all the signs of the most zealous transports. And when I asked\r\nwhether he was in earnest? _Sir,_ said he, _it was to preach to the\r\nIndians I consented to come along with you; these infidels, even in this\r\nlittle island, are infinitely of more worth than my poor life: if so\r\nthat I should prove the happy instrument of saving these poor creatures'\r\nsouls, I care not if I never see my native country again. One thing I\r\nonly beg of you more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to be my\r\ninterpreter, without whose assistance neither of us will understand\r\neach other._\r\n\r\nThis request very sensibly troubled me; first, upon Friday's being bred\r\na Protestant; and secondly, for the affection I bore to him for his\r\nfidelity: But, immediately the remembrance of Friday's father coming\r\ninto my head, I recommended him to him as having learned Spanish, which\r\nthe priest also understood; and so was thoroughly satisfied with him.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the Englishmen, after I had told them what necessary\r\nthings I had done for them, I talked to them of the scandalous life they\r\nled, told them what notice the clergyman had taken of it, and asked them\r\nif they were married men or bachelors? They answered, two of them were\r\nwidowers, and the other three single men. But, said I, with what\r\nconscience can you call these your wives, by whom you have so many\r\nchildren, and yet are not lawfully married? They all said that they took\r\nthem before the governor as such, having nobody else to marry them,\r\nwhich they thought as legal, as if they had had a parson. No doubt, said\r\nI, but in the eye of God it is so: but unless I am assured of your\r\nhonest intent, never to desert these poor creatures, I can do nothing\r\nmore for you, neither can you expect God's blessing while you live in\r\nsuch an open course of adultery. Hereupon, Will Atkins, who spoke for\r\nthe rest, told me 'That they believed their wives the most innocent and\r\nvirtuous creatures in the world; that they would never forsake them\r\nwhile they had breath; and that, if there was a clergyman in the ship,\r\nthey would be married to them with all their hearts.' I told you before,\r\nsaid I, that I have a minister with me, who shall marry you to-morrow\r\nmorning, if you are willing; so I would have you consult to-night with\r\nthe rest about it. I told him the clergyman was a Frenchman, and knew\r\nnot a word of English, but that I would act as clerk between them. And\r\nindeed this business met with such speedy success, that they all told\r\nme, in a few minutes after, 'that they were ready to be formally married\r\nas soon as I pleased;' with which informing the priest, he was\r\nexceedingly rejoiced.\r\n\r\nNothing now remained, but that the women should be made sensible of the\r\nmeaning of the thing; with which being well satisfied, they with their\r\nhusbands attended at my apartment the next morning; there was my priest,\r\nhabited in a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round it;\r\nmuch resembling a minister, and I was his interpreter. But the\r\nseriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he made of marrying the\r\nwomen, who were not baptized, gave them, an exceeding reverence for his\r\nperson: nor indeed would he marry them at all, till he obtained my\r\nliberty to discourse both with the men and women, and then he told them,\r\n'That in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the sense of the laws\r\nof society, they had lived in open adultery, which nothing new, but\r\ntheir consent to marry, or final separation, could put an end to; and\r\neven here was a difficulty with respect to the laws of Christian\r\nmatrimony, in marrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater,\r\nunbaptized; but yet there was time enough to make them profess the name\r\nof Christ, without which nothing could be done; that, besides, he\r\nbelieved themselves very indifferent Christians; and consequently had\r\nnot discoursed with their wives upon that subject; and that unless they\r\npromised him to do so, he could not marry them, as being expressly\r\nforbidden by the laws of God.'\r\n\r\nAll this they heard attentively, and owned readily.\r\n\r\n_But, Lord, Sir,_ said Will Atkins to me _how could we teach them\r\nreligion, who know nothing of it ourselves? How can we talk to our wives\r\nof God, Jesus Christ, heaven, and hell? Why they would only laugh at us,\r\nwho never yet have practiced religion, but on the contrary all manner of\r\nwickedness. Will Atkins,_ said I, _cannot you tell your wife she is in\r\nthe wrong, and that her gods are idols, which can neither speak nor\r\nunderstand; but that our God, who has made, can destroy all things; that\r\nhe rewards the good and punishes the wicked; and at last will bring us\r\nto judgment; cannot you tell her these things? That's true,_ said\r\nAtkins, _but then she'll tell me it is utterly false, since I am not\r\npunished and sent to the devil, who hath been such a wicked creature._\r\nThese words I interpreted to the priest. \"Oh!\" said he, \"tell him, his\r\nrepentance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and qualify\r\nhim to preach on the mercy and long suffering of a merciful Being, who\r\ndesires not the death of a sinner, and even defers damnation to the last\r\njudgment; this will lead him to the doctrine of the resurrection and\r\nwill make him an excellent preacher to his wife.\" I repeated this to\r\nAtkins, who being more than ordinary affected with it, replied, _I know\r\nall this, Sir, and a great deal more; but how can I have the impudence\r\nto talk thus to my wife, given my conscience witnesses against me?\r\nAlas!_ said he (with tears in his eye, and giving a great sigh) _as for\r\nrepenting, that is for ever past me. Past you! Atkins,_ said I, _what do\r\nyou mean? You know well enough,_ said he, _what I mean, I mean it is\r\ntoo late._\r\n\r\nWhen I told the priest what he said, the poor affectionate man could not\r\nrefrain from weeping; but recovering himself \"Pray, Sir,\" said he, \"ask\r\nhim if he is contented that it is too late; or is he concerned, and\r\nwishes it were not so?\" This question I put fairly to Atkins, who\r\nreplied in a passion, _How can I be easy in a state which I know must\r\nterminate in my ruin? for I really believe, some time or other, I shall\r\ncut my threat, to put a period both to my life, and to the terrors of my\r\nconscience._\r\n\r\nAt this, the clergyman shook his head, \"Sir,\" said he, \"pray tell him it\r\nis not too late; Christ will give him repentance, if he has recourse to\r\nthe merit of his passion. Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine\r\nmercy? There may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no longer\r\nstrive, but never too late for men to repent in this world.\" I told\r\nAtkins every word the priest had said, who then parted from us to walk\r\nwith his wife, while we discoursed with the rest. But these were very\r\nstupid in religious matters; yet all of them promised to do their\r\nendeavours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon which promises\r\nthe priest married the three couple. But as Atkins was the only sincere\r\nconvert and of more sense than the rest, my clergyman was earnestly\r\ninquiring after him: \"Sir,\" said he, \"let us walk out of this labyrinth,\r\n& I dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife already.\"\r\nAnd indeed we found it true; for coming to the edge of the wood, we\r\nperceived Atkins and his savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush,\r\nin very earnest discourse; he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the\r\nearth, to himself, to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately we\r\ncould perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and\r\nlift up both his hands; at which the tears ran down my clergyman's\r\ncheeks; but our great misfortune was, we could not hear one word that\r\npassed between them. Another time he would embrace her, wiping the tears\r\nfrom her eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both\r\nkneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of joy did this\r\nconfirm in my young priest, that he could scarcely contain himself: And\r\na little after this, we observed by her motion, as frequently lifting up\r\nher hands, and laying them on her breast, that she was mightily affected\r\nwith his discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight.\r\n\r\nWhen we came back, we found them both waiting to be called in; upon\r\nwhich he agreed to examine him alone, and so I began thus to discourse\r\nhim. \"Prithee, Will Atkins,\" said I, \"what education have you? What was\r\nyour father?\"\r\n\r\n_W.A._ A better man than ever I shall be; he was, Sir, a clergyman, who\r\ngave me good instruction, or correction, which I despised like a brute\r\nas I was, and murdered my poor father.\r\n\r\n_Pr._ Ha! a murderer!\r\n\r\n[_Here the priest started and looked pale, as thinking he had really\r\nkilled his father_.]\r\n\r\n_R.C._ What, did you kill him with your hands?\r\n\r\n_W.A._ No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke his heart by the most\r\nunnatural turn of disobedience to the tenderest and best of fathers.\r\n\r\n_R.C._ Well, I pray God grant you repentance: I did not ask you to\r\nexhort a confession; but I asked you because I see you have more\r\nknowledge of what is good than your companions.\r\n\r\n_W.A._ O Sir, whenever I look back upon my past life, conscience\r\nupbraids me with my father: the sins against our parents make the\r\ndeepest wounds, and their weight lies the heaviest upon the mind.\r\n\r\n_R.C._ You talk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly for me; I am not able\r\nto bear it.\r\n\r\n_W.A._ You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of it.\r\n\r\n_R.C._ But yes, Atkins, I do; and every shore, valley, and tree in this\r\nisland, witness the anguish of my soul for my undutifulness to my kind\r\nfather, whom I have murdered likewise; yet my repentance falls\r\ninfinitely short of yours. But, Will, how comes the sense of this matter\r\nto touch you just now?\r\n\r\n_W.A._ Sir, the work you have set me about, has occasioned it; for\r\ntalking to my wife about God and religion, she has preached me such a\r\nsermon, that I shall retain it in lasting remembrance.\r\n\r\n_R.C._ No, no, it is your own moving pious arguments to her, has made\r\nconscience fling them back upon you. But pray, Atkins, inform us what\r\npassed between you and your wife, and in what manner you did begin.\r\n\r\n_W.A._ I talked to her of the laws of marriage, the reason of such\r\ncompacts, whereby order and justice is maintained; without which men\r\nwould run from their wives and children, to the dissolution of families\r\nor inheritances.\r\n\r\n_R.C._ Well, and what did she say to all this?\r\n\r\n_W.A._ Sir, we began our discourse in the following manner, which I\r\nshall exactly repeat according to my mean capacity, if you think it\r\nworth you while to honour it with your attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The DIALOGUE between WILL ATKINS and his Wife in the wood._\r\n\r\n_Wife._ You tell me marriage God appoint, have you God in your country?\r\n\r\n_W.A._ Yes, child, God is in every nation.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ No; great old Benamuckee God is in my country, not yours.\r\n\r\n_A._ My dear, God is in heaven, which he made; he also made the earth,\r\nthe sea and all that is therein.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Why you no tell me much long ago?\r\n\r\n_A._ My dear I have been a wicked wretch, having a long time lived\r\nwithout the knowledge of God in the world.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ What, not know great God in own nation? No do good ting? No say\r\nO to him? that's strange!\r\n\r\n_A._ But, my dear, many live as if there was no God in heaven for all\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Why God suffer them? why makee not live well?\r\n\r\n_A._ It is our own faults, child.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ But if he is much great, can makee kill, why no makee kill when\r\nno serve him? No be good mans, no cry O to him?\r\n\r\n_A._ That's true, my dear, he may strike us dead, but his abundant mercy\r\nspareth us.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Did not you tell God thanked for that?\r\n\r\n_A._ No, I have neither thanked him for his mercy, nor feared him for\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Then me not believe your God be good, nor makee kill, when you\r\nmakee him angry.\r\n\r\n_A._ Alas! must my wicked life hinder you from believing in him?\r\n\r\n_Wife_. How can me tink your God lives there? _(pointing to heaven.)_\r\nSure he no ken what you do here.\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes, my dear, he hears us speak, sees what we do, and knows what we\r\neven think.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Where then makee power strong, when he hears you curse, swear de\r\ngreat damn?\r\n\r\n_A._ My dear, this shows indeed he is a God and not a man who has such\r\ntender mercy.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Mercy I what you call mercy?\r\n\r\n_A._ He pities and spares us: as he is our great Creator, so he is also\r\nour tender Father.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ So God never angry, never kill wicked, then he no good, no great\r\nmighty.\r\n\r\n_A._ O my dear, don't say so, he is both; and many times he shows\r\nterrible examples of his judgment and vengeance.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Then you makee de bargain with him; you do bad ting, he no hurt\r\nyou, he hurt other mans.\r\n\r\n_A._ No, indeed, my lips are all presumptions upon his goodness.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Well, and yet no makee you dead; and you give him no tankee\r\nneither?\r\n\r\n_A._ It is true, I an ungrateful, unthankful dog, that I am.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Why, you say, he makee you, why makee you no much better then?\r\n\r\n_A._ It is I alone that have deformed myself, and abused his goodness.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ Pray makee God know me, me no makee him angry, no do bad ting.\r\n\r\n_A._ You mean, my dear, that you desire I would teach you to know God:\r\nalas! poor dear creature, he must teach thee, and not I. But I'll pray\r\nearnestly to him to direct thee, and to forgive me, a miserable sinner.\r\n_(Hereupon he went a little distance, and kneeling down, prayed\r\nearnestly to God to enlighten her mind, and to pardon his sins; when\r\nthis was done, they continued their discourse thus.)_\r\n\r\n_Wife._ What you put down knee for? For what hold up hand? Who you speak\r\nto?\r\n\r\n_A._ My dear, I bowed in token of submission to him that made me, and\r\nprayed that he would open your eyes and understanding.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ And can he do that too? And will he hear what you say?\r\n\r\n_A._ Yes, my dear, he bids us pray, and has given us promise that he\r\nwill hear us.\r\n\r\n_Wife._ When did he bid you pray? What I do you hear him speak?\r\n\r\n_A._ No, my dear, but God has spoken formerly to good men from heaven;\r\nand by divine revelation they have written all his laws down in a book.\r\n\r\n_Wife_. O where dat good book?\r\n\r\n_A_. I have it not now by me; but one time or other I shall get it for\r\nyou to read. _Then he embraced her with great affection_.\r\n\r\n_Wife_. Pray tell a mee, did God, teachee them write that book?\r\n\r\n_A_. Yes, and by that rule we know him to be God.\r\n\r\n_Wife_. What way, what rule you know him?\r\n\r\n_A_. Because he teaches what is good, just, and holy; and forbids all\r\nwicked and abominable actions that incur his displeasure.\r\n\r\n_Wife_. O me fain understand that, and if he do all things you say he\r\ndo, surely he hear me say O to him; he makee me good if I wish to be\r\ngood, he no kill me if I love him; me tink, believe him great God; me\r\nsay O to him, along with you, my dear.\r\n\r\n_Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made her kneel down by him\r\npraying with the greatest fervency, that God would instruct her by his\r\nHoly Spirit; and that God by his providence would send them a Bible for\r\nboth their instructions. And such was the early piety of this new\r\nconvert, that she made him promise never to forsake God any more, lest\r\nbeing_ made dead, _as she called it; she should not only want her\r\ninstructor, but himself be miserable in a long eternity_.\r\n\r\nSuch a surprising account as this was, proved very affecting to us both,\r\nbut particularly to the young clergyman, who was mightily concerned he\r\ncould not talk to her himself. \"Sir,\" said he, \"there, is something more\r\nto be done to this woman then to marry her; I mean that she ought to be\r\nbaptized.\" To this, I presently agreed: \"Pray,\" said he, \"ask her\r\nhusband, whether he has ever talked to her of Jesus Christ, the\r\nsalvation of sinners, the nature of faith, and redemption in and by him,\r\nof the Holy Spirit, the resurection, last judgment, and a future state;\"\r\nbut the poor fellow melted into tears at this question, saying, that he\r\nhad said something to her of these things, but his inability to talk of\r\nthem, made him afraid, lest her knowledge of them should rather make her\r\ncontemn religion, than be benefited by it; but that if I would discourse\r\nwith her, it would be very evident my labour would not be in vain.\r\nAccordingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter between\r\nthe religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to go on; but surely\r\nnever was such a sermon preached by any clergyman in these latter days,\r\nwith so much zeal, knowledge, and sincerity; in short, he brought the\r\nwoman to embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by him, with\r\nso surprising a degree of understanding, that she made it her own\r\nrequest to be baptized.\r\n\r\nHe than performed his office in the sacrament of baptism, first, by\r\nsaying some words over to himself in Latin, and then asking me to give\r\nher a name, as being her godfather, and pouring a whole dish-full of\r\nwater upon the woman's head, he said, \"_Mary_, I baptize thee in the\r\nname of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;\" so that none\r\ncould know of what religion he was. After this he pronounced the\r\nbenediction in Latin. Thus the woman being made a Christian, he married\r\nher to Will Atkins; which being finished, he affectionately exhorted him\r\nto lead a holy life for the future; and since the Almighty, for the\r\nconvictions of his conscience, had honoured him to be the instrument or\r\nhis wife's conversion, he should not dishonor the grace of God, that\r\nwhile the savage was converted, the instrument should be cast away. Thus\r\nended a ceremony, to me the most pleasant and agreeable I ever passed\r\nin my life.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the island being settled, I was preparing to go on board,\r\nwhen the young man (whose mother was starved) came to me, saying, that\r\nas he understood I had a clergyman with me, who had married the\r\nEnglishmen with savages, he had a match to make between two Christians,\r\nwhich he desired might be finished before I departed. Thinking that it\r\nwas he himself that had courted his mother's maid, I persuaded him not\r\nto do any thing rashly upon the account of his solitary circumstances;\r\nthat the maid was an unequal match for him, both in respect to substance\r\nand years; and that it was very probable he would live to return to his\r\nown country, where he might have a far better choice. At these words,\r\nsmiling, he interrupted me, thanking me for my good-advice; that as he\r\nhad nothing to beg of me but a small settlement, with a servant or two,\r\nor some new necessaries, so he hoped I would not be unmindful of him\r\nwhen I returned to England, but give his letter to his friends; and that\r\nwhen he was redeemed, the plantation, and all its improvements, however\r\nvaluable, should be returned to me again. But as for the marriage he\r\nproposed, that it was not himself, but that it was between my\r\nJack-of-all-trades and the maid Susan.\r\n\r\nI was indeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this match, which\r\nseemed very suitable, the one being a very ingenious fellow, and the\r\nother an excellent, dexterous, and sensible housewife, fit to be\r\ngoverness of the whole island; so we married them the same day; and as I\r\nwas her father, and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome portion,\r\nappointing her and her husband a convenient large space of ground for\r\ntheir plantation. The sharing out of the land I left to Will Atkins, who\r\nreally divided if very justly, to every person's satisfaction; they only\r\ndesired one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused\r\nto be drawn up, signed, and sealed to them, setting out their bounds,\r\nand giving them a right to the whole possession of their respective\r\nplantations, with their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving\r\nall the rest of the island as my own property, and a certain rent for\r\nevery particular plantation, after eleven years. As to their laws and\r\ngovernment, I exhorted them to love one another; and as to the Indians\r\nwho lived in a nook by themselves, I allotted three or four of them\r\nplantations, and the rest willingly chose to become servants to the\r\nother families, by which means they were employed in useful labour, and\r\nfared much better than they did before. Besides the savages thus mixed\r\nwith the Christians, the work of their conversion might be set on foot\r\nby the latter, in the clergyman's absence, to our equal satisfaction.\r\nThe young priest, however, was a little anxious lest the Christians\r\nshould not be willing to do their parts in instructing these poor\r\nIndians; I therefore told him we should call them all together; that he\r\nshould speak to the Spaniards who were Papists, and I to the English,\r\nwho were Protestants, and make them promise that they would never make\r\nany distinction in religion, but teach the general true knowledge of\r\nGod, and his son Jesus Christ, in order to convert the poor savages. And\r\nthis, indeed, they all promised us accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to Will Atkins's house, I found his baptized wife, and the\r\nyoung woman newly married to my Jack-of-all-trades, were become great\r\nintimates, and discoursing of religion together. _O, Sir,_ says Will\r\nAtkins, _when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, he never wants an\r\ninstructor; I knew I was unworthy of so good a work, and therefore this\r\nyoung woman has been sent hither as it were from heaven, who is\r\nsufficient to convert a whole nation of savages_. The young woman\r\nblushed, and was going to rise; but I desired her to sit still, and\r\nhoped that God would bless her in so good a work; and then pulling out a\r\nBible (which I brought on purpose in my pocket for him.) _Here Atkins_,\r\nsaid I, _here is an assistant that perhaps you had not before_. So\r\nconfounded was the poor man, that is was some time before he could\r\nspeak; at last turning to his wife, _My dear_, he said, _did I not tell\r\nyou that God could hear what we said? Here's the book I prayed for, when\r\nyou and I kneeled under the bush: God then heard us, and now has sent\r\nit_. The woman was surprised, and thought really God had sent that\r\nindividual book from heaven; but I turned to the young woman, and\r\ndesired her to explain to the young convert, that God may properly be\r\nsaid to answer our petitions, when, in the course of his providence,\r\nsuch particular things came to pass as we petitioned for. This the young\r\nwoman did effectually; but surely Will Atkins's joy cannot be expressed;\r\nno man being more thankful for any thing in the world, than he was for\r\nhis Bible, nor desired it from a better principle.\r\n\r\nAfter several religious discourses, I desired the young woman to give me\r\nan account of the anguish she felt when she was starving to death with\r\nhunger; to which she readily consented, and began in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"all our victuals being gone, after I had fasted one\r\nday, my stomach was very sickly, and, at the approach, of night, I was\r\ninclined to yawning and sleepy. When I slept upon the couch three hours,\r\nI awaked a little refreshed: three hours after, my stomach being more\r\nand more sickly, I lay down again, but could not sleep, being very faint\r\nand ill. Thus I passed the second day with a strange variety, first\r\nhungry, then sick again, with reachings to vomit: that night I dreamed I\r\nwas at Barbadoes, buying plenty of provisions; and dined heartily. But\r\nwhen I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly sunk, to find myself in the\r\nextremity of famine. There was but one glass of wine, which being mixed\r\nwith sugar, I drank up; but for want of substance to digest upon, the\r\nfumes of it got into my head, & made me senseless for some time. The\r\nthird day I was so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten a\r\nlittle child if it had come in my way; during which time, I was as mad\r\nas any creature in Bedlam. In one of these fits I fell down, and struck\r\nmy face against the corner of a pallet bed, where my mistress lay; the\r\nblood gushed out of my nose, but by my excessive bleeding, both the\r\nviolence of the fever, and the ravenous part of the hunger abated. After\r\nthis, I grew sick again, strove to vomit, but could not; then bleeding a\r\nsecond time, I swooned away as dead; when I came to myself, I had a\r\ndreadful gnawing pain in my stomach, which went of towards night, with a\r\nlonging desire for food. I took a draught of water and sugar, but it\r\ncame up again; then I drank water without sugar, and that staid with me.\r\nI laid me down on the bed, praying God would take me away: after I had\r\nslumbered, I thought myself a-dying, therefore recommended my soul to\r\nGod, and wished somebody would throw me into the sea. All this while my\r\ndeparting mistress lay by me: the last bit of bread she had, she gave to\r\nher dear child my young master. The morning after, I fell into a violent\r\npassion of crying, and after that into hunger. I espied the blood that\r\ncame from my nose in a basin, which I immediately swallowed up. At night\r\nI had the usual variations, as the pain in the stomach, sick, sleepy,\r\nand ravenous: and I had no thought but that I should die before morning.\r\nIn the morning came on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time I\r\nheard my young master's lamentations, by which I understood his mother\r\nwas dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried, _A sail! A sail!_\r\nhallooing as if they were distracted for joy of that relief, which\r\nafterwards we received from your hands.\"\r\n\r\nSurely never was a more distinct account of starving to death than this.\r\nBut to return to the disposition of things among my people, I did not\r\ntake any notice to them of the sloop that I had framed, neither would I\r\nleave them the two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns\r\nthat I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they should have separated,\r\nor turned pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves, instead of\r\na plantation of sober pious people: but leaving them in a flourishing\r\ncondition, with a promise to send them further relief, from Brazil, as\r\nsheep, hogs, and cows (being obliged to kill the latter at sea, having\r\nno hay to feed them) I went on board the ship again, the first of May,\r\n1695, after having been twenty days among them: and next morning, giving\r\nthem a salute of five guns at parting, we set sail for the Brazils. The\r\nthird day, towards evening, there happening a calm, and the current\r\nbeing very strong, we were drove to the N.N.E. towards the land. Some\r\nhours after, we perceived the sea covered as it were with something very\r\nblack, not easily at first to be discovered: upon which our chief mate\r\nascending the shrouds a little way, and taking a view with a perspective\r\nglass, he cries out, _An army! An army! You fool_, said I, _what do you\r\nmean? Nay, Sir_, said he, _don't be angry. I assure you, it is not only\r\nan army, but a fleet, too, for I believe there are a thousand canoes\r\npaddling along, and making with great haste towards us_.\r\n\r\nIndeed every one of us were surprised at this relation; and my nephew\r\nthe captain could not tell what to think of it, but thought we should\r\nall be devoured. Nor was I free from concern, when I considered how much\r\nwe were becalmed, and what a strong current set towards the shore;\r\nhowever, I encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the ship to an\r\nanchor as soon as we were certain that we must engage them. Accordingly\r\nwe did so, and furled all our sails, as to the savages we feared\r\nnothing, but only that they might se the ship on fire; to prevent which,\r\nI ordered them to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close by the\r\nhead, and the other by the stern, well manned, with skeets and buckets\r\nto extinguish the flames, should it so happen. The savages soon came up\r\nwith us, but there were not so many as the mate had said, for instead of\r\na thousand canoes there were only one hundred and twenty; too many\r\nindeed for us, several of their canoes containing about sixteen or\r\nseventeen men.\r\n\r\nAs they approached us, they seemed to be in the greatest amazement, not\r\nknowing what to make of us. They rowed round the ship, which occasioned\r\nus to call to the men in the boats, not to suffer them to come near\r\nthem. Hereupon they beckoned to the savages to keep back, which they\r\naccordingly did; but at their retreat they let fly about fifty arrows\r\namong us, and very much wounded one of our men in the long-boat. I\r\ncalled to them not to fire upon any account, but handing them down some\r\ndeal boards, the carpenters made them a kind of fence to shield them\r\nfrom the arrows. In half an hour after they came so near astern of us,\r\nthat we had a perfect sight of them; then they rowed a little farther\r\nout, till they came directly along-side of us, and then approached so\r\nnear, that they could hear us speak; this made me order all our men to\r\nkeep close, and get their guns ready. In the mean time I ordered Friday\r\nto go out upon deck, and ask them in his language what they meant. No\r\nsooner did he do so, but six of the savages, who were in the foremost\r\ncanoes, stooping down, showed us their naked backsides, as much as to\r\nsay in English, _Kiss our_----: but Friday quickly knew what this meant,\r\nby immediately crying out they were going to shoot; unfortunately for\r\nhim, poor creature, who fell under the cloud of three hundred arrows, no\r\nless than seven piercing through his body, killing one of the best\r\nservants, and faithfullest of companions in all my solitudes and\r\nafflictions.\r\n\r\nSo enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the guns, which\r\nbefore were charged only with powder, to frighten them, I ordered to be\r\nloaded with small shot; nor did the gunners fail in their aim, but at\r\nthis broadside split and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes,\r\nwhich killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swimming, the others,\r\nfrightened out of their wits, little regarding their fellows drowning,\r\nscoured away as fast as they could. One poor wretch our people took up,\r\nswimming for his life, an hour after. He was very sullen at first, to\r\nthat he would neither eat nor speak; but I took a way to cure him, by\r\nordering them to throw him into the sea, which they did, and then he\r\ncame swimming back like a cork, calling in his tongue, as I suppose, to\r\nsave him. So we took him on board, but it was a long time before we\r\ncould make him speak or understand English; yet when we had taught him,\r\nhe told us, 'they were going with their kings to fight a great battle;'\r\nand when we asked him, what made them come up to us? he said, _to makee\r\nde great wonder look_; where it is to be noted, that those natives, and\r\nthose of Africa, always add to _e_'s at the end of English words, as\r\n_makee, takee_, and the like, from which it is very difficult thing to\r\nmake them break off.\r\n\r\nBeing now under sail, we took our last farewell of poor honest Friday,\r\nand interred him with all possible decency and solemnity, putting him in\r\na coffin, and committing him to the deep, at the same time cauling\r\neleven guns to be fired at him. Thus ended the life of one of the most\r\ngrateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate servants, that ever any man\r\nwas blessed with in the world.\r\n\r\nHaving now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve days time we made\r\nland in the latitude of five degrees south of the line. Four days we\r\nkept on S. by E. in sight of shore, when we made Cape St. Augustin, and\r\nin three days we came up to an anchor off the Bay of all Saints. I had\r\ngreat difficulty here to get leave to hold correspondence on shore; for\r\nneither the figure of my partner, my two merchant trustees, nor the fame\r\nof my wonderful preservation in the island, could procure me the favour,\r\ntill such time as the prior of the monastery of the Augustines (to\r\nwhom I had given 500 moidores) obtained leave from the Governor, for me\r\npersonally, with the Captain & one more, together with eight sailors, to\r\ncome on shore; upon this condition, that we should not land any goods\r\nout of the ship, nor carry any person away without licence; I found\r\nmeans, however, to get on shore three bales of English goods, such as\r\nfine broad cloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I brought as a present\r\nfor my partner, who had sent me on board a present of fresh provisions,\r\nwine and sweetmeats, worth about thirty moidores, including some\r\ntobacco, and three or four fine gold medals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Revenging the death of Friday.]\r\n\r\nHere I delivered my partner in goods to the value of 100£ sterling, and\r\nobliged him to fit up the sloop I bought for the use of my island, in\r\norder to send them refreshments; and so active was he in this matter,\r\nthat he had the vessel finished in a few days, to the master of which I\r\ngave particular instructions to find the place. I soon loaded him with a\r\nsmall cargo; and one of our sailors offered to settle there, upon my\r\nletter to the Spanish governor, if I would allot him tools and a\r\nplantation. This I willingly granted, and gave him the savage we had\r\ntaken prisoner to be his slave. All things being ready for the voyage,\r\nmy old partner told me there was an acquaintance of his, a Brazil\r\nplanter, who having fallen under the displeasure of the church, & in\r\nfear of the Inquisition which obliged him to be concealed, would be glad\r\nof such an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife & two\r\ndaughters; & if I would allot them a plantation in my island, he would\r\ngive them a small stock to begin with, for that the officers had already\r\nseized his effects and estate, and left him nothing but a little\r\nhousehold stuff and two slaves. This request I presently granted,\r\nconcealing him and his family on board our ship, till such time as the\r\nsloop (where all the effects were) was gone out of the bay, and then we\r\nput them on board, who carried some materials, and plants for planting\r\nsugar-canes, along with them. By this sloop, among other things, I sent\r\nmy subjects three milch cows and five calves, about 22 hogs, three sows\r\nbig with pig, two mares and a stone horse. I also engaged three Portugal\r\nwomen to go for sake of the Spaniards, which, with the persecuted man's\r\ntwo daughters, were sufficient, since the rest had wives of their own,\r\nthough in another country; all which cargo arrived safe, no doubt to\r\ntheir exceeding comfort, who, with this addition, were about sixty or\r\nseventy people, besides children.\r\n\r\nAt this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left me; for a ship\r\nbeing ready to set sail for Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither, but\r\nI assure you it was with the greatest reluctance I parted from a person,\r\nwhose virtue and piety merited the greatest esteem.\r\n\r\nFrom the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic Ocean to the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, having a tolerable good voyage, steering for the most part\r\nS.E. We were on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who\r\nwas to direct all the ship's motions after she arrived at the Cape, only\r\nbeing limited to a certain number of days, for stay, by charter party,\r\nat the several ports she was to go to. At the Cape we only took in fresh\r\nwater, and then sailed for the coast of Coromandel; we were there\r\ninformed, that a French man of war of 50 guns, and two large merchant\r\nships were sailed for the Indies, but we heard no more of them.\r\n\r\nIn our passage, we touched at the island of Madagascar, where, though\r\nthe inhabitants are naturally fierce and treacherous, & go constantly\r\narmed with bows & lances, yet for some time they treated us civily\r\nenough; and, in exchange for knives, scisors, and other trifles, they\r\nbrought us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took partly for present\r\nvictuals, and the remainder to salt for the ship's use.\r\n\r\nSo curious was I to view every corner of the world where I came to, that\r\nI went on shore as often as I could. One evening when on shore, we\r\nobserved numbers of the people stand gazing at us at a distance. We\r\nthought ourselves in no danger, as they had hitherto used us kindly.\r\nHowever, we cut three boughs cut of a tree, sticking them at a distance\r\nfrom us, which it seems, in that country, is not only a token of truce\r\nand amity, but when poles or boughs are set up on the other side, it is\r\na sign the truce is accepted. In these treaties, however, there is one\r\nprincipal thing to be regarded, that neither party come beyond one\r\nanother's three poles or boughs; so that the middle space is not only\r\nsecure, but is also allowed as a market for traffic and commerce. When\r\nthe truce is thus accepted, they stick up their javelins and lances at\r\nthe first poles, and come on unarmed; but if any violence is offered,\r\naway they run to their poles, take up their weapons, and then the truce\r\nis at an end. This evening it happened that a greater number of people\r\nthan usual, both men and women, traded among us for such toys as we had,\r\nwith such great civility, that we made us a little tent, of large boughs\r\nof trees, some of the men resolving to lie on shore all night; but, for\r\nmy part, I and some others took our lodging in the boat, with boughs of\r\ntrees spread over it, having a sail spread at the bottom to lie upon.\r\nAbout two o'clock in the morning we were awakened by the firing of\r\nmuskets, and our men crying out for help, or else they would all be\r\nmurdered. Scarce had we time to get the boat ashore, when our men came\r\nplunging themselves into the water, with about four hundred of the\r\nislanders at their heels. We took up seven of the men, three of them\r\nvery much wounded, and one left behind killed, while the enemy poured\r\ntheir arrows so thick among us, that we were forced to make a barricade,\r\nwith boards lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from danger:\r\nand, having got ready our fire-arms, we returned them a volley, which\r\nwounded several of them, as we could hear by their cries. In this\r\ncondition we lay till break of day, and then making signals of distress\r\nto the ship, which my nephew the captain heard and understood, he\r\nweighed anchor, & stood as near the shore as possible, and then sent\r\nanother boat with ten hands in her to assist us; but we called to them\r\nnot to come near, informing them of our unhappy condition. However they\r\nventured; when one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in one hand,\r\nand keeping our boat between him and our adversaries, swam to us, and\r\nslipping our cables, they towed us, out of reach of their arrows, and\r\nquickly after a broadside was given them from the ship, which made a\r\nmost dreadful havoc among them. When we got on board, we examined into\r\nthe occasion of this fray. The men who fled informed us that an old\r\nwoman who sold milk within the poles, had brought a young woman with\r\nher, who carried roots or herbs, the sight of whom so much tempted our\r\nmen, that they offered rudeness to the maid, at which the old woman set\r\nup a great cry: nor would the sailors part with the prize, but carried\r\nher among the trees, while the old woman went, and brought a whole army\r\ndown upon them. At the beginning of the attack, one of our men was\r\nkilled with a lance, and the fellow who began the mischief, paid dear\r\nenough for his mistress, though as yet we did not know what had become\r\nof him; the rest luckily escaped. The third night after the action,\r\nbeing curious to understand how affairs stood, I took the supercargo and\r\ntwenty stout fellows with me, and landed about two hours before\r\nmidnight, at the same place where those Indians stood the night before,\r\nand there we divided our men into two bodies, the boatswain commanding\r\none, and I another. It was so dark, that we could see nobody, neither\r\ndid we hear any voice near us: but by & bye the boatswain falling over a\r\ndead body, we agreed to halt till the moon should rise, which he knew\r\nwould be in an hour after. We perceived here no fewer than two and\r\nthirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead.\r\nSatisfied with this discovery I was for going on board again; but the\r\nboatswain and the rest told me, they would make a visit to the Indian\r\ntown, where these dogs (so they called them) resided, asking me at the\r\nsame time to go along with them; for they did not doubt, besides getting\r\na good booty, but they should find Tom Jeffery there, for that was the\r\nunhappy man we missed. But I utterly refused to go, and commanded them\r\nback, being unwilling to hazard their lives, as the safety of the ship\r\nwholly depended upon them. Notwithstanding all I could say to them, they\r\nall left me but one, and the supercargo; so we three returned to the\r\nboat, where a boy was left, resolving to stay till they returned. At\r\nparting I told them I supposed most of them would run the same fate with\r\nTom Jeffery. To this they replied, _Come boys, come along, we'll warrant\r\nwe'll come off safe enough_; and so away they went, notwithstanding all\r\nmy admonitions, either concerning their own safety or the preservation\r\nof the ship. Indeed they were gallantly armed, every man having a\r\nmusket, bayonet, and a pistol, besides cutlasses, hangers, pole-axes,\r\nand hand granades. They came to a few Indian houses at first, which not\r\nbeing the town they expected they went farther, & finding a cow tied to\r\na tree, they concluded that she would be a sufficient guide, and so it\r\nproved; for, after they untied her, she led them directly to the town,\r\nwhich consisted of above two hundred houses, several families living in\r\nsome of the huts together. At their arrival, all being in a profound\r\nsleep, the sailors agreed to divide themselves into three bodies, and\r\nset three parts of the town on fire at once, to kill those that were\r\nescaping, and plunder the rest of the houses. Thus desperately resolved,\r\nthey went to work; but the first party had not gone far, before they\r\ncalled out to the rest, that they had found Tom Jeffery; whereupon they\r\nall ran up to the place, and found the poor fellow indeed hanging up\r\nnaked by one arm, and his throat almost cut from ear to ear. In a house\r\nthat was hard by the tree, they found sixteen or seventeen Indians, who\r\nhad been concerned in the fray, two or three of them being wounded, were\r\nnot gone to sleep: this house they set on fire first, and in a few\r\nminutes after, five or six places more in the town appeared in flames.\r\nThe conflagration spread like wild-fire, their housing being all of\r\nwood, and covered with flags or rushes. The poor affrighted inhabitants\r\nendeavoured to run out to save their lives, but they were driven back\r\ninto the flames by the sailors, and killed without mercy. At the first\r\nhouse above mentioned, after the boatswain had slain two with his\r\npole-ax, he threw a hand-granade into the house, which bursting, made a\r\nterrible havoc, killing and wounding most of them; and their king and\r\nmost of his train, who were then in that house, fell victims to their\r\nfury, every creature of them being either smothered or burnt. All this\r\nwhile they never fired a gun, lest the people should awaken faster than\r\nthey could overpower them. But the fire awakened them fast enough, which\r\nobliged our fellows to keep together in bodies. By this time the whole\r\ntown was in a flame, yet their fury rather increased, calling out to one\r\nanother to remember Tom Jeffery. The terrible light of this\r\nconflagration made me very uneasy, and roused my nephew the captain, and\r\nthe rest of his men, who knew nothing of the matter. When he perceived\r\nthe dreadful smoke, and heard the guns go off, he readily concluded his\r\nmen were in danger; he therefore takes another boat, and comes ashore\r\nhimself, with thirteen men well armed. He was greatly surprised to see\r\nme and only two men in the boat, but more so when I told him the story:\r\nbut though I argued with him, as I did with the men, about the danger\r\nof the voyage, the interests of the merchants and owners, and the\r\nsafety of the ship, yet my nephew, like the rest, declared, that he\r\nwould rather lose the ship, his voyage, his life and all, than his men\r\nshould be lost for want of help; and so away he went. For my part,\r\nseeing him resolved to go, I had not power to stay behind. He ordered\r\nthe pinnace back again for twelve men more, and then we marched directly\r\nas the flame guided us. But surely never was such a scene of horror\r\nbeheld, or more dismal cries heard, except when Oliver Cromwell took\r\nDrogheda in Ireland, where he neither spared man, woman, nor child.\r\n\r\nThe first object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of one of their\r\nhabitations, before which lay four men and three woman killed, and two\r\nmore burnt to death among the fire, which was now decaying. Nothing\r\ncould appear more barbarous than this revenge; none more cruel than the\r\nauthors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and the cry proceeded\r\nin proportion. We had not gone much farther, when we beheld three naked\r\nwomen, followed by sixteen or seventeen men, flying with the greatest\r\nswiftness from our men, who shot one of them in our sight. When they\r\nperceived us, whom they supposed also their murderers, they set up a\r\nmost dreadful shriek, and both of them swooned away in the fright. This\r\nwas a sight which might have softened the hardest heart; and in pity we\r\ntook some ways to let them know we would not hurt them, while the poor\r\ncreatures with bended knees, and lifted up hands, made piteous\r\nlamentations to us to save their lives. I ordered our men not to hunt\r\nany of the poor creatures whatsoever; but being willing to understand\r\nthe occasion of all this, I went among these unhappy wretches, who\r\nneither understood me, nor the good I meant them. However being resolved\r\nto put an end to this barbarity, I ordered the men to follow me. We had\r\nnot gone fifty yards before we came up with the boatswain, with four of\r\nour men at his heels, all of them covered with blood and dust, and in\r\nsearch of more people to satiate their vengeance. As soon as we saw\r\nthem, we called out, and made them understand who we were; upon which\r\nthey came up to us, setting up a holloo of triumph, in token that more\r\nhelp was come. _Noble Captain_, said he to my nephew, _I'm glad your\r\ncome: we have not half done with these villainous hell-hound dogs;\r\nwee'll root out the very nation of them from the earth, and kill more\r\nthan poor Tom has hairs upon his head:_ and thus he went on till I\r\ninterrupted him.--\"Blood-thirsty dog,\" said I, \"will your cruelty never\r\nend? I charge you touch not one creature more; stop your hands and stand\r\nstill, or you're a dead man this moment.\" _Why Sir_, said he, _you\r\nneither know whom you are protecting, nor what they have done: but pray\r\ncome hither, and behold an instance of compassion, if such can merit\r\nyour clemency_; and with that he shewed me the poor fellow with his\r\nthroat cut, hanging upon the tree.\r\n\r\nIndeed, here was enough to fill their breasts with rage, which, however,\r\nI thought had gone too far, agreeable to these words of Jacob to his\r\nsons Simeon and Levi: _Cursed be their anger for it was fierce; and\r\ntheir wrath; for it was cruel._ But this sight made my nephew and the\r\nrest as bad as they: nay, my nephew declared, his concern was only for\r\nhis men; as for the people, not a soul of them ought to live. Upon this,\r\nthe boatswain and eight more directly turned about, and went to finish\r\nthe intended tragedy; which being out of my power to prevent, I returned\r\nback from the dismal sight, & the piteous cries of those unfortunate\r\ncreatures, who were made victims to their fury. Indeed, it was an\r\negregious piece of folly in me to return to the boat with but one\r\nattendant; and I had very near paid for it, having narrowly escaped\r\nforty armed Indians, who had been alarmed by the conflagration; but\r\nhaving passed the place where they stood, I got to the boat accompanied\r\nwith the supercargo, and so went on board, sending the pinnace back\r\nagain, to assist the men in what might happen. When I had got to the\r\nboat, the fire was almost extinguished, and the noise abated; but I had\r\nscarce been half an hour on board the ship, when I heard another volley\r\ngiven by our sailors, and a great smoke, which, as I afterwards found,\r\nwas our men falling upon those houses and persons that stood between\r\nthem and the sea; but here they spared the wives and children, and\r\nkilled only the men, to the number of about sixteen or seventeen. By the\r\ntime they got to the shore, the pinnace and the ship's boat were ready\r\nto receive them, and they all got safe on board, not a man of them\r\nhaving received the least hurt, except two, one of whom strained his\r\nfoot, and the other burnt his hand a little; for they met with no\r\nresistance, the poor Indians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded.\r\n\r\nI was extremely angry with every one of them, but particularly with the\r\ncaptain, who instead of cooling the rage of the men, had prompted them\r\non to further mischief: nor could he make me any other excuse, but that\r\nas he was a man, he could not master his passions at the sight of one of\r\nhis men so cruelly murdered. As for the rest, knowing they were not\r\nunder my command, they took no notice of any anger, but rather boasted\r\nof their revenge. According to all their accounts, they killed or\r\ndestroyed about 150 men, women, and children, besides burning the town\r\nto ashes. They took their companion Tom Jeffery from the tree, covered\r\nhim with some of the ruins, and so left him. But however this action of\r\nour men might seem to them justifiable, yet I always openly condemned it\r\nwith the appellation, of the Massacre of Madagascar. For tho' the\r\nnatives had slain this Jeffery, yet certainly he was the first\r\naggressor, by attempting to violate the chastity of a young innocent\r\nwoman, who ventured down to them, on the faith of the public\r\ncapitulation, which was so treacherously broken.\r\n\r\nWhile we were under sail, the boatswain would often defend this bloody\r\naction, by saying, that the Indians had broke the truce the night\r\nbefore, by shooting one of our men without just provocation: and what if\r\nthe poor fellow had taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not\r\nto have been murdered in so villainous a manner: and that they had acted\r\nnothing but what the divine laws commissioned to be done to such\r\nhomicides. However I was in the same mind as before, telling them that\r\nthey were murderers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blast\r\ntheir voyage, for such an unparalleled piece of barbarity.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the Gulph of Persia, five of our men, who ventured on\r\nshore, were either killed or made slaves by the Arabians, the rest of\r\nthem having scarce time to escape to their boat. This made me upbraid\r\nthem afresh with the just retribution of Heaven for such actions; upon\r\nwhich the boatswain very warmly asked me, _Whether those men on whom the\r\ntower of Siloam fell, were greater sinners than the rest of the\r\nGalileans? and besides, Sir_, said he, _none of these five poor men that\r\nare lost, were with us at the Massacre of Madagascar, as you call it,\r\nand therefore your representation is very unjust, and your application\r\nimproper. Besides_, added he, _you are continually using the men very\r\nill upon this account, and, being but a passenger yourself, we are not\r\nobliged to bear it; nor can we tell what evil designs you may have to\r\nbring us to judgment for it in England: and, therefore, if you do not\r\nleave this discourse, as also not concern yourself with any of our\r\naffairs, I will leave the ship, and not sail among such\r\ndangerous company._\r\n\r\nAll this I heard very patiently; but, it being often repeated, I at\r\nlength told him, the concern I had on board was none of his business;\r\nthat I was a considerable owner in the ship, and therefore had a right\r\nto speak in common, and that I was no way accountable to him, nor to any\r\nbody else. As no more passed for some time after, I thought all had been\r\nover. At this time we were in the road of Bengal, where, going on shore\r\nwith the supercargo one day, in the evening, as I was preparing to go on\r\nboard, one of the men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble myself\r\nto come to the boat, for that the cockswain and others had ordered him\r\nnot to carry me on board any more. This insulent message much surprised\r\nme; yet I gave him no answer to it, but went directly and acquainted the\r\nsupercargo, entreating him to go on board, and, by acquainting the\r\nCaptain with it, prevent the mutiny which I perceived would happen. But\r\nbefore I had spoken this, the matter was effected on board; for no\r\nsooner was he gone off in the boat, but the boatswain, gunner,\r\ncarpenter, and all the inferior officers, came to the quarter-deck,\r\ndesiring to speak with the Captain; & there the boatswain made a long\r\nharangue, exclaiming against me, as before mentioned, that, if I had not\r\ngone on shore peaceably, for my own diversion, they, by violence would\r\nhave compelled me, for their satisfaction: that as they had shipped with\r\nthe Captain, so they would faithfully serve him; but if I did not quit\r\nthe ship, or the Captain oblige me to it, they would leave the ship\r\nimmediately: hereupon, turning his face about by way of signal, they all\r\ncried out, \"ONE and ALL! ONE and ALL!\"\r\n\r\nYou may be sure, that though my nephew was a man of great courage, yet\r\nhe could not but be surprised at their sudden and unexpected behaviour;\r\nand though he talked stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with\r\nthem, that in common justice to me, who was a considerable owner in the\r\nship, they could not turn me as it were out of mine own house, which\r\nmight bring their lives in danger should they ever be taken in England;\r\nnay, though he invited the boatswain on shore to accomodate matters with\r\nme, yet all this I say, signified nothing; they would have nothing to do\r\nwith me; and they were resolved to go on shore if I came on board.\r\n_Well,_ said my nephew, _if you are so resolved, permit me to talk with\r\nhim, and then I have done; and so he came to me, giving me an account of\r\ntheir resolution, how one and all designed to forsake the ship when I\r\ncame on board, for which he was mightily concerned._ \"I am glad to see\r\nyou, nephew,\" said I, \"and rejoice it is no worse, since they have not\r\nrebelled against you; I only desire you to send my necessary things on\r\nshore, with a sufficient sum of money, and I will find my way to England\r\nas well as I can.\" Though this grieved my nephew to the heart, yet there\r\nwas no remedy but complience; in short, all my necessaries were sent me,\r\nand so this matter was over in a few hours.\r\n\r\nI think I was now near a thousand leagues farther off England by sea,\r\nthan at my little kingdom, except this difference, that I might travel\r\nby land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, from thence to Baffora,\r\nby sea up the Persian Gulph, then take the way of the caravans over the\r\nArabian desert to Alleppo and Scanderoon, there take shipping to Italy,\r\nand so travel by land into France, and from thence cross the sea\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nMy nephew left me two persons to attend me; one of them was his servant,\r\nand the other clerk to the purser, who engaged to be mine. I took\r\nlodging in an English woman's house, where several French, one English,\r\nand two Italian merchants resided. The handsome entertainment I met with\r\nhere, occasioned me to stay nine months, considering what course I\r\nshould take. Some English goods I had with me of great value, besides a\r\nthousand pieces of eight, and a letter for more, if there was such\r\nnecessity. The goods I soon disposed of to advantage, and bought here\r\nseveral good diamonds, which I could easily carry about with me. One\r\nmorning the English merchant came to me, as being very intimate\r\ntogether, _countryman_, said he, _I have a project to communicate to\r\nyou, which I hope will suit to both our advantage. To be short, Sir, we\r\nare both in a remote part of the world from our country; but yet in a\r\nplace where men of business may get a great deal of money. Now, if you\r\nwill put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire a ship to\r\nour satisfaction; you shall be Captain, I will be merchant: and we'll go\r\na trading voyage to China, for why should we lie still like drones,\r\nwhile the whole world is in a continual motion_.\r\n\r\nThis proposal soon got my consent, being very agreeable to my rambling\r\ngenius; and the more so, because I looked upon my countryman to be a\r\nvery sincere person; it required some time before we could get a vessel\r\nto our mind, and sailors to man it accordingly; at length we bought a\r\nship, and got an English mate, boatswain, and gunner, a Dutch carpenter,\r\nand three Portuguese foremast men; and, for want of others, made shift\r\nwith Indian seamen. We first sailed to Achin, in the island of Sumatra,\r\nand then to Siam, where we bartered our wares for some arrack and opium,\r\nthe last of which bore a great price among the Chinese; in a word, we\r\nwent up to Suskan, making a very great voyage; &, after eight months\r\ntime, I returned to Bengal, very well satisfied with this adventure,\r\nhaving not only got a sufficient quantity of money, but an insight of\r\ngetting a great deal more.\r\n\r\nThe next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go among the spice\r\nislands, and bring home a load of cloves from the Manillas, or\r\nthereabouts; islands belonging partly to Spain, but where the Dutch\r\ntrade very considerably. We were not long in preparing for this voyage,\r\nwhich we made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo, and\r\nseveral other places which I do not perfectly remember, and returning\r\nhome in about five months time. We soon sold our spices, which were\r\nchiefly cloves and some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried\r\nthem away to the gulph; and, in short, making five to one advantage, we\r\nwere loaded with money.\r\n\r\nNot long after my friend and I had made up our accounts, to our entire\r\nsatisfaction, there came in a Dutch coaster from Batavia of about two\r\nhundred tons. The crew of this vessel pretended themselves so sickly,\r\nthat there were not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage; and the\r\nCaptain having given out that he intended to go to Europe, public notice\r\nwas given that the ship was to be sold. No sooner did this come to our\r\nears, but we bought the ship, paid the master, and took possession. We\r\nwould also have very willingly entertained some of the men; but they\r\nhaving received their share of booty, were not to be found, being\r\naltogether fled to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence; and\r\nfrom thence went to travel to Surat, and so by the sea to the Persian\r\nGulph. And indeed they had reason to fly in this manner; for the truth\r\nof it was the pretended Captain was the gunner only, and not the\r\ncommander; that having been on a trading voyage, they were attacked on\r\nshore by the Malayans, who killed three men and the Captain; after whose\r\ndeath the other eleven men ran away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal,\r\nand left the mate and five men more on shore: but of this affair we\r\nshall have occasion to speak more at length hereafter.\r\n\r\nHowever they came by the ship, we thought we bought it honestly; neither\r\ndid we suspect any thing of the matter, when the man showed us a bill of\r\nsale for the ship (undoubtedly forged) to one Emanuel Clostershoven,\r\nwhich name he went by. And so without any more to do, we picked up some\r\nDutch and English seamen, resolving for another voyage for cloves among\r\nthe Phillippine and Molucca Islands: in short, we continued thus five or\r\nsix years, trading from port to port with extraordinary success. In the\r\nseventh year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing to touch at\r\nSiam, and buy some rice by the way. In this voyage, contrary winds beat\r\nus up and down for a considerable time among the islands in the Straits\r\nof Molucca. No sooner were we clear of those rugged seas, but we\r\nperceived our ship had sprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the\r\nriver Cambodia, which lies northward of the Gulph, and goes up to Siam.\r\n\r\nOne day, as I was on shore refreshing myself, there comes to me an\r\nEnglishman, who was gunner's mate on board an English East India ship,\r\nriding up the river near the city of Cambodia. _Sir_, said he, _you may\r\nwonder at my business, having never seen me in your life; but tho' I am\r\na stranger, I have something to tell you that very nearly concerns you:\r\n& indeed it is the imminent danger you are in has moved me to give you\r\nthis timely notice_. \"Danger!\" said I, \"what danger? I know of none,\r\nexcept my ship being leaky, for which I design to have her run aground\r\nto-morrow morning\" _I hope you will be better employed when you shall\r\nhear what I have to say to you. You know the town of Cambodia is about\r\nfifteen leagues up this river; about three leagues on this side of it,\r\nthere lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would you venture here\r\nwithout considering what strength you have to engage them_? I knew not\r\nwhat he meant by this discourse, and turning short upon him, \"Sir,\" said\r\nI, \"I know no reason I have to be afraid either of any Dutch or English\r\nships. I am no interloper, and what business have they with me?\" _Well,\r\nSir,_ said the man, _if you do think yourselves secure, all as I can\r\nsay, you must take your chance; however, I am very sorry you are so deaf\r\nto good advice; but I assure you; if you do not put to sea immediately,\r\nyou will be attacked by five long-boats full of men, hanged yourself for\r\na pirate, if you are taken, and the particulars examined afterwards. I\r\nthought, Sir_, added he, _I might have met a better reception for such a\r\nsingular piece of service_. \"Sir,\" said I, \"I was never ungrateful to\r\nany man; but pray explain yourself and I'll go on board this minute,\r\nwhether the leak be stopped or no.\" _Why, Sir,_ said he, _to be short,\r\nbecause time is precious, the matter is this: You know well enough that\r\nyou was with the ship at Sumatra, when your Captain was murdered by the\r\nMalayans, with three of his sailors; and that either you, or some who\r\nwere on board you, ran away with the ship, and are since turned pirates\r\nat sea. Now, Sir, this is the sum of what I had to say: and I can\r\npositively assure you, that if you are taken, you will be executed\r\nwithout much ceremony, for undoubtedly you cannot but be sensible what\r\nlittle law merchant ships show to pirates, whenever they fall into\r\ntheir hands_.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,' said I, 'I thank you for your kind information; and though I am\r\nsure no man could come more honestly by the ship than I have done, yet\r\nknowing their enterprize, and being satisfied of your honest intention,\r\nI'll be upon my defence. _Pr'ythee, Sir,_ said the man, _don't talk of\r\nbeing upon your defence, the best that you can make is to be out of\r\ndanger; and therefore, if you have any regard for your life, & the lives\r\nof your men, take the advantage, without fail, of putting out to sea at\r\nhigh-water: by which means, as you have a whole tide before you, you\r\nwill be gone too far out of their reach before they can come down._\r\n\r\n\"I am mighty well satisfied,\" said I, \"in this particular, and for your\r\nkindness, which merits my great esteem; pray, Sir, what amends shall I\r\nmake you?\" He replied, \"I know not what amends you are willing to make,\r\nbecause you may have some doubts of its certainty: but, to convince you\r\nof the truth of what I say, I have one offer to make to you. On board\r\none of the English ships, I have nineteen months pay due to me, and this\r\nDutchman that is with me has seven months pay due to him, which if you\r\nwill make good to us, we will go along with you. If you shall find that\r\nthere is nothing in what we have said, then we shall desire nothing; but\r\nwhen you are convinced that we have saved the ship, your life, and the\r\nlives of the men, we will leave the whole to your generosity.\"\r\n\r\nSo reasonable did this every way appear, that I immediately consented,\r\nand we went directly on board. As soon as we came on board, my partner\r\ncalls joyfully out, _That they had stopped the leak?_ \"Well, thank God,\"\r\nsaid I, \"but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith.\"--_Weigh,_ said he,\r\n_what is the meaning of this hurry_? \"Pray ask no questions,\" said I,\r\n\"but all hands to work, without losing a moment's time.\" Upon which, in\r\ngreat surprise, the Captain was called, who immediately ordered the\r\nanchor to be got up; and though the tide was not quite down, yet being\r\nassisted with a little land breeze, we stood to sea. I then called my\r\npartner into the cabin, and related the story at large, which was\r\nconfirmed and more amplified by the two men I had brought on board.\r\nScarce had we finished our discourse upon this head, but a sailor came\r\nto the cabin door, with a message from the Captain, that we were chased\r\nby five sloops full of armed men. \"Very well,\" said I, \"it is plain now\r\nthere is something in it.\" And so, going upon deck, I told all the men\r\nthere was a design for seizing the ship, and of executing us for\r\npirates; and asked them whether they would faithfully stand by us, and\r\nby one another? To which they unanimously replied, \"That they would\r\nfight to their last drop of blood.\" I then asked the Captain, which way\r\nhe thought best for us to manage the battle? _Sir_, said he, _the only\r\nmethod is to keep them off with our great shot as long as we are able,\r\nand then have recourse to our small arms: and when both these fail us,\r\nthen retire to close quarters, when perhaps the enemy wanting materials,\r\ncan neither break open our bulk heads, nor get in upon us_. Meantime,\r\nthe gunner was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of the\r\nsteerage, and so load them with musket-bullets and small pieces of old\r\niron; and the deck being cleared, we prepared for the engagement, still,\r\nhowever, keeping out at sea. The boats followed us, with all the sail\r\nthey could make, and we could perceive the two foremost were English,\r\nwhich out-sailed the rest by two leagues, and which we found would come\r\nup with us: hereupon, we fired a gun without a ball, intimating that\r\nthey should bring to, and we put out a flag of truce, as a signal for\r\nparley; but finding them crowding after us, till they came within shot,\r\nwe took in our white, and hanging out the red flap, immediately fired at\r\nthem with ball: we then called to them with a speaking trumpet, bidding\r\nthem at their peril keep off.\r\n\r\nBut all this signified nothing; for depending upon the strength that\r\nfollowed them, they were resolutely bent for mischief: hereupon I\r\nordered them to bring the ship to, by which means, they lying upon our\r\nbroadside, we let fly at them at once, one of whom carried away the\r\nstern of the hindermost boat, and obliged them not only to take down\r\ntheir sail, but made them all run to the head of the boat, to keep them\r\nfrom sinking, and so she lay by, having enough of it. In the meantime,\r\nwe prepared to welcome the foremost boat in the same manner. While we\r\nwere doing this, one of the three hindermost boats came up to the relief\r\nof that which was disabled, and took the men out of her. We again\r\ncalled to parley with them; but, instead of an answer, one of the boats\r\ncame close under our stern; whereupon our gunner let fly his two chase\r\nguns, but missing, the men in the boat shouted, and, waving their caps,\r\ncame on with greater fury. To repair this seeming disgrace, the gunner\r\nsoon got ready, and firing a second time, did a great deal of mischief\r\namong the enemy. We waved again, and, bringing our quarter to bear upon\r\nthem, fired three guns more, when we found the boat a sinking, and\r\nseveral men already in the sea; hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave\r\norders to save as many as they could, and instantly to come on board,\r\nbecause the rest of their boats were approaching: accordingly they did\r\nso, and took up three of them, one of whom was almost past recovery; and\r\nthen crowding all the sail we could, after our men came on board, we\r\nstood out farther to sea, so that the other three boats gave over the\r\nchase, when they came up to the first two. Thus delivered from imminent\r\ndanger, we changed our course to the eastward, quite out of the course\r\nof all European ships.\r\n\r\nBeing now at sea, and inquiring more particularly of the two seamen, the\r\nmeaning of all this, the Dutchman at once let us into the secret. He\r\ntold us, that the fellow who sold us the ship was an errant thief, who\r\nhad run away with her; that the Captain was treacherously murdered on\r\nthe coast of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men; that\r\nhe, the Dutchman, and four more, being obliged to have recourse to the\r\nwoods for their safety, at length escaped by means of a Dutch ship in\r\nits way to China, which had sent their boat on shore for fresh water:\r\nThat, after this, he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen belonging\r\nto the ship (who had deserted the rest in their travels) arrived, and\r\nthere gave an account that the fellow who ran away with the ship had\r\nsold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who went a cruising, and had\r\nalready taken one English and two Dutch ship, richly laden.\r\n\r\nNow, tho' this was absolutely false, my partner truly said, that our\r\ndeliverance was to be esteemed so much the more, by reason, had we\r\nfallen into their hands, we could have expected nothing from them but\r\nimmediate death, considering our accusers would have been our judges;\r\nand, therefore, his opinion was to return directly to Bengal, where,\r\nbeing known, we could prove how honestly we came by the ship, of whom we\r\nbought her, and the like, and where we were sure of some justice; at\r\nleast would not be hanged first, and judged afterwards. I was at first\r\nof my partner's opinion, but when I had more seriously considered of the\r\nmatter, I told him, we ran a great hazard in attempting to return, being\r\non the wrong side of the Straits of Molucca and that, if, upon alarm\r\ngiven, we should be taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English elsewhere,\r\nour turning away would be a sufficient evidence to condemn us. This\r\ndanger indeed startled not only my partner, but likewise all the ship's\r\ncompany; so we changed our former resolution, and resolved to go to the\r\ncoast of Tonquin, and so to that of China, where, pursuing our first\r\ndesign as to trade, we might likewise have an opportunity to dispose of\r\nthe ship some way or other, and to return to Bengal in any country\r\nvessel we could procure. This being agreed to, we steered away N.N.E.\r\nabout 50 leagues off the usual course to the east; which put us to some\r\ninconveniences. As the wind blew steadily against us, our voyage became\r\nmore tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provision; and what\r\nwas still worse, we apprehended, that as those ships from whose boat we\r\nhad escaped, were bound to China, they might get before us, and have\r\ngiven fresh information, which might create another vigorous pursuit.\r\nIndeed, I could not help being grieved, when I considered that I who had\r\nnever wronged or defrauded any person in my life, was now pursued like a\r\ncommon thief, and if taken to run the greatest danger of being executed\r\nas such; and, though innocent, I found myself under the necessity of\r\nflying for my safety; and thereby escape being brought to shame, of\r\nwhich I was even more afraid than death itself. It was easy to read my\r\ndejection in my countenance. My mind was oppressed, like those unhappy\r\ninnocent persons, who being overpowered by blasphemous and perjured\r\nevidences, wickedly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin their\r\nreputation, have no other recourse in this world to ease their sorrow,\r\nbut sighs, prayers, and tears. My partner seeing me so concerned,\r\nencouraged me as well as he could; and, after describing to me the\r\nseveral ports of that coast, he told me, he would either put me in on\r\nthe coast of Cochinchina, or else in the bay of Tonquin, from whence we\r\nmight go to Macao, a town once possessed by the Portuguese, and where\r\nstill many European families resided.\r\n\r\nTo this place we steered, and, early next morning, came in sight of the\r\ncoast; but thought it advisable to put into a small river where we\r\ncould, either over land, or by the ship's pinnace, know what vessels\r\nwere in any ports thereabouts. This happy step proved our deliverance;\r\nfor, next morning, there came to the bay of Tonquin two Dutch ships, and\r\na third without any colours; and in the evening, two English ships\r\nsteered the same course. The river where we were was but small, and ran\r\nbut a few leagues up the country northward; the country was wild and\r\nbarbarous, and the people thieves, having no correspondence with any\r\nother nation; dealing only in fish, oil, and such gross commodities: and\r\none barbarous custom they still retained, that when any vessel was\r\nunhappily shipwrecked upon their coast, they make the men prisoners or\r\nslaves, so that now we might fairly say we were surrounded by enemies\r\nboth by sea and land.\r\n\r\nAs the ship had been leaky, we took the opportunity, in this place to\r\nsearch her, and to stop up the places which let in the water. We\r\naccordingly lightened her, and bringing our guns and other moveable\r\nthings to one side, we essayed to bring her down, that we might come to\r\nher bottom: but, upon second consideration, we did not think it safe to\r\nlet her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the place convenient for\r\nit. The inhabitants not used to such a sight as to see a ship lie down\r\non one side; and heel in towards the shore, and not perceiving her men,\r\nwho were at work on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off side,\r\npresently imagined the ship had been cast away, and lay fast on the\r\nground. Agreeable to this supposition, they surrounded us with ten or\r\ntwelve large boats, with a resolution, undoubtedly to plunder the ship,\r\nand to carry away those they found alive for slaves to their king. But\r\nwhen they perceived our men hard at work on the ship's bottom and side,\r\nwashing, graving, and stopping her, it filled them all with such\r\nsurprise, that they stood gazing as though they were confounded. Nor\r\ncould we imagine what their design was; however, for fear of danger, we\r\nhanded down arms and ammunition to those at work, in order to defend\r\nthemselves; and, indeed, this precaution was absolutely necessary; for,\r\nin a quarter of an hour after, the natives, concluding it was really a\r\nshipwreck, and that we were saving our lives and goods, which they\r\nthought belonged to them, came down upon our men as though it had been\r\nin line of battle. We lay at present but in a very unfit posture to\r\nfight; and before the stages could be got down, or the men in the boat\r\ncome on board as they were ordered, the Cochinchinese were upon them,\r\nand two of their boats boarding our long boat, they began to lay hold of\r\nour men as prisoners. The first they seized was a stout English sailor,\r\nwho never fired his musket, like a fool, as I imagined, but laid it down\r\nin the boat: but he knew what he was doing; for, by main force, he\r\ndragged the Pagan out of the boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked\r\nhis brains out against the boat's gunnel; a Dutchman that was next him,\r\nsnatched up the musket, and knocked down five more with the but-end of\r\nit; however, this was doing very little to their number; but a strange\r\nunexpected accident, which rather merits laughter than any thing else,\r\ngave our men a complete victory over them.\r\n\r\nIt seems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave the outside of the\r\nship, as well as to pay the seams, where he caulked to stop the leaks,\r\nhad gotten two kettles just let down in the boat, one filled with\r\nboiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuffs as\r\nthe shipwrights use; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle with\r\nwhich he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff, & as two of the\r\nenemies entered the boat where the fellow stood, he saluted them with a\r\nfull ladle of the hot boiling liquor; which, the poor creatures being\r\nhalf naked, made them roar out, and jump into the sea. _Well done,\r\nJack_, says the carpenter, _give them the other dose_: and so stepping\r\nforward himself, takes a mop, and dipping it into the pitch-pot, he and\r\nhis man so plentifully flung it among them, as that none escaped being\r\nscalded; upon which they all made the best of their way, crying and\r\nhowling in such a frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never\r\nheard the like. And, indeed, never was I better pleased with any\r\nconquest than I was with this, there being so little bloodshed, and\r\nhaving an aversion to killing such savage wretches, (more than was\r\nnecessary) as knowing they came on errands, which their laws and customs\r\nmade them think were just and equitable. By this time, all things being\r\nin order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake, so they did\r\nnot venture a second attack. Thus ended our merry fight; and, having got\r\nrice, bread, roots, and sixteen good hogs on board the day before we set\r\nsail, not daring to go into the bay of Tonquin, but steering N.E. toward\r\nthe isle of Formosa, or as tho' we would go to the Manillas, or\r\nPhillippine islands, for fear of meeting with any European ships; when\r\nwe anchored at the isle of Formosa, the inhabitants not only courteously\r\nsupplied us with provisions and fresh water, but dealt very fairly and\r\nhonestly with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place we\r\nsteered north, keeping still off the coast of China, till we were beyond\r\nall its ports where European ships usually come; and, at length, being\r\ncome to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved to put into the\r\nfirst trading port we should come at; and standing for the shore, a boat\r\ncame off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who\r\noffered his service; we very gladly accepted him, and sent the boat back\r\nagain. And now, having the man on board, I talked to him of going to\r\nNanquin, the most northward part of the coast of China. _What will you\r\ndo there_? said he, smiling. I told him that we would sell our cargo,\r\nand purchase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea, &c. and so return the\r\nsame way back. _O_, said he, _you had better put in at Macao, where you\r\nmay buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin, and sell your opium at a\r\ngreater advance_. \"But' said I 'we are gentlemen as well as merchants,\r\nand design to see the great city of Pekin, and the magnificent court of\r\nthe monarch of China,\" _Why then_, said he, _you should go to Ningpo,\r\nwhere is a navigable river that goes through the heart of that vast\r\nempire, two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea, which crosses all\r\nthe rivers, passes considerable hills, by the help of the sluices and\r\ngates, and goes even up to the city of Pekin. You may go to Nanquin if\r\nyou please, and travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before\r\nbound that way_. At the name of a Dutch or English ship, I was struck\r\nwith confusion; they being as great a terror to me in this vessel, as an\r\nAlgerine man of war is to them in the Mediterranean. The old man finding\r\nme troubled, _Sir_, said he, _I hope the Dutch are not now at war with\r\nyour nation_. \"No,\" said I, \"but God knows what liberty they may take\r\nwhen out of the reach of the law.\" _Why_, says he _what occasion is\r\nthere for peaceable merchants to fear? For believe me, they never meddle\r\nwith any but PIRATES._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Carpenter and his man defeats the Cochinchinese.]\r\n\r\nAt the mentioning the word _pirates_, my countenance turned to that of\r\nscarlet; nor was it possible for me to conceal it from the old pilot;\r\nwho was taking notice of it, _Sir_, said he _take what course you\r\nplease, I'll do you all the service I can._ \"Seignior,\" said I, \"I am a\r\nlittle concerned at your mentioning pirates; I hope there are none such\r\nin these seas, because you see in what weak condition we are to defend\r\nourselves.\" _O, Sir_, said he, _if that's all, don't be concerned, I\r\ndon't remember one in these seas these fifteen years, except above a\r\nmonth ago one was seen in the bay of Siam, but he is gone to the\r\nsouthward; neither was she built for a privateer, but was run away with\r\nby a reprobate Captain, and some of his men, the right Captain having\r\nbeen murdered by the Malayans_.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" said I, (as though ignorant of what had happened) \"did they kill\r\nthe Captain?\" _No_, said he, _it is generally thought the Malayans\r\nmurdered him; but they justly deserve hanging. The rogues were lately\r\ndiscovered in the bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia, by some\r\nDutchmen who belonged to the ship, and had much ado to escape the five\r\nboats that pursued them, but they have solemnly sworn to give no quarter\r\nto the Captain or the seamen but hang them every one up at the yard-arm,\r\nwithout any formal business of bringing them to a court of judicature_.\r\n\r\nBeing sensible, that, having the old man on board, he was incapable of\r\ndoing me any mischief, \"Well, Seignior, (said I) it is for this very\r\nreason I would have you carry us up to Nanquin, where neither English\r\nnor Dutch ships come; and I must tell you, their Captains are a parcel\r\nof rash, proud, insolent rascals, that neither know what belongs to\r\njustice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God or nature\r\ndirect; fellows that would prove murderers to punish robbers, and take\r\nupon them to adjudge innocent men to death, without any proof to prove\r\nthem guilty, but perhaps I may live to call them to account for it, in a\r\nplace where they may be taught how justice is to be executed.\" And so I\r\ntold him all the story of buying the ship, and how we were saved by the\r\nmeans of two men; that the murder of the Captain by the Malayans, as\r\nalso the running away with the ship, I believed to be true; but that\r\nwe, who bought it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction to cover\r\ntheir cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they attacked us, & the\r\nblood of those men we killed in our own just defence, lay at their door,\r\nwho sent to attack us by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, (said the old man, amazed) you have taken the right course to\r\nsteer to the north, and, if I might advise you, I would have you sell\r\nyour ship in China, and buy or build another in that country; and I'll\r\nprocure people to buy the one and sell the other.\" \"Well, but, Seignior,\r\n(said I) if I sell the ship in this manner, I may bring some innocent\r\npersons into the same dangers I have gone through, perhaps worse, even\r\ndeath itself; whereby I should be as guilty of their murder as their\r\nvillainous executioners.\" \"That need not trouble you, (says the old man)\r\nI'll find a way to prevent that; for these commanders you talk of I know\r\nvery well, and will inform them rightly of the matter as you have\r\nrelated, and I am persuaded they will not only believe me, but act more\r\ncautiously for the future.\" \"And will you deliver one message from me to\r\nthem?\" \"Yes, (said he) if you will give it under your hand, that I may\r\nprove it is not of my own production,\" Hereupon I wrote a large account\r\nof their attacking me in their long-boat, the pretended reason and\r\nunjust design of it; that they had done what they might be ashamed of,\r\nand could not answer for at any tribunal in England. But this letter was\r\nwrit in vain. Providence ordered things another way. We sailed directly\r\nfor Nanquin, and in about thirteen day's sail, came to an anchor at the\r\nsouth-west point of the great gulf of that place, where we learned, that\r\ntwo Dutch ships were gone the length before us, and that we should\r\ncertainly fall into their hands. We were all at a great loss in this\r\nexigency, and would very gladly have been on shore almost any where; but\r\nour old pilot told me, that if I would sail to the southward about two\r\nand forty leagues, there was a little port called Quinchange, where no\r\nEuropean ships ever came, and where we might consider what was further\r\nto be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor the next day, calling only\r\ntwice on shore by the way to get fresh water. The country people very\r\ncourteously sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. After\r\nfive days sail we came to the port, and landed with unspeakable joy. We\r\nresolved to dispose of ourselves and effects in any other way possible,\r\nthan enter on board that ill-fated vessel more; for no state can be more\r\nmiserable than a continued fear, which is a life of death, a confounder\r\nof our understandings, that sets the imagination at work to form a\r\nthousand frightful things that may never happen. And we scarce slept one\r\nnight without dreaming of halters, yard-arms, or gibbets, of fighting,\r\nbeing taken, and being killed; nay, so violent were our apprehensions,\r\nthat we would bruise our hands and heads against the sides of the\r\ncabin, as though actually engaged. The story of the Dutch cruelty at\r\nAmboyns, often came into our thoughts when awake; and, for my part, I\r\nthought my condition very hard; that after so many difficulties and such\r\nsignal deliverances, I should be hanged in my old age, though innocent\r\nof any crime that deserved such punishment; but then religion would seem\r\nto represent to me, as though the voice of it had said; 'consider, O\r\nman! what sins you have been formerly guilty of; which now thou art\r\ncalled to an account for, to expiate with thy blood! And as to thy\r\ninnocence, what art thou more innocent than thy blessed Redeemer, Jesus\r\nChrist, who suffered for thy offences, and to whose providence you ought\r\nto submit, let what will happen?' After this, natural courage would\r\ninspire me to resist to the last drop of blood, and sooner die than\r\nsuffer myself to be taken by boorish, rascally Dutchmen, who had arts to\r\ntorment beyond death itself.\r\n\r\nBut now, thank kind Heaven, being ashore; our old pilot procured us a\r\nlodging and a warehouse for our goods; it was a little hut with a large\r\nwarehouse joining to it, all built with canes, and pallisadoed round\r\nwith large ones, to keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous\r\nin that country. The magistrates allowed us a little guard during the\r\nnight, and we employed a centinel with a kind of halbert for three pence\r\na day. The fair, or mart, we found, had been over for some time;\r\nhowever, there remained in the river four junks and two Japan ships, the\r\nmerchants of the latter being on shore. In the first place, our old\r\npilot brought us acquainted with the missionary Roman priests, who were\r\nconverting the people to Christianity: two of them were reserved, rigid,\r\nand austere, applying themselves to the work they came about with great\r\nearnestness, but the third, who was a Frenchman, called Father Simon,\r\nwas of a freer conversation, not seemingly so serious and grave, yet no\r\nworse Christian than the other two, one of whom was a Portuguese, and\r\nthe other a Genoese. Father Simon, it seems, was appointed to go to\r\nPekin, the royal seat of the Emperor of the Chinese; and he only waited\r\nfor another priest, who was ordered from Macao to accompany him. We\r\nnever met together, but he was prompting me to accompany him in that\r\njourney: _Sir_, said he, _I will show you the glorious things of this\r\nmighty empire, and a city, the city of Pekin, far exceeding London and\r\nParis, put them both together_. One day in particular, being at dinner\r\nwith him, I showed some inclination to go; which made him press the more\r\nupon me and my partner, to gain our perfect consent. _But, Father\r\nSimon_, said my partner, _what satisfaction can you have in our company,\r\nwhom you esteem as heretics, and consequently objects not worthy your\r\nregard? O_, said he, _you may be as good Catholics in time as those I\r\nhope to convert to our religion. And so_, said I, _we shall have you\r\npreaching to us all the way, instead of pleasing us with a description\r\nof the country. Sir_, said he, _however our religion may be villified by\r\nsome people, it is very certain it neither divests us of good manners or\r\nChristian charity; and as we are gentlemen, as such we may converse\r\ntogether, without making one another uneasy_.\r\n\r\nBut we shall leave him a while, to consider our ship and the merchandise\r\nwhich we had to dispose of. There was but very little trade in the place\r\nwhere we were; and I was once resolved to venture to sail to the river\r\nKilam, and so to the city of Nanquin; but Providence ordered it\r\notherwise, by our old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant to us, to see\r\nwhat goods we had. He immediately bought our opium, for which he gave us\r\na very good price in gold by weight, some wedges of which were about ten\r\nor eleven ounces. It came into my head that perhaps he might buy the\r\nship too; and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him. He said\r\nnothing then, but shrugged up his shoulders; yet in a few days after he\r\ncame accompanied by a missionary priest, who was his interpreter, with\r\nthis proposal, _That as he had bought a great quantity of our goods, he\r\nhad not money enough to purchase our ship; but if I pleased he would\r\nhire her, with all my men, to go to Japan, and from thence with another\r\nloading to the Philippine islands, the freight of both which he would\r\nvery willingly pay to us before; and at their return to Japan, would buy\r\nthe ship_. Upon this we asked the Captain and his men if they were\r\nwilling to go to Japan; to which they unanimously agreed. While this was\r\nin agitation, the young man my nephew left to attend me, told me, \"That\r\nas I did not care to accept his prospect of advantage he would manage it\r\nfor me as I pleased, and render me a faithful account of his success,\r\nwhich would be wholly mine.\" Indeed I was very unwilling to part with\r\nhim; but considering it might be for the young man's good, I discoursed\r\nwith my partner about it, who, of his own generosity, gave him his share\r\nof the vessel, so that I could do no otherwise than give him mine: but,\r\nhowever, we let him have but the proper half of it, and preserved a\r\npower, that when we met in England, if he had obtained success, he\r\nshould account to us for one half of the profit of the ship's freight\r\nand the other should be his own. Thus having taken a writing under his\r\nhand, away he sailed to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honestly by\r\nhim, got him a licence to come on shore, sent him loaded to the\r\nPhilippines with a Japanese supercargo, from whence he came back again\r\nloaded with European goods, cloves, and other spiceries. By this voyage\r\nhe cleared a considerable sum of money, which determined him not to sell\r\nhis ship, but to trade on his own account; so he returned to the\r\nManillas, where, getting acquaintance, he made his ship free, was hired\r\nby the governor privately to go to Acapulco in America, on the Mexican\r\ncoast, with a licence to travel to the great city of Mexico. This\r\ntraffic turned out greatly to account, and my friend finding means to\r\nget to Jamaica, returned nine years after exceedingly rich into England.\r\n\r\nIn parting with the ship, it comes in course to consider of those men\r\nwho had saved our lives when in the river of Cambodia; and though, by\r\nthe way, they were a couple of rogues, who thought to turn pirates\r\nthemselves, yet we paid them what they had before demanded, and gave\r\neach of them a small sum of money, making the Englishman a gunner, and\r\nthe Dutchman a boatswain, with which they were very well contented.\r\n\r\nWe were now about 1000 leagues farther from home, than when at Bengal.\r\nAll the comfort we could expect was, that there being another fair to be\r\nkept in a month's time, we might not only purchase all sorts of that\r\ncountry's manufactures, but very possibly find some Chinese junks, or\r\nvessels from Tonquin, to be sold, which would carry us and our goods\r\nwheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes, we resolved to continue; and,\r\nto divert ourselves, we took several little journies in the country.\r\nAbout ten days after we parted with the ship, we travelled to see the\r\ncity of Nanquin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees north of the line:\r\nit is regularly built, and the streets are exactly straight, and cross\r\none another in direct lines, which sets it out to the greatest\r\nadvantage. At our return, we found the priest was come from Macao, that\r\nwas to accompany Father Simon to Pekin. That Father earnestly solicited\r\nme to accompany him, & I referred him to my partner. In short, we both\r\nagreed, and prepared accordingly; and we were so lucky as to have\r\nliberty to travel among the retinue of one of their Mandarines, who is a\r\nprincipal magistrate, and much reverenced by the people.\r\n\r\nWe were five and twenty days travelling thro' this miserable country,\r\ninfinitely populous, but as indifferently cultivated; and yet their\r\npride is infinitely greater than their poverty, insomuch that they\r\npriests themselves derided them. As we passed by the house of one of\r\ntheir country gentlemen, two leagues off Nanquin, we had the honour,\r\nforsooth, to ride with the Chinese squire about two miles. Never was Don\r\nQuixote so exactly imitated! Never such a compound of pomp and poverty\r\nseen before!\r\n\r\nHis habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy, and very proper for a\r\nMersy Andrew or Scaramouch, with all its tawdry trappings, as hanging\r\nsleeves, tassels, &c. though torn and rent in almost every part; his\r\nvest underneath it was no less dirty, but more greatly; resembling the\r\nmost exquisite sloven or greasy butcher; his horse (worse than\r\nRosinante, or the famous steed of doughty Hudibras) was a poor starved\r\ndecrepid thing, that would not sell for thirty shillings in England;\r\nand yet this piece of worshipful pomp was attended with ten or twelve\r\nslaves who guarded their master to his country seat. We stopped at a\r\nlittle village for refreshment; and when we came by the country seat of\r\nthis great man, we found him sitting under a tree before his door,\r\neating a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in the\r\nmiddle, and a bag filled with green pepper by him, and another plant\r\nlike ginger, together with a piece of lean mutton in it: this was his\r\nworship's repast: but pray observe the state of the food! two women\r\nslaves brought him his food, which being laid before him, two others\r\nappeared to perform their respective offices; one fed him with a spoon,\r\nwhile the other scraped off what fell upon his beard and taffety vest,\r\nand gave it to a particular favourite to eat. And thus we left the\r\nwretch pleased with the conceit of our admiring his magnificence, which\r\nrather merited our scorn and detestation.\r\n\r\nAt length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, accompanied by two\r\nservants, and the old Portuguese pilot, whose charges we bore, and who\r\nserved us as an interpreter by the way. We had scarce been a week at\r\nPekin, but he comes laughing to us. \"Ah! Seignior Inglise, (said he) me\r\nsomething tell you make your heart glad, but make me sorry: for your\r\nbring me here twenty-five days journey, and now you leave me go back\r\nalone; and which way shall I make my port after, without de ship,\r\nwithout de horse, without pecune?\" so he called money in his broken\r\nLatin. He then informed me, that there was a great caravan of Muscovite\r\nand Polish merchants in the city, who were preparing to set out for\r\nMuscovy by land within six weeks; and, that he was certain we would take\r\nthis opportunity, and consequently that he must go home by himself.\r\nIndeed this news infinitely surprised & pleased me. \"Are you certain of\r\nthis?\" said I, \"Yes, Sir, (says he) me sure its true.\" And so he told\r\nme, that having met an old acquaintance of his, an Armenian, in the\r\nstreet, who was among them, and who had come from Astracan, with a\r\ndesign to go to Tonquin, but for certain reasons having altered his\r\nresolutions, he was now resolved to go with the caravan, and to return\r\nby the river Wolga to Astracan. \"Well, Seignior, (said I) don't be\r\ndiscontented about your returning alone; and if, by this means, I can\r\nfind a passage to England, it will be your own fault if you return to\r\nMacao at all.\" And so consulting with my partner what was best to be\r\ndone, he referred it to me as I pleased, having our affairs so well\r\nsettled at Bengal, that if he could convert the good voyage he had made\r\nin China silks, wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to England;\r\nand so return to Bengal in the Company's ships. Thus resolved, we agreed\r\nthat if our pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges either to\r\nMoscow or England; and to give him in a present the sum of one hundred\r\nand seventy pounds sterling. Hereupon we called him in, and told him the\r\ncause of his complaint should be removed, if he would accompany us with\r\nthe caravans; and, therefore, we desired to know his mind. At this he\r\nshook his head, \"Great long journey, (said he) me no pecune carry me to\r\nMoscow, or keep me there.\" But we soon put him out of that concern, by\r\nmaking him sensible of what we would give him here to lay out the best\r\nadvantage; and, as for his charges, we would set him safe on shore, God\r\nwilling, either in Muscovy or England, as he pleased, at our own charge,\r\nexcept the carriage of his goods. At this proposal, he was like a man\r\ntransported, telling us he would go with us all the world over; and we\r\nmade preparations for our journey; but it was near four months before\r\nall the merchants were ready.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, my partner and the pilot went express to the port\r\nwhere we first put in, to dispose of what goods had been left there,\r\nwhile I accompanied a Chinese merchant who was going to Nanquin, and\r\nthere bought twenty-nine pieces of damask, with about three hundred more\r\nof other fine silks; and, by the time my partner returned to Pekin, I\r\nhad them all carried thither; our cargo in silks amounted to 45col.\r\nsterling, which, together with tea, fine calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves,\r\nloaded eighteen camels for our share, besides what we rode upon, with\r\ntwo or three spare horses, and two more loaden with provisions; the\r\ncompany now was very great, making about four hundred horse, and above\r\none hundred and twenty men, well armed and provided. We were of several\r\nnations, among whom were five Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow,\r\nand well experienced in trade.\r\n\r\nWe set out from Pekin the beginning of February our stile; and in two\r\ndays more, we passed through the gate of the great China wall, which was\r\nerected as a fortification against the Tartars, being one hundred\r\nEnglish miles long. We then entered a country not near so populous,\r\nchiefly under the power of plundering Tartars, several companies of whom\r\nwe perceived riding on poor starved horses, contemptible as themselves\r\nwithout order of discipline. One time our leader, for the day, gave us\r\nleave to go a hunting; but what do you think we hunted? only a parcel of\r\nsheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for wildness and\r\nswiftness; but while we were pursuing this game, it was our chance to\r\nmeet with about forty Tartars, who no sooner perceived us, but one of\r\nthem blew a horn, at the sound of which there soon appeared a troop of\r\nforty or fifty more, at about a mile's distance. Hereupon, one of the\r\nScots merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us to advance towards\r\nthem, and attack them immediately, As we advanced, they let fly a\r\nvolley of arrows, which happily fell a little short of us; this made us\r\nhalt a little, to return the compliment with bullets; and then being led\r\nup by the bold Scot, we fired our pistols in their faces, and drew out\r\nour swords; but there was no occasion; for they flew like timorous\r\nsheep, & only three of them remained, beckoning to the rest to come\r\nback. But our brave commander gallops up to them by himself, shot one\r\ndead, knocked another of his horse, while the third ran away; and thus\r\nended our battle with the Tartars.\r\n\r\nWe travelled a month more through the Emperor of China's dominions; and\r\nat length coming to one of their towns about a day and a half's journey\r\nfrom the city of Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The person I spoke to\r\nwould have brought me one, but, like a fool, I must go along with him,\r\nabout two miles from the village. My old pilot and I walked on foot,\r\nforsooth, for some variety, when coming to the place where the camels\r\nwere kept as in a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed and\r\nbought one, which the Chinese man that came along with me led along the\r\nroad. But we had not gone far, before we were attacked by five Tartars,\r\nmounted on horseback, two of whom seized the man, took the camel from\r\nhim, and rode away, while the other three approached us, the first of\r\nwhom suddenly seized me as I was drawing my sword, the second; knocked\r\nme down, but my old trusty Portuguese taking a pistol out of his pocket,\r\nwhich I knew nothing of, and coming up to the fellow that struck me, he\r\nwith one hand pulled him off his horse, and then shot him dead upon the\r\nspot; then taking his scymitar, he struck at the man that stopped us,\r\nbut missing him, cut off one of his horses ears, the pain of which made\r\nhim throw his rider to the ground. The poor Chinese who had led the\r\ncamel, seeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and seizing upon his\r\npole-ax, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked his brains out. But\r\nthere was another Tartar to deal with, who seeming neither inclined to\r\nfight nor fly, and my old man having begun to charge his pistol, the\r\nvery sight of it struck such a terror into the wretch, that away he\r\nscoured, leaving my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an\r\nabsolute victory.\r\n\r\nBy this time being awakened from my trance, I began to open my eyes,\r\nwondering where I was, having quite forgot all that passed; but my\r\nsenses returning, and feeling a great pain in my head, and seeing the\r\nblood was running over my clothes, I instantly jumped upon my feet, and\r\ngrasped my sword in my hand, with a resolution to take revenge: but no\r\nenemies now remained, except the dead Tartar, with his horse standing by\r\nhim. The old man seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards\r\nme, and embraced me with the greatest tenderness, at the same time\r\nexamining into my wound, which was far from being mortal. When we\r\nreturned to the village, the man demanded payment for his camel, which I\r\nrefusing, we brought the cause, before a Chinese judge, who acted with\r\ngreat impartiality: Having heard both sides, he asked the Chinese man\r\nthat went with me, whose servant he was? _Sir,_ said he, _I am nobody's,\r\nbut went with the stranger at his request: Why then_, said the judge,\r\n_you are the stranger's servant for the time, and the camel being\r\ndelivered to his servant, it is the same as though delivered to himself,\r\nand accordingly he must pay for it._ Indeed the case was so fairly\r\nstated, that I had nothing to object to it; so, having paid for that I\r\nwas robbed of, I sent for another, but did not go myself to fetch it, as\r\nI had enough of that sport before.\r\n\r\nThe city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire, so fortified, as\r\nsome will tell you, that millions of Tartars cannot batter down their\r\nwalls; by which certainly one might think one of our cannons would do\r\nmore execution than all their legions.\r\n\r\nWhen we were within a day's march of that city, we had information that\r\nthe governor had sent messengers to every part of the road, to inform\r\nthe travellers and caravans to halt, till a guard was sent to protect\r\nthem from the numerous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the\r\ncity. This news put us into great consternation; but, obeying the\r\norders, we stopt; & two days after, there came two hundred soldiers from\r\na garrison of the Chinese, and three hundred more from Naum; thus\r\nguarded both in the front and rear, with our own men in the flanks, we\r\nboldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat with ten thousand Mogul\r\nTartars, if they appeared.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, in our march from a little well situated town called\r\nChangu, after having passed a river, and entered upon a desert of about\r\nfifteen or sixteen miles over, we soon beheld by a cloud of dust that\r\nwas raised, that the enemy was approaching. This much dispirited the\r\nChinese. My old pilot took notice of it, and called out, _Seignor\r\nInglise, those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all, and\r\nI am afraid if the Tartars attack us, they will all run away_. \"Why,\r\nSeignor, (said I), what shall be done in this case?\" _Done_, says he,\r\n_why let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing. I know\r\nthe fellows will fight well enough in company_. We accordingly took his\r\nadvice, and marched fifty to the right wing, and the same number to the\r\nleft, and with the rest made a line of reserve, leaving the last two\r\nhundred men to guard the camels, or to assist us, as occasion required.\r\n\r\nThus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward, viewing our posture,\r\nand traversing the ground on the front of our line. Hereupon we ordered\r\nthe two wings to move on, and give them a salute with their shot; which\r\naccordingly was done. This put a stop to their proceedings; for\r\nimmediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched away, and we\r\nsaw no more of them. They had undoubtedly given an account to their\r\ncompanions of what reception they might expect, which made them to\r\neasily give over their enterprize.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the city of Naum, we returned the governor hearty\r\nthanks, and distributed a hundred crowns among the soldiers that guarded\r\nus. We rested there one day, and then proceeded on our travels, passing\r\nseveral great rivers and deserts and on the 13th of April we came to the\r\nfrontiers of Muscovy, the first town of which was called Argun.\r\n\r\nThis happy occasion, as I thought, of coming into a Christian country,\r\nmade me congratulate the Scots merchant upon it. He smiled at that,\r\ntelling me not to rejoice too soon; _for_, said he, _except the Russian\r\nsoldiers in garrison, and a few inhabitants of the cities upon the road,\r\nall the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles, is inhabited\r\nby the most ignorant and barbarous Pagans_.\r\n\r\nWe advanced from the river Arguna, by moderate journies and found\r\nconvenient garrisons on the road, filled with Christian soldiers for the\r\nsecurity of commerce, and for the convenient lodgings of travellers: but\r\nthe inhabitants of the country were mere Pagans, worshiping the sun,\r\nmoon, and stars. We particularly observed this idolatry near the river\r\nArguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Russians, called Nerisinkey.\r\nBeing curious to see their way of living, while the caravan continued to\r\nrest themselves in that city, I went to one of their villages, where\r\nthere was to be one of their solemn sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThere I beheld upon the stump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly\r\nthan the representation of the devil himself: its head resembled no\r\nliving creature; its ears were as big and as high as goat's horns, a\r\ncrooked nose, four-cornered mouth, and horrible teeth: it was clothed in\r\nsheep skins, had a great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing thro' it,\r\nand was eight feet high, without feet, legs or proportion. Before this\r\nidol their lay sixteen or seventeen people, who brought their offerings,\r\nand were making their prayers, while at a distance stood three men and\r\none bullock, as victims to this ugly monster.\r\n\r\nSuch stupendous sacrilege as this, in robbing the true God of his\r\nhonour, filled me with the greatest astonishment and reflection: which\r\nsoon turning to rage and fury, I rode up to the image, and cut in pieces\r\nthe bonnet that was upon his head with my sword, so that it hung down by\r\none of the horns, while one of my men that was with me pulled at it by\r\nhis sheep-skin garment. Immediately an hideous howling and outcry ran\r\nthrough the village, and two or three hundred people coming about our\r\nears, we were obliged to fly for it.\r\n\r\nBut I had not done with the monster; for the caravan being to rest\r\nthree nights in the town, I told the Scots merchant what I had seen, and\r\nthat I was resolved to take four or five men well armed with me, in\r\norder to destroy the idol, and show the people how little reason they\r\nhad to trust in a god who could not save himself. At first he laughed at\r\nme, representing the danger of it, and when it was destroyed, what time\r\nhad we to preach to them better things, whole zeal and ignorance was in\r\nthe highest degree, and both unparalleled? that if I should be taken by\r\nthem, I should be served as a poor ruffian, who contemned their worship;\r\nthat is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the top of the idol, there\r\nshot at with arrows till my body was fall of them, and then burnt as a\r\nsacrifice to the monster; _but Sir_, said he, _since your zeal carries\r\nyou so far, rather than you should be alone I will accompany you, and\r\nbring a stout fellow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist you in\r\nthis design:_ and accordingly he brought one Captain Richardson, who,\r\nhearing the story, readily consented; but my partner declined it, being\r\naltogether out of his way: and so we three, and my servant, resolved to\r\nexecute this exploit about midnight; but upon second thoughts we\r\ndeferred it to the next night, by reason that the caravan being to go\r\nfrom hence the next morning, we should be out of the governor's power.\r\nThe better to effectuate my design, I procured a Tartar's sheep-skin\r\nrobe, a bonnet, with bow and arrows, and every one of us got the like\r\nhabits, the first night we spent in mixing combustible matter with aqua\r\nvitae, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity of tar in a little pot:\r\nnext night we came up to the idol about eleven o'clock, the moon being\r\nup. We found none guarding it; but we perceived a light in the house,\r\nwhere we had seen the priests before. One of our men was for firing the\r\nhut, another for killing the people, and a third for making them\r\nprisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We agreed to the latter; so\r\nknocking at the door, we seized the first that opened it, and stopping\r\nhis mouth and tying his feet, we left him. We served the other two in\r\nthe like manner; and then the Scots merchant set fire to the\r\ncomposition, which frightened them so much, that we brought them all\r\naway prisoners to their wooden god. There we fell to work with him,\r\ndaubing him all over with tar mixed with tallow and brimstone stopping\r\nhis eyes, ears, and mouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of\r\nwild-fire in his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this\r\nbeing done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and set the idol on\r\nfire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the shape of it was deformed, rent\r\nand split, which the forage utterly consumed; for we staid to see its\r\ndestruction, lest the ignorant idolatrous people should have thrown\r\nthemselves into the flames, And thus we came away undiscovered, in the\r\nmorning appearing as busy among our fellow travellers, as no body could\r\nhave suspected any other, but that we had been in our beds all night.\r\n\r\nNext morning we let out, and had gone but a small distance from the\r\ncity, when there came a multitude of people of the country to the gates\r\nof the city, demanding satisfaction of the Ruffian governor for\r\ninsulting their priests, and burning their great Cham Cai-Thaungu, who\r\ndwelt in the sun, and no mortal would violate this image but some\r\nChristian miscreants; and being already no less than thirty thousand\r\nstrong, they announced war against him and all his Christians.\r\n\r\nThe governor assured them he was ignorant of the matter, and that none\r\nof his garrison had been abroad; that indeed there was a caravan that\r\nwent away that morning, and that he would send after them to inquire\r\ninto it; and whoever was the offender, should be delivered into their\r\nhands. This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent to\r\ninform us, that if any of us had done it, we should make all the haste\r\naway possible, while he kept them in play as long as he could. Upon this\r\nwe marched two days and two nights, stopping but very little, till at\r\nlast we arrived at a village called Plothus, and hasted to Jerawena,\r\nanother of the Czar's colonies. On the third day, having entered the\r\ndesert, and passed the lake called Shaks Oser, we beheld a numerous body\r\nof horde on the other side or it to the north, who supposed we had\r\npassed on that side of the lake; but either having found the mistake, or\r\nbeing certainly informed of the way we took, they came upon us towards\r\nthe dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched our camp between two\r\nlittle but very thick woods, with a little river running before our\r\nfront and some felled trees with which we covered our rear; a precaution\r\nwe always took, and which we had just finished when the enemy came up.\r\nThey did not fall on us immediately, but sent three messengers,\r\ndemanding the men who had insulted their priests, & burnt their god,\r\nCham Chi-Thaungu, that they might be burnt with fire; that if this was\r\ncomplied with, they would peaceably depart; but if not, they would\r\ndestroy one and all of us. Our men stared at one another on receipt of\r\nthis message, but Nobody was the word, as indeed nobody knew it, but he\r\nwho did it. Upon which the leader of the caravan returned for answer,\r\n_That they were peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of their\r\npriests and gods and therefore desired, them not to disturb us, and put\r\nus to the necessity of defending ourselves_. But do far was this from\r\nsatisfying them, that the next morning coming to our right, they let fly\r\na volley of arrows among us, which happily did not hurt any, because we\r\nsheltered ourselves behind our baggage. We expected however to come to a\r\ncloser engagement; but were happily saved by a cunning fellow, a\r\nCossack, who obtaining leave of the leader to go out, mounts his horse,\r\nrides directly from our rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the\r\nTartars, as tho he had been sent express, and tells them a formal story,\r\nthat the wretches who had burnt the Cham Chi-Thaungu, were gone to\r\nShiheilka, with a resolution to burn the god Shal-Ifar, belonging to the\r\nTongueses. Upon which, believing this cunning Tartar, who was servant to\r\nour Muscovites, away they drove to Shiheilka, and in less than three\r\nminutes were out of sight, nor did we ever hear of them more.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five days, and then\r\nentered into a frightful desert, which held us twenty-three days march,\r\ninfested with several small companies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who\r\nnever had the courage to attack us. After we had passed over this\r\ndesert, we found several garisons to defend the caravans from the\r\nviolence of the Tartars. In particular the Governor of Adinskoy offered\r\nus a guard of fifty men to the next station, if we apprehended any\r\ndanger. The people here retained the same paganism and barbarity, only\r\nthey were not so dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites. The\r\nclothing, both of men & women, is of the skins of beasts, living under\r\nthe ground in vaults & caves, which have a communication with one\r\nanother. They have idols almost in every family; besides, they adore the\r\nsun and stars, water and snow; and the least uncommon thing that happens\r\nin the elements, alarms them as much as thunder and lightning does the\r\nunbelieving Jews.\r\n\r\nNothing remarkable occurred in our march through this country. When we\r\nhad gone through the desert, after two days farther travel; we came to\r\nJenezoy, a Muscovite city, on the great river so called, which we were\r\ntold, parted Europe from Asia. The inhabitants here were very little\r\nbetter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the wonder will\r\ncease, when I inform my readers of what was observed to me, that the\r\nCzar rather converts the Tartars with soldiers than clergymen, and is\r\nmore proud to make them faithful subjects, than good Christians.\r\n\r\nFrom this city to the river Oby, we travelled over a pleasant, fruitful,\r\nbut very uncultivated country, for want of good management and people,\r\nand those few are mostly Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite\r\ncriminals are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next city\r\nwe came to, was the capital city of Siberia, called Tobolski when having\r\nbeen almost seven months on our journey, and winter drawing on apace, my\r\npartner and I consulted about our particular affairs in what manner we\r\nshould dispose of ourselves. We had been told of sledges and rein-deer\r\nto carry us over the snow in the winter season, the snow being frozen so\r\nhard, that the sledges can run upon the surface without any danger of\r\ngoing down. As I was bound to England, I now behoved either to go with\r\nthe caravan to Jerosaw, from thence west to Marva, and the gulph of\r\nFinland, and so by land or sea to Denmark; or else I must leave the\r\ncaravan at a little town on the Dwina, and so to Archangel, where I was\r\ncertain of shipping either to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. One night I\r\nhappened to get into the company of an illustrious, but banished Prince,\r\nwhose company and virtues were such as made me to propose to him a\r\nmethod how he might obtain his liberty. _My dear friend_, said he, _as I\r\nam here happily free from my miserable greatness with all its attendants\r\nof pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, if I should escape from this\r\nplace, those pernicious seeds may again revive, to my lasting\r\ndisquietude; therefore let me remain in a blessed confinement, for I am\r\nbut flesh, a mere man, with passions and affections as such; O be not my\r\nfriend and tempter too!_ Struck dumb with surprise, I stood silent\r\na-while; nor was he less in disorder, by which perceiving he wanted to\r\ngive vent to his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and so withdrew.\r\nBut about two hours after he came to my apartment: _Dear friend_, said\r\nhe, _though I cannot consent to accompany you, I shall have this\r\nsatisfaction in parting, that you leave me an honest man still: but as a\r\ntestimony of my affection to you, be pleased to accept this present\r\nof sables_.\r\n\r\nIn return for his compliment, I sent my servant next morning to his\r\nLordship with a small present of tea, two pieces of China damask, and\r\nfour little wedges of gold; but he only accepted the tea, one piece of\r\ndamask, and one piece of gold, for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that\r\nwas upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and told me, _that what he\r\nhad refused himself, he hoped upon his account, I would grant to another\r\nwhom he should name:_ In short it was his only son, who was about two\r\nhundred miles distant from him, on the other side of the city, whom he\r\nsaid he would send for, if I gave my consent. This I soon complied with;\r\nupon which he sent his servants next day for his son, who returned in\r\ntwenty days time, bringing seven horses loaded with valuable furs. At\r\nnight the young Lord was conducted incognito into our apartment, where\r\nhis father presented him to me. We then concerted the best ways for\r\ntravelling, and after having bought a considerable quantity of sables,\r\nblack fox-skins, fine ermines, &c. (which I sold at Archangel at a good\r\nprice) we set out from this city the beginning of June, making a small\r\ncaravan, being about thirty-two horses and camels, of which I\r\nrepresented the head. My young Lord had with him a very faithful\r\nSiberian servant, well acquainted with the roads: We shunned the\r\nprincipal towns and cities, as Tumen, Soli Kamoskoi, and several others,\r\nby reason of their strictness in examining travellers, lest any of the\r\nbanished persons of distinction should escape. Having passed the river\r\nKama, we came to a city on the European side, called Soloy Kamoskoi,\r\nwhere we found the people mostly Pagans as before. We then passed a\r\ndesert of about two hundred miles over; but in other places it is near\r\nseven hundred. In passing this wild place, we were beset by a troop of\r\nmen on horseback, and about five and forty men armed with bows and\r\narrows. At first they looked earnestly on us, and then placed themselves\r\nin our way. We were above sixteen men, and drew up a little line before\r\nour camels. My young Lord sent out his Siberian servant, to know who\r\nthey were; but, when he approached them, he neither knew a word they\r\nsaid; nor would they admit him to come near them at his peril, but\r\nprepared to shoot him. At his return, he told us he believed them to be\r\nCalmuc Tartars; and that there were more upon the desert. This was but a\r\nsmall comfort to us; yet seeing a little grove, about a quarter of a\r\nmile's distance, we moved to it, by the old Portuguese pilot's advice,\r\nwithout meeting with any opposition. Here we found a marshy piece of\r\nground, and a spring of water running into a little brook on one side,\r\nwhich joined another like it a little further off, and these two formed\r\nthe head of the river called Writska. As soon as we arrived, we went to\r\nwork, cutting great arms off the trees, and laying them hanging (not\r\nquite off from one tree to another). In this situation we waited the\r\nmotion of the enemy, without perceiving any advancement they made\r\ntowards us. About two hours before night, being joined by some others,\r\nin all about fourscore horse, among whom we fancied were some women,\r\nthey came upon us with great fury. We fired without ball, calling to\r\nthem in the Russian tongue, to know their business; but they, either not\r\nknowing, or seeming not to understand us, came directly to the wood\r\nside, nor considering that we were to be fortified, as that they could\r\nnot break in. Our old pilot, the Portuguese, proved both our captain and\r\nengineer, and desired us not to fire, till they came within pistol shot;\r\nand when he gave the word of command, then to take the surest aim: but\r\nhe did not bid us give fire, till they were within two pikes length of\r\nus, and then we filled fourteen of them, wounded several, as also their\r\nhorses, having every one of us loaded our pieces with two or three\r\nbullets at least. So much were they surprised at our undauntedness, that\r\nthey retired about a hundred roods from us. In the mean while we loaded\r\nour pieces again, and sallying out, secured four or five of their\r\nhorses, whose riders we found were killed, and perceived them to be\r\nTartars. About an hour after, they made another attempt, to see where\r\nthey might break in; but finding us ready to receive them, they retired.\r\n\r\nAll that night we wrought hard, in strengthening our situation, and\r\nbarricading the entrances into the woods; but when day-light came, we\r\nhad a very unwelcome discovery; for the enemy, being encouraged by\r\ntheir numbers, had set up eleven or twelve tents, in form of a camp,\r\nabout three quarters of a mile from us. I must confess, I was never more\r\nconcerned in my life, giving myself and all that I had over for lost.\r\nAnd my partner declared, that as the loss of his goods would be his\r\nruin, before they should be taken from him, he would fight to the last\r\ndrop of his blood. As we could not pretend to force our way, we had\r\nrecourse to a stratagem; we kindled a large fire, which burnt all night;\r\nand no sooner was it dark, but we pursued our journey towards the pole\r\nor north star, and travelling all night; by six o'clock in the morning\r\nwe came to a Russian village called Kertza, and from thence came to a\r\nlarge town named Ozonzoys, where we heard that several troops of Calmuc\r\nTartars had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were past all\r\ndanger. In five days after we came to Veuslima, upon the river Witzedga;\r\nfrom thence we came to Lawrenskoy, on the third of July, where,\r\nproviding ourselves with two luggage boats, and a convenient bark, we\r\nembarked the seventh, and arrived at Archangel the eighteenth, after a\r\nyear, five months, and three days journey, including the eight months\r\nand odd days at Tobolski. We came from Archangel the 20th of August in\r\nthe same year, and arrived at Hamburg the 30th of September. Here my\r\npartner and I made a very good sale of our goods, both those of China\r\nand Siberia; when dividing our effects, my share came to 3475l. 17s. 3d.\r\nafter all the losses we had sustained, and charges we had been at. Here\r\nthe young Lord took his leave of me, in order to go to the court of\r\nVienna, not only to seek protection, but to correspond with his father's\r\nfriends. After we had staid four months in Hamburgh, I went from thence\r\noverland to the Hague, where embarking in the packet, I arrived in\r\nLondon the 10th of January 1705, after ten years and nine months absence\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_R O B I N S O N C R U S O E'S_  VISION OF THE ANGELIC WORLD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAP. I. Of SOLITUDE.\r\n\r\nHowever solitude is looked upon as a restraint to the pleasure of the\r\nworld, in company and conversation, yet it is a happy state of exemption\r\nfrom a sea of trouble, an inundation of vanity and vexation, of\r\nconfusion and disappointment. While we enjoy ourselves, neither the joy\r\nnot sorrow of other men affect us: We are then at liberty with the voice\r\nof our soul, to speak to God. By this we shun such frequent trivial\r\ndiscourse, as often becomes an obstruction to virtue: and how often do\r\nwe find that we had reason to with we had not been in company, or said\r\nnothing when we were there? for either we offend God by the impiety of\r\nour discourse, or lay ourselves open to the violence of designing people\r\nby our ungarded expressions; and frequently feel the coldness and\r\ntreachery of pretended friends, when once involved in trouble and\r\naffliction: of such unfaithful intimates (I should say enemies) who\r\nrather by false inuendoes would accumulate miseries upon us, than\r\nhonestly assist us when under the hard hand of adversity. But in a state\r\nof solitude, when our tongues cannot be heard, except from the great\r\nMajesty of Heaven, how happy are we, in the blessed enjoyment of\r\nconversing with our Maker! It is then we make him our friend, which sets\r\nus above the envy and contempt of wicked men. When a man converses with\r\nhimself, he is sure that he does not converse with an enemy. Our retreat\r\nshould be to good company, and good books. I mean not by solitude, that\r\na man should retire into a cell, a desert, or a monastry: which would be\r\naltogether an useless and unprofitable restraint: for as men ate formed\r\nfor society, and have an absolute necessity and dependance upon one\r\nanother; so there is a retirement of the soul, with which it converses\r\nin heaven, even in the midst of men; and indeed no man is more fit to\r\nspeak freely, than he who can, without any violence himself, refrain his\r\ntongue, or keep silence altogether. As to religion, it is by this the\r\nfoul gets acquainted with the hidden mysteries of the holy writings;\r\nhere she finds those floods of tears, in which good men wash themselves\r\nday and night, and only makes a visit to God, and his holy angels. In\r\nthis conversation the truest peace and most solid joy are to be found;\r\nit is a continual feast of contentment on earth, and the means of\r\nattaining everlasting happiness in heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II. Of HONESTY.\r\n\r\nHonesty is a virtue beloved by good men, and pretended to by all other\r\npersons. In this there are several degrees: to pay every man his own is\r\nthe common law of honesty: but to do good to all mankind, is the\r\nchancery law of honesty: and this chancery court is in every man's\r\nbreast, where his conscience is a Lord Chancellor. Hence it is, that a\r\nmiser, though he pays every body their own, cannot be an honest man,\r\nwhen he does not discharge the good offices that are incumbent on a\r\nfriendly, kind, and generous person: for, faith the prophet Isaiah,\r\nchap. XXXII. ver. 7, 8. _The instruments of a churl are evil: he\r\ndeviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when\r\nthe needy speaketh right. But the liberal soul deviseth liberal things,\r\nand by liberal things shall he stand_. It is certainly honest to do\r\nevery thing the law requires; but should we throw every poor debtor into\r\nprison till he has paid the utmost farthing, hang every malefactor\r\nwithout mercy, exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture of\r\nevery indenture, this would be downright cruelty, and not honesty: and\r\nit is contrary to that general rule, _To do to another, that which you\r\nwould have done unto you_. Sometimes necessity makes an honest man a\r\nknave: and a rich man a honest man, because he has no occasion to be a\r\nknave. The trial of honesty is this: Did you ever want bread, and had\r\nyour neighbour's loaf in keeping, and would starve rather than eat it?\r\nWere you ever arrested, having in your custody another man's cash, and\r\nwould rather go to gaol, than break it? if so, this indeed may be\r\nreckoned honesty. For King Solomon tells us, _That a good name is better\r\nthan life, and is a precious ointment, and which, when a man has once\r\nlost, he has nothing left worth keeping_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III _Of the present state of Religion in the world_.\r\n\r\nI doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than religion in the world,\r\nmore adoration than supplication, and more hypocrisy than sincerity; and\r\nit is very melancholy to consider, what numbers of people there are\r\nfurnished with the powers of reason and gifts of nature, and yet\r\nabandoned to the grossest ignorance and depravity. But it would be\r\nuncharitable for us to imagine (as some Papists, abounding with too much\r\nill nature, the only scandal to religion, do) that they will certainly\r\nbe in a state of damnation after this life; for how can we think it\r\nconsistent with the mercy and goodness of an infinite Being, to damn\r\nthose creatures, when he has not furnished them with the light of the\r\ngospel? or how can such proud, conceited and cruel bigots, prescribe\r\nrules to the justice and mercy of God?\r\n\r\nWe are told by some people, that the great image which King\r\nNebuchadnezzar set up to be adored by his people held the representation\r\nof the sun in it's right hand, as the principal object of adoration. But\r\nto wave this discourse of Heathens, how many self-contradicting\r\nprinciples are there held among Christians? and how do we doom one\r\nanother to the devil, while all profess to worship the same Deity, and\r\nto expect the same salvation.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Portugal, there was held at that time the court of justice\r\nof the Inquisition. All the criminals were carried in procession to the\r\ngreat church, where eight of them were habited in gowns and caps of\r\ncanvass, whereon the torments of hell were displayed, and they were\r\ncondemned and burnt for crimes against the Catholic faith and\r\nblessed Virgin.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to make any reflection upon Christians; but indeed, in Italy\r\nthe Roman religion seems the most cruel and mercenary upon earth; and a\r\nvery judicious person, who travelled through Italy from Turkey, tells,\r\n_That there is only the face and outward pomp of religion there; that\r\nthe church protects murderers and assassins; and then delivers the civil\r\nmagistrate over to Satan for doing justice; interdicts whole kingdoms,\r\nand shuts up the churches for want of paying a few ecclesiastical dues,\r\nand so puts a stop to religion for want of their money; that the court\r\nof Inquisition burnt two men for speaking dishonourably of the Blessed\r\nVirgin; and the missionaries of China tolerated the worshipping the\r\ndevil by their new converts: that Italy was the theatre, where religion\r\nwas the grand opera: and that the Popish clergy were no other than\r\nstage players_.\r\n\r\nAs to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be the Messiah, or that\r\nthe Messiah has come in the flesh. And as to their Protestants, they are\r\nthe followers of Laelius Socinus, who denied our Saviour's divinity; and\r\nhave no concern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nIn Muscovy their churches are built of wood, and, indeed, they have but\r\nwooden priests, though of the Greek church; they pray as much to St.\r\nNicholas, as the Papists do to the Virgin Mary, for protection in all\r\ntheir difficulties or afflictions.\r\n\r\nAs to Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in believing\r\nconsubstantiation, instead of transubstantiation; but like them, they\r\nare much pleased with the external gallantry and pomp, more than the\r\ntrue and real practice of it.\r\n\r\nIn France I found a world of priests, the streets every where crowded\r\nwith them, and the churches full of women: but surely never was a nation\r\nso full of blind guides, so ignorant of religion, and even as void of\r\nmorals, as those people who confess their sins to them.\r\n\r\nDoes it not seem strange, that, while all men own the Divine Being,\r\nthere should be so many different opinions as to the manner of paying\r\nhim obedience in the Christian church? I know not what reason to assign\r\nfor this, except it be their different capacities and faculties.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, upon this account, we have perceived, in all Christian\r\ncountries, what mortal feuds have been about religion; what wars and\r\nbloodshed have molested Europe, till the general pacification of the\r\nGerman troubles at the treaty of Westphalia: and since those times, what\r\npersecution in the same country among the churches of the Lutherans; and\r\nshould I take a prospect at home, what unhappy divisions are between\r\nChristians in this kingdom, about Episcopacy and Presbytery; the church\r\nof England and the Dissenters opposing one another like St. Paul and St.\r\nPeter, even to the face; that is, they carry on the dispute to the\r\nutmost extremity.\r\n\r\nIt might be a question, why there are such differences in religious\r\npoints, and why these breaches should be more hot and irreconcileable?\r\nAll the answer I can give to this, is, that we inquire more concerning\r\nthe truth of religion, than any other nation in the world; and the\r\nanxious concern we have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion, and\r\ntenacious of our own; and this is not because we are more furious and\r\nrash than other people; but the truth is, we are more concerned about\r\nthem, and being sensible that the scripture is the great rule of faith,\r\nthe standard for life and doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves,\r\nwithout submitting to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.\r\n\r\nThere is another question, pertinent to the former, and that is, _What\r\nremedy can we apply to this malady_? And to this I must negatively\r\nanswer, _Not to be less religious, that we may differ the less_. This is\r\nstriking at the very root of all religious differences; for, certainly,\r\nwere they to be carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing to be\r\ninformed, our variety of opinions would not have the name of\r\ndifferences; nor should we separate in communion of charity though we\r\ndid not agree in several articles of religion.\r\n\r\nNor is there a less useful question to start, namely, _Where will our\r\nunhappy religious differences end?_ To which, I hope, I may answer, _In\r\nHeaven_; there we shall unchristian and unbrotherly differences will\r\nfind a period; there we shall embrace many a sinner, that here we think\r\nit a dishonour to converse with; & perceive many a heart we have broken\r\nhere with censures, reproachings, & revilings, made whole again by the\r\nbalm of the same Redeemer's blood. Here we shall perceive there have\r\nbeen other flocks than those of our fold; that those we have\r\nexcommunicated have been taken into that superior communion; and, in a\r\nword, that those contradicting notions and principles which we thought\r\ninconsistent with true religion, we shall then find reconcileable to\r\nthemselves, to one another, and to the fountain of truth. If any man ask\r\nme, Why our differences cannot be ended on earth? I answer, _Were we all\r\nthoroughly convinced, that then they would be reconciled, we would put\r\nan end to them before; but this is impossible to be done: for as men's\r\ncertain convictions of truth are not equal to one another, or the weight\r\nor significancy of such veracity: so neither can a general effect of\r\nthis affair be expected on this side of time_.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this chapter, I shall beg leave to discourse a little\r\nof the wonderful excellency of negative religion and negative virtue.\r\nThe latter sets out, like the Pharisee, with, _God, I thank thee;_ it is\r\na piece of religious pageantry, the hypocrite's hope: and, in a word, it\r\nis positive vice: for it is either a mask to deceive others, or a mist\r\nto deceive ourselves. A man that is clothed with negatives, thus argues:\r\n_ I am not such a drunkard as my landlord, such a thief as my tenant,\r\nsuch a rakish fellow, or a highwayman; No! I live a sober, regular,\r\nretired life: I am a good man, I go to church; God, I thank thee._ Now,\r\nthrough a mans boasts of his virtue in contradiction to the vices\r\nmentioned, yet a person had better have them altogether than the man\r\nhimself; or he is so full of himself, so persuaded that he is good and\r\nreligious enough already, that he has no thoughts of any thing, except\r\nit be to pull of his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank him\r\nthat he has no occasion for him; and has the vanity to think that his\r\nneighbours must imagine well of him too.\r\n\r\nThe negative man, though he is no drunkard is yet intoxicated with the\r\npride of his own worth; a good neighbour and peace-maker in other\r\nfamilies, but a tyrant in his own; appears in church for a show, but\r\nnever falls upon his knees in his closet; does all his alms before men,\r\nto be seen of them; eager in the duties of the second table, but\r\nregardless of the first; appears religious, to be taken notice of by\r\nmen, but without intercourse or communication between God and his own\r\nsoul: Pray, what is this man? or what comfort is there of the life he\r\nlives? he is insensible of faith, repentance, and a Christian mortified\r\nlife: in a word, he is a perfectly a stranger to the essential part\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nLet us for a while enter into the private and retired part of his\r\nconversation: What notions has he of his mispent hours, and of the\r\nprogress of time to the great centre and gulph of life, eternity? Does\r\nhe know how to put a right value on time, or esteem the life-blood of\r\nhis soul, as it really is, and act in all the moments of it, as one that\r\nmust account for them? if then you can form an equality between what he\r\ncan do and what he shall receive; less can be founded upon his negative\r\nvirtue, or what he has forborne to do: And if neither his negative nor\r\npositive piety can be equal to the reward, and to the eternity that\r\nreward is to last for, what then is to become of the Pharisee, when he\r\nis to be judged by the sincerity of his repentance, and rewarded,\r\naccording to the infinite grace of God, with a state of blessedness to\r\nan endless eternity?\r\n\r\nWhen the negative man converses with the invisible world, he is filled\r\nwith as much horror and dread as Felix, when St Paul reasoned to him of\r\ntemperance, righteousness, and of judgment to come; for Felix, though a\r\ngreat philosopher, of great power and reverence, was a negative man, and\r\nhe was made sensible by the Apostle, that, as a life of virtue and\r\ntemperance was its own reward, by giving a healthy body, a clear head,\r\nand a composed life, so eternal happiness must proceed from another\r\nspring; namely, the infinite unbounded grace of a provoked God, who\r\nhaving erected a righteous tribunal, Jesus Christ would separate such as\r\nby faith and repentance he had brought home and united to himself by the\r\ngrace of adoption, and on the foot of his having laid down his life as a\r\nransom for them, had appointed them to salvation, when all the\r\nphilosophy, temperance, and righteousness in the world besides had been\r\nineffectual. And this, I say, it was, that made Felix, this negative\r\nman tremble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV. _Of listening to the voice of Providence_.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent and wise King Solomon bids us cry after knowledge, and\r\nlift up our voice for understanding; by which is meant, religious\r\nknowledge, for it follows: _Then shalt thou understand the fear of the\r\nLord, and find the knowledge of God_. By which undoubtedly he meant, to\r\nenquire after every thing he has permitted us to know, and not to search\r\ninto those ways that are unsearchable, and are effectually locked up\r\nfrom our knowledge.--Now, _as listening to the voice of Providence_ is\r\nmy present subject, I intend, in the first place, to write to those who\r\nown, 1. That there is a God, a first great moving cause of all things,\r\nand eternal power, prior, and consequently superior to all created power\r\nor being.--2. That this eternal power, which is God, is the sovereign\r\ncreator and governor of heaven and earth.\r\n\r\nTo avoid all needless distinctions, what persons in the God-head\r\nexercise the creating, and what the governing power, I offer that\r\nglorious text, Psal. xxiii. 6. where the whole Trinity is entitled to\r\nthe whole creating work: and, therefore, in the next place, I shall lay\r\ndown these two propositions.\r\n\r\nI. _That the eternal God guides, by his providence, the whole\r\n   universe, which was created by his power._\r\n\r\nII. _That this providence manifests a particular care over, and\r\n    concern in, the governing and directing man, the most noble\r\n    creature upon earth_.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, that natural religion proves the first, by intimating the\r\nnecessity of a providence guiding and governing the world, from the\r\nconsequence of the wisdom, justice, prescience, and goodness of the\r\nAlmighty Creator: for otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God\r\nshould create a world, without any care or providence over it, in\r\nguiding the operations of nature, so as to preserve the order of\r\nhis creation.\r\n\r\nRevealed religion gives us a light into the care and concern of his\r\nprovidence, by the climate's being made habitable, the creatures\r\nsubjected and made nourishing, and all vegetative life made medicinal;\r\nand all this for the sake of man, who is made viceroy to the King of the\r\nearth. The short description I shall give of providence is this: _That\r\nit is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, and goodness of God,\r\nby which be influences, governs, and directs, not only the means, but\r\nthe events of all things, which concern us in this sublunary world; the\r\nsovereignty of which we ought always to reverence, obey its motions,\r\nobserve its dictates, and listen to its voice. The prudent man forseeth\r\nthe evil, and hideth himself; that is, as I take it, there is a secret\r\nprovidence intimates to us, that some danger threatens, if we strive not\r\nto shun it_.\r\n\r\nThe same day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull against the royal martyr\r\nKing Charles I. the same day Sir John Hotham was put to death by the\r\nparliament for that very action: The same day that the King himself\r\nsigned the warrant for the execution of the Earl of Stafford, the same\r\nday of the month was he barbarously murdered by the blood-thirsty\r\nOliverian crew: and the same day that King James II. came to the crown\r\nagainst the bill of exclusion, the same day he was voted abdicated by\r\nthe parliament, and the throne filled with King William and Queen Mary.\r\n\r\nThe voice of signal deliverances from sudden dangers, is not only a just\r\ncall to repentance, but a caution against falling into the like danger;\r\nbut such who are utterly careless of themselves after, show a lethargy\r\nof the worst nature, which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism\r\nor at least, a living in a contempt of Heaven, when he receives good at\r\nthe hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from whence it comes, or to\r\nthank the bountiful hand that gave it; neither, when he receives evil,\r\ndoes it alter his manner of life, or bring him to any state of\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nWe have a remarkable story of two soldiers being condemned to death in\r\nFlanders. The general being prevailed upon to spare one of them, ordered\r\nthem to cast dice upon the drumhead for their lives; the first having\r\nthrown two sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands, having so poor a\r\nchance to escape; however, having thrown, he was surprised when he also\r\nthrew other two sixes. The officer appointed to see the execution,\r\nordered them to throw again; they did so, and each of them threw fives;\r\nat which the soldiers that stood round, shouted, and said, neither of\r\nthem was to die. Upon this, the officer acquainted the council of war,\r\nwho ordered them to throw a third time, when they threw two fours: the\r\ngeneral being acquainted with it, sent for the men, and pardoned them.\r\n_I love,_ said he, _in such extraordinary cases, to listen to the voice\r\nof Providence._\r\n\r\nWe read in the holy writings, how God speaks to men by appearance of\r\nangels, or by dreams and visions of the night. As God appeared to\r\nAbraham, Lot, and Jacob: so angels have appeared to many in other cases,\r\nas to Manoah and his wife, Zechariah, the Virgin Mary, and to the\r\napostles; other have been warned in a dream as king Abimelech, the false\r\nprophet Balaam, and many others.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, _What we shall be after\r\nthis life?_ for there is scarce a doubt, that there is a place reserved\r\nfor the reception of our souls after death: for if we are to be, we must\r\nhave a where, which the scriptures assert by the examples of Dives and\r\nLazarus. The doctrine of spirits was long believed before our Saviour's\r\ntime; for when the disciples of the blessed Jesus perceived our Saviour\r\nwalking on the sea, they were as much surprised as though they had seen\r\na spirit. Nay, in those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits\r\nintermeddled in the affairs of mankind; and, throughout the Old\r\nTestament, I do not find any thing that in the least contradicts is. All\r\nthe pains and labour that some learned men have taken, to confute the\r\nstory of the witch of Endor, and the appearance of an old man\r\npersonating Samuel, cannot make such apparitions inconsistent with\r\nnature or religion; and it is plain, that it was either a good or bad\r\nspirit, that prophetically told the unfortunate king what should happen\r\nthe next day; for, said the spirit, _The Lord will deliver thee into the\r\nhands of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be\r\nwith me._\r\n\r\nAbundance of strange notions possessed me, when I was in the desolate\r\nisland; especially on a moonshine night, when every bush seemed a man,\r\nand every tree a man on horseback. When I crept into the dismal cave\r\nwhere the old goat lay expiring, whole articulate groans even resembled\r\nthose of a man, how was I surprised! my blood chilled in my veins,\r\na cold sweaty dew sat on my forehead, my hair stood upright, and my\r\njoints, like Belshazzar's knees, struck against one another. And, indeed,\r\nthough I afterwards found what it was, the remains of this surprise did\r\nnot wear off for a great while; and I had frequently returns of those\r\nvapours on different occasions, and sometimes without any occasion at all.\r\n\r\nOne night, after having seen some appearance in the air, as I had just\r\nlain down in my bed, one of my feet pained me; after that came a\r\nnumbness, succeeded with a tingling in my blood; when on a sudden I\r\nthought something alive lay upon me, from my knee to above half my leg.\r\nUpon this I flung myself out of bed where I thought the creature lay;\r\nbut finding nothing, _Lord deliver me from evil spirits_, said I, _what\r\ncan this be?_ When I lighted a candle, I could perceive no living\r\ncreature in the place with me, but the poor parrot, who, being frighted,\r\ncried out, _Hold your tongue_, and _What's the matter with you_, which\r\nwords I had taught him, by saying so to him, when he made such screaming\r\nnoises as I did not like. _Lord_, said I aloud, _surely the devil has\r\nbeen here._ _Hold your tongue_, says Poll. I was then mad at the bird,\r\nand putting on my clothes, cried, _I am terribly frighted._ _What's the\r\nmatter with you_? says Poll. _You toad_, said I, _I'll knock your brains\r\nout._ _Hold you tongue_, cried he again, and so fell a chattering, and\r\ncalling Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But after I had composed\r\nmyself, and went to bed again, I began plainly to see it was a distemper\r\nthat affected my nerves, and so my terrors vanished at once.\r\n\r\nHow intelligences are given or received, we do not know; nor are we\r\nsensible how they are conveyed from spirits embodied to ours that are\r\nin life; or, on the contrary, from us to them; the latter is certainly\r\ndone without help of the organs, and the former is conveyed by the\r\nunderstanding, and the retired faculties of the soul.\r\n\r\nThe spirits, without the help of voices, converse, and the more\r\nparticular discoveries of converse of the spirits, seem to me as\r\nfollow: to wit, dreams, voices, noises, impulses, hints, apprehensions,\r\ninvoluntary sadness, &c.\r\n\r\nDreams of old were the ways by which God himself was pleased to warn\r\nmen what services to perform, and what to shun. Joseph was directed of\r\nGod in a dream to go to Egypt; and so were the wise men warned in a\r\ndream to depart into their own country another way, to avoid the fury\r\nof Herod. I am not like those who think dreams are the mere designs of\r\na delirious head, or the relics of a day's perplexities or pleasures;\r\nbut, on the contrary, I must beg leave to say, I never met with any\r\ncapital mischief in my life, but I had some notice of it by a dream;\r\nand had I not been a thoughtless unbelieving creature, I might have\r\ntaken many a warning, and avoided many of the evils I afterwards fell\r\ninto, merely by total neglect of those dreams.\r\n\r\nI was once present at a dispute between a layman and a clergyman, upon\r\nthe subject of dreams. The first thought no regard should be given unto\r\nthem; that their communication from the invisible to the visible world\r\nwas a mere chimera, without any solid foundation. For, first, said he,\r\nif dreams were from the agency of any prescient being, the motives would\r\nbe more direct, and the discoveries more plain, and not by allegories\r\nand emblematic fancies, expressing things imperfect and obscure. 2.\r\nSince, with the notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid it,\r\nit is not likely to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitious. 3.\r\nThat the inconstancy of such notices, in cases equally important, proves\r\nthey did not proceed from any such agent. 4. That as our most distinct\r\ndreams had nothing in them of any significancy, it would be irrational\r\nand vain to think that they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were\r\nnot always thus warned or supplied with notice of good or evil, so all\r\nmen are not alike supplied with them; and what reason could we give,\r\nwhy one man or one woman should not have the same hints as another.\r\n\r\nTo all this the clergyman gave answer: 1. That as to the signification of\r\ndreams, & the objections against them, as being dark and doubtful, they are\r\nexpressed generally by hierogliphical representations, similies, allusions,\r\nand figurative emblematic ways, by which means, for want of interpretation,\r\nthe thing was not understood, and, consequently, the evil not shunned. 2.\r\nThat we charge God foolishly, to say, that he has given the notice of evil,\r\nwithout the power to avoid it; for, if any one had not power to avoid the\r\nevil, it was no notice to him; and it was want of giving due head to that\r\nnotice, that men first neglected themselves, and then charged the Judge of\r\nall the earth with injustice. 3. That we ought not to find fault with the\r\ninconstancy of these notices; but rather with our weak understandings, by\r\npretending dreams were not to be regarded, and negligent when the voice\r\nreally spoke to us for our good. It is a mistake to say, dreams have no\r\nimport at all: we might, with more reason, have said, none that we could\r\nperceive the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligence, too\r\nsecure at one time, and too much alarmed at another; so that the spirit,\r\nwhich we might be said to be conversing with in a dream, was constantly\r\nand equally kind and careful; but our powers are not always in the same\r\nstate of action, not equally attentive too, or retentive of the hints\r\nthat were given. And, 5. To answer the last question, Why people are not\r\nequally supplied? This seemed to be no question; for Providence itself\r\nmight have some share in the direction of it, and then that Providence\r\nmight be limited by a superior direction; that as to the converse of\r\nspirits, he could not call it a stated converse: such a thing there was,\r\nbut why there was so much of it, and no more, was none of his business,\r\nand that no such discovery had ever yet been made to mankind. Nor were\r\nwe to imagine less of waking dreams, trances, visions, noises, hints,\r\nimpulses, and all the waking testimonies of an invisible world, and of\r\nthe communication that there is between us and them, which commonly\r\nentertain us with our open eyes.\r\n\r\nOne time my fancy soared on high, to see what discoveries I could make\r\nin those clearer regions. I found that such immense bodies as the sun,\r\nstars, planets, and moon, in the great circle of the lower heaven, are\r\nfar from being found in the study of nature on the surface of the earth.\r\nHere I saw many things that we can entertain little or no notion of, in\r\na state of common life, and the emptiness of our notion, that the\r\nplanets are habitable worlds; that is, created like ours, for the\r\nsubsistence and existence of man and beast, and the preservation of the\r\nvegitative and sensitive life: No, no, this is, I assure you, a world of\r\nspirits; for here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being the _prince\r\nof the power of the air_, keeping his court or camp, with innumerable\r\nangels to attend him; but his power is not so great as we imagine, he\r\ncan tempt us to the crime, but cannot force us to commit: _Humanium est\r\npeccare_. Neither has the devil power to force the world into a\r\nrebellion against heaven, though his legions are employed among savage\r\nnations, to set up their master for a god, who make the heathens either\r\nworship him in person, or by his representatives, idols and monsters,\r\nwith the cruel sacrifices of human blood. Now, as to the limitations of\r\nthe devil's power, you must understand, that as there are numbers of\r\nevil spirits employed in mischief, so there are numbers of good angels\r\nsent from the higher and blessed abodes to disconcert and oppose their\r\nmeasures; and this every Christian, I hope, believes, when he prays to\r\nGod, the father of spirits, to give his angels charge over him while he\r\nslumbereth and sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers the devil was\r\nnot restrained, the earth would be subjected to dearth, droughts, and\r\nfamine; the air infected with noxious fumes; and, in a word, mankind\r\nwould be utterly destroyed, which might oblige our Maker (if I may be\r\nallowed the expression) to the necessity of a new _fiat_, or else have\r\nno more creatures to honour and worship him.\r\n\r\nAs the devil never wanted insinuators, I shall observe, that I learned a\r\nway how to make a man dream of what I pleased. For instance, let us suppose\r\none to be found asleep; let another lay his mouth close to his ear, and\r\nwhisper any thing so softly as not to awake him, the sleeping man shall\r\ndream of what has been so whispered in his ear; nay, I can assure you,\r\nthose insinuating devils can do this even when we are awake, which I call\r\nimpulses of the mind: for from whence, but from these insinuators, come\r\nour causeless passions, involuntary wickedness, or sinful desires? Who\r\nelse form ideas in the mind of man when he is asleep, or present terrible\r\nor, beautiful figures to his fancy: Mr. Milton represents the devil\r\ntempting Eve in the shape of a toad, lying just at her ear, when in her\r\nbower she lay fast asleep; and brings in Eve telling Adam what an uneasy\r\nnight's rest she had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise I\r\nbelieve that good spirits have the same intercourse with us, in warning\r\nus against those things that are evil, and prompting us to that which is\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nWere we to have the eyes of our souls opened, through the eyes of our\r\nbodies, we should see this very immediate region or air which we breath\r\nin, thronged with spirits now invisible, and which otherwise would be\r\nthe most terrible; we should view the secret transactions of those\r\nmessengers who are employed when the parting soul takes it's leave of\r\nthe reluctant body, and perhaps see things nature would shrink back from\r\nwith the utmost terror and amazement. In a word, the curtain of\r\nProvidence for the disposition of things here, and the curtain of\r\njudgment for the determination of the state of souls hereafter, would be\r\nalike drawn back; and what heart could support here its future state in\r\nlife; much less that, of its future state after life, even good or bad.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of my acquaintance, being about seven miles distant from\r\nLondon, a friend that came to dine with him, solicited him to go to the\r\ncity. _What_, said the gentleman, _is there any occasion for me? No,\r\nSir_, said the other, _nothing at all except the enjoyment of your good\r\ncompany_: and so gave over importuning him. Just then a strong impulse\r\nof mind urged the gentleman and pursued him like a voice, with, _Go to\r\nLondon, Go to London. Hark ye_, says he to his friend, _is all well at\r\nLondon? Am I wanted there? Or did you ask me to go with you on any\r\nparticular account? Are all my family well? Yes, indeed, Sir_, said he,\r\n_I perceived them all very hearty; and I did not ask you to go to London\r\nupon any particular account whatsoever, except it was for the sake of\r\nyour good company_. Again, he put off his resolution: but still the\r\nimpulse suggested to him, _Go to London_; and at length he did so. When\r\nhe came there, he found a letter and a messenger had been there to seek\r\nhim, and to tell him of a particular business, which was at first and\r\nlast above a thousand pounds to him, and which might inevitably have\r\nbeen lost, had he hot gone to London that night.\r\n\r\nThe obeying of several hints, of secret impulses, argues great wisdom.\r\nI knew a man that was under misfortunes, being guilty of misdemeanors\r\nagainst the goverment; when, absconding for fear of his ruin, all his\r\nfriends advising him not to put himself in the hands of the law, one\r\nmorning as he awaked, he felt a strong impulse darting into his mind\r\nthus, _Write a letter to them;_ and this was repeated several times to\r\nhis mind, and at last he answered to it, as if it had been a voice,\r\n_Whom shall I write to?_ Immediately it replied, _Write to the judge:_\r\nand this impulse pursued him for several days, till at length he took\r\npen, ink, and paper, and sat down to write to him: when immediately\r\nwords flowed from his pen, like streams from a fair fountain, that\r\ncharmed even himself with hopes of success. In short, the letter was so\r\nstrenuous in argument, so pathetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively\r\nmoving, that when the judge had read it, he sent him an answer he might\r\nbe easy, he would endeavour to make that matter light to him; and,\r\nindeed, never left exerting himself, till he had stopt the prosecution,\r\nand restored him to his liberty and family.\r\n\r\nI know a person who had so strong an impression upon her mind, that the\r\nhouse she was in would be burnt that very night, that she could not\r\nsleep; the impulse she had upon her mind pressed her not to go to bed,\r\nwhich, however, she got over, and went to bed; but was so terrified with\r\nthe thought, which run in her mind, that the house would be burnt, that\r\nshe could not go to sleep; but communicating her apprehensions to\r\nanother in the family, they were both in such a fright, that they\r\napplied themselves to search from the top of the house to the bottom, &\r\nto see every fire and candle safe out, so that, as they all said, it was\r\nimpossible that any thing could happen then, and they sent to the\r\nneighbours on both sides to do the like. Thus far they did well: But had\r\nshe obeyed the hint which pressed upon her strangely, not to go to bed,\r\nshe had done much better; for the fire was actually kindled at that very\r\ntime, though not broken out. About an hour after the whole family was in\r\nbed, the house just over the way, directly opposite, was all in flames,\r\nand the wind, which was very high, blowing the flame upon the house this\r\ngentlewoman lived in, so filled it with smoke and fire, in a few\r\nminutes, the street being narrow, that they had not air to breathe, or\r\ntime to do any thing, but jump out of their beds, and save their lives.\r\nHad she obeyed the hint given, and not gone to bed, she might have saved\r\nseveral things; but the few moments she had spared to her, were but just\r\nsufficient to leap out of bed, put some cloathes on, and get down\r\nstairs, for the house was on fire in half a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nWhile I am mentioning these things, methinks it is very hard that we\r\nshould obey the whispers of evil spirits, and not much rather receive\r\nthe notices which good ones are pleased to give. We never perceive the\r\nmisfortune of this, but when in real danger; and then we cry, _My mind\r\nmisgave me when I was going about it_; but if so, why do you fight the\r\ncaution? Why not listen to it as to a voice? and then there had been no\r\nreason to make this complaint.\r\n\r\nI remember about fourteen or fifteen years ago (as to time I cannot be\r\nvery positive) there was a young clergyman in the city of Dublin, in\r\nIreland, who dreamed a very uncommon dream, that a gentleman had killed\r\nhis wife, a relation of his, by stabbing her in several places; the\r\nfright of this awaked him, but finding it a dream, he composed himself\r\nagain to sleep, when he dreamed a second time the same dream. This made\r\nhim a little uneasy; but thinking it proceeded from the impression made\r\non his mind by the former, he went to sleep again, and dreamed the same\r\ndream a third time also. So troubled was he at this, that he arose, and\r\nknocked at his mother's chamber, told his concern, and his apprehensions\r\nthat all was not right at his relation's house. _Dear son_, says the\r\ngood old gentlewoman, _do not mind these foolish dreams; and I very much\r\nwonder, that you, being a person in holy orders, should have regard to\r\nsuch illusions_. Upon this he went to bed again, fell asleep, and\r\ndreamed a fourth time as before. And then indeed he put on his\r\nnight-gown, and went to Smithfield, the place where his relation dwelt.\r\nHere it was, alas! he perceived his dream too sadly fulfilled, by seeing\r\nhis relation the young lady, big with child, who was a Protestant,\r\nstabbed in several places by her barbarous husband, Mr. Eustace, a\r\nviolent Papist, only for some discourses of religion that happened the\r\nday before. After the wretch had stabbed her in three places, he went to\r\nmake his escape out at a window; but she cried out, _My dear! don't\r\nleave me, come back, and I shall be well again_. At which he returned in\r\na hellish rage, and gave her four wounds more; when, even in this\r\ncondition, rising from her bed, she wrapped herself in her night-gown,\r\nand went to the Lord Bishop of Rapho's chamber door (the Bishop lodging\r\nat that time in the house). _My Lord_, said she, _O my Lord, make haste\r\nunto me_; but as soon as his Lordship came, she expired in his arms,\r\nresigning her precious soul into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel\r\nwretch her husband was shot by the pursuers; too good a death for one\r\nwho deserved the gibbet; and the lady was universally lamented by all\r\ntender and religious people. And this tragical relation I have\r\nmentioned, upon the account of that impulse, or dream, that the\r\nclergyman had at the fatal time of the bloody action.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected I should enter upon the subject of apparitions,\r\nand discourse concerning the reality of them; and whether they can\r\nrevisit the place of their former existence, and resume those faculties\r\nof speech and shape as they had when living; but, as these are very\r\ndoubtful matters, I shall only make a few observations upon them.\r\n\r\nI once heard of a man that would allow the reality of apparitions, but\r\nlaid it all upon the devil, thinking that the souls of men departed, or\r\ngood men, did never appear. To this very man something did appear: He\r\nsaid, he saw the shape of an ancient man pass by him in the dusk, who,\r\nholding up his hand in a threatening posture, cried out, _O wicked man,\r\nrepent, repent_. Terrified with this apparition, he consulted several\r\nfriends, who advised him to take the advice. But after all, it was not\r\nan apparition, but a grave and pious gentleman, who met him by mere\r\naccident, and had been sensible of his wickedness; and who never\r\nundeceived him, lest it should hinder his reformation.\r\n\r\nSome people make a very ill use of the general notion, that there are no\r\napparitions nor spirits at all: which is worse than those who fancy they\r\nsee them upon every occasion; for those carry their notions farther,\r\neven to annihilate the devil, and believe nothing about him, neither of\r\none kind or other: the next step they come to, is to conclude, _There is\r\nno God_, and so atheism takes its rise in the same sink, with a\r\ncarelessness about futurity. But there is no occasion to enter upon an\r\nargument to prove the being of the Almighty, or to illustrate his power\r\nby words, who has so many undeniable testimonies in the breasts of every\r\nrational being to prove his existence: and we have sufficient proofs\r\nenough to convince us of the great superintendency of Divine Providence\r\nin the minutest affairs of this world; the manifest existence of the\r\ninvisible world; the reality of spirits, and intelligence between us and\r\nthem. What I have said, I hope, will not mislead any person, or be a\r\nmeans whereby they may delude themselves; for I have spoken of these\r\nthings with the utmost seriousness of mind, and with a sincere and\r\nardent desire for the general good and benefit of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V. _Of suffering Afflictions._\r\n\r\nAfflictions are common to all mankind; and whether they proceed from\r\nlosses, disappointments, or the malice of men, they often bring their\r\nadvantages along with them: For this shews man the vanity and\r\ndeceitfulness of this life, and is an occasion of rectifying our\r\nmeasures, and bringing us to a more modest opinion of ourselves: It\r\ntells us, how necessary the assistance of divine grace is unto us, when\r\nlife itself becomes a burden, and death even desirable: But when the\r\ngreatest oppression comes upon us, we must have recourse to patience,\r\nbegging of God to give us that virtue; and the more composed, we are\r\nunder any trouble, the more commendable is our wisdom, and the larger\r\nwill be our recompense. Let the provocation be what it will, whether\r\nfrom a good-natured and conscientious, or a wicked, perverse, and\r\nvexatious man; all this we should take as from the over-ruling hand of\r\nGod, as a punishment for our sins. Many times injured innocence may be\r\nabused by false oaths, or the power of wicked, jealous, or malicious\r\nmen; but we often find it, like the palm, rise the higher the more it is\r\ndepressed; while the justice of God is eminently remarkable in punishing\r\nthose, one way or other, who desire to endeavour to procure the downfal\r\nof an innocent man: Nor does God fail comforting an afflicted person,\r\nwho with tears and prayers solicits the throne of Heaven for deliverance\r\nand protection. David says, _that his soul was full of trouble, and his\r\nlife drew near unto the grave_. But certainly David's afflictions made\r\nhim eminently remarkable, as particularly when pursued by King Saul, and\r\nhunted as a partridge over the mountains. But one thing which stands by\r\ninnocence, is the love of God; for were we to suffer disgrace, nay, an\r\nignominious death itself, what consolation does our innocence procure at\r\nour latest conflict, our last moments!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI. _Of the immorality of conversation, and the vulgar errors of\r\nbehaviour_.\r\n\r\nAs conversation is a great part of human happiness, so it is a pleasant\r\nsight to behold a sweet tempered man, who is always fit for it; to see\r\nan air of humour and pleasantness sit ever upon his brow, and even\r\nsomething angelic in his very countenance: Whereas, if we observe a\r\ndesigning man, we shall find a mark of involuntary sadness break in upon\r\nhis joy, and a certain insurrection in the soul, the natural concomitant\r\nof profligate principles.\r\n\r\nThey err very much, who think religion, or a strict morality discomposes\r\nthe mind, and renders it unfit for conversation; for it rather inspires\r\nus to innocent mirth, without such a counterfeit joy as vitious men\r\nappear with; and indeed wit is as consistent with religion, as religion\r\nis with good manners; nor is there any thing in the limitation of virtue\r\nand religion that should abate the pleasures of this world, but on the\r\ncontrary rather serves to increase them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many men, by their own vice and intemperance,\r\ndisqualify themselves for conversation. Conversation is immoral, where\r\nthe discourse is undecent, immodest, scandalous, slanderous, and\r\nabusive. How great is their folly, and how much do they expose\r\nthemselves when they affront their best friend, even God himself, who\r\nlaughs at the fool _when his fear cometh?_\r\n\r\nThe great scandal atheistical and immoral discourse gives to virtue,\r\nought, methinks, to be punished by all good magistrates: Make a man once\r\ncease to believe a God, and he has nothing left to limit his soul. How\r\nincongruous is it to government, that a man shall be punished for\r\ndrunkenness, and yet have liberty to affront, and even deny the Majesty\r\nof heaven? When if, even among men, one gives the lie to a gentleman in\r\ncompany, or perhaps speaks an affronting word, a quarrel will ensue, and\r\na combat, and perhaps murder be the consequence: At the least, he, will\r\nprosecute him at law with the utmost virulence and oppression.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be refrained, is obscene discourse, which is the\r\nlanguage only of proficients in debauchery, who never repent, but in a\r\ngaol or hospital; and whose carcases relish no better than their\r\ndiscourse, till the body becomes too nasty for the soul to stay any\r\nlonger in it.\r\n\r\nNor is false talking to be less avoided; for lying is the sheep's\r\nclothing hung upon the wolf's back: It is the Pharisee's prayer, the\r\nwhore's buss, the hypocrite's paint, the murderer's smile, the thief's\r\ncloak; it is Joab's embrace, and Judah's kiss; in a word, it is\r\nmankind's darling sin, and the devil's distinguishing character. Some\r\nadd lies to lies, till it not only comes to be improbable, but even\r\nimpossible too: Others lie for gain to deceive, delude, and betray: And\r\na third lies for sport, or for fun. There are other liars, who are\r\npersonal and malicious; who foment differences, and carry tales from one\r\nhouse to another, in order to gratify their own envious tempers, without\r\nany regard to reverence or truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE HISTORY\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nALEXANDER SELKIRK\r\n\r\n_From the voyage of Captain Woodes Rogers to the South Seas and round\r\nthe World._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn February 1st, 1709, we came before that island,[1] having had a good\r\nobservation the day before, and found our latitude to be 34 degrees 10\r\nminutes south. In the afternoon, we hoisted out our pinnace; and Captain\r\nDover, with the boat's crew, went in her to go ashore, though we could\r\nnot be less that four leagues off. As soon as the pinnace was gone, I\r\nwent on board the Duchess, who admired our boat attempting going ashore\r\nat that distance from land. It was against my inclination: but, to\r\noblige Captain Dover, I let her go: As soon as it was dark, we saw a\r\nlight ashore. Our boat was then about a league off the island, and bore\r\naway for the ship as soon as she saw the lights: We put our lights\r\naboard for the boat, though some were of opinion, the lights we saw were\r\nour boat's lights: But, as night came on, it appeared too large for\r\nthat: We fired our quarter-deck gun, and several muskets, showing lights\r\nin our mizen and fore-shrouds, that our boat might find us whilst we\r\nwere in the lee of the island: About two in the morning our boat came on\r\nboard, having been two hours on board the Duchess, that took them up\r\nastern of us; we were glad they got well off, because it began to blow.\r\nWe were all convinces the light was on the shore, and designed to make\r\nour ships ready to engage, believing them to be French ships at anchor,\r\nand we must either fight them, or want water. All this stir and\r\napprehension arose, as we afterwards found, from one poor naked man, who\r\npassed in our imagination, at present, for a Spanish garrison, a body of\r\nFrenchmen, or a crew of pirates. While we were under these\r\napprehensions, we stood on the backside of the island, in order to fall\r\nin with the southerly wind, till we were past the island; and then we\r\ncame back to it again, and ran close aboard the land that begins to make\r\nthe north-east side.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Juan Fernandez._]\r\n\r\nWe still continued to reason upon this matter; and it is in a manner\r\nincredible, what strange notions many of our people entertained from the\r\nsight of the fire upon the island. It served, however, to show people's\r\ntempers and spirits; and we were able to give a tolerable guess how our\r\nmen would behave, in case there really were any enemies upon the island.\r\nThe flaws came heavy off the shore, and we were forced to reef our\r\ntopsails when we opened the middle bay, where we expected to have found\r\nour enemy; but saw all clear, & no ships, nor in the other bay next the\r\nnorth-east end. These two bays are all that ships ride in, which recruit\r\non this island; but the middle bay is by much the best. We guessed there\r\nhad been ships there, but that they were gone on sight of us. We sent\r\nour yawl ashore about noon, with Captain Dover, Mr. Fry, and six men,\r\nall armed: Mean while we and the Duchess kept turning to get in, and\r\nsuch heavy flaws came off the land, that we were forced to let go our\r\ntop sail sheet, keeping all hands to stand by our sails, for fear of the\r\nwinds carrying them away: But when the flaws were gone, we had little or\r\nno wind. These flaws proceeded from the land; which is very high in the\r\nmiddle of the island. Our boat did not return; we sent our pinnace with\r\nthe men armed, to see what was the occasion of the yawl's stay; for we\r\nwere afraid, that the Spaniards had a garrison there, and might have\r\nseized them. We put out a signal for our boat, and the Duchess showed a\r\nFrench ensign. Immediately our pinnace returned from the shore, and\r\nbrought abundance of cry-fish, with a man clothed in goats skins, who\r\nlooked wilder than the first owners of them. He had been on the island\r\nfour years and four months, being left there by Captain Stradling in the\r\nCinque-ports, his name was Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who had been\r\nmaster of the Cinque-ports, a ship that came here last with Captain\r\nDampier, who told me, that this was the best man in her. I immediately\r\nagreed with him to be a mate on board our ship: It was he that made the\r\nfire last night when he saw our ships, which he judged to be English.\r\nDuring his stay here he saw several ships pass by, but only two came in\r\nto anchors: As he went to view them; he found them to be Spaniards, and\r\nretired from them, upon which they shot at him: Had they been French, he\r\nwould have submitted; but choose to risque his dying alone on the\r\nisland, rather than fall into the hands of Spaniards in these parts;\r\nbecause he apprehended they would murder him, or make a slave of him in\r\nthe mines; for he feared they would spare no stranger that might be\r\ncapable of discovering the South Seas.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards had landed, before he knew what they were; and they came\r\nso near him, that he had much ado to escape; for they not only shot at\r\nhim, but pursued him to the woods, where he climbed to the top of a\r\ntree, at the foot of which they made water, and killed several goats\r\njust by, but went off again without discovering him. He told us that he\r\nwas born at Largo, in the county of Fife, in Scotland, and was bred a\r\nsailor from his youth. The reason of his being left here was difference\r\nbetween him and his captain; which together with the ship's being leaky,\r\nmade him willing rather to stay here, than go along with him at first;\r\nbut when he was at last willing to go, the captain would not receive\r\nhim. He had been at the island before, to wood and water, when two of\r\nthe ship's company were left upon it for six mouths, till the Ship\r\nreturned, being chased thence by two French South-sea ships. He had with\r\nhim his cloaths and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets and\r\ntobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a bible, some practical pieces,\r\nand his mathematical instruments and books. He diverted and provided for\r\nhimself as well as he could; but for the first eight months, had much\r\nado to bear up against melancholy, and the terror of being left alone in\r\nsuch a desolate place. He built two huts with pimento trees, covered\r\nthem with long grass, & lined them with the skins of goats, which be\r\nkilled with his gun as he wanted, so long as his powder lasted, which\r\nwas but a pound; and that being almost spent, he got fire by rubbing two\r\nsticks of pimento-wood together upon his knee. In the lesser hut, at\r\nsome distance from the other, he dressed his victuals; and in the larger\r\nhe slept; and employed himself in reading, singing psalms, and praying;\r\nso that he said. He was a better Christian, while in this solitude, than\r\never he was before, or than, he was afraid, he would ever be again.\r\n\r\nAt first he never ate anything till hunger constrained him, partly for\r\ngrief, and partly for want of bread and salt: Nor did he go to bed, till\r\nhe could watch no longer; the pimento-wood, which burnt very clear,\r\nserved him both for fire and candle, and refreshed him with its fragrant\r\nsmell. He might have had fish enough, but would not eat them for want of\r\nsalt, because they occasioned a looseness, except crayfish which are as\r\nlarge as our lobsters, and very good: These he sometimes boiled, and at\r\nother times broiled, as he did his goat's flesh, of, which he made very\r\ngood broth, for they are not so rank as ours: he kept an account of 500\r\nthat he killed while there, and caught as many more, which he marked on\r\nthe ear, and let go. When, his powder failed, he took them by speed of\r\nfeet; for his way of living, continual exercise of walking and running\r\ncleared him of all gross humours; so that he ran with wonderful\r\nswiftness through the woods, and up the rocks and hills, as we perceived\r\nwhen we employed him to catch goats for us; We had a bull dog, which we\r\nlent with several of our nimblest runners, to help him in catching\r\ngoats; but he distanced and tired both the dog and the men, caught the\r\ngoats, and brought them to us on his back.\r\n\r\nHe told us, that his agility in pursuing a goat had once like to have\r\ncost him his life; he pursued it with so much eagerness, that he catched\r\nhold of it on the brink of a precipiece, of which he was not aware, the\r\nbushes hiding it from him; so, that he fell with the goat down the\r\nprecipiece; a great height, and was to stunned and bruised with the\r\nfall, that he narrowly escaped with his life; and, when he came to his\r\nsenses, found the goat dead under him: He lay there about twenty-four\r\nhours, and was scarce able to crawl to his hut, which was about a mile\r\ndistant, or to stir abroad again in ten days.\r\n\r\nHe came at last to relish his meat well enough without salt or bread;\r\nand, in the season had plenty of good turreps, which had been sewed\r\nthere by Captain Dampier's men, and have now overspread some acres of\r\nground. He had enough of good cabbage from the cabbage-trees, and\r\nseasoned his meat with the fruit of the pimento trees, which is the same\r\nas Jamaica pepper, and smells deliciously: He found also a black pepper,\r\ncalled Ma'azeta, which was very good to expel wind, and against gripping\r\nin the guts.\r\n\r\nHe soon wore out all his shoes and clothes by running in the woods; and\r\nat last, being forced to shift without them, his feet became so hard,\r\nthat he ran everywhere without difficulty; and it was some time before\r\nhe could wear shoes after we found him; for not being used to any so\r\nlong, his feet swelled when he came first to wear them again.\r\n\r\nAfter he had conquered his melancholy, he diverted himself sometimes\r\nwith cutting his name in the trees, and the time of his being left, and\r\ncontinuance there. He was at first much pestered with cats and rats,\r\nthat bred in great numbers, from some of each species which had got\r\nashore from ships that put in there to wood and water: The rats gnawed\r\nhis feet and cloathes whilst asleep, which obliged him to cherish the\r\ncats with his goats flesh, by which many of them became so tame, that\r\nthey would lie about him in hundreds, and soon delivered him from the\r\nrats: He likewise tamed some kids; and, to divert himself would, now and\r\nthen, sing and dance with them, and his cats: So that by the favour of\r\nProvidence, and vigour of his youth, being now but thirty years old, he\r\ncame, at last, to conquer all the inconveniencies of his solitude, and\r\nto be very easy.\r\n\r\nWhen his cloathes were worn out, he made himself a coat and a cap of\r\ngoat-skins, which he stiched together with little thongs of the same,\r\nthat he cut with his knife, He had no other needle but a nail; and, when\r\nhis knife was worn to the back, he made others, as well as he could, of\r\nsome iron hoops that were left ashore, which he beat thin, and ground\r\nupon stones. Having some linnen cloth by him, he sewed him some shirts\r\nwith a nail, and stiched them with the worsted of his old stockings,\r\nwhich he pulled out on purpose. He had his last shirt on, when we found\r\nhim in the island.\r\n\r\nAt his first coming on board us, he had so much forgot his language, for\r\nwant of use, that we could scarce understand him: for he seemed to speak\r\nhis words by halve. We offered him a dram: but he would not touch it;\r\nhaving drank nothing but water since his being there; And it was\r\nsometime before he could relish our victuals. He could give us an\r\naccount of no other product of the island, than what we have mentioned,\r\nexcept some black plums, which are very good, but hard to come at, the\r\ntrees, which bear them, growing on high mountains and rocks.\r\nPimento-trees are plenty here, and we saw some of sixty feet high and\r\nabout two yards thick; and cotton-trees higher, and near four fathoms\r\nround in the stock. The climate is so good that the trees and grass are\r\nverdant all the year round. The winter lasts no longer than June and\r\nJuly, and is not then severe, there being only a small frost, and a\r\nlittle hail: but sometimes great rains. The heat of the summer is\r\nequally moderate; and there is not much thunder, or tempestuous weather\r\nof any sort. He saw no venomous or savage creature on the island, nor\r\nany sort of beasts but goats, the first of which had been put ashore\r\nhere, on purpose for a breed, by Juan Fernandez, a Spaniard, who settled\r\nthere with some families, till the continent of Chili began to submit to\r\nthe Spaniards; which, being more profitable; tempted them to quit this\r\nisland, capable however, of maintaining a good number of people, and\r\nbeing made so strong, that they could hot be easily dislodged from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\nFebruary 3d we got our smith's forge on shore, set our coopers to work,\r\nand made a little tent for me to have the benefit of the air. The\r\nDuchess had also a tent for their sick men; so that we had a small town\r\nof our own here, and every body employed. A few men supplied us all with\r\nfish of several sorts, all very good, in such abundance, that, in a few\r\nhours, we could take as many as would serve 200. There were sea-fowls in\r\nthe bay, as large as geese: but eat fishy. The governor never failed of\r\nprocuring us two or three goats a day for our sick men; by which, with\r\nthe help of the greens, and the wholesome air, they recovered very soon\r\nof the scurvy; so that Captain Dover and I thought it a very agreeable\r\nseat, the weather being neither too hot nor too cold. We spent our time,\r\ntill the 10th, in refitting our ships, taking wood on board; and laying\r\nin water, that which we brought from England and St. Vincent being\r\nspoiled by the badness of the casks. We likewise boiled up about eighty\r\ngallons of sea-lions oil, as we might have done several tons, had we\r\nbeen provided with vessels. We refined it for our lamps, to save\r\ncandles. The sailors sometimes use it to fry their meat, for want of\r\nbutter, and find it agreeable enough. The men who worked on our\r\nrigging, eat young seals, which they preferred to our ships victuals, &\r\nsaid it was as good as English lamb, though I should have been glad of\r\nsuch an exchange. We made what haste we could to get all the necessaries\r\non board, being willing to lose no time; for we were informed at the\r\nCanaries, that five stout French ships were coming together to those\r\nseas.",
