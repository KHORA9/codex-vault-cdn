Comparative Anatomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary influence which the Theory of Descent must exercise\r\nupon all sciences, will in all probability affect no branch of science,\r\nexcepting Anthropology, so much as the descriptive portion of natural\r\nhistory, that which is known as systematic Zoology and Botany. Most\r\nnaturalists who have hitherto occupied themselves with arranging the\r\ndifferent systems of animals and plants, have collected, named, and\r\narranged the different species of these natural bodies with much the\r\nsame interest as antiquarians and ethnographers collect the weapons and\r\nutensils of different nations. Many have not even risen above the degree\r\nof intelligence with which people usually collect, label, and arrange\r\ncrests, stamps, and similar curiosities. In the same manner as some\r\ncollectors find their pleasure in the similarity of forms, the beauty or\r\nrarity of the crests or stamps, and admire in them the inventive art of\r\nman, so many naturalists take a delight in the manifold forms of animals\r\nand plants, and marvel at the rich imagination of the Creator, at His\r\nunwearied creative activity, and at His curious fancy for forming, by\r\nthe side of so many beautiful and useful organisms, also a number of\r\nugly and useless ones.\r\n\r\nThis childlike treatment of systematic Zoology and Botany is completely\r\nannihilated by the Theory of Descent. In the place of the superficial\r\nand playful interest with which most naturalists have hitherto regarded\r\norganic structures, we now have the much higher interest of the\r\nintelligent understanding which detects in the _related forms_ of\r\norganisms their true _blood relationships_. The _Natural System of\r\nanimals and plants_, which was formerly valued either only as a registry\r\nof names, to facilitate the survey of the different forms, or as a table\r\nof contents for the short expression of their degrees of similarity,\r\nreceives from the Theory of Descent the incomparably higher value of a\r\ntrue _pedigree of organisms_. This pedigree is to disclose to us the\r\ngenealogical connection of the smaller and larger groups. It has to show\r\nus in what way the different classes, orders, families, genera, and\r\nspecies of the animal and vegetable kingdoms correspond with the\r\ndifferent branches, twigs, and groups of twigs of the pedigree. Every\r\nwider and higher category or stage of the system (for example a class,\r\nor an order) comprises a number of larger and stronger branches of the\r\npedigree; every narrower and lower category (for example a genus, or a\r\nspecies) only a smaller and thinner group of twigs. It is only when we\r\nthus view the natural system as a pedigree that we perceive its true\r\nvalue. (Gen. Morph. ii. Plate XVII. p. 397.)\r\n\r\nSince we hold fast this genealogical conception of the Organic System,\r\nto which alone undoubtedly the future of classificatory Zoology and\r\nBotany belongs, we should now turn our attention to one of the most\r\nessential, but also one of the most difficult, tasks of the\r\n“non-miraculous history of creation,” namely, to the actual construction\r\nof the Organic Pedigree. Let us see how far we are already able to point\r\nout all the different organic forms as the divergent descendants of a\r\nsingle or of some few common original forms. But how can we construct\r\nthe actual pedigree of the animal and vegetable group of forms from our\r\nknowledge of them, at present so scanty and fragmentary? The answer to\r\nthis question lies in what we have already remarked of the parallelism\r\nof the three series of development—in the important causal relation\r\nwhich connects the palæontological development of all organic tribes\r\nwith the embryological development of individuals, and with the\r\nsystematic development of groups.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish our task we shall first have to direct our\r\nattention to _palæontology_, or _the science of petrifactions_. For if\r\nthe Theory of Descent is really true, if the petrified remains of\r\nformerly living animals and plants really proceed from the extinct\r\nprimæval ancestors and progenitors of the present organisms, then,\r\nwithout anything else, the knowledge and comparison of petrifactions\r\nought to disclose to us the pedigree of organisms. However simple and\r\nclear this may seem in theory, the task becomes extremely hard and\r\ncomplicated when it is actually taken in hand. Its practical solution\r\nwould be very difficult even if the petrifactions were to any extent\r\ncompletely preserved. But this is by no means the case. The obvious\r\nrecords of creation which lie buried in petrifactions are imperfect\r\nbeyond all measure. Hence it is necessary critically to examine these\r\nrecords, and to determine the value which petrifactions possess for the\r\nhistory of the development of organic tribes. As I have previously\r\ndiscussed the general importance of petrifactions as the records of\r\ncreation, when we were considering Cuvier’s merits in the science of\r\nfossils, we may now at once examine the conditions and circumstances\r\nunder which the remains of organic bodies became petrified and preserved\r\nin a more or less recognizable form.\r\n\r\nAs a rule we find petrifactions or fossils enclosed only in those stones\r\nwhich have been deposited in layers as mud by water, and which are on\r\nthat account called neptunic, stratified, or sedimentary rocks. The\r\ndeposition of such strata could of course only commence after the\r\ncondensation of watery vapour into liquid water had taken place in the\r\ncourse of the earth’s history. After that period, which we considered in\r\nour last chapter, not only did life begin on the earth, but also an\r\nuninterrupted and exceedingly important transformation of the rigid\r\ninorganic crust of the earth. The water began that extremely important\r\nmechanical action by which the surface of the earth is perpetually,\r\nthough slowly, transformed. I may surely presume that it is generally\r\nknown what an extremely important influence, in this respect, is even\r\nyet exercised by water at every moment. As it falls down as rain,\r\ntrickling through the upper strata of the earth’s crust, and flowing\r\ndown from heights into hollows, it chemically dissolves different\r\nmineral parts of the ground, and mechanically washes away the loose\r\nparticles. In flowing down from mountains water carries their debris\r\ninto the plains, or deposits it as mud in stagnant lakes. Thus it\r\ncontinually works at lowering mountains and filling up valleys. In like\r\nmanner the breakers of the sea work uninterruptedly at the destruction\r\nof the coasts and at filling up the bottom of the sea with the debris\r\nthey wash down. The action of water alone, if it were not counteracted\r\nby other circumstances, would in time level the whole earth. There can\r\nbe no doubt that the mountain masses—which are annually carried down as\r\nmud into the sea, and deposited on its floor—are so great that in the\r\ncourse of a longer or shorter period, say a few millions of years, the\r\nsurface of the earth would be completely levelled and become enclosed by\r\na continuous sheet of water. That this does not happen is owing to the\r\nperpetual volcanic action of the fiery-fluid centre of the earth. The\r\nsurging of the melted nucleus against the firm crust necessitates\r\ncontinual alternations of elevation and depression on the different\r\nparts of the earth’s surface. These elevations and depressions for the\r\nmost part take place very slowly; but, as they continue for thousands of\r\nyears, by the combined effect of small, interrupted movements, they\r\nproduce results no less grand than does the counteracting and levelling\r\naction of water.\r\n\r\nSince the elevations and depressions of the different parts of the\r\nearth alternate with one another in the course of millions of years,\r\nfirst this and then that part of the earth’s surface is above or below\r\nthe level of the sea. I have already given examples of this in the\r\npreceding chapter (vol. i. p. 361). Hence, in all probability, there is\r\nno part of the outer crust of the earth which has not been repeatedly\r\nabove and also below the level of the sea. This repeated change explains\r\nthe variety and the different composition of the numerous neptunic\r\nstrata of rocks, which in most places have been deposited one above\r\nanother in considerable thickness. In the different periods of the\r\nearth’s history during which these deposits took place there lived\r\nvarious and different populations of animals and plants. When their dead\r\nbodies sank to the bottom of the waters, the forms of the bodies\r\nimpressed themselves upon the soft mud, and imperishable parts, such as\r\nhard bones, teeth, shells, etc., became enclosed in it uninjured. These\r\nwere preserved in the mud, which condensed them into neptunic rock, and\r\nas petrifactions they now serve to characterise the respective strata.\r\nBy a careful comparison of the different strata lying one above another,\r\nand the petrifactions preserved in them, it has become possible to\r\ndecide the relative age of the strata and groups of strata, and to\r\nestablish, by direct observation, the principal eras of phylogeny, that\r\nis to say, the stages in history of the development of animal and\r\nvegetable tribes.\r\n\r\nThe different strata of neptunic rocks deposited one above another,\r\nwhich are composed in very various ways of limestone, clay, and sand,\r\ngeologists have grouped together into an ideal System or Series, which\r\ncorresponds with the whole course of the organic history of the earth,\r\nor with that portion of the earth’s history during which organic life\r\nexisted. Just as so-called “universal history” falls into larger and\r\nsmaller periods, which are characterized by the conditions of\r\ndevelopment of the most important nations at the respective epochs, and\r\nare separated from one another by great events, so we also divide the\r\ninfinitely longer organic history of the earth into a series of greater\r\nand less periods. Each of these periods is distinguished by a\r\ncharacteristic flora and fauna, and by the specially strong development\r\nof certain vegetable or animal groups, and each is separated from the\r\npreceding and succeeding period by a striking change in the character of\r\nits animal and vegetable inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the following survey of the historical course of\r\ndevelopment which the large animal and vegetable tribes have passed\r\nthrough, it will be desirable to say a few words first as to the\r\nsystematic classification of the neptunic groups of strata, and the\r\nlarger and smaller periods corresponding to them. As will be seen\r\ndirectly, we are able to divide the whole of the sedimentary rocks lying\r\none above another into five main groups or periods, each period into\r\nseveral subordinate groups of strata or _systems_, and each system of\r\nstrata again into still smaller groups or _formations_; finally, each\r\nformation can again be divided into stages or sub-formations, and each\r\nof these again into still smaller layers or beds. Each of the five great\r\nrock-groups was deposited during a great division of the earth’s\r\nhistory, during a long _era_ or _epoch_; each system during a shorter\r\n_period_; each formation during a still shorter _period_. In thus\r\nreducing the periods of the organic history of the earth, and the\r\nneptunic strata containing petrifactions deposited during those periods\r\ninto a connected system, we proceed exactly like the historian who\r\ndivides the history of nations into the three main divisions of\r\nAntiquity, the Middle Ages, and Modern Times, and each of those sections\r\nagain into subordinate periods and epochs. But the historian by this\r\nsharp systematic division, and by fixing the boundary of the periods by\r\nparticular dates, only seeks to facilitate his survey, and in no way\r\nmeans to deny the uninterrupted connection of events and the development\r\nof nations. Exactly the same qualification applies to our systematic\r\ndivision, specification, or classification of the organic history of the\r\nearth. Here, too, a continuous thread runs through the series of events\r\nunbroken. We must therefore distinctly protest against the idea that by\r\nsharply bounding the larger and smaller groups of strata, and the\r\nperiods corresponding with them, we in any way wish to adopt Cuvier’s\r\ndoctrine of terrestrial revolutions, and of repeated new creations of\r\norganic populations. That this erroneous doctrine has long since been\r\ncompletely refuted by Lyell, I have already mentioned. (Compare vol. i.\r\np. 127.)\r\n\r\nThe five great main divisions of the organic history of the earth, or\r\nthe palæontological history of development, we call the primordial,\r\nprimary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary epochs. Each is distinctly\r\ncharacterized by the predominating development of certain animal and\r\nvegetable groups in it, and we might accordingly symbolically designate\r\nthe five epochs, on the one hand by the names of the groups of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and on the other hand by those of the different\r\nclasses of vertebrate animals. In this case the _first_, or primordial\r\nepoch, would be the era of the Tangles (Algæ) and skull-less\r\nVertebrates; the _second_, or primary epoch, that of the Ferns and\r\nFishes; the _third_, or secondary epoch, that of Pine Forests and\r\nReptiles; the _fourth_, or tertiary epoch, that of Foliaceous Forests\r\nand of Mammals; finally, the _fifth_, or quaternary epoch, the era of\r\nMan, and his Civilization. The divisions or _periods_ which we\r\ndistinguish in each of the five _long eras_ (p. 14) are determined by\r\nthe different _systems_ of strata into which each of the five great\r\n_rock-groups_ is divided (p. 15). We shall now take a cursory glance at\r\nthe series of these systems, and at the same time at the populations of\r\nthe five great epochs.\r\n\r\nThe first and longest division of the organic history of the earth is\r\nformed by the _primordial epoch_, or _the era of the Tangle Forests_. It\r\ncomprises the immense period from the first spontaneous generation, from\r\nthe origin of the first terrestrial organism, to the end of the Silurian\r\nsystem of deposits. During this immeasurable space of time, which in all\r\nprobability was much longer than all the other four epochs taken\r\ntogether, the three most extensive of all the neptunic systems of strata\r\nwere deposited, namely, the _Laurentian_, upon that the _Cambrian_, and\r\nupon that the _Silurian_ system. The approximate thickness or size of\r\nthese three systems together amounts to 70,000 feet. Of these about\r\n30,000 belong to the Laurentian, 18,000 to the Cambrian, and 22,000 to\r\nthe Silurian system. The average thickness of all the four other rock\r\ngroups, the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, taken\r\ntogether, may amount at most to 60,000 feet; and from this fact alone,\r\napart from many other reasons, it is evident that the duration of the\r\nprimordial period was probably much longer than the duration of all the\r\nsubsequent periods down to the present day. Many thousands of millions\r\nof years were required to deposit such masses of strata. Unfortunately,\r\nby far the largest portion of the primordial group of strata is in the\r\nmetamorphic state (which we shall directly explain), and consequently\r\nthe petrifactions contained in them—the most ancient and most important\r\nof all—have, to a great extent, been destroyed and become\r\nunrecognisable. Only in one portion of the Cambrian strata have\r\npetrifactions been preserved in a recognizable condition and in large\r\nquantities. The most ancient of all distinctly preserved petrifactions\r\nhas been found in the lowest Laurentian strata (in the Ottawa\r\nformation), which I shall afterwards have to speak of as the “Canadian\r\nLife’s-dawn” (Eozoon canadense).\r\n\r\nAlthough only by far the smaller portion of the primordial or\r\narchilithic petrifactions are preserved to us in a recognizable\r\ncondition, still they possess the value of inestimable documents of the\r\nmost ancient and obscure times of the organic history of the earth. What\r\nseems to be shown by them, in the first place, is that during the whole\r\nof this immense period there existed only inhabitants of the waters. As\r\nyet, at any rate, among all archilithic petrifactions, not a single one\r\nhas been found which can with certainty be regarded as an organism which\r\nhas lived on land. All the vegetable remains we possess of the\r\nprimordial period belong to the lowest of all groups of plants, to the\r\nclass of Tangles or Algæ, living in water. In the warm primæval sea,\r\nthese constituted the forests of the period, of the richness of which in\r\nforms and density we may form an approximate idea from their present\r\ndescendants, the tangle forests of the Atlantic Sargasso sea. The\r\ncolossal tangle forests of the archilithic period supplied the place of\r\nthe forest vegetation of the mainland, which was then utterly wanting.\r\nAll the animals, also, whose remains have been found in archilithic\r\nstrata, like the plants, lived in water. Only crustacea are met with\r\namong the animals with articulated feet, as yet no spiders and no\r\ninsects. Of vertebrate animals, only a very few remains of fishes are\r\nknown as having been found in the most recent of all primordial strata,\r\nin the upper Silurian. But the headless vertebrate animals, which we\r\ncall _skull-less_, or _Acrania_, and out of which fishes must have been\r\ndeveloped, we suppose to have lived in great numbers during the\r\nprimordial epoch. Hence we may call it after the _Acrania_ as well as\r\nafter the _Tangles_.\r\n\r\nThe _primary epoch_, or _the era of Fern Forests_, the second main\r\ndivision of the organic history of the earth, which is also called the\r\npalæolithic or palæozoic period, lasted from the end of the Silurian\r\nformation of strata to the end of the Permian formation. This epoch was\r\nalso of very long duration, and again falls into three shorter periods,\r\nduring which three great systems of strata were deposited, namely,\r\nfirst, the _Devonian_ system, or the old red sandstone; upon that, the\r\n_Carboniferous_, or coal system; and upon this, the _Permian_ system.\r\nThe average thickness of these three systems taken together may amount\r\nto about 42,000 feet, from which we may infer the immense length of time\r\nrequisite for their formation.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian and Permian formations are especially rich in remains of\r\nfishes, of primæval fish as well as enamelled fish (Ganoids), but the\r\nbony fish (Teleostei) are absent from the strata of the primary epoch.\r\nIn coal are found the most ancient remains of animals living on land,\r\nboth of articulated animals (spiders and insects) as well as of\r\nvertebrate animals (amphibious animals, like newts and frogs). In the\r\nPermian system there occur, in addition to the amphibious animals, the\r\nmore highly-developed reptiles, and, indeed, forms nearly related to our\r\nlizards (Proterosaurus, etc.). But, nevertheless, we may call the\r\nprimary epoch that of _Fishes_, because these few amphibious animals and\r\nreptiles are insignificant in comparison with the immense mass of\r\npalæozoic fishes. Just as Fishes predominate over the other vertebrate\r\nanimals, so _Ferns_, or Filices, predominate among the plants of this\r\nepoch, and, in fact, real ferns and tree ferns (leafed ferns, or\r\nPhylopteridæ), as well as bamboo ferns (Calamophytæ) and scaled ferns\r\n(Lepidophytæ). These ferns, which grew on land, formed the chief part of\r\nthe dense palæolithic island forests, the fossil remains of which are\r\npreserved to us in the enormously large strata of coal of the\r\nCarboniferous system, and in the smaller strata of coal of the Devonian\r\nand Permian systems. We are thus justified in calling the primary epoch\r\neither the era of _Ferns_ or that of _Fishes_.\r\n\r\nThe third great division of the palæontological history of development\r\nis formed by the _secondary epoch_, or the _era of Pine Forests_, which\r\nis also called the mesolithic or mesozoic epoch. It extends from the end\r\nof the Permian system to the end of the Chalk formation, and is again\r\ndivided into three great periods. The stratified systems deposited\r\nduring this period are, first and lowest, the _Triassic_ system, in the\r\nmiddle the _Jura_ system, and at the top the _Cretaceous_ system. The\r\naverage thickness of these three systems taken together is much less\r\nthan that of the primary group, and amounts as a whole only to about\r\n15,000 feet. The secondary epoch can accordingly in all probability not\r\nhave been half so long as the primary epoch.\r\n\r\nJust as Fishes prevailed in the primary epoch, _Reptiles_ predominated\r\nin the secondary epoch over all other vertebrate animals. It is true\r\nthat during this period the first birds and mammals originated; at that\r\ntime, also, there existed important amphibious animals, especially the\r\ngigantic Labyrinthodonts, in the sea the wonderful sea-dragons, or\r\nHalisaurii, swam about, and the first fish with bones were associated\r\nwith the many primæval fishes (Sharks) and enamelled fish (Ganoids) of\r\nthe earlier times; but the very variously developed kinds of reptiles\r\nformed the predominating and characteristic class of vertebrate animals\r\nof the secondary epoch. Besides those reptiles which were very nearly\r\nrelated to the present living lizards, crocodiles, and turtles, there\r\nwere, during the mesolithic period, swarms of grotesquely shaped\r\ndragons. The remarkable flying lizards, or Pterosaurii, and the colossal\r\nland-dragons, or Dinosaurii, of the secondary epoch, are peculiar, as\r\nthey occur neither in the preceding nor in the succeeding epochs. The\r\nsecondary epoch may be called the era of _Reptiles_; but on the other\r\nhand, it may also be called the era of _Pine Forests_, or more\r\naccurately, of the _Gymnosperms_, that is, the epoch of _plants having\r\nnaked seeds_. For this group of plants, especially as represented by the\r\ntwo important classes—the pines, or _Coniferæ_, and the palm-ferns, or\r\n_Cycadeæ_—during the secondary epoch constituted a predominant part of\r\nthe forests. But towards the end of the epoch (in the Chalk period) the\r\nplants of the pine tribe gave place to the leaf-bearing forests which\r\nthen developed for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the Palæontological Periods, or of the Greater Divisions of the\r\nOrganic History of the Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _First Epoch_: ARCHILITHIC ERA. _Primordial Epoch._\r\n\r\n(Era of Skull-less Animals and Forests of Tangles.)\r\n\r\n  1.

This epoch, which is also called\r\nthe cænolithic or cænozoic epoch, extended from the end of the\r\ncretaceous system to the end of the pliocene system. The strata\r\ndeposited during it amount only to a thickness of about 3000 feet, and\r\nconsequently are much inferior to the three first great groups. The\r\nthree systems also into which the tertiary period is subdivided are very\r\ndifficult to distinguish from one another. The oldest of them is called\r\n_eocene_, or old tertiary; the newer _miocene_, or mid tertiary; and the\r\nlast is the _pliocene_, or later tertiary system.\r\n\r\nThe whole population of the tertiary epoch approaches much nearer, on\r\nthe whole as well as in detail, to that of the present time than is the\r\ncase in the preceding epochs. From this time the class of _Mammals_\r\ngreatly predominates over all other vertebrate animals. In like manner,\r\nin the vegetable kingdom, the group—so rich in forms—of the\r\n_Angiosperms_, or _plants with covered seeds_, predominates, and its\r\n_leafy forests_ constitute the characteristic feature of the tertiary\r\nepoch. The group of the Angiosperms consists of the two classes of\r\nsingle-seed-lobed plants, or _Monocotyledons_, and the double-seed-lobed\r\nplants, or _Dicotyledons_. The Angiosperms of both classes had, it is\r\ntrue, made their appearance in the Cretaceous period, and mammals had\r\nalready occurred in the Jurassic period, and even in the Triassic\r\nperiod; but both groups, the mammals and the plants with enclosed seeds,\r\ndid not attain their peculiar development and supremacy until the\r\ntertiary epoch, so that it may justly be called after them.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last main division of the organic history of the earth is\r\nthe _quaternary epoch, or era of Civilization_, which in comparison with\r\nthe length of the four other epochs almost vanishes into nothing, though\r\nwith a comical conceit we usually call its record the “history of the\r\nworld.” As the period is characterized by the development of _Man_ and\r\nhis _Culture_, which has influenced the organic world more powerfully\r\nand with greater transforming effect than have all previous conditions,\r\nit may also be called the era of Man, the anthropolithic or anthropozoic\r\nperiod. It might also be called the era of Cultivated Forests, or\r\nGardens, because even at the lowest stage of human civilization man’s\r\ninfluence is already perceptible in the utilization of forests and their\r\nproducts, and therefore also in the physiognomy of the landscape. The\r\ncommencement of this era, which extends down to the present time, is\r\ngeologically bounded by the end of the pliocene stratification.\r\n\r\nThe neptunic strata which have been deposited during the comparatively\r\nshort quaternary epoch are very different in different parts of the\r\nearth, but they are mostly of very slight thickness. They are reduced to\r\ntwo “systems,” the older of which is designated the _diluvial_, or\r\n_pleistocene_, and the later the _alluvial_, or _recent_. The diluvial\r\nsystem is again divided into two “formations,” the older _glacial_ and\r\nthe more recent _post glacial_ formations. For during the older diluvial\r\nperiod there occurred that extremely remarkable decrease of the\r\ntemperature of the earth which led to an extensive glaciation of the\r\ntemperate zones. The great importance which this “ice” or “glacial\r\nperiod” has exercised on the geographical and topographical distribution\r\nof organisms has already been explained in the preceding chapter (vol.\r\ni. p. 365). But the _post glacial period_, or the more recent diluvial\r\nperiod, during which the temperature again increased and the ice\r\nretreated towards the poles, was also highly important in regard to the\r\npresent state of chorological relations.\r\n\r\nThe biological characteristic of the quaternary epoch lies essentially\r\nin the development and dispersion of the human organism and his culture.\r\nMan has acted with a greater transforming, destructive, and modifying\r\ninfluence upon the animal and vegetable population of the earth than any\r\nother organism. For this reason, and not because we assign to man a\r\nprivileged exceptional position in nature in other matters, we may with\r\nfull justice designate the development of man and his civilization as\r\nthe beginning of a special and last main division of the organic history\r\nof the earth. It is probable indeed that the corporeal development of\r\nprimæval man out of man-like apes took place as far back as the earlier\r\npliocene period, perhaps even in the miocene tertiary period. But the\r\nactual development of _human speech_, which we look upon as the most\r\npowerful agency in the development of the peculiar characteristics of\r\nman and his dominion over other organisms, probably belongs to that\r\nperiod which on geological grounds is distinguished from the preceding\r\npliocene period as the pleistocene or diluvial. In fact the time which\r\nhas elapsed from the development of human speech down to the present\r\nday, though it may comprise many thousands and perhaps hundreds of\r\nthousands of years, almost vanishes into nothing as compared with the\r\nimmeasurable length of the periods which have passed from the beginning\r\nof organic life on the earth down to the origin of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe tabular view given on page 15 shows the succession of the\r\npalæontological rock-groups, systems, and formations, that is, the\r\nlarger and smaller neptunic groups of strata, which contain\r\npetrifactions, from the uppermost, or Alluvial, down to the lowest, or\r\nLaurentian, deposits. The table on page 14 presents the historical\r\ndivision of the corresponding eras of the larger and smaller\r\npalæontological periods, and in a reversed succession, from the most\r\nancient Laurentian up to the most recent Quaternary period.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to make an approximate calculation of the\r\nnumber of thousands of years constituting these periods. The thickness\r\nof the strata has been compared, which, according to experience, is\r\ndeposited during a century, and which amounts only to some few lines or\r\ninches, with the whole thickness of the stratified masses of rock, the\r\nsuccession of which we have just surveyed. This thickness, on the whole,\r\nmay on an average amount to about 130,000 feet; of these 70,000 belong\r\nto the primordial, or archilithic; 42,000 to the primary, or\r\npalæolithic; 15,000 to the secondary, or mesolithic; and finally only\r\n3,000 to the tertiary, or cænolithic group. The very small and scarcely\r\nappreciable thickness of the quaternary, or anthropolithic deposit\r\ncannot here come into consideration at all. On an average, it may at\r\nmost be computed as from 500 to 700 feet. But it is self evident that\r\nall these measurements have only an average and approximate value, and\r\nare meant to give only a rough survey of the _relative_ proportion of\r\nthe systems of strata and of the spaces of time corresponding with them.\r\n\r\nNow, if we divide the whole period of the organic history of the\r\nearth—that is, from the beginning of life on the earth down to the\r\npresent day—into a hundred equal parts, and if then, corresponding to\r\nthe thickness of the systems of strata, we calculate the relative\r\nduration of the time of the five main divisions or periods according to\r\npercentages, we obtain the following result:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Archilithic, or primordial period       53.6\r\n   II. Palæolithic, or primary period          32.1\r\n  III. Mesolithic, or secondary period         11.5\r\n   IV. Cænolithic, or tertiary period           2.3\r\n    V. Anthropolithic, or quaternary period     0.5\r\n                                              -----\r\n                                      Total   100.0\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to this, the length of the archilithic period, during which no\r\nland-living animals or plants as yet existed, amounts to more than one\r\nhalf, more than 53 per cent.; on the other hand the length of the\r\nanthropolithic era, during which man has existed, amounts to scarcely\r\none-half per cent. of the whole length of the organic history of the\r\nearth. It is, however, quite impossible to calculate the length of these\r\nperiods, even approximately, by years.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the strata of mud at present deposited during a\r\ncentury, and which has been used as a basis for this calculation, is of\r\ncourse quite different in different parts of the earth under the\r\ndifferent conditions in which these deposits take place. It is very\r\nslight at the bottom of the deep sea, in the beds of broad rivers with a\r\nshort course, and in inland seas which receive very scanty supplies of\r\nwater. It is comparatively great on the sea-shores exposed to strong\r\nbreakers, at the estuaries of large rivers with long courses, and in\r\ninland seas with copious supplies of water. At the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, which carries with it a considerable amount of mud, in the\r\ncourse of 100,000 years about 600 feet would be deposited. At the bottom\r\nof the open sea, far away from the coasts, during this long period only\r\nsome few feet of mud would be deposited. Even on the sea-shores where a\r\ncomparatively large quantity of mud is deposited the thickness of the\r\nstrata formed during the course of a century may after all amount to no\r\nmore than a few inches or lines when condensed into solid stone. In any\r\ncase, however, all calculations based upon these comparisons are very\r\nunsafe, and we cannot even approximately conceive the enormous length of\r\nthe periods which were requisite for the formation of the systems of\r\nneptunic strata. Here we can apply only relative, not absolute,\r\nmeasurements of time.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we should entirely err were we to consider the size of these\r\nsystems of strata alone as the measure of the actual space of time which\r\nhas elapsed during the earth’s history. For the elevations and\r\ndepressions of the earth’s crust have perpetually alternated with one\r\nanother, and the mineralogical and palæontological difference—which is\r\nperceived between each two succeeding systems of strata, and between\r\neach two of their formations at any particular spot—corresponds in all\r\nprobability with a considerable intermediate space of many thousands of\r\nyears, during which that particular part of the earth’s crust was raised\r\nabove the water. It was only after the lapse of this intermediate\r\nperiod, when a new depression again laid the part in question under\r\nwater, that there occurred a new deposit of earth. As, in the mean time,\r\nthe inorganic and organic conditions on this part had undergone a\r\nconsiderable transformation, the newly-formed layer of mud was\r\nnecessarily composed of different earthy constituents and enclosed\r\ndifferent petrifactions.\r\n\r\n  IV.

Such alternating elevations and depressions take place\r\neven now extensively, and are ascribed to the heaving of the fiery fluid\r\nnucleus against the rigid crust. Thus, for example, the coast of Sweden\r\nand a portion of the west coast of South America are constantly though\r\nslowly rising, while the coast of Holland and a portion of the east\r\ncoast of South America are gradually sinking. The rising as well as the\r\nsinking takes place very slowly, and in the course of a century\r\nsometimes only amounts to some few lines, sometimes to a few inches, or\r\nat most a few feet. But if this action continues uninterruptedly\r\nthroughout hundreds of thousands of years it is capable of forming the\r\nhighest mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that elevations and depressions, such as now can be\r\nmeasured in these places, have uninterruptedly alternated one with\r\nanother in different places during the whole course of the organic\r\nhistory of the earth. This may be inferred with certainty from the\r\ngeographical distribution of organisms. (Compare vol. i. p. 350.) But to\r\nform a judgment of our palæontological records of creation it is\r\nextremely important to show that permanent strata can only be deposited\r\nduring a slow sinking of the ground under water, but not during its\r\ncontinued rising. When the ground slowly sinks more and more below the\r\nlevel of the sea, the deposited layers of mud get into continually\r\ndeeper and quieter water, where they can become condensed into stone\r\nundisturbed. But when, on the other hand, the ground slowly rises, the\r\nnewly-deposited layers of mud, which enclose the remains of plants and\r\nanimals, again immediately come within the reach of the play of the\r\nwaves, and are soon worn away by the force of the breakers, together\r\nwith the organic remains which they on close. For this simple but very\r\nimportant reason, therefore, abundant layers, in which organic remains\r\nare preserved, can only be deposited during a continuous sinking of the\r\nground. When any two different formations or strata, lying one above the\r\nother, correspond with two different periods of depression, we must\r\nassume a long period of rising between them, of which period we know\r\nnothing, because no fossil remains of the then living animals and plants\r\ncould be preserved. It is evident, however, that those _periods of\r\nelevation_, which have passed without leaving any trace behind them,\r\ndeserve a no less careful consideration than the greater or less\r\nalternating _periods of depression_, of whose organic population we can\r\nform an approximate idea from the strata containing petrifactions.\r\nProbably the former were not of shorter duration than the latter.\r\n\r\nFrom this alone it is apparent how imperfect our records must\r\nnecessarily be, and all the more so since it can be theoretically proved\r\nthat the variety of animal and vegetable life must have increased\r\ngreatly during those very periods of elevation. For as new tracts of\r\nland are raised above the water, new islands are formed. Every new\r\nisland, however, is a new centre of creation, because the animals and\r\nplants accidentally cast ashore there, find in the new territory, in\r\nthe struggle for life, abundant opportunity of developing themselves\r\npeculiarly, and of forming new species. The formation of new species has\r\nevidently taken place pre-eminently during these intermediate periods,\r\nof which, unfortunately, no petrifactions could be preserved, whereas,\r\non the contrary, during the slow sinking of the ground there was more\r\nchance of numerous species dying out, and of a retrogression into fewer\r\nspecific forms. The intermediate forms between the old and the\r\nnewly-forming species must also have lived during the periods of\r\nelevation, and consequently could likewise leave no fossil remains.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the great and deplorable gaps in the palæontological\r\nrecords of creation—which are caused by the periods of elevation—there\r\nare, unfortunately, many other circumstances which immensely diminish\r\ntheir value. I must mention here especially the _metamorphic state of\r\nthe most ancient formations_, of those strata which contain the remains\r\nof the most ancient flora and fauna, the original forms of all\r\nsubsequent organisms, and which, therefore, would be of especial\r\ninterest. It is just these rocks—and, indeed, the greater part of the\r\nprimordial, or archilithic strata, almost the whole of the Laurentian,\r\nand a large part of the Cambrian systems—which no longer contain any\r\nrecognizable remains, and for the simple reason that these strata have\r\nbeen subsequently changed or metamorphosed by the influence of the fiery\r\nfluid interior of the earth. These deepest neptunic strata of the crust\r\nhave been completely changed from their original condition by the heat\r\nof the glowing nucleus of the earth, and have assumed a crystalline\r\nstate. In this process, however, the form of the organic remains\r\nenclosed in them has been entirely destroyed. It has been preserved only\r\nhere and there by a happy chance, as in the case of the most ancient\r\npetrifactions known, the _Eozoon canadense_, from the lowest Laurentian\r\nstrata. However, from the layers of crystalline charcoal (graphite) and\r\ncrystalline limestone (marble), which are found deposited in the\r\nmetamorphic rocks, we may with certainty conclude that petrified animal\r\nand vegetable remains existed in them in earlier times.\r\n\r\nOur record of creation is also extremely imperfect from the circumstance\r\nthat only a small portion of the earth’s surface has been accurately\r\ninvestigated by geologists, namely, England, Germany, and France. But we\r\nknow very little of the other parts of Europe, of Russia, Spain, Italy,\r\nand Turkey. In the whole of Europe, only some few parts of the earth’s\r\ncrust have been laid open, by far the largest portion of it is unknown\r\nto us. The same applies to North America and to the East Indies. There\r\nsome few tracts have been investigated; but of the larger portion of\r\nAsia, the most extensive of all continents, we know almost nothing; of\r\nAfrica nothing, excepting the Cape of Good Hope and the shores of the\r\nMediterranean; of Australia almost nothing; and of South America but\r\nvery little. It is clear, therefore, that only quite a small portion,\r\nperhaps scarcely the thousandth part of the whole surface of the earth,\r\nhas been palæontologically investigated. We may therefore reasonably\r\nhope, when more extensive geological investigations are made, which are\r\ngreatly assisted by the constructions of railroads and mines, to find a\r\ngreat number of other important petrifactions. A hint that this will be\r\nthe case is given by the remarkable petrifactions found in those parts\r\nof Africa and Asia which have been minutely investigated,—the Cape\r\ndistricts and the Himalaya mountains. A series of entirely new and very\r\npeculiar animal forms have become known to us from the rocks of these\r\nlocalities. But we must bear in mind that the vast bottom of the\r\nexisting oceans is at the present time quite inaccessible to\r\npalæontological investigations, and that the greater part of the\r\npetrifactions which have lain there from primæval times will either\r\nnever be known to us, or at best only after the course of many thousands\r\nof years, when the present bottom of the ocean shall have become\r\naccessible by gradual elevation. If we call to mind the fact that\r\nthree-fifths of the whole surface of the earth consists of water, and\r\nonly two-fifths of land, it becomes plain that on this account the\r\npalæontological record must always present an immense gap.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to these, there exists another series of difficulties\r\nin the way of palæontology which arises from the nature of the organisms\r\nthemselves. In the first place, as a rule only the hard and solid parts\r\nof organisms can fall to the bottom of the sea or of fresh waters, and\r\nbe there enclosed in the mud and petrified. Hence it is only the bones\r\nand teeth of vertebrate animals, the calcareous shells of molluscs, the\r\nchitinous skeletons of articulated animals, the calcareous skeletons of\r\nstar-fishes and corals, and the woody and solid parts of plants, that\r\nare capable of being petrified. But soft and delicate parts, which\r\nconstitute by far the greater portion of the bodies of most organisms,\r\nare very rarely deposited in the mud under circumstances favourable to\r\ntheir becoming petrified, or distinctly impressing their external form\r\nupon the hardening mud. Now, it must be borne in mind that large classes\r\nof organisms, as for example the Medusæ, the naked molluscs without\r\nshells, a large portion of the articulated animals, almost all worms,\r\nand even the lowest vertebrate animals, possess no firm and hard parts\r\ncapable of being petrified. In like manner the most important parts of\r\nplants, such as the flowers, are for the most part so soft and tender\r\nthat they cannot be preserved in a recognizable form. We therefore\r\ncannot expect to find any petrified remains of these important\r\norganisms. Moreover, all organisms at an early stage of life are so soft\r\nand tender that they are quite incapable of being petrified.\r\nConsequently all the petrifactions found in the neptunic stratifications\r\nof the earth’s crust comprise altogether but a very few forms, and of\r\nthese for the most part only isolated fragments.\r\n\r\nWe must next bear in mind that the dead bodies of the inhabitants of the\r\nsea are much more likely to be preserved and petrified in the deposits\r\nof mud than those of the inhabitants of fresh water and of the land.\r\nOrganisms living on land can, as a rule, become petrified only when\r\ntheir corpses fall accidentally into the water and are buried at the\r\nbottom in the hardening layers of mud. But this event depends upon very\r\nmany conditions. We cannot therefore be astonished that by far the\r\nmajority of petrifactions belong to organisms which have lived in the\r\nsea, and that of the inhabitants of the land proportionately only very\r\nfew are preserved in a fossil state. How many contingencies come into\r\nplay here we may infer from the single fact that of many fossil mammals,\r\nin fact of all the mammals of the secondary, or mesozoic epoch, nothing\r\nis known except the lower jawbone. This bone is in the first place\r\ncomparatively solid, and in the second place very easily separates\r\nitself from the dead body, which floats on the water. Whilst the body is\r\ndriven away and dissolved by the water, the lower jawbone falls down to\r\nthe bottom of the water and is there enclosed in the mud. This explains\r\nthe remarkable fact that in a stratum of limestone of the Jurassic\r\nsystem near Oxford, in the slates of Stonesfield, as yet only the lower\r\njawbones of numerous pouched animals (Marsupials) have been found. They\r\nare the most ancient mammals known, and of the whole of the rest of\r\ntheir bodies not a single bone exists. The opponents of the theory of\r\ndevelopment, according to their usual logic, would from this fact be\r\nobliged to draw the conclusion that the lower jawbone was the only bone\r\nin the body of those animals.\r\n\r\nFootprints are very instructive when we attempt to estimate the many\r\naccidents which so arbitrarily influence our knowledge of fossils; they\r\nare found in great numbers in different extensive layers of sandstone;\r\nfor example, in the red sandstone of Connecticut, in North America.\r\nThese footprints were evidently made by vertebrate animals, probably by\r\nreptiles, of whose bodies not the slightest trace has been preserved.[1]\r\nThe impressions which their feet have left on the mud alone betray the\r\nformer existence of these otherwise unknown animals.\r\n\r\nThe accidents which, besides these, determine the limits of our\r\npalæontological knowledge, may be inferred from the fact that we know of\r\nonly one or two specimens of very many important petrifactions. It is\r\nnot ten years since we became acquainted with the imperfect impression\r\nof a bird in the Jurassic or Oolitic system, the knowledge of which\r\nhas been of the very greatest importance for the phylogeny of the whole\r\nclass of birds. All birds previously known presented a very uniformly\r\norganized group, and showed no striking transitional forms to other\r\nvertebrate classes, not even to the nearly related reptiles. But that\r\nfossil bird from the Jura possessed not an ordinary bird’s tail, but a\r\nlizard’s tail, and thus confirmed what had been conjectured upon other\r\ngrounds, namely, the derivation of birds from lizards. This single\r\nfossil has thus essentially extended not only our knowledge of the age\r\nof the class of birds, but also of their blood relationship to reptiles.\r\nIn like manner our knowledge of other animal groups has been often\r\nessentially modified by the accidental discovery of a single fossil. The\r\npalæontological records must necessarily be exceedingly imperfect,\r\nbecause we know of so very few examples, or only mere fragments of very\r\nmany important fossils.\r\n\r\nAnother and very sensible gap in these records is caused by the\r\ncircumstance that the _intermediate forms_ which connect the different\r\nspecies have, as a rule, not been preserved, and for the simple reason\r\nthat (according to the principle of divergence of character) they were\r\nless favoured in the struggle for life than the most divergent\r\nvarieties, which had developed out of one and the same original form.\r\nThe intermediate links have, on the whole, always died out _rapidly_,\r\nand have but rarely been preserved as fossils. On the other hand, the\r\nmost divergent forms were able to maintain themselves in life for a\r\nlonger period as independent species, to propagate more numerously, and\r\nconsequently to be more readily petrified. But this does not exclude the\r\nfact that in _some_ cases the connecting intermediate forms of the\r\nspecies have been preserved so perfectly petrified, that even now they\r\ncause the greatest perplexity and occasion endless disputes among\r\nsystematic palæontologists about the arbitrary limits of species.\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of this is furnished by the celebrated and very\r\nvariable fresh-water snail from the Stuben Valley, near Steinheim, in\r\nWürtemburg, which has been described sometimes as _Paludina_, sometimes\r\nas _Valvata_, and sometimes as _Planorbis multiformis_. The snow-white\r\nshells of these small snails constitute more than half of the mass of\r\nthe tertiary limestone hills, and in this one locality show such an\r\nastonishing variety of forms, that the most divergent extremes might be\r\nreferred to at least twenty entirely different species. But all these\r\nextreme forms are united by such innumerable intermediate forms, and\r\nthey lie so regularly above and beside one another, that Hilgendorf was\r\nable, in the clearest manner, to unravel the pedigree of the whole group\r\nof forms. In like manner, among very many other fossil species (for\r\nexample, many ammonites, terebratulæ, sea urchins, lily encrinites,\r\netc.) there are such masses of connecting intermediate forms, that they\r\nreduce the “dealers in fossil species” to despair.\r\n\r\nWhen we weigh all the circumstances here mentioned, the number of which\r\nmight easily be increased, it does not appear astonishing that the\r\nnatural accounts or records of creation formed by petrifactions are\r\nextremely defective and incomplete. But nevertheless, the petrifactions\r\nactually discovered are of the greatest value. Their significance is of\r\nno less importance to the natural history of creation than the\r\ncelebrated inscription on the Rosetta stone, and the decree of Canopus,\r\nare to the history of nations—to archæology and philology. Just as it\r\nhas become possible by means of these two most ancient inscriptions to\r\nreconstruct the history of ancient Egypt, and to decipher all\r\nhieroglyphic writings, so in many cases a few bones of an animal, or\r\nimperfect impressions of a lower animal or vegetable form, are\r\nsufficient for us to gain the most important starting-points in the\r\nhistory of the whole group, and in the search after their pedigree. A\r\ncouple of small back teeth, which have been found in the Keuper\r\nformation of the Trias, have of themselves alone furnished a sure proof\r\nthat mammals existed even in the Triassic period.\r\n\r\nOf the incompleteness of the geological accounts of creation, Darwin,\r\nagreeing with Lyell, the greatest of all recent geologists, says:—\r\n\r\n“I look at the geological record as a history of the world imperfectly\r\nkept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the\r\nlast volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this\r\nvolume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved; and of\r\neach page, only here and there a few lines. Each word of the\r\nslowly-changing language, more or less different in the successive\r\nchapters, may represent the forms of life which are entombed in our\r\nconsecutive formations, and which falsely appear to us to have been\r\nabruptly introduced. On this view, the difficulties above discussed are\r\ngreatly diminished, or even disappear.”—_Origin of Species_, 6th\r\nEdition, p. 289.\r\n\r\nIf we bear in mind the exceeding incompleteness of palæontological\r\nrecords, we shall not be surprised that we are still dependent upon so\r\nmany uncertain hypotheses when actually endeavouring to sketch the\r\npedigree of the different organic groups. However, we fortunately\r\npossess, besides fossils, other records of the history of the origin of\r\norganisms, which in many cases are of no less value, nay, in several\r\ncases are of much greater value, than fossils. By far the most important\r\nof these other records of creation is, without doubt, _ontogeny_, that\r\nis, the history of the development of the organic individual (embryology\r\nand metamorphology). It briefly repeats in great and marked features the\r\nseries of forms which the ancestors of the respective individuals have\r\npassed through from the beginning of their tribe. We have designated the\r\npalæontological history of the development of the ancestors of a living\r\nform as the history of a tribe, or _phylogeny_, and we may therefore\r\nthus enunciate this exceedingly important _biogenetic fundamental\r\nprinciple_: “_Ontogeny is a short and quick repetition, or\r\nrecapitulation, of Phylogeny, determined by the laws of Inheritance and\r\nAdaptation_.” As every animal and every plant from the beginning of its\r\nindividual existence passes through a series of different forms, it\r\nindicates in rapid succession and in general outlines the long and\r\nslowly changing series of states of form which its progenitors have\r\npassed through from the most ancient times. (Gen. Morph. ii. 6, 110,\r\n300.)\r\n\r\nIt is true that the sketch which the ontogeny of organisms gives us of\r\ntheir phylogeny is in most cases more or less obscured, and all the more\r\nso the more Adaptation, in the course of time, has predominated over\r\nInheritance, and the more powerfully the law of abbreviated inheritance,\r\nand the law of correlative adaptation, have exerted their influence.\r\nHowever, this does not lessen the great value which the actual and\r\nfaithfully preserved features of that sketch possess. _Ontogeny is of\r\nthe most inestimable value for the knowledge of the earliest\r\npalæontological conditions of development_, just because no petrified\r\nremains of the most ancient conditions of the development of tribes and\r\nclasses have been preserved. These, indeed, could not have been\r\npreserved on account of the soft and tender nature of their bodies. No\r\npetrifactions could inform us of the fundamental and important fact\r\nwhich ontogeny reveals to us, that the most ancient common ancestors of\r\nall the different animal and vegetable species were quite simple cells\r\nlike the egg-cell. No petrifaction could prove to us the immensely\r\nimportant fact, established by ontogeny, that the simple increase, the\r\nformation of cell-aggregates and the differentiation of those cells,\r\nproduced the infinitely manifold forms of multicellular organisms. Thus\r\nontogeny helps us over many and large gaps in palæontology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand of Nine different Mammals. Pl. IV.\r\n\r\n_1. Man_, _2. Gorilla_, _3. Orang_, _4. Dog_, _5. Seal_, _6. Porpoise_,\r\n_7. Bat_, _8. Mole_, _9. Duck-bill_.]\r\n\r\nTo the invaluable records of creation furnished by palæontology and\r\nontogeny are added the no less important evidences for the blood\r\nrelationship of organisms furnished by _comparative anatomy_. When\r\norganisms, externally very different, nearly agree in their internal\r\nstructure, one may with certainty conclude that the agreement has its\r\nfoundation in Inheritance, the dissimilarity its foundation in\r\nAdaptation. Compare, for example, the hands and fore paws of the nine\r\ndifferent animals which are represented on Plate IV., in which the bony\r\nskeleton in the interior of the hand and of the five fingers is visible.\r\nEverywhere we find, though the external forms are most different, the\r\nsame bones, and among them the same number, position, and connection. It\r\nwill perhaps appear very natural that the hand of _man_ (Fig. 1) differs\r\nvery little from that of the _gorilla_ (Fig. 2) and of the\r\n_orang-outang_ (Fig. 3), his nearest relations. But it will be more\r\nsurprising if the fore feet of the _dog_ also (Fig. 4), as well as the\r\nbreast-fin (the hand) of the _seal_ (Fig. 5), and of the _dolphin_ (Fig.\r\n6), show essentially the same structure. And it will appear still more\r\nwonderful that even the wing of the _bat_ (Fig. 7), the shovel-feet of\r\nthe _mole_ (Fig. 8), and the fore feet of the _duck-bill_\r\n(Ornithorhynchus) (Fig. 9), the most imperfect of all mammals, is\r\ncomposed of entirely the same bones, only their size and form being\r\nvariously changed. Their number, the manner of their arrangement and\r\nconnection has remained the same. (Compare also the explanation of Plate\r\nIV., in the Appendix.) It is quite inconceivable that any other cause,\r\nexcept the common inheritance of the part in question from common\r\nancestors, could have occasioned this wonderful homology or similarity\r\nin the essential inner structure with such different external forms.\r\nNow, if we go down further in the system below the mammals, and find\r\nthat even the wings of birds, the fore feet of reptiles and amphibious\r\nanimals, are composed of essentially the same bones as the arms of man\r\nand the fore legs of the other mammals, we can, from this circumstance\r\nalone, with perfect certainty, infer the common origin of all these\r\nvertebrate animals. Here, as in all other cases, the degree of the\r\ninternal agreement in the form discloses to us the degree of blood\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPEDIGREE AND HISTORY OF THE KINGDOM OF THE PROTISTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Special Mode of Carrying out the Theory of Descent in the\r\n  Natural System of Organisms.—Construction of Pedigrees.—Descent\r\n  of all Many-Celled from Single-Celled Organisms.—Descent of\r\n  Cells from Monera.—Meaning of Organic Tribes, or Phyla.—Number\r\n  of the Tribes in the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms.—The\r\n  Monophyletic Hypothesis of Descent, or the Hypothesis of one\r\n  Common Progenitor, and the Polyphyletic Hypothesis of Descent,\r\n  or the Hypothesis of Many Progenitors.—The Kingdom of Protista,\r\n  or Primæval Beings.—Eight Classes of the Protista\r\n  Kingdom.—Monera, Amœbæ, or Protoplastæ.—Whip-swimmers, or\r\n  Flagellata.—Ciliated-balls, or Catallacta.—Labyrinth-streamers,\r\n  or Labyrinthuleæ.—Flint-cells, or Diatomeæ.—Mucous-moulds, or\r\n  Myxomycetes.—Root-footers (Rhizopoda).—Remarks on the General\r\n  Natural History of the Protista: Their Vital Phenomena,\r\n  Chemical Composition, and Formation (Individuality and\r\n  Fundamental Form).—Phylogeny of the Protista Kingdom\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a careful comparison of the individual and the palæontological\r\ndevelopment, as also by the comparative anatomy of organisms, by the\r\ncomparative examination of their fully developed structural\r\ncharacteristics, we arrive at the knowledge of the degrees of their\r\ndifferent structural relationships. By this, however, we at the same\r\ntime obtain an insight into their true _blood relationship_, which,\r\naccording to the Theory of Descent, is the real reason of the structural\r\nrelationship. Hence by collecting, comparing, and employing the\r\nempirical results of embryology, palæontology, and anatomy for\r\nsupplementing each other, we arrive at an approximate knowledge of “the\r\nNatural System,” which, according to our views, is the _pedigree_ of\r\norganisms. It is true that our human knowledge, in all things\r\nfragmentary, is especially so in this case, on account of the extreme\r\nincompleteness and defectiveness of the records of creation. However, we\r\nmust not allow this to discourage us, or to deter us from undertaking\r\nthis highest problem of biology. Let us rather see how far it may even\r\nnow be possible, in spite of the imperfect state of our embryological,\r\npalæontological, and anatomical knowledge, to establish a probable\r\nscheme of the genealogical relationships of organisms.\r\n\r\nDarwin in his book gives us no answer to these special questions of the\r\nTheory of Descent; at the conclusion he only expresses his conjecture\r\n“that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors,\r\nand plants from an equal or less number.” But as these few aboriginal\r\nforms still show traces of relationship, and as the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms are connected by intermediate transitional forms, he arrives\r\nafterwards at the opinion “that probably all the organic beings which\r\nhave ever lived on the earth have descended from some one primordial\r\nform, into which life was first breathed by the Creator.” Like Darwin,\r\nall other adherents of the Theory of Descent have only treated it in a\r\ngeneral way, and not made the attempt to carry it out specially, and to\r\ntreat the “Natural System” actually as the pedigree of organisms. If,\r\ntherefore, we venture upon this difficult undertaking, we must take up\r\nindependent ground.\r\n\r\nFour years ago I set up a number of hypothetical genealogies for the\r\nlarger groups of organisms in the systematic introduction to my General\r\nHistory of Development (Gen. Morph. vol. ii.), and thereby, in fact,\r\nmade the first attempt actually to construct the pedigrees of organisms\r\nin the manner required by the theory of development. I was quite\r\nconscious of the extreme difficulty of the task, and as I undertook it\r\nin spite of all discouraging obstacles, I claim no more than the merit\r\nof having made the first attempt and given a stimulus for other and\r\nbetter attempts. Probably most zoologists and botanists were but little\r\nsatisfied with this beginning, and least so in reference to the special\r\ndomain in which each one is specially at work. However, it is certainly\r\nin this case much easier to blame than to produce something better, and\r\nwhat best proves the immense difficulty of this infinitely complicated\r\ntask is the fact that no naturalist has as yet supplied the place of my\r\npedigrees by better ones. But, like all other scientific hypotheses\r\nwhich serve to explain facts, my genealogical hypotheses may claim to be\r\ntaken into consideration until they are replaced by better ones.\r\n\r\nI hope that this replacement will very soon take place; and I wish for\r\nnothing more than that my first attempt may induce very many naturalists\r\nto establish more accurate pedigrees for the individual groups, at least\r\nin the special domain of the animal and vegetable kingdom which happens\r\nto be well known to one or other of them. By numerous attempts of this\r\nkind our genealogical knowledge, in the course of time, will slowly\r\nadvance and approach more towards perfection, although it can with\r\ncertainty be foreseen that we shall never arrive at a complete\r\npedigree. We lack, and shall ever lack, the indispensable\r\npalæontological foundations. The most ancient records will ever remain\r\nsealed to us, for reasons which have been previously mentioned. The most\r\nancient organisms which arose by spontaneous generation—the original\r\nparents of all subsequent organisms—must necessarily be supposed to have\r\nbeen Monera—simple, soft, albuminous lumps, without structure, without\r\nany definite forms, and entirely without any hard and formed parts. They\r\nand their next offspring were consequently not in any way capable of\r\nbeing preserved in a petrified condition. But we also lack, for reasons\r\ndiscussed in detail in the preceding chapter, by far the greater portion\r\nof the innumerable palæontological documents, which are really requisite\r\nfor a safe reconstruction of the history of animal tribes, or phylogeny,\r\nand for the true knowledge of the pedigree of organisms. If we,\r\ntherefore, in spite of this, venture to undertake their hypothetical\r\nconstruction, we must chiefly depend for guidance on the two other\r\nseries of records which most essentially supplement the palæontological\r\narchives. These are ontogeny and comparative anatomy.\r\n\r\nIf thoughtfully and carefully we consult these most valuable records, we\r\nat once perceive what is exceedingly significant, namely, that by far\r\nthe greater number of organisms, especially all higher animals and\r\nplants, are composed of a great number of cells, and that they originate\r\nout of an egg, and that this egg, in animals as well as in plants, is a\r\nsingle, perfectly simple cell—a little lump of albuminous constitution,\r\nin which another albuminous corpuscle, the cell-kernel, is enclosed.\r\nThis cell containing its kernel grows and becomes enlarged. By division\r\nit forms an accumulation of cells, and out of these, by division of\r\nlabour (as has previously been described), there arise the numberless\r\ndifferent forms which are presented to us in the fully developed animal\r\nand vegetable species. This immensely important process—which we may\r\nfollow step by step, with our own eyes, any day in the embryological\r\ndevelopment of any animal or vegetable individual, and which as a rule\r\nis by no means considered with the reverence it deserves—informs us more\r\nsurely and completely than all petrifactions could do as to the original\r\npalæontological development of all many-celled organisms, that is, of\r\nall higher animals and plants. For as ontogeny, or the embryological\r\ndevelopment of every single individual, is essentially only a\r\nrecapitulation of phylogeny, or the palæontological development of its\r\nchain of ancestors, we may at once, with full assurance, draw the simple\r\nand important conclusion, that _all many-celled animals and plants were\r\noriginally derived from single-celled organisms_. The primæval ancestors\r\nof man, as well as of all other animals, and of all plants composed of\r\nmany cells, were simple cells living isolated. This invaluable secret of\r\nthe organic pedigree is revealed to us with infallible certainty by the\r\negg of animals, and by the true egg-cell of plants. When the opponents\r\nof the Theory of Descent assert it to be miraculous and inconceivable\r\nthat an exceedingly complicated many-celled organism could, in the\r\ncourse of time, have proceeded from a simple single-celled organism, we\r\nat once reply that we may see this incredible miracle at any moment, and\r\nfollow it with our own eyes. For the embryology of animals and plants\r\nvisibly presents to our eyes in the shortest space of time the same\r\nprocess as that which has taken place in the origin of the whole tribe\r\nduring the course of enormous periods of time.\r\n\r\nUpon the ground of embryological records, therefore, we can with full\r\nassurance maintain that all many-celled, as well as single-celled,\r\norganisms are originally descended from simple cells; connected with\r\nthis, of course, is the conclusion that the most ancient root of the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdom was common to both. For the different\r\nprimæval “original cells” out of which the few different main groups or\r\ntribes have developed, only acquired their differences after a time, and\r\nwere descended from a common “primæval cell.” But where did those few\r\n“original cells,” or the one primæval cell, come from? For the answer to\r\nthis fundamental genealogical question we must return to the theory of\r\nplastids and the hypothesis of spontaneous generation which we have\r\nalready discussed (vol. i. p. 327).\r\n\r\nAs was then shown, we cannot imagine _cells_ to have arisen by\r\nspontaneous generation, but only _Monera_, those primæval creatures of\r\nthe simplest kind conceivable, like the still living Protamœbæ,\r\nProtomyxæ, etc. (vol. i. p. 186, Fig. 1). Only such corpuscules of mucus\r\nwithout component parts—whose whole albuminous body is as homogeneous in\r\nitself as an inorganic crystal, but which nevertheless fulfills the two\r\norganic fundamental functions of nutrition and propagation—could have\r\ndirectly arisen out of inorganic matter by autogeny at the beginning (we\r\nmay suppose) of the Laurentian period. While some Monera remained at the\r\noriginal simple stage of formation, others gradually developed into\r\ncells by the inner kernel of the albuminous mass becoming separated from\r\nthe external cell-substance. In others, by differentiation of the\r\noutermost layer of the cell-substance, an external covering (membrane,\r\nor skin) was formed round simple cytods (without kernel), as well as\r\nround naked cells (containing a kernel). By these two processes of\r\nseparation in the simple primæval mucus of the Moneron body, by the\r\nformation of a kernel in the interior and a covering on the outer\r\nsurface of the mass of plasma, there arose out of the original most\r\nsimple cytods, or Monera, those four different species of plastids, or\r\nindividuals, of the first order, from which, by differentiation and\r\ncombination, all other organisms could afterwards develop themselves.\r\n(Compare vol. i. p. 347.)\r\n\r\nThe question now forces itself upon us, Are all organic cytods and\r\ncells, and consequently also those “original cells” which we previously\r\nconsidered to be the primary parents of the few great main groups of the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms, descended from a single original form of\r\nMoneron, or were there several different organic primary forms, each\r\ntraceable to a peculiar independent species of Moneron which originated\r\nby spontaneous generation? In other words, _Is the whole organic world\r\nof a common origin, or does it owe its origin to several acts of\r\nspontaneous generation?_ This fundamental question of genealogy seems at\r\nfirst sight to be of exceeding importance. But on a more accurate\r\nexamination, we shall soon see that this is not the case, and that it is\r\nin reality a matter of very subordinate importance.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to examine and clearly limit our conception of an\r\n_organic tribe_. By _tribe_, or _phylum_, we understand all those\r\norganisms of whose blood relationship and descent from a common primary\r\nform there can be no doubt, or whose relationship, at least, is most\r\nprobable from anatomical reasons, as well as from reasons founded on\r\nhistorical development. Our tribes, or phyla, according to this idea,\r\nessentially coincide with those few “great classes,” or “main classes,”\r\nof which Darwin also thinks that each contains only organisms related by\r\nblood, and of which, both in the animal and in the vegetable kingdoms,\r\nhe only assumes either four or five. In the animal kingdom these tribes\r\nwould essentially coincide with those four, five, or six main divisions\r\nwhich zoologists, since Bär and Cuvier, have distinguished as “main\r\nforms, general plans, branches, or sub-kingdoms” of the animal kingdom.\r\n(Compare vol. i. p. 53.) Bär and Cuvier distinguished only four of them,\r\nnamely:—1. The vertebrate animals (Vertebrata); 2. The articulated\r\nanimals (Articulata); 3. The molluscous animals (Mollusca); and 4. The\r\nradiated animals (Radiata). At present six are generally distinguished,\r\nsince the tribe of the articulated animals is divided into two tribes,\r\nthose possessing articulated feet (Arthropoda), and the worms (Vermes);\r\nand in like manner the tribe of radiated animals is subdivided into the\r\ntwo tribes of the star animals (Echinodermata) and the animal-plants\r\n(Zoophyta). Within each of these six tribes, all the included animals,\r\nin spite of great variety in external form and inner structure,\r\nnevertheless possess such numerous and important characteristics in\r\ncommon, that there can be no doubt of their blood relationship. The same\r\napplies also to the six great main classes which modern botany\r\ndistinguishes in the vegetable kingdom, namely:—1. Flowering plants\r\n(Phanerogamia); 2. Ferns (Filicinæ); 3. Mosses (Muscinæ); 4. Lichens\r\n(Lichenes); 5. Fungi (Fungi); and 6. Water-weeds (Algæ). The last three\r\ngroups, again, show such close relations to one another, that by the\r\nname of “Thallus plants” they may be contrasted with the three first\r\nmain classes, and consequently the number of phyla, or main groups, of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom may be reduced to the number of four. Mosses and\r\nferns may likewise be comprised as “Prothallus plants” (Prothallophyta),\r\nand thereby the number of plant tribes reduced to three—Flowering\r\nplants, Prothallus plants, and Thallus plants.\r\n\r\nVery important facts in the anatomy and the history of development, both\r\nin the animal and vegetable kingdoms, support the supposition that even\r\nthese few main classes or tribes are connected at their roots, that is,\r\nthat the lowest and most ancient primary forms of all three are related\r\nby blood to one another. Nay, by a further examination we are obliged to\r\ngo still a step further, and to agree with Darwin’s supposition, that\r\neven the two pedigrees of the animal and vegetable kingdom are connected\r\nat their lowest roots, and that the lowest and most ancient animals and\r\nplants are derived from a single common primary creature. According to\r\nour view, this common primæval organism can have been nothing but a\r\nMoneron which took its origin by spontaneous generation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time we shall at all events be acting cautiously if we avoid\r\nthis last step, and assume true blood relationship only within each\r\ntribe, or phylum, where it has been undeniably and surely established by\r\nfacts in comparative anatomy, ontogeny, and phylogeny. But we may here\r\npoint to the fact that two different fundamental forms of genealogical\r\nhypothesis are possible, and that all the different investigations of\r\nthe Theory of Descent in relation to the origin of organic groups of\r\nforms will, in future, tend more and more in one or the other of these\r\ndirections. The unitary, or _monophyletic_, hypothesis of descent will\r\nendeavour to trace the first origin of all individual groups of\r\norganisms, as well as their totality, to a single common species of\r\nMoneron which originated by spontaneous generation (vol. i. p. 343). The\r\nmultiple, or _polyphyletic_, hypothesis of descent, on the other hand,\r\nwill assume that several different species of Monera have arisen by\r\nspontaneous generation, and that these gave rise to several different\r\nmain classes (tribes, or phyla) (vol. i. p. 348). The apparently great\r\ncontrast between these two hypotheses is in reality of very little\r\nimportance. For both the monophyletic and the polyphyletic hypothesis of\r\ndescent must necessarily go back to the Monera as the most ancient root\r\nof the one or of the many organic tribes. But as the whole body of a\r\nMoneron consists only of a simple, formless mass, without component\r\nparticles, made up of a single albuminous combination of carbon, it\r\nfollows that the differences of the different Monera can only be of a\r\nchemical nature, and can only consist in a different atomic composition\r\nof that mucous albuminous combination. But these subtle and complicated\r\ndifferences of mixture of the infinitely manifold combinations of\r\nalbumen are not appreciable by the rude and imperfect means of human\r\nobservation and are, consequently, at present of no further interest to\r\nthe task we have in hand.\r\n\r\nThe question of the monophyletic or polyphyletic origin will constantly\r\nrecur within each individual tribe, where the origin of a smaller or of\r\na larger group is discussed. In the vegetable kingdom, for example, some\r\nbotanists will be inclined to derive all flowering plants from a single\r\nform of fern, while others will prefer the idea that several different\r\ngroups of Phanerogama have sprung from several different groups of\r\nferns. In like manner, in the animal kingdom, some zoologists will be\r\nmore in favour of the supposition that all placental animals are derived\r\nfrom a single pouched animal; others will be more in favour of the\r\nopposite supposition, that several different groups of placental animals\r\nhave proceeded from several different pouched animals. In regard to the\r\nhuman race itself, some will prefer to derive it from a single form of\r\nape, while others will be more inclined to the idea that several\r\ndifferent races of men have arisen, independently of one another, out of\r\nseveral different species of ape. Without here expressing our opinion in\r\nfavour of either the one or the other conception, we must, nevertheless,\r\nremark that in general _the monophyletic hypothesis of descent deserves\r\nto be preferred to the polyphyletic hypothesis of descent_. In\r\naccordance with the chorological proposition of a single “centre of\r\ncreation” or of a single primæval home for most species (which has\r\nalready been discussed), we may be permitted to assume that the original\r\nform of every larger or smaller natural group only originated _once_ in\r\nthe course of time, and only in _one part_ of the earth. We may safely\r\nassume this simple original root, that is, the monophyletic origin, in\r\nthe case of all the more highly developed groups of the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms. (Compare vol. i. p. 353.) But it is very possible\r\nthat the more complete Theory of Descent of the future will involve the\r\npolyphyletic origin of very many of the low and imperfect groups of the\r\ntwo organic kingdoms.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I consider it best, in the mean time, to adopt the\r\n_monophyletic hypothesis of descent_ both for the animal and for the\r\nvegetable kingdom. Accordingly, the above-mentioned six tribes, or\r\nphyla, of the animal kingdom must be connected at their lowest root,\r\nand likewise the three or six main classes, or phyla, of the vegetable\r\nkingdom must be traced to a common and most ancient original form. How\r\nthe connection of these tribes is to be conceived I shall explain in the\r\nsucceeding chapters. But before proceeding to this, we must occupy\r\nourselves with a very remarkable group of organisms, which cannot\r\nwithout artificial constraint be assigned either to the pedigree of the\r\nvegetable or to that of the animal kingdom. These interesting and\r\nimportant organisms are the _primary creatures_, or _Protista_.\r\n\r\nAll organisms which we comprise under the name of Protista show in their\r\nexternal form, in their inner structure, and in all their vital\r\nphenomena, such a remarkable mixture of animal and vegetable properties,\r\nthat they cannot with perfect justice be assigned either to the animal\r\nor to the vegetable kingdom; and for more than twenty years an endless\r\nand fruitless dispute has been carried on as to whether they are to be\r\nassigned to this or that kingdom. Most of Protista are so small that\r\nthey can scarcely, if at all, be perceived with the naked eye. Hence the\r\nmajority of them have only become known during the last fifty years,\r\nsince by the help of the improved and general use of the microscope\r\nthese minute organisms have been more frequently observed and more\r\naccurately examined. However, no sooner were they better known than\r\nendless disputes arose about their real nature and their position in the\r\nnatural system of organisms. Many of these doubtful primary creatures\r\nbotanists defined as animals, and zoologists as plants; neither of the\r\ntwo would own them. Others, again, were declared by botanists to be\r\nplants, and by zoologists to be animals; each claimed them. These\r\ncontradictions are not altogether caused by our imperfect knowledge of\r\nthe Protista, but in reality by their true nature. Indeed, most Protista\r\npresent such a confused mixture of several animal and vegetable\r\ncharacteristics, that each investigator may arbitrarily assign them\r\neither to the animal or vegetable kingdom. Accordingly as he defines\r\nthese two kingdoms, and as he looks upon this or that characteristic as\r\ndetermining the animal or vegetable nature, he will assign the\r\nindividual classes of Protista in one case to the animal and in another\r\nto the vegetable kingdom. But this systematic difficulty has become an\r\ninextricable knot by the fact that all more recent investigations on the\r\nlowest organisms have completely effaced, or at least destroyed, the\r\nsharp boundary between the animal and vegetable kingdom which had\r\nhitherto existed, and to such a degree that its restoration is possible\r\nonly by means of a completely artificial definition of the two kingdoms.\r\nBut this definition could not be made so as to apply to many of the\r\nProtista.\r\n\r\nFor this and other reasons it is, in the mean time, best to exclude the\r\ndoubtful beings from the animal as well as from the vegetable kingdom,\r\nand to comprise them in a third organic kingdom standing midway between\r\nthe two others. This intermediate kingdom I have established as the\r\n_Kingdom of the Primary Creatures_ (Protista), when discussing general\r\nanatomy in the first volume of my General Morphology, pp. 191-238. In my\r\nMonograph of the Monera,(15) I have recently treated of this kingdom,\r\nhaving somewhat changed its limits, and given it a more accurate\r\ndefinition. Of independent classes of the kingdom Protista, we may at\r\npresent distinguish the following:—\r\n\r\n1. The still living Monera; 2. The Amœboidea, or Protoplasts; 3. The\r\nWhip-swimmers, or Flagellata; 4. The Flimmer-balls, or Catallacta; 5.\r\nThe Tram-weavers, or Labyrinthuleæ; 6. The Flint-cells, or Diatomeæ; 7.\r\nThe Slime-moulds, or Myxomycetes; 8. The Ray-streamers, or Rhizopoda.\r\n\r\nThe most important groups at present distinguishable in these eight\r\nclasses of Protista are named in the systematic table on p. 51. Probably\r\nthe number of these Protista will be considerably increased in future\r\ndays by the progressive investigations of the ontogeny of the simplest\r\nforms of life, which have only lately been carried on with any great\r\nzeal. With most of the classes named we have become intimately\r\nacquainted only during the last ten years. The exceedingly interesting\r\nMonera and Labyrinthuleæ, as also the Catallacta, were indeed discovered\r\nonly a few years ago. It is probable also that very numerous groups of\r\nProtista have died out in earlier periods, without having left any\r\nfossil remains, owing to the very soft nature of their bodies. We might\r\nadd to the Protista from the still living lowest groups of organisms—the\r\nFungi; and in so doing should make a very large addition to its domain.\r\nProvisionally we shall leave them among plants, though many naturalists\r\nhave separated them altogether from the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n_The pedigree of the kingdom Protista_ is still enveloped in the\r\ngreatest obscurity. The peculiar combination of animal and vegetable\r\nproperties, the indifferent and uncertain character of their relations\r\nof forms and vital phenomena, together with a number of several very\r\npeculiar features which separate most of the subordinate classes sharply\r\nfrom the others, at present baffle every attempt distinctly to make out\r\ntheir blood relationships with one another, or with the lowest animals\r\non the one hand, and with the lowest plants on the other hand. It is not\r\nimprobable that the classes specified, and many other unknown classes of\r\nProtista, represent quite independent organic tribes, or phyla, each of\r\nwhich has independently developed from one, perhaps from various, Monera\r\nwhich have arisen by spontaneous generation. If we do not agree to this\r\npolyphyletic hypothesis of descent, and prefer the monophyletic\r\nhypothesis of the blood relationship of all organisms, we shall have to\r\nLook upon the different classes of protista as the lower small\r\noff-shoots of the root, springing from the same simple monera root, out\r\nof which arose the two mighty and many-branched pedigrees of the animal\r\nkingdom on the one hand, and of the vegetable kingdom on the other.\r\n(compare pp. 74, 75.) before i enter into this difficult question more\r\naccurately, it will be appropriate to premise something further as to\r\nthe contents of the classes of protista given on the next page, and\r\ntheir general natural history.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the Larger and Smaller Groups of the Kingdom Protista._\r\n\r\n  ----------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n   _Classes of    | _Systematic Name   | _Orders of       |  _A name of a\r\n   the Protista   |  of the Classes_.  | Families of the  |  Genus\r\n   Kingdom._      |                    | Classes._        |  as an example._\r\n  ----------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n                                       { 1.

Still, what are we otherwise to do with the _still\r\nliving Monera_? We know nothing of their palæontological origin, we know\r\nnothing of any of their relations to lower animals or plants, and we\r\nknow nothing of their possible capability of developing into higher\r\norganisms. The simple and homogeneous little lump of slime or mucus\r\nwhich constitutes their entire body (Fig. 8) is the most ancient and\r\noriginal form of animal as well as of vegetable plastids. Hence it would\r\nevidently be just as arbitrary and unreasonable to assign them to the\r\nanimal as it would be to assign them to the vegetable kingdom. In any\r\ncase we shall for the present be acting more cautiously and critically\r\nif we comprise the still living Monera—whose number and distribution is\r\nprobably very great—as a special and independent class, contrasting them\r\nwith the other classes of the kingdom Protista, as well as with the\r\nanimal kingdom. Morphologically considered, the Monera—on account of the\r\nperfect homogeneity of the albuminous substance of their bodies, on\r\naccount of their utter want of heterogeneous particles—are more closely\r\nconnected with anorgana than with organisms, and evidently form the\r\ntransition between the inorganic and organic world of bodies, as is\r\nnecessitated by the hypothesis of spontaneous generation. I have\r\ndescribed and given illustrations of the forms and vital phenomena of\r\nthe still living Monera (Protamœba, Protogenes, Protomyxa, etc.) in my\r\nMonograph of the Monera,(15) and have briefly mentioned the most\r\nimportant facts in the eighth chapter (vol. i. pp. 183-187). Therefore,\r\nonly by way of a specimen, I here repeat the drawing of the fresh-water\r\nProtamœba (Fig. 8). The history of the life of an orange-red _Protomyxa\r\nadrantiaca_, which I observed at Lanzerote, one of the Canary Islands,\r\nis given in Plate I. (see its explanation in the Appendix). Besides\r\nthis, I here add a drawing of the form of Bathybius, that remarkable\r\nMoneron discovered by Huxley, which lives in the greatest depths of the\r\nsea in the shape of naked lumps of protoplasm and reticular mucus (vol.\r\ni. p. 344).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Bathybius Hæckelii, the “creature of primæval\r\nslime,” from the greatest depths of the sea. The figure, which is\r\ngreatly magnified, only shows that form of the Bathybius which consists\r\nof a naked network of protoplasm, without the discoliths and cyatholiths\r\nwhich are found in other forms of the same Moneron, and which perhaps\r\nmay be considered as the products of its secretion.]\r\n\r\nThe _Amœbæ_ of the present day, and the organisms most closely connected\r\nwith them, _Arcellidæ_ and _Gregarinæ_, which we here unite as a second\r\nclass of Protista under the name of _Amœboidea_ (Protoplasta), present\r\nno fewer genealogical difficulties than the Monera. These primary\r\ncreatures are at present usually placed in the animal kingdom without\r\nits in reality being understood why. For simple naked cells—that is,\r\nshell-less plastids with a kernel—occur as well among real plants as\r\nreal animals. The generative cells, for example, in many Algæ (spores\r\nand eggs) exist for a longer or shorter time in water in the form of\r\nnaked cells with a kernel, which cannot be distinguished at all from the\r\nnaked eggs of many animals (for example, those of the Siphonophorous\r\nMedusæ). (Compare the figure of a naked egg of a bladder-wrack in\r\nChapter xvii. p. 90.) In reality every naked simple cell, whether it\r\nproceeds from an animal or vegetable body, cannot be distinguished from\r\nan independent Amœba. For an Amœba is nothing but a simple primary cell,\r\na naked little lump of cell-matter, or plasma, containing a kernel. The\r\ncontractility of this plasma, which the free Amœba shows in stretching\r\nout and drawing in its changing processes, is a general vital property\r\nof the organic plasma of all animal as well as of all vegetable\r\nplastids. When a freely moving Amœba, which perpetually changes its\r\nform, passes into a state of rest, it draws itself together into the\r\nform of a globule, and surrounds itself with a secreted membrane. It can\r\nthen be as little distinguished from an animal egg as from a simple\r\nglobular vegetable cell (Fig. 10 _A_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Amœba sphærococcus, greatly magnified. A\r\nfresh-water Amœba without a contractile vacuole. _A._ The enclosed Amœba\r\nin the state of a globular lump of plasma (_c_) enclosing a kernel and a\r\nkernel-speck (_a_).

(_Da_ and _Db_).]\r\n\r\nNaked cells, with kernels, like those represented in Fig. 10 _B_, which\r\nare continuously changing, stretching out and drawing in formless,\r\nfinger-like processes, and which are on this account called amœboid, are\r\nfound frequently and widely dispersed in fresh water and in the sea;\r\nnay, are even found creeping on land. They take their food in the same\r\nway as was previously described in the case of the Protamœba (vol. i. p.\r\n186). Their propagation by division can sometimes be observed. (Fig. 10\r\n_C_, _D_.) I have described the processes in an earlier chapter (vol. i.\r\np. 187). Many of these formless Amœbæ have lately been recognized as the\r\nearly stages of development of other Protista (especially the\r\nMyxomycetæ), or as the freed cells of lower animals and plants. The\r\ncolourless blood-cells of animals, for example, those of human blood,\r\ncannot be distinguished from Amœbæ. They, like the latter, can receive\r\nsolid corpuscles into their interior, as I was the first to show by\r\nfeeding them with finely divided colouring matters (Gen. Morph. i. 271).\r\nHowever, other Amœbæ (like the one given in Fig. 10) seem to be\r\nindependent “good species,” since they propagate themselves unchanged\r\nthroughout many generations. Besides the real, or _naked_, Amœbæ\r\n(Gymnamœbæ), we also find widely diffused in fresh water _case-bearing_\r\nAmœbæ (Lepamœbæ), whose naked plasma body is _partially_ protected by a\r\nmore or less solid shell (Arcella), sometimes even by a case (Difflugia)\r\ncomposed of small stones. Lastly, we frequently find in the body of many\r\nlower animals parasitic Amœbæ (Gregarinæ), which, adapting themselves to\r\na parasitic life, have surrounded their plasma-body with a delicate\r\nclosed membrane.\r\n\r\nThe simple naked Amœbæ are, next to the Monera, the most important of\r\nall organisms to the whole science of biology, and especially to general\r\ngenealogy. For it is evident that the Amœbæ originally arose out of\r\nsimple Monera (Protamœbæ), by the important process of segregation\r\ntaking place in their homogeneous viscid body—the differentiation of an\r\ninner kernel from the surrounding plasma. By this means the great\r\nprogress from a simple cytod (without kernel) into a real cell (with\r\nkernel) was accomplished (compare Fig. 8 _A_ and Fig. 10 _B_). As some\r\nof these cells at an early stage encased themselves by secreting a\r\nhardened membrane, they formed the first vegetable cells, while others,\r\nremaining naked, developed into the first aggregates of animal cells.\r\nThe presence or absence of an encircling hard membrane forms the most\r\nimportant, although by no means the entire, difference of form between\r\nanimal and vegetable cells. As vegetable cells even at an early stage\r\nenclose themselves within their hard, thick, and solid cellular shell,\r\nlike that of the Amœbæ in a state of rest (Fig. 10 _A_), they remain\r\nmore independent and less accessible to the influences of the outer\r\nworld than are the soft animal cells, which are in most cases naked, or\r\nmerely covered by a thin pliable membrane. But in consequence of this\r\nthe vegetable cells cannot combine, as do the animal cells, for the\r\nconstruction of higher and composite fibrous tracts, for example, the\r\nnervous and muscular tissues. It is probable that, in the case of the\r\nmost ancient single-celled organisms, there must have developed at an\r\nearly stage the very important difference in the animal and vegetable\r\nmode of receiving food. The most ancient single-celled animals, being\r\nnaked cells, could admit solid particles into the interior of their soft\r\nbodies, as do the Amœbæ (Fig. 10 _B_) and the colourless blood-cells;\r\nwhereas the most ancient single-celled plants encased by their membranes\r\nwere no longer able to do this, and could admit through it only fluid\r\nnutrition (by means of diffusion).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—A single Whip-swimmer (Euglena striata), greatly\r\nmagnified. Above a thread-like lashing whip is visible; in the centre\r\nthe round cellular kernel, with its kernel speck.]\r\n\r\nThe _Whip-swimmers_ (Flagellata), which we consider as a third class of\r\nthe kingdom Protista, are of no less doubtful nature than the Amœbæ.\r\nThey often show as close and important relations to the vegetable as to\r\nthe animal kingdom. Some Flagellata at an early stage, when freely\r\nmoving about, cannot be distinguished from real plants, especially from\r\nthe spores of many Algæ; whereas others are directly allied to real\r\nanimals, namely, to the fringed Infusoria (Ciliata). The Flagellata are\r\nsimple cells which live in fresh or salt water, either singly or united\r\nin colonies. The characteristic part of their body is a very movable\r\nsimple or compound whip-like appendage (whip, or flagellum) by means of\r\nwhich they actively swim about in the water. This class is divided into\r\ntwo orders. Among the fringed whip-swimmers (Cilioflagellata) there\r\nexists, in addition to the long whip, a short fringe of vibrating hairs,\r\nwhich is wanting in the unfringed whip-swimmers (Nudoflagellata). To the\r\nformer belong the flint-shelled yellow Peridinia, which are largely\r\nactive in causing the phosphorescence of the sea; to the latter belong\r\nthe green Euglenæ, immense masses of which frequently make our ponds in\r\nspring quite green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—The Norwegian Flimmer-ball (Magosphæra planula)\r\nswimming by means of its vibratile fringes, as seen from the surface.]\r\n\r\nA very remarkable new form of Protista, which I have named\r\n_Flimmer-ball_ (Magosphæra), I discovered only three years ago (in\r\nSeptember, 1869), on the Norwegian coast (Fig. 12), and have more\r\naccurately described in my Biological Studies(15) (p. 137, Plate V.).\r\nOff the island of Gis-oe, near Bergen, I found swimming about, on the\r\nsurface of the sea, extremely neat little balls composed of a number\r\n(between thirty and forty) of fringed pear-shaped cells, the pointed\r\nends of which were united in the centre like radii. After a time the\r\nball dissolved. The individual cells swarmed about independently in the\r\nwater like fringed Infusoria, or Ciliata. These afterwards sank to the\r\nbottom, drew their fringes into their bodies, and gradually changed into\r\nthe form of creeping Amœbæ (like Fig 10 _B_). These last afterwards\r\nencased themselves (as in Fig. 10 _A_), and then divided by repeated\r\nhalvings into a large number of cells (exactly as in the case of the\r\ncleavage of the egg, Fig. 6, vol. i. p. 299). The cells became covered\r\nwith vibratile hairs, broke through the case enclosing them, and now\r\nagain swam about in the shape of a fringed ball (Fig. 12). This\r\nwonderful organism, which sometimes appears like a simple Amœba,\r\nsometimes as a single fringed cell, sometimes as a many-celled fringed\r\nball, can evidently be classed with none of the other Protista, and must\r\nbe considered as the representative of a new independent group. As this\r\ngroup stands midway between several Protista, and links them together,\r\nit may bear the name of _Mediator_, or _Catallacta_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Labyrinthula macrocystis (much enlarged). Below\r\nis a large group of accumulated cells, one of which, on the left, is\r\nseparating itself; above are two single cells which are gliding along\r\nthe threads of the retiform labyrinth which form their “tramways.”]\r\n\r\nThe Protista of the fifth class, the _Tram-weavers_, or _Labyrinthuleæ_,\r\nare of a no less puzzling nature; they were lately discovered by\r\nCienkowski on piles in sea water (Fig. 13). They are spindle-shaped\r\ncells, mostly of a yellow-ochre colour, which are sometimes united into\r\na dense mass, sometimes move about in a very peculiar way. They form, in\r\na manner not yet explained, a retiform frame of entangled threads\r\n(compared to a labyrinth), and on the dense filamentous “tramways” of\r\nthis frame they glide about. From the shape of the cells of the\r\nLabyrinthuleæ we might consider them as the simplest plants, from their\r\nmotion as the simplest animals, but in reality they are neither animals\r\nnor plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Navicula hippocampus (greatly magnified). In the\r\nmiddle of the cell the cell-kernel (nucleus) is visible, together with\r\nits kernel speck (nucleolus).]\r\n\r\nThe _Flint-cells_ (Diatomeæ), a sixth class of Protista, are perhaps the\r\nmost closely related to the Labyrinthuleæ. These primary creatures—which\r\nat present are generally considered as plants, although some celebrated\r\nnaturalists still look upon them as animals—inhabit the sea and fresh\r\nwaters in immense masses, and offer an endless variety of the most\r\nelegant forms. They are mostly small microscopic cells, which either\r\nlive singly (Fig. 14), or united in great numbers, and occur either\r\nattached to objects, or glide and creep about in a peculiar manner.\r\nTheir soft cell-substance, which is of a characteristic brownish yellow\r\ncolour, is always enclosed by a solid and hard flinty shell, possessing\r\nthe neatest and most varied forms. This flinty covering is open to the\r\nexterior only by one or two slits, through which the enclosed soft\r\nplasma-body communicates with the outer world. The flinty cases are\r\nfound petrified in masses, and many rocks—for example, the Tripoli slate\r\npolish, the Swedish mountain meal, etc.,—are in a great measure composed\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nA seventh class of Protista is formed by the remarkable _Slime-moulds_\r\n(Myxomycetes). They were formerly universally considered as plants, as\r\nreal Fungi, until ten years ago the botanist De Bary, by discovering\r\ntheir ontogeny, proved them to be quite distinct from Fungi, and rather\r\nto be akin to the lower animals. The mature body is a roundish bladder,\r\noften several inches in size, filled with fine spore-dust and soft\r\nflakes (Fig. 15), as in the case of the well-known puff-balls\r\n(Gastromycetes). However, the characteristic cellular threads, or hyphæ,\r\nof a real fungus do not arise from the germinal corpuscles, or spores,\r\nof the Myxomycetes, but merely naked masses of plasma, or cells, which\r\nat first swim about in the form of Flagellata (Fig. 11), afterwards\r\ncreep about like the Amœbæ (Fig. 10 _B_), and finally combine with\r\nothers of the same kind to form large masses of “slime,” or “plasmodia.”\r\nOut of these, again, there arises, by-and-by, the bladder-shaped\r\nfruit-body. Many of my readers probably know one of these plasmodia, the\r\nÆthalium septicum, which in summer forms a beautiful yellow mass of soft\r\nmucus, often several feet in breadth, known by the name of “tan\r\nflowers,” and penetrates tan-heaps and tan-beds. At an early stage these\r\nslimy, freely-creeping Myxomycetes, which live for the most part in damp\r\nforests, upon decaying vegetable substances, bark of trees, etc., are\r\nwith equal justice or injustice declared by zoologists to be animals,\r\nwhile in the mature, bladder-shaped condition of fructification they are\r\nby botanists defined as plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—A stalked fruit-body (spore-bladder, filled with\r\nspores) of one of the Myxomycetes (Physarum albipes) not much enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the _Ray-streamers_ (Rhizopoda), the eighth class of the\r\nkingdom Protista, is equally obscure. These remarkable organisms have\r\npeopled the sea from the most ancient times of the organic history of\r\nthe earth, in an immense variety of forms, sometimes creeping at the\r\nbottom of the sea, sometimes swimming on the surface. Only very few live\r\nin fresh water (Gromia, Actinosphærium). Most of them possess solid\r\ncalcareous or flinty shells of an extremely beautiful construction,\r\nwhich can be perfectly preserved in a fossil state. They have frequently\r\naccumulated in such huge numbers as to form mountain masses, although\r\nthe single individuals are very small, and often scarcely visible, or\r\ncompletely invisible to the naked eye. A very few attain the diameter\r\nof a few lines, or even as much as a couple of inches. The name which\r\nthe class bears is given because thousands of exceedingly fine threads\r\nof protoplasm radiate from the entire surface of their naked slimy body;\r\nthese rays are quasi-feet, or pseudopodia, which branch off like roots\r\n(whence the term Rhizopoda, signifying root-footed), unite like nets,\r\nand are observed continually to change form, as in the case of the\r\nsimpler plasmic feet of the Amœboidea, or Protoplasts. These\r\never-changing little pseudo-feet serve both for locomotion and for\r\ntaking food.\r\n\r\nThe class of the Rhizopoda is divided into three different legions, viz.\r\nthe chamber-shells, or Acyttaria, the sun-animalcules, or Heliozoa, and\r\nthe basket-shells, or Radiolaria. The _Chamber-shells_ (Acyttaria)\r\nconstitute the first and lowest of these three legions; for the whole of\r\ntheir soft body consists merely of simple mucous or slimy cell-matter,\r\nor protoplasm, which has not differentiated into cells. However, in\r\nspite of this most primitive nature of body, most of the Acyttaria\r\nsecrete a solid shell composed of calcareous earth, which presents a\r\ngreat variety of exquisite forms. In the more ancient and more simple\r\nAcyttaria this shell is a simple chamber, bell-shaped, tubular, or like\r\nthe shell of a snail, from the mouth of which a bundle of plasmic\r\nthreads issues. In contrast to these _single-chambered forms_\r\n(Monothalamia), the _many-chambered forms_ (Polythalamia)—to which the\r\ngreat majority of the Acyttaria belong—possess a house, which is\r\ncomposed in an artistic manner of numerous chambers. These chambers\r\nsometimes lie in a row one behind the other, sometimes in concentric\r\ncircles or spirals, in the form of a ring round a central point, and\r\nthen frequently one above another in many tiers, like the boxes of an\r\namphitheatre. This formation, for example, is found in the nummulites,\r\nwhose calcareous shells, of the size of a lentil, have accumulated to\r\nthe number of millions, and form whole mountains on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean. The stones of which some of the Egyptian pyramids are\r\nbuilt consist of such nummulitic limestone. In most cases the chambers\r\nof the shells of the Polythalamia are wound round one another in a\r\nspiral line. The chambers are connected with one another by passages and\r\ndoors, like rooms of a large palace, and are generally open towards the\r\noutside by numerous little windows, out of which the plasmic body can\r\nstream or strain forth its little pseudo-feet, or rays of slime, which\r\nare always changing form. But in spite of the exceedingly complicated\r\nand elegant structure of this calcareous labyrinth, in spite of the\r\nendless variety in the structure and the decoration of its numerous\r\nchambers, and in spite of the regularity and elegance of their\r\nexecution, the whole of this artistic palace is found to be the secreted\r\nproduct of a perfectly formless, slimy mass, devoid of any component\r\nparts! Verily, if the whole of the recent anatomy of animal and\r\nvegetable textures did not support our theory of plastids, if all its\r\nimportant results did not unanimously corroborate the fact that the\r\nwhole miracle of vital phenomena and vital forms is traceable to the\r\nactive agency of the formless albuminous combinations of protoplasm, the\r\nPolythalamia alone would secure the triumph of that theory. For we may\r\nhere at any moment, by means of the microscope, point out the wonderful\r\nfact, first established by Dujardin and Max Schulze, that the formless\r\nmucus of the soft plasma-body, this true “matter of life,” is able to\r\nsecrete the neatest, most regular, and most complicated structures. This\r\nsecretive skill is simply a result of _inherited adaptation_, and by it\r\nwe learn to understand how this same “primæval slime”—this same\r\nprotoplasm—can produce in the bodies of animals and plants the most\r\ndifferent and most complicated cellular forms.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, a matter of special interest that the most ancient\r\norganism, the remains of which are found in a petrified condition,\r\nbelongs to the Polythalamia. This organism is the “Canadian Life’s-dawn”\r\n(_Eozoon canadense_), which has already been mentioned, and which was\r\nfound a few years ago in the Ottawa formation (in the deepest strata of\r\nthe Laurentian system), on the Ottawa river in Canada. If we expected to\r\nfind organic remains at all in these most ancient deposits of the\r\nprimordial period, we should certainly look for such of the most simple\r\nProtista as are covered with a solid shell, and in the organization of\r\nwhich the difference between animal and plant is as yet not indicated.\r\n\r\nWe know of but few species of the _Sun-animalcules_ (Heliozoa), the\r\nsecond class of the Rhizopoda. One species is very frequently found in\r\nour fresh waters. It was observed even in the last century by a\r\nclergyman in Dantzig, Eichhorn by name, and it has been called after\r\nhim, Actinosphærium Eichhornii. To the naked eye it appears as a\r\ngelatinous grey globule of mucus, about the size of a pin’s head.\r\nLooking at it through the microscope, we see hundreds or thousands of\r\nfine mucous threads radiating from the central plasma body, and perceive\r\nthat the inner layer of its cell-substance is different from the outer\r\nlayer, which forms a bladder-like membrane. In consequence of its\r\nstructure, this, the little sun-animalcule, although wanting a shell,\r\nreally rises above the structureless Acyttaria, and forms the transition\r\nfrom these to the Radiolaria. The genus Cystophrys is of a nature akin\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThe _Basket-shells_ (Radiolaria) form the third and last class of the\r\nRhizopoda. Their lower forms are closely allied to the Heliozoa and\r\nAcyttaria, whereas their higher forms rise far above them. They are\r\nessentially distinguished from both by the fact that the central part of\r\ntheir body is composed of many cells, and surrounded by a solid\r\nmembrane. This closed “central capsule,” generally of a globular shape,\r\nis covered by a mucous layer of plasma, out of which there radiate on\r\nall sides thousands of exceedingly fine threads, the branching and\r\nconfluent so-called pseudopodia. Between these are scattered numerous\r\nyellow cells of unknown function, containing grains of starch. Most\r\nRadiolaria are characterized by a highly developed skeleton, which\r\nconsists of flint, and displays a wonderful richness of the neatest and\r\nmost curious forms. Sometimes this flinty skeleton forms a simple\r\ntrellice-work ball (Fig. 16 _s_), sometimes a marvellous system of\r\nseveral concentric trelliced balls, encased in one another, and\r\nconnected by radial staves. In most cases delicate spikes, which are\r\nfrequently branched like a tree, radiate from the surface of the balls.\r\nIn other cases the whole skeleton consists of only one flinty star, and\r\nis then generally composed of twenty staves, distributed according to\r\ndefinite mathematical laws, and united in a common central point. The\r\nskeletons of other Radiolaria again form symmetrical many-chambered\r\nstructures, as in the case of the Polythalamia. Perhaps no other group\r\nof organisms develop in the formation of their skeletons such an amount\r\nof various fundamental forms, such geometrical regularity, and such\r\nelegant architecture. Most of the forms as yet discovered, I have given\r\nin the atlas accompanying my Monograph of the Radiolaria.(23) Here I\r\nshall only give as an example the picture of one of the simplest forms,\r\nthe _Cyrtidosphæra echinoides_ of Nice. The skeleton in this case\r\nconsists only of a simple trelliced ball (_s_), with short radial spikes\r\n(_a_), which loosely surround the central capsule (_c_). Out of the\r\nmucous covering, enclosing the latter, radiate a great number of\r\ndelicate little pseudopodia (_p_), which are partly drawn back\r\nunderneath the shell, and fused into a lumpy mass of mucus. Between\r\nthese are scattered a number of yellow cells (_l_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Cyrtidosphæra echinoides, 400 times enlarged.\r\n_c._ Globular central capsule. _s._ Basket-work of the perforated flinty\r\nshell. _a._ Radial spikes, which radiate from the latter. _p._ The\r\npseudo-feet radiating from the mucous covering surrounding the central\r\ncapsule. _l._ Yellow globular cells, scattered between the latter,\r\ncontaining grains of starch.]\r\n\r\nMost Acyttaria live only at the bottom of the sea, on stones and\r\nseaweeds, or creep about in sand and mud by means of their pseudopodia,\r\nbut most Radiolaria swim on the surface of the sea by means of long\r\npseudopodia extending in all directions. They live together there in\r\nimmense numbers, but are mostly so small that they have been almost\r\ncompletely overlooked, and have only become accurately known during the\r\nlast fourteen years. Certain Radiolaria living in communities\r\n(Polycyttaria) form gelatinous lumps of some lines in diameter. On the\r\nother hand, most of those living isolated (Monocyttaria) are invisible\r\nto the naked eye; but still their petrified shells are found accumulated\r\nin such masses that in many places they form entire mountains; for\r\nexample, the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Archipelago, and the Island\r\nof Barbadoes in the Antilles.\r\n\r\nAs most readers are probably but little acquainted with the eight\r\nclasses of the Protista just mentioned, I shall now add some further\r\ngeneral observations on their natural history. The great majority of all\r\nProtista live in the sea, some swimming freely on the surface, some\r\ncreeping at the bottom, and others attached to stones, shells, plants,\r\netc. Many species of Protista also live in fresh water, but only a very\r\nsmall number on dry land (for example, Myxomycetes and some\r\nProtoplasta). Most of them can be seen only through the microscope,\r\nexcept when millions of individuals are found accumulated. Only a few of\r\nthem attain a diameter of some lines, or as much as an inch. What they\r\nlack in size of body they make up for by producing astonishing numbers\r\nof individuals, and they very considerably influence in this way the\r\neconomy of nature. The imperishable remains of dead Protista, for\r\ninstance, the flinty shells of the Diatomeæ and Radiolaria and the\r\ncalcareous shells of the Acyttaria, often form large rock masses.\r\n\r\nIn regard to their _vital phenomena_, especially those of nutrition and\r\npropagation, some Protista are more allied to plants, others more to\r\nanimals. Both in their mode of taking food and in the chemical changes\r\nof their living substance, they sometimes more resemble the lower\r\nanimals, at others the lower plants. _Free locomotion_ is possessed by\r\nmany Protista, while others are without it; but this does not constitute\r\na characteristic distinction, as we know of undoubted animals which\r\nentirely lack free locomotion, and of genuine plants which possess it.\r\nAll Protista have a _soul_—that is to say, are “animate”—as well as all\r\nanimals and all plants. The soul’s activity in the Protista manifests\r\nitself in their _irritability_, that is, in the movements and other\r\nchanges which take place in consequence of mechanical, electrical, and\r\nchemical irritation of their contractile protoplasm. Consciousness and\r\nthe capability of will and thought are probably wanting in all Protista.\r\nHowever, the same qualities are in the same degree also wanting in many\r\nof the lower animals, whereas many of the higher animals in these\r\nrespects are scarcely inferior to the lower races of human beings. In\r\nthe Protista, as in all other organisms, the activities of the soul are\r\ntraceable to molecular motions in the protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe most important _physiological characteristic_ of the kingdom\r\nProtista lies in the exclusively _non-sexual propagation_ of all the\r\norganisms belonging to it. The higher animals and plants multiply almost\r\nexclusively in a sexual manner. The lower animals and plants multiply\r\nalso, in many cases, in a non-sexual manner, by division, the formation\r\nof buds, the formation of germs, etc. But sexual propagation almost\r\nalways exists by the side of it, and often regularly alternates with it\r\nin succeeding generations (Metagenesis, vol. i. p. 206). All Protista,\r\non the other hand, propagate themselves exclusively in a non-sexual\r\nmanner, and in fact, the distinction of the two sexes among them has not\r\nbeen effected—there are neither male nor female Protista.\r\n\r\nThe Protista in regard to their vital phenomena stand midway between\r\nanimals and plants, that is to say, between their lowest forms; and the\r\nsame must be said in regard to the _chemical composition_ of their\r\nbodies. One of the most important distinctions between the chemical\r\ncomposition of animal and vegetable bodies consists in the\r\ncharacteristic formation of the skeleton. The skeleton, or the solid\r\nscaffolding of the body in most genuine plants, consists of a substance\r\ncalled cellulose, devoid of nitrogen, but secreted by the nitrogenous\r\ncell-substance, or protoplasm. In most genuine animals, on the other\r\nhand, the skeleton generally consists either of nitrogenous combinations\r\n(chitin, etc.) or of calcareous earth. In this respect some Protista are\r\nmore like plants, others more like animals. In many of them the skeleton\r\nis principally or entirely formed of calcareous earth, which is met with\r\nboth in animal and vegetable bodies. But the active vital substance in\r\nall cases is the mucous protoplasm.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the _form_ of the Protista, it is to be remarked that the\r\n_individuality_ of their body almost always remains at an extremely low\r\nstage of development. Very many Protista remain for life simple plastids\r\nor individuals of the first order. Others, indeed, form colonies or\r\nrepublics of plastids by the union of several individuals. But even\r\nthese higher individuals of the second order, formed by the combination\r\nof simple plastids, for the most part remain at a very low stage of\r\ndevelopment. The members of such communities among the Protista remain\r\nvery similar one to another, and never, or only in a slight degree,\r\ncommence a division of labour, and are consequently as little able to\r\nrender their community fit for higher functions as are, for example, the\r\nsavages of Australia. The community of the plastids remains in most\r\ncases very loose, and each single plastid retains in a great measure its\r\nown individual independence.\r\n\r\nA second structural characteristic, which next to their low stage of\r\nindividuality especially distinguishes the Protista, is the low stage of\r\ndevelopment of their stereometrical fundamental forms. As I have shown\r\nin my theory of fundamental forms (in the fourth book of the General\r\nMorphology), a definite geometrical fundamental form can be pointed out\r\nin most organisms, both in the general form of the body and in the form\r\nof the individual parts. This ideal fundamental form, or type, which is\r\ndetermined by the number, position, combination, and differentiation of\r\nthe component parts, stands in just the same relation to the _real_\r\norganic form as the ideal geometrical fundamental form of crystals does\r\nto their imperfect _real_ form. In most bodies and parts of the bodies\r\nof animals and plants this fundamental form is a pyramid. It is a\r\nregular pyramid in the so-called “regular radiate” forms, and an\r\nirregular pyramid in the more highly differentiated, so-called\r\n“bilaterally symmetrical” forms. (Compare the plates in the first volume\r\nof my General Morphology, pp. 556-558.) Among the Protista this\r\npyramidal type, which prevails in the animal and vegetable kingdom, is\r\non the whole rare, and instead of it we have either quite irregular\r\n(amorphous) or more simple, regular geometrical types; especially\r\nfrequent are the sphere, the cylinder, the ellipsoid, the spheroid, the\r\ndouble cone, the cone, the regular polygon (tetrahedron, hexahedron,\r\noctahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron), etc. All the fundamental forms\r\nof the pro-morphological system, which are of a low rank in that system,\r\nprevail in the Protista. However, in many Protista there occur also the\r\nhigher, regular, and bilateral types, fundamental forms which\r\npredominate in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In this respect some\r\nof the Protista are frequently more closely allied to animals (as the\r\nAcyttaria), others more so to plants (as the Radiolaria).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _palæontological development of the kingdom\r\nProtista_, we may form various, but necessarily very unsafe,\r\ngenealogical hypotheses. Perhaps the individual classes of the kingdom\r\nare independent tribes, or phyla, which have developed independently of\r\none another and independently of the animal and the vegetable kingdoms.\r\nEven if we adopt the monophyletic hypothesis of descent, and maintain a\r\ncommon origin from a single form of Moneron for all organisms, without\r\nexception, which ever have lived and still live upon the earth, even in\r\nthis case the connection of the neutral Protista on the one hand with\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, and on the other hand with the animal kingdom,\r\nmust be considered as very vague. We must regard them (compare p. 74) as\r\nlower off-shoots which have developed directly out of the root of the\r\ngreat double-branched organic pedigree, or perhaps out of the lowest\r\ntribe of Protista, which may be supposed to have shot up midway between\r\nthe two diverging high and vigorous trunks of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms. The individual classes of the Protista, whether they are more\r\nclosely connected at their roots in groups, or only form a loose bunch\r\nof root offsets, must in this case be regarded as having nothing to do\r\neither with the diverging groups of organisms belonging to the animal\r\nkingdom on the right, or to the vegetable kingdom on the left. They must\r\nbe supposed to have retained the original simple character of the common\r\nprimæval living thing more than have genuine animals and genuine plants.\r\n\r\nBut if we adopt the polyphyletic hypothesis of descent, we have to\r\nimagine a number of organic tribes, or phyla, which all shoot up by\r\nspontaneous generation out of the same ground, by the side of and\r\nindependent of one another. (Compare p. 75.) In that case numbers of\r\ndifferent Monera must have arisen by spontaneous generation whose\r\ndifferences would depend only upon slight, to us imperceptible,\r\ndifferences in their chemical composition, and consequently upon\r\ndifferences in their capability of development. A small number of Monera\r\nwould then have given origin to the animal kingdom, and, again, a small\r\nnumber would have produced the vegetable kingdom. Between these two\r\ngroups, however, there would have developed, independently of them, a\r\nlarge number of independent tribes, which have remained at a lower stage\r\nof organization, and which have neither developed into genuine plants\r\nnor into genuine animals.\r\n\r\nA safe means of deciding between the monophyletic and polyphyletic\r\nhypotheses is as yet quite impossible, considering the imperfect state\r\nof our phylogenetic knowledge. The different groups of Protista, and\r\nthose lowest forms of the animal kingdom and of the vegetable kingdom\r\nwhich are scarcely distinguishable from the Protista, show such a close\r\nconnection with one another and such a confused mixture of\r\ncharacteristics, that at present any systematic division and arrangement\r\nof the groups of forms seem more or less artificial and forced. Hence\r\nthe attempt here offered must be regarded as entirely provisional. But\r\nthe more deeply we penetrate into the genealogical secrets of this\r\nobscure domain of inquiry, the more probable appears the idea that the\r\nvegetable kingdom and the animal kingdom are each of independent origin,\r\nand that midway between these two great pedigrees a number of other\r\nindependent small groups of organisms have arisen by repeated acts of\r\nspontaneous generation, which on account of their indifferent neutral\r\ncharacter, and in consequence of their mixture of animal and vegetable\r\nproperties, may lay claim to the designation of independent Protista.\r\n\r\n\r\n         II.

In order to make this relation more clear, we may imagine the\r\nwhole world of organisms as an immense meadow which is partially\r\nwithered, and upon which two many-branched and mighty trees are\r\nstanding, likewise partially withered. The two great trees represent the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms, their fresh and still green branches the\r\nliving animals and plants; the dead branches with withered leaves\r\nrepresent the extinct groups. The withered grass of the meadow\r\ncorresponds to the numerous extinct tribes, and the few stalks, still\r\ngreen, to the still living phyla of the kingdom Protista. But the common\r\nsoil of the meadow, from which all have sprung up, is primæval by\r\nprotoplasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nPEDIGREE AND HISTORY OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Natural System of the Vegetable Kingdom.—Division of the\r\n  Vegetable Kingdom into Six Branches and Eighteen Classes.—The\r\n  Flowerless Plants (Cryptogamia).—Sub-kingdom of the Thallus\r\n  Plants.—The Tangles, or Algæ (Primary Algæ, Green Algæ, Brown\r\n  Algæ, Red Algæ).—The Thread-plants, or Inophytes (Lichens and\r\n  Fungi).—Sub-kingdom of the Prothallus Plants.—The Mosses, or\r\n  Muscinæ (Water-mosses, Liverworts, Leaf-mosses,\r\n  Bog-mosses).—The Ferns, or Filicinæ (Leaf-ferns, Bamboo-ferns,\r\n  Water-ferns, Scale-ferns).—Sub-kingdom of Flowering Plants\r\n  (Phanerogamia).—The Gymnosperms, or Plants with Naked Seeds\r\n  (Palm-ferns = Cycadeæ; Pines = Coniferæ).—The Angiosperms, or\r\n  Plants with Enclosed Seeds.—Monocotylæ.—Dicotylæ.—Cup-blossoms\r\n  (Apetalæ).—Star-blossoms (Diapetalæ).—Bell-blossoms\r\n  (Gamopetalæ).\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery attempt that we make to gain a knowledge of the pedigree of any\r\nsmall or large group of organisms related by blood must, in the first\r\ninstance, start with the evidence afforded by the existing “_natural\r\nsystem_” of this group. For although the natural system of animals and\r\nplants will never become finally settled, but will always represent a\r\nmerely approximate knowledge of true blood relationship, still it will\r\nalways possess great importance as a hypothetical pedigree. It is true,\r\nby a “natural system” most zoologists and botanists only endeavour to\r\nexpress in a concise way the subjective conceptions which each has\r\nformed of the objective “_form-relationships_” of organisms. These\r\nform-relationships, however, as the reader has seen, are in reality the\r\nnecessary result of true _blood relationship_. Consequently, every\r\nmorphologist in promoting our knowledge of the natural system, at the\r\nsame time promotes our knowledge of the pedigree, whether he wishes it\r\nor not. The more the natural system deserves its name, and the more\r\nfirmly it is established upon the concordance of results obtained from\r\nthe study of comparative anatomy, ontogeny, and palæontology, the more\r\nsurely may we consider it as the approximate expression of the true\r\npedigree of the organic world.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the task contemplated in this chapter, the genealogy of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, we shall have, according to this principle, first\r\nto glance at the _natural system of the vegetable kingdom_ as it is at\r\npresent (with more or less important modifications) adopted by most\r\nbotanists. According to the system generally in vogue, the whole series\r\nof vegetable forms is divided into two main groups. These main\r\ndivisions, or sub-kingdoms, are the same as were distinguished more than\r\na century ago by Charles Linnæus, the founder of systematic natural\r\nhistory, and which he called _Cryptogamia_, or secretly-blossoming\r\nplants, and _Phanerogamia_, or openly-flowering plants. The latter,\r\nLinnæus, in his artificial system of plants, divided, according to the\r\ndifferent number, formation, and combination of the anthers, and also\r\naccording to the distribution of the sexual organs, into twenty-three\r\ndifferent classes, and then added the Cryptogamia to these as the\r\ntwenty-fourth and last class.\r\n\r\nThe _Cryptogamia_, the secretly-blossoming or flowerless plants, which\r\nwere formerly but little observed, have in consequence of the careful\r\ninvestigations of recent times been proved to present such a great\r\nvariety of forms, and such a marked difference in their coarser and\r\nfiner structure, that we must distinguish no less than fourteen\r\ndifferent classes of them; whereas the number of classes of flowering\r\nplants, or _Phanerogamia_, may be limited to four. However, these\r\n_eighteen classes of the vegetable kingdom_ can again be naturally\r\ngrouped in such a manner that we are able to distinguish in all _six\r\nmain divisions_ or _branches_ of the vegetable kingdom. Two of these six\r\nbranches belong to the flowering, and four to the flowerless plants. The\r\ntable on page 82 shows how the eighteen classes are distributed among\r\nthe six branches, and how these again fall under the _sub-kingdoms_ of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe one sub-kingdom of the _Cryptogamia_ may now be naturally divided\r\ninto _two_ divisions, or sub-kingdoms, differing very essentially in\r\ntheir internal structure and in their external form, namely, the Thallus\r\nplants and the Prothallus plants. The group of _Thallus plants_\r\ncomprises the two large branches of Tangles, or Algæ, which live in\r\nwater, and the Thread-plants, or Inophytes (Lichens and Fungi), which\r\ngrow on land, upon stones, bark of trees, upon decaying bodies, etc. The\r\ngroup of _Prothallus plants_, on the other hand, comprises the two\r\nbranches of Mosses and Ferns, containing a great variety of forms.\r\n\r\nAll _Thallus plants, or Thallophytes_, can be directly recognized from\r\nthe fact that the two morphological fundamental organs of all other\r\nplants, stem and leaves, cannot be distinguished in their structure. The\r\ncomplete body of all Algæ and of all Thread-plants is a mass composed of\r\nsimple cells, which is called a _lobe_, or _thallus_. This thallus is\r\nas yet not differentiated into axial-organs (stem and root) and\r\nleaf-organs. On this account, as well as through many other\r\npeculiarities, the Thallophytes contrast strongly with all remaining\r\nplants—those comprised under the two sub-kingdoms of Prothallus plants\r\nand Flowering plants—and for this reason the two latter sub-kingdoms are\r\nfrequently classed together under the name of _Stemmed plants_, or\r\n_Cormophytes_. The following table will explain the relation of these\r\nthree sub-kingdoms to one another according to the two different views:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                         { A. Thallus Plants      }  I.

Flowering Plants    }\r\n    (_Phanerogamia_)     {    (_Phanerogamia_)    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stemmed plants, or Cormophytes, in the organization of which the\r\ndifference of axial-organs (stem and root) and leaf-organs is already\r\ndeveloped, form at present, and have, indeed, for a very long period\r\nformed, the principal portion of the vegetable world. However, this was\r\nnot always the case. In fact, stemmed plants, not only of the flowering\r\ngroup, but even of the prothallus group, did not exist at all during\r\nthat immeasurably long space of time which forms the beginning of the\r\nfirst great division of the organic history of the earth, under the name\r\nof the archilithic, or primordial period. The reader will recollect that\r\nduring this period the Laurentian, Cambrian, and Silurian systems of\r\nstrata were deposited, the thickness of which, taken as a whole,\r\namounts to about 70,000 feet. Now, as the thickness of all the more\r\nrecent super-incumbent strata, from the Devonian to the deposits of the\r\npresent time, taken together, amounts to only about 60,000 feet, we were\r\nenabled from this fact alone to draw the conclusion—which is probable\r\nalso for other reasons—that the archilithic, or primordial, period was\r\nof longer duration than the whole succeeding period down to the present\r\ntime. During the whole of this immeasurable space of time, which\r\nprobably comprises many millions of centuries, vegetable life on our\r\nearth seems to have been represented exclusively by the sub-kingdom of\r\nThallus plants, and, moreover, only by the class of marine Thallus\r\nplants, that is to say, the Algæ. At least all the petrified remains\r\nwhich are positively known to be of the primordial period belong\r\nexclusively to this class. As all the animal remains of this immense\r\nperiod also belong exclusively to animals that lived in water, we come\r\nto the conclusion that at that time organisms adapted to a life on land\r\ndid not exist at all.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the first and most imperfect of the great provinces or\r\nbranches of the vegetable kingdom, the division of the Algæ, or Tangles,\r\nmust be of special interest to us. But, in addition, there is the\r\ninterest which this group offers when viewed by itself. In spite of the\r\nexceedingly simple composition of their constituent cells, which are but\r\nlittle differentiated, the Algæ show an extraordinary variety of\r\ndifferent forms. To them belong the simplest and most imperfect of all\r\nforms, as well as very highly developed and peculiar forms. The\r\ndifferent groups of Algæ are distinguished as much by size of body as by\r\nthe perfection and variety of their outer form. At the lowest stage we\r\nfind such species as the minute Protococcus, several hundred thousands\r\nof which occupy a space no larger than a pin’s head. At the highest\r\nstage we marvel at the gigantic Macrocysts, which attain a length of\r\nfrom 300 to 400 feet, the longest of all forms in the vegetable kingdom.\r\nIt is possible that a large portion of the coal has been formed out of\r\nAlgæ. If not for these reasons, yet the Algæ must excite our special\r\nattention from the fact that they form the beginning of vegetable life,\r\nand contain the original forms of all other groups of plants, supposing\r\nthat our monophyletic hypothesis of a common origin for all groups of\r\nplants is correct.

The slimy green aquatic filaments and flakes of our pools\r\nand ditches and springs, the light green slimy coverings of all kinds of\r\nwood which have for any length of time been in contact with water, the\r\nyellowish green, frothy, and oozy growths of our village ponds, the\r\ngreen filaments resembling tufts of hair which occur everywhere in fresh\r\nwater, stagnant and flowing, are for the most part composed of different\r\nspecies of Algæ. Only those who have visited the sea-shore, and wondered\r\nat the immense masses of cast-up seaweed, and who, from the rocky coast\r\nof the Mediterranean, have seen through the clear blue waters the\r\nbeautifully-formed and highly-coloured vegetation of Algæ at the bottom,\r\nknow how to estimate the importance of the class of Algæ. And yet, even\r\nthese marine Algæ-forests of European shores, so rich in forms, give\r\nonly a faint idea of the colossal forests of Sargasso in the Atlantic\r\nocean, those immense banks of Algæ, covering a space of about 40,000\r\nsquare miles—the same which made Columbus, on his voyage of discovery,\r\nbelieve that a continent was near. Similar but far more extensive\r\nforests of Algæ grew in the primæval ocean, probably in dense masses,\r\nand what countless generations of these archilithic Algæ have died out\r\none after another is attested, among other facts, by the vast thickness\r\nof Silurian alum schists in Sweden, the peculiar composition of which\r\nproceeds from those masses of submarine Algæ. According to the recently\r\nexpressed opinion of Frederick Mohr, a geologist of Bonn, even the\r\ngreater part of our coal seams have arisen out of the accumulated dead\r\nbodies of the Algæ forests of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWithin the branch of the Algæ we distinguish four different classes,\r\neach of which is again divided into several orders and families. These\r\nagain contain a large number of different genera and species. We\r\ndesignate these four classes as Primæval Algæ, or Archephyceæ, Green\r\nAlgæ, or Chlorophyceæ, Brown Algæ, or Phæophyceæ, and Red Algæ, or\r\nRhodophyceæ.\r\n\r\nThe first class of Algæ, the _Primæval_ Algæ (Archephyceæ), might also\r\nbe called _primæval plants_, because they contain the simplest and most\r\nimperfect of all plants, and, among them, those most ancient of all\r\nvegetable organisms out of which all other plants have originated. To\r\nthem therefore belong those most ancient of all vegetable Monera which\r\narose by spontaneous generation in the beginning of the Laurentian\r\nperiod. Further, we have to reckon among them all those vegetable forms\r\nof the simplest organization which first developed out of the Monera in\r\nthe Laurentian period, and which possessed the form of a single\r\nplastid. At first the entire body of one of these small primary plants\r\nconsisted only of a most simple cytod (a plastid without kernel), and\r\nafterwards attained the higher form of a simple cell, by the separation\r\nof a kernel in the plasma. (Compare above, vol. i. p. 345.) Even at the\r\npresent day there exist various most simple forms of Algæ which have\r\ndeviated but little from the original primary plants. Among them are the\r\nAlgæ of the families Codiolaceæ, Protococcaceæ, Desmidiaceæ,\r\nPalmellaceæ, Hydrodictyeæ, and several others. The remarkable group of\r\nPhycochromaceæ (Chroococcaceæ and Oscillarineæ) might also be comprised\r\namong them, unless we prefer to consider them as an independent tribe of\r\nthe kingdom Protista.\r\n\r\nThe monoplastic Protophyta—that is, those primary Algæ formed by a\r\nsingle plastid—are of the greatest interest, because the vegetable\r\norganism in this case completes its whole course of life as a perfectly\r\nsimple “individual of the first order,” either as a cytod without\r\nkernel, or as a cell containing a kernel.\r\n\r\nAmong the primary plants consisting of a single cytod are the\r\nexceedingly remarkable Siphoneæ, which are of considerable size, and\r\nstrangely “mimic” the forms of higher plants. Many of the Siphoneæ\r\nattain a size of several feet, and resemble an elegant moss (Bryopsis),\r\nor in some cases a perfect flowering plant with stalks, roots, and\r\nleaves (Caulerpa) (Fig. 17). Yet the whole of this large body,\r\nexternally so variously differentiated, consists internally of an\r\nentirely simple sack, possessing the negative characters of a simple\r\ncytod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Caulerpa denticulata, a monoplastic Siphonean\r\n_of the natural size_. The entire branching primary plant, which appears\r\nto consist of a creeping stalk with fibrous roots and indented leaves,\r\nis in reality only _a single plastid_, and moreover a cytod (without a\r\nkernel), not even attaining the grade of a cell with nucleus.]\r\n\r\nThese curious Siphoneæ, Vaucheriæ, and Caulerpæ show us to how great a\r\ndegree of elaboration a single cytod, although a most simple individual\r\nof the first order, can develop by continuous adaptation to the\r\nrelations of the outer world. Even the _single-celled primary\r\nplants_—which are distinguished from the monocytods by possessing a\r\nkernel—develop into a great variety of exquisite forms by adaptation;\r\nthis is the case especially with the beautiful _Desmidiaceæ_, of which\r\na species of Euastrum is represented in Fig. 18 as a specimen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Euastrum rota, a single-celled Desmid, much\r\nenlarged. The whole of the star-shaped body of this primæval plant has\r\nthe formal value of a simple cell. In its centre lies the kernel, and\r\nwithin this the kernel corpuscle, or speck.]\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that similar primæval plants, the soft body of\r\nwhich, however, was not capable of being preserved in a fossil state, at\r\none time peopled the Laurentian primæval sea in great masses and\r\nvarieties, and in a great abundance of forms, without, however, going\r\nbeyond the stage of individuality of a simple plastid.\r\n\r\nThe group of _Green Tangles_ (Chlorophyceæ), or _Green Algæ_\r\n(Cloroalgæ), are the second class, and the most closely allied to the\r\nprimæval group. Like the majority of the Archephyceæ, all the\r\nChlorophyceæ are coloured green, and by the same colouring matter—the\r\nsubstance called leaf-green, or chlorophyll—which colours the leaves of\r\nall the higher plants.\r\n\r\nTo this class belong, besides a great number of low marine Algæ, most of\r\nthe Algæ of fresh water, the common water hair-weeds, or Confervæ, the\r\ngreen slime-balls, or Glœosphæræ, the bright green water-lettuce, or\r\nUlva, which resembles a very thin and long lettuce leaf, and also\r\nnumerous small microscopic algæ, dense masses of which form a light\r\ngreen shiny covering to all sorts of objects lying in water—wood,\r\nstones, etc.\r\n\r\nThese forms, however, rise above the simple primary Algæ in the\r\ncomposition and differentiation of their body. As the green Algæ, like\r\nthe primæval Algæ, mostly possess a very soft body, they are but rarely\r\ncapable of being petrified. However, it can scarcely be doubted that\r\nthis class of Algæ—which was the first to develop out of the preceding\r\none—most extensively and variously peopled the fresh and salt waters of\r\nthe earth in early times.\r\n\r\nIn the third class, that of the _Brown Tangles_ (Phæophyceæ), or _Black\r\nAlgæ_ (Fucoideæ), the _branch_ of the Algæ attains its highest stage of\r\ndevelopment, at least in regard to size and body. The characteristic\r\ncolour of the Fucoid is more or less dark brown, sometimes tending more\r\nto an olive green or yellowish green, sometimes more to a brownish red\r\nor black colour.\r\n\r\nAmong these are the largest of all Algæ, which are at the same time the\r\nlongest of all plants, namely, the colossal giant Algæ, amongst which\r\nthe Macrocystis pyrifera, on the coast of California, attains a length\r\nof 400 feet. Also, among our indigenous Algæ, the largest forms belong\r\nto this group. Especially I may mention here the stately sugar-tangle\r\n(Laminaria), whose slimy, olive green thallus-body, resembling gigantic\r\nleaves of from 10 to 15 feet in length, and from a half to one foot in\r\nbreadth, are thrown up in great masses on the coasts of the North and\r\nBaltic seas.\r\n\r\nTo this class belongs also the bladder-wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) common\r\nin our seas, whose fork-shaped, deeply-cut leaves are kept floating on\r\nthe water by numerous air bladders (as is the case, too, with many other\r\nbrown Algæ). The freely floating Sargasso Alga (Sargasso bacciferum),\r\nwhich forms the meadows or forests of the Sargasso Sea, also belongs to\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nAlthough each individual of these large alga-trees is composed of many\r\nmillions of cells, yet at the beginning of its existence it consists,\r\nlike all higher plants, of a single cell—a simple egg. This egg—for\r\nexample, in the case of our common bladder-wrack—is a naked, uncovered\r\ncell, and as such is so like the naked egg-cells of lower marine\r\nanimals—for example, those of the Medusæ—that they might easily be\r\nmistaken one for another (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—The egg of the common bladder-wrack (Fucus\r\nvesiculosus), a simple naked cell, much enlarged. In the centre of the\r\nnaked globule of protoplasm the bright kernel is visible.]\r\n\r\nIt was probably the Fucoideæ, or Brown Algæ, which during the primordial\r\nperiod, to a great extent constituted the characteristic alga-forests of\r\nthat immense space of time. Their petrified remains, especially those\r\nof the Silurian period, which have been preserved, can, it is true,\r\ngive us but a faint idea of them, because the material of these Algæ,\r\nlike that of most others, is ill-suited for preservation in a fossil\r\nstate. As has already been remarked, a large portion of coal is perhaps\r\ncomposed of them.\r\n\r\nLess important is the fourth class of Algæ, that of the _Rose-coloured\r\nAlgæ_ (Rhodophyceæ), or _Red Sea-weeds_ (Florideæ). This class, it is\r\ntrue, presents a great number of different forms; but most of them are\r\nof much smaller size than the Brown Algæ. Although they are inferior to\r\nthe latter in perfection and differentiation, they far surpass them in\r\nsome other respects. To them belong the most beautiful and elegant of\r\nall Algæ, which on account of the fine plumose division of their\r\nleaf-like bodies, and also on account of their pure and delicate red\r\ncolour, are among the most charming of plants. The characteristic red\r\ncolour sometimes appears as a deep purple, sometimes as a glowing\r\nscarlet, sometimes as a delicate rose tint, and may verge into violet\r\nand bluish purple, or on the other hand into brown and green tints of\r\nmarvellous splendour. Whoever has visited one of our sea-coast watering\r\nplaces, must have admired the lovely forms of the Florideæ, which are\r\nfrequently dried on white paper and offered for sale.\r\n\r\nMost of the Red Algæ are so delicate, that they are quite incapable of\r\nbeing petrified; this is the case with the splendid Ptilotes, Plocamia,\r\nDelesseria, etc. However, there are individual forms, like the Chondria\r\nand Sphærococca, which possess a harder thallus, often almost as hard as\r\ncartilage, and of these fossil remains have been preserved—principally\r\nin the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous strata, and later in the\r\noolites. It is probable that this class also had an important share in\r\nthe composition of the archilithic Algæ flora.\r\n\r\nIf we now again take into consideration the flora of the primordial\r\nperiod, which was exclusively formed by the group of Algæ, we can see\r\nthat it is not improbable that its four subordinate classes had a share\r\nin the composition of those submarine forests of the primæval oceans,\r\nsimilar to that which the four types of vegetation—trees with trunks,\r\nflowering shrubs, grass, and tender leaf-ferns and mosses—at present\r\ntake in the composition of our recent land forests.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose that the submarine tree forests of the primordial period\r\nwere formed by the huge Brown Algæ, or Fucoideæ. The many-coloured\r\nflowers at the foot of these gigantic trees were represented by the gay\r\nRed Algæ, or Florideæ. The green grass between was formed by the\r\nhair-like bunches of Green Algæ, or Chloroalgæ. Finally, the tender\r\nfoliage of ferns and mosses, which at present cover the ground of our\r\nforests, fill the crevices left by other plants, and even settle on the\r\ntrunks of the trees, at that time probably had representatives in the\r\nmoss and fern-like Siphoneæ, in the Caulerpa and Bryopsis, from among\r\nthe class of the primary Algæ, Protophyta, or Archephyceæ.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the relationships of the different classes of Algæ to one\r\nanother and to other plants, it is exceedingly probable that the Primary\r\nAlgæ, or Archephyceæ, as already remarked, form the common root of the\r\npedigree, not merely for the different classes of Algæ, but for the\r\nwhole vegetable kingdom. On this account they may with justice be\r\ndesignated as primæval plants, or Protophyta.\r\n\r\nOut of the naked vegetable Monera, in the beginning of the Laurentian\r\nperiod, enclosed cytods were probably the first to arise (vol. i. p.\r\n345), by the naked, structureless, albuminous substance of the Monera\r\nbecoming condensed in the form of a pellicle on the surface, or by\r\nsecreting a membrane. At a later period, out of these enclosed cytods\r\ngenuine vegetable cells probably arose, as a kernel or nucleus separated\r\nitself in the interior from the surrounding cell-substance or plasma.\r\n\r\nThe three classes of Green Algæ, Brown Algæ, and Red Algæ, are perhaps\r\nthree distinct classes, which have arisen independently of one another\r\nout of the common radical group of Primæval Algæ, and then developed\r\nthemselves further (each according to its kind), and have variously\r\nbranched off into orders and families. The Brown and Red Algæ possess no\r\nclose blood relationship to the other classes of the vegetable kingdom.\r\nThese latter have most probably arisen out of the Primæval Algæ, either\r\ndirectly or by the intermediate step of the Green Algæ.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Mosses (out of which, at a later time, Ferns\r\ndeveloped) proceeded from a group of Green Algæ, and that Fungi and\r\nLichens proceeded from a group of Primæval Algæ. The Phanerogamia\r\ndeveloped at a much later period out of Ferns.\r\n\r\nAs a second class of the Vegetable Kingdom we have above mentioned the\r\n_Thread-plants_ (Inophyta). We understood by this term the two closely\r\nrelated classes of _Lichens_ and _Fungi_. It is possible that these\r\nThallus plants have not arisen out of the Primæval Algæ, but out of one\r\nor more Monera, which, independently of the latter, arose by spontaneous\r\ngeneration. It appears conceivable that many of the lowest Fungi, as for\r\nexample, many ferment-causing fungi (forms of Micrococcus, etc.), owe\r\ntheir origin to a number of different _archigonic_ Monera (that is,\r\nMonera originating by spontaneous generation).\r\n\r\nIn any case the Thread-plants cannot be considered as the progenitors of\r\nany of the higher vegetable classes. Lichens, as well as fungi, are\r\ndistinct from the higher plants in the composition of their soft bodies,\r\nconsisting as it does of a dense felt-work of very long, variously\r\ninterwoven, and peculiar threads or chains of cells—the so-called\r\n_hyphæ_, on which account we distinguish them as a province under the\r\nname Thread-plants. From their peculiar nature they could not leave any\r\nimportant fossil remains, and consequently we can form only a very vague\r\nguess at their palæontological development.\r\n\r\nThe first class of Thread-plants, the _Fungi_, exhibit a very close\r\nrelationship to the lowest Algæ; the Algo-fungi, or Phycomycetes (the\r\nSaprolegniæ and Peronosporæ) in reality only differ from the\r\nbladder-wracks and Siphoneæ (the Vaucheria and Caulerpa) mentioned\r\npreviously by the want of leaf-green, or chlorophyll. But, on the other\r\nhand, all genuine Fungi have so many peculiarities, and deviate so much\r\nfrom other plants, especially in their mode of taking food, that they\r\nmight be considered as an entirely distinct province of the vegetable\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nOther plants live mostly upon inorganic food, upon simple combinations\r\nwhich they render more complicated. They produce protoplasm by the\r\ncombination of water, carbonic acid, and ammonia. They take in carbonic\r\nacid and give out oxygen. But the Fungi, like animals, live upon organic\r\nfood, consisting of complicated combinations of carbon, which they\r\nreceive from other organisms and assimilate. They inhale oxygen and\r\ngive out carbonic acid like animals. They also never form leaf-green, or\r\nchlorophyll, which is so characteristic of most other plants. In like\r\nmanner they never produce starch. Hence many eminent botanists have\r\nrepeatedly proposed to remove the Fungi completely out of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and to regard them as a special and third kingdom, between that\r\nof animals and plants. By this means our kingdom of Protista would be\r\nconsiderably increased. The Fungi in this case would, in the first\r\nplace, be allied to the so-called “slime moulds,” or Myxomycetes (which,\r\nhowever, never form any hyphæ). But as many Fungi propagate in a sexual\r\nmanner, and as most botanists, according to the prevalent opinion, look\r\nupon Fungi as genuine plants, we shall here leave them in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and connect them with lichens, to which they are at all events\r\nmost nearly related.\r\n\r\nThe phyletic origin of Fungi will probably long remain obscure. The\r\nclose relationship already hinted at between the Phycomycetes and\r\nSiphoneæ (especially between the Saprolegniæ and Vaucheriæ) suggests to\r\nus that they are derived from the latter. Fungi would then have to be\r\nconsidered as Algæ, which by adaptation to a parasitical life have\r\nbecome very peculiarly transformed. Many facts, however, support the\r\nsupposition that the lowest fungi have originated independently from\r\narchigonic Monera.\r\n\r\nThe second class of Inophyta, the _Lichens_ (Lichenes), are very\r\nremarkable in relation to phylogeny; for the surprising discoveries of\r\nlate years have taught us that every Lichen is really composed of two\r\ndistinct plants—of a low form of Alga (Nostochaceæ, Chroococcaceæ), and\r\nof a parasitic form of Fungus (Ascomycetes), which lives as a parasite\r\nupon the former, and upon the nutritive substances prepared by it. The\r\ngreen cells, containing chlorophyll (gonidia), which are found in every\r\nlichen, belong to the Alga. But the colourless threads (hyphæ) which,\r\ndensely interwoven, form the principal mass of the body of Lichens,\r\nbelong to the parasitic Fungus. But in all cases the two forms of\r\nplants—Fungus and Alga—which are always considered as members of two\r\nquite distinct provinces of the vegetable kingdom, are so firmly united,\r\nand so thoroughly interwoven, that nearly every one looks upon a Lichen\r\nas a single organism.\r\n\r\nMost Lichens form small, more or less formless or irregularly indented,\r\ncrust-like coverings to stones, bark of trees, etc. Their colour varies\r\nthrough all possible tints, from the purest white to yellow, red, green,\r\nbrown, and the deepest black.\r\n\r\nMany lichens are important in the economy of nature from the fact that\r\nthey can settle in the driest and most barren localities, especially on\r\nnaked rocks upon which no other plant can live. The hard black lava,\r\nwhich covers many square miles of ground in volcanic regions, and which\r\nfor centuries frequently presents the most determined opposition to the\r\nlife of every kind of vegetation, is always first occupied by Lichens.\r\nIt is the white or grey Lichens (Stereocaulon) which, in the most\r\ndesolate and barren fields of lava, always begin to prepare the naked\r\nrocky ground for cultivation, and conquer it for subsequent higher\r\nvegetation. Their decaying bodies form the first mould in which mosses,\r\nferns, and flowering plants can afterwards take firm root. Hardy Lichens\r\nare also less affected by the severity of climate than any other plants.\r\nHence the naked rocks, even in the highest mountains—for the most part\r\ncovered by eternal snow, on which no plant could thrive—are encrusted by\r\nthe dry bodies of Lichens.\r\n\r\nLeaving now the Fungi, Lichens, and Algæ, which are comprised under the\r\nname of Thallus plants, we enter upon the second sub-kingdom of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, that of the _Prothallus plants_ (Prothallophyta),\r\nwhich by some botanists are called phyllogonic Cryptogamia (in\r\ncontradistinction to the Thallus plants, or thallogonic Cryptogamia).\r\nThis sub-kingdom comprises the two provinces of _Mosses_ and _Ferns_.\r\n\r\nHere we meet with (except in a few of the lowest forms) the separation\r\nof the vegetable body into two different fundamental organs,\r\naxial-organs (stem and root) and leaves (or lateral organs). In this the\r\nProthallus plants resemble the Flowering plants, and hence the two\r\ngroups have recently often been classed together as stemmed plants, or\r\nCormophytes.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, Mosses and Ferns resemble the Thallus plants, in\r\nthe absence of the development of flowers and seeds, and even Linnæus\r\nclassed them with these, as Cryptogamia, in contradistinction to the\r\nplants forming seeds; that is, flowering plants (Anthophyta or\r\nPhanerogamia).\r\n\r\nUnder the name of “Prothallus plants” we combine the closely-related\r\nMosses and Ferns, because both exhibit a peculiar and characteristic\r\n“alternation of generation” in the course of their individual\r\ndevelopment. For every species exhibits two different generations, of\r\nwhich the one is usually called the _Prothallium_, or _Fore-growth_, the\r\nother is spoken of as the _Cormus_, or actual _Stem_ of the moss or\r\nfern.\r\n\r\nThe first and original generation, the Fore-growth, or Prothallus, also\r\ncalled Protonema, still remains in that lower stage of elaboration\r\nmanifested throughout life by all Thallus plants; that is to say, stem\r\nand leaf-organs have as yet not differentiated, and the entire cell-mass\r\nof the Fore-growth corresponds to a simple thallus. The second and more\r\nperfect generation of mosses and ferns—the Stem, or Cormus—develops a\r\nmuch more highly elaborate body, which has differentiated into stalk and\r\nleaf (as in the case of flowering plants), except in the lowest mosses,\r\nwhere this generation also remains in the lower stage of the thallus.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these latter forms the first generation of Mosses\r\nand Ferns (the thallus-shaped Fore-growth) always produces a second\r\ngeneration with stem and leaves; the latter in its turn produces the\r\nthallus of the first generation, and so on. Thus, in this case, as in\r\nthe ordinary cases of alternation of generation in animals, the first\r\ngeneration is like the third, fifth, etc., the second like the fourth,\r\nsixth, etc. (Compare vol. i. p. 206.)\r\n\r\nOf the two main classes of Prothallus plants, the Mosses in general are\r\nat a much lower stage of development than the Ferns, and their lowest\r\nforms (especially in an anatomical respect) form the transition from the\r\nThallus plants through the Algæ to Ferns. The genealogical connection of\r\nMosses and Ferns which is indicated by this fact can, however, be\r\ninferred only from the case of the most imperfect forms of the two\r\nclasses; for the more perfect and higher groups of mosses and ferns do\r\nnot stand in any close relation to one another, and develop in\r\ncompletely opposite directions. In any case Mosses have arisen directly\r\nout of Thallus plants, and probably out of Green Algæ.\r\n\r\nFerns, on the other hand, are probably derived from extinct unknown\r\nMosses, which were very nearly related to the lowest liverworts of the\r\npresent day. In the history of creation, Ferns are of greater importance\r\nthan Mosses.\r\n\r\nThe branch of _Mosses_ (Muscinæ, also called Musci, or Bryophyta)\r\ncontains the lower and more imperfect plants of the group of\r\nProthallophytes, which as yet do not possess vessels. Their bodies are\r\nmostly so tender and perishable that they are very ill-suited for being\r\npreserved in a recognizable state as fossils. Hence the fossil remains\r\nof all classes of Mosses are rare and insignificant. It is probable that\r\nMosses developed in very early times out of the Thallus plants, or, to\r\nbe more precise, out of the Green Algæ. It is probable that in the\r\nprimordial period there existed aquatic forms of transition from the\r\nlatter to Mosses, and in the primary period to those living on land. The\r\nMosses of the present day—out of the gradually differentiating\r\ndevelopment of which comparative anatomy may draw some inferences as to\r\ntheir genealogy—are divided into two different classes, namely: (1)\r\nLiverworts; (2) Leafy Mosses.\r\n\r\nThe first and oldest class of Mosses, which is directly allied to the\r\nGreen Algæ, or Confervæ, is formed by the _Liverworts_ (Hepaticæ, or\r\nThallobrya). The mosses belonging to them are, for the most part, small\r\nand insignificant in form, and are little known. Their lowest forms\r\nstill possess, in both generations, a simple thallus like the Thallus\r\nplants; as for example, the Ricciæ and Marchantiaceæ. But the more\r\nhighly developed liverworts, the Jungermanniaceæ and those akin to them,\r\ngradually commence to differentiate stem and leaf, and their most\r\nhighly-developed forms are closely allied to leaf-mosses. By this\r\ntransitional series the liverworts show their direct derivation from\r\nthe Thallophytes, and more especially from the Green Algæ.\r\n\r\nThe Mosses, which are generally the only ones known to the\r\nuninitiated—and which, in fact, form the principal portion of the whole\r\nbranch—belong to the second class, or _Leafy Mosses_ (Musci frondosi,\r\ncalled Musci in a narrow sense, also Phyllobrya). Among them are most of\r\nthose pretty little plants which, united in dense groups, form the\r\nbright glossy carpet of moss in our woods, or which, in company with\r\nliverworts and lichens, cover the bark of trees. As reservoirs,\r\ncarefully storing up moisture, they are of the greatest importance in\r\nthe economy of nature. Wherever man mercilessly cuts down and destroys\r\nforests, there, as a consequence, disappear the leafy mosses which\r\ncovered the bark of the trees, or, protected by their shade, clothed the\r\nground, and filled the spaces between the larger plants. Together with\r\nthe leafy mosses disappear the useful reservoirs which stored up rain\r\nand dew for times of drought. Thus arises a disastrous dryness of the\r\nground, which prevents the growth of any rich vegetation. In the greater\r\npart of Southern Europe—in Greece, Italy, Sicily, and Spain—mosses have\r\nbeen destroyed by the inconsiderate extirpation of forests, and the\r\nground has thereby been robbed of its most useful stores of moisture;\r\nonce flourishing and rich tracts of land have been changed into dry and\r\nbarren wastes. Unfortunately in Germany, also, this rude barbarism is\r\nbeginning to prevail more and more. It is probable that the small\r\nfrondose mosses have played this exceedingly important part in nature\r\nfor a very long time, possibly from the beginning of the primary period.\r\nBut as their tender bodies are as little suited as those of all other\r\nmosses for being preserved in a fossil state, palæontology can give us\r\nno information about this.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the science of petrifactions much more than we do in the\r\ncase of Mosses of the importance which the second branch of Prothallus\r\nplants—that is, Ferns—have had in the history of the vegetable world.\r\nFerns, or more strictly speaking, the “plants of the fern tribe”\r\n(Filicineæ, or Pterideæ, also called Pteridophyta, or Vascular\r\nCryptogams), formed during an extremely long period, namely, during the\r\nwhole primary or palæolithic period, the principal portion of the\r\nvegetable world, so that we may without hesitation call it the _era of\r\nFern Forests_. From the beginning of the Devonian period, in which\r\norganisms living on land appeared for the first time, namely, during the\r\ndeposits of the Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian strata, plants like\r\nFerns predominated so much over all others, that we are justified in\r\ngiving this name to that period. In the stratifications just mentioned,\r\nbut above all, in the immense layers of coal of the Carboniferous or\r\ncoal period, we find such numerous and occasionally well preserved\r\nremains of Ferns, that we can form a tolerable vivid picture of the very\r\npeculiar land flora of the palæolithic period. In the year 1855 the\r\ntotal number of the then known palæolithic species of plants amounted to\r\nabout a thousand, and among these there were no less than 872 Ferns.\r\nAmong the remaining 128 species were 77 Gymnosperms (pines and\r\npalm-ferns), 40 Thallus plants (mostly Algæ), and about 20 not\r\naccurately definable Cormophyta (stem-plants).\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, Ferns probably developed out of the lower\r\nliverworts in the beginning of the primary period. In their\r\norganization Ferns rise considerably above Mosses, and in their more\r\nhighly developed forms even approach the flowering plants. In Mosses, as\r\nin Thallus plants, the entire body is composed of almost equi-formal\r\ncells, little if at all differentiated; but in the tissues of Ferns we\r\nfind those peculiarly differentiated strings of cells which are called\r\nthe vessels of plants, and which are universally met with in flowering\r\nplants. Hence Ferns are sometimes united as “vascular Cryptogams” with\r\nPhanerogams, and the group so formed is contrasted as that of the\r\n“vascular plants” with “cellular plants,”—that is, with “cellular\r\ncryptogams” (Mosses and Thallus plants). This very important process in\r\nthe organization of plants—the formation of vessels—first occurred,\r\ntherefore, in the Devonian period, consequently in the beginning of the\r\nsecond and smaller half of the organic history of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe branch of Ferns, or Filicinæ, is divided into five distinct classes:\r\n(1) Frondose Ferns, or Pteridæ; (2) Reed Ferns, or Calamariæ; (3)\r\nAquatic Ferns, or Rhizocarpeæ; (4) Snakes Tongues, or Ophioglossæ; and\r\n(5) Scale Ferns, or Lepidophyta. By far the most important of these five\r\nclasses, and also the richest in forms, were first the Frondose Ferns,\r\nand then the Scale-ferns, which formed the principal portion of the\r\npalæolithic forests. The Reed Ferns, on the other hand, had at that time\r\nalready somewhat diminished in number; and of the Aquatic Ferns, we do\r\nnot even know with certainty whether they then existed. It is difficult\r\nfor us to form any idea of the very peculiar character of those gloomy\r\npalæolithic fern forests, in which the whole of the gay abundance of\r\nflowers of our present flora was entirely wanting, and which were not\r\nenlivened by any birds. Of the flowering plants there then existed only\r\nthe two lowest classes, the pines and palm ferns, with naked seeds,\r\nwhose simple and insignificant blossoms scarcely deserve the name of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThe phylogeny of Ferns, and of the Gymnosperms which have developed out\r\nof them, has been made especially clear by the excellent investigations\r\nwhich Edward Strasburger published in 1872, on “The Coniferæ and\r\nGnetaceæ,” as also “On Azolla.” This thoughtful naturalist and Charles\r\nMartins, of Montpellier, are among the few botanists who have thoroughly\r\nunderstood the fundamental value of the Theory of Descent, and the\r\nmechanical-causal connection between ontogeny and phylogeny. The\r\nmajority of botanists do not even yet know the important difference\r\nbetween homology and analogy, between the morphological and\r\nphysiological comparison of parts—which has long since been recognized\r\nin zoology—but Strasburger has employed this distinction and the\r\nprinciple of evolution in his “Comparative Anatomy of the Gymnosperms,”\r\nin order to sketch the outlines of the blood relationship of this\r\nimportant group of plants.\r\n\r\nThe class among Ferns which has developed most directly out of the\r\nLiverworts is the class of real Ferns, in the narrow sense of the word,\r\nthe _Frondose Ferns_ (Filices, or Phyllopterides, also called Pteridæ).\r\nIn the present flora of the temperate zones this class forms only a\r\nsubordinate part, for it is in most cases represented only by low forms\r\nwithout trunks. But in the torrid zones, especially in the moist,\r\nsteaming forests of tropical regions, this class presents us with the\r\nlofty palm-like _fern trees_. These beautiful tree-ferns of the present\r\nday, which form the chief ornament of our hot-houses, can however give\r\nus but a faint idea of the stately and splendid frondose ferns of the\r\nprimary period, whose mighty trunks, densely crowded together, then\r\nformed entire forests. These trunks, accumulated in super-incumbent\r\nmasses, are found in the coal seams of the Carboniferous period, and\r\nbetween them, in an excellent state of preservation, are found the\r\nimpressions of the elegant fan-shaped leaves, crowning the top of the\r\ntrunk in an umbrella-like bush. The varied outlines and the\r\nfeather-like forms of these fronds, the elegant shape of the branching\r\nveins or bunches of vessels in their tender foliage, can still be as\r\ndistinctly recognized in the impressions of the palæolithic fronds as in\r\nthe fronds of ferns of the present day. In many cases even the clusters\r\nof fruit, which are distributed on the lower surface of the fronds, are\r\ndistinctly preserved. After the Carboniferous period, the predominance\r\nof frondose ferns diminished, and towards the end of the secondary\r\nperiod they played almost as subordinate a part as they do at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe Calamariæ, Ophioglossæ, and Rhizocarpeæ seem to have developed as\r\nthree diverging branches out of the Frondose Ferns, or Pteridæ. The\r\nCalamariæ, or Calamophyta, have remained at the lowest level among these\r\nthree classes. The Calamariæ comprise three different orders, of which\r\nonly one now exists, namely, the Horse-tails (Equisetaceæ). The two\r\nother orders, the Giant Reeds (Calamiteæ), and the Star-leaf Reeds\r\n(Asterophylliteæ), are long since extinct. All Calamariæ are\r\ncharacterized by a hollow and jointed stalk, stem, or trunk, upon which\r\nthe branches and leaves (in cases where they exist) are set so as to\r\nencircle the jointed stem in whorls. The hollow joints of the stalk are\r\nseparated from one another by partition walls. In Horse-tails and\r\nCalamiteæ the surface is traversed by longitudinal ribs running\r\nparallel, as in the case of a fluted column, and the outer skin contains\r\nso much silicious earth in the living forms, that it is used for\r\ncleansing and polishing. In the Asterophylliteæ, the star-shaped whorls\r\nof leaves were more strongly developed than in the two other orders.\r\nThere exist, at present, of the Calamariæ only the insignificant\r\nHorse-tails (Equisetum), which grow in marshes and on moors; but during\r\nthe whole of the primary and secondary periods they were represented by\r\ngreat trees of the genus Equisetites. There existed, at the same time,\r\nthe closely related order of the Giant Reeds (Calamites), whose strong\r\ntrunks grew to a height of about fifty feet. The order of the\r\nAsterophyllites, on the other hand, contained smaller and prettier\r\nplants, of a very peculiar form, and belongs exclusively to the primary\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAmong all Ferns, the history of the third class, that of the _Root_, or\r\n_Aquatic Ferns_ (Rhizocarpeæ, or Hydropteridæ), is least known to us. In\r\ntheir structure these ferns, which live in fresh water, are on the one\r\nhand allied to the frond ferns, and on the other to the scaly ferns, but\r\nthey are more closely related to the latter. Among them are the but\r\nlittle known moss ferns (Salvinia), clover ferns (Marsilea), and pill\r\nferns (Pilularia) of our fresh waters; further, the large Azolla which\r\nfloats in tropical ponds. Most of the aquatic ferns are of a delicate\r\nnature, and hence ill-suited for being petrified. This is probably the\r\nreason of their fossil remains being so scarce, and of the oldest of\r\nthose known to us having been found in the Jura system. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that the class is much older, and that it was already\r\ndeveloped during the palæolithic period out of other ferns by adaptation\r\nto an aquatic life.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class of ferns is formed by the _Tongue Ferns_ (Ophioglossæ,\r\nor Glossopterides). These ferns, to which belongs the Botrychium, as\r\nwell as the Ophioglossum (adder’s-tongue) of our native genera, were\r\nformerly considered as forming but a small sub-division of the frondose\r\nferns. But they deserve to form a special class, because they represent\r\nimportant transitional forms from the Pterideæ and Lepidophytes towards\r\nhigher plants, and must be regarded as among the direct progenitors of\r\nthe flowering plants.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last class is formed by the _Scale Ferns_ (Lepidophytes,\r\nor Selagines). In the same way as the Ophioglossæ arose out of the\r\nfrondose forms, the scale ferns arose out of the Ophioglossæ. They were\r\nmore highly developed than all other ferns, and form the transition to\r\nflowering plants, which must have developed out of them. Next to the\r\nfrondose ferns they took the largest part in the composition of the\r\npalæolithic fern forests. This class also contains, as does the class of\r\nreed ferns, three nearly related but still very different orders, of\r\nwhich only one now exists, the two others having become extinct towards\r\nthe end of the Carboniferous period. The scaled ferns still existing\r\nbelong to the order of the club-mosses (Lycopodiaceæ). They are mostly\r\nsmall, pretty moss-like plants, whose tender, many-branched stalk creeps\r\nin curves on the ground like a snake, and is densely encompassed and\r\ncovered by small scaly leaves. The pretty creeping Lycopodium of our\r\nwoods, which mountain tourists twine round their hats, is known to all,\r\nas also the still more delicate Selaginella, which under the name of\r\ncreeping moss is used to adorn the soil of our hot-houses in the form of\r\na thick carpet. The largest _club-mosses_ of the present day are found\r\nin the Sunda Islands, where their stalks rise to the height of\r\ntwenty-five feet, and attain half a foot in thickness. But in the\r\nprimary and secondary periods even larger trees of this kind were widely\r\ndistributed, the most ancient of which probably were the progenitors of\r\nthe pines (Lycopodites). The most important dimensions were, however,\r\nattained by the class of scale trees (Lepidodendreæ), and by the seal\r\ntrees (Sigillarieæ). These two orders, with a few species, appear in the\r\nDevonian period, but do not attain their immense and astonishing\r\ndevelopment until the Carboniferous period, and become extinct towards\r\nthe end of it, or in the Permian period directly following upon it. The\r\nscale trees, or Lepidodendreæ, were probably more closely related to\r\nclub-mosses than to Sigillarieæ. They grew into splendid, straight,\r\nunbranching trunks which divided at the top into numerous forked\r\nbranches. They bore a large crown of scaly leaves, and like the trunk\r\nwere marked in elegant spiral lines by the scars left at the base of the\r\nleaf stalks which had fallen off. We know of scale-marked trees from\r\nforty to sixty feet in length, and from twelve to fifteen feet in\r\ndiameter at the root. Some trunks are said to be even more than a\r\nhundred feet in length. In the coal are found still larger accumulations\r\nof the no less highly developed but more slender trunks of the\r\nremarkable seal trees, Sigillarieæ, which in many places form the\r\nprincipal part of coal seams. Their roots were formerly described as\r\nquite a distinct vegetable form (under the name of Stigmaria). The\r\nSigillarieæ are in many respects very like the scale-trees, but differ\r\nfrom them and from ferns in general in many ways. They were possibly\r\nclosely related to the extinct Devonian _Lycopterideæ_, combining\r\ncharacteristic peculiarities of the club-mosses and the frondose ferns,\r\nwhich Strasburger considers as the hypothetical primary form of\r\nflowering plants.\r\n\r\nIn leaving the dense forests of the primary period, which were\r\nprincipally composed of frond ferns (Lepidodendreæ and Sigillarieæ), we\r\npass onwards to the no less characteristic pine forests of the secondary\r\nperiod. Thus we leave the domain of the Cryptogamia, the plants forming\r\nneither flowers nor seeds, and enter the second main division of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, namely, the sub-kingdom of the _Phanerogamia_,\r\n_flowering plants_ forming seeds. This division, so rich in forms,\r\ncontaining the principal portion of the present vegetable world, and\r\nespecially the majority of plants living on land, is certainly of a much\r\nmore recent date than the division of Cryptogamia. For it can have\r\ndeveloped out of the latter only in the course of the palæolithic\r\nperiod. We can with full assurance maintain that, during the whole\r\narchilithic period, hence during the first and longer half of the\r\norganic history of the earth, no flowering plants as yet existed, and\r\nthat they first developed during the primary period out of Cryptogamia\r\nof the fern kind. The anatomical and embryological relation of\r\nPhanerogamia to the latter is so close, that from it we can with\r\ncertainty infer their genealogical connection, that is, their true blood\r\nrelationship. Flowering plants cannot have directly arisen out of\r\nthallus plants, nor out of mosses; but only out of ferns, or Filicines.\r\nMost probably the scaled ferns, or Lepidophyta, and more especially\r\namongst these the Lycopodiaceæ, forms closely related to the\r\nSelaginella of the present day, have been the direct progenitors of the\r\nPhanerogamia.\r\n\r\nOn account of its anatomical structure and its embryological\r\ndevelopment, the sub-kingdom of the Phanerogamia has for a long time\r\nbeen divided into two large branches, into the _Gymnosperms_, or plants\r\nwith naked seeds, and the _Angiosperms_, or plants with enclosed seeds.\r\nThe latter are in every respect more perfect and more highly organized\r\nthan the former, and developed out of them only at a late date during\r\nthe secondary period. The Gymnosperms, both anatomically and\r\nembryologically, form the transition group from Ferns to Angiosperms.\r\n\r\nThe lower, more imperfect, and the older of the two main classes of\r\nflowering plants, that of the _Archispermeæ_, or _Gymnosperms_ (with\r\nnaked seeds), attained its most varied development and widest\r\ndistribution during the mesolithic or secondary epoch. It was no less\r\ncharacteristic of this period, than was the fern group of the preceding\r\nprimary, and the Angiosperms of the succeeding tertiary, epoch. Hence we\r\nmight call the secondary epoch that of Gymnosperms, or after its most\r\nimportant representatives, the era of Pine Forests. The Gymnosperms are\r\ndivided into three classes: the Coniferæ, Cycadeæ, and Gnetaceæ. We find\r\nfossil remains of the pines, or Conifers, and of the Cycads, even in\r\ncoal, and must infer from this that the transition from scaled ferns to\r\nGymnosperms took place during the Coal, or possibly even in the Devonian\r\nperiod. However, the Gymnosperms play but a very subordinate part during\r\nthe whole of the primary epoch, and do not predominate over Ferns until\r\nthe beginning of the secondary epoch.\r\n\r\nOf the two classes of Gymnosperms just mentioned, that of the _Palm\r\nFerns_ (Zamiæ, or Cycadeæ) stands at the lowest stage, and is directly\r\nallied to ferns, as the name implies, so that some botanists have\r\nactually included them in the fern group. In their external form they\r\nresemble palms, as well as tree ferns (or tree-like frond ferns), and\r\nare adorned by a crown of feathery leaves, which is placed either on a\r\nthick, short trunk, or on a slender, simple trunk like a pillar. At the\r\npresent day this class, once so rich in forms, is but scantily\r\nrepresented by a few forms living in the torrid zones, namely, by the\r\nconiferous ferns (Zamia), the thick-trunked bread-tree (Encephalartos),\r\nand the slender-trunked Caffir bread-tree (Cycas). They may frequently\r\nbe seen in hot-houses, and are generally mistaken for palms. A much\r\ngreater variety of forms than occurs among the still existing palm ferns\r\n(Cycadeæ) is presented by the extinct and fossil Cycads, which occurred\r\nin great numbers more towards the middle of the secondary period, during\r\nthe Jura, and which at that time principally determined the character of\r\nthe forests.\r\n\r\nThe class of _Pines_, or _coniferous trees_ (Coniferæ), has preserved\r\ndown to our day a greater variety of forms than have the palm ferns.\r\nEven at the present time the trees belonging to it—cypresses, juniper\r\ntrees, and trees of life (Thuja), the box and ginko trees (Salisburya),\r\nthe araucaria and cedars, but above all the genus Pinus, which is so\r\nrich in forms, with its numerous and important species, spruces, pines,\r\nfirs, larches, etc.—still play a very important part in the most\r\ndifferent parts of the earth, and almost of themselves constitute\r\nextensive forests. Yet this development of pines seems but weak in\r\ncomparison with the predominance which the class had attained over other\r\nplants during the early secondary period, that of the Trias. At that\r\ntime mighty coniferous trees—with but proportionately few genera and\r\nspecies, but standing together in immense masses of individuals—formed\r\nthe principal part of the mesolithic forests. This fact justifies us in\r\ncalling the secondary period the “era of the pine forests,” although the\r\nremains of Cycadeæ predominate over those of coniferous trees in the\r\nJura period.[2]\r\n\r\nFrom the pine forests of the mesolithic, or secondary period, we pass on\r\ninto the leafy forests of the cænolithic, or tertiary period, and we\r\narrive thus at the consideration of the sixth and last class of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, that of the _Metaspermæ_, _Angiospermæ_, or _plants\r\nwith enclosed seeds_. The first certain and undoubted fossils of plants\r\nwith enclosed seeds are found in the strata of the chalk system, and\r\nindeed we here find, side by side, remains of the two classes into which\r\nthe main class of Angiosperms is generally divided, namely, the _one\r\nseed-lobed plants_, or _monocotylæ_, and the _two seed-lobed plants_, or\r\n_dicotylæ_. However, the whole group probably originated at an earlier\r\nperiod during the Trias. For we know of a number of doubtful and not\r\naccurately definable fossil remains of plants from the Oolitic and Trias\r\n(sic) periods, which some botanists consider to be Monocotylæ, whilst\r\nothers consider them as Gymnosperms. In regard to the two classes of\r\nplants with enclosed seeds, the Monocotylæ and Dicotylæ, it is\r\nexceedingly probable that the Dicotyledons developed out of the\r\nGnetaceæ, but that the Monocotyledons developed later out of a branch of\r\nthe dicotyledons.\r\n\r\nThe class of _one seed-lobed plants_ (Monocotylæ, or Monocotyledons,\r\nalso called Endogenæ) comprises those flowering plants whose seeds\r\npossess but one germ leaf or seed lobe (cotyledon). Each whorl of its\r\nflower contains in most cases _three_ leaves, and it is very probable\r\nthat the mother plants of all Monocotyledons possessed a regular triple\r\nblossom. The leaves are mostly simple, and traversed by simple, straight\r\nbunches of vessels or “nerves.” To this class belong the extensive\r\nfamilies of the rushes, grasses, lilies, irids, and orchids, further a\r\nnumber of indigenous aquatic plants, the water-onions, sea grasses,\r\netc., and finally the splendid and highly developed families of the\r\nAroideæ and Pandaneæ, the bananas and palms. On the whole, the class of\r\nMonocotyledons—in spite of the great variety of forms which it\r\ndeveloped, both in the tertiary and the present period—is much more\r\nsimply organized than the class of the Dicotyledons, and its history of\r\ndevelopment also offers much less of interest. As their fossil remains\r\nare for the most part difficult to recognize, it still remains at\r\npresent an open question in which of the three great secondary\r\nperiods—the Trias, Jura, or chalk period—the Monocotyledons originated.\r\nAt all events they existed in the chalk period as surely as did the\r\nDicotyledons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Haeckel History of Creation._\r\n\r\n  _PL.

The flowering plants of this class generally possess, as their\r\nname indicates, two seed lobes or germ leaves (cotyledons). The number\r\nof leaves composing its blossom is generally not three, as in most\r\nMonocotyledons, but four, five, or a multiple of those numbers. Their\r\nleaves, moreover, are generally more highly differentiated and more\r\ncomposite than those of the Monocotyledons; they are traversed by\r\ncrooked, branching bunches of vessels or “veins.” To this class belong\r\nmost of the leafed trees, and as they predominate in the tertiary period\r\nas well as, at present, over the Gymnosperms and Ferns, we may call the\r\ncænolithic period that of leafed forests.\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of Dicotyledons belong to the most highly\r\ndeveloped and most perfect plants, still the lowest division of them is\r\ndirectly allied to the Gymnosperms, and particularly to the Gnetaceæ. In\r\nthe lower Dicotyledons, as in the case of the Monocotyledons, calyx and\r\ncorolla are as yet not differentiated. Hence they are called _Apetalous_\r\n(Monochlamydeæ, or Apetalæ). This sub-class must therefore doubtless be\r\nlooked upon as the original group of the Angiosperms, and existed\r\nprobably even during the Trias and Jura periods. Among them are most of\r\nthe leafed trees bearing catkins—birches and alders, willows and\r\npoplars, beeches and oaks; further, the plants of the nettle\r\nkind—nettles, hemp, and hops, figs, mulberries, and elms; finally,\r\nplants like the spurges, laurels, and amaranth.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the chalk period that the second and more perfect class\r\nof the Dicotyledons appeared, namely, the _group with corollas_\r\n(Dichlamydeæ, or Corollifloræ). These arose out of the Apetalæ from the\r\nsimple cover of the blossoms of the latter becoming differentiated into\r\ncalyx and corolla. The sub-class of the Corollifloræ is again divided\r\ninto two large main divisions or legions, each of which contains a large\r\nnumber of different orders, families, genera, and species. The first\r\nlegion bears the name of star-flowers, or Diapetalæ, the second that of\r\nthe bell-flowers, or Gamopetalæ.\r\n\r\nThe lower and less perfect of the two legions of the Corollifloræ are\r\nthe star-flowers (also called Diapetalæ or Dialypetalæ). To them belong\r\nthe extensive families of the Umbelliferæ, or umbrella-worts (wild\r\ncarrot, etc.), the Cruciferæ, or cruciform blossoms (cabbage, etc.);\r\nfurther, the Ranunculaceæ (buttercups) and Crassulaceæ, the Mallows and\r\nGeraniums, and, besides many others, the large group of Roses (which\r\ncomprise, besides roses, most of our fruit trees), and the Pea-blossoms\r\n(containing, among others, beans, clover, genista, acacia, and mimosa).\r\nIn all these Diapetalæ the blossom-leaves remain separate, and never\r\ngrow together, as is the case in the Gamopetalæ. These latter developed\r\nfirst in the tertiary period out of the Diapetalæ, whereas the Diapetalæ\r\nappeared in the chalk period together with the Apetalæ.\r\n\r\nThe highest and most perfect group of the vegetable kingdom is formed by\r\nthe second division of the Corollifloræ, namely, the legion of\r\nbell-flowers (Gamopetalæ, also called Monopetalæ or Sympetalæ). In this\r\ngroup the blossom-leaves, which in other plants generally remain\r\nseparate, grow regularly together into a more or less bell-like,\r\nfunnel-shaped, or tubular flower. To them belong, among others, the\r\nBell-flowers and Convolvulus, Primroses and Heaths, Gentian and\r\nHoneysuckle, further the family of the Olives (olive trees, privet,\r\nelder, and ash), and finally, besides many other families, the\r\nextensive division of the Lip-blossoms (Labiatæ) and the Composites. In\r\nthese last the differentiation and perfection of the Phanerogamic\r\nblossoms attain their highest stage of development, and we must\r\ntherefore place them at the head of the vegetable kingdom, as the most\r\nperfect of all plants. In accordance with this, the legion of the\r\nGamopetalæ appear in the organic history of the earth later than all the\r\nmain groups of the vegetable kingdom—in fact, not until the cænolithic\r\nor tertiary epoch. In the earliest tertiary period the legion is still\r\nvery rare, but it gradually increases in the mid-tertiary, and attains\r\nits full development only in the latest tertiary and the quaternary\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNow if, having reached our own time, we look back upon the _whole\r\nhistory of the development of the vegetable kingdom_, we cannot but\r\nperceive in it a _grand confirmation of the Theory of Descent_. The two\r\ngreat principles of organic development which have been pointed out as\r\nthe necessary results of natural selection in the Struggle for Life,\r\nnamely, the laws of _differentiation_ and _perfecting_, manifest\r\nthemselves everywhere in the development of the larger and smaller\r\ngroups of the natural system of plants. In each larger or smaller period\r\nof the organic history of the earth, the vegetable kingdom increases\r\nboth in _variety_ and _perfection_, as a glance at Plate IV. will\r\nclearly show. During the whole of the long primordial period there\r\nexisted only the lowest and most imperfect group, that of the Algæ. To\r\nthese are added, in the primary period, the higher and more perfect\r\nCryptogamia, especially the main-class of Ferns. During the coal period\r\nthe Phanerogamia begin to develop out of the latter; at first, however,\r\nthey are represented only by the lower main-class, that of Gymnosperms.\r\nIt was not until the secondary period that the higher main-class, that\r\nof Angiosperms, arose out of them. Of these also there existed at first\r\nonly the lower groups without distinct corollas, the Monocotyledons and\r\nthe Apetalæ. It was not until the chalk period that the higher\r\nCorollifloræ developed out of the latter. But even this most highly\r\ndeveloped group is represented, in the chalk period, only by the lower\r\nstage of Star-flowers, or Diapetalæ, and only at quite a late date, in\r\nthe tertiary period, did the more highly developed Bell-blossoms,\r\nGamopetalæ, arise out of them, which at the same time are the most\r\nperfect of all flowering plants. Thus, in each succeeding later division\r\nof the organic history of the earth the vegetable kingdom gradually rose\r\nto a higher degree of perfection and variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nPEDIGREE AND HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nI. ANIMAL-PLANTS AND WORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Natural System of the Animal Kingdom.—Linnæus and Lamarck’s\r\n  Systems.—The Four Types of Bär and Cuvier.—Their Increase to\r\n  Seven Types.—Genealogical Importance of the Seven Types as\r\n  Independent Tribes of the Animal Kingdom.—Derivation of\r\n  Zoophytes and Worms from Primæval Animals.—Monophyletic and\r\n  Polyphyletic Hypothesis of the Descent of the Animal\r\n  Kingdom.—Common Origin of the Four Higher Animal Tribes out of\r\n  the Worm Tribe.—Division of the Seven Animal Tribes into\r\n  Sixteen Main Classes, and Thirty-eight Classes.—Primæval\r\n  Animals (Monera, Amœbæ, Synamœbæ), Gregarines, Infusoria,\r\n  Planæades, and Gastræades (Planula and Gastrula).—Tribe of\r\n  Zoophytes.—Spongiæ (Mucous Sponges, Fibrous Sponges, Calcareous\r\n  Sponges).—Sea Nettles, or Acalephæ (Corals, Hood-jellies,\r\n  Comb-jellies).—Tribe of Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural system of organisms which we must employ in the animal as\r\nwell as in the vegetable kingdom, as a guide in our genealogical\r\ninvestigations, is in both cases of but recent origin, and essentially\r\ndetermined by the progress of comparative anatomy and ontogeny (the\r\nhistory of individual development) during the present century. Almost\r\nall the attempts at classification made in the last century followed the\r\npath of the artificial system, which was first established in a\r\nconsistent manner by Charles Linnæus. The artificial system differs\r\nessentially from the natural one, in the fact that it does not make the\r\nwhole organization and the internal structure (depending upon the blood\r\nrelationship) the basis of classification, but only employs individual,\r\nand for the most part external, characteristics, which readily strike\r\nthe eye. Thus Linnæus distinguished his twenty-four classes of the\r\nvegetable kingdom principally by the number, formation, and combination\r\nof the stamens. In like manner he distinguished six classes in the\r\nanimal kingdom principally by the nature of the heart and blood. These\r\nsix classes were: (1) Mammals; (2) Birds; (3) Amphibious Animals; (4)\r\nFishes; (5) Insects; and (6) Worms.\r\n\r\nBut these six animal classes of Linnæus are by no means of equal value,\r\nand it was an important advance when, at the end of the last century,\r\nLamarck comprised the first four classes as vertebrate animals\r\n(Vertebrata), and put them in contrast with the remaining animals (the\r\ninsects and worms of Linnæus), of which he made a second main\r\ndivision—the invertebrate animals (Invertebrata). In reality Lamarck\r\nthus agreed with Aristotle, the father of Natural History, who had\r\ndistinguished these two main groups, and called the former\r\n_blood-bearing animals_, the latter _bloodless animals_.\r\n\r\nThe next important progress towards a natural system of the animal\r\nkingdom was made some decades later by two most illustrious zoologists,\r\nCarl Ernst Bär and George Cuvier. As has already been remarked, they\r\nestablished, almost simultaneously and independently of one another, the\r\nproposition that it was necessary to distinguish several completely\r\ndistinct main groups in the animal kingdom, each of which possessed an\r\nentirely peculiar type or structure (compare above, vol. i. p. 53). In\r\neach of these main divisions there is a tree-shaped and branching\r\ngradation from most simple and imperfect forms to those which are\r\nexceedingly composite and highly developed. The _degree of development_\r\nwithin each type is quite independent of the peculiar _plan of\r\nstructure_, which forms the basis of the type and gives it a special\r\ncharacteristic. The “type” is determined by the peculiar relations in\r\nposition of the most important parts of the body, and the manner in\r\nwhich the organs are connected. The degree of development, however, is\r\ndependent upon the greater or less division of labour among organs, and\r\non the differentiation of the plastids and organs. This extremely\r\nimportant and fruitful idea was established by Bär, who relied more\r\ndistinctly and thoroughly upon the history of individual development\r\nthan did Cuvier. Cuvier based his argument upon the results of\r\ncomparative anatomy. But neither of them recognized the true cause of\r\nthe remarkable relationships pointed out by them, which is first\r\nrevealed to us by the Theory of Descent. It shows us that the common\r\n_type_ or plan of structure is determined by _inheritance_, and the\r\ndegree of development or differentiation by _adaptation_. (Gen. Morph.\r\nii. 10).\r\n\r\nBoth Bär and Cuvier distinguished four different types in the animal\r\nkingdom, and divided it accordingly into four great main divisions\r\n(branches or circles). The first of these is formed by the vertebrate\r\nanimals (Vertebrata), and comprises Linnæus’ first four classes—mammals,\r\nbirds, amphibious animals, and fishes. The second type is formed by the\r\narticulated animals (Articulata), containing Linnæus’ insects,\r\nconsequently the six-legged insects, and also the myriopods, spiders,\r\nand crustacea, but besides these, a large number of the worms,\r\nespecially the ringed worms. The third main division comprises the\r\nmolluscous animals (Mollusca)—slugs, snails, mussels, and some kindred\r\ngroups. Finally, the fourth and last circle of the animal kingdom\r\ncomprises the various radiated animals (Radiata), which at first sight\r\ndiffer from the three preceding types by their radiated, flower-like\r\nform of body. For while the bodies of molluscs, articulated animals, and\r\nvertebrated animals consist of two symmetrical lateral halves—of two\r\ncounterparts or antimera, of which the one is the mirror of the\r\nother—the bodies of the so-called radiated animals are composed of more\r\nthan two, generally of four, five, or six counterparts grouped round a\r\ncommon central axis, as in the case of a flower. However striking this\r\ndifference may seem at first, it is, in reality, a very subordinate one,\r\nand the radial form has by no means the same importance in all “radiated\r\nanimals.”\r\n\r\nThe establishment of these natural main groups or types of the animal\r\nkingdom by Bär and Cuvier was the greatest advance in the classification\r\nof animals since the time of Linnæus. The three groups of vertebrated\r\nanimals, articulated animals, and molluscs are so much in accordance\r\nwith nature that they are retained, even at the present day, little\r\naltered in extent. But a more accurate knowledge soon showed the utterly\r\nunnatural character of the group of the radiated animals. Leuckart, in\r\n1848, first pointed out that two perfectly distinct types were\r\nconfounded under the name, namely, the _Star-fishes_ (Echinoderma)—the\r\nsea-stars, lily encrinites, sea-urchins, and sea-cucumbers; and, on the\r\nother hand, the _Animal-plants_, or _Zoophytes_ (Cœlenterata or\r\nZoophyta)—the sponges, corals, hood-jellies, and comb-jellies. At the\r\nsame time, Siebold united the Infusoria with the Rhizopoda, under the\r\nname of Protozoa (lowest animals), into a special main division of the\r\nanimal kingdom. By this the number of animal types was increased to six.\r\nIt was finally increased to seven by the fact that modern zoologists\r\nseparated the main division of the articulated animals into two groups:\r\n(_a_) those possessing _articulated feet_ (Arthropoda), corresponding to\r\nLinnæus’ Insects, namely, the Flies (with six legs), Myriopods, Spiders,\r\nand Crustacea; and (_b_) the footless _Worms_ (Vermes), or those\r\npossessing non-articulated feet. These latter comprise only the real or\r\ngenuine Worms (ring-worms, round worms, planarian worms, etc.), and\r\ntherefore in no way correspond with the Worms of Linnæus, who had\r\nincluded the molluscs, the radiates, and many other lower animals under\r\nthis name.\r\n\r\nThus, according to the views of modern zoologists, which are given in\r\nall recent manuals and treatises on zoology, the animal kingdom is\r\ncomposed of seven completely distinct main divisions or types, each of\r\nwhich is distinguished by a characteristic plan of structure peculiar to\r\nit, and perfectly distinct from every one of the others. In the natural\r\nsystem of the animal kingdom—which I shall now proceed to explain as its\r\nprobable pedigree—I shall on the whole agree with this usual division,\r\nbut not without some modifications, which I consider very important in\r\nconnection with genealogy, and which are rendered absolutely necessary\r\nin consequence of our view as to the history of the development of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWe evidently obtain the greatest amount of information concerning the\r\n_pedigree of the animal kingdom_ (as well as concerning that of the\r\nvegetable kingdom) from comparative anatomy and ontogeny. Besides\r\nthese, palæontology also throws much valuable light upon the historical\r\nsuccession of many of the groups. From numerous facts in comparative\r\nanatomy, we may, in the first place, infer the _common origin of all\r\nthose animals which belong to one of the seven “types.”_ For in spite of\r\nall the variety in the external form developed within each of these\r\ntypes, the essential relative position of the parts of the body which\r\ndetermines the type, is so constant, and agrees so completely in all the\r\nmembers of every type, that on account of their relations of form alone\r\nwe are obliged to unite them, in the natural system, into a single main\r\ngroup. But we must certainly conclude, moreover, that this conjunction\r\nalso has its expression in the pedigree of the animal kingdom. For the\r\ntrue cause of the intimate agreement in structure can only be the actual\r\nblood relationship. Hence we may, without further discussion, lay down\r\nthe important proposition that all animals belonging to one and the same\r\ncircle or type must be descended from one and the same original primary\r\nform. In other words, the idea of the circle or type, as it is employed\r\nin zoology since Bär and Cuvier’s time to designate the few principal\r\nmain groups or “sub-kingdoms” of the animal kingdoms, coincides with the\r\nidea of “tribe” or “phylum,” as employed by the Theory of Descent.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we can trace all the varieties of animal forms to these seven\r\nfundamental forms, the following question next presents itself to us as\r\na second phylogenetic problem—Where do these seven animal tribes come\r\nfrom? Are they seven original primary forms of an entirely independent\r\norigin, or are they also distantly related by blood to one another?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PL. VI._\r\n\r\nHistorical Growth of the six great stems of Animals. _See the\r\nExplanation._]\r\n\r\nAt first we might be inclined to answer this question in a\r\n_polyphyletic_ sense, by saying that we must assume, for each of the\r\nseven great animal tribes, at least one independent primary form\r\ncompletely distinct from the others. On further considering this\r\ndifficult problem, we arrive in the end at the notion of a\r\n_monophyletic_ origin of the animal kingdom, viz., that these seven\r\nprimary forms are connected at their lowest roots, and that they are\r\nderived from a single, common primæval form. _In the animal as well as\r\nin the vegetable kingdom, when closely and accurately considered, the\r\nmonophyletic hypothesis of descent is found to be more satisfactory than\r\nthe polyphyletic hypothesis._\r\n\r\nIt is _comparative ontogeny_ (embryology) which first and foremost leads\r\nto the assumption of the monophyletic origin of the whole animal kingdom\r\n(the Protista excepted of course). The zoologist who has thoughtfully\r\ncompared the history of the individual development of various animals,\r\nand has understood the importance of the biogenetic principle (p. 33),\r\ncannot but be convinced that a common root must be assumed for the seven\r\ndifferent animal tribes, and that all animals, including man, are\r\nderived from a single, common primary form. The result of the\r\nconsideration of the facts of embryology, or ontogeny, is the following\r\ngenealogical or phylogenetic hypothesis, which I have put forward and\r\nexplained in detail in my “Philosophy of Calcareous Sponges” (Monograph\r\nof the Calcareous Sponges, vol. i. pp. 464, 465, etc.,—“the Theory of\r\nthe Layers of the Embryo, and the Pedigree of Animals”).\r\n\r\nThe first stage of organic life in the Animal kingdom (as in the\r\nVegetable and Protista kingdoms) was formed by perfectly simple\r\n_Monera_, originating by spontaneous generation. The former existence\r\nof this simplest animal form is, even at present, attested by the fact\r\nthat the egg-cell of many animals loses its kernel directly after\r\nbecoming fructified, and thus relapses to the lower stage of development\r\nof a cytod without a kernel, like a Moneron. This remarkable occurrence\r\nI have interpreted, according to the law of latent inheritance (vol. i.\r\np. 205), as a phylogenetic _relapse_ of the cellular form into the\r\noriginal form of a cytod. The _Monerula_, as we may call this egg-cytod\r\nwithout a kernel, repeats then, according to the biogenetic principle\r\n(vol. ii. p. 33), the most ancient of all animal forms, the common\r\nprimary form of the animal kingdom, namely, the Moneron.\r\n\r\nThe second ontogenetic process consists in a new kernel being formed in\r\nthe Monerula, or egg-cytod, which thus returns again to the value of a\r\ntrue _egg-cell_. According to this, we must look upon the simple animal\r\ncell, containing a kernel, or the single-celled primæval animal—which\r\nmay still be seen in a living state in the _Amœbæ_ of the present day—as\r\nthe _second_ step in the series of phylogenetic forms of the animal\r\nkingdom. Like the still living simple Amœbæ, and like the naked\r\negg-cells of many lower animals (for example, of Sponges and Medusæ,\r\netc.), which cannot be distinguished from them, the remote phyletic\r\nprimary Amœbæ also were perfectly simple naked-cells, which moved about\r\nin the Laurentian primæval ocean, creeping by means of the ever-changing\r\nprocesses of their body-substance, and nourishing and propagating\r\nthemselves in the same way as the Amœbæ of the present day. (Compare\r\nvol. i. p. 188, and vol. ii. p. 54.) The existence of this Amœba-like,\r\n_single-celled primary form_ of the whole animal kingdom is unmistakably\r\nindicated by the exceedingly important fact that the egg of all\r\nanimals, from those of sponges and worms up to those of the ant and man,\r\nis a simple cell.\r\n\r\nThirdly, from the “single-cell” state arose the _simplest multicellular\r\nstate_, namely, a heap or a small community of simple, equi-formal, and\r\nequivalent cells. Even at the present day, in the ontogenetic\r\ndevelopment of every animal egg-cell, there first arises a globular heap\r\nof equi-formal naked cells, by the repeated self-division of the primary\r\ncell. (Compare vol. i. p. 190 and the Frontispiece, Fig. 3.) We called\r\nthis accumulation of cells the _mulberry state_ (Morula), because it\r\nresembles a mulberry or blackberry. This Morula-body occurs in the same\r\nsimple form in all the different tribes of animals, and on account of\r\nthis most important circumstance we may infer—according to the\r\nbiogenetic principle—that the _most ancient, many-celled, primary form\r\nof the animal kingdom_ resembled a Morula like this, and was in fact a\r\nsimple heap of Amœba-like primæval cells, one similar to the other. We\r\nshall call this most ancient community of Amœbæ—this most simple\r\naccumulation of animal cells—which is recapitulated in individual\r\ndevelopment by the Morula—the _Synamœba_.\r\n\r\nOut of the Synamœbæ, in the early Laurentian period, there afterwards\r\ndeveloped a fourth primary form of the animal kingdom, which we shall\r\ncall the ciliated germ (Planæa). This arose out of the Synamœba by the\r\nouter cells on the surface of the cellular community beginning to extend\r\nvibrating fringes called cilia, and becoming “ciliated cells,” and thus\r\ndifferentiating from the inner and unchanged cells. The Synamœbæ\r\nconsisted of completely equi-formed and naked cells, and crept about\r\nslowly, at the bottom of the Laurentian primæval ocean, by means of\r\nmovements like those of an Amœba. The Planæa, on the other hand,\r\nconsisted of two kinds of different cells—inner ones like the Amœbæ, and\r\nexternal “ciliated cells.” By the vibrating movements of the cilia the\r\nentire multicellular body acquired a more rapid and stronger motion, and\r\npassed over from the creeping to the swimming mode of locomotion. In\r\nexactly the same manner the _Morula_, in the ontogenesis of lower\r\nanimals, still changes into a ciliated form of larva, which has been\r\nknown, since the year 1847, under the name of _Planula_. This Planula is\r\nsometimes a globular, sometimes an oval body, which swims about in the\r\nwater by means of a vibrating movement; the fringed (ciliated) and\r\nsmaller cells of the surface differ from the larger inner cells, which\r\nare unfringed. (Fig. 4 of the Frontispiece.)\r\n\r\nOut of this Planula, or fringed larva, there then develops, in animals\r\nof all tribes, an exceedingly important and interesting animal form,\r\nwhich, in my Monograph of the Calcareous Sponges, I have named\r\n_Gastrula_ (that is, larva with a stomach or intestine). (Frontispiece,\r\nFig. 5, 6). This Gastrula externally resembles the Planula, but differs\r\nessentially from it in the fact that it encloses a cavity which opens to\r\nthe outside by a mouth. The cavity is the “_primary intestine_,” or\r\n“primary stomach,” the _progaster_, the first beginning of the\r\nalimentary canal; its opening is the “_primary mouth_” (prostoma). The\r\nwall of the progaster consists of two layers of cells: an outer layer of\r\nsmaller ciliated cells (outer skin, or ectoderm), and of an inner layer\r\nof larger non-ciliated cells (inner skin, or entoderm). This exceedingly\r\nimportant larval form, the “Gastrula,” makes its appearance in the\r\nontogenesis of all tribes of animals—in Sponges, Medusæ, Corals, Worms,\r\nSea-squirts, Radiated animals, Molluscs, and even in the lowest\r\nVertebrata (Amphioxus: compare p. 200, Plate XII., Fig. _B_ 4; see also\r\nin the same place the Ascidian, Fig. _A_ 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Definition of the _forms_      |   +Ontogenesis.+             |    +Phylogenesis.+\r\n  of the five first stages       | The five first stages        | The five first stages\r\n  of the development of          | of the individual            | of the phyletic or\r\n  the animal body.               | development.                 | historical development.\r\n  -------------------------------+------------------------------+------------------------\r\n                                 |                              |\r\n  _First Stage of Development._  |             1.               |          1.\r\n                                 |         +Monerula.+          |       +Moneron.+\r\n  A simple cytod (a              |                              |\r\n  plastid without a kernel.)     | Animal egg without a         | Most ancient animal\r\n             |                   | kernel (when the egg-kernel  | Monera, originating by\r\n             |                   | has disappeared,             | spontaneous generation.\r\n             |                   | after being fructified).     |          |\r\n             |                   |             |                |          |\r\n             |                   |             |                |          |\r\n  _Second Stage of Development._ |             2.               |          2.\r\n                                 |          +Ovulum.+           |       +Amœbæ.+\r\n  A simple cell (a               |                              |\r\n  plastid containing a           | Animal egg with kernel       | Animal Amœbæ.\r\n  kernel.)                       | (a simple egg-cell).         |          |\r\n              |                  |             |                |          |\r\n              |                  |             |                |          |\r\n              |                  |             |                |          |\r\n  _Third Stage of Development._  |             3.               |          3.\r\n                                 |          +Morula.+           |     +Synamœba.+\r\n  A community (an                |     (_Mulberry form._)       |\r\n  aggregation of identical       |                              | An aggregation of\r\n  simple cells).                 | Globular heap of homogeneous | Amœbæ.\r\n              |                  | “cleavage spheres.”          |          |\r\n              |                  |             |                |          |\r\n              |                  |             |                |          |\r\n  _Fourth Stage of Development._ |             4.               |          4.\r\n                                 |          +Planula.+          |       +Planæa.+\r\n  A solid or bladder-shaped,     |     (_Ciliated larva_.)      |\r\n  globular, or oval              |                              | Many-celled primæval\r\n  body, _composed of two         | Many-celled larva            | animal without\r\n  kinds of different cells_:     | without mouth, composed      | mouth, composed of\r\n  externally ciliated,           | of different cells.          | two kinds of different\r\n  internally non-ciliated        |             |                | cells.\r\n  cells.                         |             |                |          |\r\n              |                  |             |                |          |\r\n              |                  |             |                |          |\r\n  _Fifth Stage of Development._  |             5.               |          5.\r\n                                 |          +Gastrula.+         |       +Gastræa.+\r\n  A globular or oval             |     (_Larva with mouth._)    |\r\n  _body with simple intestinal   | Many-celled with intestines  | Many-celled primæval\r\n  cavity and mouth-opening.      | and mouth; intestinal        | animal with intestine\r\n  Body wall composed             | wall with two                | and mouth; intestinal\r\n  of two layers_; an             | layers.                      | wall with two\r\n  externally ciliated ectoderm   |                              | layers.

This Gastræa possessed a\r\nperfectly simple globular or oval body, which enclosed a simple cavity\r\nof like form, namely, the progaster; at one of the poles of the\r\nlongitudinal axis the primary intestine opened by a mouth which served\r\nfor the reception of nutrition. The body wall (which was also the\r\nintestinal wall) consisted of two layers of cells, the unfringed\r\nentoderm, or intestinal layer, and the fringed ectoderm, or skin-layer;\r\nby the motion of the cilia or fringes of the latter the Gastræa swam\r\nabout freely in the Laurentian ocean. Even in those higher animals, in\r\nthe ontogenesis of which the original Gastrula form has disappeared,\r\naccording to the laws of abbreviated inheritance (vol. i. p. 212), the\r\ncomposition of the Gastræa body has been transmitted to the phase of\r\ndevelopment which directly arises out of the Morula. This phase is an\r\noval or round disc consisting of two cell-layers or membranes: the outer\r\ncell-layer, the _animal or dermal layer_ (ectoblast), corresponds to the\r\nectoderm of the Gastræa; out of it develops the external, loose skin\r\n(epidermis), with its glands and appendages, as well as the central\r\nnervous system. The inner cell-layer, the _vegetative or intestinal\r\nlayer_ (hypoblast), is originally the entoderm of the Gastræa; out of it\r\ndevelops the inner membrane (epithelium) of the intestinal canal and its\r\nglands. (Compare my Monograph of the Calcareous Sponges, vol. i. p. 466,\r\netc.)\r\n\r\nBy ontogeny we have already gained five primordial stages of development\r\nof the animal kingdom: (1) the Moneron; (2) the Amœba; (3) the Synamœba;\r\n(4) the Planæa; and (5) the Gastræa. The former existence of these five\r\noldest primary forms, which succeeded one another, and which must have\r\nlived in the Laurentian period, follows as a consequence of the\r\nbiogenetic principle; that is to say, from the parallelism and the\r\nmechanico-causal connection of ontogenesis and phylogenesis. (Compare\r\nvol. i. p. 309.) In our genealogical system of the animal kingdom we may\r\nclass all these animal forms, long since extinct, and, which on account\r\nof the soft nature of their bodies could leave no fossil remains, among\r\nthe tribe of Primæval animals (Protozoa), which also comprises the still\r\nliving Infusoria and Gregarinæ.\r\n\r\nThe phyletic development of the six higher animal tribes, which are all\r\nderived from the Gastræa, deviated at this point in two directions. In\r\nother words, the _Gastræads_ (as we may call the group of forms\r\ncharacterized by the Gastræa-type of structure), divided into two\r\ndivergent lines or branches; the one branch of Gastræads gave up free\r\nlocomotion, adhered to the bottom of the sea, and thus, by adopting an\r\nadhesive mode of life, gave rise to the _Protascus_, the common primary\r\nform of the _Animal-plants_ (Zoophyta). The other branch of the\r\nGastræads retained free locomotion, did not become adherent and later\r\non developed into the _Prothelmis_, the common primary form of _Worms_\r\n(Vermes). (Compare p. 133.)\r\n\r\nThis latter tribe (as limited by modern zoology) is of the greatest\r\ninterest in the study of genealogy. For among Worms, as we shall see\r\nlater, there are, besides very numerous peculiar families, and besides\r\nmany independent classes, also very remarkable forms, which may be\r\nconsidered as _forms of direct transition_ to the four higher animal\r\ntribes. Both comparative anatomy and the ontogeny of these worms enable\r\nus to recognize in them the nearest blood relations of those extinct\r\nanimal forms which were the original primary forms of the four higher\r\nanimal tribes. Hence these latter, the Molluscs, Star-fishes,\r\nArticulated animals, and Vertebrate animals, do not stand in any close\r\nblood relationship to one another, but have originated independently in\r\nfour different places out of the tribe of Worms.\r\n\r\nIn this way comparative anatomy and phylogeny lead us to the\r\n_monophyletic pedigree of the animal kingdom_, the outlines of which are\r\ngiven on p. 133. According to it the seven phyla, or tribes, of the\r\nanimal kingdom are of different value in regard to genealogy. The\r\noriginal primary group of the whole animal kingdom is formed by the\r\nPrimæval animals (Protozoa), including the Infusoria and Gastræads. Out\r\nof these latter arose the two tribes of Animal-plants (Zoophyta) and\r\nWorms as diverging branches. Out of four different groups of the Worm\r\ntribe, the four higher tribes of the animal kingdom were developed—the\r\nStar-fishes (Echinoderma) and Insects (Arthropoda) on the one hand, and\r\nthe Molluscs (Mollusca) and Vertebrated animals (Vertebrata) on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHaving thus sketched out the monophyletic pedigree of the animal kingdom\r\nin its most important features, we must now turn to a closer examination\r\nof the historical course of development which the seven tribes of the\r\nanimal kingdom, and the classes distinguished in them, have passed\r\nthrough (p. 132). There is a much larger number of classes in the animal\r\nthan in the vegetable kingdom, owing to the simple reason that the\r\nanimal body, in consequence of its more varied and perfect vital\r\nactivity, could differentiate and develop in very many more different\r\ndirections than could the vegetable body. Thus, while we were able to\r\ndivide the whole vegetable kingdom into six main classes and nineteen\r\nclasses, we have to distinguish, at least, sixteen main classes and\r\nthirty-eight classes in the animal kingdom. These are distributed among\r\nthe seven different tribes of the animal kingdom in the way shown in the\r\nSystematic Survey on pages 132 and 133.\r\n\r\nThe group of _Primæval animals_ (Protozoa) within the compass which we\r\nhere assign to this tribe, comprises the most ancient and the simplest\r\nprimary forms of the animal kingdom; for example, the five oldest\r\nphyletic stages of development previously mentioned, and besides these\r\nthe Infusoria and Gregarinæ, as well as all those imperfect animal\r\nforms, for which, on account of their simple and indifferent\r\norganization, no place can be found in any of the other six animal\r\ntribes. Most zoologists, in addition to these, include among the\r\nProtozoa a larger or smaller portion of those lowest organisms, which we\r\nmentioned in our neutral kingdom of Protista (in Chapter XVI.). But\r\nthese Protista, especially the large division of the Rhizopoda, which\r\nare so rich in forms, cannot be considered as real animals for reasons\r\npreviously given. Hence, if we here leave them out of the question, we\r\nmay accept two main classes or provinces of real Protozoa, namely, _Egg\r\nanimals_ (Ovularia) and _Germ animals_ (Blastularia). To the former\r\nbelong the three classes of Archezoa, Gregarinæ, and Infusoria, to the\r\nlatter the two classes of Planæads and Gastræads.\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 16 Main Classes and 38 Classes of the Animal Kingdom._\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------\r\n  _Tribes or Phyla_ |  _Main Classes_,      |    _Classes_         |_Systematic Name_\r\n      _of the_      |_Branches or Clades_   |     _of the_         |    _of the_\r\n  _Animal Kingdom._ |    _of the_           |  _Animal Kingdom._   |   _Classes._\r\n                    | _Animal Kingdom._     |                      |\r\n  ------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+------------------\r\n\r\n          A.        {\r\n       =Primæval=   { I.

It contains only the most simple and most ancient primary\r\nforms of the animal kingdom, whose former existence we have proved by\r\nmeans of the fundamental law of biogenesis; they are, (1) Animal Monera;\r\n(2) Animal Amœbæ; (3) Animal Synamœbæ. We may, if we choose, include\r\namong them a portion of the still living Monera and Amœbæ, but another\r\nportion (according to the discussion in Chapter XVI.) must on account of\r\ntheir neutral nature be considered as Protista, and a third portion, on\r\naccount of their vegetable nature, must be considered as plants.\r\n\r\nA second class of the egg animals consists of the _Gregarines_\r\n(Gregarinæ), which live as parasites in the intestines and body-cavities\r\nof many animals. Some of these Gregarines are perfectly simple cells\r\nlike the Amœbæ; some form chains of two or three identical cells, one\r\nlying behind the other. They differ from the naked Amœbæ by possessing\r\na thick, simple membrane, which surrounds their cell-body; they can be\r\nconsidered as animal Amœbæ which have adopted a parasitical mode of\r\nlife, and in consequence have surrounded themselves with a secreted\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\nAs a third class of egg animals, we adopt the real _Infusoria_\r\n(Infusoria), embracing those forms to which modern zoology almost\r\nuniversally limits this class of animals. The principal portion of them\r\nconsists of the small _ciliated Infusoria_ (Ciliata), which inhabit all\r\nthe fresh and salt waters of the earth in great numbers, and which swim\r\nabout by means of a delicate garb of vibratile fringes. A second and\r\nsmaller division consists of the adherent _sucking Infusoria_ (Acinetæ),\r\nwhich take their food by means of fine sucking-tubes. Although during\r\nthe last thirty years numerous and very careful investigations have been\r\nmade on these small animalcules,—which are mostly invisible to the naked\r\neye,—still we are even now not very sure about their development and\r\nform-value. We do not even yet know whether the Infusoria are single or\r\nmany-celled; but as no investigator has as yet proved their body to be a\r\ncombination of cells, we are, in the mean time, justified in considering\r\nthem as single-celled, like the Gregarines and the Amœbæ.\r\n\r\nThe second main class of primæval animals consists of the _Germ animals_\r\n(Blastularia). This name we give to those extinct Protozoa which\r\ncorrespond to the two ontogenetic embryonic forms of the six higher\r\nanimal tribes, namely, the Planula and the Gastrula. The body of these\r\nBlastularia, in a perfectly developed state, was composed of many cells,\r\nand these cells moreover differentiated—in two ways at least—into an\r\nexternal (animal or dermal) and an internal (vegetative or gastral)\r\nmass. Whether there still exist representatives of this group is\r\nuncertain. Their former existence is undoubtedly proved by the two\r\nexceedingly important ontogenetic animal forms which we have already\r\ndescribed as Planula and Gastrula, and which still occur as a transient\r\nstage of development in the ontogeny of the most different tribes of\r\nanimals. Corresponding to these, we may, according to the biogenetic\r\nprinciple, assume the former existence of two distinct classes of\r\nBlastularia, namely, the _Planæada_ and _Gastræada_. The type of the\r\n_Planæada_ is the _Planæa_—long since extinct—but whose historical\r\nportrait is still presented to us at the present day in the widely\r\ndistributed _ciliated larva_ (Planula). (Frontispiece, Fig. 4.) The type\r\nof the _Gastræada_ is the _Gastræa_, of whose original nature the\r\nmouth-and-stomach larva (Gastrula), which recurs in the most different\r\nanimal tribes, still gives a faithful representation. (Frontispiece Fig.\r\n5, 6.) Out of the Gastræa, as we have previously mentioned, there were\r\nat one time developed two different primary forms, the Protascus and\r\nProthelmis; the former must be looked upon as the primary form of the\r\nZoophytes, the latter as the primary form of Worms. (Compare the\r\nenunciation of this hypothesis in my Monograph of the Calcareous\r\nSponges, vol i. p. 464.)\r\n\r\nThe _Animal-plants_ (Zoophyta, or Cœlenterata) which constitute the\r\nsecond tribe of the animal kingdom, rise considerably above the\r\nprimitive animals in the characters of their whole organisation, while\r\nthey remain far below most of the higher animals. For in the latter\r\n(with the exception only of the lowest forms) the four distinct\r\nfunctions of nutrition—namely, digestion, circulation of the blood,\r\nrespiration, and excretion—are universally accomplished by four\r\nperfectly different systems of organs: by the intestines, the vascular\r\nsystem, the organs of respiration, and the urinary apparatus. In\r\nZoophytes, however, these functions and their organs are not yet\r\nseparate, and are all performed by a single system of alimentary canals,\r\nby the so-called gastro-vascular system, or the cœlenteric apparatus of\r\nthe intestinal cavity. The mouth, which is also the anus, leads into a\r\nstomach, into which the other cavities of the body also open. In\r\nZoophytes the body-cavity, or “cœloma,” possessed by the four higher\r\ntribes of animals is still completely wanting, likewise the vascular\r\nsystem and blood, as also the organs of respiration, etc.\r\n\r\nAll Zoophytes live in water; most of them in the sea, only a very few in\r\nfresh water, such as fresh-water sponges (Spongilla) and some primæval\r\npolyps (Hydra, Cordylophora). A specimen of the pretty flower-like forms\r\nwhich are met with in great variety among Zoophytes is given on Plate\r\nVII. (Compare its explanation in the Appendix.)\r\n\r\nThe tribe of animal-plants, or Zoophytes, is divided into two distinct\r\nprovinces, the _Sponges_, or _Spongiæ_, and the _Sea-nettles_, or\r\n_Acalephæ_ (p. 144). The latter are much richer in forms and more highly\r\norganized than the former. In all Sponges the entire body, as well as\r\nthe individual organs, are differentiated and perfected to a much less\r\nextent than in Sea-nettles. All Sponges lack the characteristic\r\n_nettle-organs_ which all Sea-nettles possess.\r\n\r\nThe common primary form of all Zoophytes must be looked for in the\r\n_Protascus_, an animal form long since extinct, but whose existence is\r\nproved according to the biogenetic principle by the Ascula. This Ascula\r\nis an ontogenetical development form which, in Sponges as well as in\r\nSea-nettles, proceeds from the Gastrula. (Compare the Ascula of the\r\ncalcareous sponge on the Frontispiece, Fig. 7, 8.) For after the\r\nGastrula of zoophytes has for a time swum about in the water it sinks to\r\nthe bottom, and there adheres by that pole of its axis which is opposite\r\nto the opening of the mouth. The external cells of the ectoderm draw in\r\ntheir vibrating, ciliary hairs, whereas, on the contrary, the inner\r\ncells of the entoderm begin to form them. Thus the Ascula, as we call\r\nthis changed form of larva, is a simple sack, its cavity (the cavity of\r\nthe stomach or intestine) opening by a mouth externally, at the upper\r\npole of the longitudinal axis (opposite the basal point of fixture). The\r\nentire body is here in a certain sense a mere stomach or intestinal\r\ncanal, as in the case of the Gastrula. The wall of the sack, which is\r\nboth body wall and intestinal wall, consists of two layers or coats of\r\ncells, a fringed _entoderm_, or gastral layer (corresponding with the\r\ninner or vegetative germ-layer of the higher animals), and an unfringed\r\nexoderm or dermal layer (corresponding with the external or animal\r\ngerm-layer of the higher animals). The original _Protascus_, a true\r\nlikeness of which is still furnished by the Ascula, probably formed\r\negg-cells and sperm-cells out of its gastral layer.\r\n\r\nThe Protascads—as we will call the most ancient group of vegetable\r\nanimals, represented by the Protascus-type—divided into two lines or\r\nbranches, the Spongiæ and the Sea-nettles, or Acalephæ. I have shown in\r\nmy Monograph of the Calcareous Sponges (vol. i. p. 485) how closely\r\nthese two main classes of Zoophytes are related, and how they must both\r\nbe derived, as two diverging forms, from the Protascus-form. The primary\r\nform of Spongiæ, which I have there called Archispongia, arose out of\r\nthe Protascus by the formation of pores through its body-wall; the\r\nprimary form of Sea-nettles, which I there called Archydra, developed\r\nout of the Protascus by the formation of nettle-organs, as also by the\r\nformation of feelers or tentacles.\r\n\r\nThe main-class or branch of the _Sponges_, _Spongiæ_, or _Porifera_,\r\nlives in the sea, with the single exception of the green fresh-water\r\nSponge (Spongilla). These animals were long considered as plants, later\r\nas Protista; in most Manuals they are still classed among the primæval\r\nanimals, or Protozoa. But since I have demonstrated their development\r\nout of the Gastrula, and the construction of their bodies of two\r\ncellular germ-layers (as in all higher animals), their close\r\nrelationship to Sea-nettles, and especially to the Hydrapolyps, seems\r\nfinally to be established. The _Olynthus_ especially, which I consider\r\nas the common primary form of calcareous sponges, has thrown a complete\r\nand unmistakable light upon this point.\r\n\r\nThe numerous forms comprised in the class of Spongiæ have as yet been\r\nbut little examined; they may be divided into three legions and eight\r\norders. The first legion consists of the soft, gelatinous _Mucous\r\nSponges_ (Myxospongiæ), which are characterized by the absence of any\r\nhard skeleton. Among them are, on the one hand, the long-since-extinct\r\nprimary forms of the whole class, the type of which I consider to be the\r\nArchispongia; on the other hand there are the still living, gelatinous\r\nsponges, of which the _Halisarca_ is best known. We can obtain a notion\r\nof the Archispongia, the most ancient primæval sponge, if we imagine the\r\nOlynthus (see Frontispiece), to be deprived of its radiating calcareous\r\nspiculæ.\r\n\r\nThe second legion of Spongiæ contains the _Fibrous Sponges_\r\n(Fibrospongiæ), the soft body of which is supported by a firm, fibrous\r\nskeleton. This fibrous skeleton often consists merely of so-called\r\n“horny fibres,” formed of a very elastic, not readily destructible,\r\norganic substance. This is the case for instance in our common bathing\r\nSponge (Euspongia officinalis), the purified skeleton of which we use\r\nevery morning when washing. Blended with the horny, fibrous skeleton of\r\nmany of these Sponges, there are numerous flinty spicula; this is the\r\ncase for example with the fresh-water Sponge (Spongilla). In others the\r\nwhole skeleton consists of only calcareous or silicious spicula which\r\nare frequently interwoven into an extremely beautiful lattice-work, as\r\nin the celebrated Venus’ Flower Basket (Euplectella). Three orders of\r\nfibrous sponges may be distinguished according to the different\r\nformation of the spicula, namely, Chalynthina, Geodina, and\r\nHexactinella. The natural history of the fibrous sponges is of especial\r\ninterest to the Theory of Descent, as was first shown by Oscar Schmidt,\r\nthe greatest authority on this group of animals. In no other group,\r\nperhaps, can the unlimited pliability of the specific form, and its\r\nrelation to Adaptation and Inheritance, be so clearly followed step by\r\nstep; perhaps in no other group is the species so difficult to limit and\r\ndefine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl. VII.\r\n\r\nE. Haeckel del. Lagesse sc.]\r\n\r\nThis proposition, which applies to the great legion of the Fibrous\r\nSponges, applies in a still higher degree to the smaller but exceedingly\r\ninteresting legion of the calcareous sponges (Calcispongiæ), on which in\r\n1872, after five years’ careful examination, I published a comprehensive\r\nMonograph. The sixty plates of figures accompanying this Monograph\r\nexplain the extreme pliability of these small sponges “good species” of\r\nwhich, in fact, cannot be spoken of in the usual systematic sense. We\r\nfind among them only varying series of forms, which do not even\r\ncompletely transmit their specific form to their nearest descendants,\r\nbut by adaptation to subordinate, external conditions of existence,\r\nperpetually change. It frequently occurs here, that there arise out of\r\none and the same stock different form-species, which according to the\r\nusual system would belong to several quite distinct genera; this is the\r\ncase, for instance, with the remarkable Ascometra (Frontispiece, Fig.\r\n10.) The entire external bodily form is much more pliable and protean in\r\nCalcareous Sponges than in the silicious sponges, which are\r\ncharacterized by possessing silicious spicula, forming a beautiful\r\nskeleton. Through the study of the comparative anatomy and ontogeny of\r\ncalcareous sponges, we can recognise, with the greatest certainty, the\r\ncommon primary form of the whole group, namely, the sack-shaped\r\n_Olynthus_, whose development is represented in the Frontispiece\r\n(compare its explanation in the Appendix). Out of the Olynthus (Fig. 9\r\non the Frontispiece), the order of the Ascones was the first to develop,\r\nout of which, at a later period, the two other orders of Calcareous\r\nSponges, the _Leucones_ and _Sycones_, arose as diverging branches.\r\nWithin these orders, the descent of the individual forms can again be\r\nfollowed step by step. Thus the Calcareous Sponges in every respect\r\nconfirm the proposition which I have elsewhere maintained: that “the\r\nnatural history of sponges forms a connected and striking argument in\r\nfavour of Darwin.”\r\n\r\nThe second main class or branch in the tribe of Zoophytes is formed by\r\nthe Sea-nettles (Acalephæ, or Cnidæ). This interesting group of animals,\r\nso rich in forms, is composed of three different classes, namely, the\r\nHood-jellies (Hydromedusæ), the Comb-jellies (Ctenophora), and the\r\nCorals (Coralla). The hypothetical, extinct Archydra must be looked upon\r\nas the common primary form of the whole group; it has left two near\r\nrelations in the still living fresh-water polyps (Hydra and\r\nCordylophora). The Archydra was very closely related to the simplest\r\nforms of Spongiæ (Archispongia and Olynthus), and probably differed from\r\nthem only by possessing nettle organs, and by the absence of cutaneous\r\npores. Out of the Archydra there first developed the different Hydroid\r\npolyps, some of which became the primary forms of Corals, others the\r\nprimary forms of Hydromedusæ. The Ctenophora developed later out of a\r\nbranch of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Sea-nettles differ from the Spongiæ (with which they agree in the\r\ncharacteristic formation of the system of the alimentary canal)\r\nprincipally by the constant possession of nettle organs. These are small\r\nbladders filled with poison, large numbers—generally millions—of which\r\nare dispersed over the skin of the sea nettles, and which burst and\r\nempty their contents when touched. Small animals are killed by this; in\r\nlarger animals this nettle poison causes a slight inflammation of the\r\nskin, just as does the poison of our common nettles. Any one who has\r\noften bathed in the sea, will probably have at times come in contact\r\nwith large Hood-jellies (Jelly-fish), and become acquainted with the\r\nunpleasant burning feeling which their nettle organs can produce. The\r\npoison in the splendid blue Jelly-fish, Physalia, or Portuguese\r\nMan-of-war, acts so powerfully that it may lead to the death of a human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe class of Corals (Coralla) lives exclusively in the sea, and is more\r\nespecially represented in the warm seas by an abundance of beautiful and\r\nhighly-coloured forms like flowers. Hence they are also called\r\n_Flower-animals_ (Anthozoa). Most of them are attached to the bottom of\r\nthe sea, and contain an internal calcareous skeleton. Many of them by\r\ncontinued growth produce such immense stocks that their calcareous\r\nskeletons have formed the foundation of whole islands, as is the case\r\nwith the celebrated coral reefs and atolls of the South Seas, the\r\nremarkable forms of which were first explained by Darwin.(13) In corals\r\nthe counterparts, or antimera—that is, the corresponding divisions of\r\nthe body which radiate from and surround the central main axis of the\r\nbody—exist sometimes to the number of four, sometimes to the number of\r\nsix or eight. According to this we distinguish three legions, the\r\nFourfold (Tetracoralla), Sixfold (Hexacoralla), and Eightfold corals\r\n(Octocoralla). The fourfold corals form the common primary group of the\r\nclass, out of which the sixfold and eightfold have developed as two\r\ndiverging branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 4 Classes and 30 Orders of the Animal Plants, or Zoophytes._\r\n\r\n ----------------+--------------------+--------------------+---------------\r\n  _Class of the_ | _Legions of the_   | _Orders of the_    | _A Genus Name_\r\n  _Zoophytes._   |  _Zoophytes._      | _Zoophytes._       |  _as example._\r\n ----------------+--------------------+--------------------+---------------\r\n        I.        { I.

While most corals form stocks like\r\nplants, and are attached to the bottom of the sea, the Hood-jellies\r\ngenerally swim about freely in the form of gelatinous bells. There are,\r\nhowever, numbers of them, especially the lower forms, which adhere to\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and resemble pretty little trees. The lowest and\r\nsimplest members of this class are the little fresh-water polyps (Hydra\r\nand Cordylophora). We may look upon them as but little changed\r\ndescendants of those _Primæval polyps_ (Archydræ), from which, during\r\nthe primordial period, the whole division of the Sea-nettles originated.\r\nScarcely distinguishable from the Hydra are the adherent Hydroid polyps\r\n(Campanularia, Tubularia), which produce freely swimming medusæ by\r\nbudding, and out of the eggs of these there again arise adherent polyps.\r\nThese freely swimming Hood-jellies are mostly of the form of a mushroom,\r\nor of an umbrella, from the rim of which many long and delicate\r\ntentacles hang. They are among the most beautiful and most interesting\r\ninhabitants of the sea. The remarkable history of their lives, and\r\nespecially the complicated alternation of generation of polyps and\r\nmedusæ, are among the strongest proofs of the truth of the theory of\r\ndescent. For just as Medusæ still daily arise out of the Hydroids, did\r\nthe freely swimming medusa-form originally proceed, phylogenetically,\r\nout of the adherent polyp-form. Equally important for the theory of\r\ndescent is the remarkable _division of labour_ of the individuals, which\r\namong some of them is developed to an astonishingly high degree, more\r\nespecially in the splendid _Siphonophora_.(37) (Plate VII. Fig. 13.)\r\n\r\nThe third class of Sea-nettles—the peculiar division of Comb-jellies\r\n(Ctenophora), probably developed out of a branch of the Hood-jellies.\r\nThe Ctenophora, which are also called Ribbed-jellies, possess a body of\r\nthe form of a cucumber, which, like the body of most Hood-jellies, is as\r\nclear and transparent as crystal or cut glass. Comb or Ribbed-jellies\r\nare characterized by their peculiar organs of motion, namely, by eight\r\nrows of paddling, ciliated leaflets, which run in the form of eight ribs\r\nfrom one end of the longitudinal axis (from the mouth) to the opposite\r\nend. Those with narrow mouths (Stenostoma) probably developed later out\r\nof those with wide mouths (Eurystoma). (Compare Plate VII. Fig. 16.)\r\n\r\nThe third tribe of the animal kingdom, the phylum of _Worms_ or\r\nworm-like animals (Vermes, or Helminthes), contains a number of\r\ndiverging branches. Some of these numerous branches have developed into\r\nwell-marked and perfectly independent classes of Worms, but others\r\nchanged long since into the original, radical forms of the four higher\r\ntribes of animals. Each of these four higher tribes (and likewise the\r\ntribe of Zoophytes) we may picture to ourselves in the form of a lofty\r\ntree, whose branches represent the different classes, orders, families,\r\netc. The phylum of Worms, on the other hand, we have to conceive as a\r\nlow bush or shrub, out of whose root a mass of independent branches\r\nshoot up in different directions. From this densely branched shrub, most\r\nof the branches of which are dead, there rise four high stems with many\r\nbranches. These are the four lofty trees just mentioned as representing\r\nthe higher phyla—the Echinoderma, Articulata, Mollusca, and Vertebrata.\r\nThese four stems are directly connected with one another at the root\r\nonly, to wit, by the common primary group of the Worm tribe.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary difficulties which the systematic arrangement of Worms\r\npresents, for this reason merely, are still more increased by the fact\r\nthat we do not possess any fossil remains of them. Most of the Worms had\r\nand still have such soft bodies that they could not leave any\r\ncharacteristic traces in the neptunic strata of the earth. Hence in this\r\ncase again we are entirely confined to the records of creation furnished\r\nby ontogeny and comparative anatomy. In making then the exceedingly\r\ndifficult attempt to throw a few hypothetical rays of light upon the\r\nobscurity of the pedigree of Worms, I must therefore expressly remark\r\nthat this sketch, like all similar attempts possesses only a provisional\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe numerous classes distinguished in the tribe of Worms, and which\r\nalmost every zoologist groups and defines according to his own personal\r\nviews, are, in the first place, divided into two essentially different\r\ngroups or branches, which in my Monograph of the Calcareous Sponges I\r\nhave termed Acœlomi and Cœlomati. For all the lower Worms which are\r\ncomprised in the class of Flat-worms (Platyhelminthes), (the\r\nGliding-worms, Sucker-worms, Tape-worms), differ very strikingly from\r\nother Worms, in the fact that they possess neither blood nor body-cavity\r\n(no cœlome); they are, therefore, called Acœlomi. The true cavity, or\r\ncœlome, is completely absent in them as in all the Zoophytes; in this\r\nimportant respect the two groups are directly allied. But _all other\r\nWorms_ (like the four higher tribes of animals) possess a genuine\r\nbody-cavity and a vascular system connected with it, which is filled\r\nwith blood; hence we class them together as _Cœlomati_.\r\n\r\nThe main division of _Bloodless Worms_ (Acœlomi) contains, according to\r\nour phylogenetic views, besides the still living Flat-worms, the unknown\r\nand extinct primary forms of the whole tribe of Worms, which we shall\r\ncall the Primæval Worms (Archelminthes). The type of these _Primæval\r\nWorms_, the ancient Prothelmis, may be directly derived from the Gastræa\r\n(p. 133). Even at present the Gastrula-form—the faithful historical\r\nportrait of the Gastræa—recurs in the ontogenesis of the most different\r\nkinds of worms as a transient larva-form. The ciliated Gliding-worms\r\n(Turbellaria), the primary group of the present Planary or Flat-worms\r\n(Platyhelminthes), are the nearest akin to the Primæval Worms. The\r\nparasitical Sucker-worms (Trematoda) arose out of the Gliding-worms,\r\nwhich live freely in water, by adaptation to a parasitical mode of life;\r\nand out of them later on—by an increasing parasitism—arose the\r\nTape-worms (Cestoda).\r\n\r\nOut of a branch of the Acœlomi arose the second main division of the\r\nWorm tribe, the Worms with blood and body-cavity (Cœlomati): of these\r\nthere are seven different classes.\r\n\r\nThe Pedigree on p. 151 shows how the obscure phylogeny of the seven\r\nclasses of Cœlomati may be supposed to stand. We shall, however, mention\r\nthese classes here quite briefly, as their relationships and derivation\r\nare, at present, still very complicated and obscure. More numerous and\r\nmore accurate investigations of the ontogeny of the different Cœlomati\r\nwill at some future time throw light upon their phylogenesis.\r\n\r\nThe Round Worms (Nemathelminthes) which we mention as the first class of\r\nthe Cœlomati, and which are characterized by their cylindrical form,\r\nconsist principally of parasitical Worms which live in the interior of\r\nother animals. Of human parasites, the celebrated Trichinæ, the\r\nMaw-worms, Whip-worms, etc., for example, belong to them. The Star-worms\r\n(Gephyrea) which live exclusively in the sea are allied to round worms,\r\nand the comprehensive class of Ring-worms (Annelida) are allied to the\r\nformer. To the Ring-worms, whose long body is composed of a number of\r\nsegments, all alike in structure, belong the Leeches (Hirudinea),\r\nEarth-worms (Lumbricina), and all the marine bristle-footed Worms\r\n(Chætopoda). Nearly akin to them are the Snout-worms (Rhynchocœla), and\r\nthe small microscopic Wheel-worms (Rotifera). The unknown, extinct,\r\nprimary forms of the tribe of Sea-stars (Echinoderma), and of the tribe\r\nof the articulated animals (Arthropoda), were nearest akin to the\r\nRing-worms. On the other hand, we must probably look for the primary\r\nforms of the great tribe of Molluscs in extinct Worms, which were very\r\nclosely related to the Moss-polyps (Bryozoa) of the present day; and for\r\nthe primary forms of the Vertebrata in the unknown Cœlomati, whose\r\nnearest kin of the present day are the Sea-sacs, especially the Ascidia.\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 8 Classes and 22 Orders of the Worm Tribe._\r\n\r\n(Compare Gen.

They all live in the ocean, where some of the Ascidiæ adhere to\r\nthe bottom, while others (the sea-barrels, or Thaliacea) swim about\r\nfreely. In all of them the non-jointed body has the form of a simple\r\nbarrel-shaped sack, which is surrounded by a thick cartilaginous mantle.\r\nThis mantle consists of the same non-nitrogenous combination of carbon,\r\nwhich, under the name of cellulose, plays an important part in the\r\nVegetable Kingdom, and forms the largest portion of vegetable cellular\r\nmembranes, and consequently also the greater part of wood. The\r\nbarrel-shaped body generally possesses no external appendages. No one\r\nwould recognise in them a trace of relationship to the highly\r\ndifferentiated vertebrate animals. And yet this can no longer be\r\ndoubted, since Kowalewsky’s investigations, which in the year 1867\r\nsuddenly threw an exceedingly surprising and unmistakable light upon\r\nthem. From these investigations it has become clear that the individual\r\ndevelopment of the adherent simple Ascidian Phallusia agrees in most\r\npoints with that of the lowest vertebrate animal, namely, the Lancelet\r\n(Amphioxus lanceolatus). The early stages of the Ascidia possess the\r\nbeginnings of the _spinal marrow_ and the _spinal column_ (chorda\r\ndorsalis) lying beneath it, which are the two most essential and most\r\ncharacteristic organs of the vertebrate animal. Accordingly, of all\r\ninvertebrate animals known to us, the _Tunicates are without doubt the\r\nnearest blood relations of the Vertebrates_, and must be considered as\r\nthe nearest relations of those Worms out of which the vertebrate tribe\r\nhas developed. (Compare Plates XII. and XIII.)\r\n\r\nWhile thus different branches of the Cœlomatous group of the Worms\r\nfurnish us with several genealogical links leading to the four higher\r\ntribes of animals, and give us important phylogenetic indications of\r\ntheir origin, the lower group of Acœlomi, on the other hand, show close\r\nrelationships to the Zoophytes, and to the Primæval animals. The great\r\nphylogenetic interest of the Worm tribe rests upon this peculiar\r\nintermediate position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPEDIGREE AND HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nII. MOLLUSCA, STAR-FISHES, AND ARTICULATED ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tribe of Molluscs.—Four Classes of Molluscs: Lamp-shells\r\n  (Spirobranchia); Mussels (Lamellibranchia); Snails (Cochlides);\r\n  Cuttle-fish (Cephalopoda).—Tribe of Star-fishes, or\r\n  Echinoderma.—Their Derivation from Ringed Worms (Mailed Worms,\r\n  or Phracthelminthes).—The Alternation of Generation in the\r\n  Echinoderma.—Four Classes of Star-fish: Sea-stars (Asteridea);\r\n  Sea-lilies (Crinoidea); Sea-urchins (Echinidea); Sea-cucumbers\r\n  (Holothuridea).—Tribe of Articulated Animals, or\r\n  Arthropoda.—Four Classes of Articulated Animals: Branchiata, or\r\n  Crustacea, breathing through gills; Jointed Crabs; Mailed\r\n  Crabs; Articulata Tracheata, breathing through Air\r\n  Tubes.—Spiders (Long Spiders, Round\r\n  Spiders).—Myriopods.—Insects.—Chewing and Sucking\r\n  Insects.—Pedigree and History of the Eight Orders of Insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great natural main groups of the animal kingdom, which we have\r\ndistinguished as TRIBES, or PHYLA (“types” according to Bär and Cuvier),\r\nare not all of equal systematic importance for our phylogeny or history\r\nof the pedigree of the living world. They can neither be classed in a\r\nsingle series of stages, one above another, nor be considered as\r\nentirely independent stems, nor as equal branches of a single\r\nfamily-tree. It seems rather (as we saw in the last chapter) that the\r\ntribe of Protozoa, the so-called primæval animals, is the common radical\r\ngroup of the whole animal kingdom. Out of the Gastræada—which we class\r\namong the Protozoa—the Zoophytes and the Worms have developed, as two\r\ndiverging branches. We must now in turn look upon the varied and\r\nmuch-branching tribe of Worms as the common primary group, out of which\r\n(from perfectly distinct branches) arose the remaining tribes, the four\r\nhigher phyla of the animal kingdom. (Compare the Pedigree, p. 133.)\r\n\r\nLet us now take a genealogical look at these four higher tribes of\r\nanimals, and try whether we cannot make out the most important outlines\r\nof their pedigree. Even should this attempt prove defective and\r\nimperfect, we shall at all events have made a beginning, and paved the\r\nroad for subsequent and more satisfactory attempts.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter in what succession we take up the examination of the\r\nfour higher tribes. For these four phyla have no close relationship\r\nwhatever among one another, but have grown out from entirely distinct\r\nbranches of the group of Worms (p. 133). We may consider the tribe of\r\nMolluscs as the most imperfect and the lowest in point of morphological\r\ndevelopment. We nowhere meet among them with the characteristic\r\narticulation or segmented formation of the body, which distinguishes\r\neven the Ring-worms, and which in the other three higher tribes—the\r\nEchinoderma, Articulata, and Vertebrata—is most essentially connected\r\nwith the high development of their forms, their differentiation, and\r\nperfection. The body in all Molluscs—in mussels, snails, etc.—is a\r\nsimple non-jointed sack, in the cavity of which lie the intestines. The\r\nnervous system consists not of a cord but of several distinct (generally\r\nthree) pairs of knots loosely connected with one another. For these and\r\nmany other anatomical reasons, I consider the tribe of Molluscs (in\r\nspite of the high physiological development of its most perfect forms)\r\nto be morphologically the lowest among the four higher tribes of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWhilst, for reasons already given, we exclude the Moss-polyps, and\r\nTunicates—which have hitherto been generally classed with the tribe of\r\nMolluscs—we retain as genuine Molluscs the following four classes:\r\nLamp-shells, Mussels, Snails, and Cuttles. The two lower classes of\r\nMolluscs, the Lamp-shells and Mussels, possess neither head nor teeth,\r\nand they can therefore be comprised under one main class, or branch, as\r\nheadless animals (Acephala), or toothless animals (Anodontoda). This\r\nbranch is also frequently called that of the clam-shells (Conchifera, or\r\nBivalvia), because all its members possess a two-valved calcareous\r\nshell. In contrast to these the two higher classes of Molluscs, the\r\nsnails and cuttles, may be represented as a second branch with the name\r\nof Head-bearers (Cephalophora), or Tooth-bearers (Odontophora), because\r\nboth head and teeth are developed in them.\r\n\r\nThe soft, sack-shaped body in most Molluscs is protected by a calcareous\r\nshell or house, which in the Acephala (lamp-shells and mussels) consists\r\nof two valves, but in the Cephalophora (snails and cuttles) is generally\r\na spiral tube (the so-called snail’s house). Although these hard\r\nskeletons are found in large quantities in a petrified state in all the\r\nneptunic strata, yet they tell us but little of the historical\r\ndevelopment of the tribe, which must have taken place for the most part\r\nin the primordial period. Even in the Silurian strata we find fossil\r\nremains of all the four classes of Molluscs, one beside the other, and\r\nthis, conjointly with much other evidence, distinctly proves that the\r\ntribe of Molluscs had then obtained a strong development, when the\r\nhigher tribes, especially the Articulates and Vertebrates, had scarcely\r\ngot beyond the beginning of their historical development. In subsequent\r\nperiods, especially in the primary and secondary periods, these higher\r\ntribes increased in importance more and more at the expense of Molluscs\r\nand Worms, which were no match for them in the struggle for life, and\r\naccordingly decreased in number. The still living Molluscs and Worms\r\nmust be considered as only a proportionately small remnant of the vast\r\nmolluscan fauna, which greatly predominated in the primordial and\r\nprimary periods over the other tribes. (Compare Plate VI. and\r\nexplanation in the Appendix.)\r\n\r\nNo tribe of animals shows more distinctly than do the Molluscs, how very\r\ndifferent the value of fossils is in geology and in phylogeny. In\r\ngeology the different species of the fossil shells of Molluscs are of\r\nthe greatest importance because they serve as excellent marks whereby to\r\ncharacterize the different groups of strata, and to fix their relative\r\nages. As far as relates to the genealogy of Molluscs, however, they are\r\nof very little value, because, on the one hand, the shells are parts of\r\nquite subordinate morphological importance, and because the actual\r\ndevelopment of the tribe belongs to the earlier primordial period, from\r\nwhich no distinct fossils have been preserved. If therefore we wish to\r\nconstruct the pedigree of Molluscs, we are mainly dependent upon the\r\nrecords of ontogeny and comparative anatomy from which we obtain\r\nsomething like the following result. (Gen. Morph. ii. Plate VI. pp.\r\n102-116.)\r\n\r\nThe lowest stage of the four classes of genuine Molluscs known to us, is\r\noccupied by the Lamp-shells or Spiral-gills (Spirobranchia), frequently\r\nbut inappropriately called Arm-footers (Brachiopoda), which have become\r\nattached to the bottom of the sea. There now exist but few forms of\r\nthis class; for instance, some species of Lingula, Terebratula, and\r\nothers akin to them, which are but feeble remnants of the great variety\r\nof forms which represented the Lamp-shells in earlier periods of the\r\nearth’s history. In the Silurian period they constituted the principal\r\nportion of the whole Mollusc tribe. From the agreement which, in many\r\nrespects, their early stage of development presents with the Moss\r\nanimals, it has been concluded that they have developed out of Worms,\r\nwhich were nearly related to this class. Of the two sub-classes of\r\nLamp-shells, the Hinge-less (Ecardines) must be looked upon as the lower\r\nand more imperfect, the Hinged (Testicardines) as the higher and more\r\nfully developed group.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical difference between the Lamp-shells and the three other\r\nclasses of Molluscs is so considerable that the latter may be\r\ndistinguished from the former by the name of Otocardia. All the\r\nOtocardia have a heart with chamber (ventricle) and ante-chamber\r\n(auricle), whereas Lamp-shells do not possess the ante-chamber.\r\nMoreover, the central nervous system is developed only in the former\r\n(and not in the latter) in the shape of a complete pharyngeal ring.\r\nHence the four classes of Molluscs may be grouped in the following\r\nmanner:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                     {     1. Lamp-shells     }     I. Haplocardia\r\n  I.  Molluscs       {     (Spirobranchia).   }     (with simple heart).\r\n  without head.      {\r\n  _Acephala._        {     2. Mussels         }\r\n                     {     (Lamellibranchia). }     II. Otocardia\r\n                                              }     (with chamber\r\n  II.  Molluscs      {     3. Snails          }     and ante-chamber\r\n  with head.         {     (Cochlides).       }     to the heart).\r\n  _Cephalophora._    {     4. Cuttles         }\r\n                     {     (Cephalopoda).     }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of these structural dispositions for the history of the\r\npedigree of Molluscs, which is confirmed by palæontology, is that\r\nLamp-shells stand much nearer to the primæval root of the whole tribe of\r\nMolluscs than do the Otocardia. Probably Mussels and Snails developed as\r\ntwo diverging branches out of Molluscs, which were nearly akin to the\r\nLamp-shells.\r\n\r\nMussels, or Plate-gills (Lamellibranchia), possess a bivalved shell like\r\nthe Lamp-shells. In the latter, one of the two valves covers the back,\r\nthe other the belly of the animal; whereas in Mussels the two valves lie\r\nsymmetrically on the right and left side of the body. Most Mussels live\r\nin the sea, only a few in fresh water. The class is divided into two\r\nsub-classes, Asiphonia and Siphonida, of which the latter were developed\r\nat a later period out of the former. Among the Asiphonia are Oysters,\r\nmother-of-pearl Shells, and fresh water Mussels; among the Siphonida,\r\nwhich are characterized by a respiratory tube, are the Venus-shells,\r\nRazor-shells, and Burrowing Clams. The higher Molluscs seem to have\r\ndeveloped at a later period out of those without head and teeth; they\r\nare distinguished from the latter by the distinct formation of the head,\r\nand more especially by a peculiar kind of tooth apparatus. Their tongue\r\npresents a curious plate, armed with a great number of teeth. In our\r\ncommon Vineyard Snail (Helix pomatia) the number of teeth amount to\r\n21,000, and in the large Garden Slug (Limax maximus) to 26,800.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 4 Classes, 8 Sub-classes, and 21 Orders of Molluscs._\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-----------------------+------------------------+-------------------\r\n    _Classes of_    |    _Sub-classes of_   |    _Orders of_         |  _Systematic Name_\r\n    _Molluscs._     |      _Molluscs._      |    _Molluscs._         |   _of the Orders._\r\n  ------------------+-----------------------+------------------------+-------------------\r\n          I. _Molluscs without head or teeth_: ACEPHALA _or_ ANODONTODA.\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n      I.            {   I.

The\r\nStump-headed Snails (Perocephala) are very closely allied to Mussels\r\n(through the Tooth-shells), and also to the Cuttle-fish (through the\r\nButterfly-snails). The more highly developed Snails, with large heads\r\n(Delocephala), can be divided into Snails with gills (Branchiata) and\r\nSnails with lungs (Pulmonata). Among the latter are the Land-snails, the\r\nonly Molluscs which have left the water and become habituated to a life\r\non land. The great majority of Snails live in the sea, only a few live\r\nin fresh water. Some River-snails in the tropics (the Ampullaria) are\r\namphibious, living sometimes on land, sometimes in water, and at one\r\ntime they breathe through gills, at another through lungs. They have\r\nboth kinds of respiratory organs, like the Mud-fish and Gilled Newts\r\namong the Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last class, and at the same time the most highly\r\ndeveloped class of Molluscs, is that of the Cuttles, or Poulps, also\r\ncalled Cephalopoda (foot attached to the head). They all live in the\r\nsea, and are distinguished from Snails by eight, ten, or more long arms,\r\nwhich surround the mouth in a circle. The Cuttles existing in our recent\r\noceans—the Sepia, Calamary, Argonaut, and Pearly Nautilus—are, like the\r\nfew Spiral-gill Lamp-shells of the present time, but a poor remnant of\r\nthe host which represents this class in the oceans of the primordial,\r\nprimary, and secondary periods. The numerous fossil “Ammon’s horns”\r\n(Ammonites), “pearl boats” (Nautilus), and “thunderbolts” (Belemnites)\r\nare evidences of the long since extinct splendour of the tribe. The\r\nPoulps, or Cuttles, have probably developed out of a low branch of the\r\nsnail class, out of the Butterfly-snails (Pteropoda) or kindred forms.\r\n\r\nThe different sub-classes and orders, distinguished in the four classes\r\nof Molluscs, whose systematic succession is given on the Table (p.\r\n160), furnish various proofs of the validity of the law of progress by\r\ntheir historical development and by the systematic development\r\ncorresponding to it. As however these subordinate groups of Molluscs are\r\nin themselves of no further special interest, I must refer to the sketch\r\nof their pedigree on p. 161, and to the detailed pedigree of Molluscs\r\nwhich I have given in my General Morphology, and I shall now at once\r\nturn to the consideration of the tribe of Star-fishes.\r\n\r\nThe Star-fishes (Echinoderma, or Estrellæ) among which are the four\r\nclasses of Sea-stars, Sea-lilies, Sea-urchins, and Sea-cucumbers are one\r\nof the most interesting divisions of the animal kingdom, and yet we know\r\nless about them than about any. They all live in the sea. Every one who\r\nhas been at the sea shore must have seen at least two of their forms,\r\nthe Sea-stars and the Sea-urchins. The tribe of Star-fishes must be\r\nconsidered as a completely independent tribe of the animal kingdom on\r\naccount of its very peculiar organization, and must be carefully\r\ndistinguished from the Animal-plants—Zoophytes, or Cœlenterata, with\r\nwhich it is still frequently but erroneously classed under the name\r\nRadiata (as for example, by Agassiz, who even to this day defends this\r\nerror of Cuvier’s, together with many others).\r\n\r\nAll Echinoderma are characterized, and at the same time distinguished\r\nfrom all other animals, by a very remarkable apparatus for locomotion,\r\nwhich consists of a complicated system of canals or tubes, filled with\r\nsea water from without. The sea water in these aqueducts is moved partly\r\nby the strokes of the cilia, or vibratile hairs lining their walls, and\r\npartly by the contractions of the muscular walls of the tubes\r\nthemselves, which resemble india-rubber bags. The water is pressed from\r\nthe tubes into a number of little hollow feet, which thereby become\r\nwidely distended, and are then employed for walking and suction. The\r\nSea-stars are moreover characterized by a peculiar calcareous formation\r\nin the skin, which in most cases forms a firm, well-closed coat of mail,\r\ncomposed of a number of plates. In almost all Echinoderma the body\r\nconsists of five radii (counterparts, or antimera) standing round the\r\nmain axis of the body, where they meet. It is only in some species of\r\nSea-stars that the number of these radii amount to more than five—to\r\n6-9, 10-12, or even to 20-40; and in this case the number of radii is\r\ngenerally not constant, but varies in different individuals of one\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe historical development and the pedigree of the Echinoderma are\r\ncompletely revealed to us by their numerous and, in most cases,\r\nexcellently preserved fossil remains, by their very remarkable\r\nindividual developmental history, and by their interesting comparative\r\nanatomy; this is the case with no other tribe of animals, even the\r\nVertebrata themselves are not to be excepted. By a critical use of those\r\nthree archives, and by a careful comparison of the results derived from\r\ntheir study, we obtain the following genealogy of the Star-fishes, which\r\nI have already published in my General Morphology (vol. ii. Plate IV.\r\npp. 62-77.)\r\n\r\nThe most ancient and original group of the Star-fishes, the primary form\r\nof the whole phylum, consists of the class of the true Sea-stars\r\n(Asterida). This is established by numerous and important arguments in\r\nanatomy and the history of development, but above all by the irregular\r\nand varying number of the radii, or antimera, which in all other\r\nEchinoderma is limited, without exception, to five. Every Star-fish\r\nconsists of a central, small, body-disc, all round the circumference of\r\nwhich are attached five or several long articulated arms. _Each arm of\r\nthe Star-fish essentially corresponds in its organisation with an\r\narticulated worm_ of the class of Ring-worms, or Annelida (p. 149). I\r\ntherefore consider the Star-fish as a genuine _stock or cormus of five\r\nor more articulated worms_, which have arisen by the star-wise growth of\r\na number of buds out of a central mother-worm. The connected members,\r\nthus grouped like the rays of a star, have inherited from the\r\nmother-worm the common opening of the mouth, and the common digestive\r\ncavity (stomach) lying in the central body-disc. The end by which they\r\nhave grown together, and which fuses in the common central disc,\r\nprobably corresponds to the posterior end of the original independent\r\nworms.\r\n\r\nIn exactly the same way several individuals of certain kinds of worms\r\nare united so as to form a star-like cormus. This is the case in the\r\n_Botryllidæ_, compound Ascidians, belonging to the class of the\r\nTunicata. Here also the posterior ends of the individual worms have\r\ngrown together, and have formed a common outlet for discharges, a\r\ncentral cloaca; whereas at the anterior end each worm still possesses\r\nits own mouth. In Star-fishes the original mouths have probably become\r\nclosed in the course of the historical development of the cormus, or\r\ncolony, whereas the cloaca has developed into a common mouth for the\r\nwhole cormus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 4 Classes, 9 Sub-classes, and 20 Orders of Star-fishes._\r\n\r\n(Compare Gen.

This hypothesis is most strongly supported by the\r\ncomparative anatomy, and by the ontogeny of some Star-fishes (Colastra),\r\nand of segmented worms. The many-jointed Ring-worms (Annelida) in their\r\ninner structure are closely allied to the individual arms or radii of\r\nthe Star-fishes, that is to the original single worms, which each arm\r\nrepresents. Each of the five worms of the Star-fish is a chain composed\r\nof a great number of equi-formal members, or metamera, lying one behind\r\nthe other, like every segmented Worm, and every Arthropod. As in the\r\nlatter a central nervous cord, the ventral nerve cord runs along the\r\ncentral line of the ventral wall of each segment. On each metameron\r\nthere is a pair of non-jointed feet, and besides these, in most cases,\r\none or more hard thorns or bristles similar to those of many Ring-worms.\r\nA detached arm of a Star-fish can lead an independent life, and can\r\nthen, by the radially-directed growth of buds at one end, again become a\r\ncomplete star.\r\n\r\nThe most important proofs, however, of the truth of my hypothesis are\r\nfurnished by the ontogeny or the individual development of the\r\nEchinoderma. The most remarkable facts of this ontogeny were first\r\ndiscovered in the year 1848 by the great zoologist, Johannes Müller of\r\nBerlin. Some of its most important stages are represented on Plates\r\nVIII. and IX. (Compare their explanation in the Appendix.) Fig. _A_ on\r\nPlate IX. shows us a common Sea-star (Uraster), Fig. _B_, a Sea-lily\r\n(Comatula), Fig. _C_, a Sea-urchin (Echinus), and Fig. _D_, a\r\nSea-cucumber (Synapta). In spite of the extraordinary difference of form\r\nmanifested by these four representatives of the different classes of\r\nStar-fishes, yet the beginning of their development is identical in all\r\ncases. Out of the egg an animal-form develops which is utterly\r\ndifferent from the fully developed Star-fish, but very like the ciliated\r\nlarvæ of certain segmented Worms (Star-worms and Ring-worms). This\r\npeculiar animal-form is generally called the “larva,” but more correctly\r\nthe “nurse” of these Star-fish. It is very small and transparent, swims\r\nabout by means of a fringe of cilia, and is always composed of two equal\r\nsymmetrical halves or sides. The fully grown Echinoderm, however—which\r\nis frequently more than a hundred times larger, and quite opaque—creeps\r\nat the bottom of the sea, and is always composed of at least five\r\nco-ordinate pieces, or antimera, in the form of radii. Plate VIII. shows\r\nthe development of the “nurses” of the four Echinoderms represented on\r\nPlate IX.\r\n\r\nThe fully developed Echinoderm arises by a very remarkable process of\r\nbudding in the interior of the “nurse,” of which it retains little more\r\nthan the stomach. The nurse, erroneously called the “larva,” of the\r\nEchinoderm, must accordingly be regarded as a solitary worm, which by\r\ninternal budding produces a second generation, in the form of a stock of\r\nstar-shaped and connected worms. The whole of this process is a genuine\r\nalternation of generations, or metagenesis, not a “metamorphosis,” as is\r\ngenerally though erroneously stated. A similar alternation of\r\ngenerations also occurs in many other worms, especially in some star\r\nworms (Sipunculidæ), and cord worms (Nemertinæ). Now if, bearing in mind\r\nthe fundamental law of biogeny, we refer the ontogeny of Echinoderma to\r\ntheir phylogeny, then the whole historical development of the\r\nStar-fishes suddenly becomes clear and intelligible to us, whereas\r\nwithout this hypothesis it remains an insoluble mystery. (Compare Gen.\r\nMorph. ii. pp. 95-99.)\r\n\r\nBesides the reasons mentioned, there are many other facts (principally\r\nfrom the comparative anatomy of Echinoderma) which most distinctly prove\r\nthe correctness of my hypothesis. I established this hypothesis in 1866,\r\nwithout having any idea that _fossil articulated worms_ still existed,\r\napparently answering to the hypothetical primary forms. Such have in the\r\nmean time, however, really been discovered. In a treatise “On the\r\nEquivalent of the North American Taconic Schist in Germany,”[3] Geinitz\r\nand Liebe, in 1867, have described a number of articulated Silurian\r\nworms, which completely confirm my suppositions. Numbers of these very\r\nremarkable worms are found in an excellent state of preservation in the\r\nslates of Würzbach, in the upper districts of Reusz. They are of the\r\nsame structure as the articulated arm of a Star-fish, and evidently\r\npossessed a hard coat of mail, a much denser, more solid cutaneous\r\nskeleton than other worms in general. The number of body-segments, or\r\nmetamera, is very considerable, so that the worms, although no more than\r\na quarter or half an inch in breadth, attained a length of from two to\r\nthree feet. The excellently preserved impressions, especially those of\r\nthe Phyllodocites thuringiacus and Crossopodia Henrici, are so like the\r\narms of many Star-fish (Colastra) that their true blood relationship\r\nseems very probable. This primæval group of worms, which are most\r\nprobably the ancestors of Star-fish, I call Mailed worms\r\n(Phracthelminthes, p. 150.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl. viii.\r\n\r\nSTAR FISHES. FIRST GENERATION. WORM PERSON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl. ix.\r\n\r\nSTAR FISHES. SECOND GENERATION. WORM STOCK.]\r\n\r\nThe three other classes of Echinoderma evidently arose at a later period\r\nout of the class of Sea-stars which have most faithfully retained the\r\noriginal form of the stellate colony of worms. The Sea-lilies, or\r\nCrinoida, differ least from them, but having given up the free, slow\r\nmotion possessed by other Sea-stars, they have become adherent to rocks,\r\netc., and form for themselves a long stalk. Some Encrinites, however\r\n(for example, the Comatulæ, Fig. _B_, on Plates VIII. and IX.),\r\nafterwards detach themselves from their stalk. The original worm\r\nindividuals in the Crinoida are indeed no longer preserved in the same\r\nindependent condition as in the case of the common star-fish; but they\r\nnevertheless always possess articulated arms extending from a common\r\ncentral disc. Hence we may unite the Sea-lilies and Sea-stars into a\r\nmain-class, or branch, characterized as possessing articulated arms\r\n(Colobrachia).\r\n\r\nIn the other two classes of Echinoderma, the Sea-urchins and\r\nSea-cucumbers, the articulated arms are no longer present as independent\r\nparts, but, by the increased centralization of the stock, have\r\ncompletely fused so as to form a common, inflated, central disc, which\r\nnow looks like a simple box or capsule without arms. The original stock\r\nof five individuals has apparently degenerated to the form-value of a\r\nsimple individual, a single person. Hence we may represent these two\r\nclasses as a branch characterized as being without arms (Lipobrachia),\r\nequivalent to those which possess articulated arms. The first of these\r\ntwo classes, that of Sea-urchins (Echinida) takes its name from the\r\nnumerous and frequently very large thorns which cover the hard shell,\r\nwhich is itself artistically built up of calcareous plates. (Fig. _C_,\r\nPlates VIII. and IX.) The fundamental form of the shell itself is a\r\npentagonal pyramid. The Sea-urchins probably developed directly out of\r\nthe group of Sea-stars. The different classes and orders of marine\r\nlilies and stars which are given in the following table, illustrate the\r\nlaws of progress and differentiation in a striking manner. In each\r\nsucceeding period of the earth’s history we see the individual classes\r\ncontinually increasing in variety and perfection. (Gen. Morph. ii. Plate\r\nIV.)\r\n\r\nThe history of three of these classes of Star-fish is very minutely\r\nrecorded by numerous and excellently preserved fossils, but on the other\r\nhand, we know almost nothing of the historical development of the fourth\r\nclass, that of the Sea-cucumbers (Holothuriæ). These curious\r\nsausage-shaped Star-fish manifest externally a deceptive similarity to\r\nworms. (Fig. _D_, Plates VIII. and IX.) The skeletal structures in their\r\nskin are very imperfect, and hence no distinct remains of their\r\nelongated, cylindrical, worm-like body could be preserved in a fossil\r\nstate. However, from the comparative anatomy of the Holothuriæ, we can\r\ninfer that they have arisen, by the softening of the cutaneous skeleton,\r\nfrom members of the class of Sea-urchins.\r\n\r\nFrom the Star-fish we turn to the fifth and most highly developed tribe\r\nof the invertebrate animals, namely, the phylum of Articulata, or those\r\nwith _jointed feet_ (Arthropoda). As has already been remarked, this\r\ntribe corresponds to Linnæus’ class of Insects. It contains four\r\nclasses: (1) the genuine six-legged Insects, or Flies; (2) the\r\neight-legged Spiders; (3) the Centipedes, with numerous pairs of legs;\r\nand (4) the Crabs, or Crustacea, whose legs vary in number. The last\r\nclass breathe water through gills, and may therefore be contrasted as\r\nthe main-class of gill-breathing Arthropoda, or Gilled Insects\r\n(Carides), with the three first classes. The latter breathe air by means\r\nof peculiar wind-pipes, or tracheæ, and may therefore appropriately be\r\nunited to form the main-class of the trachea-breathing Arthropoda, or\r\nTracheate Insects (Tracheata).\r\n\r\nIn all animals with articulated feet, as the name indicates, the legs\r\nare distinctly articulated, and by this, as well as by the strong\r\ndifferentiation of the separate parts of the body, or metamera, they are\r\nsharply distinguished from Ringed worms, with which Bär and Cuvier\r\nclassed them. They are, however, in every respect so like the Ringed\r\nworms that they can scarcely be considered altogether distinct from\r\nthem. They, like the Ringed worms, possess a very characteristic form of\r\nthe central nervous system, the so-called ventral marrow, which\r\ncommences in a gullet-ring encircling the mouth. From other facts also,\r\nit is evident that the Arthropoda developed at a late period out of\r\narticulated worms. Probably either the Wheel Animalcules or the Ringed\r\nworms are their nearest blood relations in the Worm tribe. (Gen. Morph.\r\nii. Plate V. pp. 85-102.)\r\n\r\nNow, although the derivation of the Arthropoda from ringed Worms may be\r\nconsidered as certain, still it cannot with equal assurance be\r\nmaintained that the whole tribe of the former has arisen out of one\r\nbranch of the latter. For several reasons seem to support the\r\nsupposition that the Gilled Arthropods have developed out of a branch of\r\narticulated worms, different from that which gave rise to the Tracheate\r\nArthropods. But on the whole it remains more probable that both\r\nmain-classes have arisen out of one and the same group of Worms. In this\r\ncase the Tracheate Insects—Spiders, Flies, and Centipedes—must have\r\nbranched off at a later period from the gill-breathing Insects, or\r\nCrustacea.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of the Arthropoda can on the whole be clearly made out from\r\nthe palæontology, comparative anatomy, and ontogeny of its four\r\nclasses, although here, as everywhere else, many details remain very\r\nobscure. Not until the history of the individual development of all the\r\ndifferent groups has become more accurately known than it is at present,\r\ncan this obscurity be removed. The history of the class of Gilled\r\nInsects, or Crabs (Carides), is at present that best known to us; they\r\nare also called encrusted animals (Crustacea), on account of the hard\r\ncrust or covering of their body. The ontogeny of these animals is\r\nextremely interesting and, like that of Vertebrate animals, distinctly\r\nreveals the essential outlines of the history of their tribe, that is,\r\ntheir phylogeny. Fritz Müller, in his work, “Für Darwin,”(16) which has\r\nalready been referred to, has explained this remarkable series of facts\r\nin a very able manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nauplius. Youth-form of six Crab-fish._ _Pl. X._\r\n\r\n  A. Limnetis.\r\n  B. Cyclops.\r\n  C. Lernacocera.\r\n  D. Lepas.\r\n  E. Sacculina.\r\n  F.

Peneus.]\r\n\r\nThe common primary form of all Crabs, which in most cases is even now\r\nthe first to develop out of the egg, is originally one and the same, the\r\nso-called _Nauplius_. This remarkable primæval crab represents a very\r\nsimple form of articulated animal, the body of which in general has the\r\nform of a roundish, oval, or pear-shaped disc, and has on its ventral\r\nside only three pairs of legs. The first of these is uncloven, the two\r\nsubsequent pairs are forked. In front, above the mouth, lies a simple,\r\nsingle eye. Although the different orders of the Crustacean class differ\r\nvery widely from one another in the structure of their body and its\r\nappendages, yet the early Nauplius form always remains essentially the\r\nsame. In order to be convinced of this, let the reader look attentively\r\nat Plates X. and XI., a more detailed explanation of which is given in\r\nthe Appendix. On Plate XI. we see the fully developed representatives of\r\nsix different orders of Crabs, a Leaf-footed Crab (Limnetis, Fig. _A\r\nc_); a Stalked Crab (Lepas, Fig. _D c_); a Root Crab (Sacculina, Fig.\r\n_E c_); a Boatman Crab (Cyclops, Fig. _B c_); a Fish Louse (Lernæocera,\r\nFig. _C c_); and, lastly, a highly developed Shrimp (Peneus, Fig. _F\r\nc_). These six crabs vary very much, as we see, in the entire form of\r\nbody, in the number and formation of the legs, etc. When, however, we\r\nlook at the earliest stages, or “nauplius,” of these six different\r\nclasses, after they have crept out of the egg—those marked with\r\ncorresponding letters on Plate X. (Fig. _A n-F n_)—we shall be surprised\r\nto find how much they agree. The different forms of Nauplius of these\r\nsix orders differ no more from one another than would six different\r\n“good species” of one genus. Consequently, we may with assurance infer a\r\ncommon derivation of all those orders from a common Primæval Crab, which\r\nwas essentially like the Nauplius of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 7 Legions and 20 Orders of Crabs, or Crustacea._\r\n\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------------------------+----------------------+--------------\r\n     _Legions of the_      |     _Orders of the_      |    _Systema  Name_   |  _Name of a_\r\n      _Crustaceæ._         |      _Crustaceæ._        |    _of the Orders._  | _Genus as an_\r\n                           |                          |                      |  _example._\r\n  -------------------------+--------------------------+----------------------+--------------\r\n  I.

Out of the\r\nNauplius form—which originally existed as an independent genus—the five\r\nlegions of lower Crabs developed as diverging branches in different\r\ndirections, which in the systematic survey of the class are united as\r\nSegmented Crabs (Entomostraca). The higher division of Mailed Crabs\r\n(Malacostraca) have likewise originated out of the common Nauplius form.\r\nThe Nebalia is still a direct form of transition from the Phyllopods to\r\nthe Schizopods, that is, to the primary form of the stalk-eyed and\r\nsessile-eyed Mailed Crabs. The Nauplius at this stage gives rise to\r\nanother larva form, the so-called Zoëa, which is of great importance.\r\nThe order of Schizopoda, those with cloven feet (Mysis, etc.), probably\r\noriginated from this curious Zoëa; they are at present still directly\r\nallied, through the Nebalia to the Phyllopoda, those with foliaceous\r\nfeet. But of all living crabs the Phyllopods are the most closely allied\r\nto the original primary form of the Nauplius. Out of the Schizopoda the\r\nstalk-eyed and sessile-eyed Mailed Crabs, or Malacostraca, developed as\r\ntwo diverging branches in different directions: the former through\r\nshrimps (Peneus, etc.), the latter through the Cumacea (Cuma, etc.),\r\nwhich are still living and closely allied to the Schizopoda. Among those\r\nwith stalked eyes is the river crab (cray-fish), the lobster, and the\r\nothers with long tails, or the Macrura, out of which, in the chalk\r\nperiod, the short-tailed crabs, or Brachyura, developed by the\r\ndegeneration of the tail. Those with sessile eyes divide into the two\r\nbranches of Flea-crabs (Amphipoda) and Louse-crabs (Isopoda); among the\r\nlatter are our common Rock-slaters and Wood-lice.\r\n\r\nThe second main-class of Articulated animals, that of the Tracheata, or\r\nair-breathing Tracheate Insects[4] (Spiders, Centipedes, and Flies) did\r\nnot develop until the beginning of the palæolithic era, after the close\r\nof the archilithic period, because all these animals (in contrast with\r\nthe aquatic crabs) are originally inhabitants of land. It is evident\r\nthat the Tracheata can have developed only after the lapse of the\r\nSilurian period when terrestrial life first began. But as fossil remains\r\nof spiders and insects have been found, even in the carboniferous beds,\r\nwe can pretty accurately determine the time of their origin. The\r\ndevelopment of the first Tracheate Insects out of gill-bearing\r\nZoëa-crabs, must have taken place between the end of the Silurian and\r\nthe beginning of the coal period, that is, in the Devonian period.\r\n\r\nGegenbaur, in his excellent “Outlines of Comparative Anatomy,”(21) has\r\nlately endeavoured to explain the origin of the Tracheata by an\r\ningenious hypothesis. The system of tracheæ, or air pipes, and the\r\nmodifications of organization dependent upon it, distinguish Flies,\r\nCentipedes, and Spiders so much from other animals, that the conception\r\nof its first origin presents no inconsiderable difficulties to\r\nphylogeny. According to Gegenbaur, of all living Tracheate Insects, the\r\nPrimæval Flies, or Archiptera, are most closely allied to the common\r\nprimary form of the Tracheata. These insects—among which we may\r\nespecially mention the delicate Day flies (Ephemera), and the agile\r\ndragon-flies (Libellula)—in their earliest youth, as larvæ, frequently\r\npossess _external tracheate gills_ which lie in two rows on the back of\r\nthe body, and are shaped like a leaf or paint-brush. Similar leaf or\r\npaint-brush shaped organs are met with as real water-breathing organs or\r\ngills, in many crabs and ringed worms, and, moreover, in the latter as\r\nreal dorsal appendages or limbs. The “tracheate gills,” found in the\r\nlarvæ of many primæval winged insects, must in all probability be\r\nexplained as “_dorsal limbs_,” and as having developed out of the\r\ncorresponding appendages of the Annelida, or possibly as having really\r\narisen out of similar parts in Crustacea long since extinct. The present\r\ntracheal respiration of the Tracheata developed at a later period out of\r\nrespiration through the “tracheate gills.” The tracheate gills\r\nthemselves, however, have in some cases disappeared, and in others\r\nbecome transformed into the _wings_ of the Flies. They have disappeared\r\nentirely in the classes of Spiders and Centipedes, and these groups must\r\naccordingly be conceived of as degenerated or peculiarly developed\r\nlateral branches of the Fly class, which at an early period branched off\r\nfrom the common primary form of Flies; Spiders probably did so at an\r\nearlier period than Centipedes. Whether that common primary form of all\r\nTracheata, which in my General Morphology I have named Protracheata, did\r\ndevelop directly out of genuine Ringed worms, or at first out of\r\nCrustacea of the Zoëa form (Zoëpoda, p. 177) will probably be settled at\r\nsome future time by a more accurate knowledge and comparison of the\r\nontogeny of the Tracheata, Crustacea, and Annelida. However, the root of\r\nthe Tracheata, as well as that of the Crustacea, must in any case be\r\nlooked for in the group of Ringed worms.\r\n\r\nThe genuine Spiders (Arachnida) are distinguished from Flies by the\r\nabsence of wings, and by four pairs of legs; but, as is distinctly seen\r\nin the Scorpion-spiders and Tarantulæ, they, like Flies, possess in\r\nreality only three pairs of genuine legs. The apparent “fourth pair of\r\nlegs” in spiders (the foremost) are in reality a pair of feelers. Among\r\nthe still existing Spiders, there is a small group which is probably\r\nvery closely allied to the common primary form of the whole class; this\r\nis the order of Scorpion-spiders, or Solifugæ, (Solpuga, Galeodes), of\r\nwhich several large species live in Africa and Asia, and are dreaded on\r\naccount of their poisonous bite. Their body consists—as we suppose to\r\nhave been the case in the common ancestor of the Tracheata—of a head\r\npossessing several pairs of feelers like legs, of a thorax, to the three\r\nrings of which are attached three pairs of legs, and of a hinder body,\r\nor abdomen, consisting of many distinct rings. In the articulation of\r\ntheir body, the Solifugæ are therefore in reality more closely related\r\nto flies than to other spiders. Out of the Devonian Primæval Spiders,\r\nwhich were nearly related to the Solifugæ of the present day, the Long\r\nSpiders, the Tailor Spiders, and the Round Spiders probably developed as\r\nthree diverging branches.\r\n\r\nThe _Long Spiders_ (Arthrogastres), in which the earlier articulation of\r\nbody has been better preserved than in Round Spiders, appear to be the\r\nolder and more original forms. The most important members of this\r\nsub-class are the scorpions, which are connected with the Solifugæ\r\nthrough the Tarantella (or Phrynidæ). The small book scorpions, which\r\ninhabit our libraries and herbariums, appear as a degenerate lateral\r\nbranch from the true scorpions. Midway between the Scorpions and Round\r\nSpiders are the long-legged Tailor-spiders (Opiliones) which have\r\npossibly arisen out of a special branch of the Solifugæ. The\r\nPycnogonida, or No-body Crabs, and the Arctisca, or Bear Worms—still\r\ngenerally included among Long Spiders—must be completely excluded from\r\nthe class of Spiders; the former belong to the Crustacea, the latter to\r\nRinged worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 3 Classes and 17 Orders of the Tracheata._\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------------------+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  _Classes of the_  | _Sub-Classes of the_|   _Order of the_     |   _Two Names of_\r\n    _Tracheata._    |     _Tracheata._    |     _Tracheata._     |_Genera as examples._\r\n  ------------------+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n                    {                     {  1.

The second\r\nsub-class of the Arachnida, the _Round Spiders_ (Sphærogastres), first\r\nappear in the fossil state in the Jura, that is, at a very much later\r\nperiod. They have developed out of a branch of the Solifuga, by the\r\nrings of the body becoming more and more united with one another. In the\r\ntrue _Spinning Spiders_ (Araneæ), which we admire on account of their\r\ndelicate skill in weaving, the union of the joints of the trunk, or\r\nmetamera, goes so far, that the trunk now consists of only two pieces,\r\nof a head-breast (cephalo-thorax) with jaws, feelers, and four pairs of\r\nlegs, and of a hinder body without appendages, where the spinning warts\r\nare placed. In _Mites_ (Acarida), which have probably arisen by\r\ndegeneration (especially by parasitism) out of a lateral branch of\r\nSpinning Spiders, even these two trunk pieces have become united and now\r\nform an unsegmented mass.\r\n\r\nThe class of _Scolopendria_, _Myriapoda_, or Centipedes, the smallest\r\nand poorest in forms of the four classes of Arthropoda, is characterized\r\nby a very elongated body, like that of a segmented Ringed worm, and\r\noften possesses more than a hundred pairs of legs. But these animals\r\nalso originally developed out of a six-legged form of Tracheata, as is\r\ndistinctly proved by the individual development of the millipede in the\r\negg. Their embryos have at first only three pairs of legs, like genuine\r\ninsects, and only at a later period do the posterior pairs of legs bud,\r\none by one, from the growing rings of the hinder body. Of the two orders\r\nof Centipedes (which in our country live under barks of trees, in moss,\r\netc.) the round, _double-footed_ ones (Diplopoda) probably did not\r\ndevelop until a later period out of the older flat, _single-footed_ ones\r\n(Chilopoda), by successive pairs of rings of the body uniting together.\r\nFossil remains of the Chilopoda are first met with in the Jura period.\r\n\r\nThe third and last class of the Arthropoda breathing through tracheæ, is\r\nthat of the _Flies_, or _Insects_, in the narrow sense of the word\r\n(Insecta, or Hexapoda), the largest of all classes of animals, and next\r\nto that of Mammalia, also the most important. Although Flies develop a\r\ngreater variety of genera and species than all other animals taken\r\ntogether, yet these are all in reality only superficial variations of a\r\nsingle type, which is entirely and constantly preserved in its essential\r\ncharacteristics. In all Flies the three divisions of the trunk—head,\r\nbreast (thorax), and hinder body are quite distinct. The _hinder body_,\r\nor _abdomen_, as in the case of spiders, has no articulated appendages.\r\nThe central division, the _breast_ or _thorax_, has on its ventral side\r\nthree pairs of legs, on its back _two pairs of wings_. It is true that,\r\nin very many Flies, one or both pairs of wings have become reduced in\r\nsize or have even entirely disappeared; but the comparative anatomy of\r\nFlies distinctly shows that this deficiency has arisen only gradually by\r\nthe degeneration of the wings, and that all the Flies existing at\r\npresent are derived from a common, primary Fly, which possessed three\r\npairs of legs and two pairs of wings. (Compare p. 256.) These wings,\r\nwhich so strikingly distinguish Flies from all other Arthropoda,\r\nprobably arose, as has been already shown, out of the tracheate gills\r\nwhich may still be observed in the larvæ of the ephemeral flies\r\n(Ephemera) which live in water.\r\n\r\nThe head of Flies universally possesses, besides the eyes, a pair of\r\narticulated feelers, or antennæ, and also three jaws upon each side of\r\nthe mouth. These _three pairs of jaws_, although they have arisen in all\r\nFlies from the same original basis, by different kinds of adaptation,\r\nhave become changed to very varied and remarkable forms in the various\r\norders, and are therefore employed for distinguishing and characterizing\r\nthe main divisions of the class. In the first place, we may distinguish\r\ntwo main divisions, namely, Flies with _chewing_ mandibles (Masticantia)\r\nand Flies with _sucking_ mouths (Sugentia). On a closer examination each\r\nof these two divisions may again be divided into two sub-groups. Among\r\nchewing Flies, or Masticantia, we may distinguish the biting and the\r\nlicking ones. _Biting flies_ (Mordentia) comprise the most ancient and\r\nprimæval winged Flies, the gauzy-winged (Neuroptera), straight-winged\r\n(Orthoptera), and beetles (Coleoptera). _Licking flies_ (Lambentia) are\r\nrepresented by the one order of skin-winged (Hymenoptera) Flies. We\r\ndistinguish two groups of _Sucking Flies_, or Sugentia, namely, those\r\nwhich prick and those which sip. There are two orders of pricking Flies\r\n(Pungentia), those with half wings (Hemiptera) and gnats and blow-flies\r\n(Diptera); butterflies are the only _sipping_ Flies (Sorbentia),\r\nLepidoptera.\r\n\r\nBiting Flies, and indeed the order of _Primæval Flies_ (Archiptera, or\r\nPseudoneuroptera) are nearest akin to the still living Flies, and\r\ninclude the most ancient of all Flies, the primary forms of the whole\r\nclass (hence also those of all Tracheata). Among them are, first of all,\r\nthe Ephemeral Flies (Ephemera) whose larvæ which live in water, in all\r\nprobability still show us in their tracheæ-gills the organs out of which\r\nthe wings of Flies were originally developed. This order further\r\ncontains the well known dragon-flies, or Libellula, the wine-glass sugar\r\nmites (Lepisma), the hopping Flies with bladder-like feet (Physopoda),\r\nand the dreaded Termites, fossil remains of which are found even in\r\ncoal. The order of Gauze-winged Flies (Neuroptera), probably developed\r\ndirectly out of the primæval Flies, which differ from them only by their\r\nperfect series of transformations. Among them are the gauze-flies\r\n(Planipennia), caddis-flies (Phryganida), and fan-flies (Strepsiptera).\r\nFossil Flies, which form the transition from the primæval Flies\r\n(Libellula) to the gauze-winged (Sialidæ), are found even in coal\r\n(Dictyophylebia).\r\n\r\nThe order of _Straight-winged Flies_ (Orthoptera) developed at an early\r\nperiod out of another branch of the primæval Flies by differentiation of\r\nthe two pairs of wings. This division is composed of one group with a\r\ngreat variety of forms—cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets, etc.\r\n(Ulonata)—and of a smaller group consisting only of the well-known\r\nearwigs (Labidura), which are characterised by nippers at the hinder end\r\nof their bodies. Fossil remains of cockroaches, as well as of crickets\r\nand grasshoppers, have been found in coal.\r\n\r\nFossil remains of the fourth order of Biting Flies, _beetles_\r\n(Coleoptera) likewise occur in coal. This extremely comprehensive\r\norder—the favourite one of amateurs and collectors—shows more clearly\r\nthan any other what infinite variety of forms can be developed\r\nexternally by adaptation to different conditions of life, without the\r\ninternal structure and the original form of the body being in any way\r\nessentially changed. Beetles have probably developed out of a branch of\r\nthe straight-winged Flies, from which they differ only in their\r\ntransformations (larva, pupa, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe one order of _Licking Flies_, namely, the interesting group of the\r\n_Bees_, or _Skin-winged Flies_ (Hymenoptera), is closely allied to the\r\nfour orders of biting Flies. Among them are those Flies which have risen\r\nto such an astonishing degree of mental development, of intellectual\r\nperfection, and strength of character, by their extensive division of\r\nlabour, formation of communities and states, and surpass in this not\r\nmerely most invertebrate animals, but even most animals in general. This\r\nmay be said especially of all ants and bees, also of wasps, leaf-wasps,\r\nwood-wasps, gall-wasps, etc. They are first met with in a fossil state\r\nin the oolites, but they do not appear in greater numbers until the\r\ntertiary period. Probably these insects developed either out of a branch\r\nof the primæval Flies or the gauze-winged Flies.\r\n\r\nOf the two orders of _Pricking Flies_ (Hemiptera and Diptera), that\r\ncontaining the _Half-winged Flies_ (Hemiptera), also called Beaked Flies\r\n(Rhynchota), is the older of the two. It includes three sub-orders,\r\nviz., the leaf-lice (Homoptera), the bugs (Heteroptera), and lice\r\n(Pediculina). Fossil remains of the first two classes are found in the\r\noolites; but an ancient Fly (Eugereon) is found in the Permian system,\r\nand seems to indicate the derivation of the Hemiptera from the\r\nNeuroptera. Probably the most ancient of the three sub-orders of the\r\nHemiptera are the Homoptera, among which, besides the actual leaf-lice,\r\nare the shield-lice, leaf-fleas, and leaf-crickets, or Cicadæ. Lice have\r\nprobably developed out of two different branches of Homoptera, by\r\ncontinued degeneration (especially by the loss of wings); bugs, on the\r\nother hand, by the perfecting and differentiation of the two pairs of\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe second order of _pricking flies_, namely, the _Two-winged Flies_\r\n(Diptera), are also found in a fossil state in the oolites, together\r\nwith Half-winged Flies; but they probably developed out of the Hemiptera\r\nby the degeneration of the hind wings. In Diptera the fore wings alone\r\nhave remained perfect. The principal portion of this order consists of\r\nthe elongated gnats (Nemocera) and of the compact blow-flies and\r\nhouse-flies (Brachycera), the former of which are probably the older of\r\nthe two. However, remains of both are found in the oolitic period. The\r\ntwo small groups of lice-flies (Pupipara) forming chrysales, and the\r\nhopping-fleas (Aphaniptera), probably developed out of the Diptera by\r\ndegeneration resulting from parasitism.\r\n\r\nThe eighth and last order of Flies, and at the same time the only one\r\nwith mouth-parts adapted to sipping liquids, consists of _moths_ and\r\n_butterflies_ (Lepidoptera). This order appears, in several\r\nmorphological respects, to be the most perfect class of Flies, and\r\naccordingly was the last to develop. For we only know of fossil remains\r\nof this order from the tertiary period, whereas the three preceding\r\norders extend back to the oolites, and the four biting orders even to\r\nthe coal period. The close relationship between some moths (Tineæ) and\r\n(Noctuæ), and some caddis-flies (Phryganida) renders it probable that\r\nbutterflies have developed from this group, that is, out of the order of\r\nGauze-winged Flies, or Neuroptera.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of Flies, and, moreover, the history of the whole\r\ntribe of Arthropoda, essentially confirms the great laws of\r\ndifferentiation and perfecting which, according to Darwin’s theory of\r\nselection, must be considered as the necessary results of Natural\r\nSelection. The whole tribe, so rich in forms, begins in the Archilithic\r\nperiod with the class of _Crabs_ breathing by gills, and with the lowest\r\n_Primæval Crabs_, or Archicaridæ. The form of these Primæval Crabs,\r\nwhich were developed out of segmented worms, is still approximately\r\npreserved by the remarkable _Nauplius_, in the common larval stage of so\r\nmany Crabs. Out of the Nauplius, at a later period, the curious Zoëa was\r\ndeveloped, which is the common larval form of all the higher or mailed\r\ncrabs (Malacostraca), and, at the same time, possibly of that Arthopod\r\nwhich at first breathed through tracheæ, and became the common ancestor\r\nof all _Tracheata_. This Devonian ancestor, which must have originated\r\nbetween the end of the Silurian and the beginning of the Coal period,\r\nwas probably most closely related to the still living Primæval Flies, or\r\n_Archiptera_. Out of these there developed, as the main tribe of the\r\nTracheata, the class of Flies, from the lowest stage of which the\r\n_spiders_ and _centipedes_ separated as two diverging branches.\r\nThroughout a long period there existed only the four biting orders of\r\nFlies—the Primæval flies, Gauze-wings, Straight-wings, and the Beetles,\r\nthe first of which is probably the common primary form of the three\r\nothers. It was only at a much later period that the Licking, Pricking,\r\nand Sipping flies developed out of the Biting ones, which retained the\r\noriginal form of the three pairs of jaws most distinctly. The following\r\ntable will show once more how these orders succeeded one another in the\r\nhistory of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF FLIES.\r\n\r\n                    {                 { 1.

VERTEBRATE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Records of the Creation of Vertebrate Animals (Comparative\r\n  Anatomy, Embryology, and Palæontology).—The Natural System of\r\n  Vertebrate Animals.—The Four Classes of Vertebrate Animals,\r\n  according to Linnæus and Lamarck.—Their increase to Nine\r\n  Classes.—Main Class of the Tube-hearted, or Skull-less Animals\r\n  (the Lancelet).—Blood Relationship between the Skull-less Fish\r\n  and the Tunicates.—Agreement in the Embryological Development\r\n  of Amphioxus and Ascidiæ.—Origin of the Vertebrate Tribe out of\r\n  the Worm Tribe.—Main Class of Single-nostriled, or\r\n  Round-mouthed Animals (Hag and Lampreys).—Main Class of\r\n  Anamnionate Animals, devoid of Amnion.—Fishes (Primæval Fish,\r\n  Cartilaginous Fish, Osseous Fish).—Mud-fish, or Dipneusta.—Sea\r\n  Dragons, or Halisauria.—Frogs and Salamanders, or Amphibia\r\n  (Mailed Amphibia, Naked Amphibia).—Main Class of Amnionate\r\n  Animals, or Amniota.—Reptiles (Primary Reptiles, Lizards,\r\n  Serpents, Crocodiles, Tortoises, Flying-Reptiles, Dragons,\r\n  Beaked Reptiles).—Birds (Feather-tailed, Fan-tailed,\r\n  Bush-tailed).\r\n\r\n\r\nNot one of the natural groups of organisms—which, we have designated as\r\ntribes, or phyla, on account of the blood-relationship of all the\r\nspecies included in them—is of such great and exceeding importance as\r\nthe tribe of Vertebrate Animals. For, according to the unanimous opinion\r\nof all zoologists, man also is a member of the tribe; and his whole\r\norganization and development cannot possibly be distinguished from that\r\nof other Vertebrate animals. But as from the individual history of\r\nhuman development, we have already recognized the undeniable fact that,\r\nin developing out of the egg, man at first does not differ from other\r\nVertebrate animals, and especially from Mammals, we must necessarily\r\ncome to the conclusion, in regard to the palæontological history of his\r\ndevelopment, that man has, historically, actually developed out of the\r\nlower Vertebrata, and that he is directly derived from lower mammals.\r\nThis circumstance, together with the many high interests which, in other\r\nrespects, entitle the Vertebrata to more consideration than other\r\norganisms, justifies us in examining the pedigree of the Vertebrata and\r\nits expression in the natural system, with special care.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the records of creation, which must in all cases be our\r\nguide in establishing pedigrees, are especially complete in this\r\nimportant animal tribe, from which our own race has arisen. Even at the\r\nbeginning of our century Cuvier’s comparative anatomy and palæontology,\r\nand Bär’s ontogeny of the Vertebrate animals, had brought us to a high\r\nlevel of accurate knowledge on this matter. Since then it is especially\r\ndue to Johannes Müller’s and Rathke’s investigations in comparative\r\nanatomy, and most recently to those of Gegenbaur and Huxley, that our\r\nknowledge of the natural relationships among the different groups of\r\nVertebrata has become enlarged. It is especially Gegenbaur’s classical\r\nworks, penetrated as they are throughout with the fundamental principles\r\nof the Theory of Descent, which have demonstrated that the material of\r\ncomparative anatomy receives its true importance and value only by the\r\napplication of the Theory of Descent, and this in the case of all\r\nanimals, but especially in that in the Vertebrate tribe. Here, as\r\neverywhere else, analogies must be traced to Adaptation, homologies to\r\nTransmission by Inheritance. When we see that the limbs of the most\r\ndifferent Vertebrata, in spite of their exceedingly different external\r\nforms, nevertheless possess essentially the same internal structure;\r\nwhen we see that in the arm of a man and ape, in the wing of a man or a\r\nbird, in the breast fins of whales and sea-dragons, in the fore-legs of\r\nhoofed animals and frogs, the same bones always lie in the same\r\ncharacteristic position, articulation and connection—we can only explain\r\nthis wonderful agreement and homology by the supposition of a common\r\ntransmission by inheritance from a single primary form. On the other\r\nhand, the striking differences of these homologous bodily parts proceed\r\nfrom adaptation to different conditions of existence. (Compare Plate\r\nIV.)\r\n\r\nOntogeny, or the individual history of development, like comparative\r\nanatomy, is of especial importance to the pedigree of the Vertebrata.\r\nThe first stages of development arising out of the egg are essentially\r\nidentical in all Vertebrate animals, and retain their agreement the\r\nlonger, the nearer the respective Vertebrate animal forms, when fully\r\ndeveloped, stand to one another in the natural system, that is, in the\r\npedigree. How far this agreement of germ forms, or embryos, extends,\r\neven in the most highly developed Vertebrate animals, I have already had\r\noccasion to explain (vol i. pp. 306-309). The complete agreement in form\r\nand structure, for example, in the embryos of a man and a dog, of a bird\r\nand a tortoise, existing in the stages of development represented on\r\nPlates II. and III., is a fact of incalculable importance, and furnishes\r\nus with the most important data for the construction of their pedigree.\r\n\r\nFinally, the palæontological records of creation are also of especial\r\nvalue in the case of these same Vertebrate animals; for their fossil\r\nremains belong for the most part to the bony skeleton, a system of\r\norgans which is of the utmost importance for understanding their general\r\norganization. It is true that here, as in all other cases, the fossil\r\nrecords are exceedingly imperfect and incomplete, but more important\r\nremains of extinct Vertebrate animals have been preserved in a fossil\r\nstate, than of most other groups of animals; and single fragments\r\nfrequently furnish the most important hints as to the relationship and\r\nthe historical succession of the groups.\r\n\r\nThe name of _Vertebrate Animals_ (Vertebrata), as I have already said,\r\noriginated with the great Lamarck, who towards the end of the last\r\ncentury comprised under this name, Linnæus’ four higher classes of\r\nanimals, viz. Mammals, Birds, Amphibious animals, and Fishes, Linnæus’\r\ntwo lower classes, Insects and Worms, Lamarck contrasted to the\r\nVertebrata as _Invertebrata_, later also called _Evertebrata_.\r\n\r\nThe division of the Vertebrata into the four classes above named was\r\nretained also by Cuvier and his followers, and in consequence by many\r\nzoologists down to the present day. But in 1822 Blanville, the\r\ndistinguished anatomist, found out by comparative anatomy—which Bär did\r\nalmost at the same time from the ontogeny of Vertebrata—that Linnæus’\r\nclass of Amphibious animals was an unnatural union of two very different\r\nclasses. These two classes were separated as early as 1820, by Merrin,\r\nas two main groups of Amphibious animals, under the names of Pholidota\r\nand Batrachia. The _Batrachia_, which are at present (in a restricted\r\nsense) called Amphibious animals, comprise Frogs, Salamanders, gilled\r\nSalamanders, Cæcilia, and the extinct Labyrinthodonta. Their entire\r\norganization is closely allied to that of Fishes. The _Pholidota_, or\r\nReptiles, on the other hand, are much more closely allied to Birds. They\r\ncomprise lizards, serpents, crocodiles, and tortoises, and the groups of\r\nthe mesolithic Dragons, Flying reptiles, etc.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this natural division of Amphibious animals into two\r\nclasses, the whole tribe of Vertebrate animals was divided into two main\r\ngroups. The first main group, containing Amphibious animals and Fishes,\r\nbreathe throughout their lives, or in early life, by means of gills, and\r\nare therefore called _gilled Vertebrata_ (Branchiata, or Anallantoida).\r\nThe second main group—Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals—breathe at no period\r\nof their lives through gills, but exclusively through lungs, and hence\r\nmay appropriately be called Gill-less, or _Vertebrata with lungs_\r\n(Abranchiata, or Allantoida). However correct this distinction may be,\r\nstill we cannot remain satisfied with it if we wish to arrive at a true\r\nnatural system of the vertebrate tribe, and at a right understanding of\r\nits pedigree. In this case, as I have shown in my General Morphology, we\r\nare obliged to distinguish three other classes of Vertebrate animals, by\r\ndividing what has hitherto been regarded as the class of fishes into\r\nfour distinct classes. (Gen. Morph. vol. ii. Plate VII. pp. 116-160.)\r\n\r\nThe first and lowest of these classes comprises the _Skull-less_ animals\r\n(Acrania), or animals with _tubular hearts_ (Leptocardia), of which only\r\none representative now exists, namely, the remarkable little Lancelet\r\n(Amphioxus lanceolatus). Nearly allied to this is the second class, that\r\nof the _Single-nostriled_ animals (Monorrhina), or _Round-mouthed_\r\nanimals (Cyclostoma), which includes the Hags (Myxinoida) and Lampreys\r\n(Petromyzonta). The third class contains only the genuine Fish (Pisces):\r\nthe Mud-fishes (Dipneusta) are added to these as a fourth class, and\r\nform the transition from Fish to Amphibious animals. This distinction,\r\nwhich, as will be seen immediately, is very important for the genealogy\r\nof the Vertebrate animals, increases the original number of Vertebrate\r\nclasses from four to eight.\r\n\r\nIn most recent times a ninth class of Vertebrata has been added to these\r\neight classes. Gegenbaur’s recently published investigations in\r\ncomparative anatomy prove that the remarkable class of _Sea-dragons_\r\n(Halisauria), which have hitherto been included among Reptiles, must be\r\nconsidered quite distinct from these, and as a separate class which\r\nbranched off from the Vertebrate stock, even before the Amphibious\r\nanimals. To it belong the celebrated large Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri\r\nof the oolitic and chalk periods, and the older Simosauri of the Trias\r\nperiod, all of which are more closely allied to Fish than to Amphibious\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThese nine classes of Vertebrate animals are, however, by no means of\r\nthe same genealogical value. Hence we must divide them, as I have\r\nalready shown in the Systematic Survey on p. 133, into four distinct\r\nmain-classes or tribes. In the first place, the three highest classes,\r\nMammals, Birds, and Reptiles, may be comprised as a natural main-class\r\nunder the name of _Amnion animals_ (Amnionata). The _Amnion-less\r\nanimals_ (Anamnionata), naturally opposed to them as a second\r\nmain-class, include the four classes of Batrachians, Sea-dragons,\r\nMud-fish, and Fishes. The seven classes just named, the Anamnionata as\r\nwell as the Amnionata, agree among one another in numerous\r\ncharacteristics, which distinguish them from the two lowest classes\r\n(the single-nostriled and tubular-hearted animals). Hence we may unite\r\nthem in the natural main group of _Double-nostriled_ animals\r\n(Amphirrhina). Finally, these Amphirrhina on the whole are much more\r\nclosely related to those animals with round mouths or single nostrils\r\nthan to the skull-less or tube-hearted animals. We may, therefore, with\r\nfull justice class the single and double-nostriled animals into one\r\nprincipal main group, and contrast them as _animals with skulls_\r\n(Craniota), or _bulbular hearts_ (Pachycardia), to the one class of\r\n_skull-less animals_, or animals with _tubular hearts_. This\r\nclassification of the Vertebrate animals proposed by me renders it\r\npossible to obtain a clear survey of the nine classes in their most\r\nimportant genealogical relations. The systematic relationship of these\r\ngroups to one another may be briefly expressed by the following table.\r\n\r\n\r\n          A.\r\n  =Skull-less Animals=                                     1.

Mammals        9. Mammalia\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only one representative of the first class, the small _lanceolate\r\nfish_, or Lancelet (Amphioxus lanceolatus) (Plate XIII. Fig. _B_),\r\nstands at the lowest stage of organization of all the Vertebrate\r\nanimals known to us. This exceedingly interesting and important animal,\r\nwhich throws a surprising light upon the older roots of our pedigree, is\r\nevidently the last of the Mohicans—the last surviving representative of\r\na lower class of Vertebrate animals, very rich in forms, and very highly\r\ndeveloped during the primordial period, but which unfortunately could\r\nleave no fossil remains on account of the absence of all solid skeleton.\r\nThe Lancelet still lives widely distributed in different seas; for\r\ninstance, in the Baltic, North Sea, and Mediterranean, where it\r\ngenerally lies buried in the sand on flat shores. The body, as the name\r\nindicates, has the form of a narrow lanceolate leaf, pointed at both\r\nextremities. When full grown it is about two inches long, of a white\r\ncolour and semi-transparent. Externally, the little lanceolate animal is\r\nso little like a vertebrate animal that Pallas, who first discovered it,\r\nregarded it as an imperfect naked snail. It has no legs, and neither\r\nhead, skull, nor brain. Externally, the fore end of the body can be\r\ndistinguished from the hinder end only by the open mouth. But still the\r\nAmphioxus in its internal structure possesses those most important\r\nfeatures, which distinguish all Vertebrate animals from all Invertebrate\r\nanimals, namely, the spinal rod and spinal marrow. The _spinal rod_\r\n(Chorda dorsalis) is a straight, cylindrical, cartilaginous staff,\r\npointed at both ends, forming the central axis of the internal skeleton,\r\nand the basis of the vertebral column. Directly above the spinal rod, on\r\nits dorsal side, lies the _spinal marrow_ (medulla spinalis), likewise\r\noriginally a straight but internally hollow cord, pointed at both ends.\r\nThis forms the principal piece and centre of the nervous system in all\r\nVertebrate animals. (Compare above vol. i. p. 303.) In all Vertebrate\r\nanimals without exception, man included, these important parts of the\r\nbody during the embryological development out of the egg, originally\r\nbegin in the same simple form, which is retained throughout life by the\r\nAmphioxus. It is only at a later period that the brain develops by the\r\nexpansion of the fore end of the spinal marrow, and out of the spinal\r\nrod the skull which encloses the brain. As these two important organs do\r\nnot develop at all in the Amphioxus, we may justly call the class\r\nrepresented by it, _Skull-less animals_ (Acrania), in opposition to all\r\nthe others, namely, to the _animals with skulls_ (Craniota). The\r\nSkull-less animals are generally called _tubular-hearted_ (Leptocardia),\r\nbecause a centralized heart does not as yet exist, and the blood is\r\ncirculated in the body by the contractions of the tubular blood-vessels\r\nthemselves. The Skulled animals, which possess a centralized,\r\nthick-walled, bulb-shaped heart, ought then by way of contrast to be\r\ncalled _bulbular-hearted_ animals (Pachycardia).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ascidia (A.) and Amphioxus (B.)_ Pl. XII.\r\n\r\n  E. Haeckel del.       Legesse sc.]\r\n\r\nAnimals with skulls and central hearts evidently developed gradually in\r\nthe later primordial period out of those without skulls and with tubular\r\nhearts. Of this the ontogeny of skulled animals leaves no doubt. But\r\nwhence are these same skull-less animals derived? It is only very lately\r\nthat an exceedingly surprising answer has been given to this important\r\nquestion. From Kowalewsky’s investigations, published in 1867, on the\r\nindividual development of the Amphioxus and the adhering Sea-squirts\r\n(Ascidia) belonging to the class of mantled animals (Tunicata), it has\r\nbeen proved that the ontogenies of these two entirely different looking\r\nanimal-forms agree in the first stage of development in a most\r\nremarkable manner. The freely swimming larvæ of the Ascidians (Plate\r\nXII. Fig. _A_) develop the undeniable beginning of a spinal marrow (Fig.\r\n5 _g_) and of a spinal rod (Fig. 5 _c_), and this moreover in entirely\r\nthe same way as does the Amphioxus. (Plate XIII. Fig. _B_.) It is true\r\nthat in the Ascidians these most important organs of the Vertebrate\r\nanimal-body do not afterwards develop further. The Ascidians take on a\r\nretrograde transformation, become attached to the bottom of the sea, and\r\ndevelop into shapeless lumps, which when looked upon externally would\r\nscarcely be supposed to be animals. (Plate XIII. Fig. _A_.) But the\r\nspinal marrow, as the beginning of the central nervous system, and the\r\nspinal rod, as the first basis of the vertebral column, are such\r\nimportant organs, so exclusively characteristic of Vertebrate animals,\r\nthat we may from them with certitude infer the true blood relationship\r\nof Vertebrate with Tunicate animals. Of course we do not mean to say by\r\nthis, that Vertebrate animals are derived from Tunicate animals, but\r\nmerely that both groups have arisen out of a common root, and that the\r\nTunicates, of all the Invertebrata, are the nearest blood relations of\r\nthe Vertebrates. It is quite evident that genuine Vertebrate animals\r\ndeveloped progressively during the primordial period (and the skull-less\r\nanimals first) out of a group of worms, from which the degenerate\r\nTunicate animals arose in another and a retrograde direction. (Compare\r\nthe more detailed explanation of Plates XII. and XIII. in the Appendix.)\r\n\r\nOut of the Skull-less animals there developed, in the first instance, a\r\nsecond low class of Vertebrate animals, which still stands far below\r\nthat of fish, and which is now represented only by the Hags (Myxinoida)\r\nand Lampreys (Petromyzonta). This class also, on account of the absence\r\nof all solid parts, could, unfortunately, as little as the Skull-less\r\nanimals leave fossil remains. From its whole organization and ontogeny\r\nit is quite evident that it represents a very important intermediate\r\nstage between the Skull-less animals and Fishes, and that its few still\r\nexisting members are only the last surviving remains of a probably very\r\nhighly developed animal group which existed towards the end of the\r\nprimordial period. On account of the curious mouth possessed by the Hags\r\nand Lampreys, which they use for sucking, the whole class is usually\r\ncalled _Round-mouthed_ animals (Cyclostoma). The name of\r\n_Single-nostriled_ animals (Monorrhina) is still more characteristic.\r\nFor all Cyclostoma possess a simple, single nasal tube, whereas, in all\r\nother Vertebrate animals (with the exception of the Amphioxus) the nose\r\nconsists of two lateral halves, a right and a left nostril. We are\r\ntherefore enabled to comprise these latter (Anamnionata and Amnionata)\r\nunder the heading, _double-nostriled_ animals (Amphirrhina). All the\r\nAmphirrhina possess a fully developed jaw-skeleton (upper and under\r\njaw), whereas it is completely wanting in the Monorrhina.\r\n\r\nApart also from the peculiar nasal formation, and the absence of jaws,\r\nthe Single-nostriled animals are distinguished from those with double\r\nnostrils by many peculiarities. Thus they want the important sympathetic\r\nnervous system, and the spleen which the Amphirrhina possess. Of the\r\nswimming bladder, and the two pairs of legs—which all double-nostriled\r\nanimals have, at least in their embryonic conditions—not a trace exists\r\nin the Single-nostriled animals, which is the case also in the\r\nSkull-less animals. Hence, we are surely justified in completely\r\nseparating the Monorrhina, as we have separated the Skull-less animals,\r\nfrom the Fishes, with which they have hitherto been erroneously classed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ascidia (A.) and Amphioxus (B.)_ Pl. XIII.\r\n\r\n  E. Haeckel del.        Lagesse sc.]\r\n\r\nWe owe our first accurate knowledge of the Monorrhina, or Cyclostoma, to\r\nthe great zoologist, Johannes Müller of Berlin; his classical work on\r\nthe “Comparative Anatomy of the Myxinoida” forms the foundation of our\r\nmodern views on the structure of the Vertebrate animals. He\r\ndistinguished two distinct groups among the Cyclostoma, which we shall\r\nconsider as sub-classes.\r\n\r\nThe first sub-class consists of the Hags (Hyperotreta, or Myxinoida).\r\nThey live in the sea as parasites upon other fish, into whose skin they\r\npenetrate (Myxine, Bdellostoma). Their organ of hearing has only one\r\nannular canal, and their single nasal tube penetrates the palate. The\r\nsecond sub-class, that of Lampreys, or Prides (Hyperoartia, or\r\nPetromyzontia) is more highly developed. It includes the well-known\r\nLamperns, or Nine-eyes, of our rivers (Petromyzon fluviatilis), with\r\nwhich most persons are acquainted. They are represented in the sea by\r\nthe frequently larger marine or genuine Lampreys (Petromyzon marinus).\r\nThe nasal tube of these single-nostriled animals does not penetrate the\r\npalate, and in the auricular organ there are two annular canals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 4 Main-classes, 9 Classes, and 26 Sub-classes of Vertebrata._\r\n\r\nGen.

One of these\r\npairs of legs sometimes degenerates (as in the case of eels, whales,\r\netc.), or both pairs of legs (as in Cæciliæ and serpents) either\r\ndegenerate or entirely disappear; but even in these cases there exists\r\nsome trace of their original beginning in an early embryonic period, or\r\nthe useless remains of them may be found in the form of rudimentary\r\norgans. (Compare above, vol. i. p. 13.)\r\n\r\nFrom all these important indications we may conclude with full assurance\r\nthat all double-nostriled animals are derived from a single common\r\nprimary form, which developed either directly or indirectly during the\r\nprimordial period out of the Monorrhina. This primary form must have\r\npossessed the organs above mentioned, and also the beginning of a\r\nswimming bladder and of two pairs of legs or fins. It is evident, that\r\nof all still living double-nostriled animals, the lowest forms of sharks\r\nare most closely allied to this long since extinct, unknown, and\r\nhypothetical primary form, which we may call the Primary\r\nDouble-nostriled animals (Proselachii). We may therefore look upon the\r\ngroup of primæval fish, or Selachii, to which the _Proselachii_ probably\r\nbelonged, as a primary group, not only of the Fish class, but of the\r\nwhole main-class of double-nostriled animals.\r\n\r\nThe class of _Fish_ (Pisces) with which we accordingly begin the series\r\nof Double-nostriled animals, is distinguished from the other six classes\r\nof the series by the swimming bladder never developing into lungs, but\r\nacting only as a hydrostatic apparatus. Agreeing with this, we find that\r\nin fish the nose is formed by two blind holes in front of the mouth,\r\nwhich never pierce the palate so as to open into the cavity of the\r\nmouth. In the other six classes of double-nostriled animals, both\r\nnostrils are changed into air passages which pierce the palate, and thus\r\nconduct air to the lungs. Genuine fish (after the exclusion of the\r\nDipneusta) are accordingly the only double-nostriled animals which\r\nexclusively breathe through gills and never through lungs. In accordance\r\nwith this, they all live in water, and both pairs of their legs have\r\nretained the original form of paddling fins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 7 Legions and 15 Orders of the Fishes._\r\n\r\n\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  _Sub-classes_ |      _Legions_     |      _Orders_       |        _Examples_\r\n      _of_      |        _of_        |        _of_         |          _from_\r\n    _Fishes._   |      _Fishes._     |      _Fishes._      |       _the Orders._\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 {\r\n                 {                    {  1.

The oldest of these, where\r\nthe original form has been most faithfully preserved, is that of the\r\n_Primæval fish_ (Selachii). Of these there still exist Sharks (Squali),\r\nand Rays (Rajæ), which are classed together as cross-mouthed fishes\r\n(Plagiostomi), and the strange and grotesquely formed Sea-cats, or\r\n_Chimæracei_ (Holocephali). These primary fish of the present day, which\r\nare met with in all seas, are only poor remains of the prevailing animal\r\ngroups, rich in forms, which the Selachii formed in the earlier periods\r\nof the earth’s history, and especially during the palæolithic period.\r\nUnfortunately all Primæval fish possess a cartilaginous, never a\r\ncompletely osseous skeleton, which is but little, if at all, capable of\r\nbeing petrified. The only hard parts of the body which could be\r\npreserved in a fossil state, are the teeth and fin-spikes. These are\r\nfound in the older formations in such quantities, varieties, and sizes,\r\nthat we may, with certainty, infer a very considerable development of\r\nPrimæval fish in those remote ages. They are even found in the Silurian\r\nstrata, which contain but few remains of other Vertebrata, such as\r\nEnamelled fish (and these only in the most recent part, that is, in the\r\nupper Silurian). By far the most important and interesting of the three\r\norders of Primæval fish are Sharks; of all still living double-nostriled\r\nanimals, they are probably most closely allied to the original primary\r\nform of the whole group, namely, to the Proselachii. Out of these\r\nProselachii, which probably differed but little from genuine Sharks,\r\nEnamelled fish, and the present Primæval fish, in all probability,\r\ndeveloped in one direction, and the Dipneusta, Sea-dragons, and Amphibia\r\nin another.\r\n\r\nThe _Ganoid_, or _Enamelled fish_ (Ganoides), in regard to their anatomy\r\nstand midway between the Primæval and the Osseous fish. In many\r\ncharacteristics they agree with the former, and in many others with the\r\nlatter. Hence, we infer that genealogically they form the transition\r\nfrom Primæval to Osseous fish. The Ganoids are for the most part\r\nextinct, and more nearly so than the Primæval fish, whereas they were\r\ndeveloped in great force during the entire palæolithic and mesolithic\r\nperiods. Ganoid fish are divided into three legions according to the\r\nform of their external covering, namely, Mailed, Angular-scaled, and\r\nRound-scaled. The _Mailed Ganoid fish_ (Tabuliferi) are the oldest, and\r\nare directly allied to the Selachii, out of which they originated.\r\nFossil remains of them, though rare, are found even in the upper\r\nSilurian (Pteraspis ludensis of the Ludlow strata). Gigantic species of\r\nthem, coated with strong bony plates, are found in the Devonian system.\r\nBut of this legion there now lives only the small order of Sturgeons\r\n(Sturiones), including the Spade-sturgeons (Spatularidæ), and those\r\nSturgeons (Accipenseridæ) to which belong, among others, the Huso, which\r\nyields isinglass, or sturgeon’s sound, and the Caviar-sturgeon, whose\r\neggs we eat in the shape of caviar, etc. Out of the mailed Ganoid fish,\r\nthe angular and round-scaled ones probably developed as two diverging\r\nbranches. The _Angular-scaled Ganoid fish_ (Rhombiferi)—which can be\r\ndistinguished at first sight from all other fish by their square or\r\nrhombic scales—are at present represented only by a few survivors,\r\nnamely, the Finny Pike (Polypterus) in African rivers (especially the\r\nNile), and by the Bony Pike (Lepidosteus) in American rivers. Yet during\r\nthe palæolithic and the first half of the mesolithic epochs this legion\r\nformed the most numerous group of fishes. The third legion, that of\r\n_Round-scaled Ganoid fish_ (Cycliferi), was no less rich in forms, and\r\nlived principally during the Devonian and Coal periods. This legion, of\r\nwhich the Bald Pike (Amia), in North American rivers, is the only\r\nsurvivor, was especially important, inasmuch as the third sub-class of\r\nfish, namely, Osseous fish, developed out of it.\r\n\r\n_Osseous fish_ (Teleostei) include the greater portion of the fish of\r\nthe present day. Among these are by far the greater portion of marine\r\nfish, and all of our fresh-water fish except the Ganoid fish just\r\nmentioned. This class is distinctly proved by numerous fossils to have\r\narisen about the middle of the Mesolithic epoch out of Ganoid fish, and\r\nmoreover out of the Round-scaled, or Cycliferi. The Thrissopidæ of the\r\nOolitic period (Thrissops, Leptolepis, Tharsis), which are most closely\r\nallied to the herrings of the present day, are probably the oldest of\r\nall Osseous fish, and have directly arisen out of Round-scaled Ganoid\r\nfish, closely allied to the existing Amia. In the older Osseous fish of\r\nthe legion called _Physostomi_, as also in the Ganoides, the swimming\r\nbladder throughout life was connected with the throat by a permanent air\r\npassage (a kind of windpipe). This is still the case with all the fish\r\nbelonging to this legion, namely, with herrings, salmon, carp, shad,\r\neels, etc. However, during the chalk period this air passage, in some of\r\nthe Physostomi, became constricted and closed, and the swimming bladder\r\nwas thus completely separated from the throat. Hence there arose a\r\nsecond legion of Osseous fish, the _Physoclisti_, which did not attain\r\ntheir actual development until the tertiary epoch, and soon far\r\nsurpassed the Physostomi in variety. To this legion belong most of the\r\nsea fish of the present day, especially the large families of the\r\nTurbot, Tunny, Wrasse, Crowfish, etc., further, the Lock-jaws\r\n(Plectognathi), Trunk fish, and Globe-fish and the Bushy-gills\r\n(Lophobranchi), viz., Pipe-fish, and Sea-horses. There are, however,\r\nonly very few Physoclisti among our river fish, for instance, Perch and\r\nSticklebacks; the majority of river fish are Physostomi.\r\n\r\nMidway between genuine Fish and Amphibia is the remarkable class of\r\n_Mud-fish_, or _Scaly Sirens_ (Dipneusta, or Protopteri). There now\r\nexist only a few representatives of this class, namely, the American\r\nMud-fish (Lepidosiren paradoxa) in the region of the river Amazon, and\r\nthe African Mud-fish (Protopterus annectens) in different parts of\r\nAfrica. A third large Salamander-fish (Ceratodus Fosteri) has lately\r\nbeen discovered in Australia. During the dry season, that is in summer,\r\nthese strange animals bury themselves in a nest of leaves in the dry\r\nmud, and then breathe air through lungs like the Amphibia. But during\r\nthe wet season, in winter, they live in rivers and bogs, and breathe\r\nwater through gills like fish. Externally, they resemble fish of the eel\r\nkind, and are like them covered with scales; in many other\r\ncharacteristics also—in their internal structure, their skeleton,\r\nextremities, etc.—they resemble Fish more than Amphibia. But in certain\r\nfeatures they resemble the Amphibia, especially in the formation of\r\ntheir lungs, nose, and heart. There is consequently an endless dispute\r\namong zoologists, as to whether the Mud-fish are genuine Fish or\r\nAmphibia. Distinguished zoologists have expressed themselves in favour\r\nof both opinions. But in fact, owing to the complete blending of\r\ncharacteristics which they present, they belong neither to the one nor\r\nto the other class, and are probably most correctly dealt with as a\r\nspecial class of Vertebrata, forming the transition between Fishes and\r\nAmphibians. The still living Dipneusta are probably the last surviving\r\nremains of a group which was formerly rich in forms, but has left no\r\nfossil traces on account of the want of a solid skeleton. In this\r\nrespect, these animals are exactly like the Monorrhina and the\r\nLeptocardia. However, teeth are found in the Trias which resemble those\r\nof the living Ceratodus. Possibly the extinct Dipneusta of the\r\npalæolithic period, which developed in the Devonian epoch out of\r\nprimæval fish, must be looked upon as the primary forms of the Amphibia,\r\nand thus also of all higher Vertebrata. At all events the unknown forms\r\nof transition—from Primæval fish to Amphibia—were probably very like the\r\nDipneusta.\r\n\r\nA very peculiar class of Vertebrate animals, long since extinct, and\r\nwhich appears to have lived only during the secondary epoch, is formed\r\nby the remarkable _Sea-dragons_ (Halisauria, or Enaliosauria, also\r\ncalled Nexipoda, or Swimming-footed animals). These formidable animals\r\nof prey inhabited the mesolithic oceans in great numbers, and were of\r\nmost peculiar forms, sometimes from thirty to forty feet in length. From\r\nmany and excellently preserved fossil remains and impressions, both of\r\nthe entire body of Sea-dragons as well as of single parts, we have\r\nbecome very accurately acquainted with the structure of their bodies.\r\nThey are usually classed among Reptiles, whilst some anatomists have\r\nplaced them in a much lower rank, as directly allied to Fish.\r\nGegenbaur’s recently published investigations, which place the structure\r\nof their limbs in a true light, have led to the surprising conclusion\r\nthat the Sea-dragons form quite an isolated group, differing widely both\r\nfrom Reptiles and Amphibia as well as from Fish. The skeleton of their\r\nfour legs, which are transformed into short, broad, paddling fins (like\r\nthose of fish and whales) furnishes us with a clear proof that the\r\nHalisauria branched off from the main-stock of Vertebrata at an earlier\r\nperiod than the Amphibia. For Amphibia, as well as the three higher\r\nclasses of Vertebrata, are all derived from a common primary form, which\r\npossessed only _five_ toes or fingers on each leg. But the Sea-dragons\r\nhave (either distinctly developed or in a rudimentary condition as parts\r\nof the skeleton of the foot) more than five fingers, as have also the\r\nSelachians or Primæval fish. On the other hand, they breathed air\r\nthrough lungs, like the Dipneusta, although they always swam about in\r\nthe sea. They, therefore, perhaps, in conjunction with the Dipneusta,\r\nbranched off from the Selachii, but did not develop into higher\r\nVertebrata; they form an extinct lateral line of the pedigree, which has\r\ndied out.\r\n\r\nThe more accurately known Sea-dragons are classed into three orders,\r\ndistinct enough one from the other, namely, _Primæval Dragons_, _Fish\r\nDragons_, and _Serpent Dragons_. The _Primæval Dragons_ (Simosauria) are\r\nthe oldest Sea-dragons, and lived only during the Trias period. The\r\nskeletons of many different genera of them are met with in the German\r\nlimestone known as “Muschel-kalk.” They seem upon the whole to have been\r\nvery like the Plesiosauria, and are, consequently, sometimes united with\r\nthem into one order as Sauropterygia. The _Serpent Dragons_\r\n(Plesiosauria) lived in the oolitic and chalk periods together with the\r\nIchthyosauria. They were characterised by an uncommonly long thin neck,\r\nwhich was frequently longer than the whole body, and carried a small\r\nhead with a short snout. When their arched neck was raised they must\r\nhave looked very like a swan; but in place of wings and legs they had\r\ntwo pairs of short, flat, oval-paddling fins.\r\n\r\nThe body of the _Fish Dragons_ (Ichthyosauria) was of an entirely\r\ndifferent form; these animals may be opposed to the two preceding orders\r\nunder the name of Fish-finners (Ichthyopterygia). They possessed a very\r\nlong extended body, like a fish, and a heavy head with an elongated,\r\nflat snout, but a very short neck. Externally, they were probably very\r\nlike porpoises. Their tail was very long, whereas it was very short in\r\nthe members of the preceding orders. Also both pairs of paddling fins\r\nare broader and show very different structure from that seen in the\r\nother two orders. Probably the Fish Dragons and Serpent Dragons\r\ndeveloped as two diverging branches out of the Primæval Dragons; but it\r\nis also possible that the Plesiosauria alone originated out of the\r\nSimosauria, and that the Ichthyosauria were lower off-shoots from the\r\ncommon stock. At all events, they must all be directly, or indirectly\r\nderived from the Selachii, or Primæval fish.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding classes of Vertebrata, the _Amphibia_ and the _Amniota_\r\n(Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals), owing to the characteristic structure\r\nwhich they all exhibit of five toes to each foot, may all be derived\r\nfrom a common primary form, which originated from the Selachii, and\r\nwhich possessed five toes on each of its four limbs. When we find a less\r\nnumber of toes than five, we can show that the missing ones must have\r\nbeen lost in the course of time by adaptation. The oldest known\r\nVertebrata with five toes are the _Batrachias_ (Amphibia). We divide\r\nthis class into two sub-classes, namely, mailed Batrachians and naked\r\nBatrachians, the first of which is distinguished by the body being\r\ncovered with bony plates or scales.\r\n\r\nThe first and elder sub-class of Amphibia consists of the _Mailed\r\nBatrachians_ (Phractamphibia), the oldest land living Vertebrata of\r\nwhich fossil remains exist. Well-preserved fossil remains of them occur\r\nin the coal, especially of those with _Enamelled heads_ (Ganocephala),\r\nwhich are most closely allied to fish, namely, the Archegosaurus of\r\nSaarbruck, and the Dendrerpeton of North America. There then follow at a\r\nlater period the gigantic _Labyrinth-toothed animals_ (Labyrinthodonta),\r\nwhich are represented in the Permian system by Zygosaurus, but at a\r\nlater period, more especially in the Trias, by Mastodonsaurus,\r\nTrematosaurus, Capitosaurus, etc. The shape of these formidable\r\nrapacious animals seems to have been between that of crocodiles,\r\nsalamanders, and frogs, but in their internal structure they were more\r\nclosely related to the two latter, while by their solid coat of mail,\r\nformed of strong bony plates, they resembled the first animals. These\r\ngigantic mailed Batrachians seem to have become extinct towards the end\r\nof the Triassic period. No fossil remains of mailed Batrachia are known\r\nduring the whole of the subsequent periods. However, the still living\r\nblind Snakes, or _Cæciliæ_ (Peromela)—small-scaled Phractamphibia of the\r\nform and the same mode of life as the earth-worm—prove that this\r\nsub-class continued to exist, and never became completely extinct.\r\n\r\nThe second sub-class of Amphibia, the _naked Batrachia_ (Lissamphibia),\r\nprobably originated even during the primary and secondary epochs,\r\nalthough fossil remains of them are first found in the tertiary epoch.\r\nThey are distinguished from mailed Batrachia by possessing a naked\r\nsmooth, and slimy skin, entirely without scales or coat of mail. They\r\nprobably developed either out of a branch of the Phractamphibia, or out\r\nof the same common root with them. The ontogeny of the three still\r\nliving orders of naked Batrachia—the gilled Batrachia, tailed\r\nBatrachia, and frog Batrachia—distinctly repeats the historical course\r\nof development of the whole sub-class. The oldest forms are the gilled\r\nBatrachia (Sozobranchia), which retain throughout life the original\r\nprimary form of naked Batrachia, and possess a long tail, together with\r\nwater-breathing gills. They are most closely allied to the Dipneusta,\r\nfrom which, however, they differ externally by the absence of the coat\r\nof scales. Most gilled Batrachia live in North America: among others of\r\nthe class is the Axolotl, or Siredon, already mentioned. (Compare above,\r\nvol. i. p. 241.) In Europe the order is only represented by one form,\r\nthe celebrated “Olm” (Proteus anguinus), which inhabits the grotto of\r\nAdelsberg and other caves in Carinthia, and which, from living in the\r\ndark, has acquired rudimentary eyes which can no longer see (vol. i. p.\r\n13). The order of Tailed Batrachia (Sozura) have developed out of the\r\ngilled Batrachia by the loss of external gills; the order includes our\r\nblack and yellow spotted land Salamander (Salamandra maculata), and our\r\nnimble aquatic Salamanders (Tritons). Many of them—for instance, the\r\ncelebrated giant Salamanders in Japan (Cryptobranchus Japonicus)—still\r\nretain the gill-slits, although the gills themselves have disappeared.\r\nAll of them, however, retain the tail throughout life. Tritons\r\noccasionally—when forced to remain in water always—retain their gills,\r\nand thus remain at the same stage of development as gilled Batrachia.\r\n(Compare above, vol. i. p. 241.) The third order, the _tailless_ or\r\n_frog-like Batrachia_ (Anura), during their metamorphosis, not only lose\r\ntheir gills, with which in early life (as so-called tadpoles) they\r\nbreathe in water, but also the tail with which they swim about. During\r\ntheir ontogeny, therefore, they pass through the course of development\r\nof the whole sub-class, they being at first _Gilled Batrachia_, then\r\n_Tailed Batrachia_, and finally _Frog-like Batrachia_. The inference\r\nfrom this is evidently, that _Frog-like Batrachia_ developed at a later\r\nperiod out of _Tailed Batrachia_, as the latter had developed out of\r\n_Gilled Batrachia_ which originally existed alone.\r\n\r\nIn passing from the Amphibia to the next class of Vertebrata, namely,\r\nReptiles, we observe a very considerable advance in the progress of\r\norganization. All the double-nostriled animals (Amphirrhina) up to this\r\ntime considered, and more especially the two larger classes of Fish and\r\nBatrachia, agree in a number of important characteristics, which\r\nessentially distinguish them from the three remaining classes of\r\nVertebrata—Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals. During the embryological\r\ndevelopment of these latter, a peculiarly delicate covering, the _first\r\nfœtal membrane_, or _amnion_, which commences at the navel, is formed\r\nround the embryo; this membrane is filled with the amnion-water, and\r\nencloses the embryo or germ in the form of a bladder. On account of this\r\nvery important and characteristic formation, we may comprise the three\r\nmost highly developed classes of Vertebrata under the term\r\n_Amnion-animals_ (Amniota). The four classes of double-nostriled animals\r\nwhich we have just considered, in which the amnion is wanting (as is the\r\ncase in all lower Vertebrate animals, single-nostriled and skull-less\r\nanimals), may on the other hand be opposed to the others as _amnion-less\r\nanimals_ (Anamnia).\r\n\r\nThe formation of the fœtal membrane, or amnion, which distinguishes\r\nreptiles, birds, and mammals from all other Vertebrata, is evidently a\r\nvery important process in their ontogeny, and in the phylogeny which\r\ncorresponds with it. It coincides with a series of other processes,\r\nwhich essentially determine the higher development of Amnionate animals.\r\nThe first of these important processes is the _total loss of gills_, for\r\nwhich reason the Amniota, under the name of _Gill-less animals_\r\n(Ebranchiata), were formerly opposed to all other Vertebrate animals\r\nwhich breathed through gills (Branchiata). In all the Vertebrate already\r\ndiscussed, we found that they either always breathed through gills, or\r\nat least did so in early life, as in the case of Frogs and Salamanders.\r\nOn the other hand, we never meet with a Reptile, Bird, or Mammal which\r\nat any period of its existence breathes through gills, and the\r\ngill-arches and openings which do exist in the embryos, are, during the\r\ncourse of the ontogeny, changed into entirely different structures,\r\nviz., into parts of the jaw-apparatus and the organ of hearing. (Compare\r\nabove, vol. i. p. 307.) All Amnionate animals have a so-called cochlea\r\nin the organ of hearing, and a “round window” corresponding with it.\r\nThese parts are wanting in the Amnion-less animals; moreover, their\r\nskull lies in a straight line with the axis of the vertebral column. In\r\nAmniotic animals the base of the skull appears bent in on the abdominal\r\nside, so that the head sinks upon the breast. (Plate III. Fig. _C_, _D_,\r\n_G_, _H_.) The organs of tears at the side of the eye also first develop\r\nin the Amniota.\r\n\r\nThe question now is, When did this important advance take place in the\r\ncourse of the organic history of the earth? When did the common ancestor\r\nof all Amniota develop out of a branch of the Non-amniota, to wit, out\r\nof the branch of the Amphibia?\r\n\r\nTo this question, the fossil remains of Vertebrata do not give us a very\r\ndefinite, but still they do give an approximate, answer. For with the\r\nexception of two lizard-like animals found in the Permian system (the\r\nProterosaurus and Rhopalodon), all the fossil remains of Amniota, as yet\r\nknown, belong to the _secondary_, _tertiary_, and _quaternary epochs_.\r\nWith regard to the two Vertebrata just named, it is still doubtful\r\nwhether they are genuine reptiles, or perhaps Amphibia of the salamander\r\nkind. Their skeleton alone is known to us, and even this not perfectly.\r\nNow as we know nothing of the characteristic features of their soft\r\nparts, it is quite possible that the Proterosaurus and Rhopalodon were\r\nnon-amnionate animals more closely allied to Amphibia than to Reptiles;\r\npossibly they belonged to the transition form between the two classes.\r\nBut, on the other hand, as undoubted fossil remains of Amniota have been\r\nfound as early as the Trias, it is probable that the _main class of\r\nAmniota_ first developed in the Trias, that is, in the beginning of the\r\nMesolithic epoch. As we have already seen, this very period is evidently\r\none of the most important turning points in the organic history of the\r\nearth. The palæolithic fern forests were then replaced by the pine\r\nforests of the Trias period; important transformations then took place\r\nin many of the classes of Invertebrata. Articulated marine lilies\r\n(Colocrina) developed out of the plated ones (Phatnocrina.) The\r\nAutechinidæ, or sea-urchins with only twenty rows of plates, took the\r\nplace of the palæolithic Palechinidæ, the sea-urchins with more than\r\ntwenty rows of plates. The Cystideæ, Blastoideæ, Trilobita, and other\r\ncharacteristic groups of Invertebrata of the primary period became\r\nextinct. It is no wonder that transforming conditions of adaptation\r\npowerfully influenced the Vertebrate tribes also in the beginning of the\r\nTrias period, and caused the origin of Amniotic animals.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the two Lizard and Salamander-like animals of the Permian\r\nsystem, the Proterosaurus and Rhopalodon, are considered genuine\r\nReptiles, and consequently the most ancient Amniota, then the origin of\r\nthis main class must necessarily have taken place in the preceding\r\nperiod, towards the end of the primary, namely, in the Permian period.\r\nHowever, all other remains of Reptiles, which were formerly believed to\r\nhave been found in the Permian and the Coal system, or even in the\r\nDevonian system, have been proved to be either not remains of Reptiles\r\nat all, or to belong to a more recent date (for the most part to the\r\nTrias). (Compare Plate XIV.)\r\n\r\nThe common hypothetical primary form of all Amniotic animals, which we\r\nmay call _Protamnion_, and which was possibly nearly related to the\r\nProterosaurus, very probably stood upon the whole midway between\r\nsalamanders and lizards, in regard to its bodily formation. Its\r\ndescendants divided at an early period into two different lines, one of\r\nwhich became the common primary form of Reptiles and Birds, the other\r\nthe primary form of Mammals.\r\n\r\nOf all the three classes of Amniota, _Reptiles_ (Reptilia, or Pholidota,\r\nalso called Sauria in the widest sense), remain at the lowest stage of\r\ndevelopment, and differ least from their ancestors, the Amphibia. Hence\r\nthey were formerly universally included among them, although their whole\r\norganization is much more like that of Birds than Amphibia. There now\r\nexist only four orders of Reptiles, namely,—Lizards, Serpents,\r\nCrocodiles, and Tortoises. They, however, form but a poor remnant of the\r\nexceedingly various and highly developed host of Reptiles which lived\r\nduring the Mesolithic, or Secondary epoch, and predominated over all\r\nother Vertebrata. The immense development of Reptiles during the\r\nSecondary epoch is so characteristic that we could as well name it after\r\nthose animals as after the Gymnosperms (p. 111). Twelve of the\r\ntwenty-seven sub-orders, given on the accompanying table, and four of\r\nthe eight orders, belong exclusively to the secondary period. These\r\nmesolithic groups are marked by an asterisk. All the orders, with the\r\nexception of Serpents, are found fossilized even in the Jura and Trias\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pl.

Tocornithes       * (Tocornis)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the four orders of reptiles now existing, and which, moreover, have\r\nalone represented the class since the beginning of the tertiary epoch,\r\nthat of _Lizards_ (Lacertilia) is probably most closely allied to the\r\nextinct Primary Reptiles, and especially through the monitors already\r\nnamed. The class of _Serpents_ (Ophidia) developed out of a branch of\r\nthe order of lizards, and this probably not until the beginning of the\r\ntertiary epoch. At least we at present only know of fossil remains of\r\nserpents from the tertiary strata. _Crocodiles_ (Crocodilia) existed\r\nmuch earlier; the Teleosauria and Steneosauria belonging to the class\r\nare found fossil in large quantities even in the Jura; but the still\r\nliving alligators are first met with in a fossil state in the chalk and\r\ntertiary strata. The most isolated of the four existing orders of\r\nreptiles consists of the remarkable group of _Tortoises_ (Chelonia);\r\nfossils of these strange animals are first met with in the Jura. In some\r\ncharacteristics they are allied to Amphibia, in others, to Crocodiles,\r\nand by certain peculiarities even to Birds, so that their true position\r\nin the pedigree of Reptiles is probably far down at the root. The\r\nextraordinary resemblance of their embryos to Birds, manifested even at\r\nlater stages of the ontogenesis, is exceedingly striking.\r\n\r\nThe four extinct orders of Reptiles show among one another, and, with\r\nthe four existing orders just mentioned, such various and complicated\r\nrelationships, that in the present state of our knowledge we are obliged\r\nto give up the attempt at establishing their pedigree. The most\r\ndeviating and most curious forms are the _Flying Reptiles_\r\n(Pterosauria); flying lizards, in which the extremely elongated fifth\r\nfinger of the hand served to support an enormous flying membrane. They\r\nprobably flew about, in the secondary period, much in the same way as\r\nthe bats of the present day. The smallest flying lizards were about the\r\nsize of a sparrow; the largest, however, with a breadth of wing of more\r\nthan sixteen feet, exceeded the largest of our living flying birds in\r\nstretch of wing (condor and albatross). Numerous fossil remains of them,\r\nof the long-tailed Rhamphorhynchia and of the short-tailed Pterodactylæ\r\nare found in all the strata of the Jura and Chalk periods, but in these\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable and characteristic of the Mesolithic epoch was the\r\ngroup of _Dragons_ (Dinosauria, or Pachypoda). These colossal reptiles,\r\nwhich attained a length of more than fifty feet, are the largest\r\ninhabitants of the land which have ever existed on our globe; they lived\r\nexclusively in the secondary epoch. Most of their remains are found in\r\nthe lower cretaceous system, more especially in the Wealden formations\r\nof England. The majority of them were fearful beasts of prey (the\r\nMegalosaurus from twenty to thirty, the Pelorosaurus from forty to fifty\r\nfeet in length). The Iguanodon, however, and some others lived on\r\nvegetable food, and probably played a part in the forests of the chalk\r\nperiod similar to that of the unwieldy but smaller elephants,\r\nhippopotami, and rhinoceroses of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe _Beaked Reptiles_ (Anomodontia), likewise also long since extinct,\r\nbut of which very many remarkable remains are found in the Trias and\r\nJura, were perhaps closely related to the Dragons. Their jaws, like\r\nthose of most Flying Reptiles and Tortoises, had become changed into a\r\nbeak, which either possessed only degenerated rudimentary teeth, or no\r\nteeth at all. In this order, if not in the preceding one, we must look\r\nfor the primary parents of the bird class, which we may call Bird\r\nReptiles (Tocornithes). Probably very closely related to them was the\r\ncurious, kangaroo-like Compsognathus from the Jura, which in very\r\nimportant characteristics already shows an approximation to the\r\nstructure of birds.\r\n\r\nThe class of _Birds_ (Aves), as already remarked, is so closely allied\r\nto Reptiles in internal structure and by embryonal development, that\r\nthey undoubtedly originated out of a branch of this class. Even a glance\r\nat Plates II. and III. will show that the embryos of birds at a time\r\nwhen they already essentially differ from the embryos of Mammals, are\r\nstill scarcely distinguishable from those of Tortoises and other\r\nReptiles. The cleavage of the yolk is partial in the case of Birds and\r\nReptiles, in Mammals it is total. The red blood-cells of the former\r\npossess a kernel, those of the latter do not. The hair of Mammals\r\ndevelops in closed follicles in the skin, but the feathers of birds and\r\nalso the scales of reptiles develop in hillocks on the skin. The lower\r\njaw of the latter is much more complicated than that of Mammals; the\r\nlatter do not possess the quadrate bone of the former. Whereas in\r\nMammals (as in the case of Amphibia) the connection between the skull\r\nand the first neck vertebra is formed by two knobbed joints, or\r\ncondyles, in Birds and Reptiles those have become united into a single\r\ncondyle. The two last classes may therefore justly be united into one\r\ngroup as Monocondylia, and contrasted to Mammals, or Dicondylia.\r\n\r\nThe deviation of Birds from Reptiles, in any case, first took place in\r\nthe mesolithic epoch, and this moreover probably during the Trias. The\r\noldest fossil remains of birds are found in the upper Jura\r\n(Archæopteryx). But there existed, even in the Trias period, different\r\nSaurians (Anomodonta) which in many respects seem to form the transition\r\nfrom the Tocosauria to the primary ancestors of Birds, the hypothetical\r\nTocornithes. Probably these Tocornithes were scarcely distinguishable\r\nfrom other beaked lizards in the system, and were closely related to the\r\nkangaroo-like Compsognathus from the Jura of Solenhofen. Huxley classes\r\nthe latter with the Dinosauria, and believes them to be the nearest\r\nrelations to the Tocornithes.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of Birds—in spite of all the variety in the colouring\r\nof their beautiful feathery dress, and in the formation of their beaks\r\nand feet—are of an exceedingly uniform organization, in much the same\r\nway as are the class of insects. The bird form has adapted itself on all\r\nsides to the external conditions of existence, without having thereby in\r\nany way essentially deviated from the strict hereditary type of its\r\ncharacteristic structure. There are only two small groups, the\r\nfeather-tailed birds (Saururæ) and those of the ostrich kind, which\r\ndiffer considerably from the usual type of bird, namely, from those with\r\nkeel-shaped breasts (Carinatæ), and hence the whole class may be divided\r\ninto three sub-classes.\r\n\r\nThe first sub-class, the _Reptile-tailed_, or _Feather-tailed Birds_\r\n(Saururæ), are as yet known only through a single, and that an\r\nimperfect, fossil impression, which, however, in being the oldest and\r\nalso a very peculiar fossil bird, is of great importance. This fossil is\r\nthe Primæval Griffin, or Archæopteryx lithographica, of which as yet\r\nonly one specimen has been found in the lithographic slate at\r\nSolenhofen, in the Upper Jura system of Bavaria. This remarkable bird\r\nseems on the whole to have been of the size and form of a large raven,\r\nespecially as regards the legs, which are in a good state of\r\npreservation; head and breast unfortunately are wanting. The formation\r\nof the wings deviates somewhat from that of other birds, but that of the\r\ntail still more so. In all other birds the tail is very short and\r\ncomposed of but few short vertebræ; the last of these have grown\r\ntogether into a thin, bony plate standing perpendicularly, upon which\r\nthe rudder-feathers of the tail are attached in the form of a fan. The\r\nArchæopteryx, however, has a long tail like a lizard, composed of\r\nnumerous (20) long thin vertebræ, and on every vertebra are attached\r\nthe strong rudder-feathers in twos, so that the whole tail appears\r\nregularly feathered. This same formation of the tail part of the\r\nvertebral column occurs transiently in the embryos of other birds, so\r\nthat the tail of the Archæopteryx evidently represents the original form\r\nof bird-tail inherited from reptiles. Large numbers of similar birds\r\nwith lizard-tails probably lived during the middle of the secondary\r\nperiod; accident has as yet, however, only revealed this one fossil.\r\n\r\nThe _Fan-tailed_, or _Keel-breasted birds_ (Carinatæ), which form the\r\nsecond sub-class, comprise all living Birds of the present day, with the\r\nexception of those of the ostrich kind, or Ratitæ. They probably\r\ndeveloped out of Feather-tailed Birds during the first half of the\r\nsecondary period, namely, in the Jura or Chalk period, by the hinder\r\ntail vertebræ growing together, and by the tail becoming shortened. Only\r\nvery few remains of them are known from the secondary period, and these\r\nmoreover only out of the last section of it, namely, from the Chalk.\r\nThese remains belong to a swimming bird of the albatross species, and a\r\nwading bird like a snipe. All the other fossil remains of birds as yet\r\nknown have been found in the tertiary strata.\r\n\r\nThe _Bushy-tailed_, or _Ostrich-like Birds_ (Ratitæ), also called\r\n_Running Birds_ (Cursores), the third and last sub-class, is now\r\nrepresented only by a few living species, by the African ostrich with\r\ntwo toes, the American and Australian ostrich with three toes, by the\r\nIndian cassowary and the four-toed kiwi, or Apteryx, in New Zealand. The\r\nextinct giant birds of Madagascar (Æpyornis) and the New Zealand\r\nDinornis, which were much larger than the still living ostriches, also\r\nbelong to this group. The Birds of the ostrich kind—by giving up the\r\nhabit of flying, by the degeneration of the muscles for flying resulting\r\nfrom this, and of the breast bone which serves as their support, and by\r\nthe corresponding stronger development of the hinder legs for\r\nrunning—have probably arisen out of a branch of the Keel-breasted birds.\r\nBut possibly, as Huxley thinks, they may be the nearest relations of the\r\nDinosauria and of the Reptiles akin to them, especially of the\r\nCompsognathus; at all events, the common primary form of all Birds must\r\nbe looked for among the extinct Reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nPEDIGREE AND HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nIV. MAMMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The System of Mammals according to Linnæus and\r\n  Blainville.—Three Sub-classes of Mammals (Ornithodelphia,\r\n  Didelphia, Monodelphia).—Ornithodelphia, or Monotrema.—Beaked\r\n  Animals (Ornithostoma).—Didelphia, or Marsupials.—Herbivorous\r\n  and Carnivorous Marsupials.—Monodelphia, or Placentalia\r\n  (Placental Animals).—Meaning of the Placenta.—Tuft\r\n  Placentalia.—Girdle Placentalia.—Disc\r\n  Placentalia.—Non-deciduates, or Indeciduata.—Hoofed\r\n  Animals.—Single and Double-hoofed Animals.—Whales.—Toothless\r\n  Animals.—Deciduates, or Animals with\r\n  Decidua.—Semi-apes.—Gnawing Animals.—Pseudo-hoofed\r\n  Animals.—Insectivora.—Beasts of Prey.—Bats.—Apes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are only a few points in the classification of organisms upon\r\nwhich naturalists have always agreed. One of these few undisputed points\r\nis the privileged position of the class of Mammals at the head of the\r\nanimal kingdom. The reason of this privilege consists partly in the\r\nspecial interest, also in the various uses and the many pleasures, which\r\nMammals, more than all other animals, offer to man, and partly in the\r\ncircumstance that man himself is a member of this class. For however\r\ndifferently in other respects man’s position in nature and in the system\r\nof animals may have been regarded, yet no naturalist has ever doubted\r\nthat man, at least from a purely morphological point of view, belongs\r\nto the class of Mammals. From this there directly follows the\r\nexceedingly important inference that man, by consanguinity also, is a\r\nmember of this class of animals, and has historically developed out of\r\nlong since extinct forms of Mammals. This circumstance alone justifies\r\nus here in turning our especial attention to the history and the\r\npedigree of Mammals. Let us, therefore, for this purpose first examine\r\nthe groups of this class of animals.\r\n\r\nOlder naturalists, especially considering the formation of the jaw and\r\nfeet, divided the class of Mammals into a series of from eight to\r\nsixteen orders. The lowest stage of the series was occupied by the\r\nwhales, which seemed to differ most from man, who stands at the highest\r\nstage, by their fish-like form of body. Thus Linnæus distinguished the\r\nfollowing eight orders: (1) Cetæ (whales); (2) Belluæ (hippopotami and\r\nhorses); (3) Pecora (ruminating animals); (4) Glires (gnawing animals\r\nand rhinoceroses); (5) Bestiæ (insectivora, marsupials, and various\r\nothers); (6) Feræ (beasts of prey); (7) Bruta (toothless animals and\r\nelephants); (8) Primates (bats, semi-apes, apes, and men). Cuvier’s\r\nclassification, which became the standard of most subsequent zoologists,\r\ndid not rise much above that of Linnæus. Cuvier distinguished the\r\nfollowing eight orders: (1) Cetacea (whales); (2) Ruminantia (ruminating\r\nanimals); (3) Pachyderma (hoofed animals, with the exclusion of\r\nruminating animals); (4) Edentata (animals poor in teeth); (5) Rodentia\r\n(gnawing animals); (6) Carnassia (marsupials, beasts of prey,\r\ninsectivora, and bats); (7) Quadrumana (semi-apes and apes); (8) Bimana\r\n(man).\r\n\r\nThe most important advance in the classification of Mammals was made as\r\nearly as 1816 by the eminent anatomist Blainville, who has already been\r\nmentioned, and who first clearly recognised the three natural main\r\ngroups or sub-classes of Mammals, and distinguished them according to\r\nthe formation of their generative organs as _Ornithodelphia_,\r\n_Didelphia_, and _Monodelphia_. As this division is now justly\r\nconsidered by all scientific zoologists to be the best, on account of\r\nsolid foundation on the history of development, let us here keep to it\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe first sub-class consists of the _Cloacal Animals_, or _Breastless\r\nanimals_, also called _Forked animals_ (Monotrema, or Ornithodelphia).\r\nThis class is now represented only by two species of living mammals,\r\nboth of which are confined to Australia and the neighbouring island of\r\nVan Diemen’s land, namely, the well-known Water Duck-bill\r\n(Ornithorhynchus paradoxus) with the beak of a bird, and the less known\r\nBeaked Mole (Echidna hystrix), resembling a hedgehog. Both of these\r\ncurious animals, which are classed in the order of _Beaked Animals_\r\n(Ornithostoma), are evidently the last surviving remnants of an animal\r\ngroup formerly rich in forms, which alone represented the Mammalia in\r\nthe secondary epoch, and out of which the second sub-class, the\r\nDidelphia, developed later, probably in the Jurassic period.\r\nUnfortunately, we as yet do not know with certainty of any fossil\r\nremains of this most ancient primary group of Mammals, which we will\r\ncall _Primary Mammals_ (Promammalia). Yet they possibly comprise the\r\noldest of all the fossil Mammalia known, namely, the Microlestes\r\nantiquus, of which animals, however, we as yet only know some few small\r\nmolar teeth. These have been found in the uppermost strata of the\r\nTrias, in the Keuper, first in Germany (at Degerloch, near Stuttgart,\r\nin 1847), later also in England (at Frome), in 1858. Similar teeth have\r\nlately been found also in the North American Trias, and have been\r\ndescribed as Dromatherium sylvestre. These remarkable teeth, from the\r\ncharacteristic form of which we can conclude that they belonged to an\r\ninsectivorous mammal, are the only remains of mammals as yet found in\r\nthe older secondary strata, namely, in the Trias. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that besides these many of the other mammalian teeth found in\r\nthe Jura and Chalk systems, which are still generally ascribed to\r\nMarsupials, in reality belong to Cloacal Animals. This cannot be decided\r\nwith certainty owing to the absence of the characteristic soft parts. In\r\nany case, numerous Monotrema, with well-developed teeth and cloaca, must\r\nhave preceded the advent of Marsupial animals.\r\n\r\nThe designation, “_Cloacal animals_” (Monotrema), has been given to the\r\nOrnithodelphia on account of the cloaca which distinguishes them from\r\nall other Mammals; but which on the other hand makes them agree with\r\nBirds, Reptiles, and Amphibia, in fact, with the lower Vertebrata. The\r\nformation of the cloaca consists in the last portion of the intestinal\r\ncanal receiving the mouth of the urogenital apparatus, that is, the\r\nunited urinary and genital organs, whereas in all other Mammals\r\n(Didelphia as well Monodelphia) these organs have an opening distinct\r\nfrom that of the rectum. However, in these latter also the cloaca\r\nformation exists during the first period of their embryonal life, and\r\nthe separation of the two openings takes place only at a later date (in\r\nman about the twelfth week of development). The Cloacal animals have\r\nalso been called “_Forked animals_,” because the collar-bones, by means\r\nof the breast bone, have become united into one piece, similar to the\r\nwell-known fork-bone, or merry-thought, in birds. In all other Mammals\r\nthe two collar-bones remain separated in front and do not fuse with the\r\nbreast bone. Moreover, the coracoid bones are much more strongly\r\ndeveloped in the Cloacal animals than in the other Mammalia, and are\r\nconnected with the breast bone.\r\n\r\nIn many other characteristics also—especially in the formation of their\r\ninternal genital organs, their auricular labyrinth, and their\r\nbrain—Beaked animals are more closely allied to the other Vertebrata\r\nthan to Mammals, so that some naturalists have been inclined to separate\r\nthem from the latter as a special class. However, like all other\r\nMammals, they bring forth living young ones, which for a time are\r\nnourished with milk from the mother. But whereas in all other Mammals\r\nthe milk issues through nipples, or teats, from the mammary glands,\r\nteats are completely wanting in beaked animals, and the milk comes\r\nsimply out of a flat, sieve-like, perforated patch of the skin. Hence\r\nthey may also be called _Breastless_ or _Teatless animals_ (Amasta).\r\n\r\nThe curious formation of the beak in the two still living Beaked\r\nanimals, which is connected with the suppression of the teeth, must\r\nevidently not be looked upon as an essential feature of the whole\r\nsub-class of Cloacal animals, but as an accidental character of\r\nadaptation distinguishing the last remnant of the class as much from the\r\nextinct main group, as the formation of a similar toothless snout\r\ndistinguishes many toothless animals (for instance, the ant-eater) from\r\nthe other placental animals. The unknown, extinct Primary Mammals, or\r\nPromammalia—which lived during the Trias period, and of which the two\r\nstill living orders of Beaked animals represent but a single\r\ndegenerated branch developed on one side—probably possessed a very\r\nhighly developed jaw like the marsupial animals, which developed from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Marsupial_, or _Pouched Animals_ (Didelphia, or Marsupialia), the\r\nsecond of the three sub-classes of Mammals, form in every respect—both\r\nas regards their anatomy and embryology, as well as their genealogy and\r\nhistory—the transition between the other sub-classes—the Cloacal and\r\nPlacental Animals. Numerous representatives of this group still exist,\r\nespecially the well-known kangaroos, pouched rats, and pouched dogs; but\r\non the whole this sub-class, like the preceding one, is evidently\r\napproaching its complete extinction, and the living members of the class\r\nare the last surviving remnants of a large group rich in forms, which\r\nrepresented the Mammalia during the more recent secondary and the\r\nearlier tertiary periods. The Marsupial Animals probably developed\r\ntowards the middle of the Mesolithic epoch (during the Jura) out of a\r\nbranch of the Cloacal Animals, and in the beginning of the Tertiary\r\nepoch again, the group of Placental Animals arose out of the Marsupials,\r\nand the latter then succumbed to the former in the struggle for life.\r\nAll the fossil remains of Mammals known to us from the Secondary epoch,\r\nbelong either exclusively to Marsupials, or partly perhaps to Cloacal\r\nanimals. At that time Marsupials seem to have been distributed over the\r\nwhole earth; even in Europe (France and England), well-preserved fossil\r\nremains of them have been found. On the other hand, the last off-shoots\r\nof the sub-class now living are confined to a very narrow tract of\r\ndistribution, namely, to Australia, the Australasian, and a small part\r\nof the Asiatic Archipelago. There are also a few species still living\r\nin America, but at the present day not a single marsupial animal lives\r\non the continent of Asia, Africa, or Europe.\r\n\r\nThe name of pouched animals is given to the class on account of the\r\npurse-shaped pouch (marsupium) existing in most instances on the\r\nabdominal side of the female animals, in which the mother carries about\r\nher young for a considerable time after their birth. This pouch is\r\nsupported by two characteristic marsupial bones, also existing in\r\nCloacal animals, but not in Placental animals. The young Marsupial\r\nanimal is born in a much more imperfect form than the young Placental\r\nanimal, and only attains the same degree of development which the latter\r\npossesses directly at its birth, after it has developed in the pouch for\r\nsome time. In the case of the giant kangaroo, which attains the height\r\nof a man, the newly born young one, which has been carried in the\r\nmaternal womb not much longer than five weeks, is not more than an inch\r\nin length, and only attains its essential development subsequently, in\r\nthe pouch of the mother, where it remains about nine months attached to\r\nthe nipple of the mammary gland.\r\n\r\nThe different divisions generally distinguished as families in the\r\nsub-class of Marsupial animals, deserve in reality the rank of\r\nindependent orders, for they differ from one another in manifold\r\ndifferentiations of the jaw and limbs, in much the same manner, although\r\nnot so sharply, as the various orders of Placental animals. In part they\r\nperfectly agree with the latter. It is evident that adaptation to\r\nsimilar conditions of life has effected entirely coincident or analogous\r\ntransformations of the original fundamental form in the two sub-classes\r\nof Marsupials. According to this, about eight orders of Marsupial\r\nanimals may be distinguished, the one half of the main group or legion\r\nof which are herbivorous, the other half carnivorous. The oldest fossil\r\nremains of the two legions (if the previously mentioned Microlestes and\r\nthe Dromatherium are not included) occur in the Jurassic strata, namely,\r\nin the slates of Stonesfield, near Oxford. The slates belong to the\r\nBath, or the Lower Oolite formation—strata which lie directly above the\r\nLias, the oldest Jura formation. (Compare p. 15.) It is true that the\r\nremains of Marsupials found in the slates of Stonesfield, as well as\r\nthose which were found later in the Purbeck strata, consist only of\r\nlower jaws. (Compare p. 29.) But fortunately the lower jaw is just one\r\nof the most characteristic parts of the skeleton of Marsupials. For it\r\nis distinguished by a hook-shaped process of the lower corner of the jaw\r\nturning downwards and backwards, which neither occurs in Placental nor\r\nin the (still living) Cloacal animals, and from the existence of this\r\nprocess on the lower jaws from Stonesfield, we may infer that they\r\nbelonged to Marsupials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF CLOACAL AND MARSUPIAL MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\nI. _First Sub-class of Mammalia:_\r\n\r\n_Forked or Cloacal Animals (Monotrema, or Ornithodelphia)._\r\n\r\nMammals with Cloaca, without Placenta, with Marsupial Bones.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         I.         }\r\n  =Primary Mammals= } Unknown extinct Mammalia from the           { (Microlestes?)\r\n    +Promammalia+   }         Trias Period                        { (Dromatherium?)\r\n\r\n         II.        } 1.

But in Australia there are\r\ngigantic fossil remains of extinct herbivorous Marsupials from the\r\ndiluvial period (Diprotodon and Nototherium) which were far larger than\r\nthe largest of the still living Marsupials. The Diprotodon Australis,\r\nwhose skull alone is three feet long, exceeded even the river-horse, or\r\nHippopotamus, in size and upon the whole resembled it in the unwieldy\r\nand clumsy form of body. This extinct group, which probably corresponded\r\nwith the gigantic placental hoofed animals of the present day—the\r\nhippopotami and rhinoceroses—may be called Hoofed Marsupials (Barypoda).\r\nClosely allied to them is the order of kangaroos, or Leaping Marsupials\r\n(Macropoda), which all have seen in zoological gardens. In their\r\nshortened fore legs, their very lengthened hind legs, and very strong\r\ntail, which serves as a jumping pole, they correspond with the leaping\r\nmice in the class of Rodents. Their jaw, however, resembles that of\r\nhorses, and their complex stomach that of Ruminants. A third order of\r\nHerbivorous Marsupials corresponds in its jaws to Rodents, and in its\r\nsubterranean mode of life, especially, to digging mice. Hence they may\r\nbe termed Rodent Marsupials, or root-eating pouched animals\r\n(Rhizophaga). They are now represented only by the Australian wombat\r\n(Phascolomys). A fourth and last order of Herbivorous Marsupials is\r\nformed by the climbing or Fruit-eating Marsupials (Carpophaga), whose\r\nmode of life and structure resembles partly that of squirrels, partly\r\nthat of apes (Phalangista, Phascolarctus).\r\n\r\nThe second legion of Marsupials, the _Carnivorous Marsupials_\r\n(Zoophaga), is likewise divided into four main groups or orders. The\r\nmost ancient of these is that of the primæval, or Insectivorous\r\nMarsupials (Cantharophaga). It probably includes the primary forms of\r\nthe whole legion, and possibly also those of the whole sub-class. At\r\nleast, all the lower jaws from Stonesfield (with the exception of the\r\nStereognathus) belong to Insectivorous Marsupials, and the still living\r\nMyrmecobius is their nearest relative. But some of those oolitic\r\nPrimæval Marsupials possessed a larger number of teeth than all the\r\nother known mammals, for each half of the lower jaw of the\r\nThylacotherium contained sixteen teeth (three incisors, one canine\r\ntooth, six pseudo, and six genuine molars). If the upper jaw, which is\r\nunknown, had as many teeth, then the Thylacotherium had no less than\r\nsixty-four teeth, just double the number possessed by man. The Primæval\r\nMarsupials correspond, on the whole, with the Insectivora among\r\nPlacental animals, which order includes hedgehogs, moles, and\r\nshrew-mice. A second order, which has probably developed out of a branch\r\nof the last, consists of the Snouted, or Toothless Marsupials\r\n(Edentula), which resemble the Toothless animals, or Edentata, among the\r\nPlacental animals by their tube-shaped snout, their degenerated jaws,\r\nand their corresponding mode of life. On the other hand, the mode of\r\nlife and formation of the jaws of Rapacious marsupials (Creophaga)\r\ncorrespond with those of the genuine Beasts of Prey, or Carnivora, among\r\nPlacental animals. This order includes the pouched marten (Dasyurus) and\r\nthe pouched wolf (Thylacinus) in Australia. Although the latter attains\r\nto the size of a wolf, it is but a dwarf in comparison with the extinct\r\nAustralian pouched lions (Thylacoleo) which were at least as large as a\r\nlion, and possessed huge canine teeth more than two inches in length.\r\nFinally, the eighth and last order is formed by the marsupials with\r\nhands, or the Ape-footed Pouched animals (Pedimana), which live both in\r\nAustralia and America. They are frequently kept in zoological gardens,\r\nespecially the different species of the genus Didelphys, and are known\r\nby the name of pouched rats, bush rats, or opossums. The thumb on their\r\nhinder feet is opposable to the four other toes, as in a hand, and by\r\nthis they are directly allied to the Semi-apes, or Prosimia, among\r\nPlacental animals. It is possible that these latter are really next akin\r\nto the marsupials with hands, and that they have developed out of their\r\nlong since extinct ancestors.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to discover the genealogy of Marsupials, and this\r\nmore especially because we are but very imperfectly acquainted with the\r\nwhole sub-class; and the Marsupials of the present day are evidently\r\nonly the last remnants of a group that was at one time rich in forms. It\r\nis possible that Marsupials with hands, those with snouts, as well as\r\nrapacious Marsupials, developed as three diverging branches out of the\r\ncommon primary group of Primæval Marsupials. In a similar manner, on the\r\nother hand, the rodent, leaping, and hoofed Marsupials have perhaps\r\narisen as three diverging branches out of the common herbivorous primary\r\ngroup, that is, out of the Climbing Marsupials. Climbing and Primæval\r\nMarsupials might, however, be two diverging branches of the common\r\nprimary forms of all Marsupials, that is, of the _Primary Marsupials_\r\n(Prodidelphia), which originated during the older secondary period out\r\nof Cloacal animals.\r\n\r\nThe third and last sub-class of mammals comprises the _Placental\r\nanimals_, or _Placentals_ (Monodelphia, or Placentalia). It is by far\r\nthe most important, comprehensive, and most perfect of the three\r\nsub-classes; for the class includes all the known mammalia, with the\r\nexception of Marsupials and Beaked animals. Man also belongs to this\r\nsub-class, and has developed out of its lower members.\r\n\r\nPlacental animals, as their name indicates, are distinguished from all\r\nother mammals, more especially by the formation of a so called\r\n_placenta_. This is a very peculiar and remarkable organ, which plays\r\nan exceedingly important part in nourishing the young one developing in\r\nthe maternal body. The placenta (also called after-birth) is a soft,\r\nspongy, red body, which differs very much in form and size, but which\r\nconsists for the most part of an intricate network of veins and blood\r\nvessels. Its importance lies in the exchange of substance between the\r\nnutritive blood of the maternal womb, or uterus, and the body of the\r\ngerm, or embryo. (See vol. i. p. 298.) This very important organ is\r\ndeveloped neither in marsupials nor in beaked animals. But placental\r\nanimals are also distinguished from these two sub-classes by many other\r\npeculiarities, thus more especially by the absence of marsupial bones,\r\nby the higher development of the internal sexual organs, and by the more\r\nperfect development of the brain, especially of the so-called callous\r\nbody or beam (_corpus callosum_), which, as the intermediate commissure,\r\nor transverse bridge, connects the two hemispheres of the large brain\r\nwith each other. Placental animals also do not possess the peculiar\r\nhooked process of the lower jaw which characterizes Marsupials. The\r\nfollowing classification (p. 246) of the most important characteristics\r\nof the three sub-classes will best explain how Marsupials, in these\r\nanatomical respects, stand midway between Cloacal and Placental animals.\r\n\r\nPlacental animals are more variously differentiated and perfected, and\r\nthis, moreover, in a far higher degree, than Marsupials, and they have,\r\non this account, long since been arranged into a number of orders,\r\ndiffering principally in the formation of the jaws and feet. But what is\r\neven of more importance than these, is the different development of the\r\nplacenta, and the manner of its connection with the maternal uterus.\r\nFor in the three lower orders of Placental animals, in Hoofed animals,\r\nWhales, and Toothless animals, the peculiar spongy membrane, which is\r\ncalled the _deciduous membrane_, or _decidua_, and which connects the\r\nmaternal and the fœtal portions of the placenta, does _not_ become\r\ndeveloped. This takes place exclusively in the seven higher orders of\r\nPlacental animals, and we may, therefore, according to Huxley, class\r\nthem in the main group of _Deciduata_, or animals with _decidua_. They\r\nare contrasted with the three first-mentioned legions of indeciduous\r\nanimals, or _Indeciduata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------\r\n                             | _Cloacal Animals_ | _Pouched Animals_ |_Placental Animals_\r\n     _Three Sub-Classes_     |    MONOTREMA      |  MARSUPIALIA      |   PLACENTALIA\r\n             _of_            |      _or_         |      _or_         |       _or_\r\n          _Mammals._         |  ORNITHODELPHIA   |   DIDELPHIA       |   MONODELPHIA\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------\r\n  1.

In the Indeciduata it consists, in most\r\ncases, of numerous, single, scattered bunches or tufts of vessels, and\r\nhence this group may be called _tufted placental animals_\r\n(Villiplacentalia). In the Deciduata, however, the single tufts of\r\nvessels are united into a cake, which appears in two different forms. In\r\nthe one case it surrounds the embryo in the form of a closed band or\r\nring, so that only the two poles of the oval egg bladder are free of\r\ntufts; this is the case in animals of prey (Carnaria) and the\r\npseudo-hoofed animals (Chelophora), which may consequently be comprised\r\nas _girdled-placental animals_ (Zonoplacentalia). In the other\r\nDeciduata, to which man also belongs, the placenta is a simple round\r\ndisc, and we therefore call them _disc-placentals_ (Discoplacentalia).\r\nThis group includes the five orders of Semi-apes, Gnawing animals,\r\nInsectivora, Bats, and Apes, from the latter of which, in the zoological\r\nsystem, man cannot be separated.\r\n\r\nIt may be considered as quite certain, from reasons based upon their\r\ncomparative anatomy and their history of development, that Placental\r\nanimals first developed out of Marsupials, and that this very important\r\ndevelopment—the first origin of the placenta—probably took place in the\r\nbeginning of the tertiary epoch, during the eocene period. But one of\r\nthe most difficult questions in the genealogy of animals is the\r\nimportant consideration whether all Placental animals have arisen out of\r\none or out of several distinct branches of Marsupials; in other words,\r\nwhether the origin of the placenta occurred but once, or several times.\r\n\r\nWhen, in my General Morphology, I for the first time endeavoured to\r\nestablish the pedigree of Mammals, I here, as in most cases, preferred\r\nthe monophyletic, or one-rooted, to the polyphyletic, or many-rooted,\r\nhypothesis of descent. I assumed that all Placental animals were derived\r\nfrom a single form of Marsupial animal, which, for the first time, began\r\nto form a placenta. In this case the Villiplacentals, Zonoplacentals,\r\nand Discoplacentals would perhaps have to be considered as three\r\ndiverging branches of the common primary form of Placentals, or it might\r\nalso be conceived that the two latter, the Deciduata, had developed only\r\nat a later period out of the Indeciduata, which on their part had arisen\r\ndirectly out of the Marsupials. However, there are also important\r\nreasons for the alternative; namely, that several groups of Placentals,\r\ndiffering from the beginning, arose out of several distinct groups of\r\nMarsupials, so that the placenta itself was formed several times\r\nindependently. This opinion is maintained by Huxley, the most eminent\r\nEnglish zoologist, and by many others. In this case the Indeciduata and\r\nthe Deciduata would perhaps have to be considered as two completely\r\ndistinct groups; then the order of Hoofed animals, as the primary group\r\nof the Indeciduata, might be supposed to have originated out of the\r\nMarsupial hoofed animals (Barypoda). Among the Deciduata, on the other\r\nhand, the order of Semi-apes, as the common primary form of the other\r\norders, might possibly have arisen out of Handed Marsupials (Pedimana).\r\nBut it is also conceivable that the Deciduata themselves have arisen out\r\nof several different orders of Marsupials, Animals of Prey out of\r\nRapacious Marsupials, Gnawing animals out of Gnawing Marsupials,\r\nSemi-apes out of Handed Marsupials, etc. As we do not at present possess\r\nsufficient empiric material to solve this most difficult question, we\r\nmust leave it and turn our attention to the history of the different\r\norders of Placental animals, whose pedigree can often be very accurately\r\nestablished in detail.\r\n\r\nWe must, as already remarked, consider the order of _Hoofed animals_\r\n(Ungulata) as the primary group of the Indeciduata, or Tuft-placentals;\r\nthe two other orders, Whales and Toothless animals, developed out of\r\nthem, as two diverging groups, probably only at a later period, by\r\nadaptation to very different modes of life. But it is also possible that\r\nthe animals poor in teeth (Edentata) may be of quite a different origin.\r\n\r\nHoofed animals are in many respects among the most important and the\r\nmost interesting Mammals. They distinctly show that a true understanding\r\nof the natural relationship of animals can never be revealed to us\r\nmerely by the study of living forms, but in all cases only by an equal\r\nconsideration of their extinct and fossil blood-relations and ancestors.\r\nIf, as is usually done, only the living Hoofed animals are taken into\r\nconsideration, it seems quite natural to divide them into three entirely\r\ndistinct orders, namely: (1) Horses, or _Single-hoofed animals_\r\n(Solidungula, or Equina); (2) Ruminating animals, or _Double-hoofed_\r\n(Bisulca, or Ruminantia); and (3) Thick-skinned, or _Many-hoofed_\r\n(Multungula, or Pachyderma). But as soon as the extinct Hoofed animals\r\nof the tertiary period are taken into consideration—of which animals we\r\npossess very numerous and important remains—it is seen that this\r\ndivision, but more especially the limitation of the Thick-skinned\r\nanimals, is completely artificial, and that these three groups are\r\nmerely top branches lopped from the pedigree of Hoofed animals, which\r\nare most closely connected by extinct intermediate forms. The one half\r\nof the Thick-skinned animals—rhinoceroses, tapirs, and\r\npalæotheria—manifest the closest relationships to horses, and have like\r\nthem odd-toed feet; whereas the other half of the Thick-skinned\r\nanimals—pigs, hippopotami, and anoplotheria—on account of their\r\ndouble-toed feet are much more closely allied to ruminating animals than\r\nto the former. Hence we must, in the first place, among Hoofed animals\r\ndistinguish the two orders of Paired-hoofs and Odd-hoofs, as two natural\r\ngroups, which developed as diverging branches out of the old tertiary\r\nprimary group of Primary Hoofed animals, or Prochela.\r\n\r\nThe order of _Odd-hoofed animals_ (Perissodactyla) comprises those\r\nUngulata in which the middle (or third) toe of the foot is much more\r\nstrongly developed than the others, so that it forms the actual centre\r\nof the hoof. This order includes the very ancient, common, primary group\r\nof all Hoofed animals, that is, the _Primary-hoofed animals_ (Prochela),\r\nwhich are found in a fossil state in the oldest Eocene strata\r\n(Lophiodon, Coryphodon, Pliolophus). Directly allied to this group is\r\nthat branch which is the actual primary form of the Odd-hoofed animals,\r\nnamely, the _Palæotheria_, fossils of which occur in the upper Eocene\r\nand lower Miocene. Out of the Palæotheria, at a later period, the\r\nrhinoceroses (Nasicornia) and rhinoceros-horses (Elasmotherida) on the\r\none hand, and the tapirs, lama-tapirs, and primæval horses, on the\r\nother, developed as two diverging branches. The long since extinct\r\nprimæval horses, or Anchitheria, formed the transition from the\r\nPalæotheria and tapirs to the Miocene horses, or hipparions, which are\r\nclosely allied to the genuine living horses.\r\n\r\nThe second main group of Hoofed animals, the order of _Pair-hoofed\r\nanimals_ (Artiodactyla), comprises those hoofed animals in which the\r\nmiddle (third) and fourth toe of the foot are almost equally developed,\r\nso that the space between the two forms the central line of the entire\r\nfoot. The order is divided into two sub-orders—the Pig-shaped and the\r\nCud-chewing, or Ruminating. The _Pig-shaped_ (Chœromorpha) comprise in\r\nthe first place the other branch of Primary-Hoofed-animals, the\r\n_Anoplotheria_, which we consider as the common primary form of all\r\nPair-hoofed animals, or Artiodactyla (Dichobune, etc.). Out of the\r\nAnoplotheria arose, as two diverging branches, the primæval swine, or\r\nAnthracotheria, on the one hand, forming the transition to swine and\r\nriver-horses, and the Xiphodonta on the other hand, forming the\r\ntransition to Ruminating animals. The oldest _Ruminating animals_\r\n(Ruminantia) are the Primæval Stags, or Dremotheria, out of which,\r\npossibly, the stag-shaped (Elaphia), the hollow-horned (Cavicornia), and\r\ncamels (Tylopoda), have developed as three diverging branches. Yet these\r\nlatter are, in many respects, more allied to the Odd-hoofs than to the\r\ngenuine Pair-hoofs. The accompanying systematic survey on p. 252, will\r\nshow how the numerous families of Hoofed animals are grouped, in\r\ncorrespondence with this genealogical hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n  _Of the Sections and Families of Hoofed Animals, or Ungulata._\r\n\r\n  (N.B.

Although these animals seem externally very like many\r\ngenuine Fish, yet they are, as even Aristotle perceived, genuine\r\nMammals. By their whole internal structure—in so far as it has not\r\nbecome changed by adaptation to an aquatic life—they, of all known\r\nMammals, are most closely allied to Hoofed animals, and more especially\r\nagree with them in the absence of the decidua and in the tufted\r\nplacenta. Even at the present day the river-horse (Hippopotamus)\r\nconstitutes a kind of transition form to the Sea Cows (Sirenia), and\r\nfrom this it seems most probable that the extinct primary forms of the\r\nCetacea are most closely allied to the Sea Cows of the present day, and\r\nthat they developed out of Pair-hoofed animals, which were related to\r\nthe hippopotamus. Out of the order of _Herbivorous whales_\r\n(Phycoceta)—to which the sea cows belong, and which accordingly, very\r\nprobably, contain the primary forms of the legion—the other order of\r\n_Carnivorous whales_ (Sarcoceta) appears to have developed at a later\r\nperiod. But Huxley thinks that these latter were of quite a different\r\norigin, and that they arose out of the Carnaria through the Seals. Among\r\nthe Sarcoceta, the extinct gigantic Zeuglodonta (Zeugloceta)—whose\r\nfossil skeletons some time ago excited great interest, it being thought\r\nthat they were “sea serpents”—are probably only a peculiarly developed\r\nlateral branch of genuine whales (Autoceta), which comprise, besides the\r\ncolossal whalebone whales, the cachalot or spermaceti whales, dolphins,\r\nnarwhals, porpoises, etc.\r\n\r\nThe third legion of the Indeciduata, or Sparsi-placentalia, comprises\r\nthe strange group of the animals _poor in teeth_ (Edentata); it is\r\ncomposed of the two orders of burrowers and sloths. The order of\r\n_Burrowers_ (Effodientia) consists of the two sub-orders of _ant eaters_\r\n(Vermilinguia), to which the scaled animals also belong, and the _girdle\r\nanimals_ (Cingulata), which were formerly represented by the gigantic\r\nGlyptodons. The order of _Sloths_ (Tardigrada) consists of the two\r\nsub-orders of the small, still living _dwarf sloths_ (Bradypoda), and\r\nof the extinct unwieldy _giant sloths_ (Gravigrada). The enormous fossil\r\nremains of these colossal herbivora suggest that the whole legion is\r\nbecoming extinct, and that the Edentata of the present day are but a\r\npoor remnant of the mighty order of the diluvial period. The close\r\nrelations between the still living South American Edentata and the\r\nextinct gigantic forms which are found beside the latter on the same\r\npart of the globe, made such an impression upon Darwin on his first\r\nvisit to South America, that they even then suggested to him the\r\nfundamental idea of the Theory of Descent. (See above, vol. i. p. 134.)\r\nBut it is precisely the genealogy of this legion which is most\r\ndifficult. The Edentata are perhaps nothing but a peculiarly developed\r\nlateral branch of the Ungulata; but it may also be that their root lies\r\nin quite another direction.\r\n\r\nWe now leave the first main group of Placental animals, the Indeciduata,\r\nand turn to the second main group, namely, the Deciduata, or animals\r\nwith decidua, which are distinguished from the former by possessing a\r\ndeciduous membrane, or decidua, during their embryonal life. We here\r\nmeet with a very remarkable small group of animals, for the most part\r\nextinct, and which probably were the old tertiary (or eocene) ancestors\r\nof man. These are the Semi-apes, or Lemurs (Prosimiæ); these curious\r\nanimals are probably the but little changed descendants of the primæval\r\ngroup of Placentalia which we have to consider as the common primary\r\nform of all Deciduata. They have hitherto been classed together in the\r\nsame order with Apes which Blumenbach called Quadrumana (four-handed).\r\nHowever, I regard them as entirely distinct from these, not merely\r\nbecause they differ from all Apes, much more than do the most different\r\nApes from one another, but also because they comprise most interesting\r\ntransitional forms leading to the other orders of Deciduata. I conclude\r\nfrom this that the few still living Semi-apes, which moreover differ\r\nvery much among one another, are the last surviving remnants of a\r\nprimary group now almost extinct, but which was at one time rich in\r\nforms, and out of which all the other Deciduata (possibly with the\r\nsingle exception of Beasts of Prey, and Pseudo-hoofed animals) have\r\ndeveloped as diverging branches. The old primary group of Semi-apes has\r\nprobably developed out of Handed or Ape-footed Marsupials (Pedimana),\r\nwhich are surprisingly like them in the transformation of their hinder\r\nfeet into grasping hands. The primæval primary forms themselves (which\r\nprobably originated in the eocene period) are of course long since\r\nextinct, as are also the greater portion of the transition-forms between\r\nthem and all the other orders of Deciduata. However, individual remnants\r\nof the latter are preserved among the Semi-apes of the present day.\r\nAmong these, the remarkable Finger-animal of Madagascar (Chiromys\r\nmadagascariensis) constitutes the remnant of the group of the\r\nLeptodactyla and the transition to Rodents. The strange flying lemur in\r\nthe South Sea and Sunda islands (Galeopithecus), the only remnant of the\r\ngroup of Pteropleura, forms a perfect intermediate stage between\r\nSemi-apes and Bats. The long-footed Semi-apes (Tarsius, Otolicnus)\r\nconstitute the last remnant of that primary branch (Macrotarsi) out of\r\nwhich the Insectivora developed. The short-footed forms (Brachytarsi)\r\nare the medium of connection between them and genuine Apes. The\r\nShort-footed Semi-apes comprise the long-tailed Lemur, the short-tailed\r\nLichanotus, and the Stenops, the latter of which seems to be very\r\nclosely allied to the probable ancestors of man among the Semi-apes. The\r\nshort-footed as well as the long-footed Prosimiæ live widely distributed\r\nover the islands of southern Asia and Africa, more especially in\r\nMadagascar; some live also on the continent of Africa. No Semi-ape,\r\neither living or in a fossil state, has as yet been found in America.\r\nThey all lead a solitary, nocturnal kind of life, and climb about on\r\ntrees. (Compare vol. i. p. 361.)\r\n\r\nAmong the six remaining orders of Deciduata, all of which are probably\r\nderived from long since extinct Semi-apes, the order of _Gnawing\r\nanimals_ (Rodentia), which is rich in forms, has remained at the lowest\r\nstage. Among these the _squirrel-like_ animals (Sciuromorpha) stand\r\nnearest akin to the Pedimanous Marsupials. Out of this primary group the\r\n_mouse-like_ animals (Myomorpha) and the _porcupine-like_ animals\r\n(Hystricomorpha) developed probably as two diverging branches, the\r\nformer of which are directly connected with the squirrel-like animals,\r\nby the eocene Myoxida, the latter by the eocene Psammoryctida. The\r\nfourth sub-order, the _hare-like_ animals (Lagomorpha), probably\r\ndeveloped only at a later period out of one of the other three\r\nsub-orders.\r\n\r\nVery closely allied to the Rodentia is the remarkable order of\r\n_Pseudo-hoofed animals_ (Chelophora). Of these there now live but two\r\ngenera, indigenous to Asia and Africa, namely, Elephants (Elephas), and\r\nRock Conies (Hyrax). Both have hitherto generally been classed among\r\nreal Hoofed animals, or Ungulata, with which they agree in the formation\r\nof the feet. But an identical transformation of nails or claws into\r\nhoofs occurs also in genuine Rodentia and in certain hoofed Rodentia\r\n(Subungulata) which live exclusively in South America. Beside smaller\r\nforms (for example, guinea pigs and gold hares) the Subungulata also\r\ninclude the largest of all Rodentia, namely, the Capybara Rats, which\r\nare about four feet in length. The Rock Conies, which are externally\r\nvery nearly akin to Rodents, especially to the hoofed Rodents, were\r\nformerly classed among Rodentia by some celebrated zoologists, as an\r\nespecial sub-class (Lamnungia). Elephants, on the other hand, when not\r\nclassed among Hoofed animals, were generally considered as the\r\nrepresentatives of a special order which were called Trunked animals\r\n(Proboscidea). But the formation of the placentas of Elephants and of\r\nHyrax agree in a remarkable manner, and are entirely distinct from those\r\nof Hoofed animals. These latter never possess a decidua, whereas\r\nElephants and Hyrax are genuine Deciduata. Their placenta is indeed not\r\nof the form of a disc, but of a girdle, as in the case of Animals of\r\nPrey; it is very possible that the girdle-shaped placenta is but a\r\nsecondary development of the discoplacenta. Thus, then, it might be\r\nthought that the Pseudo-hoofed animals have developed out of a branch of\r\nthe Rodentia, and in a similar manner perhaps the Carnivora out of a\r\nbranch of the Insectivora. At all events, Elephants and Hyrax in many\r\nrespects, especially in the formation of important skeletal parts, of\r\nthe limbs, etc., are more closely allied to the Rodentia, and more\r\nespecially to hoofed Rodentia, than to genuine Hoofed animals. Moreover\r\nseveral extinct forms, especially the remarkable South American\r\nArrow-toothed animals (Toxodontia), stand in many respects midway\r\nbetween Elephants and Rodentia. That the still living Elephants and\r\nHyrax are but the last survivors of a group of Pseudo-hoofed animals,\r\nwhich was once rich in forms, is proved not only by the very numerous\r\nfossil species of Elephants and Mastodon (some of which are even larger,\r\nothers also much smaller than the Elephants of the present day), but\r\nalso by the remarkable miocene _Dinotheria_ (Gonyognatha), between which\r\nand their next kindred, the Elephants, there must be a long series of\r\nunknown connecting intermediate forms. Taking all things into\r\nconsideration, the most probable hypothesis which can be established at\r\npresent as to the origin and the relationship of Elephants, Dinotheria,\r\nToxodon, and Hyrax is, that they are the last survivors of a group of\r\nPseudo-hoofed animals rich in forms, which developed out of the\r\nRodentia, and probably out of relatives of the Subungulata.\r\n\r\nThe order of _Insect Eaters_ (Insectivora) is a very ancient group, and\r\nis next akin to the common extinct primary form of the Deciduata, as\r\nwell as to the Semi-apes of the present day. It has probably developed\r\nout of Semi-apes which were closely allied to the Long-footed Lemurs\r\n(Macrotarsi) of the present day. It is separated into two orders,\r\nMenotyphla and Lipotyphla; the Menotyphla are probably the older of the\r\ntwo, and are distinguished from the Lipotyphla by possessing an\r\nintestinal cœcum, or typhlon. The Menotyphla include the climbing\r\nTupajas of the Sunda Isles, and the leaping Macroscelides of Africa. The\r\nLipotyphla are represented in our country by shrew mice, moles, and\r\nhedgehogs. The Insectivora, in the formation of their jaws and their\r\nmode of life, are nearly akin to Carnivora, but are, on the other hand,\r\nby their discoplacentas and by their large seminal vesicles, allied to\r\nRodents.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the order of _Rapacious animals_ (Carnaria)\r\ndeveloped out of a long since extinct branch of Insectivora, at the\r\nbeginning of the Eocene period. It is a natural group, very rich in\r\nforms, but still of very uniform organization. The Rapacious animals are\r\nsometimes also called Girdle-placentals (Zonoplacentals), although the\r\nPseudo-hoofed animals (Chelophora), in the same way, also deserve this\r\ndesignation. But as the latter, in other respects, are more closely\r\nallied to the Rodentia than to Carnaria, we have already discussed them\r\nin connection with the former. Animals of prey are divided into two,\r\nexternally very different, but internally very closely related,\r\nsub-orders, namely, Land animals of prey and Marine animals of prey. The\r\n_Land animals of prey_ (Carnivora) comprise bears, dogs, cats, etc.,\r\nwhose pedigree can be approximately guessed at by means of many extinct\r\nintermediate forms. The _Marine animals of prey_, or _Seals_\r\n(Pinnipedia), comprise sea bears, sea dogs, sea lions, and walruses.\r\nAlthough marine animals of prey appear externally very unlike land\r\nanimals of prey, yet by their internal structure, their jaw and their\r\npeculiar girdle-shaped placenta, they are very nearly akin to them, and\r\nhave evidently originated out of a branch of them, probably out of a\r\nkind of weasel (Mustelina). Even at the present day the fish otters\r\n(Lutra), and still more so the sea otters (Enhydris), present a direct\r\nform of transition to Seals, and clearly show how the bodies of land\r\nCarnivora are transformed into the shape of a Seal, by adaptation to an\r\naquatic life, and how the steering fins of marine rapacious animals have\r\narisen out of the legs of the former. The latter consequently stand in\r\nthe same relation to the former as do the Whales to Hoofed animals\r\namong the Indeciduata. In the same way as the river-horse at present\r\nstands midway between the extreme branches of oxen and sea oxen, the sea\r\notter still forms a surviving intermediate stage between the widely\r\nseparated branches of dogs and sea dogs. In both cases the complete\r\ntransformation of the external form, consequent upon adaptation to\r\nentirely different conditions of life, has not been able to efface the\r\nsolid foundation of the inherited internal peculiarities.\r\n\r\nAccording to Huxley’s opinion, which has already been quoted, only the\r\nHerbivorous Whales (Sirenia) are derived from Hoofed animals; on the\r\nother hand, the Carnivorous Cetacea (Sarcoceta) are derived from the\r\nmarine animals of prey; the Zeuglodonts would form a transition between\r\nthe two latter. But in this case it would be difficult to understand the\r\nclose anatomical relations which exist between the Herbivorous and\r\nCarnivorous Cetacea. The strange peculiarities in the internal and\r\nexternal structure which so strikingly distinguish the two groups from\r\nall other mammals would then have to be regarded only as _analogies_\r\n(caused by the same kinds of adaptation), not as _homologies_\r\n(transmitted from a common primary form). The latter, however, strikes\r\nme as being by far the more probable, and hence I have left all the\r\nCetacea among the Indeciduata as one group of kindred origin.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable order of _Flying Mammals_, or _Bats_ (Chiroptera), stands\r\nnear to the Carnaria as well as to the Insectivora. It has become\r\nstrikingly transformed by adaptation to a flying mode of life, just as\r\nmarine animals of prey have become modified by adaptation to a swimming\r\nmode of life. This order probably also originated out of the Semi-apes,\r\nwith which it is even at present closely allied, through the flying\r\nlemurs (Galeopithecus). Of the two orders of flying animals, the\r\ninsect-eating forms, or _flying mice_ (Nycterides), probably developed\r\nout of those eating fruits, or _flying foxes_ (Pterocynes); for the\r\nlatter are, in many ways, more closely allied to Semi-apes than are the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nWe have now still to discuss the genuine Apes (Simiæ) as the last order\r\nof Mammals; but as, according to the zoological system, the human race\r\nbelongs to this order, and as it undoubtedly developed historically out\r\nof a branch of this order, we shall devote a special chapter to a more\r\ncareful examination of its pedigree and history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND PEDIGREE OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Application of the Theory of Descent to Man.—Its Immense\r\n  Importance and Logical Necessity.—Man’s Position in the Natural\r\n  System of Animals, among Disco-placental Animals.—Incorrect\r\n  Separation of the Bimana and Quadrumana.—Correct Separation of\r\n  Semi-apes from Apes.—Man’s Position in the Order of\r\n  Apes.—Narrow-nosed Apes (of the Old World) and Flat-nosed Apes\r\n  (of America).—Difference of the two Groups.—Origin of Man from\r\n  Narrow-nosed Apes.—Human Apes, or Anthropoides.—African Human\r\n  Apes (Gorilla and Chimpanzee).—Asiatic Human Apes (Orang and\r\n  Gibbon).—Comparison between the different Human Apes and the\r\n  different Races of Men.—Survey of the Series of the Progenitors\r\n  of Man.—Invertebrate Progenitors (Prochordata) and Vertebrate\r\n  Progenitors.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the individual questions answered by the Theory of Descent, of\r\nall the special inferences drawn from it, there is none of such\r\nimportance as the application of this doctrine to Man himself. As I\r\nremarked at the beginning of this treatise, the inexorable necessity of\r\nthe strictest logic forces us to draw the special deductive conclusion\r\nfrom the general inductive law of the theory, that Man has developed\r\ngradually, and step by step, out of the lower Vertebrata, and more\r\nimmediately out of Ape-like Mammals. That this doctrine is an\r\ninseparable part of the Theory of Descent, and hence also of the\r\nuniversal Theory of Development in general, is recognized by all\r\nthoughtful adherents of the theory, as well as by all its opponents who\r\nreason logically.\r\n\r\nBut if the doctrine be true, then the recognition of the animal origin\r\nand pedigree of the human race will necessarily affect more deeply than\r\nany other progress of the human mind the views we form of all human\r\nrelations, and the aims of all human science. It must sooner or later\r\nproduce a complete revolution in the conception entertained by man of\r\nthe entire universe. I am firmly convinced that in future this immense\r\nadvance in our knowledge will be regarded as the beginning of a new\r\nperiod of the development of Mankind. It can only be compared to the\r\ndiscovery made by Copernicus, who was the first who ventured distinctly\r\nto express the opinion, that it was not the sun which moved round the\r\nearth, but the earth round the sun. Just as the _geocentric conception_\r\nof the universe—namely, the false opinion that the earth was the centre\r\nof the universe, and that all its other portions revolved round the\r\nearth—was overthrown by the system of the universe established by\r\nCopernicus and his followers, so the _anthropocentric conception_ of the\r\nuniverse—the vain delusion that Man is the centre of terrestrial nature,\r\nand that its whole aim is merely to serve him—is overthrown by the\r\napplication (attempted long since by Lamarck) of the theory of descent\r\nto Man. As Copernicus’ system of the universe was mechanically\r\nestablished by Newton’s theory of gravitation, we see Lamarck’s theory\r\nof descent attain its causal establishment by Darwin’s theory of\r\nselection. This comparison, which is very interesting in many respects,\r\nI have discussed in detail elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out this extremely important application of the Theory\r\nof Descent to man, with the necessary impartiality and objectivity, I\r\nmust above all beg the reader (at least for a short time) to lay aside\r\nall traditional and customary ideas on the “Creation of Man,” and to\r\ndivest himself of the deep-rooted prejudices concerning it, which are\r\nimplanted in the mind in earliest youth. If he fail to do this, he\r\ncannot objectively estimate the weight of the scientific arguments which\r\nI shall bring forward in favour of the animal derivation of Man, that\r\nis, of his origin out of Ape-like Mammals. We cannot here do better than\r\nimagine ourselves with Huxley to be the inhabitants of another planet,\r\nwho, taking the opportunity of a scientific journey through the\r\nuniverse, have arrived upon the earth and have there met with a peculiar\r\ntwo-legged mammal called Man, diffused over the whole earth in great\r\nnumbers. In order to examine him zoologically, we should pack a number\r\nof the individuals of different ages and from different lands (as we\r\nshould do with the other animals collected on the earth) into large\r\nvessels filled with spirits of wine, and on our return to our own planet\r\nwe should commence the comparative anatomy of all these terrestrial\r\nanimals quite objectively. As we should have no personal interest in\r\nMan, in a creature so entirely different from ourselves, we should\r\nexamine and criticise him as impartially and objectively as we should\r\nthe other terrestrial animals. In doing this we should, of course, in\r\nthe first place refrain from all conjectures and speculations on the\r\nnature of his soul, or on the spiritual side of his nature, as it is\r\nusually called. We should occupy ourselves solely with his bodily\r\nstructure, and with that natural conception of it which is offered by\r\nthe history of his individual development.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in order correctly to determine Man’s position among\r\nthe other terrestrial organisms we must, in the first place, follow the\r\nguidance of the natural system. We must endeavour to determine the\r\nposition which belongs to Man in the natural system of animals as\r\naccurately and distinctly as possible. We shall then, if in fact the\r\ntheory of descent be correct, be able from his position in the system to\r\ndetermine the real primary relationship, and the degree of consanguinity\r\nconnecting Man with the animals most like him. The hypothetical pedigree\r\nof the human race will then follow naturally as the final result of this\r\nanatomical and systematic inquiry.\r\n\r\nNow if, by means of comparative anatomy and ontogeny, we seek for man’s\r\nposition in that Natural System of animals which formed the subject of\r\nthe last two chapters, the incontrovertible fact will at once present\r\nitself to us, that man belongs to the tribe, or phylum, of the\r\nVertebrata. Every one of the characteristics, which so strikingly\r\ndistinguish all the Vertebrata from all Invertebrata, is possessed by\r\nhim. It has also never been doubted that of all the Vertebrata the\r\nMammals are most closely allied to Man, and that he possesses all the\r\ncharacteristic features distinguishing them from all other Vertebrata.\r\nIf then we further carefully examine the three different main groups or\r\nsub-classes of Mammals—the inter-connections of which were discussed in\r\nour last chapter—there cannot be the slightest doubt that Man belongs to\r\nthe Placentals, and shares with all other Placentals, the important\r\ncharacteristics which distinguish them from Marsupials and from\r\nCloacals. Finally, of the two main groups of placental Mammals, the\r\nDeciduata and the Indeciduata, the group of Deciduata doubtless includes\r\nMan. For the human embryo is developed with a genuine decidua, and is\r\nthus absolutely distinguished from all the Indeciduata. Among the\r\nDeciduata we distinguish two legions, the Zonoplacentalia, with\r\ngirdle-shaped placenta (Beasts of Prey and Pseudo-hoofed animals), and\r\nthe Discoplacentalia, with disc-shaped placenta (all the remaining\r\nDeciduata). Man possesses a disc-shaped placenta, like all\r\nDiscoplacentalia; and thus our next question must be, What is man’s\r\nposition in this group?\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we distinguished the following five orders of\r\nDiscoplacentalia: (1) Semi-apes; (2) Rodents; (3) Insectivora; (4) Bats;\r\n(5) Apes. The last of these five orders, that of Apes, is, as every one\r\nknows, in every bodily feature far more closely allied to Man than the\r\nfour others. Hence the only remaining question now is, whether, in the\r\nsystem of animals, Man is to be directly classed in the order of genuine\r\nApes, or whether he is to be considered as the representative of a\r\nspecial sixth order of Discoplacentalia, allied to, but more advanced\r\nthan, that of the Apes.\r\n\r\nLinnæus in his system classed Man in the same order with genuine Apes,\r\nSemi-apes, and Bats, which he called _Primates_; that is, lords, as it\r\nwere the highest dignitaries of the animal kingdom. But Blumenbach, of\r\nGöttingen, separated Man as a special order, under the name of _Bimana_,\r\nor two-handed, and contrasted him with the Apes and Semi-apes under the\r\nname of _Quadrumana_, or four-handed. This classification was also\r\nadopted by Cuvier and, consequently, by most subsequent zoologists. It\r\nwas not until 1863 that Huxley, in his excellent work, the “Evidence as\r\nto Man’s Place in Nature,”(26) showed that this classification was based\r\nupon erroneous ideas, and that the so-called “four-handed” Apes and\r\nSemi-apes are “two-handed” as much as man is himself. The difference\r\nbetween the foot and hand does not consist in the _physiological_\r\npeculiarity that the first digit or thumb is opposable to the four other\r\ndigits or fingers in the hand, and is not so in the foot, for there are\r\nwild tribes of men who can oppose the first or large toe to the other\r\nfour, just as if it were a thumb. They can therefore use their “grasping\r\nfoot” as well as a so-called “hinder hand,” like Apes. The Chinese\r\nboatmen row with this hinder hand, the Bengal workmen weave with it. The\r\nNegro, in whom the big toe is especially strong and freely moveable,\r\nwhen climbing seizes hold of the branches of the trees with it, just\r\nlike the “four-handed” Apes. Nay, even the newly born children of the\r\nmost highly developed races of men, during the first months of their\r\nlife, grasp as easily with the “hinder hand” as with the “fore hand,”\r\nand hold a spoon placed in its clutch as firmly with their big toe as\r\nwith the thumb! On the other hand, among the higher Apes, especially the\r\ngorilla, hand and foot are differentiated as in man. (Compare Plate IV.)\r\n\r\nThe essential difference between hand and foot is therefore not\r\nphysiological, but _morphological_, and is determined by the\r\ncharacteristic structure of the bony skeleton and of the muscles\r\nattached to it. The ankle-bones differ from the wrist-bones in\r\narrangement, and the foot possesses three special muscles not existing\r\nin the hand (a short flexor muscle, a short extensor muscle, and a long\r\nfibular muscle). In all these respects, Apes and Semi-apes entirely\r\nagree with man, and hence it was quite erroneous to separate him from\r\nthem as a special order on account of the stronger differentiation of\r\nhis hand and foot. It is the same also with all the other structural\r\nfeatures by means of which it was attempted to distinguish Man from\r\nApes; for example, the relative length of the limbs, the structure of\r\nthe skull, of the brain, etc. In all these respects, without exception,\r\nthe differences between Man and the higher Apes are less than the\r\ncorresponding differences between the higher and the lower Apes. Hence\r\nHuxley, for reasons based on the most careful and most accurate\r\nanatomical comparisons, arrives at the extremely important\r\nconclusion—“Thus, whatever system of organs be studied, the comparison\r\nof their modifications in the Ape series leads to one and the same\r\nresult, that the structural differences which separate Man from the\r\nGorilla and Chimpanzee are not so great as those which separate the\r\nGorilla from the lower Apes.” In accordance with this, Huxley, strictly\r\nfollowing the demands of logic, classes Man, Apes, and Semi-apes in a\r\nsingle order, _Primates_, and divides it into the following seven\r\nfamilies, which are of almost equal systematic value: (1) Anthropini\r\n(Man); (2) Catarrhini (genuine Apes of the Old World); (3) Platyrrhini\r\n(genuine American Apes); (4) Arctopitheci (American clawed Apes); (5)\r\nLemurini (short-footed and long-footed Semi-apes, p. 255); (6)\r\nChiromyini (p. 256); (7) Galeopithecini (Flying Lemurs, p. 256).\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the Families and Genera of Apes._\r\n\r\n\r\n  -----------------+------------------------+---------------------+------------------\r\n    _Sections_     |      _Families_        |      _Genera_       | _Systematic Name_\r\n       _of_        |         _of_           |        _of_         |       _of_\r\n      _Apes._      |        _Apes._         |       _Apes._       |  _the Genera._\r\n  -----------------+------------------------+---------------------+------------------\r\n  I.

For, as I have\r\nalready shown in my General Morphology, and explained in the last\r\nchapter, the Semi-apes differ in many and important respects from\r\nGenuine Apes, and in their individual forms are more closely allied to\r\nthe various other orders of Discoplacentalia. Hence the Semi-apes must\r\nprobably be considered as the remnants of the common primary group, out\r\nof which the other orders of Discoplacentalia, and, it may be, all\r\nDeciduata, have developed as two diverging branches. (Gen. Morph. ii.\r\npp. 148 and 153.) But man cannot be separated from the order of Genuine\r\nApes, or Simiæ, as he is in every respect more closely allied to the\r\nhigher Genuine Apes than the latter are to the lower Genuine Apes.\r\n\r\n_Genuine Apes_ (Simiæ) are universally divided into two perfectly\r\nnatural groups, namely, the Apes of the New World, or American Apes, and\r\nthe Apes of the Old World, which are indigenous to Asia and Africa, and\r\nwhich formerly also existed in Europe. These two classes differ\r\nprincipally in the formation of the nose, and they have been named\r\naccordingly. American Apes have flat noses, so that the nostrils are in\r\nfront, not below; hence they are called _Flat Noses_ (Platyrrhini). On\r\nthe other hand, the Apes of the Old World have a narrow cartilaginous\r\nbridge, and the nostrils turned downwards, as in man; they are,\r\ntherefore, called _Narrow Noses_ (Catarrhini). Further, the jaw, which\r\nplays an important part in the classification of Mammals, is essentially\r\ndistinct in these two groups. All Catarrhinæ, or Apes of the Old World,\r\nhave exactly the same jaws as Man, namely, in each jaw four incisors\r\nabove and below, then on each side a canine tooth and five cheek teeth,\r\nof which two are pre-molars and three molars, altogether thirty-two\r\nteeth. But all Apes of the New World, all Platyrrhini, have four more\r\ncheek teeth, namely, three pre-molars and three molars on each side,\r\nabove and below: they consequently possess thirty-six teeth. Only one\r\nsmall group forms an exception to this rule, namely, the _Arctopitheci_,\r\nor _Clawed Apes_, in whom the third molar has degenerated, and they\r\naccordingly have on each half of their jaw three pre-molars and two\r\nmolars. They also differ from the other Platyrrhini by having claws on\r\nthe fingers of their hands and the toes of their feet, not nails like\r\nMan and the other Apes. This small group of South American Apes, which\r\nincludes among others the well-known pretty little Midas-monkey and the\r\nJacchus, must probably be considered only as a peculiarly developed\r\nlateral branch of the Platyrrhini.\r\n\r\nNow, if we ask what evidence can be drawn, as to the pedigree of Apes,\r\nfrom the above facts, we must conclude that all the Apes of the New\r\nWorld have developed out of one tribe, for they all possess the\r\ncharacteristic jaw and the nasal formation of the Platyrrhini. In like\r\nmanner it follows that all the Apes of the Old World must be derived\r\nfrom one and the same common primary form, which possessed the same\r\nformation of nose and jaw as all the still living Catarrhini. Further,\r\nit can scarcely be doubted that the Apes of the New World, taken as an\r\nentire tribe, are either derived from those of the Old World, or (to\r\nexpress it more vaguely and cautiously) both are diverging branches of\r\none and the same tribe of Apes. We also arrive at the exceedingly\r\nimportant conclusion—which is of the utmost significance in regard to\r\nMan’s distribution on the earth’s surface—that Man _has developed out\r\nof the Catarrhini_. For we cannot discover a zoological character\r\ndistinguishing him in a higher degree from the allied Apes of the Old\r\nWorld than that in which the most divergent forms of this group are\r\ndistinguished from one another. This is the important result of Huxley’s\r\ncareful anatomical examination of the question, and it cannot be too\r\nhighly estimated. The anatomical differences between Man and the most\r\nhuman-like Catarrhini (Orang, Gorilla, Chimpanzee) are in every respect\r\nless than the anatomical differences between the latter and the lowest\r\nstages of Catarrhini, more especially the Dog-like Baboon. This\r\nexceedingly important conclusion is the result of an impartial\r\nanatomical comparison of the different forms of Catarrhini.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we recognise the natural system of animals as the guide\r\nto our speculations, and establish upon it our pedigree, we must\r\nnecessarily come to the conclusion that _the human race is a small\r\nbranch of the group of Catarrhini, and has developed out of long since\r\nextinct Apes of this group in the Old World_. Some adherents of the\r\nTheory of Descent have thought that the American races of Men have\r\ndeveloped, independently of those of the Old World, out of American\r\nApes. I consider this hypothesis to be quite erroneous, for the complete\r\nagreement of all mankind with the Catarrhini, in regard to the\r\ncharacteristic formation of the nose and jaws, distinctly proves that\r\nthey are of the same origin, and that they developed out of a common\r\nroot after the Platyrrhini, or American Apes, had already branched off\r\nfrom them. The primæval inhabitants of America, as is proved by numerous\r\nethnographical facts, immigrated from Asia, and partly perhaps from\r\nPolynesia (or even from Europe).\r\n\r\nThere still exist great difficulties in establishing an accurate\r\npedigree of the Human Race; this only can we further assert, that the\r\nnearest progenitors of man were tail-less Catarrhini (Lipocerca),\r\nresembling the still living Man-like Apes. These evidently developed at\r\na late period out of tailed Catarrhini (Menocerca), the original form of\r\nApe. Of those tail-less Catarrhini, which are now frequently called\r\nMan-like Apes, or Anthropoides, there still exist four different genera\r\ncontaining about a dozen different species.\r\n\r\nThe largest Man-like Ape is the famous _Gorilla_ (called Gorilla engena,\r\nor Pongo gorilla), which is indigenous to the tropics of western Africa,\r\nand was first discovered by the missionary, Dr. Savage, in 1847, on the\r\nbanks of the river Gaboon. Its nearest relative is the _Chimpanzee_\r\n(Engeco troglodytes, or Pongo troglodytes), also indigenous to western\r\nAfrica, but considerably smaller than the Gorilla, which surpasses man\r\nin size and strength. The third of the three large Man-like Apes is the\r\n_Orang_, or _Orang Outang_, indigenous to Borneo and the other Sunda\r\nIslands, of which two kindred species have recently been distinguished,\r\nnamely, the large Orang (Satyrus orang, or Pithecus satyrus) and the\r\nsmall Orang (Satyrus morio, or Pithecus morio). Lastly, there still\r\nexists in southern Asia the genus _Gibbon_ (Hylobates), of which from\r\nfour to eight different species are distinguished. They are considerably\r\nsmaller than the three first-named Anthropoides, and in most\r\ncharacteristics differ more from Man.\r\n\r\nThe tail-less Man-like Apes—especially since we have become more\r\nintimately acquainted with the Gorilla, and its connection with Man by\r\nthe application of the Theory of Descent—have excited such universal\r\ninterest, and called forth such a flood of writings, that there is no\r\noccasion for me here to enter into any detail about them. The reader\r\nwill find their relations to Man fully discussed in the excellent works\r\nof Huxley,(26) Carl Vogt,(27) Büchner,(43) and Rolle.(28) I shall\r\ntherefore confine myself to stating the most important general\r\nconclusion resulting from their thorough comparison with Man, namely,\r\nthat each one of the four Man-like Apes stands nearer to Man in one or\r\nseveral respects than the rest, but that no one of them can in every\r\nrespect be called absolutely the most like Man. The Orang stands nearest\r\nto Man in regard to the formation of the brain, the Chimpanzee in\r\nimportant characteristics in the formation of the skull, the Gorilla in\r\nthe development of the feet and hands, and, lastly, the Gibbon in the\r\nformation of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThus, from a careful examination of the comparative anatomy of the\r\nAnthropoides, we obtain a similar result to that obtained by Weisbach,\r\nfrom a statistical classification and a thoughtful comparison of the\r\nvery numerous and careful measurements which Scherzer and Schwarz made\r\nof the different races of Men during their voyage in the Austrian\r\nfrigate _Novara_ round the earth. Weisbach comprises the final result of\r\nhis investigations in the following words: “_The ape-like\r\ncharacteristics of Man_ are by no means concentrated in one or another\r\nrace, but are distributed in particular parts of the body, among the\r\ndifferent races, in such a manner that each is endowed with some\r\nheirloom of this relationship—one race more so, another less, and even\r\nwe Europeans cannot claim to be entirely free from evidences of this\r\nrelationship.”[5]\r\n\r\nI must here also point out, what in fact is self-evident, that not one\r\nof all the still living Apes, and consequently not one of the so-called\r\nMan-like Apes, can be the progenitor of the Human Race. This opinion, in\r\nfact, has never been maintained by thoughtful adherents of the Theory of\r\nDescent, but it has been assigned to them by their thoughtless\r\nopponents. The Ape-like progenitors of the Human Race are long since\r\nextinct. We may possibly still find their fossil bones in the tertiary\r\nrocks of southern Asia or Africa. In any case they will, in the\r\nzoological system, have to be classed in the group of _tail-less\r\nNarrow-nosed Apes_ (Catarrhini Lipocerci, or Anthropoides).\r\n\r\nThe genealogical hypotheses, to which we have thus far been led by the\r\napplication of the Theory of Descent to Man, present themselves to every\r\nclearly and logically reasoning person as the direct results from the\r\nfacts of comparative anatomy, ontogeny, and palæontology. Of course our\r\nphylogeny can indicate only in a very general way the outlines of the\r\nhuman pedigree. Phylogeny is the more in danger of becoming erroneous\r\nthe more rigorously it is applied in detail to special animal forms\r\nknown to us. However, we can, even now, with approximate certainty\r\ndistinguish at least the following twenty-two stages of the ancestors of\r\nMan. Fourteen of these stages belong to the Vertebrata, and eight to the\r\nInvertebrate ancestors of Man (Prochordata.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAIN OF THE ANIMAL ANCESTORS, OR THE SERIES OF THE PROGENITORS, OF\r\nMAN.\r\n\r\n(Comp. Ch. XX., XXI.; Plate XIV. and p. 22.)\r\n\r\nFIRST HALF OF THE SERIES OF THE ANCESTORS OF MAN.\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATE ANCESTORS OF MAN (Prochordata).\r\n\r\nFIRST STAGE: +Monera+.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient ancestors of Man, as of all other organisms, were\r\nliving creatures of the simplest kind imaginable, _organisms without\r\norgans_, like the still living Monera. They consisted of simple,\r\nhomogeneous, structureless and formless little lumps of mucous or\r\nalbuminous matter (protoplasm), like the still living Protamœba\r\nprimitiva. (Compare vol. i. p. 186, Fig. 1.) The _form value_ of these\r\nmost ancient ancestors of man was not even equal to that of a cell, but\r\nmerely that of a _cytod_ (compare vol. i. p. 347); for, as in the case\r\nof all Monera, the little lump of protoplasm did not as yet possess a\r\ncell-kernel. The first of these Monera _originated_ in the beginning of\r\nthe Laurentian period by _spontaneous generation_, or archigony, out of\r\nso-called “inorganic combinations,” namely, out of simple combinations\r\nof carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. The assumption of this\r\nspontaneous generation, that is, of a mechanical origin of the first\r\norganisms from inorganic matter, has been proved in our thirteenth\r\nchapter to be a necessary hypothesis. (Compare vol. i. p. 338.) A\r\ndirect _proof_ of the earlier existence of this most ancient ancestral\r\nstage, based upon the fundamental law of biogeny, is possibly still\r\nfurnished by the circumstance that, according to the assertions of many\r\ninvestigators, in the beginning of the development of the egg, the\r\ncell-kernel, or nucleus, disappears, and the egg-cell thus relapses to\r\nthe lower stage of the cytod (Monerula, p. 124; _relapse_ of the\r\nnucleated plastid into a non-nucleated condition). The assumption of\r\nthis first stage is necessary for most important general reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND STAGE: +Amœbæ+.\r\n\r\nThe second ancestral stage of Man, as of all the higher animals and\r\nplants, is formed by _a simple cell_, that is, a little piece of\r\nprotoplasm enclosing a kernel. There still exist large numbers of\r\nsimilar “single-celled organisms.” Among them the common, simple Amœbæ\r\n(vol. i. p. 188, Fig. 2) cannot have been essentially different from\r\nthese progenitors. The _form value_ of every Amœba is essentially the\r\nsame as that still possessed by the egg of Man, and by the egg of all\r\nother animals. (Vol. i. p. 189, Fig. 3.) The naked egg-cells of Sponges,\r\nwhich creep about exactly like Amœbæ, cannot be distinguished from them.\r\nThe egg-cell of Man, which like that of most other animals is surrounded\r\nby a membrane, resembles an enclosed Amœba. The first single-celled\r\nanimals of this kind arose out of Monera by the differentiation of the\r\ninner kernel and the external protoplasm; they lived in the earlier\r\nPrimordial period. An irrefutable proof that such single-celled primæval\r\nanimals really existed as the direct ancestors of Man, is furnished\r\naccording to the fundamental law of biogeny (vol. i. p. 309) by the\r\nfact that the human egg is nothing more than a simple cell. (Compare p.\r\n124.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD STAGE: +Synamœbæ+.\r\n\r\nIn order to form an approximate conception of the organisation of those\r\nancestors of Man which first developed out of the single-celled Primæval\r\nanimals, it is necessary to trace the changes undergone by the human egg\r\nin the beginning of its individual development. It is just here that\r\nontogeny guides us with the greatest certainty on to the track of\r\nphylogeny. We have already seen that the egg of Man (in the same way as\r\nthat of all other Mammals), after fructification has taken place, falls\r\nby self-division into a mass of simple and equi-formal Amœba-like cells\r\n(vol. i. p. 190, Fig. 4 _D_). All these divided globules are at first\r\nexactly like one another, naked cells containing a kernel, but without\r\ncovering; in many animals they show movements like those of the Amœbæ.\r\nThis ontogenetic stage of development which we called Morula (p. 125),\r\non account of its mulberry shape, is _a certain proof_ that in the early\r\nprimordial period there existed ancestors of man which possessed the\r\n_form value_ of a mass of homogeneous, loosely connected cells. They may\r\nbe called a _community of Amœbæ_ (Synamœbæ). (Compare p. 127.) They\r\n_originated_ out of the single-celled Primæval animals of the second\r\nstage by repeated self-division and by the permanent union of the\r\nproducts of this division.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH STAGE: +Ciliated Larva (Planæada)+.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the ontogenesis of most of the lower animals, and also\r\nin that of the lowest Vertebrate animals, the Lanceolate Animals, or\r\nAmphioxus, there first develops out of the Morula (Frontispiece, Fig. 3)\r\na ciliated larva (planula). Those cells, lying on the surface of the\r\nhomogeneous mass of cells, extend hair-like processes, or fringes of\r\nhairs, which by striking against the water keep the whole body rotating.\r\nThe round many-celled body thus becomes differentiated, in that the\r\nexternal cells covered with cilia differ from the non-ciliated internal\r\ncells (Frontispiece, Fig. 4). In Man and in all other Vertebrate animals\r\n(with the exception of the Amphioxus), as well as in all Arthropoda,\r\nthis stage of the ciliated larva has been lost, in the course of time,\r\nby abbreviated inheritance. There must, however, have existed ancestors\r\nof Man in the early Primordial period which possessed the form value of\r\nthese ciliated larvæ (Planæa, p. 125). A certain proof of this is\r\nfurnished by the Amphioxus, which is on the one hand related by blood to\r\nMan, but on the other has retained down to the present day the stage of\r\nthe planula.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH STAGE: +Primæval Stomach Animals (Gastræada)+.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the individual development of Amphioxus, as well as in\r\nthe most different lower animals, there first arises out of the planula\r\nthe extremely important form of larva which we have named _stomach\r\nlarva_, or _gastrula_ (p. 126; Frontispiece, Fig. 5, 6). According to\r\nthe fundamental law of biogeny this gastrula proves the former existence\r\nof an independent form of primæval animal of the same structure, and\r\nthis we have named primæval stomach animal, or Gastræa (pp. 127, 128).\r\nThese Gastræada must have existed during the older Primordial period,\r\nand they must have also included the ancestors of man. A _certain\r\nproof_ of this is furnished by the Amphioxus, which in spite of its\r\nblood relationship to Man still passes through the stage of the gastrula\r\nwith a simple intestine and a double intestinal wall. (Compare Plate X.\r\nFig. _B 4_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH STAGE: +Gliding Worms (Turbellaria)+.\r\n\r\nThe human ancestors of the sixth stage which originated out of the\r\nGastræada of the fifth stage, were low worms, which, of all the forms of\r\nworms known to us, were most closely allied to the Gliding Worms, or\r\nTurbellaria, or at least upon the whole possessed their form value. Like\r\nthe Turbellaria of the present day, the whole surface of their body was\r\ncovered with cilia, and they possessed a simple body of an oval shape,\r\nentirely without appendages. These acœlomatous worms did not as yet\r\npossess a true body-cavity (cœlom) nor blood. They _originated_ in the\r\nearly primordial period out of the Gastræada, by the formation of a\r\nmiddle germ-layer, or muscular layer, and also by the further\r\ndifferentiation of the internal parts into various organs; more\r\nespecially the first formation of a nervous system, the simplest organs\r\nof sense, the simplest organs for secretion (kidneys) and generation\r\n(sexual organs). The proof that human ancestors existed of a similar\r\nformation, is to be looked for in the circumstance that comparative\r\nanatomy and ontogeny point to the lower acœlomatous Worms as the common\r\nprimary form, not merely of all higher Worms, but also of the four\r\nhigher tribes of animals. Now, of all the animals known to us, the\r\nTurbellaria, which possess neither a body-cavity nor blood, are most\r\nclosely allied to these primæval acœlomatous Primary Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH STAGE: +Soft Worms (Scolecida)+.\r\n\r\nBetween the Turbellaria of the preceding stage and the Sack Worms of the\r\nnext stage, we must necessarily assume at least one connecting\r\nintermediate stage. For the Tunicata, which of all known animals stand\r\nnearest to the eighth stage, and the Turbellaria which most resemble the\r\nsixth stage, indeed both belong to the lower division of the unsegmented\r\nWorms; but still these two divisions differ so much from one another in\r\ntheir organization, that we must necessarily assume the earlier\r\nexistence of extinct intermediate forms between the two. These\r\nconnecting links, of which no fossil remains exist, owing to the soft\r\nnature of their bodies, we may comprise as _Soft Worms_, or Scolecida.\r\nThey developed out of the Turbellaria of the sixth stage by forming a\r\ntrue body-cavity (a cœlom) and blood in their interior. It is difficult\r\nto say which of the still living Cœlomati are nearest akin to these\r\nextinct Scolecida; it may be the Acorn-worms (Balanoglossus). The proof\r\nthat even the direct ancestors of man belonged to these Scolecida, is\r\nfurnished by the comparative anatomy and the ontogeny of Worms and of\r\nthe Amphioxus. The form value of this stage must moreover have been\r\nrepresented by several very different intermediate stages, in the wide\r\ngap between Turbellaria and Tunicata.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH STAGE: +Sack Worms (Himatega)+.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Sack worms, or Himatega, we here allude in the eighth\r\nplace to those Cœlomati, out of which the most ancient skull-less\r\nVertebrata were directly developed. Among the Cœlomati of the present\r\nday, the _Ascidians_ are the nearest relatives of these exceedingly\r\nremarkable Worms, which connect the widely differing classes of\r\nInvertebrate and Vertebrate animals. That the ancestors of man really\r\nexisted during the primordial period in the form of these Himatega, is\r\n_distinctly proved_ by the exceedingly remarkable and important\r\nagreement presented by the ontogeny of the Amphioxus and the Ascidia.\r\n(Compare Plates XII. and XIII., also pp. 152, 200, etc.) From this fact\r\nthe earlier existence of Sack Worms may be inferred; they of all known\r\nworms were most closely related to our recent Tunicates, especially to\r\nthe freely swimming young forms or larvæ of the simple Sea-squirts\r\n(Ascidia, Phallusia). They originated out of the worms of the seventh\r\nstage by the formation of a dorsal nerve-marrow (medulla tube), and by\r\nthe formation of the spinal rod (chorda dorsalis) which lies below it.\r\nIt is just the position of this central spinal rod, or axial skeleton,\r\nbetween the dorsal marrow on the dorsal side, and the intestinal canal\r\non the ventral side, which is most characteristic of all Vertebrate\r\nanimals, including man, but also of the larvæ of the Ascidia. The form\r\nvalue of this stage nearly corresponds with that which the larvæ of the\r\nsimple Sea-squirts possess at the time when they show the beginning of\r\nthe dorsal marrow and spinal rod. (Plate XII. Fig. _A 5_: compare the\r\nexplanation of these figures in the Appendix.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND HALF OF THE SERIES OF HUMAN ANCESTORS. VERTEBRATE ANIMAL\r\nANCESTORS OF MAN (Vertebrata).\r\n\r\nNINTH STAGE: +Skull-less Animals (Acrania)+.\r\n\r\nThe series of human ancestors, which in accordance with their whole\r\norganisation we have to consider as Vertebrate animals, begins with the\r\nSkull-less animals, or Acrania, of whose nature the still living\r\nLancelet (Amphioxus lanceolatus, Plate XII. _B_, XIII. _B_) gives us a\r\nfaint idea. Since this little animal in its earliest embryonal state\r\nentirely agrees with the Ascidia, and in its further development shows\r\nitself to be a true Vertebrate animal, it forms a direct transition from\r\nthe Vertebrata to the Invertebrata. Even if the human ancestors of the\r\nninth stage in many respects differed from the Amphioxus—the last\r\nsurviving representative of the Skull-less animals—yet they must have\r\nresembled it in its most essential characteristics, in the absence of\r\nhead, skull, and brain. Skull-less animals of such structure—out of\r\nwhich animals with skulls developed at a later period—lived during the\r\nprimordial period, and originated out of the Himatega of the eighth\r\nstage by the formation of the metamera, or body segments, as also by the\r\nfurther differentiation of all organs, especially the more perfect\r\ndevelopment of the dorsal nerve-marrow and the spinal rod lying below\r\nit. Probably the separation of the two sexes (gonochorism) also began at\r\nthis stage, whereas all the previously mentioned invertebrate ancestors\r\n(apart from the 3—4 first neutral stages) exhibited the condition of\r\nhermaphrodites (hermaphroditism). (Compare vol. i. p. 196.) The _certain\r\nproof_ of the former existence of these skull-less and brainless\r\nancestors of man, is furnished by the comparative anatomy and the\r\nontogeny of the Amphioxus and of the Craniota.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTH STAGE: +Single-nostriled Animals (Monorrhina)+.\r\n\r\nOut of the Skull-less ancestors of man there arose in the first place\r\nanimals with skulls, or Craniota, of the most imperfect nature. The\r\nlowest stage of all still living Craniota is occupied by the class of\r\nround-mouthed animals, or Cyclostoma, namely, the Hag (Myxinoidea) and\r\nLampreys (Petromyzontia). From the internal organization of these\r\nsingle-nostriled animals, or Monorrhina, we can form an approximate idea\r\nof the nature of the human ancestors of the tenth stage. In the former,\r\nas also in the latter, skull and brain must have been of the simplest\r\nform, and many important organs, as for example, the swimming bladder,\r\nthe sympathetic nerve, the spleen, the jaw skeleton, and both pairs of\r\nlegs, may probably as yet not have existed. However, the pouch gills and\r\nthe round sucking mouth of the Cyclostoma must probably be looked upon\r\nas purely adaptive characteristics, which did not exist in the\r\ncorresponding stage of ancestors. The single-nostriled animals\r\noriginated during the primordial period out of the skull-less animals by\r\nthe anterior end of the dorsal marrow developing into the brain, and the\r\nanterior end of the dorsal chord into the skull. The _certain proof_\r\nthat such single-nostriled and jawless ancestors of man did exist, is\r\nfound in the “comparative anatomy of the Myxinoidea.”\r\n\r\n\r\nELEVENTH STAGE: +Primæval Fish (Selachii.)+.\r\n\r\nOf all known Vertebrate animals, the ancestors of the Primæval Fish\r\nprobably showed most resemblance to the still living Sharks (Squalacei).\r\nThey _originated_ out of the single-nostriled animals by the division of\r\nthe single nostril into two lateral halves, by the formation of a\r\nsympathetic nervous system, a jaw skeleton, a swimming bladder, and two\r\npairs of legs (breast fins or fore-legs, and ventral fins or hind-legs).\r\nThe internal organisation of this stage may probably, upon the whole,\r\nhave corresponded to the lowest species of Sharks known to us; the\r\nswimming bladder was however more strongly developed; in the case of the\r\nlatter it exists only as a rudimentary organ. They _lived_ as early as\r\nthe Silurian period, as is proved by the fossil remains of sharks (teeth\r\nand fin spines) from the Silurian strata. A _certain proof_ that the\r\nSilurian ancestors of man and of all the other double-nostriled animals\r\nwere nearest akin to the Selachii, is furnished by the comparative\r\nanatomy of the latter; it shows that the relations of organisation in\r\nall Amphirrhina can be derived from those of the Selachii.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELFTH STAGE: +Mud Fish (Dipneusta)+.\r\n\r\nOur twelfth ancestral stage is formed by Vertebrate animals which\r\nprobably possessed a remote resemblance to the still living Salamander\r\nfish (Ceratodus, Protopterus, Lepidosiren, p. 212). They _originated_\r\nout of the Primæval fish (probably at the beginning of the palæolithic,\r\nor primary period) by adaptation to life on land, and by the\r\ntransformation of the swimming bladder into an air-breathing lung, and\r\nof the nasal cavity (which now opened into the cavity of the mouth)\r\ninto air passages. The series of the ancestors of man which breathed air\r\nthrough lungs began at this stage. Their organisation may probably in\r\nmany respects have agreed with that of the still living Ceratodus and\r\nProtopterus, but at the same time may have been very different. They\r\nprobably lived at the beginning of the Devonian period. Their existence\r\nis _proved_ by comparative anatomy, which shows the Dipneusta to be an\r\nintermediate stage between the Selachii and Amphibia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTEENTH STAGE: +Gilled Amphibians (Sozobranchia)+.\r\n\r\nOut of those Mud Fish, which we considered the primary forms of all the\r\nVertebrata which breathe through lungs, there developed the class of\r\nAmphibia as the main line (pp. 205, 216). Here began the five-toed\r\nformation of the foot (the Pentadactyla), which was thence transmitted\r\nto the higher Vertebrata, and finally also to Man. The gilled Amphibians\r\nmust be looked upon as our most ancient ancestors of the class of\r\nAmphibia; besides possessing lungs they retained throughout life regular\r\ngills, like the still living Proteus and Axolotl (p. 218). They\r\n_originated_ out of the Dipneusta by the transformation of the paddling\r\nfins into five-toed legs, and also by the more perfect differentiation\r\nof various organs, especially of the vertebral column. In any case they\r\nexisted about the middle of the palæolithic, or primary period, possibly\r\neven before the Coal period; for fossil Amphibia are found in coal. The\r\n_proof_ that similar gilled Amphibians were our direct ancestors, is\r\ngiven by the comparative anatomy and the ontogeny of Amphibia and\r\nMammals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTEENTH STAGE: +Tailed Amphibians (Sozura)+.\r\n\r\nOur amphibious ancestors which retained their gills throughout life,\r\nwere replaced at a later period by other Amphibia, which, by\r\nmetamorphosis, lost the gills which they had possessed in early life,\r\nbut retained the tail, as in the case of the salamanders and newts of\r\nthe present day. (Compare p. 218.) They _originated_ out of the gilled\r\nAmphibians by accustoming themselves in early life to breathe only\r\nthrough gills, and later in life only through lungs. They probably\r\nexisted even in the second half of the primary, namely, during the\r\nPermian period, but possibly even during the Coal period. The _proof_ of\r\ntheir existence lies in the fact that tailed Amphibians form a necessary\r\nintermediate link between the preceding and succeeding stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTEENTH STAGE: +Primæval Amniota (Protamnia)+.\r\n\r\nThe name Protamnion we have given to the primary form of the three\r\nhigher classes of Vertebrate animals, out of which the Proreptilia and\r\nthe Promammalia developed as two diverging branches (p. 222). It\r\n_originated_ out of unknown tailed Amphibia by the complete loss of the\r\ngills, by the formation of the amnion, of the cochlea, and of the round\r\nwindow in the auditory organ, and of the organs of tears. It probably\r\noriginated in the beginning of the mesolithic or secondary period,\r\nperhaps even towards the end of the primary, in the Permian period. The\r\n_certain proof_ that it once existed lies in the comparative anatomy and\r\nthe ontogeny of the Amniota; for all Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals,\r\nincluding Man, agree in so many important characteristics that they\r\nmust, with full assurance, be admitted to be the descendants of a\r\nsingle common primary form, namely, of the Protamnion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTEENTH STAGE: +Primary Mammals (Promammalia)+.\r\n\r\nWe now find ourselves more at home with our ancestors. From the\r\nsixteenth up to the twenty-second stage they all belong to the large and\r\nwell known class of Mammals, the confines of which we ourselves have as\r\nyet not transgressed. The common, long since extinct and unknown primary\r\nforms of all Mammalia, which we have named Promammalia, were at all\r\nevents, of all still living animals, of the class most closely related\r\nto the Beaked animals, or Ornithostoma (Ornithorhynchus, Echidna, p.\r\n233). They differed from the latter, however, by the teeth present in\r\ntheir jaws. The formation of the beak in the Beaked animals of the\r\npresent day must be looked upon as an adaptive characteristic which\r\ndeveloped at a later period. The Promammalia arose out of the Protamnia\r\n(probably only at the beginning of the secondary period, namely, in the\r\nTrias) by various advances in their internal organisation, as also by\r\nthe transformation of the epidermal scales into hairs, and by the\r\nformation of a mammary gland which furnished milk for the nourishment of\r\nthe young ones. The _certain proof_ that the Promammalia—inasmuch as\r\nthey are the common primary forms of all Mammals—also belong to our\r\nancestors, lies in the comparative anatomy and the ontogeny of Mammalia\r\nand Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTEENTH STAGE: +Pouched Animals (Marsupialia)+.\r\n\r\nThe three sub-classes of Mammalia—as we have already seen—stand in such\r\na relation to one another that the Marsupials, both as regards their\r\nanatomy and their ontogeny and phylogeny, form the direct transition\r\nfrom the Monotrema to Placental animals (p. 247). Consequently, human\r\nancestors must also have existed among Marsupials. They _originated_ out\r\nof the Monotrema—which include the primary Mammalia, or Promammalia—by\r\nthe division of the cloaca into the rectum and the urogenital sinus, by\r\nthe formation of a nipple on the mammary gland, and by the partial\r\nsuppression of the clavicles. The oldest Marsupials at all events\r\nexisted as early as the Jura period (perhaps even in the Trias); during\r\nthe Chalk period they passed through a series of stages preparing the\r\nway for the origin of Placentalia. The certain proof of our derivation\r\nfrom Marsupials—nearly akin to the still living opossum and kangaroo in\r\ntheir essential inner structure—is furnished by the comparative anatomy\r\nand the ontogeny of Mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTEENTH STAGE: +Semi-apes (Prosimiæ)+.\r\n\r\nThe small group of Semi-apes, as we have already seen, is one of the\r\nmost important and most interesting orders of Mammalia. It contains the\r\ndirect primary forms of Genuine Apes, and thus also of Man. Our Semi-ape\r\nancestors probably possessed only a very faint external resemblance to\r\nthe still living, short-footed Semi-apes (Brachytarsi), especially the\r\nMaki, Indri, and Lori (p. 256). They _originated_ (probably at the\r\nbeginning of the Cenolithic, or Tertiary period) out of Marsupials of\r\nRat-like appearance by the formation of a placenta, the loss of the\r\nmarsupium and the marsupial bones, and by the higher development of the\r\ncommissures of the brain. The _certain proof_ that Genuine Apes, and\r\nhence also our own race, are the direct descendants of Semi-apes, is to\r\nbe found in the comparative anatomy and the ontogeny of Placental\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\nNINETEENTH STAGE: +Tailed Apes (Menocerca)+.\r\n\r\nOf the two classes of Genuine Apes which developed out of the Semi-apes,\r\nit is only the narrow-nosed, or Catarrhini, which are closely related by\r\nblood to Man. Our older ancestors from this group probably resembled the\r\nstill living Nose-apes and Holy-apes (Semnopithecus), which possess jaws\r\nand narrow noses like Man, but have a long tail, and their bodies\r\ndensely covered with hair (p. 271). The Tailed Apes with narrow noses\r\n(Catarrhini Menocerci) _originated_ out of Semi-apes by the\r\ntransformation of the jaw, and by the claws on their toes becoming\r\nchanged into nails; this probably took place as early as the older\r\nTertiary period. The _certain proof_ of our derivation from Tailed\r\nCatarrhini is to be found in the comparative anatomy and the ontogeny of\r\nApes and of Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTIETH STAGE: +Man-like Apes (Anthropoides)+.\r\n\r\nOf all still living Apes the large tail-less, narrow-nosed Apes, namely,\r\nthe Orang and Gibbon in Asia, the Gorilla and Chimpanzee in Africa, are\r\nmost nearly akin to Man. It is probable that these Man-like Apes, or\r\nAnthropoides, originated during the Mid-tertiary period, namely, in the\r\nMiocene period. They developed out of the Tailed Catarrhini of the\r\npreceding stage—with which they essentially agree—by the loss of the\r\ntail, the partial loss of the hairy covering and by the excessive\r\ndevelopment of that portion of the brain just above the facial portion\r\nof the skull. There do not exist direct human ancestors among the\r\nAnthropoides of the present day, but they certainly existed among the\r\nunknown extinct Human Apes of the Miocene period. The _certain proof_ of\r\ntheir former existence is furnished by the comparative anatomy of\r\nMan-like Apes and of Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FIRST STAGE: +Ape-like Men (Pithecanthropi)+.\r\n\r\nAlthough the preceding ancestral stage is already so nearly akin to\r\ngenuine Men that we scarcely require to assume an intermediate\r\nconnecting stage, still we can look upon the speechless Primæval Men\r\n(Alali) as this intermediate link. These Ape-like men, or\r\nPithecanthropi, very probably existed towards the end of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. They originated out of the Man-like Apes, or Anthropoides, by\r\nbecoming completely habituated to an upright walk, and by the\r\ncorresponding stronger differentiation of both pairs of legs. The fore\r\nhand of the Anthropoides became the human hand, their hinder hand became\r\na foot for walking. Although these Ape-like Men must not merely by the\r\nexternal formation of their bodies, but also by their internal mental\r\ndevelopment, have been much more akin to real Men than the Man-like Apes\r\ncould have been, yet they did not possess the real and chief\r\ncharacteristic of man, namely, the articulate human language of words,\r\nthe corresponding development of a higher consciousness, and the\r\nformation of ideas. The _certain proof_ that such Primæval Men without\r\nthe power of speech, or Ape-like Men, must have preceded men possessing\r\nspeech, is the result arrived at by an inquiring mind from comparative\r\nphilology (from the “comparative anatomy” of language), and especially\r\nfrom the history of the development of language in every child (“glottal\r\nontogenesis”) as well as in every nation (“glottal phylogenesis”).\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY-SECOND STAGE: +Men (Homines)+.\r\n\r\nGenuine Men _developed_ out of the Ape-like Men of the preceding stage\r\nby the gradual development of the animal language of sounds into a\r\nconnected or articulate language, of words. The development of this\r\nfunction, of course, went hand in hand with the development of its\r\norgans, namely, the higher differentiation of the larynx and the brain.\r\nThe transition from speechless Ape-like Men to Genuine or Talking Men\r\nprobably took place at the beginning of the Quaternary period, namely,\r\nin the Diluvial period, but possibly even at an earlier date, in the\r\nmore recent Tertiary. As, according to the unanimous opinion of most\r\neminent philologists, all human languages are not derived from a common\r\nprimæval language, we must assume a polyphyletic origin of language, and\r\nin accordance with this a polyphyletic transition from speechless\r\nApe-like Men to Genuine Men.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCESTRAL SERIES OF THE HUMAN PEDIGREE.\r\n\r\nM N = Boundary between the Invertebrate and Vertebrate Ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   _Epochs of the_ |  _Geological Periods_ |         _Animal_          |   _Nearest Living_\r\n      _Organic_    |       _of the_        |     _Ancestral Stages_    |  _Relatives of the_\r\n   _History of the_|   _Organic History_   |           _of_            |  _Ancestral Stages._\r\n       _Earth._    |    _of the Earth._    |          _Man._           |\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                   {                       {  1.

One must, however, not expect\r\nto be able to survey satisfactorily in every detail the history or\r\nphylogeny of the human species which will henceforth form the basis of\r\nAnthropology, and of all other sciences. The complete development of\r\nthis most important science—of which we can only lay the first\r\nfoundation—must remain reserved for the more accurate and extensive\r\ninvestigations of a future time. This applies also to those more special\r\nquestions of human phylogeny at which it is desirable before concluding\r\nto take a cursory glance, namely, the question of the time and place of\r\nthe origin of the human race, as also of the different species and races\r\ninto which it has differentiated.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the period of the earth’s history, within which the\r\nslow and gradual transmutation of the most man-like apes into the most\r\nape-like men took place, can of course not be determined by years, nor\r\neven by centuries. This much can, however, with full assurance be\r\nmaintained, for reasons given in the last chapter, that Man is derived\r\nfrom Placental animals. Now, as fossil remains of these Placentalia are\r\nfound only in the tertiary rocks, the human race can at the earliest\r\nhave developed only within the Tertiary period out of perfected man-like\r\napes. What seems most probable is that this most important process in\r\nthe history of terrestrial creation occurred towards the end of the\r\nTertiary period, that is in the Pliocene, perhaps even in the Miocene\r\nperiod, but possibly also not until the beginning of the Diluvial\r\nperiod. At all events Man, as such, lived in central Europe as early as\r\nthe Diluvial period, contemporaneously with many large, long since\r\nextinct mammals, especially with the diluvial elephant, or mammoth\r\n(Elephas primigenius), the woolly-haired rhinoceros (Rhinoceros\r\ntichorrhinus), the giant deer (Cervus euryceros), the cave bear (Ursus\r\nspelæus), the cave hyæna (Hyæna spelæa), the cave lion (Felis spelæus),\r\netc. The results brought to light by recent geology and archæology as to\r\nthese fossil men and their animal contemporaries of the diluvial period,\r\nare of the greatest interest. But as a closer examination of them would\r\noccupy too much of my limited space, I must confine myself here to\r\nsetting forth their great general importance, and refer for particulars\r\nto the numerous writings which have recently been published on the\r\nPrimæval History of Man, more especially to the excellent works of\r\nCharles Lyell,(30) Carl Vogt,(27) Friedrich Rolle,(28) John Lubbock,(44)\r\nL. Büchner,(43) etc.\r\n\r\nThe numerous and interesting discoveries presented to us by these\r\nextensive investigations of late years on the primæval history of the\r\nhuman race, place the important fact (long since probable for many other\r\nreasons) beyond a doubt, that the human race, as such, has existed for\r\nmore than twenty thousand years. But it is also probable that more than\r\na hundred thousand years, perhaps many hundred thousands of years, have\r\nelapsed since its first appearance; and, in contrast to this, it must\r\nseem very absurd that our calendars still represent the “Creation of the\r\nWorld, according to Calvisius,” to have taken place 5821 years ago.\r\n\r\nNow, whether we reckon the period during which the human race, as such,\r\nhas existed and diffused itself over the earth, as twenty thousand, a\r\nhundred thousand, or many hundred thousands of years, the lapse of time\r\nis in any case immensely small in comparison with the inconceivable\r\nlength of time which was requisite for the gradual development of the\r\nlong chain of human ancestors. This is evident even from the small\r\nthickness of all Diluvial deposits in comparison with the Tertiary, and\r\nof these again in comparison with the preceding deposits. (Compare p.\r\n22.) But the infinitely long series of slowly and gradually developing\r\nanimal forms from the simplest Moneron to the Amphioxus, from this to\r\nthe Primæval Fish, from the Primæval Fish to the first Mammal, and\r\nagain, from the latter to Man, also require for their historical\r\ndevelopment a succession of periods probably comprising many thousands\r\nof millions of years. (Compare vol. i. p. 129.)\r\n\r\nThose processes of development which led to the origin of the most\r\nApe-like Men out of the most Man-like Apes must be looked for in the two\r\nadaptational changes which, above all others, are distinctive of Man,\r\nnamely, _upright walk_ and _articulate speech_. These two\r\n_physiological_ functions necessarily originated together with two\r\ncorresponding _morphological_ transmutations, with which they stand in\r\nthe closest correlation, namely, the _differentiation of the two pairs\r\nof limbs and the differentiation of the larynx_. The important\r\nperfecting of these organs and their functions must have necessarily and\r\npowerfully reacted upon the differentiation of the brain and the mental\r\nactivities dependent upon it, and thus have paved the way for the\r\nendless career in which Man has since progressively developed, and in\r\nwhich he has far outstripped his animal ancestors. (Gen. Morph. ii. p.\r\n430.)\r\n\r\nThe first and earliest of these three great processes in the development\r\nof the human organism probably was the _higher differentiation and the\r\nperfecting of the extremities_ which was effected by the _habit of an\r\nupright walk_. By the fore feet more and more exclusively adopting and\r\nretaining the function of grasping and handling, and the hinder feet\r\nmore and more exclusively the function of standing and walking, there\r\nwas developed that contrast between the hand and foot which is indeed\r\nnot exclusively characteristic of man, but which is much more strongly\r\ndeveloped in him than in the apes most like men. This differentiation of\r\nthe fore and hinder extremities was, however, not merely most\r\nadvantageous for their own development and perfecting, but it was\r\nfollowed at the same time by a whole series of very important changes in\r\nother parts of the body. The whole vertebral column, and more especially\r\nthe girdle of the pelvis and shoulders, as also the muscles belonging to\r\nthem, thereby experienced those changes which distinguish the human body\r\nfrom that of the most man-like apes. These transmutations were probably\r\naccomplished long before the origin of articulate speech; and the human\r\nrace thus existed for long, with an upright walk and the characteristic\r\nhuman form of body connected with it, before the actual development of\r\nhuman language, which would have completed the second and the more\r\nimportant part of human development. We may therefore distinguish a\r\nspecial (21st) stage in the series of our human ancestors, namely,\r\nSpeechless Man (Alalus), or Ape-man (Pithecanthropus), whose body was\r\nindeed formed exactly like that of Man in all essential characteristics,\r\nbut who did not as yet possess articulate speech.\r\n\r\nThe origin of _articulate language_, and the _higher differentiation and\r\nperfecting of the larynx_ connected with it, must be looked upon as only\r\na later, and the most important stage in the process of the development\r\nof Man. It was, doubtless, this process which above all others helped to\r\ncreate the deep chasm between man and animal, and which also first\r\ncaused the most important progress in the mental activity and the\r\nperfecting of the brain connected with it. There indeed exists in very\r\nmany animals a language for communicating sensations, desires, and\r\nthoughts, partly a language of gestures, partly a language of feeling or\r\ntouch, partly a language of cries or sounds, but a real language of\r\nwords or ideas, a so-called “articulate” language, which by abstraction\r\nchanges sounds into words, and words into sentences, belongs, as far as\r\nwe know, exclusively to Man.\r\n\r\nThe origin of human language must, more than anything else, have had an\r\nennobling and transforming influence upon the mental life of Man, and\r\nconsequently upon his brain. The higher differentiation and perfecting\r\nof the brain and mental life as its highest function developed in direct\r\ncorrelation with its expression by means of speech. Hence, the highest\r\nauthorities in comparative philology justly see in the development of\r\nhuman speech the most important process which distinguishes Man from his\r\nanimal ancestors. This has been especially set forth by August\r\nSchleicher, in his treatise “On the Importance of Speech for the Natural\r\nHistory of Man.”(34) In this relation we see one of the closest\r\nconnections between comparative zoology and comparative philology; and\r\nhere the theory of development assigns to the latter the task of\r\nfollowing the origin of language step by step. This task, as interesting\r\nas it is important, has of late years been successfully undertaken by\r\nmany inquirers, but more especially by Wilhelm Bleek, who has been\r\noccupied for seventeen years in South Africa with the study of the\r\nlanguages of the lowest races of men, and hence has been enabled to\r\nsolve the question. August Schleicher more especially discusses, in\r\naccordance with the theory of selection, how the various forms of\r\nspeech, like all other organic forms and functions, have developed by\r\nthe process of natural selection, and have divided into many species and\r\ndialects.\r\n\r\nI have no space here to follow the process of the formation of language,\r\nand must refer in regard to this to the above-mentioned important work\r\nof Wilhelm Bleek, “On the Origin of Language.”(35) But we have still to\r\nmention one of the most important results of comparative philology,\r\nwhich is of the highest importance to the genealogy of the human\r\nspecies, that is, that _human language was probably of a multiple, or\r\npolyphyletic origin_. Human speech, as such, did not develop probably\r\nuntil the genus of Speechless or Primæval Man, or Ape Man, had\r\nseparated into several kinds or species. In each of these human species,\r\nand perhaps even in the different sub-species and varieties of this\r\nspecies, language developed freely and independently of the others. At\r\nleast Schleicher, one of the first authorities on the subject, maintains\r\nthat “even the beginnings of language—in sounds as well as in regard to\r\nideas and views which were reflected in sounds, and further, in regard\r\nto their capability of development—must have been different. For it is\r\npositively impossible to trace all languages to one and the same\r\nprimæval language. An impartial investigation rather shows that there\r\nare as many primæval languages as there are races.”(34) In like manner,\r\nFriederich Müller(41) and other eminent linguists assume a free and\r\nindependent origin of the families of languages and their primæval\r\nstocks. It is well known, however, that the boundaries of these tribes\r\nof languages and their ramifications are by no means always the\r\nboundaries of the different human species, or the so-called “races,”\r\ndistinguished by us on account of their bodily characteristics. This,\r\nas well as the complicated relations of the mixture of races, and the\r\nvarious forms of hybrids, is the great difficulty lying in the way of\r\ntracing the human pedigree in its individual branches, species, races,\r\nvarieties, etc.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these great and serious difficulties, we cannot here refrain\r\nfrom taking one more cursory glance at the ramification of the human\r\npedigree, and at the same time considering, from the point of view of\r\nthe theory of descent, the much discussed question of the monophyletic\r\nor polyphyletic origin of the human race, and its species or races. As\r\nis well known, two great parties have for a long time been at war with\r\neach other upon this question; the _monophylists_ (or monogenists)\r\nmaintain the unity of origin and the blood relationship of all races of\r\nmen. The _polyphylists_ (or polygenists), on the other hand, are of\r\nopinion that the different races of men are of independent origin.\r\nAccording to our previous genealogical investigations we cannot doubt\r\nthat, at least in a _wide sense_, the monophyletic opinion is the right\r\none. For even supposing that the transmutation of Man-like Apes into Men\r\nhad taken place several times, yet those Apes themselves would again be\r\nallied by the one pedigree common to the whole order of Apes. The\r\nquestion therefore would always be merely about a nearer or remoter\r\ndegree of blood relationship. In a _narrower sense_, on the other hand,\r\nthe polyphylist’s opinion would probably be right, inasmuch as the\r\ndifferent primæval languages have developed quite independently of one\r\nanother. Hence, if the origin of an articulate language is considered as\r\nthe real and principal act of humanification, and the species of the\r\nhuman race are distinguished according to the roots of their language,\r\nit might be said that the different races of men had originated,\r\nindependently of one another, by different branches of primæval,\r\nspeechless men directly springing from apes, and forming their own\r\nprimæval language. Still they would of course be connected further up or\r\nlower down at their root, and thus all would finally be derived from a\r\ncommon primæval stock.\r\n\r\nWhile we hold the latter of these convictions, and while we for many\r\nreasons believe that the different species of speechless primæval men\r\nwere all derived from a common ape-like human form, we do not of course\r\nmean to say that _all men are descended from one pair_. This latter\r\nsupposition, which our modern Indo-Germanic culture has taken from the\r\nSemitic myth of the Mosaic history of creation, is by no means tenable.\r\nThe whole of the celebrated dispute, as to whether the human race is\r\ndescended from a single pair or not, rests upon a completely false way\r\nof putting the question. It is just as senseless as the dispute as to\r\nwhether all sporting dogs or all race-horses are descended from a single\r\npair. We might with equal justice ask whether all Germans or all\r\nEnglishmen are “descended from a single pair,” etc. A “first human\r\npair,” or “a first man,” has in fact never existed, any more than there\r\never existed a first pair or a first individual of Englishmen, Germans,\r\nrace-horses, or sporting dogs. The origin of a new species, of course,\r\nalways results from an existing species, by a long chain of many\r\ndifferent individuals sharing the slow process of transformation.\r\nSupposing that we had all the different pairs of Human Apes and Ape-like\r\nMen before us—which belong to the true ancestors of the human race—it\r\nwould even then be quite impossible (without doing so most arbitrarily)\r\nto call any one of these pairs of ape-like men “the first pair.” As\r\nlittle can we derive each of the twelve races or species of men, which\r\nwe shall consider directly, from a “first pair.”\r\n\r\nThe difficulties met with in classifying the different races or species\r\nof men are quite the same as those which we discover in classifying\r\nanimal and vegetable species. In both cases forms apparently quite\r\ndifferent are connected with one another by a chain of intermediate\r\nforms of transition. In both cases the dispute as to what is a kind or a\r\nspecies, what a race or a variety, can never be determined. Since\r\nBlumenbach’s time, as is well known, it has been thought that mankind\r\nmay be divided into five races or varieties, namely: (1) the Ethiopian,\r\nor black race (African negro); (2) the Malayan, or brown race (Malays,\r\nPolynesians, and Australians); (3) the Mongolian, or yellow race (the\r\nprincipal inhabitants of Asia and the Esquimaux of North America); (4)\r\nthe Americans, or red race (the aborigines of America); and (5) the\r\nCaucasian, or white race (Europeans, north Africans, and south-western\r\nAsiatics). All of these five races of men, according to the Jewish\r\nlegend of creation, are said to have been descended from “a single\r\npair”—Adam and Eve,—and in accordance with this are said to be varieties\r\nof one kind or species. If, however, we compare them without prejudice,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the differences of these five races are as\r\ngreat and even greater than the “specific differences” by which\r\nzoologists and botanists distinguish recognised “good” animal and\r\nvegetable species (“bonæ species”). The excellent palæontologist\r\nQuenstedt is right in maintaining that, “if Negroes and Caucasians were\r\nsnails, zoologists would universally agree that they represented two\r\nvery excellent species, which could never have originated from one pair\r\nby gradual divergence.”\r\n\r\nThe characteristics by which the races of men are gradually\r\ndistinguished are partly taken from the formation of the hair, partly\r\nfrom the colour of the skin, and partly from the formation of the skull.\r\nIn regard to the last character, two extremes are distinguished, namely,\r\nlong heads and short heads. In _long-headed men_ (Dolichocephali), whose\r\nstrongest development is found in Negroes and Australians, the skull is\r\nextended, narrow, and compressed on the right and left. In _short-headed\r\nmen_ (Brachycephali), on the other hand, the skull is compressed in an\r\nexactly opposite manner, from the front to the back, is short and broad,\r\nwhich is especially striking in the case of the Mongolians.\r\n_Medium-headed men_ (Mesocephali), standing between the two extremes,\r\npredominate especially among Americans. In every one of these three\r\ngroups we find men with _slanting teeth_ (Prognathi), whose jaws, like\r\nthose of the animal snout, strongly project, and whose front teeth\r\ntherefore slope in front, and men with _straight teeth_ (Orthognathi),\r\nwhose jaws project but little, and whose front teeth stand\r\nperpendicularly. During the last ten years a great deal of time and\r\ntrouble have been devoted to the careful examination and measurement of\r\nthe forms of skulls, which have, however, not been rewarded by\r\ncorresponding results. For within a single species, as for example\r\nwithin the Mediterranean species, the form of the skull may vary so much\r\nthat both extremes are met with in the same species. Much better\r\nstarting-points for the classification of the human species are\r\nfurnished by the nature of the hair and speech, because they are much\r\nmore strictly hereditary than the form of the skull.\r\n\r\nComparative philology seems especially to be becoming an authority in\r\nthis matter. In the latest great work on the races of men, which\r\nFriederich Müller has published in his excellent “Ethnography,”(42) he\r\njustly places language in the fore-ground. Next to it the nature of the\r\nhair of the head is of great importance; for although it is in itself of\r\ncourse only a subordinate morphological character, yet it seems to be\r\nstrictly transmitted within the race. Of the twelve species of men\r\ndistinguished on the following table (p. 308), the four lower species\r\nare characterised by the woolly nature of the hair of their heads; every\r\nhair is flattened like a tape, and thus its section is oval. These four\r\nspecies of _woolly-haired men_ (Ulotrichi) we may reduce into two\r\ngroups—tuft-haired and fleecy-haired. The hair on the head of\r\n_tuft-haired men_ (Lophocomi), Papuans and Hottentots, grows in\r\nunequally divided small tufts. The woolly hair of _fleecy-haired men_\r\n(Eriocomi), on the other hand, in Caffres and Negroes, grows equally all\r\nover the skin of the head. All Ulotrichi, or woolly-haired men, have\r\nslanting teeth and long heads, and the colour of their skin, hair, and\r\neyes is always very dark. All are inhabitants of the Southern\r\nHemisphere; it is only in Africa that they come north of the equator.\r\nThey are on the whole at a much lower stage of development, and more\r\nlike apes, than most of the Lissotrichi, or straight-haired men. The\r\nUlotrichi are incapable of a true inner culture and of a higher mental\r\ndevelopment, even under the favourable conditions of adaptation now\r\noffered to them in the United States of North America. No woolly-haired\r\nnation has ever had an important “history.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY\r\n\r\n_Of the 12 Species of Men and their 36 Races._\r\n\r\n(Compare Plate XV.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  -------------------+--------------------------+----------------------------+-------------\r\n     _Species._      |         _Races._         |         _Home._            | _Immigrated_\r\n                     |                          |                            |  _from the_\r\n  -------------------+--------------------------+----------------------------+-------------\r\n  { 1. =Papuan=      {  1.

Every separate hair is\r\ncylindrical (not like a tape), and hence its section is circular (not\r\noval).\r\n\r\nThe eight races of Lissotrichi may likewise be divided into two\r\ngroups—stiff-haired and curly-haired. _Stiff-haired men_ (Euthycomi),\r\nthe hair of whose heads is quite smooth and straight, and not frizzled,\r\ninclude Australians, Malays, Mongolians, Arctic tribes, and Americans.\r\nCurly-haired men, on the other hand, the hair of whose heads is more or\r\nless curly, and in whom the beard is more developed than in all other\r\nspecies, include the Dravidas, Nubians, and Mediterranean races.\r\n(Compare Plate XV.)\r\n\r\nNow, before we venture upon the attempt hypothetically to explain the\r\nphyletic divergence of mankind, and the genealogical connection of its\r\ndifferent species, we will premise a short description of the twelve\r\nnamed species and of their distribution. In order clearly to survey\r\ntheir geographical distribution, we must go back some three or four\r\ncenturies, to the time when the Indian Islands and America were first\r\ndiscovered, and when the present great mingling of species, and more\r\nespecially the influx of the Indo-Germanic race, had as yet not made\r\ngreat progress. We begin with the lowest stages, with the woolly-haired\r\nmen (Ulotrichi), all of whom are prognathic Dolichocephali.\r\n\r\nThe _Papuan_ (Homo Papua), of all the still living human species, is\r\nperhaps most closely related to the original primary form of\r\nwoolly-haired men. This species now inhabits only the large island of\r\nNew Guinea and the Archipelago of Melanesia lying to the east of it\r\n(Solomon’s Islands, New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, etc.). But\r\nscattered remnants of it are also still found in the interior of the\r\npeninsula of Malacca, and likewise in many other islands of the large\r\nPacific Archipelago; mostly in the inaccessible mountainous parts of the\r\ninterior, and especially in the Philippine Islands. The but lately\r\nextinct Tasmanians, or the natives of Van Diemen’s Land, belonged to\r\nthis group. From these and other circumstances it is clear that the\r\nPapuans in former times possessed a much larger area of distribution in\r\nsouth-eastern Asia. They were driven out by the Malays and forced\r\neastwards. The skin of all Papuans is of a black colour, sometimes more\r\ninclining to brown, sometimes more to blue. Their woolly hair grows in\r\ntufts, is spirally twisted in screws, and often more than a foot in\r\nlength, so that it forms a strong woolly wig, which stands far out from\r\nthe head. Their face, below the narrow depressed forehead, has a large\r\nturned-up nose and thick protruding lips. The peculiar form of their\r\nhair and speech so essentially distinguishes the Papuans from their\r\nstraight-haired neighbours, from the Malays as well as from the\r\nAustralians, that they must be regarded as an entirely distinct species.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the Papuans by the tufted growth of hair, but\r\ngeographically widely separated from them, are the _Hottentots_ (Homo\r\nHottentottus). They inhabit exclusively the southernmost part of Africa,\r\nthe Cape and the adjacent parts, and have immigrated there from the\r\nnorth-east. The Hottentots, like their original kinsmen the Papuans,\r\noccupied in former times a much larger area (probably the whole of\r\nEastern Africa), and are now approaching their extinction. Besides the\r\ngenuine Hottentots—of whom there now exist only the two tribes of the\r\nCoraca (in the eastern Cape districts) and the Namaca (in the western\r\nportion of the Cape)—this species also includes the Bushmen (in the\r\nmountainous interior of the Cape). The woolly hair of all Hottentots\r\ngrows in tufts, like brushes, as in the case of Papuans. Both species\r\nalso agree in the posterior part of the body, in the female sex being\r\nspecially inclined to form a great accumulation of fat (Steatopygia).\r\nBut the skin of Hottentots is much lighter, of a yellowish brown colour.\r\nTheir very flat face is remarkable for its small forehead and nose, and\r\nlarge nostrils. The mouth is very broad with big lips, the chin small\r\nand pointed. Their speech is characterised by several quite peculiar\r\nguttural sounds.\r\n\r\nThe next neighbours and kinsmen of Hottentots are _Kaffres_ (Homo\r\nCafer). This woolly-haired human species is, however, distinguished,\r\nlike the following one (the genuine Negro), from Hottentots and Papuans\r\nby the woolly hair not being divided into tufts, but covering the head\r\nas a thick fleece. The colour of their skin varies through all shades,\r\nfrom the yellowish black of the Hottentot to the brown black or pure\r\nblack of the genuine Negro. While in former times the race of Kaffres\r\nwas assigned to a very small area of distribution, and was generally\r\nlooked upon only as a variety of the genuine Negro, this species is now\r\nconsidered to include almost the whole of the inhabitants of equatorial\r\nAfrica, from the 20th degree south latitude to the 4th degree north;\r\nconsequently, all South Africans, with the exception of the Hottentots.\r\nThey include especially the inhabitants of the Zulu, Zambesi, and\r\nMozambique districts on the east coast, the large human families of the\r\nBeschuans or Setschuans in the interior, and the Herrero and Congo\r\ntribes of the west coast. They too, like the Hottentots, have immigrated\r\nfrom the north-east. Kaffres, who were usually classed with Negroes,\r\ndiffer very essentially from them by the formation of their skull and by\r\ntheir speech. Their face is long and narrow, their forehead high, and\r\ntheir nose prominent and frequently curved, their lips not so\r\nprotruding, and their chin pointed. The many languages of the different\r\ntribes of Kaffres can all be derived from an extinct primæval language,\r\nnamely, from the Bantu language.\r\n\r\nThe genuine _Negro_ (Homo Niger)—when Kaffres, Hottentots, and Nubians\r\nare separated from him—at present forms a much less comprehensive human\r\nspecies than was formerly supposed. They now only include the Tibus, in\r\nthe eastern parts of the Sahara; the Sudan people, or Sudians, who\r\ninhabit the south of that large desert; also the inhabitants of the\r\nWestern Coast of Africa, from the mouth of the Senegal in the north, to\r\nbeyond the estuary of the Niger in the south (Senegambians and\r\nNigritians). Genuine Negroes are accordingly confined between the\r\nequator and the Tropic of Capricorn, and only a small portion of the\r\nTibu tribe in the east have gone beyond this boundary. The Negro species\r\nhas spread within this zone, coming from the east. The colour of the\r\nskin of genuine negroes is always more or less of a pure black. Their\r\nskin is velvety to the touch, and characterised by a peculiar offensive\r\nexhalation. Although Negroes agree with Kaffres in the formation of the\r\nwoolly hair of the head, yet they differ essentially in the formation of\r\ntheir face. Their forehead is flatter and lower, their nose broad and\r\nthick, not prominent, their lips large and protruding, and their chin\r\nvery short. Genuine Negroes are moreover distinguished by very thin\r\ncalves and very long arms. This species of men must have branched into\r\nmany separate tribes at a very early period, for their numerous and\r\nentirely distinct languages can in no way be traced to one primæval\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nTo the four woolly-haired species of men just discussed, straight-haired\r\nmen (Homines Lissotrichi) stand in strong contrast, as another main\r\nbranch of the genus. Five of the eight species of the latter, as we have\r\nseen, can be comprised as stiff-haired (Euthycomi) and three as\r\ncurly-haired (Euplocomi). We shall in the first place consider the\r\nformer, which includes the primæval inhabitants of the greater part of\r\nAsia and the whole of America.\r\n\r\nThe lowest stage of all straight-haired men, and on the whole perhaps of\r\nall the still living human species, is occupied by the _Australian_, or\r\n_Austral-negro_ (Homo Australis). This species seems to be exclusively\r\nconfined to the large island of Australia; it resembles the genuine\r\nAfrican Negro by its black or brownish black hair, and the offensive\r\nsmell of the skin, by its very slanting teeth and long-headed form of\r\nskull, the receding forehead, broad nose, protruding lips, and also by\r\nthe entire absence of calves. On the other hand Australians differ from\r\ngenuine Negroes as well as from their nearest neighbours the Papuans, by\r\nthe much weaker and more delicate structure of their bones, and more\r\nespecially by the formation of the hair of their heads, which is not\r\nwoolly and frizzled, but either quite lank or only slightly curled. The\r\nvery low stage of bodily and mental development of the Australian is\r\nperhaps not altogether original, but has arisen by degeneration, that\r\nis, by adaptation to the very unfavourable conditions of existence in\r\nAustralia. They probably immigrated to their present home from the north\r\nor north-west, as a very early offshoot of the Euthycomi. They are\r\nprobably more closely related to the Dravidas, and hence to the\r\nEuplocomi, than the other Euthycomi. The very peculiar language of the\r\nAustralians is broken up into numerous small branches, which are grouped\r\ninto a northern and a southern class.\r\n\r\nThe _Malay_ (Homo Malayus), the brown race of ethnographers, although\r\nnot a large species, is important in regard to its genealogy. An extinct\r\nsouth Asiatic human species, very closely related to the Malays of the\r\npresent day, must probably be looked upon as the common primary form of\r\nthis and the following higher human species. We will call this\r\nhypothetical primary species, Primæval Malays, or Promalays. The Malays\r\nof the present day are divided into two widely dispersed races, the\r\n_Sundanesians_, who inhabit Malacca, the Sunda Islands (Sumatra, Java,\r\nBorneo, etc.) and the Philippine Islands, and the _Polynesians_, who are\r\ndispersed over the greater portion of the Pacific Archipelago. The\r\nnorthern boundary of their wide tract of distribution is formed on the\r\neast by the Sandwich Islands (Hawai), and on the west by the Marian\r\nIslands (Ladrones); the southern boundary on the east is formed by the\r\nMangareva Archipelago, and on the west by New Zealand. The inhabitants\r\nof Madagascar are an especial branch of Sundanesians who have been\r\ndriven to the far west. This wide pelagic distribution of the Malays is\r\nexplained by their partiality for nautical life. Their primæval home is\r\nthe south-eastern portion of the Asiatic continent, from whence they\r\nspread to the east and south, and drove the Papuans before them. The\r\nMalays, in the formation of body, are nearest akin to the Mongols, but\r\nare also nearly allied to the curly-haired Mediterranese. They are\r\ngenerally short-headed, more rarely medium-headed, and very rarely\r\nlong-headed. Their hair is black and stiff, but frequently somewhat\r\ncurled. The colour of their skin is brown, sometimes yellowish, or of a\r\ncinnamon colour, sometimes reddish or copper brown, more rarely dark\r\nbrown. In regard to the formation of face, Malays in a great measure\r\nform an intermediate stage between the Mongols and the Mediterranese;\r\nthey can frequently not be distinguished from the latter. Their face is\r\ngenerally broad, with prominent nose and thick lips, the opening for\r\ntheir eyes not so narrowly cut and slanting as in Mongols. The near\r\nrelationship between all Malays and Polynesians is proved by their\r\nlanguage, which indeed broke up at an early period into many small\r\nbranches, but still can always be traced to a common and quite peculiar\r\nprimæval language.\r\n\r\nThe _Mongol_ (Homo Mongolus) is, next to the Mediterranese, the richest\r\nin individuals. Among them are all the inhabitants of the Asiatic\r\nContinent, excepting the Hyperboreans in the north, the few Malays in\r\nthe south-east (Malacca), the Dravidas in Western India, and the\r\nMediterranese in the south-west. In Europe this species of men is\r\nrepresented by the Fins and Lapps in the north, by the Osmanlis in\r\nTurkey, and the Magyars in Hungary. The colour of the Mongol is always\r\ndistinguished by a yellow tone, sometimes a light pea green, or even\r\nwhite, sometimes a darker brownish yellow. Their hair is always stiff\r\nand black. The form of their skull is, in the great majority of cases,\r\ndecidedly short (especially in Kalmucks, Baschkirs, etc.) but frequently\r\nof medium length (Tartars, Chinese, etc.) But among them we never meet\r\nwith genuine long-headed men. The narrow openings of their eyes, which\r\nare generally slanting, their prominent cheek bones, broad noses, and\r\nthick lips are very striking, as well as the round form of their faces.\r\nThe language of the Mongols is probably traceable to a common primæval\r\nlanguage; but the monosyllabic languages of the Indo-Chinese races, and\r\nthe polysyllabic languages of the other Mongol races, stand in contrast\r\nas two main branches which separated at an early time. The monosyllabic\r\ntribes of the Indo-Chinese include the Tibetans, Birmans, Siamese, and\r\nChinese. The other polysyllabic Mongols are divided into three races,\r\nnamely: (1) the Coreo-Japanese (Coreans and Japanese); (2) the Altaians\r\n(Tartars, Kirgises, Kalmucks, Buriats, Tungusians); and (3) the Uralians\r\n(Samoiedes, Fins). The Magyars of Hungary are descended from the Fins.\r\n\r\nThe _Polar men_ (Homo Arcticus) must be looked upon as a branch of the\r\nMongolian human species. We comprise under this name the inhabitants of\r\nthe Arctic Polar lands of both hemispheres, the Esquimaux (and\r\nGreenlanders) in North America, and the Hyperboreans in north-eastern\r\nAsia (Jukagirs, Tschuksches, Kuriaks, and Kamtschads). By adaptation to\r\nthe Polar climate, this human race has become so peculiarly transformed\r\nthat it may be considered as a distinct species. Their stature is low\r\nand of a square build; the formation of their skull of medium size or\r\neven long; their eyes narrow and slanting like the Mongols; their\r\ncheek-bones prominent, and their mouth wide. Their hair is stiff and\r\nblack; the colour of their skin is of a light or dark brown tinge,\r\nsometimes more inclined to white or to yellow, like that of the Mongols,\r\nsometimes more to red, like that of the Americans. The languages of\r\nPolar men are as yet little known, but they differ both from the\r\nMongolian and from the American. Polar men must probably be regarded as\r\na remnant and a peculiarly adapted branch of that tribe of Mongols which\r\nemigrated from north-eastern Asia to North America, and populated that\r\npart of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of America, that part of the earth was\r\npeopled (setting aside the Esquimaux) only by a single human species,\r\nnamely, by the _Redskins_, or _Americans_ (Homo Americanus). Of all\r\nother human species they are most closely related to the two preceding.\r\nThe form of their skull is generally a medium one, rarely short or\r\nlong-headed. Their forehead broad and very low; their nose large,\r\nprominent, and frequently aquiline; their cheek-bones prominent; their\r\nlips rather thin than thick. The colour of their skin is characterised\r\nby a red fundamental tint, which is, however, sometimes pure copper-red,\r\nor light red, sometimes a deeper reddish brown, yellow brown or olive\r\nbrown. The numerous languages of the various American races and tribes\r\nare extremely different, yet they agree in their original foundation.\r\nProbably America was first peopled from north-eastern Asia by the same\r\ntribe of Mongols from whom the Polar men (Hyperboreans and Esquimaux)\r\nhave also branched. This tribe first spread in North America, and from\r\nthence migrated over the isthmus of Central America down to South\r\nAmerica, at the extreme south of which the species degenerated very\r\nmuch by adaptation to the very unfavourable conditions of existence. But\r\nit is also possible that Mongols and Polynesians immigrated from the\r\nwest and mixed with the former tribe. In any case the aborigines of\r\nAmerica came over from the Old World, and did not, as some suppose, in\r\nany way originate out of American apes. Catarrhini, or Narrow-nosed\r\nApes, never at any period existed in America.\r\n\r\nThe three human species still to be considered—the Dravidas, Nubians,\r\nand Mediterranese—agree in several characteristics which seem to\r\nestablish a close relationship between them, and distinguish them from\r\nthe preceding species. The chief of these characteristics is the strong\r\ndevelopment of the beard, which in all other species is either entirely\r\nwanting or but very scanty. The hair of their heads is generally not so\r\nlank and smooth as in the five preceding species, but in most cases more\r\nor less curly. Other characteristics also seem to favour our classing\r\nthem in one main group of curly-haired men (Euplocomi).\r\n\r\nThe _Dravida man_ (Homo Dravida) seems to stand very near the common\r\nprimary form of the Euplocomi, and perhaps of Lissotrichi. At present\r\nthis primæval species is only represented by the Deccan tribes in the\r\nsouthern part of Hindostan, and by the neighbouring inhabitants of the\r\nmountains on the north-east of Ceylon. But in earlier times this race\r\nseems to have occupied the whole of Hindostan, and to have spread even\r\nfurther. It shows, on the one hand, traits of relationship to the\r\nAustralians and Malays; on the other, to the Mongols and Mediterranese.\r\nTheir skin is either of a light or dark brown colour; in some tribes, of\r\na yellowish brown, in others, almost black brown. The hair of their\r\nheads, as in Mediterranese, is more or less curled, neither quite\r\nsmooth, like that of the Euthycomi, nor actually woolly, like that of\r\nthe Ulotrichi. The strong development of the beard is also like that of\r\nthe Mediterranese. The oval form of face seems partly to be akin to that\r\nof the Malays, partly to that of the Mediterranese. Their forehead is\r\ngenerally high, their nose prominent and narrow, their lips slightly\r\nprotruding. Their language is now very much mixed with Indo-Germanic\r\nelements, but seems to have been originally derived from a very peculiar\r\nprimæval language.\r\n\r\nThe _Nubian_ (Homo Nuba) has caused ethnographers no fewer difficulties\r\nthan the Dravida species. By this name we understand not merely the real\r\nNubians (Schangallas, or Dongolese), but also their near kinsmen, the\r\nFulas, or Fellatas. The real Nubians inhabit the countries of the Upper\r\nNile (Dongola, Schangalla, Barabra, Cordofan); the Fulas, or Fellatas,\r\non the other hand, have thence migrated far westward, and now inhabit a\r\nbroad tract in the south of the western Sahara, hemmed in between the\r\nSoudanians in the north and the Nigritos in the south. The Nubian and\r\nFula races are generally either classed with negroes or with the Hamitic\r\nraces (thus with Mediterranese), but are so essentially different from\r\nboth that they must be regarded as a distinct species. In former times\r\nthey very probably occupied a large part of north-eastern Africa. The\r\nskin of the Nubian and Fula races is of a yellowish or reddish brown\r\ncolour, more rarely dark brown or approaching to black. Their hair is\r\nnot woolly but curled, frequently even quite smooth; its colour is dark\r\nbrown or black. Their beard is much more strongly developed than in\r\nnegroes. The oval formation of their faces approaches more to the\r\nMediterranean than to the Negro type. Their forehead is high and broad,\r\ntheir nose prominent and not flat, their lips not so protruding as in\r\nthe negro. The language of the Nubian races seems to possess no\r\nrelationship to those of genuine negroes.\r\n\r\nThe _Caucasian_, or _Mediterranean man_ (Homo Mediterraneus), has from\r\ntime immemorial been placed at the head of all races of men, as the most\r\nhighly developed and perfect. It is generally called the Caucasian race,\r\nbut as among all the varieties of the species, the Caucasian branch is\r\nthe least important, we prefer the much more suitable appellation\r\nproposed by Friedrich Müller, namely, that of Mediterranean, or Midland\r\nmen. For the most important varieties of this species, which are\r\nmoreover the most eminent actors in what is called “Universal History,”\r\nfirst rose to a flourishing condition on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean. The former area of the distribution of this species is\r\nexpressed by the name of “Indo-Atlantic” species, whereas at present it\r\nis spread over the whole earth, and is overcoming most of the other\r\nspecies in the struggle for existence. In bodily as well as in mental\r\nqualities, no other human species can equal the Mediterranean. This\r\nspecies alone (with the exception of the Mongolian) has had an actual\r\nhistory; it alone has attained to that degree of civilization which\r\nseems to raise man above the rest of nature.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics which distinguish the Mediterranean from the other\r\nspecies of the race are well known. The chief of the external features\r\nis the light colour of the skin, which however exhibits all shades, from\r\npure white or reddish white, through yellow or yellowish brown to dark\r\nbrown or even black brown. The growth of the hair is generally strong,\r\nthe hair of the head more or less curly, the hair of the beard stronger\r\nthan in any of the other species. The form of the skull shows a great\r\ndevelopment in breadth; medium heads predominate upon the whole, but\r\nlong and short heads are also widely distributed. It is only in this one\r\nspecies of men that the body as a whole attains that symmetry in all\r\nparts, and that equal development, which we call the type of perfect\r\nhuman beauty. The languages of all the races of this species can by no\r\nmeans be traced to a single common primæval language; we must at least\r\nassume four radically different primæval languages. In accordance with\r\nthis we must also assume within this one species four different races,\r\nwhich are only connected at their root. Two of these races, the Basques\r\nand Caucasians, now exist only as small remnants. The Basques, which in\r\nearlier times peopled the whole of Spain and the south of France, now\r\ninhabit but a narrow tract of land on the northern coast of Spain, on\r\nthe Bay of Biscay. The remnant of the Caucasian race (the Daghestans,\r\nTschercassians, Mingrelians, and Georgians) are now confined to the\r\ndistricts of Mount Caucasus. The language of the Caucasians as well as\r\nthat of the Basques is entirely peculiar, and can be traced neither to\r\nthe Semitic nor to the Indo-Germanic primæval languages.\r\n\r\nEven the languages of the two principal races of the Mediterranean\r\nspecies—the Semitic and Indo-Germanic—cannot be traced to a common\r\norigin, and consequently these two races must have separated at a very\r\nearly period. Semites and Indo-Germani are descended from different\r\nape-like men. The _Semitic_ race likewise separated at a very early\r\nperiod into two diverging branches, namely, into the _Egyptian_ and\r\n_Arabic_ branches. The _Egyptian_, or _African_ branch, the\r\n_Dyssemites_—which sometimes under the name of Hamites are entirely\r\nseparated from the Semites—embraces the large group of Berbers, who\r\noccupy the whole of north Africa, and in earlier times also peopled the\r\nCanary Islands, and, finally, also the group of the Ethiopians, the\r\nBedsha, Galla, Danakil, Somali, and other tribes which occupy all the\r\nnorth-eastern shores of Africa as far as the equator. The _Arabic_, or\r\n_Asiatic_ branch, that is, the _Eusemites_, also called Semites in a\r\nnarrow sense, embrace the inhabitants of the large Arabian peninsula,\r\nthe primæval family of genuine Arabians (“primæval type of the\r\nSemites”), and also the most highly developed Semitic groups, the Jews,\r\nor Hebrews, and the Aramæans—the Syrians and Chaldæans. A colony of the\r\nsouthern Arabs (the Himjarites), which crossed the Straits of\r\nBab-el-Mandeb, has peopled Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Indo-Germanic race, which has far surpassed all the other\r\nraces of men in mental development, separated at a very early period,\r\nlike the Semitic, into two diverging branches, the _Ario-Romaic_ and the\r\n_Slavo-Germanic_ branches. Out of the former arose on the one hand the\r\n_Arians_ (Indians and Iranians), on the other the _Græco-Roman_ (Greeks\r\nand Albanians, Italians and Kelts). Out of the Slavo-Germanic branch\r\nwere developed on the one hand the _Slavonians_ (Russian, Bulgarian,\r\nTchec, and Baltic tribes), on the other the _Germani_ (Scandinavians and\r\nGermans, Netherlanders and Anglo-Saxons). August Schleicher has\r\nexplained, in a very clear genealogical form, how the further\r\nramifications of the Indo-Germanic race may be accurately traced in\r\ndetail on the basis of comparative philology.(6) (Compare p. 331.)\r\n\r\nThe total number of human individuals at present amounts to between\r\n1,300 and 1,400 millions. In our Tabular Survey (p. 333) 1,350 millions\r\nhas been assumed as the mean number. According to an approximate\r\nestimate, as far as such a thing is possible, 1,200 millions of these\r\nare straight-haired men, only about 150 millions woolly-haired. The most\r\nhighly developed species, Mongols and Mediterranese, far surpass all the\r\nother human species in numbers of individuals, for each of them alone\r\ncomprises about 550 millions. (Compare Friederich Müller’s Ethnography,\r\np. 30.) Of course the relative number of the twelve species fluctuates\r\nevery year, and that too according to the law developed by Darwin, that\r\nin the struggle for life the more highly developed, the more favoured\r\nand larger groups of forms, possess the positive inclination and the\r\ncertain tendency to spread more and more at the expense of the lower,\r\nmore backward, and smaller groups. Thus the Mediterranean species, and\r\nwithin it the Indo-Germanic, have by means of the higher development of\r\ntheir brain surpassed all the other races and species in the struggle\r\nfor life, and have already spread the net of their dominion over the\r\nwhole globe. It is only the Mongolian species which can at all\r\nsuccessfully, at least in certain respects, compete with the\r\nMediterranean. Within the tropical regions, Negroes, Kaffres, and\r\nNubians, as also the Malays and Dravidas, are in some measure protected\r\nagainst the encroachments of the Indo-Germanic tribes by their being\r\nbetter adapted for a hot climate; the case of the arctic tribes of the\r\npolar regions is similar. But the other races, which as it is are very\r\nmuch diminished in number, will sooner or later completely succumb in\r\nthe struggle for existence to the superiority of the Mediterranean\r\nraces. The American and Australian tribes are even now fast approaching\r\ntheir complete extinction, and the same may be said of the Papuans and\r\nHottentots.\r\n\r\nIn now turning to the equally interesting and difficult question of the\r\nrelative _connection_, _migration_, and _primæval home_ of the twelve\r\nspecies of men, I must premise the remark that, in the present state of\r\nour anthropological knowledge, any answer to this question must be\r\nregarded only as a provisional hypothesis. This is much the same as with\r\nany genealogical hypothesis which we may form of the origin of kindred\r\nanimal and vegetable species, on the basis of the “Natural System.” But\r\nthe necessary uncertainty of these special hypotheses of descent, in no\r\nway shakes the absolute certainty of the general theory of descent. Man,\r\nwe may feel certain, is descended from Catarrhini, or narrow-nosed apes,\r\nwhether we agree with the polyphylites, and suppose each human species,\r\nin its primæval home, to have originated out of a special kind of ape;\r\nor whether, agreeing with the monophylites, we suppose that all the\r\nhuman species arose only by differentiation from a single species of\r\nprimæval man (Homo primigenius).\r\n\r\nFor many and weighty reasons we hold the monophyletic hypothesis to be\r\nthe more correct, and we therefore assume a _single primæval home_ for\r\nmankind, where he developed out of a long since extinct anthropoid\r\nspecies of ape. Of the five now existing continents, neither Australia,\r\nnor America, nor Europe can have been this primæval home, or the\r\nso-called “Paradise,” the “cradle of the human race.” Most\r\ncircumstances indicate southern Asia as the locality in question.\r\nBesides southern Asia, the only other of the now existing continents\r\nwhich might be viewed in this light is Africa. But there are a number of\r\ncircumstances (especially chorological facts) which suggest that the\r\nprimæval home of man was a continent now sunk below the surface of the\r\nIndian Ocean, which extended along the south of Asia, as it is at\r\npresent (and probably in direct connection with it), towards the east,\r\nas far as further India and the Sunda Islands; towards the west, as far\r\nas Madagascar and the south-eastern shores of Africa. We have already\r\nmentioned that many facts in animal and vegetable geography render the\r\nformer existence of such a south Indian continent very probable.\r\n(Compare vol. i. p. 361.) Sclater has given this continent the name of\r\nLemuria, from the Semi-apes which were characteristic of it. By assuming\r\nthis Lemuria to have been man’s primæval home, we greatly facilitate the\r\nexplanation of the geographical distribution of the human species by\r\nmigration. (Compare the Table of Migrations XV., and its explanation at\r\nthe end.)\r\n\r\nWe as yet know of no fossil remains of the hypothetical primæval man\r\n(Homo primigenius) who developed out of anthropoid apes during the\r\ntertiary period, either in Lemuria or in southern Asia, or possibly in\r\nAfrica. But considering the extraordinary resemblance between the lowest\r\nwoolly-haired men, and the highest man-like apes, which still exist at\r\nthe present day, it requires but a slight stretch of the imagination to\r\nconceive an intermediate form connecting the two, and to see in it an\r\napproximate likeness to the supposed primæval men, or ape-like men. The\r\nform of their skull was probably very long, with slanting teeth; their\r\nhair woolly; the colour of their skin dark, of a brownish tint. The hair\r\ncovering the whole body was probably thicker than in any of the still\r\nliving human species; their arms comparatively longer and stronger;\r\ntheir legs, on the other hand, knock-kneed, shorter and thinner, with\r\nentirely undeveloped calves; their walk but half erect.\r\n\r\nThis ape-like man very probably did not as yet possess an actual human\r\nlanguage, that is, an articulate language of ideas. Human speech, as has\r\nalready been remarked, most likely originated after the divergence of\r\nthe primæval species of men into different species. The number of\r\nprimæval languages is, however, considerably larger than the number of\r\nthe species of men above discussed. For philologists have hitherto not\r\nbeen able to trace the four primæval languages of the Mediterranean\r\nspecies, namely, the Basque, Caucasian, Semitic, and Indo-Germanic to a\r\nsingle primæval language. As little can the different Negro languages be\r\nderived from a common primæval language; hence both these species,\r\nMediterranean and Negro, are certainly _polyglottonic_, that is, their\r\nrespective languages originated after the divergence of the speechless\r\nprimary species into several races had already taken place. Perhaps the\r\nMongols, the Arctic and American tribes, are likewise polyglottonic. The\r\nMalayan species is, however, _monoglottonic_; all the Polynesian and\r\nSundanesian dialects and languages can be derived from a common, long\r\nsince extinct primæval language, which is not related to any other\r\nlanguage on earth. All the other human species, Nubians, Dravidas,\r\nAustralians, Papuans, Hottentots, and Kaffres are likewise\r\nmonoglottonic. (Compare p. 333.)\r\n\r\nOut of speechless primæval man, whom we consider as the common primary\r\nspecies of all the others, there developed in the first place—probably\r\nby natural selection—various species of men unknown to us, and now long\r\nsince extinct, and who still remained at the stage of speechless ape-men\r\n(Alalus, or Pithecanthropus). Two of these species, a woolly-haired and\r\na straight-haired, which were most strongly divergent, and consequently\r\noverpowered the others in the struggle for life, became the primary\r\nforms of the other remaining human species.\r\n\r\nThe main branch of woolly-haired men (Ulotrichi) at first spread only\r\nover the southern hemisphere, and then emigrated partly eastwards,\r\npartly westwards. Remnants of the eastern branch are the Papuans in New\r\nGuinea and Melanesia, who in earlier times were diffused much further\r\nwest (in further India and Sundanesia), and it was not until a late\r\nperiod that they were driven eastwards by the Malays. The Hottentots are\r\nthe but little changed remnants of the western branch; they immigrated\r\nto their present home from the north-east. It was perhaps during this\r\nmigration that the two nearly related species of Caffres and Negroes\r\nbranched off from them; but it may be that they owe their origin to a\r\npeculiar branch of ape-like men.\r\n\r\nThe second main branch of primæval straight-haired men (Lissotrichi),\r\nwhich is more capable of development, has probably left a but little\r\nchanged remnant of its common primary form—which migrated to the\r\nsouth-east—in the ape-like natives of Australia. Probably very closely\r\nrelated to these latter are the South Asiatic _primæval Malays_, or\r\n_Promalays_, which name we have previously given to the extinct,\r\nhypothetical primary form of the other six human species. Out of this\r\nunknown common primary form there seem to have arisen three diverging\r\nbranches, namely, the true Malays, the Mongols, and the Euplocomi; the\r\nfirst spread to the east, the second to the north, and the third\r\nwestwards.\r\n\r\nThe primæval home, or the “Centre of Creation,” of the Malays must be\r\nlooked for in the south-eastern part of the Asiatic continent, or\r\npossibly in the more extensive continent which existed at the time when\r\nfurther India was directly connected with the Sunda Archipelago and\r\neastern Lemuria. From thence the Malays spread towards the south-east,\r\nover the Sunda Archipelago as far as Borneo, then wandered, driving the\r\nPapuans before them, eastwards towards the Samoa and Tonga Islands, and\r\nthence gradually diffused over the whole of the islands of the southern\r\nPacific, to the Sandwich Islands in the north, the Mangareva in the\r\neast, and New Zealand in the south. A single branch of the Malayan tribe\r\nwas driven far westwards and peopled Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe second main branch of primæval Malays, that is, the Mongols, at\r\nfirst also spread in Southern Asia, and, radiating to the east, north,\r\nand north-west, gradually peopled the greater part of the Asiatic\r\ncontinent. Of the four principal races of the Mongol species, the\r\nIndo-Chinese must perhaps be looked upon as the primary group, out of\r\nwhich at a later period the other Coreo-Japanese and Ural-Altaian races\r\ndeveloped as diverging branches. The Mongols migrated in many ways from\r\nwestern Asia into Europe, where the species is still represented in\r\nnorthern Russia and Scandinavia by the Fins and Lapps, in Hungary by the\r\nkindred Magyars, and in Turkey by the Osmanlis.\r\n\r\n  PEDIGREE OF SEMITES\r\n\r\n  Amharites                +Moors+                                     +Jews+\r\n      |           Tigrites    |

earlier times connected with the\r\nformer continent by a broad isthmus. The Arctic tribes, or Polar men,\r\nthe Hyperboreans of north-eastern Asia, and the Esquimaux of the\r\nextreme north of America, must probably be regarded as an offshoot of\r\nthis branch, which became peculiarly degenerated by unfavourable\r\nconditions of existence. The principal portion of the Mongolian\r\nimmigrants, however, migrated to the south, and gradually spread over\r\nthe whole of America, first over the north, later over South America.\r\n\r\nThe third and most important main branch of primæval Malays, the\r\ncurly-haired races, or Euplocomi, have probably left in the Dravidas of\r\nHindostan and Ceylon, that species of man which differs least from the\r\ncommon primary form of the Euplocomi. The principal portion of the\r\nlatter, namely, the Mediterranean species, migrated from their primæval\r\nhome (Hindostan?) westwards, and peopled the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, south-western Asia, north Africa, and Europe. The\r\nNubians, in the north-east of Africa, must perhaps be regarded as an\r\noffshoot of the primæval Semitic tribes, who migrated far across central\r\nAfrica almost to the western shores. The various branches of the\r\nIndo-Germanic race have deviated furthest from the common primary form\r\nof ape-like men. During classic antiquity and the middle ages, the\r\nRomanic branch (the Græco-Italo-Keltic group), one of the two main\r\nbranches of the Indo-Germanic species, outstripped all other branches in\r\nthe career of civilization, but at present the same position is occupied\r\nby the Germanic. Its chief representatives are the English and Germans,\r\nwho are in the present age laying the foundation for a new period of\r\nhigher mental development, in the recognition and completion of the\r\ntheory of descent. The recognition of the theory of development and the\r\nmonistic philosophy based upon it, forms the best criterion for the\r\ndegree of man’s mental development.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF THE TWELVE HUMAN SPECIES.\r\n\r\n   N.B.—Column A denotes the Average Number of the Population in\r\n   millions.

Hence it seems absolutely\r\nnecessary at the conclusion of our examination to refute at least the\r\nmost important of these, and at the same time, on the other hand, once\r\nmore to set forth the convincing arguments which bear testimony to the\r\ntruth of the theory of development.\r\n\r\nThe objections which are raised to the doctrine of descent may be\r\ndivided into two large groups: objections of faith and objections of\r\nreason. The objections of the first group originate in the infinitely\r\nvaried forms of faith held by human individuals, and need not here be\r\ntaken into consideration at all. For, as I have already remarked at the\r\nbeginning of this book, science, as an objective result of sensuous\r\nexperience, and of the striving of human reason after knowledge, has\r\nnothing whatever to do with the subjective ideas of faith, which are\r\npreached by a single man as the direct inspirations or revelations of\r\nthe Creator, and then believed in by the dependent multitude. This\r\nbelief, very different in different nations, only begins, as is well\r\nknown, where science ends. Natural Science believes, according to the\r\nmaxim of Frederick the Great, “that every one may go to heaven in his\r\nown fashion,” and only necessarily enters into conflict with particular\r\nforms of faith where they appear to set a limit to free inquiry and a\r\ngoal to human knowledge, beyond which we are not to venture. Now this is\r\ncertainly the case here in the highest degree, for the Theory of\r\nDevelopment applies itself to the solution of the greatest of scientific\r\nproblems—that of the creation, the coming into existence of things; more\r\nespecially the origin of organic forms, and of man at their head. It is\r\nhere certainly the right as well as the sacred duty of free inquiry, to\r\nfear no human authority, and courageously to raise the veil from the\r\nimage of the Creator, unconcerned as to what natural truth may lie\r\nconcealed beneath. The only Divine revelation which we recognise as\r\ntrue, is written everywhere in nature, and to every one with healthy\r\nsenses and a healthy reason it is given to participate in the unerring\r\nrevelation of this holy temple of nature, by his own inquiry and\r\nindependent discovery.\r\n\r\nIf we, therefore, here disregard all objections to the Doctrine of\r\nDescent which may be raised by the priests of the different religious\r\nfaiths, we must nevertheless endeavour to refute the most important of\r\nthose objections which seem more or less founded on science, and which\r\nwe grant might, at first sight, to a certain extent captivate us and\r\ndeter us from adopting the Doctrine of Descent. Many persons seem to\r\nthink the length of the periods of time required the most important of\r\nthese objections. We are not accustomed to deal with such immense\r\nperiods as are necessary for the history of the creation. It has already\r\nbeen mentioned that the periods, during which species originated by\r\ngradual transmutation, must not be calculated by single centuries, but\r\nby hundreds and by millions of centuries. Even the thickness of the\r\nstratified crust of the earth, the consideration of the immense space of\r\ntime which was requisite for its deposition from water, taken together\r\nwith the periods of elevation between the periods of depression,\r\nindicate a duration of time of the organic history of the earth which\r\nthe human intellect cannot realize. We are here in much the same\r\nposition as an astronomer in regard to infinite space. In the same way\r\nas the distances between the different planetary systems are not\r\ncalculated by miles but by Sirius-distances, each of which comprises\r\nmillions of miles, so the organic history of the earth must not be\r\ncalculated by thousands of years, but by palæontological or geological\r\nperiods, each of which comprises many thousands of years, and perhaps\r\nmillions, or even, milliards, of thousands of years. It is of little\r\nimportance how high the immeasurable length of these periods may be\r\napproximately estimated, because we are in fact unable with our limited\r\npower of imagination to form a true conception of these periods, and\r\nbecause we do not as in astronomy possess a secure mathematical basis\r\nfor fixing the approximate length of duration in numbers. But we most\r\npositively deny that we see any objection to the theory of development\r\nin the extreme length of these periods which are so completely beyond\r\nthe power of our imagination. It is, on the contrary, as I have already\r\nexplained in one of the preceding chapters, most advisable, from a\r\nstrictly philosophical point of view, to conceive these periods of\r\ncreation to be as long as possible, and we are by so much the less in\r\ndanger of losing ourselves in improbable hypotheses, the longer we\r\nconceive the periods for organic processes of development to have been.\r\nThe longer, for example, we conceive the Permian period to have been,\r\nthe easier it will be for us to understand how the important\r\ntransmutations took place within it which so essentially distinguish the\r\nfauna and flora of the Coal period from that of the Trias. The great\r\ndisinclination which most persons have to assume such immeasurable\r\nperiods, arises mainly from the fact of our having in early youth been\r\nbrought up in the notion that the whole earth is only some thousands of\r\nyears old. Moreover, human life, which at most attains the length of a\r\ncentury, is an extremely short space of time, and is not suitable as a\r\nstandard for the measurement of geological periods. Our life is a\r\nsingle drop in the ocean of eternity. The reader may call to mind the\r\nduration of life of many trees which is more than fifty times as long;\r\nfor example, the dragon-trees (Dracæna) and monkey bread-fruit trees\r\n(Adansonia), whose individual life exceeds a period of five thousand\r\nyears; and, on the other hand, the shortness of the individual life of\r\nmany of the lower animals, for example, the infusoria, where the\r\nindividual, as such, lives but a few days, or even but a few hours,\r\ncontrasts no less strongly with human longevity. This comparison brings\r\nthe relative nature of all measurement of time very clearly before us.\r\nIf the theory of development be true at all, there must certainly have\r\nelapsed immense periods, utterly inconceivable to us, during which the\r\ngradual historical development of the animal and vegetable kingdom\r\nproceeded by the slow transformation of species. There is, however, not\r\na single reason for accepting a definite limit for the length of these\r\nperiods of development.\r\n\r\nA second main objection which many, and more especially systematic\r\nzoologists and botanists, raise against the theory of descent, is that\r\nno _transition forms_ between the different species can be found,\r\nalthough according to the theory of descent they ought to be found in\r\ngreat numbers. This objection is partly well founded and partly not so,\r\nfor there does exist an extraordinarily large number of transition forms\r\nbetween living, as well as between extinct species, especially where we\r\nhave an opportunity of seeing and comparing very numerous individuals of\r\nkindred species. Those careful investigators of individual species who\r\nso frequently raise this objection are the very persons whom we\r\nconstantly find checked in their special series of investigations by the\r\nreally insuperable difficulty of sharply distinguishing individual\r\nspecies. In all systematic works, which are in any degree thorough, one\r\nmeets with endless complaints, that here and there species cannot be\r\ndistinguished because of the excessive number of transition forms. Hence\r\nevery naturalist defines the limit and the number of individual species\r\ndifferently. Some zoologists and botanists, as I mentioned (vol. i. p.\r\n276), assume in one and the same group of organisms ten species, others\r\ntwenty, others a hundred or more, while other systematic naturalists\r\nagain look upon these different forms only as varieties of a single\r\n“good” species. In most groups of forms there is, in fact, a\r\nsuperabundance of transition forms and intermediate stages between the\r\nindividual species.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in many species the forms of transition are actually\r\nwanting, but this is easily explained by the principle of divergence or\r\nseparation, the importance of which I have already explained. The\r\ncircumstance that the struggle for existence is the more active between\r\ntwo kindred forms the closer they stand to each other, must necessarily\r\nfavour the speedy extinction of the connecting intermediate forms\r\nbetween the two divergent species. If one and the same species produce\r\ndiverging varieties in different directions, which become new species,\r\nthe struggle between these new forms and the common primary form will be\r\nthe keener the less they differ from one another; but the stronger the\r\ndivergence the less dangerous the struggle. Naturally therefore, it is\r\nprincipally the connecting intermediate forms which will in most cases\r\nquietly die out, while the most divergent forms remain and reproduce\r\nthemselves as distinct “new species.” In accordance with this, we in\r\nfact no longer find forms of transition leading to those groups which\r\nare becoming extinct, as, for example, among birds, are the ostriches;\r\nand among mammals, the elephants, giraffes, Semi-apes, Edentata, and\r\nOrnithorhyncus. The groups of forms approaching their extinction no\r\nlonger produce new varieties, and naturally the species are what is\r\ncalled “good,” that is, the species are distinctly different from one\r\nanother. But in those animal groups where development and progress are\r\nstill active, where the existing species deviate into many new species\r\nby the formation of new varieties, we find an abundance of transition\r\nforms which cause the greatest difficulties to systematic naturalists.\r\nThis is the case, for example, among birds with the finches; among\r\nmammals with most of the rodents (more especially with those of the\r\nmouse and rat kind), with a number of the ruminants and with genuine\r\napes, more especially with the South American forms (Cebus), and many\r\nothers. The continual development of species by the formation of new\r\nvarieties here produces a mass of intermediate forms which connect the\r\nso-called “good” species, which efface their boundaries, and render\r\ntheir sharp specific distinction completely illusory.\r\n\r\nThe reason that this nevertheless does not cause a complete confusion of\r\nforms, nor a universal chaos in the structure of animals and vegetables,\r\nlies simply in the fact that there is a continual counteraction at work\r\nbetween progressive _adaptation_ on the one hand, and the _retentive_\r\npower of _inheritance_ on the other hand. The degree of stability and\r\nvariability manifested by every organic form is determined solely by the\r\nactual condition of the equilibrium between these two opposite\r\nfunctions. _Inheritance is the cause of the stability of species,\r\nadaptation the cause of their modification._ When therefore some\r\nnaturalists say that, according to the theory of descent, there ought to\r\nbe a much greater variety of forms, and others again, that there ought\r\nto be a much greater equality of forms, the former under-estimate the\r\nvalue of inheritance and the latter the value of adaptation. _The ratio\r\nof the interaction between inheritance and adaptation determines the\r\nratio of the stability and variability of organic species_ at any given\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the theory of descent, which, in the opinion of\r\nmany naturalists and philosophers is of great weight, is that it\r\nascribes the origin of organs which act for a definite purpose to causes\r\nwhich are either aimless or mechanical in their operation. This\r\nobjection seems to be especially important in regard to those organs\r\nwhich appear so excellently adapted for a certain definite purpose that\r\nthe most ingenious mechanician could not invent a more perfect organ for\r\nthe purpose. Such are, above all, the higher sense-organs of animals,\r\nthe eye and ear. If the eyes and auditory apparatus of the higher\r\nanimals alone were known to us, they would indeed cause great and\r\nperhaps insurmountable difficulties. How could we come to the conclusion\r\nthat the extraordinarily great and wonderful degree of perfection and\r\nconformity to purpose which we perceive in the eyes and ears of higher\r\nanimals, is in every respect attained solely by natural selection?\r\nFortunately, however, comparative anatomy and the history of\r\ndevelopment help us here over all obstacles; for when in the animal\r\nkingdom we follow the gradual progress towards perfection of the eyes\r\nand ears, step by step, we find such a finely graduated series of\r\nimprovement, that we can clearly follow the development of the most\r\ncomplex organs through all the stages towards perfection. Thus, for\r\nexample, the eye in the lowest animal is a simple spot of pigment which\r\ndoes not yet reflect any image of external objects, but at most\r\nperceives and distinguishes the different rays of light. Later, we find\r\nin addition to this a sensitive nerve; then there gradually develops\r\nwithin the spot of pigment the first beginning of the lens, a refractive\r\nbody which is now able to concentrate the rays of light and to reflect a\r\ndefinite image. But all the composite apparatus for the movement of the\r\neye and its accommodation to variations of light and distance are still\r\nabsent, namely, the various refractive media, the highly differentiated\r\nmembrane of the optic nerve, etc., which are so perfectly constructed in\r\nhigher animals. Comparative anatomy shows us an uninterrupted succession\r\nof all possible stages of transition, from the simplest organ to the\r\nmost highly perfected apparatus, so that we can form a pretty correct\r\nidea of the slow and gradual formation of even such an exceedingly\r\ncomplex organ. The like gradual progress which we observe in the\r\ndevelopment of the organ during the course of individual development,\r\nmust have taken place in the historical (phyletic) origin of the organ.\r\n\r\nMany persons when contemplating these most perfect organs—which\r\napparently were purposely invented and constructed by an ingenious\r\nCreator for a definite function, but which in reality have arisen by the\r\naimless action of natural selection—experience difficulties in arriving\r\nat a rational understanding of them, which are similar to those\r\nexperienced by the uncivilized tribes of nature when contemplating the\r\nlatest complicated productions of engineering. Savages who see a ship of\r\nthe line, or a locomotive engine for the first time, look upon these\r\nobjects as the productions of a supernatural being, and cannot\r\nunderstand how a man, an organism like themselves, could have produced\r\nsuch an engine. Even the uneducated classes of our own race cannot\r\ncomprehend such an intricate apparatus in its actual workings, nor can\r\nthey understand its purely mechanical nature. Most naturalists, however,\r\nas Darwin very justly remarks, stand in much the same position in regard\r\nto the forms of organisms as do savages to ships of the line and to\r\nlocomotive engines. A rational understanding of the purely mechanical\r\norigin of organic forms can only be acquired by a thorough and general\r\ntraining in Biology, and by a special knowledge of comparative anatomy\r\nand the history of development.\r\n\r\nAmong the remaining objections to the Theory of Descent, I shall here\r\nfinally refer to and refute but one more, as in the eyes of many\r\nunscientific men it seems to possess great weight. How are we, from the\r\nTheory of Descent, to conceive of the origin of the mental faculties of\r\nanimals, and more especially their specific expressions—the so-called\r\ninstincts? This difficult subject has been so minutely discussed by\r\nDarwin in a special chapter of his chief work (the seventh), that I must\r\nrefer the reader to it. We must regard instincts as essentially the\r\nhabits of the soul acquired by adaptation, and transmitted and fixed by\r\ninheritance through many generations. Instincts are, therefore, like all\r\nother habits, which, according to the laws of cumulative adaptation\r\n(vol. i. p. 233) and established inheritance (vol. i. p. 216), lead to\r\nthe origin of new functions, and thus also to new forms of the organs.\r\nHere, as everywhere, the interaction between function and organ goes\r\nhand in hand. Just as the mental faculties of man have been acquired by\r\nthe progressive adaptation of the brain, and been fixed by continual\r\ntransmission by inheritance, so the instincts of animals, which differ\r\nfrom them only in quantity, not in quality, have arisen by the gradual\r\nperfecting of their mental organ, that is, their central nervous system,\r\nby the interaction of Adaptation and Inheritance. Instincts, as is well\r\nknown, are inherited, but experiences and, consequently, new adaptations\r\nof the animal mind, are also transmitted by inheritance; and the\r\ntraining of domestic animals to different mental activities, which wild\r\nanimals are incapable of accomplishing, rests upon the possibility of\r\nmental adaptation. We already know a series of examples, in which such\r\nadaptations, after they had been transmitted through a succession of\r\ngenerations, finally appeared as innate instincts, and yet they have\r\nonly been acquired from the ancestors of the animals. Inheritance has\r\nhere caused the result of training to become instinct. The\r\ncharacteristic instincts of sporting dogs, shepherd’s dogs, and other\r\ndomestic animals, and the natural instincts of wild animals, which they\r\npossess at birth, were in the first place acquired by their ancestors by\r\nadaptation. They may in this respect be compared to man’s “knowledge a\r\npriori,” which, like all other knowledge, was originally acquired by our\r\nremote ancestors, “a posteriori,” by sensuous experience. As I have\r\nalready remarked, it is evident that “knowledge a priori” arose only by\r\nlong-enduring transmission, by inheritance of acquired adaptations of\r\nthe brain, out of originally empiric or experiential “knowledge a\r\nposteriori” (vol. i. p. 31).\r\n\r\nThe objections to the Theory of Descent here discussed and refuted are,\r\nI believe, the most important which have been raised against it; I\r\nconsider also that I have sufficiently proved to the reader their\r\nfutility. The numerous other objections which besides these have been\r\nraised against the Theory of Development in general, or against its\r\nbiological part, the Theory of Descent in particular, arise either from\r\nsuch a degree of ignorance of empirically established facts, or from\r\nsuch a want of their right understanding, and from such an incapacity to\r\ndraw the necessary conclusions, that it is really not worth the trouble\r\nto go further into the refutation. There are only some general points in\r\nregard to which, I should like, in a few words, to draw attention.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I must observe, that in order thoroughly to\r\nunderstand the doctrine of descent, and to be convinced of its absolute\r\ntruth, it is indispensable to possess a general knowledge of the whole\r\nof the domain of biological phenomena. _The theory of descent is a\r\nbiological theory_, and hence it may with fairness and justice be\r\ndemanded that those persons who wish to pass a valid judgment upon it\r\nshould possess the requisite degree of biological knowledge. Their\r\npossessing a special empiric knowledge of this or that domain of zoology\r\nor botany, is not sufficient; they must possess a _general insight into\r\nthe whole series of phenomena_, at least in the case of one of the three\r\norganic kingdoms. They ought to know what universal laws result from the\r\ncomparative morphology and physiology of organisms, but more especially\r\nfrom comparative anatomy, from the individual and the palæontological\r\nhistory of development, etc.; and they ought to have some idea of the\r\ndeep _mechanical, causal connection_ between all these series of\r\nphenomena. It is self-evident that a certain degree of general culture,\r\nand especially a philosophical education, is requisite; which is,\r\nhowever, unfortunately by many persons in our day, not considered at all\r\nnecessary. _Without the necessary connection of empirical knowledge and\r\nthe philosophical understanding of biological phenomena, it is\r\nimpossible to gain a thorough conviction of the truth of the Theory of\r\nDescent._\r\n\r\nNow I ask, in the face of this first preliminary condition for a true\r\nunderstanding of the Theory of Descent, what we are to think of the\r\nconfused mass of persons who have presumed to pass a written or oral\r\njudgment upon it of an adverse character? Most of them are unscientific\r\npersons, who either know nothing of the most important phenomena of\r\nBiology, or at least possess no idea of their deeper significance. What\r\nshould we say of an unscientific person who presumed to express an\r\nopinion on the cell-theory, without ever having seen cells; or of one\r\nwho presumed to question the vertebral-theory, without ever having\r\nstudied comparative anatomy? And yet one may meet with such ridiculous\r\narrogance any day in the history of the biological Theory of Descent.\r\nOne hears thousands of unscientific and but half-educated persons pass a\r\nfinal judgment upon it, although they know nothing either of botany or\r\nof zoology, of comparative anatomy or the theory of tissues, of\r\npalæontology or embryology. Hence it happens, as Huxley well says, that\r\nmost of the writings published against Darwin are not worth the paper\r\nupon which they are written.\r\n\r\nWe might add that there are many naturalists, and even celebrated\r\nzoologists and botanists, among the opponents of the Theory of Descent;\r\nbut these latter are mostly old stagers, who have grown grey in quite\r\nopposite views, and whom we cannot expect, in the evening of their\r\nlives, to submit to a reform in their conception of the universe, which\r\nhas become to them a fixed idea.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, expressly to be remarked, that not only a general\r\ninsight into the _whole_ domain of biological phenomena, but also a\r\nphilosophical understanding of it, are the necessary preliminary\r\nconditions for becoming convinced of and adopting the Theory of Descent.\r\nNow we shall find that these indispensable preliminary conditions are,\r\nunfortunately, by no means fulfilled by the majority of naturalists of\r\nthe present day. The immense amount of empirical facts with which the\r\ngigantic advances of modern natural science have recently made us\r\nacquainted has led to a prevailing inclination for the special study of\r\nsingle phenomena and of small and narrow domains. This causes the\r\nknowledge of other paths, and especially of Nature as a great\r\ncomprehensive whole, to be in most cases completely neglected. Every one\r\nwith sound eyes and a microscope, together with industry and patience\r\nfor study, can in our day attain a certain degree of celebrity by\r\nmicroscopic “discoveries,” without, however, deserving the name of a\r\nnaturalist. This name is deserved only by him who not merely strives to\r\n_know_ the individual phenomena, but who also seeks to _discover_ their\r\ncausal connection. Even in our own day, most palæontologists examine and\r\ndescribe fossils without knowing the most important facts of embryology.\r\nEmbryologists, on the other hand, follow the history of development of a\r\nparticular organic individual, without having an idea of the\r\npalæontological history of the whole tribe, of which fossils are the\r\nrecords. And yet these two branches of the organic history of\r\ndevelopment—ontogeny, or the history of the individual, and phylogeny,\r\nor the history of the tribe—stand in the closest causal connection, and\r\nthe one cannot be understood without the other. The same may be said of\r\nthe systematic and the anatomical part of Biology. There are even now,\r\nin zoology and botany, many systematic naturalists who work with the\r\nerroneous idea that it is possible to construct a natural system of\r\nanimals and plants simply by a careful examination of the external and\r\nreadily accessible forms of bodies, without a deeper knowledge of their\r\ninternal structure. On the other hand, there are anatomists and\r\nhistologists who think it possible to obtain a true knowledge of animal\r\nand vegetable bodies merely by a most careful examination of the inner\r\nstructure of the body of some individual species, without the\r\ncomparative examination of the bodily form of all kindred organisms. And\r\nyet here, as everywhere, the internal and external factors, to wit,\r\nInheritance and Adaptation, stand in the closest mutual relation, and\r\nthe individual can never be thoroughly understood without a comparison\r\nof it with the whole of which it is a part. To those one-sided\r\nspecialists we should like in Goethe’s words to say:—\r\n\r\n  We must, contemplating Nature,\r\n  Part as Whole, give equal heed to:\r\n  Nought is inward, nought is outward,\r\n  For the inner is the outer.[6]\r\n\r\nAnd again:—\r\n\r\n  Nature has neither kernel nor shell,\r\n  It is she that is All and All at once.[7]\r\n\r\nWhat is even more detrimental to the general understanding of nature as\r\na whole than this one-sided tendency, is _the want of a philosophical\r\nculture_, and this applies to most of the naturalists of the present\r\nday. The various errors of the earlier speculative nature-philosophy\r\nmade during the first thirty years of our century, have brought the\r\nwhole of philosophy into such bad repute with the exact empirical\r\nnaturalists, that they live in the strange delusion that it is possible\r\nto erect the edifice of natural science out of mere facts, without their\r\nphilosophic connection; in short, out of mere knowledge, without the\r\nunderstanding of it. But as a purely speculative and absolutely\r\nphilosophical system, which does not concern itself with the\r\nindispensable foundation of empirical facts, becomes a castle in the\r\nair, which the first real experiment throws to the winds; so, on the\r\nother hand, a purely empirical system, constructed of nothing but facts,\r\nremains a disorderly heap of stones, which will never deserve the name\r\nof an edifice. Bare facts established by experience are nothing but rude\r\nstones, and without their thoughtful valuation, without their\r\nphilosophic connection, no science can be established. As I have already\r\ntried to impress upon my reader, the _strong edifice of true monistic\r\nscience_, or what is the same thing, the _Science of Nature, exists only\r\nby the closest interaction, and the reciprocal penetration of philosophy\r\nand empirical knowledge_.\r\n\r\nThis lamentable estrangement between science and philosophy, and the\r\nrude empiricism which is now-a-days unfortunately praised by most\r\nnaturalists as “exact science,” have given rise to those strange freaks\r\nof the understanding, to those gross insults against elementary logic,\r\nand to that incapacity for forming the simplest conclusions which one\r\nmay meet with any day in all branches of science, but especially in\r\nzoology and botany. It is here that the neglect of a philosophical\r\nculture and training of the mind, directly avenges itself most\r\npainfully. It is not to be wondered at that the deep inner truth of the\r\nTheory of Descent remains a sealed book to those rude empiricists. As\r\nthe common proverb justly says: they cannot see the wood for the trees.\r\nIt is only by a more general philosophical study, and especially by a\r\nmore strictly logical training of the mind, that this sad state of\r\nthings can be remedied. (Compare Gen. Morph. i. 63; ii. p. 447.)\r\n\r\nIf we rightly consider this circumstance, and if we further reflect upon\r\nit in connection with the empirical foundation of the philosophical\r\ntheory of development, we shall at once see how we are placed respecting\r\nthe oft-demanded _proofs of the theory of descent_. The more the\r\ndoctrine of filiation has of late years made way for itself, and the\r\nmore all thoughtful, younger naturalists, and all truly\r\nbiologically-educated philosophers have become convinced of its inner\r\ntruth and absolute necessity, the louder have its opponents called for\r\nactual proofs. The same persons who, shortly after the publication of\r\nDarwin’s work, declared it to be “a groundless, fantastic system,” an\r\n“arbitrary speculation,” an “ingenious dream,” now kindly condescend to\r\ndeclare that the theory of descent certainly is a scientific\r\n“_hypothesis_,” but that it still requires to be “_proved_.” When these\r\nremarks are made by persons who do not possess the requisite\r\nempirico-philosophical culture, nor the necessary knowledge in\r\ncomparative anatomy, embryology, and palæontology, we cannot be much\r\noffended, and we refer them to the study of those sciences. But when\r\nsimilar remarks are made by acknowledged specialists, by teachers of\r\nzoology and botany, who certainly ought to possess a general insight\r\ninto the whole domain of their science, or who are actually familiar\r\nwith the facts of those scientific domains, then we are really at a loss\r\nwhat to say. Those who are not satisfied with the treasures of our\r\npresent empirical knowledge of nature as a basis on which to establish\r\nthe Theory of Descent, will not be convinced by any other facts which\r\nmay hereafter be discovered; for we can conceive no circumstances which\r\nwould furnish stronger or a more complete testimony to the truth of the\r\ndoctrine of filiation than is even now seen, for example, in the\r\nwell-known facts of comparative anatomy and ontogeny. I must here again\r\ndirect attention to the fact, _that all the great and general laws, and\r\nall the comprehensive series of phenomena of the most different domains\r\nof biology can only be explained and understood by the Theory of\r\nDevelopment_ (and especially by its biological part, the Theory of\r\nDescent), and that without it they remain completely inexplicable and\r\nincomprehensible. _The internal causal connection_ between them all\r\nproves the Theory of Descent to be the greatest _inductive law_ of\r\nBiology.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, I will once more name all those series of inductions,\r\nall those general laws of Biology, upon which this comprehensive law of\r\ndevelopment is firmly based.\r\n\r\n(1.) _The palæontological history of the development of organisms_, the\r\ngradual appearance and the historical succession of the different\r\nspecies and groups of species, the empirical laws of the palæontological\r\nchange of species, as furnished to us by the science of fossils, and\r\nmore especially the _progressive differentiation and perfecting_ of\r\nanimal and vegetable groups in the successive periods of the earth’s\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n(2.) _The individual history of development of organisms_, embryology\r\nand metamorphology, the gradual changes in the slow development of the\r\nbody and its particular organs, especially _the progressive\r\ndifferentiation and perfecting_ of the organs and parts of the body in\r\nthe successive periods of the individual development.\r\n\r\n(3.) _The inner causal connection between ontogeny and phylogeny_, the\r\nparallelism between the individual history of the development of\r\norganisms, and the palæontological history of the development of their\r\nancestors, a connection which is actually established by the laws of\r\n_Inheritance_ and _Adaptation_, and which may be summed up in the words:\r\nontogeny, according to the laws of inheritance and adaptation, repeats\r\nin its large features the outlines of phylogeny.\r\n\r\n(4.) _The comparative anatomy of organisms_, the proof of the essential\r\nagreement of the inner structure of kindred organisms, in spite even of\r\nthe greatest difference of external form in the various species; their\r\nexplanation by the causal dependence of the internal agreement of the\r\nstructure on _Inheritance_, the external dissimilarity of the bodily\r\nform on _Adaptation_.\r\n\r\n(5.) _The inner causal connection between comparative anatomy and the\r\nhistory of development_, the harmonious agreement between the laws of\r\nthe gradual development, _the progressive differentiation and\r\nperfecting_, as they may be seen in comparative anatomy on the one hand,\r\nin ontogeny and palæontology on the other.\r\n\r\n(6.) _Dysteleology, or the theory of purposelessness_, the name I have\r\ngiven to the _science of rudimentary organs_, of suppressed and\r\ndegenerated, aimless and inactive, parts of the body; one of the most\r\nimportant and most interesting branches of comparative anatomy, which,\r\nwhen rightly estimated, is alone sufficient to refute the fundamental\r\nerror of the teleological and dualistic conception of Nature, and to\r\nserve as the foundation of the mechanical and monistic conception of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n(7.) _The natural system of organisms_, the natural grouping of all the\r\ndifferent forms of Animals, Plants, and Protista into numerous smaller\r\nor larger groups, arranged beside and above one another; the kindred\r\nconnection of species, genera, families, orders, classes, tribes, etc.,\r\nmore especially, however, the _arboriform branching character of the\r\nnatural system_, which is the spontaneous result of a natural\r\narrangement and classification of all these graduated groups or\r\ncategories. The result attained in attempting to exhibit the\r\nrelationships of the mere forms of organisms by a tabular classification\r\nis only explicable when regarded as the expression of their actual\r\n_blood relationship_; _the tree shape of the natural system_ can only be\r\nunderstood as the actual _pedigree of the organisms_.\r\n\r\n(8.) _The chorology of organisms_, the science of the local distribution\r\nof organic species, of their _geographical_ and _topographical\r\ndispersion over the surface of the earth_, over the heights of\r\nmountains and in the depths of the ocean, but especially the important\r\nphenomenon that every species of organism proceeds from a so-called\r\n“_centre of creation_” (more correctly a “_primæval home_” or “_centre\r\nof distribution_”); that is, from a single locality, where it originated\r\nbut once, and whence it spread.\r\n\r\n(9.) _The œcology of organisms_, the knowledge of the sum of the\r\n_relations of organisms to the surrounding outer world_, to organic and\r\ninorganic conditions of existence; the so-called “_economy of nature_,”\r\nthe correlations between all organisms living together in one and the\r\nsame locality, their adaptation to their surroundings, their\r\nmodification in the struggle for existence, especially the circumstances\r\nof parasitism, etc. It is just these phenomena in “the economy of\r\nnature” which the unscientific, on a superficial consideration, are wont\r\nto regard as the wise arrangements of a Creator acting for a definite\r\npurpose, but which on a more attentive examination show themselves to be\r\nthe necessary results of mechanical causes.\r\n\r\n(10.) _The unity of Biology as a whole_, the deep inner connection\r\nexisting between all the phenomena named and all the other phenomena\r\nbelonging to zoology, protistics, and botany, and which are simply and\r\nnaturally explained by a single common principle. This principle can be\r\nno other than the common derivation of all the specifically different\r\norganisms from a single, or from several absolutely simple, primary\r\nforms like the Monera, which possess no organs. The Theory of Descent,\r\nby assuming this common derivation, throws a clear light upon these\r\nindividual series of phenomena, as well as upon their totality, without\r\nwhich their deeper causal connection would remain completely\r\nincomprehensible to us. The opponents of the Theory of Descent can in no\r\nway explain any single one of these series of phenomena or their deeper\r\nconnection with one another. So long as they are unable to do this, _the\r\nTheory of Descent remains the one adequate biological theory_.\r\n\r\nWe should, on account of the grand proofs just enumerated, have to adopt\r\nLamarck’s Theory of Descent for the explanation of biological phenomena,\r\neven if we did not possess Darwin’s Theory of Selection. The one is so\r\ncompletely and _directly proved_ by the other, and established by\r\nmechanical causes, that there remains nothing to be desired. The laws of\r\n_Inheritance_ and _Adaptation_ are universally acknowledged\r\n_physiological_ facts, the former traceable to _propagation_, the latter\r\nto the _nutrition_ of organisms. On the other hand, the _struggle for\r\nexistence_ is a _biological_ fact, which with mathematical necessity\r\nfollows from the general disproportion between the average number of\r\norganic individuals and the numerical excess of their germs. But as\r\nAdaptation and Inheritance in the struggle for life are in continual\r\ninteraction, it inevitably follows that _natural selection_, which\r\neverywhere influences and continually changes organic species, must, by\r\nmaking use of _divergence of character_, produce new species. Its\r\ninfluence is further especially favoured by the active and passive\r\n_migrations_ of organisms, which go on everywhere. If we give these\r\ncircumstances due consideration, the continual and gradual modification\r\nor transmutation of organic species will appear as a biological process,\r\nwhich must, according to causal law, of _necessity_ follow from the\r\nactual nature of organisms and their mutual correlations.\r\n\r\nThat even the _origin of man_ must be explained by this general organic\r\nprocess of transmutation, and that it is simply as well as naturally\r\nexplained by it, has, I believe, been sufficiently proved in my last\r\nchapter but one. I cannot, however, avoid here once more directing\r\nattention to the inseparable connection between this so-called “theory\r\nof apes,” or “pithecoid theory,” and the whole Theory of Descent. If the\r\nlatter is the greatest _inductive law_ of biology, then it of necessity\r\nfollows that the former is its most important _deductive law_. They\r\nstand and fall together. As all depends upon a right understanding of\r\nthis proposition, which in my opinion is very important, and which I\r\nhave therefore several times brought before the reader, I may be allowed\r\nto explain it here by an example.\r\n\r\nIn all mammals known to us the centre of the nervous system is the\r\nspinal marrow and the brain, and the centre of the vascular system is a\r\nquadrupal heart, consisting of two principal chambers and two\r\nante-chambers. From this we draw the general inductive conclusion that\r\nall mammals, without exception, those extinct, together with all those\r\nliving species as yet unknown to us, as well as the species which we\r\nhave examined, possess a like organization, a like heart, brain, and\r\nspinal marrow. Now if, as still happens every year, there be discovered\r\nin any part of the earth a new species of mammal, a new species of\r\nmarsupial, or a new species of deer, or a new species of ape, every\r\nzoologist knows with certainty at once, without having examined its\r\ninner structure, that this species must possess a quadruple heart, a\r\nbrain and spinal marrow, like all other mammals. Not a single naturalist\r\nwould ever think of supposing that the central nervous system of this\r\nnew species of mammal could possibly consist of a ventral cord with an\r\nœsophageal collar as in the insects, or of scattered pairs of knots as\r\nin the molluscs, or that its heart could be many-chambered as in flies,\r\nor one-chambered as in the tunicates. This completely certain and safe\r\nconclusion, although it is not based upon any direct experience, is a\r\n_deductive conclusion_. In the same way, as I have shown in a previous\r\nchapter, Goethe, from the comparative anatomy of mammals, established\r\nthe general inductive conclusion that they all possess a mid jawbone,\r\nand afterwards drew from it the special deductive conclusion that man,\r\nwho in all other respects does not essentially differ from other\r\nmammals, must also possess a like mid jawbone. He maintained this\r\nconclusion without having actually seen the human mid jawbone, and only\r\nproved its existence subsequently by actual observation (vol. i. p. 84).\r\n\r\nThe process of _induction_ is a logical system of forming conclusions\r\n_from the special to the general_, by which we advance from many\r\nindividual experiences to a general law; _deduction_, on the other hand,\r\ndraws a conclusion _from the general to the special_, from a general law\r\nof nature to an individual case. Thus the _Theory of Descent_ is,\r\nwithout doubt, a great _inductive law_, empirically based upon all the\r\nbiological experience cited above; the pithecoid theory, on the other\r\nhand, which asserts that man has developed out of lower, and in the\r\nfirst place out of ape-like mammals, is a _deductive law_ inseparably\r\nconnected with the general inductive law.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of the human race, the approximate outlines of which I gave\r\nin the last chapter but one, of course remains in detail (like all the\r\npedigrees of animals and plants previously discussed) a more or less\r\napproximate general hypothesis. This however does not affect the\r\napplication of the theory of descent to man. Here, as in all\r\ninvestigations on the derivation of organisms, one must clearly\r\ndistinguish between the general _theory_ of descent and the special\r\n_hypotheses_ of descent. The general _theory_ of descent claims full and\r\nlasting value, because it is an inductive law, based upon all the whole\r\nseries of biological phenomena and their inner causal connection. Every\r\nspecial _hypothesis_ of descent, on the other hand, has its special\r\nvalue determined by the existing condition of our biological knowledge,\r\nand by the extent of the objective empirical basis upon which we\r\ndeductively establish this particular hypothesis. Hence, all the\r\nindividual attempts to obtain a knowledge of the pedigree of any one\r\ngroup of organisms possesses but a temporary and conditional value, and\r\nany special hypothesis relating to it will become the more and more\r\nperfect the greater the advance we make in the comparative anatomy,\r\nontogeny, and palæontology of the group in question. The more, however,\r\nwe enter into genealogical details, and the further we trace the\r\nseparate off-shoots and branches of the pedigree, the more uncertain and\r\nsubjective becomes our special _hypothesis_ of descent on account of the\r\nincompleteness of our empirical basis. This however does no injury to\r\nthe general _theory_ of descent, which remains as the indispensable\r\nfoundation for really profound apprehension of biological phenomena.\r\nAccordingly, there can be no doubt that we can and must, with full\r\nassurance, regard the derivation of man—in the first place, from\r\nape-like forms; farther back, from lower mammals, and thus continually\r\nfarther back to lower stages of the vertebrata down to their lowest\r\ninvertebrate roots, nay, even down to a simple plastid—as a general\r\n_theory_. On the other hand, the special tracing of the human pedigree,\r\nthe closer definition of the animal forms known to us, which either\r\nactually belong to the ancestors of man, or at least stand in very close\r\nblood relationship to them, will always remain a more or less\r\napproximate _hypothesis_ of descent, all the more in danger of deviating\r\nfrom the real pedigree the nearer it endeavours to approach it by\r\nsearching for the individual ancestral forms. This state of things\r\nresults from the immense gaps in our palæontological knowledge, which\r\ncan, under no circumstances, ever attain to even an approximate\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\nA thoughtful consideration of this important circumstance at once\r\nfurnishes the answer to a question which is commonly raised in\r\ndiscussing this subject, namely, the question of scientific _proofs for\r\nthe animal origin of the human race_. Not only the opponents of the\r\nTheory of Descent, but even many of its adherents who are wanting in the\r\nrequisite philosophical culture, look too much for “signs” and for\r\nspecial empirical advances in the science of nature. They await the\r\nsudden discovery of a human race with tails, or of a talking species of\r\nape, or of other living or fossil transition forms between man and the\r\nape, which shall fill the already narrow chasm between the two, and thus\r\nempirically “prove” the derivation of man from apes. Such special\r\nmanifestations, were they ever so convincing and conclusive, would not\r\nfurnish the proof desired. Unthinking persons, or those unacquainted\r\nwith the series of biological phenomena, would still be able to maintain\r\nthe objections to those special testimonies which they now maintain\r\nagainst our theory.\r\n\r\nThe absolute certainty of the Theory of Descent, even in its application\r\nto man, is built on a more solid foundation; and its true inner value\r\ncan never be tested simply by reference to individual experience, but\r\nonly by a philosophical comparison and estimation of the treasures of\r\nall our biological experiences. The inestimable importance of the Theory\r\nof Descent is surely based upon this, that the theory follows of\r\nnecessity (as a general inductive law) from the comparative synthesis of\r\nall organic phenomena of nature, and more especially from the triple\r\nparallelism of comparative anatomy, of ontogeny, and phylogeny; and the\r\npithecoid theory under all circumstances (apart from all special proofs)\r\nremains as a special deductive conclusion which must of necessity be\r\ndrawn from the general inductive law of the Theory of Descent.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, all depends upon a right understanding of this\r\n_philosophical foundation of the Theory of Descent_ and of the\r\n_pithecoid theory_ which is inseparable from it. Many persons will\r\nprobably admit this, and yet at the same time maintain that all this\r\napplies only to the _bodily_, not to the _mental_ development of man.\r\nNow, as we have hitherto been occupied only with the former, it is\r\nperhaps necessary here to cast a glance at the latter, in order to show\r\nthat it is also subject to the great general law of development. In\r\ndoing this it is above all necessary to recollect that body and mind can\r\nin fact never be considered as distinct, but rather that both sides of\r\nnature are inseparably connected, and stand in the closest interaction.\r\nAs even Goethe has clearly expressed it—“matter can never exist and act\r\nwithout mind, and mind never without matter.” The artificial discord\r\nbetween mind and body, between force and matter, which was maintained by\r\nthe erroneous dualistic and teleological philosophy of past times has\r\nbeen disposed of by the advances of natural science, and especially by\r\nthe theory of development, and can no longer exist in face of the\r\nprevailing mechanical and monistic philosophy of our day. How human\r\nnature, and its position in regard to the rest of the universe, is to be\r\nconceived of according to the modern view, has been minutely discussed\r\nby Radenhausen in his “Isis,”(33) which is excellent and well worth\r\nperusal.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the origin of the human mind or the soul of man, we, in\r\nthe first place, perceive that in every human individual it develops\r\nfrom the beginning, step by step and gradually, just like the body. In a\r\nnewly born child we see that it possesses neither an independent\r\nconsciousness, nor in fact clear ideas. These arise only gradually when,\r\nby means of sensuous experience, the phenomena of the outer world affect\r\nthe central nervous system. But still the little child is wanting in all\r\nthose differentiated emotions of the soul which the full-grown man\r\nacquires only by the long experience of years. From this graduated\r\ndevelopment of the human soul in every single individual we can, in\r\naccordance with the inner causal connection between ontogeny and\r\nphylogeny, directly infer the gradual development of the human soul in\r\nall mankind, and further, in the whole of the vertebrate tribe. In its\r\ninseparable connection with the body, the human soul or mind has also\r\nhad to pass through all those gradual stages of development, all those\r\nvarious degrees of differentiation and perfecting, of which the\r\nhypothetical series of human ancestors sketched in a late chapter gives\r\nan approximate representation.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this conception generally greatly offends most persons\r\non their first becoming acquainted with the Theory of Development,\r\nbecause more than all others it most strongly contradicts the\r\ntraditional and mythological ideas, and the prejudices which have been\r\nheld sacred for thousands of years. But like all other functions of\r\norganisms, the human soul must necessarily have historically developed,\r\nand the comparative or empirical study of animal psychology clearly\r\nshows that this development can only be conceived of as a gradual\r\nevolution from the soul of vertebrate animals, as a gradual\r\ndifferentiation and perfecting which, in the course of many thousands of\r\nyears, has led to the glorious triumph of the human mind over its lower\r\nanimal ancestral stages. Here, as everywhere, the only way to arrive at\r\na knowledge of natural truth is to compare kindred phenomena, and\r\ninvestigate their development. Hence we must above all, as we did in the\r\nexamination of the bodily development, compare the highest animal\r\nphenomena on the one hand with the lowest animal phenomena, and on the\r\nother with the lowest human phenomena. The final result of this\r\ncomparison is this—that _between the most highly developed animal souls,\r\nand the lowest developed human souls, there exists only a small\r\nquantitative, but no qualitative difference_, and that this difference\r\nis much less than the difference between the lowest and the highest\r\nhuman souls, or than the difference between the highest and the lowest\r\nanimal souls.\r\n\r\nIn order to be convinced of this important result, it is above all\r\nthings necessary to study and compare the mental life of wild savages\r\nand of children.(32) At the lowest stage of human mental development are\r\nthe Australians, some tribes of the Polynesians, and the Bushmen,\r\nHottentots, and some of the Negro tribes. Language, the chief\r\ncharacteristic of genuine men, has with them remained at the lowest\r\nstage of development, and hence also their formation of ideas has\r\nremained at a low stage. Many of these wild tribes have not even a name\r\nfor animal, plant, colour, and such most simple ideas, whereas they have\r\na word for every single, striking _form_ of animal and plant, and for\r\nevery single sound or colour. Thus even the most simple abstractions are\r\nwanting. In many of these languages there are numerals only for one,\r\ntwo, and three: no Australian language counts beyond four. Very many\r\nwild tribes can count no further than ten or twenty, whereas some very\r\nclever dogs have been made to count up to forty and even beyond sixty.\r\nAnd yet the faculty of appreciating number is the beginning of\r\nmathematics! Nothing, however, is perhaps more remarkable in this\r\nrespect, than that some of the wildest tribes in southern Asia and\r\neastern Africa have no trace whatever of the first foundations of all\r\nhuman civilization, of family life, and marriage. They live together in\r\nherds, like apes, generally climbing on trees and eating fruits; they do\r\nnot know of fire, and use stones and clubs as weapons, just like the\r\nhigher apes. All attempts to introduce civilization among these, and\r\nmany of the other tribes of the lowest human species, have hitherto been\r\nof no avail; it is impossible to implant human culture where the\r\nrequisite soil, namely, the perfecting of the brain, is wanting. Not one\r\nof these tribes has ever been ennobled by civilization; it rather\r\naccelerates their extinction. They have barely risen above the lowest\r\nstage of transition from man-like apes to ape-like men, a stage which\r\nthe progenitors of the higher human species had already passed through\r\nthousands of years ago.(44)\r\n\r\nNow consider, on the other hand, the highest stages of development of\r\nmental life in the higher vertebrate animals, especially birds and\r\nmammals. If, as is usually done, we divide the different emotions of the\r\nsoul into three principal groups—sensation, will, and thought—we shall\r\nfind in regard to every one of them, that the most highly developed\r\nbirds and mammals are on a level with the lowest human beings, or even\r\ndecidedly surpass them. The _will_ is as distinctly and strongly\r\ndeveloped in higher animals as in men of character. In both cases it is\r\nnever actually free, but always determined by a causal chain of ideas.\r\n(Compare vol. i. p. 237.) In like manner, the different degrees of will,\r\nenergy, and passion are as variously graduated in higher animals as in\r\nman. The _affections_ of the higher animals are not less tender and warm\r\nthan those of man. The fidelity and devotion of the dog, the maternal\r\nlove of the lioness, the conjugal love and connubial fidelity of doves\r\nand love-birds are proverbial, and might serve as examples to many men.\r\nIf these virtues are to be called “instincts,” then they deserve the\r\nsame name in mankind. Lastly, with regard to _thought_, the comparative\r\nconsideration of which doubtless presents the most difficulties, this\r\nmuch may with certainty be inferred—especially from an examination of\r\nthe comparative psychology of cultivated domestic animals—that the\r\nprocesses of thinking, here follow the same laws as in ourselves.\r\nExperiences everywhere form the foundation of conceptions, and lead to\r\nthe recognition of the connection between cause and effect. In all\r\ncases, as in man, it is the path of induction and deduction which leads\r\nto the formation of conclusions. It is evident that in all these\r\nrespects the most highly developed animals stand much nearer to man than\r\nto the lower animals, although they are also connected with the latter\r\nby a chain of gradual and intermediate stages. In Wundt’s excellent\r\n“Lectures on the Human and Animal Soul,”(46) there are a number of\r\nproofs of this.\r\n\r\nNow, if instituting comparisons in both directions, we place the lowest\r\nand most ape-like men (the Austral Negroes, Bushmen, and Andamans,\r\netc.), on the one hand, together with the most highly developed animals,\r\nfor instance, with apes, dogs, and elephants, and on the other hand,\r\nwith the most highly developed men—Aristotle, Newton, Spinoza, Kant,\r\nLamarck, or Goethe—we can then no longer consider the assertion, that\r\nthe mental life of the higher mammals has gradually developed up to that\r\nof man, as in any way exaggerated. If one must draw a sharp boundary\r\nbetween them, it has to be drawn between the most highly developed and\r\ncivilized man on the one hand, and the rudest savages on the other, and\r\nthe latter have to be classed with the animals. This is, in fact, the\r\nopinion of many travellers, who have long watched the lowest human races\r\nin their native countries. Thus, for example, a great English traveller,\r\nwho lived for a considerable time on the west coast of Africa, says: “I\r\nconsider the negro to be a lower species of man, and cannot make up my\r\nmind to look upon him as ‘a man and a brother,’ for the gorilla would\r\nthen also have to be admitted into the family.” Even many Christian\r\nmissionaries, who, after long years of fruitless endeavours to civilize\r\nthese lowest races, have abandoned the attempt, express the same harsh\r\njudgment, and maintain that it would be easier to train the most\r\nintelligent domestic animals to a moral and civilized life, than these\r\nunreasoning brute-like men. For instance, the able Austrian missionary\r\nMorlang, who tried for many years without the slightest success to\r\ncivilize the ape-like negro tribes on the Upper Nile, expressly says:\r\n“that any mission to such savages is absolutely useless. They stand far\r\nbelow unreasoning animals; the latter at least show signs of affection\r\ntowards those who are kind towards them, whereas these brutal natives\r\nare utterly incapable of any feeling of gratitude.”\r\n\r\nNow, it clearly follows from these and other testimonies, that the\r\nmental differences between the lowest men and the animals are less than\r\nthose between the lowest and the highest men; and if, together with\r\nthis, we take into consideration the fact that in every single human\r\nchild mental life develops slowly, gradually, and step by step, from the\r\nlowest condition of animal unconsciousness, need we still feel offended\r\nwhen told that the mind of the whole human race has in like manner gone\r\nthrough a process of slow, gradual, and historical development? Can we\r\nfind it “degrading” to the human soul that, by a long and slow process\r\nof differentiation and perfecting, it has very gradually developed out\r\nof the soul of vertebrate animals? I freely acknowledge that this\r\nobjection, which is at present raised by many against the pithecoid\r\ntheory, is quite incomprehensible to me. On this point Bernhard Cotta,\r\nin his excellent “Geologie der Gegenwart,” very justly remarks: “Our\r\nancestors may be a great honour to us; but it is much better if we are\r\nan honour to them!”(31)\r\n\r\nOur Theory of Development explains the origin of man and the course of\r\nhis historical development in the only natural manner. We see in his\r\ngradually ascensive development out of the lower vertebrata, the\r\ngreatest triumph of humanity over the whole of the rest of Nature. We\r\nare proud of having so immensely outstripped our lower animal ancestors,\r\nand derive from it the consoling assurance that in future also, mankind,\r\nas a whole, will follow the glorious career of progressive development,\r\nand attain a still higher degree of mental perfection. When viewed in\r\nthis light, the Theory of Descent as applied to man opens up the most\r\nencouraging prospects for the future, and frees us from all those\r\nanxious fears which have been the scarecrows of our opponents.\r\n\r\nWe can even now foresee with certainty that the complete victory of our\r\nTheory of Development will bear immensely rich fruits—fruits which have\r\nno equal in the whole history of the civilization of mankind. Its first\r\nand most direct result—the complete reform of _Biology_—will necessarily\r\nbe followed by a still more important and fruitful reform of\r\n_Anthropology_. From this new theory of man there will be developed a\r\nnew _philosophy_, not like most of the airy systems of metaphysical\r\nspeculation hitherto prevalent, but one founded upon the solid ground of\r\nComparative Zoology. A beginning of this has already been made by the\r\ngreat English philosopher Herbert Spencer.(45) Just as this new monistic\r\nphilosophy first opens up to us a true understanding of the real\r\nuniverse, so its application to practical human life must open up a new\r\nroad towards moral perfection. By its aid we shall at last begin to\r\nraise ourselves out of the state of social barbarism in which,\r\nnotwithstanding the much vaunted civilization of our century, we are\r\nstill plunged. For, unfortunately, it is only too true, as Alfred\r\nWallace remarks with regard to this, at the end of his book of travels:\r\n“Compared with our wondrous progress in physical science and its\r\npractical applications, our system of government, of administering\r\njustice, of national education, and our whole social and moral\r\norganisation remains in a state of barbarism.”\r\n\r\nThis social and moral barbarism we shall never overcome by the\r\nartificial and perverse training, the one-sided and defective teaching,\r\nthe inner untruth and the external tinsel, of our present state of\r\ncivilization. It is above all things necessary to make a complete and\r\nhonest return to Nature and to natural relations. This return, however,\r\nwill only become possible when man sees and understands his true “place\r\nin nature.” He will then, as Fritz Ratzel has excellently remarked,(47)\r\n“no longer consider himself an _exception_ to natural laws, but begin to\r\nseek for what is lawful in his own actions and thoughts, and endeavour\r\nto lead a life _according_ to natural laws.” He will come to arrange his\r\nlife with his fellow-creatures—that is, the family and the state—not\r\naccording to the laws of distant centuries, but according to the\r\nrational principles deduced from knowledge of nature. Politics, morals,\r\nand the principles of justice, which are still drawn from all possible\r\nsources, will have to be formed in accordance with natural laws only. An\r\n_existence worthy of man_, which has been talked of for thousands of\r\nyears, will at length become a reality.\r\n\r\nThe highest function of the human mind is perfect knowledge, fully\r\ndeveloped consciousness, and the moral activity arising from it. “Know\r\nthyself!” was the cry of the philosophers of antiquity to their\r\nfellow-men who were striving to ennoble themselves. “Know thyself!” is\r\nthe cry of the Theory of Development, not merely to the individual, but\r\nto all mankind. And whilst increased knowledge of self becomes, in the\r\ncase of every individual man, a strong force urging to an increased\r\nattention to conduct, mankind as a whole will be led to a higher path of\r\nmoral perfection by the knowledge of its true origin and its actual\r\nposition in Nature. The simple religion of Nature, which grows from a\r\ntrue knowledge of Her, and of Her inexhaustible store of revelations,\r\nwill in future ennoble and perfect the development of mankind far beyond\r\nthat degree which can possibly be attained under the influence of the\r\nmultifarious religions of the churches of the various nations,—religions\r\nresting on a blind belief in the vague secrets and mythical revelations\r\nof a sacerdotal caste. Future centuries will celebrate our age, which\r\nwas occupied with laying the foundations of the Doctrine of Descent, as\r\nthe new era in which began a period of human development, rich in\r\nblessings,—a period which was characterized by the victory of free\r\ninquiry over the despotism of authority, and by the powerful ennobling\r\ninfluence of the Monistic Philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] With the exception of a single specimen of the bones of a foot,\r\n  preserved in the cabinet of Amherst College.—E. R. L.\r\n\r\n  [2] The primary stock of the Coniferæ divided into two branches at an\r\n  early period, into the Araucariæ on the one hand, and the Taxaceæ, or\r\n  yew-trees, on the other. The majority of recent Coniferæ are derived\r\n  from the former. Out of the latter the third class of the\r\n  Gymnosperms—the Meningos, or Gnetaceæ—were developed. This small but\r\n  very interesting class contains only three different genera—Gnetum,\r\n  Welwitschia, and Ephedra; it is, however, of great importance, as it\r\n  forms the transition group from the Coniferæ to the Angiosperms, and\r\n  more especially to the Dicotyledons.\r\n\r\n  [3] “Ueber ein Aequivalent der takonischen Schiefer Nordamerikas in\r\n  Deutschland.”\r\n\r\n  [4] The English word “Insects” might with advantage be used in the\r\n  Linnæan sense for the whole group of Arthropods.

Compare vol.\r\nii. p. 140. The egg of the Olynthus (Fig. 9), which represents the\r\ncommon ancestral form of all Calcareous Sponges, is a simple cell (Fig.\r\n1). From this there arises, by repeated division (Fig. 2), a globular,\r\nmulberry-like heap of numerous equi-formal cells (Morula, Fig. 3; vol.\r\nii. p. 125.) As the result of the change of these cells into an outer\r\nseries of clear ciliated cells (Exoderm) and an inner series of dark,\r\nnon-ciliated cells (Entoderm), the ciliated larva, or Planula, makes its\r\nappearance. This is oval in shape, and forms a cavity in its centre\r\n(gastric cavity, or primitive stomach, Fig. 6 _g_, with an opening\r\n(mouth-opening, or primitive mouth, Fig. 6 _o_); the wall of the gastric\r\ncavity consists of two layers of cells, or germ-layers, the outer\r\nciliated Exoderm (_e_) and the inner non-ciliated Entoderm (_i_). Thus\r\narises the exceedingly important stomach-larva, or Gastrula, which\r\nreappears in the most different tribes of animals as a common larval\r\nform (Fig. 5, seen from the surface; Fig. 6, in long section. Compare,\r\nvol. ii. pp. 126 and 281). After the Gastrula has swum about for some\r\ntime in the sea, it fastens itself securely to the sea-bottom, loses its\r\nouter vibratile processes, or cilia, and changes into the Ascula (Fig.\r\n7, seen from the surface; Fig. 8, in long section; letters as in Fig.\r\n6). This Ascula is the recapitulative form, according to the biogenetic\r\nfundamental law, the common ancestor of all Zoophytes, namely, the\r\nProtascus (vol. ii. pp. 129, 133). By the development of pores in the\r\nwall of the stomach and of three-rayed calcareous spicules, the Ascula\r\nchanges into the Olynthus (Fig. 9.) In Fig. 9 a piece is cut out from\r\nthe stomach-wall of the Olynthus in order to show the inside of the\r\nstomachal cavity, and the eggs which are forming on the surface (_g_).\r\nFrom the Olynthus the most various forms of Calcareous Sponges can\r\ndevelop. One of the most remarkable is the Ascometra (Fig. 10), a stock\r\nor colony from which different species, and in fact different generic\r\nforms, grow (on the left Olynthus, in the middle Nardorus, on the right\r\nSoleniscus, etc., etc.). Further details as to these most interesting\r\nforms, and their high importance for the Theory of Descent, may be found\r\nin my “Monograph of the Calcareous Sponges” (1872), especially in the\r\nfirst volume. (Compare vol. ii. pp. 160, 167).\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE I. (_Between pages 184 and 185, Vol. I._)\r\n\r\n_History of the Life of the most Simple Organism_, a Moneron (Protomyxa\r\naurantiaca). Compare vol. i. p. 184, and vol. ii. p. 53. The plate is a\r\nsmaller copy of the drawing in my “Monographie der Moneren” (Biologische\r\nStudien, 1 Heft, 1870; Taf. 1), of the developmental history of the\r\nProtomyxa aurantiaca; I have there also given a detailed description of\r\nthis remarkable Moneron (pp. 11-30). I discovered this most simple\r\norganism in January, 1867, during a stay in Lanzarote, one of the Canary\r\nIslands; and moreover I found it either adhering to, or creeping about\r\non the white calcareous shells of a small Cephalopod (vol. ii. p. 162),\r\nthe Spirula Peronii, which float there in masses on the surface of the\r\nocean, or are thrown up on the shore. The Protomyxa aurantiaca is\r\ndistinguished from the other Monera by the beautiful and bright\r\norange-red colour of its perfectly simple body, which consists merely of\r\nprimæval slime, or protoplasm. The fully developed Moneron is\r\nrepresented in Figs. 11 and 12, very much enlarged. When it is hungry\r\n(Fig. 11), there radiate from the surface of the globular corpuscule of\r\nplasm, quantities of tree-shaped, branching and mobile threads\r\n(pseudo-feet, or pseudopodia), which do not become retiformly\r\nconnected. When, however, the Moneron eats (Fig. 12), the mucous threads\r\nbecome variously connected, form net-works and enclose the extraneous\r\ncorpuscule which serves as food, which the threads afterwards draw into\r\nthe interior of the Protomyxa. Thus in Fig. 12 (above on the right), a\r\nsilicious and ciliated Whip-swimmer (Peridinium, vol. ii. pp. 51, 57),\r\nhas just been caught by the extended mucous filaments, and has been\r\ndrawn into the interior of the mucous globule, in which there already\r\nare several half digested silicious infusoria (Tintinoida), and Diatomeæ\r\n(Isthmia). Now, when the Protomyxa has eaten and grown sufficiently, it\r\ndraws in all its mucous filaments (Fig. 15), and contracts into the form\r\nof a globule (Fig. 16 and Fig. 1). In this state of repose the globule\r\nsecretes a simple gelatinous covering (Fig. 2), and after a time\r\nsubdivides into a large number of small mucous globules (Fig. 3). These\r\nsoon commence to move, become pear-shaped (Fig. 4), break through the\r\ncommon covering (Fig. 5), and then swim about freely in the ocean by\r\nmeans of a delicate whip-shaped process, like the Flagellata (vol. ii.\r\np. 57, Fig. 11). When they meet a Spirula shell, or any other suitable\r\nobject, they adhere to it, draw in their whip, and creep slowly about on\r\nit by means of form-changing processes (Figs. 6, 7, 8), like Protamœbæ\r\n(vol. i. p. 186, vol. ii. p. 52). These small mucous corpuscules take\r\nfood (Figs. 9, 10), and attain their full grown form (Figs. 11, 12),\r\neither by simple growth or by several of them fusing to form a larger\r\nprotoplasmic mass (Plasmodium, Figs. 13, 14).\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATES II. AND III. (_Between pages 294 and 295, Vol. I._)\r\n\r\n_Germs or Embryos of four different Vertebrate Animals_, namely,\r\nTortoise (_A_ and _E_), Hen (_B_ and _F_), Dog (_C_ and _G_), and Man\r\n(_D_ and _H_). Figs. _A_, _D_, an early stage of development; Figs. _E_,\r\n_H_, a later stage. All the eight embryos are represented as seen from\r\nthe right side, the curved back turned to the left. Figs. _A_ and _B_\r\nare seven times enlarged, Figs. _C_ and _D_ five times, Figs. _E_ and\r\n_H_ four times. Plate II. exhibits the very close blood relationship\r\nbetween birds and reptiles; Plate III. that between man and the other\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE IV. (_Between pages 34 and 35, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_The Hand, or Fore Foot, of nine different Mammals._ This plate is\r\nintended to show the importance of Comparative Anatomy to Phylogeny, in\r\nas much as it proves how the internal skeleton of the limbs is\r\ncontinually preserved by _inheritance_, although the external form is\r\nextremely changed by _adaptation_. The bones of the skeleton of the hand\r\nare drawn in white lines on the brown flesh and skin which surrounds\r\nthem. All the nine hands are represented in the same position, namely\r\nthe wrist (where the arm would be joined to it) is placed above, whilst\r\nthe ends of the fingers or toes are turned downwards. The thumb, or the\r\nfirst (large) fore-toe is on the left in every figure; the little\r\nfinger, or fifth toe is to the right at the edge of the hand. Each hand\r\nconsists of three parts, namely (i.) the _wrist_ (carpus), composed of\r\ntwo cross rows of short bones (at the upper side of the hand); (ii.) the\r\n_mid-hand_ (metacarpus), composed of five long and strong bones (marked\r\nin the centre of the hand by the numbers 1-5); and (iii.) the five\r\n_fingers_, or _fore toes_ (digiti), every one of which again consists of\r\nseveral (mostly from two to three), _toe-pieces_, or _phalanges_. The\r\nhand of _man_ (Fig. 1), in regard to its entire formation, stands\r\nmidway between that of the two large human apes, namely, that of the\r\n_gorilla_ (Fig. 2), and that of the _orang_ (Fig. 3). The fore paw of\r\nthe _dog_ (Fig. 4), is more different, and the hand or breast fin of the\r\n_seal_ (Fig. 5) still more so. The adaptation of the hand to the\r\nmovement of swimming, and its transformation into a fin for steering, is\r\nstill more complete in the _dolphin_ (Ziphius, Fig. 6). The extended\r\nfingers and bones of the central hand here have remained short and\r\nstrong in the swimming membrane, but they have become extremely long and\r\nthin in the _bat_ (Fig. 7), where the hand has developed into a wing.\r\nThe extreme opposite of the latter formation is the hand of the _mole_\r\n(Fig. 8), which has acquired a powerful spade-like form for digging,\r\nwith fingers which have become extremely short and thick. What is far\r\nmore like the human hand than these latter forms, is the fore paw of the\r\nlowest and most imperfect of all mammals, the Australian _beaked animal_\r\n(Ornithorhynchus, Fig. 9), which in its whole structure stands nearer to\r\nthe common, extinct, primary form of mammalia, than any known species.\r\nHence man differs less in the formation of the hand from this common\r\nprimary form than from the bat, mole, dolphin, seal, and many other\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE V. (_Between pages 84 and 85, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_Monophyletic, or One-rooted Pedigree of the Vegetable Kingdom_,\r\nrepresenting the hypothesis of the common derivation of all plants, and\r\nthe historical development of the different groups of plants during the\r\npalæontological periods of the earth’s history. The horizontal lines\r\ndenote the different smaller and larger periods of the organic history\r\nof the earth (which are spoken of in vol. ii. p. 14), and during which\r\nthe strata containing fossils were deposited. The vertical lines\r\nseparate the different main-classes and classes of the vegetable kingdom\r\nfrom one another. The arboriform and branching lines indicate, in an\r\napproximate manner, by their greater or less number and thickness, the\r\ngreater or less degree of development, differentiation, and perfecting\r\nwhich each class probably attained in each geological period. (Compare\r\nvol. ii. pp. 82, 83.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE VI. (_Between pages 130 and 131, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_Monophyletic, or One-rooted Pedigree of the Animal Kingdom_,\r\nrepresenting the _historical growth of the six animal tribes_ during the\r\npalæontological periods of the organic history of the earth. The\r\nhorizontal lines _g h_, _i k_, _l m_, and _n o_ divide the five large\r\nperiods of the organic history of the earth one from another. The field\r\n_g a b h_ comprises the archilithic, the field _i g h k_, the\r\npalæolithic, the field _l i k m_ the mesolithic, and the field _n l o m_\r\nthe cenolithic period. The short, anthropolithic period is indicated\r\nby the line _n o_. (Compare vol. ii. p. 14.) The height of the separate\r\nfields corresponds with the relative length of the periods indicated by\r\nthem, as they may approximately be estimated from the relative thickness\r\nof the neptunic strata deposited between them. (Compare vol. ii. p. 22.)\r\nThe archilithic and primordial period alone, during which the\r\nLaurentian, Cambrian, and Silurian strata were deposited, was probably\r\nconsiderably longer than the four subsequent periods taken together.\r\n(Compare vol. ii. pp. 10, 20.) In all probability the two tribes of\r\nworms and Zoophytes attained their full development during the\r\nmid-primordial period (in the Cambrian system); the star-fishes and\r\nmolluscs probably somewhat later (in the Silurian system); whereas the\r\narticulata and vertebrata are still increasing in variety and\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE VII. (_Between pages 146 and 147, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_Group of Animal-Trees_ (_Zoophytes, or Cœlenterata_) _in the\r\nMediterranean_. On the upper half of the plate is a swarm of swimming\r\nmedusæ and ctenophora; on the lower half a few bunches of corals and\r\nhydroid polyps adhering to the bottom of the sea. (Compare the system of\r\nZoophytes, vol. ii. p. 132, and on the opposite page their pedigree.)\r\nAmong the adhering Zoophytes at the bottom of the ocean there is, below\r\non the right hand, a large coral-colony (1), which is closely akin to\r\nthe red precious coral (Eucorallium), and like the latter belongs to the\r\ngroup of corals with eight rays (Octocoralla Gorgonida); the single\r\nindividuals (or persons) of the branching stock have the form of a star\r\nwith eight rays, consisting of eight tentacles, which surround the\r\nmouth. (Octocoralla, vol. ii. p. 143.) Directly below and in front of it\r\n(quite below on the right), is a small bush of hydroid polyps (2),\r\nbelonging to the group of bell-polyps, or Campanulariæ (vol. ii. p.\r\n146). A larger stock of hydroid polyps (3), belonging to the group of\r\ntube-polyps, or Tubullariæ, rises, to the left, on the opposite side,\r\nwith its long thin branches. At its base is spread a stock of silicious\r\nsponges (Halichondria) (4), with short, finger-shaped branches (vol.\r\nii. p. 139). Behind it, below on the left (5), is a very large marine\r\nrose (Actinia), a single individual from the class of six-rayed corals\r\n(Hexacoralla, vol. ii. p. 143). Its low, cylindrical body has a crown of\r\nvery numerous and large leaf-shaped tentacles. Below, in the centre of\r\nthe ground (6), is a sea-anemone (Cereanthus) from the group of\r\nfourfold corals (Tetracoralla). Lastly, on a small hill on the bottom\r\nof the sea, there rises, on the right above the corals (1) a cup-polyp\r\n(Lucernaria), as the representative of the stalked-jellies.\r\n(Podactinaria, or Calycozoa, vol. ii. p. 144.) Its cup-shaped, stalked\r\nbody (7) has eight globular clusters of small, knotted tentacles on its\r\nrim.\r\n\r\nAmong the _swimming Zoophytes_ which occupy the upper half of Plate\r\nVII., the hydromedusæ are especially remarkable, on account of their\r\nalteration of generation. (Compare vol. i. p. 206.) Directly above the\r\nLucernaria (7) floats a small tiara jelly (Oceania), whose bell-shaped\r\nbody has a process like a dome, the form of a papal tiara (8). From the\r\nopening of the bell there hangs a wreath of very fine and long\r\ntentacles. This Oceania is the offspring of a tube-polyp, resembling the\r\nadhering Tubularia below on the left (3). Beside this latter, on the\r\nleft, swims a large but very delicate hair-jelly (Æquorea). Its\r\ndisc-shaped, slightly arched body is just drawing itself together, and\r\npressing water out of the cavity of the cup lying below (9). The\r\nnumerous, long, and fine hair-like tentacles which hang down from the\r\nrim of the cup are drawn by the ejected water into a conical bunch,\r\nwhich towards the centre turns upwards like a collar, and is thrown into\r\nfolds. Above, in the middle of the cavity of the cup, hangs the stomach,\r\nthe mouth of which is surrounded by four lobes. This Æquorea is derived\r\nfrom a small bell-polyp, resembling the Campanularia (2). The small,\r\nslightly arched cap-jelly (Eucope), swimming above in the centre (10),\r\nis likewise derived from a similar bell-polyp. In these three last cases\r\n(8, 9, 10), as in the majority of the hydromedusæ, the alternation of\r\ngeneration consists in the freely swimming medusa (8, 9, 10), arising by\r\nthe formation of buds (therefore by non-sexual generation, vol. i. p.\r\n192), from adhering hydroid polyps (2, 3). These latter, however,\r\noriginate out of the fructified eggs of the medusæ (therefore by sexual\r\ngeneration, vol. i. p. 195). Hence the non-sexual, adhering generation\r\nof polyps (I., III., V., etc.) regularly alternates with the sexual,\r\nfreely swimming generation of medusæ (II., IV., VI., etc.). This\r\nalteration of generation can only be explained by the Theory of Descent.\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to a kindred form of propagation, which is still\r\nmore remarkable, and which I discovered in 1864, near Nice, in the\r\nElephant-jellies (Geryonida), and called _allœogony_, or _allœogenesis_.\r\nIn this case two completely distinct forms of medusa are descended from\r\none another; the larger and more highly developed generation (11),\r\nGeryonia, or Carmarina, is six-rayed, with six foliated sexual organs,\r\nand six very movable marginal filaments. From the centre of its\r\nbell-shaped cup, like the tongue of a bell, hangs a long proboscis, at\r\nthe end of which is the opening of the mouth and stomach. In the cavity\r\nof the stomach is a long, tongue-shaped bunch of buds (which on Plate\r\nVII. (_n_) is extended from the mouth on the left like a tongue). On\r\nthis tongue, when the Geryonia is sexually ripe, there bud a number of\r\nsmall medusæ. They are, however, not Geryoniæ, but belong to an entirely\r\ndistinct but very different form of medusa, namely, to the genus Cunina,\r\nof the family of the _Æginida_. This Cunina (12) is very differently\r\nconstructed; it has a flat, semi-globular cup without proboscis,\r\nconsists in early life of six divisions, later of sixteen, and has\r\nsixteen bag-shaped sexual organs, and sixteen short, stiff, and strongly\r\ncurved tentacles. A further explanation of this wonderful allœogenesis\r\nmay be found in my “Contributions to the Natural History of the\r\nHydromedusæ.” (_Leipzig_, Englemann, 1865), the first part of which\r\ncontains a monograph of the Elephant-jellies, or Geryonida, illustrated\r\nby six copper-plates.\r\n\r\nEven more interesting and instructive than these remarkable relations\r\nare the vital phenomena of the _Siphonophora_, whose wonderful\r\npolymorphism I have frequently spoken of, and described in a popular\r\nmanner in my lecture on “Differentiation in Nature and Human Life.”(37)\r\n(Compare vol. i. p. 270, and vol. ii. p. 140.) An example of this is\r\ngiven in Plate VII. in the drawing of the beautiful Physophora (13).\r\nThis swimming stock or colony of hydromedusæ is kept floating on the\r\nsurface of the sea by a small swimming bladder filled with air, which in\r\nthe drawing is seen rising above the surface of the water. Below it is a\r\ncolumn of four pairs of swimming bells, which eject water, and thereby\r\nset the whole colony in motion. At the lower end of the column of\r\nswimming bells is a crown-shaped wreath of curved spindle-shaped\r\n_sensitive polyps_, which also serve as a covering, under the protection\r\nof which the other individuals of the stock (the eating, catching, and\r\nreproductive persons) are hidden. The _ontogenesis_ of the Siphonophora\r\n(and especially of this Physophora), I first observed in Lanzerote, one\r\nof the Canary Islands, in 1866, and described in my “History of the\r\nDevelopment of the Siphonophora,” and added fourteen plates for its\r\nexplanation. (Utrecht, 1869). It is rich in interesting facts, which can\r\nonly be explained by the Theory of Descent.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance, which is also only explicable by the Theory of\r\nDescent, is the remarkable change of generation in the higher medusæ,\r\nthe disc-jellies (Discomedusæ, vol. ii. p. 136), a representative of\r\nwhich is given at the top of Plate VII., in the centre (rather in the\r\nbackground), namely, a Pelagia (14). From the bottom of the bell-shaped\r\ncup, which is strongly arched and the rim of which is neatly indented,\r\nthere hang four very long and strong arms. The non-sexual polyps, from\r\nwhich these disc-jellies are derived, are exceedingly simple primæval\r\npolyps, differing very little from the common fresh-water polyp (Hydra).\r\nThe alternation of generation in these Discomedusæ has also been\r\ndescribed in my lecture on Differentiation,(37) and there illustrated by\r\nthe Aurelia by way of example.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last class of Zoophytes, the group of comb-jellies\r\n(Ctenophora, vol. ii. p. 142), has two representatives on Plate VII. To\r\nthe left, in the centre, between the Æquorea (9), the Physophora (13),\r\nand the Cunina (12), is a long and thin band like a belt (15), winding\r\nlike a snake; this is the large and splendid _Venus’ girdle_ of the\r\nMediterranean (Cestum), the colours of which are as varied as those of\r\nthe rainbow. The actual body of the animal, which lies in the centre of\r\nthe long belt, is very small, and constructed exactly like that of the\r\n_melon-jelly_ (Cydippe), which floats above to the left (16). On the\r\nlatter are visible the eight characteristic fringed bands, or ciliated\r\ncombs, of the ctenophora, and also two long tentacles which extend right\r\nacross the page, and are fringed with still finer threads.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATES VIII. AND IX. (_Between pages 170 and 171, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_History of the Development of Star-fishes_ (_Echinoderma_, or\r\n_Estrella_). The two plates exhibit their alternation of generation\r\n(vol. ii. p. 168), with an example from each of the four classes of\r\nStar-fishes. The sea-stars (Asterida) are represented by Uraster (_A_),\r\nthe sea-lilies (Crinoida) by Comatula (_B_), the sea-urchins (Echinida)\r\nby Echinus (_C_), and finally, the sea-cucumbers (Holothuriæ) by Synapta\r\n(_D_). (Compare vol. ii. pp. 166 and 176.) The successive stages of\r\ndevelopment are marked by the numbers 1-6.\r\n\r\nPlate VIII. represents the individual development of the first and\r\nnon-sexual generation of Star-fishes, that is, of the _nurses_ (usually,\r\nbut erroneously, called larvæ). These nurses possess the form-value of a\r\nsimple, unsegmented worm-individual. Fig. 1 represents the egg of the\r\nfour Star-fishes; and it, in all essential points, agrees with that of\r\nman and of other animals. (Compare vol. i. p. 297, Fig. 5.) As in man,\r\nthe protoplasm of the egg-cell (the yolk) is surrounded by a thick,\r\nstructureless membrane (zona pellucida), and contains a globular,\r\ncell-kernel (nucleus), as clear as glass, which again encloses a\r\nnucleolus. Out of the fertilised egg of the Star-fish (Fig. _A_ 1) there\r\ndevelops in the first place, by the repeated sub-division of cells, a\r\nglobular mass of homogeneous cells (Fig. 6, vol. i. p. 299), and this\r\nchanges into a very simple nurse, which has almost the same shape as a\r\nwooden shoe (Fig. _A_ 2-_D_ 2). The edge of the opening of the shoe is\r\nbordered by a fringe of cilia, the ciliary movements of which keep the\r\nmicroscopically small and transparent nurse swimming about freely in the\r\nsea. This fringe of cilia is marked in Fig. _A_ 2-_A_ 4, on Plate VII.,\r\nby the narrow alternately light and dark seam. The nurse then, in the\r\nfirst place, forms a perfectly simple intestinal canal for nutrition,\r\nmouth (_o_), stomach (_m_) and anus (_a_). Later, the windings of the\r\nfringe of cilia become more complicated, and there arise arm-like\r\nprocesses (Fig. _A_ 3-_D_ 3). In sea-stars (_A_ 4) and sea-urchins (_C_\r\n4) these arm-like processes, which are fringed with cilia, afterwards\r\nbecome very long. But in the case of sea-lilies (_B_ 3) and\r\nsea-cucumbers (_D_ 4), instead of this, the fringe of cilia, which at\r\nfirst, through winding in and out, forms one closed ring, changes\r\nsubsequently into a succession of separate ciliated girdles, one lying\r\nbehind the other.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of this curious nurse there then develops, by a\r\nnon-sexual process of generation, namely, by the formation of internal\r\nbuds or germ-buds (round about the stomach), the second generation of\r\nStar-fishes, which later on become sexually ripe. This second\r\ngeneration, which is represented on Plate IX. in a fully developed\r\ncondition, exists originally as a stock or cormus of five worms,\r\nconnected at one end in the form of a star, as is most clearly seen in\r\nthe sea-stars, the most ancient and original form of the star-fishes.\r\nThe second generation, which grows at the expense of the first,\r\nappropriates only the stomach and a small portion of the other organs of\r\nthe latter, but forms for itself a new mouth and anus. The fringe of\r\ncilia, and the other parts of the body of the nurse, afterwards\r\ndisappear. The second generation (_A_ 5-_D_ 5), is at first smaller or\r\nnot much larger than the nurse, whereas, by growth, it afterwards\r\nbecomes more than a hundred times, or even a thousand times, as large.\r\nIf the ontogeny of the typical representatives of the four classes of\r\nStar-fishes be compared, it is easily seen that the original kind of\r\ndevelopment has been best preserved in sea-stars (_A_) and sea-urchins\r\n(_C_) by inheritance, whereas in sea-lilies (_B_) and sea-cucumbers it\r\nhas been suppressed according to the laws of abbreviated inheritance\r\n(vol. i. p. 212).\r\n\r\nPlate IX. shows the fully developed and sexually mature animals of the\r\nsecond generation from the mouth side, which, in the natural position of\r\nStar-fishes (when creeping at the bottom of the sea), in sea-stars (_A_\r\n6) and sea-urchins (_C_ 6), is below, in sea-lilies (_B_ 6) above, and\r\nin sea-cucumbers (_D_ 6) in front. In the centre we perceive, in all the\r\nfour Star-fishes, the star-shaped, five-pointed opening of the mouth. In\r\nsea-stars, from each arm there extend several rows of little sucking\r\nfeet, from the centre of the under-side of each arm to the end. In\r\nsea-lilies (_B_ 6), each arm is split and feather-like from its base\r\nupwards. In sea-urchins (_C_ 6) the five rows of sucking feet are\r\ndivided by broader fields of spines. In sea-cucumbers, lastly (_D_ 6),\r\non the worm-like body it is sometimes only the five rows of little feet,\r\nsometimes only the feathery tentacles surrounding the mouth, from five\r\nto fifteen (in this case ten), that are externally visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATES X. AND XI. (_Between pages 174 and 175, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_Historical Development of the Crab-fish_ (Crustacea).—The two plates\r\nillustrate the development of the different Crustacea from the nauplius,\r\ntheir common primæval form. On Plate XI. six Crustacea, from six\r\ndifferent orders, are represented in a fully developed state, whereas on\r\nPlate X. the early nauplius stages are given. From the essential\r\nagreement between the latter we may, on the ground of the fundamental\r\nlaw of biogeny, with full assurance maintain the derivation of the\r\ndifferent Crustacea from a single, common primary form, a long since\r\nextinct Nauplius, as was first shown by Fritz Müller in his excellent\r\nwork “Für Darwin.”(16)\r\n\r\nPlate X. represents the _early nauplius stages_ from the ventral side,\r\nso that the three pairs of legs, on the short, three-jointed trunk are\r\ndistinctly visible. The first of these pairs of legs is simple and\r\nunsegmented, whereas the second and third pairs are forked. All three\r\npairs are furnished with stiff bristles, which, through the paddling\r\nmotion of the legs, serve as an apparatus for swimming. In the centre of\r\nthe body, the perfectly simple, straight intestinal canal is visible,\r\npossessing a mouth in front, and an anal orifice behind. In front, above\r\nthe mouth, lies a simple, single eye. All the six forms of nauplius\r\nentirely agree in all these essential characteristics of organization,\r\nwhereas the six fully developed forms of Crustacea belonging to them,\r\nPlate XI., are extremely different in organisation. The differences of\r\nthe six nauplius forms are confined to quite subordinate and unessential\r\nrelations in regard to size of body, and the formation of the covering\r\nof the skin. If they could be met with in this form in a sexually mature\r\ncondition, no zoologist would hesitate to regard them as six different\r\nspecies of one genus. (Compare vol. ii. p. 175.)\r\n\r\nPlate XI. represents those fully developed and sexually mature forms of\r\nCrustacea, as seen from the right side, which have ontogenetically\r\n(hence also phylogenetically) developed out of the six kinds of\r\nnauplius. Fig. _A c_ shows a freely swimming fresh-water crab (Limnetis\r\nbrachyurus) from the order of the Leaf-foot Crabs (Phyllopoda), slightly\r\nenlarged. Of all the still living Crustacea, this order, which belongs\r\nto the legion of Gill-foot Crabs (Branchiopoda), stands nearest to the\r\noriginal, common primary form of nauplius. The Limnetis is enclosed in a\r\nbivalved shell, like a mussel. Our drawing (which is copied from Grube)\r\nrepresents the body of a female animal lying in the left shell; the\r\nright half of the shell has been removed. In front, behind the eye, we\r\nsee the two feelers (antennæ), and behind them the twelve leaf-shaped\r\nfeet of the right side of the body, behind on the back (under the\r\nshell), the eggs. Above, in front, the animal is fixed to the shell.\r\n\r\nFig. _B c_ represents a common, freely swimming fresh-water crab\r\n(Cyclops quadricornis) from the order of Oar-legged crabs (Eucopepoda),\r\nhighly magnified. In front, below the eye, we see the two feelers of the\r\nright side, the foremost of which is longer than the hinder one. Behind\r\nthese are the gills, and then the four paddling legs of the right side.\r\nBehind these are the two large egg-sacks, which, in this case, are\r\nattached to the end of the hinder part of the body.\r\n\r\nFig. _C c_ is a parasitic Oar-legged crab (Lernæocera esocina), from the\r\norder of fish lice (Siphonostoma). These peculiar crabs, which were\r\nformerly regarded as worms, have originated, by adaptation to a\r\nparasitical life, out of freely swimming, Oar-legged crabs (Eucopepoda),\r\nand belong to the same legion (Copepoda, vol. ii. p. 176). By adhering\r\nto the gills on the skin of fish or other crabs, and feeding on the\r\njuice of these creatures, they forfeited their eyes, legs, and other\r\norgans, and developed into formless, inarticulated sacks, which, on a\r\nmere external examination, we should never suppose to be animals. On the\r\nventral side only there exist, in the shape of short, pointed bristles,\r\nthe last remains of legs which have now almost entirely disappeared. Two\r\nof these rudimentary pairs of legs (the third and fourth) are seen in\r\nour drawing on the right. Above, on the head, we see thick, shapeless\r\nappendages, the lower ones of which are split. In the centre of the body\r\nis seen the intestinal canal, which is surrounded by a dark covering of\r\nfat. At its posterior end is the ovary, and the cement-glands of the\r\nfemale sexual apparatus. The two large egg-sacks hang externally (as in\r\nthe Cyclops, Fig. _B_). Our Lernæocera is represented in half profile,\r\nand is copied from Claus. (Compare Claus, “Die Copepoden-Fauna von\r\nNizza. Ein Beitrag zur Characteristik der Formen und deren Abänderungen\r\nim Sinne Darwins.” Marburg, 1866).\r\n\r\nFig. _D c_ represents a so-called “duck mussel” (Lepas anatifera), from\r\nthe order of the Barnacle crabs (Cirripedia). These crabs, upon which\r\nDarwin has written a very careful monograph, are, like mussels, enclosed\r\nin a bivalved, calcareous case, and hence were formerly (even by Cuvier)\r\nuniversally regarded as a kind of mussel, or mollusc. It was only from a\r\nknowledge of their ontogeny, and their early nauplius form (_D n_, Plate\r\nVIII.), that their crustacean nature was proved. Our drawing shows a\r\n“duck mussel” of the natural size, from the right side. The right half\r\nof the bivalved shell has been removed, so that the body is seen lying\r\nin the left half of the shell. From the rudimentary head of the Lepas\r\nthere issues a long, fleshy stalk (curving upwards in our drawing); by\r\nmeans of it the Barnacle crab grows on rocks, ships, etc. On the ventral\r\nside are six pairs of feet. Every foot is forked and divided into two\r\nlong, curved, or curled “tendrils” furnished with bristles. Above and\r\nbehind the last pair of feet projects the thin cylindrical tail.\r\n\r\nFig. _E c_ represents a parasitic sack-crab (Sacculina purpurea) from\r\nthe order of Root-crabs (Rhizocephala). These parasites, by adaptation\r\nto a parasitical life, have developed out of Barnacle crabs (Fig. _D\r\nc_), much in the same way as the fish-lice (_C c_), out of the freely\r\nswimming Oar-legged crabs (_B c_). However, the suppression, and the\r\nsubsequent degeneration, of all of the organs, has gone much further in\r\nthe present case than in most of the fish-lice. Out of the articulated\r\ncrab, possessing legs, intestine, and eye, and which in an early stage\r\nas nauplius (_E n_, Plate VIII.), swam about freely, there has developed\r\na formless, unsegmented sack, a red sausage, which now only contains\r\nsexual organs (eggs and sperm) and an intestinal rudiment. The legs and\r\nthe eye have completely disappeared. At the posterior end is the opening\r\nof the genitals. From the mouth grows a thick bunch of numerous\r\ntree-shaped and branching root-like fibres. These spread themselves out\r\n(like the roots of a plant in the ground) in the soft hinder part of the\r\nbody of the hermit-crab (Pagurus), upon which the root-crab lives as a\r\nparasite, and from which it draws its nourishment. Our drawing (_E c_),\r\na copy of Fritz Müller’s, is slightly enlarged, and shows the whole of\r\nthe sausage-shaped sack-crab, with all its root-fibres, when drawn out\r\nof the body upon which it lives.\r\n\r\nFig. _F c_ is a _shrimp_ (Peneus Mülleri), from the order of _ten-foot_\r\ncrabs (Decapoda), to which our river cray-fish, and its nearest\r\nrelative, the lobster, and the short-tailed shore-crabs also belong.\r\nThis order contains the largest and, gastronomically, the most important\r\ncrabs, and belongs, together with the mouth-legged and split-legged\r\ncrabs, to the legion of the stalk-eyed mailed crabs (Podophthalma). The\r\nshrimp, as well as the river crab, has in front, on each side below the\r\neye, two long feelers (the first much shorter than the second), then\r\nthree jaws, and three jaw-feet, then five very long legs (the three\r\nfore ones of which, in the Peneus, are furnished with nippers, and the\r\nthird of which is the longest). Finally, on the first five joints of the\r\nhinder part of the body there are other five pairs of feet. This shrimp,\r\nwhich is one of the most highly developed and perfect crabs, originates\r\n(according to Fritz Müller’s important discovery) out of a nauplius (_F\r\nn_ Plate VIII.), and consequently proves that the higher Crustacea have\r\ndeveloped out of the same form as the lower ones, namely, the nauplius.\r\n(Compare vol. ii. p. 175.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATES XII. AND XIII. (_Between pages 200 and 201, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_Blood relationship between the Vertebrata and the Invertebrata._\r\n(Compare vol. ii. pp. 152 and 201.) It is definitely established by\r\nKowalewski’s important discovery, which was confirmed by Kupffer, that\r\nthe ontogeny of the lowest vertebrate animal—the Lancelet, or\r\nAmphioxus—agrees in all essential outlines completely with that of the\r\ninvertebrate Sea-squirts, or Ascidiæ, from the class of Sea-sacks, or\r\nTunicata. On our two plates, the ascidia is marked by _A_, the amphioxus\r\nby _B_. Plate XIII. represents these two very different animal-forms in\r\na _fully developed_ state, as seen from the _left side_, the end of the\r\nmouth above, the opposite end below. Hence, in both figures the dorsal\r\nside is to the right, the ventral to the left. Both figures are slightly\r\nmagnified, and the internal organisation of the animals is distinctly\r\nvisible through the transparent skin. The full-grown ascidia (Fig. _A_\r\n6) grows at the bottom of the ocean, from whence it cannot move, and\r\nclings to stones and other objects by means of peculiar roots (_w_) like\r\na plant. The full-grown amphioxus, on the other hand (Fig. _B_ 6), swims\r\nabout freely like a small fish. The letters on both figures indicate the\r\nsame parts: (_a_) orifice of the mouth; (_b_) orifice of the body, or\r\nporus abdominalis; (_c_) dorsal rod, or chorda dorsalis; (_d_)\r\nintestine; (_e_) ovary; (_f_) oviduct (same as the sperm-duct); (_g_)\r\nspinal marrow; (_h_) heart; (_i_) blind-sac of the intestine; (_k_)\r\ngill basket (respiratory cavity); (_l_) cavity of the body; (_m_)\r\nmuscles; (_n_) testicle (in the ascidia united with the ovary into a\r\nhermaphrodite gland); (_o_) anus; (_p_) genital orifice; (_q_)\r\nwell-developed embryos in the body cavity of the ascidia; (_r_) rays of\r\nthe dorsal fin of the amphioxus; (_s_) tail-fin of the amphioxus; (_w_)\r\nroots of the ascidia.\r\n\r\nPlate XII. shows the _Ontogenesis_, or the individual development of the\r\n_Ascidia_ (_A_) and the _Amphioxus_ (_B_) in five different stages\r\n(1-5). Fig. 1 is the egg, a simple cell like the egg of man and all\r\nother animals (Fig. _A_ 1 the egg of the ascidia, Fig. _B_ 1 the egg of\r\nthe amphioxus). The actual cell-substance, or the protoplasm of the\r\negg-cell (_z_), the so-called yolk, is surrounded by a covering\r\n(cell-membrane, or yolk-membrane), and encloses a globular cell-kernel,\r\nor nucleus (_y_), the latter, again, contains a kernel-body, or\r\nnucleolus (_x_); when the egg begins to develop, the egg-cell first\r\nsubdivides into two cells. By another sub-division there arise four\r\ncells (Fig. _A_ 2, _B_ 2), and out of these, by repeated sub-division,\r\neight cells (vol. i. p. 190, Fig. 4 _C_, _D_). By fluid gathering in the\r\ninterior these form a globular bladder bounded by a layer of cells. On\r\none spot of its surface the bladder is turned inwards in the form of a\r\npocket (Fig. _A_ 4, _B_ 4). This depression is the beginning of the\r\nintestine, the cavity (_d_ 1) of which opens externally by the\r\nprovisional larval-mouth (_d_ 4). The body-wall, which is at the same\r\ntime the stomach-wall, now consists of two layers of cells—the\r\ngerm-layers. The globular larva (Gastrula), now grows in length. Fig.\r\n_A_ 5 represents the larva of the ascidia, Fig. _B_ 5 that of the\r\namphioxus, as seen from the left side in a somewhat more advanced state\r\nof development. The orifice of the intestine (_d_ 1) has closed. The\r\ndorsal side of the intestine (_d_ 2) is concave, the ventral side (_d_\r\n3) convex. Above the intestinal tube, on its dorsal side, the neural\r\ntube, the beginning of the spinal marrow, is being formed, its cavity\r\nstill opens externally in front (_g_ 2). Between the spinal marrow and\r\nthe intestine has arisen the spinal rod, or chorda dorsalis (Notochord)\r\n(_c_), the axis of the inner skeleton. In the larva of the ascidia this\r\nrod (_c_) proceeds along the long rudder-tail, a larval organ, which is\r\ncast off in later transformation. Yet there still exist some very small\r\nascidiæ (Appendicularia) which do not become transformed and attached,\r\nbut which through life swim about freely in the sea by means of their\r\nrudder-tail.\r\n\r\nThe ontogenetic facts which are systematically represented on Plate XII.\r\nand which were first discovered in 1867, deserve the greatest attention,\r\nand, indeed, cannot be too highly estimated. They fill up the gap which,\r\naccording to the opinion of older zoologists existed between the\r\nvertebrate and the so-called “invertebrate” animals. This gap was\r\nuniversally regarded as so important and so undeniable, that even\r\neminent zoologists, who were not disinclined to adopt the theory of\r\ndescent, saw in this gap one of the chief obstacles against it. Now that\r\nthe ontogeny of the amphioxus and the ascidia has set this obstacle\r\ncompletely aside, we are for the first time enabled to trace the\r\npedigree of man beyond the amphioxus into the many-branching tribe of\r\n“invertebrate” worms, from which all the other higher animal tribes have\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nIf our speculative philosophers, instead of occupying themselves with\r\ncastles in the air, were to give their thoughts for some years to the\r\nfacts represented on Plates XII. and XIII., as well as to those on\r\nPlates II. and III., they would gain a foundation for true\r\nphilosophy—for the knowledge of the universe firmly based on\r\nexperience—which would be sure to influence all regions of thought.\r\nThese facts of ontogenesis are the indestructible foundations upon which\r\nthe monistic philosophy of future times will erect its imperishable\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIV. (_Between pages 206 and 207, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_Monophyletic, or One-rooted Pedigree of the Vertebrate Animal tribe_,\r\nrepresenting the hypothesis of the common derivation of all vertebrate\r\nanimals, and the historical development of their different classes\r\nduring the palæontological periods of the earth’s history. (Compare\r\nChapter XX. vol. ii. p. 192.) The horizontal lines indicate the periods\r\n(mentioned in vol. ii. p. 14) of the organic history of the earth during\r\nwhich the deposition of the strata containing fossils took place. The\r\nvertical lines separate the classes and sub-classes of vertebrata from\r\none another. The tree-shaped and branching lines, by their greater or\r\nlesser number and thickness, indicate the approximate degree of\r\ndevelopment, variety, and perfection, which each class probably attained\r\nin each geological period. In those classes which, on account of the\r\nsoft nature of their bodies, could not leave any fossil remains (which\r\nis especially the case with Prochordata, Acrania, Monorrhina, and\r\nDipneusta) the course of development is hypothetically suggested on the\r\nground of arguments derived from the three records of\r\ncreation—comparative anatomy, ontogeny, and palæontology. The most\r\nimportant starting-points for the hypothetical completion of the\r\npalæontological gaps are here, as in all cases, furnished by the\r\n_fundamental law of biogeny_, which asserts the inner _causal-nexus\r\nexisting between ontogeny and phylogeny_. (Compare vol. i. p. 310, and\r\nvol. ii. p. 200; also Plates VIII.-XIII.) In all cases we have to regard\r\nthe individual development (determined by the laws of Inheritance but\r\nmodified by the laws of Adaptation) as short and quick repetitions of\r\nthe palæontological development of the tribe. This proposition is the\r\n“ceterum censeo” of our theory of development.\r\n\r\nThe statements of the first appearance, or the period of the origin of\r\nthe individual classes and sub-classes of vertebrate animals (apart from\r\nthe hypothetical filling in mentioned just now), are taken as strictly\r\nas possible from palæontological facts. It must, however, be observed,\r\nthat in reality the origin of most of the groups probably took place one\r\nor two periods earlier than fossils now indicate. In this I agree with\r\nHuxley’s views; but on Plates V. and XIV. I have disregarded this\r\nconsideration in order not to go too far from palæontological facts.\r\n\r\nThe numbers signify as follows (compare also Chapter XX. and vol. ii.\r\npp. 204, 206):—1.

(_After page 369, Vol. II._)\r\n\r\n_Hypothetical Sketch of the Monophyletic Origin and the Diffusion of the\r\nTwelve Species of Men from Lemuria over the earth._ The _hypothesis_\r\nhere geographically sketched of course only claims an entirely\r\n_provisional value_, as in the present imperfect state of our\r\nanthropological knowledge it is simply intended to show how the\r\ndistribution of the human species, from a single primæval home, may be\r\n_approximately_ indicated. The probable primæval home, or “Paradise,” is\r\nhere assumed to be _Lemuria_, a tropical continent at present lying\r\nbelow the level of the Indian Ocean, the former existence of which in\r\nthe tertiary period seems very probable from numerous facts in animal\r\nand vegetable geography. (Compare vol. i. p. 361, and vol. ii. p. 315.)\r\nBut it is also very possible that the hypothetical “cradle of the human\r\nrace” lay further to the east (in Hindostan or Further India), or\r\nfurther to the west (in eastern Africa). Future investigations,\r\nespecially in comparative anthropology and palæontology, will, it is to\r\nbe hoped, enable us to determine the probable position of the primæval\r\nhome of man more definitely than it is possible to do at present.\r\n\r\nIf in opposition to our monophyletic hypothesis, the polyphyletic\r\nhypothesis—which maintains the origin of the different human species\r\nfrom several different species of anthropoid ape—be preferred and\r\nadopted, then, from among the many possible hypotheses which arise, the\r\none deserving most confidence seems to be that which assumes a double\r\npithecoid root for the human race namely, an Asiatic and an African\r\nroot. For it is a very remarkable fact, that the African man-like apes\r\n(gorilla and chimpanzee) are characterized by a distinctly long-headed,\r\nor dolichocephalous, form of skull, like the human species peculiar to\r\nAfrica (Hottentots, Caffres, Negroes, Nubians). On the other hand, the\r\nAsiatic man-like apes (especially the small and large orang), by their\r\ndistinct, short-headed, or brachycephalous, form of skull agree with\r\nhuman species especially characteristic of Asia (Mongols and Malays).\r\nHence, one might be tempted to derive the latter (the Asiatic man-like\r\napes and primæval men) from a common form of brachycephalous ape, and\r\nthe former (the African man-like apes and primæval men) from a common\r\ndolichocephalous form of ape.\r\n\r\nIn any case, tropical Africa and southern Asia (and between them\r\nLemuria, which formerly connected them) are those portions of the earth\r\nwhich deserve the first consideration in the discussion as to the\r\nprimæval home of the human race; America and Australia are, on the other\r\nhand, entirely excluded from it. Even Europe (which is in fact but a\r\nwestern peninsula of Asia) is scarcely of any importance in regard to\r\nthe “Paradise question.”\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident that the migrations of the different human species\r\nfrom their primæval home, and their geographical distribution, could on\r\nour Plate XV. be indicated only in a very general way, and in the\r\nroughest lines. The numerous migrations of the many branches and tribes\r\nin all directions, as well as the very important re-migrations, had to\r\nbe entirely disregarded. In order to make these latter in some degree\r\nclear, our knowledge would, in the first place, need to be much more\r\ncomplete, and secondly, we should have to make use of an atlas with a\r\nnumber of plates showing the various migrations. Our Plate XV. claims no\r\nmore than to indicate, in a very general way, the approximate\r\ngeographical dispersion of the twelve human species as it existed in the\r\nfifteenth century (before the general diffusion of the Indo-Germanic\r\nrace), and as it can be sketched out approximately, so as to harmonize\r\nwith our hypothesis of descent. The geographical barriers to diffusion\r\n(mountains, deserts, rivers, straits, etc.), have not been taken into\r\nconsideration in this general sketch of migration, because, in earlier\r\nperiods of the earth’s history, they were quite different in size and\r\nform from what they are to-day. The gradual transmutation of catarrhine\r\napes into pithecoid men probably took place in the tertiary period in\r\nthe hypothetical Lemuria, and the boundaries and forms of the present\r\ncontinents and oceans must then have been completely different from what\r\nthey are now. Moreover, the mighty influence of the ice period is of\r\ngreat importance in the question of the migration and diffusion of the\r\nhuman species, although it as yet cannot be more accurately defined in\r\ndetail. I here, therefore, as in my other hypotheses of development,\r\nexpressly guard myself against any dogmatic interpretation; they are\r\nnothing but _first attempts_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  ABYSSINIANS, ii. 323, 330\r\n\r\n  Acalephæ, ii. 141\r\n\r\n  Acœlomi, ii. 148, 151\r\n\r\n  Acrania, ii. 196, 198, 200, 204\r\n\r\n  Acyttaria, ii. 51, 62\r\n\r\n  Adaptation, i. 90, 156, 219\r\n\r\n  —— actual, i. 225, 231\r\n\r\n  —— correlative, i. 241\r\n\r\n  —— cumulative, i. 233\r\n\r\n  —— direct, i. 225, 231\r\n\r\n  —— divergent, i. 247\r\n\r\n  —— indirect, i. 224, 227\r\n\r\n  —— individual, i. 228\r\n\r\n  —— irregular, i. 229\r\n\r\n  —— monstrous, i. 229\r\n\r\n  —— potential, i. 224, 227\r\n\r\n  —— sexual, i. 230\r\n\r\n  —— universal, i. 231\r\n\r\n  —— unlimited, i. 249\r\n\r\n  Agassiz, Louis, i. 61\r\n\r\n  Agassiz’s conception of the universe, i. 65\r\n\r\n  —— essay on classification, i. 61\r\n\r\n  —— history of creation, i. 63\r\n\r\n  —— history of development, i. 64\r\n\r\n  —— idea of species, i. 65\r\n\r\n  Albuminous bodies, i. 331\r\n\r\n  Algæ, ii. 81, 82, 83\r\n\r\n  Alluvial system, ii. 15\r\n\r\n  Altaians, ii. 309, 317\r\n\r\n  Alternation of generations, i. 206\r\n\r\n  Americans, ii. 309, 318\r\n\r\n  Amnion animals, ii. 204, 219\r\n\r\n  Amniota, ii. 204, 219\r\n\r\n  Amœbæ, ii. 53, 279\r\n\r\n  Amœboidea, ii. 53\r\n\r\n  Amphibia, ii. 209, 216\r\n\r\n  Amphioxus, ii. 198, 285\r\n\r\n  Amphirrhina, ii. 203, 205\r\n\r\n  Anamnionata, ii. 204\r\n\r\n  Animal Plants, ii. 144\r\n\r\n  Angiospermæ, ii. 83, 111\r\n\r\n  Annelida, ii. 133, 149, 151\r\n\r\n  Anorgana, i. 5, 328\r\n\r\n  Anorganology, i. 6\r\n\r\n  Anthozoa, ii. 143\r\n\r\n  Anthropocentric conception of the universe, i. 38\r\n\r\n  Anthropoides, ii. 270, 275, 292\r\n\r\n  Anthropolithic period, ii. 15, 17\r\n\r\n  Anthropology, i. 7\r\n\r\n  Anthropomorphism, i. 18, 66\r\n\r\n  Ape-like men, ii. 293, 300\r\n\r\n  Apes, ii. 241, 268, 270\r\n\r\n  Arabians, ii. 323, 330\r\n\r\n  Arachnida, ii. 180, 182\r\n\r\n  Archelminthes, ii. 148\r\n\r\n  Archezoa, ii. 132, 134\r\n\r\n  Archigony, i. 183, 338\r\n\r\n  Archilithic period, ii. 8, 14\r\n\r\n  Arians, ii. 323, 331\r\n\r\n  Aristotle, i. 55, 76\r\n\r\n  Arthropoda, ii. 132\r\n\r\n  Articulata, ii. 119\r\n\r\n  Ascidia, ii. 152, 200\r\n\r\n  Ascones, ii. 141\r\n\r\n  Asterida, ii. 164, 166\r\n\r\n  Atavism, i. 207\r\n\r\n  Australians, ii. 308, 314\r\n\r\n  Autogeny, i. 339\r\n\r\n\r\n  B\r\n\r\n  BÄR, CARL ERNST, i. 109\r\n\r\n  —— doctrine of filiation, i. 109\r\n\r\n  —— theory of development, i. 294\r\n\r\n  —— types of animals, i. 53;

Let the reader be as adverse as\r\nhe may be to the writer’s philosophy, let him be as devoted to the\r\nobstructive as Mr. Buckle is to the progress party, let him be as\r\northodox in church creed as the other is heterodox, as dogmatic as the\r\nauthor is skeptical—let him, in short, find his prejudices shocked at\r\nevery turn of the argument, and all his prepossessions whistled down the\r\nwind—still, there is so much in this extraordinary volume to stimulate\r\nreflection and excite to inquiry, and provoke to earnest investigation,\r\nperhaps (to this or that reader) on a track hitherto untrodden, and\r\nacross the virgin soil of untilled fields, fresh woods and pastures new,\r\nthat we may fairly defy the most hostile spirit, the most mistrustful\r\nand least sympathetic, to read it through without being glad of having\r\ndone so, or, having begun it, or even glanced at almost any one of its\r\npages, to pass away unread.”—_London Times._\r\n\r\n“We have read Mr. Buckle’s volumes with the deepest interest. We owe him\r\na profound debt of gratitude. His influence on the thought of the\r\npresent age can not but be enormous, and if he gives us no more than we\r\nalready have in the two volumes of the _magnus opus_, he will still be\r\nclassed among the fathers and founders of the Science of History.”—_New\r\nYork Times._\r\n\r\n“Singularly acute, possessed of rare analytical power, imaginative but\r\nnot fanciful, unwearied in research, and gifted with wonderful talent in\r\narranging and molding his material, the author is as fascinating as he\r\nis learned.

Price, $4.00.\r\n\r\n“I have studied the subject of mind in other animals, as compared\r\nwith that of man, for a series of years, simply as a\r\n_physician-naturalist_.... Regarding the whole subject of mind in\r\nanimals from a medical and natural-history point of view, I have\r\nstudied it from first to last without any preconceived ideas,\r\nwith no theory to defend, support, or illustrate.... All that I\r\nattempt is to outline the subject of mind in the lower animals,\r\nto illustrate their possession of the higher mental faculties as\r\nthey occur in man.”—_Extract from Introduction._\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMemoirs of Madame de Remusat.

By the DUCHESS D’ABRANTES\r\n(Madame Junot). New edition. In two vols., 12mo. Cloth. Price, $3.00.\r\n\r\nThe interest in the first Napoleon and his Court, which has recently\r\nbeen so stimulated by the “Memoirs of Madame de Rémusat,” has induced\r\nthe publishers to reissue the famous “Memoirs of the Duchess\r\nd’Abrantes.” These memoirs, which hitherto have appeared in costly 8vo\r\nvolumes, are now published at a much lower price, to correspond with the\r\nDe Rémusat 12mo volume. The work at the present juncture will be read\r\nwith attention, especially as it presents a much more favorable portrait\r\nof the great Corsican than that limned by Madame de Rémusat.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe Life of David Glasgow Farragut, First Admiral of the United States\r\nNavy, embodying his Journal and Letters. By his Son, LOYALL FARRAGUT.\r\nWith Portraits, Maps, and Illustrations. 8vo. Cloth. Price, $4.00.\r\n\r\n“The book is a stirring one, of course; the story of Farragut’s life is\r\na tale of adventure of the most ravishing sort, so that, aside from the\r\nvalue of this work as an authentic biography of the greatest of American\r\nnaval commanders, the book is one of surpassing interest, considered\r\nmerely as a narrative of difficult and dangerous enterprises and heroic\r\nachievements.”—_New York Evening Post._\r\n\r\n\r\n_D.
