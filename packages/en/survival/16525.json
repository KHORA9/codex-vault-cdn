I have no quarrel with life\r\nor with time, for both have been polite to me; and I wish to give an\r\naccount of the past seven years to prove the politeness of life, and to\r\nshow how time has made amends to me for the forced resignation of my\r\nprofessional ambitions. For twenty-five years, up to 1895, I practised\r\nmedicine and surgery in a large city. I loved my profession beyond the\r\nlove of most men, and it loved me; at least, it gave me all that a\r\nreasonable man could desire in the way of honors and emoluments. The\r\nthought that I should ever drop out of this attractive, satisfying life,\r\nnever seriously occurred to me, though I was conscious of a strong and\r\npersistent force that urged me toward the soil. By choice and by\r\ntraining I was a physician, and I gloried in my work; but by instinct I\r\nwas, am, and always shall be, a farmer. All my life I have had visions\r\nof farms with flocks and herds, but I did not expect to realize my\r\nvisions until I came on earth a second time.\r\n\r\nI would never have given up my profession voluntarily; but when it gave\r\nme up, I had to accept the dismissal, surrender my ambitions, and fall\r\nback upon my primary instinct for diversion and happiness. The dismissal\r\ncame without warning, like the fall of a tree when no wind shakes the\r\nforest, but it was imperative and peremptory. The doctors (and they were\r\namong the best in the land) said, \"No more of this kind of work for\r\nyears,\" and I had to accept their verdict, though I knew that \"for\r\nyears\" meant forever.\r\n\r\nMy disappointment lasted longer than the acute attack; but, thanks to\r\nthe cheerful spirit of my wife, by early summer of that year I was able\r\nto face the situation with courage that grew as strength increased.\r\nFortunately we were well to do, and the loss of professional income was\r\nnot a serious matter. We were not rich as wealth is counted nowadays;\r\nbut we were more than comfortable for ourselves and our children, though\r\nI should never earn another dollar. This is not the common state of the\r\nphysician, who gives more and gets less than most other men; it was\r\nsimply a happy combination of circumstances. Polly was a small heiress\r\nwhen we married; I had some money from my maternal grandfather; our\r\nincome was larger than our necessities, and our investments had been\r\nfortunate. Fate had set no wolf to howl at our door.\r\n\r\nIn June we decided to take to the woods, or rather to the country, to\r\nsee what it had in store for us. The more we thought of it, the better I\r\nliked the plan, and Polly was no less happy over it. We talked of it\r\nmorning, noon, and night, and my half-smothered instinct grew by what it\r\nfed on. Countless schemes at length resolved themselves into a factory\r\nfarm, which should be a source of pleasure as well as of income. It was\r\nof all sizes, shapes, industries, and limits of expenditure, as the\r\nhours passed and enthusiasm waxed or waned. I finally compromised on\r\nfrom two hundred to three hundred acres of land, with a total\r\nexpenditure of not more than $60,000 for the building of my factory. It\r\nwas to produce butter, eggs, pork, and apples, all of best quality, and\r\nthey were to be sold at best prices. I discoursed at some length on\r\nfarms and farmers to Polly, who slept through most of the harangue. She\r\nafterward said that she enjoyed it, but I never knew whether she\r\nreferred to my lecture or to her nap.\r\n\r\nIf farming be the art of elimination, I want it not. If the farmer and\r\nthe farmer's family must, by the nature of the occupation, be deprived\r\nof reasonable leisure and luxury, if the conveniences and amenities must\r\nbe shorn close, if comfort must be denied and life be reduced to the\r\nelemental necessities of food and shelter, I want it not. But I do not\r\nbelieve that this is the case. The wealth of the world comes from the\r\nland, which produces all the direct and immediate essentials for the\r\npreservation of life and the protection of the race. When people cease\r\nto look to the land for support, they lose their independence and fall\r\nunder the tyranny of circumstances beyond their control. They are no\r\nlonger producers, but consumers; and their prosperity is contingent upon\r\nthe prosperity and good will of other people who are more or less alien.\r\nOnly when a considerable percentage of a nation is living close to the\r\nland can the highest type of independence and prosperity be enjoyed.\r\nThis law applies to the mass and also to the individual. The farmer, who\r\nproduces all the necessities and many of the luxuries, and whose\r\nproducts are in constant demand and never out of vogue, should be\r\nindependent in mode of life and prosperous in his fortunes. If this is\r\nnot the condition of the average farmer (and I am sorry to say it is\r\nnot), the fault is to be found, not in the land, but in the man who\r\ntills it.\r\n\r\nNinety-five per cent of those who engage in commercial and professional\r\noccupations fail of large success; more than fifty per cent fail\r\nutterly, and are doomed to miserable, dependent lives in the service of\r\nthe more fortunate. That farmers do not fail nearly so often is due to\r\nthe bounty of the land, the beneficence of Nature, and the\r\never-recurring seed-time and harvest, which even the most thoughtless\r\ncannot interrupt.\r\n\r\nThe waking dream of my life had been to own and to work land; to own it\r\nfree of debt, and to work it with the same intelligence that has made me\r\nsuccessful in my profession. Brains always seemed to me as necessary to\r\nsuccess in farming as in law, or in medicine, or in business. I always\r\nfelt that mind should control events in agriculture as in commercial\r\nlife; that listlessness, carelessness, lack of thrift and energy, and\r\nwaste, were the factors most potent in keeping the farmer poor and\r\nunreasonably harassed by the obligations of life. The men who cultivate\r\nthe soil create incalculable wealth; by rights they should be the\r\nnation's healthiest, happiest, most comfortable, and most independent\r\ncitizens. Their lives should be long, free from care and distress, and\r\nno more strenuous than is wholesome. That this condition is not general\r\nis due to the fact that the average farmer puts muscle before mind and\r\nbrawn before brains, and follows, with unthinking persistence, the crude\r\nand careless traditions of his forefathers.\r\n\r\nConditions on the farm are gradually changing for the better. The\r\nagricultural colleges, the experiment stations, the lecture courses\r\nwhich are given all over the country, and the general diffusion of\r\nagricultural and horticultural knowledge, are introducing among farming\r\ncommunities a more intelligent and more liberal treatment of land. But\r\nthese changes are so slow, and there is so much to be done before even\r\na small percentage of our six millions of farmers begin to realize their\r\nopportunities, that even the weakest effort in this direction may be of\r\nuse. This is my only excuse for going minutely into the details of my\r\nexperiment in the cultivation of land. The plain and circumstantial\r\nnarrative of how Four Oaks grew, in seven years, from a poor,\r\nill-paying, sadly neglected farm, into a beautiful home and a profitable\r\ninvestment, must simply stand for what it is worth. It may give useful\r\nhints, to be followed on a smaller or a larger scale, or it may arouse\r\ncriticisms which will work for good, both to the critic and to the\r\nauthor. I do not claim experience, excepting the most limited; I do not\r\nclaim originality, except that most of this work was new to me; I do not\r\nclaim hardships or difficulties, for I had none; but I do claim that I\r\nmade good, that I arrived, that my experiment was physically and\r\nfinancially a success, and, as such, I am proud of it, and wish to give\r\nit to the world.\r\n\r\nI was fifty-three years old when I began this experiment, and I was\r\nobliged to do quickly whatever I intended to do. I could devote any part\r\nof $60,000 to the experiment without inconvenience. My desire was to\r\ntest the capacity of ordinary farm land, when properly treated, to\r\nsupport an average family in luxury, paying good wages to more than the\r\nusual number of people, keeping open house for many friends, and at the\r\nsame time not depleting my bank account. I wished to experiment in\r\n_intensive farming_, using ordinary farm land as other men might do\r\nunder similar or modified circumstances. I believed that if I fed the\r\nland, it would feed me. My plan was to sell nothing from the farm except\r\nfinished products, such as butter, fruit, eggs, chickens, and hogs. I\r\nbelieved that best results would be attained by keeping only the best\r\nstock, and, after feeding it liberally, selling it in the most favorable\r\nmarket. To live on the fat of the land was what I proposed to do; and I\r\nask your indulgence while I dip into the details of this seven years'\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nYou may say that few persons have the time, inclination, taste, or money\r\nto carry out such an experiment; that the average farmer must make each\r\nyear pay, and that the exploiting of this matter is therefore of\r\ninterest to a very limited number. Admitting much of this, I still claim\r\nthat there is a lesson to every struggling farmer in this narrative. It\r\nshould teach the value of brain work on the farm, and the importance of\r\nintelligent cultivation; also the advantages of good seed, good tilth,\r\ngood specimens of well-bred stock, good food, and good care. Feed the\r\nland liberally, and it will return you much. Permit no waste in space,\r\nproduct, time, tools, or strength. Do in a small way, if need be, what I\r\nhave done on a large scale, and you will quickly commence to get good\r\ndividends. I have spent much more money than was really necessary on\r\nthe place, and in the ornamentation of Four Oaks. This, however, was\r\npart of the experiment. I asked the land not only to supply immediate\r\nnecessities, but to minister to my every want, to gratify the eye, and\r\nplease the senses by a harmonious fusion of utility and beauty. I wanted\r\na fine country home and a profitable investment within the same ring\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nWill you follow me through the search for the land, the purchase, and\r\nthe tremendous house-cleaning of the first year? After that we will take\r\nup the years as they come, finding something of special interest\r\nattaching naturally to each. I shall have to deal much with figures and\r\nstatistics, in a small way, and my pages may look like a school book,\r\nbut I cannot avoid this, for in these figures and statistics lies the\r\npractical lesson. Theory alone is of no value. Practical application of\r\nthe theory is the test. I am not imaginative. I could not write a\r\nromance if I tried. My strength lies in special detail, and I am willing\r\nto spend a lot of time in working out a problem. I do not claim to have\r\nspent this time and money without making serious mistakes; I have made\r\nmany, and I am willing to admit them, as you will see in the following\r\npages. I do claim, however, that, in spite of mistakes, I have solved\r\nthe problem, and have proved that an intelligent farmer can live in\r\nluxury on the fat of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HUNTING OF THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe location of the farm for this experiment was of the utmost\r\nimportance. The land must be within reasonable distance of the city and\r\nnear a railroad, consequently within easy touch of the market; and if\r\npossible it must be near a thriving village, to insure good train\r\nservice. As to size, I was somewhat uncertain; my minimum limit was 150\r\nacres and 400 the maximum. The land must be fertile, or capable of being\r\nmade so.\r\n\r\nI advertised for a farm of from two hundred to four hundred acres,\r\nwithin thirty-five miles of town, and convenient to a good line of\r\ntransportation. Fifty-seven replies came, of which forty-six were\r\nimpossible, eleven worth a second reading, and five worth investigating.\r\nMy third trip carried me thirty miles southwest of the city, to a\r\nvillage almost wholly made up of wealthy people who did business in\r\ntown, and who had their permanent or their summer homes in this village.\r\nThere were probably twenty-seven or twenty-eight hundred people in the\r\nvillage, most of whom owned estates of from one to thirty acres,\r\nvarying in value from $10,000 to $100,000. These seemed ideal\r\nsurroundings. The farm was a trifle more than two miles from the\r\nstation, and 320 acres in extent. It lay to the west of a\r\nnorth-and-south road, abutting on this road for half a mile, while on\r\nthe south it was bordered for a mile by a gravelled road, and the west\r\nline was an ordinary country road. The lay of the land in general was a\r\ngentle slope to the west and south from a rather high knoll, the highest\r\npoint of which was in the north half of the southeast forty. The land\r\nstretched away to the west, gradually sloping to its lowest point, which\r\nwas about two-thirds of the distance to the western boundary. A\r\nstraggling brook at its lowest point was more or less rampant in\r\nspringtime, though during July and August it contained but little water.\r\n\r\nWestward from the brook the land sloped gradually upward, terminating in\r\na forest of forty to fifty acres. This forest was in good condition. The\r\ntrees were mostly varieties of oak and hickory, with a scattering of\r\nwild cherry, a few maples, both hard and soft, and some lindens. It was\r\nmuch overgrown with underbrush, weeds, and wild flowers. The land was\r\ngenerally good, especially the lower parts of it. The soil of the higher\r\nground was thin, but it lay on top of a friable clay which is fertile\r\nwhen properly worked and enriched.\r\n\r\nThe farm belonged to an unsettled estate, and was much run down, as\r\nlittle had been done to improve its fertility, and much to deplete it.\r\nThere were two sets of buildings, including a house of goodly\r\nproportions, a cottage of no particular value, and some dilapidated\r\nbarns. The property could be bought at a bargain. It had been held at\r\n$100 an acre; but as the estate was in process of settlement, and there\r\nwas an urgent desire to force a sale, I finally secured it for $71 per\r\nacre. The two renters on the farm still had six months of occupancy\r\nbefore their leases expired. They were willing to resign their leases if\r\nI would pay a reasonable sum for the standing crops and their stock and\r\nequipments.\r\n\r\nThe crops comprised about forty acres of corn, fifty acres of oats, and\r\nfive acres of potatoes. The stock was composed of two herds of cows\r\n(seven in one and nine in the other), eleven spring calves, about forty\r\nhogs, and the usual assortment of domestic fowls. The equipment of the\r\nfarm in machinery and tools was meagre to the last degree. I offered the\r\nrenters $700 and $600, respectively, for their leasehold and other\r\nproperty. This was more than their value, but I wanted to take\r\npossession at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST VISIT TO THE FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the 8th of July, 1895, when I contracted for the farm; possession\r\nwas to be given August 1st. On July 9th, Polly and I boarded an early\r\ntrain for Exeter, intending to make a day of it in every sense. We\r\nwished to go over the property thoroughly, and to decide on a general\r\noutline of treatment. Polly was as enthusiastic over the experiment as\r\nI, and she is energetic, quick to see, and prompt to perform. She was to\r\nhave the planning of the home grounds--the house and the gardens; and\r\nnot only the planning, but also the full control.\r\n\r\nA ride of forty-five minutes brought us to Exeter. The service of this\r\nrailroad, by the way, is of the best; there is hardly a half-hour in the\r\nday when one cannot make the trip either way, and the fare is moderate:\r\n$8.75 for twenty-five rides,--thirty-five cents a ride. We hired an open\r\ncarriage and started for the farm. The first half-mile was over a\r\nwell-kept macadam road through that part of the village which lies west\r\nof the railway. The homes bordering this street are of fine proportions,\r\nand beautifully kept. They are the country places of well-to-do people\r\nwho love to get away from the noise and dirt of the city. Some of them\r\nhave ten or fifteen acres of ground, but this land is for breathing\r\nspace and beauty--not for serious cultivation. Beyond these homes we\r\nfollowed a well-gravelled road leading directly west. This road is\r\nbordered by small farms, most of them given over to dairying interests.\r\n\r\nPresently I called Polly's attention to the fact that the few apple\r\ntrees we saw were healthy and well grown, though quite independent of\r\nthe farmer's or the pruner's care. This thrifty condition of unkept\r\napple orchards delighted me. I intended to make apple-growing a\r\nprominent feature in my experiment, and I reasoned that if these trees\r\ndid fairly well without cultivation or care, others would do excellently\r\nwell with both.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the second section line and climbed a rather steep\r\nhill, we got the first glimpse of our possession. At the bottom of the\r\nwestern slope of this hill we could see the crossing of the\r\nnorth-and-south road, which we knew to be the east boundary of our land;\r\nwhile, stretching straight away before us until lost in the distant\r\nwood, lay the well-kept road which for a good mile was our southern\r\nboundary. Descending the hill, we stopped at the crossing of the roads\r\nto take in the outline of the farm from this southeast corner. The\r\nnorth-and-south road ran level for 150 yards, gradually rose for the\r\nnext 250, and then continued nearly level for a mile or more. We saw\r\nwhat Jane Austen calls \"a happy fall of land,\" with a southern exposure,\r\nwhich included about two-thirds of the southeast forty, and high land\r\nbeyond for the balance of this forty and the forty lying north of it.\r\nThere was an irregular fringe of forest trees on this southern slope,\r\nespecially well defined along the eastern border. I saw that Polly was\r\npleased with the view.\r\n\r\n\"We must enter the home lot from this level at the foot of the hill,\"\r\nsaid she, \"wind gracefully through the timber, and come out near those\r\nfour large trees on the very highest ground. That will be effective and\r\neasily managed, and will give me a chance at landscape gardening, which\r\nI am just aching to try.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said I, \"you shall have a free hand. Let's drive around the\r\nboundaries of our land and behold its magnitude before we make other\r\nplans.\"\r\n\r\nWe drove westward, my eyes intent upon the fields, the fences, the\r\ncrops, and everything that pertained to the place. I had waited so many\r\nyears for the sense of ownership of land that I could hardly realize\r\nthat this was not another dream from which I would soon be awakened by\r\nsomething real. I noticed that the land was fairly smooth except where\r\nit was broken by half-rotted stumps or out-cropping boulders, that the\r\ncorn looked well and the oats fair, but the pasture lands were too well\r\nseeded to dock, milkweed, and wild mustard to be attractive, and the\r\nfences were cheap and much broken.\r\n\r\nThe woodland near the western limit proved to be practically a virgin\r\nforest, in which oak trees predominated. The undergrowth was dense,\r\nexcept near the road; it was chiefly hazel, white thorn, dogwood, young\r\ncherry, and second growth hickory and oak. We turned the corner and\r\nfollowed the woods for half a mile to where a barbed wire fence\r\nseparated our forest from the woodland adjoining it. Coming back to the\r\nstarting-point we turned north and slowly climbed the hill to the east\r\nof our home lot, silently developing plans. We drove the full half-mile\r\nof our eastern boundary before turning back.\r\n\r\nI looked with special interest at the orchard, which was on the\r\nnortheast forty. I had seen it on my first visit, but had given it\r\nlittle attention, noting merely that the trees were well grown. I now\r\ncounted the rows, and found that there were twelve; the trees in each\r\nrow had originally been twenty, and as these trees were about\r\nthirty-five feet apart, it was easy to estimate that six acres had been\r\ngiven to this orchard. The vicissitudes of seventeen years had not been\r\nwithout effect, and there were irregular gaps in the rows,--here a sick\r\ntree, there a dead one. A careless estimate placed these casualties at\r\nfifty-five or sixty, which I later found was nearly correct. This left\r\n180 trees in fair health; and in spite of the tight sod which covered\r\ntheir roots and a lamentable lack of pruning, they were well covered\r\nwith young fruit. They had been headed high in the old-fashioned way,\r\nwhich made them look more like forest trees than a modern orchard. They\r\nhad done well without a husbandman; what could not others do with one?\r\n\r\nThe group of farm buildings on the north forty consisted of a one-story\r\ncottage containing six rooms--sitting room, dining room, kitchen, and a\r\nbedroom opening off each--with a lean-to shed in the rear, and some\r\nwoe-begone barns, sheds, and out-buildings that gave the impression of\r\nnot caring how they looked. The second group was better. It was south of\r\nthe orchard on the home forty, and quite near the road.\r\n\r\nWhy does the universal farm-house hang its gable over the public road,\r\nwithout tree or shrub to cover its boldness? It would look much better,\r\nand give greater comfort to its inmates, if it were more remote. A lawn\r\nleading up to a house, even though not beautiful or well kept, adds\r\ndignity and character to a place out of all proportion to its waste or\r\nexpense. I know of nothing that would add so much to the beautification\r\nof the country-side as a building line prohibiting houses and barns\r\nwithin a hundred yards of a public road. A staring, glaring farm-house,\r\nflanked by a red barn and a pigsty, all crowding the public road as\r\nhard as the path-master will permit, is incongruous and unsightly. With\r\nall outdoors to choose from, why ape the crowded city streets? With much\r\nto apologize for in barn and pigsty, why place them in the seat of\r\nhonor? Moreover, many things which take place on the farm gain\r\nenchantment from distance. It is best to leave some scope for the\r\nimagination of the passer-by. These and other things will change as\r\nfarmers' lives grow more gracious, and more attention is given to\r\nbeautifying country houses.\r\n\r\nThe house, whose gables looked up and down the street, was two stories\r\nin height, twenty-five feet by forty in the main, with a one-story ell\r\nrunning back. Without doubt there was a parlor, sitting room, and four\r\nchambers in the main, with dining room and kitchen in the ell.\r\n\r\n\"That will do for the head man's house, if we put it in the right place\r\nand fix it up,\" said Polly.\r\n\r\n\"My young lady, I propose to be the 'head man' on this farm, and I wish\r\nit spelled with a capital H, but I do not expect to live in that house.\r\nIt will do first-rate for the farmer and his men, when you have placed\r\nit where you want it, but I intend to live in the big house with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll not disagree about that, Mr. Headman.\"\r\n\r\nThe barns were fairly good, but badly placed. They were not worth the\r\nexpense of moving, so I decided to let them stand as they were until we\r\ncould build better ones, and then tear them down.\r\n\r\nWe drove in through a clump of trees behind the farm-house, and pushed\r\non about three hundred yards to the crest of the knoll. Here we got out\r\nof the carriage and looked about, with keen interest, in every\r\ndirection. The views were wide toward three points of the compass. North\r\nand northwest we could see pleasant lands for at least two miles;\r\ndirectly west, our eyes could not reach beyond our own forest; to the\r\nsouth and southwest, fruitful valleys stretched away to a range of\r\nwooded hills four miles distant; but on the east our view was limited by\r\nthe fringe of woods which lay between us and the north-and-south road.\r\n\r\n\"This is the exact spot for the house,\" said Polly. \"It must face to the\r\nsouth, with a broad piazza, and the chief entrance must be on the east.\r\nThe kitchens and fussy things will be out of sight on the northwest\r\ncorner; two stories, a high attic with rooms, and covered all over with\r\nyellow-brown shingles.\" She had it all settled in a minute.\r\n\r\n\"What will the paper on your bedroom wall be like?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I know perfectly well, but I shan't tell you.\"\r\n\r\nSeating myself on an out-cropping boulder, I began to study the\r\ngeography of the farm. In imagination I stripped it of stock, crops,\r\nbuildings, and fences, and saw it as bald as the palm of my hand. I\r\nrecited the table of long measure: Sixteen and a half feet, one rod,\r\nperch, or pole; forty rods, one furlong; eight furlongs, one mile. Eight\r\ntimes 40 is 320; there are 320 rods in a mile, but how much is 16-1/2.\r\ntimes 320? \"Polly, how much is 16-1/2 times 320?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother me now; I'm busy.\"\r\n\r\n(Just as if she could have told in her moment of greatest leisure!) I\r\nresorted to paper and pencil, and learned that there are 5280 feet in\r\neach and every mile. My land was, therefore, 5280 feet long and 2640\r\nfeet wide. I must split it in some way, by a road or a lane, to make all\r\nparts accessible. If I divided it by two lanes of twenty feet each, I\r\ncould have on either side of these lanes lots 650 feet deep, and these\r\nwould be quite manageable. I found that if these lots were 660 feet\r\nlong, they would contain ten acres minus the ten feet used for the lane.\r\nThis seemed a real discovery, as it simplified my calculations and\r\nrelieved me of much mental effort.\r\n\r\n\"Polly, I am going to make a map of the place,--lay it out just as I\r\nwant it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may leave the home forty out of your map; I will look after that,\"\r\nsaid the lady.\r\n\r\nIn my pocket I found three envelopes somewhat the worse for wear. This\r\nis how one of them looked when my map was finished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nI am not especially haughty about this map, but it settled a matter\r\nwhich had been chaotic in my mind. My plan was to make the farm a\r\nsoiling one; to confine the stock within as limited a space as was\r\nconsistent with good health, and to feed cultivated forage and crops. In\r\ndrawing my map, the forty which Polly had segregated left the northeast\r\nforty standing alone, and I had to cast about for some good way of\r\ntreating it. \"Make it your feeding ground,\" said my good genius, and\r\nthus the wrath of Polly was made to glorify my plans.\r\n\r\nThis feeding lot of forty acres is all high land, naturally drained. It\r\nwas near the obvious building line, and it seemed suitable in every way.\r\nI drew a line from north to south, cutting it in the middle. The east\r\ntwenty I devoted to cows and their belongings; the west twenty was\r\ndivided by right lines into lots of five acres each, the southwest one\r\nfor the hens and the other three for hogs.\r\n\r\nLooking around for Polly to show her my work, I found she had\r\ndisappeared; but soon I saw her white gown among the trees. Joining her,\r\nI said,--\r\n\r\n\"I have mapped seven forties; have you finished one?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not,\" she said. \"Mine is of more importance than all of yours; I\r\nwill give you a sketch this evening. This bit of woods is better than I\r\nthought. How much of it do you suppose there is?\"\r\n\r\n\"About seven acres, I reckon, by hook and by crook; enough to amuse you\r\nand furnish a lot of wild-flower seed to be floated over the rest of the\r\nfarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may plant what seeds you like on the rest of the farm, but I must\r\nhave wild flowers. Do you know how long it is since I have had them? Not\r\nsince I was a girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not very long, Polly. You don't look much more than a girl\r\nto-day. You shall have asters and goldenrod and black-eyed Susans to\r\nyour heart's content if you will always be as young.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe Time will turn backward for both of us out here, Mr. Headman.\r\nBut I'm as hungry as a wolf. Do you think we can get a glass of milk of\r\nthe 'farm lady'?\"\r\n\r\nWe tried, succeeded, and then started for home. Neither of us had much\r\nto say on the return trip, for our minds were full of unsolved problems.\r\nThat evening Polly showed me this plat of the home forty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE HIRED MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nModern farming is greatly handicapped by the difficulty of getting good\r\nhelp. I need not go into the causes which have operated to bring about\r\nthis condition; it exists, and it has to be met. I cannot hope to solve\r\nthe problem for others, but I can tell how I solved it for myself. I\r\ndetermined that the men who worked for me should find in me a\r\nconsiderate friend who would look after their interests in a reasonable\r\nand neighborly fashion. They should be well housed and well fed, and\r\nshould have clean beds, clean table linen and an attractively set table,\r\npapers, magazines, and books, and a comfortable room in which to read\r\nthem. There should be reasonable work hours and hours for recreation,\r\nand abundant bathing facilities; and everything at Four Oaks should\r\nproclaim the dignity of labor.\r\n\r\nFrom the men I expected cleanliness, sobriety, uniform kindness to all\r\nanimals, cheerful obedience, industry, and a disposition to save their\r\nwages. These demands seemed to me reasonable, and I made up my mind to\r\nadhere to them if I had to try a hundred men.\r\n\r\nThe best way to get good farm hands who would be happy and contented, I\r\nthought, was to go to the city and find men who had shot their bolts and\r\nfailed of the mark; men who had come up from the farm hoping for easier\r\nor more ambitious lives, but who had failed to find what they sought and\r\nhad experienced the unrest of a hand-to-mouth struggle for a living in a\r\nlarge city; men who were pining for the country, perhaps without knowing\r\nit, and who saw no way to get back to it. I advertised my wants in a\r\nmorning paper, and asked my son, who was on vacation, to interview the\r\napplicants. From noon until six o'clock my ante-room was invaded by a\r\nmotley procession--delicate boys of fifteen who wanted to go to the\r\ncountry, old men who thought they could do farm work, clerks and\r\njanitors out of employment, typical tramps and hoboes who diffused very\r\nnaughty smells, and a few--a very few--who seemed to know what they\r\ncould do and what they really wanted.\r\n\r\nJack took the names of five promising men, and asked them to come again\r\nthe next day. In the morning I interviewed them, dismissed three, and\r\naccepted two on the condition that their references proved satisfactory.\r\nAs these men are still at Four Oaks, after seven years of steady\r\nemployment, and as I hope they will stay twenty years longer, I feel\r\nthat the reader should know them. Much of the smooth sailing at the\r\nfarm is due to their personal interest, steadiness of purpose, and\r\ncheerful optimism.\r\n\r\nWilliam Thompson, forty-six years of age, tall, lean, wiry, had been a\r\nfarmer all his life. His wife had died three years before, and a year\r\nlater, he had lost his farm through an imperfect title. Understanding\r\nmachinery and being a fair carpenter, he then came to the city, with\r\n$200 in his pocket, joined the Carpenter's Union, and tried to make a\r\nliving at that trade. Between dull business, lock-outs, tie-ups, and\r\nstrikes, he was reduced to fifty cents, and owed three dollars for room\r\nrent. He was in dead earnest when he threw his union card on my table\r\nand said:--\r\n\r\n\"I would rather work for fifty cents a day on a farm than take my\r\nchances for six times as much in the union.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the sort of man I wanted: one who had tried other things and\r\nwas glad of a chance to return to the land. Thompson said that after he\r\nhad spent one lonesome year in the city, he had married a sensible woman\r\nof forty, who was now out at service on account of his hard luck. He\r\nalso told of a husky son of two-and-twenty who was at work on a farm\r\nwithin fifty miles of the city. I liked the man from the first, for he\r\nseemed direct and earnest. I told him to eat up the fifty cents he had\r\nin his pocket and to see me at noon of the following day. Meantime I\r\nlooked up one of his references; and when he came, I engaged him, with\r\nthe understanding that his time should begin at once.\r\n\r\nThe wage agreed upon was $20 a month for the first half-year. If he\r\nproved satisfactory, he was to receive $21 a month for the next six\r\nmonths, and there was to be a raise of $1 a month for each half-year\r\nthat he remained with me until his monthly wage should amount to\r\n$40,--each to give or take a month's notice to quit. This seemed fair to\r\nboth. I would not pay more than $20 a month to an untried man, but a\r\ngood man is worth more. As I wanted permanent, steady help, I proposed\r\nto offer a fair bonus to secure it. Other things being equal, the man\r\nwho has \"gotten the hang\" of a farm can do better work and get better\r\nresults than a stranger.\r\n\r\nThe transient farm-hand is a delusion and a snare. He has no interest\r\nexcept his wages, and he is a breeder of discontent. If the hundreds of\r\nthousands of able-bodied men who are working for scant wages in cities,\r\nor inanely tramping the country, could see the dignity of the labor\r\nwhich is directly productive, what a change would come over the face of\r\nthe country! There are nearly six million farms in this nation, and four\r\nmillions of them would be greatly benefited by the addition of another\r\nman to the working force. There is a comfortable living and a minimum of\r\n$180 a year for each of four million men, if they will only seek it and\r\nhonestly earn it. Seven hundred millions in wages, and double or treble\r\nthat in product and added values, is a consideration not unworthy the\r\nattention of social scientists. To favor an exodus to the land is, I\r\nbelieve, the highest type of benevolence, and the surest and safest\r\nsolution of the labor problem.\r\n\r\nBesides engaging Thompson, I tentatively bespoke the services of his\r\nwife and son. Mrs. Thompson was to come for $15 a month and a\r\nhalf-dollar raise for each six months, the son on the same terms as the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe other man whom I engaged that day was William Johnson, a tall, blond\r\nSwede about twenty-six years old. Johnson had learned gardening in the\r\nold country, and had followed it two years in the new. He was then\r\nemployed in a market gardener's greenhouse; but he wanted to change from\r\nunder glass to out of doors, and to have charge of a lawn, shrubs,\r\nflowers, and a kitchen garden. He spoke brokenly, but intelligently, had\r\nan honest eye, and looked to me like a real \"find.\" Polly, who was to be\r\nhis immediate boss, was pleased with him, and we took him with the\r\nunderstanding that he was to make himself generally useful until the\r\ntime came for his special line of work. We now had two men engaged (with\r\na possible third) and one woman, and my _venire_ was exhausted.\r\n\r\nTwo days later I again advertised, and out of a number of applicants\r\nsecured one man. Sam Jones was a sturdy-looking fellow of middle age,\r\nwith a suspiciously red nose. He had been bred on a farm, had learned\r\nthe carpenter's trade, and was especially good at taking care of\r\nchickens. His ambition was to own and run a chicken plant. I hired him\r\non the same terms as the others, but with misgivings on account of the\r\nflorid nose. This was on the 19th or 20th of July, and there were still\r\nten days before I could enter into possession. The men were told to\r\nreport for duty the last day of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBORING FOR WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe water supply was the next problem. I determined to have an abundant\r\nand convenient supply of running water in the house, the barns, and the\r\nfeeding grounds, and also on the lawn and gardens. I would have no\r\ncarrying or hauling of water, and no lack of it. There were four wells\r\non the place, two of them near the houses and two stock wells in the\r\nlower grounds. Near the well at the large house was a windmill that\r\npumped water into a small tank, from which it was piped to the barn-yard\r\nand the lower story of the house. The supply was inadequate and not at\r\nall to my liking.\r\n\r\nMy plan involved not only finding, raising, and distributing water, but\r\nalso the care of waste water and sewage. Inquiring among those who had\r\ndeep wells in the village, I found that good water was usually reached\r\nat from 180 to 210 feet. As my well-site was high, I expected to have to\r\nbore deep. I contracted with a well man of good repute for a six-inch\r\nwell of 250 feet (or less), piped and finished to the surface, for $2 a\r\nfoot; any greater depth to be subject to further agreement.\r\n\r\nIt took nearly three months to finish the water system, but it has\r\nproved wonderfully convenient and satisfactory. During seven years I\r\nhave not spent more than $50 for changes and repairs. We struck bed-rock\r\nat 197 feet, drilled 27 feet into this rock, and found water which rose\r\nto within 50 feet of the surface and which could not be materially\r\nlowered by the constant use of a three-inch power-pump. The water was\r\nmilky white for three days, in spite of much pumping; and then, and ever\r\nafter, it ran clear and sweet, with a temperature of 54° F. Well and\r\nwater being satisfactory, I cheerfully paid the well man $448 for the\r\njob.\r\n\r\nMeantime I contracted for a tank twelve by twelve feet, to be raised\r\nthirty feet above the well on eight timbers, each ten inches square,\r\nwell bolted and braced, for $430,--I to put in the foundation. This\r\nconsisted of eight concrete piers, each five feet deep in the clay,\r\nthree feet square, and capped at the level of the ground with a\r\nlimestone two feet square and eight inches thick. These piers were set\r\nin octagon form around the well, with their centres seven feet from the\r\nmiddle of the bore, making the spread of the framework fourteen feet at\r\nthe ground and ten at the platform. The foundation cost $32. A Rider\r\neight-inch, hot-air, wood-burning, pumping engine (with a two-inch pipe\r\nleading to the tank, and a four-inch pipe from it), filled the tank\r\nquickly; and it was surprising to see how little fuel it consumed. It\r\ncost $215.\r\n\r\nI have now to confess to a small extravagance. I contracted with a\r\ncarpenter to build an ornamental tower, fifty-five feet high, twenty\r\nfeet across at the base, and fifteen feet at the top, sheeted and\r\nshingled, with a series of small windows in spiral and a narrow stairway\r\nleading to a balcony that surrounded the tower on a level with the top\r\nof the tank. This tower cost $425; but it was not all extravagance,\r\nbecause a third of the expense would have been incurred in protecting\r\nthe engine and making the tank frost-proof.\r\n\r\nTo distribute the water, I had three lines of four-inch pipe leading\r\nfrom the tank's out-flow pipe. One of these went 250 feet to the house,\r\nwith one-inch branches for the gardens and lawn; another led east 375\r\nfeet, past the proposed sites of the cottage, the farm-house, the dairy,\r\nand other buildings in that direction; while the third, about 400 feet\r\nlong, led to the horse barn and the other projected buildings. From near\r\nthe end of this west pipe a 1-1/2-inch pipe was carried due north\r\nthrough the centre of the five-acre lot set apart for the hennery, and\r\ninto the fields beyond. This pipe was about 700 feet long. Altogether I\r\nused 1100 feet of four-inch, and about 2200 feet of smaller pipe, at a\r\ntotal cost of $803. All water pipes were placed 4-1/2 feet in the ground\r\nto be out of the reach of frost, and to this day they have received no\r\nfurther attention.\r\n\r\nThe trenches for the pipes were opened by a party of five Italians whom\r\na railroad friend found for me. These men boarded themselves, slept in\r\nthe barn, and did the work for seventy-five cents a rod, the job costing\r\nme $169.\r\n\r\nOpening the sewer trenches cost a little more, for they were as deep as\r\nthose for the water, and a little wider. Eight hundred feet of main\r\nsewer, a three-hundred-foot branch to the house, and short branches from\r\nbarns, pens, and farm-houses, made in all about fourteen hundred feet,\r\nwhich cost $83 to open. The sewer ended in the stable yard back of the\r\nhorse barn, in a ten-foot catch-basin near the manure pit. A few feet\r\nfrom this catch-basin was a second, and beyond this a third, all of the\r\nsame size, with drain-pipes connecting them about two feet below the\r\nground. These basins were closely covered at all times, and in winter\r\nthey were protected from frost by a thick layer of coarse manure. They\r\nwere placed near the site of the manure pit for convenience in cleaning,\r\nwhich had to be done every three months for the first one, once in six\r\nmonths for the second and rarely for the third; indeed, the water\r\nflowing from the third was always clear. This waste water was run\r\nthrough a drain-pipe diagonally across the northwest corner of the big\r\norchard to an open ditch in the north lane. Opening this drain of forty\r\nrods cost $30. Later I carried this closed drain to the creek, at an\r\nadditional expense of $67. The connecting of the water pipes and the\r\nlaying of the sewer was done by a local plumber for $50; the drain-pipe\r\nand sewer-pipe cost $112; and the three catch-basins, bricked up and\r\ncovered with two-inch plank, cost $63. The filling in of all these\r\ntrenches was done by my own men with teams and scrapers, and should not\r\nbe figured into this expense account. It must be borne in mind that\r\nwhile this elaborate water system was being installed, no buildings were\r\ncompleted and but few were even begun; the big house was not finished\r\nfor more than a year. The sites of all the buildings had been decided\r\non, and the farm-house and the cottage had been moved and remodelled, by\r\nthe middle of October, at which date the water plant was completed. An\r\nabundant supply of good water is essential to the comfort of man and\r\nbeast, and the money invested in securing it will pay a good interest in\r\nthe long run. My water plant cost me a lot of money, $2758; but it\r\nhasn't cost me $10 a year since it was finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWE TAKE POSSESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nMy barn was full of horses, but none of them was fit for farm work; so I\r\nengaged a veterinary surgeon to find three suitable teams. By the 25th\r\nof the month he had succeeded, and I inspected the animals and found\r\nthem satisfactory, though not so smooth and smart-looking as I had\r\npictured them. When I compared them, somewhat unfavorably, with the\r\nteams used for city trucks and delivery wagons, he retorted by saying:\r\n\"I did not know that you wanted to pay $1200 a pair for your horses.\r\nThese six horses will cost you $750, and they are worth it.\" They were a\r\nsturdy lot, young, well matched, not so large as to be unwieldy, but\r\nheavy enough for almost any work. The lightest was said to weigh 1375\r\npounds, and the heaviest not more than a hundred pounds more. Two of the\r\nteams were bay with a sprinkling of white feet, while the other pair was\r\nred roan, and, to my mind, the best looking.\r\n\r\nFour of these horses are still doing service on the farm, after more\r\nthan seven years. One of the bays died in the summer of '98, and one of\r\nthe roans broke his stifle during the following winter and had to be\r\nshot. The bereaved relicts of these two pairs have taken kindly to each\r\nother, and now walk soberly side by side in double harness. I sometimes\r\nthink, however, that I see a difference. The personal relation is not\r\njust as it was in the old union,--no bickerings or disagreements, but\r\nalso no jokes and no caresses. The soft nose doesn't seek its neighbor's\r\nneck, there is no resting of chin on friendly withers while half-closed\r\neyes see visions of cool shades, running brooks, and knee-deep clover;\r\nand the urgent whinney which called one to the other and told of\r\nloneliness when separated is no longer heard. It is pathetic to think\r\nthat these good creatures have been robbed of the one thing which gave\r\ncolor to their lives and lifted them above the dreary treadmill of duty\r\nfor duty's sake. The kindly friendship of each for his yoke-fellow is\r\nnot the old sympathetic companionship, which will come again only when\r\nthe cooling breezes, running brooks, and knee-deep pastures of the good\r\nhorse's heaven are reached.\r\n\r\nA horse is wonderfully sensitive for an animal of his size and strength.\r\nHe is timid by nature and his courage comes only from his confidence in\r\nman. His speed, strength, and endurance he will willingly give, and give\r\nit to the utmost, if the hand that guides is strong and gentle, and the\r\nvoice that controls is firm, confident, and friendly. Lack of courage in\r\nthe master takes from the horse his only chance of being brave; lack of\r\nsteadiness makes him indirect and futile; lack of kindness frightens him\r\ninto actions which are the result of terror at first, and which become\r\nvices only by mismanagement. By nature the horse is good. If he learns\r\nbad manners by associating with bad men, we ought to lay the blame where\r\nit belongs. A kind master will make a kind horse; and I have no respect\r\nfor a man who has had the privilege of training a horse from colt-hood\r\nand has failed to turn out a good one. Lack of good sense, or cruelty,\r\nis at the root of these failures. One can forgive lack of sense, for men\r\nare as God made them; but there is no forgiveness for the cruel: cooling\r\nshades and running brooks will not be prominent features in their\r\nultimate landscapes.\r\n\r\nFor harness and farm equipments, tools and machinery, I went to a\r\nreliable firm which made most and handled the rest of the things that\r\nmake a well-equipped farm. It is best to do much of one's business\r\nthrough one house, provided, of course, that the house is dependable.\r\nYou become a valued customer whom it is important to please, you receive\r\ndiscounts, rebates, and concessions that are worth something, and a\r\ncommunity of interest grows up that is worth much.\r\n\r\nMy first order to this house was for three heavy wagons with four-inch\r\ntires, three sets of heavy harness, two ploughs and a subsoiler, three\r\nharrows (disk, spring tooth, and flat), a steel land-roller, two\r\nwheelbarrows, an iron scraper, fly nets and other stable equipment,\r\nshovels, spades, hay forks, posthole tools, a hand seeder, a chest of\r\ntools, stock-pails, milk-pails and pans, axes, hatchets, saws of various\r\nkinds, a maul and wedges, six kegs of nails, and three lanterns. The\r\ntotal amount was $488; but as I received five per cent discount, I paid\r\nonly $464. The goods, except the wagons and harnesses, were to go by\r\nfreight to Exeter. Polly was to buy the necessary furnishings for the\r\nmen's house, the only stipulation I made being that the beds should be\r\ngood enough for me to sleep in. On the 25th of July she showed me a list\r\nof the things which she had purchased. It seemed interminable; but she\r\nassured me that she had bought nothing unnecessary, and that she had\r\nbeen very careful in all her purchases. As I knew that Polly was in the\r\nhabit of getting the worth of her money, I paid the bills without more\r\nado. The list footed up to $495.\r\n\r\nMost of the housekeeping things were to be delivered at the station in\r\nExeter; the rest were to go on the wagons. On the afternoon of the 30th\r\nthe wagons and harnesses were sent to the stable where the horses had\r\nbeen kept, and the articles to go in these wagons were loaded for an\r\nearly start the following morning. The distance from the station in the\r\ncity to the station at Exeter is thirty miles, but the stable is three\r\nmiles from the city station, the farm two and a half miles from Exeter\r\nstation, and the wagon road not so direct as the railroad. The trip to\r\nthe farm, therefore, could not be much less than forty miles, and would\r\nrequire the best part of two days. The three men whom I had engaged\r\nreported for duty, as also did Thompson's son, whom we are to know\r\nhereafter as Zeb.\r\n\r\nEarly on the last day of the month the men and teams were off, with\r\ncooked provisions for three days. They were to break the journey\r\ntwenty-five miles out, and expected to reach the farm the next\r\nafternoon. Polly and I wished to see them arrive, so we took the train\r\nat 1 P.M. August 1st, and reached Four Oaks at 2.30, taking with us Mrs.\r\nThompson, who was to cook for the men.\r\n\r\nBefore starting I had telephoned a local carpenter to meet me, and to\r\nbring a mason if possible. I found both men on the ground, and explained\r\nto them that there would be abundant work in their lines on the place\r\nfor the next year or two, that I was perfectly willing to pay a\r\nreasonable profit on each job, but that I did not propose to make them\r\nrich out of any single contract.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do, I told them, was to move the large farm-house to\r\nthe site already chosen, about two hundred yards distant, enlarge it,\r\nand put a first-class cellar under the whole. The principal change\r\nneeded in the house was an additional story on the ell, which would give\r\na chamber eighteen by twenty-six, with closets five feet deep, to be\r\nused as a sleeping room for the men. I intended to change the sitting\r\nroom, which ran across the main house, into a dining and reading room\r\ntwenty feet by twenty-five, and to improve the shape and convenience of\r\nthe kitchen by pantry and lavatory. There must also be a well-appointed\r\nbathroom on the upper floor, and set tubs in the kitchen. My men would\r\ndig the cellar, and the mason was to put in the foundation walls (twelve\r\ninches thick and two feet above ground), the cross or division walls,\r\nand the chimneys. He was also to put down a first-class cement floor\r\nover the whole cellar and approach. The house was to be heated by a\r\nhot-water system; and I afterward let this job to a city man, who put in\r\na satisfactory plant for $500.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly finished with the carpenter and the mason when we saw our\r\nwagons turning into the grounds. We left the contractors to their\r\nmeasurements, plans, and figures, while we hastened to turn the teams\r\nback, as they must go to the cottage on the north forty. The horses\r\nlooked a little done up by the heat and the unaccustomed journey, but\r\nThompson said: \"They're all right,--stood it first-rate.\"\r\n\r\nThe cottage and out-buildings furnished scanty accommodations for men\r\nand beasts, but they were all that we could provide. I told the men to\r\nmake themselves and the horses as comfortable as they could, then to\r\nmilk the cows and feed the hogs, and call it a day.\r\n\r\nWhile the others were unloading and getting things into shape, I called\r\nThompson off for a talk. \"Thompson,\" I said, \"you are to have the\r\noversight of the work here for the present, and I want you to have some\r\nidea of my general plan. This experiment at farming is to last years. We\r\nwon't look for results until we are ready to force them, but we are to\r\nget ready as soon as possible. In the meantime, we will have to do\r\nthings in an awkward fashion, and not always for immediate effect. We\r\nmust build the factory before we can turn out the finished product. The\r\ncows, for instance, must be cared for until we can dispose of them to\r\nadvantage. Half of them, I fancy, are 'robber cows,' not worth their\r\nkeep (if it costs anything to feed them), and we will certainly not\r\nwinter them. Keep your eye on the herd, and be able to tell me if any of\r\nthem will pay. Milk them carefully, and use what milk, cream, and butter\r\nyou can, but don't waste useful time carting milk to market--feed it to\r\nthe hogs rather. If a farmer or a milkman will call for it, sell what\r\nyou have to spare for what he will give, and have done with it quickly.\r\nYou are to manage the hogs on the same principle. Fatten those which are\r\nready for it, with anything you find on the place. We will get rid of\r\nthe whole bunch as soon as possible. You see, I must first clear the\r\nground before I can build my factory. Let the hens alone for the\r\npresent; you can eat them during the winter.\r\n\r\n\"Now, about the crops. The hay in barns and stacks is all right; the\r\nwheat is ready for threshing, but it can wait until the oats are also\r\nready; the corn is weedy, but it is too late to help it, and the\r\npotatoes are probably covered with bugs. I will send out to-morrow some\r\nParis green and a couple of blow-guns. There is not much real farm work\r\nto do just now, and you will have time for other things. The first and\r\nmost important thing is to dig a cellar to put your house over; your\r\ncomfort depends on that. Get the men and horses with plough and scraper\r\nout as early as you can to-morrow morning, and hustle. You have nothing\r\nto do but dig a big hole seven feet deep inside these lines. I count on\r\nyou to keep things moving, and I will be out the day after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe mason had finished his estimate, which was $560. After some\r\nexplanations, I concluded that it was a fair price, and agreed to it,\r\nprovided the work could be done promptly. The carpenter was not ready to\r\ngive me figures; he said, however, that he could get a man to move the\r\nhouse for $120, and that he would send me by mail that night an itemized\r\nestimate of costs, and also one from a plumber. This seemed like doing a\r\nlot of things in one afternoon, so Polly and I started for town content.\r\n\r\n\"Those people can't be very luxurious out there,\" said Polly, \"but they\r\ncan have good food and clean beds. They have all out-doors to breathe\r\nin, and I do not see what more one can ask on a fine August evening, do\r\nyou, Mr. Headman?\"\r\n\r\nI could think of a few things, but I did not mention them, for her first\r\nwords recalled some scenes of my early life on a backwoods farm: the log\r\ncabin, with hardly ten nails in it, the latch-string, the wide-mouthed\r\nstone-and-stick chimney, the spring-house with its deep crocks, the\r\nsmoke-house made of a hollow gum-tree log, the ladder to the loft where\r\nI slept, and where the snows would drift on the floor through the rifts\r\nin the split clapboards that roofed me over. I wondered if to-day was so\r\nmuch better than yesterday as conditions would warrant us in expecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE-AND-BUGGY MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 3 found me at Four Oaks in the early afternoon. A great hollow\r\nhad been dug for the cellar, and Thompson said that it would take but\r\none more full day to finish it. Piles of material gave evidence that the\r\nmason was alert, and the house-mover had already dropped his long\r\ntimbers, winch, and chains by the side of the farm-house.\r\n\r\nWhile I was discussing matters with Thompson, a smart trap turned into\r\nthe lot, and a well-set-up young man sprang out of the stylish runabout\r\nand said,--\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Williams, I hear you want more help on your farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can use another man or two to advantage, if they are good ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't want to brag, but I guess I am a good one, all right. I\r\nain't afraid of work, and there isn't much that I can't do on a farm.\r\nWhat wages do you pay?\"\r\n\r\nI told him my plan of an increasing wage scale, and he did not object.\r\n\"That includes horse keep, I suppose?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what you mean by 'horse keep.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, most of the men on farms around here own a horse and buggy, to use\r\nnights, Sundays, and holidays, and we expect the boss to keep the horse.\r\nThis is my rig. It is about the best in the township; cost me $280 for\r\nthe outfit.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, young man, this is another specimen of farm economics, and it\r\nis one of the worst in the lot. Let me do a small example in mental\r\narithmetic for you. The interest on $280 is $14; the yearly depreciation\r\nof your property, without accidents, is at least $40; horse-shoeing and\r\nrepairs, $20; loss of wages (for no man will keep your horse for less\r\nthan $4 a month), $48. In addition to this, you will be tempted to spend\r\nat least $5 a month more with a horse than without one; that is $60\r\nmore. You are throwing away $182 every year without adding $1 to your\r\nvalue as an employee, one ounce of dignity to your employment, or one\r\nfoot of gain in your social position, no matter from what point you view\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Taking it for granted that you receive $25 a month for every month of\r\nthe year (and this is admitting too much), you waste more than half on\r\nthat blessed rig, and you can make no provision for the future, for\r\nsickness, or for old age. No, I will not keep your horse, nor will I\r\nemploy any man whose scheme of life doesn't run further than the\r\nownership of a horse and buggy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a fellow must keep up with the procession; he must have some\r\nrecreation, and all the men around here have rigs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not around Four Oaks. Recreation is all right, but find it in ways less\r\nexpensive. Read, study, cultivate the best of your kind, plan for the\r\nfuture and save for it, and you will not lack for recreation. Sell your\r\nhorse and buggy for $200, if you cannot get more, put the money at\r\ninterest, save $200 out of your wages, and by the end of the year you\r\nwill be worth over $400 in hard cash and much more in self-respect. You\r\ncan easily add 1200 a year to your savings, without missing anything\r\nworth while; and it will not be long before you can buy a farm, marry a\r\nwife, and make an independent position. I will have no horse-and-buggy\r\nmen on my farm. It's up to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! I believe you may be right. It looks like a square deal, and\r\nI'll play it, if you'll give me time to sell the outfit.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, come when you can. I'll find the work.\"\r\n\r\nThat day being Saturday, I told Thompson that I would come out early\r\nMonday morning, bringing with me a rough map of the place as I had\r\nplanned it, and we would go over it with a chain and drive some\r\noutlining stakes. I then returned to Exeter, found the carpenter and the\r\nplumber, and accepted their estimates,--$630 and $325, respectively. The\r\nfarm-house moved, finished, furnished, and heated, but not painted or\r\npapered, would cost $2630. Painting, papering, window-shades, and odds\r\nand ends cost $275, making a total of $2905. It proved a good\r\ninvestment, for it was a comfortable and convenient home for the men and\r\nwomen who afterward occupied it. It has certainly been appreciated by\r\nits occupants, and few have left it without regret. We have always tried\r\nto make it an object lesson of cleanliness and cheerfulness, and I don't\r\nthink a man has lived in it for six months without being bettered. It\r\nseemed a good deal of money to put on an old farm-house for farm-hands,\r\nbut it proved one of the best investments at Four Oaks, for it kept the\r\nmen contented and cheerful workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWE PLAT THE FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday I was out by ten o'clock, armed with a surveyor's chain.\r\nThompson had provided a lot of stakes, and we ran the lines, more or\r\nless straight, in general accord with my sketch plan. We walked,\r\nmeasured, estimated, and drove stakes until noon. At one o'clock we were\r\nat it again, and by four I was fit to drop from fatigue. Farm work was\r\nnew to me, and I was soft as soft. I had, however, got the general lay\r\nof the land, and could, by the help of the plan, talk of its future\r\nsubdivisions by numerals,--an arrangement that afterward proved definite\r\nand convenient. We adjourned to the shade of the big black oak on the\r\nknoll, and discussed the work in hand.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot finish the cellar before to-morrow night,\" I said, \"because\r\nit grows slower as it grows deeper; but that will be doing well enough.\r\nI want you to start two teams ploughing Wednesday morning, and keep them\r\ngoing every day until the frost stops them. Let Sam take the plough, and\r\nhave young Thompson follow with the subsoiler. Have them stick to this\r\nas a regular diet until I call them off. They are to commence in the\r\nwheat stubble where lots six and seven will be. I am going to try\r\nalfalfa in that ground, though I am not at all sure that it will do\r\nwell, and the soil must be fitted as well as possible. After it has had\r\ndeep ploughing it is to be crossed with the disk harrow; then have it\r\nrolled, disk it again, and then use the flat harrow until it feels as\r\nnear like an ash heap as time will permit. We must get the seed in\r\nbefore September.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will need another team if you keep two ploughing and one on the\r\nharrow,\" said Thompson.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, and that means another $400, but you shall have it. We\r\nmust not stop the ploughs for anything. Numbers 10, 11, 14, 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n5, and much of the home lot, ought to be ploughed before snow flies.\r\nThat means about 160 acres,--80 odd days of steady work for the\r\nploughmen and horses. You will probably find it best to change teams\r\nfrom time to time. A little variety will make it easier for them. As\r\nsoon as 6 and 7 are finished, turn the ploughs into the 40 acres which\r\nmake lots 1 to 5. All that must be seeded to pasture grass, for it will\r\nbe our feeding-ground, and we'll be late with it if we don't look sharp.\r\n\r\n\"We must have more help, by the way. That horse-and-buggy man, Judson,\r\nis almost sure to come, and I will find another. Some of you will have\r\nto bunk in the hay for the present, for I am going to send out a woman\r\nto help your wife. Six men can do a lot of work, but there is a\r\ntremendous lot of work to do. We must fit the ground and plant at least\r\nthree thousand apple trees before the end of November, and we ought to\r\nfence this whole plantation. Speaking of fences reminds me that I must\r\norder the cedar posts. Have you any idea how many posts it will take to\r\nfence this farm as we have platted it? I suppose not. Well, I can tell\r\nyou. Twenty-two hundred and fifty at one rod apart, or 1850 at twenty\r\nfeet apart. These posts must be six feet above and three feet below\r\nground. They will cost eighteen cents each. That item will be $333, for\r\nthere are seven miles of fence, including the line fence between me and\r\nmy north neighbor. I am going to build that fence myself, and then I\r\nshall know whose fault it is if his stock breaks through. Of course some\r\nof the old posts are good, but I don't believe one in twenty is long\r\nenough for my purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you buy cedar posts for, when you have enough better ones on\r\nthe place?\" asked Thompson.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, down in the wood yonder there's enough dead white oak, standing\r\nor on the ground, to make three thousand, nine-foot posts, and one\r\nseasoned white oak will outlast two cedars, and it is twice as strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's good! How much will it cost to get them out?\"\r\n\r\n\"About five cents apiece. A couple of smart fellows can make good wages\r\nat that price.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. We will save thirteen cents each. They will cost $93 instead of\r\n$333. I don't know everything yet, do I, Thompson?\"\r\n\r\n\"You learn easy, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your eyes and ears open, and if you find any one who can do this\r\njob, let him have it, for we are going to be too busy with other things\r\nat present. It's time for me to be off. I cannot be out again till\r\nThursday, for I must find a man, a woman, and a team of horses and all\r\nthat goes with them. I'll see you on the 8th at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nI was dead tired when I reached home; but there wasn't a grain of\r\ndepression in my fatigue,--rather a sense of elation. I felt that for\r\nthe first time in thirty years real things were doing and I was having a\r\nhand in them. The fatigue was the same old tire that used to come after\r\na hard day on my father's farm, and the sense was so suggestive of youth\r\nthat I could not help feeling younger. I have never gotten away from the\r\nfaith that the real seed of life lies hidden in the soil; that the man\r\nwho gives it a chance to germinate is a benefactor, and that things done\r\nin connection with land are about the only real things. I have grown\r\nyounger, stronger, happier, with each year of personal contact with the\r\nsoil. I am thankful for seven years of it, and look forward to twice\r\nseven more. I have lost the softness which nearly wilted me that 5th day\r\nof August, and with the softness has gone twenty or thirty pounds of\r\nuseless flesh. I am hard, active, and strong for a man of sixty, and I\r\ncan do a fair day's work. To tell the truth, I prefer the moderate work\r\nthat falls to the lot of the Headman, rather than the more strenuous\r\nlife of the husbandman; but I find an infinite deal to thank the farm\r\nfor in health and physical comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHOUSE-CLEANING\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I telephoned the veterinary surgeon that I wanted another\r\nteam. He replied that he thought he knew of one that would suit, and\r\nthat he would let me know the next day. I also telephoned two \"want\r\nads.\" to a morning paper, one for an experienced farm-hand, the other\r\nfor a woman to do general housework in the country. Polly was to\r\ninterview the women who applied, and I was to look after the men. That\r\nnight I slept like a hired man.\r\n\r\nOut of the dozen who applied the next day I accepted a Swede by the name\r\nof Anderson. He was about thirty, tall, thin, and nervous. He did not\r\nfit my idea of a stockman, but he looked like a worker, and as I could\r\nfurnish the work we soon came to terms.\r\n\r\nA few words more about Anderson. He proved a worker indeed. He had an\r\ninsatiable appetite for work, and never knew when to quit. He was not\r\npopular at the farm, for he was too eager in the morning to start and\r\ntoo loath in the evening to stop. His unbridled passion for work was a\r\nthing to be deplored, as it kept him thin and nervous. I tried to\r\nmoderate this propensity, but with no result. Anderson could not be\r\ntrusted with horses, or, indeed, with animals of any kind, for he made\r\nthem as nervous as himself; but in all other kinds of work he was the\r\nbest man ever at Four Oaks. He worked for me nearly three years, and\r\nthen suddenly gave out from a pain in his left chest and shortness of\r\nbreath. I called a physician for poor Anderson, and the diagnosis was\r\ndilatation of the heart from over-exercise.\r\n\r\n\"A rare disease among farm-hands, Dr. Williams,\" said Dr. High, but my\r\nconscience did not fully forgive me. I asked Anderson to stay at the\r\nfarm and see what could be done by rest and care. He declined this, as\r\nwell as my offer to send him to a hospital. He expressed the liveliest\r\ngratitude for kindnesses received and others offered, but he said he\r\nmust be independent and free. He had nearly $1200 in a savings bank in\r\nthe city, and he proposed to use it, or such portion of it as was\r\nnecessary. I saw him two months later. He was better, but not able to\r\nwork. Hearing nothing from him for three years, a year ago I called at\r\nthe bank where I knew he had kept his savings. They had sent sums of\r\nmoney to him, once to Rio Janeiro and once to Cape Town. For two years\r\nhe had not been heard from. Whether he is living or dead I do not know.\r\nI only know that a valuable man and a unique farm-hand has disappeared.\r\nI never think of Anderson without wishing I had been more severe with\r\nhim,--more persistent in my efforts to wean him from his real passion.\r\nPeace to his ashes, if he be ashes.\r\n\r\nThat same day I telephoned the Agricultural Implement Company to send me\r\nanother wagon, with harness and equipment for the team. The veterinary\r\nsurgeon reported that he had a span of mares for me to look at, but I\r\nwas too much engaged that day to inspect the team, and promised to do so\r\non the next.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, Polly said she had found nothing in the way of a\r\ngeneral housework girl for the country. She had seen nine women who\r\nwished to do all other kinds of work, but none to fit her wants.\r\n\r\n\"What do they come for if they don't want the place we described? Do\r\nthey expect we are to change our plans of life to suit their personal\r\nnotions?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard to say what they came for or what they want. Their ways are\r\npast finding out. We will put in another 'ad.' and perhaps have better\r\nluck.\"\r\n\r\nWednesday, the 7th, I went to see the new team. I found a pair of\r\nflea-bitten gray Flemish mares, weighing about twenty-eight hundred\r\npounds. They were four years old, short of leg and long of body, and\r\nlooked fit. The surgeon passed them sound, and said he considered them\r\nwell worth the price asked,--$300. I was pleased with the team, and\r\nremembered a remark I had heard as a boy from an itinerant Methodist\r\nminister at a time when the itinerant minister was supposed to know all\r\nthere was to know about horse-flesh. This was his remark: \"There was\r\nnever a flea-bitten mare that was a poor horse.\" In spite of its\r\nambiguity, the saying made an impression from which I never recovered. I\r\nalways expected great things from flea-bitten grays.\r\n\r\nThe team, wagon, harness, etc., added $395 to the debit account against\r\nthe farm. Polly secured her girl,--a green German who had not been long\r\nenough in America to despise the country.\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't know a thing about our ways,\" said Polly, \"but Mrs.\r\nThompson can train her as she likes. If you can spend time enough with\r\ngreen girls, they are apt to grow to your liking.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday I saw Anderson and the new team safely started for the farm.\r\nThen Polly, the new girl, and I took train for the most interesting spot\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nSoon after we arrived I lost sight of Polly, who seemed to have business\r\nof her own. I found the mason and his men at work on the cellar wall,\r\nwhich was almost to the top of the ground. The house was on wheels, and\r\nhad made most of its journey. The house mover was in a rage because he\r\nhad to put the house on a hole instead of on solid ground, as he had\r\nexpected. \"I have sent for every stick of timber and every cobbling\r\nblock I own, to get this house over that hole; there's no money in this\r\njob for me; you ought to have dug the cellar after the house was\r\nplaced,\" said he.\r\n\r\nI made friends with him by agreeing to pay $30 more for the job. The\r\nhouse was safely placed, and by Saturday night the foundation walls were\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nSam and Zeb had made a good beginning on the ploughing, the teams were\r\ndoing well for green ones, and the men seemed to understand what good\r\nploughing meant. Thompson and Johnson had spent parts of two days in the\r\npotato patches in deadly conflict with the bugs.\r\n\r\n\"We've done for most of them this time,\" said Thompson, \"but we'll have\r\nto go over the ground again by Monday.\"\r\n\r\nThe next piece of work was to clear the north forty (lots 1 to 5) of all\r\nfences, stumps, stones, and rubbish, and all buildings except the\r\ncottage. The barn was to be torn down, and the horses were to be\r\ntemporarily stabled in the old barn on the home lot. Useful timbers and\r\nlumber were to be snugly piled, the manure around the barns was to be\r\nspread under the old apple trees, which were in lot No. 1, and\r\neverything not useful was to be burned. \"Make a clean sweep, and leave\r\nit as bare as your hand,\" I told Thompson. \"It must be ready for the\r\nplough as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nJudson, the man with the buggy, reported at noon. He came with bag and\r\nbaggage, but not with buggy, and said that he came to stay.\r\n\r\n\"Thompson,\" said I, \"you are to put Judson in charge of the roan team to\r\nfollow the boys when they are far enough ahead of him. In the meantime\r\nhe and the team will be with you and Johnson in this house-cleaning. By\r\nto-morrow night Anderson and the new team will get in, and they, too,\r\nwill help on this job. I want you to take personal charge of the gray\r\nteam,--neither Johnson nor Anderson is the right sort to handle horses.\r\nThe new team will do the trucking about and the regular farm work, while\r\nthe other three are kept steadily at the ploughs and harrows.\"\r\n\r\nThe cleaning of the north forty proved a long job. Four men and two\r\nteams worked hard for ten days, and then it was not finished. By that\r\ntime the ploughmen had finished 6 and 7, and were ready to begin on No.\r\n1. Judson, with the roans and harrows, was sent to the twenty acres of\r\nploughed ground, and Zeb and his team were put at the cleaning for three\r\ndays, while Sam ploughed the six acres of old orchard with a\r\n_shallow-set_ plough. The feeding roots of these trees would have been\r\nseriously injured if we had followed the deep ploughing practised in the\r\nopen. By August 24 about two hundred loads of manure from the\r\nbarn-yards, the accumulation of years, had been spread under the apple\r\ntrees, and I felt sure it was well bestowed. Manuring, turning the sod,\r\npruning, and spraying, ought to give a good crop of fruit next year.\r\n\r\nWe had several days of rain during this time, which interfered somewhat\r\nwith the work, but the rains were gratefully received. I spent much of\r\nmy time at Four Oaks, often going every day, and never let more than two\r\ndays pass without spending some hours on the farm. To many of my friends\r\nthis seemed a waste of time. They said, \"Williams is carrying this fad\r\ntoo far,--spending too much time on it.\"\r\n\r\nPolly did not agree with them, neither did I. Time is precious only as\r\nwe make it so. To do the wholesome, satisfying thing, without direct or\r\nindirect injury to others, is the privilege of every man. To the charge\r\nof neglecting my profession I pleaded not guilty, for my profession had\r\ndismissed me without so much as saying \"By your leave.\" I was obliged to\r\nchange my mode of life, and I chose to be a producer rather than a\r\nconsumer of things produced by others. I was conserving my health,\r\npleasing my wife, and at the same time gratifying a desire which had\r\nlong possessed me. I have neither apology to make nor regret to record;\r\nfor as individuals and as a family we have lived healthier, happier,\r\nmore wholesome, and more natural lives on the farm than we ever did in\r\nthe city, and that is saying much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFENCED IN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, when I reached the station at Exeter, I found Thompson and\r\nthe gray team just starting for the farm with the second load of wire\r\nfencing. I had ordered fifty-six rolls of Page's woven wire fence, forty\r\nrods in each roll. This fence cost me seventy cents a rod, $224 a mile,\r\nor $1568 for the seven miles. Add to this $37 for freight, and the total\r\namounted to $1605 for the wire to fence my land. I got this facer as I\r\nclimbed to the seat beside Thompson. I did not blink, however, for I had\r\nresolved in the beginning to take no account of details until the 31st\r\nday of December, and to spend as much on the farm in that time as I\r\ncould without being wasteful. I did not care much what others thought. I\r\nfelt that at my age time was precious, and that things must be rushed as\r\nrapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nI was glad of this slow ride with Thompson, for it gave me an\r\nopportunity to study him. I wondered then and afterward why a man of his\r\ngeneral intelligence, industry, and special knowledge of the details of\r\nfarming, should fail of success when working for himself. He knew ten\r\ntimes as much about the business as I did, and yet he had not succeeded\r\nin an independent position. Some quality, like broadness of mind or\r\ndirectness of purpose, was lacking, which made him incapable of carrying\r\nout a plan, no matter how well conceived. He was like Hooker at\r\nChancellorsville, whose plan of campaign was perfect, whose orders were\r\ncarried out with exactness, whose army fell into line as he wished, and\r\nwhose enemy did the obvious thing, yet who failed terribly because the\r\nresponsibility of the ultimate was greater than he could bear. As second\r\nin command, or as corps leader, he was superb; in independent command he\r\nwas a disastrous failure.\r\n\r\nThompson, then, was a Joe Hooker on a reduced plane,--good only to\r\nexecute another man's plans. Thompson might have rebutted this by saying\r\nthat I too might prove a disastrous failure; that as yet I had shown\r\nonly ability to spend,--perhaps not always wisely. Such rebuttal would\r\nhave had weight seven years ago, but it would not be accepted to-day,\r\nfor I have made my campaign and won my battle. The record of the past\r\nseven years shows that I can plan and also execute.\r\n\r\nThompson told me that he had found two woodsmen (by scouting around on\r\nSunday) who were glad to take the job of cutting the white-oak posts at\r\nfive cents each, and that they were even then at work; and that Nos. 6\r\nand 7 would be fitted for alfalfa by the end of the week. He added that\r\nthe seed ought to be sown as soon thereafter as possible and that a\r\nliberal dressing of commercial fertilizer should be sown before the seed\r\nwas harrowed in.\r\n\r\n\"I have ordered five tons of fertilizer,\" I said, \"and it ought to be\r\nhere this week. Sow four bags to the acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four bags,--eight hundred pounds; that's pretty expensive. Costs, I\r\nsuppose, $35 to $40 a ton.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; $24.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Friend at court; factory price; $120 for five tons; $5 freight, making\r\nin all $125. We must use at least eight hundred pounds this fall and\r\nfive hundred in the spring. Alfalfa is an experiment, and we must give\r\nit a show.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never saw anything done with alfalfa in this region, but they never\r\ntook no pains with it,\" said Thompson.\r\n\r\n\"I hope it will grow for us, for it is great forage if properly managed.\r\nThe seed will be out this week, and you had best sow it on Monday, the\r\n2d.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to seed the north forty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Timothy, red top, and blue grass; heavy seeding, to get rid of the\r\nweeds. These lots will all be used as stock lots. Small ones, you think,\r\nbut we will depend almost entirely upon soiling. I hope to keep a fair\r\nsod on these lots, and they will be large enough to give the animals\r\nexercise and keep them healthy. I hope the carpenter is pushing things\r\non the house. I want to get you into better quarters as soon as\r\npossible, and I want the cottage moved out of the way before we seed the\r\nlot.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're pushing things all right, I guess; that man Nelson is a\r\nhustler.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the farm I found Johnson and Anderson tearing down the\r\nold fence that was our eastern boundary. None of the posts were long\r\nenough for my purpose, so all were consigned to the woodpile.\r\n\r\nMy neighbor on the north owned just as much land as I did. He inherited\r\nit and a moderate bank account from his father, who in turn had it from\r\nhis. The farm was well kept and productive. The house and barns were\r\nsubstantial and in good repair. The owner did general farming, raised\r\nwheat, corn, and oats to sell, milked twenty cows and sent the milk to\r\nthe creamery, sold one or two cows and a dozen calves each year, and\r\nfattened twenty or thirty pigs. He was pretty certain to add a few\r\nhundred dollars to his bank account at the end of each season. He kept\r\none man all the time and two in summer. He was a bachelor of\r\ntwenty-eight, well liked and good to look upon: five feet ten inches in\r\nheight, broad of shoulder, deep of chest, and a very Hercules in\r\nstrength. His face was handsome, square-jawed and strong. He was\r\ngood-natured, but easily roused, and when angry was as fierce as fire.\r\nHe had the reputation of being the hardest fighter in the country. His\r\nname was William Jackson, so he was called Bill. I had met Jackson\r\noften, and we had taken kindly to each other. I admired his frank manner\r\nand sturdy physique, and he looked upon me as a good-natured tenderfoot,\r\nwho might be companionable, and who would certainly stir up things in\r\nthe neighborhood. I went in search of him that afternoon to discuss the\r\nline fence, a full mile of which divided our lands.\r\n\r\n\"I want to put a fence along our line which nothing can get over or\r\nunder,\" I said. \"I am willing to bear the expense of the new fence if\r\nyou will take away the old one and plough eight furrows,--four on your\r\nland and four on mine,--to be seeded to grass before the wires are\r\nstretched. We ought to get rid of the weeds and brush.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a liberal proposition, Dr. Williams, and of course I accept,\"\r\nsaid Jackson; \"but I ought to do more. I'll tell you what I'll do. You\r\nare planning to put a ring fence around your land,--three miles in all.\r\nI'll plough the whole business and fit it for the seed. I'll take one of\r\nmy men, four horses, and a grub plough, and do it whenever you are\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nThis settled the fence matter between Jackson and me. The men who cut\r\nthe posts took the job of setting them, stretching the wire, and hanging\r\nthe gates, for $400. This included the staples and also the stretching\r\nof three strands of barbed wire above the woven wire; two at six-inch\r\nintervals on the outside, and one inside, level with the top of the\r\npost. Thus my ring fence was six feet high and hard to climb. I have a\r\nserious dislike for trespass, from either man or beast, and my boundary\r\nfence was made to discourage trespassers. I like to have those who enter\r\nmy property do so by the ways provided, for \"whoso climbeth up any other\r\nway, the same is a thief and a robber.\"\r\n\r\nThe ring fence was finished by the middle of October. The interior\r\nfences were built by my own men during soft weather in winter and\r\nspring; and, as I had already paid for the wire and posts, nothing more\r\nshould be charged to the fence account. In round numbers these seven\r\nmiles of excellent fence cost me $2100. A lot of money! But the fence is\r\nthere to-day as serviceable as when it was set, and it will stand for\r\ntwice seven years more. One hundred dollars a year is not a great price\r\nto pay for the security and seclusion which a good fence furnishes.\r\nThere was no need of putting up so much interior fence. I would save a\r\nmile or two if I had it to do again; however, I do not dislike my\r\nstraight lanes and tightly fenced fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING LINE\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Four Oaks that day I had a long conversation with Nelson,\r\nthe carpenter. I had taken his measure, by inquiry and observation, and\r\nwas willing to put work into his hands as fast as he could attend to it.\r\nThe first thing was to put him in possession of my plan of a building\r\nline.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred feet south of the north line of the home lot a street or\r\nlane was to run due west from the gate on the main road. This was to be\r\nthe teaming or business entrance to the farm. Commencing three hundred\r\nfeet from the east end of this drive, the structures were to be as\r\nfollows: On the south side, first a cold-storage house, then the\r\nfarm-house, the cottage, the well, and finally the carriage barn for the\r\nbig house. On the north side of the line, opposite the ice-house, the\r\ndairy-house; then a square with a small power-house for its centre, a\r\nwoodhouse, a horse barn for the farm horses, a granary and a forage barn\r\nfor its four corners. Beyond this square to the west was the fruit-house\r\nand the tool-house--the latter large enough to house all the farm\r\nmachinery we should ever need. I have a horror of the economy that\r\nleaves good tools to sky and clouds without protection. This sketch\r\nwould not be worked out for a long time, as few of the buildings were\r\nneeded at once. It was made for the sake of having a general design to\r\nbe carried out when required; and the water and sewer system had been\r\nbuilt with reference to it.\r\n\r\nI told Nelson that a barn to shelter the horses was the first thing to\r\nbuild, after the house for the men, and that I saw no reason why two or\r\neven three buildings should not be in process of construction at the\r\nsame time. He said there would be no difficulty in managing that if he\r\ncould get the men and I could get the money. I promised to do my part,\r\nand we went into details.\r\n\r\nI wanted a horse barn for ten horses, with shed room for eight wagons in\r\nfront and a small stable yard in the rear; also a sunken manure vat, ten\r\nfeet by twenty, with cement walls and floor, the vat to be four feet\r\ndeep, two feet in the ground and two feet above it. A vat like this has\r\nbeen built near each stable where stock is kept, and I find them\r\nperfectly satisfactory. They save the liquid manure, and thus add fifty\r\nper cent to the value of the whole. Open sheds protect from sun and\r\nrain, and they are emptied as often as is necessary, regardless of\r\nseason, for I believe that the fields can care for manure better than a\r\ncompost heap.\r\n\r\nI also told Nelson to make plans and estimates for a large forage barn,\r\n75 by 150 feet, 25 feet from floor to rafter plate, with a driving floor\r\nthrough the length of it and mows on either side. A granary, with a\r\ncapacity of twenty thousand bushels, a large woodhouse, and a small\r\nhouse in the centre of this group where the fifteen horse-power engine\r\ncould be installed, completed my commissions for that day.\r\n\r\nPlans for these structures were submitted in due time, and the work was\r\npushed forward as rapidly as possible. The horse barn made a comfortable\r\nhome for ten horses, if we should need so many, with food and water\r\nclose at hand and every convenience for the care of the animals and\r\ntheir harness. The forage barn was not expensive,--it was simply to\r\nshelter a large quantity of forage to be drawn upon when needed. The\r\nwoodhouse was also inexpensive, though large. Wood was to be the\r\nprincipal fuel at Four Oaks, since it would cost nothing, and there must\r\nbe ample shelter for a large amount. The granary would have to be built\r\nwell and substantially, but it was not large. The power-house also was a\r\nsmall affair. The whole cost of these five buildings was $8550. The\r\nitemized amount is, horse barn, $2000, forage barn, $3400, granary,\r\n$2200, woodhouse, $400, power-house, $550.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCARPENTERS QUIT WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday, August 30, I was obliged to go to a western city on business\r\nthat would keep me from four to ten days. I turned my face away from the\r\nfarm with regret. I could hardly realize that I had spent but one month\r\nin my new life, the old interests had slipped so far behind. I was\r\nreluctant to lose sight, even for a week, of the intensely interesting\r\nthings that were doing at Four Oaks. Polly said she would go to Four\r\nOaks every day, and keep so watchful an eye on the farm that it could\r\nnot possibly get away.\r\n\r\n\"You're getting a little bit maudlin about that farm, Mr. Headman, and\r\nit will do you good to get away for a few days. There are _some other_\r\nthings in life, though I admit they are few, and we are not to forget\r\nthem. I am up to my ears in plans for the house and the home lot; but I\r\ncan't quite see what you find so interesting in tearing down old barns\r\nand fences and turning over old sods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every heart knoweth its own sorrow, Polly, and I have my troubles.\"\r\n\r\nFriday evening, September 6, I returned from the west. My first\r\ngreeting was,--\r\n\r\n\"How's the farm, Polly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's there, or was yesterday; I think you'll find things running\r\nsmoothly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they sowed the alfalfa and cut the oats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finished the farm-house?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not quite, but the painters are there, and Nelson has commenced\r\nwork on two other buildings.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time can I breakfast? I must catch the 8.10 train, and spend a\r\nlong day where things are doing.\"\r\n\r\nThings were humming at Four Oaks when I arrived. Ten carpenters besides\r\nNelson and his son were pounding, sawing, and making confusion in all\r\nsorts of ways peculiar to their kind. The ploughmen were busy. Thompson\r\nand the other two men were shocking oats. I spent the day roaming around\r\nthe place, watching the work and building castles. I went to the alfalfa\r\nfield to see if the seed had sprouted. Disappointed in this, I wandered\r\ndown to the brook and planned some abridgment of its meanderings. It\r\ncould be straightened and kept within bounds without great expense if\r\nthe work were done in a dry season. Polly had asked for a winding brook\r\nwith a fringe of willows and dogwood, but I would not make this\r\nconcession to her esthetic taste. This farm land must be useful to the\r\nsacrifice of everything else. A winding brook would be all right on the\r\nhome lot, if it could be found, but not on the farm. A straight ditch\r\nfor drainage was all that I would permit, and I begrudged even that. No\r\nwaste land in the cultivated fields, was my motto. I had threshed this\r\nout with Polly and she had yielded, after stipulating that I must keep\r\nmy hands off the home forty.\r\n\r\nOver in the woods I found two men at work splitting fence posts. They\r\nseemed expert, and I asked them how many they could make in a day.\r\n\r\n\"From 90 to 125, according to the timber. But we must work hard to make\r\ngood wages.\"\r\n\r\n\"That applies to other things besides post-splitting, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nCloser inspection of the wood lot gratified me exceedingly. Little had\r\nbeen done for it except by Nature, but she had worked with so prodigal a\r\nhand that it showed all kinds of possibilities, both for beauty and for\r\nutility. Before leaving the place, I had a little talk with Nelson.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is going on nicely,\" he said. \"I have ten carpenters, and\r\nthey are a busy lot. If I can only hold them on to the job, things will\r\ngo well.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? Can't you hold them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, but there is a hoisters' strike on in the city, and the\r\ncarpenters threaten to go out in sympathy. I hope it won't reach us,\r\nbut I'm afraid it will.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do if the men go out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the best I can. I can get two non-union men that I know of. They\r\nwould like to be on this job now, but these men won't permit it. My son\r\nis a full hand, so there will be four of us; but it will be slow work.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, Nelson, I can't have this work slack up. We haven't time.\r\nCold weather will be on before we know it. I'm going to take this bull\r\nby the horns. I'll advertise for carpenters in the Sunday papers. Some\r\nof those who apply will be non-union men, and I'll hold them over for a\r\nfew days until we see how the cat jumps. If it comes to the worst, we\r\ncan get some men to take the place of Thompson and Sam, who are\r\ncarpenters, and set them at the tools. I will not let this work stop,\r\nstrike or no strike.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you put non-union men on you will have to feed and sleep them on the\r\nplace. The union will make it hot for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will take all kinds of care of every man who gives me honest work,\r\nyou may be sure.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to town I sent this \"ad.\" to two papers: \"Wanted: Ten\r\ngood carpenters to go to the country.\" The Sunday papers gave a lurid\r\naccount of the sentiment of the Carpenters' Union and its sympathetic\r\nattitude toward the striking hoisters. The forecast was that there would\r\nnot be a nail driven if the strike were not settled by Tuesday night.\r\nIt seemed that I had not moved a day too soon. On Monday thirty-seven\r\ncarpenters applied at my office. Most of them had union tickets and were\r\nnot considered. Thirteen, however, were not of the union, and they were\r\ninvestigated. I hired seven on these conditions: wages to begin the next\r\nday, Tuesday, and to continue through the week, work or no work. If the\r\nstrike was ordered, I would take the men to the country and give them\r\nsteady work until my jobs were finished. They agreed to these\r\nconditions, and were requested to report at my office on Wednesday\r\nmorning to receive two days' pay, and perhaps to be set to work.\r\n\r\nI did not go to the farm until Tuesday afternoon. There was no change in\r\nthe strike, and no reason to expect one. The noon papers said that the\r\nCarpenters' Union would declare a sympathetic strike to be on from\r\nWednesday noon.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Four Oaks I called Nelson aside and told him how the land\r\nlay and what I had done.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to call the men together,\" said I, \"and let me talk to them.\r\nI must know just how we stand and how they feel.\"\r\n\r\nNelson called the men, and I read the reports from two papers on the\r\nimpending strike order.\r\n\r\n\"Now, men,\" said I, \"we must look this matter in the face in a\r\nbusinesslike fashion. You have done good work here; your boss is\r\nsatisfied, and so am I. It would suit us down to the ground if you\r\nwould continue on until all these jobs are finished. We can give you a\r\nlot of work for the best part of the year. You are sure of work and sure\r\nof pay if you stay with us. That is all I have to say until you have\r\ndecided for yourselves what you will do if the strike is ordered.\"\r\n\r\nI left the men for a short time, while they talked things over. It did\r\nnot take them long to decide.\r\n\r\n\"We must stand by the union,\" said the spokesman, \"but we'll be damned\r\nsorry to quit this job. You see, sir, we can't do any other way. We have\r\nto be in the union to get work, and we have to do as the union says or\r\nwe will be kicked out. It is hard, sir, not to do a hit of a hammer for\r\nweeks or months with a family on one's hands and winter coming; but what\r\ncan a man do? We don't see our way clear in this matter, but we must do\r\nas the union says.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see how you are fixed,\" said I, \"and I am mighty sorry for you. I am\r\nnot going to rail against unions, for they may have done some good; but\r\nthey work a serious wrong to the man with a family, for he cannot follow\r\nthem without bringing hardships upon his dependent ones. It is not fair\r\nto yoke him up with a single man who has no natural claims to satisfy,\r\nno mouth to feed except his own; but I will talk business.\r\n\r\n\"You will be ordered out to-morrow or next day, and you say you will\r\nobey the order. You have an undoubted right to do so. A man is not a\r\nslave, to be made to work against his will; but, on the other hand, is\r\nhe not a slave if he is forced to quit against his will? Freedom of\r\naction in personal matters is a right which wise men have fought for and\r\nfor which wise men will always fight. Do you find it in the union? What\r\nshall I do when you quit work? How long are you going to stay out? What\r\nwill become of my interests while you are following the lead of your\r\nbell-wethers? Shall my work stop because you have been called out for a\r\nholiday? Shall the weeds grow over these walls and my lumber rot while\r\nyou sit idly by? Not by a long sight! You have a perfect right to quit\r\nwork, and I have a perfect right to continue.\r\n\r\n\"The rights which we claim for ourselves we must grant to others. One\r\nman certainly has as defensible a right to work as another man has to be\r\nidle. In the legitimate exercise of personal freedom there is no effort\r\nat coercion, and in this case there shall be none. If you choose to\r\nquit, you will do so without let or hindrance from me; but if you quit,\r\nothers will take your places without let or hindrance from you. You will\r\nbe paid in full to-night. When you leave, you must take your tools with\r\nyou, that there may be no excuse for coming back. When you leave the\r\nplace, the incident will be closed so far as you and I are concerned,\r\nand it will not be opened unless I find some of you trying to interfere\r\nwith the men I shall engage to take your places. I think you make a\r\nserious mistake in following blind leaders who are doing you material\r\ninjury, for sentimental reasons; but you must decide this for\r\nyourselves. If, after sober thought, any of you feel disposed to return,\r\nyou can get a job if there is a vacancy; but no man who works for me\r\nduring this strike will be displaced by a striker. You may put that in\r\nyour pipes and smoke it. Nelson will pay you off to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe strike was ordered for Wednesday. On the morning of that day the\r\nseven carpenters whom I had engaged arrived at my office ready for work.\r\nI took them to the station and started for Four Oaks. At a station five\r\nmiles from Exeter we quitted the train, hired two carriages, and were\r\ndriven to the farm without passing through the village.\r\n\r\nWe arrived without incident, the men had their dinners, and at one\r\no'clock the hammers and saws were busy again. We had lost but one half\r\nday. The two non-union men whom Nelson had spoken of were also at work,\r\nand three days later the spokesman of the strikers threw up his card and\r\njoined our force. We had no serious trouble. It was thought wise to keep\r\nthe new men on the place until the excitement had passed, and we had to\r\nwarn some of the old ones off two or three times, but nothing\r\ndisagreeable happened, and from that day to this Four Oaks has remained\r\nnon-unionized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPLANNING FOR THE TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of September 17th a small frost fell,--just enough to curl\r\nthe leaves of the corn and show that it was time for it to be laid by.\r\nThompson, Johnson, Anderson, and the two men from the woods, who were\r\ndiverted from their post-splitting for the time being, went gayly to the\r\ncorn fields and attacked the standing grain in the old-fashioned way.\r\nThis was not economical; but I had no corn reaper, and there was none to\r\nhire, for the frost had struck us all at the same time. The five men\r\nwere kept busy until the two patches--about forty-three acres--were in\r\nshock. This brought us to the 24th. In the meantime the men and women\r\nmoved from the cottage to the more commodious farm-house. Polly had\r\nfound excuses for spending $100 more on the furnishings of this\r\nhouse,--two beds and a lot of other things. Sunday gave the people a\r\nchance to arrange their affairs; and they certainly appreciated their\r\nimproved surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was moved to its place on the line, and the last of the\r\nseeding on the north forty was done. Ten tons of fertilizer were sown on\r\nthis forty-acre tract (at a cost of $250), and it was then left to\r\nitself, not to be trampled over by man or beast, except for the\r\nstretching of fences or for work around some necessary buildings, until\r\nthe middle of the following May.\r\n\r\nWe did not sow any wheat that year,--there was too much else to be done\r\nof more importance. There is not much money in wheat-farming unless it\r\nbe done on a large scale, and I had no wish to raise more than I could\r\nfeed to advantage. Wheat was to be a change food for my fowls; but just\r\nthen I had no fowls to feed, and there were more than two hundred\r\nbushels in stacks ready for the threshers, which I could hold for future\r\nhens.\r\n\r\nThe ploughmen were now directed to commence deep ploughing on No.\r\n14,--the forty acres set apart for the commercial orchard. This tract of\r\nland lay well for the purpose. Its surface was nearly smooth, with a\r\ndescent to the west and southwest that gave natural drainage. I have\r\nbeen informed that an orchard would do better if the slope were to the\r\nnortheast. That may be true, but mine has done well enough thus far,\r\nand, what is more to the point, I had no land with a northeast slope.\r\nThe surface soil was thin and somewhat impoverished, but the subsoil was\r\na friable clay in which almost anything would grow if it was properly\r\nworked and fed. It was my desire to make this square block of forty\r\nacres into a first-class apple orchard for profit. Seven years from\r\nplanting is almost too soon to decide how well I have succeeded, but the\r\nresults attained and the promises for the future lead me to believe that\r\nthere will be no failure in my plan.\r\n\r\nThe three essentials for beginning such an orchard are: prepare the land\r\nproperly, get good stock (healthy and true to name), and plant it well.\r\nI could do no more this year than to plough deep, smooth the surface,\r\nand plant as well as I knew how. Increased fertility must come from\r\nfuture cultivation and top dressing. The thing most prominent in my plan\r\nwas to get good trees well placed in the ground before cold weather set\r\nin. At my time of life I could not afford to wait for another autumn, or\r\neven until spring. I had, and still have, the opinion that a\r\nfall-planted tree is nearly six months in advance of one planted the\r\nfollowing spring. Of course there can be no above-ground growth during\r\nthat time, but important things are being done below the surface. The\r\nroots find time to heal their wounds and to send out small searchers\r\nafter food, which will be ready for energetic work as soon as the sun\r\nbegins to warm the soil. The earth settles comfortably about these roots\r\nand is moulded to fit them by the autumn rains. If the stem is well\r\nbraced by a mound of earth, and if a thick mulch is placed around it,\r\nmuch will be done below ground before deep frosts interrupt the work;\r\nand if, in the early spring, the mulch and mound are drawn back, the\r\nsun's influence will set the roots at work earlier by far than a spring\r\ntree could be planted.\r\n\r\nOther reasons for fall planting are that the weather is more settled,\r\nthe ground is more manageable, help is more easily secured, and the\r\nnurserymen have more time for filling your order. Any time from October\r\n15 until December 10 will answer in our climate, but early November is\r\nthe best. I had decided to plant the trees in this orchard twenty-five\r\nfeet apart each way. In the forty acres there would be fifty-two rows,\r\nwith fifty-two trees in each row,--or twenty-seven hundred in all. I\r\nalso decided to have but four varieties of apples in this orchard, and\r\nit was important that they should possess a number of virtues. They must\r\ncome into early bearing, for I was too old to wait patiently for\r\nslow-growing trees; they must be of kinds most dependable for yearly\r\ncrops, for I had no respect for off years; and they must be good enough\r\nin color, shape, and quality to tempt the most fastidious market. I\r\nstudied catalogues and talked with pomologists until my mind was nearly\r\nunsettled, and finally decided upon Jonathan, Wealthy, Rome Beauty, and\r\nNorthwestern Greening,--all winter apples, and all red but the last. I\r\nwas helped in my decision, so far as the Jonathans and Rome Beauties\r\nwere concerned, by the discovery that more than half of the old orchard\r\nwas composed of these varieties.\r\n\r\nThere is little question as to the wisdom of planting trees of kinds\r\nknown to have done well in your neighborhood. They are just as likely to\r\ndo well by you as by your neighbor. If the fruit be to your liking, you\r\ncan safely plant, for it is no longer an experiment; some one else has\r\nbroken that ground for you.\r\n\r\nIn casting about for a reliable nurseryman to whom to trust the very\r\nimportant business of supplying me with young trees, I could not long\r\nkeep my attention diverted from Rochester, New York. Perhaps the reason\r\nwas that as a child I had frequently ridden over the plank road from\r\nHenrietta to Rochester, and my memory recalled distinctly but three\r\nobjects on that road,--the house of Frederick Douglass, Mount Hope\r\nCemetery, and a nursery of young trees. Everything else was obscure. I\r\nfancy that in fifty years the Douglass house has disappeared, but Mount\r\nHope Cemetery and the tree nursery seem to mock at time. The soil and\r\nclimate near Rochester are especially favorable to the growing of young\r\ntrees, and my order went to one of the many reliable firms engaged in\r\nthis business. The order was for thirty-four hundred\r\ntrees,--twenty-seven hundred for the forty-acre orchard and seven\r\nhundred for the ten acres farthest to the south on the home lot. Polly\r\nhad consented to this invasion of her domain, for reasons. She said:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a long way off, rather flat and uninteresting, and I do not see\r\nexactly how to treat it. Apple trees are pretty at most times, and\r\npicturesque when old. You can put them there, if you will seed the\r\nground and treat it as part of the lawn. I hate your old straight rows,\r\nbut I suppose you must have them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess I shall have to have straight rows, but I will agree to\r\nthe lawn plan after the third year. You must give me a chance to\r\ncultivate the land for three years.\"\r\n\r\nYour tree-man must be absolutely reliable. You have to trust him much\r\nand long. Not only do you depend upon him to send you good and healthy\r\nstock, but you must trust, for five years at least, that this stock will\r\nprove true to name. The most discouraging thing which can befall a\r\nhorticulturist is to find his new fruit false to purchase labels. After\r\nwait, worry, and work he finds that he has not what he expected, and\r\nthat he must begin over again. It is cold comfort for the tree-man to\r\nmake good his guarantee to replace all stock found untrue, for five\r\nyears of irreplaceable time has passed. When you have spent time, hope,\r\nand expectation as well as money, looking for results which do not come,\r\nyour disappointment is out of all proportion to your financial loss, be\r\nthat never so great. In the best-managed nurseries there will be\r\nmistakes, but the better the management the fewer the mistakes. Pay good\r\nprices for young trees, and demand the best. There is no economy in\r\ncheap stock, and the sooner the farmer or fruit-grower comprehends this\r\nfact, the better it will be for him. I ordered trees of three years'\r\ngrowth from the bud,--this would mean four-year-old roots. Perhaps it\r\nwould have been as well to buy smaller ones (many wise people have told\r\nme so), but I was in such a hurry! I wanted to pick apples from these\r\ntrees at the first possible moment. I argued that a sturdy\r\nthree-year-old would have an advantage over its neighbor that was only\r\ntwo. However small this advantage, I wanted it in my business--my\r\nbusiness being to make a profitable farm in quick time. The ten acres of\r\nthe home lot were to be planted with three hundred Yellow Transparent,\r\nthree hundred Duchess of Oldenburg, and one hundred mixed varieties for\r\nhome use. I selected the Transparent and the Duchess on account of their\r\ndisposition to bear early, and because they are good sellers in a near\r\nmarket, and because a fruit-wise friend was making money from an\r\neight-year-old orchard of three thousand of these trees, and advised me\r\nnot to neglect them.\r\n\r\nMy order called for thirty-four hundred three-year-old apple trees of\r\nthe highest grade, to be delivered in good condition on the platform at\r\nExeter for the lump sum of $550. The agreement had been made in August,\r\nand the trees were to be delivered as near the 20th of October as\r\npracticable. Apple trees comprised my entire planting for the autumn of\r\n1895. I wanted to do much other work in that line, but it had to be left\r\nfor a more convenient season. Hundreds of fruit trees, shade trees, and\r\nshrubs have since been planted at Four Oaks, but this first setting of\r\nthirty-four hundred apple trees was the most important as well as the\r\nmost urgent.\r\n\r\nThe orchard was to be a prominent feature in the factory I was building,\r\nand as it would be slower in coming to perfection than any other part,\r\nit was wise to start it betimes. I have kicked myself black and blue for\r\nneglecting to plant an orchard ten years earlier. If I had done this,\r\nand had spent two hours a month in the management of it, it would now be\r\na thing of beauty and an income-producing joy forever,--or, at least, as\r\nlong as my great-grandchildren will need it.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of overdoing orcharding. The demand for fruit\r\nincreases faster than the supply, and it is only poor quality or bad\r\nhandling that causes a slack market. If the general farmer will become\r\nan expert orchardist, he will find that year by year his ten acres of\r\nfruit will give him a larger profit than any forty acres of grain land;\r\nbut to get this result he must be faithful to his trees. Much of the\r\ntime they are caring for themselves, and for the owner, too; but there\r\nare times when they require sharp attention, and if they do not get it\r\npromptly and in the right way, they and the owner will suffer. Fruit\r\ngrowing as a sole occupation requires favorable soil, climate, and\r\nmarket, and also a considerable degree of aptitude on the part of the\r\nmanager, to make it highly profitable. A fruit-grower in our climate\r\nmust have other interests if he would make the most of his time. While\r\nwaiting for his fruit he can raise food for hens and hogs; and if he\r\nfeeds hens and hogs, he should keep as many cows as he can. He will then\r\nuse in his own factory all the raw material he can raise. This will\r\nagain be returned to the land as a by-product, which will not only\r\nmaintain the fertility of the farm, but even increase it. If his cows\r\nare of the best, they will yield butter enough to pay for their food and\r\nto give a profit; the skim milk, fed to the hogs and hens, will give\r\neggs and pork out of all proportion to its cost; and everything that\r\ngrows upon his land can thus be turned off as a finished product for a\r\nliberal price, and yet the land will not be depleted. The orchard is\r\nbetter for the hens and hogs and cows, and they are better for the\r\norchard. These industries fit into each other like the folding of hands;\r\nthey seem mutually dependent, and yet they are often divorced, or, at\r\nbest, only loosely related. This view may seem to be the result of _post\r\nhoc_ reasoning, but I think it is not. I believe I imbibed these notions\r\nwith my mother's milk, for I can remember no time when they were not\r\nmine. The psalmist said, \"Comfort me with apples\"; and the psalmist was\r\nreputed a wise man. With only sufficient wisdom to plant an orchard, I\r\nlive in high expectation of finding the same comfort in my old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPLANTING OF THE TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember proved as dry as August was wet,--only half an inch of water\r\nfell; and the seedings would have been slow to start had they depended\r\nfor their moisture upon the clouds. By October 1, however, green had\r\ntaken the place of brown on nearly all the sixty acres we had tilled.\r\nThe threshers came and threshed the wheat and oats. Of wheat there were\r\n311 bushels, of oats, 1272. We stored this grain in the cottage until\r\nthe granary should be ready, and stacked the straw until the forage barn\r\ncould receive it. My plan from the first has been to shelter all forage,\r\neven the meanest, and bright oat straw is not low in the scale.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th the horse stable was far enough advanced to permit the\r\nhorses to be moved, and the old barn was deserted. A neighbor who had\r\nbought this barn at once pulled it down and carted it away. In this\r\ntransaction I held out several days for $50, but as my neighbor was\r\nobdurate I finally accepted his offer. The first entry on the credit\r\nside of my farm ledger is, By one old barn, $45. The receipts for\r\nOctober, November, and December, were:--\r\n\r\nBy one old barn      $45.00\r\n\r\nBy apples on trees (153 trees at $1.85 each)      283.00\r\n\r\nBy 480 bushels of potatoes at 30 cents per bushel      144.00\r\n\r\nBy five old sows, not fat      35.00\r\n\r\nOne cow      15.00\r\n\r\nThree cows      70.00\r\n\r\nTwo cows      35.00\r\n\r\nThree cows, two heifers, nine calves      187.00\r\n\r\nForty-three shoats and gilts, average 162 lb., at 2 cents\r\nper lb      139.00\r\n\r\nTotal      $953.00\r\n\r\nThe young hogs had eaten most of my small potatoes and some of my corn\r\nbefore we parted with them in late November. These sales were made at\r\nthe farm, and at low prices, for I was afraid to send such stuff to\r\nmarket lest some one should find out whence it came. The Four Oaks brand\r\nwas to stand for perfection in the future, and I was not willing to\r\nhandicap it in the least. Top prices for gilt-edged produce is what\r\nintensive farming means; and if there is money in land, it will be found\r\nclose to this line.\r\n\r\nThe potatoes had been dug and sold, or stored in the cellar of the\r\nfarm-house; the apples from the trees reserved for home use had been\r\ngathered, and we were ready for the fall planting. While waiting for the\r\nstock to arrive, we had time to get in all the hay and most of the straw\r\ninto the forage barn, which was now under roof.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 26th, word came that sixteen immense boxes had arrived\r\nat Exeter for us. Three teams were sent at once, and each team brought\r\nhome two boxes. Three trips were made, and the entire prospective\r\norchard was safely landed. Monday saw our whole force at work planting\r\ntrees. Small stakes had been driven to give the exact centre for each\r\nhole, so that the trees, viewed from any direction, would be in straight\r\nlines. Sam, Zeb, and Judson were to dig the holes, putting the surface\r\ndirt to the right, and the poor earth to the left; I was to prune the\r\nroots and keep tab on the labels; Johnson and Anderson were to set the\r\ntrees,--Anderson using a shovel and Johnson his hands, feet, and eyes;\r\nwhile Thompson was to puddle and distribute the trees. The puddling was\r\neasily done. We sawed an oil barrel in halves, placed these halves on a\r\nstone boat, filled them two-thirds full of water, and added a lot of\r\nfine clay. Into this thin mud the roots of each tree were dipped before\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\nMy duty was to shorten the roots that were too long, and to cut away the\r\nbruised and broken ones. The top pruning was to be done after the trees\r\nwere all set and banked. The stock was fine in every respect,--fully up\r\nto promise. Watching Johnson set his first tree convinced me that he\r\nknew more about planting than I did. He lined and levelled it; he pawed\r\nsurface dirt into the hole, and churned the roots up and down; more\r\ndirt, and he tamped it; still more dirt, and he tramped it; yet more\r\ndirt, and he stamped it until the tree stood like a post; then loose\r\ndirt, and he left it. I was sure Johnson knew his business too well to\r\nneed advice from a tenderfoot, so I went back to my root pruning.\r\n\r\nWe were ten days planting these thirty-four hundred trees, but we did it\r\nwell, and the days were short. We finished on the 7th of November. The\r\ntrees were now to be top pruned. I told Johnson to cut every tree in the\r\nbig orchard back to a three-foot stub, unless there was very good reason\r\nfor leaving a few inches (never more than six), and I turned my back on\r\nhim and walked away as I said these cruel words. It seemed a shame to\r\ncut these bushy, long-legged, handsome fellows back to dwarfish\r\ninsignificance and brutish ugliness, but it had to be done. I wanted\r\nstocky, thrifty, low-headed business trees, and there was no other way\r\nto get them. The trees in the lower, or ten-acre, orchard, were not\r\ntreated so severely. Their long legs were left, and their bushy tops\r\nwere only moderately curtailed. We would try both high and low heading.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 11 the shredders came and set up their great\r\nmachine on the floor of the forage barn, ready to commence work the next\r\nmorning. There were ten men in the shredding gang. I furnished six more,\r\nand Bill Jackson came with two others to change work with me; that is,\r\nmy men were to help him when the machine reached his farm. We worked\r\nnineteen men and four teams three and a half days on the forty-three\r\nacres of corn, and as a result, had a tremendous mow of shredded corn\r\nfodder and an immense pile of half-husked ears. For the use of the\r\nmachine and the wages of the ten men I paid $105. Poor economy! Before\r\nnext corn-shredding time I owned a machine,--smaller indeed, but it did\r\nthe work as well (though not as quickly), and it cost me only $215, and\r\nwas good for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe weather had favored me thus far. The wet August had put the ground\r\ninto good condition for seeding, and the dry September and October had\r\npermitted our buildings to be pushed forward, but now everything was to\r\nchange. A light rain began on the morning of the 15th (I did not permit\r\nit to interrupt the shredding, which was finished by noon), and by night\r\nit had developed into a steady downpour that continued, with\r\ninterruptions, for six weeks. November and December of 1895 gave us rain\r\nand snow fall equal to twelve and a half inches of water. Plans at Four\r\nOaks had to be modified. There was no more use for the ploughs. Nos. 10\r\nand 11, and much of the home lot were left until spring. I had planned\r\nto mulch heavily all the newly set trees, and for this purpose had\r\nbought six carloads of manure (at a cost of $72); but this manure could\r\nnot be hauled across the sodden fields, and must needs be piled in a\r\ngreat heap for use in the spring. The carpenters worked at disadvantage,\r\nand the farm men could do little more than keep themselves and the\r\nanimals comfortable. They did, however, finish one good job between\r\nshowers. They tile-drained the routes for the two roads on the home\r\nlot,--the straight one east and west through the building line, about\r\n1000 feet, and the winding carriage drive to the site of the main house,\r\nabout 1850 feet. The tile pipe cost $123. They also set a lot of fence\r\nposts in the soft ground.\r\n\r\nBuilding progressed slowly during the bad weather, but before the end of\r\nDecember the horse barn, the woodshed, the granary, the forage barn, and\r\nthe power-house were completed, and most of the machinery was in place.\r\nThe machinery consisted of a fifteen horse-power engine, with shafting\r\nrunning to the forage barn, the granary, and the woodshed. A power-saw\r\nwas set in the end of the shed, a grinding mill in the granary, and a\r\nfodder-cutter in the forage barn. The cost of these items was:--\r\n\r\nEngine and shafting      $187.00\r\n\r\nSaw      24.00\r\n\r\nMill      32.00\r\n\r\nFeed-cutter and carrier      76.00\r\n\r\nTotal      $319.00\r\n\r\nI gave the services of my two carpenters, Thompson and Sam, during most\r\nof this time to Nelson, for I had but little work for them, and he was\r\nnot making much out of his job.\r\n\r\nThe last few days of 1895 turned clear and cold, and the barometer set\r\n\"fair.\" The change chirked us up, and we ended the year in good spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPOLLY'S JUDGMENT HALL\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore closing the books, we should take account of stock, to see what\r\nwe had purchased with our money. Imprimis: 320 acres of good land,\r\nsatisfactory to the eye, well fenced and well groomed; 3400 apple trees,\r\nso well planted as to warrant a profitable future; a water and sewer\r\nsystem as good as a city could supply; farm buildings well planned and\r\nsufficient for the day; an abundance of food for all stock, and to\r\nspare; an intelligent and willing working force; machinery for more than\r\npresent necessity; eight excellent horses and their belongings; six\r\ncows, moderately good; two pigs and two score fowls, to be eaten before\r\nspring, and _a lot of fun_. What price I shall have to put against this\r\nlast item to make the account balance, I can tell better when I foot the\r\nother side of the ledger.\r\n\r\nBut first I must add a few items to the debit account. Moving the\r\ncottage cost $30. I paid $134 for grass seed and seed rye. The wage\r\naccount for six men and two women for five months was $735. Their food\r\naccount was $277. Of course the farm furnished milk, cream, butter,\r\nvegetables, some fruit, fresh pork, poultry, and eggs. There were also\r\nsome small freight bills, which had not been accounted for, amounting to\r\n$31, and $8 had been spent in transportation for the men. Then the farm\r\nmust be charged with interest on all money advanced, when I had\r\ncompleted my additions. The rate was to be five per cent, and the time\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the year I went to the farm to pay up to date all\r\naccounts. I wished to end the year with a clean score. I did not know\r\nwhat the five months had cost me (I would know that evening), but I did\r\nknow that I had had \"the time of my life\" in the spending, and I would\r\nnot whine. I felt a little nervous when I thought of going over the\r\nfigures with Polly,--she was such a judicious spender of money. But I\r\nknew her criticism would not be severe, for she was hand-in-glove with\r\nme in the project. I tried to find fault with myself for wastefulness,\r\nbut some excellent excuse would always crop up. \"Your water tower is\r\nunnecessary.\" \"Yes, but it adds to the landscape, and it has its use.\"\r\n\"You have put up too much fencing.\" \"True, but I wanted to feel secure,\r\nand the old fences were such nests of weeds and rubbish.\" \"You have\r\nspent too much money on the farm-house.\" \"I think not, for the laborer\r\nis worthy of his hire, and also of all reasonable creature comforts.\"\r\nAnd thus it went on. I would not acknowledge myself in the wrong; nor,\r\narguing how I might, could I find aught but good in my labors. I\r\ndevoutly hoped to be able to put the matter in the same light when I\r\nstood at the bar in Polly's judgment hall.\r\n\r\nThe day was clear, cool, and stimulating. A fair fall of snow lay on the\r\nground, clean and wholesome, as country snow always is. I wished that\r\nthe house was finished (it was not begun), and that the family was with\r\nme in it. \"Another Christmas time will find us here, God willing, and\r\nmany a one thereafter.\"\r\n\r\nI spent three hours at the farm, doing a little business and a lot of\r\nmooning, and then returned to town. The children were off directly after\r\ndinner, intent on holiday festivities, so that Polly and I had the house\r\nto ourselves. I felt that we needed it. I invited my partner into the\r\nden, lighted a pipe for consolation, unlocked the drawer in which the\r\nfarm ledger is kept, gave a small deprecatory cough, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"My dear, I am afraid I have spent an awful lot of money in the last\r\nfive months. You see there is such a quantity of things to do at once,\r\nand they run into no end of money. You know, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I know it, and I know that you have got the worth of it,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nWouldn't that console you! How was I to know that Polly would hail from\r\nthat quarter? I would have kissed her hand, if she would have permitted\r\nsuch liberty; I kissed her lips, and was ready to defend any sum total\r\nwhich the ledger dare show.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how much it is?\" said Polly.\r\n\r\n\"Not within a million!\" I was reckless then, and hoped the total would\r\nbe great, for had not Polly said that she knew I had got the worth of my\r\nmoney? And who was to gainsay her? \"It is more than I planned for, I\r\nknow, but I do not see how I could use less without losing precious\r\ntime. We started into this thing with the theory that the more we put\r\ninto it, without waste, the more we would ultimately get out of it. Our\r\ntheory is just as sound to-day as it was five months ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will win out all right in the end, Mr. Headman, for we will not put\r\nthe price-mark on health, freedom, happiness, or fun, until we have seen\r\nthe debit side of the ledger.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much do you want to spend for the house?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean the house alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the house and carriage barn. I'll pay for the trees, shrubs, and\r\nkickshaws in the gardens and lawns.\"\r\n\r\n\"You started out with a plan for a $10,000 house, didn't you? Well, I\r\ndon't think that's enough. You ought to give me $15,000 for the house\r\nand barn and let me see what I can do with it; and you ought to give it\r\nto me right away, so that you cannot spend it for pigs and foolish farm\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it within ten days, Polly; and I won't meddle in your affairs\r\nif you will agree to keep within the limit.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bargain,\" said Polly, \"and the house will be much more livable\r\nthan this one. What do you think we could sell this one for?\"\r\n\r\n\"About $33,000 or $34,000, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you sell it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if you don't object.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sell, to be sure; it would be foolish to keep it, for we'll be country\r\nfolk in a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a theory,\" said I, \"that when we live on the farm we ought to\r\ncredit the farm with what it costs us for food and shelter\r\nhere,--providing, of course, that the farm feeds and shelters us as\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will do it a great deal better. We will have a better house, better\r\nfood, more company, more leisure, more life, and more everything that\r\ncounts, than we ever had before.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll fix the value of those things when we've had experience,\" said I.\r\n\"Now let's get at the figures. I tell you plainly that I don't know what\r\nthey foot up,--less than $40,000, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let's worry about them, no matter what they say.\"\r\n\r\nThis from prudent, provident Polly!\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said I, as bold as a lion.\r\n\r\n\"There are thirty-five items on the debit side of the ledger and a few\r\nlittle ones on the credit side. Hold your breath while I add them.\r\n\r\n\"I have spent $44,331 and have received $953, which leaves a debit\r\nbalance of $43,378.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't so awfully bad, when you think of all the fun you've had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fun comes high at this time of the year, doesn't it, Polly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much depends on what you call high. You have waited and worked a long\r\ntime for this. I won't say a word if you spend all you have in the\r\nworld. It's yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine and yours and the children's; but I won't spend it all. Seventy or\r\nseventy-five thousand dollars, besides your house and barn money, shall\r\nbe my limit. There is still an item of interest to be added to this\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\"Interest! Why, John Williams, do you mean to tell me that you borrowed\r\nthis money? I thought it was your own to do as you liked with. Have you\r\ngot to pay interest on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was mine, but I loaned it to the farm. Before I made this loan I was\r\ngetting five per cent on the money. I must now look to the farm for my\r\nfive per cent. If it cannot pay this interest promptly, I shall add the\r\ndeferred payment to the principal, and it shall bear interest. This must\r\nbe done each year until the net income from the farm is greater than the\r\ninterest account. Whatever is over will then be used to reduce the\r\nprincipal.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a long speech, but I don't think it's very clear. I don't see\r\nwhy a man should pay interest on his own money. The farm is yours, isn't\r\nit? You bought it with your own money, didn't you? What difference does\r\nit make whether you charge interest or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the least difference in the world to us, Polly, but a great deal to\r\nthe experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I forgot the experiment. And how much interest do you add?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred and forty-two dollars. Also, $75 to the lawyer and $5 for\r\nrecording the deed, making the whole debt of the farm to me $44,000\r\neven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it come out just even $44,000? I believe you've manipulated the\r\nfigures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life! Add them yourself. They were put down at all sorts of\r\ntimes during the past five months. My dear, I wish you a good-night and\r\na happy New Year. You have given me a very happy ending for the old\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWINTER WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new year opened full of all sorts of interests and new projects.\r\nThere were so many things to plan for and to commence at the farm that\r\nwe often got a good deal mixed up. I can hardly expect to make a\r\nconnected narrative of the various plans and events, so will follow each\r\none far enough to launch it and then leave it for future development.\r\n\r\nLittle snow fell in January and February '96. The weather was average\r\nwinter weather, and a good deal of outdoor work was done. On the 2d I\r\nwent to the farm to plan with Thompson an outline for the two months. I\r\nhad decided to make Thompson the foreman, for I had watched him\r\ncarefully for five months and was satisfied that I might go farther and\r\nfare a great deal worse. Indeed, I thought myself very fortunate to have\r\nfound such a dependable man. He was temperate and good-natured, and he\r\nhad a bluff, hearty way with the other men that made it easy for them to\r\naccept his directions. He was thorough, too, in his work. He knew how a\r\njob should be done, and he was not satisfied until it was finished\r\ncorrectly. He was not a worker for work's sake, as was Anderson, but he\r\nwas willing to put his shoulder to the wheel for results.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till I get my shoulder under it,\" was a favorite expression with\r\nhim, and I am frank to say that when this conjunction took place there\r\nwas apt to be something doing. Thompson is still at Four Oaks, and it\r\nwill be a bad day for the farm when he leaves.\r\n\r\n\"Thompson,\" said I, \"you are to be working foreman out here, and I want\r\nyou to put your mind on the business and keep it there. I cannot raise\r\nyour wages, for I have a system; but you shall have $50 as a Christmas\r\npresent if things go well. Will you stay on these terms?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will stay, all right, Dr. Williams, and I will give the best I've\r\ngot. I like the looks of this place, and I want to see how you are going\r\nto work it out.\"\r\n\r\nThat being settled, I told Thompson of some things that must be done\r\nduring January and February.\r\n\r\n\"You must get out a great lot of wood, have it sawed, and store it in\r\nthe shed, more than enough for a year's use. The wood should be taken\r\nfrom that which is already down. Don't cut any standing trees, even\r\nthough they are dead. Use all limbs that are large enough, but pile the\r\nbrushwood where it can be burned. We must do wise forestry in these\r\nwoods, and we will have an unlimited supply of fuel. I mean that the\r\nwood lot shall grow better rather than worse as the years go by. We\r\ncannot do much for it now, but more in time. You must see to it that the\r\nmen are not careless about young trees,--no breaking or knocking down\r\nwill be in order. Another thing to look after is the ice supply. I will\r\nget Nelson to build an ice-house directly, and you must look around for\r\nthe ice. Have you any idea as to where it can be had?\"\r\n\r\n\"A big company is getting ice on Round Lake three miles west, and I\r\nsuppose they will sell you what you want,\" said Thompson, \"and our teams\r\ncan haul it all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose they will charge per ton on their platform?\"\r\n\r\n\"From twenty-five to forty cents, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, make as good a bargain as you can, and attend to it at the\r\nbest time. When the teams are not hauling ice or wood, let them draw\r\ngravel from French's pit. It will be hard to get it out in the winter,\r\nbut I guess it can be done, and we will need a lot of it on these roads.\r\nHave it dumped at convenient places, and we will put it on the drives in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing,--we must have a bridge across the brook on each lane.\r\nYou will find timbers and planks enough in the piles from the old barns\r\nto make good bridges, and the men can do the work. Then there is all\r\nthat wire for the inside fences to stretch and staple; but mind, no\r\nbarbed wire is to be put on top of inside fences.\r\n\r\n\"These five jobs will keep you busy for the next two months, for\r\nthere'll be only four men besides yourself to do them. I am going to set\r\nSam at the chicken plant. I'll see you before long, and we'll go over\r\nthe cow and hog plans; but you have your work cut out for the next two\r\nmonths. By the way, how much of an ice-house shall I need?\"\r\n\r\n\"How many cows are you going to milk?\"\r\n\r\n\"About forty when we run at full speed; perhaps half that number this\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then you'd better build a house for four hundred tons. That won't\r\nbe too big when you are on full time, and it's a mighty bad thing to run\r\nshort of ice.\"\r\n\r\nI saw Nelson the same day and contracted with him for an ice-house\r\ncapable of holding four hundred tons, for $900. The walls of the house\r\nto be of three thicknesses of lumber with two air spaces (one four\r\ninches, the other two) without filling. As a result of the conference\r\nwith Thompson, I had, before the first of March, a wood-house full of\r\nwood, which seemed a supply for two years at full steam; an ice-house\r\nnearly full of ice; two serviceable bridges across the brook; the wire\r\nfencing almost completed; and eighty loads of gravel,--about one-third\r\nof what I needed. The whole cash outlay was,--\r\n\r\n300 tons of ice at 30 cents per ton        $90.00\r\n80 tons of gravel at 25 cents per load      20.00\r\nFence staples                               19.00\r\n                                           ------\r\n              Total                       $129.00\r\n\r\nThe conference with Sam Jones, the hen man, was deferred until my next\r\nvisit, and my plans for the cow barn, dairy-house, and hog-house were\r\nleft to Nelson for consideration, he promising to give me estimates\r\nwithin a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nWHAT SHALL WE ASK OF THE HEN?\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Jones, the chicken-loving man, was as pleased as a boy with a new\r\ntop when I began to talk of a hen plant. He had a lot of practical\r\nknowledge of the business, for he had _failed_ in it twice; and I could\r\nfurnish any amount of theory, and enough money to prevent disaster.\r\n\r\nIn his previous attempts he had invested nearly all his small capital in\r\na plant that might yield two hundred eggs a day; he had to buy all foods\r\nin small quantities, and therefore at high prices; and he had to give\r\nhis whole time to a business which was too small and too much on the\r\nhand-to-mouth order to give him a living profit. My theory of the\r\nbusiness was entirely different. I could plan for results, and, what was\r\nmore to the point, I could wait for them. Mistakes, accidents, even\r\ndisasters, were disarmed by a bank account; my bread and butter did not\r\ndepend upon the temper of a whimsical hen. The food would cost the\r\nminimum. All grains and green food, and most of the animal food, in the\r\nform of skim milk, would be furnished by the farm. I meant also to\r\ndevelop a plant large enough to warrant the full attention of an\r\nable-bodied man. I felt no hesitation about this venture, for I did not\r\nintend to ask more of my hens than a well-disposed hen ought to be\r\nwilling to grant.\r\n\r\nI do not ask a hen to lay a double-yolk every day in the year. That is\r\ntoo much to expect of a creature in whom the mother instinct is\r\nprominent, and who wishes also to have a new dress for herself at least\r\nonce in that time. I do not wish a hen to work overtime for me. If she\r\nwill furnish me with eight dozen of her finished product per annum, I\r\nwill do the rest. Whatever she does more than that shall redound to her\r\ncredit. Two-hundred-eggs-a-year hens are scarcer than hens with teeth,\r\nand I was not looking for the unusual. A hen can easily lay one hundred\r\neggs in three hundred and sixty-five days, and yet find time for\r\ndomestic and social affairs. She can feel that she is not a subject for\r\ncharity, while at the same time she retains her self-respect as a hen of\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nI have the highest regard for this domestic fowl, and I would not for a\r\ngreat deal impose a too arduous task upon her. I feel like encouraging\r\nher in her peculiar industry, for which she is so eminently fitted, but\r\nnot like forcing her into strenuous efforts that would rob her of\r\nvivacity and dull her social and domestic impulses. No; if the hen will\r\npolitely present me with one hundred eggs a year, I will thank her and\r\nask no more. Some one will say: \"How can you make hens pay if they don't\r\nlay more than eight dozen eggs a year? Eggs sometimes sell as low as\r\ntwelve cents per dozen.\"\r\n\r\nFour Oaks hens never have laid one-cent eggs, and never will. They would\r\nquit work if such a price were suggested. Ninety per cent of the eggs\r\nfrom Four Oaks have sold for thirty cents or more per dozen, and the\r\ndemand is greater than the supply. The Four Oaks certificate that the\r\negg is not thirty-six hours old when it reaches the egg cup, makes two\r\nand a half cents look small to those who can afford to pay for the best.\r\nTo lack confidence in the egg is a serious matter at the breakfast\r\ntable, and a person who can insure perfect trust will not lack\r\npatronage. If, therefore, a hen will lay eight dozen eggs, she is\r\nwelcome to say to an acquaintance: \"I have just handed the Headman a\r\ntwo-dollar bill,\" for she knows that I have not paid fifty cents for her\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nOf course the wages of the hen man and his food and the interest on the\r\nplant must be counted, but I do not propose to count them twice. Four\r\nOaks is a factory where several things are made, each in a measure\r\ndependent on, and useful to, the others, and we cannot itemize costs of\r\nsingle products because of this mutual dependence. I feel certain that I\r\ncould not drop one of the factory's industries without loss to each of\r\nthe others. For this reason I kept a very simple set of books. I charged\r\nthe farm with all money spent for it, and credited it with all moneys\r\nreceived. Even now I have no very definite knowledge of what it costs\r\nto keep a hen, a hog, or a cow; nor do I care. Such data are greatly\r\ninfluenced by location, method of getting supplies, and market\r\nfluctuations. I furnish most of my food, and my own market. My crops\r\nhave never entirely failed, and I take little heed whether they be large\r\nor small. They are not for sale as crops, but as finished products. I am\r\nnot willing to sell them at any price, for I want them consumed on the\r\nplace for the sake of the land.\r\n\r\nCorn has sold for eighty cents a bushel since I began this experiment,\r\nyet at that time I fed as much as ever and was not tempted to sell a\r\nbushel, though I could easily have spared five thousand. When it went\r\ndown to twenty-eight cents, I did not care, for corn and oats to me are\r\nsimply in transition state,--not commodities to be bought or sold. They\r\ncost me, one year with another, about the same. An abundant harvest\r\nfills my granaries to overflowing; a bad harvest doesn't deplete them,\r\nfor I do not sell my surplus for fear that I, too, may have to buy out\r\nof a high market. I have bought corn and oats a few times, but only when\r\nthe price was decidedly below my idea of the feeding value of these\r\ngrains. I can find more than twenty-eight cents in a bushel of corn, and\r\nmore than eighteen cents in thirty-two pounds of oats. But I am away off\r\nmy subject. I began to talk about the hen plant, and have wandered to my\r\nfavorite fad,--the factory farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nWHITE WYANDOTTES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sam,\" said I, \"I am going to start this poultry plant from just as near\r\nthe beginning of things as possible. I want you to dispose of every hen\r\non the place within the next twenty days, and to burn everything that\r\nhas been used in connection with them. We've cleared this land of\r\ndisease germs, if there were germs in it, by turning it bottom-side up;\r\nnow let's start free from the pestiferous vermin that make a hen's life\r\nunhappy. No stock, either old or young, shall be brought here. When we\r\nwant to change our breeding, we'll buy eggs from the best fanciers and\r\nhatch them in our own incubators. It will then be our own fault if we\r\ndon't keep our chickens comfortable and free from their enemies. This is\r\nsound theory, and we'll try how it works out in practice. Certainly it\r\nwill be easier to keep clean if we start clean. Not one board or piece\r\nof lumber that has been used for any other purpose shall find place in\r\nmy hen-houses. Eternal vigilance makes a full egg basket; and a full egg\r\nbasket means a lot of money at the year's end. I will never find fault\r\nwith you for being too careful Attend to the details in such way as\r\nsuits you best, provided the result is thorough and everlasting\r\ncleanliness. Nothing less will win out, and nothing less will meet the\r\nrequirements of our factory rules.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to do is to get the incubating cellar made. It ought to\r\nbe four feet in the ground and four feet out of it. Make it ten feet by\r\nfifteen, inside measure, and you can easily run five two-hundred-egg\r\nincubators. Build it near the south fence in No. 4,--that's the lot for\r\nthe hens. The walls are to be of brick, and we'll have a brick floor put\r\nin, for it's too cold to concrete it now. Gables are to point east and\r\nwest, and each is to have a window; put the door in the middle of the\r\nsouth wall, and shingle the roof. Digging through three feet of frost\r\nwill be hard, but it must be done, and done quickly. I want you to start\r\nyour incubator lamps before the 3d of February.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can dig the hole without much trouble,--big fire on the ground for\r\ntwo or three hours will help,--and I can put on the roof and do all the\r\ncarpenter work, but I can't lay the brick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll look out for that part of the job, but I want you to see that\r\nthings are pushed, for I shall have a thousand eggs here by February 1st\r\nand another thousand by the 25th, and these eggs mean money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you have to pay for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten cents apiece,--$200 for two thousand eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should say! Are they hand-painted? I wouldn't have had to quit\r\nbusiness if I could have sold my eggs at a quarter of that price.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Sam, but you didn't sell White Wyandotte eggs for\r\nhatching. I've contracted with two of the best-known fanciers of\r\nWyandottes in the country to send me five hundred eggs apiece February\r\n1st and 25th. I don't think the price is high for the stock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you decided to keep 'dottes? I hoped you would try Leghorns;\r\nthey're great layers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they're great summer layers, but the American birds will beat them\r\nhollow in winter; and I must have as steady a supply of eggs as\r\npossible. My customers don't stop eating eggs in winter, and they'll be\r\nwilling to pay more for them at that season. The Leghorn is too small to\r\nmake a good broiler, and as half the chicks come cockerels, we must look\r\nout for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you throw down the Plymouth Rocks? They're bigger than 'dottes,\r\nand just as good layers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I threw down the barred Plymouth Rocks on account of color; I like\r\nwhite hens best. It was hard to decide between White Rocks and\r\nWyandottes, for there's mighty little difference between them as\r\nall-around hens. I really think I chose the 'dottes because the first\r\nreply to my letters was from a man who was breeding them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are 'beauts,' all of them, and I'll give them a good chance to\r\nspread themselves,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"What percentage of hatch may we expect from purchased eggs?\"\r\n\r\n\"About sixty chicks out of every hundred eggs, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be doing pretty well, wouldn't it? If we had good luck with\r\nthe sixty chicks, how many would grow up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty ought to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of these fifty, can we count on twenty-five pullets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I was getting at. You think we might, by good luck, raise\r\ntwenty-five pullets from each hundred eggs. I'll cut that in the middle\r\nand be satisfied with twelve, or even with ten. At that rate the two\r\nthousand eggs that cost $200 will give me two hundred pullets to begin\r\nthe egg-making next November. That's not enough; we ought to raise just\r\ntwice that number. I'll spend as much more on eggs to be hatched by the\r\nmiddle of April or the first of May, and then we can reasonably expect\r\nto go into next winter with four hundred pullets. They will cost the\r\nfarm a dollar apiece, but the farm will have four hundred cockerels to\r\nsell at fifty cents each, which will materially reduce the cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you put that pretty low, sir; we ought to raise more than four\r\nhundred pullets out of four thousand eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything more will be clear gain. I shall be satisfied with four\r\nhundred. We must also get at the brooder house. This is the order in\r\nwhich I want the buildings to stand in the chicken lot: first, the\r\nincubating house, 10 feet from the south line; 40 feet north of this,\r\nthe brooder house; and 120 feet north of that, the first hen-house, with\r\nruns 100 feet deep. We'll build other houses for the birds as we need\r\nthem. They are all to face to the south. If the brooder house is 50 feet\r\nlong and 15 feet wide, it can easily care for the eight hundred chicks,\r\nand for half as many more, if we are lucky enough to get them.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have a five-foot walk against the north wall of this house, and a\r\nten-foot space north and south through the centre for heating plant and\r\nfood. This will leave a space at each side ten by twenty feet, to be cut\r\ninto five pens four feet by ten, each of which will mother a hundred\r\nchicks or more. There must be plenty of glass in the south wall, and\r\nwe'll use overhead water pipes in each hover.\r\n\r\n\"There's no hurry about the poultry-houses. You can build one in the\r\nearly summer, and perhaps another in the fall. I expect you to do the\r\ncarpenter work on these houses. I'll see the mason at once and have him\r\nready by the time you've dug the hole. The incubators will be here in\r\ngood time, and we want everything ready for work as soon as the eggs\r\narrive.\"\r\n\r\nSam was pleased with his job; it was exactly to his liking. He took real\r\ndelight in caring for fowls, and he was especially anxious to prove to\r\nme that it was not so much lack of knowledge as lack of capital that had\r\ncaused the downfall of his previous efforts. Sam could not then\r\nunderstand why one man could sell his eggs at thirty-six cents a dozen\r\nwhen his neighbor could get only sixteen; he found out later.\r\n\r\nThe mason's work for the incubator house and the foundation wall for the\r\nbrooder house cost $290. The lumber bill for these two, including doors\r\nand windows, was $464. The five incubators, $65, and the hot-water\r\nheater for the brooder house, $68, made the total $897. Add to this $400\r\npaid during two months for eggs, and we have $1297 as the cost of\r\nstarting the poultry plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nFRIED PORK\r\n\r\n\r\nI had given Nelson this sketch as a guide in working out the plan for\r\nthe cow barn: Length over all, 130 feet; width, 40 feet. This\r\nparallelogram was to be divided lengthwise into three equal spaces, one\r\nin the centre for a driveway, and one on each side for the cow platforms\r\nand feeding mangers. Twenty feet at the west end of the barn was\r\npartitioned off, one corner for a small granary, the other for a kitchen\r\nin which the food was to be prepared. These rooms were each thirteen\r\nfeet by twenty. At the other end of the building, ten feet on each side\r\nwas given over to hospital purposes,--a lying-in ward ten feet by\r\nthirteen being on each side of the driveway.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for this building was to be of stone, and the entire\r\nfloor of cement; and the walls were to be sealed within and sheeted\r\nwithout, and then covered with ship lap boards, making three thicknesses\r\nof boards. It was to be one story high. An east-and-west passage,\r\ncutting the main drive at right angles, divided the barn at its middle.\r\nAt the south end of this passage was a door leading to the dairy-house,\r\nwhich was on the building line 150 feet away. The four spaces made by\r\nthese passages were each subdivided into ten stalls five feet wide. Two\r\ndoors on the north and two on the south gave exit for the cows. I had\r\nplaced my limit at forty milch cows, and I thought this stable would\r\nfurnish suitable quarters for that number. If I had to rebuild, I would\r\nmake some modifications. Experience is a good teacher; but the stable\r\nhas served its purpose, and I cannot quarrel with the results. The chief\r\ndefect is in the distribution of water. The supply is abundant, but it\r\nis let on only in the kitchen, whence it is supplied to the cows by\r\nmeans of a hose or a barrel swung between wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen are appliances for mixing and cooking food, and for\r\nwarming the drinking water in winter. Nelson and I discussed the sketch\r\nplan given below, and he found some fault with it. I would not be\r\ndissuaded from my views, however, and Nelson had to yield. I was as\r\nopinionated in those days as a theoretical amateur is apt to be; and it\r\nwas hard to give up my theories at the suggestion of a person who had\r\nonly experience to guide him. The best plan, as I have long since\r\nlearned, is to mix the two and use the solid substance that results from\r\ntheir combination.\r\n\r\nWe located the site of the building, and talked plans until the low sun\r\nof January 8th disappeared in the west. Then we adjourned to the sitting\r\nroom of the farm-house to finish the matter so far as was possible. An\r\nhour and a half passed, and we were in fair accord, when Mrs. Thompson\r\ncame into the room to say that supper was ready, and to ask us to join\r\nthe men at table before starting homeward. I was glad of the\r\nopportunity, for I was curious to know if Mrs. Thompson set a good\r\ntable. We went into the dining room just as the farm family was ready to\r\nsit down. There were ten of us,--two women, six men, Nelson, and myself;\r\nand as we sat down, I noticed with pleasure that each had evidently\r\ntaken some thought of the obligations which a table ought to impose. The\r\ntable was clothed in clean white, and there was a napkin at each plate.\r\nNelson and I had the only perfectly fresh ones, and this I took as\r\nevidence that napkins were usual. The food was all on the table, and was\r\nvery satisfactory to look at. Thompson sat at one end, and before him,\r\non a great platter, lay two dozen or more pieces of fried salt pork,\r\ncrisp in their shells of browned flour, and fit for a king. On one side\r\nof the platter was a heaping dish of steaming potatoes. A knife had\r\nbeen drawn once around each, just to give it a chance to expand and show\r\nmealy white between the gaping circles that covered its bulk. At the\r\nother side was a boat of milk gravy, which had followed the pork into\r\nthe frying-pan and had come forth fit company for the boiled potatoes. I\r\nwent back forty years at one jump, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"I now renew my youth. Is there anything better under the sun than fried\r\nsalt pork and milk gravy? If there is, don't tell me of it, for I have\r\nworshipped at this shrine for forty years, and my faith must not be\r\nshaken.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a supper twice or thrice a week would warm the cockles of my old\r\nheart; but Polly says, \"No modern cook can make these things just right;\r\nand if not just right, they are horrid.\" That is true; it takes an\r\nartist or a mother to fry salt pork and make milk gravy.\r\n\r\nThere were other things on the table,--quantities of bread and butter,\r\napple sauce (in a dish that would hold half a peck), stacks of fresh\r\nginger-bread, tea, and great pitchers of milk; but naught could distract\r\nmy attention from the _pièce de résistance_. Thrice I sent my plate\r\nback, and then could do no more. That meal convinced me that I could\r\ntrust Mrs. Thompson. A woman who could fry salt pork as my mother did,\r\nwas a woman to be treasured.\r\n\r\nI left the farm-house at 7, and reached home by 8.45. Polly was not\r\nquite pleased with my late hours; she said it did not worry her not to\r\nknow where I was, but it was annoying.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you have a telephone put into the farm-house? It would be\r\nconvenient in a lot of ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course; I don't see why it can't be done at once. I'll make\r\napplication this very night.\"\r\n\r\nIt was six weeks before we really got a wire to the farm, but after that\r\nwe wondered how we ever got along without it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA RATION FOR PRODUCT\r\n\r\n\r\nNelson was to commence work on the cow-house at once; at least, the\r\nmason was. I left the job as a whole to Nelson, and he made some sort of\r\ncontract with the mason. The agreement was that I should pay $4260 for\r\nthe barn complete. The machinery we put into it was very simple,--a\r\nwater heater and two cauldrons for cooking food. All three cost about\r\n$60.\r\n\r\nThompson had selected six cows, from those bought with the place, as\r\nworth wintering. They were now giving from six to eight quarts each, and\r\nwere due to come in in April and May. An eight-quart-a-day cow was not\r\nmuch to my liking, but Thompson said that with good care they would do\r\nbetter in the spring. \"Four of those cows ought to make fine milkers,\"\r\nhe said; \"they are built for it,--long bodies, big bags, milk veins that\r\nstand out like crooked welts, light shoulders, slender necks, and lean\r\nheads. They are young, too; and if you'll dehorn them, I believe they'll\r\nmake your thoroughbreds hump themselves to keep up with them at the milk\r\npail. You see, these cows never had more than half a chance to show\r\nwhat they could do. They have never been 'fed for milk.' Farmers don't\r\ndo that much. They think that if a cow doesn't bawl for food or drink\r\nshe has enough. I suppose she has enough to keep her from starving, and\r\nperhaps enough to hold her in fair condition, but not enough to do this\r\nand fill the milk pail, too. I read somewhere about a ration for\r\n'maintenance' and one for 'product,' and there was a deal of difference.\r\nMost farmers don't pay much attention to these things, and I guess\r\nthat's one reason why they don't get on faster.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got the whole matter down fine in that 'ration for product,'\r\nThompson, and that's what we want on this farm. A ration that will\r\nsimply keep a cow or a hen in good health leaves no margin for profit.\r\nCows and hens are machines, and we must treat them as such. Crowd in the\r\nraw material, and you may look for large results in finished product.\r\nThe question ought always to be, How much can a cow eat and drink? not,\r\nHow little can she get on with? Grain and forage are to be turned into\r\nmilk, and the more of these foods our cows eat, the better we like it.\r\nIf these machines work imperfectly, we must get rid of them at once and\r\nat any price. It will not pay to keep a cow that persistently falls\r\nbelow a high standard. We waste time on her, and the smooth running of\r\nthe factory is interrupted. I'm going to place a standard on this farm\r\nof nine thousand pounds a year for each matured cow; I don't think that\r\ntoo high. If a cow falls much below that amount, she must give place to\r\na better one, for I'm not making this experiment entirely for my health.\r\nThe standard isn't too high, yet it's enough to give a fine profit. It\r\nmeans at least three hundred and fifty pounds of butter a year, and in\r\nthis case the butter means at least thirty cents a pound, or more than\r\n$100 a year for each cow. This is all profit, if one wishes to figure it\r\nby itself, for the skimmed milk will more than pay for the food and\r\ncare. But why did you say dehorn the cows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I notice that a man with a club is almost sure to find some use\r\nfor it. If he isn't pounding the fence or throwing it at a dog, he's\r\nsnipping daisies or knocking the heads off bull-thistles. He's always\r\ndoing something with it just because he has it in his hand. It's the\r\nsame way with a cow. If she has horns, she'll use them in some way, and\r\nthey take her mind off her business. No, sir; a cow will do a lot better\r\nwithout horns. There's mighty little to distract her attention when her\r\nclubs are gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What breeds of cows have you handled, Thompson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not any thoroughbreds that I know of; mostly common kinds and grade\r\nJerseys or Holsteins.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to put a small herd of thorough bred Holsteins on the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you try thoroughbred Jerseys' They'll give as much butter,\r\nand they won't eat more than half as much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't quite catch my idea, Thompson. I want the cow that will eat\r\nthe most, if she is, at the same time, willing to pay for her food. I\r\nmean to raise a lot of food, and I want a home market for it. What comes\r\nfrom the land must go back to it, or it will grow thin. The Holstein\r\nwill eat more than the Jersey, and, while she may not make more butter,\r\nshe will give twice as much skimmed milk and furnish more fertilizer to\r\nreturn to the land. Fresh skimmed milk is a food greatly to be prized by\r\nthe factory-farm man; and when we run at full speed, we shall have three\r\nhundred thousand pounds of it to feed.\r\n\r\n\"I have purchased twenty three-year-old Holstein cows, in calf to\r\nadvanced registry bulls, and they are to be delivered to me March 10. I\r\nshall want you to go and fetch them. I also bought a young bull from the\r\nsame herd, but not from the same breeding. These twenty-one animals will\r\ncost, by the time they get here, $2200. I shall give the bull to my\r\nneighbor Jackson. He will be proud to have it, and I shall be relieved\r\nof the care of it. Be good to your neighbor, Thompson, if by so doing\r\nyou can increase the effectiveness of the factory farm. We will start\r\nthe dairy with twenty thoroughbreds and six scrubs. I shall probably buy\r\nand sell from time to time; but of one thing I am certain: if a cow\r\ncannot make our standard, she goes to the butcher, be she mongrel or\r\nthoroughbred. What do you think of Judson as a probable dairyman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder if he would do first-rate. He's a quiet fellow, and\r\ncows like that. He has those roans tagging him all over the place; and\r\nif a horse likes a man, it's because he's nice and quiet in his ways. I\r\nnotice that he can milk a cow quicker than the other men, and it ain't\r\nbecause he don't milk dry--I sneaked after him twice. The cow just gives\r\ndown for him better than for the others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE RAZORBACK\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now launched three of the four principal industries of our\r\nfactory farm. The fourth is perhaps the most important of all, if a\r\nsingle member of a group of mutually dependent industries can have this\r\ndistinction. There is no question that the farmer's best friend is the\r\nhog. He will do more for him and ask less of him than any other animal.\r\nAll he asks is to be born. That is enough for this non-ruminant\r\nquadruped, who can find his living in the earth, the roadside ditch, or\r\nthe forest, and who, out of a supply of grass, roots, or mast, can\r\nfurnish ham and bacon to the king's taste and the poor man's\r\nmaintenance. The half-wild razorback, with never a clutch of corn to his\r\nback, gives abundant food to the mountaineer over whose forest he\r\nranges. The cropped or slit ear is the only evidence of human care or\r\nhuman ownership. He lives the life of a wild beast, and in the autumn he\r\ndies the death of a wild beast; while his flesh, made rich with juices\r\nof acorns, beechnuts, and other sweet masts, nourishes a man whose only\r\nexercise of ownership is slaughter. The hog that can make his own\r\nliving, run like a deer, and drink out of a jug, has done more for the\r\npioneer and the backwoodsman than any other animal.\r\n\r\nTake this semi-wild beast away from his wild haunts, give him food and\r\ncare, and he will double his gifts. Add a hundred generations of careful\r\nselection, until his form is so changed that it is beyond recognition,\r\nand again the product will be doubled. The spirit of swine is not\r\nchanged by civilization or good breeding; such as it was on that day\r\nwhen the herd \"ran down a steep place and was drowned in the sea,\" such\r\nit is to-day. A fixed determination to have its own way dominated the\r\ncreature then, and a pig-headed desire to be the greatest food-producing\r\nmachine in the world is its ruling passion now. That the hog has\r\nsucceeded in this is beyond question; for no other food animal can\r\nincrease its own weight one hundred and fifty fold in the first eight\r\nmonths of its life.\r\n\r\nAll over the world there is a growing fondness for swine flesh, and the\r\never increasing supply doesn't outrun the demand. Since the dispersion\r\nof the tribes of Israel there has been no persistent effort to\r\ndepopularize this wonderful food maker. Pig has more often been the food\r\nof the poor than of the rich, but now rich and poor alike do it honor.\r\nOld Ben Jonson said:--\r\n\r\n\"Now pig is meat, and a meat that is nourishing and may be desired, and\r\nconsequently eaten: it may be eaten; yea, very exceedingly well eaten.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds have praised the rasher of ham, and thousands the flitch of\r\nbacon; it took the stroke of but one pen to make roast pig classical.\r\n\r\nThe pig of to-day is so unlike his distant progenitor that he would not\r\nbe recognized; if by any chance he were recognized, it would be only\r\nwith a grunt of scorn for his unwieldy shape and his unenterprising\r\nspirit. Gone are the fleet legs, great head, bulky snout, terrible jaws,\r\nwarlike tusks, open nostrils, flapping ears, gaunt flanks, and racing\r\nsides; and with these has gone everything that told of strength,\r\nfreedom, and wild life. In their place has come a cuboidal mass, twice\r\nas long as it is broad or high, with a place in front for mouth and\r\neyes, and a foolish-looking leg under each corner. A mighty fall from\r\n\"freedom's lofty heights,\" but a wonderfully improved machine. The\r\nmodern hog is to his progenitor as the man with the steam-hammer to the\r\nman with the stone-hammer,--infinitely more useful, though not so free.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to overestimate the value of swine to the general farmer;\r\nbut to the factory farmer they are indispensable. They furnish a\r\nprofitable market for much that could not be sold, and they turn this\r\nwaste material into a surprising lot of money in a marvellously short\r\ntime. A pig should reach his market before he is nine months old. From\r\nthe time he is new-born until he is 250 days old, he should gain at\r\nleast one pound a day, which means five cents, in ordinary times.\r\nDuring this time he has eaten, of things which might possibly have been\r\nsold, perhaps five dollars' worth. At 250 days, with a gain of one pound\r\na day, he is worth, one year with another, $12.50. This is putting it\r\ntoo low for my market, but it gives a profit of not less than $6 a head\r\nafter paying freight and commissions. It is, then, only a question of\r\nhow many to keep and how to keep them. To answer the first half of this\r\nquestion I would say, Keep just as many as you can keep well. It never\r\npays to keep stock on half rations of food or care, and pigs are not\r\nexceptions. In answering the other half of the question, how to keep\r\nthem, I shall have to go into details of the first building of a piggery\r\nat Four Oaks.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the hens, I determined to start clean. Hogs had been\r\nkept on the farm for years, and, so far as I could learn, there had been\r\nno epizoötic disease. The swine had had free range most of the time, and\r\nthe specimens which I bought were healthy and as well grown as could be\r\nexpected. They were not what I wanted, either in breed or in\r\ndevelopment, so they had been disposed of, all but two. These I now\r\nconsigned to the tender care of the butcher, and ordered the sty in\r\nwhich they had been kept to be burned.\r\n\r\nI had planned to devote lot No. 2 to a piggery. There are five acres in\r\nthis lot, and I thought it large enough to keep four or five hundred\r\npigs of all sizes in good health and good condition for forcing. Some of\r\nthe swine, not intended for market, would have more liberty; but close\r\nconfinement in clean pens and small runs was to be the rule. To crowd\r\nhogs in this way, and at the same time to keep them free from disease,\r\nwould require special vigilance. The ordinary diseases that come from\r\ndamp and draughts could be fended off by carefully constructed\r\nbuildings. Cleanliness and wholesome food ought to do much, and\r\nisolation should accomplish the rest. I have established a perfect\r\nquarantine about my hog lot, and it has never been broken. After the\r\nfirst invoices of swine in the winter and spring of 1896, no hog, young\r\nor old, has entered my piggery, save by the way of a sixty-day\r\nquarantine in the wood lot, and very few by that way.\r\n\r\nMy pigs are several hundred yards from the public roads, and my\r\nneighbor, Jackson, has planted a young orchard on his land to the north\r\nof my hog lots, and permits no hogs in this planting. I have thus\r\nsecured practical isolation. I have rarely sent swine to fairs or stock\r\nshows. In the few instances in which I have broken this rule I have sold\r\nthe stock shown, never returning it to Four Oaks.\r\n\r\nIsolation, cleanliness, good food, good water, and a constant supply of\r\nashes, charcoal, and salt, have kept my herd (thus far) from those\r\ndreadfully fatal diseases that destroy so many swine. If I can keep the\r\nspecific micro-organism that causes hog-cholera off my place, I need not\r\nfear the disease. The same is true of swine plague. These diseases are\r\nof bacterial origin, and are communicated by the transference of\r\nbacteria from the infected to the non-infected. I propose to keep my\r\nhealthy herd as far removed as possible from all sources of infection. I\r\nhave carried these precautions so far that I am often scoffed at. I\r\nrequire my swineherd, when returning from a fair or a stock show, to\r\ntake a full bath and to disinfect his clothing before stepping into the\r\npig-house. This may seem an unnecessary refinement in precautionary\r\nmeasures, but I do not think so. It has served me well: no case of\r\ncholera or plague has shown itself at Four Oaks.\r\n\r\nWhat would I do if disease should appear? I do not know. I think,\r\nhowever, that I should fight it as hard as possible at close quarters,\r\nkilling the seriously ill, and burning all bodies. After the scourge had\r\npassed I would dispose of all stock as best I could, and then burn the\r\nentire plant (fences and all), plough deep, cover the land white as snow\r\nwith lime, leave it until spring, plough again, and sow to oats. During\r\nthe following summer I would rebuild my plant and start afresh. A whole\r\nyear would be lost, and some good buildings, but I think it would pay in\r\nthe end. There would be no safety for the herd while a single colony of\r\ncholera or plague bacteria was harbored on the place; and while neither\r\nmight, for years, appear in virulent form, yet there would be constant\r\nsmall losses and constant anxiety. One cannot afford either of these\r\nannoyances, and it is usually wise to take radical measures. If we apply\r\nsound business rules to farm management, we shall at least deserve\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI chose to keep thoroughbred swine for the reason that all the standard\r\nvarieties are reasonably certain to breed true to a type which, in each\r\nbreed, is as near pork-making perfection as the widest experience can\r\nmake it. Most of our good hogs are bred from English or Chinese stock.\r\nModifications by climate, care, crossing, and wise selection have\r\nprocured a number of excellent varieties, which are distinct enough to\r\nwarrant separate names, but which are nearly equal as pork-makers.\r\n\r\nIn color one could choose between black, black and white, and white and\r\nred. I wanted white swine; not because they are better than swine of\r\nother colors, for I do not think they are, but for æsthetic reasons. My\r\npoultry was to be white, and white predominated in my cows; why should\r\nnot my swine be white also,--or as white as their habits would permit? I\r\nam told on all sides that the black hog is the hardiest, that it fattens\r\neasier, and that for these reasons it is a better all-round hog. This\r\nmay be true, but I am content with my white ones. When some neighbor\r\ntakes a better bunch of hogs to market, or gets a better price for them,\r\nthan I do, I may be persuaded to think as he talks. Thus far I have sold\r\nclose to the top of the market, and my hogs are never left over.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my hogs eat more than those of my neighbors. I hope they do, for\r\nthey weigh more, on a \"weight for age\" scale, and I do not think they\r\nare \"air crammed,\" for \"you cannot fatten capons so.\" I am more than\r\nsatisfied with my Chester Whites. They have given me a fine profit each\r\nyear, and I should be ungrateful if I did not speak them fair.\r\n\r\nI wished to get the hog industry started on a liberal scale, and scoured\r\nthe country, by letter, for the necessary animals. I found it difficult\r\nto get just what I wanted. Perhaps I wanted too much. This is what I\r\nasked for: A registered young sow due to farrow her second litter in\r\nMarch or April. By dint of much correspondence and a considerable outlay\r\nof money, I finally secured nineteen animals that answered the\r\nrequirements. I got them in twos and threes from scattered sources, and\r\nthey cost an average price of $31 per head delivered at Four Oaks. A\r\nyoung boar, bred in the purple, cost $27. My foundation herd of Chester\r\nWhites thus cost me $614,--too much for an economical start; but, again,\r\nI was in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThe hogs began to arrive in February, and were put into temporary\r\nquarters pending the building of the house for the brood sows, which\r\nhouse must now be described.\r\n\r\nIt was a low building, 150 by 30 feet, divided by a six-foot alley-way\r\ninto halves, each 150 by 12 feet. Each of these halves was again divided\r\ninto fifteen pens 10 by 12 feet, with a 10 by 30 run for each pen. This\r\nwas the general plan for the brood-house for thirty sows. At the east\r\nend of this house was a room 15 by 30 feet for cooking food and storing\r\nsupplies for a few days. The building was of wood with plank floors. It\r\nstands there yet, and has answered its purpose; but it was never quite\r\nsatisfactory. I wanted cement floors and a more sightly building. I\r\nshall probably replace it next year. When it was built the weather was\r\nunfavorable for laying cement, and I did not wish to wait for a more\r\nclement season. The house and the fences for the runs cost $2100.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March Thompson called me to one of the temporary pens and\r\nshowed me a family of the prettiest new-born animals in the world,--a\r\nfine litter of no less than nine new-farrowed pigs. I felt that the\r\nfourth industry was fairly launched, and that we could now work and\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch was unusually raw even for that uncooked month. The sun had to\r\ncross the line before it could make much impression on the deep frost.\r\nAfter the 15th, however, we began to find evidences that things were\r\nstirring below ground. The red and yellow willows took on brighter\r\ncolors, the bark of the dogwood assumed a higher tone, and the catkins\r\nand lilac buds began to swell with the pride of new sap.\r\n\r\nIf our old orchard was to be pruned while dormant, it must be done at\r\nonce. Thompson and I spent five days of hard work among the trees,\r\ncutting out all dead limbs, crossing branches, and suckers. We called\r\nthe orchard old, but it was so only by comparison, for it was not out of\r\nits teens; and I did not wish to deal harshly with it. A good many\r\nunusual things were being done for it in a short time, and it was not\r\nwise to carry any one of them too far. It had been fertilized and\r\nploughed in the fall, and now it was to be pruned and sprayed,--all\r\ninnovations. The trees were well grown and thrifty. They had given a\r\nfair crop of fruit last year, and they were well worth considerable\r\nattention. They could not hereafter be cultivated, for they were all in\r\nthe soiling lot for the cows, but they could be pruned and sprayed. The\r\nlack of cultivation would be compensated by the fertilization incident\r\nto a feeding lot. The trees would give shade and comfort to the cows,\r\nwhile the cows fed and nourished the trees,--a fair exchange.\r\n\r\nThe crop of the year before, though half the apples were stung, had\r\nbrought nearly $300. With better care, and consequently better fruit, we\r\ncould count on still better results, for the varieties were excellent\r\n(Baldwins, Jonathans, and Rome Beauties); so we trimmed carefully and\r\nburned the rubbish. This precaution, especially in the case of dead\r\nlimbs, is important, for most dead wood in young trees is due to\r\ndisease, often infectious, and should be burned at once.\r\n\r\nI bought a spraying-pump (for $13), which was fitted to a sound oil\r\nbarrel, and we were ready to make the first attack on fungus disease\r\nwith the Bordeaux mixture. This was done by Johnson and Anderson late in\r\nthe month. Another vigorous spraying with the same mixture when the buds\r\nwere swelling, another when the flower petals were falling, and still\r\nanother when the fruit was as large as peas (the last two sprayings had\r\nParis green added to the Bordeaux mixture), and the fight against apple\r\nenemies was ended for that year.\r\n\r\nThompson had gone for the cows. He left March 9, and returned with the\r\nbeauties on Friday the 17th. They were all my fancy had painted\r\nthem,--large, gentle-eyed, with black and white hair over soft\r\nbutter-yellow skin, and all the points that distinguish these marvellous\r\nmilk-machines. They were bestowed as needs must until the cow barn was\r\ncompleted. One of them had dropped a bull calf two days before leaving\r\nthe home farm. The calf had been left, and the mother was in an\r\nuncomfortable condition, with a greatly distended udder and milk\r\nstreaming from her four teats, though Thompson had relieved her thrice\r\nwhile _en route_.\r\n\r\nI was greatly pleased with the cows, but must not spend time on them\r\nnow, for things are happening in my factory faster than I can tell of\r\nthem. Johnson had built some primitive hotbeds for early vegetables out\r\nof old lumber and oiled muslin. He had filled them with refuse from the\r\nhorse stable and had sown his seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST HATCH\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 3 the incubator lamps were lighted under the first invoice\r\nof one thousand eggs. The incubating cellar was to Sam's liking, and he\r\nfelt confident that three weeks of strict attention to temperature,\r\nmoisture, and the turning of eggs, would bring results beyond my\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nAfter the seventh day, on which he had tested or candled the eggs, he\r\nwas willing to promise almost anything in the way of a hatch, up to\r\nseventy-five or eighty per cent. In the intervals of attendance on the\r\nincubators he was hard at work on the brooder-house, which must be ready\r\nfor its first occupants by the 25th. Everything went smoothly until the\r\n18th. That morning Sam met me with a long face.\r\n\r\n\"Something went wrong with one of my lamps last night,\" said he. \"I\r\nlooked at them at ten o'clock and they were all right, but at six this\r\nmorning one of the thermometers was registering 122°, and the whole\r\nbatch was cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the whole thousand, Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but 170 fertile eggs, and that spoils a twenty-dollar bill and a\r\nlot of good time. What in the name of the black man ever got into that\r\nlamp of mine is more than I know. It's just my luck!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's everybody's luck who tries to raise chickens by wholesale, and we\r\nmust copper it. Don't be downed by the first accident, Sam; keep\r\nfighting and you'll win out.\"\r\n\r\nThe brooder-house was ready when the first chicks picked the shells on\r\nthe 24th, and within thirty-six hours we had 503 little white balls of\r\nfluff to transfer from the four incubators to the brooder-house. We put\r\nabout a hundred together in each of five brooders, fed them cut oats and\r\nwheat with a little coarse corn meal and all the fresh milk they could\r\ndrink, and they throve mightily.\r\n\r\nThe incubators were filled again on the 26th, and from that hatch we got\r\n552 chicks. On the 21st of March they were again filled, and on the 13th\r\nof April we had 477 more to add to the colony in the brooder-house. For\r\nthe last time we started the lamps April 15th, and on the 6th of May we\r\nclosed the incubating cellar and found that 2109 chicks had been hatched\r\nfrom the 4000 eggs. The last hatch was the best of all, giving 607. I\r\ndon't think we have ever had as good results since, though to tell the\r\ntruth I have not attempted to keep an exact count of eggs incubated. My\r\nopinion is that fifty per cent is a very good average hatch, and that\r\none should not expect more.\r\n\r\nIn September, when the young birds were separated, the census report was\r\n723 pullets and 764 cockerels, showing an infant mortality of 622, or\r\ntwenty-nine per cent. The accidents and vicissitudes of early\r\nchickenhood are serious matters to the unmothered chick, and they must\r\nnot be overlooked by the breeder who figures his profits on paper.\r\n\r\nAfter the first year I kept no tabs on the chickens hatched; my desire\r\nwas to add each year 600 pullets to my flock, and after the third season\r\nto dispose of as many hens. It doesn't pay to keep hens that are more\r\nthan two and a half years old. I have kept from 1200 to 1600 laying hens\r\nfor the past six years. I do not know what it costs to feed one or all\r\nof them, but I do know what moneys I have received for eggs, young\r\ncockerels, and old hens, and I am satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere is a big profit in keeping hens for eggs if the conditions are\r\nright and the industry is followed, in a businesslike way, in connection\r\nwith other lines of business; that is, in a factory farm. If one had to\r\ndevote his whole time to the care of his plant, and were obliged to buy\r\nalmost every morsel of food which the fowls ate, and if his market were\r\ndistant and not of the best, I doubt of great success; but with food at\r\nthe lowest and product at the highest, you cannot help making good\r\nmoney. I do not think I have paid for food used for my fowls in any one\r\nyear more than $500; grits, shells, meat meal, and oil meal will cover\r\nthe list. I do not wish to induce any man or woman to enter this\r\nbusiness on account of the glowing statements which these pages contain.\r\nI am ideally situated. I am near one of the best markets for fine food;\r\nI can sell all the eggs my hens will lay at high prices; food costs the\r\nminimum, for it comes from my own farm; I utilize skim-milk, the\r\nby-product from another profitable industry, to great advantage; and I\r\nhad enough money to carry me safely to the time of product. In other\r\nwords, I could build my factory before I needed to look to it for\r\nrevenue. I do not claim that this is the only way, but I do claim that\r\nit is the way for the fore-handed middle-aged man who wishes to change\r\nfrom city to country life without financial loss. Younger people with\r\nless means can accomplish the same results, but they must offset money\r\nby time. The principle of the factory farm will hold as well with the\r\none as with the other.\r\n\r\nTo intensify farming is the only way to get the fat of the land. The\r\nnations of the old world have nearly reached their limit in food\r\nproduction. They are purchasers in the open market. This country must be\r\nthat market; and it behooves us to look to it that the market be well\r\nstocked. There is land enough now and to spare, but will it be so fifty\r\nor a hundred years hence? Our arid lands will be made fertile by\r\nirrigation, but they will add only a small percentage to the amount\r\nalready in quasi-cultivation. Our future food supplies must be drawn\r\nlargely from the six million farms now under fences. These farms must be\r\nmade to yield fourfold their present product, or they will fall short,\r\nnot only of the demands made upon them, but also of their possibilities.\r\nThat is why I preach the gospel of intensive farming, for grain, hay,\r\nmarket, and factory farm alike.\r\n\r\nI will put the chickens out of the way for the present, referring to\r\nthem from time to time and indicating their general management, the cost\r\nof their houses and food, and the amount of money received for eggs and\r\nfowls. I do not think my plant would win the approval of fanciers, and\r\nit is not in all ways up to date; but it is clean, healthy, and\r\ncommodious, and the birds attend as strictly to business as a reasonable\r\nowner could wish. I shall be glad to show it to any one interested\r\nenough to search it out, and to go into the details of the business and\r\nshow how I have been able to make it so remunerative.\r\n\r\nSam is with me no longer. For three years he did good service and saved\r\nmoney, and the lurid nose grew dim. There is, however, a limit to human\r\nendurance. Like victims of other forms of circular insanity, the\r\ndipsomaniac completes his cycle in an uncertain period and falls upon\r\nbad times. For a month before we parted company I saw signs of relapse\r\nin Sam. He was loquacious at times, at other times morose. He talked\r\nabout going into business for himself, and his nose took on new color. I\r\nlabored with him, but to no purpose; the spirit of unrest was upon him,\r\nand it had to work its own. I held him firm long enough to secure\r\nanother man, and then we parted, he to do business for himself, I to get\r\non as best I could. Sam painted his nose and raised chickens and other\r\nthings until his savings had flown; then he got a position with a woman\r\nwho runs a broiler plant, and for two years he has given good service.\r\nHe will probably continue in ways of well-doing until the next cycle is\r\ncomplete, when the beacon light will blaze afresh and he will follow it\r\non to the rocks. Such a man is more to be pitied than condemned, for his\r\nanchor is sure to drag at times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE HOLSTEIN MILK MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the month of March the teams hauled more gravel. They also\r\ndistributed the manure that had been purchased in the fall for mulching\r\nthe trees. While the ground was still frozen this mulch was placed near\r\nthe trees, to be used as soon as the sun had warmed the earth. The mound\r\nof dirt at the base of each tree was of course levelled down before this\r\ndressing was applied. I never afterward purchased stable or stock-yard\r\nmanure, though I could often have used it to advantage; for I did not\r\nthink it safe to purchase this kind of fertilizer for a farm where large\r\nnumbers of animals are kept. The danger from infection is too great.\r\nLarge quantities of barnyard manure were furnished yearly out of my own\r\npits, and I supplemented it with a good deal of the commercial variety.\r\nI try to turn back to the land each year more than I take from it, but I\r\ndo not dare to go to a stock-yard for any part of my supply. It was not\r\nuntil I had mentally established a quarantine for my hogs that I\r\nrealized the danger from those six carloads of manure; and I promised\r\nmyself then that no such breach of quarantine should again occur.\r\n\r\nThe cows arrived on St. Patrick's Day. Our herd was then composed of the\r\ntwenty Holstein heifers (coming three years old), and six of the best of\r\nthe common cows purchased with the farm. Within forty days the herd was\r\nincreased by the addition of twenty-three calves. Twenty-five were born,\r\nbut two were dead. Of this number, eighteen were Holsteins eligible for\r\nregistration, ten heifers, and eight bulls. Each calf was taken from its\r\nmother on the third day and fed warm skim-milk from a patent feeder\r\nthree times a day, all it would drink. When three weeks old, seven of\r\nthe Holstein calves and the five from the common cows were sent to\r\nmarket. They brought $5.25 each above the expense of selling, or $63 for\r\nthe bunch. The ten Holstein heifer calves were of course held; and one\r\nbull calf, which had a double cross of Pieterje 2d and Pauline Paul, and\r\nwhich seemed an unusually fair specimen, was kept for further\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe cow barn was finished about April 1st, and shortly after that the\r\nherd was established in permanent quarters. As the dairy-house was\r\nunfinished, and there was no convenient way of disposing of the milk\r\nwhich now flowed in abundance, I bought a separator (for $200) and sent\r\nthe cream to a factory, using the fresh skim-milk for the calves and\r\nyoung pigs and chickens.\r\n\r\nFrom March 22, when I began to sell, until May 10, when my dairy-house\r\nwas in working order, I received $203 for cream. Thompson had sold milk\r\nfrom the old cows, from August to December, 1895, to the amount of $132.\r\nThis item should have been entered on the credit side for the last year,\r\nbut as it was not, we will make a note of it here. These are the only\r\nsales of milk and cream made from Four Oaks since I bought the land.\r\n\r\nThe milk supply from my herd started out at a tremendous rate,\r\nconsidering the age of the cows. It must be borne in mind that none of\r\nthe thoroughbreds was within three years of her (probable) best; yet\r\nthey were doing nobly, one going as high as fifty-two pounds of milk in\r\none day, and none falling below thirty-six as a maximum. The common cows\r\ndid nearly as well at first, four of them giving a maximum of thirty-two\r\npounds each in twenty-four hours. It was easy to see the difference\r\nbetween the two sorts, however. The old ones had reached maturity and\r\nwere doing the best they could; the others were just beginning to\r\nmanufacture milk, and were building and regulating their machinery for\r\nthat purpose. The Holsteins, though young, were much larger than the old\r\ncows, and were enormous feeders. A third or a half more food passed\r\ntheir great, coarse mouths than their less aristocratic neighbors could\r\nbe coaxed to eat. Food, of course, is the one thing that will make\r\nmilk; other things being equal, then the cow that consumes the most food\r\nwill produce the most milk. This is the secret of the Holsteins'\r\nwonderful capacity for assimilating enormous quantities of food without\r\nretaining it under their hides in the shape of fat. They have been bred\r\nfor centuries with the milk product in view, and they have become\r\nnotable machines for that purpose. They are not the cows for people to\r\nkeep who have to buy feed in a high market, for they are not easy\r\nkeepers in any sense; but for the farmer who raises a lot of grain and\r\nroughage which should be fed at his own door, they are ideal. They will\r\neat much and return much.\r\n\r\nAs to feeding for milk, I have followed nearly the same plan through my\r\nwhole experiment. I keep an abundance of roughage, usually shredded\r\ncorn, before the cows all the time. When it has been picked over\r\nmoderately well, it is thrown out for bedding, and fresh fodder is put\r\nin its place. The finer forages, timothy, red-top, clover, alfalfa, and\r\noat straw, are always cut fine, wetted, and mixed with grain before\r\nfeeding. This food is given three times a day in such quantities as will\r\nbe eaten in forty-five minutes. Green forage takes the place of dry in\r\nseason, and fresh vegetables are served three times a week in winter.\r\nThe grain ration is about as follows: By weight, corn and cob meal,\r\nthree parts; oatmeal, three parts; bran, three parts; gluten meal, two\r\nparts; linseed meal, one part. The cash outlay for a ton of this mixture\r\nis about $12; this price, of course, does not include corn and oats,\r\nfurnished by the farm. A Holstein cow can digest fifteen pounds of this\r\ngrain a day. This means about two and a half tons a year, with a cash\r\noutlay of $30 per annum for each head. Fresh water is always given four\r\ntimes a day, and much of the time the cows have ready access to it. In\r\ncold weather the water is warmed to about 65° F. The cows are let out in\r\na twenty-acre field for exercise every day, except in case of severe\r\nstorms. They are fed forage in the open when the weather is fine and\r\ninsects are not troublesome, and they sometimes sleep in the open on hot\r\nnights; but by far the largest part of their time is spent in their own\r\nstalls away from chilling winds and biting flies. In their stables they\r\nare treated much as fine horses are,--well bedded, well groomed, and\r\nwell cared for in all ways.\r\n\r\nA quiet, darkened stable conduces rumination. Loud talking, shouting, or\r\nlaughing are not looked upon with favor in our cow barn. On the other\r\nhand, continuous sounds, if at all melodious, seem to soothe the animals\r\nand increase the milk flow. Judson, who has proved to be our best\r\nherdsman, has a low croon in his mouth all the time. It can hardly be\r\ncalled a tune, though I believe he has faith in it, but it has a\r\nfetching way with the herd. I have never known him to be quick, sharp,\r\nor loud with the cows. When things go wrong, the crooning ceases. When\r\nit is resumed, all is well in the cow world. The other man, French, who\r\nis an excellent milker, and who stands well with the cows, has a half\r\nhiss, half whistle, such as English stable-boys use, except that it runs\r\nup and down five notes and is lost at each end. The cows like it and\r\nseem to admire French for his accomplishment even more than Judson, for\r\nthey follow his movements with evident pleasure expressed in their great\r\nox eyes.\r\n\r\nRigid rules of cleanliness are carried out in every detail with the\r\ngreatest exactness. The house and the animals are cared for all the time\r\nas if on inspection. Before milking, the udders are carefully brushed\r\nand washed, and the milker covers himself entirely with a clean apron.\r\nAs each cow is milked, the milker hangs the pail on a spring balance and\r\nregisters the exact weight on a blackboard. He then carries the milk\r\nthrough the door that leads to the dairy-house, and pours it into a tank\r\non wheels. This ends his responsibility. The dairymaid is then in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRYMAID\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course I had trouble in getting a dairymaid. I was not looking for\r\nthe bouncing, buxom, red-cheeked, arms-akimbo, butter-colored-hair sort.\r\nI didn't care whether she were red-cheeked and bouncing or not, but for\r\nobvious reasons I didn't want her hair to be butter-colored. What I did\r\nwant was a woman who understood creamery processes, and who could and\r\nwould make the very giltest of gilt-edged butter.\r\n\r\nI commenced looking for my paragon in January. I interviewed applicants\r\nof both sexes and all nationalities, but there was none perfect; no, not\r\none. I was not exactly discouraged, but I certainly began to grow\r\nanxious as the time approached when I should need my dairymaid, and need\r\nher badly. One day, while looking over the _Rural New Yorker_ (I was\r\nweaned on that paper), I saw the following advertisement. \"Wanted:\r\nEmployment on a dairy-farm by a married couple who understand the\r\nbusiness.\" If this were true, these two persons were just what I needed;\r\nbut, was it true? I had tried a score of greater promise and had not\r\nfound one that would do. Was I to flush two at once, and would they\r\nfall to my gun?\r\n\r\nA small town in one of the Middle Western states was given as the\r\naddress, and I wrote at once. My letter was strong in requirements, and\r\nasked for particulars as to experience, age, references, and\r\nnationality. The reply came promptly, and was more to my liking than any\r\nI had received before. Name, French; Americans, newly married,\r\ntwenty-eight and twenty-six respectively; experience four and three\r\nyears in creamery and dairy work; references, good; the couple wished to\r\nwork together to save money to start a dairy of their own. I was pleased\r\nwith the letter, which was an unusual one to come from native-born\r\nAmericans. Our people do not often hunt in couples after this manner. I\r\ntelegraphed them to come to the city at once.\r\n\r\nIt was late in April when I first saw the Frenches. The man was tall and\r\nraw-boned, but good-looking, with a frank manner that inspired\r\nconfidence. He was a farmer's son with a fair education, who had saved a\r\nlittle money, and had married his wife out of hand lest some one else\r\nshould carry her off while he was building the nest for her.\r\n\r\n\"I took her when I could get her,\" he said, \"and would have done it with\r\na two-dollar bill in my pocket rather than have taken chances.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman was worthy of such an extreme measure, for she looked capable\r\nof caring for both. She was a fine pattern of a country girl, with a\r\nhead full of good sense, and very useful-looking hands and arms. Her\r\nface was good to look upon; it showed strength of character and a\r\ndefinite object in life. She said she understood the creamery processes\r\nin all their niceties, and that she could make butter good enough for\r\nQueen Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe proposition offered by this young couple was by far the best I had\r\nreceived, and I closed with them at once. I agreed to pay each $25 a\r\nmonth to start with, and explained my plan of an increasing wage of $1 a\r\nmonth for each period of six months' service. They thought they ought to\r\nhave $30 level. I thought so, too, if they were as good as they\r\npromised. But I had a fondness for my increasing scale, and I held to\r\nit. These people were skilled laborers, and were worth more to begin\r\nwith than ordinary farm hands. That is why I gave them $25 a month from\r\nthe start. Six hundred dollars a year for a man and wife, with no\r\nexpense except for clothing, is good pay. They can easily put away $400\r\nout of it, and it doesn't take long to get fore-handed. I think the\r\nFrenches have invested $500 a year, on an average, since they came to\r\nFour Oaks.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to get at the dairy-house, since the dairy and the\r\ndairymaid are both in evidence. The house was to be on the building\r\nline, and both Polly and I thought it should have attractive features.\r\nWe decided to make it of dark red paving brick. It was to be eighteen\r\nfeet by thirty, with two rooms on the ground. The first, or south room,\r\nten feet by eighteen, was fitted for storing fruit, and afforded a\r\nstairway to the rooms above, which were four in number besides the bath.\r\nThe larger room was of course the butter factory, and was equipped with\r\nup-to-date appliances,--aërator, Pasteurizer, cooler, separator, Babcock\r\ntester, swing churn, butter-worker, and so on. The house was to have\r\nsteep gables and projecting eaves, with a window in each gable, and two\r\ndormer windows in each roof. The walls were to be plastered, and the\r\nground floor was to be cement. It cost $1375.\r\n\r\nAs motive power for the churn and separator, a two-sheep-power treadmill\r\nhas proved entirely satisfactory. It is worked by two sturdy wethers who\r\nare harbored in a pleasant house and run, close to the power-house, and\r\nwho pay for their food by the sweat of their brows and the wool from\r\ntheir backs. They do not appear to dislike the \"demnition grind,\" which\r\nlasts but an hour twice a day; they go without reluctance to the tramp\r\nthat leads nowhere, and the futile journey which would seem foolish to\r\nanything wiser than a sheep. This sheep-power is one of the curios of\r\nthe place. My grand-girls never lose their interest in it, and it has\r\nbeen photographed and sketched more times than there are fingers and\r\ntoes on the sheep.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure for equipment, from separator to sheep, was $354. I\r\nmade an arrangement with a fancy grocer in the city to furnish him\r\nthirty pounds, more or less, of fresh (unsalted) butter, six days in the\r\nweek, at thirty-three cents a pound, I to pay express charges. I bought\r\nsix butter-carriers with ice compartments for $3.75 each, $23 in all,\r\nand arranged with the express company to deliver my packages to the\r\ngrocer for thirty cents each. The butter netted me thirty-two cents a\r\npound that year, or about $60 a week.\r\n\r\nIn July I bought four thoroughbred Holsteins, four years old, in fresh\r\nmilk, and in October, six more, at an average price of $120 a\r\nhead,--$1200 in all. These reënforcements made it possible for me to\r\nkeep my contract with the middleman, and often to exceed it.\r\n\r\nThe dairy industry was now fairly launched and in working order. It had\r\ncost, not to be exact, $7000, and it was reasonably sure to bring back\r\nto the farm about $60 a week in cash, besides furnishing butter for the\r\nfamily and an immense amount of skim-milk and butter-milk to feed to the\r\nyoung animals on the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nLITTLE PIGS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy April 1st all my sows had farrowed. There was much variation in the\r\nnumber of pigs in these nineteen litters. One noble mother gave me\r\nthirteen, two of which promptly died. Three others farrowed eleven each,\r\nand so down to one ungrateful mother who contributed but five to the\r\nindustry at Four Oaks. The average, however, was good; 154 pigs on April\r\n10th were all that a halfway reasonable factory man could expect.\r\n\r\nThese youngsters were left with their mothers until eight weeks old;\r\nthen they were put, in bunches of thirty, into the real hog-house, which\r\nwas by that time completed. It was 200 feet long and 50 feet wide, with\r\na 10-foot passageway through the length of it. On either side were 10\r\npens 20 feet by 20, each connected with a run 20 feet by 120. The house\r\nstood on a platform or bed of cement 90 by 200 feet, which formed the\r\nfloor of the house and extended 20 feet outside of each wall, to secure\r\ncleanliness and a dry feeding-place in the open. The cement floor was\r\nexpensive ($1120 as first cost), but I think it has paid for itself\r\nseveral times over in health and comfort to the herd. The structure on\r\nthis floor was of the simplest; a double wall only five feet high at the\r\nsides, shingled roof, broken at the ridge to admit windows, and strong\r\npartitions. It cost $3100. As in the brood-sow house, there is a kitchen\r\nat the west end. The 150 little pigs made but a small showing in this\r\ngreat house, which was intended to shelter six hundred of all sizes,\r\nfrom the eight-weeks-old baby pig to the nine-months-old\r\nthree-hundred-pounder ready for market.\r\n\r\nPigs destined for market never leave this house until ripe for killing.\r\nAt six or seven months a few are chosen to remain on the farm and keep\r\nup its traditions; but the great number live their ephemeral lives of\r\neight months luxuriously, even opulently, until they have made the ham\r\nand bacon which, poor things, they cannot save, and then pass into the\r\npork barrel or the smoke-house without a sigh of regret. They toil not,\r\nneither do they spin; but they have a place in the world's economy, and\r\nthey fit it perfectly. So long as one animal must eat another, the man\r\nanimal should thank the hog animal for his generosity.\r\n\r\nNow that my big hog-house seemed so empty, I would gladly have sent into\r\nthe highways and byways to buy young stock to fill it; but I dared not\r\nbreak my quarantine. I could easily have picked up one hundred or even\r\ntwo hundred new-weaned pigs, within six or eight miles of my place, at\r\nabout $1.50 each, and they would have grown into fat profit by fall; but\r\nI would not take a risk that might bear ill fruit. I had slight\r\ndepressions of spirits when I visited my piggery during that summer; but\r\nI chirked up a little in the fall, when the brood sows again made good.\r\nBut more of that anon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nWORK ON THE HOME FORTY\r\n\r\n\r\nApril and May made amends for the rudeness of March, and the ploughs\r\nwere early afield. Thompson, Zeb, Johnson, and sometimes Anderson,\r\nfollowed the furrows, first in 10 and 11, and lastly in 13. Number 9 had\r\na fair clover sod, and was not disturbed. We ploughed in all about 114\r\nacres, but we did not subsoil. We spent twenty days ploughing and as\r\nmany more in fitting the ground for seed. The weather was unusually warm\r\nfor the season, and there was plenty of rain. By the middle of May, oats\r\nwere showing green in Nos. 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13,--sixty-two acres. The\r\ncorn was well planted in 15 and the west three-quarters of\r\n14,--eighty-two acres. The other ten acres in the young orchard was\r\nplanted to fodder corn, sown in drills so that it could be cultivated in\r\none direction.\r\n\r\nThe ten-acre orchard on the south side of the home lot was used for\r\npotatoes, sugar beets, cabbages, turnips, etc., to furnish a winter\r\nsupply of vegetables for the stock.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for alfalfa was not bright. In the early spring we\r\nfertilized it again, using five hundred pounds to the acre, though it\r\nseemed like a conspicuous waste. The warm rains and days of April and\r\nMay brought a fine crop of weeds; and about the middle of May I turned\r\nAnderson loose in the fields with a scythe, and he mowed down everything\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\nAfter that things soon began to look better in the alfalfa fields. As\r\nthe season was favorable, we were able to cut a crop of over a ton to\r\nthe acre early in July, and nearly as much in the latter part of August.\r\nWe cut forty tons from these twenty acres within a year from seeding,\r\nbut I suspect that was unusual luck. I had used thirteen hundred pounds\r\nof commercial fertilizer to the acre, and the season was very favorable\r\nfor the growth of the plant. I have since cut these fields three times\r\neach year, with an average yield of five tons to the acre for the whole\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nI like alfalfa, both as green and as dry forage. When we use it green,\r\nwe let it lie in swath for twenty-four hours, that it may wilt\r\nthoroughly before feeding. It is then fit food for hens, hogs, and, in\r\nlimited quantities, for cows, and is much relished. When used dry, it is\r\nalways cut fine and mixed with ground grains. In this shape it is fed\r\nliberally to hens and hogs, and also to milch cows; for the latter it\r\nforms half of the cut-food ration.\r\n\r\nWhile the crops are growing, we will find time to note the changes on\r\nthe home lot. Nearly in front of the farm-house, and fifty yards\r\ndistant, was a space well fitted for the kitchen garden. We marked off a\r\nplat two hundred feet by three hundred, about one and a half acres,\r\ncarted a lot of manure on it, and ploughed it as deep as the subsoiler\r\nwould reach. This was done as soon as the frost permitted. We expected\r\nthis garden to supply vegetables and small fruits for the whole colony\r\nat Four Oaks. An acre and a half can be made exceedingly productive if\r\nproperly managed.\r\n\r\nAlong the sides of this garden we planted two rows of currant and\r\ngooseberry bushes, six feet between rows, and the plants four feet apart\r\nin the rows. The ends of the plat were left open for convenience in\r\nhorse cultivation. Ten feet outside these rows of bush fruit was planted\r\na line of quince trees, thirty on each side, and twenty feet beyond\r\nthese a row of cherry trees, twenty in each row.\r\n\r\nNear the west boundary of the home lot, and north of the lane that\r\nenters it, I planted two acres of dwarf pear trees--Bartlett and\r\nDuchess,--three hundred trees to the acre. I also planted six hundred\r\nplum trees--Abundance, Wickson, and Gold--in the chicken runs on lot 4.\r\nAfter May 1, when he was relieved from his farm duties, Johnson had\r\ncharge of the planting and also of the gardening, and he took up his\r\nspecial work with energy and pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe drives on the home lot were slightly rounded with ploughs and\r\nscraper, and then covered with gravel. The open slope intended for the\r\nlawn was now to be treated. It comprised about ten acres, irregular in\r\nform and surface, and would require a good deal of work to whip it into\r\nshape. A lawn need not be perfectly graded,--in fact, natural\r\ninequalities with dips and rises are much more attractive; but we had to\r\ntake out the asperities. We ploughed it thoroughly, removed all stumps\r\nand stones, levelled and sloped it as much as pleased Polly, harrowed it\r\ntwice a week until late August, sowed it heavily to grass seed, rolled\r\nit, and left it.\r\n\r\nPolly had the house in her mind's eye. She held repeated conversations\r\nwith Nelson, and was as full of plans and secrets as she could hold. By\r\nagreement, she was to have a free hand to the extent of $15,000 for the\r\nhouse and the carriage barn. I never really examined the plans, though I\r\nsaw the blue prints of what appeared to be a large house with a driving\r\nentrance on the east and a great wide porch along the whole south side.\r\nI did not know until it was nearly finished how large, convenient, and\r\ncomfortable it was to be. A hall, a great living-room, the dining room,\r\na small reception room, and an office, bedroom, and bath for me, were\r\nall on the ground floor, besides a huge wing for the kitchen and other\r\nuseful offices.\r\n\r\nAbove stairs there was room for the family and a goodly number of\r\nfriends. We had agreed that the house should be simple in all ways, with\r\nno hard wood except floors, and no ornamentation except paint and paper.\r\nIt must be larger than our needs, for we looked forward to delightful\r\nvisits from many friends. We were to have more leisure than ever before\r\nfor social life, and we desired to make the most of our opportunities.\r\n\r\nA country house is by all odds the finest place to entertain friends and\r\nto be entertained by them. They come on invitation, not as a matter of\r\nform, and they stay long enough to put by questions of weather, clothes,\r\nand servant-girls, and to get right down to good old-fashioned visiting.\r\nReal heart-to-heart talks are everyday occurrences in country visits,\r\nwhile they are exceptional in city calls. We meant to make much of our\r\nfriends at Four Oaks, and to have them make much of us. We have\r\ndiscovered new values even in old friends, since we began to live with\r\nthem, weeks at a time, under the same roof. Their interests are ours,\r\nand our plans are warmly taken up by them. There is nothing like it\r\namong the turmoils and interruptions of town life, and the older we grow\r\nthe more we need this sort of rest among our friends. The guest book at\r\nthe farm will show very few weeks, in the past six years, when friends\r\nhaven't been with us, and Polly and I feel that the pleasure we have\r\nreceived from this source ought to be placed on the credit side of the\r\nfarm ledger.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for a company house was that Jack and Jane would shortly\r\nbe out of school. It was not at all in accord with our plan that they\r\nshould miss any pleasure by our change. Indeed, we hoped that the change\r\nwould be to their liking and to their advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nDISCOUNTING THE MARKET\r\n\r\n\r\nWe broke ground for the house late in May, and Nelson said that we\r\nshould be in it by Thanksgiving Day. Soon after the plans were settled\r\nPolly informed me that she should not spend much money on the stable.\r\n\r\n\"Can't do it,\" she said, \"and do what I ought to on the house. I will\r\ngive you room for six horses; the rest, if you have more, must go to the\r\nfarm barn. I cannot spend more than $1100 or $1200 on the barn.\"\r\n\r\nPolly was boss of this department, and I was content to let her have her\r\nway. She had already mulcted me to the extent of $436 for trees, plants,\r\nand shrubs which were even then grouped on the lawn after a fashion that\r\npleased her. I need not go into the details of the lawn planting, the\r\nflower garden, the pergola, and so forth. I have a suspicion that Polly\r\nhas in mind a full account of the \"fight for the home forty,\" in a form\r\ngreatly better than I could give it, and it is only fair that she should\r\ntell her own story. I am not the only one who admires her landscape, her\r\nflower gardens, and her woodcraft. Many others do honor to her tastes\r\nand to the evidence of thought which the home lot shows. She disclaims\r\ngreat credit, for she says, \"One has only to live with a place to find\r\nout what it needs.\"\r\n\r\nAs I look back to the beginning of my experiment, I see only one bit of\r\ngood luck that attended it. Building material was cheap during the\r\nmonths in which I had to build so much. Nothing else specially favored\r\nme, while in one respect my experiment was poorly timed. The price of\r\npork was unusually low. For three years, from 1896, the price of hogs\r\nnever reached $5 per hundred pounds in our market,--a thing\r\nunprecedented for thirty years. I never sold below three and a half\r\ncents, but the showing would have been wonderfully bettered could I have\r\nadded another cent or two per pound for all the pork I fattened. The\r\naverage price for the past twenty-five years is well above five cents a\r\npound for choice lots. Corn and all other foods were also cheap; but\r\nthis made little difference with me, because I was not a seller of\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 I was, however, a buyer of both corn and oats. In September of\r\nthat year corn sold on 'Change at 19-1/2 cents a bushel, and oats at\r\n14-3/4. These prices were so much below the food value of these grains\r\nthat I was tempted to buy. I sent a cash order to a commission house for\r\nfive thousand bushels of each. I stored this grain in my granary,\r\nagainst the time of need, at a total expense of $1850,--21 cents a\r\nbushel for corn and 16 for oats. I had storage room and to spare, and I\r\nknew that I could get more than a third of a cent out of each pound of\r\ncorn, and more than half a cent out of each pound of oats. I recalled\r\nthe story of a man named Joseph who did some corn business in Egypt a\r\ngood many years ago, much in this line, and who did well in the\r\ntransaction. There was no dream of fat kine in my case; but I knew\r\nsomething of the values of grains, and it did not take a reader of\r\nriddles to show me that when I could buy cheaper than I could raise, it\r\nwas a good time to purchase.\r\n\r\nAs I said once before, there have been no serious crop failures at Four\r\nOaks,--indeed, we can show better than an average yield each year; but\r\nthis extra corn in my cribs has given me confidence in following my plan\r\nof very liberal feeding. With this grain on hand I was able to cut\r\ntwenty acres of oats in Nos. 10 and 11 for forage. This was done when\r\nthe grain was in the milk, and I secured about sixty tons of excellent\r\nhay, much loved by horses. We got from No. 9 a little less than twelve\r\ntons of clover,--alfalfa furnished forty tons; and there was nearly\r\ntwenty tons of old hay left over from that originally purchased. With\r\nall this forage, good of its kind, there was, however, no timothy or red\r\ntop, which is by all odds the best hay for horses. I determined to\r\nremedy this lack before another year. As soon as the oats were off lots\r\n10 and 11, they were ploughed and crossed with the disk harrow. From\r\nthen until September 1, these fields were harrowed each week in half\r\nlap, so that by the time we were ready to seed them they were in\r\nexcellent condition and free from weeds. About September 1 they were\r\nsown to timothy and red top, fifteen pounds each to the acre,\r\ntop-dressed with five hundred pounds of fertilizer, harrowed once more,\r\nrolled, and left until spring, when another dose of fertilizer was used.\r\n\r\nI wished to establish twenty acres of timothy and as much alfalfa, to\r\nfurnish the hay supply for the farm. With one hundred tons of alfalfa\r\nand sixty of timothy, which I could reasonably expect, I could get on\r\nsplendidly.\r\n\r\nFrom the first I have practised feeding my hay crop for immediate\r\nreturns. The land receives five hundred pounds of fertilizer per acre\r\nwhen it is sown, a like amount again in the spring, and, as soon as a\r\ncrop is cut, three hundred pounds an acre more. This usually gives a\r\nsecond crop of timothy about September 1, if the season is at all\r\nfavorable. The alfalfa is cut at least three times, and for each cutting\r\nit receives three hundred pounds of plant food per acre. In the course\r\nof a year I spend from $10 to $12 an acre for my grass land. In return I\r\nget from each acre of timothy, in two cuttings, about three and a half\r\ntons; worth, at an average selling price, $12 a ton. The alfalfa yields\r\nnearly five tons per acre, and has a feeding value of $10 a ton. I have\r\nsold timothy hay a few times, but I feel half ashamed to say so, for it\r\nis against my view of justice to the land. I find oat hay cheaper to\r\nraise than timothy, and, as it is quite as well liked by the horses, I\r\nhave been tempted to turn a part of my timothy crop into money directly\r\nfrom the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nFROM CITY TO COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early July I went through my young orchard, which had been cut back\r\nso ruthlessly the previous autumn, and carefully planned a head for each\r\ntree. Quite a bunch of sprouts had started from near the top of each\r\nstub, and were growing luxuriantly. Out of each bunch I selected three\r\nor four to form the head; the rest were rubbed off or cut out with a\r\nsharp knife or pruning shears. It surprised me to see what a growth some\r\nof these sprouts had made; sixteen or eighteen inches was not uncommon.\r\nBig roots and big bodies were pushing great quantities of sap toward the\r\ntops.\r\n\r\nOf course I bought farm machinery during this first season,--mower,\r\nreaper, corn reaper, shredder, and so on. In October I took account of\r\nexpenditures for machinery, grass seed, and fertilizer, and found that I\r\nhad invested $833. I had also, at an expense of $850, built a large shed\r\nor tool-house for farm implements. It is one of the rules at Four Oaks\r\nto grease and house all tools when not in actual use. I believe the\r\nobservation of this rule has paid for the shed.\r\n\r\nIn October 1896 I had a good offer for my town house, and accepted it.\r\nI had purchased the property eleven years before for $22,000, but, as it\r\nwas in bad condition, I had at once spent $9000 on it and the stable. I\r\nsold it for $34,000, with the understanding that I could occupy it for\r\nthe balance of the year if I wished.\r\n\r\nAfter selling the house, I calculated the cost of the elementary\r\nnecessities, food and shelter, which I had been willing to pay during\r\nmany years of residence in the city. The record ran about like this:--\r\n\r\nInterest at 5% on house valued at $34,000   $1700.00\r\nYearly taxes on same                          340.00\r\nInsurance                                      80.00\r\nFuel and light                                250.00\r\nWages for one man and three women            1200.00\r\nStreet sprinkling, watchman, etc.              90.00\r\nFood, including water, ice, etc.             1550.00\r\n                                            ________\r\n     Making a total of                      $5210.00\r\n\r\nIt cost me $100 a week to shelter and feed my family in the city. This,\r\nof course, took no account of personal expenses,--travel, sight-seeing,\r\nclothing, books, gifts, or the thousand and one things which enter more\r\nor less prominently into the everyday life of the family.\r\n\r\nIf the farm was to furnish food and shelter for us in the future, it\r\nwould be no more than fair to credit it with some portion of this\r\nexpenditure, which was to cease when we left the city home. What portion\r\nof it could be justly credited to the farm was to be decided by\r\ncomparative comforts after a year of experience. I did not plan our\r\nexodus for the sake of economy, or because I found it necessary to\r\nretrench; our rate of living was no higher than we were willing and able\r\nto afford. Our object was to change occupation and mode of life without\r\nfinancial loss, and without moulting a single comfort. We wished to end\r\nour days close to the land, and we hoped to prove that this could be\r\ndone with both grace and profit. I had no desire to lose touch with the\r\ncity, and there was no necessity for doing so. Four Oaks is less than an\r\nhour from the heart of town. I could leave it, spend two or three hours\r\nin town, and be back in time for luncheon without special effort; and\r\nPolly would think nothing of a shopping trip and friends home with her\r\nto dinner. The people of Exeter were nearly all city people who were so\r\nfortunate as not to be slaves to long hours. They were rich by work or\r\nby inheritance, and they gracefully accepted the _otium cum dignitate_\r\nwhich this condition permitted. Social life was at its best in Exeter,\r\nand many of its people were old acquaintances of ours. A noted country\r\nclub spread its broad acres within two miles of our door, and I had been\r\nfavorably posted for membership. It did not look as though we should be\r\nthrust entirely upon our own resources in the country; but at the worst\r\nwe had resources within our own walls and fences that would fend off all\r\nbut the most violent attacks of ennui.\r\n\r\nWe were both keenly interested in the experiment. Nothing that happened\r\non the farm went unchallenged. The milk product for the day was a thing\r\nof interest; the egg count could not go unnoted; a hatch of chickens\r\nmust be seen before they left the incubator; a litter of new-born pigs\r\nmust be admired; horses and cows were forever doing things which they\r\nshould or should not do; men and maids had griefs and joys to share with\r\nmistress or Headman; flowers were blooming, trees were leafing, a robin\r\nhad built in the black oak, a gopher was tunnelling the rose bed,--a\r\nthousand things, full of interest, were happening every day. As a place\r\nwhere things the most unexpected do happen, recommend me to a quiet\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nBut we were not to depend entirely upon outside things for diversion.\r\nBooks we had galore, and we both loved them. Many a charming evening\r\nhave I spent, sometimes alone, more often with two or three congenial\r\nfriends, listening to Polly's reading. This is one of her most\r\ndelightful accomplishments. Her friends never tire of her voice, and her\r\nvoice never tires of her friends. We all grow lazy when she is about;\r\nbut there are worse things than indolence. No, we did not mean to drop\r\nout of anything worth while; but we were pretty well provisioned against\r\na siege, if inclement weather or some other accident should lock us up\r\nat the farm.\r\n\r\nTo keep still better hold of the city, I suggested to Tom and Kate that\r\nthey should keep open house for us, or any part of us, whenever we were\r\ninclined to take advantage of their hospitality. This would give us city\r\nrefuge after late functions of all sorts. The plan has worked admirably.\r\nI devote $1200 a year out of the $5200 of food-and-shelter money to the\r\nsupport of our city shelter at Kate's house, and the balance, $4000, is\r\nentered at the end of each year on the credit side of the farm ledger.\r\nNor do I think this in any way unjust. We do not expect to get things\r\nfor nothing, and we do not wish to. If the things we pay for now are as\r\nvaluable as those we paid for six or eight years ago, we ought not to\r\nfind fault with an equal price. I have repeatedly polled the family on\r\nthis question, and we all agree that we have lost nothing by the change,\r\nand that we have gained a great deal in several ways. Our friends are of\r\nlike opinion; and I am therefore justified in crediting Four Oaks with a\r\nconsiderable sum for food and shelter. We have bettered our condition\r\nwithout foregoing anything, and without increasing our expenses. That is\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nAUTUMN RECKONING\r\n\r\n\r\nWe harvested the crops in the autumn of 1896, and were thankful for the\r\nbountiful yield. Nearly sixteen hundred bushels of oats and twenty-seven\r\nhundred bushels of corn made a proud showing in the granary, when added\r\nto its previous stock. The corn fodder, shredded by our own men and\r\nmachine, made the great forage barn look like an overflowing cornucopia,\r\nand the only extra expense attending the harvest was $31 paid for\r\nthreshing the oats.\r\n\r\nThree important items of food are consumed on the farm that have to be\r\npurchased each year, and as there is not much fluctuation in the price\r\npaid, we may as well settle the per capita rate for the milch cows and\r\nhogs for once and all. At each year's end we can then easily find the\r\ncash outlay for the herds by multiplying the number of stock by the cost\r\nof keeping one.\r\n\r\nMy Holstein cows consume a trifle less than three tons of grain each per\r\nyear,--about fifteen pounds a day. Taking the ration for four cows as a\r\nmatter of convenience, we have: corn and cob meal, three tons, and\r\noatmeal, three tons, both kinds raised and ground on the farm, and not\r\ncharged in this account; wheat bran, three tons at $18, $54; gluten\r\nmeal, two tons at $24, $48; oil meal, one ton, $26; total cash outlay\r\nfor four cows, $128, or $32 per head. This estimate is, however, about\r\n$2 too liberal. We will, hereafter, charge each milch cow $30, and will\r\nalso charge each hog fattened on the place $1 for shorts and middlings\r\nconsumed. This is not exact, but it is near enough, and it greatly\r\nsimplifies accounts.\r\n\r\nAs I kept twenty-six cows ten months, and ten more for an average of\r\nfour and a half months, the feeding for 1896 would be equivalent to one\r\nyear for thirty cows, or $900. To this add $120 for swine food and $25\r\nfor grits and oyster shells for the chickens, and we have $1045 paid for\r\nfood for stock. Shoeing the horses for the year and repairs to machinery\r\ncost $157. The purchased food for eight employees for twelve months and\r\nfor two additional ones for eight months, amounted to $734. The wage\r\naccount, including $50 extra to Thompson, was $2358.\r\n\r\nA second hen-house, a duplicate of the first, was built before October.\r\nIt was intended that each house should accommodate four hundred laying\r\nhens. We have now on the place five of these houses; but only two of\r\nthem, besides the incubator and the brooder-house, were built in 1896.\r\nAs offset to the heavy expenditure of this year, I had not much to show.\r\nSeven hundred cockerels were sold in November for $342. In October the\r\npullets began laying in desultory fashion, and by November they had\r\nsettled down to business; and that quarter they gave me 703 dozen eggs\r\nto sell. As these eggs were marketed within twenty-four hours, and under\r\na guarantee, I had no difficulty in getting thirty cents a dozen, net.\r\nNovember eggs brought $211, and the December out-put, $252. I sold 600\r\nbushels of potatoes for $150, and the apples from 150 of the old trees\r\n(which, by the way, were greatly improved this year) brought $450 on the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe cows did well. In the thirty-three weeks from May 12 to December 31,\r\nI sold a little more than 6600 pounds of butter, which netted me $2127.\r\n\r\nWe had 122 young hogs to sell in December. They had been crowded as fast\r\nas possible to make good weight, and they went to market at an average\r\nof 290 pounds a head. The price was low, but I got the top of the\r\nmarket,--$3.55 a hundred, which amounted to $1170 after paying charges.\r\nI had reserved twenty-five of the most likely young sows to stay on the\r\nfarm, and had transferred eight to the village butcher, who was to\r\nreturn them in the shape of two barrels of salt pork, thirty-two smoked\r\nhams and shoulders, and a lot of bacon.\r\n\r\nThe old sows farrowed again in September and early October, and we went\r\ninto the winter with 162 young pigs. I get these details out of the way\r\nnow in order to turn to the family and the social side of life at Four\r\nOaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house did not progress as fast as Nelson had promised, and it was\r\nlikely to be well toward Christmas before we could occupy it. As the\r\ndays shortened, Polly and I found them crowded with interests. Life at\r\nFour Oaks was to mean such a radical change that we could not help\r\nspeculating about its influence upon us and upon the children. Would it\r\nbe satisfactory to us and to them? Or should we find after a year or two\r\nof experiment that we had been mistaken in believing that we could live\r\nhappier lives in the country than in town? A year and a half of outdoor\r\nlife and freedom from professional responsibilities had wrought a great\r\nchange in me. I could now eat and sleep like a hired man, and it seemed\r\npreposterous to claim that I was going to the country for my health. My\r\nmedical adviser, however, insisted that I had not gotten far enough away\r\nfrom the cause of my breakdown, and that it would be unwise for me to\r\ntake up work again for at least another year. In my own mind there was a\r\nfixed opinion that I should never take it up again. I loved it dearly;\r\nbut I had given long, hard service to it, and felt that I had earned the\r\nright to freedom from its exacting demands. I have never lost interest\r\nin this, the noblest of professions, but I had done my share, and was\r\nnow willing to watch the work of others. In my mind there was no doubt\r\nabout the desirability of the change. I have always loved the thought of\r\ncountry life, and now that my thoughts were taking material shape, I was\r\nkeen to push on. Polly looked toward the untrammelled life we hoped to\r\nlead with as great pleasure as I.\r\n\r\nBut how about the children? Would it appeal to them with the same force\r\nas to us? The children have thus far been kept in the background. I\r\nwanted to start my factory farm and to get through with most of its dull\r\ndetails before introducing them to the reader, lest I should be diverted\r\nfrom the business to the domestic, or social, proposition.\r\n\r\nThe farm is laid by for the winter, and most of the details needed for a\r\njust comprehension of our experiment have been given. From this time on\r\nwe will deal chiefly with results. We will watch the out-put from the\r\nfactory, and commend or find fault as the case may deserve.\r\n\r\nThe social side of life is quite as important as the commercial, for\r\nthough we gain money, if we lose happiness, what profit have we? Let us\r\nstudy the children to see what chances for happiness and good fellowship\r\nlie in them.\r\n\r\nKate is our first-born. She is a bright, beautiful woman of\r\nfive-and-twenty, who has had a husband these six years, one daughter for\r\nfour years, and, wonderful to relate, another daughter for two years.\r\nShe is quick and practical, with strong opinions of her own, prompt with\r\nadvice and just as prompt with aid; a woman with a temper, but a friend\r\nto tie to in time of stress. She has the education of a good school, and\r\nwhat is infinitely better, the cultivation of an observing mind. She is\r\nquick with tongue and pen, but her quickness is so tempered by\r\nunquestioned friendliness that it fastens people to her as with a cord.\r\nShe overflows with interests of every description, but she is never too\r\nbusy to listen sympathetically to a child or a friend. She is the\r\npractical member of the family, and we rarely do much out of the\r\nordinary without first talking it over with Kate.\r\n\r\nTom Hamilton, her husband, is a young man who is getting on in the\r\nworld. He is clever in his profession, and sure to succeed beyond the\r\nsuccess of most men. He is quiet in manner, but he seems to have a way\r\nof managing his quick, handsome wife, which is something of a surprise\r\nto me, and to her also, I fancy. They are congenial and happy, and their\r\nchildren are beings to adore. Tom and Kate are to live in town. They are\r\ntoo young for the joys of country life, and must needs drag on as they\r\nare, loved and admired by a host of friends. They can, and will,\r\nhowever, spend much time at Four Oaks; and I need not say they approved\r\nour plans.\r\n\r\nJack is our second. He was a junior at Yale, and I am shy of saying much\r\nabout him lest I be accused of partiality. Enough to say that he is\r\ntall, blond, handsome, and that he has gentle, winning ways that draw\r\nthe love of men and women. He is a dreamer of dreams, but he has a\r\nsturdy drop of Puritan blood in his veins that makes him strong in\r\nconviction and brave in action. Jack has never caused me an hour of\r\nanxiety, and I was ever proud to see him in any company.\r\n\r\nConcerning Jane, I must be pardoned in advance for a father's\r\nfavoritism. She is my youngest, and to me she seems all that a father\r\ncould wish. Of fair height and well moulded, her physique is perfect.\r\nGood health and a happy life had set the stamp of superb womanhood upon\r\nher eighteen years. Any effort to describe her would be vain and\r\nunsatisfactory. Suffice it to say that she is a pure blonde, with eyes,\r\nhair, and skin just to my liking. She is quiet and shy in manner,\r\ndeliberate in speech, sensitive beyond measure, wise in intuitive\r\njudgment, clever in history and literature, but always a little in doubt\r\nas to the result of putting seven and eight together, and not\r\nunreasonably dominated by the rules of orthography. She is fond of\r\noutdoor life, in love with horses and dogs, and withal very much of a\r\nhome girl. Every one makes much of Jane, and she is not spoiled, but\r\nrather improved by it. She was in her second year at Farmington, and,\r\nlike all Farmington students, she cared more for girls than for boys.\r\n\r\nThese were the children whom I was to transport from the city, where\r\nthey were born, to the quiet life at Four Oaks. After carefully taking\r\ntheir measures, I felt little hesitation about making the change. They,\r\nof course, had known of the plan, and had often been to the farm; but\r\nthey were still to find out what it really meant to live there. A saddle\r\nhorse and dogs galore would square me with Jane, beyond question; but\r\nwhat about Jack? Time must decide that. His plan of life was not yet\r\nformed, and we could afford to wait. We did not have much time in which\r\nto weigh these matters, for the Christmas holidays were near, and the\r\nyoungsters would soon be home. We planned to be settled in the new house\r\nwhen they arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE HOME-COMING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn arranging to move my establishment I was in a quandary as to what it\r\nwas best to do for a coachman. Lars had been with me fifteen years. He\r\ncame a green Swedish lad, developed into a first-class coachman, married\r\na nice girl--and for twelve years he and his wife lived happily in the\r\nrooms above my stable. Two boys were born to them, and these lads were\r\nnow ten and twelve years of age. Shortly after I bought the farm Lars\r\nwas so unfortunate as to lose his good wife, and he and the boys were\r\nleft forlorn. A relative came and gave them such care as she could, but\r\nthe mother and wife was missed beyond remedy. In his depression Lars\r\ntook to drink, and things began to go wrong in the stable. He was not\r\noften drunk, but he was much of the time under the influence of alcohol,\r\nand consequently not reliable. I had done my best for the poor fellow,\r\nand he took my lectures and chidings in the way they were intended, and,\r\nindeed, he tried hard to break loose from the one bad habit, but with no\r\ngood results. His evil friends had such strong hold on him that they\r\ncould and would lead him astray whenever there was opportunity. Polly\r\nand I had many talks about this matter. She was growing timid under his\r\ndriving, and yet she was attached to him for long and faithful service.\r\n\r\n\"Let's chance it,\" she said. \"If we get him away from these people who\r\nlead him astray, he may brace up and become a man again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about the boys, Polly?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to be able to find something for the boys to do on the farm,\r\nand they can go to school at Exeter. Can't they drive the butter-cart\r\nout each morning and home after school? They're smart chaps, you know,\r\nand used to doing things.\"\r\n\r\nPolly had found a way, and I was heartily glad of it, for I did not feel\r\nlike giving up my hold on the man and the boys. Lars was glad of the\r\nchance to make good again, and he willingly agreed to go. He was to\r\nreceive $23 a month. This was less than he was getting in the city, but\r\nit was the wage which we were paying that year at the farm, and he was\r\ncontent; for the boys were each to receive $5 a month, and to be sent to\r\nschool eight months a year for three years.\r\n\r\nThis matter arranged, we began to plan for the moving. I had five horses\r\nin my stable,--a span of blacks for the carriage and three single\r\ndrivers. Besides the horses, harness, and equipment, there was a large\r\ncarriage, a brougham, a Goddard phæton, a runabout, and a cart. I\r\nexchanged the brougham and the Goddard for a station wagon and a park\r\nphæton, as more suitable for country use.\r\n\r\nThe barn equipment was all sent in one caravan, Thompson and Zeb coming\r\ninto town to help Lars drive out. Our lares and penates were sent by\r\nfreight on December 17. Polly had managed to coax another thousand\r\ndollars out of me for things for the house; and these, with the\r\nfurniture from our old home, made a brave showing when we gathered\r\naround the big fire in the living room, December 22, for our first night\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nTom, Kate, and the grand-girls were with us to spend the holidays, and\r\nso, too, was the lady whom we call Laura. I shall not try to say much\r\nabout Laura. She was a somewhat recent friend. How we ever came to know\r\nher well, was half a mystery; and how we ever got on before we knew her\r\nwell, was a whole one.\r\n\r\nRoaring fires and shaded lamps gave an air of homelike grace to our new\r\nhouse, and we decided that we would never economize in either wood or\r\noil; they seemed to stir the home spirit more than ever did coal or\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe day had been a busy one for the ladies, but they were pleased with\r\nresults as they looked around the well-ordered house and saw the work of\r\ntheir hands. Before separating for the night, Kate said:--\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to town to-morrow, and I'll pick up Jane and Jack in time to\r\ntake the four o'clock train out. Papa will meet us at the station, and\r\nMomee will greet us at the doorstep. Make an illumination, Momee, and we\r\nwill carry them by storm. Tom will have to take a later train, but he\r\nwill be here in time for dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of the 23d, the children came, and there was no failure in\r\nKate's plan. The youngsters were delighted with everything. Jane said:--\r\n\r\n\"I always wanted to live on a farm. I can have a saddle horse now, and\r\nkeep as many dogs as I like, can't I, Dad?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have the horse, and the dogs, too, when you come to stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daddy,\" said Jack, \"this will be great for you. Let me finish at an\r\nagricultural college, so that I can be of some practical help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life, my son! What your daddy doesn't know about farming\r\nwouldn't spoil a cup of tea! While you are at home I will give you daily\r\ninstruction in this most wholesome and independent business, which will\r\nbe of incalculable benefit to you, and which, I am frank to say, you\r\ncannot get in any agricultural college. College, indeed! I have spent\r\nthousands of hours in dreaming and planning what a farm should be like!\r\nDo you suppose I am going to let these visions become contaminated by\r\npractical knowledge? Not by a long way! I have, in the silent watches\r\nof the night, reduced the art to mathematical exactness, and I can show\r\nyou the figures. Don't talk to me about colleges!\"\r\n\r\nAfter supper we took the children through the house. Every part was\r\ninspected, and many were the expressions of pleasure and admiration.\r\nThey were delighted with their rooms, and apparently with everything\r\nelse. We finally quieted down in front of the open fire and discussed\r\nplans for the holidays. The children decided that it must be a house\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"Florence Marcy is with an aunt for whom she doesn't particularly care,\r\nand Minnie will just jump at the chance of spending a week in the\r\ncountry,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"You can invite three girls, and Jack can have three men. Of course\r\nJessie Gordon will be here. We will drive over in the morning and make\r\nsure of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack, whom will you ask? Get some good men out here, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best in the world, little sister, and you will have to keep a sharp\r\nlookout or you will lose your heart to one of them. Frank Howard will\r\ncount it a lark. He has stuck to the \"business\" as faithfully as if he\r\nwere not heir to it, and he will come sure to-morrow night. Dear old\r\nPhil--my many years' chum--will come because I ask him. These two are\r\nall right, and we can count on them. The other one is Jim Jarvis,--the\r\nfinest man in college.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about him, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jarvis's father lives in Montana, and has a lot of gold mines and other\r\nthings to keep him busy. He doesn't have time to pay much attention to\r\nhis son, who is growing up after his own fashion. Jim's mother is dead,\r\nand he has neither brother nor sister,--nothing but money and beauty and\r\nhealth and strength and courage and sense and the stanchest heart that\r\never lifted waistcoat! He has been on the eleven three years. They want\r\nhim in the boat, but he'll not have it; says it's not good work for a\r\nman. He's in the first division, well toward the front, too, and in the\r\nbest society. He's taken a fancy to me, and I'm dead gone on him. He's\r\nthe man for you to shun, little woman, unless you wish to be led\r\ncaptive.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are others, Jack, so don't worry about me. But do you think you\r\ncan secure this paragon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of it! I'll wire him in the morning, and he'll be here as\r\nsoon as steam can bring him; he's my best chum, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThis would make our party complete. We were all happy and pleased, and\r\nthe evening passed before we knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS EVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was a busy one for all of us. Polly and Jane drove to the\r\nGordons and secured Miss Jessie, and then Jane went to town to fetch her\r\nother friends. Jack went with her, after having telegraphed to Jim\r\nJarvis. They all came home by mid-afternoon, just as a message came from\r\nJarvis: \"Will be on deck at six.\"\r\n\r\nFlorence Marcy and Minnie Henderson were former neighbors and\r\nschoolmates of Jane's. They were fine girls to look at and bright girls\r\nto talk with; blondes, eighteen, high-headed, full of life, and great\r\ngirls for a house party. Phil and Frank were good specimens of their\r\nkinds. Frank was a little below medium height, slight, blond, vivacious\r\nto a degree, full of fun, and the most industrious talker within miles;\r\nhe would \"stir things up\" at a funeral. Phil Stone was tall, slender,\r\ndark, quiet, well-dressed, a good dancer, and a very agreeable fellow in\r\nthe corner of the room, where his low musical voice was most effective.\r\n\r\nJessie Gordon came at five o'clock. We were all very fond of Jessie, and\r\nwho could help it? She was tall (considerably above the average\r\nheight), slender, straight as an arrow, graceful in repose and in\r\nmotion. She carried herself like a queen, with a proud kind of shyness\r\nthat became her well. Her head was small and well set on a slender neck,\r\nher hair dark, luxurious, wavy, and growing low over a broad forehead,\r\nher eyes soft brown, shaded by heavy brows and lashes. She had a Grecian\r\nnose, and her mouth was a shade too wide, but it was guarded by\r\nsingularly perfect and sensitive lips. Her chin was pronounced enough to\r\ngive the impression of firmness; indeed, save for the soft eyes and\r\nsensitive mouth, firmness predominated. She was not a great talker, yet\r\nevery one loved to listen to her. She laughed with her eyes and lips,\r\nbut rarely with her voice. She enjoyed intensely, and could, therefore,\r\nsuffer intensely. She was a dear girl in every way.\r\n\r\nAll was now ready for the début of Jack's paragon. Jack had driven to\r\nthe station to fetch him, and presently the sound of wheels on the\r\ngravel drive announced the arrival of the last guest. I went into the\r\nhall to meet the men.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy, I want you to know my chum, Jim Jarvis,--the finest all-round\r\nson of old Eli. Jarvis, this is my daddy,--the finest father that ever\r\nhad son!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm right glad to meet you, Mr. Jarvis; your renown has preceded you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, Doctor, it has _exceeded_ me as well. Jack is not to be\r\ntrusted on all subjects. But, indeed, I thank you for your hospitality;\r\nit was a godsend to me.\"\r\n\r\nAs we entered the living room, Polly came forward and I presented Jarvis\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\"You are more than welcome, Mr. Jarvis! Jack's 'best friend' is certain\r\nof a warm corner at our fireside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I find no word of thanks, but I _do_ thank you. I have envied\r\nJack his home letters and the evidences of mother care more than\r\nanything else,--and God knows there are enough other things to envy him\r\nfor. I have no mother, and my father is too busy to pay much attention\r\nto me. I wish you would adopt me; I'll try to rival Jack in all that is\r\ndutiful.\"\r\n\r\nShe did adopt him then and there, for who could refuse such a son! Brown\r\nhair, brown eyes, brown skin, a frank, rugged, clean-shaven face,\r\nfeatures strong enough to excite criticism and good enough to bear it;\r\nbroad-shouldered, deep-chested, strong in arm and limb, he carried his\r\nsix feet of manhood like an Apollo in tweeds. He was introduced to the\r\ngirls,--the men he knew,--but he was not so quick in his speeches to\r\nthem. Our Hercules was only mildly conscious of his merits, and was\r\nevidently relieved when Jack hurried him off to his room to dress for\r\ndinner. When he was fairly out of hearing there was a chorus of\r\ncomments. The girls all declaimed him handsome, and the boys said:--\r\n\r\n\"That isn't the best of it,--he's a _trump_! Wait till you know him.\"\r\n\r\nJane was too loyal to Jack to admit that his friend was any handsomer or\r\nin any way a finer fellow than her brother.\r\n\r\n\"Who said he was?\" said Frank, \"Jack Williams is out and out the finest\r\nman I know. We were sizing him up by such fellows as Phil and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack's the most popular man at Yale,\" said Phil, \"but he's too modest\r\nto know it; Jarvis will tell you so. He thinks it's a great snap to have\r\nJack for his chum.\"\r\n\r\nThese things were music in my ears, for I was quite willing to agree\r\nwith the boys, and the mother's eyes were full of joy as she led the way\r\nto the dining room. That was a jolly meal. Nothing was said that could\r\nbe remembered, and yet we all talked a great deal and laughed a great\r\ndeal more. City, country, farm, college, and seminary were touched with\r\nmerry jests. Light wit provoked heavy laughter, and every one was the\r\nbetter for it. It was nine o'clock before we left the table. I heard\r\nJarvis say:--\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jane, I count it very unkind of Jack not to have let me go to\r\nFarmington with him last term. He used to talk of his 'little sister' as\r\nthough she were a miss in short dresses. Jack is a deep and treacherous\r\nfellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather say, a very prudent brother,\" said Jane. \"However, you may come\r\nto the Elm Tree Inn in the spring term, if Jack will let you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll work him all winter,\" was Jarvis's reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas light was slow in coming. There was a hush in the air as if\r\nthe earth were padded so that even the footsteps of Nature might not be\r\nheard. Out of my window I saw that a great fall of snow had come in the\r\nnight. The whole landscape was covered by fleecy down--soft and white as\r\nit used to be when I first saw it on the hills of New England. No wind\r\nhad moved it; it lay as it fell, like a white mantle thrown lightly over\r\nthe world. Great feathery flakes filled the air and gently descended\r\nupon the earth, like that beautiful Spirit that made the plains of Judea\r\nbright two thousand years ago. It seemed a fitting emblem of that nature\r\nwhich covered the unloveliness of the world by His own beauty, and\r\nchanged the dark spots of earth to pure white.\r\n\r\nIt was an ideal Christmas morning,--clean and beautiful. Such a wealth\r\nof purity was in the air that all the world was clothed with it. The\r\nearth accepted the beneficence of the skies, and the trees bent in\r\nthankfulness for their beautiful covering. It was a morning to make one\r\nthoughtful,--to make one thankful, too, for home and friends and\r\ncountry, and a future that could be earned, where the white folds of\r\nusefulness and purity would cover man's inheritance of selfishness and\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nFor an hour I watched the big flakes fall; and, as I watched, I dreamed\r\nthe dream of peace for all the world. The brazen trumpet of war was a\r\nthing of the past. The white dove of peace had built her nest in the\r\ncannon's mouth and stopped its awful roar. The federation of the world\r\nwas secured by universal intelligence and community of interest. Envy\r\nand selfishness and hypocrisy, and evil doing and evil speaking, were\r\ndeeply covered by the snowy mantle that brought \"peace on earth and good\r\nwill to men.\"\r\n\r\nMy dream was not dispelled by any rude awakening. As the house threw off\r\nthe fetters of the night and gradually struggled into activity, it was\r\nin such a fresh and loving manner and with such thoughtful solicitude\r\nfor each member of our world, that I walked in my dream all day.\r\n\r\nThe snow fell rapidly till noon, and then the sun came forth from the\r\nveil of clouds and cast its southern rays across the white expanse with\r\nan effect that drew exclamations of delight from all who had eyes to\r\nsee. No wind stirred the air, but ever and anon a bright avalanche would\r\nslide from bough or bush, sparkle and gleam as the sun caught it, and\r\nthen sink gently into the deep lap spread below. The bough would spring\r\nas if to catch its beautiful load, and, failing in this, would throw up\r\nits head and try to look unconcerned,--though quite evidently conscious\r\nof its bereavement.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the sun brought signs of life and activity. The men\r\nimprovised a snow-plough, the strong horses floundering in front of it\r\nmade roads and paths through the two feet of feathers that hid the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, the young people went for a frolic in the snow. Two hours\r\nlater the shaking of garments and stamping of feet gave evidence of the\r\nreturn of the party. Stepping into the hall I was at once surrounded by\r\nthe handsomest troupe of Esquimaux that ever invaded the temperate zone.\r\nThe snow clung lovingly to their wet clothing and would not be shaken\r\noff; their cheeks were flushed, their eyes bright, and their voices\r\npitched at an out-of-doors key.\r\n\r\n\"Away to your rooms, every one of you, and get into dry clothes,\" said\r\nI. \"Don't dare show yourselves until the dinner bell rings. I'll send\r\neach of you a hot negus,--it's a prescription and must be taken; I'm a\r\ntyrant when professional.\"\r\n\r\nWe saw nothing more of them until dinner. The young ladies came in\r\nwhite, with their maiden shoulders losing nothing by contact with their\r\nsnow-white gowns. All but Miss Jessie, whose dress was a pearl velvet,\r\nbuttoned close to her slender throat. I loved this style best, but I\r\ncould never believe that anything could be prettier than Jane's white\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe table was loaded, as Christmas tables should be, and, as I asked\r\nGod's blessing on it and us, the thought came that the answer had\r\npreceded the request and that we were blessed in unusual degree.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the rugs in the great room were rolled up, and the young\r\nfolks danced to Laura's music, which could inspire unwilling feet. But\r\nthere were none such that night. Tom and Kate led off in the newest and\r\nmost fantastic waltz, others followed, and Polly and I were the only\r\nspectators. An hour of this, and then we gathered around the hearth to\r\nhear Polly read \"The Christmas Carol.\" No one reads like Polly. Her low,\r\nsoft voice seems never to know fatigue, but runs on like a musical\r\nbrook. When the reading was over, a hush of satisfied enjoyment had\r\ntaken possession of us all. It was not broken when Miss Jessie turned to\r\nthe piano and sang that glorious hymn, \"Lead, Kindly Light.\" Jack was\r\nclose beside her, his blue eyes shining with an appreciation of which\r\nany woman might be proud, and his baritone in perfect harmony with her\r\nrich contralto. The young ladies took the higher part, Frank added his\r\ntenor, and even Phil and I leaned heavily on Jarvis's deep bass. My\r\neffort was of short duration; a lump gathered in my throat that caused\r\nme to turn away. Polly was searching fruitlessly for something to dry\r\nthe tears that overran her eyes, and I was able to lend her aid, but the\r\naccommodation was of the nature of a \"call loan.\"\r\n\r\nAs we separated for the night, Jarvis said: \"Lady mother, this day has\r\nbeen a revelation to me. If I live a hundred years, I shall never forget\r\nit.\" I was slow in bringing it to a close. As I loitered in my room, I\r\nheard the shuffling of slippered feet in the hall, and a timid knock at\r\nPolly's door. It was quickly opened for Jane and Jessie, and I heard\r\nsobbing voices say:--\r\n\r\n\"Momee, we want to cry on your bed,\" and, \"Oh, Mrs. Williams, why can't\r\nall days be like this!\"\r\n\r\nPolly's voice was low and indistinct, but I know that it carried strong\r\nand loving counsel; and, as I turned to my pillow, I was still dreaming\r\nthe dream of the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nWE CLOSE THE BOOKS FOR '96\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning after Christmas broke clear, with a wind from the south that\r\npromised to make quick work of the snow. The young people were engaged\r\nfor the evening, as indeed for most evenings, in the hospitable village,\r\nand they spent the day on the farm as pleased them best.\r\n\r\nThere were many things to interest city-bred folk on a place like Four\r\nOaks. Everything was new to them, and they wanted to see the workings of\r\nthe factory farm in all its detail. They made friends with the men who\r\nhad charge of the stock, and spent much time in the stables. Polly and I\r\nsaw them occasionally, but they did not need much attention from us. We\r\nhave never found it necessary to entertain our friends on the farm. They\r\nseem to do that for themselves. We simply live our lives with them, and\r\nthey live theirs with us. This works well both for the guests and for\r\nthe hosts.\r\n\r\nThe great event of the holiday week was a New Year Eve dance at the\r\nCountry Club. Every member was expected to appear in person or by proxy,\r\nas this was the greatest of many functions of the year.\r\n\r\nSunday was warm and sloppy, and little could be done out of doors. Part\r\nof the household were for church, and the rest lounged until luncheon;\r\nthen Polly read \"Sonny\" until twilight, and Laura played strange music\r\nin the half-dark.\r\n\r\nThe next day the men went into town to look about, and to lunch with\r\nsome college chums. As they would not return until five, the ladies had\r\nthe day to themselves. They read a little, slept a little, and talked\r\nmuch, and were glad when five o'clock and the men came. Tea was so hot\r\nand fragrant, the house so cosey, and the girls so pretty, that Jack\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"What chumps we men were to waste the whole day in town!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you expect of men, Mr. Jack?\" said Jessie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know, the old story of pearls and swine, but there are pearls\r\nand pearls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that there are more pearls than swine, Mr. Jack? For, if\r\nyou do, I will take issue with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am a swine, I will be an æsthetic one and wear the pearl that\r\ncomes my way,\" said Jack, looking steadily into the eyes of the\r\nhigh-headed girl.\r\n\r\n\"Will you have one lump or two?\"\r\n\r\n\"One,\" said Jack, as he took his cup.\r\n\r\nThe last day of the year came all too quickly for both young and old at\r\nFour Oaks. Polly and I went into hiding in the office in the afternoon\r\nto make up the accounts for the year. As Polly had spent the larger\r\nlump sum, I could face her with greater boldness than on the previous\r\noccasion. Here is an excerpt from the farm ledger:--\r\n\r\nExpended in 1896                            $43,309\r\nInterest on previous account                  2,200\r\n                                            _______\r\n         Total                              $45,509\r\nReceipts                                      5,105\r\n                                            _______\r\nNet expense                                 $40,404\r\nPrevious account                             44,000\r\n                                            _______\r\n                                            $84,404\r\n\r\nThe farm owes me a little more than $84,000. \"Not so good as I hoped,\r\nand not so bad as I feared,\" said Polly. \"We will win out all right, Mr.\r\nHeadman, though it does seem a lot of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the Irishman's pig,\" quoth I. \"Pat said, 'It didn't weigh nearly\r\nas much as I expected, but I never thought it would.'\"\r\n\r\nThere was little to depress us in the past, and nothing in the present,\r\nso we joined the young people for the dance at the Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nOUR FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter our guests had departed, to college or school or home, the house\r\nwas left almost deserted. We did not shut it up, however. Fires were\r\nbright on all hearths, and lamps were kept burning. We did not mean to\r\nlose the cheeriness of the house, though much of the family had\r\ndeparted. For a wonder, the days did not seem lonesome. After the fist\r\nbreak was over, we did not find time to think of our solitude, and as\r\nthe weeks passed we wondered what new wings had caused them to fly so\r\nswiftly. Each day had its interests of work or study or social function.\r\nStormy days and unbroken evenings were given to reading. We consumed\r\nmany books, both old and new, and we were not forgotten by our friends.\r\nThe dull days of winter did not drag; indeed, they were accepted with\r\nreal pleasure. Our lives had hitherto been too much filled with the\r\nhurry and bustle inseparable from the fashionable existence-struggle of\r\na large city to permit us to settle down with quiet nerves to the real\r\nhappiness of home. So much of enjoyment accompanies and depends upon\r\ntranquillity of mind, that we are apt to miss half of it in the turmoil\r\nof work-strife and social-strife that fill the best years of most men\r\nand women.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that all overwrought people cannot have a chance to relax\r\ntheir nerves, and to learn the possibilities of happiness that are\r\nwithin them. Most of the jars and bickerings of domestic life, most of\r\nthe mental and moral obliquities, depend upon threadbare nerves, either\r\ninherited or uncovered by friction incident to getting on in the world.\r\nI never understood the comforts that follow in the wake of a quiet,\r\nunambitious life, until such a life was forced upon me. When you\r\ndiscover these comforts for the first time, you marvel that you have\r\nforegone them so long, and are fain to recommend them to all the world.\r\n\r\nPolly and I had gotten on reasonably well up to this time; but before we\r\nbecame conscious of any change, we found ourselves drawn closer together\r\nby a multitude of small interests common to both. After twenty-five\r\nyears of married life it will compensate any man to take a little time\r\nfrom business and worry that he may become acquainted with his wife. A\r\nfew fortunate men do this early in life, and they draw compound interest\r\non the investment; but most of us feel the cares of life so keenly that\r\nwe take them home with us to show in our faces and to sit at our tables\r\nand to blight the growth of that cheerful intercourse which perpetuates\r\nlove and cements friendship in the home as well as in the world.\r\n\r\nThere were no serious cares nowadays, and time passed so smoothly at\r\nFour Oaks that we wondered at the picnic life that had fallen to us. The\r\nvillage of Exeter was alive in all things social. The city families who\r\nhad farms or country places near the village were so fond of them that\r\nthey rarely closed them for more than two or three months, and these\r\nmonths were as likely to come in summer as in winter.\r\n\r\nOur friends the Gordons made Homestead Farm their permanent residence,\r\nthough they kept open house in town. Beyond the Gordons' was the modest\r\nhome of an Irish baronet, Sir Thomas O'Hara. Sir Tom was a bachelor of\r\nsixty. He had run through two fortunes (as became an Irish baronet) in\r\nthe racing field and at Homburg, and as a young man he had lived ten\r\nyears at Limmer's tavern in London. When not in training to ride his own\r\nsteeple-chasers, he was putting up his hands against any man in England\r\nwho would face him for a few friendly rounds. He was not always\r\nvictorious, either in the field, before the green cloth, or in the ring;\r\nbut he was always a kind-hearted gentleman who would divide his last\r\ncrown with friend or foe, and who could accept a beating with grace and\r\nunruffled spirit.\r\n\r\nHe could never ride below the welter weight, and after a few years he\r\noutgrew this weight and was forced to give up the least expensive of\r\nhis diversions. The green cloth now received more of his attention,\r\nand, as a matter of course, of his money. Things went badly with him,\r\nand he began to see the end of his second fortune before he called a\r\nhalt. Bad times in Ireland seriously reduced his rents, and he was\r\nforced to dispose of his salable estates. Then he came to this country\r\nin the hope of recouping himself, and to get away from the fast set that\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\n\"I can resist anything but temptation,\" this warm-hearted Irishman would\r\nsay; and that was the keynote of his character.\r\n\r\nThough Sir Tom was only sixty years old, he looked seventy. He was much\r\nbroken in health by gout and the fast pace of his early manhood. But his\r\nspirit was untouched by misfortune, disease, or hardship. His courage\r\nwas as good as when he served as a subaltern of the Guards in the\r\ntrenches before Sebastopol, or presented his body as a mark for the\r\nsledge-hammer blows of Tom Sayers, just for diversion. His constitution\r\nmust have been superb, for even in his decrepitude he was good to look\r\nupon: five feet ten, fine body, slightly given to rotundity, legs a\r\nlittle shrunken in the shanks, but giving unmistakable signs of what\r\nthey had been (\"not lost, but gone before,\" as he would say of them),\r\nhands and feet aristocratic in form and well cared for, and a fine head\r\nset on broad shoulders. His hair was thin, and he parted it with great\r\nexactness in the middle. His eyes were brown, large, and of exceeding\r\nsoftness. His nose was straight in spite of many a contusion, and his\r\nwhole expression was that of a high-bred gentleman somewhat the worse\r\nfor wear. Sir Tom was perfectly groomed when he came forth from his\r\nchamber, which was usually about ten in the morning.\r\n\r\nThose of us who had access to his rooms often wondered how he ever got\r\nout of them looking so immaculate, for they were a perfectly impassable\r\njungle to the stranger. Such a tangle of trunks, hand-bags, rug bundles,\r\nclothes, boots, pajamas, newspapers, scrap-books, B. & S. bottles, could\r\nhardly be found anywhere else in the world. He had a fondness for\r\nnewspaper clippings, and had trunks of them, sorted into bundles or\r\npasted in scrap-books. Old volumes of Bell's _Life_ filled more than one\r\ntrunk, and on one occasion when he and I were spending a long evening\r\ntogether, in celebration of his recent recovery from an attack of gout,\r\nand when he had done more than usual justice to the B. & S. bottles and\r\nless than usual justice to his gout, he showed me the record of a\r\nlong-gone year in which this same Bell's _Life_ called him the \"first\r\namong the gentlemen riders in the United Kingdom,\" and proved this\r\nassertion by showing how he had won most of the great steeple-chases in\r\nEngland and Ireland, riding his own horses. This was the nearest\r\napproach to boasting that ever came to my knowledge in the years of our\r\nclose friendship, and I would never have thought of it as such had I\r\nnot seen that he regarded it as unwarrantable self-praise.\r\n\r\nI have never known a more simple, kind-hearted, agreeable, and lovable\r\ngentleman than this broken-down sporting man and gambler. I loved him as\r\na brother; and though he has passed out of my life, I still love the\r\nmemory of his genial face, his courtesy, his unselfish friendship, more\r\nthan words can express. A tender heart and a gentle spirit found strange\r\nhousing in a body given over to reckless prodigality. The combination,\r\ntempered by time and exhaustion, showed nothing that was not lovable;\r\nand it is scant praise to say that Sir Thomas was much to me.\r\n\r\nHe was just as acceptable to Polly. No woman could fail to appreciate\r\nthe homage which he never failed to show to the wife and mother. Many\r\nwinter evenings at Four Oaks were made brighter by his presence, and we\r\ngrew to expect him at least three nights each week. His plate was placed\r\non our round table these nights, and he rarely failed to use it; and the\r\nB. & S. bottles were near at hand, and his favorite brand of cigars\r\nwithin easy reach.\r\n\r\n\"I light a 'baccy' by your permission, Mrs. Williams,\" and a courtly bow\r\naccompanied the words.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 William came to bring Sir Tom home. The leave-taking was always\r\nformal with Polly, but with me it was, \"Ta-ta, Williams--see you\r\nlater,\" and our guest would hobble out on his poor crippled feet, waving\r\nhis hand gallantly, with a voice as cheery as a boy's.\r\n\r\nAnother family whom I wish the reader to know well is the Kyrles. For\r\nmore than twenty-five years we have known no joys or sorrows which they\r\ndid not feel, and no interests that touched them have failed to leave a\r\nmark on us. We could not have been more intimate or better friends had\r\nthe closest blood tie united us. The acquaintance of young married\r\ncouples had grown into a friendship that was bearing its best fruit at a\r\ntime when best fruit was most appreciated. We do not consider a pleasure\r\nmore than half complete until we have told it to Will and Frances Kyrle,\r\nfor their delight doubles our happiness.\r\n\r\nThey were among the earliest of my patients, and they are easily first\r\namong our friends. I have watched more than a half-dozen of their\r\nchildren from infancy to adult life, and this alone would be a strong\r\nbond; but in addition to this is the fact that the whole family, from\r\nfather to youngest child, possess in a wonderful degree that subtle\r\nsense of true camaraderie which is as rare as it is charming.\r\n\r\nThe Kyrles lived in the city, but they were foot-free, and we could\r\ncount on having them often. Four Oaks was to be, if we had our way, a\r\ncountry home for them almost as much as for us. Indeed, one of the\r\nrooms was called the Kyrles' room, and they came to it at will. Enough\r\nabout our friends. We must go back to the farm interests, which are,\r\nindeed, the only excuse for this history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE HEADMAN'S JOB\r\n\r\n\r\nOur life at Four Oaks began in earnest in January, 1897. Even during the\r\nwinter months there was no lack of employment and interest for the\r\nHeadman. I breakfasted at seven, and from that time until noon I was as\r\nbusy as if I were working for $20 a month. The master's eye is worth\r\nmore than his hand in a factory like mine. My men were, and are, an\r\nunusual lot,--intelligent, sober, and willing,--but they, like others,\r\nare apt to fall into routine ways, and thereby to miss points which an\r\nobserving proprietor would not overlook.\r\n\r\nThe cows, for instance, were all fed the same ration. Fifteen pounds of\r\nmixed grains was none too much for the big Holstein milk-makers, who\r\nwere yielding well and looking in perfect health; but the common cows\r\nwere taking on too much flesh and falling off in milk. I at once changed\r\nthe ration for these six cows by leaving out the corn entirely and\r\nsubstituting oat straw for alfalfa in the cut feed. The change brought\r\ngood results in five of the cows; the other one did not pick up in her\r\nmilk, and after a reasonable trial I sold her.\r\n\r\nThe herd was doing excellently for mid-winter,--the yield amounted to a\r\ndaily average of 840 pounds throughout the month, and I was able to make\r\ngood my contract with the middleman. I could see breakers ahead,\r\nhowever, and it behooved me to make ready for them. I decided to buy ten\r\nmore thoroughbreds in new milk, if I could find them. I wrote to the\r\npeople from whom I had purchased the first herd, and after a little\r\ndelay secured nine cows in fresh milk and about four years old. This\r\naddition came in February, and kept my milk supply above the danger\r\npoint. Since then I have bought no cows. Thirty-four of these\r\nthoroughbreds are still at Four Oaks--two of them have died, and three\r\nhave been sold for not keeping up to the standard--and are doing grand\r\nservice. Their numbers have been reënforced by twenty of their best\r\ndaughters, so there are at this writing fifty-four milch cows and five\r\nyearling heifers in the herd. Most of the calves have been disposed of\r\nas soon as weaned. I have no room for more stock on my place, and it\r\ndoesn't pay to keep them to sell as cows. Four Oaks is not a breeding\r\nfarm, but a factory farm, and everything has to be subordinated to the\r\nfactory idea.\r\n\r\nMy thoroughbred calves have brought me an average price of $12 each at\r\nfour to six weeks, sold to dairymen, and I am satisfied to do business\r\nin that way. The nine milch cows which I bought to complete the herd\r\ncost, delivered at Four Oaks, $1012.\r\n\r\nAll the grain fed to cows, horses, and hogs, and a portion of that fed\r\nto chickens, is ground fine before feeding. The grinding is done in the\r\ngranary by a mill with a capacity of forty bushels an hour. We make corn\r\nmeal, corn and cob meal, and oatmeal enough for a week's supply in a few\r\nhours. All hay and straw is cut fine, before being fed, by a power\r\ncutter in the forage barn, and from thence is taken by teams in box\r\nracks to the feeding rooms, where it is wetted with hot water and mixed\r\nwith the ground feed for the cows and horses, and steamed or cooked with\r\nthe ground feed for the hogs and hens.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is the only hay used for the hens, and wonderfully good it is\r\nfor them. Besides feed for the hogs, we have to provide ashes, salt, and\r\ncharcoal for them. These three things are kept constantly before them in\r\nnarrow troughs set so near the wall that they cannot get their feet into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe carefully save all wood ashes for the hogs and hens, and we burn our\r\nown charcoal in a pit in the wood lot. Five cords of sound wood make an\r\nabundant supply for a year. I think this side dish constantly before\r\nswine goes a long way toward keeping them healthy. Clean pens,\r\nwell-balanced and well-cooked food, pure water, and this medicine can\r\nbe counted on to keep a growing and fattening herd healthy during its\r\nnine months of life.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that it is unnatural and artificial to confine these young\r\nthings within such narrow limits, and so it is; but the whole scheme is\r\nunnatural, if you please. The pig is born to die, and to die quickly,\r\nfor the profit and maintenance of man. What could be more unnatural?\r\nWould he be better reconciled to his fate after spending his nine months\r\nbetween field and sty? I wot not. The Chester White is an indolent\r\nfellow, and I suspect he loves his comfortable house, his cool stone\r\nporch, his back yard to dig in, his neighbors across the wire fence to\r\ngossip with, and his well-balanced, well-cooked food served under his\r\nown nose three times a day. At least he looks content in his piggery,\r\nand grows faster and puts on more flesh in his 250 days than does his\r\nneighbor of the field. If the hog's profitable life were twice or thrice\r\nas long, I would advocate a wider liberty for the early part of it; but\r\nas it doesn't pay to keep the animal after he is nine months old, the\r\nquickest way to bring him to perfection is the best. One cannot afford\r\nto graze animals of any kind when one is trying to do intensive farming.\r\nIt is indirect, it is wasteful of space and energy, and it doesn't force\r\nthe highest product. Grazing, as compared with soiling, may be\r\neconomical of labor, but as I understand economics that is the one\r\nthing in which we do not wish to economize. The multiplication of\r\nwell-paid and well-paying labor is a thing to be specially desired. If\r\nthe soiling farm will keep two or three more men employed at good wages,\r\nand at the same time pay better interest than the grazing farm, it\r\nshould be looked upon as much the better method. The question of\r\nfurnishing landscape for hogs is one that borders too closely on the\r\næsthetic or the sentimental to gain the approval of the factory-farm\r\nman. What is true of hogs is also true of cows. They are better off\r\nunder the constant care of intelligent and interested human beings than\r\nwhen they follow the rippling brook or wind slowly o'er the lea at their\r\nown sweet pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the rippling brook doesn't always furnish the best water,\r\nand the lea furnishes very imperfect forage during nine months of the\r\nyear. A twenty-acre lot in good grass, in which to take the air, is all\r\nthat a well-regulated herd of fifty cows needs. The clean, cool, calm\r\nstable is much to their liking, and the regular diet of a first-class\r\ncow-kitchen insures a uniform flow of milk.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of hogs and cows is true also of hens. The common opinion\r\nthat the farm-raised hen that has free range is healthier or happier\r\nthan her sister in a well-ordered hennery is not based on facts. Freedom\r\nto forage for one's self and pick up a precarious living does not always\r\nmean health, happiness, or comfort. The strenuous life on the farm\r\ncannot compare in comfort with the quiet house and the freedom from\r\nanxiety of the well-tended hen. The vicissitudes of life are terrible\r\nfor the uncooped chicken. The occupants of air, earth, and water lie in\r\nwait for it. It is fair game for the hawk and the owl; the fox, the\r\nweasel, the rat, the wood pussy, the cat, and the dog are its sworn\r\nenemies. The horse steps on it, the wheel crushes it; it falls into the\r\ncistern or the swill barrel; it is drenched by showers or stiffened by\r\nfrosts, and, as the English say, it has a \"rather indifferent time of\r\nit.\" If it survive the summer, and some chickens do, it will roost and\r\nshiver on the limb of an apple tree. Its nest will be accessible only to\r\nthe mink and the rat; and, like Rachel, it will mourn for its children,\r\nwhich are not.\r\n\r\nNo, the well-yarded hen has by all odds the best of it. The wonder is\r\nthat, with three-fourths of the poultry at large and making its own\r\nliving, hens still furnish a product, in this country alone,\r\n$100,000,000 greater in value than the whole world's output of gold. Our\r\nannual production of eggs and poultry foots up to $280,000,000,--$4\r\napiece for every man, woman, and child,--and yet people say that hens do\r\nnot pay!\r\n\r\nEach flock of forty hens at Four Oaks has a house sixteen feet by\r\ntwenty, and a run twenty feet by one hundred. I hear no complaints of\r\nclose quarters or lack of freedom, but I do hear continually the song\r\nof contentment, and I see results daily that are more satisfactory than\r\nthose of any oil well or mine in which I have ever been interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nSPRING OF '97\r\n\r\n\r\nSam began to make up his breeding pens in January. He selected 150 of\r\nhis favorites, divided them into 10 flocks of 15, added a fine cockerel\r\nto each pen (we do not allow cocks or cockerels to run with the laying\r\nhens), and then began to set the incubator house in order.\r\n\r\nHe filled the first incubator on Saturday, January 30, and from that day\r\nuntil late in April he was able to start a fresh machine about every six\r\ndays. Sam reports the total hatch for the year as 1917 chicks, out of\r\nwhich number he had, when he separated them in the early autumn, 678\r\npullets to put in the runs for laying hens, and 653 cockerels to go to\r\nthe fattening pens. These figures show that Sam was a first-class\r\nchicken man.\r\n\r\nWe secured 300 tons of ice at the side of the lake for $98, having to\r\npay a little more that year than the last, on account of the heavy fall\r\nof snow.\r\n\r\nThe wood-house was replenished, although there was still a good deal of\r\nlast year's cut on hand. We did not fell any trees, for there was still\r\na considerable quantity of dead wood on the ground which should be used\r\nfirst. I wanted to clear out much of the useless underbrush, but we had\r\nonly time to make a beginning in this effort at forestry. We went over\r\nperhaps ten acres across the north line, removing briers and brush.\r\nEverything that looked like a possible future tree was left. Around oak\r\nand hickory stumps we found clumps of bushes springing from living\r\nroots. These we cut away, except one or possibly two of the most\r\nthrifty. We trimmed off the lower branches of those we saved, and left\r\nthem to make such trees as they could. I have been amazed to see what a\r\ngrowth an oak-root sprout will make after its neighbors have been cut\r\naway. There are some hundreds of these trees in the forest at Four Oaks,\r\nfrom five to six inches in diameter, which did not measure more than one\r\nor two inches five years ago.\r\n\r\nAs the underbrush was cleared from the wood lot, I planned to set young\r\ntrees to fill vacant spaces. The European larch was used in the first\r\nexperiment. In the spring of 1897 I bought four thousand seedling\r\nlarches for $80, planted them in nursery rows in the orchard, cultivated\r\nthem for two years, and then transplanted them to the forest. The larch\r\nis hardy and grows rapidly; and as it is a valuable tree for many\r\npurposes, it is one of the best for forest planting. I have planted no\r\nothers thus far at Four Oaks, as the four thousand from my little\r\nnursery seem to fill all unoccupied spaces.\r\n\r\nFresh mulching was piled near all the young fruit trees, to be applied\r\nas soon as the frost was out of the ground. Several hundreds of loads of\r\nmanure were hauled to the fields, to be spread as soon as the snow\r\ndisappeared. I always return manure to the land as soon as it can be\r\ndone conveniently. The manure from the hen-house was saved this year to\r\nuse on the alfalfa fields, to see how well it would take the place of\r\ncommercial fertilizer. I may as well give the result of the experiment\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIt was mixed with sand and applied at the rate of eight hundred pounds\r\nan acre for the spring dressing over a portion of the alfalfa, against\r\nfour hundred pounds an acre of the fertilizer 3:8:8. After two years I\r\nwas convinced that, when used alone, it is not of more than half the\r\nvalue of the fertilizer.\r\n\r\nMy present practice is to use five hundred pounds of hen manure and two\r\nhundred pounds of fertilizer on each acre for the spring dressing, and\r\ntwo hundred pounds an acre of the fertilizer alone after each cutting\r\nexcept the last. We have ten or twelve tons of hen manure each year, and\r\nit is nearly all used on the alfalfa or the timothy as spring dressing.\r\nIt costs nothing, and it takes off a considerable sum from the\r\nfertilizer account. I am not at all sure that the scientists would\r\napprove this method of using it; I can only give my experience, and say\r\nthat it brings me satisfactory crops.\r\n\r\nThere was much snow in January and February, and in March much rain.\r\nWhen the spring opened, therefore, the ground was full of water. This\r\nwas fortunate, for April and May were unusually dry months,--only 1.16\r\ninches of water.\r\n\r\nThe dry April brought the ploughs out early; but before we put our hands\r\nto the plough we should make a note of what the first quarter of 1897\r\nbrought into our strong box.\r\n\r\nSold:\r\n   Butter . . . .  $842.00\r\n   Eggs   . . . .   401.00\r\n   Cow    . . . .    35.00\r\n   Two sows . . .    19.00\r\n     Total  . . . $1297.00\r\n\r\nFifteen of the young sows farrowed in March, and the other 9 in April,\r\nas also did 18 old ones. The young sows gave us 147 pigs, and the old\r\nones 161, so that the spring opened with an addition to our stock of 300\r\nhead of young swine.\r\n\r\nBetween March 1 and May 10 were born 25 calves, which were all sold\r\nbefore July 1. The population of our factory farm was increasing so\r\nrapidly that it became necessary to have more help. We already had eight\r\nmen and three women, besides the help in the big house. One would think\r\nthat eight men could do the work on a farm of 320 acres, and so they\r\ncan, most of the time; but in seed-time and harvest they are not\r\nsufficient at Four Oaks. We could not work the teams.\r\n\r\nUp to March, 1897, Sam had full charge of the chickens, and also looked\r\nafter the hogs, with the help of Anderson. Judson and French had their\r\nhands full in the cow stables, and Lars was more than busy with the\r\ncarriage horses and the driving. Thompson was working foreman, and his\r\nson Zeb and Johnson looked after the farm horses during the winter and\r\ndid the general work. From that time on Sam gave his entire time to the\r\nchickens, Anderson his entire time to the hogs, and Johnson began\r\ngardening in real earnest. This left only Thompson and Zeb for general\r\nfarm work.\r\n\r\nAgain I advertised for two farm hands. I selected two of the most\r\npromising applicants and brought them out to the farm. Thompson\r\ndischarged one of them at the end of the first day for persistently\r\njerking his team, and the other discharged himself at the week's end, to\r\ncontinue his tramp. Once more I resorted to the city papers. This time I\r\nwas more fortunate, for I found a young Swede, square-built and\r\nblond-headed, who said he had worked on his father's farm in the old\r\ncountry, and had left it because it was too small for the five boys.\r\nOtto was slow of speech and of motion, but he said he could work, and I\r\nhired him. The other man whom I sent to the farm at the same time proved\r\nof no use whatever. He stayed four days, and was dismissed for\r\ninnocuous desuetude. Still another man whom I tried did well for five\r\nweeks, and then broke out in a most profound spree, from which he could\r\nnot be weaned. He ended up by an assault on Otto in the stable yard. The\r\nSwede was taken by surprise, and was handsomely bowled over by the first\r\nonslaught of his half-drunk, half-crazed antagonist. As soon, however,\r\nas his slow mind took in the fact that he was being pounded, he gathered\r\nhis forces, and, with a grunt for a war-cry, rolled his enemy under him,\r\nsat upon his stomach, and, flat-handed, slapped his face until he\r\nshouted for aid. The man left the farm at once, and I commended the\r\nSwede for having used the flat of his hand.\r\n\r\nIn spite of bad luck with the new men we were able to plough and seed\r\n144 acres by May 10. Lots Nos. 8, 12, 13, and 14 were planted to corn,\r\nand No. 15 sowed to oats, and the 10 acres on the home lot were divided\r\nbetween sweet fodder corn, potatoes, and cabbage. The abundant water in\r\nthe soil gave the crops a fair start, and June proved an excellent\r\ngrowing month, a rainfall of nearly four inches putting them beyond\r\ndanger from the short water supply of July and August. Indeed, had it\r\nnot been for the generosity of June we should have been in a bad way,\r\nfor the next three months gave a scant four inches of rain.\r\n\r\nThe oats made a good growth, though the straw was rather short, and the\r\ncorn did very well indeed,--due largely to thorough cultivation. Twelve\r\nacres of oats were cut for forage, and the rest yielded 33 bushels to\r\nthe acre,--a little over 1300 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe alfalfa and timothy made a good start. From the former we cut, late\r\nin June, 2¼ tons to the acre, and from the timothy, in July, 2½\r\ntons,--50 tons of timothy and 45 of alfalfa. Each of these fields\r\nreceived the usual top-dressing after the crop was cut; but the timothy\r\ndid not respond,--the late season was too dry. We cut two more crops\r\nfrom the alfalfa field, which together made a yield of a little more\r\nthan 2 tons. The alfalfa in that dry summer gave me 95 tons of good hay,\r\nproving its superiority as a dry-weather crop.\r\n\r\nJohnson started the one-and-one-half-acre vegetable and fruit garden in\r\nApril, and devoted much of his time to it. His primitive hotbeds\r\ngradually emptied themselves into the garden, and we now began to taste\r\nthe fruit of our own soil, much to the pleasure of the whole colony. It\r\nis surprising what a real gardener can do with a garden of this size. By\r\nfeeding soil and plants liberally, he is able to keep the ground\r\nproducing successive crops of vegetables, from the day the frost leaves\r\nit in the spring until it again takes possession in the fall, without\r\ndoing any wrong to the land. Indeed, our garden grows better and more\r\nprolific each year in spite of the immense crops that are taken from\r\nit. This can be done only by a person who knows his business, and\r\nJohnson is such a person. He gave much of his time to this practical\r\npatch, but he also worked with Polly among the shrubs on the lawn, and\r\nin her sunken flower garden, which is the pride of her life. We shall\r\nhear more about this flower garden later on.\r\n\r\nThe accounts for the second quarter of the year show these items on the\r\nincome side:--\r\n\r\nButter             $1052.00\r\nEggs                 379.00\r\nTwenty-five calves   275.00\r\n                   --------\r\nTotal              $1706.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable occupations of a farmer's life is the care of\r\nyoung trees. Until your experience in this work is of a personal and\r\nproprietary nature, you will not realize the pleasure it can afford. The\r\nintimate study of plant life, especially if that plant life is yours, is\r\na never failing source of pleasurable speculation, and a thing upon\r\nwhich to hang dreams. You grow to know each tree, not only by its shape\r\nand its habit of growth, but also by peculiarities that belong to it as\r\nan individual. The erect, sturdy bearing of one bespeaks a frank, bold\r\nnature, which makes it willing to accept its surroundings and make the\r\nmost of them; while the crooked, dwarfish nature of another requires the\r\nutmost care of the husbandman to keep it within the bounds of good\r\nbehavior. And yet we often find that the slow-growing, ill-conditioned\r\nyoung tree, if properly cared for, will bring forth the finest fruit at\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nTo study the character and to watch the development of young trees is a\r\npleasing and useful occupation for the man who thinks of them as living\r\nthings with an inheritance that cannot be ignored. That seeds in all\r\nappearance exactly alike should send forth shoots so unlike, is a wonder\r\nof Nature; and that young shoots in the same soil and with the same care\r\nshould show such dissimilarity in development, is a riddle whose answer\r\nis to be found only in the binding laws of heredity. That a tiny bud\r\ninserted under the bark of a well-grown tree can change a sour root to a\r\nsweet bough, ought to make one careful of the buds which one grafts on\r\nthe living trunk of one's tree of life. The young orchard can teach many\r\nlessons to him who is willing to be taught; in the hands of him who is\r\nnot, the schoolmaster has a very sorry time of it, no matter how he sets\r\nhis lessons.\r\n\r\nThe side pockets of my jacket are usually weighted down with\r\npruning-shears, a sharp knife, and a handled copper wire,--always,\r\nindeed, in June, when I walk in my orchard. June is the month of all\r\nmonths for the prudent orchardist to go thus armed, for the apple-tree\r\nborer is abroad in the land. When the quick eye of the master sees a\r\nlittle pile of sawdust at the base of a tree, he knows that it is time\r\nfor him to sit right down by that tree and kill its enemy. The sharp\r\nknife enlarges the hole, which is the trail of the serpent, and the\r\nsharp-pointed, flexible wire follows the route until it has reached and\r\ntransfixed the borer.\r\n\r\nThis is the only way. It is the nature of the borer to maim or kill the\r\ntree; it is for the interest of the owner that the tree should live. The\r\nconflict is irrepressible, and the weakest must go to the wall. The\r\nborer evil can be reduced to a minimum by keeping the young trees banked\r\nthree or four inches high with firm dirt or ashes; but borers must be\r\nfollowed with the wire, once they enter the bark.\r\n\r\nThe sharp knife and the pruning-shears have other uses in the June\r\norchard. Limbs and sprouts will come in irregular and improper places,\r\nand they should be nipped out early and thus save labor and mutilation\r\nlater on. Sprouts that start from the eyes on the trunk can be removed\r\nby a downward stroke of the gloved hand. All intersecting or crossing\r\nboughs are removed by knife or scissors, and branches which are too\r\nluxuriant in growth are cut or pinched back. Careful guidance of the\r\ntree in June will avoid the necessity of severe correction later on.\r\n\r\nA man ought to plant an orchard, if for no other reason, that he may\r\nhave the pleasure of caring for it, and for the companionship of the\r\ntrees. This was the second year of growth for my orchard, and I was\r\ngratified by the evidences of thrift and vigor. Fine, spreading heads\r\nadorned the tops of the stubs of trees that had received such\r\n(apparently) cruel treatment eighteen months before. The growth of these\r\ntwo seasons convinced me that the four-year-old root and the\r\nthree-year-old stem, if properly managed, have greater possibilities of\r\nrapid development than roots or stems of more tender age. I think I made\r\nno mistake in planting three-year-old trees.\r\n\r\nAs I worked in my orchard I could not help looking forward to the time\r\nwhen the trees would return a hundred-fold for the care bestowed upon\r\nthem. They would begin to bring returns, in a small way, from the fourth\r\nyear, and after that the returns would increase rapidly. It is safe to\r\npredict that from the tenth to the fortieth year a well-managed orchard\r\nwill give an average yearly income of $100 an acre above all expenses,\r\nincluding interest on the original cost. A fifty-acre orchard of\r\nwell-selected apple trees, near a first-class market and in intelligent\r\nhands, means a net income of $5000, taking one year with another, for\r\nthirty or forty years. What kind of investment will pay better? What\r\nsort of business will give larger returns in health and pleasure?\r\n\r\nI do not mean to convey the idea that forty years is the life of an\r\norchard; hundreds of years would be more correct. As trees die from\r\naccident or decrepitude, others should take their places. Thus the lease\r\nof life becomes perpetual in hands that are willing to keep adding to\r\nthe soil more than the trees and the fruit take from it. Comparatively\r\nfew owners of orchards do this, and those who belong to the majority\r\nwill find fault with my figures; but the thinking few, who do not expect\r\nto enjoy the fat of the land without making a reasonable return, will\r\nsay that I am too conservative,--that a well-placed, well-cared-for,\r\nwell-selected, and well-marketed orchard will do much better than my\r\nprophecy. Nature is a good husbandman so far as she goes, but her scheme\r\ncontemplates only the perpetuation of the tree, by seeds or by other\r\nmeans. Nature's plan is to give to each specimen a nutritive ration.\r\nAnything beyond this is thrown away on the individual, and had better be\r\nused for the multiplying of specimens. When man comes to ask something\r\nmore than germinating seeds from a plant, he must remove it from the\r\ncrowded clump, give it more light and air, _and feed it for product_. In\r\nother words, he must give it more nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash\r\nthan it can use for simple growth and maintenance, and thus make it\r\nburst forth into flower-or fruit-product. Nature produces the apple\r\ntree, but man must cultivate it and feed it if he would be fed and\r\ncomforted by it. People who neglect their orchards can get neither\r\npleasure nor profit from them, and such persons are not competent to sit\r\nin judgment upon the value of an apple tree. Only those who love,\r\nnourish, and profit by their orchards may come into the apple court and\r\nspeak with authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nTHE TIMOTHY HARVEST\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 25th, the children came home from their schools, and with\r\nthem came Jim Jarvis to spend the summer holidays. Our invitation to\r\nJarvis had been unanimous when he bade us good-by in the winter. Jack\r\nwas his chum, Polly had adopted him, I took to him from the first, and\r\nJane, in her shy way, admired him greatly. The boys took to farm life\r\nlike ducks to water. They were hot for any kind of work, and hot, too,\r\nfrom all kinds. I could not offer anything congenial until the timothy\r\nharvest in July. When this was on, they were happy and useful at the\r\nsame time,--a rare combination for boys.\r\n\r\nThe timothy harvest is attractive to all, and it would be hard to find a\r\nform of labor which contributes more to the æsthetic sense than does the\r\ngathering of this fragrant grass. At four o'clock on a fine morning,\r\nwith the barometer \"set fair,\" Thompson started the mower, and kept it\r\nhumming until 6.30, when Zeb, with a fresh team, relieved him. Zeb tried\r\nto cut a little faster than his father, but he was allowed no more\r\ntime. Promptly at nine he was called in, and there was to be no more\r\ncutting that day. At eleven o'clock the tedder was started, and in two\r\nhours the cut grass had been turned. At three o'clock the rake gathered\r\nit into windrows, from which it was rolled and piled into heaps, or\r\ncocks, of six hundred or eight hundred pounds each. The cutting of the\r\nmorning was in safe bunches before the dew fell, there to go through the\r\nprocess of sweating until ten o'clock the next day. It was then opened\r\nand fluffed out for four hours, after which all hands and all teams\r\nturned to and hauled it into the forage barn.\r\n\r\nThe grass that was cut one morning was safely housed as hay by the\r\nsecond night, if the weather was favorable; if not, it took little harm\r\nin the haycocks, even from foul weather. It is the sun-bleach that takes\r\nthe life out of hay.\r\n\r\nThis year we had no trouble in getting fifty tons of as fine timothy hay\r\nas horses could wish to eat or man could wish to see. We began to cut on\r\nTuesday, the 6th of July, and by Saturday evening the twenty-acre crop\r\nwas under cover. The boys blistered their hands with the fork handles,\r\nand their faces, necks, and arms with the sun's rays, and claimed to\r\nlike the work and the blisters. Indeed, tossing clean, fragrant hay is\r\nwork fit for a prince; and a man never looks to better advantage or more\r\npicturesque than when, redolent with its perfume, he slings a jug over\r\nthe crook in his elbow and listens to the gurgle of the home-made ginger\r\nale as it changes from jug to throat. There may be joys in other drinks,\r\nbut for solid comfort and refreshment give me a July hay-field at 3\r\nP.M., a jug of water at forty-eight degrees, with just the amount of\r\nmolasses, vinegar, and ginger that is Polly's secret, and I will give\r\ncards and spades to the broadest goblet of bubbles that was ever poured,\r\nand beat it to a standstill. Add to this a blond head under a broad hat,\r\na thin white gown, such as grasshoppers love, and you can see why the\r\nemptying of the jug was a satisfying function in our field; for Jane was\r\nthe one who presided at these afternoon teas. Often Jane was not alone;\r\nFlorence or Jessie, or both, or others, made hay while the sun shone in\r\nthose July days, and many a load went to the barn capped with white and\r\nlaughter. The young people decided that a hay farm would be ideal--no\r\nend better than a factory farm--and advised me to put all the land into\r\ntimothy and clover. I was not too old to see the beauties of\r\nhaying-time, with such voluntary labor; but I was too old and too much\r\ninterested with my experiment to be cajoled by a lot of youngsters. I\r\npromised them a week of haying in each fifty-two, but that was all the\r\nconcession I would make. Laura said:--\r\n\r\n\"We are commanded to make hay while the sun shines; and the sun always\r\nshines at Four Oaks, for me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was pretty of her to say that; but what else would one expect from\r\nLaura?\r\n\r\nThe twelve acres from which the fodder oats had been cut were ploughed\r\nand fitted for sugar beets and turnips. I was not at all certain that\r\nthe beets would do anything if sown so late, but I was going to try. Of\r\nthe turnips I could feel more certain, for doth not the poet say:--\r\n\r\n    \"The 25th day of July,\r\n    Sow your turnips, wet or dry\"?\r\n\r\nAs the 25th fell on Sunday, I tried to placate the agricultural poet by\r\nsowing half on the 24th and the other half on the 26th, but it was no\r\nuse. Whether the turnip god was offended by the fractured rule and\r\nrefused his blessing, or whether the dry August and September prevented\r\nfull returns, is more than I can say. Certain it is that I had but a\r\nhalf crop of turnips and a beggarly batch of beets to comfort me and the\r\nhogs.\r\n\r\nSome little consolation, however, was found in Polly's joy over a small\r\ncrop of currants which her yearling bushes produced. I also heard rumors\r\nof a few cherries which turned their red cheeks to the sun for one happy\r\nday, and then disappeared. Cock Robin's breast was red the next morning,\r\nand on this circumstantial evidence Polly accused him. He pleaded \"not\r\nguilty,\" and strutted on the lawn with his thumbs in the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat and his suspected breast as much in evidence as a pouter\r\npigeon's. A jury, mostly of blackbirds, found the charge \"not proven,\"\r\nand the case was dismissed. I was convinced by the result of this trial\r\nthat the only safe way would be to provide enough cherries for the birds\r\nand for the people too, and ordered fifty more trees for fall planting.\r\nI found by experience, that if one would have bird neighbors (and who\r\nwould not?), he must provide liberally for their wants and also for\r\ntheir luxuries. I have stolen a march as to the cherries by planting\r\nscores of mulberry trees, both native and Russian. Birds love mulberries\r\neven better than they do cherries, and we now eat our pies in peace. To\r\nmake amends for this ruse, I have established a number of drinking\r\nfountains and free baths; all of which have helped to make us friends.\r\n\r\nIn August I sold, near the top of a low market, 156 young hogs. At $4.50\r\nper hundred, the bunch netted me $1807. They did not weigh quite as much\r\nas those sold the previous autumn, and I found two ways of accounting\r\nfor this. The first and most probable was that fall pigs do not grow so\r\nfast as those farrowed in the spring. This is sufficient to account for\r\nthe fact that the herd average was twenty pounds lighter than that of\r\nits predecessor. I could not, however, get over the notion that\r\nAnderson's nervousness had in some way taken possession of the swine (we\r\nhave Holy Writ for a similar case), and that they were wasted in growth\r\nby his spirit of unrest. He was uniformly kind to them and faithful\r\nwith their food, but there was lacking that sense of cordial sympathy\r\nwhich should exist between hog and man if both would appear at their\r\nbest. Even when Anderson came to their pens reeking with the rich savor\r\nof the food they loved, their ears would prick up (as much as a Chester\r\nWhite's ears can), and with a \"woof!\" they would shoot out the door,\r\nonly to return in a moment with the greatest confidence. I never heard\r\nthat \"woof\" and saw the stampede without looking around for the \"steep\r\nplace\" and the \"sea,\" feeling sure that the incident lacked only these\r\naccessories to make it a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAnderson was good and faithful, and he would work his arms and legs off\r\nfor the pigs; but the spirit of unrest entered every herd which he kept,\r\nthough neither he nor I saw it clearly enough to go and \"tell it in the\r\ncity.\" With other swineherds my hogs averaged from fifteen to eighteen\r\npounds better than with faithful Anderson, and I am, therefore,\r\ncompetent to speak of the gross weight of the spirit of contentment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nSTRIKE AT GORDON'S MINE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Gordon owned a coal mine about six miles west of the village of\r\nExeter, and four miles from Four Oaks. A village called Gordonville had\r\nsprung up at the mouth of the mine. It was the home of the three hundred\r\nminers and their families,--mostly Huns, but with a sprinkling of\r\nCornishmen.\r\n\r\nThe houses were built by the owner of the mine, and were leased to the\r\nminers at a small yearly rental. They were modest in structure, but they\r\ncould be made inviting and neat if the occupants were thrifty. No one\r\nwas allowed to sell liquor on the property owned by the Gordons, but\r\noutside of this limit was a fringe of low saloons which did a thriving\r\nbusiness off the improvident miners.\r\n\r\nThere had never been a strike at Gordonville, and such a thing seemed\r\nimprobable, for Gordon was a kind master, who paid his men promptly and\r\nlooked after their interests more than is usual for a capitalist.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, a distinct surprise when the foreman of the mine\r\ntelephoned to Gordon one July morning that the men had struck work.\r\nGordon did not understand the reason of it, but he expressed himself as\r\nbeing heartily glad, for financial reasons, that the men had gone out.\r\nHe had more than enough coal on the surface and in cars to supply the\r\ndemand for the next three months, and it would be money in his pocket to\r\ndispose of his coal without having to pay for the labor of replacing it.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the reason for the strike was announced. From the\r\nestablishment of the mine it had been the custom for the miners to have\r\ntheir tools sharpened at a shop built and run by the property. This was\r\ndone for the accommodation of the men, and the charge for keeping the\r\ntools sharp was ten cents a week for each man, or $5 a year. For twenty\r\nyears no fault had been found with the arrangement; it had been looked\r\nupon as satisfactory, especially by the men. A walking delegate, mousing\r\naround the mine, and finding no other cause for complaint, had lighted\r\nupon this practice, and he told the men it was a shame that they should\r\nhave to pay ten cents a week out of their hard-earned wages for keeping\r\ntheir tools sharp. He said that it was the business of the property to\r\nkeep the tools sharp, and that the men should not be called upon to pay\r\nfor that service; that they ought, in justice to themselves and for the\r\ndignity of associated labor, to demand that this onerous tax be removed;\r\nand, to insure its removal, he declared a strike on. This was the\r\nreason, and the only reason, for the strike at Gordon's mine. Three\r\nhundred men quit work, and three hundred families suffered, many of them\r\nfor the necessities of life, simply because a loud-mouthed delegate\r\nassured them that they were being imposed upon.\r\n\r\nThings went on quietly at the mine. There was no riot, no disturbance.\r\nGordon did not go over, but simply telephoned to the superintendent to\r\nclose the shaft houses, shut down the engines, put out the fires, and\r\nlet things rest, at the same time saying that he would hold the\r\nsuperintendent and the bosses responsible for the safety of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe men were disappointed, as the days went by, that the owner made no\r\neffort to induce them to resume work. They had believed that he would at\r\nonce accede to their demand, and that they would go back to work with\r\nthe tax removed. This, however, was not his plan. Weeks passed and the\r\nmen became restless. They frequented the saloons more generally, spent\r\ntheir remaining money for liquor, and went into debt as much as they\r\nwere permitted for more liquor. They became noisy and quarrelsome. The\r\nfew men who were opposed to the strike could make no headway against\r\npublic opinion. These men held aloof from the saloons, husbanded their\r\nmoney, and confined themselves as much as possible to their own houses.\r\n\r\nThings had gone on in this way for six weeks. The men grew more and\r\nmore restless and more dissipated. Again the walking delegate came to\r\nencourage them to hold out. Mounted on an empty coal car, he made an\r\ninflammatory speech to the men, advising them not only to hold out\r\nagainst the owner, but also to prevent the employment of any other help.\r\nIf this should not prove sufficient, he advised them to wreck the mining\r\nproperty and to fire the mine,--anything to bring the owner to terms.\r\n\r\nJack and Jarvis went for a long walk one day, and their route took them\r\nnear Gordonville. Seeing the men collected in such numbers around a coal\r\ncar, they approached, and heard the last half of this inflammatory\r\nspeech. As the walking delegate finished, Jack jumped up on the car, and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"McGinnis has had his say; now, men, let me have mine. There are always\r\ntwo sides to a question. You have heard one, let me give you the other.\r\nI am a delegate, self-appointed, from the amalgamated Order of Thinkers,\r\nand I want you to listen to our view of this strike,--and of all\r\nstrikes. I want you also to think a little as well as to listen.\r\n\r\n\"You have been led into this position by a man whose sole business is to\r\nfoment discords between working-men and their employers. The moment\r\nthese discords cease, that moment this man loses his job and must work\r\nor starve like the rest of you. He is, therefore, an interested party,\r\nand he is more than likely to be biassed by what seems to be his\r\ninterest. He has made no argument; he has simply asserted things which\r\nare not true, and played upon your sympathies, emotions, and passions,\r\nby the use of the stale war-cries--'oppression,' 'down-trodden\r\nworking-man,' 'bloated bond-holders,' and, most foolish of all, 'the\r\nconflict between Capital and Labor.' You have not thought this matter\r\nout for yourselves at all. That is why I ask you to join hands for a\r\nlittle while with the Order of Thinkers and see if there is not some\r\ngood way out of this dilemma. McGinnis said that the Company has no\r\nright to charge you for keeping your tools sharp. In one sense this is\r\ntrue. You have a perfect right to work with dull tools, if you wish to;\r\nyou have the right to sharpen your own tools; and you also have the\r\nright to hire any one else to do it for you. You work 'by the ton,' you\r\nown your pickaxes and shovels from handle to blade, and you have the\r\nright to do with them as you please.\r\n\r\n\"There are three hundred of you who use tools; you each pay ten cents a\r\nweek to the Company for keeping them sharp,--that is, in round numbers,\r\n$1500 a year. There are two smiths at work at $50 a month (that is\r\n$1200), and a helper at $25 a month ($300 more), making just $1500 paid\r\nby the Company in wages. If you will think this matter out, you will see\r\nthat there is a dead loss to the Company of the coal used, the wear and\r\ntear of the instruments, and the interest, taxes, insurance, and\r\ndegeneration of the plant. Is the Company under obligation to lose this\r\nmoney for you? Not at all! The Company does this as an accommodation and\r\na gratuity to you, but not as a duty. Just as much coal would be taken\r\nfrom the Gordon mine if your tools were never sharpened, only it would\r\nrequire more men, and you would earn less money apiece. You could not\r\nget this sharpening done at private shops so cheaply, and you cannot do\r\nit yourselves. You have no more right to ask the Company to do this work\r\nfor nothing than you have to ask it to buy your tools for you. It would\r\nbe just as sensible for you to strike because the Company did not send\r\neach of you ten cents' worth of ice-cream every Sunday morning, as it is\r\nfor you to go out on this matter of sharpening tools.\r\n\r\n\"But, suppose the Company were in duty bound to do this thing for you,\r\nand suppose it should refuse; would that be a good reason for quitting\r\nwork? Not by any means! You are earning an average of $2 a day,--nearly\r\n$16,000 a month. You've 'been out' six weeks. If you gain your point, it\r\nwill take you fifteen years to make up what you've already lost. If you\r\nhave the sense which God gives geese, you will see that you can't afford\r\nthis sort of thing.\r\n\r\n\"But the end is not yet. You are likely to stay out six weeks longer,\r\nand each six weeks adds another fifteen years to your struggle to catch\r\nup with your losses. Is this a load which thinking people would impose\r\nupon themselves? Not much! You will lose your battle, for your strike is\r\nbadly timed. It seems to be the fate of strikes to be badly timed; they\r\nusually occur when, on account of hard times or over-supply, the\r\nemployers would rather stop paying wages than not. That's the case now.\r\nFour months of coal is in yards or on cars, and it's an absolute benefit\r\nto the Company to turn seventy or eighty thousand dollars of dead\r\nproduct into live money. Don't deceive yourselves with the hope that you\r\nare distressing the owner by your foolish strike; you are putting money\r\ninto his pockets while your families suffer for food. There is no great\r\nprinciple at stake to make your conduct seem noble and to call forth\r\nsympathy for your suffering,--only foolishness and the blind following\r\nof a demagogue whose living depends upon your folly.\r\n\r\n\"McGinnis talked to you about the conflict between capital and labor.\r\nThat is all rot. There is not and there cannot be such a conflict. Labor\r\nmakes capital, and without capital there would be no object in labor.\r\nThey are mutually dependent upon each other, and there can be no quarrel\r\nbetween them, for neither could exist after the death of the other. The\r\ncapitalist is only a laborer who has saved a part of his wages,\r\n--either in his generation or in some preceding one. Any man with a\r\nsound mind and a sound body can become a capitalist. When the laborer\r\nhas saved one dollar he is a capitalist,--he has money to lend at\r\ninterest or to invest in something that will bring a return. The second\r\ndollar is easier saved than the first, and every dollar saved is earning\r\nsomething on its own account. All persons who have money to invest or to\r\nlend are capitalists. Of course, some are great and some are small, but\r\nall are independent, for they have more than they need for immediate\r\npersonal use.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to tell you how you may all become capitalists; but first I\r\nwant to point out your real enemies. The employer is not your enemy,\r\ncapital is not your enemy, but the saloonkeeper is,--and the most deadly\r\nenemy you can possibly have. In that fringe of shanties over yonder live\r\nthe powers that keep you down; there are the foes that degrade you and\r\nyour families, forcing you to live little better than wild beasts. Your\r\nfood is poor, your clothing is in rags, your children are without shoes,\r\nyour homes are desolate, there are no schools and no social life. Year\r\nfollows year in dreary monotone, and you finally die, and your neighbors\r\nthrust you underground and have an end of you. Misery and wretchedness\r\nfill the measure of your days, and you are forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"This dull, brutish condition is self-imposed, and to what end? That\r\nsome dozen harpies may fatten on your flesh; that your labor may give\r\nthem leisure; that your suffering may give them pleasure; that your\r\nsweat may cool their brows, and your money fill their tills!\r\n\r\n\"What do you get in return? Whiskey, to poison your bodies and pervert\r\nyour minds; whiskey, to make you fierce beasts or dull brutes; whiskey,\r\nto make your eyes red and your hands unsteady; whiskey, to make your\r\nhomes sties and yourselves fit occupants for them; whiskey, to make you\r\nbeat your wives and children; whiskey, to cast you into the gutter, the\r\nmost loathsome animal in all the world. This is cheap whiskey, but it\r\ncosts you dear. All that makes life worth living, all that raises man\r\nabove the brute, and all the hope of a future life, are freely given for\r\nthis poor whiskey. The man who sells it to you robs you of your money\r\nand also of your manhood. You pay him ten times (often twenty times) as\r\nmuch as it cost him, and yet he poses as your friend.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to say anything against beer, for I don't think good beer\r\nis very likely to hurt a man. I will say this, however,--you pay more\r\nthan twice what it is worth. This is the point I would make: beer is a\r\nfood of some value, and it should be put on a food basis in price. It\r\nisn't more than half as valuable as milk, and it shouldn't cost more\r\nthan half as much. You can have good beer at three or four cents a\r\nquart, if you will let whiskey alone.\r\n\r\n\"I promised to tell you how to become capitalists, each and every one of\r\nyou, and I'll keep my word if you'll listen to me a little longer.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Jack had been speaking, some of the men had shown considerable\r\ninterest and had gradually crowded their way nearer to the boy. Thirty\r\nor forty Cornishmen and perhaps as many others of the better sort were\r\nclose to the car, and seemed anxious to hear what he had to say. Back of\r\nthese, however, were the large majority of the miners and the hangers-on\r\nat the saloons, who did not wish to hear, and did not mean that others\r\nshould hear, what the boy had to say. Led by McGinnis and the\r\nsaloon-keepers, they had kept up such a row that it had been impossible\r\nfor any one, except those quite near the car, to hear at all. Now they\r\ndetermined to stop the talk and to bounce the boy. They made a vigorous\r\nrush for the car with shouts and uplifted hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gigantic Cornishman mounted the car, and said, in a voice that could\r\neasily be heard above the shouting of the crowd:--\r\n\r\n\"Wait--wait a bit, men! The lad is a brave one, and ye maun own to that!\r\nThere be small 'urt in words, and mebbe 'e 'ave tole a bit truth. Me and\r\nme mates 'ere are minded to give un a chance. If ye men don't want to\r\n'ear 'im, you don't 'ave to stay; but don't 'e dare touchen with a\r\nfinger, or, by God! Tom Carkeek will kick the stuffin' out en 'e!\"\r\n\r\nThis was enough to prevent any overt act, for Tom Carkeek was the\r\nchampion wrestler in all that county; he was fiercer than fire when\r\nroused, and he would be backed by every Cornishman on the job.\r\n\r\nJack went on with his talk. \"The 'Order of Thinkers' claim that you men\r\nand all of your class spend one-third of your entire wages for whiskey\r\nand beer. There are exceptions, but the figures will hold good. I am\r\ngoing to call the amount of your wages spent in this way, one-fourth.\r\nThe yearly pay-roll of this mine is, in round numbers, $200,000. Fifty\r\nthousand of this goes into the hands of those harpies, who grow rich as\r\nyou grow poor. You are surprised at these figures, and yet they are too\r\nsmall. I counted the saloons over there, and I find there are eleven of\r\nthem. Divide $50,000 into eleven parts, and you would give each saloon\r\nless than $5000 a year as a gross business. Not one of those places can\r\nrun on the legitimate percentage of a business which does not amount to\r\nmore than that. Do you suppose these men are here from charitable\r\nmotives or for their health? Not at all. They are here to make money,\r\nand they do it. Five or six hundred dollars is all they pay for the vile\r\nstuff for which they charge you $5000. They rob you of manhood and money\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what would be the result if you struck on these robbers? I will\r\ntell you. In the first place, you would save $50,000 each year, and you\r\nwould be better men in every way for so doing. You would earn more\r\nmoney, and your children would wear shoes and go to school. That would\r\nbe much, and well worth while; but that is not the best of it. I will\r\nmake a proposition to you, and I will promise that it shall be carried\r\nout on my side exactly as I state it.\r\n\r\n\"This is a noble property. In ten years it has paid its owner\r\n$500,000,--$50,000 a year. It is sure to go on in this way under good\r\nmanagement. I offer, in the name of the owner, to bond this property to\r\nyou for $300,000 for five years at six per cent. Of course this is an\r\nunusual opportunity. The owner has grown rich out of it, and he is now\r\nwilling to retire and give others a chance. His offer to you is to sell\r\nthe mine for half its value, and, at the same time, to give you five\r\nyears in which to pay for it. I will add something to this proposition,\r\nfor I feel certain that he will agree to it. It is this: Mr. Gordon will\r\nbuild and equip a small brewery on this property, in which good,\r\nwholesome beer can be made for you at one cent a glass. You are to pay\r\nfor the brewery in the same way that you pay for the other property; it\r\nwill cost $25,000. This will make $325,000 which you are to pay during\r\nthe next five years. How? Let me tell you.\r\n\r\n\"The property will give you a net income of $40,000 or $50,000, and you\r\nwill save $50,000 more when you give up whiskey and get your beer for\r\nless than one-fourth of what it now costs you. The general store at\r\nwhich you have always traded will be run in your interests, and all that\r\nyou buy will be cheaper. The market will be a cooperative one, which\r\nwill furnish you meat, fattened on your own land, at the lowest price.\r\nYour fruit and vegetables will come from these broad acres, which will\r\nbe yours and will cost you but little. You will earn more money because\r\nyou will be sober and industrious, and your money will purchase more\r\nbecause you will deal without a middleman. You will be better clothed,\r\nbetter fed, and better men. Your wives will take new interest in life,\r\nand there will be carpets on your floors, curtains at your windows,\r\nvegetables behind your cottages, and flowers in front of them.\r\n\r\n\"All these things you will have with the money you are now earning, and\r\nat the same time you will be changing from the laborer to the\r\ncapitalist. The mine gives you a profit of $40,000, and you save\r\none-fourth of your wages, which makes $50,000 more,--$90,000 in all.\r\nWhat are you to do with this? Less than $20,000 will cover the interest.\r\nYou will have $70,000 to pay on the principal. This will reduce the\r\ninterest for the next year more than $3000. Each year you can do as\r\nwell, and by the time the five years have passed you will own the mine,\r\nthe land, the brewery, the store, the market, and this blessed\r\nblacksmith shop about which you have had so much fuss, and also a bank\r\nwith a paid-up capital of $50,000. You are capitalists, every one of\r\nyou, at the end of five years, if you wish to be, and if you are willing\r\nto give up the single item,--whiskey.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like the plan? Do you like the prospect? Turn it over and see\r\nwhat objections you can find. If you are willing to go into it, come\r\nover to Four Oaks some day and we will go more into details. McGinnis\r\ngave you one side of the picture: I have given you the other. You are at\r\nliberty to follow whichever you please.\"\r\n\r\nJack and Jarvis jumped off the car and struck out for home. Carkeek and\r\nhis Cornishmen followed the lads until they were well clear of the\r\nvillage, to protect them, and then Carkeek said:--\"Me and the others\r\nlike for to hear 'e talk, mister, and we like for to 'ear 'e talk more.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Goliath,\" said Jack. \"Come over any time and we'll make\r\nplans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nTHE RIOT\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later the boys, returning from the city, were met by Jane and\r\nJessie in the big carriage to be driven home. Halfway to Four Oaks the\r\ncarriage suddenly halted, and a confused murmur of angry voices gave\r\nwarning of trouble. Jack opened the door and stood upon the step.\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen or twenty drunken miners block the way,--they are holding the\r\nhorses,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Let me out; I'll soon clear the road,\" said Jarvis, trying to force his\r\nway past Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Sit still, Hercules; I am slower to wrath than you are. Let me talk to\r\nthem,\" and Jack took three or four steps forward, followed closely by\r\nJarvis.\r\n\r\n\"Well, men, what do you want? There is no good in stopping a carriage on\r\nthe highroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want work and money and bread,\" said a great bearded Hun who was\r\nnearest to Jack.\r\n\r\n\"This is no way to get either. We have no work to offer, there is no\r\nbread in the carriage, and not much money. You are dead wrong in this\r\nbusiness, and you are likely to get into trouble. I can make some\r\nallowance when I remember the bad whiskey that is in you, but you must\r\nget out of our way; the road is public and we have the right to use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not until you have paid toll,\" said the Hun.\r\n\r\n\"That's the rooster who said we drank whiskey and didn't work. He's the\r\nfellow who would rob a poor man of his liberty,\" came a voice in the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\"Knock his block off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Break his back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me at him,\" and a score of other friendly offers came from the\r\ndrunken crowd.\r\n\r\nJack stood steadily looking at the ruffians, his blue eyes growing black\r\nwith excitement and his hands clenched tightly in the pockets of his\r\nreefer.\r\n\r\n\"Slowly, men, slowly,\" said he. \"If you want me, you may have me. There\r\nare ladies in the carriage; let them go on; I'll stay with you as long\r\nas you like. You are brave men, and you have no quarrel with ladies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ladies, eh!\" said the Hun, \"ladies! I never saw anything but _women_.\r\nLet's have a look at them, boys.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was drunkenly approved, and the men pressed forward. Jack\r\nstood firm, his face was white, but his eyes flamed.\r\n\r\n\"Stand off! There are good men who will die for those ladies, and it\r\nwill go hard but bad men shall die first.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hun disregarded the warning.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have a look into--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" said the slow-of-wrath Jack, and his fist went straight from the\r\nshoulder and smote the Hun on the point of the jaw. It was a terrible\r\nblow, dealt with all the force of a trained athlete, and inspired by\r\nevery impulse which a man holds dear; and the half-drunken brute fell\r\nlike a stricken ox. Catching the club from the falling man, Jack made a\r\nsudden lunge forward at the face of the nearest foe.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jim!\" he shouted, as the full fever of battle seized him. His\r\nforward lunge had placed another miner _hors de combat_, and Jarvis\r\nsprang forward and secured the wounded man's bludgeon.\r\n\r\n\"Back to back, Jack, and mind your guard!\"\r\n\r\nThe odds were eighteen to two against the young men, but they did not\r\nheed them. Back to back they stood, and the heavy clubs were like\r\nfeathers in their strong hands. Their skill at \"single stick\" was of\r\nimmense advantage, for it built a wall of defence around them. The\r\ncrazy-drunk miners rushed upon them with the fierceness of wild beasts;\r\nthey crowded in so close as to interfere with their own freedom of\r\nmovement; they sought to overpower the two men by weight of numbers and\r\nby showers of blows. Jack and Jim were kept busy guarding their own\r\nheads, and it was only occasionally that they could give an aggressive\r\nblow. When these opportunities came, they were accepted with fierce\r\ndelight, and a miner fell with a broken head at every blow. Two fell in\r\nfront of Jack and three went down under Jarvis's club. The battle had\r\nnow lasted several minutes, and the strain on the young men was telling\r\non their wind; they struck as hard and parried as well as at first, but\r\nthey were breathing rapidly. The young men cheered each other with\r\njoyous words; they felt no need of aid.\r\n\r\n\"Beats football hollow!\" panted Jarvis.\r\n\r\n\"Go in, old man! you're a dandy full-back!\" came between strokes from\r\nJack.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the boys for a minute and see what the girls are doing.\r\nWhen Jarvis got out of the carriage, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Lars, if there is trouble here, you drive on as soon as you can get\r\nyour horses clear. Never mind us; we'll walk home. Get the ladies to\r\nFour Oaks as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the battle began, the miners left the horses to attack the men.\r\nThis gave a clear road, and Lars was ready to drive on, but the girls\r\nwere not in the carriage. They had sprung out in the excitement of the\r\nfirst sound of blows; and now stood watching with glowing eyes and white\r\nfaces the prowess of their champions. For minutes they watched the\r\nconflict with fear and pride combined. When seven or eight minutes had\r\npassed and the champions had not slain all their enemies, some degree of\r\nterror arose in the minds of the young ladies,--terror lest their\r\nknights be overpowered by numbers or become exhausted by slaying,--and\r\nthey looked about for aid. Lars, remembering what Jarvis had said, urged\r\nthe ladies to get into the carriage and be driven out of danger. They\r\nrepelled his advice with scorn. Jane said:--\"I won't stir a step until\r\nthe men can go with us!\"\r\n\r\nJessie said never a word, but she darted forward toward the fighting\r\nmen, stooped, picked up a fallen club, and was back in an instant.\r\nMounting quickly to the box, she said:--\"I can hold the horses. Don't\r\nyou think you can help the men, Lars?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to try, miss,\" and the coachman's coat was off in a trice and\r\nthe club in his hand. He was none too soon!\r\n\r\nJane, who had mounted the box with Jessie, cried, \"Look out, Jack!\"\r\njust as a heavy stone crashed against the back of his head. Some brute\r\nin the crowd had sent it with all his force. The stone broke through the\r\nDerby hat and opened a wide gash in Jack's scalp, and sent him to the\r\nground with a thousand stars glittering before his eyes. Jane gave a sob\r\nand covered her eyes. Jessie swayed as though she would fall, but she\r\nnever took her eyes from the fallen man; her lips moved, but she said\r\nnothing; and her face was ghastly white. Jarvis heard the dull thud\r\nagainst Jack's head and knew that he was falling. Whirling swiftly, he\r\nstopped a savage blow that was aimed at the stricken man, and with a\r\nback-handed cut laid the striker low.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Jack; keep down till the stars are gone.\" He stood with one\r\nsturdy leg on each side of Jack's body and his big club made a charmed\r\ncircle about him. It was not more than twenty seconds before the wheels\r\nwere out of Jack's head and he was on his feet again, though not quite\r\nsteady.\r\n\r\nJack's fall had given courage to the gang, and they made a furious\r\nattack upon Jarvis, who was now alone and not a little impeded by the\r\nfriend at his feet. As Jack struggled to his legs, a furious blow\r\ndirected at him was parried by Jarvis's left arm,--his right being busy\r\nguarding his own head. The blow was a fearful one; it broke the small\r\nbone in the forearm, beat down the guard, and came with terrible force\r\nupon poor Jack's left shoulder, disabling it for a minute. At the same\r\ntime Jarvis received a nasty blow across the face from an unexpected\r\nquarter. He was staggered by it, but he did not fall. Jack's right arm\r\nwas good and very angry; a savage jab with his club into the face of the\r\nman who had struck Jarvis laid him low, and Jack grinned with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThings were going hard with the young men. They had, indeed,\r\ndisqualified nine of the enemy; but there were still eight or ten more,\r\nand through hard work and harder knocks they had lost more than half\r\ntheir own fighting strength. At this rate they would be used up\r\ncompletely while there were still three or four of the enemy on foot.\r\nThis was when they needed aid, and aid came.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Lars found himself at liberty and with a club in his hands\r\nthan he began to use it with telling effect. He attacked the outer\r\ncircle, striking every head he could reach, and such was his\r\nsprightliness that four men fell headlong before the others became aware\r\nof this attack from the rear. This diversion came at the right moment,\r\nand proved effective. There were now but six of the enemy in fighting\r\ncondition, and these six were more demoralized by the sudden and unknown\r\nelement of a rear attack than by the loss of their thirteen comrades.\r\nThey hesitated, and half turned to look, and two of them fell under the\r\nblows of Jack and Jarvis. As the rest turned to escape, the Swede's club\r\nfelled one, and the other three ran for dear life. They did not escape,\r\nhowever, for the long legs of the young men were after them. Young blood\r\nis hot, and the savage fight that had been forced upon these boys had\r\naroused all that was savage in them. In an instant they overtook two of\r\nthe fleeing men, but neither could strike an enemy in the back. Throwing\r\naside their clubs, each seized his enemy by the shoulder, turned him\r\nface to face and smote him sore, each after his fashion. Then they\r\nlaughed, took hold of hands, and walked wearily back to the carriage.\r\nJarvis's face was covered with blood, and Jack's neck and shoulders were\r\ndrenched,--his wound had bled freely. Lars had relieved the ladies on\r\nthe box after administering kicks and blows in generous measure to the\r\ndazed and crippled miners, who were crawling off the road or staggering\r\nalong it. The Swede had a strain of fierce North blood which was not\r\neasily laid when once aroused, and he glared around the battle-field,\r\nhoping to find signs of resistance. When none were to be seen, he donned\r\nhis coachman's coat and sat the box like a sphinx.\r\n\r\nThe girls went quickly forward to meet the men. They said little, but\r\nthey put their hands on their battered champions in a way to make the\r\nheart of man glad. The men were flushed and proud, as men have been, and\r\nmen will be, through all time, when they have striven savagely against\r\nother savages in the sight of their mistresses, and have gained the\r\nvictory. Their bruises were numb with exultation and their wounds dumb\r\nwith pride. There was no regret for blows given or received,--no\r\nsympathy for fallen foe. The male fights, in the presence of the female,\r\nwith savage delight, from the lowest to the highest ranks of creation,\r\nand we must forgive our boys for some cruel exultation as they looked on\r\nthe field of strife. Better feelings will come when the blood flows less\r\nrapidly in their veins!\r\n\r\n\"We must hurry home,\" said Jane, \"and let papa mend you.\" Then she\r\nburst into tears. \"Oh, I am so sorry and so frightened! Do you feel\r\n_very_ bad, Jack? I know you are suffering dreadfully, Mr. Jarvis. Can't\r\nI do something for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My arm is bruised a bit,\" said Jarvis; \"if you don't mind, you can\r\nsteady it a little.\"\r\n\r\nJane's soft hands clasped themselves tenderly over Jarvis's great fist,\r\nand she felt relieved in the thought that she was doing something for\r\nher hero. She held the great right hand of Hercules tenderly, and Jarvis\r\nnever let her know that it was the _left_ arm that had been broken. She\r\nfelt certain that he must be suffering agony, for ever and anon his\r\nfingers would close over hers with a spasmodic grip that sent a thrill\r\nof mixed joy and pain to her heart.\r\n\r\nWhile I was bandaging the broken arm I saw the young lady going through\r\nsome pantomimic exercises with her hands, as if seeking to revive the\r\nmemory of some previous position; then her face blazed with a light,\r\nhalf pleasure and half shame, and she disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage arrived at Four Oaks, the story was told in few words,\r\nand I immediately set to work to \"mend\" the boys. Jack insisted that\r\nJarvis should receive the first attention, and, indeed, he looked the\r\nworse. But after washing the blood off his face, I found that beyond a\r\nsevere bruise, which would disfigure him for a few days, his face and\r\nhead were unhurt. His arm was broken and badly contused. After I had\r\nattended to it, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, I'm as good as new; hope Jack is no worse.\"\r\n\r\nI carefully washed the blood off Jack's head and neck, and found an ugly\r\nscalp wound at least three inches long. It made me terribly anxious\r\nuntil I fairly proved that the bone was uninjured. After giving the boy\r\nthe tonsure, I put six stitches into the scalp, and he never said a\r\nword. Perhaps the cause of this fortitude could be found in the blazing\r\neyes of Jessie Gordon, which fixed his as a magnet, while her hands\r\nclasped his tightly. Miss Jessie was as white as snow, but there was no\r\ntremor in hand or eye. When it was all over, her voice was steady and\r\nlow as she said:--\r\n\r\n\"Jack Williams, in the olden days men fought for women, and they were\r\ncalled knights. It was counted a noble thing to take peril in defence of\r\nthe helpless. I find no record of more knightly deed than you have done\r\nto-day, and I know that no knight could have done it more nobly. I want\r\nyou to wear this favor on your hand.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed his hand and left the room. Jack didn't seem to mind the\r\nwound in his head, but he gave great attention to his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nTHE RESULT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first report of the battle reached me, I telephoned to\r\nBill Jackson, asking him to come at once to Four Oaks and to bring a man\r\nwith him. When he arrived, attended by his big Irishman, my men had\r\nalready put one of the farm teams to a great farm wagon, and had filled\r\nthe box nearly full of hay. We gave Jackson a hurried account of the\r\nfight and asked him to go at once and offer relief to the wounded,--if\r\nsuch relief were needed. Jackson was willing enough to go, but he was\r\ngreatly disappointed that he had missed the fight; it seemed unnatural\r\nthat there should be a big fight in his neighborhood and he not in it.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give a ten-acre lot to have been with you, lads,\" said the big\r\nfarmer as he started off.\r\n\r\nWord had been sent to Dr. High to be ready to care for some broken\r\nheads. Two hours later I drove to the Inn at Exeter and found the doctor\r\njust commencing the work of repair. Thirteen men had been brought in by\r\nthe wagon, twelve of them more or less cut and bruised about the head,\r\nand all needing some surgical attention. The thirteenth man was stone\r\ndead. A terrific blow on the back of the head had crushed his skull as\r\nif it had been an egg-shell, and he must have died instantly. After\r\nlooking this poor fellow over to make sure that there was no hope for\r\nhim, we turned our attention to the wounded. The barn had been turned\r\ninto a hospital, and in two hours we had a dozen sore heads well cared\r\nfor, and their owners comfortably placed for the night on soft hay\r\ncovered by blankets from the Inn. Mrs. French brought tea and gruels for\r\nthe thirsty, feverish fellows, and we placed Otto and the big Irishman\r\non duty as nurses for the night. The coroner had been summoned, and\r\narrived as we finished our work. He was an energetic official, and lost\r\nno time in getting a jury of six to listen to the statements which the\r\nwounded men would give. To their credit be it said that every one who\r\ngave testimony at all, gave it to the effect that the miners were\r\ncrazy-drunk, that they stopped the carriage, provoked the fight, and did\r\ntheir utmost to disable or destroy the enemy. The coroner would listen\r\nto no further testimony, but gave the case to the jury. In five minutes\r\ntheir verdict was returned, \"justifiable and commendable homicide by\r\nperson unknown to the jury.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of a fight and the death of a miner had reached Gordonville,\r\nwhere it created intense excitement. By the time the inquest was over a\r\ncrowd of at least fifty miners had collected near the barn. Much\r\ngrumbling and some loud threats were heard. Jackson took it upon himself\r\nto meet these angry men, and no one could have done better. Stepping\r\nupon a box which raised him a foot or two above the crowd, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"See here, fellows, I want to say a word to you. My name's Jackson--Bill\r\nJackson; perhaps some of you know me. If you don't, I'll introduce\r\nmyself. I wasn't in this fight,--worse luck for me! but I am wide open\r\nfor engagements in that line. Some one inside said that this gang must\r\nbe conciliated, and I thought I would come out and do it. I understand\r\nthat you feel sore over this affair,--it's natural that you should,--but\r\nyou must remember that those boys out at Four Oaks couldn't accommodate\r\nall of you. If you wouldn't mind taking me for a substitute, I'll do my\r\nlevel best to make it lively for you. You don't need cards of\r\nintroduction to me; you needn't be American citizens; you needn't speak\r\nEnglish; all you have to do is to put up your hands or cock your hats,\r\nand I'll know what you mean. If any of you thinks he hasn't had his\r\nshare of what's been going on this afternoon, he may just call on Bill\r\nJackson for the balance. I want to conciliate you if I can! I'm a\r\ngood-tempered man, and not the kind to pick a quarrel; but if any of you\r\nlow-lived dogs are looking for a fight, I'm not the man to disappoint\r\nyou! I came out here to satisfy you in this matter and to send you home\r\ncontented, and, by the jumping Jews! I'll do it if I have to break the\r\nhead of every dog's son among you! They told me to speak gently to you,\r\nand by thunder, I've done it; but now I'm going to say a word for\r\nmyself!\r\n\r\n\"A lot of your dirty crowd attacked two of the decentest men in the\r\ncounty when they were riding with ladies; one of the gang got killed and\r\nthe rest got their skulls cracked. Would these boys fight for the girls\r\nthey had with them? Hell's blazes! I'll fight for just thinking of it!\r\nJust one of you duffers say 'boo' to me! I'm going right through you!\"\r\n\r\nJackson sprang into the crowd, which parted like water before a strong\r\nswimmer. He cocked his hat, smacked his fists, and invited any or all to\r\nstand up to him. He was crazy for a fight, to get even with Jack and\r\nJarvis; but no one was willing to favor him. He marched through the gang\r\nlengthways, crossways, and diagonally, but to no purpose. In great\r\ndisgust he returned to the barn and reported that the crowd would not be\r\n\"conciliated.\" When we left, however, there were no miners to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt was after one o'clock in the morning when I reached home. Going\r\ndirectly to the room occupied by the boys, I met Polly on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you've come,\" said she, \"for I can't do a thing with those\r\nboys; they are too wild for any use.\"\r\n\r\nEntering the room, I found the lads in bed, but hilarious. They had\r\nsent for Lars and had filled him full of hot stuff and commendation. He\r\nwas sitting on the edge of a chair between the two beds, his honest eyes\r\nbulging and his head rolling from the effects of unusual potations. The\r\nlads had tasted the cup, too, but lightly; their high spirits came from\r\nother sources. Victories in war and in love deserve celebration; and\r\nwhen the two are united, a bit of freedom must be permitted. They sat\r\nbolt upright against the heads of their beds with flushed faces and\r\nshining eyes. They shouted Greek and Latin verse at the bewildered\r\nSwede; they gave him the story of Lars Porsena in the original, and then\r\nin bad Swedish. They called him Lars Porsena,--for had he not fought\r\ngallantly? Then he was Gustavus Adolphus,--for had he not come to the\r\naid of the Protestants when they were in sore need? And then things got\r\nmixed and the \"Royal Swede\" was Lars Adolphus or Gustavus Porsena Viking\r\nall in one. The honest fellow was more than half crazed by strong\r\nwaters, incomprehensible words, and \"jollying up\" which the young chaps\r\nhad given him.\r\n\r\n\"See here, boys, don't you see that you're sending your noble Swede to\r\nhis Lutzen before his time,--not dead, indeed, but dead drunk? This\r\nisn't the sort of medicine for either of you; you should have been\r\nasleep three hours ago. I'll take your last victim home.\"\r\n\r\nWe heard no more from any of the fighters until nine in the morning. In\r\nlooking them over I found that the Swede had as sore a head as either of\r\nthe others, though he had never taken a blow.\r\n\r\nMany friends came to see the boys during the days of their seclusion, to\r\ncongratulate them on their fortunate escape, and to compliment them on\r\ntheir skill and courage. The lads enjoyed being made much of, and their\r\nconvalescence was short and cheerful. Of course Sir Tom was the most\r\nconstant and most enthusiastic visitor. The warm-hearted Irishman loved\r\nthe boys always, but now he seemed to venerate them. The successful club\r\nfight appealed to his national instincts as nothing else could have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"With twenty years off and a shillalah in me hand I would have been\r\nproud to stand with you. By the Lord, I'm asking too much! I'll yield\r\nthe twenty years and only ask for the stick!\" And his cane went whirling\r\naround his head, now guarding, now striking, and now with elaborate\r\nflourishes, after the most approved Donny-brook fashion.\r\n\r\n\"But, me friend Jarvis, what is this you have on your face? Pond's\r\nExtract! Oh, murder! What is the world coming to when fresh beef and\r\nusquebaugh are crowded to the wall by bad-smelling water! Look at me\r\nnose; it is as straight as God made it, and yet many a time it has been\r\nknocked to one side of me face or spread all over me features. Nothing\r\nbut whiskey and raw beef could ever coax it back! It's God's mercy if\r\nyou are not deformed for life, me friend. Such privileges are not to be\r\nneglected with impunity. Let me bathe your face with whiskey and put a\r\nbeef-steak poultice after it, and I'll have you as handsome as a girl in\r\nthree days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the steak and whiskey inside and I'll feel handsome at once,\"\r\nsaid Jarvis.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the rashness of youth!\" said Sir Tom. \"But I'll not say a word\r\nagainst it. Youth is the greatest luck in the world, and I'll not copper\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then our sporting friend grew reminiscent and told of a time at\r\nLimmer's when the marquis and he occupied beds in the same room, not\r\nunlike our boys' room--only smoky and dingy--and poulticed their\r\nbattered faces with beef, and used usquebaugh inside and outside, after\r\nten friendly rounds.\r\n\r\n\"Queensbary's nose never resumed entirely after that night, but mine\r\ncame back like rubber. Maybe it was the beef--maybe it was usquebaugh;\r\nme own preference is in favor of the latter.\"\r\n\r\nSir Tom came every day so long as the boys were confined to the place,\r\nand each day he was able to develop some new incident connected with the\r\nbattle which called for applause. After hearing Lars tell his story for\r\nthe fourth time, he gave him a ten-dollar note, saying:--\r\n\r\n\"You did nobly for a Swede, Mr. Gustavus Adolphus, but I would give ten\r\ntenners to have had your place and your shillalah,--a Swede for a\r\nmatch-lock, but an Irishman for a stick.\"\r\n\r\nJack had hardly recovered when he was waited on by a committee from the\r\nmine with a request that he would make another speech. He was asked to\r\nmake good his offer of bonding the property, and also to formulate a\r\nplan of cooperation for the guidance of the men. Jack had the plans for\r\na cooperative mining village well digested, and was anxious to get them\r\nbefore the miners. As soon as he was fit he went to Gordonville to try\r\nto organize the work. Jarvis of course went with him, and Bill Jackson\r\nand Sir Tom would not be denied; they did not say so, but they looked as\r\nif they thought some diversion might be found. In spite of the influence\r\nof strong whiskey, however, the meeting passed off peacefully. The\r\nresults that grew from this effort at reformation were so great and so\r\nfar-reaching that they deserve a book for their narration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nDEEP WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor sharp contrasts give me the dull country. The unexpected is the\r\nusual in small and in great things alike as they happen on a farm, and I\r\nmake no apology to the reader for entering them in my narrative. I only\r\nask him, if he be a city man, to take my word for the truth as to the\r\ngeneral facts. To some elaboration and embellishment I plead guilty, but\r\nthe groundwork is truth, and the facts stated are as real as the\r\nfoundations of my buildings or the cows in my stalls. If the fortunate\r\nreader be a country man, he will need no assurance from me, for his eyes\r\nhave seen and his ears have heard the strange and startling episodes\r\nwith which the quiet country-side is filled. I do not dare record all\r\nthe adventures which clustered around us at Four Oaks. People who know\r\nonly the monotonous life of cities would not believe the half if told,\r\nand I do not wish to invite discredit upon my story of the making of the\r\nfactory farm.\r\n\r\nThe incidents I have given of the strike at Gordon's mine are\r\nsubstantially correct, and I would love to follow them to their\r\nsequel,--the coöperative mine; but as that is a story by itself, I\r\ncannot do it now. I promise myself, however, the pleasure of writing a\r\nhistory of this innovation in coal-mining at an early date. It is worth\r\nthe world's knowing that a copartnership can exist between three hundred\r\nequal partners without serious friction, and that community in business\r\ninterests on a large scale can be successfully managed without any\r\neffort to control personal liberty, either domestic, social, or\r\nreligious. Indeed, I believe the success of this experiment is due\r\nlargely to the absence of any attempt to superintend the private\r\ninterests of its members,--the only bond being a common financial one,\r\nand the one requisite to membership, ability to save a portion of the\r\nwages earned.\r\n\r\nBut to go back to farm matters. In August the ground was stirred for the\r\nsecond time around the young trees. To do this, the mulch was turned\r\nback and the surface for a space of three feet all around the tree was\r\nloosened by hoe or mattock, and the mulch was then returned. The trees\r\nwere vigorous, and their leaves had the polish of health, in spite of\r\nthe dry July and August. The mulching must receive the credit for much\r\nof this thrift, for it protected the soil from the rays of the sun and\r\ninvited the deep moisture to rise toward the surface. Few people realize\r\nthe amount of water that enters into the daily consumption of a tree. It\r\nis said that the four acres of leaf surface of a large elm will\r\ntranspire or yield to evaporation eight tons of water in a day, and that\r\nit takes more than five hundred tons of water to produce one ton of hay,\r\nwheat, oats, or other crop. This seems enormous; but an inch of rain on\r\nan acre of ground means more than a hundred tons of water, and\r\nprecipitation in our part of the country is about thirty-six inches per\r\nannum, so that we can count on over thirty-six hundred tons of water per\r\nacre to supply this tremendous evaporation of plant life.\r\n\r\nWater-pot and hose look foolish in the face of these figures; indeed,\r\nthey are poor makeshifts to keep life in plants during pinching times. A\r\nmuch more effective method is to keep the soil loose under a heavy\r\nmulch, for then the deep waters will rise. In our climate the tree's\r\ngrowth for the year is practically completed by July 15, and fortunately\r\ndry times rarely occur so early. We are, therefore, pretty certain to\r\nget the wood growth, no matter how dry the year, since it would take\r\nseveral years of unusual drought to prevent it. Of course the wood is\r\nnot all that we wish for in fruit trees; the fruit is the main thing,\r\nand to secure the best development of it an abundant rainfall is needed\r\nafter the wood is grown. If the rain doesn't come in July and August,\r\nheavy mulching must be the fruit-grower's reliance, and a good one it\r\nwill prove if the drought doesn't continue more than one year. After\r\nJuly the new wood hardens and gets ready for the trying winter. If July\r\nand August are very wet, growth may continue until too late for the wood\r\nto harden, and it consequently goes into winter poorly prepared to\r\nresist its rigors. The result is a killing back of the soft wood, but\r\nusually no serious loss to the trees. The effort to stimulate late\r\nsummer growth by cultivation and fertilization is all wrong; use manures\r\nand fertilizers freely from March until early June, but not later. The\r\nfall mulch of manure, if used, is more for warmth than for fertility; it\r\nis a blanket for the roots, but much of its value is leached away by the\r\nsuns and rains of winter.\r\n\r\nI felt that I had made a mistake in not sowing a cover crop in my\r\norchard the previous year. There are many excellent reasons for the\r\ncover crop and not one against it. The first reason is that it protects\r\nthe land from the rough usage and wash of winter storms; the second,\r\nthat it adds humus to the soil; and the third, if one of the legumes is\r\nused, that it collects nitrogen from the air, stores it in each knuckle\r\nand joint, and holds it there until it is liberated by the decay of the\r\nplant. As nitrogen is the most precious of plant foods, and as the\r\nnitrate beds and deposits are rapidly becoming exhausted, we must look\r\nto the useful legumes to help us out until the scientists shall be able\r\nto fix the unlimited but volatile supply which the atmosphere contains,\r\nand thus to remove the certain, though remote, danger of a nitrogen\r\nfamine. That this will be done in the near future by electric forces,\r\nand with such economy as to make the product available for agricultural\r\npurposes, is reasonably sure. In the meantime we must use the vetches,\r\npeas, beans, and clovers which are such willing workers.\r\n\r\nThe legumes fulfil the three requisites of the cover crop: protection,\r\nhumus, and the storing of nitrogen. That was why, when the corn in the\r\norchard was last cultivated in July, I planted cow peas between the\r\nrows. The peas made a fair growth in spite of the dry season, and after\r\nthe corn was cut they furnished fine pasture for the brood sows, that\r\nate the peas and trampled down the vines. In the spring ploughing this\r\nblack mat was turned under, and with it went a store of fertility to\r\nfatten the land. Cow peas were sowed in all the corn land in 1897, and\r\nthe rule of the farm is to sow corn-fields with peas, crimson clover, or\r\nsome other leguminous plant. As my land is divided almost equally each\r\nyear between corn and oats, which follow each other, it gets a cover\r\ncrop turned under every two years over the whole of it. Great quantities\r\nof manure are hauled upon the oat stubble in the early spring, and these\r\nfields are planted to corn, while the corn stubble is fertilized by the\r\ncover crop, and oats are sown. The land is taxed heavily every year, but\r\nit increases in fertility and crop-making capacity. For the past two\r\nyears my oats have averaged forty-seven bushels and my corn nearly\r\nsixty-eight bushels per acre. There is no waste land in my fields, and\r\nwe have made such a strenuous fight against weeds that they no longer\r\nseriously tax the land. The wisdom of the work done on the fence rows is\r\nnow apparent. The ploughing and seeding made it easy to keep the brush\r\nand weeds down; hay gathered close to the fences more than pays us for\r\nthe mowing; and we have no tall weed heads to load the wind with seeds.\r\nThis is a matter which is not sufficiently considered by the majority of\r\nfarmers, for weeds are allowed to tax the land almost as much as crops\r\ndo, and yet they pay no rent. Fence lines and corners are usually\r\nbreeding beds for these pests, and it will pay any landowner to suppress\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nDOGS AND HORSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was definitely decided in August that Jane was not to go back to\r\nFarmington. We had all been of two minds over this question, and it was\r\na comfort to have it settled, though I always suspect that my share of\r\nit was not beyond the suspicion of selfishness.\r\n\r\nJane was just past nineteen. She had a fair education, so far as books\r\ngo, and she did not wish to graduate simply for the honor of a diploma.\r\nIndeed, there were many studies between her and the diploma which she\r\nloathed. She could never understand how a girl of healthy mind could\r\ncare for mathematics, exact science, or dead languages. English and\r\nFrench were enough for her tongue, and history, literature, and\r\nmetaphysics enough for her mind.\r\n\r\n\"I can learn much more from the books in your library and from the dogs\r\nand horses than I can at school, besides being a thousand times happier;\r\nand oh, Dad, if you will let me have a forge and workshop, I will make\r\nno end of things.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a new idea to me, and I looked into it with some interest. I\r\nknew that Jane was deft with her fingers, but I did not know that she\r\nhad a special wish to cultivate this deftness or to put it to practical\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\"What can you do with a forge?\" said I. \"You can't shoe the horses or\r\nsharpen the ploughs. Can you make nails? They are machine-made now, and\r\nyou couldn't earn ten cents a week, even at horse-shoe nails.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to make nails, Dad; I want to work in copper and brass,\r\nand iron, too, but in girl fashion. Mary Town has a forge in Hartford,\r\nand I spent lots of Saturdays with her. She says that I am cleverer than\r\nshe is, but of course she was jollying me, for she makes beautiful\r\nthings; but I can learn, and it's great fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of things does this young lady make, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lamp-shades, paper-knives, hinges, bag-tops, buckles, and lots of\r\nthings. She could sell them, too, if she had to. It's like learning a\r\ntrade, Dad.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, child, you shall have a forge, if you will agree not to burn\r\nyourself up. Do you roll up your sleeves and wear a leather apron?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course, just like a blacksmith; only mine will be of soft brown\r\nleather and pinked at the edges.\"\r\n\r\nSo Jane was to have her forge. We selected a site for it at once in the\r\ngrove to the east of the house and about 150 yards away, and set the\r\ncarpenter at work. The shop proved to be a feature of the place, and\r\nsoon became a favorite resort for old and young for five o'clock teas\r\nand small gossiping parties. The house was a shingled cottage, sixteen\r\nby thirty-two, divided into two rooms. The first room, sixteen by\r\ntwenty, was the company room, but it contained a work bench as well as\r\nthe dainty trappings of a girl's lounging room. In the centre of the\r\nwall that separated the rooms was a huge brick chimney, with a fireplace\r\nin the front room and a forge bed in the rear room, which was the forge\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must charge the $460 which this outfit cost to the farm\r\naccount and pay yearly interest on it, for it is a fixture; but I\r\nprotest that it is not essential to the construction of a factory farm,\r\nand it may be omitted by those who have no daughter Jane.\r\n\r\nThere were other things hinging on Jane's home-staying which made me\r\nthink that, from the standpoint of economy, I had made a mistake in not\r\nsending her back to Farmington. It was not long before the dog\r\nproposition was sprung upon me; insidiously at first, until I had half\r\ncommitted myself, and then with such force and sweep as to take me off\r\nmy prudent feet. My own faithful terrier, which had dogged my heels for\r\nthree years, seemed a member of the family, and reasonably satisfied my\r\ndog needs. That Jane should wish a terrier of some sort to tug at her\r\nskirts and claw her lace was no more than natural, and I was quite\r\nwilling to buy a blue blood and think nothing of the $20 or $30 which it\r\nmight cost. We canvassed the list of terriers,--bull, Boston, fox,\r\nIrish, Skye, Scotch, Airedale, and all,--and had much to say in favor of\r\neach. One day Jane said:--\r\n\r\n\"Dad, what do you think of the Russian wolf-hound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine as silk,\" said I, not seeing the trap; \"the handsomest dog that\r\nruns.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too. I saw some beauties in the Seabright kennels. Wouldn't\r\none of them look fine on the lawn?--lemon and white, and so tall and\r\nsilky. I saw one down there, and he wasn't a year old, but his tail\r\nlooked like a great white ostrich feather, and it touched the ground.\r\nWouldn't it be grand to have such a dog follow me when I rode. Say, Dad,\r\nwhy not have one?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose a good one would cost?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, but a good bit more than a terrier, if they sell dogs by\r\nsize. May I write and find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no harm in doing that,\" said I, like the jellyfish that I am.\r\n\r\nJane wasted no time, but wrote at once, and at least seventeen times\r\neach day, until the reply came, she gave me such vivid accounts of the\r\nbeauties of the beasts and of the pleasure she would have in owning\r\none, that I grew enthusiastic as well, and quite made up my mind that\r\nshe should not be disappointed. When the letter came, there was\r\nsuppressed excitement until she had read it, and then excitement\r\nunsuppressed.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, we can have Alexis, son of Katinka by Peter the Great, for $125!\r\nSee what the letter says: 'Eleven months old, tall and strong in\r\nquarters, white, with even lemon markings, better head than Marksman,\r\nand a sure winner in the best of company.' Isn't that great? And I don't\r\nthink $125 is much, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for a horse or a house, dear, but for a dog--\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know, Dad, this isn't a common dog. We mustn't think of it as a\r\ndog; it's a barzoi; that isn't too much for a barzoi, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for a barzoi, or a yacht either; I guess you will have to have one\r\nor the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Seabright man says he has a girl dog by Marksman out of Katrina\r\nthat is the very picture of Alexis, only not so large, and he will sell\r\nboth to the same person for $200; they are such good friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Break away, daughter, do you want a steam launch with your yacht?\"\r\n\r\n\"But just think, Dad, only $75 for this one. You save $50, don't you\r\nsee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dimly, I must confess, as through a glass darkly. But, dear, I may\r\ncome to see it through your eyes and in the light of this altruistic dog\r\nfancier. I'm such a soft one that it's a wonder I'm ever trusted with\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\nThe natural thing occurred once more; the fool and his money parted\r\ncompany, and two of the most beautiful dogs came to live on our lawn. To\r\nlive on our lawn, did I say? Not much! Such wonderful creatures must\r\nhave a house and grounds of their own to retire to when they were weary\r\nof using ours, or when our presence bored them. The kennel and runs were\r\nbuilt near the carriage barn, the runs, twenty by one hundred feet,\r\nenclosed with high wire netting. The kennel, eight by sixteen, was a\r\nhandsome structure of its kind, with two compartments eight by eight\r\n(for Jane spoke for the future), and beds, benches, and the usual\r\nfixtures which well-bred dogs are supposed to require.\r\n\r\nThe house for these dogs cost $200, so I was obliged to add another $400\r\nto the interest-bearing debt. \"If Jane keeps on in this fashion,\"\r\nthought I, \"I shall have to refund at a lower rate,\"--and she did keep\r\non. No sooner were the dogs safely kennelled than she began to think how\r\nfine it would look to be followed by this wonderful pair along the\r\ncountry roads and through the streets of Exeter. To be followed, she\r\nmust have a horse and a saddle and a bridle and a habit; and later on I\r\nfound that these things did not grow on the bushes in our neighborhood.\r\nI drew a line at these things, however, and decided that they should not\r\nswell the farm account. Thus I keep from the reader's eye some of the\r\nfoolishness of a doting parent who has always been as warm wax in the\r\nhands of his, nearly always, reasonable children.\r\n\r\nIn my stable were two Kentucky-bred saddlers of much more than average\r\nquality, for they had strains of warm blood in their veins. There is no\r\nquestion nowadays as to the value of warm blood in either riding or\r\ndriving horses. It gives ability, endurance, courage, and docility\r\nbeyond expectation. One-sixteenth thorough blood will, in many animals,\r\ndominate the fifteen-sixteenths of cold blood, and prove its virtue by\r\nunusual endurance, stamina, and wearing capacity.\r\n\r\nThe blue-grass region of Kentucky has furnished some of the finest\r\nhorses in the world, and I have owned several which gave grand service\r\nuntil they were eighteen or twenty years old. An honest horseman at\r\nParis, Kentucky, has sold me a dozen or more, and I was willing to trust\r\nhis judgment for a saddler for Jane. My request to him was for a\r\nlight-built horse; weight, one thousand pounds; game and spirited, but\r\nsafe for a woman, and one broken to jump. Everything else, including\r\nprice, was left to him.\r\n\r\nIn good time Jane's horse came, and we were well pleased with it, as\r\nindeed we ought to have been. My Paris man wrote: \"I send a bay mare\r\nthat ought to fill the bill. She is as quiet as a kitten, can run like a\r\ndeer, and jump like a kangaroo. My sister has ridden her for four\r\nmonths, and she is not speaking to me now. If you don't like her, send\r\nher back.\"\r\n\r\nBut I did like her, and I sent, instead, a considerable check. The mare\r\nwas a bright bay with a white star on her forehead and white stockings\r\non her hind feet, stood fifteen hands three inches, weighed 980 pounds,\r\nand looked almost too light built; but when we noted the deep chest,\r\nstrong loins, thin legs, and marvellous thighs, we were free to admit\r\nthat force and endurance were promised. Jane was delighted.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, if I live to be a hundred years old, I will never forget this day.\r\nShe's the sweetest horse that ever lived. I must find a nice name for\r\nher, and to-morrow we will take our first ride, you and Tom and Aloha\r\nand I--yes, that's her name.\"\r\n\r\nWe did ride the next day, and many days thereafter; and Aloha proved all\r\nand more than the Kentuckian had promised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nTHE SKIM-MILK TRUST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third quarter of the year made a better showing than any previous\r\none, due chiefly to the sale of hogs in August. The hens did well up to\r\nSeptember, when they began to make new clothes for themselves and could\r\nnot be bothered with egg-making. There were a few more than seven\r\nhundred in the laying pens, and nearly as many more rapidly approaching\r\nthe useful age. The chief advantage in early chickens is that they will\r\ntake their places at the nests in October or November while the older\r\nones are dressmaking. This is important to one who looks for a steady\r\nincome from his hens,--October and November being the hardest months to\r\nprovide for. A few scattered eggs in the pullet runs showed that the\r\nlate February and early March chickens were beginning to have a\r\nrealizing sense of their obligations to the world and to the Headman,\r\nand that they were getting into line to accept them. More cotton-seed\r\nmeal was added to the morning mash for the old hens, and the corn meal\r\nwas reduced a little and the oatmeal increased, as was also the red\r\npepper; but do what you will or feed what you like, the hen will insist\r\nupon a vacation at this season of the year. You may shorten it, perhaps,\r\nbut you cannot prevent it. The only way to keep the egg-basket full is\r\nto have a lot of youngsters coming on who will take up the laying for\r\nOctober and November.\r\n\r\nWe milked thirty-seven cows during July, August, and September, and got\r\nmore than a thousand pounds of milk a day. The butter sold amounted to a\r\ntrifle more than $375 a month. I think this an excellent showing,\r\nconsidering the fact that the colony at Four Oaks never numbered less\r\nthan twenty-four during that time, and often many more.\r\n\r\nI ought to say that the calves had the first claim to the skim-milk; but\r\nas we never kept many for more than a few weeks, this claim was easily\r\nsatisfied. It was like the bonds of a corporation,--the first claim, but\r\na comparatively small one. The hens came next; they held preferred\r\nstock, and always received a five-pound, semi-daily dividend to each pen\r\nof forty. The growing pigs came last; they held the common stock, which\r\nwas often watered by the swill and dish-water from both houses and the\r\nbuttermilk and butter-washing from the dairy. I hold that the feeding\r\nvalue of skim-milk is not less than forty cents a hundred pounds, as we\r\nuse it at Four Oaks. This seems a high price when it can often be bought\r\nfor fifteen cents a hundred at the factories; but I claim that it is\r\nworth more than twice as much when fed in perfect freshness,--certainly\r\n$4 a day would not buy the skim-milk from my dairy, for it is worth more\r\nthan that to me to feed. This by-product is essential to the smooth\r\nrunning of my factory. Without it the chickens and pigs would not grow\r\nas fast, and it is the best food for laying hens,--nothing else will\r\ngive a better egg-yield. The longer my experiment continues, the\r\nstronger is my faith that the combination of cow, hog, and hen, with\r\nfruit as a filler, are ideal for the factory farm. With such a plant\r\nwell-started and well-managed, and with favorable surroundings, I do not\r\nsee how a man can prevent money from flowing to him in fair abundance.\r\nThe record of the fourth quarter is as follows:--\r\n\r\nButter       $1126.00\r\nEggs           351.00\r\nHogs          1807.00\r\n             --------\r\n   Total     $3284.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nNABOTH'S VINEYARD\r\n\r\n\r\n>One hazy, lazy October afternoon, as my friend Kyrle and I sat on the\r\nbroad porch hitting our pipes, sipping high balls, and watching the men\r\nand machines in the corn-fields, as all toiling sons of the soil should\r\ndo, he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, I don't think you've made any mistake in this business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lots of them, Kyrle; but none too serious to mend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose so; but I didn't mean it that way. It was no mistake\r\nwhen you made the change.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, old man. It's done me a heap of good, and Polly and the\r\nyoungsters were never so happy. I only wish we had done it earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I could manage a farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course you can; you've managed your business, haven't you?\r\nYou've grown rich in a business which is a great sight more taxing. How\r\nhave you done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"By using my head, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it; if a man will use his head, any business will\r\ngo,--farming or making hats. It's the gray matter that counts, and the\r\nfellow that puts a little more of it into his business than his neighbor\r\ndoes, is the one who'll get on.\"\r\n\r\n\"But farming is different; so much seems to depend upon winds and rains\r\nand frosts and accidents of all sorts that are out of one's line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much as you think, Kyrle. Of course these things cut in, but one\r\nmust discount them in farming as in other lines of business. A total\r\ncrop failure is an unknown thing in this region; we can count on\r\nsufficient rain for a moderate crop every year, and we know pretty well\r\nwhen to look for frosts. If a man will do well by his land, the harvest\r\nwill come as sure as taxes. All the farmer has to do is to make the best\r\nof what Nature and intelligent cultivation will always produce. But he\r\nmust use his gray matter in other ways than in just planning the\r\nrotation of crops. When he finds his raw staples selling for a good deal\r\nless than actual value,--less than he can produce them for, he should go\r\ninto the market and buy against higher prices, for he may be absolutely\r\ncertain that higher prices will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how is one to know? Corn changes so that one can't form much idea\r\nof its actual value.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more than other staples. You know what fur is worth, because you've\r\nwatched the fur market for twenty years. If it should fall to half its\r\npresent price, you would feel safe in buying a lot. You know that it\r\nwould make just as good hats as it ever did, and that the hats, in all\r\nprobability, would give you the usual profit. It's the same with corn\r\nand oats. I know their feeding value; and when they fall much below it,\r\nI fill my granary, because for my purpose they are as valuable as if\r\nthey cost three times as much. Last year I bought ten thousand bushels\r\nof corn and oats at a tremendously low price. I don't expect to have\r\nsuch a chance again; but I shall watch the market, and if corn goes\r\nbelow thirty cents or oats below twenty cents, I will fill my granary to\r\nthe roof. I can make them pay big profits on such prices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you sell this plant, Williams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for a song, you may be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has it cost you to date?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know exactly,--between $80,000 and $90,000, I reckon; the books\r\nwill show.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take twenty per cent advance on what the books show? I'm on\r\nthe square.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now see here, old man, what would be the good of selling this factory\r\nfor $100,000? How could I place the money so that it would bring me half\r\nthe things which this farm brings me now? Could I live in a better\r\nhouse, or have better food, better service, better friends, or a better\r\nway of entertaining them? You know that $5000 or $6000 a year would not\r\nsupply half the luxury which we secure at Four Oaks, or give half the\r\nenjoyment to my family or my friends. Don't you see that it makes little\r\ndifference what we call our expenses out here, so long as the farm pays\r\nthem and gives us a surplus besides? The investment is not large for one\r\nto get a living from, and it makes possible a lot of things which would\r\nbe counted rank extravagance in the city. Here's one of them.\"\r\n\r\nA cavalcade was just entering the home lot. First came Jessie Gordon on\r\nher thoroughbred mare Lightfoot, and with her, Laura on my Jerry.\r\nLaura's foot is as dainty in the stirrup as on the rugs, and she has\r\nJerry's consent and mine to put it where she likes. Following them were\r\nJane and Bill Jackson, with Jane's slender mare looking absolutely\r\ndelicate beside the big brown gelding that carried Jackson's 190 pounds\r\nwith ease. The horses all looked as if there had been \"something doing,\"\r\nand they were hurried to the stables. The ladies laughed and screamed\r\nfor a season, as seems necessary for young ladies, and then departed,\r\nleaving us in peace. Jackson filled his pipe before remarking:--\r\n\r\n\"I've been over the ridge into the Dunkard settlement, and they have the\r\ncholera there to beat the band. Joe Siegel lost sixty hogs in three\r\ndays, and there are not ten well hogs in two miles. What do you think of\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"That means a hard 'fight mit Siegel,'\" said Kyrle.\r\n\r\n\"It ought to mean a closer quarantine on this side of the ridge,\" said\r\nI, \"and you must fumigate your clothes before you appear before your\r\nswine, Jackson. It's more likely to be swine plague than cholera at this\r\ntime of the year, but it's just as bad; one can hardly tell the\r\ndifference, and we must look sharp.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does the contagion travel, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"On horseback, when such chumps as you can be found. You probably have\r\nsome millions of germs up your sleeve now, or, more likely, on your\r\nback, and I wouldn't let you go into my hog pen for a $2000 note. I'm so\r\nwell quarantined that I don't much fear contagion; but there's always\r\ndanger from infected dust. The wind blows it about, and any mote may be\r\nan automobile for a whole colony of bacteria, which may decide to picnic\r\nin my piggery. This dry weather is bad for us, and if we get heavy winds\r\nfrom off the ridge, I'm going to whistle for rain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Williams, when you came out here I thought you a tenderfoot,\r\nsure enough, who was likely to pay money for experience; but, by the\r\njumping Jews! you've given us natives cards and spades.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _was_ a tenderfoot so far as practical experience goes, but I tried\r\nto use the everyday sense which God gave me, and I find that's about all\r\na man needs to run a business like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You run it all right, for returns, and that's what we are after; and\r\nI'm beginning to catch on. I want you to tell me, before Kyrle here,\r\nwhy you gave me that bull two years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with the bull, Jackson? Isn't he all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure he's all right, and as fine as silk; but why did you give him to\r\nme? Why didn't you keep him for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bill, I thought you would like him, and we were neighbors, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"You thought I would save you the trouble of keeping him, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps that did have some influence. You see, this is a factory\r\nfarm from fence to fence, except this forty which Polly bosses, and the\r\nutilitarian idea is on top. Keeping the bull didn't exactly run with my\r\nnotion of economy, especially when I could conveniently have him kept so\r\nnear, and at the same time be generous to a neighbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, and it's taken me two years to find it out. You're trying to\r\nfollow that idea all along the line. You're dead right, and I'm going to\r\ntag on, if you don't mind. I was glad enough for your present at the\r\ntime, and I'm glad yet; but I've learned my lesson, and you may bet your\r\ndear life that no man will ever again give me a bull.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Jackson. Now you have struck the key-note; stick to it,\r\nand you will make money twice as fast as you have done. Have a mark, and\r\nkeep your eye on it, and your plough will turn a straight furrow.\"\r\n\r\nJackson sent for his horse, and just before he mounted, I said, \"Are\r\nyou thinking of selling your farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to think of it, but I've been to school lately and can 'do my\r\nsums' better. No, I guess I won't sell the paternal acres; but who wants\r\nto buy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kyrle, here, is looking for a farm about the size of yours, and to tell\r\nyou the truth I should like him for a neighbor. It's dollars to\r\ndoughnuts that I could give him a whole herd of bulls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, you can't do anything of the kind! I wouldn't take a gold\r\ndollar from you until I had it tested. I'm on to your curves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But seriously, Jackson, I must have more land; my stock will eat me out\r\nof house and home by the time the factory is running full steam. What\r\nwould you say to a proposition of $10,000 for one hundred acres along my\r\nnorth line?\"\r\n\r\n\"A year ago I would have jumped at it. Now I say 'nit.' I need it all,\r\nDoctor; I told you I was going to tag on. But what's the matter with the\r\nold lady's quarter across your south road?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing's the matter with the land, only she won't sell it at any\r\nprice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; but that drunken brute of a son will sell as soon as she's\r\nunder the sod, and they say the poor old girl is on her last legs,--down\r\nwith distemper or some other beastly disease. I'll tell you what I'll\r\ndo. I'll sound the renegade son and see how he measures. Some one will\r\nget it before long, and it might as well be you.\"\r\n\r\nJackson galloped off, and Kyrle and I sat on the porch and divided the\r\nwidow's 160-acre mite. It was a good strip of land, lying a fair mile on\r\nthe south road and a quarter of a mile deep. The buildings were of no\r\nvalue, the fences were ragged to a degree, but I coveted the land. It\r\nwas the vineyard of Naboth to me, and I planned its future with my\r\nfriend and accessory sitting by. I destroyed the estimable old lady's\r\nhouse and barns, ran my ploughshares through her garden and flower beds,\r\nand turned the home site into one great field of lusty corn, without so\r\nmuch as saying by your leave. Thus does the greed of land grow upon one.\r\nBut in truth, I saw that I must have more land. My factory would require\r\nmore than ten thousand bushels of grain, with forage and green foods in\r\nproportion, to meet its full capacity, and I could not hope to get so\r\nmuch from the land then under cultivation. Again, in a few years--a very\r\nfew--the fifty acres of orchard would be no longer available for crops,\r\nand this would still further reduce my tillable land. With the orchards\r\nout of use, I should have but 124 acres for all crops other than hay. If\r\nI could add this coveted 160, it would give me 250 acres of excellent\r\nland for intensive farming.\r\n\r\n\"I should like it on this side of the road,\" said I, \"but I suppose that\r\nwill have to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will have to do?\" asked Kyrle.\r\n\r\n\"The 160 acres over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You unconscionable wretch! Have you evicted the poor widow, and she on\r\nher deathbed? For stiffening the neck and hardening the heart, commend\r\nme to the close-to-nature life of the farmer. I wouldn't own a farm for\r\nworlds. It risks one's immortality. Give me the wicked city for\r\npasturage--and a friend who will run a farm, at his own risk, and give\r\nme the benefit of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nMAIDS AND MALLARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have so rarely entered our house with the reader that he knows little\r\nof its domestic machinery. So much depends upon this machinery that one\r\nmust always take it into consideration when reckoning the pleasures and\r\neven the comforts of life anywhere, and this is especially true in the\r\ncountry. We have such a lot of people about that our servants cannot\r\nsing the song of lonesomeness that makes dolor for most suburbanites.\r\nThey are \"churched\" as often as they wish, and we pay city wages; but\r\nstill it is not all clear sailing in this quarter of Polly's realm. I\r\nfancy that we get on better than some of our neighbors; but we do not\r\nbrag, and I usually feel that I am smoking my pipe in a powder magazine.\r\nThere is something essentially wrong in the working-girl world, and I am\r\nglad that I was not born to set it right. We cannot down the spirit of\r\nunrest and improvidence that holds possession of cooks and waitresses,\r\nand we needs must suffer it with such patience as we can.\r\n\r\nTwo of our house servants were more or less permanent; that is, they\r\nhad been with us since we opened the house, and were as content as\r\nrestless spirits can be. These were the housekeeper and the cook,--the\r\nhub of the house. The former is a Norwegian, tall, angular, and capable,\r\nwith a knot of yellow hair at the back of her head,--ostensibly for\r\nsticking lead pencils into,--and a disposition to keep things snug and\r\nclean. Her duties include the general supervision of both houses and the\r\nspecial charge of store-rooms, food cellars, and table supplies of all\r\nsorts. She is efficient, she whistles while she works, and I see but\r\nlittle of her. I suspect that Polly knows her well.\r\n\r\nThe cook, Mary, is small, Irish, gray, with the temper of a pepper-pod\r\nand the voice of a guinea-hen suffering from bronchitis, but she can\r\ncook like an angel. She is an artist, and I feel as if the\r\nseven-dollar-a-week stipend were but a \"tip\" to her, and that sometime\r\nshe will present me with a bill for her services. My safeguard, and one\r\nthat I cherish, is an angry word from her to the housekeeper. She\r\njeeringly asserted that she, the cook, got $2 a week more than she, the\r\nhousekeeper, did. As every one knows that the housekeeper has $5 a week,\r\nI am holding this evidence against the time when Mary asks for a lump\r\nsum adequate to her deserts. The number of things which Mary can make\r\nout of everything and out of nothing is wonderful; and I am fully\r\npersuaded that all the moneys paid to a really good cook are moneys put\r\ninto the bank. I often make trips to the kitchen to tell Mary that \"the\r\ndinner was great,\" or that \"Mrs. Kyrle wants the receipt for that\r\npudding,\" or that \"my friend Kyrle asks if he may see you make a salad\r\ndressing;\" but \"don't do it, Mary; let the secret die with you.\" The\r\ncook cackles, like the guinea-hen that she is, but the dishes are none\r\nthe worse for the commendation.\r\n\r\nThe laundress is just a washerwoman, so far as I know. She undoubtedly\r\nchanges with the seasons, but I do not see her, though the clothes are\r\nalways bleaching on the grass at the back of the house.\r\n\r\nThe maids are as changeable as old-fashioned silk. There are always two\r\nof them; but which two, is beyond me. I tell Polly that Four Oaks is a\r\nsprocket-wheel for maids, with two links of an endless chain always on\r\ntop. It makes but little difference which links are up, so the work goes\r\nsmoothly. Polly thinks the maids come to Four Oaks just as less\r\nindependent folk go to the mountains or the shore, for a vacation, or to\r\nbe able to say to the policeman, \"I've been to the country.\" Their\r\nsystem is past finding out; but no matter what it is, we get our dishes\r\nwashed and our beds made without serious inconvenience. The wage account\r\nin the house amounts to just $25 a week. My pet system of an increasing\r\nwage for protracted service doesn't appeal to these birds of passage,\r\nwho alight long enough to fill their crops with our wild rice and\r\ncelery, and then take wing for other feeding-grounds. This kind of life\r\nseems fitted for mallards and maids, and I have no quarrel with either.\r\nFrom my view, there are happier instincts than those which impel\r\nmigration; but remembering that personal views are best applied to\r\npersonal use, I wish both maids and mallards _bon voyage_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nTHE SUNKEN GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nExtending directly west from the porch for 150 feet is an open pergola,\r\nof simple construction, but fast gaining beauty from the rapid growth of\r\nclimbers which Polly and Johnson have planted. It is floored with brick\r\nfor the protection of dainty feet, and near the western end cluster\r\nrustic benches, chairs, tables, and such things as women and gardeners\r\nlove. Facing the west 50 feet of this pergola is Polly's sunken flower\r\ngarden, which is her special pride. It extends south 100 feet, and is\r\nbuilt in the side of the hill so that its eastern wall just shows a\r\ncoping above the close-cropped lawn. Of course the western wall is much\r\nhigher, as the lawn slopes sharply; but it was filled in so as to make\r\nthis wall-enclosed garden quite level. The walls which rise above the\r\nflower beds 4½ feet, are beginning to look decorated, thanks to creeping\r\nvines and other things which a cunning gardener and Polly know. Flowers\r\nof all sorts--annuals, biennials (triennials, perhaps), and\r\nperennials--cover the beds, which are laid out in strange, irregular\r\nfashion, far indeed from my rectangular style. These beds please the\r\neye of the mistress, and of her friends, too, if they are candid in\r\ntheir remarks, which I doubt.\r\n\r\nWhile excavating the garden we found a granite boulder shaped somewhat\r\nlike an egg and nearly five feet long. It was a big thing, and not very\r\nshapely; but it came from the soil, and Polly wanted it for the base of\r\nher sun-dial. We placed it, big end down, in the mathematical centre of\r\nthe garden (I insisted on that), and sunk it into the ground to make it\r\nsolid; then a stone mason fashioned a flat space on the top to\r\naccommodate an old brass dial that Polly had found in Boston. The dial\r\nis not half bad. From the heavy, octagonal brass base rises a slender\r\nquill to cast its shadow on the figured circle, while around this circle\r\nold English characters ask, \"Am I not wise, who note only bright hours?\"\r\nA plat of sod surrounds the dial, and Polly goes to it at least once a\r\nday to set her watch by the shadow of the quill, though I have told her\r\na hundred times that it is seventeen minutes off standard time. I am\r\nconvinced that this estimable lady wilfully ignores conventional time\r\nand marks her cycles by such divisions as \"catalogue time,\" \"seed-buying\r\ntime,\" \"planting time,\" \"sprouting time,\" \"spraying time,\" \"flowering\r\ntime,\" \"seed-gathering time,\" \"mulching time,\" and \"dreary time,\" until\r\nthe catalogues come again. I know it seemed no time at all until she had\r\nlet me in to the tune of $687 for the pergola, walls, and garden. She\r\nbought the sun-dial with her own money, I am thankful to say, and it\r\ndoesn't enter into this account. I think it must have cost a pretty\r\npenny, for she had a hat \"made over\" that spring.\r\n\r\nPolly has planted the lawn with a lot of shade trees and shrubs, and has\r\nadded some clumps of fruit trees. Few trees have been planted near the\r\nhouse; the four fine oaks, from which we take our name, stand without\r\nrivals and give ample shade. The great black oak near the east end of\r\nthe porch is a tower of strength and beauty, which is \"seen and known of\r\nall men,\" while the three white oaks farther to the west form a clump\r\nwhich casts a grateful shade when the sun begins to decline. The seven\r\nacres of forest to the east is left severely alone, save where the\r\ncarriage drive winds through it, and Polly watches so closely that the\r\nfoot of the Philistine rarely crushes her wild flowers. Its sacredness\r\nrecalls the schoolgirl's definition of a virgin forest: \"One in which\r\nthe hand of man has never dared to put his foot into it.\" Polly wanders\r\nin this grove for hours; but then she knows where and how things grow,\r\nand her footsteps are followed by flowers. If by chance she brushes one\r\ndown, it rises at once, shakes off the dust, and says, \"I ought to have\r\nknown better than to wander so far from home.\"\r\n\r\nShe keeps a wise eye on the vegetable garden, too, and has stores of\r\nknowledge as to seed-time and harvest and the correct succession of\r\ngarden crops. She and Johnson planned a greenhouse, which Nelson built,\r\nfor flowers and green stuff through the winter, she said; but I think it\r\nis chiefly a place where she can play in the dirt when the weather is\r\nbad. Anyhow, that glass house cost the farm $442, and the interest and\r\ntaxes are going on yet. I as well as Polly had to do some building that\r\nautumn. Three more chicken-houses were built, making five in all. Each\r\nconsists in ten compartments twenty feet wide, of which each is intended\r\nto house forty hens. When these houses were completed, I had room for\r\nforty pens of forty each, which was my limit for laying hens. In\r\naddition was one house of ten pens for half-grown chickens and fattening\r\nfowls. It would take the hatch of another year to fill my pens, but one\r\nmust provide for the future. These three houses cost, in round numbers,\r\n$2100,--five times as much as Polly's glass house,--but I was not going\r\nto play in them.\r\n\r\nI also built a cow-house on the same plan as the first one, but about\r\nhalf the size. This was for the dry cows and the heifers. It cost $2230,\r\nand gave me stable room enough for the waiting stock, so that I could\r\ncount on forty milch cows all the time, when my herd was once balanced.\r\nForty cows giving milk, six hundred swine of all ages, putting on fat or\r\ndoing whatever other duty came to hand, fifteen or sixteen hundred hens\r\nlaying eggs when not otherwise engaged, three thousand apple trees\r\nstriving with all their might to get large enough to bear fruit,--these\r\nmade up my ideal of a factory farm; and it looked as if one year more\r\nwould see it complete.\r\n\r\nNo rain fell in October, and my brook became such a little brook that I\r\ndared to correct its ways. We spent a week with teams, ploughs, and\r\nscrapers, cutting the fringe and frills away from it, and reducing it to\r\nsevere simplicity. It is strange, but true, that this reversion to\r\nsimplicity robbed it of its shy ways and rustic beauty, and left it\r\nboldly staring with open eyes and gaping with wide-stretched mouth at\r\nthe men who turned from it. We put in about two thousand feet of tile\r\ndrainage on both sides of what Polly called \"that ditch,\" and this\r\ncompleted the improvements on the low lands. The land, indeed, was not\r\ntoo low to bear good crops, but it was lightened by under drainage and\r\nyielded more each after year.\r\n\r\nThe tiles cost me five cents per foot, or $100 for the whole. The work\r\nwas done by my own men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nTHE HEADMAN GENERALIZES\r\n\r\n\r\nJackson's prophecy came true. The old lady died, and before the ground\r\nwas fairly settled around her the improvident son accepted a cash offer\r\nof $75 per acre for his homestead, and the farm was added to mine. This\r\nwas in November. I at once spent $640 for 2-1/2 miles of fencing to\r\nenclose it in one field, charging the farm account with $12,640 for the\r\nland and fence.\r\n\r\nThis transaction was a bargain, from my point of view; and it was a good\r\nsale, from the standpoint of the other man, for he put $12,000 away at\r\nfive per cent interest, and felt that he need never do a stroke of work\r\nagain. A lazy man is easily satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn December I sold 283 hogs. It was a choice lot, as much alike as peas\r\nin a pod, and gave an average weight of 276 pounds; but the market was\r\nexceedingly low. I received the highest quotation for the month, $3.60\r\nper hundred, and the lot netted $2702.\r\n\r\nIt seems hard luck to be obliged to sell fine swine at such a price, and\r\na good many farmers would hold their stock in the hope of a rise; but I\r\ndo not think this prudent. When a pig is 250 days old, if he has been\r\npushed, he has reached his greatest profit-growth; and he should be\r\nsold, even though the market be low. If one could be certain that within\r\na reasonable time, say thirty days, there would be a marked advance, it\r\nmight do to hold; but no one can be sure of this, and it doesn't usually\r\npay to wait. Market the product when at its best, is the rule at Four\r\nOaks. The young hog is undoubtedly at his best from eight to nine months\r\nold. He has made a maximum growth on minimum feed, and from that time on\r\nhe will eat more and give smaller proportionate returns. There is\r\ndanger, too, that he will grow stale; for he has been subjected to a\r\nforcing system which contemplated a definite time limit and which cannot\r\nextend much beyond that limit without risks. Force your swine not longer\r\nthan nine months and sell for what you can get, and you will make more\r\nmoney in the long run than by trying to catch a high market. I sold in\r\nDecember something more than four hundred cockerels, which brought $215.\r\nThe apples from the old trees were good that year, but not so abundant\r\nas the year before, and they brought $337,--$2.25 per tree. The hens\r\nlaid few eggs in October and November, though they resumed work in\r\nDecember; but the pullets did themselves proud. Sam said he gathered\r\nfrom fourteen to twenty eggs a day from each pen of forty, which is\r\nbetter than forty per cent. We sold nearly eighteen hundred dozen eggs\r\nduring this quarter, for $553. The butter account showed nearly\r\ntwenty-eight hundred pounds sold, which brought $894, and the sale of\r\neleven calves brought $180. These sales closed the credit side of our\r\nledger for the year.\r\n\r\nApples               $337.00\r\nCalves                130.00\r\nCockerels             215.00\r\n1785 doz. eggs        553.00\r\n2790 lb. butter       894.00\r\n283 hogs             2702.00\r\n                    --------\r\n    Total           $4831.00\r\n\r\nIn making up the expense account of that year and the previous one, I\r\nfound that I should be able in future to say with a good deal of\r\nexactness what the gross amount would be, without much figuring. The\r\ninterest account would steadily decrease, I hoped, while the wage\r\naccount would increase as steadily until it approached $5500; that year\r\nit was $4662. Each man who had been on the farm more than six months\r\nreceived $18 more that year than he did the year before, and this\r\nincrease would continue until the maximum wage of $40 a month was\r\nreached; but while some would stay long enough to earn the maximum,\r\nothers would drop out, and new men would begin work at $20 a month. I\r\nfelt safe, therefore, in fixing $5500 as the maximum wage limit of any\r\nyear. Time has proven the correctness of this estimate, for $5372 is the\r\nmost I have paid for wages during the seven years since this experiment\r\nwas inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThe food purchased for cows, hogs, and hens may also be definitely\r\nestimated. It costs about $30 a year for each cow, $1 for each hog, and\r\nthirty cents for each hen. Everything else comes from the land, and is\r\ncovered by such fixed charges as interest, wages, taxes, insurance,\r\nrepairs, and replenishments. The food for the colony at Four Oaks,\r\nusually bought at wholesale, doesn't cost more than $5 a month per\r\ncapita. This seems small to a man who is in the habit of paying cash for\r\neverything that enters his doors; but it amply provides for comforts and\r\neven for luxuries, not only for the household, but also for the stranger\r\nwithin the gates. In the city, where water and ice cost money and the\r\ndaily purchase of food is taxed by three or four middlemen, one cannot\r\nrealize the factory farmer's independence of tradesmen. I do not mean\r\nthat this sum will furnish terrapin and champagne, but I do not\r\nunderstand that terrapin and champagne are necessary to comfort, health,\r\nor happiness.\r\n\r\nLet us look for a moment at some of the things which the factory farmer\r\ndoes not buy, and perhaps we shall see that a comfortable existence need\r\nnot demand much more. His cows give him milk, cream, butter, and veal;\r\nhis swine give roast pig, fresh pork, salt pork, ham, bacon, sausages,\r\nand lard; his hens give eggs and poultry; his fields yield hulled corn,\r\nsamp, and corn meal; his orchards give apples, pears, peaches, quinces,\r\nplums, and cherries; his bushes give currants, gooseberries,\r\nstrawberries, raspberries, blackberries; his vines give grapes; his\r\nforests give hickory nuts, butternuts, and hazel nuts; and, best of all,\r\nhis garden gives more than twenty varieties of toothsome and wholesome\r\nvegetables in profusion. The whole fruit and vegetable product of the\r\ntemperate zone is at his door, and he has but to put forth his hand and\r\ntake it. The skilled housewife makes wonderful provision against winter\r\nfrom the opulence of summer, and her storehouse is crowded with\r\ninnumerable glass cells rich in the spoils of orchard and garden. There\r\nis scant use for the grocer and the butcher under such conditions. I am\r\nso well convinced that my estimate of $5 a month is liberal that I have\r\ntaxed the account with all the salt used on the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND-GIRLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe click of Jane's hammer began to be heard in November, and hardly a\r\nday passed without some music from this \"Forge in the Forest.\" Sir Tom\r\nmade a permanent station of the workshop, where he spent hours in a\r\ncomfortable chair, drawing nourishment from the head of his cane and\r\npleasure from watching the girl at the anvil. I suspect that he planted\r\nhimself in the corner of the forge to safeguard Jane; for he had an\r\nabiding fear that she would take fire, and he wished to be near at hand\r\nto put her out. He procured a small Babcock extinguisher and a\r\nhalf-dozen hand-grenades, and with these instruments he constituted\r\nhimself a very efficient volunteer fire department. He made her promise,\r\nalso, that she would have definite hours for heavy work, that he might\r\nbe on watch; and so fond was she of his company, or rather of his\r\npresence, for he talked but little, that she kept close to the schedule.\r\n\r\nLaura had a favorite corner in the forge, where she often turned a hem\r\nor a couplet. She was equally dexterous at either; and Sir Tom watched\r\nher, too, with an admiring eye. I once heard him say:--\r\n\r\n\"Milady Laura, it is the regret of me life that I came into the world a\r\ngeneration too soon.\"\r\n\r\nLaura sometimes went away--she called it \"going home,\" but we scoffed\r\nthe term--and the doldrums blew until she returned. Sir Tom dined with\r\nus nearly every evening through the fall and early winter; and when he,\r\nand Kate and Tom and the grand-girls, and the Kyrles, and Laura were at\r\nFour Oaks, there was little to be desired. The grand-girls were nearly\r\nfive and seven now, and they were a great help to the Headman. My\r\nterrier was no closer to my heels from morning to night than were these\r\nyoungsters. They took to country life like the young animals they were,\r\nand made friends with all, from Thompson down. They must needs watch the\r\nsheep as they walked their endless way on the treadmill night and\r\nmorning; they thrust their hands into hundreds of nests and placed the\r\nspoils in Sam's big baskets; they watched the calves at their patent\r\nfeeders, which deceived the calves, but not the girls; they climbed into\r\nthe grain bins and tobogganed on the corn; they haunted the cow-barn at\r\nmilking time and wondered much; but the chiefest of their delights was\r\nthe beautiful white pig which Anderson gave them. A little movable pen\r\nwas provided for this favorite, and the youngsters fed it several times\r\na day with warm milk from a nursing-bottle, like any other motherless\r\nchild. The pig loved its foster-mothers, and squealed for them most of\r\nthe time when it was not eating or sleeping; fortunately, a pig can do\r\nmuch of both. It grew playful and intelligent, and took on strange\r\nlittle human ways which made one wonder if Darwin were right in his\r\nconclusion that we are all ascended from the ape. I have seen features\r\nand traits of character so distinctly piggish as to rouse my suspicions\r\nthat the genealogical line is not free from a cross of _sus scrofa_. The\r\npig grew in stature and in wisdom, but not in grace, from day to day,\r\nuntil it threatened to dominate the place. However, it was lost during\r\nthe absence of its friends,--to be replaced by a younger one at the next\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n\"Do _your_ pigs get lost when you are away?\" asked No. 1.\r\n\r\n\"Not often, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only pet pigs that runds away,\" said No. 2, \"and I don't care, for\r\nit rooted me.\"\r\n\r\nThe pet pig is still a favorite with the grand-girls, but it always runs\r\naway in the fall.\r\n\r\nKate loved to come to Four Oaks, and she spent so much time there that\r\nshe often said:--\r\n\r\n\"We have no right to that $1200; we spend four times as much time here\r\nas you all do in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right daughter, but I wish you would spend twice as much\r\ntime here as you do, and I also wish that the $1200 were twice as much\r\nas it is.\"\r\n\r\nTime was running so smoothly with us that we \"knocked on wood\" each\r\nmorning for fear our luck would break.\r\n\r\nThe cottage which had once served as a temporary granary, and which had\r\nbeen moved to the building line two years before, was now turned into an\r\noverflow house against the time when Jack should come home for the\r\nwinter vacation. Polly had decided to have \"just as many as we can hold,\r\nand some more,\" and as the heaviest duties fell upon her, the rest of us\r\ncould hardly find fault. The partitions were torn out of the cottage,\r\nand it was opened up into one room, except for the kitchen, which was\r\nturned into a bath-room. Six single iron beds were put up, and the place\r\nwas made comfortable by an old-fashioned, air-tight, sheet-iron stove\r\nwith a great hole in the top through which big chunks and knots of wood\r\nwere fed. This stove would keep fire all night, and, while not up to\r\nlatter-day demands, it was quite satisfactory to the warm-blooded boys\r\nwho used it. The expense of overhauling the cottage was $214. Tom, Kate,\r\nand the grand-girls were to be with us, of course, and so were the\r\nKyrles, Sir Tom, Jessie Gordon, Florence, Madeline, and Alice Chase.\r\nJack was to bring Jarvis and two other men besides Frank and Phil of\r\nlast year's party.\r\n\r\nThe six boys were bestowed in the cottage, where they made merry\r\nwithout seriously interrupting sleep in the main house. The others found\r\ncomfortable quarters under our roof, except Sir Tom, who would go home\r\nsome time in the night, to return before lunch the next day.\r\n\r\nWith such a houseful of people, the cook was worked to the bone; but she\r\ngloried in it, and cackled harder than ever. I believe she gave warning\r\ntwice during those ten days; but Polly has a way with her which Mary\r\ncannot resist. I do not think we could have driven that cook out of the\r\nhouse with a club when there was such an opportunity for her to\r\ndistinguish herself. Her warnings were simply matters of habit.\r\n\r\nThe holidays were filled with such things as a congenial country\r\nhouse-party can furnish--the wholesomest, jolliest things in the world;\r\nand the end, when it came, was regretted by all. I grew to feel a little\r\nbit jealous of Jarvis's attentions to Jane, for they looked serious, and\r\nshe was not made unhappy by them. Jarvis was all that was honest and\r\nmanly, but I could not think of giving up Jane, even to the best of\r\nfellows. I wanted her for my old age. I suspect that a loving father can\r\ndig deeper into the mud of selfishness than any other man, and yet feel\r\nall the time that he is doing God service. It is in accord with nature\r\nthat a daughter should take the bit in her teeth and bolt away from this\r\nrestraining selfishness, but the man who is left by the roadside cannot\r\nalways see it in that light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD BECKONING\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of December 31 I called a meeting of the committee of\r\nways and means, and Polly and I locked ourselves in my office. It was\r\nthen two and a half years since we commenced the experiment of building\r\na factory farm, which was to supply us with comforts, luxuries, and\r\npleasures of life, and yet be self-supporting: a continuous experiment\r\nin economics.\r\n\r\nThe building of the factory was practically completed, though not all of\r\nits machinery had yet been installed. We had spent our money\r\nfreely,--too freely, perhaps; and we were now ready to watch the\r\nreturns. Polly said:--\r\n\r\n\"There are some things we are sure of: we like the country, and it likes\r\nus. I have spent the happiest year of my life here. We've entertained\r\nmore friends than ever before, and they've been better entertained, so\r\nthat we are all right from the social standpoint. You are stronger and\r\nbetter than ever before, and so am I. Credit the farm with these things,\r\nMr. Headman, and you'll find that it doesn't owe us such an awful amount\r\nafter all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are these things worth $100,000?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, John, you don't mean that you've spent $100,000! What in the world\r\nhave you done with it? Just pigs and cows and chickens--\"\r\n\r\n\"And greenhouses and sunken gardens and pergolas and kickshaws,\" said I.\r\n\"But seriously, Polly, I think that we can show value for all that we\r\nhave spent; and the whole amount is not three times what our city house\r\ncost, and that only covered our heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you figure values here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We get a great deal more than simply shelter out of this place, and we\r\nhave tangible values, too. Here are some of them: 480 acres of excellent\r\nland, so well groomed and planted that it is worth of any man's money,\r\n$120 per acre, or $57,600; buildings, water-plant, etc., all as good as\r\nnew, $40,000; 44 cows, $4400; 10 heifers nearly two years old, $500; 8\r\nhorses, $1200; 50 brood sows, $1000; 350 young pigs, $1700; 1300 laying\r\nhens, $1300; tools and machinery, $1500; that makes well over $100,000\r\nin sight, besides all the things you mentioned before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't counted the six horses in my barn.\"\r\n\r\n\"They haven't been charged to the farm, Polly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the trees you've planted?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they go with the land to increase its value.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my gardens, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are fixtures and count with the acres. You see, this, land\r\ndidn't cost quite $75 an acre, but I hold it $50 better for what we've\r\ndone to it; I don't believe Bill Jackson would sell his for less. I\r\noffered him $10,000 for a hundred acres, and he refused. We've put up\r\nthe price of real estate in this neighborhood, Mrs. Williams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's get at the figures. I'm dying to see how we stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have summarized them here:--\r\n\r\n\"To additional land and development of plant  $20,353.00\r\nTo interest on previous investment              4,220.00\r\nWages                                           4,662.00\r\nFood for twenty-five people                     1,523.00\r\nFood for stock                                  2,120.00\r\nTaxes and insurance                               207.00\r\nShoeing and repairs                               309.00\r\n                                              ----------\r\n      \"Making in all                          $33,394.00\r\n\r\nspent this year.\r\n\r\n\"The receipts are:--\r\n\r\n\"First quarter                                 $1,297.00\r\nSecond quarter                                  1,706.00\r\nThird quarter                                   3,284.00\r\nFourth quarter                                  4,831.00\r\n                                               ---------\r\n        \"Making                               $11,118.00\r\n\r\n\"But we agreed to pay $4000 a year to the farm for our food and shelter,\r\nif it did as well by us as the town house did. Shall we do it, Polly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course; we've been no end more comfortable here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we don't expect to get something for nothing, I think we\r\nought to add it. Adding $4000 will make the returns from the farm\r\n$15,118, leaving $18,276 to add to the interest-bearing debt. Last year\r\nthis debt was $84,404. Add this year's deficit, and we have $102,680. A\r\ngood deal of money, Polly, but I showed you well over $100,000 in\r\nassets,--at our own price, to be sure, but not far wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you ever have to increase the debt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not. I believe we shall reduce it a little next year, and each\r\nyear thereafter. But, supposing it only pays expenses, how can you put\r\non as much style on the interest of $100,000 anywhere else as you can\r\nhere? It can't be done. When the fruit comes in and this factory is\r\nrunning full time, it will earn well on toward $25,000 a year, and it\r\nwill not cost over $14,000 to run it, interest and all. It won't take\r\nlong at that rate to wipe out the interest-bearing debt. You'll be rich,\r\nPolly, before you're ten years older.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are rich now, in imagination and expectation, Mr. Headman, but I'll\r\nbank with you for a while longer. But what's the use of charging the\r\nfarm with interest when you credit it with our keeping?\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't much reason in that, Polly. It's about as broad as it is\r\nlong. I simply like to keep books in that way. We charge the farm with a\r\nlittle more than $4000 interest, and we credit it with just $4000 for\r\nour food and shelter. We'll keep on in this way because I like it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nTHE MILK MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn opening the year 1898 I was faced by a larger business proposition\r\nthan I had originally planned. When I undertook the experiment of a\r\nfactory farm, I placed the limit of capital to be invested at about\r\n$60,000. Now I found that I had exceeded that amount by a good many\r\nthousand dollars, and I knew that the end was not yet. The factory was\r\nnot complete, and it would be several years before it would be at its\r\nbest in output. While it had cost me more than was originally\r\ncontemplated, and while there was yet more money to be spent, there was\r\nstill no reason for discouragement. Indeed, I felt so certain of\r\nultimate profits that I was ready to put as much into it as could\r\npossibly be used to advantage.\r\n\r\nThe original plan was for a soiling farm on which I could milk thirty\r\ncows, fatten two hundred hogs, feed a thousand hens, and wait for\r\nthirty-five hundred fruit trees to come to a profitable age. With this\r\nin view, I set apart forty acres of high, dry land, for the\r\nfeeding-grounds, twenty acres of which was devoted to the cows; and I\r\nnow found that this twenty-acre lot would provide an ample exercise\r\nfield for twice that number. It was in grass (timothy, red-top, and blue\r\ngrass), and the cows nibbled persistently during the short hours each\r\nday when they were permitted to be on it; but it was never reckoned as\r\npart of their ration. The sod was kept in good condition and the field\r\nfree from weeds, by the use of the mowing-machine, set high, every ten\r\nor twenty days, according to the season. Following the mower, we use a\r\nspring-tooth rake which bunched the weeds and gathered or broke up the\r\ndroppings; and everything the rake caught was carted to the manure vats.\r\nOur big Holsteins do not suffer from close quarters, so far as I am able\r\nto judge, neither do they take on fat. From thirty minutes to three\r\nhours (depending on the weather), is all the outing they get each day;\r\nbut this seems sufficient for their needs. The well-ventilated stable\r\nwith its moderate temperature suits the sedentary nature of these milk\r\nmachines, and I am satisfied with the results. I cannot, of course,\r\nspeak with authority of the comparative merits of soiling _versus_\r\ngrazing, for I have had no experience in the latter; but in theory\r\nsoiling appeals to me, and in practice it satisfies me.\r\n\r\nWhen I found I could keep more cows on the land set apart for them, I\r\nbuilt another cow stable for the dry cows and the heifers, and added\r\nfour stalls to my milk stable by turning each of the hospital wards into\r\ntwo stalls.\r\n\r\nThe ten heifers which I reserved in the spring of 1896 were now nearly\r\ntwo years old. They were expected to \"come in\" in the early autumn, when\r\nthey would supplement the older herd. The cows purchased in 1895 were\r\nnow five years old, and quite equal to the large demand which we made\r\nupon them. They had grown to be enormous creatures, from thirteen\r\nhundred to fourteen hundred pounds in weight, and they were proving\r\ntheir excellence as milk producers by yielding an average of forty\r\npounds a day. We had, and still have, one remarkable milker, who thinks\r\nnothing of yielding seventy pounds when fresh, and who doesn't fall\r\nbelow twenty-five pounds when we are forced to dry her off. I have no\r\ndoubt that she would be a successful candidate for advanced registration\r\nif we put her to the test. For ten months in each year these cows give\r\nsuch quantities of milk as would surprise a man not acquainted with this\r\nnoble Dutch family. My five common cows were good of their kind, but\r\nthey were not in the class with the Holsteins. They were not \"robber\"\r\ncows, for they fully earned their food; but there was no great profit in\r\nthem. To be sure, they did not eat more than two-thirds as much as the\r\nHolsteins; but that fact did not stand to their credit, for the basic\r\nprinciple of factory farming is to consume as much raw material as\r\npossible and to turn out its equivalent in finished product. The common\r\ncows consumed only two-thirds as much raw material as the Holsteins,\r\nand turned out rather less than two-thirds of their product, while they\r\noccupied an equal amount of floor space; consequently they had to give\r\nplace to more competent machines. They were to be sold during the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nWhy dairymen can be found who will pay $50 apiece for cows like those I\r\nhad for sale (better, indeed, than the average), is beyond my method of\r\nreckoning values. Twice $50 will buy a young cow bred for milk, and she\r\nwould prove both bread and milk to the purchaser in most cases. The\r\nquestion of food should settle itself for the dairyman as it does for\r\nthe factory farmer. The more food consumed, the better for each, if the\r\nratio of milk be the same.\r\n\r\nMy Holsteins are great feeders; more than 2 tons of grain, 2-1/2 tons of\r\nhay, and 4 or 5 tons of corn fodder, in addition to a ton of roots or\r\nsucculent vegetables, pass through their great mouths each year. The hay\r\nis nearly equally divided between timothy, oat hay, and alfalfa; and\r\nwhen I began to figure the gross amount that would be required for my 50\r\nHolstein gourmands, I saw that the widow's farm had been purchased none\r\ntoo quickly. To provide 100 tons of grain, 125 tons of hay, and 200 or\r\n300 tons of corn fodder for the cows alone, was no slight matter; but I\r\nfelt prepared to furnish this amount of raw material to be transmuted\r\ninto golden butter. The Four Oaks butter had made a good reputation, and\r\nthe four oak leaves stamped on each mould was a sufficient guarantee of\r\nexcellence. My city grocer urged a larger product, and I felt safe in\r\npromising it; at the same time, I held him up for a slight advance in\r\nprice. Heretofore it had netted me 32 cents a pound, but from January 1,\r\n1898, I was to have 33-1/3 cents for each pound delivered at the station\r\nat Exeter, I agreeing to furnish at least 50 pounds a day, six days in a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThis was not always easily done during the first eight months of that\r\nyear, and I will confess to buying 640 pounds to eke out the supply for\r\nthe colony; but after the young heifers came in, there was no trouble,\r\nand the purchased butter was more than made up to our local grocer.\r\n\r\nIt will be more satisfactory to deal with dairy matters in lump sums\r\nfrom now on. The contract with the city grocer still holds, and, though\r\nhe often urges me to increase my herd, I still limit the supply to 300\r\npounds a week,--sometimes a little more, but rarely less. I believe that\r\n38 to 44 cows in full flow of milk will make the best balance in my\r\nfactory; and a well-balanced factory is what I am after.\r\n\r\nI am told that animals are not machines, and that they cannot be run as\r\nsuch. My animals are; and I run them as I would a shop. There is no\r\nsentiment in my management. If a cow or a hog or a hen doesn't work in a\r\nsatisfactory way, it ceases to occupy space in my shop, just as would\r\nan imperfect wheel. The utmost kindness is shown to all animals at Four\r\nOaks. This rule is the most imperative one on the place, and the one in\r\nwhich no \"extenuating circumstances\" are taken into account. There are\r\ntwo equal reasons for this: the first is a deep-rooted aversion to\r\ncruelty in all forms; and the second is, _it pays_. But kindness to\r\nanimals doesn't imply the necessity of keeping useless ones or those\r\nwhose usefulness is below one's standard. If a man will use the\r\nintelligence and attention to detail in the management of stock that is\r\nnecessary to the successful running of a complicated machine, he will\r\nfind that his stock doesn't differ greatly from his machine. The trouble\r\nwith most farmers is that they think the living machine can be neglected\r\nwith impunity, because it will not immediately destroy itself or others,\r\nand because it is capable of a certain amount of self-maintenance; while\r\nthe dead machine has no power of self-support, and must receive careful\r\nand punctual attention to prevent injury to itself and to other\r\nproperty. If a dairyman will feed his cows as a thresher feeds the\r\ncylinder of his threshing-machine, he will find that the milk will flow\r\nfrom the one about as steadily as the grain falls from the other.\r\n\r\nIntensive factory farming means the use of the best machines pushed to\r\nthe limit of their capacity through the period of their greatest\r\nusefulness, and then replaced by others. Pushing to the limit of\r\ncapacity is in no sense cruelty. It is predicated on the perfect health\r\nof the animal, for without perfect condition, neither machine nor animal\r\ncan do its best work. It is simply encouraging to a high degree the\r\nspecial function for which generations of careful breeding have fitted\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\nThat there is gratification in giving milk, no well-bred cow or mother\r\nwill deny. It is a joyous function to eat large quantities of pleasant\r\nfood and turn it into milk. Heredity impels the cow to do this, and it\r\nwould take generations of wild life to wean her from it. As well say\r\nthat the cataleptic trance of the pointer, when the game bird lies close\r\nand the delicate scent fills his nostrils, is not a joy to him, or that\r\nthe Dalmatian at the heels of his horse, or the foxhound when Reynard's\r\ntrail is warm, receive no pleasure from their specialties.\r\n\r\nDo these animals feel no joy in the performance of service which is bred\r\ninto their bones and which it is unnatural or freakish for them to lack?\r\nNo one who has watched the \"bred-for-milk\" cow can doubt that the joys\r\nof her life are eating, drinking, sleeping, and giving milk. Pushing her\r\nto the limit of her capacity is only intensifying her life, though,\r\npossibly, it may shorten it by a year or two. While she lives she knows\r\nall the happiness of cow life, and knows it to the full. What more can\r\nshe ask? She would starve on the buffalo grass which supports her\r\nhalf-wild sister, \"northers\" would freeze her, and the snow would bury\r\nher. She is a product of high cow-civilization, and as such she must\r\nhave the intelligent care of man or she cannot do her best. With this\r\ncare she is a marvellous machine for the making of the only article of\r\nfood which in itself is competent to support life in man. If my\r\nHolsteins are not machines, they resemble them so closely that I will\r\nnot quarrel with the name.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the cow, is true also of the pork-making machine that we\r\ncall the hog. His wild and savage progenitor is lost, and we have in his\r\nplace a sluggish animal that is a very model as a food producer. His\r\nthree pleasures are eating, sleeping, and growing fat. He follows these\r\npleasures with such persistence that 250 days are enough to perfect him.\r\nIt can certainly be no hardship to a pig to encourage him in a life of\r\nsloth and gluttony which appeals to his taste and to my profit.\r\n\r\nCustom and interest make his life ephemeral; I make it comfortable. From\r\nthe day of his birth until we separate, I take watchful care of him.\r\nDuring infancy he is protected from cold and wet, and his mother is\r\ncoddled by the most nourishing foods, that she may not fail in her duty\r\nto him. During childhood he is provided with a warm house, a clean bed,\r\nand a yard in which to disport himself, and is fed for growth and bone\r\non skim-milk, oatmeal, and sweet alfalfa. During his youth, corn meal is\r\nliberally added to his diet, also other dainties which he enjoys and\r\nmakes much of; and during his whole life he has access to clean water,\r\nand to the only medicine which a pig needs,--a mixture of ashes,\r\ncharcoal, salt, and sulphur.\r\n\r\nWhen he has spent 250 happy days with me, we part company with feelings\r\nof mutual respect,--he to finish his mission, I to provide for his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nMy early plan was to turn off 200 of this finished product each year,\r\nbut I soon found that I could do much better. One can raise a crop of\r\nhogs nearly as quickly as a crop of corn, and with much more profit, if\r\nthe food be at hand. There was likely to be an abundance of food. I was\r\nmore willing to sell it in pig skins than in any other packages. My plan\r\nwas now to turn off, not 200 hogs each year, but 600 or more. I had 60\r\nwell-bred sows, young and old, and I could count on them to farrow at\r\nleast three times in two years. The litters ought to average 7 each, say\r\n22 pigs in two years; 60 times 22 are 1320, and half of 1320 is 660.\r\nYes, at that rate, I could count on about 600 finished hogs to sell each\r\nyear. But if my calculations were too high, I could easily keep 10 more\r\nbrood sows, for I had sufficient room to keep them healthy.\r\n\r\nThe two five-acre lots, Nos. 3 and 5, had been given over to the brood\r\nsows when they were not caring for young litters in the brood-house.\r\nComfortable shelters and a cemented basin twelve feet by twelve, and one\r\nfoot deep, had been built in each lot. The water-pipe that ran through\r\nthe chicken lot (No. 4) connected with these basins, as did also a\r\ndrain-pipe to the drain in the north lane, so that it was easy to turn\r\non fresh water and to draw off that which was soiled. Through this\r\ndevice my brood sows had access to a water bath eight inches deep,\r\nwhenever they were in the fields. My hogs, young or old, have never been\r\npermitted to wallow in mud. We have no mud-holes at Four Oaks to grow\r\nstale and breed disease. The breeding hogs have exercise lots and baths,\r\nbut the young growing and fattening stock have neither. They are kept in\r\nruns twenty feet by one hundred, in bunches of from twenty to forty,\r\naccording to age, from the time they are weaned until they leave the\r\nplace for good. This plan, which I did not intend to change, opened a\r\nquestion in my mind that gave me pause. It was this: Can I hope, even\r\nwith the utmost care, to keep the house for growing and fattening swine\r\nfree from disease if I keep it constantly full of swine?\r\n\r\nThe more I thought about it the less probable it appeared. The pig-house\r\nhad cost me $4320. Another would cost as much, if not more, and I did\r\nnot like to go to the expense unless it were necessary. I worked over\r\nthis problem for several days, and finally came to the conclusion that\r\nI should never feel easy about my swine until I had two houses for them,\r\nbesides the brood-house for the sows. I therefore gave the order to\r\nNelson to build another swine-house as soon as spring opened. My plan\r\nwas, and I carried it out, to move all the colonies every three months,\r\nand to have the vacant house thoroughly cleaned, sprayed with a powerful\r\ngermicide, and whitewashed. The runs were to be turned over, when the\r\nweather would permit, and the ground sown to oats or rye.\r\n\r\nThe new house was finished in June, and the pigs were moved into it on\r\nJuly 1st with a lease of three months. My mind has been easy on the\r\nquestion of the health of my hogs ever since; and with reason, for there\r\nhas been no epizoötic or other serious form of disease in my piggery, in\r\nspite of the fact that there are often more than 1200 pigs of all\r\ndegrees crowded into this five-acre lot. The two pig-houses and the\r\nbrood-house, with their runs, cover the whole of the lot, except the\r\nbroad street of sixty feet just inside my high quarantine fence, which\r\nencloses the whole of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nBACON AND EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nEach hog turned out from my piggery weighing 270 pounds or more, has\r\neaten of my substance not less than 500 pounds of grain, 250 pounds of\r\nchopped alfalfa, 250 pounds of roots or vegetables, and such quantities\r\nof skimmed milk and swill as have fallen to his share. I could reckon\r\nthe approximate cost of these foods, but I will not do so. All but the\r\nmiddlings and oil meal come from the farm and are paid for by certain\r\nfixed charges heretofore mentioned. The middlings and oil meal are\r\ncharged in the \"food for animals\" account at the rate of $1 a year for\r\neach finished hog.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that a large part of the food which enters into the making\r\nof each 300 pounds of live pork, is of slow sale, and that for some of\r\nit there is no sale at all,--for instance, house swill, dish-water,\r\nbutter-washings, garden weeds, lawn clippings, and all sorts of coarse\r\nvegetables. A hog makes half his growth out of refuse which has no\r\nvalue, or not sufficient to warrant the effort and expense of selling\r\nit. He has unequalled facilities for turning non-negotiable scrip into\r\nconvertible bonds, and he is the greatest moneymaker on the farm. If\r\nthe grain ration were all corn, and if there were a roadside market for\r\nit at 35 cents a bushel, it would cost $3.12; the alfalfa would be worth\r\n$1.45, and the vegetables probably 65 cents, under like conditions,\r\nmaking a total of $5.22 as a possible gross value of the food which the\r\nhog has eaten. The gross value of these things, however, is far above\r\ntheir net value when one considers time and expense of sale. The hog\r\nsaves all this trouble by tucking under his skin slow-selling remnants\r\nof farm products and making of them finished assets which can be turned\r\ninto cash at a day's notice.\r\n\r\nTo feed the hogs on the scale now planned, I had to provide for\r\nsomething like 7000 bushels of grain, chiefly corn and oats, 100 tons of\r\nalfalfa, and an equal amount of vegetables, chiefly sugar beets and\r\nmangel-wurzel. Certainly the widow's land would be needed.\r\n\r\nThe poultry had also outgrown my original plans, and I had built with\r\nreference to my larger views. There were five houses on the poultry lot,\r\neach 200 feet long, and each divided into ten equal pens. Four of these\r\nhouses were for the laying hens, which were divided into flocks of 40\r\neach; while the other house was for the growing chickens and for\r\ncockerels being fattened for market.\r\n\r\nThere were now on hand more than 1300 pullets and hens, and I instructed\r\nSam to run his incubator overtime that season, so as to fill our houses\r\nby autumn. I should need 800 or 900 pullets to make our quota good, for\r\nmost of the older hens would have to be disposed of in the autumn,--all\r\nbut about 200, which would be kept until the following spring to breed\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nI believe that a three-year-old hen that has shown the egg habit is the\r\nbest fowl to breed from, and it is the custom at Four Oaks to reserve\r\nspecially good pens for this purpose. The egg habit is unquestionably as\r\nmuch a matter of heredity as the milk or the fat producing habit, and\r\nshould be as carefully cultivated. With this end in view, Sam added\r\nyoung cockerels to four of his best-producing flocks on January 1, and\r\nby the 15th he was able to start his incubators.\r\n\r\nBreeding and feeding for eggs is on the same principle as feeding and\r\nbreeding for milk. It is no more natural for a hen to lay eggs for human\r\nconsumption than it is for the robin to do so, or for the cow to give\r\nmore milk than is sufficient for her calf. Man's necessity has made\r\ndemands upon both cow and hen, and man's intelligence has converted\r\nindividualists into socialists in both of these races. They no longer\r\nlive for themselves alone. As the cow, under favorable conditions, finds\r\npleasure in giving milk, so does the hen under like conditions take\r\ndelight in giving eggs,--else why the joyous cackle when leaving her\r\nnest after doing her full duty? She gloats over it, and glories in it,\r\nand announces her satisfaction to the whole yard. It is something to be\r\nproud of, and the cackling hen knows it better than you or I. It can be\r\nno hardship to push this egg machine to the limit of its capacity. It\r\nadds new zest to the life of the hen, and multiplies her opportunities\r\nfor well-earned self-congratulation.\r\n\r\nOur hens are fed for eggs, and we get what we feed for. I said of my\r\nhens that I would not ask them to lay more than eight dozen eggs each\r\nyear, and I will stick to what I said. But I do not reject voluntary\r\ncontributions beyond this number. Indeed, I accept them with thanks, and\r\ngive Biddy a word of commendation for her gratuity. Eight dozen eggs a\r\nyear will pay a good profit, but if each of my hens wishes to present me\r\nwith two dozen more, I slip 62 cents into my pocket and say, \"I am very\r\nmuch obliged to you, miss,\" or madam, as the case may be. Most of my\r\nhens do remember me in this substantial way, and the White Wyandottes\r\nare in great favor with the Headman.\r\n\r\nThe houses in which my hens live are almost as clean as the one I\r\ninhabit (and Polly is tidy to a degree); their food is as carefully\r\nprepared as mine, and more punctually served; their enemies are fended\r\noff, and they are never frightened by dogs or other animals, for the\r\nfive-acre lot on which their houses and runs are built is enclosed by a\r\nsubstantial fence that prevents any interloping; book agents never\r\ndisturb their siestas, nor do tree men make their lives hideous with\r\nlithographs of impossible fruit on improbable trees. Whether I am\r\nindebted to one or to all of these conditions for my full egg baskets, I\r\nam unable to say; but I do not purpose to make any change, for my egg\r\nbaskets are as full as a reasonable man could wish. As nearly as I can\r\nestimate, my hens give thirty per cent egg returns as a yearly\r\naverage--about 120 eggs for each hen in 365 days. This is more than I\r\nask of them, but I do not refuse their generosity.\r\n\r\nEvery egg is worth, in my market, 2-1/2 cents, which means that the\r\nyearly product of each hen could be sold for $3. Something more than two\r\nthousand dozen are consumed by the home colony or the incubators; the\r\nrest find their way to the city in clean cartons of one dozen each, with\r\na stencil of Four Oaks and a guarantee that they are not twenty-four\r\nhours old when they reach the middleman.\r\n\r\nIn return for this $3 a year, what do I give my hens besides a clean\r\nhouse and yard? A constant supply of fresh water, sharp grits, oyster\r\nshells, and a bath of road dust and sifted ashes, to which is added a\r\npinch of insect powder. Twice each day five pounds of fresh skim-milk is\r\ngiven to each flock of forty. In the morning they have a warm mash\r\ncomposed of (for 1600 hens) 50 pounds of alfalfa hay cut fine and soaked\r\nall night in hot water, 50 pounds of corn meal, 50 pounds of oat meal,\r\n50 pounds of bran, and 20 pounds of either meat meal or cotton-seed\r\nmeal. At noon they get 100 pounds of mixed grains--wheat and buckwheat\r\nusually--with some green vegetables to pick at; and at night 125 to 150\r\npounds of whole corn. There are variations of this diet from time to\r\ntime, but no radical change. I have read much of a balanced ration, but\r\nI fancy a hen will balance her own ration if you give her the chance.\r\n\r\nMilk is one of the most important items on this bill of fare, and all\r\nhens love it. It should be fed entirely fresh, and the crocks or earthen\r\ndishes from which it is eaten should be thoroughly cleansed each day.\r\nFour ounces for each hen is a good daily ration, and we divide this into\r\ntwo feedings.\r\n\r\nOur 1600 hens eat about 75 tons of grain a year. Add to this the 100\r\ntons which 50 cows will require, 200 tons for the swine, and 25 tons for\r\nthe horses, and we have 400 tons of grain to provide for the stock on\r\nthe factory farm. Nearly a fourth of this, in the shape of bran, gluten\r\nmeal, oil meal, and meat meal, must be purchased, for we have no way of\r\nproducing it. For the other 300 tons we must look to the land or to a\r\nlow market. Three hundred tons of mixed grains means something like\r\n13,000 bushels, and I cannot hope to raise this amount from my land at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nFortunately the grain market was to my liking in January of 1898; and\r\nthough there were still more than 7000 bushels in my granary, I\r\npurchased 5000 bushels of corn and as much oats against a higher market.\r\nThe corn cost 27 cents a bushel and the oats 22, delivered at Exeter,\r\nthe 10,000 bushels amounting to $2450, to be charged to the farm\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nI was now prepared to face the food problem, for I had more than 17,000\r\nbushels of grain to supplement the amount the farm would produce, and to\r\ntide me along until cheap grain should come again, or until my land\r\nshould produce enough for my needs. The supply in hand plus that which I\r\ncould reasonably expect to raise, would certainly provide for three\r\nyears to come, and this is farther than the average farmer looks into\r\nthe future. But I claim to be more enterprising than an average farmer,\r\nand determined to keep my eyes open and to take advantage of any\r\nfavorable opportunity to strengthen my position.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was necessary to force my trees, and to secure more\r\nhelp for the farm work. To push fruit trees to the limit of healthy\r\ngrowth is practical and wise. They can accomplish as much in growth and\r\ndevelopment in three years, when judiciously stimulated, as in five or\r\nsix years of the \"lick-and-a-promise\" kind of care which they usually\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\nA tree must be fed first for growth and afterward for fruit, just as a\r\npig is managed, if one wishes quick returns. To plant a tree and leave\r\nit to the tenderness of nature, with only occasional attention, is to\r\nmake the heart sick, for it is certain to prove a case of hope deferred.\r\nIn the fulness of time the tree and \"happy-go-lucky\" nature will prove\r\nthemselves equal to the development of fruit; but they will be slow in\r\ndoing it. It is quite as well for the tree, and greatly to the advantage\r\nof the horticulturist, to cut two or three years out of this\r\nunprofitable time. All that is necessary to accomplish this is: to keep\r\nthe ground loose for a space around the tree somewhat larger than the\r\nspread of its branches; to apply fertilizers rich in nitrogen; to keep\r\nthe whole of the cultivated space mulched with good barn-yard manure,\r\nincreasing the thickness of the mulch with coarse stuff in the fall, so\r\nas to lengthen the season of root activity; and to draw the mulch aside\r\nabout St. Patrick's Day, that the sun's rays may warm the earth as early\r\nas possible. Moderate pruning, nipping back of exuberant branches, and\r\ntwo sprayings of the foliage with Bordeaux mixture, to keep fungus\r\nenemies in check, comprise all the care required by the growing tree.\r\nThis treatment will condense the ordinary growth of five years into\r\nthree, and the tree will be all the better for the forcing.\r\n\r\nAs soon as fruit spurs and buds begin to show themselves, the treatment\r\nshould be modified, but not remitted. Less nitrogen and more phosphoric\r\nacid and potash are to be used, and the mulch should _not_ be removed\r\nin the early spring. The objects now are, to stimulate the fruit buds\r\nand to retard activity in the roots until the danger from late frosts is\r\npast. As a result of this kind of treatment, many varieties of apple\r\ntrees will give moderate crops when the roots are seven, and the trunks\r\nare six years old. Fruit buds showed in abundance on many of my trees in\r\nthe fall of 1897, especially on the Duchess and the Yellow Transparent,\r\nand I looked for a small apple harvest that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nTHE OLD TIME FARM-HAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all my industries thus increasing, the necessity for more help\r\nbecame imperative. French and Judson had their hands more than full in\r\nthe dairy barns, and had to be helped out by Thompson. Anderson could\r\nnot give the swine all the attention they needed, and was assisted by\r\nOtto, who proved an excellent swineherd. Sam had the aid of Lars's boys\r\nwith the poultry, and very efficient aid it was, considering the time\r\nthey could give to it. They had to be off with the market wagon at 7.40,\r\nand did not return from school until 4 P.M. Lars was busy in the\r\ncarriage barn; and though we spared him as much as possible from\r\ndriving, he had to be helped out by Johnson at such times as the latter\r\ncould spare from his greenhouse and hotbeds. Zeb took care of the farm\r\nteams; but the winter's work of distributing forage and grain, getting\r\nup wood and ice, hauling manure, and so forth, had to be done in a\r\ndesultory and irregular manner. The spring work would find us wofully\r\nbehindhand if I did not look sharp. I had been looking sharp since\r\nJanuary set in, and had experienced, for the first time, real\r\ndifficulties in finding anything like good help. Hitherto I had been\r\nespecially fortunate in this regard. I had met some reverses, but in the\r\nmain good luck had followed me. I had nine good men who seemed contented\r\nand who were all saving money,--an excellent sign of stability and\r\ncontentment. Even Lars had not fallen from grace but once, and that\r\ncould hardly be charged against him, for Jack and Jarvis had tempted him\r\nbeyond resistance; while Sam's nose was quite blanched, and he was to\r\nall appearances firmly seated on the water wagon. Really, I did not know\r\nwhat labor troubles meant until 1898, but since then I have not had\r\nclear sailing.\r\n\r\nFrom my previous experience with working-men, I had formed the opinion\r\nthat they were reasoning and reasonable human beings,--with\r\npeculiarities, of course; and that as a class they were ready to give\r\ngood service for fair wages and decent treatment. In early life I had\r\nbeen a working-man myself, and I thought I could understand the feelings\r\nand sympathize with the trials of the laborer from the standpoint of\r\npersonal experience. I was sorely mistaken. The laboring man of to-day\r\nis a different proposition from the man who did manual labor \"before the\r\nwar.\" That he is more intelligent, more provident, happier, or better in\r\nany way, I sincerely doubt; that he is restless, dissatisfied, and less\r\nefficient, I believe; that he is unreasonable in his demands and\r\nregardless of the interests of his employer, I know. There are many\r\nshining exceptions, and to these I look for the ultimate regeneration of\r\nlabor; but the rule holds true.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the principles of life have changed in forty\r\nyears. I do not believe that an intelligent, able-bodied man need be a\r\nservant all his life, or that industry and economy miss their rewards,\r\nor that there is any truth in the theory that men cannot rise out of the\r\nrut in which they happen to find themselves. The trouble is with the\r\nman, not with the rut. He spends his time in wallowing rather than in\r\ndiligently searching for an outlet or in honestly working his way up to\r\nit. Heredity and environment are heavy weights, but industry and\r\nsobriety can carry off heavier ones. I have sympathy for weakness of\r\nbody or mind, and patience for those over whom inheritance has cast a\r\nbaleful spell; but I have neither patience nor sympathy for a strong man\r\nwho rails at his condition and makes no determined effort to better it.\r\n\r\nThe time and money wasted in strikes, agitations, and arbitrations, if\r\nput to practical use, would better the working-man enough faster than\r\nthese futile efforts do. I have no quarrel with unions or combinations\r\nof labor, so far as they have the true interests of labor for an object;\r\nbut I do quarrel with the spirit of mob rule and the evidences of\r\nconspicuous waste, which have grown so rampant as to overshadow the\r\nhelpful hand and to threaten, not the stability of society--for in the\r\nbackground I see six million conservative sons of the soil who will look\r\nto the stability of things when the time comes--but the unions\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI remember my first summer on a farm. It lasted from the first day of\r\nApril to the thirty-first day of October, and on the evening of that day\r\nI carried to my father $28, the full wage for seven months. I could not\r\nhave spent one cent during that time, for I carried the whole sum home;\r\nbut I do not remember that I was conscious of any want. The hours on the\r\nfarm were not short; an eight-hour day would have been considered but a\r\nhalf-day. We worked from sun to sun, and I grew and knew no sorrow or\r\noppression. The next year I received the munificent wage of $6 a month,\r\nand the following year, $8.\r\n\r\nIn after years, in brick-yards, sawmills, lumber woods, or harvest\r\nfields, there was no arbitrary limit put upon the amount of work to be\r\ndone. If I chose to do the work of a man and a half, I got $1.50 for\r\ndoing it, and it would have been a bold and sturdy delegate who tried to\r\nhold me from it. I felt no need of help from outside. I was fit to care\r\nfor myself, and I minded not the long hours, the hard work, or the hard\r\nbed. This life was preliminary to a fuller one, and it served its use.\r\nI know what tired legs and back mean, and I know that one need not have\r\nthem always if he will use the ordinary sense which God gives. Genius,\r\nor special cleverness, is not necessary to get a man out of the rut of\r\nhard manual labor. Just plain, everyday sense will do. But before I had\r\nsecured the three men for whom I was in search, I began to feel that\r\nthis common sense of which we speak so glibly is a rare commodity under\r\nthe working-man's hat. I advertised, sent to agencies and intelligence\r\noffices, interviewed and inspected, consulted friends and enemies, and\r\nso generally harrowed my life that I was fit to give up the whole\r\nbusiness and retire into a cave.\r\n\r\nBy actual count, I saw more than one hundred men, of all ages, sizes,\r\nand colors. Eight of these were tried, of whom five were found wanting.\r\nEarly in February I had settled upon three sober men to add to our\r\ncolony. As none of these lasted the year out, I may be forgiven for not\r\nintroducing them to the reader. They served their purpose, and mine too,\r\nand then drifted on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nTHE SYNDICATE\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not wish to take credit for things which gave me pleasure in the\r\ndoing, or to appear altruistic in my dealings with the people employed\r\nat Four Oaks. I tell of our business and other relations because they\r\nare details of farm history and rightfully belong to these pages. If I\r\ndealt fairly by my men and established relations of mutual confidence\r\nand dependence, it was not in the hope that my ways might be approved\r\nand commended, but because it paid, in more ways than one. I wanted my\r\nmen to have a lively interest in the things which were of importance to\r\nme, that their efforts might be intelligent and direct; and I was glad\r\nto enter into their schemes, either for pleasure or for profit, with\r\nsuch aid as I could give. Cordial understanding between employee and\r\nemployer puts life into the contract, and disposes of perfunctory\r\nservice, which simply recognizes a definite deed for a definite\r\ncompensation. Uninterested labor leaves a load of hay in the field to be\r\ninjured, just because the hour for quitting has come, while interested\r\nlabor hurries the hay into the barn to make it safe, knowing that the\r\nextra half-hour will be made up to it in some other way.\r\n\r\nIt pays the farmer to take his help into a kind of partnership, not\r\nalways in his farm, but always in his consideration. That is why my\r\nfarm-house was filled with papers and magazines of interest to the men;\r\nthat is why I spent many an evening with them talking over our\r\nindustries; that is why I purchased an organ for them when I found that\r\nMrs. French, the dairymaid, could play on it; that is why I talked\r\neconomy to them and urged them to place some part of each month's wage\r\nin the Exeter Savings Bank; and that is why, early in 1898, I formulated\r\na plan for investing their wages at a more profitable rate of interest.\r\nI asked each one to give me a statement of his or her savings up to\r\ndate. They were quite willing to do this, and I found that the aggregate\r\nfor the eight men and three women was $2530. Anderson, who saved most of\r\nhis wages, had an account in a city savings bank, and did not join us in\r\nour syndicate, though he approved of it.\r\n\r\nThe money was made up of sums varying from $90, Lena's savings, to $460\r\nowned by Judson, the buggy man. My proposition was this: Pool the funds,\r\nbuy Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific stock, and hold it for one or two\r\nyears. The interest would be twice as much as they were getting from\r\nthe bank, while the prospect of a decided advance was good. I said to\r\nthem:--\r\n\r\n\"I have owned Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific stock for more than\r\nthree years. I commenced to buy at fifty-seven, and I am still buying,\r\nwhen I can get hold of a little money that doesn't have to go into this\r\nblessed farm. It is now eighty-one, and it will go higher. I am so sure\r\nof this that I will agree to take the stock from each or all of you at\r\nthe price you pay for it at any time during the next two years. There is\r\nno risk in this proposition to you, and there may be a very handsome\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nThey were pleased with the plan, and we formed a pool to buy thirty\r\nshares of stock. Thompson and I were trustees, and the certificate stood\r\nin our names; but each contributor received a pro-rata interest; Lena,\r\none thirtieth; Judson, five-thirtieths; and the others between these\r\nextremes. The stock was bought at eighty-two. I may as well explain now\r\nhow it came out, for I am not proud of my acumen at the finish. A little\r\nmore than a year later the stock reached 122, and I advised the\r\nsyndicate to sell. They were all pleased at the time with the handsome\r\nprofit they had made, but I suspect they have often figured what they\r\nmight have made \"if the boss hadn't been such a chump,\" for we have seen\r\nthe stock go above two hundred.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only enterprise in which our colony took a small share.\r\nThe people at Four Oaks are now content to hold shares in one of the\r\ngreat trusts, which they bought several points below par, and which pay\r\n1¾. per cent every three months. Even Lena, who held only one share of\r\nthe C., R.I., & P. five years ago, has so increased her income-bearing\r\nproperty that she is now looked upon as a \"catch\" by her acquaintances.\r\nIf I am correctly informed, she has an annual income of $105,\r\nindependent of her wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF SIR TOM\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 7.30 on the morning of March 16, Dr. High telephoned me that Sir\r\nThomas O'Hara was seriously ill, and asked me to come at once. It took\r\nbut a few minutes to have Jerry at the door, and, breasting a cold, thin\r\nrain at a sharp gallop, I was at my friend's door before the clock\r\nstruck eight. Dr. High met me with a heavy face.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Tom is bad,\" said he, \"with double pneumonia, and I am awfully\r\nafraid it will go hard with him.\"\r\n\r\nI remembered that my friend's pale face had looked a shade paler than\r\nusual the evening before, and that there had been a pinched expression\r\naround the nose and mouth, as if from pain; but Sir Tom had many twinges\r\nfrom his old enemy, gout, which he did not care to discuss, and I took\r\nlittle note of his lack of fitness. He touched the brandy bottle a\r\nlittle oftener than usual, and left for home earlier; but his voice was\r\nas cheery as ever, and we thought only of gout. He was taken with a hard\r\nchill on his way home, which lasted for some time after he was put to\r\nbed; but he would not listen to the requests of William and the faithful\r\ncook that the doctor be summoned. At last he fell into a heavy sleep\r\nfrom which it was hard to rouse him, and the servants followed their own\r\ndesire and called Dr. High. He came as promptly as possible, and did all\r\nthat could be done for the sick man.\r\n\r\nA hurried examination convinced me that Dr. High's opinion of the\r\ngravity of the case was correct, and we telephoned at once for a\r\nspecialist from the city, and for a trained nurse. After a short\r\nconsultation with Dr. High I reëntered my friend's room, and I fear that\r\nmy face gave me away, for Sir Tom said:--\r\n\r\n\"Be a man, Williams, and tell the whole of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear old man, this is a tough proposition, but you must buck up and\r\nmake a game fight. We have sent for Dr. Jones and a nurse, and we will\r\npull you through, sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will try, for sure, but I reckon the call has come for me to cash\r\nin me checks. When that little devil Frost hit me right and left in me\r\nchest last night, I could see me finish; and I heard the banshee in me\r\nsleep, and that means much to a Sligo man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to this Sligo man, I hope,\" said I, though I knew that we were in\r\ndeep waters.\r\n\r\nThe wise man and the nurse came out on the 10.30 train, the nurse\r\nbringing comfort and aid, but the physician neither. After thoroughly\r\nexamining the patient, he simply confirmed our fears.\r\n\r\n\"Serious disease to overcome, and only scant vital forces; no reasonable\r\nground for hope.\"\r\n\r\nSir Tom gave me a smile as I entered the room after parting from the\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\n\"I've discounted the verdict,\" said he, \"and the foreman needn't draw\r\nsuch a long face. I've had my fling, like a true Irishman, and I'm ready\r\nto pay the bill. I won't have to come back for anything, Williams;\r\nthere's nothing due me; but I must look sharp for William and the old\r\ngirl in the kitchen,--faithful souls,--for they will be strangers in a\r\nstrange land. Will you send for a lawyer?\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer came, and a codicil to Sir Thomas's will made the servants\r\ncomfortable for life. All that day and the following night we hung\r\naround the sick bed, hoping for the favorable change that never came. On\r\nthe morning of the 17th it was evident that he would not live to see the\r\nsun go down. We had kept all friends away from the sick chamber; but\r\nnow, at his request, Polly, Jane, and Laura were summoned, and they\r\ncame, with blanched faces and tearful eyes, to kiss the brow and hold\r\nthe hands of this dear man. He smiled with contentment on the group, and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Me friends have made such a heaven of this earth that perhaps I have\r\nhad me full share.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Tom,\" said I, \"shall I send for a priest?\"\r\n\r\n\"A priest! What could I do with a priest? Me forebears were on the\r\nOrange side of Boyne Water, and we have never changed color.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to see a clergyman?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; just the grip of a friend's hand and these angels around me.\r\nAsking pardon is not me long suit, Williams, but perhaps the time has\r\ncome for me to play it. If the good God will be kind to me I will thank\r\nHim, as a gentleman should, and I will take no advantage of His\r\nkindness; but if He cannot see His way clear to do that, I will take\r\nwhat is coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir Tom,\" said Jane, with streaming eyes, \"God cannot be hard with\r\nyou, who have been so good to every one.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there's little harm in me life, there's but scant good, too; I can't\r\nfind much credit. Me good angel has had an easy time of it, more's the\r\npity; but Janie, if you love me, Le Bon Dieu will not be hard on me. He\r\ncannot be severe with a poor Irishman who never stacked the cards,\r\npulled a race, or turned his back on a friend, and who is loved by an\r\nangel.\"\r\n\r\nI asked Sir Tom what we should do for him after he had passed away.\r\n\r\n\"It would be foine to sleep in the woods just back of Janie's forge,\r\nwhere I could hear the click of her hammer if the days get lonely; but\r\nthere's a little castle, God save the mark, out from Sligo. Me forebears\r\nare there,--the lucky ones,--and me wish is to sleep with them; but I\r\ndoubt it can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it can be, and it shall be, too,\" said Polly. \"We will all go\r\nwith you, Sir Tom, when June comes, and you shall sleep in your own\r\nground with your own kin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't deserve it, Mrs. Williams, indeed I don't, but I would lie\r\neasier there. That sod has known us for a thousand years, and it's the\r\ngreenest, softest, kindest sod in all the world; but little I'll mind\r\nwhen the breath is gone. I'll not be asking that much of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear old chap, we won't lose sight of you until that green sod\r\ncovers the stanchest heart that ever beat. Polly is right. We'll go with\r\nyou to Sligo,--all of us,--Polly and Jane and Jack and I, and Kate and\r\nthe babies, too, if we can get them. You shall not be lonesome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lonesome, is it? I'll be in the best of company. Me heart is at rest\r\nfrom this moment, and I'll wait patiently until I can show you Sligo.\r\nThis is a fine country, Mrs. Williams, and it has given me the truest\r\nfriends in all the world, but the ground is sweet in Sligo.\"\r\n\r\nHis breath came fainter and faster, and we could see that it would soon\r\ncease. After resting a few minutes, Sir Tom said:--\r\n\r\n\"Me lady Laura, do you mind that prayer song, the second verse?\"\r\n\r\nLaura's voice was sobbing and uncertain as it quavered:--\r\n\r\n    \"Other refuge have I none,\"\r\n\r\nbut it gained courage and persuasiveness until it filled the room and\r\nthe heart of the man with,--\r\n\r\n    \"Cover my defenceless head,\r\n    With the shadow of Thy wing.\"\r\n\r\nA gentle smile and the relaxing of closed hands completed the story of\r\nour loss, though the real weight of it came days and months later.\r\n\r\nIt was long before we could take up our daily duties with anything like\r\nthe familiar happiness. Something had gone out of our lives that could\r\nnever be replaced, and only time could salve the wounds. The dear man\r\nwho had gone was no friend to solemn faces, and living interests must\r\nbury dead memories; but it was a long time before the click of Jane's\r\nhammer was heard in her forge; not until Laura had said, \"It will please\r\n_him_, Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\nBACTERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary, February, and March passed with more than the usual snow and\r\nrain,--fully ten inches of precipitation; but the spring proved neither\r\ncold nor late. During these three months we sold butter to the amount of\r\n$1283, and $747 worth of eggs; in all, $2030.\r\n\r\nThe ploughs were started in the highest land on the 11th of April, and\r\nwere kept going steadily until they had turned over nearly 280 acres.\r\n\r\nI decided to put the whole of the widow's field into corn, lots 8, 12,\r\nand 15 (84 acres) into oats, and 50 acres of the orchards into roots and\r\nsweet fodder corn. Number 13 was to be sown with buckwheat as soon as\r\nthe rye was cut for green forage. I decided to raise more alfalfa, for\r\nwe could feed more to advantage, and it was fast gaining favor in my\r\nestablishment. It is so productive and so nutritious that I wonder it is\r\nnot more generally used by farmers who make a specialty of feeding\r\nstock. It contains as much protein as most grains, and is wholesome and\r\nhighly palatable if properly cured. It should be cut just as it is\r\ncoming into flower, and should be cured in the windrow. The leaves are\r\nthe most nutritious part of the plant, and they are apt to fall off if\r\nthe cutting be deferred, or if the curing be _done carelessly_.\r\n\r\nLot No. 9 was to be fitted for alfalfa as soon as the season would\r\npermit. First, it must receive a heavy dressing of manure, to be\r\nploughed under. The ordinary plough was to be followed in this case by a\r\nsubsoiler, to stir the earth as deep as possible. When the seed was\r\nsown, the land was to receive five hundred pounds an acre of high-grade\r\nfertilizer, and one hundred pounds an acre of infected soil.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar bacterium that thrives on congenial alfalfa soil is\r\nessential to the highest development of the plant. Without its presence\r\nthe grass fails in its chief function--the storing of nitrogen--and\r\nmakes but poor growth. When the alfalfa bacteria are abundant, the plant\r\nflourishes and gathers nitrogen in knobs and bunches in its roots and in\r\nthe joints of its stems.\r\n\r\nI sent to a very successful alfalfa grower in Ohio for a thousand pounds\r\nof soil from one of his fields, to vaccinate my field with. This is not\r\nalways necessary,--indeed, it rarely is, for alfalfa seed usually carry\r\nenough bacteria to inoculate favorable soils; but I wished to see if\r\nthis infected soil would improve mine. I have not been able to discover\r\nany marked advantage from its use; the reason being that my soil was so\r\nrich in humus and added manures that the colonies of bacteria on the\r\nseeds were quite sufficient to infect the whole mass. Under less\r\nfavorable conditions, artificial inoculation is of great advantage.\r\n\r\nWonderful are the secrets of nature. The infinitely small things seem to\r\nwork for us and the infinitely large ones appear suited to our use; and\r\nyet, perhaps, this is all \"seeming\" and \"appearing.\" We may ourselves be\r\nsimply more advanced bacteria, working blindly toward the solution of an\r\ninfinite problem in which we are concerned only as means to an end.\r\n\r\n\"Why should the spirit of mortal be proud,\" until it has settled its\r\nrelative position with both Sirius and the micro-organisms, or has\r\nestimated its stature by view-points from the bacterial world and from\r\nthe constellation of Lyra. Until we have been able to compare opinions\r\nfrom these extremes, if indeed they be extremes, we cannot expect to\r\nmake a correct estimate of our value in the economy of the universe. I\r\nfancy that we are apt to take ourselves too seriously, and that we will\r\nsometime marvel at the shadow which we did not cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\nMATCH-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home lot took on a home look in the spring of 1898. The lawn lost\r\nits appearance of newness; the trees became acquainted with each other;\r\nthe shrubs were on intimate terms with their neighbors, and broke into\r\nfriendly rivalry of blossoms; the gardens had a settled-down look, as if\r\nthey had come to stay; and even the wall flowers were enjoying\r\nthemselves. These efforts of nature to make us feel at ease were\r\nthankfully received by Polly and me, and we voted that this was more\r\nlike home than anything else we had ever had; and when the fruit trees\r\nput forth their promise of an autumn harvest in great masses of\r\nblossoms, we declared that we had made no mistake in transforming\r\nourselves from city to country folk.\r\n\r\n\"Aristocracy is of the land,\" said Polly. \"It always has been and\r\nalways will be the source of dignity and stability. I feel twice as\r\ngreat a lady as I did in the tall house on B---- Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you don't want to go back to that tall house, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I don't. Why should I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why you should, only I remember Lot's wife looked back\r\ntoward the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention that woman! She didn't know what she wanted. You won't\r\ncatch me looking toward the city, except once a week for three or four\r\nhours, and then I hurry back to the farm to see what has happened in my\r\ngarden while I've been away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about your friends, Polly?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know as well as I that we haven't lost a friend by living out here,\r\nand that we've tied some of them closer. No, sir! No more city life for\r\nme. It may do for young people, who don't know better, but not for me.\r\nIt's too restricted, and there's not enough excitement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Country life fits us like paper on the wall,\" said I, \"but how about\r\nthe youngsters? If we insist on keeping children, we must take them into\r\nour scheme of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we must, but children are an unknown quantity. They are _x_\r\nin the domestic problem, and we cannot tell what they stand for until\r\nthe problem is worked out. I don't see why we can't find the value of\r\n_x_ in the country as easily as in the city. They have had city and\r\nschool life, now let them see country life; the _x_ will stand for wide\r\nexperience at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jane likes it thus far,\" said I, \"and I think she will continue; but I\r\ndon't feel so sure about Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're as blind as a bat--or a man. Jane loves country life because\r\nshe's young and growing; but there's a subconscious sense which tells\r\nher that she's simply fitting herself to be carried off by that handsome\r\ngiant, Jim Jarvis. She doesn't know it, but it's the truth all the same,\r\nand it will come as sure as tide; and when it does come, her life will\r\nbe run into other moulds than we have made, no matter how carefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where this modern Hercules is most vulnerable. I'll slay him\r\nif I find him mousing around my Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will slay nothing, Mr. Headman, and you know it; you will just take\r\nwhat's coming to you, as others have done since the world was young.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I give fair warning; it's 'hands off Jane,' for lo, these many\r\nyears, or some one will be brewing 'harm tea' for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bark so loud no one will believe you can bite,\" said this saucy,\r\nmatch-making mother.\r\n\r\n\"How about Jack?\" said I. \"Have you settled the moulds he is to be run\r\nin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not entirely; but I am not as one without hope. Jack will be through\r\ncollege in June, and will go abroad with us for July and August; he will\r\nbe as busy as possible with the miners from the moment he comes back; he\r\nis much in love with Jessie, the Gordon's have no other child, the\r\nproperty is large, Homestead Farm is only three miles, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Slow up, Polly! Slow up! Your main line is all right, but your\r\nterminal facilities are bad. Jack is to be educated, travelled,\r\nemployed, engaged, married, endowed with Homestead Farm, and all that;\r\nbut you mustn't kill off the Gordons. I swing the red lantern in front\r\nof that train of thought. Let Jack and Jessie wait till we are through\r\nwith Four Oaks and the Gordons have no further use for Homestead Farm,\r\nbefore thinking of coupling that property on to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a greater goose than you can help,\" said Polly. \"You know what\r\nI mean. Men are so short-sighted! Laura says, 'the Headman ought to have\r\na small dog and a long stick'; but no matter, I'll keep an eye on the\r\nchildren, and you needn't worry about country life for them. They'll\r\ntake to it kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they ought to, if they have any appreciation of the fitness of\r\nthings. Did you ever see weather made to order before? I feel as if I\r\nhad been measured for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It suits my garden down to the ground,\" said Polly, who hates slang.\r\n\r\n\"It was planned for the farmer, madam. If it happens to fit the\r\nrose-garden mistress, it is a detail for you to note and be thankful\r\nfor, but the great things are outside the rose gardens. Look at that\r\ncorn-field! A crow could hide in it anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have crows hiding got to do with corn, I'd like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I was a boy the farmers used to say, 'If it will cover a crow's\r\nback on the Fourth of July, it will make good corn,' and I am farmering\r\nwith old saws when I can't find new ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all of three weeks yet to the Fourth of July, and your corn will\r\ncover a turkey by that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, but we shan't be here to see it, more's the pity, as Sir Tom\r\nwould say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Kate says she won't go over. She doesn't think it would\r\npay for so short a trip. Why do you insist upon eight weeks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, I like that! When did I ever insist on anything, Mrs.\r\nWilliams? Not since I knew you well, did I? But be honest, Polly. Who\r\nhas done the cutting down of this trip? You and the youngsters may stay\r\nas long as you please, but I will be back here September 1st unless the\r\n_Normania_ breaks a shaft.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could go _over_ on a German boat. I hate the Cunarders.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, but we must land at Queenstown. We must put Sir Tom under the\r\nsod at that little castle out from Sligo. Then we can do Holland and\r\nBelgium, and have a week or ten days in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be enough. I do hope Johnson will take good care of my\r\nflowers; it's the very most important time, you know, and if he neglects\r\nthem--\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't neglect them, Polly; even if he does, they can be easily\r\nreplaced. But the hay harvest, now, that's different; if they spoil the\r\ntimothy or cut the alfalfa too late!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother your alfalfa! What do I care for that? Kate's coming out with\r\nthe babies, and I'm going to put her in full charge of the gardens.\r\nShe'll look after them, I'm sure. I'll tell you another bit of news: Jim\r\nJarvis is bound to go with us, Jack says, and he has asked if we'll let\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you had that up your sleeve, young woman? I don't like it\r\na little bit! That is why you talked so like an oracle a little while\r\nago! What does Jane say?\"\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't say much, but I think she wouldn't object.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she can't object. You sick a big brute of a man on to a\r\nlittle girl, and she don't dare object; but I'll feed him to the fishes\r\nif he worries her.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure you will, Mr. Ogre. Anybody would be sure of that to hear\r\nyou talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't chaff me, Polly. This is a serious business. If you sell my girl,\r\nI'm going to buy a new one. I'll ask Jessie Gordon to go with us and, if\r\nJack is half the man I take him to be, he'll replenish our stock of\r\ngirls before we get back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is match-making now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what you call it. I shall take out letters of marque and\r\nreprisal. I won't raise girls to be carried off by the first privateer\r\nthat makes sail for them, without making some one else suffer. If\r\nJarvis goes, Jessie goes, that's flat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be an excellent plan, Mr. Bad Temper, and I've no doubt\r\nthat we can manage it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say 'we' when you talk of managing it. I tell you I'm entirely on\r\nthe defensive until some one robs me, then I'll take what is my\r\nneighbor's if I can get it. If it were not for my promise to Sir Tom, I\r\nwouldn't leave the farm for a minute! And I would establish a quarantine\r\nagainst all giants for at least five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know you like Jarvis. He is one of the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Polly. He's as fine as silk, but he isn't fine enough\r\nfor our Jane yet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\n\"I TOLD YOU SO\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be the limitless horizon, it may be the comradery of confinement,\r\nit may be the old superstition of a plank between one and eternity, or\r\nit may be some occult influence of ship and ocean; but certain it is\r\nthat there is no such place in all the world as a deck of a\r\ntransatlantic liner for softening young hearts, until they lose all\r\nsemblance of shape, and for melting them into each other so that out of\r\ntwain there comes but one. I think Polly was pleased to watch this\r\nmelting process, as it began to show itself in our young people, from\r\nthe safe retreat of her steamer chair and behind the covers of her book.\r\nI couldn't find that she read two chapters from any book during the\r\nwhole voyage, or that she was miserable or discontented. She just\r\nwatched with a comfortable \"I told you so\" expression of countenance;\r\nand she never mentioned home lot or garden or roses, from dock to dock.\r\n\r\nIt is as natural for a woman to make matches as for a robin to build\r\nnests, and I suppose I had as much right to find fault with the one as\r\nwith the other. I did not find fault with her, but neither could I\r\nunderstand her; so I fretted and fumed and smoked, and walked the deck\r\nand bet on everything in sight and out of sight, until the soothing\r\ninfluence of the sea took hold of me, and then I drifted like the rest\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nNo, I will not say \"like the rest of them,\" for I could not forgive this\r\nwaste of space given over to water. In other crossings I had not noted\r\nthe conspicuous waste with any feeling of loss or regret; but other\r\ncrossings had been made before I knew the value of land. I could not get\r\naway from the thought that it would add much to the wealth of the world\r\nif the mountains were removed and cast into the sea. Not only that, but\r\nit would curb to some extent the ragings of this same turbulent sea,\r\nwhich was rolling and tossing us about for no really good reason that I\r\ncould discover. The Atlantic had lost much of its romance and mystery\r\nfor me, and I wondered if I had ever felt the enthusiasm which I heard\r\nexpressed on all sides.\r\n\r\n\"There she spouts!\" came from a dozen voices, and the whole passenger\r\nlist crowded the port rail, just to see a cow whale throwing up streams\r\nof water, not immensely larger than the streams of milk which my cow\r\nHolsteins throw down. The crowd seemed to take great pleasure in this\r\nsight, but to me it was profitless.\r\n\r\nI have known the day when I could watch the graceful leaps and dives of\r\na school of porpoises, as it kept with easy fin, alongside of our ocean\r\ngreyhound, with pleasure unalloyed by any feeling of non-utility. But\r\nnow these \"hogs of the sea\" reminded me of my Chester Whites, and the\r\ncomparison was so much in favor of the hogs of the land, that I turned\r\nfrom these spectacular, useless things, to meditate upon the price of\r\npork. Even Mother Carey's chickens gave me no pleasure, for they\r\nreminded me of a far better brood at home, and I cheerfully thanked the\r\nnoble Wyandottes who were working every third day so that I could have a\r\ntrip to Europe. To be sure, I had European trips before I had\r\nWyandottes; to have them both the same year was the marvel.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached Queenstown, Jarvis had gained some ground by twice\r\npicking me out of the scuppers; but as I resented his steadiness of foot\r\nand strength of hand, it was not worth mentioning. I could see, however,\r\nthat these feats were great in Jane's eyes. The double rescue of a\r\nbeloved parent, from, not exactly a watery grave, but a damp scupper,\r\nwould never be forgotten. The giant let her adore his manly strength and\r\nbeauty, and I could only secretly hope that some wave--tidal if\r\nnecessary--would take him off his feet and send him into the scuppers.\r\nBut he had played football too long to be upset by a watery wave, and I\r\nwas balked of my revenge.\r\n\r\nJack and Jessie were rather a pleasure to me than otherwise. They\r\nsettled right down to the heart-softening business in such\r\nmatter-of-fact fashion that their hearts must have lost contour before\r\nthe voyage was half over. Polly dismissed them from her mind with a sigh\r\nof satisfaction, and I then hoped that she would find some time to\r\ndevote to me, but I was disappointed. She assured me that those two were\r\nsafely locked in the fold, but that she could not \"set her mind at rest\"\r\nuntil the other two were safe. After that she promised to take me in\r\nhand; whether for reward or for punishment left me guessing.\r\n\r\nThe six and a half days finally came to an end, and we debarked for\r\nQueenstown. The journey across Ireland was made as quickly as slow\r\ntrains and a circuitous route would permit, and we reached Sligo on the\r\nsecond day. Sir Thomas's agent met us, and we drove at once to the\r\n\"little castle out from Sligo.\" It proved to be a very old little\r\ncastle, four miles out, overlooking the bay. It was low and flat, with\r\nthick walls of heavy stone pierced by a few small windows, and a broad\r\ndoor made of black Irish oak heavily studded with iron. From one corner\r\nrose a square tower, thirty feet or more in height, covered with wild\r\nvines that twined in and out through the narrow, unglazed windows.\r\n\r\nWithin was a broad, low hall, from which opened four rooms of nearly\r\nequal size. There was little evidence that the castle had been inhabited\r\nduring recent years, though there was an ancient woman care-taker who\r\nopened the great door for us, and then took up the Irish peasant's wail\r\nfor the last of the O'Haras. She never ceased her crooning except when\r\nshe spoke to us, which was seldom; but she placed us at table in the\r\nstate dining room, and served us with stewed kid, potatoes, and goat's\r\nmilk. The walls of the dining room were covered with ancient pictures of\r\nthe O'Haras, but none so recent as a hundred years. We could well\r\nbelieve Sir Tom's words, \"the sod has known us for a thousand years,\"\r\nwhen we looked upon the score of pictures, each of which stood for at\r\nleast one generation.\r\n\r\nThe agent told us that our friend had never lived at the castle, but\r\nthat he had visited the place as a child, and again just before leaving\r\nfor America. A wall-enclosed lot about two hundred feet square was \"the\r\nkindest sod in all the world to an O'Hara,\" and here we placed our dear\r\nfriend at rest with the \"lucky ones\" of his race. No one of the race\r\never deserved more \"luck\" than did our Sir Tom. The young clergyman who\r\nread the service assured us that he had found it; and our minds gave the\r\nsame evidence, and our hearts said Amen, as we turned from his peaceful\r\nresting-place by the green waters of Sligo Bay.\r\n\r\nTwo days later we were comfortably lodged at The Hague, from which we\r\nintended to \"do\" the little kingdom of Holland by rail, by canal, or on\r\nfoot, as we should elect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nTHE BELGIAN FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Holland with regret, we crossed the Schelde into Belgium, the\r\ncockpit of Europe. It is here that one sees what intensive farming is\r\nlike. No fences to occupy space, no animals roaming at large, nothing\r\nbut small strips of land tilled to the utmost, chiefly by hand. Little\r\nmachinery is used, and much of the work is done after primitive\r\nfashions; but the land is productive, and it is worked to the top of its\r\nbent.\r\n\r\nThe peasant-farmer soils his cows, his sheep, his swine, in a way that\r\nis economical of space and food, if not of labor, and manages to make a\r\nliving and to pay rent for his twenty-acre strip of land. His methods do\r\nnot appeal to the American farmer, who wastes more grain and forage each\r\nyear than would keep the Netherlander, his family, and his stock; but\r\nthere is a lesson to be learned from this subdivision and careful\r\ncultivation of land. Belgian methods prove that Mother Earth can care\r\nfor a great many children if she be properly husbanded, and that the\r\nsooner we recognize her capacity the better for us.\r\n\r\nAbandoned farms are not known in Belgium and France, though the soil\r\nhas been cultivated for a thousand years, and was originally no better\r\nthan our New England farms, and not nearly so good as hundreds of those\r\nwhich are practically given over to \"old fields\" in Virginia.\r\n\r\nIt is neglect that impoverishes land, not use. Intelligent use makes\r\nland better year by year. The only way to wear out land is to starve and\r\nto rob it at the same time. Food for man and beast may be taken from the\r\nsoil for thousands of years without depleting it. All it asks in return\r\nis the refuse, carefully saved, properly applied, and thoroughly worked\r\nin to make it available. If, in addition to this, a cover crop of some\r\nleguminous plant be occasionally turned under, the soil may actually\r\nincrease in fertility, though it be heavily cropped each year.\r\n\r\nIt would pay the young American farmer to study Belgian methods, crude\r\nthough they are, for the insight he could gain into the possibilities of\r\ncontinuous production. The greatest number of people to the square mile\r\nin the inhabited globe live in this little, ill-conditioned kingdom, and\r\nmost of them get their living from the soil. It has been the\r\nbattle-field of Europe: a thousand armies have harrowed it; human blood\r\nhas drenched it from Liège to Ostend; it has been depopulated again and\r\nagain. But it springs into new life after each catastrophe, simply\r\nbecause the soil is prolific of farmers, and they cannot be kept down.\r\nLike the poppies on the field of Waterloo, which renew the blood-red\r\nstrife each year, the Belgian peasant-farmer springs new-born from the\r\nsoil, which is the only mother he knows.\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks in Holland, two in Belgium, and two in London, we were\r\nready to turn our faces toward home.\r\n\r\nWe took the train to Southampton, and a small side-wheel steamer carried\r\nus outside Southampton waters, where we tossed about for thirty minutes\r\nbefore the _Normania_ came to anchor. The wind was blowing half a gale\r\nfrom the north, and we were glad to get under the lee of the great\r\nvessel to board her.\r\n\r\nThe transfer was quickly made, and we were off for New York. The wind\r\ngained strength as the day grew old, but while we were in the Solent the\r\nbluff coast of Devon and Cornwall broke its force sufficiently to permit\r\nus to be comfortable on the port side of the ship.\r\n\r\nAs night came on, great clouds rolled up from the northwest and the wind\r\nincreased. Darkness, as of Egypt, fell upon us before we passed the\r\nLizard, and the only things that showed above the raging waters were the\r\nbeacon lights, and these looked dim and far away. Occasionally a flash\r\nof lightning threw the waters into relief, and then made the darkness\r\nmore impenetrable. As we steamed beyond the Lizard and the protecting\r\nCornish coast, the full force of the gale, from out the Irish Sea,\r\nstruck us. We were going nearly with it, and the good ship pitched and\r\nreared like an angry horse, but did not roll much. Pitching is harder to\r\nbear than rolling, and the decks were quickly vacated.\r\n\r\nI turned into my stateroom soon after ten o'clock, and then happened a\r\nthing which will hold a place in my memory so long as I have one. I did\r\nnot feel sleepy, but I was nervous, restless, and half sick. I lay on my\r\nlounge for perhaps half an hour, and then felt impelled to go on deck. I\r\nwrapped myself in a great waterproof ulster, pulled my storm cap over my\r\nears, and climbed the companionway. Two or three electric bulbs in\r\nsheltered places on deck only served to make the darkness more intense.\r\nI crawled forward of the ladies' cabin, and, supporting myself against\r\nthe donkey-engine, peered at the light above the crow's-nest and tried\r\nto think that I could see the man on watch in the nest. I did see him\r\nfor an instant, when the next flash of lightning came, and also two\r\nofficers on the bridge; and I knew that Captain Bahrens was in the chart\r\nhouse. When the next flash came, I saw the other lookout man making his\r\nshort turns on the narrow space of bow deck, and was tempted to join\r\nhim; why, I do not know. I crept past the donkey-engine, holding fast to\r\nit as I went, until I reached the iron gate that closes the narrow\r\npassage to the bow deck. With two silver dollars in my teeth I staggered\r\nacross this rail-guarded plank, and when the next flash came I was\r\nsitting at the feet of the lookout man with the two silver dollars in my\r\noutstretched hand. He took the money, and let me crawl forward between\r\nthe anchors and the high bulwark of the bows.\r\n\r\nThe sensations which this position gave me were strange beyond\r\ndescription. Darkness was thick around me; at one moment I was carried\r\nupward until I felt that I should be lost in the black sky, and the next\r\nmoment the downward motion was so terrible that the blacker water at the\r\nbottom of the sea seemed near. I cannot say that I enjoyed it, but I\r\ncould not give it up.\r\n\r\nWhen the great bow rose, I stood up, and, looking over the bulwark,\r\ntried to see either sky or water, but tried in vain, save when the\r\nlightning revealed them both. When the bow fell, I crouched under the\r\nbulwark and let the sea comb over me. How long I remained at this weird\r\npost, I do not know; but I was driven from it in such terror as I hope\r\nnever to feel again.\r\n\r\nAn unusually large wave carried me nearer the sky than I liked to be,\r\nand just as the sharp bow of the great iron ship was balancing on its\r\ncrest for the desperate plunge, a glare of lightning made sky and sea\r\nlike a sheet of flame and curdled the blood in my veins. In the trough\r\nof the sea, under the very foot of the immense steamship, lay a delicate\r\npleasure-boat, with its mast broken flush with its deck, and its\r\nhelpless body the sport of the cruel waves.\r\n\r\nThe light did not last longer than it would take me to count five, but\r\nin that time I saw four figures that will always haunt me. Two sailors\r\nin yachting costume were struggling hopelessly with the tiller, and the\r\nwild terror of their faces as they saw the huge destruction that hung\r\nover them is simply unforgettable.\r\n\r\nThe other two were different. A strong, blond man, young, handsome, and\r\nbrave I know, stood bareheaded in front of the cockpit. With a sudden,\r\nvehement motion he drew the head of a girl to his breast and held it\r\nthere as if to shut out the horrible world. There was no fear in his\r\nface,--just pain and distress that he was unable to do more. I am\r\nthankful that I did not see the face of the girl. Her brown hair has\r\nfloated in my dreams until I have cried out for help; what would her\r\nface have done?\r\n\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye it was over. I heard a sound as when one\r\nbreaks an egg on the edge of a cup,--no more. I screamed with horror,\r\nran across the guarded plank, climbed the gate, and fell headlong and\r\nscreaming over the donkey-engine. Picking up my battered self, I\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"Bahrens! Bahrens! for God's sake, help! Man overboard! Stop the ship!\"\r\n\r\nI reached the ladder to the bridge just as the captain came out of the\r\nchart house.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, stop the ship! You've run down a boat with four\r\npeople! Stop her, can't you!\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be done, man. If we've run down a boat, it's all over with it\r\nand all in it. I can't risk a thousand lives without hope of saving one.\r\nThis is a gale, Doctor, and we have our hands full.\"\r\n\r\nI turned from him in horror and despair. I stumbled to my stateroom,\r\ndropped my wet clothing in the middle of the floor, and knew no more\r\nuntil the trumpet called for breakfast. The rush of green waters was\r\npounding at my porthole; the experience of the night came back to me\r\nwith horror; the reek of my wet clothes sickened my heart, and I rang\r\nfor the steward.\r\n\r\n\"Take these things away, Gustav, and don't bring them back until they\r\nare dry and pressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What things does the Herr Doctor speak for?\"\r\n\r\n\"The wet things there on the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, but I have seen no things wet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You Dutch chump!\" said I, half rising, \"what do you mean by\r\nsaying--Well, I'll be damned!\" There were my clothes, dry and folded, on\r\nthe couch, and my ulster and cap on their hook, without evidence of\r\nmoisture or use.\r\n\r\n\"Gustav, remind me to give you three rix-dollars at breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Danke, Herr Doctor.\"\r\n\r\nOf such stuff are dreams made. But I will know those terror-stricken\r\nsailors if I do not see them for a hundred years; and I am glad the\r\ndark-haired girl did not realize the horror, but simply knew that the\r\nman loved her; and I often think of the man who did the nice thing when\r\nno one was looking, and whose face was not terrorized by the crack of\r\ndoom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nHOME-COMING\r\n\r\n\r\nEven Polly was satisfied with our young people before we entered New\r\nYork Bay. If anything in their \"left pulmonaries\" had remained\r\nunsoftened during the voyage out and the comradery of the Netherlands,\r\nit was melted into non-resistance by the homeward trip. I could not long\r\nhold out against the evidence of happiness that surrounded me, and I\r\ngave a half-grudging consent that Jarvis and Jane might play together\r\nfor the next three or four years, if they would not ask to play \"for\r\nkeeps\" until those years had passed. They readily gave the promise, but\r\nevery one knows how such promises are kept. The children wore me out in\r\ntime, as all children do in all kinds of ways, and got their own ways in\r\nless than half the contract period. I cannot put my finger on any\r\npunishment that has befallen them for this lack of filial consideration,\r\nand I am fifteen-sixteenths reconciled.\r\n\r\nI was downright glad that Jack \"made good\" with Jessie Gordon. She was\r\nthe sort of girl to get out the best that was in him, and I was glad to\r\nhave her begin early. Try as I might, I could not feel unhappy that\r\nbeautiful September morning as we steamed up the finest waterway to the\r\nfinest city in the world. Deny it who will, I claim that our Empire City\r\nand its environments make the most impressive human show. There is more\r\nlife, vigor, utility, gorgeousness about it than can be found anywhere\r\nelse; and it has the snap and elasticity of youth, which are so\r\nattractive. No man who claims the privilege of American citizenship can\r\nsail up New York Bay without feeling pride in his country and\r\nsatisfaction in his birthright. One doesn't disparage other cities and\r\nother countries when he claims that his own is the best.\r\n\r\nWe were not specially badly treated at the custom-house,--no worse,\r\nindeed, than smugglers, thieves, or pirates would have been; and we\r\nescaped, after some hours of confinement, without loss of life or\r\nbaggage, but with considerable loss of dignity. How can a\r\nself-respecting, middle-aged man (to be polite to myself) stand for\r\nhours in a crowded shed, or lean against a dirty post, or sit on the\r\nsharp edge of his open trunk, waiting for a Superior Being with a gilt\r\nband around his hat, without losing some modicum of dignity? And how,\r\nwhen this Superior Being calls his number and kicks his trunk, is he to\r\nknow that he is a free-born American citizen and a lineal descendant of\r\nRoger Williams? The evidence is entirely from within. How is he to\r\nsupport a countenance and mien of dignity while the secrets of his\r\nchest are laid bare and the contents of his trunk dumped on the dirty\r\nfloor? And how must his eyes droop and his face take on a hang-dog look\r\nwhen his second-best coat is searched for diamonds, and his favorite\r\n(though worn) pajamas punched for pearls.\r\n\r\nThere are concessions to be made for one's great and glorious country,\r\nand the custom-house is one of them. Perhaps we will do better sometime,\r\nand perhaps, though this is unlikely, the customs inspectors of the\r\nfuture will disguise themselves as gentlemen. We finally passed the\r\ninquisition, and, with stuffed trunks and ruffled spirits, took cabs for\r\nthe station, and were presently within the protecting walls at Four\r\nOaks, there to forget lost dignities in the cultivation of land and new\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\nAN HUNDRED FOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nKate declared that she had had the time of her life during her nine\r\nweeks' stay at Four Oaks. \"People here every day, and the house full\r\nover Sunday. We've kept the place humming,\" said she, \"and you may be\r\nthankful if you find anything here but a mortgage. When Tom and I get\r\nrich, we are going to be farm people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't wait for that, daughter. Start your country home early and let it\r\ngrow up with the children. It doesn't take much money to buy the land\r\nand to get fruit trees started. If Tom will give it his care for three\r\nhours a week, he will make it at least pay interest and taxes, and it\r\nwill grow in value every year until you are ready to live on it. Think\r\nhow our orchards would look now if we had started them ten years ago!\r\nThey would be fit to support an average family.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Dad, don't mount your hobby as soon as ever you get home. But we\r\n_have_ had a good time out here. Do you really think farming is all beer\r\nand skittles?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been smooth sailing for me thus far, and I believe it is simply\r\na business with the usual ups and downs; but I mean to make the ups the\r\nfeature in this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you really glad to get back to it? Didn't you want to stay longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a fine trip, and all that, but I give you this for true; I don't\r\nthink it would make me feel badly if I were condemned to stay within\r\nforty miles of this place for the rest of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't go so far as that with you, Dad, but perhaps I may when I'm\r\nolder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, age makes a difference. At forty a man is a fool or a farmer, or\r\nboth; at fifty the pull of the land is mighty; at sixty it has full\r\npossession of him; at seventy it draws him down with other forces than\r\nthat which Newton discovered, and at eighty it opens for him and kindly\r\ntucks the sod around him. Mother Earth is no stepmother, but warm and\r\ngenerous to all, and I think a fellow is lucky who comes to her for long\r\nyears of bounty before he is compelled to seek her final hospitality.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Dad, we can't all be farmers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, and there's the pity of it; but almost every man can\r\nhave a plot of ground on which each year he can grow some new thing, if\r\nonly a radish or a leaf of lettuce, to add to the real wealth of the\r\nworld. I tell you, young lady, that all wealth springs out of the\r\nground. You think that riches are made in Wall Street, but they are\r\nnot; they are only handled and manipulated. Stop the work of the farmer\r\nfrom April to October of any year, and Wall Street would be a howling\r\nwilderness. The Street makes it easier to exchange a dozen eggs for\r\nthree spools of silk, or a pound of butter for a hat pin, but that's\r\nall; it never created half the intrinsic value of twelve eggs or sixteen\r\nounces of butter. It's only the farmer who is a wealth producer, and\r\nit's high time that he should be recognized as such. He's the husbandman\r\nof all life; without him the world would be depopulated in three years.\r\nYou don't half appreciate the profession which your Dad has taken up in\r\nhis old age.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds all right, but I don't think the farmer would recognize\r\nhimself from that description. He doesn't live up to his possibilities,\r\ndoes he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty few people do. A farmer may be what he chooses to be. He's under\r\nno greater limitations than a business or a professional man. If he be\r\ncontent to use his muscle blindly, he will probably fall under his own\r\nharrow. So, too, would the merchant or the lawyer who failed to use his\r\nintelligence in his business. The farmer who cultivates his mind as well\r\nas his land, uses his pencil as often as his plough, and mixes brains\r\nwith brawn, will not fall under his own harrow or any other man's. He\r\nwill never be the drudge of soil or of season, for to a large extent he\r\ncan control the soil and discount the season. No other following gives\r\nsuch opportunity for independence and self-balance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost thou persuadest me to become a farmer,\" said Kate, as we left\r\nthe porch, where I had been admiring my land while I lectured on the\r\nadvantages of husbandry.\r\n\r\nPolly came out of the rose garden, where she had been examining her\r\nflowers and setting her watch, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"Kate, you and the grand-girls must stay this month out, anyway. It\r\nseems an age since we saw you last.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, if Dad will agree not to fire farm fancies and figures at me\r\nevery time he catches me in an easy-chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll promise, but you don't know what you're missing.\"\r\n\r\nFour Oaks looked great, and I was tempted to tramp over every acre of\r\nit, saying to each, \"You are mine\"; but first I had a little talk with\r\nThompson.\r\n\r\n\"Everything has been greased for us this summer,\" said Thompson. \"We got\r\na bumper crop of hay, and the oats and corn are fine! I allow you've got\r\nfifty-five bushels of oats to the acre in those shocks, and the corn\r\nlooks like it stood for more than seventy. We sold nine more calves the\r\nend of June, for $104. Mr. Tom must have a lot of money for you, for in\r\nAugust we sold the finest bunch of shoates you ever saw,--312 of them.\r\nThey were not extra heavy, but they were fine as silk. Mr. Tom said they\r\nnetted $4.15 per hundred, and they averaged a little over 260 pounds. I\r\nwent down with them, and the buyers tumbled over each other to get them.\r\nI was mighty proud of the bunch, and brought back a check for $3407.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, Thompson! That's the best sale yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of the heifers will be coming in the last of this month or the\r\nfirst of next. Don't you want to get rid of those five scrub cows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better wait six weeks, and then you may sell them. Do you know where\r\nyou can place them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jackson was looking at them a few days ago, and said he would give $35\r\napiece for them; but they are worth more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for us, Thompson, and not for him, either, if he saw things just\r\nright. They're good for scrubs; but they don't pay well enough for us,\r\nand if he wants them he can have them at that price about the middle of\r\nOctober.\"\r\n\r\nThe credit account for the second quarter of 1898 stood:--\r\n\r\n23 calves . . . . .  $270.00\r\nEggs    . . . . . .   637.00\r\nButter  . . . . . .  1314.00\r\n   Total. . . . . .  $2221.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\nCOMFORT ME WITH APPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember added a new item to our list of articles sold; small, indeed,\r\nbut the beginning of the fourth and last product of our factory\r\nfarm,--fruit from our newly planted orchards. The three hundred plum\r\ntrees in the chicken runs gave a moderate supply for the colony, and the\r\ndwarf-pear trees yielded a small crop; but these were hardly included in\r\nour scheme. I expected to be able, by and by, to sell $200 or $300 worth\r\nof plums; but the chief income from fruit would come from the fifty\r\nacres of young apple orchards.\r\n\r\nI hope to live to see the time when these young orchards will bring me\r\nat least $5 a year for each tree; and if I round out my expectancy (as\r\nthe life-insurance people figure it), I may see them do much better. In\r\nthe interim the day of small things must not be despised. In our climate\r\nthe Yellow Transparent and the Duchess do not ripen until early\r\nSeptember, and I was therefore at home in time to gather and market the\r\nlittle crop from my six hundred trees. The apples were carefully picked,\r\nfor they do not bear handling well, and the perfect ones were placed in\r\nhalf-bushel boxes and sent to my city grocer. Not one defective apple\r\nwas packed, for I was determined that the Four Oaks stencil should be as\r\nfavorably known for fruit as for other products.\r\n\r\nThe grocer allowed me fifty cents a box. \"The market is glutted with\r\napples, but not your kind,\" said he. \"Can you send more?\" I could not\r\nsend more, for my young trees had done their best in producing\r\nninety-six boxes of perfect fruit. Boxes and transportation came to ten\r\ncents for each box, and I received $38 for my first shipment of fruit.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember any small sum of money that ever pleased me\r\nmore,--except the $28 which I earned by seven months of labor in my\r\nfourteenth year; for it was \"first fruits\" of the last of our\r\ninterlacing industries.\r\n\r\nThirty-eight dollars divided among my trees would give one cent to each;\r\nbut four years later these orchards gave net returns of ninety cents for\r\neach tree, and in four years from now they will bring more than twice\r\nthat amount. At twelve years of age they will bring an annual income of\r\n$3 each, and this income will steadily increase for ten or fifteen\r\nyears. At the time of writing, February, 1903, they are good for $1 a\r\nyear, which is five per cent of $20.\r\n\r\nWould I take $20 apiece for these trees? Not much, though that would\r\nmean $70,000. I do not know where I could place $70,000 so that it\r\nwould pay five per cent this year, six per cent next year, and twenty\r\nper cent eight or ten years from now. Of course, $70,000 would be an\r\nexorbitant price to pay for an orchard like mine; but it must be\r\nremembered that I am old and cannot wait for trees to grow.\r\n\r\nIf a man will buy land at $50 or $60 an acre, plant it to apple trees\r\n(not less than sixty-five to the acre), and bring these trees to an age\r\nwhen they will produce fruit to the value of $1.50 each, they will not\r\nhave cost more than $1.50 per tree for the land, the trees, and the\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nI am too old to begin over again, and I wish to see a handsome income\r\nfrom my experiment before my eyes are dim; but why on earth young men do\r\nnot take to this kind of investment is more than I can see. It is as\r\nsafe as government bonds, and infinitely safer than most mercantile\r\nventures. It is a dignified employment, free from the ordinary risks of\r\nbusiness; and it is not likely to be overdone. All one needs is energy,\r\na little money, and a good bit of well-directed intelligence. This\r\ncombination is common enough to double our rural population, relieve the\r\ncongestion in trades and underpaid employments, and add immensely to the\r\nwealth of the country. If we can only get the people headed for the\r\nland, it will do much toward solving the vexing labor problems, and will\r\ndraw the teeth of the communists and the anarchists; for no one is so\r\nwilling to divide as he who cannot lose by division. To the man who has\r\na plot of ground which he calls his own, division doesn't appeal with\r\nany but negative force. Neither should it, until all available lands are\r\noccupied. Then he must move up and make room for another man by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe sales for the quarter ending September 30 were as follows:--\r\n\r\n96 half-bushel boxes of apples          $38.00\r\n9 calves                                104.00\r\nEggs                                    543.00\r\nButter                                 1293.00\r\nHogs                                   3407.00\r\n                                      --------\r\n        Total                         $5385.00\r\n\r\nThis was the best total for any three months up to date, and it made me\r\nfeel that I was getting pretty nearly out of the woods, so far as\r\nincreasing my investment went.\r\n\r\nIncluding my new hog-house and ten thousand bushels of purchased grain,\r\nthe investment, thought I, must represent quite a little more than\r\n$100,000, and I hoped not to go much beyond that sum, for Polly looked\r\nserious when I talked of six figures, though she was reconciled to any\r\namount which could be stated in five.\r\n\r\nMy buildings were all finished, and were good for many years; and if\r\nthey burned, the insurance would practically replace them. My granary\r\nwas full enough of oats and corn to provide for deficits of years to\r\ncome; and my flocks and herds were now at their maximum, since Sam had\r\nturned more than eight hundred pullets into the laying pens. I began to\r\nfeel that the factory would soon begin to run full time and to make\r\nmaterial returns for its equipment. It would, of course, be several\r\nyears before the fruit would make much showing, but I am a patient man,\r\nand could wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE THIRD YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Polly,\" said I, on the evening of December 31, \"let's settle the\r\naccounts for the year, and see how much we must credit to 'experience'\r\nto make the figures balance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to credit anything to health, and good times\r\ngenerally? If not, you don't play fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll keep those things in reserve, to spring on the enemy at a\r\ncritical moment; perhaps they won't be needed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy you will have to bring all your reserves into action this time,\r\nMr. Headman, for you promised to make a good showing at the end of the\r\nthird year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so I will; at least, according to my own estimate; but others may\r\nnot see it as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let others see it at all, then. The experiment is yours, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for us; but it's more than a personal matter. I want to prove that\r\na factory farm is sound in theory and safe in practice, and that it will\r\nfit the needs of a whole lot of farmers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think that 'a whole lot of farmers,' or of any other kind of\r\npeople, will put $100,000 into a farm on any terms. Don't you think\r\nyou've been a little extravagant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only on the home forty, Polly. I will expound this matter to you some\r\ntime until you fall asleep, but not to-day. We have other business on\r\nhand. I want to give you this warning to begin with: you are not to jump\r\nto a conclusion or on to my figures until you have fairly considered two\r\nitems which enter into this year's expense account. I've built an extra\r\nhog-house and have bought ten thousand bushels of grain, at a total\r\nexpense of about $6000. Neither of these items was really needed this\r\nyear; but as they are our insurance against disease and famine, I\r\nsecured them early and at low prices. They won't appear in the expense\r\naccount again,--at least, not for many years,--and they give me a sense\r\nof security that is mighty comforting.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if Anderson sets fire to your piggery, or lightning strikes\r\nyour granary,--how about the expense account then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose fire insurance policies are for? To paper the wall?\r\nNo, madam, they are to pay for new buildings if the old ones burn up. I\r\ncharge the farm over $200 a year for this security, and it's a binding\r\ncontract.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll try and forget the $6000 if you'll get to the figures at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. First, let me go over the statement for the last quarter of\r\nthe year. The sales were: apples, from 150 old trees at $3 per tree,\r\n$450; 10 calves, $115; 360 hens and 500 cockerels, $430; 5 cows (the\r\ncommon ones, to Jackson) at $35 each, $175; eggs, $827; butter, $1311;\r\nand 281 hogs, rushed to market in December when only about eight months\r\nold and sold for $3.70 per hundred to help swell this account, $2649;\r\nmaking a total for the fourth quarter of $5957.\r\n\r\n\"The items of expense for the year were:--\r\n\r\n\"Interest on investment   $5,132.00\r\n New hog-house             4,220.00\r\n 10,000 bu. of grain       2,450.00\r\n Food for colony           5,322.00\r\n Food for stock            1,640.00\r\n Seeds and fertilizers     2,155.00\r\n Insurance and taxes         730.00\r\n Shoeing and repairs         349.00\r\n Replenishments              450.00\r\n\r\n\"Total                   $22,760.00\r\n\r\n\"The credit account reads: first quarter, $2030; second quarter, $2221;\r\nthird quarter, $5387; fourth quarter, $5957; total, $15,595.\r\n\r\n\"If we take out the $6670 for the extra piggery and the grain, the\r\nexpense account and the income will almost balance, even leaving out the\r\n$4000 which we agreed to pay for food and shelter. I think that's a fair\r\nshowing for the three years, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly it is; but what a lot of money you pay for wages. It's the\r\nlargest item.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it always will be. I don't claim that a factory farm can be\r\nrun like a grazing or a grain farm. One of its objects is to furnish\r\nwell-paid employment to a lot of people. We've had nine men and two lads\r\nall the year, and three extra men for seven months, three women on the\r\nfarm and five in the house,--twenty-two people to whom we've paid wages\r\nthis year. Doesn't that count for anything? How many did we keep in the\r\ncity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four,--three women and a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we give employment to eighteen more people at equally good wages\r\nand in quite as wholesome surroundings. Do you realize, Polly, that the\r\nmaids in the house get $1300 out of the $5300,--one quarter of the\r\nwhole? Possibly there is a suspicion of extravagance on the home forty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it! You know that you proved to me that it cost us $5200 a\r\nyear for board and shelter in the city, and you only credit the farm\r\nwith $4000. That other $1200 would more than pay the extra wages. I\r\nreally don't think it costs as much to live here as it did on\r\nB----Street, and any one can see the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right. If we call our plant an even $100,000, which at five per\r\ncent would mean $5000 a year,--where can you get house, lawns, woods,\r\ngardens, horses, dogs, servants, liberty, birds, and sun-dials on a wide\r\nand liberal scale for $5000 a year, except on a farm like this? You\r\ncan't buy furs, diamonds, and yachts with such money anyhow or\r\nanywhere, so personal expenditures must be left out of all our\r\ncalculations. No, the wage account will always be the large one, and I\r\nam glad it is so, for it is one finger of the helping hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't finished with the figures yet. You don't know what to add\r\nto our _permanent_ investment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quickly done. _Nineteen thousand five hundred and ninety-five\r\ndollars_ from twenty-two thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars leaves\r\nthree thousand one hundred and sixty-five dollars to charge to our\r\ninvestment. I resent the word 'permanent,' which you underscored just\r\nnow, for each year we're going to have a surplus to subtract from this\r\ninterest-bearing debt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precious little surplus you'll have for the next few years, with Jack\r\nand Jane getting married, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Polly, you can't charge weddings to the farm, any more than we can\r\nyachts and diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why. A wedding is a very important part of one's life, and\r\nI think the farm ought to be _made_ to pay for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with you; but we must add $3165 to the old farm debt, and\r\ntake up our increased burden with such courage as we may. In round\r\nfigures it is $106,000. Does that frighten you, Polly?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little, perhaps; but I guess we can manage it. _You_ would have been\r\nfrightened three years ago if some one had told you that you would put\r\n$106,000 into a farm of less than five hundred acres.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right. Spending money on a farm is like other forms of\r\nvice,--hated, then tolerated, then embraced. But seriously, a man would\r\nget a bargain if he secured this property to-day for what it has cost\r\nus. I wouldn't take a bonus of $50,000 and give it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll hardly find a purchaser at that price, and I'm glad you can't,\r\nfor I want to live here and nowhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\nLOOKING BACKWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the close of the third year ends the detailed history of the\r\nfactory farm. All I wish to do further is to give a brief synopsis of\r\nthe debit and credit accounts for each of the succeeding four years.\r\n\r\nFirst I will say a word about the people who helped me to start the\r\nfactory. Thompson and his wife are still with me, and they are well on\r\ntoward the wage limit. Johnson has the gardens and Lars the stables, and\r\nOtto is chief swineherd. French and his wife act as though they were\r\nfixtures on the place, as indeed I hope they are. They have saved a lot\r\nof money, and they are the sort who are inclined to let well enough\r\nalone. Judson is still at Four Oaks, doing as good service as ever; but\r\nI fancy that he is minded to strike out for himself before long. He has\r\nbeen fortunate in money matters since he gave up the horse and buggy; he\r\ninformed me six months ago that he was worth more than $5000.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't have had five thousand cents if I'd stuck to that darned\r\nold buggy,\" said he, \"and I guess I'll have to thank you for throwing\r\nme down that day.\"\r\n\r\nZeb has married Lena, and a little cottage is to be built for them this\r\nwinter, just east of the farm-house; and Lena's place is to be filled by\r\nher cousin, who has come from the old country.\r\n\r\nAnderson and Sam both left in 1898,--poor, faithful Anderson because his\r\nheart gave out, and Sam because his beacon called him.\r\n\r\nLars's boys, now sixteen and eighteen, have full charge of the poultry\r\nplant, and are quite up to Sam in his best days. Of course I have had\r\nall kinds of troubles with all sorts of men; but we have such a strong\r\nforce of \"reliables\" that the atmosphere is not suited to the idler or\r\nthe hobo, and we are, therefore, never seriously annoyed. Of one thing I\r\nam certain: no man stays long at our farm-house without apprehending the\r\nuses of napkin and bath-tub, and these are strong missionary forces.\r\n\r\nThrough careful tilth and the systematic return of all waste to the\r\nland, the acres at Four Oaks have grown more fertile each year. The soil\r\nwas good seven years ago, and we have added fifty per cent to its crop\r\ncapacity. The amount of waste to return to the land on a farm like this\r\nis enormous, and if it be handled with care, there will be no occasion\r\nto spend much money for commercial fertilizers. I now buy fertilizers\r\nonly for the mid-summer dressing on my timothy and alfalfa fields. The\r\napple trees are very heavily mulched, even beyond the spread of their\r\nbranches, with waste fresh from the vats, and once a year a light\r\ndressing of muriate of potash is applied. The trees have grown as fast\r\nas could be desired, and all of them are now in bearing. The apples from\r\nthese young trees sold for enough last year to net ninety cents for each\r\ntree, which is more than the trees have ever cost me.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 these orchards yielded $38; in 1899, $165; in 1900, $530; in\r\n1901, $1117. Seven years from the date of planting these trees, which\r\nwere then three years old, I had received in money $4720, or $1200 more\r\nthan I paid for the fifty acres of land on which they grew. If one would\r\nask for better returns, all he has to do is to wait; for there is a sort\r\nof geometrical progression inherent in the income from all\r\nwell-cared-for orchards, which continues in force for about fifteen\r\nyears. There is, however, no rule of progress unless the orchards are\r\nwell cared for, and I would not lead any one to the mistake of planting\r\nan orchard and then doing nothing but wait. Cultivate, feed, prune,\r\nspray, dig bores, fight mice, rabbits, aphides, and the thousand other\r\nenemies to trees and fruit, and do these things all the time and then\r\nkeep on doing them, and you will win out. Omit all or any of them, and\r\nthe chances are that you will fail of big returns.\r\n\r\nBut orcharding is not unique in this. Every form of business demands\r\nprompt, timely, and intelligent attention to make it yield its best. The\r\norchards have been my chief care for seven years; the spraying,\r\nmulching, and cultivation have been done by the men, but I think I have\r\nspent one whole year, during the past seven, among my trees. Do I charge\r\nmy orchards for this time? No; for I have gotten as much good from the\r\ntrees as they have from me, and honors are easy. A meditative man in his\r\nsixth lustrum can be very happy with pruning-hook and shears among his\r\nyoung trees. If he cannot, I am sincerely sorry for him.\r\n\r\nI have not increased my plant during the past four years. My stock\r\nconsume a little more than I can raise; but there are certain things\r\nwhich a farm will not produce, and there are other things which one had\r\nbest buy, thus letting others work their own specialties.\r\n\r\nIf I had more land, would I increase my stock? No, unless I had enough\r\nland to warrant another plant. My feeding-grounds are filled to their\r\ncapacity from a sanitary point of view, and it would be foolish to take\r\nrisks for moderate returns. If I had as much more land, I would\r\nestablish another factory; but this would double my business cares\r\nwithout adding one item to my happiness. As it is, the farm gives me\r\nenough to keep me keenly interested, and not enough to tire or annoy me.\r\nSo far as profits go, it is entirely satisfactory. It feeds and\r\nshelters my family and twenty others in the colony, and also the\r\nstranger within the gates, and it does this year after year without\r\nfriction, like a well-oiled machine.\r\n\r\nNot only this. Each year for the past four, it has given a substantial\r\nsurplus to be subtracted from the original investment. If I live to be\r\nsixty-eight years of age, the farm will be my creditor for a\r\nconsiderable sum. I have bought no corn or oats since January, 1898. The\r\nseventeen thousand bushels which I then had in my granary have slowly\r\ngrown less, though there has never been a day when we could not have\r\nmeasured up seven thousand or eight thousand bushels. I shall probably\r\nbuy again when the market price pleases me, for I have a horror of\r\nrunning short; but I shall not sell a bushel, though prices jump to the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nI have seen the time when my corn and oats would have brought four times\r\nas much as I paid for them, but they were not for sale. They are the raw\r\nmaterial, to be made up in my factory, and they are worth as much to me\r\nat twenty cents a bushel as at eighty cents. What would one think of the\r\nmanager of a silk-thread factory who sold his raw silk, just because it\r\nhad advanced in price? Silk thread would advance in proportion, and how\r\ndoes the manager know that he can replace his silk when needed, even at\r\nthe advanced price?\r\n\r\nWhen corn went to eighty cents a bushel, hogs sold for $8.25 a hundred,\r\nand my twenty-cent corn made pork just as fast as eighty-cent corn would\r\nhave done, and a great deal cheaper.\r\n\r\nOnce I sold some timothy hay, but it was to \"discount the season,\" just\r\nas I bought grain.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 1901, a tremendous rain and wind storm beat down about forty\r\nacres of oats beyond recovery. The next day my mowing machines, working\r\nagainst the grain, commenced cutting it for hay. Before it was half cut,\r\nI sold to a livery-stable keeper in Exeter fifty tons of bright timothy\r\nfor $600. The storm brought me no loss, for the horses did quite as well\r\non the oat hay as they ever had done on timothy, and $600 more than paid\r\nfor the loss of the grain.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three years of my experiment hogs were very\r\nlow,--lower, indeed, than at any other period for forty years. It was\r\nnot until 1899 that prices began to improve. During that year my sales\r\naveraged $4.50 a hundred. In 1900 the average was $5.25, in 1901 it was\r\n$6.10, and in 1902 it was just $7. It will be readily appreciated that\r\nthere is more profit in pork at seven cents a pound than at three and a\r\nhalf cents; but how much more is beyond me, for it cost no more to get\r\nmy swine to market last year than it did in 1896. I charge each hog $1\r\nfor bran and shorts; this is all the ready money I pay out for him. If\r\nhe weighs three hundred pounds (a few do), he is worth $10.50 at $3.50 a\r\nhundred, or $21 at $7 a hundred; and it is a great deal pleasanter to\r\nsay $1 from $21, leaves $20, than to say $1 from $10.50 leaves $9.50.\r\n\r\nOf course, $1 a head is but a small part of what the hog has cost when\r\nready for market, but it is all I charge him with directly, for his\r\nother expenses are carried on the farm accounts. The marked increase in\r\nincome during the past four years is wholly due to the advance in the\r\nprice of pork and the increased product of the orchards. The expense\r\naccount has not varied much.\r\n\r\nThe fruit crop is charged with extra labor, packages, and\r\ntransportation, before it is entered, and the account shows only net\r\nreturns. I have had to buy new machinery, but this has been rather\r\nevenly distributed, and doesn't show prominently in any year.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 I lost my forage barn. It was struck by lightning on June 13,\r\nand burned to the ground. Fortunately, there was no wind, and the rain\r\ncame in such torrents as to keep the other buildings safe. I had to\r\nscour the country over for hay to last a month, and the expense of this,\r\ntogether with some addition to the insurance money, cost the farm $1000\r\nbefore the new structure was completed. I give below the income and the\r\noutgo for the last four years:--\r\n\r\n          INCOME     EXPENSES   TO THE GOOD\r\n1899    $17,780.00  $15,420.00   $2,360.00\r\n1900     19,460.00   16,480.00    2,980.00\r\n1901     21,424.00   15,520.00    5,904.00\r\n1902     23,365.00   15,673.00    7,692.00\r\n                                -----------\r\nMaking a total to the good of   $18,936.00\r\n\r\nThese figures cover only the money received and expended. They take no\r\naccount of the $4000 per annum which we agreed to pay the farm for\r\nkeeping us, so long as we made it pay interest to us. Four times $4000\r\nare $16,000 which, added to $18,936, makes almost $35,000 to charge off\r\nfrom the $106,000 of original investment.\r\n\r\nPolly was wrong when she spoke of it as a _permanent_ investment. Four\r\nyears more of seven-dollar pork and thrifty apple growth will make this\r\nbalance of $71,000 look very small. The interest is growing rapidly\r\nless, and it will be but a short time before the whole amount will be\r\ntaken off the expense account. When this is done, the yearly balance\r\nwill be increased by the addition of $5000, and we may be able to make\r\nthe farm pay for weddings, as Polly suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\nLOOKING FORWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not so opinionated as to think that mine is the only method of\r\nfarming. On the contrary, I know that it is only one of several good\r\nmethods; but that it is a good one, I insist. For a well-to-do,\r\nmiddle-aged man who was obliged to give up his profession, it offered\r\nchange, recreation, employment, and profit. My ability to earn money by\r\nmy profession ceased in 1895, and I must needs live at ease on my\r\nincome, or adopt some congenial and remunerative employment, if such\r\ncould be found. The vision of a factory farm had flitted through my\r\nbrain so often that I was glad of the opportunity to test my theories by\r\nputting them into practice. Fortunately I had money, and to spare; for I\r\nhad but a vague idea of what money would be needed to carry my\r\nexperiment to the point of self-support. I set aside $60,000 as ample,\r\nbut I spent nearly twice that amount without blinking. It is quite\r\nlikely that I could have secured as good and as prompt returns with\r\ntwo-thirds of this expenditure. I plead guilty to thirty-three per cent\r\nlack of economy; the extenuating circumstances were, a wish to let the\r\nmembers of my family do much as they pleased and have good things and\r\ngood people around them, and a somewhat luxurious temperament of my own.\r\n\r\nPolly and I were too wise (not to say too old) to adopt farming as a\r\nmeans of grace through privations. We wanted the good there was in it,\r\nand nothing else; but as a secondary consideration I wished to prove\r\nthat it can be made to pay well, even though one-third of the money\r\nexpended goes for comforts and kickshaws.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to spend so much on a five-hundred-acre farm, and a\r\nfactory farm need not contain so many acres. Any number of acres from\r\nforty to five hundred, and any number of dollars from $5000 to $100,000,\r\nwill do, so long as one holds fast to the rules: good clean fences for\r\nsecurity against trespass by beasts, or weeds; high tilth, and heavy\r\ncropping; no waste or fallow land; conscientious return to the land of\r\nrefuse, and a cover crop turned under every second year; the best stock\r\nthat money can buy; feed for product, not simply to keep the animals\r\nalive; force product in every way not detrimental to the product itself;\r\nmaintain a strict quarantine around your animals, and then depend upon\r\npure food, water, air, sunlight, and good shelter to keep them healthy;\r\nsell as soon as the product is finished, even though the market doesn't\r\nplease you; sell only perfect product under your own brand; buy when the\r\nmarket pleases you and thus \"discount the seasons\"; remember that\r\ninterdependent industries are the essence of factory farming; employ the\r\nbest men you can find, and keep them interested in your affairs; have a\r\ndefinite object and make everything bend toward that object; plant apple\r\ntrees galore and make them your chief care, as in time they will prove\r\nyour chief dependence. These are some of the principles of factory\r\nfarming, and one doesn't have to be old, or rich, to put them into\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nI would exchange my age, money, and acres for youth and forty acres, and\r\nthink that I had the best of the bargain; and I would start the factory\r\nby planting ten acres of orchard, buying two sows, two cows, and two\r\nsetting hens. Youth, strength, and hustle are a great sight better than\r\nmoney, and the wise youth can have a finer farm than mine before he\r\npasses the half-century mark, even though he have but a bare forty to\r\nbegin with.\r\n\r\nI do not take it for granted that every man has even a bare forty; but\r\nmillions of men who have it not, can have it by a little persistent\r\nself-denial; and when an able-bodied man has forty acres of ground under\r\nhis feet, it is up to him whether he will be a comfortable, independent,\r\nself-respecting man or not.\r\n\r\nA great deal of farm land is distant from markets and otherwise limited\r\nin its range of production, but nearly every forty which lies east of\r\nthe hundredth meridian is competent to furnish a living for a family of\r\nworkers, if the workers be intelligent as well as industrious. Farm\r\nlands are each year being brought closer to markets by steam and\r\nelectric roads; telephone and telegraphic wires give immediate service;\r\nand the daily distribution of mails brings the producer into close touch\r\nwith the consumer. The day of isolation and seclusion has passed, and\r\nthe farmer is a personal factor in the market. He is learning the\r\nadvantages of coöperation, both in producing and in disposing of his\r\nwares; he has paid off his mortgage and has money in the bank; he is a\r\npower in politics, and by far the most dependable element in the state.\r\nLike the wrestler of old, who gained new strength whenever his foot\r\ntouched the ground, our country gains fresh vigor from every man who\r\ntakes to the soil.\r\n\r\nIn preaching a hejira to the country, I do not forget the interests of\r\nthe children. Let no one dread country life for the young until they\r\ncome to the full pith and stature of maturity; for their chances of\r\ndoing things worth doing in the world are four to one against those of\r\nchildren who are city-bred. Four-fifths of the men and women who do\r\ngreat things are country-bred. This is out of all proportion to the\r\nbirth-rate as between country and city, and one is at a loss to account\r\nfor the disproportion, unless it is to be credited to environment. Is it\r\ndue to pure air and sunshine, making redder blood and more vigorous\r\ndevelopment, to broader horizons and freedom from abnormal conventions?\r\nOr does a close relation to primary things give a newness to mind and\r\nbody which is granted only to those who apply in person?\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason, it certainly pays to be country-bred. The cities\r\ndraw to themselves the cream of these youngsters, which is only natural;\r\nbut the cities do not breed them, except as exotics.\r\n\r\nIf the unborn would heed my advice, I would say, By all means be born in\r\nthe country,--in Ohio if possible. But, if fortune does not prove as\r\nkind to you as I could wish, accept this other advice: Choose the,\r\ncountry for your foster-mother; go to her for consolation and\r\nrejuvenation, take her bounty gratefully, rest on her fair bosom, and be\r\ncontent with the fat of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RURAL SCIENCE SERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes books which state the underlying principles of agriculture in\r\nplain language.

The writer represents herself as a doctor's\r\ndaughter in a country town, who has married an Englishman, and after two\r\nyears abroad has come home to live. Both husband and wife prefer the\r\ncountry to the city, and they make of their modest estate a mundane\r\nparadise of which it is a privilege to have a glimpse. Surely it is no\r\nexaggeration to characterize this as one of the very best books of the\r\nholiday season, thus far.\"--_Providence Journal._\r\n\r\n\"It is written with charm, and is more than a mere treatise on what may\r\nbe raised in the small lot of the suburban resident.\r\n\r\n\"The author has not only learned to appreciate nature from intimate\r\nassociation, but has achieved unusual power of communicating these facts\r\nto others. There is something unusually attractive about the\r\nbook.\"--_The Philadelphia Inquirer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Woman's Hardy Garden\r\n\r\nBy HELENA RUTHERFORD ELY\r\n\r\nWith many Illustrations from Photographs taken in the Author's Garden by\r\nProfessor C.F.
