Write our nearest\r\noffice (see last page) and your letter will receive prompt, personal\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\nChief Uses of Dynamite on the Farm.\r\n\r\nAs farmers all over the country begin to understand the value of \"Red\r\nCross\" Dynamite in their work, they are constantly reporting new uses\r\nfor this powerful assistant.\r\n\r\nThe chief uses are mentioned below and are explained in detail further\r\non. Complete instructions are furnished in the \"Handbook of Explosives\r\nfor Farmers, Planters and Ranchers.\"\r\n\r\n    =Clearing Land of Stumps, Trees and Boulders,=\r\n    =Breaking up Hard-Pan, Shale, or Clay Subsoils,=\r\n    =Plowing,=\r\n    =Planting and Cultivating Orchards,=\r\n    =Digging Ditches, Post Holes, Wells and Reservoirs,=\r\n    =Road-Making and Grading,=\r\n    =Excavating Cellars and Foundation Trenches,=\r\n    =Regenerating Old, Worn-out Farms.=\r\n\r\n\r\nClearing Land of Stumps, Boulders and Trees.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to tell you the advantages of clearing land.\r\n\r\nThe stump covered site of a former piece of woods, is, as you know, new,\r\nrich soil that needs no fertilizer.\r\n\r\nYou also know that pulling stumps with a machine is the hardest kind of\r\nwork--liable to injure seriously your horses, and certain to require a\r\nlot of work to get rid of the stump after pulling.\r\n\r\nThen too, it leaves the field full of holes, that must be filled; and\r\nplowing the hard packed soil around old roots is no joke.\r\n\r\nIf instead of pulling the stumps, you burn them out, the intense heat\r\nrequired destroys the chief fertile elements of the soil all around the\r\nfire. After all your hard work you will leave a burned field instead of\r\nnew, fertile soil.\r\n\r\nYou can dynamite all those stumps for about one-third the cost of\r\npulling and chopping them up.\r\n\r\nThe blast splits up the stump into firewood, removes all the dirt,\r\nbreaks all the main roots, and loosens the soil for yards around.\r\n\r\nYou can blast fifty stumps in the time it would take to pull and chop up\r\none or two.\r\n\r\nOne man can do all the work, if necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter the stumps are all blasted out, you will have a new, rich field,\r\nand easy to cultivate, requiring no fertilizer to yield bumper crops.\r\n\r\nIf you want to remove a whole tree, \"Red Cross\" Dynamite will lift it\r\nbodily out of the ground, and it will usually fall with the wind. When\r\nthis is done, _there is no stump left to remove_.\r\n\r\nBoulders, which you are now obliged to plow around, can be broken up\r\ninto easily handled blocks by a single blast.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat it Costs to Blast Out Stumps.\r\n\r\nAt the latest \"Farming with Dynamite\" demonstration, held under the\r\nauspices of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, at Ivor, Va., on August\r\n11, 1910, one and one-half acres, containing forty-six stumps were\r\ncleared in one day, at an expense of $18.00, including labor, or an\r\naverage of 39 cents per stump.\r\n\r\nRecords kept by the Long Island Railroad, covering operations on their\r\nExperimental Farm, showed that, including the wages of the men who did\r\nthe work, the cost of blasting out stumps averaged about 16 cents per\r\nstump.\r\n\r\nRecords kept of the cost of this work in different sections of the\r\ncountry show as follows:\r\n\r\n  Locality and Kind of Stump.          Average       Average Cost\r\n                                      Diameter.       Per Stump.\r\n\r\n  =Southern=--\r\n    Pine Stumps                      29 inches          $0.30\r\n\r\n  =Pennsylvania=--\r\n    Apple, Ash and Chestnut          34-1/2 inches        .56\r\n\r\n  =Michigan=--\r\n    White Pine, Maple and Birch      32 inches            .47\r\n\r\n  =Minnesota=--\r\n    Birch, Ash, Spruce and Pine      20 inches            .16\r\n\r\n  =Illinois=--\r\n    Oak, Walnut and Gum              30 inches            .53\r\n\r\n  =Western=--\r\n    Fir, Pine and Cedar              50 inches           1.13\r\n    Redwood                           8 feet and over    2.00 and over\r\n\r\nRecords kept by Prof. A. J. McGuire, Superintendent Experimental Farm of\r\nthe University of Minnesota, show even lower costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreaking Up Hard-Pan, Shale or Clay Soils.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the most important use of \"Red Cross\" Dynamite.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, although difficult and expensive, to clear land of\r\nstumps and boulders in other ways, but it is not possible to break up\r\nhard-pan, or clay subsoils, without the use of \"Red Cross\" Dynamite.\r\n\r\nLand that has a waterproof subsoil is practically worthless, as it holds\r\nthe surface water in such quantities on level ground, that the roots of\r\ntrees and plants are rotted away; on hilly ground, it allows the surface\r\nwater to run off, thus preventing the storage of moisture, with the\r\nresult that vegetation dies quickly in hot weather. Such land can be\r\nrendered fertile at once by blasting with \"Red Cross\" Dynamite. The\r\nsubsoil is completely broken up and the dry, dead top soil converted\r\ninto a rich loam for less than the amount of the taxes for a year or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the Topeka, Kansas, \"Mail and Breeze\" proves\r\nthe wonderful results of this use of dynamite:--\r\n\r\n\"A few years ago M. T. Williams bought a quarter section of land near\r\nMedicine Lodge in Barber County, and, conceiving the same idea that\r\nEx-Governor Crawford and others have, used dynamite in dealing with a\r\nhard subsoil. The land was overgrown with sunflowers and cockleburs and\r\nwould have been considered dear at $10 per acre. It was underlaid with a\r\nhard subsoil that was almost impervious to water. Mr. Williams' idea was\r\nto loosen this subsoil with dynamite. He bored holes in the earth some 3\r\nfeet deep and about 40 feet apart, and in each hole placed a part of a\r\nstick of dynamite. The explosion of the dynamite loosened the hard\r\nsubsoil, and made a reservoir for the rains, which had formerly run off\r\nthe land nearly as fast as they fell. On this quarter there is now 100\r\nacres of, perhaps, as fine alfalfa as can be found in the state. Mr.\r\nWilliams has refused $15,000 for the quarter and gathers a net income\r\nfrom his alfalfa of from $30 to $35 per acre every year.\r\n\r\n\"Last season Mr. Williams proposed to the ladies of the Baptist church\r\nthat he would give them a load of hay, provided they would come out to\r\nthe place, shock the hay, load it on wagons and haul it to town. They\r\ntook him at his word and shocked and hauled to town two tons which sold\r\nfor $16. When the second crop was ready the ladies came again, and\r\n'touched' Mr. Williams for a little more than two tons which sold as\r\nwell as the first load.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPlowing With Dynamite.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily plowing merely turns over the same old soil year after year,\r\nand constant decrease in crops is only prevented by rotation or\r\nexpensive fertilizing.\r\n\r\nWith \"Red Cross\" Dynamite you can break up the ground all over the field\r\nto a depth of two or three feet, for less than the cost of adequate\r\nfertilizing, and with better results. Fertilizing only improves the top\r\nsoil. Dynamiting renders available all the moisture and elements of\r\ngrowth throughout the entire depth of the blast.\r\n\r\nIn an article by J. H. Caldwell, of Spartanburg, S. C., in the\r\nSeptember, 1910, Technical World Magazine, he states that before the\r\nground was broken up with dynamite, he planted his corn with stalks 18\r\ninches apart in rows 4 feet apart and raised 90 bushels to the acre.\r\nAfter the ground was blasted, it was able to nourish stalks 6 inches\r\napart in rows the same distance apart, and to produce over 250 bushels\r\nto the acre. This means an increase of about _160 bushels to the acre_,\r\nevery year, for an original expense of $40 an acre for labor and\r\nexplosives.\r\n\r\nF. G. Moughon, of Walton County, Georgia, reports that he has been\r\nraising crops of watermelons, weighing from 50 to 60 pounds each, on\r\nland blasted by exploding charges of about 3 ounces of dynamite in holes\r\n2-1/2 to 3 feet deep, spaced 8 to 10 feet apart.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting and Cultivating Orchards.\r\n\r\nIn the orchard \"Red Cross\" Dynamite not only saves much labor and time\r\nin planting the trees, but ensures the best growth and large yields.\r\n\r\nA man will spend an hour digging a tree hole that dynamite will excavate\r\nin an instant. The spaded hole will be hard all the way down, making it\r\ndifficult for the transplanted roots to take hold. This is one of the\r\nchief reasons why transplanted trees so often die.\r\n\r\n\"Red Cross\" Dynamite not only excavates the required hole, but also\r\nloosens the ground for yards around, killing all grubs, and forming a\r\nspongy reservoir for moisture. That is why trees planted in dynamited\r\nholes live and thrive.\r\n\r\nA whole row of tree holes can be excavated in one instant when charged\r\nwith \"Red Cross\" Dynamite.\r\n\r\nOld trees are benefited by exploding small charges under them, or\r\nbetween the rows. This keeps the ground loose, and free from grubs.\r\n\r\nA well known fruit grower reports that he planted peach trees some years\r\nago to determine whether anything was to be gained by using dynamite.\r\nA number of trees were planted in holes by detonating a charge of\r\nexplosives to make the holes, and others were planted in holes of the\r\nregulation size, dug by hand. Three years later the trees planted in the\r\nblasted holes were strong and healthy, each producing between five and\r\nsix bushels of very fine peaches. The other trees planted on the same\r\nground without blasting, bore no peaches, both fruit and leaves having\r\nshriveled up and dropped off during the dry season.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigging Ditches, Post Holes, Wells and Reservoirs.\r\n\r\nExcavating of any kind is slow, hard work when done with pick and\r\nshovel, especially in mixed ground containing large stones, roots,\r\nstreaks of gravel or shale.\r\n\r\nSeveral rods of ditch can be excavated in an instant with dynamite,\r\nvarying the size of each charge according to the nature of the ground at\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\nMost of the dirt is thrown out by the blast and the remainder is broken\r\nup ready for the shovel.\r\n\r\nA Missourian advises us of a ditch he has just blasted through a swamp\r\nfor $100, which he says would have cost him $500 if dug in the usual\r\nway.\r\n\r\nOn August 11, 1910, at the demonstration at Ivor, Va., above referred\r\nto, a ditch 85 feet in length, 3 feet deep and 4-1/2 feet wide at the\r\ntop, was blasted with dynamite, at a cost not exceeding 10 cents per\r\nyard, or about $2.75 for the entire work.\r\n\r\n\"Red Cross\" Dynamite is especially useful in excavating wells and\r\nreservoirs, as it opens up all the springs in nearby ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad-Making and Grading.\r\n\r\n\"Red Cross\" Dynamite is a big saver of time and labor in making new\r\nroads, or leveling grades on old roads. Rock, shale, clay, gravel or\r\nsand, can all be broken up with ease, simply by varying the charge\r\naccording to the nature of the ground and the depth of excavation\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcavating Cellars and Foundation Trenches.\r\n\r\nThis work can be done with \"Red Cross\" Dynamite in one-tenth the time\r\nrequired for hand and team shoveling, and the cost of the dynamite is\r\nbut a fraction of the value of the labor saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegenerating Old, Worn-Out Farms.\r\n\r\nAll over the Eastern and Southern sections of the United States are\r\nfarms and plantations, once rich, fertile and profitable, but now either\r\nabandoned, or so unproductive as to be almost worthless.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble with these farms is that the top soil is worked out.\r\n\r\n\"Red Cross\" Dynamite can be used with complete success to turn up an\r\nentirely fresh, fertile soil, and convert a $10 an acre \"worked-out\r\nfarm\" into land worth $50 to $100 an acre.\r\n\r\nThe cost in dynamite for this conversion would be about $10 to $15 an\r\nacre according to the nature of the soil.\r\n\r\nThis matter is worthy of as much consideration on the part of farmers,\r\nand all others concerned with national resources, as the reclamation of\r\ndesert areas in the West.\r\n\r\nSurely it is as important to restore the productiveness of established\r\nfarms in the East, as it is to open up new, fertile fields in the West\r\nand Southwest.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of your farm is not productive, it is probable that \"Red\r\nCross\" Dynamite can make it productive.\r\n\r\nThe leading railroads of the country are taking the greatest interest in\r\nthe increasing use of dynamite on the farm, because they know by actual\r\nresults that it means more and better crops, bigger shipments and\r\ngreater prosperity all along their lines.\r\n\r\nMr. H. B. Fullerton, Director Agricultural Development of the Long\r\nIsland Railroad, is one of the pioneers in this movement, and in an\r\narticle entitled \"Reclaiming Waste Land on Long Island,\" his wife, Edith\r\nLoring Fullerton, graphically describes the use of dynamite in the\r\npreparation of waste land for cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can We Help You?\r\n\r\nFor more than a hundred years we have been making and selling\r\nexplosives. We maintain a highly skilled corps of chemists, explosive\r\nspecialists, and field representatives, whose sole duties are to study\r\nconditions and devise means for handling them.\r\n\r\nIf there is any soil condition on your farm that we have not mentioned,\r\nand which you think might be remedied or improved by dynamite, please\r\nwrite us all about it. There will be no charge for the information we\r\nwill send you; in fact, we will be much obliged to you for giving us the\r\nopportunity to study any peculiar condition.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that the age, reputation and high standing of this Company\r\nare ample assurance that any statements made by us are conservative, and\r\nbased on long and varied experience.\r\n\r\nIn any case we want you to write for our \"Handbook of Explosives for\r\nFarmers, Planters and Ranchers,\" which we send out only on request, as\r\nit is too valuable to send to anyone not interested enough to ask for\r\nit. Asking for it puts you under no obligation to us except to read it.\r\n\r\nWe believe that when you have read it you will understand how simple,\r\nsafe and economical the use of \"Red Cross\" Dynamite is, and that you\r\nwill find many ways to save and make money with its aid.\r\n\r\n    E.
