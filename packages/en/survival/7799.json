The aim is not just to\r\nfurnish an interesting narrative, but one that is true to the course\r\nof human development and the scientific and geographical facts of the\r\nisland on which Robinson is supposed to have lived.\r\n\r\nThe excuse for departing so widely from the original story is to be\r\nfound in the use which was desired to be made of it. The story here\r\npresented is simply the free adaptation of the original narrative to\r\nthe demand for a specific kind of content in a form which would be\r\ninteresting to the children.\r\n\r\nThe teacher is and should be justified in using with entire freedom\r\nany material accessible for the ends of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe text as here given has been published with an introduction and\r\nsuggestive treatments as a Teacher's Manual for Primary Grades--\"The\r\nTeacher's Robinson Crusoe.\" Explicit directions and ample suggestions\r\nare made for the use of the story as material for instruction in all\r\nthe language arts, drawing, social history, and the manual arts.\r\n\r\nPublished by the Educational Publishing Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN\r\nROBINSON CRUSOE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nROBINSON WITH HIS PARENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere once lived in the city of New York, a boy by the name of\r\nRobinson Crusoe. He had a pleasant home. His father and mother were\r\nkind to him and sent him to school. They hoped that he would study\r\nhard and grow up to be a wise and useful man, but he loved rather to\r\nrun idle about the street than to go to school. He was fond of playing\r\nalong the River Hudson, for he there saw the great ships come and go.\r\nThey were as big as houses. He watched them load and unload their\r\ncargoes and hundreds of people get off and on. His father had told\r\nhim that the ships came from far distant lands, where lived many large\r\nanimals and black men. His father told him too, that in these faraway\r\ncountries the nuts on the trees grew to be as large as one's head and\r\nthat the trees were as high as church steeples.\r\n\r\nWhen Robinson saw the ships put out to sea, he would watch them till\r\nthey would disappear below the horizon far out in the ocean, and\r\nthink, \"Oh, if I could only go with them far away to see those strange\r\ncountries!\" Thus he would linger along the great river and wish he\r\nmight find an opportunity of making a voyage. Often it would be dark\r\nbefore he would get home. When he came into the house his mother would\r\nmeet him and say in a gentle voice, \"Why, Robinson, how late you are\r\nin getting home! You have been to the river again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON WATCHING THE SHIPS]\r\n\r\nThen Robinson would hang his head and feel deeply ashamed, and when\r\nhis father, who was a merchant, came home from the store, his mother\r\nwould tell him that Robinson had again been truant.\r\n\r\nThis would grieve his father deeply and he would go to the boy's\r\nbedside and talk earnestly with him. \"Why do you do so?\" he would say.\r\n\"How often have I told you to go to school every day?\" This would for\r\na time win Robinson back to school, but by the next week it had been\r\nforgotten and he would again be loitering along the river in spite\r\nof his father's remonstrances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS AN APPRENTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way one year after another slipped by. Robinson was not more\r\ndiligent. He was now almost sixteen years old and had not learned\r\nanything. Then came his birthday. In the afternoon his father called\r\nhim into his room. Robinson opened the door softly. There sat his\r\nfather with a sad face. He looked up and said, \"Well, Robinson, all\r\nyour schoolmates have long been busy trying to learn something, so\r\nthat they may be able to earn their own living. Paul will be a baker,\r\nRobert a butcher, Martin is learning to be a carpenter, Herman a\r\ntailor, Otto a blacksmith, Fritz is going to high school, because he\r\nis going to be a teacher. Now, you are still doing nothing. This will\r\nnot do. From this time on I wish you to think of becoming a merchant.\r\nIn the morning you will go with me to the store and begin work. If\r\nyou are attentive and skillful, when the time comes you can take up\r\nmy business and carry it on. But if you remain careless and continue\r\nto idle about, no one will ever want you and you must starve because\r\nyou will never be able to earn a living.\"\r\n\r\nSo the next morning Robinson went to the store and began work. He\r\nwrapped up sugar and coffee, he weighed out rice and beans. He sold\r\nmeal and salt, and when the dray wagon pulled up at the store, loaded\r\nwith new goods, he sprang out quickly and helped to unload it. He\r\ncarried in sacks of flour and chests of tea, and rolled in barrels\r\nof coffee and molasses. He also worked some at the desk. He looked\r\ninto the account books and saw in neat writing, \"Goods received\" and\r\n\"Goods sold.\" He noticed how his father wrote letters and reckoned\r\nup his accounts. He even took his pen in hand and put the addresses\r\non the letters and packages as well as he could.\r\n\r\nBut soon he was back in his careless habits. He was no longer\r\nattentive to business. He wrapped up salt instead of sugar. He put\r\nfalse weights on the scales. He gave some too much and others too\r\nlittle. His hands, only, were in the business, his mind was far away\r\non the ocean with the ships. When he helped unload the wagons, he\r\nwould often let the chests and casks drop, so that they were broken\r\nand their contents would run out on the ground. For he was always\r\nthinking, \"Where have these casks come from and how beautiful it must\r\nbe there!\" And many times packages came back because Robinson had\r\nwritten the name of the place or the country wrong. For when he was\r\nwriting the address, he was always thinking, \"You will be laid upon\r\na wagon and will then go into the ship.\" One day he had to write a\r\nletter to a man far over the sea. He could stand it no longer. His\r\nfather had gone out. He threw down the pen, picked up his hat and ran\r\nout to the Hudson to see the ships, and from that time on he spent\r\nmore time loitering along the river than he did in the store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S DEPARTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson's father soon noticed that his son was no longer attending\r\nto his work, and one morning sent for him to come to his office. When\r\nRobinson came in his father arose from his chair and looked him long\r\nand earnestly in the face. Then he said, \"I am very sorry, Robinson,\r\nthat you seem determined to continue your evil ways. If you do not\r\ndo better you will grow up to be a beggar or worse.\" Robinson cast\r\nhis eyes down and said, \"I do not want to be a merchant, I would rather\r\nsail in a ship around the world.\" His father answered, \"If you do not\r\nknow anything you cannot be of use on a ship, and no one will want\r\nyou. In a strange land you cannot live without working. If you run\r\naway from your parents you will come to be sorry for it.\" Robinson\r\nwept, for he saw that his father was right, and he promised to obey.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three weeks, Robinson went to his mother and said,\r\n\"Mother, won't you go to father and tell him that if he will only let\r\nme take one voyage and it proves to be unpleasant, I will come back\r\nto the store and work hard?\" But the mother cried. With tears in her\r\neyes, she said: \"Robinson, your brothers are both dead. You are the\r\nonly child left to us and if you go away, we shall be entirely alone.\r\nHow easy it would be to be drowned in the sea, or torn to pieces by\r\nwild animals away there in a foreign country. Both your father and\r\nmyself are getting along in years and who will take care of us when\r\nwe are sick? Do not cause us the grief we must suffer if you go away\r\nso far amid so many dangers. I cannot bear to have you speak of it\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson did not speak of it again, but he did not forget it. He was\r\nnineteen years old. It was one day in August that Robinson stood at\r\nthe wharf looking longingly after the departing ships. As he stood\r\nthere, someone touched him on the shoulder. It was a ship captain's\r\nson. He pointed to a long ship and said, \"My father sails to-day in\r\nthat ship for Africa and takes me with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I could only go with you!\" cried Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"Do come along,\" cried his comrade.\r\n\r\n\"But I have no money,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't make any difference,\" returned the captain's son. \"We\r\nwill take you anyway.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson, without thinking for a moment, gave his friend his hand and\r\npromised to go with him.\r\n\r\nSo without saying \"Good-bye\" to his parents, Robinson went immediately\r\non board the ship with his friend. This happened on the 10th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON AND THE CAPTAIN'S SON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON FAR FROM HOME\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S VOYAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce on board, Robinson watched the preparations for departure. At\r\ncommand the sailors clambered up into the rigging and loosened the\r\nsails. Then the captain from his bridge called out, \"Hoist the\r\nanchor!\" Then the great iron hooks that held the ship fast were lifted\r\nup, a cannon sounded a final farewell. Robinson stood on the deck.\r\nHe saw the great city shimmer in the sunshine before him. Very fast\r\nnow the land was being left behind. It was not long until all that\r\ncould be seen of his native city was the tops of the highest towers.\r\nThen all faded from sight. Behind, in front, right and left, he saw\r\nnothing but waters.\r\n\r\nHe became a little afraid. At noon there arose a strong wind and the\r\nship rocked to and fro. He became dizzy and had to hold fast to\r\nsomething. The masts and rigging began to dance. It seemed to him as\r\nif all was turning around. Suddenly he fell full length on the deck\r\nand it was impossible for him to get up. He was seasick. He wailed\r\nand cried, but no one heard him, no one helped him. Then he thought\r\nof his home, his parents whom he had so ungratefully left.\r\n\r\nHe had been on the water about two weeks when one day as he lay in\r\nhis room, Robinson heard people over his head running about and crying,\r\n\"A storm is coming!\" The ship's sides trembled and creaked. The ship\r\nwas tossed like a nutshell. Now it rolled to the right, now to the\r\nleft. And Robinson was thrown from one side to the other. Every moment\r\nhe expected the ship to sink. He turned pale and trembled with fear.\r\n\"Ah, if I were only at home with my parents, safe on the land,\" he\r\nsaid. \"If I ever get safe out of this, I will go home as quickly as\r\nI can and stay with my dear parents!\" The storm raged the whole day\r\nand the whole night. But on the next morning the wind went down and\r\nthe sea was calm. By evening the sky was clear and Robinson was again\r\ncheerful. He ran about the ship. He looked at the glittering stars\r\nand was contented and happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE SHIPWRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks went by. Robinson had long ago forgotten his resolutions\r\nto return home. It was very hot. The glowing sun beat down upon the\r\nship. The wide surface of the sea glistened. No breeze stirred. The\r\nsails hung loose on the top of the mast. But far away on the shore\r\ncould be seen a black bank of clouds.\r\n\r\nAll at once the ship was thrown violently to one side by a fierce gust\r\nof wind. Robinson threw himself on the deck. The sea began to rise\r\nand fall. The waves were as high as mountains. Now the ship was borne\r\naloft to the skies, and now it would seem that it must be overwhelmed\r\nin the sea. When it sank down between the great waves of water,\r\nRobinson thought it would never again rise. The waves beat violently\r\non the ship's side. Robinson went down the steps into his little room,\r\nbut he came back full of anxiety. He believed every minute he would\r\nmeet death in the waves. The night at last came on. The lightning\r\nflashed. The storm howled. The ship trembled. The water roared. So\r\nthe night wore on. The storm raged for six days. Then on the seventh\r\nday it was somewhat abated. But the hope was soon dashed. The storm\r\nhad abated but to get new strength. Suddenly it bore down with frightful\r\npower on the doomed vessel, struck it, and shot it like an arrow\r\nthrough the water. Then Robinson felt a fearful crash. The ship\r\ngroaned as if it would fall into a thousand pieces. It had struck a\r\nrock and there held fast. At the same moment the sailors raised the\r\ncry, \"The ship has sprung a leak!\" The water surged into the ship.\r\nAll called for help. Each one thought only of himself. There was only\r\none boat. The others had all been torn away. It was soon let down into\r\nthe sea. All sprang in. For a moment the sailors forgot the waves,\r\nbut all at once a wave, mountains high, struck the boat and swallowed\r\nit up. Robinson shut his eyes. The water roared in his ears. He sank\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nROBINSON SAVED\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was borne down far, far into the ocean. He attempted to work\r\nhimself up, so that he could see light and breathe the air. But again\r\nand again the waves carried him down. Finally a wave threw him up and\r\nhe saw, for a moment, the light of day and got a breath of air, but\r\nthe next instant he was deep under the water. Then another wave bore\r\nhim on its crest. He breathed a deep breath and at the same time saw\r\nland not far away. He bent all his strength toward reaching the land.\r\nHe got almost to it, when a wave caught him and hurled him on a\r\njutting rock. With all his strength he seized the rock with both hands\r\nand held on.\r\n\r\nPresently he worked himself up a little and at last got a foothold.\r\nBut, scarcely had he done so, when his strength left him and he fell\r\non the ground as one dead. But he soon revived. He opened his eyes\r\nand looked around. He saw above him the blue sky, and under him the\r\nsolid brown earth, and before him the gray angry sea. He felt to see\r\nif he still breathed. The storm had destroyed the ship. The waves had\r\noverwhelmed the boat. The water wished to draw him into the deep. The\r\nrocks seemed to want to hurl him back, but storm and wave and rock\r\nhad accomplished nothing. There was One who was stronger than they.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson sank on his knees and folded his hands. Tears came to\r\nhis eyes. He breathed hard. At last he said, \"Dear Father in Heaven,\r\nI live. Thou hast saved me. I thank Thee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST NIGHT ON LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where are my companions?\" That was his first thought. He began to\r\ncall and halloo: \"Where are you?\" \"Come here!\" But no one answered.\r\nThen he wished to see if anyone lived on the land, and he cried, \"Is\r\nthere no one here? Hello!\" but all remained still.\r\n\r\nAll at once he drew himself together and shrank back. He heard a bush\r\nrustle and the thought came like a flash, \"That is a wild animal that\r\nwill pounce upon me and tear my flesh with his teeth and claws. How\r\nshall I save myself? Where shall I fly for safety? Where shall I turn?\r\nI have nothing but my clothes and my life saved from the water. All\r\nthat I had the waves have swallowed up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then hunger and thirst began to trouble him. He had eaten nothing\r\nthe whole day and the salt water had made him sick.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the night had come on. Robinson was very tired.\r\nEverything was new and strange. He did not know which way to move.\r\nHe was in the greatest terror.\r\n\r\nHe expected to hear the roar of wild beasts from every secluded spot.\r\nLions and tigers and dreadful serpents filled his thoughts. He must\r\nfind shelter from them. But where should he pass the night? Not a\r\nhouse, a hut or a cave was to be seen. He stood a long time hesitating\r\nand did not know what to do. Finally he thought, \"I will do as the\r\nbirds do and get into a tree.\" He very soon found a tree which had\r\nsuch thick branches that it would hold him up.\r\n\r\nRobinson climbed up into the tree, made himself as comfortable as\r\npossible, said his prayers, and as he was thoroughly exhausted, he\r\nsoon fell asleep. When he awoke the sun was high in the sky. At first\r\nhe could not remember where he was. Then the truth burst upon him.\r\nHe tried to move. He was stiff and sore. His flesh was bruised from\r\nbeing thrown against the rocks and beaten by the waves.\r\n\r\nHe was dreadfully thirsty. His mouth and throat were dry and parched\r\nfrom the salt water. His tongue was thick and swollen. He said, \"I\r\nmust find some water to drink or I shall die!\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard work to get down from the tree. His limbs and back ached\r\nfrom sitting in the tree all night At last he slipped down and fell\r\non the ground. He clasped his hands in prayer and thanked God for keeping\r\nhim through the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen he got up and tried to walk. He was so weak he could not stand.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself down on the ground and began to sob and cry, \"O Lord,\r\ndo not let me die! Do not let me die!\" As he lay there he heard a\r\nqueer sound. He listened. It sounded like water running over rocks.\r\nHe tried to get to the place from which the sound came. He tried to\r\nwalk. When he fell he crawled on his hands and knees. At last the sound\r\nwas close by. He dragged himself up on the rocks. Yes, there was a\r\nspring of clear, cool, sparkling water bubbling up and trickling over\r\nthe stones. Robinson was so thirsty he put his face into the water\r\nand drank and drank.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down, and after a while he drank again and again.\r\n\r\nAfter Robinson had satisfied his thirst and rested awhile, he felt\r\nmuch better. He said, \"I must try to walk and see whether I can find\r\nsomething to eat.\" He found many kinds of fruits and berries all\r\naround him, but he was afraid to eat them, as they were strange to\r\nhim and he feared they might be poisonous.\r\n\r\nAs he was walking along, all at once he spied a tall plant in the\r\ndistance which had a familiar look. It looked like corn. He said to\r\nhimself, \"I wonder if it can be corn.\" At last he came near enough\r\nto recognize it. Yes, it was corn. It did not look exactly like the\r\ncorn that he saw at home, but still he knew it would be safe to eat\r\nit. He broke off an ear and eagerly ate the kernels raw. Oh, how good\r\nit was! Robinson could not remember anything that tasted half so good.\r\n\r\nHe ate as much as he wanted and then filled his pockets with ears of\r\ncorn for his supper. Then he went back to the spring to get another\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON ON AN ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his hunger and thirst were satisfied, Robinson thought he would\r\ntry to find another dwelling place. \"My legs are stiff and sore from\r\nsitting so uncomfortably last night, and there is so much danger of\r\nfalling,\" he said. \"I will climb yonder hill and look around and see\r\non which side the houses are. I will find me a stick to help me on\r\nmy way.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke a stick from a dry bush and climbed up the steep sides of\r\nthe hill. After a half hour's climb he was on top. What a sight met\r\nhis eyes! There were no houses, no huts to be seen, no smoke arose\r\nfrom the forest, no field could be seen. Nothing but trees and bush,\r\nsand and rock.\r\n\r\n\"I am then upon an island alone, without food, without shelter,\r\nwithout weapons! What will become of me?\" he cried. \"I am a prisoner.\r\nThe island is my prison, the waves are the guards which will not allow\r\nme to get away. Will no ship ever come to set me free?\"\r\n\r\nHe stretched his gaze out to the sea till his eyes ached, but he saw\r\nno ship.\r\n\r\nRobinson came down and seated himself on a stone and considered what\r\nhe should do. It was not yet noon, yet he feared greatly the next\r\nnight. \"I must find me a better bed,\" was his first clear thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S SHELTER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson saw at a little distance what seemed to be a cleft or an\r\nopening in a huge rock. \"If I could only get inside and find room to\r\nstay over night. The rock would protect me from rain, from the wind\r\nand wild animals better than a tree.\"\r\n\r\nHe long sought in vain for a place wide enough to allow him to get\r\ninto the opening in the rock. He was about to give up, when he seized\r\nhold of a branch of a thorn tree growing on the side of the rock. He\r\nlooked closer and saw that it grew out of the cleft in the rock. He\r\nsaw, too, that at this point the opening was wider and that he had\r\nonly to remove the tree in order to get in. \"The hole shall be my\r\ndwelling,\" he said. \"I must get the thorn tree out so that I can have\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nThat was easily said. He had neither axe nor saw, nor knife nor spade.\r\nHow could he do it? He had nothing but his hands. He tried to pull\r\nit out by the roots, but in vain. He wasn't strong enough.\r\n\r\n\"I must dig it out,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\nHe scratched with his nails, but the earth was too hard. What should\r\nhe do? He sought a stick with a fork in it and dug in the earth, but\r\nit was slow work. Then he found a clamshell. He did better with it,\r\nbut it was hard work, and Robinson was not used to hard work. The\r\nsweat ran down his face and he had often to stop and rest in the\r\nshade. The sun burned so hot and the rock so reflected the heat that\r\nhe was all but overcome. But he worked on. When evening came, he would\r\nsleep in the tree and next morning he would go at it again. On the\r\nthird day the roots were all laid bare.\r\n\r\nBut the roots were fast in the clefts of the rock and he could not\r\nloosen it, try ever so hard. What would he not have given for an axe,\r\nor at least a knife. And yet he had never thought of their value when\r\nat home. He attempted to cut one root through with his clam-shell,\r\nbut the shell crumbled and would not cut the hard wood.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a long time thinking, not knowing what next to do. He\r\nmade up his mind that he must have something harder than the shell\r\nto cut with. Then he tried a stone with a sharp edge, but soon found\r\nhe needed another one, however. He found one. Then he set the sharp\r\none on the wood and struck it with the heavy one. In this way he slowly\r\ncut the roots in two.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day there was yet left one big root, bigger than any of\r\nthe others. Robinson got up early in the morning. He worked the whole\r\nday. Finally it gave a crack and it, too, was broken.\r\n\r\nRobinson had only now to remove the loose earth inside the cleft. He\r\nfound the opening could be made large and roomy. It was choked up with\r\ndirt. He dug out enough to allow him room enough to make a place to\r\nlie down. \"In the future,\" he thought, \"I will take out all the dirt\r\nand then I shall be comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then dark and the moon shone bright in the heavens. Robinson\r\ngathered a heap of dry grass and made himself a safe bed. But as he\r\nlay there he saw the moonbeams shining into his cave. He sprang up.\r\n\"How easy,\" he thought, \"for wild animals to creep in here upon me.\"\r\n\r\nHe crawled out and looked around. Not far from the cave he saw a large\r\nflat stone. With great trouble he rolled it to the opening of his\r\ncave, but before this the morning began to dawn. He went inside the\r\nshelter, seized the stone with both hands and rolled it into the\r\nopening till it almost closed it. \"I have now a closed home. I can\r\nagain stretch my legs. Wind and rain cannot get at me, nor wild\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES A HAT\r\n\r\n\r\nRefreshed and with renewed strength, Robinson awoke late the next\r\nmorning, but he had a bad headache. The day before the hot tropic sun\r\nhad beat down on his bare head, as he worked at his cave. He was so\r\nbusy that he forgot to go into the shade from time to time in order\r\nto shield himself from the scorching sunshine. He felt a new need.\r\n\r\n\"I must make me a hat,\" said Robinson to himself. \"But how?\" He had\r\nno straw, no thread and no needle. He looked around for a long time,\r\nbut found nothing. The sun mounted even higher in the heavens, and\r\nshone hotter and hotter. He went to seek shelter at last in the deep\r\nshade of a nearby tall plant.\r\n\r\nAs he stood there he examined the plant more carefully. \"Out of these\r\nleaves,\" he said, \"I might make a hat.\" He climbed up the short stem\r\nof the plant and saw that it had not only leaves as long as himself,\r\nbut between the leaves were big bunches of long, thin fruit, as thick\r\nas three fingers and similar in shape to a cucumber.\r\n\r\nHe plucked the leaves and fruit and was about to eat some of the fruit\r\nwhen he heard near him a light stir as of some animal. He rolled the\r\nleaves and fruit together and hastened back to the cave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANANA TREE]\r\n\r\nThe bananas, for that is what the fruit proved to be, were sweet and\r\nrefreshing. After he had eaten enough he set immediately about making\r\nhis hat. He broke off a couple of reeds. He bent one into a hoop. But\r\nthe hoop would not hold without thread. Sometimes it was too large\r\nand sometimes too small. But it must fit his head. He pulled up grass\r\nand bound its ends together, but the grass stalks were not strong enough.\r\nHe hunted until he found a tree whose inner bark was soft and came\r\nout in long fibres. He bound his reed with this. This, too, made the\r\nhoop soft so that it did not hurt his head.\r\n\r\nWhen the hoop was ready and fitted to his head he found the banana\r\nleaves could not be used. Their veins ran straight out from the\r\nmidrib. This made them easily torn, and besides, they were too large.\r\nThey were not the best shape. He saw that leaves about a foot long\r\nwith broad and tapering points would be best. He saw too, that if the\r\nleaves had their veins running parallel with the midrib they would\r\nbe stronger. He made search and at length found leaves that seemed\r\nmade for his purpose. They were thick and leathery and tapered from\r\nbase to apex like a triangle.\r\n\r\nHe now proceeded with his hat-making. He would take a leaf and lay\r\nit on the ground with the base toward him. Then he laid the hoop on\r\nthe base of the leaf, wrapped it around the hoop and fastened it with\r\nthorns. He did the same with the other leaves. The thorns were his\r\npins. At last he pinned the tips of the leaves together at the top\r\nand the hat was ready. It looked just like a big cone, but it kept\r\nout the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nRobinson now had corn and bananas and when he was thirsty he drank\r\na handful of water from the spring. He had been now nine days on the\r\nisland. Every day he looked out on the sea until his eyes ached to\r\nsee if he might discover a ship.\r\n\r\nHe could not understand why no ship came his way. \"Who knows how long\r\nI must wait here?\" said he sorrowfully. Then the thought came to him:\r\n\"You will not be able to keep track of the days unless you write it\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S CALENDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter of keeping track of time puzzled Robinson very much. It\r\nwas getting more difficult every day to keep it in his memory. He must\r\nwrite down the days as they slip by, but where and how? He had neither\r\npen, ink, nor paper. Should he mark every day with a colored stone\r\non the smooth side of the huge rock wall within whose clefts he had\r\ndug out his cave? But the rain would wash off the record and then he\r\nwould lose all his bearings. Then he thought of the beach, but there\r\nthe wind and waves would soon also erase it.\r\n\r\nHe thought a long time. \"I must find something,\" he said to himself\r\non which to keep a record. \"I must also know when Sunday is. I must\r\nrest one day in the week. Yes, I must find something,\" he said, \"on\r\nwhich to write.\" And finally he found it. He chose two trees standing\r\nnear each other and then sought for a small sharp stone, which he could\r\nmake still sharper by striking it on another. When he had got this\r\npen ready he cut into the bark of one tree:\r\n\r\n  _Shipwreck, Sunday, 10th of September, 1875._\r\n\r\nHe made seven cuts in a row for the seven days in the week. The first\r\ncut was longer than the others. This was to represent the Sunday. At\r\nsundown every day he made a new cut in the bark.\r\n\r\nThe other tree he called the month tree. On its stem he was to cut\r\na mark every time his week tree told him a month had passed. But he\r\nmust be careful, for the months were not of equal length. But he remembered\r\nthat his teacher had once said in school that the months could be\r\ncounted on the knuckles and hollows of the hand, in such a way that\r\nthe long and short months could be found easily and he could tell in\r\nthis way the number of days in each.\r\n\r\nRobinson worked at enlarging his shelter a little every day. He was\r\nsorely at loss to find something in which to carry the dirt away from\r\nthe entrance, or enough so that it would not choke up the opening.\r\nA large clam shell was all he could think of at present. He would carry\r\nthe dirt to the entrance and some distance away, and then throw it.\r\nFortunately the ground sloped away rapidly, so that he needed a kind\r\nof platform before his door.\r\n\r\nHe was careful to open the cleft at some distance above the large\r\nopening. For the air was damp and impure in the shelter. But with the\r\nopening made high above, fresh air was constantly passing into, and\r\nimpure air out of, his cave. Light, too, was admitted in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES A HUNTING BAG\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed with Robinson's hat-making and his calendar-making\r\nand his watching the sea. Every day his corn and bananas became more\r\ndistasteful to him. And he planned a longer journey about the island\r\nto see if something new to eat could be found.\r\n\r\nBut he considered that if he went a distance from his cave and found\r\nsomething it would really be of little use to him. \"I could eat my\r\nfill,\" he said, \"but that is all. And by the time I get back to my\r\ncave I will again be hungry. I must find something in which I can\r\ngather and carry food.\" He found nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The people in New York,\" he said, \"have baskets, or pockets, or bags\r\nmade of coarse cloth. Of them all, I could most easily make the net,\r\nperhaps, of vines. But the little things would fall out of the net.\r\nI will see whether I can make a net of small meshes.\"\r\n\r\nBut he soon saw that the vines did not give a smooth surface. He\r\nthought for a long while. In his garden at home his father had\r\nsometimes bound up the young trees with the soft inner bark of others.\r\nHe wondered if he could use this. He stripped away the outer bark from\r\nthe tree, which before had yielded him a fibre for his hat, and pulled\r\noff the long, smooth pieces of the inner bark. He twisted them\r\ntogether. Then he thought how he could weave the strands together.\r\nHe looked at his shirt. A piece was torn off and unravelled. He could\r\nsee the threads go up and down. He saw that some threads go from left\r\nto right (woof), others lengthwise (the warp).\r\n\r\nFrom his study of the woven cloth, Robinson saw he must have a firmer\r\nthread than the strips of bark gave alone. He separated his bark into\r\nlong, thin strips. These he twisted into strands or yarn by rolling\r\nbetween his hands, or on a smooth surface. As he twisted it he wound\r\nit on a stick. It was slow, hard work. Of all his work, the making\r\nof yarn or thread gave him the most trouble. He learned to twist it\r\nby knotting the thread around the spindle or bobbin on which he wound\r\nit and twirling this in the air. He remembered sadly the old spinning\r\nwheel we had seen at his grandmother's house.\r\n\r\nHis next care was something to hold the threads while he wove them\r\nin and out. He had never seen a loom.\r\n\r\nAfter long study Robinson set two posts in the ground and these he\r\nbound with seventy-two strands horizontally under each other. Then\r\nhe tied in the top at the left another thread and wove it in and out\r\nthrough the seventy-two threads. So he tied seventy-two vertical\r\nstrands and wove them in and out. Thus he had a net three times as\r\nlong as his foot and as wide as long. He tied the four corners\r\ntogether. He made a woven handle for it and put it on his shoulder\r\nlike a sack, saying gleefully, \"This shall be my hunting bag.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S LOOM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON EXPLORES THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Robinson made his hunting bag he was anxious to set off on his\r\njourney of exploring the island. So he arose very early next morning.\r\n\"Before it is hot,\" thought he, \"I will be quite a distance on my\r\njourney.\" He ate a couple of bananas, scooped up a few handfuls of\r\nwater from the spring, stuck a few ears of corn in his hunting bag,\r\ntook his stick in his hand and went forth. As he left his cave the\r\nthought struck him: \"What if I could not find my cave again? How can\r\nI manage so that I can come back to it? I will go away in one direction\r\nand return the same way; but suppose I were to lose the way?\"\r\n\r\nThen he noticed his shadow pointing like a great finger from the sea\r\ntoward the land. He could direct himself by that. He kept his shadow\r\nin front of him. He had noticed, too, that the wind always blew north\r\nof the point where the sun rose. This helped him. But sometimes the\r\nwind died down.\r\n\r\nHe had to climb over many rocks and pierce many thickets. At each step\r\nhe saw a rich growth of plants, stems, leaves, flowers, but nothing\r\nto eat, no fruits, or nuts. At length he came to a tree as high as\r\na small church steeple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOANUT PALM TREE]\r\n\r\nThen he thought of what his father had once said about the trees in\r\nstrange countries. \"Many are as tall as a church steeple and the nuts\r\nare as big as one's head.\" He looked again. Yes, there they hung among\r\nthe leaves, concealed high above in the crown! But _so_ high, it\r\nwas well that Robinson had learned to climb while on board the ship.\r\nHe quickly laid down his hunting bag and clambered up the smooth stem\r\nof the high tree, a palm. He picked off a nut and threw it down and\r\nthen several more, and climbed down again.\r\n\r\nBut the nuts were very hard. How should he open them? He had brought\r\nalong his sharp stone with which he had stripped off the inner bark.\r\nWith this he forced off the thick outer shell. But now came the hard\r\nnut within, and how hard it was! Striking it was of no use.\r\n\r\nThen he threw a great stone on the nut. The shell was crushed and a\r\nsnow-white kernel lay before him. It tasted like almond. With\r\nastonishment Robinson saw in the middle of the nut a large empty space\r\nwhich must have been filled with fluid as the inside was wet. He\r\nwished that he had the juice to drink, for he was very thirsty. With\r\nthis in view, he examined another and riper nut, and the outside came\r\noff more easily. But how could he break it and at the same time save\r\nthe juice? He studied the hull of the cocoanut on all sides. At the\r\nends were three little hollows. He attempted first to bore in with\r\nhis fingers, but he could not. \"Hold!\" he cried. \"Maybe I can cut them\r\nthere with the point of my stone knife.\" This was done without trouble\r\nand out of the hole flowed the sweet, white juice.\r\n\r\nRobinson put a couple of nuts in his hunting bag, and also the shells\r\nfrom the broken nuts. \"Now,\" he thought, \"I shall no longer have to\r\ndrink from my hand.\" With this thought he went on his way.\r\n\r\nAs Robinson came to a rock in his path, out jumped what Robinson took\r\nto be a rabbit. He ran after him to catch him, but the rabbit was much\r\nthe swifter. So Robinson hastened home, but before he reached it the\r\nstars were shining with their lustrous light. Tired Robinson stretched\r\nhis limbs on his bed of grass and leaves and slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS A HUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the time Robinson was confined to the cave he kept thinking about\r\nthe rabbit he had seen and how he might catch one. Finally, he\r\ndetermined to make a spear. He broke down a thin, young sapling,\r\nstripped off its branches and in one end fastened a sharp stone. He\r\nthen went to bed, for he wanted to be up early for his first hunting\r\ntrip on the morrow.\r\n\r\nWith his hunting sack and spear, Robinson began to creep very, very\r\ncautiously through the underbrush. But he did not go far before he\r\nsaw a lot of rabbits feeding peacefully on the soft leaves and grass.\r\nHe drew back and threw his spear with all his might. But the spear\r\ndid not reach the rabbits. It fell far short and the rabbits sprang\r\nup and ran quickly away. He tried it several times with the same result.\r\nThen Robinson, discouraged, turned back home and ate his corn, bananas,\r\nand cocoanuts without meat. In the meantime he found a new kind of\r\nfood. He discovered a nest of eggs. How good they tasted to him!\r\n\r\nBut his longing for meat was still very great. \"I will try to make\r\na bow and arrow,\" he said. No sooner said than done. He bent a long\r\npiece of tough, young wood and stretched between the ends a cord\r\ntwisted out of the fiber taken from the cocoanut shell. He then sought\r\nfor a piece of wood for arrows. He split the ends with his flint knife\r\nand fastened in splinters of stone. At the other end he fastened on\r\nsome feathers found on the ground. The arrows flew through the air\r\nwith great swiftness. \"They will go far enough,\" thought Robinson,\r\n\"if I could only hit anything.\"\r\n\r\nHe practised shooting. He stuck his stone knife in a tree and shot\r\nat it the whole day long. At first he could not hit it at all. The\r\narrows flew far from the mark. After a while he could hit the tree,\r\nbut not the knife. Then as he practised, his arm grew ever surer, until\r\nat last he could hit the knife at almost every attempt. After a few\r\ndays he again went rabbit hunting. He thought that the rabbit did not\r\noffer a mark so high as his knife, so he stuck a stone in the ground\r\nand practised shooting at that. He gradually increased the distance\r\nuntil he could hit the mark at twenty or thirty yards.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Robinson took his bow and arrows and went out to\r\nhunt. He aimed at a rabbit, shot, and it fell, pierced by the arrow.\r\nHis very first shot was successful.\r\n\r\nHe hastened up and took the dead rabbit on his shoulder, carried it\r\nto his cave and skinned it. Then he cut off a nice, large piece of\r\nmeat and was going to roast it, but alas, he had no fire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S SHOES AND PARASOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Robinson could not get up. His feet were swollen and\r\nsore in consequence of walking without shoes over thorns and stones.\r\nHe must remain the whole day in his cave.\r\n\r\nBefore him, in the sun, his walking stick stuck in the ground. He\r\nthought how he had been troubled yesterday to find his way and about\r\nthe shadow. He had now time to study it. He watched it the whole day\r\nthrough. In the morning it pointed toward the land. In the evening\r\ntoward the sea. This comes from the daily movement of the sun. He\r\ndetermined to study the matter more carefully.\r\n\r\nRobinson got up and with great effort walked to the spring. There he\r\ncooled his burning feet, and gathered some large leaves, which he\r\nbound on them. He decided to remain in his cave a few days, for he\r\nhad enough food stored up to last him some length of time. He planned\r\nhow he might make himself a pair of shoes. As soon as his feet were\r\nwell, he sought out some thick bark and put fastenings of tough, strong\r\nfiber on it. These served very well to protect his feet.\r\n\r\nBut he must have some further protection from the sun. It beamed so\r\nhot that his hat was not enough. He made a parasol out of leaves like\r\nhis hat. He took a straight stick for a handle. He tied some reeds\r\ntogether and bent them into a hoop. He then fastened the upper end\r\nof the stick in the center of the hoop by means of six reeds which\r\nformed the ribs of the parasol. To keep out the sun he covered this\r\nframework with large, broad leaves. With a cord he tied the stem ends\r\nof the leaves to the stick just above where the reeds were tied.\r\n\r\nSpread out, these broad leaves completely covered the ribs. Their tips\r\nreached over the hoop. They were fastened together by means of small,\r\nneedle-like fish-bones Robinson had found on the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nGETTING FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Robinson had heard that savages take two dry pieces of wood and\r\nrub them so long on each other that they at length begin to burn.\r\n\r\nHe tried it. The sweat ran down his cheeks, but every time the wood\r\nwas about to catch fire his strength would give out, and he was\r\nobliged to rest, and when he began again the wood was cold.\r\n\r\n\"How will it be in winter,\" he cried, \"when it is cold, and I have\r\nno fire?\" He must try other ways of preparing meat for his table. He\r\nmust think of some other way of getting fire. He remembered that once,\r\nwhen a boy at home, he had in playing with a stick made it hot by twirling\r\nit on end on a piece of wood. \"I will try this,\" he thought. He\r\nsearched for a good hard stick and a piece of wood upon which to turn\r\nor twirl it with his hands. Having found the best materials at hand,\r\nhe began to twirl the stick. He made a little hollow in the block of\r\nwood in which to turn his upright stick. There was heat but no fire.\r\nHe twirled and twirled, but he could not get the wood hot enough to\r\nblaze up or ignite. He had not skill. Besides his hands were not used\r\nto such rough treatment. Soon they blistered and this method had to\r\nbe given up.\r\n\r\n\"I must have fire,\" he still thought, and recalled the sparks that\r\nflew from the stone pavements of the streets when the iron shoes of\r\nthe horses struck them as they slipped and strained at their cruel\r\nloads. Why may I not get fire by striking together two stones? He\r\nsought out two hard stones and with great diligence kept striking them\r\ntogether until his strength gave out, and he was obliged again to\r\nacknowledge failure.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that sometimes travelers put the meat underneath the\r\nsaddle and ride on it until it is soft. He tried it with pounding.\r\nHe laid some of the meat on a flat stone and pounded it. It became\r\nquite soft and tasted very well. He then tried hanging it in the sun\r\nand finally wrapped it in leaves and buried it for a few hours in the\r\nhot sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES SOME FURNITURE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing troubled Robinson very much. He could not sit comfortably\r\nwhile eating. He had neither chair nor table. He wished to make them,\r\nbut that was a big job. He had no saw, no hammer, no auger and no\r\nnails. Robinson could not, therefore, make a table of wood.\r\n\r\nNot far from his cave he had seen a smooth, flat stone. \"Ay,\" thought\r\nhe, \"perhaps I can make me a table out of stone.\" He picked out the\r\nbest stone and built up four columns as high as a table and on these\r\nhe laid his large, flat stone. It looked like a table, sure enough,\r\nbut there were rough places and hollows in it. He wanted it smooth.\r\nHe took clay and filled up the holes and smoothed it off. When the\r\nclay dried, the surface was smooth and hard. Robinson covered it with\r\nleaves and decked it with flowers till it was quite beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhen the table was done, Robinson began on a chair, He made it also\r\nof stone. It had no back. It looked like a bench. It was uncomfortable\r\nto sit on. Robinson covered it with moss. Then it was an easy seat.\r\n\r\nTable and chair were now ready. Robinson could not move them from one\r\ncorner to another, nor when he sat on the chair could he put his feet\r\nunder the table, and yet he thought them excellent pieces of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nEvery day Robinson went hunting and shot a rabbit, but the meat would\r\nnot keep. At home they would have put it in the cellar. If only he\r\nhad a cellar! He saw near his cave a hole in the rock. He dug it out\r\na little with his mussel shell and found that it led back under a rock.\r\n\r\nFrom much bending over in digging, Robinson's back, unused to severe\r\ntoil, ached wretchedly. He decided to make a spade. With his flint\r\nhe bored four holes in a great, round mussel shell. They formed a\r\nrectangle as long as a little finger and as wide. Through these holes\r\nhe drew cocoanut fibre and bound the shell to a handle fast and\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nWith his spade he dug a hole so deep that he could stand in it\r\nupright. Then he put in a couple of shelves made of flat stones. In\r\nthis cellar he put his rabbit meat and his eggs. Then he laid branches\r\nover it and finally covered the whole with leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON BECOMES A SHEPHERD\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his bow and arrow, Robinson went hunting every day. The rabbits\r\nsoon learned to know him and let themselves be seldom seen. As soon\r\nas they saw him, they took alarm. They became timid and shy. One day\r\nRobinson went out as usual to shoot rabbits. He found none. But as\r\nhe came to a great rock he heard from behind a new sound, one he had\r\nnot heard before in the island. Ba-a-a, it sounded.\r\n\r\n\"A kid,\" thought Robinson, \"like that with which I have so often\r\nplayed at home.\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped noiselessly around the rock and behold, really there stood\r\na kid. He tried to call it, but the kid sought safety in flight. He\r\nhastened after it. Then he noticed that it was lame in one fore foot.\r\nIt ran into some brush, where Robinson seized it by the horns and held\r\nit fast.\r\n\r\nHow Robinson rejoiced! He stroked it and fondled it. Then he thought,\r\nhow could it come into this wilderness on this lonesome island? \"Has\r\nyour ship been cast upon the rocks too, and been broken to pieces?\r\nYou dear thing, you shall be my comrade.\" He seized the goat by the\r\nlegs, and no matter how it kicked, carried it to his cave.\r\n\r\nThen he fetched quickly a cocoanut shell full of water and washed and\r\nbathed the goat's wounded leg. A stone had rolled down from the hill\r\nand had inflicted a severe wound on its left fore leg, or perhaps it\r\nhad stepped into a crack in the rocks. Robinson tore off a piece of\r\nlinen from his shirt, dipped it in water and bound it with shreds of\r\nthe cocoanut upon the wound. Then he pulled some grass and moss and\r\nmade a soft bed near the door of the cave. After he had given it\r\nwater, it looked at him with thankful eyes and licked his hand.\r\n\r\nRobinson could not sleep that night. He thought continually of his\r\ngoat and got up time and again to see if it was safe. The moon shone\r\nclear in the heavens. As Robinson sat before the goat's bed he looked\r\ndown on his new possession as lovingly as a mother on her child.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Robinson's first thought was, \"I am no longer alone.\r\nI have a companion, my goat.\" He sprang up and looked for it. There\r\nshe lay on her side, still sleeping.\r\n\r\nAs he stood and considered, the thought came to him that perhaps the\r\ngoat had escaped from its keeper. There must then be some one living\r\non the land. He quickly put on his shoes and his hat, took his\r\nparasol, and ran to the rock where he had found the goat.\r\n\r\nHe called, he sought, he peered about to see if some shepherd were\r\nthere somewhere. He found nothing. He found no trace of man. There\r\nwas no road, no bridge, no field, no logs, not even a chip or shaving\r\nto show that the hand of man had been there.\r\n\r\nBut what was that? In the distance ran a herd of goats over the rocks.\r\nBut no dog followed them and no shepherd. They ran wild on the island.\r\nThey had perhaps been left there by some ship. As he came home he\r\nnoticed the goat sorrowfully. The bandage had become dry. The goat\r\nmight be suffering pain. Robinson loosened the bandage, washed the\r\nwound again and bound it up anew. It was so trustful. It ran after\r\nhim and he decided always to protect it.\r\n\r\n\"I will always be your shepherd and take care of you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nROBINSON BUILDS A HOME FOR HIS GOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the goat was a new care. Wild animals could come and kill and\r\ncarry Robinson's goat away while he slept, and if the goat got\r\nfrightened while he was hunting it would run away.\r\n\r\n\"I will have to make me a little yard in front of my cave,\" he said,\r\n\"for my goat to live in.\" But from whence must come the tools? He had\r\nneither hatchet nor saw. Where then were the stakes to come from? He\r\nwent in search of something. After hunting for a long time he came\r\nupon a kind of thistle about two feet higher than himself, having at\r\nits top a red torch-like blossom. There were a great many of them.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" thought Robinson. \"If I could only dig up enough of them and\r\nplant them thick around the door of my cave, I would have just the\r\nthing. No one could get at me, nor at the goat, either, The thorns\r\nwould keep anything from creeping through, peeping in or getting\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nSo he took his mussel-shell spade and went to work. It was pretty\r\nhard, but at length he succeeded in laying bare the roots of quite\r\na number. But he could not drag them to his cave on account of the\r\nthorns sticking in him. He thought a long time. Finally, he sought\r\nout two strong poles or branches which were turned up a little at one\r\nend and like a sled runner. To these he tied twelve cross-pieces with\r\nbark. To the foremost he tied a strong rope made from cocoa fiber.\r\nHe then had something that looked much like a sled on which to draw\r\nhis thistle-like brush to his cave. But for one day he had done enough.\r\nThe transplanting of the thistles was hard work. His spade broke and\r\nhe had to make a new one. In the afternoon he broke his spade again.\r\nAnd as he made his third one, he made up his mind that it was no use\r\ntrying to dig with such a weak tool in the hard ground. It would only\r\nbreak again.\r\n\r\n\"If I only had a pick.\" But he had none. He found a thick, hard, sharp\r\nstone. With it he picked up the hard earth, but had to bend almost\r\ndouble in using it. \"At home,\" he thought, \"they have handles to\r\npicks.\" The handle was put through a hole in the iron. He turned the\r\nmatter over and over in his mind, how he might put a hole through the\r\nstone. But he found no means. He searched out a branch with a crotch\r\nat one end. He tied the stone to this with strong cocoa fiber and\r\nbark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S TOOLS]\r\n\r\nHow his eye glistened as he looked at the new tool! Now he began to\r\nwork. He first loosened up the earth with his pick, then he dug it\r\nout with his spade and planted in a high thistle. Many days he had\r\nto work, but finally one evening the hedge was ready. He had a row\r\nin a semicircle in front of his cave. He counted the marks on his calendar\r\ntree. The day on which he had begun to make his hedge he had\r\nespecially marked out. He had worked fourteen days.\r\n\r\nHe had completed his hedge with the exception of a small hole that\r\nmust serve for a door. But the door must not be seen from without.\r\n\r\nAs Robinson thought, it came to him that there was still place for\r\ntwo thistles on the outside. He could easily get in, but the entrance\r\nwas difficult to find from the outside.\r\n\r\nRobinson looked on his hedge from without. It was not yet thick\r\nenough. For this reason he planted small thistles between the larger\r\nones. With the digging them out and transplanting them he was a whole\r\nweek longer.\r\n\r\nFinally, the hedge and the yard were ready. Now Robinson could rest\r\nwithout fear and sleep in his cave, and could have his goat near him\r\nall the time. It delighted him greatly. It ran after him continually\r\nlike a dog. When he came back from an absence, it bleated for joy and\r\nran to meet him as soon as he got inside the hedge. Robinson felt that\r\nhe was not entirely alone. He had now a living being near him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nROBINSON GETS READY FOR WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that troubled Robinson greatly. \"What will become\r\nof me when the winter comes? I will have no fire to warm me. I have\r\nno clothing to protect me from the cold, and where shall I find food\r\nwhen snow and ice cover all the ground and when the trees are bare\r\nand the spring is frozen? It will be cold then in my cave; what shall\r\nI do? It is cold and rainy already. I believe this is harvest time\r\nand winter will soon be here. Winter and no stove, no winter clothing,\r\nno winter store of food and no winter dwelling. What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\nHe considered again the project of making fire. He again sought out\r\ntwo pieces of wood and sat down and rubbed them together. The sweat\r\nrolled down his face. When the wood began to get warm, his hand would\r\nbecome tired, and he would have to stop. When he began again the wood\r\nwas cold. He worked for an hour or two, then he laid the wood aside\r\nand said, \"I don't believe I can do it I must do the next best thing.\r\nI can at least get warm clothing to protect me from the rain and\r\nsnow.\" He looked down at his worn, thin clothing, his trousers, his\r\nshirt, his jacket; they had become so thin and worn that they were\r\nthreadbare.\r\n\r\n\"I will take the skins of the hares which I have shot and will make\r\nme something,\" he thought. He washed and cleaned them, but he needed\r\na knife and he set about making one. He split one end of a tough piece\r\nof wood, thrust his stone blade in it and wound it with cocoa fibre.\r\nHis stone knife now had a handle. He could now cut the skins quite\r\nwell. But what should he do for needle and thread? Maybe the vines\r\nwould do. \"But they are hardly strong enough,\" he thought. He pulled\r\nthe sinews from the bones of the rabbit and found them hard. Maybe\r\nhe could use them. He found fish skeletons on the seashore and bored\r\na hole in the end of the small, sharp rib bones. Then he threaded his\r\nbone needle with the rabbit sinews and attempted to sew, but it would\r\nnot go. His needle broke. The skin was too hard. He bored holes in\r\nthe edge of the pieces of skin and sewed through the holes. This went\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nHe sewed the skins together with the hair side inward, made himself\r\na jacket, a pair of trousers, a hat, and finally covered his parasol\r\nwith rabbit skin, for the rain had already dripped through the leaves\r\nof it. All went well, only the trousers did not fit. He loosened them\r\nand puckered them to no purpose. \"Anyway,\" he thought, \"I am now well\r\nprotected from the cold, when it does come.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON IN HIS NEW SUIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nHOW ROBINSON LAYS UP A STORE OF FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for the food. Could Robinson preserve the meat? He had often heard\r\nhis mother tell about preserving meat in salt. He had even eaten salt\r\nmeat, pickled meat. But where could he get salt?\r\n\r\nOne day when the wind blew hard the water was driven upon the shore\r\nand filled a little hollow. After a few days the ground glistened\r\nwhite as snow where the water had been. Was it snow? Robinson took\r\nit in his hands and put it in his mouth. It was salt. The sun had\r\nevaporated the water in the hollow--had vaporized it--and the air had\r\ndrunk it up. What was left behind? Salt. Now he could get salt as long\r\nas he needed it.\r\n\r\nHe took cocoanut shells and strewed salt in them. Then he cut the\r\nrabbit meat in thin strips, rubbed them with salt, and laid them one\r\non the other in the salt in the shells. He covered it over with a\r\nlayer of salt. He put over each shell the half of a larger one and\r\nweighted it down with stones. After a period of fourteen days he found\r\nthe meat quite red. It had pickled.\r\n\r\nBut he did not stop here. He gathered and stored in his cellar\r\ncocoanuts and corn in such quantities that he would be supplied for\r\na whole winter. It seemed best to catch a number of rabbits, build\r\na house for them and keep them. Then he could kill one occasionally\r\nand have fresh meat. Then it came to him that goats would be much better,\r\nfor they would give milk. He determined immediately to have a herd\r\nof goats. He made a string or lasso out of cocoa fibre.\r\n\r\nThen he went out, slipped up quietly to a herd of goats and threw the\r\nlasso over one. But the lasso slipped from the horns and the goat ran\r\naway. The next day he had better luck. He threw the lasso, drew it\r\ntight and the goat was captured. He brought it home. He rejoiced when\r\nhe saw that it gave milk. He was happy when he got his first cocoanut\r\nshell full of sweet rich milk. His goat herd grew. He soon had five\r\ngoats. He had no more room in his yard. He could not provide food\r\nenough. He must let them out. He must make another hedge around his\r\nyard so that the goats could get food and yet be kept from going away.\r\nHe got stakes from the woods and gathered them before his cave. He\r\nsharpened them and began to drive them in the earth. But it rained\r\nmore and more each day. He was wet through as he worked. He had\r\nfinally to stop work, for the rain was too heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S DIARY\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was much disturbed because he had no means of keeping a\r\nrecord of things as they happened from day to day. He had his\r\ncalendar, it is true. He would not lose track of the time. But he\r\nwished for some way to write down his thoughts and what happened. So\r\nhe kept up keen search for anything that would serve him for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nEvery time he journeyed about the island he kept careful watch for\r\nsomething that he might write upon. He thought of the leaves of the\r\npalm tree, the white under surface of the shelf fungus. But these he\r\nfound would not do. He tried many kinds of bark and leaves. There was\r\na kind of tall reed or grass growing in the marshes whose rind seemed\r\ngood when dried. He examined the inner bark of many trees. He at last\r\nfound that the inner bark of a tree which resembled our elm tree\r\nworked best. He would cut through the bark with his stone knife around\r\nthe tree. At about one foot from this he would cut another ring. He\r\nthen would cut through the bark lengthwise from one circular cut to\r\nthe other. He could then peel off the section easily. While it was\r\nyet full of sap he would separate the soft, tough, thin inner layer\r\nof the bark. This usually came off in sheets without a break. When\r\nthese sheets of bark were stretched and dried they could be used very\r\nnicely instead of paper.\r\n\r\nRobinson next searched for something that would serve him as ink, and\r\nthis was much easier to find than paper. He had noticed many kinds\r\nof galls of many different colors growing on trees. He did not know\r\nwhat they were, or how they grew, but he had learned in his father's\r\nstore that ink was often made from galls gathered from trees. \"Anyway,\"\r\nhe thought, \"I can get ink from the cuttle-fish.\" He had watched this\r\nanimal get away from its enemies by sending out a cloud of purplish\r\nfluid, in which to hide as it darted away. He had learned also that\r\nindigo is made from the leaves of a plant. He had noticed a plant\r\ngrowing in the open places in the forest whose leaves turned black\r\nwhen dried.\r\n\r\nRobinson gathered a quantity of gall-nuts and soaked them in water.\r\nTo the black fluid thus obtained he added a little rice water to make\r\nit flow well, and this served very well as an ink. He kept his ink\r\nin a cup made from a cocoanut shell.\r\n\r\nHe was not long in getting a pen, though the lack of a good sharp\r\nknife made it hard to make a good one. In going about he had gathered\r\na quantity of large feathers. He saved these for the time when he\r\nshould have his paper and ink ready. Now, he cut away a quill to a\r\npoint and split it up a little way. He was now supplied with writing\r\nmaterials. \"Is it not wonderful,\" he thought, \"how all our wants are\r\nfilled? We have only to want a thing badly enough and it comes.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson began at once to write down the date for each day and the\r\nmain thing he did or that happened on it. He called this his diary.\r\nHe had now a better way of keeping time than on his tree calendar.\r\nHe did not need it any more.\r\n\r\nYou have no doubt wondered how Robinson could work in his cave,\r\nespecially at night without a light. The truth is, it was a great\r\nsource of discomfort to him. At sunset he was in total darkness in\r\nhis cave. During the day light enough streamed in from the open doorway.\r\nTo be alone in total darkness is not pleasant. \"If I only had fire!\"\r\nhe said again and again.\r\n\r\nHe watched the many large beetles and fireflies flash their light in\r\nthe dark of the evening as he sat in front of his shelter. The thought\r\ncame to him that if he only had some way of keeping together a number\r\nof them, they would serve very well for a candle in his cave at night.\r\nHow he longed for a glass bottle such as he had so often wantonly\r\nbroken when at home! Back of his shelter there was a hill where the\r\nrock layers jutted out. He had noticed here several times the thin\r\ntransparent rock that he had seen in his father's store. It is called\r\nisinglass.\r\n\r\n\"I will make a living lantern,\" he said aloud in his eagerness.\r\n\r\nHe soon had a suitable piece pried loose. He cut a part of a cocoanut\r\nshell away and in its place he put a sheet of isinglass. That evening\r\nat dark he gathered several handfuls of the great fire beetles and\r\nput them in his lantern. What joy their glow gave him in his cave at\r\nnight. It was almost as much comfort as a companion. But while it\r\nlighted up the deep dark of the cave and enabled him to move about,\r\nhe was unable after all to write in his diary at night. Every morning\r\nhe set his captives free. In the evening he would go out and capture\r\nhis light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON IS SICK\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening Robinson went to bed sound and well. The next morning he\r\nwas sick. Before he had only the heat of the day to complain of.\r\nTo-day he was freezing. He wanted to go to work to get warm, but even\r\nthis did not break his chill. It increased till his teeth chattered\r\nwith the cold.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" thought he, \"if I can sleep a little I will get better.\"\r\nBut he could not sleep. He was burning with fever and then shaking\r\nwith cold by turns. He felt a strong thirst, but he was so weak that\r\nhe could scarcely get the goat's milk. He had no sooner drunk the milk\r\nthan his tongue was as dry as before. He felt better after a night\r\nof sleep, but the next day his fever and chills were worse than before.\r\nThen he bethought him of his parents. How kindly his mother had taken\r\ncare of him! Now no one was near that could assist him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he sighed, \"must I die here? Who would bury me? There is no one\r\nto miss me.\" At this the tears came to his eyes.\r\n\r\nHis sickness increased with each day. Occasionally the fever would\r\ngo down sufficiently to allow him to get something to eat. Then it\r\nwould be worse than before. In his dire need he wanted to pray, but\r\nhe was so weak that he could only stammer, \"Dear God, help me, or I\r\nshall die!\"\r\n\r\nOne night he had a strange dream. He thought he saw his good old\r\nfather standing before him calling to him. He spread out his arms and\r\ncried aloud, \"Here I am, here I am!\" He tried to get up, but he was\r\nso weak that he fell back fainting.\r\n\r\nHe lay there a long time, but finally came to. He felt a burning\r\nthirst, but no one reached him a drop of water. He prepared to die.\r\nHe folded his hands and prayed to God that he would be merciful to\r\nhim. He prayed forgiveness from his parents. Once more he raised his\r\nhead and gazed wildly around, then he sank back and knew no more.\r\n\r\nWhen he again awoke he felt better. His hot fever had gone. He\r\nattempted to walk. He had just enough strength to crawl to the table\r\nand fetch a shell of water. When he tried to walk he had to sit down\r\nat every two or three steps.\r\n\r\nFrom this he recovered gradually, growing better and better, and he\r\nthanked God inwardly for his recovery. His sickness had continued from\r\nJune 18 to July 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S BOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson's sickness set him thinking about his home. He had been so\r\nafraid of animals when he came to the island that he thought of\r\nnothing but protection from them. He had been now a year on the island\r\nand had seen nothing more dangerous than a goat. The fear of animals\r\nhad practically faded away. In thinking over his sickness he made up\r\nhis mind that it was caused by sleeping in his cave where the sun\r\nnever shone. The ventilation seemed good, but the walls were damp,\r\nespecially in the rainy season. Then the water would trickle down\r\nthrough the cleft in spite of all he could do.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to build, if possible, a little cottage, or, as he called\r\nit, a bower, in the yard in front of his shelter. The hedge of\r\nthistles was growing and formed a fence that an animal could not get\r\nthrough. His screen of willows on the outside of this would soon hide\r\nhim from view from the sea. He had the wall of rock and the hill\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHe planned out his way of building it very carefully. \"It must be\r\ndone,\" he said (Robinson formed the habit of talking to himself, so\r\nthat he would not forget how to talk), \"without hammer, nails, or\r\nsaw.\"\r\n\r\nHe first sought out four posts, as large as he could well handle.\r\nThere were always broken trees and branches in the forest. If he\r\nsearched long enough he could find posts just suited to his need. He\r\nwanted four of the same thickness and height and with a fork at the\r\nend. After long searching he found what he wanted. He was careful to\r\nget those that he could drag to his shelter.\r\n\r\nHe placed these in the ground, forming the corners of a square about\r\nten feet long. In the forks he placed poles running around about eight\r\nfeet from the ground. At about every three feet he fastened others,\r\nrunning in the same way, with heavy cords made of fibre. He found his\r\ngreatest trouble with the roof. It must be sloped to shed rain. He\r\nhad to find two more forked posts, three or four feet longer than the\r\nothers. These he placed opposite each other in the centers of two\r\nsides. Upon these he placed a ridge pole. He then laid other poles\r\nlengthwise from ridge pole to the edge of the frames.\r\n\r\nHis frame was now done. His plan was now to cover this frame with\r\nstraw or grasses tied in bundles. He had seen the barns in the country\r\nthatched in this way by the Dutch farmers in New York State. He\r\ngathered the straw of the wild rice. It was long, straight and tough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S BOWER]\r\n\r\nIt was easily tied into flat bundles. These he bound securely on to\r\nthe frame work with cords. He began at the bottom so that the ends\r\nof the row would lap over the tops of the last one put on.\r\n\r\nIn this way he built a very comfortable and rainproof bower. It was\r\neasy to make a bed of poles covered with straw. A table and bench were\r\nadded and shelves of poles.\r\n\r\nRobinson felt great joy over this new home. \"I will not now be sick\r\nany more,\" he said. \"In case of danger I can get into my cave. But\r\nat all other times I will live in my bower.\" He had use still for his\r\ncave. He could use it to store some things in. But he had to be\r\ncareful about the dampness in wet weather.\r\n\r\nRobinson was getting to feel at home. He was no longer so sad. He did\r\nnot grieve so much for home. He looked upon his home with great\r\ndelight It was secure. He had his herd of goats always in his sight.\r\nAt evening he would do his milking. He found he could keep the milk\r\nfor some time in the cave. He was tempted to try making some butter\r\nfrom the good, rich cream. \"But,\" said Robinson, \"I have neither\r\nvessels to make it in nor bread to eat it on.\"\r\n\r\nHe planned many things to do. \"I will make a hammock some day for my\r\nbower and some vessels to use in my work,\" he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nROBINSON AGAIN EXPLORES HIS ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Robinson recovered his strength he had a strong desire to see\r\nmore of the island. At first he had been in constant fear of wild\r\nanimals, but now he thought he would like to see all there was to see\r\nin the island. On the 15th of July he started out. First he went to\r\na brook which ran into the sea near his cave. Its water was clear and\r\npure; along its shore lay beautiful meadows. As he came to the upper\r\ncourse of the brook the meadow gave way to forest. On the border of\r\nthe forest he found melons and grapes.\r\n\r\nThe night came on and he slept again in a tree. The next morning he\r\nwent farther and came to a clear rivulet. Here the region was\r\nwonderfully beautiful. The flowers bloomed as in a garden, and near\r\nthe flowers stood splendid apple and orange trees. He took as much\r\nof the fruit as he could carry and went on his way. This journey\r\ncontinued three days. The grapes which he had carried he dried in the\r\nsun and made raisins.\r\n\r\nThe 10th of September came, one year had passed on the island. He was\r\nmany hundred miles from home, alone on an island. With tears he cried\r\nout, \"Ah! what are my dear parents saying? They have no doubt long\r\ngiven me up as dead. If I could only send them a message to comfort\r\nthem and let them know how much I love them!\"\r\n\r\nThe day was celebrated as a holiday. He thanked God that He had given\r\nhim so many good things. Often he had lived the whole day in care and\r\nanxiety. Now he tried to be more cheerful and to meet the troubles\r\nof each day with courage.\r\n\r\nBut Robinson was not yet satisfied. He longed to know more of the\r\nisland and prepared himself for a greater journey. He slung his\r\nhunting pouch over his shoulder, filled it full of food, took his bow\r\nand arrows, stuck his stone hatchet in his belt and started on his\r\nway. He traveled over meadows, through beautiful forests in which were\r\nhundreds of birds. He was delighted as they sang and fluttered about.\r\n\r\nThe journey was beautiful and pleasant to Robinson. In the forests\r\nhe often saw small wild creatures, but he shot nothing. After the first\r\nnight he slept under a tree in the soft grass, for he had now no fear\r\nof wild animals.\r\n\r\nAlong the shore he saw great groves of palms with their large nuts.\r\nHe saw, too, many goats in all parts of the island.\r\n\r\nNow he was ready to take the shortest way home. He had not gone far\r\nbefore he came into a dark forest. He became confused and wandered\r\nabout for several days. On the fourth day he came to a little pile\r\nof stones, which he had made to mark the way as he was going out. From\r\nthis place the way was easy to find. On this trip he was gone already\r\ntwo weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nROBINSON AND HIS BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the things he saw on his journey Robinson was most delighted\r\nwith the birds. They were of the most beautiful colors. The forest\r\nwas full of them. They gleamed like jewels in the deep masses of foliage.\r\nIn the morning their singing filled the air with sound.\r\n\r\nRobinson had never taken much notice of the birds at home. But now\r\nevery living thing attracted him. He loved to see them happy. He would\r\nwatch often by the hour and learn the habits of nesting and getting\r\nfood of nearly every bird on the island.\r\n\r\nRobinson did not know the names of many of the birds he saw on the\r\nisland. He had to make names for them. The strangest thing he saw on\r\nhis journey was the nest of what he called the yellow-tail. This bird\r\nlives in colonies and makes its nest at the ends of the long leaves\r\nof the mountain palm. When he first saw these queer looking sacks hanging\r\nfrom the leaves he was amazed. He had never seen so strange a sight.\r\nFrom the end of each great leaf hung a long, closely woven nest.\r\nRobinson could not make out at first what they were. Soon, however,\r\nhe saw the birds come out of the mouths of the nests. Here, one hundred\r\nfeet from the ground, they hung their nests. But they were perfectly\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far from the tree in which the yellow tails had their\r\nnests when he was suddenly startled by a voice crying, \"Who, who are\r\nyou?\" Robinson was greatly frightened and hid beneath the drooping\r\nbranches of a cedar tree. He feared every moment that the owner of\r\nthe voice would make his appearance. But it kept at a distance. Every\r\nfew minutes from the depths of the forest would come the doleful cry,\r\n\"Who, who are you?\" Robinson did not dare to stir from his hiding\r\nplace. He remained there over night. After the night came on he heard\r\nthe strange voice no more.\r\n\r\nThe next day he renewed his journey. He saw many birds that were\r\nwholly strange to him. There was a kind of wild pigeon that built its\r\nhome in a hole in the rock. It was a most beautiful bird with long,\r\nslender, graceful feathers in its tail. He saw the frigate bird\r\nsoaring high above the island. The number and beauty of the\r\nhumming-birds amazed Robinson. They were of all colors. One had a bill\r\nin the shape of a sickle. The most brilliant of them all was the\r\nruby-crested hummingbird.\r\n\r\nNear noon, while Robinson was shielding himself from the scorching\r\nheat of the sun in a deep, shaded glen, he was startled again by the\r\nstrange voice crying, \"Who, who, who are you?\" He lay quite still,\r\ndetermined if possible to allow the voice to come, if it would, within\r\nsight. He heard it slowly coming up the glen. Each time it repeated\r\nthe cry it sounded nearer. At last he saw spying at him through the\r\nboughs of the tree under which he was lying a large bird with soft,\r\nsilky feathers of green and chestnut. \"Who, who, who are you?\" said\r\nthe bird. Robinson could not help but laugh. He had been frightened\r\nat the cry of a bird.\r\n\r\nBut the bird that interested Robinson most was the parrot. There were\r\nseveral kinds of them. They flew among the trees with great noise and\r\nclatter and shrieking. Robinson determined if possible to secure one\r\nfor a pet. \"I can teach it to talk,\" he said, \"and I will have\r\nsomething to talk to.\"' As soon as he returned home he set about\r\ncatching one. He noticed that a number were in the habit of visiting\r\nan old tree near the shelter every morning. He planned to snare one\r\nand tried several mornings, but he could not get one into the snare.\r\nHe tried to hit one with his bow and arrow. He at last succeeded in\r\nhitting one and stunning it so that it fell to the ground. He ran\r\nrapidly to pick it up, but before he could get to where it lay in the\r\nbushes it had disappeared.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking the matter over he concluded that it would be much\r\nbetter to get a pair of young birds and raise them. The old ones would\r\nbe hard to tame and difficult to teach. It was easy enough to find\r\na nest in a hollow tree. He secured from the nest two birds just ready\r\nto fly. He made a cage for them out of willow rods. He placed the cage\r\nat the entrance of his cave and studied how he would feed them. Much\r\nto his surprise the parent birds discovered their young ones and\r\nbrought them food and fed them through the open work of the cage.\r\n\r\nWhen the birds were grown they rapidly learned to talk. Robinson took\r\ngreat delight in teaching them. He taught them to call his name and\r\nwhen he came near they would call out, \"Poor old Robinson Crusoe!\"\r\n\r\nThese birds remained for many years with Robinson. In fact, he was\r\nnever afterward without a parrot. They helped him to pass away very\r\npleasantly many hours that without them would have been sad.\r\n\r\nAnother bird that Robinson loved was the little house wren. This bird\r\nwas exceedingly tame and friendly. It was a very sweet and strong\r\nsinger. It loved to make its nest in or near his shelter. There it\r\nwould build and rear its young, within reach of his hands, while its\r\nthroat was always bursting with melody.\r\n\r\nThe mocking bird, too, always nested near and awakened him in the\r\nmorning with its wonderful song.\r\n\r\nRobinson became a great friend and favorite of the bird inhabitants\r\nof the island. They seemed to know him and showed no fear when near\r\nhim. This pleased him very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nROBINSON GETS FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was now pretty comfortable. He had his bower with its chair\r\nand table. He had his cave in case of danger. He had his cellar in\r\nwhich to keep his meat. He would sit in the shade near the door of\r\nhis bower and think of the many things he should be thankful for. But\r\nthere was one hardship that Robinson could not get used to and that\r\nwas the eating of raw food. \"How fine it would be if only I could\r\nparch a few grains of corn in the fire! I could like live a prince,\"\r\nthought he, \"if I had fire. I would grind some of my corn into flour\r\nand make some corn bread or cakes and cook rice.\" He did so long for\r\nroasted meat and determined again to make the attempt to get fire.\r\n\r\nRobinson was fast losing his idle, thoughtless ways of doing things.\r\nHe had become a thoughtful and diligent man in the short time that\r\nhe had been on the island. Trouble and hardship had made a man of him.\r\n\"I must carefully think over the whole matter of getting fire,\" he\r\nsaid. He had failed twice and was now resolved to succeed. \"If the\r\nlightning would only strike a tree,\" he thought, \"and set it on fire.\"\r\n\r\nBut he could not wait for such a thing to happen, and how could he\r\nkeep it when once thus obtained? It was clear he must have some way\r\nof producing fire when he wanted it, just as they did at home? He thought\r\nover the ways he had tried and the one most likely to be successful.\r\nHe resolved to make a further trial of the method by twirling a stick\r\nin his hands. He selected new wood that was hard and dry. He carefully\r\nsharpened a stick about eighteen inches long and, standing it upright\r\nin a hollow in the block of wood, began to roll it between his hands.\r\nBy the time Robinson's hands were well hardened, it seemed that he\r\nwas going to succeed at last. But he lacked the skill to be obtained\r\nonly by long practice.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only make it go faster,\" he said. \"There must be some way\r\nof doing this. I believe I can do it. I used to make my top spin round\r\nwith a cord; I wonder if I can use the cord here.\" The only cord he\r\nhad was attached to his bow. He was going to take it off when a\r\nthought struck him. He loosened the string a bit and twisted it once\r\nabout his spindle. Then he drew the bow back and forth. The spindle\r\nwas turned at a great rate. He saw he must hold one end with his left\r\nhand while the other rested in the hollow in the block. With his\r\nright, he drew the bow back and forth. How eagerly he worked! He had\r\ntwirled but a few minutes when the dust in the hollow burst into fire\r\nfrom the heat produced by the rapidly twirling spindle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S TOOLS FOR MAKING FIRE]\r\n\r\nRobinson was too overjoyed to make any use of it. He danced and\r\ncapered about like one gone mad until the fire had gone out. But that\r\nwas of no matter now, since he could get fire when he wanted it.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to make him a rude fireplace and oven of stones. He\r\nhollowed out a place in the ground and lined and covered it with large\r\nflat stones. On one side he built up a chimney to draw up the smoke\r\nand make the fire burn brightly. He brought wood and some dry fungus\r\nor mushroom. This he powdered and soon had fire caught in it. He\r\nkindled in this way the wood in his stove and soon had a hot fire.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did in the way of cooking was to roast some rabbit\r\nmeat on a spit or forked stick held in his hand over the fire. Nothing\r\nRobinson had ever eaten was to be compared to this.\r\n\r\n\"I can do many things now,\" thought Robinson. \"My work will not be\r\nnearly so hard. My fire will be my servant and help me make my tools\r\nas well as cook my food. I can now cook my corn and rice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES BASKETS\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson still continued anxious about his food supply when he could\r\nno longer gather it fresh from the fields and forest. Corn had again\r\nbecome ripe. He had found in a wet, marshy place some wild rice-plants\r\nloaded with ripened grain. As he now had fire he only had to have some\r\nway of storing up grains and he would not lack for food. He knew that\r\ngrain stored away must be kept dry and that he must especially provide\r\nagainst dampness in his cave or in his bower.\r\n\r\nIf he only had some baskets. These would be just the thing. But how\r\nwas he to get them? Robinson had never given a thought to either\r\nmaterial or the method of making them. He, however, was gradually\r\nacquiring skill and confidence in himself. So far he had managed to\r\nmeet all his wants. He had invented tools and made his own clothes\r\nand shelter, and, \"Now,\" said he to himself, \"I will solve the new\r\nproblem. I must first study the materials that I have at hand.\" He\r\nremembered the splint market baskets in which his father took\r\nvegetables home from the store. He recalled how the thin splints were\r\nwoven.\r\n\r\n\"They went over and under,\" he said. \"That is simple enough if I had\r\nthe splints.\" He set himself diligently to work to find a plant whose\r\nbark or split branches could be used for splints. He tried to peel\r\noff the rough outer bark of several trees in order to examine the inner\r\nlayers of soft fibrous material. He found several trees that gave\r\npromise of furnishing abundance of long, thin strips, but the labor\r\nof removing the bark with his rude imperfect tools was so great that\r\nhe resolved that he would have to find some other kind of material.\r\n\r\n\"Why need the strips be flat?\" he thought. \"I believe I could weave\r\nthem in the same way if I used the long, thin, tough willow rods I\r\nsaw growing by the brookside, when I was returning from my journey.\"\r\n\r\nHe found on trial that the weaving went very well, but that he must\r\nhave strong, thick rods or ribs running up and down to give strength\r\nand form to his basket. He worked hard, but it was slow work. It was\r\nthree days before his first basket was done. He made many mistakes\r\nand was obliged many times to undo what he had accomplished in order\r\nto correct some error. And at last when he had woven the basket as\r\nlarge as he thought was suitable for his purpose, he did not know how\r\nto stop or finish the top so as to keep the basket from unraveling.\r\nAt last he hit upon the plan of fastening two stout rods, one outside,\r\nthe other inside, the basket. These he sewed firmly, over and over,\r\nto the basket with a kind of fibre from a plant he had discovered that\r\nlooked almost to be what he had heard called the century plant in the\r\nparks at home.\r\n\r\nOn attempting his next basket, he thought long how he might improve\r\nand save time. He must hasten, or the now almost daily rains would\r\ndestroy his ripened wild corn and rice.\r\n\r\n\"If I could use coils of that long grass I saw growing in the marsh\r\nbeside the rice,\" he thought, \"I could make twice the progress.\" He\r\ngathered an armful, twisted it into cables about an inch thick and\r\nwove it into his frame of upright rods instead of the horizontal layer\r\nof willow canes. This answered his purpose just as well and rendered\r\nthe making of large baskets the work of a few hours. He found,\r\nhowever, that the willow rods or osiers were not pliant enough to work\r\nwell in fastening his coils of grass cables together. He tried several\r\nthings and at last succeeded best when he used the long thread-like\r\nfibre of the century-like plant. He had, however, to make a stout\r\nframework of rods. He would first coil his grass rope into this frame\r\nand then sew it together with twine or thread made from this fibre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S BASKETS]\r\n\r\nHe afterwards tried making smaller and finer baskets out of the fibre\r\nthat he had discovered, which could be easily had from the\r\nthick-leaved plant he thought he had seen at home. He first used long,\r\ntough, fine roots he had seen when digging up the tree at the mouth\r\nof his cave. Afterwards he discovered some tall, tough reeds growing\r\nnear by. He laid in a supply of these. He found that when he wanted\r\nto use them, a good soaking in water made them as pliable and tough\r\nas when first cut.\r\n\r\nThe making of the baskets and storing up grains made it possible for\r\nRobinson to become a farmer and thus make himself independent. This\r\nthought was a great relief to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nROBINSON BECOMES A FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson had now been on the island long enough to know how the\r\nseasons changed. He found that there were two kinds of weather there,\r\nwet weather and dry weather. There were two wet seasons in each year\r\nand two dry ones. During the wet seasons, which lasted nearly three\r\nmonths, Robinson had to remain pretty closely at home, and could not\r\ngather grain, for the plants were then starting from the seeds. It\r\nripened in the dry seasons. Robinson soon found that he must have a\r\nstore of corn and wild rice for food during the rainy seasons. He,\r\nhowever, knew nothing about planting and harvesting, nor preparing\r\nthe ground for seed.\r\n\r\nHe had it all to learn with no teacher or books to instruct him. He\r\nfound a little space near his dwelling free from trees and thought\r\nhe would plant some corn seed here. He did not know the proper time\r\nfor planting. He thought because it was warm, seed would grow at any\r\ntime. It happened his first seed was put in at the beginning of the\r\ndry season. He watched and waited to rejoice his eyes with the bright\r\ngreen of sprouting corn, but the seed did not grow. There was no rain\r\nand the sun's heat parched the land till it was dry and hard on the\r\nupland where his corn was planted.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" thought Robinson, \"I will plant it at the beginning of\r\nthe wet season, either in March or September.\" He did so; the seed\r\nquickly sprouted up. But the weeds, shrubs, and vines sprouted as\r\nquickly, and before Robinson was aware, his corn was overgrown and\r\nchoked out by a rank growth of weeds and vines.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Robinson, \"that I must thoroughly prepare the soil\r\nbefore planting my seed.\" But he had no spade and no other tool that\r\nwould stand the strain of digging among tough matted roots. But he\r\nmust succeed. He put a new handle in the stone hoe or pick he had\r\nalready made. His mussel shell spade was worn out. He must set himself\r\nto fashion out another. He decided to make one from the tough heavy\r\nwood of a tree that grew plentifully in the forest.\r\n\r\nHe was lucky enough to find a tree of this kind whose bole had been\r\nsplit lengthwise by the falling of an old rotten tree near it. With\r\nhis stone tools and the help of fire he managed after several days'\r\nwork to make a wide sharpened tool out of one of the large pieces\r\nsplit off. It was a little over three feet long. He had trimmed one\r\nend small and cut notches in the sides about one foot from the flat\r\nend. He could place his foot in the notch and thrust his wooden spade\r\ninto the earth. With his rude tool he dug up and turned the soil of\r\na small space of ground several times to kill the vines and weeds.\r\nHis corn quickly sprouted after this attempt and outstripped the weeds\r\nand vines which Robinson constantly had to hold in check by pulling\r\nand hoeing. He was rejoiced at his growing crop and went each morning\r\nto feast his eyes on the rapidly expanding leaves and ears.\r\n\r\nOne morning as he came in sight of the little clearing he thought he\r\nsaw something disappearing in the low brush on the other side as he\r\napproached. Alas, his labor had been in vain! A herd of wild goats\r\nhad found out the place and had utterly destroyed his crop. Robinson\r\nsat down nearby and surveyed the ruin of his little field. \"It is plain,\"\r\nthought he, \"I will have to fence in the field or I will never be able\r\nto harvest my crop. I cannot watch it all the time.\"\r\n\r\nHe had already learned from his experience in making the fence around\r\nthe goat pasture that the branches of many kinds of shrubs and trees,\r\nwhen broken off and thrust into the ground, will send out roots and\r\nleaves and at length if planted close together in a line, will form\r\na thick hedge which no kind of beast can get through or over. He found\r\nout some willow trees whose branches broke easily, and soon had enough\r\nto thrust into the ground about six inches apart around the entire\r\nedge of his little field, which contained about one eighth of an acre.\r\n\r\nAfter this hedge had grown so as to be a fair protection to his crop\r\nhe tried planting again at the proper season. He spaded up the ground\r\nand pulled out the matted roots as best he could and with great pains\r\nand care planted his corn in straight even rows. To make them straight\r\nand each hill of corn the same distance from its neighbors, he first\r\nmarked off the ground in squares whose sides were about three and one\r\nhalf feet long.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" thought he, \"I will reap the reward of my labor.\" The corn grew\r\nrapidly, and toward the end of the first dry season was filling out\r\nand ripening its ears. But to Robinson's dismay a new danger\r\nthreatened his crop against which he could not fence. He was in\r\ndespair. The birds were fast eating and destroying his partially\r\nripened corn. He could not husk it yet. It was not ripe enough. He\r\nthought how easy it would be to protect his field if he had a gun.\r\nBut he had learned that it is useless to give time to idle dreaming.\r\nHe must do something and that quick.\r\n\r\n\"If I could catch some of these rascals,\" he thought, \"I would hang\r\nthem up on poles, dead, as a warning to the rest.\" It seemed almost\r\na hopeless task, but he went about it. It was in vain he tried to kill\r\nsome of them by throwing rocks and sticks. He could not get near\r\nenough to them. At length he laid snares and succeeded in snaring\r\nthree birds. He had learned to weave a pliable, strong thong out of\r\ncocoa and other fibre that he was now acquainted with. The birds thus\r\ncaught he fastened on broken branches of trees which he stuck into\r\nthe earth in different parts of his field. The birds heeded the warning\r\nand visited his corn field no more that season.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the season he gathered or husked his corn and after it\r\nwas thoroughly dry he shelled it from the cob with his hands. He used\r\nhis baskets in which to carry his husked ears from the field to his\r\ncave and in which to store it when shelled. He found that the ears\r\nwere larger and better filled and plumper than when the plants grew\r\nwild. He selected the largest and best filled ears for his seed the\r\nnext time. In this way his new crop of corn was always better in kind\r\nand yielded more than the old one.\r\n\r\nAt first he grew two crops a year, but by experimenting he found out\r\nabout how much he needed for his own use and planted once a year\r\nenough to give him a liberal supply.\r\n\r\nHe observed that the wild rice grew in swampy lands, so that he did\r\nnot make the mistake of trying to raise it upon the upland where the\r\ncorn grew best. He saw at once that the planting of rice on low,\r\nmarshy or wet land was beyond his present strength and tools. \"Some\r\ntime in the future,\" he thought, \"I may try it.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson also found wild grapes in abundance. These he dried by\r\nhanging them on the branches of trees. He thus had a store of raisins\r\nfor each rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS POTTER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was now anxious to cook his food, to boil his rice and\r\nvegetables and bake bread, but he could do nothing without cooking\r\nvessels. He had tried to use cocoanut shells, but these were too small\r\nand there was no way to keep them from falling over and spilling the\r\ncontents. He determined to try to make some clay vessels. He knew\r\nwhere he could get a kind of clay that had the appearance of making\r\ngood ware. It was fine grained and without lumps or pebbles. He was\r\nmuch perplexed to mould the clay into right shapes. He tried taking\r\na lump and shaping it into a vessel with his hands. He tried many times,\r\nbut each time the clay broke and he was forced to try some other way.\r\nHe recalled how he had made his basket out of strands of twisted grass\r\nand wondered whether he could not make his pots in the same way.\r\n\r\nHe spun the clay out into a long rope and began to coil it around a\r\nsmall basket forming the layers together with his hands. This was\r\neasy, but he did not see clearly how he was going to get the basket\r\nout from the inside of the pot. He found he could copy in this way\r\nany form he wished, but he finally hit upon the plan of making a form\r\nof wicker work and coiling the clay rope inside it, for he saw that\r\nwhether he succeeded or not in getting the clay free from the basket\r\nhe could use the pot, and besides if the pot would stand the fire the\r\nbasket would burn off. To dry the pots Robinson stood them in the sun\r\na few days. When they were dry he tried to cook some soup in one of\r\nthem. He filled it with water and put it on his stove or oven, but\r\nhow sadly had he deceived himself. In a short time the water soaked\r\ninto the clay and soon the pot had fallen to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"How foolish I am!\" said Robinson to himself; \"the pots have to be\r\nfired before they can be used.\" He set about this at once. He found\r\ntwo stones of equal size, placed them near each other and laid a third\r\nacross these. He then placed three large pots upon them and made a\r\nhot fire under them. No sooner had the flame shot up than one of the\r\npots cracked in two. \"I probably made the fire too hot at first,\" thought\r\nRobinson.\r\n\r\nHe drew out some of the coals and wood, but afterwards gradually\r\nincreased the fire again. He could not, however, get the pots hot\r\nenough to turn red He brought the dryest and hardest wood, but could\r\nnot succeed in getting them hot enough to turn red. At length he was\r\ntired out and was compelled to give it up. When the pots were cool\r\nhe tried to boil water in one. It was no better than the sun dried\r\none. He saw that he must provide some way to get the pots much hotter\r\nthan he could in the open air He resolved to make an oven of stones\r\nlarge enough to take in the wood as well as the pots. It must be above\r\nground so that there might be plenty of draught for the fire. With\r\ngreat labor, he pried up and carried together flat stones enough to\r\nmake an oven about four feet high with a chimney at one side. He had\r\nput in the center a stone table on which he could place three quite\r\nlarge pots. He left an opening in one side that could be partially\r\nclosed by a large, flat stone.\r\n\r\nHe worked eagerly and at the end of the second day he was ready to\r\nfire his oven. He first carried together a good quantity of dry wood,\r\nthen he put in his pots and laid the wood around them. In a short time\r\nhe had a very hot fire. He kept this up all day and until late at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he went to his oven and found his pots were a\r\nbeautiful red. He drew out the fire and allowed them to cool slowly.\r\nThen he filled one with water and set it over the fire to heat it.\r\nBefore many minutes the water was boiling and Robinson had another\r\nreason to be thankful. He wept for joy. His patient labors had brought\r\ntheir rewards. No prince could feel as happy as Robinson now. He had\r\novercome all difficulties. Starting with nothing but his hands, he\r\nwas now able to supply all his wants. \"If I only had a companion now,\"\r\nhe thought, \"I would have nothing further to wish as long as I stay\r\non the island.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME OF ROBINSON'S DISHES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS BAKER\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that Robinson had fire, he determined to try to make bread. He\r\nhad seen the servants at home make bread many times, but he had not\r\nobserved closely and knew next to nothing about the way bread is made.\r\nHe knew he must in some way grind the corn into flour, but how could\r\nhe do this? He had no mill nor any tools with which to crush the corn.\r\n\r\nHe first tried to find a stone large and hard enough out of which he\r\nmight hollow a vessel or kind of mortar. He thought he could put the\r\ncorn into this mortar and grind it by means of another stone or\r\npestle. It was with great difficulty that he could get a stone of\r\nsuitable size and form. After several days' trial he at last got one\r\ncut out from some layers of rock near the shore. He made a hollow\r\nplace in it. Then he took a smaller oblong shaped rock for his pestle.\r\n\r\nHe took great pride in these new tools. \"I shall soon be a\r\nstone-cutter,\" he said to himself, \"as well as a farmer and potter.\"\r\nBut his stone mortar was a failure. The rock was too soft. Every time\r\nhe thrust the pestle down, it loosened small pieces of the stone\r\nvessel. These mixed with the ground corn or flour and made it unfit\r\nto eat. There was no way to separate the sand from the crushed grain.\r\n\r\nHe resolved then to try to make a mortar and pestle of hard wood. Now\r\nthat he had fire, he could do this, though it cost him many a hard\r\nday's work. He found not far away a log of very hard wood. By building\r\na fire at the right distance from one end he was able to separate a\r\npiece of the log. He rolled this to his cave and made a good-sized\r\nhollow in it by burning. This pestle was not so difficult to make.\r\nHe took a limb or branch of an ironwood tree, burned it in two at the\r\nplace to make it the right length. By burning also he rounded one end\r\nand then he was ready for the grinding. After cleaning his mortar and\r\npestle carefully he placed some corn in the hollow and soon had some\r\nfine yellow meal or flour without any grit or sand in it.\r\n\r\nHis next care was to separate the coarse outer husk or covering of\r\nthe kernel from the finer parts that make the meal. He had no sieve.\r\nHis net was too coarse. It let both bran and meal go through. \"I must\r\nmake a net or cloth fine enough to sift or bolt my flour,\" said he.\r\nSuch was now his skill in spinning and weaving that this was not hard\r\nto do. He had soon woven in his loom a piece of fine netting which\r\nallowed the meal to shake through, but held back the coarse bran or\r\nouter husk of the kernel. Out of the dry corn that he had stored up\r\nhe now made quite a quantity of flour. This he kept tightly covered\r\nin a large earthen pot or jar that he had made for this purpose. \"I\r\nmust keep all my food clean and protect it from the ants and other\r\ninsects as well as dust and damp,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nHis preparations were now nearly made. He had already his stove of\r\nflat stones. On this he could set his pots to boil water, cook rice,\r\nand meat, but it would not do for baking a loaf of bread of any\r\nthickness. He must have an oven or enclosed place into which he could\r\nput the loaf to bake it. By the use of flat stones he soon rebuilt\r\nhis stove so as to have an oven that did fine service. Now it was mixing\r\nthe dough that claimed his attention. He had of course no yeast to\r\nmake raised or light bread. He poured goats' milk on the flour and\r\nkneaded it into a thick dough. He did not forget to add salt. He\r\nplaced his loaf in a shallow earthen pan he had made for this purpose.\r\nAfter the fire had heated the stones of his oven through, he put in\r\nhis loaf and soon was enjoying a meal of corn bread and meat stew.\r\n\r\nRobinson soon tried to make cocoa from the beans of the cocoa palm\r\nthat grew in the island. This with good rich goats' milk in it he\r\nthought the best drink in the world. He often thought of making sugar\r\nfrom the sugar cane plant he had discovered in the island. But the\r\nlabor of squeezing out the juice was too great. He could think of no\r\nway to do this without the help of horses or oxen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS FISHERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was now eager to use his fire and cooking vessels. He had\r\nnoticed with hungry eyes fine large fish in the creek near his cave.\r\nBut he had never taken the trouble to catch any. \"What is the use?\"\r\nhe thought. \"I cannot eat them raw.\" It was different now and he began\r\nto devise ways of making a catch. How he longed for a fish-hook, such\r\nas he had so often used when loitering along the Hudson River! \"But\r\na fish-hook is not to be thought of,\" he said to himself, \"unless I\r\ncan make one of bone.\" He went down to the brook and searched long\r\nfor a fish-bone that he might make use of for this purpose. He found\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"I must try something else,\" he thought. He remembered the nets he\r\nused to see along the Hudson and wondered if he could not make a small\r\none to pull through the water and thus catch the fish.\r\n\r\nHe had now a better source of fibre for weaving and for spinning into\r\nlines and ropes. He had discovered this when he was trying to find\r\na good strong thread or yarn with which to bind the coils of his\r\ngrass-made baskets together. He obtained fibre in great abundance from\r\nthe century-like plant. He found if he broke off the long leaves of\r\nthis plant and allowed them to decay there remained a long, tough\r\nfibrous substance out of which strong cords could be twisted or yarn\r\nmade for weaving a coarse cloth or netting.\r\n\r\nOut of this he spun yarn thread to make a net about three or four feet\r\nby two feet. He fastened cords to four corners of this, tied them to\r\na long pole, and was now prepared to test his plan for catching fish.\r\n\r\nThe brook he found was too shallow for him to catch fish in this way.\r\nAt the sight of him and his net, they scurried away to deep water.\r\nNeither could he succeed in the shallow water along the shore. \"I must\r\nwade out as far as I can,\" he said to himself, \"and draw the net\r\nthrough the water.\"\r\n\r\nAs he did this he was surprised at the many forms of sea life, new\r\nto him, that he saw. He, however, was careful and watchful. He walked\r\nalong near the shore to a point where some, rocks showed above the\r\nsurface. As he looked ahead he saw the single eye of a giant\r\ncuttle-fish glaring at him from among the rocks. It was thrusting out\r\nits long arms towards him. He drew back quickly, but as he did so he\r\nwas terrified to hear the snap of some huge creature's jaws near him.\r\nA great shark had seen him and had thrown himself on his back to seize\r\nhim in his rows of sharp teeth, but was prevented reaching him by the\r\nshallowness of the water.\r\n\r\nRobinson was too much terrified to continue longer his attempt at\r\nfishing. He went back to his cave with only a few small ones, not\r\nworth the trouble of dressing for his dinner.\r\n\r\nThe next day undismayed he tried again. He succeeded in drawing in\r\nsome very beautiful large fish. Their sides shone as burnished gold\r\nand silver. \"Now,\" he thought, \"I will have a feast.\" He carried them\r\nhome, carefully cleaned and dressed them, seasoned them with his salt,\r\nand broiled them over his fire. Imagine his disappointment when they\r\nproved unfit to eat. Their flesh was coarse and tough and ill-tasting.\r\nHe saw that the catching of fish for his table was a more difficult\r\nthing than he thought it. He must not only catch fish, but catch ones\r\nthat could be eaten. He could only tell the good from the bad by\r\ntrying them.\r\n\r\nHe was more fortunate in his next venture. He was going along the\r\nshore at the mouth of the creek which ran near his cave when he\r\nnoticed a group of fishes, dark bluish above with silvery sides. The\r\nlargest of them were about two feet long. They were feeding on the\r\nbottom in the brackish water at the mouth of the creek, which at its\r\nmouth opened out into quite a little bay or inlet. They would take\r\nup a mouthful of earth from the bottom and let it wash through their\r\nmouths, keeping all the bits of food that happened to be in it. When\r\none fish got a good place to feed the others swam around it and tried\r\nto get some of the food.\r\n\r\nRobinson watched his chance and slipped his net under a group, while\r\neach one was busy trying to get the best mouthful of mud. He drew up\r\nthree quite large fish, but just as he was about to lift them from\r\nthe water, one of the cords which bound the net to the poles broke\r\nand he saw his catch fall back into the creek and dart away in the\r\ndeepest water. But Robinson was not to be discouraged. He soon mended\r\nhis net and at last was successful. In a short time he drew out another\r\ncatch of two fish.\r\n\r\nThese proved excellent food and were so abundant as to furnish\r\nRobinson with all the fish he wanted as long as he stayed on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON BUILDS A BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson had wished for a boat many times. He wished to explore the\r\nshore of his island. He wanted to go clear around it so that he might\r\nsee it on every side. But he knew the work of making a boat would be\r\ngreat, if not wholly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe shaping of boards to build a boat with his rude tools was not to\r\nbe thought of. He knew how the Indians made boats out of bark of\r\ntrees. But he saw that for his purpose so light a boat would not do.\r\nHe finally remembered a second Indian way of making a boat by\r\nhollowing out a large log. The forest was full of the boles of trees\r\nthat had been blown down. But they were far away from the shore. At\r\nfirst he did not think of this very much. He had overcome so many\r\ndifficulties that he thought, \"Never mind, I will get my boat to\r\nwater, no matter where I make it, in some way.\" So he selected a tree\r\ntrunk some distance from the bank of the little creek near his cave\r\nand began work.\r\n\r\nHe had first to burn out his log the proper length and hack it into\r\nboat shape with his stone tools. This was very slow and tedious work.\r\nHe had to handle the fire with great care for there was always the\r\ndanger of spoiling the shape of the slowly forming boat. Both ends\r\nmust be sharpened, but one more than the other to form the prow or\r\nforward going end. After he had shaped his boat, he began hollowing\r\nit out. This he did also by burning for the most part. He used the\r\nbranches of pitch bearing trees for this purpose. But it was so slow.\r\nHe worked at his boat all the time he could spare from his regular\r\nduties in attending to his goats, his garden and his cave. He was\r\nalways making his cave larger. Every time he made a piece of furniture\r\nor stored away grain he must make more room in his cave by digging\r\naway the earth and carrying it out. He had made a large strong wicker\r\nbasket for this purpose.\r\n\r\nHe had had a vague idea that when he got his boat done he would dig\r\na trench back from the bank of the creek and thus float his boat. But\r\nhe had not thought it out clearly. \"Or anyway,\" he thought, \"I can\r\nin some way manage to roll it to the water.\" He must now actually plan\r\nto put some of these ideas into effect. He first went over the ground\r\nand found that to dig a trench from the water to the boat, so that\r\nthe water would come to the boat, he would have to dig it twenty feet\r\ndeep. \"I can never do this,\" he said, \"with my poor tools.\"\r\n\r\nHe next tried his rolling plan. But he had been so anxious to have\r\na large boat that he had overlooked everything else. Try as hard as\r\nhe might he could not stir his boat from the spot. After many trials\r\nwith the longest levers he could handle, the boat still stuck fast.\r\nIt would not budge an inch. He at last gave it up. \"It will lie here,\"\r\nhe thought, \"to remind me how foolish it is to attempt to do anything\r\nwithout first having thought it out carefully.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but to choose another tree trunk. This time\r\nhe selected a much smaller one, and one that lay at the top of the\r\nlittle slope or incline from the bank of the creek. After another weary\r\nsix months of work he had his second boat ready for launching. With\r\na good stout lever he gave it a start, when it rolled quickly down\r\ninto the water. Robinson again wept for joy. Of all his projects this\r\nhad cost him the most work and pains and at last to see his plans\r\nsuccessful filled him with delight.\r\n\r\nThe next problem was how to make it go. He had no certain knowledge\r\nhow far it was around the island, but he knew it was farther than he\r\nwanted to row or paddle his boat. Yet he knew from the way the wind\r\nblew that he could not always depend upon a sail to help him. He must\r\nbecome skillful in paddling his boat. A sail too would be very helpful\r\nat times. He imagined how pleasant it would be sitting in the boat\r\nsailing along with a gentle wind. \"When the wind is favorable,\" he\r\nthought, \"I will only have to steer with my paddle.\"\r\n\r\nSo he set about weaving a sail of his sisal fibre. To do this he had\r\nto make a much larger loom than he had yet used. His sail must be at\r\nleast four feet square. He was now so skilled in weaving that this\r\nwas soon finished. He then made plenty of string, cord, and rope, put\r\nin a mast and was ready to sail. But he did not venture far away until\r\nhe had spent weeks and weeks in learning to steer, sail, and paddle\r\nhis boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS A SAILOR\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since Robinson had finished his boat he had been eager to make\r\na tour of his island. He had indeed made a journey by land. But the\r\ndeep forests and tangled vines made it very difficult to travel. His\r\njourneys had shown him but a small part of the land. He wished to know\r\nall about the land of which he, so far as he knew, was the sole\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nHis first care was to fit up his boat with provisions. He made some\r\nlarge baskets in which to carry food and a large covered jar for\r\nwater. These he stored in the bow and the stern of his boat. He\r\nfastened his parasol on the stern for a shelter from the sun. He baked\r\nup a quantity of cakes or loaves of bread and packed them in his\r\nbaskets. He had woven these so carefully that they would almost hold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt last all was ready. It was on the sixth day of November in the\r\nsixth year of his life on the island that Robinson hoisted his sail\r\nand set out upon this voyage of discovery. He had waited until the\r\nwind was gentle and blowing as far easterly as it does at that place.\r\nHe scudded along bravely, running with the land toward the East and\r\nNorth. All went well until he came to a low reef or ledge of rocks\r\nrunning far out to sea in a north-easterly direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Robinson observed this he went on shore and climbed to a high\r\npoint to see if it was safe to venture. He was afraid of hidden\r\ncurrents, or streams of water. These might carry him away from the\r\nshore and prevent him from getting around the point.\r\n\r\nHe did indeed observe that there was a current running out to sea past\r\nthe ledge, but he thought he could by careful paddling keep his boat\r\nfrom striking the rock. If he could once get beyond the ledge, the\r\nwind would help him double or get around the point. Indeed the danger\r\nwas that the wind would blow him on to the rocks.\r\n\r\nHe waited for two days for a gentle wind. At last without sail he\r\npushed his boat into the current and was born swiftly seaward. He\r\nfound the current much stronger than he thought it would be. It rushed\r\nhis frail boat on past the point of the rocks and out into the sea.\r\nTry as best he might he could not change its course. He was steadily\r\ngoing out to sea. He gave himself up for lost. He reproached himself\r\nfor being so rash and foolhardy as to trust his fortunes in so frail\r\na craft. How dear at this time seemed the island to him! The wind which\r\nhe had depended on to help him at this point had died down so that\r\nit was at the mercy of the current. He kept urging his boat to the\r\nwestward as much as possible, with all his strength, hoping that a\r\nbreeze would finally spring up.\r\n\r\nHe struggled on bravely until about noon. He had been carried out a\r\ngreat distance into the sea, but not so far as to lose sight of the\r\nland. All at once he felt the breeze freshening up. It caught his sail\r\nand soon his boat was cutting across the current. He did not have to\r\ngo far before he was free from it and making headway for the island,\r\nwhich he reached about four o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe found himself on the northern shore of the island, but before long\r\nthe shore ran away to the southward again. He ran briskly along the\r\nwest side until he found a little bay or cove. He determined to enter\r\nthis, draw up his boat on shore and make his way back home across the\r\nisland on foot. He was almost exhausted with his great labor and was\r\nworn out with anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the arms of the cove he found a little creek entering\r\nthe sea. He paddled into this and found a good place to hide his boat.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Robinson was again on land he fell on his knees and with\r\ntears in his eyes thanked God for his deliverance. The island which\r\nhad seemed to him a prison now seemed the fairest and dearest place\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nHaving made his boat safe he started back toward his shelter. But he\r\nwas too tired to go far. He soon came to a little grove of trees\r\nbeneath which he laid himself down and soon was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine with what surprise Robinson was awakened out of his\r\nsleep by a voice calling his name. \"Robinson, Robinson Crusoe,\" it\r\nsaid, \"poor Robinson Crusoe! Where are you Robinson, where have you\r\nbeen?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was so fast asleep that he did not at first rouse up entirely and\r\nthought he was dreaming. But the voice kept calling, \"Robinson,\r\nRobinson, poor Robinson Crusoe!\" He was greatly frightened and started\r\nup. But no sooner were his eyes opened than he saw his parrot sitting\r\non a branch of a tree. He knew at once the source of the voice.\r\n\r\nPolly had missed her master and was also exploring the island. It was\r\na pleasant surprise. She immediately flew to him and lit on his\r\nshoulder. She showed in many ways how glad she was to see him and kept\r\nsaying, \"Poor Robinson, poor Robinson Crusoe!\"\r\n\r\nRobinson remained here over night and the next morning made his way\r\nback to the shelter. Up to this time Robinson had never seen any\r\ndangerous animals on the island. He had grown used to life there and\r\nwent about without fear of animals. But as he was returning across\r\na little opening, he saw a clump of palms in the centre of the opening,\r\nswaying about. He did not at first see what caused this, but soon\r\nthere was thrust out the head of a great serpent. Its jaws were open\r\nand its eyes were fixed on a poor terrified little rabbit. The rabbit\r\nseemed rooted to the spot. It could not stir a muscle and was soon\r\ncaught in the folds of the great snake.\r\n\r\nThis sight made Robinson greatly afraid. He wanted to rush to the\r\nrescue of the rabbit, but what could he do against such a foe? He\r\nresolved in the future to keep a more careful watch and always to\r\nsleep in his bower.\r\n\r\nRobinson had enough of exploring for some time. He was contented to\r\nremain at home. He made many things he needed. He had saved all the\r\nskins of the goats he had killed for meat and all that had died from\r\nany cause. These he made into rugs for his bed. He kept at his loom\r\ntoo, for he was anxious to weave enough of his coarse cloth to make\r\nhim a suit of clothes. He learned how to braid mats and rugs out of\r\nhis fibre, and finally replaced his awkward hat and parasol with\r\nothers braided very skillfully from the long grasses that grew so\r\nabundantly in the marshy places.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that Robinson was now able to make or weave out of his\r\nfibre was a hammock. He had slept all this time on a bed made of poles\r\nlaid lengthwise and thickly covered with the skins of goats and\r\nrabbits.\r\n\r\nNow he could have a comfortable place to sleep. He did not stop until\r\nhe had made two. One was for the bower and the other was for use\r\nout-of-doors. When his work was done in the evening or in the heat\r\nof the midday he would lie in it at full length under the shade of\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson could not forget his boat. It seemed a companion. \"It may\r\nbe the means of my escape from this place,\" he thought. He took frequent\r\njourneys across the island to where his little boat lay in the cove.\r\nHe would start out in the morning and walk over to the west side of\r\nthe island, take his boat and have a pleasant little sail. He always\r\nreturned home before dark, for to tell the truth, Robinson was a\r\ncoward. He was as timid as a hare. He was afraid of everything and\r\nspent many nights without sleep because of fear.\r\n\r\nIt was while on one of his visits to his boat that Robinson made a\r\ndiscovery that changed his whole life. It happened one day, about\r\nnoon, when he was going toward his boat that he, with great surprise,\r\nsaw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore in the sand. He stood\r\nlike one rooted to the ground. He could not move, so great was his\r\nsurprise and fear. He listened, looked around, but could hear and see\r\nnothing. He went up to a little hill to look further, but nothing was\r\nin sight. There was but the one footprint. There was no doubt about\r\nit, there it was, foot, toes, heel and every part of a foot. Robinson\r\ntried to think how it might have gotten there, but he could not. It\r\nwas a mystery. He was greatly afraid and started at once for his\r\nshelter. He ran like one pursued. At every little way he would look\r\nbehind to see if anyone was following him.\r\n\r\nNever a frightened rabbit ran to his hiding place with more terror\r\nthan Robinson ran to his cave. He did not sleep that night for fear\r\nand remained in his shelter for three days, never venturing out. But\r\nhis food was growing short and his goats needed to be milked. He\r\nfinally with a thousand wild fancies forced himself to go about his\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nBut he could not get the footprint out of his mind. He spent many sad\r\nand fearful days thinking about it. \"How could it have gotten there?\r\nWhose was it? Was the owner savage or not? What did he want on the\r\nisland?\" were some of the questions that haunted him.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" he thought one day, \"I just imagined I saw a footprint,\r\nor perhaps it was one of my own that I have made when going to sail\r\nmy boat.\" He took courage at this and began to go about the island\r\nagain. But he went in great fear, always looking behind him. He was\r\nalways ready to run at the first sign of danger. He had made himself\r\na large, strong, new bow and plenty of arrows. He carried these in\r\na quiver he had made from his cloth. He fashioned too a sharp-pointed,\r\nlance-like weapon which he hurled with a kind of sling. In his belt\r\nhe carried some new sharpened stone knives. He had found a better kind\r\nof rock out of which to make his knives. It resembled glass and could\r\nbe brought to a fine, keen edge.\r\n\r\nArmed thus, he began to have more confidence. He had a strong desire\r\nto see the footprint again and make up his mind about it. He wished\r\nto measure it. In this way he could tell certainly whether it was a\r\nchance print of his own foot or not. So, after a few days, he again\r\nventured across the island. Alas, on measuring the print it was much\r\nlarger than his own! There could no longer be any doubt that it\r\nbelonged to someone else.\r\n\r\nAgain great fear fell on poor Robinson. He shook with cold and fright.\r\nHe resolved to make himself more secure against attack.\r\n\r\nHe cut and carried willow stakes and set them in a thick hedge around\r\nin front of his shelter. This was outside the first and enclosed it.\r\nIn a season or two these had grown to such a height as to shut out\r\nall view of his home from sight to one coming to it from the front.\r\n\r\nHis flock of goats gave him many troubled thoughts. His goats were\r\nhis greatest treasure. From them he obtained without trouble his meat,\r\nhis milk and butter.\r\n\r\n\"What if they were discovered and killed or carried away?\" He resolved\r\nto divide his herd into three parts and secrete these in separate\r\nfenced pastures in different parts of the island. His herd of goats\r\nnow numbered twenty-five. He made thorough search about the island\r\nfor the most secluded and best hidden spots where he could fence in\r\na pasture.\r\n\r\nOne day as he was exploring on the west side of the island to find\r\nanother open space for a goat field, he thought he spied away out to\r\nsea a boat. He looked long and anxiously and yet he was not sure that\r\nit was a boat he saw. But how easy, thought Robinson, for the people\r\nof the mainland, which must be at no great distance to the westward,\r\nto come across to this side of the island in fair weather. He thought\r\ntoo, how fortunate he was to have been cast on the east side of the\r\nisland. For there he had his shelter in the very safest part.\r\n\r\nAs he was coming down from a hill where he had gone to get a better\r\nview of the sea he made another discovery. About him everywhere at\r\nthe foot of the hill were bones of all kinds. Near by too, were charcoal\r\nand ashes. There could be no mistake, the place was visited by human\r\nbeings. These were very likely savages. Everything showed that they\r\ncame for the purpose of feasting and not for plundering. It was very\r\nlikely that they neither sought anything on the island nor expected\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATCHING FOR SAVAGES]\r\n\r\nThis thought greatly relieved Robinson. He returned home in a very\r\nthankful and composed state of mind. He had now been on the island\r\nalmost eighteen years and had not been discovered. Yet, no doubt, the\r\nisland had been visited many times by the savages since he had been\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn a short time his fear of discovery wore off and he began to live\r\njust as he did before his discovery.\r\n\r\nHe took, however, greater precaution against surprise. He always\r\ncarried his bow and arrows, his lance and knives. He was also very\r\ncareful about making a great smoke from his fire. He burned a great\r\nquantity of wood in a pit and made charcoal. With this material he\r\nhad a fine fire with a very little smoke. Every day also he went to\r\nthe top of the hill back of his shelter in order to discover if possible\r\nthe approach of savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING OF THE SAVAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother year passed by, Robinson longed more and more to get away from\r\nthe island. Year after year he had hoped and watched in vain for a\r\npassing ship. Every day he would scan the waters that held him\r\nprisoner for the welcome sight of a sail. He had been disappointed.\r\nNow his only hope was to escape to the mainland in some way. He feared\r\nthe savages. He had heard stories of their being cannibals. But if\r\nthey could come to his island in their canoes against the prevailing\r\nwind, why could he not get to the mainland with it in his favor?\r\n\r\nStrange as it may be, Robinson began to wish for the return of the\r\nsavages. He hoped to watch them at a distance and find out something\r\nabout their customs. More especially he wished that he might capture\r\none of them. He had two reasons for this. In the first place he would\r\nhave a companion. He pictured fondly how he would teach him gentle\r\nmanners and the English speech. And, too, the companion would be able\r\nto help him. Besides this he longed above all to know more of the\r\nmainland and whether it would be safe to go there. He wanted to find\r\nout in what kind of boat they made the voyage. He thought that if he\r\nhad such a person he would have someone to show him the way to reach\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe more he thought, the more anxious he became to see the savages\r\non the island. He thought so much about it by day that he dreamed about\r\nit at night. One night he dreamed that the savages came, drew their\r\nboats upon the shore and began to prepare their feast. As he watched\r\nthem one of their number broke away from his fellows and came straight\r\ntoward his hiding-place. Robinson thought he rushed out, drove away\r\nthose that followed the fleeing man and rescued him. This dream made\r\na deep impression upon him and made him await the coming of the savages\r\nwith great hopes and eagerness.\r\n\r\nIt was more than eighteen months after he had formed this plan of\r\ncapturing one of the savages before the savages made their appearance.\r\nRobinson was surprised one morning to see no less than five canoes\r\ndrawn up on the shore at a point on his side of the island about two\r\nmiles below his shelter, to the south. The people that had come in\r\nthem were on shore and out of sight. Robinson went back to his shelter\r\nto make his plans. He made up his mind that he would be foolish to\r\nattack them. There must be twenty-five or thirty of them. He finally\r\nwent to a point where he could see farther inland and soon caught\r\nsight of a crowd of about thirty savages. They were naked and dancing\r\naround and around in a circle. All the while they were singing and\r\nmaking hideous noises. There was a fire in the center of the ring of\r\nsavages. \"They are cooking their feast,\" thought Robinson. \"Maybe I\r\ncan surprise them while they eat and rush in and seize one.\" But this\r\nseemed too great a risk to run. He had no weapons but his bow and\r\narrows, his lance and knife. What could he do against so great a\r\nnumber?\r\n\r\nBut fortune favored his plans. As he gazed at them from his safe\r\ndistance he saw one of their number break away from the rest and run\r\nwith utmost speed directly toward his hiding-place. At once two other\r\nsavages pursued him. They had no weapons but clubs. They ran with\r\ngreat swiftness, but the man in front was steadily gaining ground.\r\n\r\nRobinson now to tell the truth was dreadfully frightened to see the\r\nsavage run directly toward him and his shelter. He kept his place,\r\nhowever, and watched the race. The man running away ran along the\r\nshore and would soon come to the little creek that emptied into the\r\nsea below his home. Robinson saw that the savage would have to swim\r\nthis to escape. He ran down thither and concealed himself behind a\r\ntree and waited for the fugitive to come up. As he did so, the fleeing\r\nsavage plunged in and swam across with a few strong strokes. When he\r\nwas well on the bank, Robinson presented himself and made signs to\r\nhim to come to him and he would help him. The savage was at first almost\r\novercome with astonishment and fright, for Robinson presented a very\r\nunusual sight. The savage at once ran to him and fell down at his\r\nfeet. Indeed so great was his fright and distress that he placed one\r\nof Robinson's feet upon his neck in sign that he yielded up his life\r\ninto his hands. Robinson raised him up and motioned for him to take\r\nthe lance and help in defence against the men, now coming up. They\r\nhid behind trees and waited for them to swim across the stream. But\r\nthis they did not do. When they reached the creek, they could see nothing\r\nof their runaway. They very slowly turned and went back to their\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nRobinson was well content not to let them know that there was any one\r\non the island. He feared they might return and destroy his shelter\r\nand fields.\r\n\r\nRobinson took the savage to his shelter and gave him bread and raisins\r\nto eat, and a cup of water to drink. He was very hungry and ate\r\ngreedily. After he had eaten, Robinson made signs for him to lie down\r\nand sleep, for the Indian was nearly tired out with his long and swift\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nHe was a handsome fellow of his race. His limbs were large, straight\r\nand strong. He had a good face. His hair was long and black, his\r\nforehead high, and his eyes bright. His skin was not black, but of\r\nan olive color. His teeth were fine set and as white as ivory.\r\n\r\nHe slept about an hour; when he awoke he came running to Robinson and\r\nagain made signs to him that he was his slave. \"You saved my life,\"\r\nhe seemed to say, \"and now I will serve you.\" Robinson named him Friday\r\nat once, for that was the day on which the great event of his escape\r\nhad taken place.\r\n\r\nRobinson's next care was to fit him out with some clothing. He had\r\nby this time several suits made of his coarse cloth. He soon had Friday\r\ndressed in one of the old ones, with a straw or braided hat on his\r\nhead. He did not think it safe to allow Friday to sleep with him in\r\nthe bower. He made a little tent for him inside the enclosure. This\r\nwas covered with goatskins and made a very good protection from both\r\nheat and rain.\r\n\r\nRobinson took care to keep all his knives and weapons near him in the\r\nbower. But his fears that Friday might harm him were unfounded. Friday\r\nfrom the first was faithful to his master. He was sweet and obedient\r\nin all things. He seemed to look upon Robinson with the love of a\r\nchild for its father and never tired of serving him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS A TEACHER\r\n\r\n(From Robinson's Diary)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I began to consider that having now two mouths to feed instead of\r\none, I must provide more ground for my harvest and plant a larger\r\nquantity of corn than I used to plant. So I marked out a larger piece\r\nof land and began to fence it in. Friday worked not only very\r\nwillingly but very hard. I told him that it was for corn to make more\r\nbread because he was now with me. He let me know that he was grateful\r\nfor my kindness and would work much harder if I would tell him what\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n\"This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.\r\nFriday began to talk pretty well and understood the names of almost\r\nall the things that I called for and of all the places which I wished\r\nto send him. I was careful to teach him all the things I knew. I\r\nshowed him how to plant and harvest corn, how to gather fibre, spin\r\nyarn and to weave it into cloth. He learned these things quickly and\r\nbecame very skillful in making pots. He knew something about this\r\nbecause at home he had seen the women make them. He ornamented them\r\nwith figures of birds and flowers. I taught him about the true God.\r\nBut as for writing he could never do much with this. I had no books\r\nand could not make him understand the importance of writing. He began\r\nto talk a great deal to me. This delighted me very much. I began to\r\nlove him exceedingly. He was so very honest and faithful.\r\n\r\n\"After I had taught him English I tried one day to find out whether\r\nhe had any wish to return to his own country and as I talked to him\r\nabout it I saw his face light up with joy and his eye sparkle. From\r\nthis I had no doubt but that Friday would like to be in his own country\r\nagain. This for a time made me sad, to think how eagerly he would\r\nleave me to be among his savage friends. 'Do you not wish you were\r\nback in your own country, Friday?' I said to him one day. 'Yes,' he\r\nsaid, 'I be much O glad to be back in my country.' 'What would you\r\ndo there,' said I? 'Would you turn wild again and do as the savages\r\ndo?' He shook his head and said very gravely, 'No, no, Friday tell\r\nthem to live good. He tell them to plant corn and live like white mans.'\r\n\r\n\"One day when we were on the top of a hill on the west side of the\r\nisland, Friday suddenly began to jump and dance about in great glee.\r\nI asked him what the matter was. 'O, joy, O glad,' he said; 'there\r\nmy country!' The air was so clear that from this place, as I had before\r\ndiscovered, land could be distinctly seen looking westward.\r\n\r\n\"I asked him how far it was from our island to his country and whether\r\ntheir canoes were ever lost in coming and going. He said that there\r\nwas no danger. No canoes were ever wrecked and that it was easy to\r\nget back and forth. I asked him many things about his people and country.\r\nHe told me that away to the west of his country there lived 'white\r\nmans like you.' I thought these must be the people of Central America,\r\nand asked him how I might come from this island and get among these\r\nwhite men. He made me understand that I must have a large boat as big\r\nas two canoes.\r\n\r\n\"I resolved at once to begin to make a boat large enough for us to\r\npass over to the land we could see lying to the west and if possible\r\nto go on to the white man's country Friday told me about. It took us\r\nnearly two months to make our boat and rig her out with sails, masts,\r\nrudder, and anchor. We had to weave our sails and twist our rope. We\r\nburned out the canoe from a large fallen log. We used a great stone\r\ntied securely to the end of a strong rope for an anchor.\r\n\r\n\"When we had the boat in the water, Friday showed great skill in\r\nrowing or paddling it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON AND FRIDAY SAILING THE BOAT]\r\n\r\n\"He had managed boats ever since he was old enough, but he did not\r\nknow how to handle a sail or rudder. He learned very quickly, however,\r\nto sail and steer the boat and soon was perfectly at home in it.\r\n\r\n\"We made our boat safe by keeping it in the little cove at the mouth\r\nof the creek. I had Friday to fetch rocks and build a dock or place\r\nfor landing. But the rainy season was now coming on and we must wait\r\nfor fair weather. In the meantime I planned to lay by such quantities\r\nof food as we would need to take along.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nANOTHER SHIPWRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening Robinson sat in his shelter thinking of his plans to\r\nescape to Friday's country. He was sad. For, after all, this place\r\nwas very dear to him. It was the only home he had. Had he not made\r\neverything with his own hands? It was doubly dear to him on this\r\naccount. He thought how it would grieve him to leave his goats, his\r\nfields, and the many comforts he had here.\r\n\r\nHe had been telling Friday of his home in New York. He told him of\r\nthe great city, and of its many wonderful sights. He told him of his\r\ncountry and people, of his flag and its history. All these things\r\nbrought back memories of his boyhood and he wondered what changes had\r\ncome in his long absence. Friday, with wonderful intelligence,\r\nlistened to all Robinson told him. He was delighted in hearing\r\nRobinson tell of the wonders of the great world, for he had never\r\nknown anything about it. As they talked Robinson noticed the approach\r\nof a storm. The sky was getting black with clouds. The winds were\r\nblowing a hurricane. The waves were coming in mountain high. It\r\nreminded him of the eventful night now twenty-five years ago when his\r\nship was tossed up on the shore like an egg shell and broken to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a sound that made Robinson start from his seat with\r\nthe wildest alarm. Was it the sound of a cannon from the ocean or the\r\nterrible crash and roar of the water on the rocks of the coast? There\r\nit is again; it is a cannon! Some ship is in distress! This is its\r\nsignal! Robinson ran out and down to the shore with Friday at his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n\"O master!\" said Friday, \"can we not help? If they only knew the\r\nisland was here and how to steer into the harbor beyond the point of\r\nland on the south.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson was so excited that he scarcely knew what he was doing. He\r\nran up and down the shore calling wildly, but the awful roar of the\r\nsea and wind drowned his cries. Suddenly his thoughts came to him.\r\n\"Quick, Friday, get some fire in a pot. We will run to the point,\r\ngather grass and wood, and make a fire there. Maybe we can guide them\r\ninto the harbor.\"\r\n\r\nThey soon had a great beacon light sending its welcome greeting far\r\nover the sea. The pilot of the ship saw it and steered his ship nearer\r\nand nearer. Robinson was ready to shout for joy as the ship seemed\r\nabout to make the harbor. The ship had her sails torn in shreds and\r\nher rudder broken. It was hard to steer her in such a gale. On\r\nrounding the point, she was blown on the rocks. With a frightful crash\r\nwhich could be heard above the din of the storm she struck and held\r\nfast. Robinson could hear the cries of the men and the orders of the\r\nofficers. They were trying to get boats ready to put off, but such\r\nwas the confusion of the storm and the enormous waves breaking over\r\nthe deck that it could not be done quickly. Before the men could get\r\na boat into the sea, and get into it, the ship gave a lurch to one\r\nside as though about to sink. All the men jumped for one boat. It was\r\noverburdened. The wind tossed it about. The sea soon filled it and\r\nit went down and all were lost.\r\n\r\nRobinson and Friday remained on the shore all night. They watched to\r\nsee if they could not help some poor sailor that might cling to a\r\nplank and be blown on shore. They saw no one.\r\n\r\nAt last they lay down, but they could not sleep. Many times they\r\nsprang up and ran about for fear that some poor fellow would need\r\ntheir help. At last morning came. The storm ceased. Robinson and\r\nFriday searched everywhere for the bodies of the sailors, but could\r\nfind none. But the wind had blown the ship in plain view, and into\r\nshallow waters. It was lying on the bottom with more than half its\r\nbulk out of the water. The masts were gone. It was a sad sight. No\r\nhuman being could be seen on it.\r\n\r\nThey were now rejoiced that they had their boat ready. \"Let us take\r\nit,\" said Robinson \"and go out to the ship. It may be some person is\r\nstill on the unfortunate ship.\" They were soon by the ship's side.\r\nThey rowed around it until they saw a rope hanging down from the deck.\r\nRobinson seized this and clambered up. Friday tied the boat fast, and\r\nfollowed. Robinson opened the door leading from the deck into the ship\r\nand went down. He searched in all the cabins, and knocked at all the\r\ndoors. He called, but all was still. When he was satisfied that every\r\nperson on board had been drowned he wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nFriday stood there with open and staring eyes. He looked and looked.\r\nHe was astonished at the large ship and at the wonderful things before\r\nhim. They were in the cabin where the passengers had been. There stood\r\ntrunks under the benches and clothes hung on the hooks on the wall.\r\nOne trunk was open. In it were telescopes through which the travelers\r\nhad looked at the land. Robinson saw also paper, pens, pen-holders\r\nand ink. Books were also near by. Robinson first took a thick book.\r\nIt was the Bible, out of which his mother had so often taught him.\r\nThen they came to the sailors' cabin. There hung muskets and swords\r\nand bags of shot and cartridges. Then they went to the work-room. There\r\nwere saws, hammers, spades, shovels, chisels, nails, bottles, and pails,\r\nknives and forks. And something more, over which Robinson was most\r\nglad, matches. At last they came into the store-room. There lay bags\r\nof flour and barley, teas, lentils, beans and sugar. Then Robinson\r\nembraced Friday in his great joy and said to him, \"How rich we are!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nSAVING THINGS FROM THE SHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Robinson had looked through the ship he began to plan the way\r\nto get the tools and things he most wanted on shore. He and Friday\r\nfirst carried everything together that he wanted to take on shore.\r\nWhen they had done this, he found he had the following things. Robinson\r\nstood everything together that he needed most.\r\n\r\n  1. A case of nails and screws.\r\n  2. Two iron axes and several hatchets.\r\n  3. A saw.\r\n  4. A small case of planes, tongs, augers,\r\n       files, chisels, etc.\r\n  5. A third case with iron brackets, hooks,\r\n       hinges, etc.\r\n  6. A case of matches.\r\n  7. A barrel of gunpowder.\r\n  8. Two muskets and a pistol.\r\n  9. Several swords.\r\n  10. A bag of cartridges.\r\n  11. A large sail cloth and some rope.\r\n  12. A telescope.\r\n\r\nBy means of the ship's ropes, Robinson let everything down into his\r\nboat. He himself took the Bible and then they rowed to the shore, and\r\nunloaded the boat. Everything was put into the bower where rain could\r\nnot harm it. By the time they had this done, night was coming on and\r\nthey decided to do no more that day, but wait until the next day.\r\n\r\n\"We must work fast,\" said Robinson. \"The first storm is likely to\r\nbreak the ship in pieces and destroy everything in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning early they ate a hastily prepared breakfast and were\r\noff to the boat. Neither Robinson nor Friday stopped for their noonday\r\nlunch. \"A storm is brewing,\" said Robinson, \"the air is calm, the sky\r\nis overcast with clouds, the heat is oppressive. We must hurry.\" With\r\nthe utmost diligence they rowed back and forth all day. They made nine\r\ntrips. They had now on shore a surprising quantity of all kinds of\r\ntools, goods and weapons. They had all kinds of ware to use in the\r\nkitchen, clothes, and food. Robinson prized a little four-wheeled\r\nwagon and a whetstone.\r\n\r\nBut in looking over his stores, Robinson suddenly discovered that he\r\nhad no needles or thread. They went at once to procure these important\r\narticles. In looking for needles and thread, Robinson found a small\r\ntrunk full of money and valuable stones. There were diamonds, rubies,\r\npearls, and much gold. Robinson pushed it to one side. \"What can I\r\ndo with riches on this island? I would give them all for some needles\r\nand thread,\" he said to Friday. But on second thought he took the trunk\r\nand its contents along with him to his cave. For in the trunk were\r\nalso letters and writings. \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"these tell to whom\r\nthe valuables belong and I can return them some time.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson at last found a case containing everything one could need\r\nwith which to cut and sew cloth. There were scissors, thread, needles,\r\nthimbles, tapes, and buttons. But now the wind was rising and they\r\nmust hurry. They were nearly ready for departure. They were passing\r\nthrough a part of the ship not before visited. They were surprised\r\nto hear a sound coming from a room whose door was kept shut by a heap\r\nof stuff that had been thrown against it by the violent pitching of\r\nthe ship in the storm. Robinson and Friday cleared away the rubbish\r\nand were surprised to find a dog almost drowned. He was so weak from\r\nwant of food that his cries could be heard a short distance only. Robinson\r\ntook him tenderly in his arms and carried him to the boat, while\r\nFriday carried the sewing case and the trunk.\r\n\r\nThe wind was now blowing a gale. A few yards from the ship they were\r\nin great danger. Robinson grasped the rudder and made Friday stand\r\nready to cut away the mast in case they found the wind too strong.\r\nWith the greatest difficulty they finally made the little cove at the\r\nmouth of the creek and were soon landed with their precious cargo.\r\nThe next morning they eagerly searched the waters for the ship. Not\r\neven their field glasses could reveal anything of it. Some planks,\r\na mast, and parts of a small boat were blown on shore. All else had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nRobinson set to work at once to make a door for his bower out of the\r\npine wood cast up by the waves. How easy the work proceeded with saws,\r\nhammers, augers, squares, planes, nails, hinges, and screws! With the\r\nwagon too, Friday could now gather his corn quickly and easily, or\r\nhaul in a great quantity of grapes to dry for raisins.\r\n\r\nFriday had never seen a gun. He did not know the use of firearms. The\r\nmuskets that Robinson had brought from the ship were a great mystery\r\nto him. Robinson showed him their use. He showed how they could defend\r\nthemselves. He told Friday that these weapons would kill at a\r\ndistance. He took some powder and touched a match to it. Friday was\r\ngreatly frightened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON SHOWING FRIDAY HOW TO SHOOT]\r\n\r\nRobinson then proceeded to load the gun. He put in some powder, a\r\nball of lead or bullet. Then at the hammer he placed a little cap\r\nwhich gave a flash when struck. This ignited the powder. When all\r\nwas in readiness Robinson bade Friday follow him. They went slowly\r\nout into the forest along the stream. Soon Robinson espied a rabbit\r\nsitting under a clump of grass. Robinson raised his gun, took careful\r\naim, pressed the trigger. There was a flash and loud report and there\r\nlay the rabbit dead. But Friday, too, was lying on the ground. He had\r\nfainted from astonishment and fright. Robinson dropped his gun and\r\nraised the poor fellow up to a sitting position. He quickly recovered.\r\nHe ran to get the rabbit. He examined it carefully. Robinson at last\r\npointed out the hole the bullet had made and the mystery of the way\r\nthe rabbit was killed was solved.\r\n\r\nRobinson had lived alone so long that he had learned to love every\r\nliving creature on the island. He never harmed anything except when\r\nhe needed food. He had lived so quietly that the birds and animals\r\ndid not fear him. They lived near his shelter and seemed to know him.\r\n\r\nRobinson was delighted with his new tools and weapons. But they\r\nreminded him of home. Nothing that he had seen in all the time he had\r\nbeen on the island so turned his thoughts toward home and friends.\r\nRobinson would sit for hours thinking of the past and making plans\r\nfor the future. He was homesick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF THE SAVAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson now renewed his plans for escaping from the island to\r\nFriday's country. They first rebuilt their boat with their new tools.\r\nThey hollowed out the center till the sides were thin toward the top.\r\nThey shaped her sides and keel. They made her prow sharp so that she\r\nwould cut the water easily. They made a new mast, strong and tall and\r\nshapely. They made larger and stronger sails and ropes. They made two\r\npairs of extra oars. They made boxes and cupboards in the prow and\r\nstern for keeping their fresh water and provisions. Friday's eyes\r\nsparkled with joy when it was done. He hoped he would now be able to\r\nreturn to his own island and parents. Robinson noticed his joy and\r\nasked him, \"Do you want to return to your own people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Friday, \"very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you trust yourself in this boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Friday.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said his master, \"you may have it and start home when\r\nyou please.\". \"Yes, Master, but you come too, my people will not hurt\r\nyou.\" Robinson resolved to venture over to Friday's land with him.\r\n\r\nBut before their preparations were complete the rainy season of our\r\nfall set in. They resolved to wait until the weather was settled and\r\nas soon as the rainy season was over to set out. They ran their boat\r\nwell up into the creek and covered it over with a large tarpaulin made\r\nof sail-cloth obtained from the ship.\r\n\r\nRobinson had now been on the island twenty-seven years. For the last\r\nthree years he had lived happily with his companion Friday. Every year\r\nin September, Robinson celebrated the day his life was saved and he\r\nwas thrown up on the island. Robinson celebrated it this year with\r\nmore than the usual thankfulness. He thought that it would be his last\r\nanniversary on the island.\r\n\r\nOne morning, Friday had gone to the beach to find a turtle. Soon he\r\ncame running back out of breath. \"O Master,\" he cried, \"they are\r\ncoming, they are coming to take me prisoner!\" He was trembling with\r\nfright.\r\n\r\n\"We must take our guns and defend ourselves,\" said Robinson. \"But we\r\nwill not kill anyone unless they attack us.\" This quieted Friday. They\r\nloaded four muskets and three pistols. Robinson put the pistols in\r\nhis belt, where he also fastened a sword. He gave Friday a pistol and\r\na musket, for Friday had learned to shoot well. Besides Friday carried\r\na bag of powder and bullets. Robinson took his field glasses and saw\r\ntwenty-one savages with two prisoners. The prisoners were bound and\r\nlying on the ground. This was a war party celebrating a victory with\r\na feast. They probably intended to kill their prisoners. \"We must save\r\nthe lives of those men,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\nThe savages this time had landed quite near Robinson's shelter, not\r\nmore than a half mile below the creek's mouth. Soon he and Friday\r\nstarted off. Robinson commanded Friday to follow quietly and not to\r\nspeak or shoot.\r\n\r\n\"We will surprise them and give them a good scare,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\nWhen yet a considerable distance away they could hear the savages\r\nyelling and screaming. Some of them were dancing their war dance.\r\nTheir faces and bodies were painted to make them look terrible to\r\ntheir enemies. They were dancing around their prisoners with hideous\r\ncries and gestures. They could now see the prisoners plainly. One had\r\na beard and was plainly a white man. Robinson was surprised and\r\ndetermined to save him at all risks.\r\n\r\n\"Get your gun ready to fire,\" he said to Friday, \"and when I say the\r\nword let us run forward yelling and firing our guns over their heads.\r\nThis will fill them with such fright that they will take to their\r\nheels and boats and get away as soon as possible. In the scramble and\r\nconfusion we will rush in and rescue the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan did not please Friday at all. His savage blood was up and\r\nhe wanted to kill all he could. \"Let's fire on them,\" he said. \"Let's\r\nkill all but the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Robinson, \"it's always wrong to take life unless it\r\ncannot be avoided to save one's own. Let's try my plan first.\"\r\n\r\nWith great reluctance Friday consented. At a signal from Robinson they\r\nrushed forward, and when in plain sight they fired off their muskets\r\nin the air. If the ground had suddenly exploded beneath their feet\r\nthere could have been no more confusion, astonishment, and fright.\r\nA few took to their heels. Others lay as if dead. They had swooned\r\nfrom fright. But as Robinson came up they jumped to their feet and\r\npushed into the boats, leaving the prisoners behind. Robinson and Friday\r\nstill rushed forward and fired their remaining loaded guns and pistols\r\nin the air. The savages made all haste to get into their boats and\r\npush off. Soon they were well out to sea, paddling rapidly for the\r\nwest. Robinson reloaded his arms and gave them a farewell volley, but\r\nnot a soul was killed or even wounded. This gave Robinson great\r\npleasure. He had accomplished his purpose without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThey could now turn to the prisoners. Robinson ran back to them and\r\nquickly cut their ropes. Robinson asked the white man who he was, but\r\nthe man was too weak to answer. Robinson gave him a piece of bread.\r\n\r\nThe fear of death being removed, the white man soon grew stronger.\r\nWhen Friday came running back from watching the boats and saw the\r\nsavage that had been a prisoner he gave a loud yell. He threw his arms\r\naround the man, kissed him and laughed and cried for joy. He put his\r\nhead on his breast and hugged him again and again. Robinson was\r\ngreatly surprised and puzzled. He asked Friday what his actions meant.\r\nBut so intent was Friday that he got no answer.\r\n\r\nAt last Friday recovered far enough from his great joy to say with\r\nface beaming with delight, \"O, Master, this man is my dear father.\"\r\nThey at once began a long conversation, each one told his story.\r\nSuddenly Friday jumped up and said, \"How foolish I am, I have not\r\nthought to give my father anything to eat and drink. He must be nearly\r\nstarved.\" And away he ran toward the shelter and was soon back with\r\nfood and water to drink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRIDAY AND HIS FATHER]\r\n\r\nRobinson learned through Friday from his father that the white man\r\nwas a Spaniard, that he had been captured by the tribe that had a battle\r\nwith Friday's people. The Spaniard was one of sixteen men that had\r\nbeen saved by Friday's people from a wrecked ship. So weak were the\r\nprisoners that they could not walk to the shelter. Robinson and Friday\r\nmade a litter and carried them one after the other. When once there,\r\nFriday prepared some rich rice soup. The prisoners ate heartily and\r\nin a few days were strong enough to go about the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\nDELIVERANCE AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday had not forgotten the plan for going to his home. He would\r\noften mention it and spent hours talking about it during the long\r\nrainy season. But now that the Spaniard and Friday's father had come\r\ninto the family, Robinson felt he must change his plans a little. He\r\nfelt very sorry for the Spaniards left in Friday's country. They did\r\nnot have enough to eat and were sick and sad besides. He talked the\r\nmatter over with the Spaniard many times. They at last planned to send\r\nfor them. The Spaniard and Friday's father were to go. Robinson was\r\nfor doing it at once. But the Spaniard advised delay. \"How can we get\r\nfood for ourselves and fifteen others? Your small store will soon be\r\nused up,\" he argued. Robinson at last saw that this difficulty must\r\nbe overcome. There was just one thing to do, and this, to delay their\r\ndeparture until a new crop of corn could be raised. This would take\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nBut at it they went. The four men could do much and work fast. They\r\ncleared more ground and planted all the seed corn they could spare\r\nfrom their store. Besides this they sowed about twelve bushels of\r\nbarley they had gotten in the ship.\r\n\r\nThe care for so much crop, its harvesting and storing away, kept them\r\nvery busy for the season. Robinson not only did this, but also\r\nincreased his flock of goats by catching kids and putting them in his\r\npasture. He gathered, too, all the grapes he could and dried them on\r\nthe branches of trees.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the harvesting season, they made ready their boat. They\r\nfilled it with all the bread it could well carry. They put in raisins\r\nand fresh water. Robinson gave the Spaniard and Friday's father each\r\na musket and plenty of powder and bullets. Now, all was ready. Friday\r\ngave his father a loving farewell. He stretched out his arms towards\r\nhim as the boat moved away. The Spaniard and Robinson waved their hats\r\nand they were off.\r\n\r\nThey promised to be back in eight or nine days. Robinson and Friday\r\nmade every preparation to receive the guests. They were to have a home\r\nnot far from Robinson's built of poles, and thatched with the long\r\nmarsh grasses, like Robinson's bower. There was no need of hiding or\r\ndefending it. It did not take long to fix it up.\r\n\r\nEight days had now passed since the boat had left. Friday could hardly\r\nrestrain himself longer. He watched the ocean all the time. He would\r\ngo to the top of the hill with the field glasses every hour during the\r\nday to catch a first glimpse of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON AND FRIDAY SEE A SHIP]\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day, as Friday put up his glasses to search the waters\r\nhe dropped them with a yell of surprise. He tore down the hill with\r\nthe utmost speed and rushed up to Robinson as one gone mad. \"Look,\r\nlook, O Master!\" he cried, \"a big ship; a big ship way out on the sea!\"\r\nRobinson took the glasses, and sure enough, there within hailing\r\ndistance was a large ocean going vessel. Robinson was overcome with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-eight years his aching eyes had scanned the waters for this\r\nwelcome sight. His joy was boundless. The ship looked like an\r\nAmerican. Yes, there floated the American flag! How welcome a sight\r\nto Robinson. He could not utter a word. Tears filled his eyes and\r\nstreamed down his cheeks. He would soon have news from home. He ran\r\nto the shore and shot off a gun to attract the attention of those on\r\nboard. He heard answering shots at once.\r\n\r\nSoon a boat was lowered and in it three men rowed toward the shore.\r\nIt was the captain himself and two sailors. The captain was astonished\r\nto find a man in the lonely island. Robinson told how it all had happened\r\nand how he would like to return home. To his unspeakable delight the\r\ncaptain told him that the ship was bound for New York and would take\r\nhim along free of charge, but he must leave that day. The ship could\r\nnot be delayed any longer. Of course Robinson would go. Friday was\r\nbeside himself with grief. He did not want to be left behind alone.\r\nHe did not know that the Spaniards would ever return. Something might\r\nhappen to them on the sea. But before the eventful day the Spaniards\r\nlanded. They brought word that Friday's father had died after his\r\nreturn home. Friday was thrown into a fit of grief at the news. He\r\nwept and repeated over and over his praise of the good man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AT HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with a sad heart that Robinson made ready to leave. Every\r\nfamiliar place seemed now doubly dear to him. He went from one to\r\nanother with tears in his eyes. Here lay his home. Here were his\r\nfields, his crops and his goats. Everything was the work of his own\r\nhands. He had made them all. Which should he take? He hesitated long.\r\nHe must take home some of his belongings to show the people at home.\r\nAnd there were his parrot and the dog which had won a place in\r\nRobinson's heart. He decided to take them along. At length he got\r\ntogether his diary, his parasol, his Bible, his treasures, a suit of\r\nclothes, his dog, and a hat. He had saved, too, his bow and arrows.\r\nThese he decided to take along. Everything else he gave to his good\r\nman Friday and the Spaniard who wished to be allowed to remain on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nRobinson kissed Friday tenderly. He with great effort finally tore\r\nhimself away and ran to the shore where the ship's boat awaited him.\r\nBut Robinson had not counted on the strength of Friday's love for him.\r\nRobinson's boat had not yet reached the ship when Friday sprang into\r\nthe water and swam after him shouting, \"Master, take me with you, I\r\nwould rather die than stay here without you.\" Robinson was touched\r\nat the devotion showed by the faithful Friday, and gave orders to turn\r\nthe boat back, and take him on board. The anchor was raised. The ship\r\nstarted on her way to the home Robinson had left so long ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON LEAVING THE ISLAND]\r\n\r\nThe wind was favorable and in seven weeks the spires and buildings\r\nof his native city were in sight. His vessel came slowly up to the\r\nwharf where he had taken ship so many years ago. Here, too, he had\r\nplayed and idled his time away. He remembered it all. His idleness\r\nand playing truant came back in sad memories. Before Robinson and Friday\r\nlanded, their good friend the captain gave them each a new suit of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nEverything had changed. He scarcely knew the place. He was astonished\r\nand confused by the din, hurry and bustle of a great city. Friday\r\nseemed dazed by it all and clung to Robinson's side. The buildings\r\nwere so tall, the street cars, the carriages were different.\r\nEverywhere there were iron machines, casting out smoke, puffing and\r\nrunning about on iron rails. Robinson had never seen these.\r\n\r\nRobinson, however, did not stop to admire; he pushed on to a certain\r\nstreet and house where lived his parents at the time of his departure.\r\nIt was with difficulty that he found the place. It was now in the\r\nheart of the city. Upon inquiry he found, after much searching, that\r\nhis father had removed his store and home to another part of the city,\r\nhis mother had died of grief for her disobedient son. Robinson was\r\nsorely grieved at this. He had hoped to see her and tell her how sorry\r\nhe was that he had caused her so much anxiety and sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen he had found the place where his father lived he stole quietly\r\nup to the house and opened the door. His father, now a gray-haired\r\nman, bent with age and sorrow, was sitting in his armchair reading.\r\n\r\nRobinson came forward, but his father did not recognize him. \"Who are\r\nyou?\" he said. \"I am Robinson, your long-lost son.\" He knelt by his\r\nfather's side and asked forgiveness for all the trouble he had caused.\r\nHis father was overcome. He could not speak. He drew Robinson with\r\nfeeble hands to his breast. \"My son, I forgive you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nRobinson's boyhood friends heard of his strange return. They had\r\nthought him dead long ago. They never tired of hearing him tell his\r\nstrange story. They pitied him in his misfortune. But Robinson told\r\nthem that it all happened to him because he was idle and disobedient\r\nin his youth.\r\n\r\nRobinson at once relieved his father at the store. The business\r\nthrived. His father died. He soon had a home of his own with a happy\r\nfamily. Friday, the dog, and the parrot lived in it, dearly beloved\r\nand cared for by their master the rest of their days. In the home\r\nthere is a young Robinson who loves to hear his father read from his\r\ndiary of the wonderful things that happened on the island.\r\n\r\nRobinson tried many times to find the rightful owner of the gold and\r\njewels, but never succeeded. At last he gave them to a school where\r\nboys with idle habits were taught to lead useful and industrious\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's An American Robinson Crusoe, by Samuel B.
