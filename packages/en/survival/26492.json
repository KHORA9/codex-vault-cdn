F. Atkinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the issue of my \"Studies and Illustrations of Mushrooms,\" as\r\nBulletins 138 and 168 of the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation, there have been so many inquiries for them and for literature\r\ndealing with a larger number of species, it seemed desirable to publish\r\nin book form a selection from the number of illustrations of these\r\nplants which I have accumulated during the past six or seven years. The\r\nselection has been made of those species representing the more important\r\ngenera, and also for the purpose of illustrating, as far as possible,\r\nall the genera of agarics found in the United States. This has been\r\naccomplished except in a few cases of the more unimportant ones. There\r\nhave been added, also, illustrative genera and species of all the other\r\norders of the higher fungi, in which are included many of the edible\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe photographs have been made with great care after considerable\r\nexperience in determining the best means for reproducing individual,\r\nspecific, and generic characters, so important and difficult to preserve\r\nin these plants, and so impossible in many cases to accurately portray\r\nby former methods of illustration.\r\n\r\nOne is often asked the question: \"How do you tell the mushrooms from the\r\ntoadstools?\" This implies that mushrooms are edible and that toadstools\r\nare poisonous, and this belief is very widespread in the public mind.\r\nThe fact is that many of the toadstools are edible, the common belief\r\nthat all of them are poisonous being due to unfamiliarity with the\r\nplants or their characteristics.\r\n\r\nSome apply the term mushroom to a single species, the one in\r\ncultivation, and which grows also in fields (_Agaricus campestris_), and\r\ncall all others toadstools. It is becoming customary with some students\r\nto apply the term mushroom to the entire group of higher fungi to which\r\nthe mushroom belongs (_Basidiomycetes_), and toadstool is regarded as a\r\nsynonymous term, since there is, strictly speaking, no distinction\r\nbetween a mushroom and a toadstool. There are, then, edible and\r\npoisonous mushrooms, or edible and poisonous toadstools, as one chooses\r\nto employ the word.\r\n\r\nA more pertinent question to ask is how to distinguish the edible from\r\nthe poisonous mushrooms. There is no single test or criterion, like the\r\n\"silver spoon\" test, or the criterion of a scaly cap, or the presence of\r\na \"poison cup\" or \"death cup,\" which will serve in all cases to\r\ndistinguish the edible from the poisonous. Two plants may possess\r\nidentical characters in this respect, i. e., each may have the \"death\r\ncup,\" and one is edible while the other is poisonous, as in _Amanita\r\ncæsarea_, edible, and _A. phalloides_, poisonous. There are additional\r\ncharacters, however, in these two plants which show that the two differ,\r\nand we recognize them as two different species.\r\n\r\nTo know several different kinds of edible mushrooms, which occur in\r\ngreater or less quantity through the different seasons, would enable\r\nthose interested in these plants to provide a palatable food at the\r\nexpense only of the time required to collect them. To know several of\r\nthe poisonous ones also is important, in order certainly to avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this book is to present the important characters which it\r\nis necessary to observe, in an interesting and intelligible way, to\r\npresent life-size photographic reproductions accompanied with plain and\r\naccurate descriptions. By careful observation of the plant, and\r\ncomparison with the illustrations and text, one will be able to add many\r\nspecies to the list of edible ones, where now perhaps is collected \"only\r\nthe one which is pink underneath.\" The chapters 17 to 21 should also be\r\ncarefully read.\r\n\r\nThe number of people in America who interest themselves in the\r\ncollection of mushrooms for the table is small compared to those in some\r\nEuropean countries. The number, however, is increasing, and if a little\r\nmore attention were given to the observation of these plants and the\r\ndiscrimination of the more common kinds, many persons could add greatly\r\nto the variety of their foods and relishes with comparatively no cost.\r\nThe quest for these plants in the fields and woods would also afford a\r\nmost delightful and needed recreation to many, and there is no subject\r\nin nature more fascinating to engage one's interest and powers of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThere are also many important problems for the student in this group of\r\nplants. Many of our species and the names of the plants are still in\r\ngreat confusion, owing to the very careless way in which these plants\r\nhave usually been preserved, and the meagerness of recorded observations\r\non the characters of the fresh plants, or of the different stages of\r\ndevelopment. The study has also an important relation to agriculture and\r\nforestry, for there are numerous species which cause decay of valuable\r\ntimber, or by causing \"heart rot\" entail immense losses through the\r\nannual decretion occurring in standing timber.\r\n\r\nIf this book contributes to the general interest in these plants as\r\nobjects of nature worthy of observation, if it succeeds in aiding those\r\nwho are seeking information of the edible kinds, and stimulates some\r\nstudents to undertake the advancement of our knowledge of this group, it\r\nwill serve the purpose the author had in mind in its preparation.\r\n\r\nI wish here to express my sincere thanks to Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer for\r\nher kindness in writing a chapter on recipes for cooking mushrooms,\r\nespecially for this book; to Professor I. P. Roberts, Director of the\r\nCornell University Agricultural Experiment Station, for permission to\r\nuse certain of the illustrations (Figs. 1--7, 12--14, 31--43) from\r\nBulletins 138 and 168, Studies and Illustrations of Mushrooms; to Mr. F.\r\nR. Rathbun, for the charts from which the colored plates were made; to\r\nMr. J. F. Clark and Mr. H. Hasselbring, for the Chapters on Chemistry\r\nand Toxicology of Mushrooms, and Characters of Mushrooms, to which their\r\nnames are appended, and also to Dr. Chas. Peck, of Albany, N. Y., and\r\nDr. G. Bresadola, of Austria-Hungary, to whom some of the specimens have\r\nbeen submitted.\r\n\r\n  GEO. F. ATKINSON,\r\n  Ithaca, N.

It was possible\r\nto accomplish this without changing the paging of any of the descriptive\r\npart, so that references to all of the plants in either edition will be\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThere are also added a chapter on the \"Uses of Mushrooms,\" and an\r\nextended chapter on the \"Cultivation of Mushrooms.\" This subject I have\r\nbeen giving some attention to for several years, and in view of the call\r\nfor information since the appearance of the first edition, it seemed\r\nwell to add this chapter, illustrated by several flashlight photographs.\r\n\r\n  G.

Some are quite strikingly different from others, so that no one\r\nwould have difficulty in recognizing the difference in shape. For\r\nexample, an umbrella-shaped mushroom like the one shown in Fig. 1 or 81\r\nis easily distinguished from a shelving one like that in Fig. 9 or 188.\r\nBut in many cases different species vary only slightly in form, so that\r\nit becomes a more or less difficult matter to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nIn those plants (for the mushroom is a plant) where the different kinds\r\nare nearly alike in form, there are other characters than mere general\r\nform which enable one to tell them apart. These, it is true, require\r\nclose observation on our part, as well as some experience in judging of\r\nthe value of such characters; the same habit of observation and\r\ndiscrimination we apply to everyday affairs and to all departments of\r\nknowledge. But so few people give their attention to the discrimination\r\nof these plants that few know the value of their characters, or can even\r\nrecognize them.\r\n\r\nIt is by a study of these especial characters of form peculiar to the\r\nmushrooms that one acquires the power of discrimination among the\r\ndifferent kinds. For this reason one should become familiar with the\r\nparts of the mushroom, as well as those characters and markings peculiar\r\nto them which have been found to stamp them specifically.\r\n\r\n=Parts of the Mushroom.=--To serve as a means of comparison, the common\r\npasture mushroom, or cultivated form (_Agaricus campestris_), is first\r\ndescribed. Figure 1 illustrates well the principal parts of the plant;\r\nthe cap, the radiating plates or gills on the under side, the stem, and\r\nthe collar or ring around its upper end.\r\n\r\n=The Cap.=--The cap (technically the _pileus_) is the expanded part of\r\nthe mushroom. It is quite thick, and fleshy in consistency, more or less\r\nrounded or convex on the upper side, and usually white in color. It is\r\nfrom 1--2 cm. thick at the center and 5--10 cm. in diameter. The surface\r\nis generally smooth, but sometimes it is torn up more or less into\r\ntriangular scales. When these scales are prominent they are often of a\r\ndark color. This gives quite a different aspect to the plant, and has\r\nled to the enumeration of several varieties, or may be species, among\r\nforms accredited by some to the one species.\r\n\r\n=The Gills.=--On the under side of the pileus are radiating plates, the\r\ngills, or _lamellæ_ (sing. _lamella_). These in shape resemble somewhat\r\na knife blade. They are very thin and delicate. When young they are pink\r\nin color, but in age change to a dark purple brown, or nearly black\r\ncolor, due to the immense number of spores that are borne on their\r\nsurfaces. The gills do not quite reach the stem, but are rounded at this\r\nend and so curve up to the cap. The triangular spaces between the longer\r\nones are occupied by successively shorter gills, so that the combined\r\nsurface of all the gills is very great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE. 1.--Agaricus campestris. View of under side\r\nshowing stem, annulus, gills, and margin of pileus. (Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=The Stem or Stipe.=--The stem in this plant, as in many other kinds, is\r\nattached to the pileus in the center. The purpose of the stem seems\r\nquite surely to be that of lifting the cap and the gills up above the\r\nground, so that the spores can float in the currents of air and be\r\nreadily scattered. The stem varies in length from 2--10 cm. and is about\r\n1--1-1/2 cm. in diameter. It is cylindrical in form, and even, quite\r\nfirm and compact, though sometimes there is a central core where the\r\nthreads are looser. The stem is also white and fleshy, and is usually\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\n=The Ring.=--There is usually present in the mature plant of _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_ a thin collar (_annulus_) or ring around the upper end of\r\nthe stem. It is not a movable ring, but is joined to the stem. It is\r\nvery delicate, easily rubbed off, or may be even washed off during\r\nrains.\r\n\r\n=Parts Present in Other Mushrooms--The Volva.=--Some other mushrooms,\r\nlike the _deadly Amanita_ (_Amanita phalloides_) and other species of\r\nthe genus _Amanita_, have, in addition to the cap, gills, stem, and\r\nring, a more or less well formed cup-like structure attached to the\r\nlower end of the stem, and from which the stem appears to spring. (Figs.\r\n55, 72, etc.) This is the _volva_, sometimes popularly called the \"death\r\ncup,\" or \"poison cup.\" This structure is a very important one to\r\nobserve, though its presence by no means indicates in all cases that the\r\nplant is poisonous. It will be described more in detail in treating of\r\nthe genus _Amanita_, where the illustrations should also be consulted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.--Agaricus campestris. \"Buttons\" just appearing\r\nthrough the sod. Some spawn at the left lower corner. Soil removed from\r\nthe front. (Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=Presence or Absence of Ring or Volva.=--Of the mushrooms which have\r\nstems there are four types with respect to the presence or absence of\r\nthe ring and volva. In the first type both the ring and volva are\r\nabsent, as in the common fairy ring mushroom, _Marasmius oreades_; in\r\nthe genus _Lactarius_, _Russula_, _Tricholoma_, _Clitocybe_, and others.\r\nIn the second type the ring is present while the volva is absent, as in\r\nthe common mushroom, _Agaricus campestris_, and its close allies; in the\r\ngenus _Lepiota_, _Armillaria_, and others. In the third type the volva\r\nis present, but the ring is absent, as in the genus _Volvaria_, or\r\n_Amanitopsis_. In the fourth type both the ring and volva are present,\r\nas in the genus _Amanita_.\r\n\r\n=The Stem is Absent in Some Mushrooms.=--There are also quite a large\r\nnumber of mushrooms which lack a stem. These usually grow on stumps,\r\nlogs, or tree trunks, etc., and one side of the cap is attached directly\r\nto the wood on which the fungus is growing. The pileus in such cases is\r\nlateral and shelving, that is, it stands out more or less like a shelf\r\nfrom the trunk or log, or in other cases is spread out flat on the\r\nsurface of the wood. The shelving form is well shown in the beautiful\r\n_Claudopus nidulans_, sometimes called _Pleurotus nidulans_, and in\r\nother species of the genus _Pleurotus_, _Crepidotus_, etc. These plants\r\nwill be described later, and no further description of the peculiarities\r\nin form of the mushrooms will be now attempted, since these will be best\r\ndealt with when discussing species fully under their appropriate genus.\r\nBut the brief general description of form given above will be found\r\nuseful merely as an introduction to the more detailed treatment. Chapter\r\nXXI should also be studied. For those who wish the use of a glossary,\r\none is appended at the close of the book, dealing only with the more\r\ntechnical terms employed here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.--Agaricus campestris. Soil washed from the\r\n\"spawn\" and \"buttons,\" showing the young \"buttons\" attached to the\r\nstrands of mycelium. (1-1/4 natural size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSHROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the stems of the mushrooms are pulled or dug from the ground, white\r\nstrands are often clinging to the lower end. These strands are often\r\nseen by removing some of the earth from the young plant, as shown in\r\nFig. 2. This is known among gardeners as \"spawn.\" It is through the\r\ngrowth and increase of this spawn that gardeners propagate the\r\ncultivated mushroom. Fine specimens of the spawn of the cultivated\r\nmushroom can be seen by digging up from a bed a group of very young\r\nplants, such a group as is shown in Fig. 3. Here the white strands are\r\nmore numerous than can readily be found in the lawns and pastures where\r\nthe plant grows in the feral state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--Agaricus campestris. Sections of \"buttons\" at\r\ndifferent stages, showing formation of gills and veil covering them.\r\n(Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=Nature of Mushroom Spawn.=--This spawn, it should be clearly\r\nunderstood, is not spawn in the sense in which that word is used in fish\r\nculture; though it may be employed so readily in propagation of\r\nmushrooms. The spawn is nothing more than the vegetative portion of the\r\nplant. It is made up of countless numbers of delicate, tiny, white,\r\njointed threads, the _mycelium_.\r\n\r\n=Mycelium of a Mold.=--A good example of mycelium which is familiar to\r\nnearly every one occurs in the form of a white mold on bread or on\r\nvegetables. One of the molds, so common on bread, forms at first a white\r\ncottony mass of loosely interwoven threads. Later the mold becomes black\r\nin color because of numerous small fruit cases containing dark spores.\r\nThis last stage is the fruiting stage of the mold. The earlier stage is\r\nthe growing, or vegetative, stage. The white mycelium threads grow in\r\nthe bread and absorb food substances for the mold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.--Agaricus campestris. Nearly mature plants,\r\nshowing veil stretched across gill cavity. (Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=Mushroom Spawn is in the Form of Strands of Mycelium.=--Now in the\r\nmushrooms the threads of mycelium are usually interlaced into definite\r\nstrands or cords, especially when the mycelium is well developed. In\r\nsome species these strands become very long, and are dark brown in\r\ncolor. Each thread of mycelium grows, or increases in length, at the\r\nend. Each one of the threads grows independently, though all are\r\nintertwined in the strand. In this way the strand of mycelium increases\r\nin length. It even branches as it extends itself through the soil.\r\n\r\n=The Button Stage of the Mushroom.=--The \"spawn\" stage, or strands of\r\nmycelium, is the vegetative or growing stage of the mushroom. These\r\nstrands grow through the substance on which the fungus feeds. When the\r\nfruiting stage, or the mushroom, begins there appear small knobs or\r\nenlargements on these strands, and these are the beginnings of the\r\nbutton stage, as it is properly called. These knobs or young buttons are\r\nwell shown in Fig. 3. They begin by the threads of mycelium growing in\r\ngreat numbers out from the side of the cords. These enlarge and elongate\r\nand make their way toward the surface of the ground. They are at first\r\nvery minute and grow from the size of a pinhead to that of a pea, and\r\nlarger. Now they begin to elongate somewhat and the end enlarges as\r\nshown in the larger button in the figure. Here the two main parts of the\r\nmushroom are outlined, the stem and the cap. At this stage also the\r\nother parts of the mushroom begin to be outlined. The gills appear on\r\nthe under side of this enlargement at the end of the button, next the\r\nstem. They form by the growth of fungus threads downward in radiating\r\nlines which correspond in position to the position of the gills. At the\r\nsame time a veil is formed over the gills by threads which grow from the\r\nstem upward to the side of the button, and from the side of the button\r\ndown toward the stem to meet them. This covers the gills up at an early\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.--Agaricus campestris. Under view of two plants\r\njust after rupture of the veil, fragments of the latter clinging both to\r\nmargin of the pileus and to stem. (Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=From the Button Stage to the Mushroom.=--If we split several of the\r\nbuttons of different sizes down through the middle, we shall be able to\r\nsee the position of the gills covered by the veil during their\r\nformation. These stages are illustrated in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nAs the cap grows in size the gills elongate, and the veil becomes\r\nbroader. But when the plant is nearly grown the veil ceases to grow, and\r\nthen the expanding cap pulls so strongly on it that it is torn. Figure 5\r\nshows the veil in a stretched condition just before it is ruptured, and\r\nin Fig. 6 the veil has just been torn apart. The veil of the common\r\nmushroom is very delicate and fragile, as the illustration shows, and\r\nwhen it is ruptured it often breaks irregularly, sometimes portions of\r\nit clinging to the margin of the cap and portions clinging to the stem,\r\nor all of it may cling to the cap at times; but usually most of it\r\nremains clinging for a short while on the stem. Here it forms the\r\nannulus or ring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--Agaricus campestris. Plant in natural position\r\njust after rupture of veil, showing tendency to double annulus on the\r\nstem. Portions of the veil also dripping from margin of pileus. (Natural\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n=The Color of the Gills.=--The color of the gills of the common mushroom\r\nvaries in different stages of development. When very young the gills are\r\nwhite. But very soon the gills become pink in color, and during the\r\nbutton stage if the veil is broken this pink color is usually present\r\nunless the button is very small. The pink color soon changes to dark\r\nbrown after the veil becomes ruptured, and when the plants are quite old\r\nthey are nearly black. This dark color of the gills is due to the dark\r\ncolor of the spores, which are formed in such great numbers on the\r\nsurface of the gills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8.--Agaricus campestris. Section of gill showing\r\n_tr_==trama; _sh_==sub-hymenium; _b_==basidium, the basidia make up the\r\nhymenium; _st_==sterigma; _g_==spore. (Magnified.)]\r\n\r\n=Structure of a Gill.=--In Fig. 8 is shown a portion of a section across\r\none of the gills, and it is easy to see in what manner the spores are\r\nborne. The gill is made up, as the illustration shows, of mycelium\r\nthreads. The center of the gill is called the _trama_. The trama in the\r\ncase of this plant is made up of threads with rather long cells. Toward\r\nthe outside of the trama the cells branch into short cells, which make a\r\nthin layer. This forms the _sub-hymenium_. The sub-hymenium in turn\r\ngives rise to long club-shaped cells which stand parallel to each other\r\nat right angles to the surface of the gill. The entire surface of the\r\ngill is covered with these club-shaped cells called _basidia_ (sing.\r\n_basidium_). Each of these club-shaped cells bears either two or four\r\nspinous processes called _sterígmata_ (sing. _sterígma_), and these in\r\nturn each bear a spore. All these points are well shown in Fig. 8. The\r\nbasidia together make up the _hymenium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9.--Polyporus borealis, showing wound at base of\r\nhemlock spruce caused by falling tree. Bracket fruit form of Polyporus\r\nborealis growing from wound. (1/15 natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=Wood Destroying Fungi.=--Many of the mushrooms, and their kind, grow on\r\nwood. A visit to the damp forest during the summer months, or during the\r\nautumn, will reveal large numbers of these plants growing on logs,\r\nstumps, from buried roots or rotten wood, on standing dead trunks, or\r\neven on living trees. In the latter case the mushroom usually grows from\r\nsome knothole or wound in the tree (Fig. 9). Many of the forms which\r\nappear on the trunks of dead or living trees are plants of tough or\r\nwoody consistency. They are known as shelving or bracket fungi, or\r\npopularly as \"fungoids\" or \"fungos.\" Both these latter words are very\r\nunfortunate and inappropriate. Many of these shelving or bracket fungi\r\nare perennial and live from year to year. They may therefore be found\r\nduring the winter as well as in the summer. The writer has found\r\nspecimens over eighty years old. The shelves or brackets are the fruit\r\nbodies, and consist of the pileus with the fruiting surface below. The\r\nfruiting surface is either in the form of gills like _Agaricus_, or it\r\nis honey-combed, or spinous, or entirely smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.--Polyporus borealis. Strands of mycelium\r\nextending radially in the wood of the same living hemlock spruce shown\r\nin Fig. 9. (Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=Mycelium of the Wood Destroying Fungi.=--While the fruit bodies are on\r\nthe outside of the trunk, the mycelium, or vegetative part of the\r\nfungus, is within the wood or bark. By stripping off the bark from\r\ndecaying logs where these fungi are growing, the mycelium is often found\r\nin great abundance. By tearing open the rotting wood it can be traced\r\nall through the decaying parts. In fact, the mycelium is largely if not\r\nwholly responsible for the rapid disintegration of the wood. In living\r\ntrees the mycelium of certain bracket fungi enters through a wound and\r\ngrows into the heart wood. Now the heart wood is dead and cannot long\r\nresist the entrance and destructive action of the mycelium. The mycelium\r\nspreads through the heart of the tree, causing it to rot (Fig. 10). When\r\nit has spread over a large feeding area it can then grow out through a\r\nwound or old knothole and form the bracket fruit body, in case the\r\nknothole or wound has not completely healed over so as to imprison the\r\nfungus mycelium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 2, FIGURE 11.--Mycelium of Agaricus melleus on\r\nlarge door in passage coal mine, Wilkesbarre, Pa. (1/20 natural size.)]\r\n\r\n=Fungi in Abandoned Coal Mines.=--Mushrooms and bracket fungi grow in\r\ngreat profusion on the wood props or doors in abandoned coal mines,\r\ncement mines, etc. There is here an abundance of moisture, and the\r\ntemperature conditions are more equable the year around. The conditions\r\nof environment then are very favorable for the rapid growth of these\r\nplants. They develop in midwinter as well as in summer.\r\n\r\n=Mycelium of Coal Mine Fungi.=--The mycelium of the mushrooms and\r\nbracket fungi grows in wonderful profusion in these abandoned coal\r\nmines. So far down in the moist earth the air in the tunnels or passages\r\nwhere the coal or rock has been removed is at all times nearly saturated\r\nwith moisture. This abundance of moisture, with the favorable\r\ntemperature, permits the mycelium to grow on the surface of the wood\r\nstructures as readily as within the wood.\r\n\r\nIn the forest, while the air is damp at times, it soon dries out to such\r\na degree that the mycelium can not exist to any great extent on the\r\nouter surface of the trunks and stumps, for it needs a great percentage\r\nof moisture for growth. The moisture, however, is abundant within the\r\nstumps or tree trunks, and the mycelium develops abundantly there.\r\n\r\nSo one can understand how it is that deep down in these abandoned mines\r\nthe mycelium grows profusely on the surface of doors and wood props.\r\nFigure 11 is from a flashlight photograph, taken by the writer, of a\r\nbeautiful growth on the surface of one of the doors in an abandoned coal\r\nmine at Wilkesbarre, Pa., during September, 1896. The specimen covered\r\nan area eight by ten feet on the surface of the door. The illustration\r\nshows very well the habit of growth of the mycelium. At the right is the\r\nadvancing zone of growth, marked by several fan-shaped areas. At the\r\nextreme edge of growth the mycelium presents a delicate fringe of the\r\ngrowing ends where the threads are interlaced uniformly over the entire\r\narea. But a little distance back from the edge, where the mycelium is\r\nolder, the threads are growing in a different way. They are now uniting\r\ninto definite strands. Still further back and covering the larger part\r\nof the sheet of mycelium lying on the surface of the door, are numerous\r\nlong, delicate tassels hanging downward. These were formed by the\r\nattempt on the part of the mycelium at numerous places to develop\r\nstrands at right angles to the surface of the door. There being nothing\r\nto support them in their attempted aerial flight, they dangle downward\r\nin exquisite fashion. The mycelium in this condition is very soft and\r\nperishable. It disappears almost at touch.\r\n\r\nOn the posts or wood props used to support the rock roof above, the\r\nmycelium grows in great profusion also, often covering them with a thick\r\nwhite mantle, or draping them with a fabric of elegant texture. From the\r\nupper ends of the props it spreads out over the rock roof above for\r\nseveral feet in circumference, and beautiful white pendulous tassels\r\nremind one of stalactites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12.--Agaricus campestris. Spore print. (Natural\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\n=Direction in Growth of Mushrooms.=--The direction of growth which these\r\nfungi take forms an interesting question for study. The common mushroom,\r\nthe _Agaricus_, the amanitas, and other central stemmed species grow\r\nusually in an upright fashion; that is, the stem is erect. The cap then,\r\nwhen it expands, stands so that it is parallel with the surface of the\r\nearth. Where the cap does not fully expand, as in the campanulate forms,\r\nthe pileus is still oriented horizontally, that is, with the gills\r\ndownward. Even in such species, where the stems are ascending, the upper\r\nend of the stem curves so that the cap occupies the usual position with\r\nreference to the surface of the earth. This is beautifully shown in the\r\ncase of those plants which grow on the side of trunks or stumps, where\r\nthe stems could not well grow directly upward without hugging close to\r\nthe side of the trunk, and then there would not be room for the\r\nexpansion of the cap. This is well shown in a number of species of\r\n_Mycena_.\r\n\r\nIn those species where the stem is sub-central, i. e., set toward one\r\nside of the pileus, or where it is definitely lateral, the pileus is\r\nalso expanded in a horizontal direction. From these lateral stemmed\r\nspecies there is an easy transition to the stemless forms which are\r\nsessile, that is, the shelving forms where the pileus is itself attached\r\nto the trunk, or other object of support on which it grows.\r\n\r\nWhere there is such uniformity in the position of a member or part of a\r\nplant under a variety of conditions, it is an indication that there is\r\nsome underlying cause, and also, what is more important, that this\r\nposition serves some useful purpose in the life and well being of the\r\nplant. We may cut the stem of a mushroom, say of the _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_, close to the cap, and place the latter, gills downward, on\r\na piece of white paper. It should now be covered securely with a small\r\nbell jar, or other vessel, so that no currents of air can get\r\nunderneath. In the course of a few hours myriads of the brown spores\r\nwill have fallen from the surface of the gills, where they are borne.\r\nThey will pile up in long lines along on either side of all the gills\r\nand so give us an impression, or spore print, of the arrangement of the\r\ngills on the under side of the cap as shown in Fig. 12. A white spore\r\nprint from the smooth lepiota (_L. naucina_) is shown in Fig. 13. This\r\nhorizontal position of the cap then favors the falling of the spores, so\r\nthat currents of air can scatter them and aid in the distribution of the\r\nfungus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13.--Lepiota naucina. Spore print. (Natural\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\nBut some may enquire how we know that there is any design in the\r\nhorizontal position of the cap, and that there is some cause which\r\nbrings about this uniformity of position with such entire harmony among\r\nsuch dissimilar forms. When a mushroom with a comparatively long stem,\r\nnot quite fully matured or expanded, is pulled and laid on its side, or\r\nheld in a horizontal position for a time, the upper part of the stem\r\nwhere growth is still taking place will curve upward so that the pileus\r\nis again brought more or less in a horizontal position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14.--Amanita phalloides. Plant turned to one side\r\nby directive force of gravity, after having been placed in a horizontal\r\nposition. (Natural size.)]\r\n\r\nIn collecting these plants they are often placed on their side in the\r\ncollecting basket, or on a table when in the study. In a few hours the\r\nyounger, long stemmed ones have turned upward again. The plant shown in\r\nFig. 14 (_Amanita phalloides_) was placed on its side in a basket for\r\nabout an hour. At the end of the hour it had not turned. It was then\r\nstood upright in a glass, and in the course of a few hours had turned\r\nnearly at right angles. The stimulus it received while lying in a\r\nhorizontal position for only an hour was sufficient to produce the\r\nchange in direction of growth even after the upright position had been\r\nrestored. This is often the case. Some of the more sensitive of the\r\nslender species are disturbed if they lie for only ten or fifteen\r\nminutes on the side. It is necessary, therefore, when collecting, if one\r\nwishes to keep the plants in the natural position for photographing, to\r\nsupport them in an upright position when they are being carried home\r\nfrom the woods.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this turning of the stem from the horizontal position, so\r\nthat the pileus will be brought parallel with the surface of the earth,\r\nis the stimulus from the force of gravity, which has been well\r\ndemonstrated in the case of the higher plants. That is, the force which\r\ncauses the stems of the higher plants to grow upward also regulates the\r\nposition of the cap of the pileated fungi. The reason for this is to be\r\nseen in the perfection with which the spores are shed from the surfaces\r\nof the gills by falling downward and out from the crevices between. The\r\nsame is true with the shelving fungi on trees, etc., where the spores\r\nreadily fall out from the pores of the honey-combed surface or from\r\nbetween the teeth of those sorts with a spiny under surface. If the caps\r\nwere so arranged that the fruiting surface came to be on the upper side,\r\nthe larger number of the spores would lodge in the crevices between the\r\nextensions of the fruiting surface. Singularly, this position of the\r\nfruiting surface does occur in the case of one genus with a few small\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nInteresting examples of the operation of this law are sometimes met with\r\nin abandoned coal mines, or more frequently in the woods. In abandoned\r\nmines the mushrooms sometimes grow from the mycelium which spreads out\r\non the rock roof overhead. The rock roof prevents the plant from growing\r\nupright, and in growing laterally the weight of the plant together with\r\nthe slight hold it can obtain on the solid rock causes it to hang\r\ndownward. The end of the stem then curves upward so that the pileus is\r\nbrought in a horizontal position. I have seen this in the case of\r\n_Coprinus micaceus_ several times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15.--Polyporus applanatus. From this view the\r\nlarger cap is in the normal position in which it grew on the standing\r\ntree. Turn one fourth way round to the right for position of the plant\r\nafter the tree fell. (1/6 natural size.)]\r\n\r\nIn the woods, especially in the case of the perennial shelving fungi,\r\ninteresting cases are met with. Figure 15 illustrates one of these\r\npeculiar forms of _Polyporus (Fomes) applanatus_. This is the species so\r\noften collected as a \"curio,\" and on account of its very white under\r\nsurface is much used for etching various figures. In the figure the\r\nlarger cap which is horizontal represents the position of the plant when\r\non the standing maple trunk. When the tree fell the shelf was brought\r\ninto a perpendicular position. The fungus continued to grow, but its\r\nsubstance being hard and woody it cannot turn as the mushroom can.\r\nInstead, it now grows in such a way as to form several new caps, all\r\nhorizontal, i. e., parallel with the surface of the earth, but\r\nperpendicular to the old shelf. If the page is turned one-fourth way\r\nround the figure will be brought in the position of the plant when it\r\nwas growing on the fallen log.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 3, FIGURE 16.--Dædalea ambigua. Upper right-hand\r\nshows normal plant in normal position when on tree. Upper left-hand\r\nshows abnormal plant with the large cap in normal position when growing\r\non standing tree. Lower plant shows same plant in position after the\r\ntree fell, with new caps growing out in horizontal direction. (Lower\r\nplant 1/2 natural size.)]\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting case is shown in the ambiguous trametes\r\n(_Trametes ambigua_), a white shelving fungus which occurs in the\r\nSouthern States. It is shown in Fig. 16. At the upper right hand is\r\nshown the normal plant in the normal position. At the upper left hand is\r\nshown an abnormal one with the large and first formed cap also in the\r\nnormal position as it grew when the tree was standing. When the tree\r\nfell the shelf was on the upper side of the log. Now numerous new caps\r\ngrew out from the edge as shown in the lower figure, forming a series of\r\nsteps, as it were, up one side and down the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGILL BEARING FUNGI: AGARICACEAE.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gill bearing fungi are known under the family _Agaricaceæ_, or\r\npopularly the agarics. They are distinguished by the fruiting area being\r\ndistributed over the surface of plate-like or knife-like extensions or\r\nfolds, usually from the under surface of the cap. These are known as the\r\ngills, or lamellæ, and they usually radiate from a common point, as from\r\nor near the stem, when the stem is present; or from the point of\r\nattachment of the pileus when the stem is absent. The plants vary widely\r\nin form and consistency, some being very soft and soon decaying, others\r\nturning into an inky fluid, others being tough and leathery, and some\r\nmore or less woody or corky. The spores when seen in mass possess\r\ncertain colors, white, rosy, brown or purple brown, black or ochraceous.\r\nWhile a more natural division of the agarics can be made on the basis of\r\nstructure and consistency, the treatment here followed is based on the\r\ncolor of the spores, the method in vogue with the older botanists. While\r\nthis method is more artificial, it is believed to be better for the\r\nbeginner, especially for a popular treatment. The sections will be\r\ntreated in the following order:\r\n\r\n  1. The purple-brown-spored agarics.\r\n  2. The black-spored agarics.\r\n  3. The white-spored agarics.\r\n  4. The rosy-spored agarics.\r\n  5. The ochre-spored agarics.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] For analytical keys to the families and genera see Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PURPLE-BROWN-SPORED AGARICS.[B]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of this subdivision are recognized at maturity by the\r\npurple-brown, dark brown or nearly black spores when seen in mass. As\r\nthey ripen on the surface of the gills the large number give the\r\ncharacteristic color to the lamellæ. Even on the gills the purple tinge\r\nof the brown spores can often be seen. The color is more satisfactorily\r\nobtained when the spores are caught in mass by placing the cap, gills\r\ndownward, on white paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGARICUS Linn. (PSALLIOTA Fr.)\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Agaricus_ the spores at maturity are either purple-brown\r\nin mass or blackish with a purple tinge. The annulus is present on the\r\nstem, though disappearing soon in some species, and the stem is easily\r\nseparated from the substance of the pileus. The gills are free from the\r\nstem, or only slightly adnexed. The genus is closely related to\r\n_Stropharia_ and the species of the two genera are by some united under\r\none genus (_Psalliota_, Hennings). Peck, 36th Report, N. Y. State Mus.,\r\np. 41--49, describes 7 species. Lloyd Mycol. Notes, No. 4, describes 8\r\nspecies. C. O. Smith, Rhodora, I: 161--164, 1899, describes 8 species.\r\n\r\n=Agaricus (Psalliota) campestris= Linn. =Edible.=--This plant has been\r\nquite fully described in the treatment of the parts of the mushroom, and\r\na recapitulation will be sufficient here. It grows in lawns, pastures,\r\nby roadsides, and even in gardens and cultivated fields. A few specimens\r\nbegin to appear in July, it is more plentiful in August, and abundantly\r\nso in September and October. It is 5--8 cm. high (2--3 inches), the cap\r\nis 5--12 cm. broad, and the stem 8--12 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is first rounded, then convex and more or less expanded.\r\nThe surface at first is nearly smooth, presenting a soft, silky\r\nappearance from numerous loose fibrils. The surface is sometimes more or\r\nless torn into triangular scales, especially as the plants become old.\r\nThe color is usually white, but varies more or less to light brown,\r\nespecially in the scaly forms, where the scales may be quite prominent\r\nand dark brown in color. Sometimes the color is brownish before the\r\nscales appear. The flesh is white. The =gills= in the young button stage\r\nare white. They soon become pink in color and after the cap is expanded\r\nthey quickly become purple brown, dark brown, and nearly black from the\r\nlarge number of spores on their surfaces. The gills are free from the\r\nstem and rounded behind (near the stem). The =stem= is white, nearly\r\ncylindrical, or it tapers a little toward the lower end. The flesh is\r\nsolid, though the central core is less firm. The =veil= is thin, white,\r\nsilky, and very frail. It is stretched as the cap expands and finally\r\ntorn so that it clings either as an annulus around the stem, or\r\nfragments cling around the margin of the cap. Since the =annulus= is so\r\nfrail it shrivels as the plant ages and becomes quite inconspicuous or\r\ndisappears entirely (see Figs. 1--7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 17.--Agaricus rodmani. Entirely white, showing\r\ndouble veil or ring. (Natural size.) Copyright.]\r\n\r\nVariations in the surface characters of the cap and stem have led some\r\nto recognize several varieties. This is known as the common mushroom and\r\nis more widely known and collected for food than any other. It is also\r\ncultivated in mushroom houses, cellars, caves, abandoned mines, etc.\r\n\r\n=Agaricus (Psalliota) rodmani= Pk. =Edible.=--Rodman's mushroom,\r\n_Agaricus rodmani_, grows in grassy places along streets of cities,\r\neither between the curbing and the walk, or between the curbing and the\r\npavement. It is entirely white or whitish and sometimes tinged with\r\nyellowish at the center of the pileus. The plants are 4--8 cm. high, the\r\ncap 5--8 cm. broad and the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 18.--Agaricus arvensis, fairy ring.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is rounded, and then convex, very firm, compact and thick,\r\nwith white flesh. The =gills= are crowded, first white, then pink, and\r\nin age blackish brown. The =stem= is very short, solid, nearly\r\ncylindrical, not bulbous. The =annulus= is quite characteristic, being\r\nvery thick, with a short limb, and double, so that it often appears as\r\ntwo distinct rings on the middle or lower part of the stem as shown in\r\nFig. 17. This form of the annulus is probably due to the fact that the\r\nthick part of the margin of the pileus during the young stage rests\r\nbetween the lower and upper part of the annulus, i. e., the thick veil\r\nis attached both to the inner and outer surface of the margin of the\r\ncap, and when it is freed by the expansion of the pileus it remains as a\r\ndouble ring. It is eagerly sought and much relished by several persons\r\nat Ithaca familiar with its edible qualities.\r\n\r\nThe plant closely resembles A. campestris var., edulis, Vittad. (See\r\nPlate 54, Bresadola, I Funghi Mangerecci e Velenosi, 1899) and is\r\nprobably the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 19.--Agaricus silvicola. White to cream color, or\r\nyellow stains.

One form is often white,\r\nor yellowish white, and often shows the yellow color when dried. The\r\nplant sometimes occurs in the form of a fairy ring as shown in Fig. 18.\r\nIt is 5--12 cm. high, the cap from 5--15 cm. broad and the stem 8--15\r\nmm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is smooth, quite thick and firm, convex to expanded. The\r\n=gills= are first white, then tinged with pink and finally blackish\r\nbrown. The =stem= is stout, nearly cylindrical, hollow, bulbous. The\r\nveil is double like that of _Agaricus placomyces_, the upper or inner\r\nlayer remaining as a membrane, while the lower or outer layer is split\r\nradially and remains in large patches on the lower surface of the upper\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 20.--Agaricus silvicola, showing radiately torn\r\nlower part of veil.

Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Agaricus (Psalliota) silvicola= Vittad. =Edible.=--The _Agaricus\r\nsilvicola_ grows in woods, groves, etc., on the ground, and has been\r\nfound also in a newly made garden in the vicinity of trees near the\r\nwoods. It is an attractive plant because of its graceful habit and the\r\ndelicate shades of yellow and white. It ranges from 10--20 cm. high, the\r\ncap is 5--12 cm. broad and the stem 6--10 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= becomes convex, and expanded or nearly flat, and often with\r\nan elevation or umbo in the center. It is thin, smooth, whitish and\r\noften tinged more or less deeply with yellow (sulfur or ochraceous) and\r\nis sometimes tinged with pink in the center. The flesh is whitish or\r\ntinged with pink. The =gills= when very young are whitish, then pink,\r\nand finally dark brown or blackish brown, much crowded, and distant from\r\nthe stem. The =stem= is long, nearly cylindrical, whitish, abruptly\r\nenlarged below into a bulb. It is often yellowish below, and especially\r\nin drying becomes stained with yellow. The =ring= is thin,\r\nmembranaceous, delicate, sometimes with broad, soft, floccose patches on\r\nthe under side. The ring usually appears single, but sometimes the\r\n=veil= is seen to be double, and the outer or lower portion tends to\r\nsplit radially as in _A. arvensis_ or _A. placomyces_. This is well\r\nshown in large specimens, and especially as the veil is stretched over\r\nthe gills as shown in Fig. 20.\r\n\r\nFrom the form of the plant as well as the peculiarities of the veil in\r\nthe larger specimens, it is related to _A. arvensis_ and _A.\r\nplacomyces_, more closely to the former. It occurs during mid-summer and\r\nearly autumn. Figure 10 is from plants (No. 1986 C. U. herbarium)\r\ncollected in open woods at Ithaca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 21.

It\r\noccurs sometimes in greenhouses. In one case reported by Peck it\r\nappeared in soil prepared for forcing cucumbers in a greenhouse in\r\nWashington, D. C.\r\n\r\nAccording to the description the =pileus= becomes convex or broadly\r\nexpanded, is covered with silky hairs and numerous minute scales. The\r\ncolor is whitish, grayish or dull reddish brown, the center being\r\nusually smooth and darker, while the flesh is white. The =gills= change\r\nfrom white to pinkish and blackish brown in age. The =stem= is long,\r\nnearly cylindrical or somewhat enlarged or bulbous at the base, first\r\nstuffed, then hollow, white. The =annulus= is thick, and the under side\r\nmarked by loose threads or scales.\r\n\r\nThis plant is said to differ from the common mushroom (_A. campestris_)\r\nin the more deeply hemispherical cap of the young plant, the hollow and\r\nsomewhat bulbous stem, and in the scales on the under side of the\r\nannulus. In fresh plants the flesh has also a flavor of almonds. It is\r\nclosely related to =A. silvaticus= Schaeff., p. 62, T. 242, Icones Fung.\r\nBav. etc., 1770, if not identical with it. _A. silvaticus_ has light\r\nochraceous or subrufescent scales on the cap, a strong odor, and occurs\r\nin gardens as well as in the woods.\r\n\r\n=Agaricus (Psalliota) fabaceus= Berk., was described in Hooker's London\r\nJournal of Botany, =6=: 314, 1847, from specimens collected in Ohio. The\r\nplant is white and is said to have a strong but not unpleasant odor.\r\n_Agaricus amygdalinus_ Curt., from North Carolina, and of which no\r\ndescription was published, was so named on account of the almond-like\r\nflavor of the plant. Dr. Farlow suggests (Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist.\r\n=26=: 356--358, 1894) that _A. fabaceus_, _amygdalinus_, and\r\n_subrufescens_ are identical.\r\n\r\n=Agaricus (Psalliota) placomyces= Pk. =Edible.=--The flat-cap mushroom,\r\n_Agaricus placomyces_ Pk., occurs in borders of woods or under trees\r\nfrom June to September. According to Peck it occurs in borders of\r\nhemlock woods, or under hemlock trees. At Ithaca it is not always\r\nassociated with hemlock trees. The largest specimens found here were in\r\nthe border of mixed woods where hemlock was a constituent. It has been\r\nfound near and under white pine trees in lawns, around the Norway spruce\r\nand under the Norway spruce. The plants are from 5--15 cm. high, the cap\r\nfrom 5--12 cm. in diameter, and the stem 6--8 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= when young is broadly ovate, then becomes convex or fully\r\nexpanded and flat in age, and is quite thin. The ground color is\r\nwhitish, often with a yellowish tinge, while the surface is ornamented\r\nwith numerous minute brownish scales which are scattered over a large\r\npart of the cap, but crowded or conjoined at the center into a large\r\ncircular patch. This gives to the plant with its shapely form a\r\nbeautiful appearance. In the young stage the entire surface of the\r\npileus is quite evenly brown. As it expands the outer brown portion is\r\ntorn asunder into numerous scales because the surface threads composing\r\nthis brown layer cease to grow. These scales are farther apart toward\r\nthe margin of the cap, because this portion of the cap always expands\r\nmore than the center, in all mushrooms. The =gills= are at first white,\r\nor very soon pink in color, and in age are blackish brown. Spores 5--8 ×\r\n3--4 µ.\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is nearly cylindrical, hollow or stuffed, white or whitish,\r\nsmooth, bulbous, and the bulb is sometimes tinged with yellow. The\r\n=veil= is very handsome, and the way in which the annulus is formed from\r\nit is very interesting. The veil is quite broad, and it is double, that\r\nis, it consists of two layers which are loosely joined by threads. In\r\nthe young stage the veil lies between the gills and the lower two-thirds\r\nof the stem. As the pileus expands the lower (outer part) layer of the\r\nveil is torn, often in quite regular radiating portions, as shown in\r\nFig. 22. An interesting condition of the veil is shown in the middle\r\nplant in Fig. 23. Here the outer or lower layer of the veil did not\r\nsplit radially, but remained as a tube surrounding the stem, while the\r\ntwo layers were separated, the inner one being still stretched over the\r\ngills. It is customary to speak of the lower part of the veil as the\r\nouter part when the cap is expanded and the veil is still stretched\r\nacross over the gills, while the upper portion is spoken of as the inner\r\nlayer or part. It is closely related to _A. arvensis_, and may represent\r\na wood inhabiting variety of that species.\r\n\r\n=Agaricus (Psalliota) comtulus= Fr.--This pretty little agaric seems to\r\nbe rather rare. It was found sparingly on several occasions in open\r\nwoods under pines at Ithaca, N. Y., during October, 1898. Lloyd reports\r\nit from Ohio (Mycolog. Notes, No. 56, Nov. 1899), and Smith from Vermont\r\n(Rhodora I, 1899). Fries' description (Epicrisis, No. 877) runs as\r\nfollows: \"Pileus slightly fleshy, convex, plane, obtuse, nearly smooth,\r\nwith appressed silky hairs, stem hollow, sub-attenuate, smooth, white to\r\nyellowish, annulus fugacious; gills free, crowded, broad in front, from\r\nflesh to rose color. In damp grassy places. Stem 2 inches by 2 lines, at\r\nfirst floccose stuffed. Pileus 1--1-1/2 inch diameter. Color from white\r\nto yellowish.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 24.--Agaricus comtulus (natural size, sometimes\r\nlarger). Cap creamy white with egg-yellow stains, smoky when older. Stem\r\nsame color; gills grayish, then rose, then purple brown. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe plants collected at Ithaca are illustrated in Fig. 24 from a\r\nphotograph of plants (No. 2879 C. U. herbarium). My notes on these\r\nspecimens run as follows: Plant 3--6 cm. high, pileus 1.5--3 cm. broad,\r\nstem 3--4 mm. in thickness. =Pileus= convex to expanded, fleshy, thin on\r\nthe margin, margin at first incurved, creamy white with egg yellow\r\nstains, darker on the center, in age somewhat darker to umber or\r\nfuliginous, moist when fresh, surface soon dry, flesh tinged with\r\nyellow. The =gills= are white when young, then grayish to pale rose, and\r\nfinally light purple brown, rounded in front, tapering behind (next the\r\nstem) and rounded, free from the stem, 4--5 mm. broad. =Basidia=\r\nclavate, 25--30 × 5--6 µ. =Spores= small, oval, 3--4 × 2--3 µ, in mass\r\nlight purple brown. The =stem= tapers above, is sub-bulbous below,\r\nyellowish and stained with darker yellowish threads below the annulus,\r\nhollow, fibrous, fleshy. The =veil= whitish stained with yellow,\r\ndelicate, rupturing irregularly, portions of it clinging to margin of\r\nthe pileus and portions forming a delicate ring. When parts of the plant\r\ncome in contact with white paper a blue stain is apt to be imparted to\r\nthe paper, resembling the reaction of iodine on starch. This peculiarity\r\nhas been observed also in the case of another species of _Agaricus_. The\r\nspecies is regarded with suspicion by some. I collected the plant also\r\nat Blowing Rock, N. C., in September, 1899. The caps of these specimens\r\nmeasure 4 cm. in diameter.\r\n\r\n=Agaricus diminutivus= Pk., is a closely related species. It is\r\ndistinguished chiefly by its somewhat larger size, and purplish to\r\nreddish brown hairs on the surface of the pileus, and by the somewhat\r\nlarger spores, which, however, are small. I have found it at Ithaca, the\r\nsurface of the pileus hairy, with beautiful, triangular, soft,\r\nappressed, purplish scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPHOLOMA Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Hypholoma_ the spores are purple brown, the gills attached\r\nto the stem, and the veil when ruptured clings to the margin of the cap\r\ninstead of to the stem, so that a ring is not formed, or only rarely in\r\nsome specimens. The stem is said to be continuous with the substance of\r\nthe cap, that is, it is not easily separated from it. The genus is\r\nclosely related to _Agaricus (Psalliota)_ and _Stropharia_, from both of\r\nwhich it differs in the veil not forming a ring, but clinging to the\r\nmargin of the cap. It further differs from _Agaricus_ in the stem being\r\ncontinuous with the substance of the cap, while _Stropharia_ seems to\r\ndiffer in this respect in different species. The plants grow both on the\r\nground and on wood. There are several species which are edible and are\r\nvery common. Peck gives a synopsis of six species in the 49th Report New\r\nYork State Mus., page 61, 1896, and Morgan describes 7 species in Jour.\r\nCinn. Soc. Nat. Hist. =6=: 113--115.\r\n\r\n=Hypholoma sublateritium= Schaeff. =Edible=, _bitter sometimes_. The\r\nname of this species is derived from the color of the cap, which is\r\nnearly a brick red color, sometimes tawny. The margin is lighter in\r\ncolor. The plants grow usually in large clusters on old stumps or\r\nfrequently appearing on the ground from buried portions of stumps or\r\nfrom roots. There are from six to ten, or twenty or more plants in a\r\nsingle cluster. A single plant is from 8--12 cm. high, the cap is 5--8\r\ncm. broad, and the stem 6--8 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, smooth, or sometimes with loose\r\nthreads from the veil, especially when young, even, dry. The flesh is\r\nfirm, whitish, and in age becoming somewhat yellowish. The =gills= are\r\nadnate, sometimes decurrent by a little tooth, rather crowded, narrow,\r\nwhitish, then dull yellow, and becoming dark from the spores, purplish\r\nto olivaceous. The =stem= usually tapers downward, is firm, stuffed,\r\nsmooth, or with remnants of the veil giving it a floccose scaly\r\nappearance, usually ascending because of the crowded growth. The =veil=\r\nis thin and only manifested in the young stage of the plant as a loose\r\nweft of threads. As the cap expands the veil is torn and adheres to the\r\nmargin, but soon disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 6, FIGURE 25.--Hypholoma sublateritium. Cap\r\nbrick-red or tawny. (Natural size, often larger.) Copyright.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 7, FIGURE 26.--Hypholoma appendiculatum (natural\r\nsize, often larger). White floccose scales on cap (var. coroniferum) and\r\nappendiculate veil; caps whitish or brown, tawny, or tinge of ochre.\r\nGills white, then purple-brown. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this plant is said by European writers to be bitter to the\r\ntaste, and it is regarded there as poisonous. This character seems to be\r\nthe only distinguishing one between the _Hypholoma sublateritium_\r\nSchaeff., of Europe, and the _Hypholoma perplexum_ Pk., of this country\r\nwhich is edible, and probably is identical with _H. sublateritium_. If\r\nthe plant in hand agrees with this description in other respects, and is\r\nnot bitter, there should be no danger in its use. According to\r\nBresadola, the bitter taste is not pronounced in _H. sublateritium_. The\r\ntaste probably varies as it does in other plants. For example, in\r\n_Pholiota præcox_, an edible species, I detected a decided bitter taste\r\nin plants collected in June, 1900. Four other persons were requested to\r\ntaste the plants. Two of them pronounced them bitter, while two did not\r\ndetect the bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of _Hypholoma sublateritium_, with delicate floccose\r\nscales in concentric rows near the margin of the cap, called _var.\r\nsquamosum_ Cooke. This is the plant illustrated in Fig. 25, from\r\nspecimens collected on rotting wood in the Cascadilla woods, Ithaca, N.\r\nY. It occurs from spring to autumn.\r\n\r\n_Hypholoma epixanthum_ Fr., is near the former species, but has a yellow\r\npileus, and the light yellow gills become gray, not purple.\r\n\r\n=Hypholoma appendiculatum= Bull. =Edible.=--This species is common\r\nduring late spring and in the summer. It grows on old stumps and logs,\r\nand often on the ground, especially where there are dead roots. It is\r\nscattered or clustered, but large tufts are not formed as in _H.\r\nsublateritium_. The plants are 6--8 cm. high, the cap 5--7 cm. broad,\r\nand the stem 4--6 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is ovate, convex to expanded, and often the margin\r\nelevated, and then the cap appears depressed. It is fleshy, thin,\r\nwhitish or brown, tawny, or with a tinge of ochre, and becoming pale in\r\nage and when dry. As the plant becomes old the pileus often cracks in\r\nvarious ways, sometimes splitting radially into several lobes, and then\r\nin other cases cracking into irregular areas, showing the white flesh\r\nunderneath. The surface of the pileus when young is sometimes sprinkled\r\nwith whitish particles giving it a mealy appearance. The =gills= are\r\nattached to the stem, crowded, becoming more or less free by breaking\r\naway from the stem, especially in old plants. They are white, then flesh\r\ncolored, brownish with a slight purple tinge. The =stem= is white,\r\nsmooth, or with numerous small white particles at the apex, becoming\r\nhollow. The =veil= is very delicate, white, and only seen in quite young\r\nplants when they are fresh. It clings to the margin of the cap for a\r\nshort period, and then soon disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 27.--Hypholoma appendiculatum (natural size),\r\nshowing appendiculate veil. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the pileus is covered with numerous white, delicate floccose\r\nscales, which give it a beautiful appearance, as in Fig. 26, from\r\nspecimens (No. 3185 C. U. herbarium), collected on the campus of Cornell\r\nUniversity among grass. The entire plant is very brittle, and easily\r\nbroken. It is tender and excellent for food. I often eat the caps raw.\r\n\r\n=Hypholoma candolleanum= Fr., occurs in woods on the ground, or on very\r\nrotten wood. It is not so fragile as _H. appendiculatum_ and the gills\r\nare dark violaceous, not flesh color as they are in _H. appendiculatum_\r\nwhen they begin to turn, and nearly free from the stem.\r\n\r\n=Hypholoma lacrymabundum= Fr.--This plant was found during September and\r\nOctober in wet grassy places in a shallow ditch by the roadside, and in\r\nborders of woods, Ithaca, N. Y., 1898. The plants are scattered or\r\nclustered, several often joined at the base of the stem. They are 4--8\r\ncm. high, the cap 2--5 cm. broad, and the stem 4--8 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 28.--Hypholoma lacrymabundum (natural size). Cap\r\nand stem tawny or light yellowish, with intermediate shades or shades of\r\number, surface with soft floccose scales. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, sometimes broadly umbonate in age,\r\nand usually with radiating wrinkles extending irregularly. On the\r\nsurface are silky or tomentose threads not much elevated from the\r\nsurface, and as the plant ages these are drawn into triangular scales\r\nwhich are easily washed apart by the rains. The color is tawny or light\r\nyellowish with intermediate shades, darker on the umbo and becoming\r\ndarker in age, sometimes umber colored, and stained with black,\r\nespecially after rains where the spores are washed on the pileus. The\r\nflesh is tinged with light yellow, or tawny, or brown, soft, and easily\r\nbroken. The =gills= are sinuate, adnate, somewhat ventricose, very\r\nrarely in abnormal specimens anastomosing near the margin of the pileus,\r\nat first light yellowish, then shading to umber and spotted with black\r\nand rusty brown as the spores mature, easily breaking away from the\r\nstipe, whitish on the edge. Drops of moisture sometimes are formed on\r\nthe gills. =Basidia= abruptly clavate, 30--35 × 10--12 µ. =Cystidia=\r\nhyaline, thin walled, projecting above the hymenium 40 µ, and 14--15 µ\r\nbroad. Spores black, purple tinged, broadly elliptical and somewhat\r\ncurved, 9--11 × 7--8 µ.\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is fleshy to fibrous, the same color as the pileus, floccose\r\nscaly more or less up to the veil, smooth or white pruinose above the\r\nveil, straight or curved, somewhat striate below.\r\n\r\nThe =veil= in young plants is hairy, of the same texture as the surface\r\nof the pileus, torn and mostly clinging to the margin of the pileus, and\r\ndisappearing with age.\r\n\r\nThe general habit and different stages of development as well as some of\r\nthe characters of the plant are shown in Fig. 28 (No. 4620 Cornell\r\nUniversity herbarium). The edible qualities of this plant have not been\r\ntested.\r\n\r\n=Hypholoma rugocephalum= Atkinson.--This interesting species grows in\r\ndamp places in woods. The plants are tufted or occur singly. They are\r\n8--12 cm. high, the cap 6--10 cm. broad, and the stem 6--10 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, and the margin at last revolute\r\n(upturned). The surface is marked by strong wrinkles (rugæ), which\r\nradiate irregularly from the center toward the margin. The pileus is\r\nbroadly umbonate, fleshy at the center and thinner toward the margin,\r\nthe flesh tinged with yellow, the surface slightly viscid, but not\r\nmarkedly so even when moist, smooth, not hairy or scaly, the thin margin\r\nextending little beyond ends of the gills. The color is tawny (near\r\nfulvus). The =gills= are adnate, slightly sinuate, 5--7 mm. broad, in\r\nage easily breaking away from the stem and then rounded at this end,\r\nspotted with the black spores, lighter on the edge. The =spores= are\r\nblack in mass (with a suggestion of a purple tinge), oval to broadly\r\nelliptical, inequilateral, pointed at each end, echinulate, or minutely\r\ntuberculate, 8--11 × 6--8 µ. The =basidia= are short, cylindrical;\r\n=cystidia= cylindrical, somewhat enlarged at the free end, hyaline,\r\ndelicate, thin-walled, in groups of two to six or more (perhaps this is\r\npartly responsible for the black spotted condition of the gills). The\r\n=stem= is cylindrical, even, somewhat bulbous, of the same color as the\r\npileus, but lighter above the annulus, irregular, smooth, fleshy,\r\nhollow, continuous with the substance of the pileus. The =annulus= is\r\nformed of a few threads, remnants of the veil, which are stained black\r\nby the spores. Figure 29 is from plants (No. 3202 C. U. herbarium)\r\ncollected near Ithaca, July 18, 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 8, FIGURE 29.--Hypholoma rugocephalum (7/8 natural\r\nsize). Cap tawny, gills purple black, spotted. Copyright.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTROPHARIA Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Stropharia_ has purple-brown spores, the gills are attached\r\nto the stem, and the veil forms a ring on the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 30.--Stropharia semiglobata (natural size). Cap\r\nand stem light yellow, viscid, gills brownish purple. Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Stropharia semiglobata= Batsch.--This species is rather common and\r\nwidely distributed, occurring in grassy places recently manured, or on\r\ndung. The plants are scattered or clustered, rarely two or three joined\r\nat the base. They are 5--12 cm. high, the cap 1--3 cm. broad, and the\r\nstems 2--4 mm. in thickness. The entire plant is light yellow, and\r\nviscid when moist, the gills becoming purplish brown, or nearly black.\r\nStevenson says it is regarded as poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is rounded, then hemispherical (semi-globate), smooth,\r\nfleshy at the center, thinner toward the margin, even, very viscid or\r\nviscous when moist, light yellow. The =gills= are squarely set against\r\nthe stem (adnate), broad, smooth, in age purplish brown to blackish, the\r\ncolor more or less clouded. The =spores= in mass, are brownish purple.\r\nThe =stem= is slender, cylindrical, becoming hollow, straight, even or\r\nbulbous below, yellowish, but paler at the apex where there are often\r\nparallel striæ, marks from the gills in the young stage. The stem is\r\noften viscid and smeared with the glutinous substance which envelopes\r\nthe plant when young, and from the more or less glutinous veil. The\r\n=ring= is glutinous when moist.\r\n\r\nFigure 30 is from plants (No. 4613 C. U. herbarium) collected on one of\r\nthe streets of Ithaca.\r\n\r\n=Stropharia stercoraria= Fr., is a closely related plant, about the same\r\nsize, but the pileus, first hemispherical, then becoming expanded and\r\nsometimes striate on the margin, while the stem is stuffed. The gills\r\nare said to be of one color and the ring floccose, viscose, and\r\nevanescent in drying. It occurs on dung, or in grassy places recently\r\nmanured.\r\n\r\n=Stropharia æruginosa= Curt., the greenish _Stropharia_, is from 6--8\r\ncm. high, and the pileus 5--7 cm. broad. The ground color is yellowish,\r\nbut the plant is covered with a greenish slime which tends to disappear\r\nwith age. It is found in woods and open places during late summer and in\r\nautumn. According to Stevenson it is poisonous.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] For analytical key to the genera see Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK-SPORED AGARICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spores are black in mass, not purple tinged. For analytical keys to\r\nthe genera see Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPRINUS Pers.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Coprinus_ are readily recognised from the black spores\r\nin addition to the fact that the gills, at maturity, dissolve into a\r\nblack or inky fluid. The larger species especially form in this way an\r\nabundance of the black fluid, so that it drops from the pileus and\r\nblackens the grass, etc., underneath the plant. In some of the smaller\r\nspecies the gills do not wholly deliquesce, but the cap splits on top\r\nalong the line of the longer gills, this split passing down through the\r\ngill, dividing it into two thin laminæ, which, however, remain united at\r\nthe lower edge. This gives a fluted appearance to the margin of the\r\npileus, which is very thin and membranaceous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 31.--Coprinus comatus, \"shaggy-mane,\" in lawn.]\r\n\r\nThe plants vary in size, from tiny ones to those which are several\r\ninches high and more than an inch broad. Their habitat (that is, the\r\nplace where they grow) is peculiar. A number of the species grow on dung\r\nor recently manured ground. From this peculiarity the genus received the\r\nname _Coprinus_ from the Greek word [Greek: kopros], meaning dung. Some\r\nof the species, however, grow on decaying logs, on the ground, on\r\nleaves, etc.\r\n\r\n=Coprinus comatus= Fr. =Edible.=--One of the finest species in this\r\ngenus is the shaggy-mane, or horse-tail mushroom, as it is popularly\r\ncalled. It occurs in lawns and other grassy places, especially in richly\r\nmanured ground. The plants sometimes occur singly, or a few together,\r\nbut often quite large numbers of them appear in a small area. They occur\r\nmost abundantly during quite wet weather, or after heavy rains, in late\r\nspring or during the autumn, and also in the summer. From the rapid\r\ngrowth of many of the mushrooms we are apt to be taken by surprise to\r\nsee them all up some day, when the day before there were none. The\r\nshaggy-mane often furnishes a surprise of this kind. In our lawns we are\r\naccustomed to a pretty bit of greensward with clumps of shrubbery, and\r\nhere and there the overhanging branches of some shade tree. On some fine\r\nmorning when we find a whole flock of these shaggy-manes, which have\r\nsprung up during the night, we can imagine that some such kind of a\r\nsurprise must have come to Browning when he wrote these words:\r\n\r\n    \"By the rose flesh mushroom undivulged\r\n      Last evening. Nay, in to-day's first dew\r\n    Yon sudden coral nipple bulged,\r\n      Where a freaked, fawn colored, flaky crew\r\n    Of toadstools peep indulged.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 32.--Coprinus comatus. \"Buttons,\" some in section\r\nshowing gill slits and hollow stem; colors white and black. (Natural\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\nThe plant is called shaggy-mane because of the very shaggy appearance of\r\nthe cap, due to the surface being torn up into long locks. The\r\nillustrations of the shaggy mane shown here represent the different\r\nstages of development, and the account here given is largely taken from\r\nthe account written by me in Bulletin 168 of the Cornell University Agr.\r\nExp. Station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 33.--Coprinus comatus (natural size).]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 32 are shown two buttons of the size when they are just ready to\r\nbreak through the soil. They appear mottled with dark and white, for the\r\nouter layer of fungus threads, which are dark brown, is torn and\r\nseparated into patches or scales, showing between the delicate meshes of\r\nwhite threads which lie beneath. The upper part of the button is already\r\nforming the cap, and the slight constriction about midway shows the\r\nlower boundary or margin of the pileus where it is still connected with\r\nthe undeveloped stem.\r\n\r\nAt the right of each of these buttons in the figure is shown a section\r\nof a plant of the same age. Here the parts of the plant, though still\r\nundeveloped, are quite well marked out. Just underneath the pileus layer\r\nare the gills. In the section one gill is exposed to view on either\r\nside. In the section of the larger button the free edge of the gill is\r\nstill closely applied to the stem, while in the small one the gills are\r\nseparated a short distance from the stems showing \"gill slits.\" Here,\r\ntoo, the connection of the margin of the pileus with the stem is still\r\nshown, and forms the veil. This kind of a veil is a marginal veil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 34.--Coprinus comatus (natural size). This one\r\nentirely white, none of the scales black tipped.]\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow even at this young stage, and a slender cord of\r\nmycelium extends down the center of the tube thus formed, as is shown in\r\nthe sections.\r\n\r\nThe plants are nearly all white when full grown. The brown scales, so\r\nclose together on the buttons, are widely separated except at the top or\r\ncenter of the pileus, where they remain close together and form a broad\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nA study of the different stages, which appear from the button stage to\r\nthe mature plant, reveals the cause of this change in color and the wide\r\nseparation of the dark brown scales. The threads of the outer layer of\r\nthe pileus, and especially those in the brown patches seen on the\r\nbuttons, soon cease to grow, though they are firmly entangled with the\r\ninner layers. Now the threads underneath and all through the plant, in\r\nthe gills and in the upper part of the stem, grow and elongate rapidly.\r\nThis pulls on the outer layer, tearing it in the first place into small\r\npatches, and causing them later to be more widely separated on the\r\nmature plant. Some of these scales remain quite large, while others are\r\ntorn up into quite small tufts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 35.--Coprinus comatus, sections of the plants in\r\nFig. 33 (natural size).]\r\n\r\nAs the plant ages, the next inner layers of the pileus grow less\r\nrapidly, so that the white layer beneath the brown is torn up into an\r\nintricate tangle of locks and tufts, or is frazzled into a delicate pile\r\nwhich exists here and there between well formed tufts. While all present\r\nthe same general characters there is considerable individual variation,\r\nas one can see by comparing a number of different plants. Figure 34\r\nshows one of the interesting conditions. There is little of the brown\r\ncolor, and the outer portion of the pileus is torn into long locks,\r\nquite evenly distributed and curled up at the ends in an interesting\r\nfashion which merits well the term \"shaggy.\" In others the threads are\r\nlooped up quite regularly into triangular tresses which appear to be\r\nknotted at the ends where the tangle of brown threads holds them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 36.--Coprinus comatus, early stages of\r\ndeliquescence; the ring is lying on the sod (natural size).]\r\n\r\nThere is one curious feature about the expansion of the pileus of the\r\nshaggy-mane which could not escape our attention. The pileus has become\r\nvery long while comparatively little lateral expansion has taken place.\r\nThe pileus has remained cylindrical or barrel-shaped, while in the case\r\nof the common mushroom the pileus expands into the form of an umbrella.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 37.--Coprinus comatus, later stage of\r\ndeliquescence, pileus becoming more expanded (natural size).]\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical or barrel-shaped pileus is characteristic of the\r\nshaggy-mane mushroom. As the pileus elongates the stem does also, but\r\nmore rapidly. This tears apart the connection of the margin of the\r\npileus with the base of the stem, as is plainly shown in Fig. 33. In\r\nbreaking away, the connecting portion or veil is freed both from the\r\nstem and from the margin of the pileus, and is left as a free, or loose,\r\nring around the stem. In the shaggy-mane the veil does not form a thin,\r\nexpanded curtain. It is really an annular outer layer of the button\r\nlying between the margin of the cap and the base of the stem. It becomes\r\nfree from the stem. As the stem elongates more rapidly than the cap, the\r\nlatter is lifted up away from the base of the stem. Sometimes the free\r\nring is left as a collar around the base of the stem, still loosely\r\nadherent to the superficial layer of the same, or it remains for a time\r\nmore or less adherent to the margin of the pileus as shown in the plant\r\nat the left hand in Fig. 33. It is often lifted higher up on the stem\r\nbefore it becomes free from the cap, and is then left dangling somewhere\r\non the stem, or it may break and fall down on the sod. In other\r\ninstances it may remain quite firmly adherent to the margin of the\r\npileus so that it breaks apart as the pileus in age expands somewhat. In\r\nsuch cases one often searches for some time to discover it clinging as a\r\nsterile margin of the cap. It is interesting to observe a section of the\r\nplants at this stage. These sections can be made by splitting the pileus\r\nand stem lengthwise through the middle line with a sharp knife, as shown\r\nin Fig. 35. Here, in the plant at the right hand, the \"cord\" of mycelium\r\nis plainly seen running through the hollow stem. The gills form a large\r\nportion of the plant, for they are very broad and lie closely packed\r\nside by side. They are nowhere attached to the stem, but at the upper\r\nend round off to the cap, leaving a well defined space between their\r\nends and the stem. The cap, while it is rather thick at the center, i.\r\ne., where it joins the stem, becomes comparatively thin where it spreads\r\nout over the gills. At this age of the plant the gills are of a rich\r\nsalmon color, i. e., before the spores are ripe, and the taste when raw\r\nis a pleasant nutty flavor, reminding one of the meat of fresh green\r\nhickory nuts. In a somewhat earlier stage the edges of all the gills are\r\nclosely applied to the stem which they surround. So closely are they\r\napplied to the stem in most cases that threads of mycelium pass from the\r\nstem to the edge of the gills. As the cap expands slightly in ageing,\r\nthese threads are torn asunder and the stem is covered with a very\r\ndelicate down or with flocculent particles which easily disappear on\r\nhandling or by the washing of the rains. The edges of the gills are also\r\nleft in a frazzled condition, as one can see by examining them with a\r\ngood hand lens.\r\n\r\nThe spores now begin to ripen and as they become black the color of the\r\ngills changes. At the same time the gills and the cap begin to dissolve\r\ninto an inky fluid, first becoming dark and then melting into a black\r\nliquid. As this accumulates it forms into drops which dangle from the\r\ncap until they fall away. This change takes place on the margin of the\r\ncap first, and advances toward the center, and the contrast of color, as\r\nthe blackening invades the rich salmon, is very striking. The cap now\r\nbegins to expand outward more, so that it becomes somewhat umbrella\r\nshaped. The extreme outer surface does not dissolve so freely, and the\r\nthin remnant curls upward and becomes enrolled on the upper side as the\r\ncap with wasted gills becomes nearly flat.\r\n\r\n=Coprinus atramentarius= (Bull.) Fr. =Edible.=--The ink-cap (_Coprinus\r\natramentarius_) occurs under much the same conditions as the\r\nshaggy-mane, and is sometimes found accompanying it. It is usually more\r\ncommon and more abundant. It springs up in old or newly made lawns which\r\nhave been richly manured, or it occurs in other grassy places. Sometimes\r\nthe plants are scattered, sometimes two or three in a cluster, but\r\nusually large clusters are formed where ten to twenty or more are\r\ncrowded closely together (Fig. 39). The stems are shorter than those of\r\nthe shaggy-mane and the cap is different in shape and color. The cap is\r\negg-shaped or oval. It varies in color from a silvery grey, in some\r\nforms, to a dark ashen grey, or smoky brown color in others. Sometimes\r\nthe cap is entirely smooth, as I have seen it in some of the silvery\r\ngrey forms, where the delicate fibres coursing down in lines on the\r\nouter surface cast a beautiful silvery sheen in the light. Other forms\r\npresent numerous small scales on the top or center of the cap which are\r\nformed by the cleavage of the outer surface here into large numbers of\r\npointed tufts. In others, the delicate tufts cover more or less the\r\nentire surface, giving the plant a coarsely granular aspect. This is\r\nperhaps the more common appearance, at least so far as my observation\r\ngoes. But not infrequently one finds forms which have the entire outer\r\nsurface of the cap torn into quite a large number of coarse scales, and\r\nthese are often more prominent over the upper portion. Fine lines or\r\nstriations mark also the entire surface of all the forms, especially\r\ntoward the margin, where the scales are not so prominent. The marginal\r\nhalf of the cap is also frequently furrowed more or less irregularly,\r\nand this forms a crenate or uneven edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 9, FIGURE 38. Coprinus comatus, drops of inky fluid\r\nabout to fall from wasted pileus (natural size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 10, FIGURE 39.--Coprinus atramentarius, nearly\r\nsmooth form, gray color (natural size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 40.--Coprinus atramentarius, scaly form (natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\nThe annulus or ring on the stem of the ink-cap is very different from\r\nthat of the shaggy-mane. It forms an irregularly zigzag elevated line of\r\nthreads which extend around the stem near the base. It is well shown in\r\nFig. 41 as a border line between the lower scaly end of the stem and the\r\nsmooth white upper part. It is formed at the time of the separation of\r\nthe margin of the cap from the stem, the connecting fibres being pulled\r\noutward and left to mark the line of junction, while others below give\r\nthe scaly appearance. It is easily effaced by rough handling or by the\r\nwashing of the rains. A section of a plant is illustrated by a\r\nphotograph in Fig. 42. On either side of the stem is shown the layer of\r\nfibres which form the annulus, and this layer is of a different texture\r\nfrom that of the stem. The stem is hollow as seen here also. In this\r\nfigure one can see the change in color of the gills just at the time\r\nwhen they begin to deliquesce. This deliquescence proceeds much in the\r\nsame way as in the shaggy-mane, and sometimes the thin remnant of the\r\ncap expands and the margin is enrolled over the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 41.--Coprinus atramentarius, showing annulus as\r\nborder line between scaly and smooth part of the stem (natural size).]\r\n\r\n=Coprinus micaceus= (Bull.) Fr. =Edible.=--The glistening coprinus\r\nreceived its name because of the very delicate scales which often cover\r\nthe surface of the cap, and glisten in the light like particles of mica.\r\nThis plant is very common during the spring and early summer, though it\r\ndoes appear during the autumn. It occurs about the bases of stumps or\r\ntrees or in grassy or denuded places, from dead roots, etc., buried in\r\nthe soil. It occurs in dense tufts of ten to thirty or more individuals;\r\nsometimes as many as several hundred spring up from the roots of a dead\r\ntree or stump along the streets or in lawns, forming large masses. More\r\nrarely it occurs on logs in the woods, and sometimes the plants are\r\nscattered in lawns. From the different habits of the plant it is\r\nsometimes difficult to determine, especially where the individuals are\r\nmore or less scattered. However, the color, and the markings on the cap,\r\nespecially the presence of the small shining scales when not effaced,\r\ncharacterize the plant so that little difficulty is experienced in\r\ndetermining it when one has once carefully noted these peculiarities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 42.--Coprinus atramentarius, section of one of the\r\nplants in Fig. 41 (natural size).]\r\n\r\nFigure 43 is from a group of three young individuals photographed just\r\nas the margin of the pileus is breaking away from the lower part of the\r\nstem, showing the delicate fibrous ring which is formed in the same way\r\nas in _Coprinus atramentarius_. The ring is much more delicate and is\r\nrarely seen except in very young specimens which are carefully collected\r\nand which have not been washed by rains. The mature plants are 8--10 cm.\r\nhigh (3--4 inches), and the cap varies from 2--4 cm. in diameter. The\r\nstem is quite slender and the cap and gills quite thin as compared with\r\nthe shaggy-mane and ink-cap. The gills are not nearly so crowded as they\r\nare in the two other species. The cap is tan color, or light buff, or\r\nyellowish brown. Except near the center it is marked with quite\r\nprominent striations which radiate to the margin. These striations are\r\nminute furrows or depressed lines, and form one of the characters of the\r\nspecies, being much more prominent than on the cap of the ink-cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 43.--Coprinus micaceus, young stage showing\r\nannulus, on the cap the \"mica\" particles (natural size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 44.--Coprinus micaceus, plants natural size, from\r\nfloor of coal mine at Wilkesbarre. Caps tan color. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nIn wet weather this coprinus melts down into an inky fluid also, but in\r\nquite dry weather it remains more or less firm, and sometimes it does\r\nnot deliquesce at all, but dries with all parts well preserved, though\r\nmuch shrunken of course, as is the case with all the very fleshy fungi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 11, FIGURE 45.--Panæolus retirugis, group of plants\r\nfrom lawn along street, showing veil in young plants at the left, which\r\nbreaks into V-shaped loops and clings to margin of the cap.

The margin extends beyond the gills, and the gills\r\nare not uniform in color, being clouded or spotted with black and brown\r\ncolors, the edge of the gills often white in contrast. The spores are\r\nblack. The stem is usually smooth, sometimes floccose scaly, often long,\r\nfirm, generally hollow. The veil is of interwoven threads, sometimes\r\nquite compact, especially when the plants are young. Peck, 23rd Report\r\nN. Y. State Mus., p. 10 et seq., gives a synopsis of five species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 46.--Panæolus retirugis, section of caps showing\r\nform and position of gills (natural size).]\r\n\r\n=Panæolus retirugis= Fr.--The color of this plant is not attractive, but\r\nit is one of the most beautiful species I have studied, if one regards\r\nform and the general features in its development. It is said to occur on\r\ndung. I have found it in lawns or grassy places, especially freshly made\r\nlawns or greenswards which have been heavily manured. The illustrations\r\nin Figs. 45--48 were made from photographs of plants which grew in a\r\nnewly made boulevard along Buffalo street, Ithaca, N. Y. (No. 2356 C. U.\r\nherbarium). The plants are from 7--15 cm. high, the cap from 1--3 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and the stem is 3--4 mm. in thickness. The size of the plants\r\nvaries greatly according to the environment, being larger in moist soil\r\nand wet weather and smaller in dry soil and dry weather. It occurs in\r\nlate spring and during the summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 47.--Panæolus retirugis, showing rugose character\r\nof cap in left-hand plant (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is oval to ovate and conic, and in some cases it becomes\r\nmore or less expanded, but never, so far as I have observed, does it\r\nbecome depressed or even plane. In wet weather it is usually at first\r\ndark smoky in color, viscid, becoming grayish in age, and as the pileus\r\ndries it becomes shining. In lighter colored forms the pileus is at\r\nfirst light leather color to cream color. Toward the center of the\r\npileus are irregular wrinkles or shallow pits, the wrinkles anastomosing\r\nmore or less, and it is because of this character of the surface of the\r\npileus that the plant receives its specific name. During dry weather\r\nthere is a tendency for the pileus to crack, separating the dark color\r\nof the surface into patches showing the white flesh beneath. The pileus\r\nis often umbonate or gibbous, and the center is often darker than the\r\nmargin. The pileus in rare cases is entirely white. The =gills= are\r\nadnate, broad in the middle, and in the more expanded forms as the gills\r\nseparate more and more from the stem there is a tendency for them to\r\nbecome somewhat triangular. The =spores= are black in mass, are\r\nelliptical or short fusiform, and measure from 10--12 × 15--18 µ. The\r\n=stem= is cylindrical, sometimes tortuous, smoky gray, light reddish\r\nbrown, or paler, sometimes entirely white, the lighter forms of the stem\r\naccompanying the light forms of the pileus; cartilaginous in texture,\r\nbecoming hollow, always darker below and paler above, smooth, granulate\r\nwith minute darker points, bulbous. The =veil= is very prominent and\r\nstout when the plant is young, and extends from the margin of the pileus\r\nto the stem when the plant is very young and the stem has not elongated.\r\nAs the stipe elongates the veil separates from the stipe as a ring, and\r\nthen, as the pileus expands, it is broken quite regularly into short\r\nsegments which become arranged regularly around the margin of the pileus\r\nin the form of the letter V, which gives a beautiful appearance to this\r\nstage of the plant. It is only when the plants are fresh and moist that\r\nthis condition of the veil can be seen, for on drying the veil\r\ncollapses. Water is sometimes caught under the veil before the pileus\r\nseparates far from the stem, and the spores falling thus float against\r\nthe stem at this point and make a dark ring around the stem, which,\r\nhowever, should not be mistaken for the annulus. In no case was the veil\r\nobserved to cling to the stem, and many plants have been observed to see\r\nif this variation might present itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 48.--Panæolus retirugis, showing cracked surface\r\nof cap in the left-hand plant, also in same plant the ring mark of black\r\nspores which lodged before veil ruptured, in other plants showing well\r\nthe V-shaped loops of veil on margin of cap (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of the veil in clinging to the margin of the pileus\r\nhas led Hennings to place the plant in Karsten's genus (Engler and\r\nPrantl, Pflanzenfamilien) _Chalymotta_, as _Chalymotta retirugis_. The\r\nplants have several times been eaten raw by me, and while they have a\r\nnutty flavor and odor, the taste is not entirely agreeable in this\r\ncondition, because of the accompanying slimy sensation.\r\n\r\nA number of smaller species, among them =P. fimicola= Fr., and =P.\r\npapilionaceus= Fr., occur in similar places. =Panæolus solidipes= Pk.,\r\nis a large species with a long, solid stem, growing on dung. =Psilocybe\r\nfoenisecii=, abundant in lawns and grassy places during late spring\r\nand summer, resembles a Panæolus. The cap shows zones of light and dark\r\ncolor, due to different amounts of water, which disappear as the plant\r\nmatures. It belongs to the purple-brown-spored agarics.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSATHYRELLA Fr.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, membranaceous, striate, the margin not extending\r\nbeyond the edge of the gills, and when young the margin of the pileus\r\nlies straight against the stem. The gills are black to fuliginous, of a\r\nuniform color, i. e., not spotted as in _Panæolus_ and _Anellaria_. The\r\nspores are black. The plants are all fragile. Only one species is\r\nmentioned here. In appearance the species are like _Psathyra_ of the\r\npurple-brown-spored agarics, but much thinner. Peck describes three\r\nspecies in the 23d Report N. Y. State Mus., p. 102 et seq. Only one\r\nspecies is described here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 49.--Psathyrella disseminata (natural size), caps\r\nwhitish, grayish, or grayish-brown. Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Psathyrella disseminata= Pers.--This is a very common and widely\r\ndistributed species, appearing from late spring until late autumn. It\r\nsometimes appears in greenhouses throughout the year. The plants are\r\n2--3 cm. high, and the caps 6--10 mm. broad. The plants are crowded in\r\nlarge tufts, often growing on decaying wood, but also on the ground,\r\nespecially about much decayed stumps, but also in lawns and similar\r\nplaces, where buried roots, etc., are decaying. They resemble small\r\nspecimens of a _Coprinus_.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is whitish or gray, or grayish brown, very thin, oval, then\r\nbell-shaped, minutely scaly, becoming smooth, prominently silicate or\r\nplicate, plaited. The =gills= are adnate, broad, white, gray, then\r\nblack. The =spores= are black, oblong, 8 × 6 µ. The =stem= is very\r\nslender, becoming hollow, often curved. The entire plant is very\r\nfragile, and in age becomes so soft as to suggest a _Coprinus_ in\r\naddition to the general appearance. Figure 49 is from plants collected\r\non decaying logs at Ithaca.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOMPHIDIUS Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Gomphidius_ has a slimy or glutinous universal veil\r\nenveloping the entire plant when young, and for a time is stretched over\r\nthe gills as the pileus is expanding. The gills are somewhat\r\nmucilaginous in consistency, are distant and decurrent on the stem. The\r\ngills are easily removed from the under surface of the pileus in some\r\nspecies by peeling off in strips, showing the imprint of the gills\r\nbeneath the projecting portions of the pileus, which extended part way\r\nbetween the laminæ of the gills. The spores in some species are\r\nblackish, and for this reason the genus has been placed by many with the\r\nblack-spored agarics, while its true relationship is probably with the\r\ngenus _Hygrophorus_ or _Paxillus_.\r\n\r\n=Gomphidius nigricans= Pk.--The description given by Peck for this plant\r\nin the 48th Report, p. 12, 1895, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Pileus convex, or nearly plane, pale, brownish red, covered with a\r\ntough gluten, which becomes black in drying, flesh firm, whitish;\r\nlamellæ distant, decurrent, some of them forked, white, becoming smoky\r\nbrown, black in the dried plant; stem subequal, longer than the diameter\r\nof the pileus, glutinous, solid, at first whitish, especially at the\r\ntop, soon blackish by the drying of the gluten, whitish within, slightly\r\ntinged with red toward the base; spores oblong fusoid, 15--25 µ long,\r\n6--7 µ broad. Pileus 1--2 inches broad; stem 1.5--2.5 inches long, 2--4\r\nlines thick.\"\r\n\r\n\"This species is easily known by the blackening gluten which smears both\r\npileus and stem, and even forms a veil by which the lamellæ in the young\r\nplant are concealed. In the dried state the whole plant is black.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under pine trees, Westport, September.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 50.--Gomphidius nigricans.

Copyright.]\r\n\r\nWhat appears to be the same plant was collected by me at Blowing Rock,\r\nN. C., under a pine tree, in September, 1899 (No. 3979 C. U. herbarium).\r\n\r\nThe notes taken on the fresh plant are as follows:\r\n\r\nVery viscid, with a thick, tough viscid cuticle, cortina or veil viscid,\r\nand collapsing on the stem, forming coarse, walnut-brown or dark\r\nvinaceous reticulations, terminating abruptly near the gills, or\r\nreaching them.\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is white underneath the slimy veil covering, tough, fibrous,\r\ncontinuous, and not separable from the hymenophore, tapering below.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, the very thin margin somewhat incurved, disk\r\nexpanded, uneven, near the center cracked into numerous small viscid\r\nbrownish areoles; pileus flesh color, flesh same color except toward the\r\ngills. Gills dark drab gray, arcuate, distant, decurrent, many of them\r\nforked, separating easily from the hymenophore, peeling off in broad\r\nsheets, and leaving behind corresponding elevations of the hymenophore\r\nwhich extended between the laminæ of the lamellæ. Pileus 7 cm. in\r\ndiameter; stem 4--5 cm. long by 2 cm. diameter.\r\n\r\nIn drying, the entire plant as well as the gluten becomes black, on the\r\npileus a shining black.\r\n\r\nThe =spores= are rusty to dark brown, or nearly black, fusoid or oblong,\r\nand measure 15--22 × 5--6 µ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 51.--Gomphidius nigricans. Under view with portion\r\nof gills stripped off from hymenophore, showing forked character of\r\ngills (natural size).

The\r\ndescriptions say nothing as to the appearance of the dried plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-SPORED AGARICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spores are white in mass, or sometimes with a faint yellowish or\r\nlilac tinge. For analytical keys to the genera see Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMANITA Pers.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Amanita_ has both a volva and a veil; the spores are white,\r\nand the stem is easily separable from the cap. In the young stage the\r\nvolva forms a universal veil, that is, a layer of fungus tissue which\r\nentirely envelops the young plant. In the button stage, where this\r\nenvelope runs over the cap, it is more or less free from it, that is, it\r\nis not \"concrete\" with the surface of the pileus. As the pileus expands\r\nand the stem elongates, the volva is ruptured in different ways\r\naccording to the species. In some the volva splits at the apex and is\r\nleft as a \"cup\" at the base of the stem. In others it splits circularly,\r\nthat is, transversely across the middle, the lower half forming a\r\nshallow cup with a very narrow rim, or in other cases it is closely\r\nfitted against the stem, while the upper half remains on the cap and is\r\nbroken up into patches or warts. In still other cases the volva breaks\r\nirregularly, and only remnants of it may be found on either the base of\r\nthe stem or on the pileus. For the various conditions one must consult\r\nthe descriptions of the species. The genus is closely related to\r\n_Lepiota_, from which it is separated by the volva being separate from\r\nthe pileus. This genus contains some of the most deadly poisonous\r\nmushrooms, and also some of the species are edible. Morgan, Jour. Mycol.\r\n=3=: 25--33, describes 28 species. Peck, 33d Report N. Y. State Mus.,\r\npp. 38--49, describes 14 species. Lloyd, A Compilation of the Volvæ of\r\nthe U. S., Cincinnati, 1898, gives a brief synopsis of our species.\r\n\r\n=Amanita muscaria= Linn. =Poisonous.=--This plant in some places is\r\npopularly known as the fly agaric, since infusions of it are used as a\r\nfly poison. It occurs during the summer and early autumn. It grows along\r\nroadsides near trees, or in groves, and in woods, according to some\r\npreferring a rather poor gravelly soil. It attains its typical form\r\nusually under these conditions in groves or rather open woods where the\r\nsoil is poor. It is a handsome and striking plant because of the usually\r\nbrilliant coloring of the cap in contrast with the white stems and\r\ngills, and the usually white scales on the surface. It usually ranges\r\nfrom 10--15 cm. high, and the cap from 8--12 cm. broad, while the stem\r\nis 1--1.5 cm. in thickness, or the plant may be considerably larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 12, FIGURE 52.--Amanita muscaria, \"buttons,\"\r\nshowing different stages of rupture of the volva or universal veil, and\r\nformation of inner veil (natural size).

Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= passes from convex to expanded and nearly flat in age, the\r\nmargin when mature is marked by depressed lines forming parallel\r\nstriations, and on the surface are numbers of scattered floccose or\r\nrather compact scales, formed from the fragments of the upper part of\r\nthe volva or outer veil. These scales are usually white in color and are\r\nquite easily removed, so that old plants are sometimes quite free from\r\nthem. The scales are sometimes yellowish in color. The color of the\r\npileus varies from yellow to orange, or even red, the yellow color being\r\nmore common. Late in the season the color is paler, and in old plants\r\nalso the color fades out, so that white forms are sometimes found. The\r\nflesh is white, sometimes yellowish underneath the cuticle. The =gills=\r\nin typical forms are white, in some forms accredited to this species\r\nthey are yellowish. The =stem= is cylindrical, hollow, or stuffed when\r\nyoung, and enlarged below into a prominent bulb. It is white, covered\r\nwith loose floccose scales, or more or less lacerate or torn, and the\r\nlower part of the stem and upper part of the bulb are marked usually by\r\nprominent concentric scales forming interrupted rings. These are formed\r\nby the splitting of the outer veil or volva, and form the remnants of\r\nthe volva present on the base of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe main features in the development of the plant are shown in Figs.\r\n52--54, where a series from the button stage to the mature plant is\r\nrepresented. In the youngest specimens the outline of the bulb and the\r\nyoung convex or nearly globose cap are only seen, and these are covered\r\nwith the more or less floccose outer veil or volva. The fungus threads\r\ncomposing this layer cease to grow, and with the expansion of the cap\r\nand the elongation of the stem, the volva is torn into patches. The\r\nupper and lower surface of the inner veil is attached to the edge of the\r\ngills and to the outer surface of the stem by loose threads, which are\r\ntorn asunder as the pileus expands. Floccose scales are thus left on the\r\nsurface of the stem below the annulus, as in the left hand plant of Fig.\r\n53. The veil remains attached longer to the gills and is first separated\r\nfrom the stem. Again, as in the right hand plant, it may first be\r\nseparated from the gills when it is later ripped up from the stem.\r\n\r\nThe fly agaric is one of the well known poisonous species and is very\r\nwidely distributed in this country, as well as in other parts of the\r\nworld. In well developed forms there should be no difficulty in\r\ndistinguishing it from the common mushroom by even a novice. Nor should\r\nthere be difficulty in distinguishing it from the royal agaric, or\r\nCæsar's agaric (_Amanita cæsarea_), by one who has become reasonably\r\nfamiliar with the characters and appearance of the two. But small and\r\ndepauperate specimens of the two species run so nearly together in form,\r\ncolor, and surface characters, that it becomes a matter of some\r\ndifficulty for even an expert to distinguish them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 54.--Amanita muscaria. View of upper side of cap\r\n(natural size). Colors as in Fig. 53. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nFigures 52--54 are from plants (No. 2065 C. U. herbarium) collected in\r\nan open woods near Ithaca. For the poisonous property of the plant see\r\nChapter XX.\r\n\r\n=Amanita frostiana= Pk. =Poisonous.=--According to Dr. Peck, who\r\npublished the first description of this plant, it grows in company with\r\n_Amanita muscaria_, but seems to prefer more dense woods, especially\r\nmixed or hemlock woods, and occurs from June to October. The plant is\r\n5--8 cm. high, the caps 2--5 cm. broad, and the stems 3--6 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is \"convex to expanded, bright orange or yellow, warty,\r\nsometimes nearly or quite smooth, striate on the margin; =lamellæ=\r\nwhite or tinged with yellow; =stem= white or yellowish, stuffed, bearing\r\na slight, sometimes evanescent annulus, bulbous at the base, the bulb\r\n_slightly margined_ by the volva; spores globose,\" 7.5--10 µ in\r\ndiameter. He notes that it appears like a small form of _A. muscaria_,\r\nto which it was first referred as _var. minor_,--\"The only characters\r\nfor distinguishing it are its small size and its globose spores.\" It is\r\nnear _A. muscaria var. puella_ Pers.\r\n\r\nI have several times found this plant in the Adirondack mountains, N.\r\nY., and Ithaca, and also at Blowing Rock, N. C. The volva is often\r\nyellowish, so that the warts on the pileus are also yellow, and\r\nsometimes the only remnants of the volva on the base of the stem are\r\nyellow or orange particles. The annulus is also frequently yellow. In\r\nour plants, which seem to be typical, the spores are nearly globose,\r\nvarying to oval, and with the minute point where the spore was attached\r\nto the sterigma at the smaller end, the spores usually being finely\r\ngranular, 6--9 µ in diameter, and rarely varying towards short\r\nelliptical, showing a tendency to approach the shape of the spores of\r\n_A. muscaria_. The species as I have seen it is a very variable one,\r\nlarge forms being difficult to separate from _A. muscaria_, on the one\r\nhand, and others difficult to separate from the depauperate forms of _A.\r\ncæsarea_. In the latter, however, the striæ are coarser, though the\r\nyellow color may be present only on portions of the pileus. The spores\r\nof _A. cæsarea_ are from globose to oval, ovate or short elliptical, the\r\nglobose ones often agreeing in size with the spores of _A. frostiana_,\r\nbut they usually contain a prominent oil drop or \"nucleus,\" often nearly\r\nfilling the spore. In some specimens of _A. frostiana_ the spores are\r\nquite variable, being nearly globose, ovate to elliptical, approaching\r\nthe spores of _A. muscaria_. These intermediate forms should not in\r\nthemselves lead one to regard all these three species as representing\r\nvariations in a single variable species. With observations in the field\r\nI should think it possible to separate them.\r\n\r\n=Amanita phalloides= Fr. =Deadly Poisonous.=--The _Amanita phalloides_\r\nand its various forms, or closely related species, are the most\r\ndangerous of the poisonous mushrooms. For this reason the _A.\r\nphalloides_ is known as the _deadly agaric_, or _deadly amanita_. The\r\nplant is very variable in color, the forms being pure white, or\r\nyellowish, green, or olive to umber. Variations also occur in the way in\r\nwhich the volva ruptures, as well as in the surface characters of the\r\nstem, and thus it is often a difficult matter to determine whether all\r\nthese forms represent a single variable species or whether there are\r\nseveral species, and if so, what are the limits of these species.\r\nWhether these are recognized as different forms of one species or as\r\ndifferent species, they are all very poisonous. The plant usually occurs\r\nin woods or along the borders of woods. It does, however, sometimes\r\noccur in lawns. It varies from 6--20 cm. high, the cap from 3--10 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem 6--10 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 55.--Amanita phalloides, white form, showing cap,\r\nstem, ring, and cup-like volva with a free, prominent limb (natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, viscid or slimy when moist, smooth, that is, not\r\nstriate, orbicular to bell-shaped, convex and finally expanded, and in\r\nold specimens more or less depressed by the elevation of the margin. The\r\ncap is often free from any remnants of the volva, while in other cases\r\nportions of the volva or outer veil appear on the surface of the cap in\r\nrather broad patches, or it may be broken up into a number of smaller\r\nones quite evenly distributed over the surface of the cap. The presence\r\nor absence of these scales on the cap depends entirely on the way in\r\nwhich the volva ruptures. When there is a clean rupture at the apex the\r\npileus is free from scales, but if portions of the apex of the volva are\r\ntorn away they are apt to remain on the cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 14, FIGURE 56.--Amanita phalloides, brownish,\r\number, or olive-brown form (natural size). Caps brownish or whitish, and\r\nstreaked with brown, scales white, gills and stem white, stem slowly\r\nturning dull brown where bruised. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe white form is common in this country, and so is the olive or umber\r\nform. The yellow form is rarer. Sometimes there is only a tinge of\r\nyellow at the center of the white pileus, while in other cases a large\r\npart of the pileus may be yellow, a deeper shade usually on the center.\r\nThe green form is probably more common in Europe than in this country.\r\nThe olive form varies considerably also in the depth of the color,\r\nusually darker on the center and fading out to light olive or gray, or\r\nwhitish, on the margin. In other cases the entire pileus may be dark\r\nolive or umber color. The =gills= in all the forms are white, and free\r\nfrom the stem or only joined by a narrow line. The stem is stuffed when\r\nyoung, but in age is nearly or quite hollow. It is cylindrical, 6--20\r\ncm. long × 6--12 mm. in thickness. In the larger specimens the bulb is\r\nquite prominent and abrupt, while in the smaller specimens it is not\r\nalways proportionally so large. The =stem= is usually smooth and the\r\ncolor is white, except in the dark forms, when it is dingy or partakes\r\nmore or less of the color of the pileus, though much lighter in shade.\r\nThere is a tendency in these forms to a discoloration of the stem where\r\nhandled or bruised, and this should caution one in comparing such forms\r\nwith the edible _A. rubescens_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 57.--Amanita phalloides, volva circumscissile, cap\r\nscaly, limb of volva not prominent, cap dark, scales white (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no part of the plant is more variable than the outer veil or\r\nvolva. Where the volva is quite thick and stout it usually splits at the\r\napex, and there is a prominent free limb, as shown in Fig. 55. Sometimes\r\nthin portions of the volva are caught, and remain on the surface of the\r\npileus. But when the volva is thinner and of a looser texture, it splits\r\ntransversely about the middle, circumscissile, and all or a large part\r\nof the upper half of the volva then clings to the cap, and is separated\r\ninto patches. Between this and the former condition there seem to be all\r\ngradations. Some of these are shown in Fig. 56, which is from a\r\nphotograph of dark olive and umber forms, from plants collected in the\r\nBlue Ridge mountains, at Blowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899. In\r\nthe very young plant the volva split transversely (in a circumscissile\r\nfashion) quite clearly, and the free limb is quite short and distant\r\nfrom the stem on the margin of the saucer-like bulb. In the large and\r\nfully expanded plant at the center, the volva ruptured irregularly at\r\nthe apex, and portions of the thin upper half remain as patches on the\r\ncap while the larger part remains as the free limb, attached at the\r\nmargin of the broad saucer-shaped bulb, and collapsed up against the\r\nbase of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 58.--Amanita phalloides, volva circumscissile,\r\nconcave bulb margined by definite short limb of volva; upper part of\r\nvolva has disappeared from cap; cap whitish, tinged with brown.]\r\n\r\nFigure 58 and the small plant in Fig. 56, both from photographs of the\r\nsooty form of _Amanita phalloides_, show in a striking manner the\r\ntypical condition of the circumscissile volva margining the broad\r\nsaucer-like bulb as described for _Amanita mappa_. The color of _A.\r\nmappa_ is usually said to be straw color, but Fries even says that the\r\ncolor is as in _A. phalloides_, \"now white, now green, now yellow, now\r\ndark brown\" (Epicrisis, page 6). According to this, Fig. 58 would\r\nrepresent _A. mappa_.\r\n\r\nThe variable condition in this one species _A. phalloides_, now\r\nsplitting at the apex, now tearing up irregularly, now splitting in a\r\ndefinitely circumscissile manner, seems to bid defiance to any attempt\r\nto separate the species of _Amanita_ into groups based on the manner in\r\nwhich the volva ruptures. While it seems to be quite fixed and\r\ncharacteristic in certain species, it is so extremely variable in others\r\nas to lead to the suspicion that it is responsible in some cases for the\r\nmultiplication and confusion of species. At the same time, the\r\noccurrence of some of these forms at certain seasons of the year\r\nsuggests the desirability of prolonged and careful study of fresh\r\nmaterial, and the search for additional evidence of the unity of these\r\nforms, or of their definite segregation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 59.--Amanita verna, white (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nSince the _Amanita phalloides_ occurs usually in woods, or along borders\r\nof woods, there is little danger of confounding it with edible mushrooms\r\ncollected in lawns distant from the woods, and in open fields. However,\r\nit does occur in lawns bordering on woods, and in the summer of 1899 I\r\nfound several of the white forms of this species in a lawn distant from\r\nthe woods. This should cause beginners and those not thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the appearance of the plant to be extremely cautious against eating\r\nmushrooms simply because they were not collected in or near the woods.\r\nFurthermore, sometimes the white form of the deadly amanita possesses a\r\nfaint tinge of pink in the gills, which might lead the novice to mistake\r\nit for the common mushroom. The bulb of the deadly amanita is usually\r\ninserted quite deep in the soil or leaf mold, and specimens are often\r\npicked leaving the very important character of the volva in the ground,\r\nand then the plant might easily be taken for the common mushroom, or\r\nmore likely for the smooth lepiota, _Lepiota naucina_, which is entirely\r\nwhite, the gills only in age showing a faint pink tinge. It is very\r\nimportant, therefore, that, until one has such familiarity with these\r\nplants that they are easily recognized in the absence of some of these\r\ncharacters, the stem should be carefully dug from the soil. In the case\r\nof the specimens of the deadly amanita growing in the lawn on the campus\r\nof Cornell University, the stems were sunk to three to four inches in\r\nthe quite hard ground.\r\n\r\n=Amanita verna= Bull. =Deadly Poisonous.=--The _Amanita verna_ is by\r\nsome considered as only a white form of the _Amanita phalloides_. It is\r\nof a pure white color, and this in addition to its very poisonous\r\nproperty has led to its designation as the \"destroying angel.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 60.--Amanita verna, \"buttons,\" cap bursting\r\nthrough the volva; left hand plant in section (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is smooth and viscid when moist; the gills free; the =stem=\r\nstuffed or hollow in age; the =annulus= forms a broad collar, and the\r\n=volva= is split at the apex, and being quite stout, the free limb is\r\nprominent, and it hugs more or less closely to the base of the stem.\r\nFigure 59 represents the form of the plant which Gillet recognizes as\r\n_A. verna_; the pileus convex, the annulus broad and entire, and the\r\nstem scaly. These floccose scales are formed as a result of the\r\nseparation of the annulus from the outer layer of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe characters presented in the formation of the veil and annulus in\r\nthis species are very interesting, and sometimes present two of the\r\ntypes in the formation of the veil and annulus found in the genus\r\n_Amanita_. In the very young plant, in the button stage, as the young\r\ngills lie with their edges close against the side of the stem, loose\r\nthreads extend from the edges of the gills to the outer layer of the\r\nstem. This outer layer of the stem forms the veil, and is more or less\r\nloosely connected with the firmer portion of the stem by loose threads.\r\nAs the pileus expands, the threads connecting the edges of the gills\r\nwith the veil are stronger than those which unite the veil with the\r\nsurface of the stem. The veil is separated from the stem then,\r\nsimultaneously, or nearly so, throughout its entire extent, and is not\r\nripped up from below as in _Amanita velatipes_.\r\n\r\nAs the pileus expands, then, the veil lies closely over the edges of the\r\ngills until finally it is freed from them and from the margin of the\r\npileus. As the veil is split off from the surface of the stem, the\r\nlatter is torn into numerous floccose scales, as shown in Fig. 59.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, in addition to the primary veil which is separated from\r\nthe stem in the manner described above, there is a secondary veil formed\r\nin exactly the same way as that described for _Amanita velatipes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 61.--Amanita verna, small form, white (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nIn such cases there are two veils, or a double veil, each attached to\r\nthe margin of the pileus, the upper one ascending over the edges of the\r\ngills and attached above on the stem, while the lower one descends and\r\nis attached below as it is being ripped up from a second layer of the\r\nstem. Figures 59--61 are from plants collected at Blowing Rock, N. C.,\r\nin September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Amanita virosa= Fr. =Deadly Poisonous.=--This plant also by some is\r\nregarded as only a form of _Amanita phalloides_. It is a pure white\r\nplant and the pileus is viscid as in the _A. verna_ and _A. phalloides_.\r\nThe volva splits at the apex as in _A. verna_, but the veil is very\r\nfragile and torn into shreds as the pileus expands, portions of it\r\nclinging to the margin of the cap as well as to the stem, as shown in\r\nFig. 62. The stem is also adorned with soft floccose scales. Gillet\r\nfurther states that the pileus is conic to campanulate, not becoming\r\nconvex as in _A. verna_ and _A. phalloides_.\r\n\r\nThe variability presented in the character of the veil and in the shape\r\nof the pileus suggests, as some believe, that all these are but forms of\r\na single variable species. On the other hand, we need a more careful and\r\nextended field study of these variations. Doubtless different\r\ninterpretations of the specific limits by different students will lead\r\nsome to recognize several species where others would recognize but one.\r\nSince species are not distinct creations there may be tolerably good\r\ngrounds for both of these views.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 62.--Amanita virosa, white (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Amanita floccocephala= Atkinson. =Probably Poisonous.=--This species\r\noccurs in woods and groves at Ithaca during the autumn.

The =annulus= is superior, that is,\r\nnear the upper end of the stem, membranaceous, thin, sometimes tearing,\r\nas in _A. virosa_. The =volva= is circumscissile, the margin of the bulb\r\nnot being clear cut and prominent, because there is much refuse matter\r\nand soil interwoven with the lower portion of the volva. The bulb\r\nclosely resembles those in Cooke's figure (Illustrations, 4) of _A.\r\nmappa_. Figure 63 shows these characters well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 63.--Amanita floccocephala (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Amanita velatipes= Atkinson. =Properties Unknown.=--This plant is very\r\ninteresting since it shows in a striking manner the peculiar way in\r\nwhich the veil is formed in some of the species of _Amanita_. Though not\r\npossessing brilliant colors, it is handsome in its form and in the\r\npeculiar setting of the volva fragments on the rich brown or faint\r\nyellow of the pileus. It has been found on several occasions during the\r\nmonth of July in a beech woods on one of the old flood plains of\r\nSix-mile creek, one of the gorges in the vicinity of Ithaca, N. Y. The\r\nmature plant is from 15--20 cm. high, the cap from 8--10 cm. broad, and\r\nthe stem 1--1.5 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is viscid when moist, rounded, then broadly oval and convex\r\nto expanded, striate on the margin, sometimes in old plants the margin\r\nis elevated. It is smooth throughout, and of a soft, rich hair brown, or\r\number brown color, darker in the center. Sometimes there is a decided\r\nbut dull maize yellow tinge over the larger part of the pileus, but even\r\nthen the center is often brown in color, shading into the yellow color\r\ntoward the margin; the light yellow forms in age, often thinning out to\r\na cream color. The flesh of the pileus is rather thin, even in the\r\ncenter, and becomes very thin toward the margin, as shown in Fig. 67.\r\nThe scales on the pileus are more or less flattened, rather thin,\r\nclearly separated from the pileus, and easily removed. They are more or\r\nless angular, and while elongated transversely at first, become nearly\r\nisodiametric as the pileus becomes fully expanded, passing from an\r\nelongated form to rectangular, or sinuous in outline, the margin more or\r\nless upturned, especially in age, when they begin to loosen and \"peel\"\r\nfrom the surface of the cap. They are lighter in color than the pileus\r\nand I have never observed the yellow tint in them. The =gills= are\r\nwhite, broad at the middle, about 1 cm., and taper gradually toward each\r\nend. The =spores= are usually inequilaterally oval, 8--10 × 6--7 µ,\r\ngranular when young, when mature with a large oil drop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 15, FIGURE 64.--Amanita velatipes (3/4 natural\r\nsize).

Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is cylindrical, somewhat bulbous, the bulb often tapering\r\nabruptly, as shown in Figs. 64, 66. The stem is white, smooth, or\r\nfloccose scaly where the veil has been ripped off from it. It is\r\nhollow and stuffed with loose cottony threads, as shown in Fig. 67. The\r\n=veil= is formed by the ripping up of the outer layer of the stem as the\r\nlatter elongates and as the pileus expands. When it is freed from the\r\nmargin of the cap it collapses and hangs downward as a broad collar\r\n(Fig. 64). The =annulus= is inferior, its position on the stem being due\r\nto the peculiar way in which it is formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 66.--Amanita velatipes. Three plants natural size,\r\nthe left-hand one sectioned, showing stuffed center of stem. Others show\r\nhow veil is ripped up from the stem. For other details see text.\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nSome of the stages of development are illustrated in Figs. 64--67. The\r\nbuttons are queer looking objects, the bulb being the most prominent\r\npart. It tapers abruptly below, and on the upper side is the small\r\nrounded young cap seated in the center. The volva is present as a rough\r\nfloccose layer, covering the upper part of the bulb and the young cap.\r\nAs the stem elongates and the pileus enlarges and expands, the volva is\r\ntorn into areolate patches. The lower patches, those adjoining the\r\nmargin of the cap and the upper part of the bulb, are separated in a\r\nmore or less concentric manner. One or more of them lie on the upper\r\npart of the bulb, forming the \"limb\" of the \"ocreate\" volva. Others lie\r\naround the margin of the pileus. Sometimes an annular one bordering the\r\npileus and bulb is left clinging part way up on the stem, as shown in\r\nFig. 66. The concentric arrangement on the pileus is sometimes shown for\r\na considerable time, as in Fig. 67, the elongated areas being present in\r\ngreater number at this age of the pileus. However, as the pileus expands\r\nmore, these are separated into smaller areas and their connection with\r\nthe surface of the pileus becomes less firm.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the veil and annulus can be easily followed in these\r\nfigures. The margin of the cap in the button stage is firmly connected\r\nwith the outer layer of the stem at its lower end. This probably occurs\r\nby the intermingling growth of the threads from the lower end of the\r\nstem and the margin of the cap, while the edges of the gills are quite\r\nfree from the stem. Now as the stem elongates and the cap expands the\r\nveil is \"ripped\" up from the outer part of the stem. This is very\r\nclearly shown in Fig. 66, especially where two strips on the stem have\r\nbecome disconnected from the margin of the cap and are therefore left in\r\nposition on the outside of the stem.\r\n\r\nThis species is related to _A. excelsa_ Fr., which is said to have a\r\nsuperior ring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 16, FIGURE 67.--Amanita velatipes.

C., once in 1888, during\r\nthe first week of September, and again during the three first weeks in\r\nSeptember, 1899. It occurs sparingly during the first week or so of\r\nSeptember, and during the middle of the month is very abundant. The\r\nspecies seems to be clearly distinct from other species of _Amanita_,\r\nand there are certain characters so persistent as to make it easily\r\nrecognizable. It ranges in height from 7--12 cm. and the caps are 3--7\r\ncm. or more broad, while the stems are 4--10 mm. in thickness. The\r\nentire plant is usually white, but in some specimens the cap has a tinge\r\nof citron yellow, or in others tawny olive, in the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 17, FIGURE 68.--Amanita cothurnata.

Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, and passes, in its development, from nearly\r\nglobose to hemispherical, convex, expanded, and when specimens are very\r\nold sometimes the margin is elevated. It is usually white, though\r\nspecimens are found with a tinge of citron yellow in the center, or\r\nof tawny olive in the center of other specimens. The pileus is viscid,\r\nstrongly so when moist. It is finely striate on the margin, and covered\r\nwith numerous, white, floccose scales from the upper half of the volva,\r\nforming more or less dense patches, which may wash off in heavy rains.\r\nThe =gills= are rounded next the stem, and quite remote from it. The\r\nedge of the gills is often eroded or frazzly from the torn out threads\r\nwith which they were loosely connected to the upper side of the veil in\r\nthe young or button stage. The =spores= are globose or nearly so, with a\r\nlarge \"nucleus\" nearly filling the spore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 69.--Amanita cothurnata.

The surface of the stem is minutely floccose scaly or\r\nstrongly so, and decidedly hollow even from a very young stage, or\r\nsometimes when young with loose threads in the cavity.\r\n\r\nFigures 68--70, from plants (No. 3715, C.

Two plants in section\r\nshowing clearly hollow stem, veil attachment, etc. (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nIn _Amanita frostiana_ the remains of the volva sometimes form a similar\r\ncollar, but not so stout, on the base of the stem. The variations in _A.\r\nfrostiana_ where the stem, annulus and gills are white might suggest\r\nthat there is a close relationship between _A. frostiana_ and _A.\r\ncothurnata_, and that the latter is only a form of the former. From a\r\ncareful study of the two plants growing side by side the evidence is\r\nconvincing that the two are distinct. _Amanita frostiana_ occurs also at\r\nBlowing Rock, appearing earlier in the season than _A. cothurnata_, and\r\nalso being contemporary with it. _A. frostiana_ is more variable, not\r\nnearly so viscid, nor nearly so abundant, the stem is solid or stuffed,\r\nthe annulus is more frail and evolved from the stem in a different\r\nmanner. The volva does not leave such a constant and well defined roll\r\nwhere it separated on the stem transversely, and the pileus is yellow or\r\norange. When _A. cothurnata_ is yellowish at all it is a different tint\r\nof yellow and then only a tinge of yellow at the center. Albino or faded\r\nforms of _A. frostiana_ might occur, but we would not expect them to\r\nappear at a definite season of the year in great abundance while the\r\nnormal form, showing no intergrading specimens in the same locality,\r\ncontinued to appear in the same abundance and with the same characters\r\nas before. The dried plants of _A. cothurnata_ are apt to become tinged\r\nwith yellow on the gills, the upper part of the stem and upper part of\r\nthe annulus during the processes of drying, but the pileus does not\r\nchange in like manner, nor do these plants show traces of yellow on\r\nthese parts when fresh. The spores are also decidedly different, though\r\nthe shape and size do not differ to any great extent. In _A. frostiana_\r\nand the pale forms of the species the spores are nearly globose or oval,\r\nrarely with a tendency to become elliptical, but _the content is quite\r\nconstantly finely granular_, while the spores of _A. cothurnata_ are\r\nperhaps more constantly globose or nearly so, but the spore is _nearly\r\nfilled with a highly refractive oil globule or \"nucleus.\"_ The pileus\r\nof _A. frostiana_ is also thinner than that of _A. cothurnata_. It is\r\nnearer, in some respects, to specimens of _Amanita pantherina_ received\r\nfrom Bresadola, of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 71.--Amanita spreta. The two outside plants show\r\nthe free limb of the volva lying close against the stem (natural size,\r\noften larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Amanita spreta= Pk. =Said to be Poisonous.=--According to Peck this\r\nspecies grows in open or bushy places. The specimens illustrated in Fig.\r\n71 grew in sandy ground by the roadside near trees in the edge of an\r\nopen field at Blowing Rock, N. C., and others were found in a grove. The\r\nplants are 10--15 cm. high, the caps 6--12 cm. broad, and the stems\r\n8--12 mm. in thickness. The =pileus= is convex to expanded, gray or\r\nlight drab, and darker on the center, or according to Dr. Peck it may be\r\nwhite. It is smooth, or with only a few remnants of the volva, striate\r\non the margin, and 1--.5 cm. thick at the center. The =gills= are white,\r\nadnexed, that is they reach the stem by their upper angle. The =stem= is\r\nof the same color as the pileus, but somewhat lighter, white to light\r\ngray or light drab, cylindrical, not bulbous, hollow or stuffed. The\r\n=annulus= is thin and attached above the middle of the stem. The =volva=\r\nis sordid white, and sheathes the stem with a long free limb of 3--5\r\nlobes. It splits at the apex, but portions sometimes cling to the\r\nsurface of the pileus.\r\n\r\nFigure 71 is from plants (No. 3707, C. U.) collected at Blowing Rock, N.\r\nC., September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Amanita cæsarea= Scop. =Edible=, _but use great caution_.--This plant\r\nis known as the orange amanita, royal agaric, Cæsar's agaric, etc. It is\r\none of the most beautiful of all the agarics, and is well distributed\r\nover the earth. With us it is more common in the Southern States. It\r\noccurs in the summer and early autumn in the woods. It is easily\r\nrecognized by its usually large size, yellow or orange color of the cap,\r\ngills, stem and ring, and the prominent, white, sac-like volva at the\r\nbase of the stem. It is usually 12--20 cm. high, the cap 5--10 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stems 6--10 mm. in thickness, though it may exceed this\r\nsize, and depauperate forms are met with which are much smaller.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is ovate to bell-shaped, convex, and finally more or less\r\nexpanded, when the surface may be nearly flat or the center may be\r\nsomewhat elevated or umbonate and the margin curved downward. The\r\nsurface is smooth except at the margin, where it is prominently striate.\r\nThe color varies from orange to reddish or yellow, usually the well\r\ndeveloped and larger specimens have the deeper and richer colors, while\r\nthe smaller specimens have the lighter colors, and the color is usually\r\ndeeper on the center of the pileus. The =gills= are yellow, and free\r\nfrom the stem. The =stem= is hollow, even in young plants, when it may\r\nbe stuffed with loose threads. It is often very floccose scaly below the\r\nannulus. It is cylindrical, only slightly enlarged below, where it is\r\ncovered by the large, fleshy, sac-like white volva. The =annulus= is\r\nmembranaceous, large, and hangs like a broad collar from the upper part\r\nof the stem. The stem and ring are orange or yellow, the depth of the\r\ncolor varying more with the size of the plant than is the case with the\r\ncolor of the cap. In small specimens the stem is often white, especially\r\nin depauperate specimens are the stem and annulus white, and even the\r\ngills are white when the volva may be so reduced as to make it difficult\r\nto distinguish the specimens from similar specimens of the poisonous fly\r\nagaric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 18, FIGURE 72.--Amanita cæsarea. Different stages\r\nof development (2/3 natural size). Cap, stem, gills, veil orange or\r\nyellow. Volva white. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nIn the button stage the plant is ovate and the white color of the volva,\r\nwhich at this time entirely surrounds the plants, presents an appearance\r\nnot unlike that of an egg. The volva splits open at the apex as the stem\r\nelongates. The veil is often connected by loose threads with the outer\r\nportion of the stem and as the pileus expands this is torn away, leaving\r\ncoarse floccose scales on the stem. Some of the different stages in the\r\nopening of the plant are shown in Fig. 72. This illustration is taken\r\nfrom a photograph of plants (No. 3726, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., September, 1899. The plant is said to be one of the\r\nbest esculents, and has been prized as an article of food from ancient\r\ntimes. Great caution should be used in distinguishing it from the fly\r\nagaric and from other amanitas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 19.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.--Amanita rubescens\r\n  FIG. 2.--A. cæsarea.\r\n  Copyright 1900.]\r\n\r\n=Amanita rubescens= Fr. =Edible=, _but use great caution_.--The reddish\r\namanita, _Amanita rubescens_, is so called because of the sordid reddish\r\ncolor diffused over the entire plant, and especially because bruised\r\nportions quickly change to a reddish color. The plant is often quite\r\nlarge, from 12--20 cm. high, the cap 8--12 cm. broad and the stem 8--12\r\nmm. in thickness, but it is sometimes much smaller. It occurs during the\r\nlatter part of the summer and in early autumn, in woods and open places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 73.--Amanita rubescens. Plant partly expanded.\r\nDull reddish brown, stains reddish when bruised; for other details see\r\ntext (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is oval to convex, and becoming expanded when old. It is\r\nsmooth or faintly striate on the margin, and covered with numerous\r\nscattered, thin, floccose, grayish scales, forming remnants of the\r\nlarger part of the volva or outer veil. The color of the cap varies\r\ncorrespondingly, but is always tinged more or less distinctly with pink,\r\nred, or brownish red hues. The =gills= are white or whitish and free\r\nfrom the stem. The =stem= is nearly cylindrical, tapering some above,\r\nand with a prominent bulb which often tapers abruptly below. In addition\r\nto the suffused dull reddish color the stem is often stained with red,\r\nespecially where handled or touched by some object. There are very few\r\nevidences of the volva on the stem since the volva is so floccose and\r\ntorn into loose fragments, most of which remain on the surface of the\r\ncap. Sometimes a few of these loose fragments are seen on the upper\r\nportion of the bulb, but they are easily removed by handling or by\r\nrains. The =annulus= is membranous, broad, and fragile.\r\n\r\nSince the plant has become well known it is regarded as excellent and\r\nwholesome for food and pleasant to the taste. In case of the larger\r\nspecimens there should be no difficulty in distinguishing it from others\r\nby those who care to compare the descriptions closely with the fresh\r\nspecimens. But as in all cases beginners should use extreme caution in\r\neating plants they have not become thoroughly familiar with. Small\r\nspecimens of this species sometimes show but little of the reddish\r\ncolor, and are therefore difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nFigures 73 and 74 are from plants (No. 3727 C. U. herbarium) collected\r\nat Blowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Amanita solitaria= Bull. =Edible=, _but use caution_.--The solitary\r\namanita, like many other plants, is not always true to its name. While\r\nit often occurs solitary, it does occur sometimes in groups. It is one\r\nof the largest of the amanitas. Its large size, together with its chalky\r\nwhite or grayish white color, and ragged or shaggy appearance, makes it\r\na striking object in the woods, or along roadsides in woods where it\r\ngrows. Frequently parts of the cap, the entire stem and the gills are\r\ncovered with a white, crumbly, floccose substance of a mealy consistency\r\nwhich often sticks to the hands or other objects. The plant ranges from\r\n15--20 cm. or more high, the cap from 8--15 cm. broad, and the stems are\r\n1--2 cm. or more in thickness.\r\n\r\nIn form the =pileus= ranges from nearly globose in the button stage, to\r\nhemispherical, convex and expanded, when quite old the margin becoming\r\nmore or less elevated. It is covered either with flaky or floccose\r\nportions of the volva, or with more or less distinct conic white scales,\r\nespecially toward the center. The conic scales are easily rubbed off in\r\nhandling or are easily washed off by rains. Many of them are loosened\r\nand fall because of the tension produced by the expanding pileus on the\r\nsurface of which they rest. These scales vary in size from quite small\r\nones, appearing like granules, to those fewer in number and larger, 3\r\nmm. high and nearly as broad at the base. In other cases the scales are\r\nharder and stouter and dark colored. These forms will be discussed after\r\nthe description of the other parts of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 20, FIGURE 74.--Amanita rubescens. Under and side\r\nview. Dull reddish brown, stains reddish where bruised (3/4 natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 21, FIGURE 75.--Amanita solitaria. Entirely white,\r\nor cap and scales sordid buff, dull brown, or grayish in some plants.\r\nFor details see text (1/2 natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =gills= are free, or are only attached by the upper inner angle; the\r\nedges are often floccose where they are torn from the slight union with\r\nthe upper surface of the veil. The =stem= is cylindrical, solid or\r\nstuffed when old, enlarged usually below into a prominent bulb which\r\nthen tapers into a more or less elongated root-like process, sometimes\r\nextending 5--10 cm. in the ground below the bulb. In rare cases the bulb\r\nis not present, but the cylindrical stem extends for a considerable\r\ndistance into the ground. The =veil= is a very interesting part of the\r\nplant and the manner in which it forms and disappears as the cap expands\r\nis worth a careful study. This is well shown in Figs. 75, 76, from\r\nphotographs of plants (No. 3731 C. U. herbarium) made at Blowing Rock,\r\nN. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of August and the first three weeks of September\r\nthe plants were quite common in the mountain woods at Blowing Rock. In\r\ncertain features there was close agreement in the case of all the\r\nspecimens examined, especially in the long rooting character of the base\r\nof the stem. The veil and annulus were also quite constant in their\r\ncharacters, though sometimes a tendency was manifested to split up more\r\nirregularly than at other times. In the character of the warts of the\r\npileus there was great variation, showing typical forms of _Amanita\r\nsolitaria_ and grading into forms which might be taken for typical\r\n_Amanita strobiliformis_. Especially is this so in the case of some of\r\nmy specimens (No. 3733), where the scales are pyramidal, dark brown,\r\nsurrounded by a sordid buff or grayish area, and these latter areas\r\nseparated by narrow chinks whitish in color. The scales in this specimen\r\nare fixed quite firmly to the surface of the pileus. In other specimens\r\n(No. 3732) these hard scales remove quite easily, while in still another\r\nthe pileus is almost smooth, even the floccose scales having been\r\nobliterated, while a very few of the hard angular warts are still\r\npresent. In another half expanded plant (of No. 3732) the warts are\r\npyramidal, 4--6 mm. long at the center of the pileus and rather closely\r\nimbricated, hard, and firmly joined to the surface of the cap. In Nos.\r\n3733 and 3731 the spores measure 7--9 × 4--6 µ. In 3732 they are longer,\r\nvarying from 7--11 µ.\r\n\r\nThe specimens with the long hard scales suggest _Amanita strobiliformis_\r\nVittad., but the long rooting base of the stem does not agree with the\r\ndescription of that plant, but does clearly agree with _Amanita\r\nsolitaria_ Bull. A study of the variations in these plants suggests that\r\n_Amanita solitaria_ and _strobiliformis_ Vittad., represent only\r\nvariations in a single species as Bulliard interpreted the species more\r\nthan a century ago. Forms of the plant are also found which suggest\r\nthat _A. polypyramis_ B. & C., collected in North Carolina, is but one\r\nof the variations of _A. solitaria_.\r\n\r\nFigures 75, 76 show well certain stages in the development of this\r\nplant. The conical or pyramidal warts are formed in a very young stage\r\nof the plant by the primary separation of the outer part of the volva,\r\nand as the pileus expands more, and the cessation of growth of the outer\r\nveil proceeds inward, the scales become more widely separated at the\r\napex and broader at the base. In some cases the volva is probably\r\nthinner than in others, and with the rapid expansion of the pileus in\r\nwet weather the scales would be smaller, or more floccose. But with\r\ndifferent conditions, when it is not so wet, the plant expands less\r\nrapidly, the surface of the pileus becomes drier, the volva layer does\r\nnot separate so readily and the fissures between the scales proceed\r\ndeeper, and sometimes probably enter the surface of the pileus, so that\r\nthe size of the warts is augmented. A similar state of things sometimes\r\ntakes place on the base of the stem at the upper margin of the bulb,\r\nwhere the concentric fissures may extend to some distance in the stem,\r\nmaking the scales here more prominent in some specimens than in others.\r\nA similar variation in the character of the scales on the bulb of\r\n_Amanita muscaria_ is sometimes presented.\r\n\r\nThe veil is often loosely attached to the edges of the gills, and so is\r\nstripped off from the stem quite early. Sometimes it is more strongly\r\nadherent to the stem, or portions of it may be, when it is very\r\nirregularly ruptured as it is peeled off from the stem, as shown in the\r\nplant near the left side in Fig. 75. The veil is very fragile and often\r\ntears a little distance from the margin of the cap, while the portion\r\nattached to the stem forms the annulus. This condition is shown in the\r\ncase of three plants in Fig. 75. The plant is said to be edible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMANITOPSIS Roze.\r\n\r\nThis genus has white spores, and a volva, but the annulus and inner veil\r\nare wanting. In other respects it agrees with _Amanita_. It is\r\nconsidered as a sub-genus of _Amanita_ by some.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 22, FIGURE 76.--Amanita solitaria. Three plants,\r\n3/4 natural size. Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Amanitopsis vaginata= (Bull.) Roz. =Edible.=--The sheathed amanitopsis,\r\n_A. vaginata_, is a quite common and widely distributed plant in woods.\r\nIt is well named since the prominent volva forms a large sheath to the\r\ncylindrical base of the stem. The plant occurs in several forms, a gray\r\nor mouse colored form, and a brownish or fulvous form, and sometimes\r\nnearly white. These forms are recognized by some as varieties, and by\r\nothers as species. The plants are 8--15 cm. high, the caps 3--7 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stems 5--8 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 23, FIGURE 77.--Amanitopsis vaginata. Tawny form\r\n(natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is from ovate to bell-shaped, then convex and expanded,\r\nsmooth, rarely with fragments of the volva on the surface. The margin is\r\nthin and marked by deep furrows and ridges, so that it is deeply\r\nstriate, or the terms sulcate or pectinate sulcate are used to express\r\nthe character of the margin. The term pectinate sulcate is employed on\r\naccount of a series of small elevations on the ridges, giving them a\r\npectinate, or comb-like, appearance. The color varies from gray to mouse\r\ncolor, brown, or ochraceous brown. The flesh is white. The =gills= are\r\nwhite or nearly so, and free. The =spores= are globose, 7--10 µ in\r\ndiameter. The =stem= is cylindrical, even, or slightly tapering upward,\r\nhollow or stuffed, not bulbous, smooth, or with mealy particles or\r\nprominent floccose scales. These scales are formed by the separation of\r\nthe edges of the gills from the surface of the stem, to which they are\r\nclosely applied before the pileus begins to expand. Threads of mycelium\r\ngrowing from the edge of the lamellæ and from the stem intermingle. When\r\nthe pileus expands these are torn asunder, or by their pull tear up the\r\nouter surface of the stem. The =volva= forms a prominent sheath which is\r\nusually quite soft and easily collapses (Fig. 77).\r\n\r\nThe entire plant is very brittle and fragile. It is considered an\r\nexcellent one for food. I often eat it raw when collecting.\r\n\r\nAuthors differ as to the number of species recognized in the plant as\r\ndescribed above. Secretan recognized as many as ten species. The two\r\nprominent color forms are quite often recognized as two species, or by\r\nothers as varieties; the gray or mouse colored form as _A. livida_\r\nPers., and the tawny form as _A. spadicea_ Pers. According to Fries and\r\nothers the _livida_ appears earlier in the season than _spadicea_, and\r\nthis fact is recognized by some as entitling the two to specific rank.\r\nPlowright (Trans. Brit. Mycol. Soc., p. 40, 1897--98) points out that in\r\nEuropean forms of _spadicea_ there is a second volva inside the outer,\r\nand in _livida_ there are \"folds or wrinkles of considerable size on the\r\ninner surface of the volva.\" He thinks the two entitled to specific\r\nrank. At Ithaca and in the mountains of North Carolina I have found both\r\nforms appearing at the same season, and thus far have been unable to\r\ndetect the differences noted by Plowright in the volva. But I have never\r\nfound intergrading color forms, and have not yet satisfied myself as to\r\nwhether or not the two should be entitled to specific rank.\r\n\r\nSome of the other species of _Amanitopsis_ found in this country are\r\n=A. nivalis= Grev., an entirely white plant regarded by some as only a\r\nwhite form of =A. vaginata=. Another white plant is =A. volvata= Pk.,\r\nwhich has elliptical spores, and is striate on the margin instead of\r\nsulcate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 78.--Amanitopsis farinosa. Cap grayish (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Amanitopsis farinosa= Schw.--The mealy agaric, or powdery amanita, is a\r\npretty little species. It was first collected and described from North\r\nCarolina by de Schweinitz (Synop. fung. Car. No. 552, 1822), and the\r\nspecimens illustrated in Fig. 78 were collected by me at Blowing Rock,\r\nN. C., during September, 1899. Peck has given in the 33rd Report N. Y.\r\nState Mus., p. 49, an excellent description of the plant, though it\r\noften exceeds somewhat the height given by him. It ranges from 5--8 or\r\n10 cm. high, the cap from 2--3 cm. broad, and the stem 3--6 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is from subglobose to convex and expanded, becoming nearly\r\nplane or even depressed by the elevation of the margin in old specimens.\r\nThe color is gray or grayish brown, or mouse colored. The pileus is\r\nthin, and deeply striate on the margin, covered with a grayish floccose,\r\npowdery or mealy substance, the remnant of the evanescent volva. This\r\nsubstance is denser at the center and is easily rubbed off. The =gills=\r\nare white and free from the stem. The =spores= are subglobose and\r\novate to elliptical, 6--7 µ long. The =stem= is cylindrical, even,\r\nhollow or stuffed, whitish or gray and very slightly enlarged at the\r\nbase into a small rounded bulb which is quite constant and\r\ncharacteristic, and at first is covered on its upper margin by the\r\nfloccose matter from the volva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 24, FIGURE 79.--Lepiota naucina. Entirely white\r\n(natural size).]\r\n\r\nAt Blowing Rock the plants occurred in sandy soil by roadsides or in\r\nopen woods. In habit it resembles strikingly forms of _Amanitopsis\r\nvaginata_, but the volva is entirely different (Fig. 78). Although _A.\r\nvaginata_ was common in the same locality, I searched in vain for\r\nintermediate forms which I thought might be found. Sometimes the\r\nfloccose matter would cling together more or less, and portions of it\r\nremained as patches on the lower part of the stem, while depauperate\r\nforms of _A. vaginata_ would have a somewhat reduced volva, but in no\r\ncase did I find intermediate stages between the two kinds of volva.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPIOTA Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Lepiota_ lacks a volva, but the veil is present forming a\r\nring on the stem. The genus is closely related to _Amanita_, from which\r\nit differs in the absence of the volva, or perhaps more properly\r\nspeaking in the fact that the universal veil is firmly connected\r\n(concrete with) with the pileus, and with the base of the stem, so that\r\na volva is not formed. The gills are usually free from the stem, some\r\nbeing simply adnexed, but in some species connected with a collar near\r\nthe stem. The stem is fleshy and is easily separable from the cap. A\r\nnumber of the species are edible. Peck, 35th Report N. Y. State Mus., p.\r\n150--164, describes 18 species. Lloyd, Mycol. Notes, November, 1898,\r\ndescribes 9 species.\r\n\r\n=Lepiota naucina= Fr. (_Lepiota naucinoides_ Pk., _Annularia lævis_\r\nKrombh.) =Edible.=--The smooth lepiota, _L. naucina_, grows in lawns, in\r\npastures and by roadsides, etc. It occurs during the latter part of\r\nsummer and during autumn, being more abundant in September and early\r\nOctober. It is entirely white, or the cap is sometimes buff, and in age\r\nthe gills become dirty pink in color. It is from 8--12 cm. high, the cap\r\n5--10 cm. broad, and the stem 8--15 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is very fleshy, nearly globose, then convex to nearly\r\nexpanded, smooth, or rarely the surface is broken into minute scales.\r\nThe =gills= are first white, free from the stem, and in age assume a\r\ndull pink tinge. The =spores= are usually white in mass, but rarely when\r\ncaught on white paper they show a faint pink tinge. The spores are\r\nelliptical to oval. The =stem= is nearly cylindrical, gradually\r\nenlarging below so that it is clavate, nearly hollow or stuffed with\r\nloose threads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 80.--Lepiota naucina.--Section of three plants,\r\ndifferent ages.]\r\n\r\nSince the plant occurs in the same situations as the _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_ it might be mistaken for it, especially for white forms. But\r\nof course no harm could come by eating it by mistake for the common\r\nmushroom, for it is valued just as highly for food by some who have\r\neaten it. If one should look at the gills, however, they would not\r\nlikely mistake it for the common mushroom because the gills become pink\r\nonly when the plant is well expanded and quite old. There is much more\r\ndanger in mistaking it for the white amanitas, _A. phalloides_, _A.\r\nverna_, or _A. virosa_, since the gills of these deadly plants are\r\nwhite, and they do sometimes grow in lawns and other grassy places where\r\nthe smooth lepiota and the common mushroom grow. For this reason one\r\nshould study the descriptions and illustrations of these amanitas given\r\non preceding pages, and especially should the suggestions given there\r\nabout care in collecting plants be followed, until one is so certainly\r\nfamiliar with the characters that the plants would be known \"on sight.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 25, FIGURE 81.--Lepiota procera. Grayish brown to\r\nreddish brown, gills and flesh white (3/4 natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe pink color of the gills of this lepiota has led certain students of\r\nthe fungi into mistakes of another kind. This pink color of the gills\r\nhas led some to place the plant among the rosy spored agarics in the\r\ngenus _Annularia_, where it was named _Annularia lævis_ by Krombholtz\r\n(vide Bresadola Funghi Mangerecci e velenosi, p. 29, 1899). It fits\r\nthe description of that plant exactly. The pink color of the gills, as\r\nwell as the fact that the gills turn brownish when dry, has led to a\r\nconfusion in some cases of the _Lepiota naucina_ with the chalky agaric,\r\n_Agaricus cretaceus_. The external resemblance of the plants, as shown\r\nin various illustrations, is very striking, and in the chalky agaric the\r\ngills remain pink very late, only becoming brown when very old.\r\n\r\n=Lepiota procera= Scop. =Edible.=--The parasol mushroom, _Lepiota\r\nprocera_, grows in pastures, lawns, gardens, along roadsides, or in thin\r\nwoods, or in gardens. It is a large and handsome plant and when expanded\r\nseems not inappropriately named. It is from 12--20 cm. or more high, the\r\ncap expands from 5--12 cm., while the stem is 4--7 mm. in thickness. It\r\noccurs during summer and in early autumn.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is oval, then bell-shaped, convex and nearly expanded, with\r\nusually a more or less prominent elevation (umbo) at the center.\r\nSometimes it is depressed at the center. It is grayish brown or reddish\r\nbrown in color on the surface and the flesh is whitish. As the cap\r\nexpands the surface layer ceases to grow and is therefore cracked, first\r\nnarrow chinks appearing, showing white or grayish threads underneath. As\r\nthe cap becomes more expanded the brown surface is torn into scales,\r\nwhich give the cap a more or less shaggy appearance except on the umbo,\r\nwhere the color is more uniform. The torn surface of the pileus shows\r\nnumerous radiating fibres, and it is soft and yielding to the touch. The\r\n=gills= are remote from the stem, broad and crowded. The =spores= are\r\nlong, elliptical, 12--17 µ long. The =stem= is cylindrical, hollow, or\r\nstuffed, even, enlarged below into a prominent bulb, of the same color\r\nas the pileus, though paler, especially above the annulus. The surface\r\nis usually cracked into numerous small scales, the chinks between\r\nshowing the white inner portion of the stem. The =ring= is stout,\r\nnarrow, usually quite free from the stem, so that it can be moved up and\r\ndown on the stem, and is called a movable ring.\r\n\r\nFigure 81 is from plants (No. 3842, C. U. herbarium) collected in a\r\ngarden at Blowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\nA closely related plant, _Lepiota rachodes_ Vitt., has smaller spores,\r\n9--12 × 7--9 µ. It is also edible, and by some considered only a variety\r\nof _L. procera_. It is rare in this country, but appears about Boston in\r\nconsiderable quantities \"in or near greenhouses or in enriched soil out\r\nof doors,\" where it has the appearance of an introduced plant (Webster,\r\nRhodora, 1: 226, 1899). It is a much stouter plant than _L. procera_,\r\nthe pileus usually depressed, much more coarsely scaly, and usually\r\ngrows in dense clusters, while _L. procera_ usually occurs singly or\r\nscattered, is more slender, often umbonate. _L. rachodes_ has a veil\r\nwith a double edge, the edges more or less fringed. The veil is fixed to\r\nthe stem until the plant is quite mature, when it becomes movable. The\r\nflesh of the plant on exposure to the air becomes a brownish orange\r\ntint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 82.--Lepiota americana. Scales and center of cap\r\nreddish or reddish brown. Entire plant turns reddish on drying (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lepiota morgani= Pk.--This plant occurs from Ohio, southward and west.\r\nIt grows in grassy places, especially in wet pastures. It is one of the\r\nlargest of the lepiotas, ranging from 20--40 cm. high, the cap 20--30\r\ncm. broad, and the stem about 2 cm. in thickness. The =pileus=, when\r\nfully expanded, is whitish, with large dark scales, especially toward\r\nthe center. The =ring= is large, sometimes movable, and the =gills= and\r\n=spores= are greenish. Some report the plant as edible, while others say\r\nillness results from eating it.\r\n\r\n=Lepiota americana= Pk. =Edible.=--This plant is widely distributed in\r\nthe United States. The plants occur singly or are clustered, 6--12 cm.\r\nhigh, the cap 4--10 cm. broad, and the stem 4--10 mm. in thickness. The\r\ncap is adorned with reddish or reddish brown scales except on the\r\ncenter, where the color is uniform because the surface is not broken up\r\ninto scales. The flesh is white, but changes to reddish when cut or\r\nbruised, and the whole plant becomes reddish on drying.\r\n\r\nFigure 82 is from plants (No. 2718, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nIthaca.\r\n\r\nThe European plant, _L. badhami_, also reported in this country, changes\r\nto a brownish red. It is believed by some to be identical with _L.\r\namericana_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 83.--Lepiota cristata. Entirely white, but scales\r\ngrayish or pinkish brown, stem often flesh color (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lepiota acutesquamosa= Weinm.--This is a medium or small sized plant\r\nwith a floccose pileus adorned with small, acute, erect scales, and has\r\na loose, hairy or wooly veil which is often torn irregularly. The erect\r\nscales fall away from the pileus and leave little scars where they were\r\nattached.\r\n\r\n=Lepiota cristata= A. & S. =Edible.=--The crested lepiota, _Lepiota\r\ncristata_, occurs in grassy places and borders of woods, in groves,\r\netc., from May to September, and is widely distributed. The plant is\r\nsmall, 3--5 cm. high, the cap 1--4 cm. broad, and the stem 2--5 mm. in\r\nthickness. It grows in clusters or is scattered.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is ovate, bell-shaped, then convex and expanded, and thin.\r\nThe surface is at first entirely dull reddish or reddish brown, but soon\r\ncracks into numerous scales of the same color arranged in a crested\r\nmanner, more numerous between the margin and the center, and often\r\narranged in a concentric manner. The center of the cap often preserves\r\nthe uniform reddish brown color because the pileus at this point does\r\nnot expand so much and therefore the surface does not crack, while the\r\nmargin often becomes white because of the disappearance of the brown\r\ncovering here. The =gills= are free from the stem, narrow, crowded, and\r\nclose to the stem. The =spores= are more or less angular, elongated,\r\nmore narrowed at one end, and measure 5--8 × 3--4 µ. The =stem= is\r\nslender, cylindrical, hollow, whitish, smooth. The =ring= is small,\r\nwhite, and easily breaks up and disappears.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the plant are well shown in Fig. 83 from plants\r\ncollected at Ithaca. _Lepiota angustana_ Britz. is identical, and\r\naccording to Morgan _L. miamensis_ Morgan is a white form of _L.\r\nangustana_.\r\n\r\n=Lepiota asperula= Atkinson.--This lepiota resembles _A. asper_ in some\r\nrespects, but it is smaller and the spores are much smaller, being very\r\nminute. The plant is 5--8 cm. high, the pileus 2--4 cm. broad, and the\r\nstem 4--6 mm. in thickness. It grows in leaf mould in the woods and has\r\nbeen found at Ithaca, N. Y., twice during July and September, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex and bell-shaped, becoming nearly or quite\r\nexpanded. It is hair brown to olive brown in color. The surface is dry,\r\nmade up of interwoven threads, and is adorned with numerous small,\r\nerect, pointed scales resembling in this respect _A. asper_ Fr. The\r\n=gills= are white or yellowish, free, but rather close to the stem,\r\nnarrow, often eroded on the edge, sometimes forked near the stem, and\r\nsome of them arranged in pairs. The spores are oblong, smooth, and very\r\nminute, measuring 5 × 2 µ. The =stem= is the same color as the pileus,\r\ncylindrical, hollow, with loose threads in the cavity, enlarged into a\r\nrounded bulb below, minutely downy to pubescent. The outer portion of\r\nthe bulb is formed of intricately interwoven threads, among which are\r\nentangled soil and humus particles. The =veil= is white, silky, hairy,\r\nseparating from the stem like a dense cortina, the threads stretched\r\nboth above and below as shown in Fig. 84 from plants (No. 3157 C. U.\r\nherbarium), collected at Ithaca.\r\n\r\nIn some specimens, as the pileus expands, the spaces between the pointed\r\nscales are torn, thus forming quite coarse scales which are often\r\narranged in more or less concentric rows, showing the yellow-tinged\r\nflesh in the cracks, and the coarse scales bearing the fine point at the\r\ncenter. A layer connecting the margin of the pileus with the base of the\r\nstem and covered with fine brown points, sometimes separates from the\r\nedge of the cap and the base of the stem, and clings partly to the\r\ncortina and partly to the stem in much the same way that portions of the\r\nvolva cling to the stem of certain species of _Amanita_, as seen in _A.\r\nvelatipes_ (Fig. 66). Sometimes this is left on the base of the stem\r\nand then resembles a short, free limb of a volva, and suggests a species\r\nof _Amanita_. The scales, however, are concrete with the pileus, and the\r\nspecies appears to show a closer relationship with _Lepiota_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 26, FIGURE 84.--Lepiota asperula. Cap hair-brown to\r\nolive-brown, scales minute, pointed, gills and stem white (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARMILLARIA Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Armillaria_ the inner veil which forms a ring on the stem\r\nis present. The stem is fibrous, or the outer portion cartilaginous in\r\nsome species, and not easily separable from the substance of the pileus\r\n(continuous with the hymenophore), and the gills are attached to the\r\nstem, sinuate, or decurrent, spores white. Peck, 43rd Report N. Y. State\r\nMus., p. 40--45, describes 6 species.\r\n\r\nSome of the species resemble very closely certain species of _Amanita_\r\nor _Lepiota_, but can be distinguished by the firm continuity of the\r\nsubstance of the stem and cap.\r\n\r\n=Armillaria mellea= Vahl. =Edible.=--This is one of the most common of\r\nthe late summer and autumn fungi, and is widely distributed over the\r\nworld. It grows about the bases of old stumps or dead trees, or from\r\nburied roots. Sometimes it is found attached to the living roots of\r\ntrees. The plant occurs in tufts or clusters, several to many\r\nindividuals growing together, the bases of their stems connected with a\r\nblack rope-like strand from which they arise. The entire plant is often\r\nmore or less honey colored, from which the plant gets its specific name.\r\nIts clustered habit, the usually prominent ring on the stems, and the\r\nsharp, blackish, erect scales which usually adorn the center of the cap,\r\nmark it as an easy plant to determine in most cases. The colors and\r\nmarkings, however, vary greatly, so that some of the forms are very\r\npuzzling. The plant varies in height from 10--15 cm., the cap from 5--10\r\ncm. broad, and the stem 4--10 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is oval to convex and expanded, sometimes with a slight\r\numbo or elevation at the center. The color varies from honey color to\r\nnearly white, or yellowish brown to dull reddish brown, usually darker\r\non the center. In typical forms the pileus is adorned with pointed dark\r\nbrown, or blackish, erect, scales especially abundant over the center,\r\nwhile the margin is often free from them, but may be marked with looser\r\nfloccose, brownish, or yellowish scales. Sometimes there are no blackish\r\npointed scales anywhere on the cap, only loose floccose colored scales,\r\nor in some forms the cap is entirely smooth. The margin in old specimens\r\nis often striate. The pileus is usually dry, but Webster cites an\r\ninstance in which it was viscid in wet weather.\r\n\r\nThe =gills= are attached to the stem squarely (adnate) or they are\r\ndecurrent (extend downward on the stem), are white, or whitish, becoming\r\nin age more or less dingy or stained. The spores are rounded or\r\nelliptical, 6--9 µ. The =stem= is elastic, spongy within and sometimes\r\nhollow. It is smooth or often floccose scaly below the ring, sometimes\r\nwith prominent transverse bands of a hairy substance. It is usually\r\nwhitish near the upper end, but dull brown or reddish brown below the\r\nannulus, sometimes distinctly yellowish. The =veil= varies greatly also.\r\nIt may be membranaceous and thin, or quite thick, or in other cases may\r\nbe absent entirely. The =ring= of course varies in a corresponding\r\nmanner. As shown in Fig. 85 it is quite thick, so that it appears double\r\non the edge, where it broke away from the inner and outer surfaces of\r\nthe margin of the cap. It is frequently fixed to the stem, that is, not\r\nmovable, but when very thin and frail it often disappears.\r\n\r\nThe honey colored agaric is said by nearly all writers to be edible,\r\nthough some condemn it. It is not one of the best since it is of rather\r\ntough consistency. It is a species of considerable economic importance\r\nand interest, since it is a parasite on certain coniferous trees, and\r\nperhaps also on certain of the broad-leaved trees. It attacks the roots\r\nof these trees, the mycelium making its way through the outer layer, and\r\nthen it grows beneath the bark. Here it forms fan-like sheets of\r\nmycelium which advance along both away from the tree and towards the\r\ntrunk. It disorganizes and breaks down the tissues of the root here,\r\nproviding a space for a thicker growth of the mycelium as it becomes\r\nolder. In places the mycelium forms rope-like strands, at first white in\r\ncolor, but later becoming dark brown and shining. These cords or\r\nstrands, known as _rhizomorphs_, extend for long distances underneath\r\nthe bark of the root. They are also found growing in the hollow trunks\r\nof trees sometimes. In time enough of the roots are injured to kill the\r\ntree, or the roots are so weakened that heavy winds will blow the trees\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe fruiting plants always arise from these rhizomorphs, and by digging\r\ncarefully around the bases of the stems one can find these cords with\r\nthe stems attached, though the attachment is frail and the stems are\r\neasily separated from the cords. Often these cords grow for years\r\nwithout forming any fruit bodies. In this condition they are often found\r\nby stripping off the bark from dead and rotting logs in the woods. These\r\ncords were once supposed to be separate fungi, and they were known under\r\nthe name _Rhizomorpha subcorticalis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 27, FIGURE 85.--Armillaria mellea.

The plants are 6--8 cm. high, the cap 4--7 cm. broad, and the\r\nstem 6--8 mm. in thickness. It occurs in woods. It is known by its\r\nviscid pileus, the orange brown or ochraceous rufus color of the pileus\r\nand stem, and the color of the stem being confined to the superficial\r\nlayer, which becomes torn into concentric floccose scales, forming\r\nnumerous minute floccose irregular rings of color around the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 86.--Armillaria aurantia Schaeff. (=Tricholoma\r\npeckii Howe). Cap orange-brown or ochraceous rufus, viscid; floccose\r\nscales on stem same color (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, with an umbo, and the edge inrolled,\r\nfleshy, thin, viscid, ochraceous rufus (in specimens collected by\r\nmyself), darker on the umbo, and minutely scaly from tufts of hairs, and\r\nthe viscid cuticle easily peeling off. The =gills= are narrow, crowded,\r\nslightly adnexed, or many free, white, becoming brown discolored where\r\nbruised, and in drying brownish or rufus. The =spores= are minute,\r\nglobose to ovoid, or rarely sub-elliptical when a little longer, with a\r\nprominent oil globule usually, 3--3.5 × 3--5 µ, sometimes a little\r\nlonger when the elliptical forms are presented. The =stem= is straight\r\nor ascending, even, very floccose scaly as the pileus is unrolled from\r\nit, scales same color as the pileus, the scales running transversely,\r\nbeing separated perhaps by the elongation of the stem so that numerous\r\nfloccose rings are formed, showing the white flesh of the stem between.\r\nThe upper part of the stem, that above the annulus, is white, but the\r\nupper part floccose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 87.--Tricholoma personatum. Entire plant grayish\r\nbrown, tinged with lilac or purple, spores light ochraceous (natural\r\nsize, often larger).]\r\n\r\nThis plant has been long known in Europe. There is a rather poor figure\r\nof it in Schaeffer Table 37, and a better one in Gillet Champignons de\r\nFrance, Hymenomycetes, =1=, opposite page 76, but a very good one in\r\nBresadola Funghi Mangerecci e Velenosi, Tavel 18, 1899. A good figure is\r\nalso given by Barla, Les Champignons des Alpes--Maritimes, Pl. 19, Figs.\r\n1--6. The plant was first reported from America in the 41st Report,\r\nState Museum, N. Y., p. 82, 1888, under the name _Tricholoma peckii_\r\nHowe, from the Catskill Mountains, N. Y. Figure 86 is from plants (No.\r\n3991, C. U. herbarium) collected in the Blue Ridge mountains, at Blowing\r\nRock, N. C., during September, 1899. The European and American\r\ndescription both ascribe a bitter taste to the flesh of the pileus, and\r\nit is regarded as suspicious.\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be a well formed annulus, the veil only being\r\npresent in a rather young stage, as the inrolled margin of the pileus is\r\nunrolling from the surface of the stem. It seems to be more in the form\r\nof a universal veil resembling the veil of some of the lepiotas. It\r\nshows a relationship with _Tricholoma_ which possesses in typical forms\r\na delicate veil present only in the young stage. Perhaps for this reason\r\nit was referred by Howe to _Tricholoma_ as an undescribed species when\r\nit was named _T. peckii_. If its affinities should prove to be with\r\n_Tricholoma_ rather than with _Armillaria_, it would then be known as\r\n_Tricholoma aurantium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICHOLOMA Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Tricholoma_ the volva and annulus are both wanting, the\r\nspores are white, and the gills are attached to the stem, but are more\r\nor less strongly notched or sinuate at the stem. Sometimes the notch is\r\nvery slight. The stem is fleshy-fibrous, attached to the center of the\r\npileus, and is usually short and stout. In some specimens when young\r\nthere is a slight cobwebby veil which very soon disappears. The genus is\r\na very large one. Some species are said to be poisonous and a few are\r\nknown to be edible. Peck, 44th Report, N. Y. State Mus., pp. 38--64,\r\ndescribes 46 species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 88.--Tricholoma personatum. Section (natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\n=Tricholoma personatum= Fr. =Edible.=--This plant occurs during the\r\nautumn and persists up to the winter months. It grows on the ground in\r\nopen places and in woods. The stem is short, usually 3--7 cm. long ×\r\n1--2 cm. in thickness, and the cap is from 5--10 cm. or more broad. The\r\nentire plant often has a lilac or purple tint.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, expanded, moist, smooth, grayish to brownish\r\ntinged with lilac or purple, especially when young, fading out in age.\r\nWhen young the pileus is sometimes adorned with white mealy particles,\r\nand when old the margin may be more or less upturned and wavy. The\r\n=gills= are crowded, rounded next the stem, and nearly free but close to\r\nthe stem, violet or lilac when young, changing to dull reddish brown\r\nwhen old. The =spores= when caught in mass are dull pink or salmon\r\ncolor. They measure 7--9 µ long. The =stem= is solid, fibrous, smooth,\r\ndeep lilac when young and retaining the lilac color longer than the\r\npileus. Sometimes the base is bulbous as in Fig. 87.\r\n\r\nThis plant is regarded by all writers as one of the best of the edible\r\nfungi. Sometimes the pileus is water soaked and then the flavor is not\r\nso fine. The position of the plant is regarded as doubtful by some\r\nbecause of the more or less russety pink color of the spores when seen\r\nin mass, and the ease with which the gills separate from the pileus,\r\ncharacters which show its relationship to the genus _Paxillus_.\r\n\r\n=Tricholoma sejunctum= Sowerb. =Edible.=--This plant occurs on the\r\nground in rather open woods during late summer and in the autumn. It is\r\n8--12 cm. high, the cap 5--8 cm. broad, and the stem 10--15 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 89.--Tricholoma sejunctum. Cap light yellow,\r\nstreaked with dark threads on the surface, viscid. Stem and gills white\r\n(natural size, often larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, umbonate, viscid when moist, light\r\nyellow in color and streaked with dark threads in the surface. The flesh\r\nis white, and very fragile, differing in this respect from _T.\r\nequestre_, which it resembles in general form. The =gills= are broad,\r\nrather distant, broadly notched near the stem, and easily separating\r\nfrom the stem. The =stem= is solid, smooth and shining white. Figure 89\r\nis from plants collected at Ithaca. It is said to be edible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 28, FIGURE 90.--Clitocybe candida. Entirely white\r\n(natural size).

Copyright.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLITOCYBE Fr.\r\n\r\nThe volva and annulus are wanting in this genus, and the spores are\r\nwhite. The stem is elastic, spongy within, the outside being elastic or\r\nfibrous, so that the fibres hold together well when the stem is twisted\r\nor broken, as in _Tricholoma_. The stem does not separate readily from\r\nthe pileus, but the rather strong fibres are continuous with the\r\nsubstance of the pileus. The gills are narrowed toward the stem, joined\r\nsquarely or decurrent (running down on the stem), very rarely some of\r\nthem notched at the stem while others of the same plant are decurrent.\r\nIn one species at least (_C. laccata_, by some placed in the genus\r\n_Laccaria_) the gills are often strongly notched or sinuate. The cap is\r\nusually plane, depressed, or funnel-shaped, many of the species having\r\nthe latter form. The plants grow chiefly on the ground, though a number\r\nof species occur on dead wood. The genus contains a very large number of\r\nspecies. Peck describes ten species in the 23rd Report, N. Y. State\r\nMus., p. 76, et. seq., also 48th Report, p. 172, several species.\r\nMorgan, Jour. Cinn. Soc. Nat. Hist. =6=: 70--73, describes 12 species.\r\n\r\n=Clitocybe candida= Bres. =Edible.=--This is one of the large species of\r\nthe genus. It occurs in late autumn in Europe. It has been found on\r\nseveral occasions during late autumn at Ithaca, N. Y., on the ground in\r\nopen woods, during wet weather. It occurs in clusters, though the\r\nspecimens are usually not crowded. The stem is usually very short, 2--4\r\ncm. long, and 2--3 cm. in thickness, while the cap is up to 10--18 cm.\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is sometimes regular, but often very irregular, and\r\nproduced much more strongly on one side than on the other. It is convex,\r\nthen expanded, the margin first incurved and finally wavy and often\r\nsomewhat lobed. The color is white or light buff in age. The flesh is\r\nthick and white. The =gills= are white, stout, broad, somewhat\r\ndecurrent, some adnate.\r\n\r\nThe taste is not unpleasant when raw, and when cooked it is agreeable. I\r\nhave eaten it on several occasions. Figures 90, 91 are from plants (No.\r\n4612 C. U. herbarium) collected at Ithaca.\r\n\r\n=Clitocybe laccata= Scop. =Edible.=--This plant is a very common and\r\nwidely distributed one, growing in woods, fields, roadsides and other\r\nwaste places. It is usually quite easily recognized from the whitish\r\nscurfy cap, the pink or purplish gills, though the spores are white,\r\nfrom the gills being either decurrent, adnate, or more or less strongly\r\nnotched, and the stem fibrous and whitish or of a pale pink color. When\r\nthe plants are mature the pale red or pink gills appear mealy from\r\nbeing covered with the numerous white spores.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is thin, convex or later expanded, of a watery appearance,\r\nnearly smooth or scurfy or slightly squamulose. The =spores= are\r\nrounded, and possess spine-like processes, or are prominently roughened.\r\nIn the warty character of the spores this species differs from most of\r\nthe species of the genus _Clitocybe_, and some writers place it in a\r\ndifferent genus erected to accommodate the species of _Clitocybe_ which\r\nhave warty or spiny spores. The species with spiny spores are few. The\r\ngenus in which this plant is placed by some is _Laccaria_, and then the\r\nplant is called _Laccaria laccata_. There are several other species of\r\n_Clitocybe_ which are common and which one is apt to run across often,\r\nespecially in the woods. These are of the funnel form type, the cap\r\nbeing more or less funnel-shaped. =Clitocybe infundibuliformis=\r\nSchaeffer is one of these. The cap, when mature, is pale red or tan\r\ncolor, fading out in age. It is 5--7 cm. high, and the cap 2--4 cm.\r\nbroad. It is considered delicious. =Clitocybe cyathiformis=, as its name\r\nindicates, is similar in form, and occurs in woods. The pileus is of a\r\ndarker color, dark brown or smoky in color.\r\n\r\n=Clitocybe illudens= Schw. =Not Edible.=--This species is distributed\r\nthrough the Eastern United States and sometimes is very abundant. It\r\noccurs from July to October about the bases of old stumps, dead trees,\r\nor from underground roots. It is one of the large species, the cap being\r\n15--20 cm. broad, the stem 12--20 cm. long, and 8--12 mm. in thickness.\r\nIt occurs in large clusters, several or many joined at their bases. From\r\nthe rich saffron yellow color of all parts of the plant, and especially\r\nby its strong phosphorescence, so evident in the dark, it is an easy\r\nplant to recognize. Because of its phosphorescence it is sometimes\r\ncalled \"Jack-my-lantern.\"\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then expanded, and depressed, sometimes with a\r\nsmall umbo, smooth, often irregular or eccentric from its crowded habit,\r\nand in age the margin of the pileus is wavy. The flesh is thick at the\r\ncenter and thin toward the margin. In old plants the color becomes\r\nsordid or brownish. The =gills= are broad, not crowded, decurrent, some\r\nextending for a considerable distance down on the stem while others for\r\na less distance. The =stem= is solid, firm, smooth, and tapers toward\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\nWhile the plant is not a dangerously poisonous one, it has occasioned\r\nserious cases of illness, acting as a violent emetic, and of course\r\nshould be avoided. Its phosphorescence has often been observed. Another\r\nand much smaller plant, widely distributed in this country as well as\r\nEurope, and belonging to another genus, is also phosphorescent. It is\r\n_Panus stipticus_, a small white plant with a short lateral stem,\r\ngrowing on branches, stumps, trunks, etc. When freshly developed the\r\nphosphorescence is marked, but when the plants become old they often\r\nfail to show it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 92.--Clitocybe illudens. Entire plant rich saffron\r\nyellow, old plants become sordid brown sometimes; when fresh shows\r\nphosphorescence at night (2/3 natural size, often much larger).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Clitocybe multiceps= Peck. =Edible.=--This plant is not uncommon during\r\nlate summer and autumn. It usually grows in large tufts of 10 to 30 or\r\nmore individuals. The caps in such large clusters are often irregular\r\nfrom pressure. The plants are 6--12 cm. high, the caps 5--10 cm. broad,\r\nand the stems 8--15 mm. in thickness. The =pileus= is white or gray,\r\nbrownish gray or buff, smooth, dry, the flesh white. The =gills= are\r\nwhite, crowded, narrow at each end. The =spores= are smooth, globose,\r\n5--7 µ in diameter. The stems are tough, fibrous, solid, tinged with the\r\nsame color as cap. Fig. 93 is from plants (No. 5467, C. U. herbarium)\r\ncollected at Ithaca, October 14, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLYBIA Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Collybia_ the annulus and volva are both wanting, the\r\nspores are white, the gills are free or notched, or sinuate. The stem is\r\neither entirely cartilaginous or has a cartilaginous rind, while the\r\ncentral portion of the stem is fibrous, or fleshy, stuffed or fistulose.\r\nThe pileus is fleshy and when the plants are young the margin of the\r\npileus is incurved or inrolled, i. e., it does not lie straight against\r\nthe stem as in _Mycena_.\r\n\r\nMany of the species of _Collybia_ are quite firm and will revive\r\nsomewhat after drying when moistened, but they are not coriaceous as in\r\n_Marasmius_, nor do they revive so thoroughly. It is difficult, however,\r\nto draw the line between the two genera. Twenty-five of the New York\r\nspecies of Collybia are described by Peck in the 49th Report N. Y. State\r\nMus., p. 32 et seq. Morgan describes twelve species in Jour. Cinn. Soc.\r\nNat. Hist., 6: 70--73.\r\n\r\n=Collybia radicata= Rehl. =Edible.=--This is one of the common and\r\nwidely distributed species of the genus. It occurs on the ground in the\r\nwoods or groves or borders of woods. It is quite easily recognized by\r\nthe more or less flattened cap, the long striate stem somewhat enlarged\r\nbelow and then tapering off into a long, slender root-like process in\r\nthe ground. It is from this \"rooting\" character that the plant gets its\r\nspecific name. It is 10--20 cm. high, the cap 3--7 cm. broad, and the\r\nstem 4--8 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, thin, convex to nearly plane, or even with the\r\nmargin upturned in old plants, and the center sometimes umbonate. It is\r\nsmooth, viscid when moist, and often with wrinkles on the surface which\r\nextend radially. The color varies from nearly white in some small\r\nspecimens to grayish, grayish brown or umber. The flesh is white. The\r\n=gills= are white, broad, rather distant, adnexed, i. e., joined to the\r\nstem by the upper angle. The =spores= are elliptical and about 15 × 10\r\nµ. The =stem= is the same color as the pileus though paler, and usually\r\nwhite above, tapers gradually above, is often striate or grooved, or\r\nsometimes only mealy. The long tapering \"root\" is often attached to some\r\nunderground dead root. Fig. 94 is from plants (No. 5641, C. U.\r\nherbarium) collected at Ithaca, August, 1900.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 30, FIGURE 93.--Clitocybe multiceps. Plants white\r\nor gray to buff or grayish brown.

Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Collybia velutipes= Curt. =Edible.=--This is very common in woods\r\nor groves during the autumn, on dead limbs or trunks, or from dead\r\nplaces in living ones. The plants are very viscid, and the stem, except\r\nin young plants, is velvety hairy with dark hairs. Figure 95 is from\r\nplants (No. 5430, C. U. herbarium) collected at Ithaca, October, 1900.\r\n\r\n=Collybia longipes= Bull., is a closely related plant. It is much\r\nlarger, has a velvety, to hairy, stem, and a much longer root-like\r\nprocess to the stem. It has been sometimes considered to be merely a\r\nvariety of _C. radicata_, and may be only a large form of that species.\r\nI have found a few specimens in the Adirondack mountains, and one in the\r\nBlue Ridge mountains, which seem to belong to this species.\r\n\r\n=Collybia platyphylla= Fr. =Edible.=--This is a much larger and stouter\r\nplant than _Collybia radicata_, though it is not so tall as the larger\r\nspecimens of that species. It occurs on rotten logs or on the ground\r\nabout rotten logs and stumps in the woods from June to September. It is\r\n8--12 cm. high, the cap 10--15 cm. broad, and the stem about 2 cm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex becoming expanded, plane, and even the margin\r\nupturned in age. It is whitish, varying to grayish brown or dark brown,\r\nthe center sometimes darker than the margin, as is usual in many plants.\r\nThe surface of the pileus is often marked in radiating streaks by fine\r\ndark hairs. The =gills= are white, very broad, adnexed, and usually\r\ndeeply and broadly notched next the stem. In age they are more or less\r\nbroken and cracked. The =spores= are white, elliptical, 7--10 × 6--7 µ.\r\n\r\nThe plant resembles somewhat certain species of _Tricholoma_ and care\r\nshould be used in selecting it in order to avoid the suspected species\r\nof _Tricholoma_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYCENA Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Mycena_ is closely related to _Collybia_. The plants are\r\nusually smaller, many of them being of small size, the cap is usually\r\nbell-shaped, rarely umbilicate, but what is a more important character\r\nthe margin of the cap in the young stage is straight as it is applied\r\nagainst the stem, and not at first incurved as it is in _Collybia_, when\r\nthe gills and margin of the pileus lie against the stem. The stem is\r\ncartilaginous as in _Collybia_, and is usually hollow or fistulose. The\r\ngills are not decurrent, or only slightly so by a tooth-like process.\r\nSome of the species are apt to be confused with certain species of\r\n_Omphalia_ in which the gills are but slightly decurrent, but in\r\n_Omphalia_ the pileus is umbilicate in such species, while in _Mycena_\r\nit is blunt or umbonate. The spores are white. A large number of the\r\nplants grow on leaves and wood, few on the ground. Some of those which\r\ngrow on leaves might be mistaken for species of _Marasmius_, but in\r\n_Marasmius_ the plants are of a tough consistency, and when dried will\r\nrevive again if moistened with water.\r\n\r\nSome of the plants have distinct odors, as alkaline, or the odor of\r\nradishes, and in collecting them notes should be made on all these\r\ncharacters which usually disappear in drying. A few of the plants exude\r\na colored or watery juice when bruised, and should not be confounded\r\nwith species of _Lactarius_.\r\n\r\n=Mycena galericulata= Scop. =Edible.=--_Mycena galericulata_ grows on\r\ndead logs, stumps, branches, etc., in woods. It is a very common and\r\nvery widely distributed species. It occurs from late spring to autumn.\r\nThe plants are clustered, many growing in a compact group, the hairy\r\nbases closely joined and the stems usually ascending. The plants are\r\nfrom 5--12 cm. high, the caps from 1--3 cm. broad, and the slender stems\r\n2--3 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is conic to bell-shaped, sometimes umbonate, striate to\r\nnear the center, and in color some shade of brown or gray, but variable.\r\nThe =gills= are decurrent by a tooth, not crowded, connected by veins\r\nover the interspaces, white or flesh colored. The slender =stems= are\r\nfirm, hollow, and hairy at the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 96.--Mycena polygramma, long-stemmed form growing\r\non ground (= M. prælonga Pk.). Cap dark brown with a leaden tint,\r\nstriate on margin; stem finely and beautifully longitudinally striate\r\n(natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Mycena polygramma= Bull.--This plant is very closely related to _M.\r\ngalericulata_, and has the same habit. It might be easily mistaken for\r\nit. It is easily distinguished by its peculiar bright, shining,\r\nlongitudinally striate to sulcate stem. It usually grows on wood, but\r\ndoes occur on the ground, when it often has a very long stem. In this\r\ncondition it was described by Peck in the 23rd Report, N. Y. State Mus.,\r\np. 81, as _Mycena prælonga_, from plants collected in a sphagnum moor\r\nduring the month of June. This form was also collected at Ithaca several\r\ntimes during late autumn in a woods near Ithaca, in 1898. The plants are\r\nfrom 12--20 cm. high, the cap 1--2 cm. broad, and the stem 2--3 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is first nearly cylindrical, then conic, becoming\r\nbell-shaped and finally nearly expanded, when it is umbonate. It is\r\nsmooth, striate on the margin, of a dark brown color with a leaden tint.\r\nThe =gills= are narrow, white, adnate and slightly decurrent on the stem\r\nby a tooth. The very long =stem= is smooth, but marked with parallel\r\ngrooves too fine to show in the photograph, firm, hollow, somewhat paler\r\nthan the pileus, usually tinged with red, and hairy at the base. Figure\r\n96 is from plants (No. 3113 C. U. herbarium), collected in a woods near\r\nIthaca in damp places among leaves. A number of the specimens collected\r\nwere attacked by a parasitic mucor of the genus _Spinellus_. Two\r\nspecies, _S. fusiger_ (Link.) van Tiegh., and _S. macrocarpus_ (Corda)\r\nKarst., were found, sometimes both on the same plant. The long-stalked\r\nsporangia bristle in all directions from the cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 97.--Mycena pura. Entire plant rose, rose purple,\r\nviolet, or lilac. Striate on margin of pileus (natural size, often much\r\nlarger).]\r\n\r\n=Mycena pura= Pers.--This plant is quite common and very widely\r\ndistributed, and occurs in woods and grassy open places, during late\r\nsummer and in the autumn. The entire plant is nearly of a uniform color,\r\nand the color varies from rose, to rose purple, violet, or lilac. Plants\r\nfrom the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina were chiefly rose\r\npurple, very young plants of a much deeper color (auricula purple of\r\nRidgeway), while those collected at Ithaca were violet. The plants vary\r\nfrom 5--8 cm. high, the cap 2--3 cm. broad, and the stem 2--4 mm. stout.\r\nThe plants are scattered or somewhat clustered, sometimes occurring\r\nsingly, and again many covering a small area of ground.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is thin, conic, bell-shaped to convex and nearly expanded,\r\nsometimes with a small umbo, smooth, and finely striate on the margin,\r\nin age the striæ sometimes rugulose from the upturning of the margin.\r\nSometimes the pileus is rugose on the center. The =gills= vary from\r\nwhite to violet, rose, etc., they are adnate to sinuate, and in age\r\nsometimes become free by breaking away from the stem. They are broad in\r\nthe middle, connected by vein-like elevations over the surface, and\r\nsometimes wavy and crenate on the edge, the edge of the gills sometimes\r\nwhite. The =spores= are white, oblong, 2.5--3.5 × 6--7 µ, smooth. The\r\n=basidia= are cylindrical, 20--25 × 3--4 µ, four-spored. There are a few\r\n=cystidia= in the hymenium, colorless, thin walled, clavate, the portion\r\nabove the hymenium cylindrical, and 30--40 × 10--12 µ.\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is sometimes white when young, but later becomes of the same\r\ncolor as the pileus, often a lighter shade above. It is straight, or\r\nascending, cylindrical, even, smooth, hollow, with a few white threads\r\nat the base.\r\n\r\nSometimes on drying the pileus becomes deeper in color than when fresh.\r\nThe gills also become deeper in color in drying, though the edge remains\r\nwhite if white when fresh. Figure 97 is from plants (No. 3946, C. U.\r\nherbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N. C., in August, 1899.

It grows in woods or grassy\r\nplaces, or among moss, etc., on the ground or on very rotten wood. The\r\nplants are from 5--10 cm. high, the cap 1--2 cm. broad, and the stem\r\nabout 2 mm. in thickness. It is widely distributed in Europe, America,\r\nand other North temperate countries.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is viscid when moist, ovate to conic or campanulate, and\r\nlater more or less expanded, obtuse, the margin striate, and sometimes\r\nminutely toothed. The usual color is grayish, but in age it often\r\nbecomes reddish. The =gills= are decurrent by a small tooth, and quite\r\nvariable in color, whitish, then gray, or tinged with blue or red.\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is very slender, flexuous, or straight, fistulose, tough,\r\nwith soft hairs at the base, usually yellowish, sometimes the same color\r\nas the cap, and viscid like the cap when moist. Figure 98 is from plants\r\n(No. 4547, C. U. herbarium) collected at Ithaca in August, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Mycena vulgaris= Pers.--This common and pretty species is easily\r\nrecognized by its smoky or grayish color, the umbilicate pileus and very\r\nslimy stem. It grows on decaying leaves, sticks, etc., in woods. It\r\noccurs in clusters. The plants are small, 3--5 cm. high, the cap 4--7\r\nmm. broad, and the stem about 1.5 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is thin, bell-shaped, then convex, and depressed at the\r\ncenter, with a papilla usually in the center, finely striate on the\r\nmargin, and slightly viscid. The =gills= are white, thin, and finally\r\ndecurrent, so that from the form of the cap and the decurrent gills the\r\nplant has much the appearance of an _Omphalia_. The =stem= is very\r\nviscid, grayish in color, often rooting at the base, and with white\r\nfibrils at the base, becoming hollow.\r\n\r\nFigure 99 is from plants collected in woods near Ithaca, during August,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 99.--Mycena vulgaris.

It is smooth, striate on the\r\nmargin, and of a rich vermilion or orange color. The =gills= are rounded\r\nat the stem and adnexed, rather broad in the middle, distant, yellow,\r\nthe edge white, or sometimes the gills are entirely white. The =stem= is\r\nvery slender, with a root-like process entering the rotten wood, smooth\r\nexcept the hairs on the root-like process, yellow.\r\n\r\nFigure 100 is from plants (No. 2780, C.

The plants are 6--9 cm. high,\r\nthe cap 1--2 cm. broad, and the stem not quite 2 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is ovate to convex, viscid when young. The color is bright\r\nblue when young, becoming pale and whitish in age, with a tendency to\r\nfuscous on the center. The cap is smooth and the margin finely striate.\r\nAfter the plants have dried the color is nearly uniform ochraceous or\r\ntawny. The =gills= are close, free, narrow, white, then grayish white,\r\nthe edge finely toothed or fimbriate. The =spores= are globose, smooth,\r\n6--9 µ. The =stem= is slender, hollow, faintly purple when young,\r\nbecoming whitish or flesh color, flexuous, or nearly straight, even,\r\noften two united at the base into a root-like extension which enters the\r\nrotten wood. The base of the stem is covered with deep blue mycelium\r\nwhich retains its color in age, but disappears on drying after a time.\r\nFigure 101 is from plants (No. 2382, C.

It is\r\neasily recognized by its dense cespitose habit, the deep blood red\r\njuice, the hollow stem, and the crenate or denticulate sterile margin of\r\nthe cap. Numbers of the plant occur usually in a single cluster, and\r\ntheir bases are closely joined and hairy. The stems are more or less\r\nascending according to the position of the plant on the wood. The plants\r\nare 5--10 cm. high, the cap is 1--2.5 cm. broad, and the stem 2--3 mm.\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 101.--Mycena cyanothrix.

The color varies from whitish to flesh color, or dull\r\nred, and appears more or less saturated with a red juice. The thin\r\nmargin extends a short distance beyond the ends of the gills, and the\r\nmargin is then beautifully crenate. The =gills= are adnate, and often\r\nextend down on the stem a short distance by a little tooth. The =stem=\r\nis firm, sometimes smooth, sometimes with minute hairs, at the base\r\nwith long hairs, hollow, in color the same as that of the pileus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 102.--Mycena hæmatopa.

Figure 102 is from plants collected at Ithaca,\r\nin August, 1899. It is widely distributed in Europe and North America.\r\n\r\n=Mycena succosa= Pk., another species of _Mycena_ with a juice, occurs\r\non very rotten wood in the woods. It is a small plant, dull white at\r\nfirst, but soon spotted with black, and turning black in handling or\r\nwhere bruised, and when dried. Wounds exude a \"serum-like juice,\" and\r\nthe wounds soon become black. It was described by Peck under _Collybia_\r\nin the 25th Report, p. 74.\r\n\r\n\r\nOMPHALIA Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Omphalia_ is closely related to _Mycena_ and _Collybia_. It\r\ndiffers from these mainly in the decurrent gills. In the small species\r\nof _Mycena_ where the gills are slightly decurrent, the pileus is not\r\numbilicate as it is in corresponding species of _Omphalia_. In some of\r\nthe species of _Omphalia_ the pileus is not umbilicate, but here the\r\ngills are plainly decurrent. The stem is cartilaginous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 33, FIGURE 103.--Omphalia campanella. Watkin's\r\nGlen, N. Y., August, 1898. Caps dull reddish-yellow. Gills yellow.

Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Omphalia campanella= Batsch.--One of the most common and widely\r\ndistributed species of the genus is the little bell-omphalia, _Omphalia\r\ncampanella_. It occurs throughout the summer and autumn on dead or\r\nrotten logs, stumps, branches, etc., in woods. It is often clustered,\r\nlarge numbers covering a considerable surface of the decaying log. It is\r\n1--3 cm. high, the cap 8--20 mm. broad, and the stem very slender.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, umbilicate, faintly striate, dull reddish\r\nyellow, in damp weather with a watery appearance. The =gills= are\r\nnarrow, yellow, connected by veins, strongly curved because of the form\r\nof the pileus, and then being decurrent on the stem. The =stem= is\r\nslender, often ascending, brownish hairy toward the base, and paler\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 104.--Omphalia epichysium.

The smoky, or dull gray color of the entire plant, the\r\ndepressed or funnel-shaped pileus, and short, slender stem serve to\r\ndistinguish it. The cap is 2--4 cm. broad, the plant is 3--5 cm. high,\r\nand the stem 2--4 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, becoming expanded, umbilicate or depressed at\r\nthe center or nearly funnel-shaped, smooth, smoky or gray with a\r\nsaturated watery appearance, light gray or nearly white when dry. The\r\n=gills= are narrow, crowded, or a little decurrent. The slender =stem=\r\nis smooth, hollow, equal. Figure 104 is from plants (No. 3373, C. U.\r\nherbarium) collected in woods near Ithaca, N.

Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pleurotus_ is usually recognized without difficulty among the\r\nfleshy, white-spored agarics, because of the eccentric (not quite in the\r\ncenter of the pileus) or lateral stem, or by the pileus being attached\r\nat one side in a more or less shelving position, or in some species\r\nwhere the upper side of the pileus lies directly against the wood on\r\nwhich the plant is growing, and is then said to be _resupinate_. The\r\ngills are either decurrent (extending downward) on the stem, or in some\r\nspecies they are rounded or notched at the junction with the stem. There\r\nis no annulus, though sometimes a veil, and the genus resembles both\r\n_Tricholoma_ and _Clitocybe_, except for the position of the stem on the\r\npileus. In _Tricholoma_ and _Clitocybe_ the stem is usually attached at\r\nthe center, and the majority of the species grow on the ground, while\r\nthe species of _Pleurotus_ are especially characterized by growing on\r\nwood. Some species, at least, appear to grow from the ground, as in\r\nPleurotus petaloides, which is sometimes found growing on buried roots\r\nor portions of decayed stumps which no longer show above ground. On the\r\nother hand species of _Clitocybe_, as in C. candida (Fig. 91), often\r\nhave an eccentric stem. This presents to us one of the many difficulties\r\nwhich students, especially beginners, of this group of fungi meet, and\r\nalso suggests how unsatisfactory any arrangement of genera as yet\r\nproposed is.\r\n\r\n=Pleurotus ulmarius= Bull. =Edible.=--The elm pleurotus is so called\r\nbecause it is often found growing on dead elm branches or trunks, or\r\nfrom wounds in living trees, but it is not confined to the elm. It is a\r\nlarge species, easily distinguished from the oyster agaric and the other\r\nrelated species by its long stem attached usually near the center of the\r\ncap, and by the gills being rounded or notched at their inner extremity.\r\nThe cap is 5--12 cm. broad, the stem 5--10 cm. long, and 1--2 cm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 106.--Pleurotus ulmarius.

The =gills= are broad, rather distant,\r\nsinuate, white or nearly so. The =spores= are globose, 5--8 µ in\r\ndiameter. The =stem= is firm, eccentric, usually curved because of its\r\nlateral attachment on the side of the tree, and the horizontal position\r\nof the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe elm pleurotus has been long known as an edible fungus, and is\r\nregarded as an excellent one for food on account of its flavor and\r\nbecause of its large size. It occurs abundantly during the late autumn,\r\nand at this season of the year is usually well protected from the\r\nattacks of insects. It occurs in the woods, or fields, more frequently\r\non dead trees. On shade trees which have been severely pruned, and are\r\nnearly or quite dead, it sometimes appears at the wounds, where limbs\r\nhave been removed, in great abundance. In the plants shown in Fig. 105\r\nthe stems are strongly curved because the weight of the cap bore the\r\nplant downward. Sometimes when the plant is growing directly on the\r\nupper side of a branch or log, the stem may be central.\r\n\r\n=Pleurotus ostreatus= Jacq. =Edible.=--This plant is known as the oyster\r\nagaric, because the form of the plant sometimes suggests the outline of\r\nan oyster shell, as is seen in Fig. 107. It grows on dead trunks and\r\nbranches, usually in crowded clusters, the caps often overlapping or\r\nimbricated. It is large, measuring 8--20 cm. or more broad.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is elongated and attached at one side by being sessile, or\r\nit is narrowed into a very short stem. It is broadest at the outer\r\nextremity, where it becomes quite thin toward the margin. It is more or\r\nless curved in outline as seen from the side, being depressed usually on\r\nthe upper side near the point of attachment, and toward the margin\r\nconvex and the margin incurved. The color is white, light gray, buff or\r\ndark gray, often becoming yellowish on drying. The =gills= are white,\r\nbroad, not much crowded, and run down on the stem in long elevated lines\r\nresembling veins, which anastomose often in a reticulate fashion. The\r\n=spores= are white, oblong, 7--10 µ long. The =stem= when present is\r\nvery short, and often hairy at the base.\r\n\r\nThe oyster agaric has long been known as an edible mushroom, but it is\r\nnot ranked among the best, because, like most _Pleuroti_, it is rather\r\ntough, especially in age. It is well to select young plants. Figure 107\r\nis from plants (No. 2097, C. U. herbarium) collected at Ithaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 34, FIGURE 107.--Pleurotus ostreatus.

It grows on a number of different kinds of trees. The stems are\r\noften joined at the base, but sometimes the plants are scattered over\r\na portion of the branch or trunk. The cap is from 5--10 cm. broad.\r\nThe plants occur from June to November.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 35, FIGURE 108.--Pleurotus sapidus. Color of cap\r\nwhite, yellowish, gray, or brownish, with lilac tints sometimes. Spores\r\nlilac tinted in mass (1/2 natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, the margin incurved when young, and more or less\r\ndepressed in age, smooth, broadened toward the margin and tapering into\r\nthe short stem, which is very short in some cases and elongated in\r\nothers. Often the caps are quite irregular and the margin wavy,\r\nespecially when old. It is quite firm, but the margin splits quite\r\nreadily on being handled. The color varies greatly, white, yellowish,\r\ngray, or brownish and lilac tints. The flesh is white. The =stems= are\r\nusually attached to the pileus, at or near one edge. The =gills= are\r\nwhite, broad, not at all crowded, and extend down on the stem as in the\r\noyster agaric. They are white or whitish, and as in the other related\r\nspecies are sometimes cracked, due probably to the tension brought to\r\nbear because of the expanding pileus. The =spores= are tinged with lilac\r\nwhen seen in mass, as when caught on paper. The color seems to be\r\nintensified after the spores have lain on the paper for a day or two.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to distinguish this species from the oyster agaric.\r\nThe color of the spores seems to be the only distinguishing character,\r\nand this may not be constant. Peck suggests that it may only be a\r\nvariety of the oyster agaric. I have found the plant growing from a dead\r\nspot on the base of a living oak tree. There was for several years a\r\ndrive near this tree, and the wheels of vehicles cut into the roots of\r\nthe tree on this side, and probably so injured it as to kill a portion\r\nand give this fungus and another one (_Polystictus pergamenus_) a start,\r\nand later they have slowly encroached on the side of the tree.\r\n\r\nFigure 108 represents the plant (No. 3307, C. U. herbarium) from a dead\r\nmaple trunk in a woods near Ithaca, collected during the autumn of 1899.\r\nThis plant compares favorably with the oyster agaric as an edible one.\r\nNeither of these plants preserve as well as the elm pleurotus.\r\n\r\n=Pleurotus dryinus= Pers. =Edible.=--_Pleurotus dryinus_ represents a\r\nsection of the genus in which the species are provided with a veil when\r\nyoung, but which disappears as the pileus expands. This species has been\r\nlong known in Europe on trunks of oak, ash, willow, etc., and occurs\r\nthere from September to October. It was collected near Ithaca, N. Y., in\r\na beech woods along Six-mile creek, on October 24th, 1898, growing from\r\na decayed knothole in the trunk of a living hickory tree, and again in a\r\nfew days from a decayed stump. The pileus varies from 5--10 cm. broad,\r\nand the lateral or eccentric stem is 2--12 cm. long by 1--2 cm. in\r\nthickness, the length of the stem depending on the depth of the\r\ninsertion of the stem in a hollow portion of the trunk. The plant is\r\nwhite or whitish, and the substance is quite firm, drying quite hard.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, more or less depressed in the\r\ncenter, the margin involute, and the surface at first floccose, becoming\r\nin age floccose scaly, since the surface breaks up into triangular\r\nscales more prominent in and near the center, smaller and inconspicuous\r\ntoward the margin. The prevailing color is white, but in age the scales\r\nbecome cream color or buff (in European plants said to become fuscous).\r\nThe pileus is either definitely lateral (Fig. 109) or eccentric when the\r\nstem is attached near the center as in Fig. 110. The =gills= are white,\r\nbecoming tinged with yellow in age, decurrent (running down on the stem)\r\nin striæ for short distances, 4--5 mm. broad, not crowded. The =stem= is\r\nnearly central (Fig. 110), or definitely lateral (Fig. 109), the length\r\nvarying according to conditions as stated above. It is firm, tough,\r\nfibrous. The =veil= is prominent in young and medium plants, floccose,\r\ntearing irregularly as the pileus expands.\r\n\r\nFigure 110 is from plants (No. 2478a C. U. herbarium) growing from\r\nknothole in living hickory tree, and Fig. 109 from plants (No. 2478b)\r\ngrowing on a dead stump, near Ithaca.\r\n\r\nAccording to the descriptions of _P. dryinus_ as given by Persoon, and\r\nas followed by Fries and most later writers, the pileus is definitely\r\nlateral, and more or less dimidiate, while in _P. corticatus_ Fr., the\r\npileus is entire and the stem rather long and eccentric. Stevenson\r\nsuggests (p. 166) that corticatus is perhaps too closely allied to\r\ndryinus. The plants in our Fig. 110 agree in all respects with _P.\r\ncorticatus_, except that possibly the lamellæ do not anastomose on the\r\nstem as they are said to in _corticatus_. According to the usual\r\ndescriptions _corticatus_ is given as the larger species, while Fig. 109\r\nof our plant, possessing the typical characters of _dryinus_, is the\r\nlarger. The form of the pileus, the length and position of the stem,\r\ndepends, as we know, to a large extent on the position of the plant on\r\nthe tree. When growing from the upper side, so that there is room above\r\nfor the expansion of the cap, the pileus is apt to be more regular, just\r\nas is the case in _Pleurotus ulmarius_, and the stem more nearly\r\ncentral. When the plant grows from a hollow place in the trunk as those\r\nshown in Fig. 110 did, then there is an opportunity for them to grow\r\nmore or less erect, at least until they emerge from the hollow, and then\r\nthe pileus is more nearly equal in its expansion and the stem is longer.\r\nBerkeley describes specimens of P. dryinus with long stems growing\r\nfrom a hollow in an ash, and Stevenson (p. 167) reports the same\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 36, FIGURE 109.--Pleurotus dryinus.

Y., during the autumn of 1898, on rotting logs, Ithaca Flats,\r\nand again in Enfield Gorge, six miles from Ithaca. The plants are from\r\n5--8 cm. high, the cap 3--5 cm. broad, and the stem 5--7 mm. in\r\nthickness, and the entire plant is of a dull, or pale, yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 37, FIGURE 110.--Pleurotus dryinus, form\r\ncorticatus.

The =gills= are rather\r\ncrowded, broad, rounded or notched at the stem, pale yellow. The\r\n=spores= are elliptical, 7--9 × 5--6 µ. The =stem= is ascending and\r\ncurved, nearly or quite central in some specimens in its attachment to\r\nthe pileus, whitish or yellowish, mealy or slightly tomentose at the\r\napex.\r\n\r\nFigure 111 is from plants (No. 2953, C.

The plant usually grows in a nearly upright or more or less\r\nascending position, or when it grows from the side of a trunk it is\r\nsomewhat shelving. It is somewhat spathulate in form, i. e., broad at\r\nthe free end and tapering downward into the short stem in a\r\nwedge-shaped manner, and varies from 2--10 cm. long and 1--5 cm. in\r\nbreadth. It grows on fallen branches or trunks, on stumps, and often\r\napparently from the ground, but in reality from underground roots or\r\nburied portions of decayed stumps, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 112.--Pleurotus petaloides.

More irregular form\r\nthan that shown in figure 112; color same as there described (natural\r\nsize).

The margin is at first involute,\r\nfinally fully expanded, and the upper surface is nearly plane or\r\nsomewhat depressed. The color is often a pale reddish brown, or brown,\r\nand sometimes pure white. The margin is sometimes marked with fine\r\nstriations when moist. The upper portion near the union with the stem is\r\nsometimes tomentose, sometimes smooth. The =gills= are narrow, white, or\r\nyellowish, crowded and strongly decurrent. While the plant varies\r\ngreatly in form and size, it is easily recognized by the presence of\r\nnumerous short whitish =cystidia= in the hymenium, which bristle over\r\nthe surface of the hymenium and under a pocket lens present a \"fuzzy\"\r\nappearance to the lamellæ. They are 70--80 × 10--12 µ. The spores are\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nFigures 112, 113 are from plants collected at Ithaca.\r\n\r\n=Pleurotus serotinus= Schrad. This is an interesting plant and occurs\r\nduring the autumn on dead trunks, branches, etc., in the woods. The stem\r\nis wanting, and the cap is shelving, dimidiate, reniform or\r\nsuborbicular. The plants occur singly or are clustered and overlapping,\r\nabout the same size and position as _Claudopus nidulans_, from which it\r\nis readily told by its white gills and spores. The color varies from\r\ndull yellow to brownish, often with shades of olive or green.\r\n\r\n=Pleurotus applicatus= Batsch.--This is a pretty little species and\r\nusually occurs on much decayed wood, lying close to the ground so that\r\nit is usually directly on the under side of the log or branch. It does\r\noccur, however, on the side of the log when it is more or less shelving,\r\nbecause of the tendency of the pileus always to be more or less\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 114.--Pleurotus applicatus. Color gray to dark\r\nbluish gray, or black with a bluish tinge (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is 4--6 mm. broad, its upper surface closely applied to the\r\nwood or bark on which it is growing when it appears directly on the\r\nunder side. The margin is sometimes free and involute. Sometimes it is\r\nattached only by the center of the pileus. There is then often a short\r\nprocess. When it grows on the side of the log it is attached laterally,\r\nor on the upper side of one margin, while the greater portion of the\r\npileus is free and shelving. The surface is smooth or somewhat hairy.\r\nThe color varies from gray to dark bluish gray, or black with a bluish\r\ntinge. The =gills= are thick, broad in proportion to the size of the\r\ncap, distant, and are said by some to be paler than the pileus. In\r\nplants collected at Ithaca, the gills are often as dark as the pileus.\r\nThe entire plant is rather tough, and revives after being dried if\r\nplaced in water, resembling in this respect _Marasmius_, _Panus_, or\r\n_Trogia_, and it may be more nearly related to one of these.

Entirely white with\r\ngolden yellow granules on cap and stem (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Hygrophorus_ is one which presents some difficulties in the\r\ncase of some of the species, especially to beginners, and plants need to\r\nbe studied in the fresh condition to understand the most important\r\ncharacter which separates it from certain of the other white-spored\r\nagarics. The substance of the pileus is continuous with that of the\r\nstem, that is, the stem is not easily separated from the cap at the\r\npoint of junction, but is more or less tenacious. The gills may be\r\nadnexed, adnate, sinuate, or decurrent, but what is important they are\r\nusually rather distant, the edge is acute or sharp, and gradually\r\nthickened toward the junction with the cap, so that a section of the\r\ngill is more or less triangular. This is brought about by the fact that\r\nthe substance of the cap extends downward into the gill between the\r\nlaminæ or surfaces of the gill. But the most important character for\r\ndetermining the genus is the fact that the surfaces of the gills become\r\nrather of a waxy consistency at maturity, so that they appear to be full\r\nof a watery substance though they do not bleed, and the surface of the\r\ngill can be rather easily removed, leaving the projecting line of the\r\n_trama_. This is more marked in some species than in others. The waxy\r\nconsistency of the gills then, with the gills acute at the edge, broad\r\nat the point of attachment to the pileus, and the gills being rather\r\nwidely separated are the important characters in determining the species\r\nwhich belong to this genus. The nearest related genus is Cantharellus,\r\nwhich, however, has blunt and forked gills. A number of the plants are\r\nbrilliantly colored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 38, FIGURE 116.--Hygrophorus eburneus. Entirely\r\nwhite, slimy (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Hygrophorus chrysodon= (Batsch.) Fries. =Edible.=--This plant has about\r\nthe same range as _Hygrophorus eburneus_, though it is said to be rare.\r\nIt is a very pretty plant and one quite easily recognised because of the\r\nuniform white ground color of the entire plant when fresh, and the\r\nnumerous golden floccules or squamules scattered over the cap and the\r\nstem. The name _chrysodon_ means golden tooth, and refers to these\r\nnumerous golden flecks on the plant. A form of the plant, variety\r\n_leucodon_, is said to occur in which these granules are white. The\r\nplant is 4--7 cm. high, the cap 4--7 cm. broad, and the stem 6--10 mm.\r\nin thickness. The plants grow on the ground in the woods, or rather open\r\nplaces, during late summer and autumn.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then expanded, the margin strongly involute when\r\nyoung, and unrolling as the cap expands, very viscid, so that particles\r\nof dirt and portions of leaves, etc., cling to it in drying. The golden\r\nor light yellow granules on the surface are rather numerous near the\r\nmargin of the pileus, but are scattered over the entire surface. On the\r\nmargin they sometimes stand in concentric rows close together. The\r\n=gills= are white, distant, decurrent, 3--6 mm. broad, white, somewhat\r\nyellowish in age and in drying, and connected by veins. The =spores=\r\nwhite, oval to ovate, the longer ones approaching elliptical, 6--10 ×\r\n5--6 µ.\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is soft, spongy within, nearly equal, white, the yellowish\r\ngranules scattered over the surface, but more numerous toward the apex,\r\nwhere they are often arranged in the form of a ring. When the plant is\r\nyoung these yellow granules or squamules on the stem and the upper\r\nsurface of the inrolled margin of the pileus meet, forming a continuous\r\nlayer in the form of a veil, which becomes spread out in the form of\r\nseparated granules as the pileus expands, and no free collar is left on\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\nFigure 115 is from plants (No. 3108, C. U. herbarium) collected in\r\nOctober, 1898, in woods, and by roadsides, Ithaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\n=Hygrophorus eburneus= (Bulliard) Fries. =Edible.=--This plant is widely\r\ndistributed in Europe and America. It is entirely white, of medium size,\r\nvery viscid or glutinous, being entirely covered with a coating of\r\ngluten, which makes it very slippery in handling. The odor is mild and\r\nnot unpleasant like that of a closely related species, _H. cossus_. The\r\nplants are 6--15 cm. high, the cap is from 3--8 cm. broad, and the stem\r\n3--8 mm. in thickness. It grows on the ground in woods, or in open\r\ngrassy places.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, moderately thick, sometimes thin, convex to\r\nexpanded, the margin uneven or sometimes wavy, smooth, and shining. When\r\nyoung the margin of the cap is incurved. The =gills= are strongly\r\ndecurrent, distant, with vein-like elevations near the stem. =Spores=\r\nrather long, oval, 6--10 × 5--6 µ, granular. The =stem= varies in\r\nlength, it is spongy to stuffed within, sometimes hollow and tapers\r\nbelow. The slime which envelops the plant is sometimes so abundant as to\r\nform a veil covering the entire plant and extending across from the\r\nmargin of the cap to the stem, covering the gills. As the plant dries\r\nthis disappears, and does not leave an annulus on the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 117.--Hygrophorus fuligineus.

Y. State Museum, p. 134. It is an\r\nAmerican plant, and was first collected at West Albany, during the month\r\nof November. It is one of the largest species of the genus, and grows on\r\nthe ground in woods, in late autumn. The plants are 5--10 cm. high, the\r\ncap from 3--10 cm. broad, and the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness. The large\r\nsize of the plant together with the smoky, brown, viscid cap aid in the\r\nrecognition of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, becoming expanded, smooth, very viscid, dull\r\nreddish brown or smoky brown, darker on the center; the margin of the\r\npileus is even in young specimens, becoming irregular in others; and in\r\nage often elevated more or less. The =gills= are broad, distant, usually\r\ndecurrent, often connected by veins, white, with yellowish tinge in\r\ndrying. The =spores= oval to elliptical, 8--12 × 5--7 µ. The =stem= is\r\nstout, sometimes ascending, equal, or enlarged in the middle, or\r\ntapering toward the base, solid, viscid like the pileus, usually white,\r\nsometimes tinged with the same color as pileus, somewhat yellowish\r\ntinged in drying.\r\n\r\nFigure 117 is from plants (No. 2546, C. U. herbarium) collected in\r\nEnfield Gorge near Ithaca, Nov. 5, 1898.\r\n\r\n=Hygrophorus pratensis= (Pers.) Fr. =Edible.=--This hygrophorus grows on\r\nthe ground in pastures, old fields, or in waste places, or in thin and\r\nopen woods, from mid-summer to late autumn. The plants are 3--5 cm.\r\nhigh, the cap 2--5 cm. or more broad, and the stem 6--12 mm. in\r\nthickness. The cap being thick at the center, and the stem being usually\r\nstouter at the apex, often gives to the plant a shape like that of a\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is hemispherical, then convex, then nearly or quite\r\nexpanded, white, or with various shades of yellow or tawny, or buff, not\r\nviscid, often cracking in dry weather. Flesh very thick at the center,\r\nthinner at the margin. The flesh is firm and white. The =gills= are\r\nstout, distant, long decurrent, white or yellowish, and arcuate when the\r\nmargin of the pileus is incurved in the young state, then ascending as\r\nthe pileus takes the shape of an inverted cone. The =gills= are\r\nconnected across the interspaces by vein-like folds, or elevations. The\r\n=spores= are nearly globose to ovate or nearly elliptical, white, 6--8 ×\r\n5--6 µ. The =stem= is smooth, firm outside and spongy within, tapering\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\n=Hygrophorus miniatus= Fr. The vermilion hygrophorus is a very common\r\nplant in the woods during the summer. The cap and stem are bright red,\r\nsometimes vermilion. The gills are yellow and often tinged with red. The\r\ngills are adnate or sinuate. The plant is a small one but often\r\nabundant, and measures from 3--5 cm. high, and the cap 2--4 cm. broad.\r\n=Hygrophorus coccineus= (Schaeff.) Fr., is a somewhat larger plant and\r\nwith a scarlet cap, which becomes yellowish in age, and the gills are\r\nadnate. =Hygrophorus conicus= (Scop.) Fr., is another bright red plant\r\nwith a remarkable conical pileus, and the gills are annexed to free.\r\n\r\n=Hygrophorus psittacinus= Fr., is a remarkably pretty plant, the cap\r\nbeing from bell-shaped to expanded, umbilicate, striate, and covered\r\nwith a greenish slime. It occurs in woods and open places. The\r\nprevailing color is yellow, tinged with green, but it varies greatly,\r\nsometimes yellow, red, white, etc., but nearly always is marked by the\r\npresence of the greenish slime, the color of this disappearing as the\r\nplant dries. It occurs in pastures, open woods, etc., from mid-summer to\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\n=Hygrophorus hypothejus= Fr., is another very variable plant in color as\r\nwell as in size, varying from yellow, orange, reddish, sometimes paler,\r\nusually first grayish when covered with the olive colored slime. The\r\ngills are decurrent, white, then yellow. It occurs in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACTARIUS Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Lactarius_ is easily distinguished from nearly all the other\r\nagarics by the presence of a milky or colored juice which exudes from\r\nwounded, cut, or broken places on the fresh plant. There are a few of\r\nthe species of the genus _Mycena_ which exude a watery or colored juice\r\nwhere wounded, but these are easily told from _Lactarius_ because of\r\ntheir small size, more slender habit, and bell-shaped cap. By careful\r\nobservation of these characters it is quite an easy matter to tell\r\nwhether or not the plant at hand is a _Lactarius_. In addition to the\r\npresence of this juice or milk as it is commonly termed, the entire\r\nplant while firm is quite brittle, especially the gills. There are\r\ngroups of rounded or vesiculose cells intermingled with thread-like\r\ncells in the substance of the cap. This latter character can only be\r\nseen on examination with the microscope. The brittleness of the plant as\r\nwell as the presence of these groups of vesiculose cells is shared by\r\nthe genus _Russula_, which is at once separated from _Lactarius_ by the\r\nabsence of a juice which exudes in drops.\r\n\r\nIn determining the species it is a very important thing to know the\r\ntaste of the juice or of the fresh plant, whether it is peppery, or\r\nbitter, or mild, that is, tasteless. If one is careful not to swallow\r\nany of the juice or flesh of the plant no harm results from tasting any\r\nof the plants, provided they are not tasted too often during a short\r\ntime, beyond the unpleasant sensation resulting from tasting some of\r\nthe very \"hot\" kinds. It is important also to know the color of the milk\r\nwhen it first exudes from wounds and if it changes color on exposure to\r\nthe air. These tests of the plant should be made of course while it is\r\nfresh. The spores are white, globose or nearly so in all species, and\r\nusually covered with minute spiny processes. There are a large number of\r\nspecies. Peck, 38th Report, N. Y. State Mus., pp. 111--133, describes 40\r\nAmerican species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 118.--Lactarius corrugis. Showing corrugated cap,\r\nand white milk exuding. Dark tawny brown, gills orange brown (natural\r\nsize, often larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lactarius volemus= Fr. =Edible.=--This species is by some termed the\r\norange brown lactarius because of its usual color. It was probably\r\ntermed _Lactarius volemus_ because of the voluminous quantity of milk\r\nwhich exudes where the plant is broken or bruised, though it is not the\r\nonly species having this character. In fresh, young plants, a mere crack\r\nor bruise will set loose quantities of the milky juice which drops\r\nrapidly from the plant. The plant is about the size of _Lactarius\r\ndeliciosus_ and occurs in damp woods, where it grows in considerable\r\nabundance from July to September, several usually growing near each\r\nother. The =pileus= is convex, then expanded, often with a small\r\nelevation (umbo) at the center, or sometimes plane, and when old a\r\nlittle depressed in the center, smooth or somewhat wrinkled. The cap is\r\ndull orange or tawny, the shade of color being lighter in some plants\r\nand darker in others. The flesh is white and quite firm. The =gills= are\r\nwhite, often tinged with the same color as the pileus, but much lighter;\r\nthey are adnate or slightly decurrent. The =stem= is usually short, but\r\nvaries from 3--10 × 1--2 cm. It is colored like the pileus, but a\r\nlighter shade.\r\n\r\nThe milk is white, abundant, mild, not unpleasant to the taste, but\r\nsticky as it dries. This plant has also long been known as one of the\r\nexcellent mushrooms for food both in Europe and America. Peck states\r\nthat there are several plants which resemble _Lactarius volemus_ in\r\ncolor and in the milk, but that no harm could come from eating them.\r\nThere is one with a more reddish brown pileus, _Lactarius rufus_, found\r\nsparingly in the woods, but which has a very peppery taste. It is said\r\nby some to be poisonous.\r\n\r\n=Lactarius corrugis= Pk. =Edible.=--This species occurs with _Lactarius\r\nvolemus_ and very closely resembles it, but it is of a darker color, and\r\nthe pileus is more often marked by prominent wrinkles, from which\r\ncharacter the plant has derived its specific name. It is perhaps a\r\nlittle stouter plant than _L. volemus_, and with a thicker cap. The\r\nsurface of the =pileus= seems to be covered with a very fine velvety\r\ntomentum which glistens as the cap is turned in the light. The =gills=\r\nare much darker than in _L. volemus_. The plants are usually clearly\r\nseparated on account of these characters, yet there are occasionally\r\nlight colored forms of _L. corrugis_ which are difficult to distinguish\r\nfrom dark forms of _L. volemus_, and this fact has aroused the suspicion\r\nthat _corrugis_ is only a form of _volemus_.\r\n\r\nThe milk is very abundant and in every respect agrees with that of _L.\r\nvolemus_. I do not know that any one has tested _L. corrugis_ for food.\r\nBut since it is so closely related to _L. volemus_ I tested it during\r\nthe summer of 1899 in the North Carolina mountains. I consider it\r\nexcellent. The methods of cooking there were rather primitive. It was\r\nsliced and fried with butter and salt. It should be well cooked, for\r\nwhen not well done the partially raw taste is not pleasant. The plant\r\nwas very abundant in the woods, and for three weeks an abundance was\r\nserved twice a day for a table of twelve persons. The only disagreeable\r\nfeature about it is the sticky character of the milk, which adheres in\r\nquantity to the hands and becomes black. This makes the preparation of\r\nthe plant for the broiler a rather unpleasant task.\r\n\r\nFigure 118 is from plants (No. 3910, C. U. herbarium) collected in the\r\nwoods at Blowing Rock, during September, 1899. Just before the exposure\r\nwas made to get the photograph several of the plants were wounded with a\r\npin to cause the drops of milk to exude, as is well shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe dark color of the lamellæ in _L. corrugis_ is due to the number of\r\nbrown cystidia or setæ, in the hymenium, which project above the surface\r\nof the gills, and they are especially abundant on the edge of the gills.\r\nThese setæ are long fusoid, 80--120 × 10--12 µ. The variations in the\r\ncolor of the gills, in some plants the gills being much darker than in\r\nothers, is due to the variations either in the number of these setæ or\r\nto the variation in their color. Where the cystidia are fewer in number\r\nor are lighter in color the lamellæ are lighter colored. Typical forms\r\nof _Lactarius volemus_ have similar setæ, but they are very pale in\r\ncolor and not so abundant over the surface of the gills. In the darker\r\nforms of _L. volemus_ the setæ are more abundant and darker in color,\r\napproaching those found in _L. corrugis_. These facts, supported by the\r\nvariation in the color of the pileus in the two species and the\r\nvariations in the rugosities of the pileus, seem to indicate that the\r\ntwo species are very closely related.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 119.--Lactarius lignyotus. Cap and stem sooty, cap\r\nwrinkled, gills white, then tinged with ochre (natural size, sometimes\r\nlarger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lactarius lignyotus= Fr.--This is known as the sooty lactarius and\r\noccurs in woods along with the smoky lactarius. It is distinguished from\r\nthe latter by the dark brown color of the pileus and by the presence\r\nusually of rugose wrinkles over the center of the cap. In size it agrees\r\nwith the smoky lactarius.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then plane, or somewhat depressed in the center,\r\ndry, sometimes with a small umbo, dark brown or sooty (chocolate to seal\r\nbrown as given in Ridgeway's nomenclature of colors), covered with a\r\nvery fine tomentum which has the appearance of a bloom. The margin of\r\nthe cap, especially in old plants, is somewhat wavy or plicate as in\r\n_Lactarius fuliginosus_. The =gills= are moderately crowded when young,\r\nbecoming distant in older plants, white, then cream color or yellow,\r\nchanging to reddish or salmon color where bruised. The =spores= are\r\nyellowish in mass, faintly so under the microscope, globose, strongly\r\nechinulate, 6--10 µ. The taste is mild, or sometimes slowly and slightly\r\nacrid. The plants from North Carolina showed distinctly the change to\r\nreddish or salmon color when the gills were bruised, and the taste was\r\nnoted as mild.\r\n\r\nFigure 119 is from plants (No. 3864, C. U. herbarium) collected in the\r\nBlue Ridge Mountains, at Blowing Rock, N. C., September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Lactarius fuliginosus= Fr.--The smoky or dingy lactarius occurs in\r\nwoods and open grassy places. It is widely distributed. The plants are\r\n4--7 cm. high, the cap 3--5 cm. broad, and the stem 6--10 mm. in\r\nthickness. The light smoky color of the cap and stem, the dull yellowish\r\nwhite color of the gills, and in old plants the wavy margin of the cap\r\nmake it comparatively easy to recognize the species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 120.--Lactarius fuliginosus. Cap and stem smoky,\r\ncap usually not wrinkled; gills white, then light ochre, distant\r\n(natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is thin, at first firm, becoming soft, convex, then plane\r\nand often somewhat depressed in the center, usually even, dry, the\r\nmargin in old plants crenately wavy, dull gray or smoky gray in color,\r\nwith a fine down or tomentum. The =gills= are adnate, distant, more so\r\nin old plants, white, then yellowish, sometimes changing to salmon color\r\nor reddish where bruised. The =spores= are yellowish in mass, faintly\r\nyellow under the microscope, strongly echinulate or tuberculate,\r\nglobose, 6--10 µ. The =stem= is usually paler than the pileus, firm,\r\nstuffed. The milk is white, slowly acrid to the taste.\r\n\r\nFigure 120 is from plants (No. 3867, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Lactarius gerardii= Pk.--This plant was described by Dr. Peck in the\r\n26th Report, N. Y. State Mus., p. 65, and in the 28th Rept. p. 129.\r\nAccording to the descriptions it differs from _Lactarius fuliginosus_\r\nonly in the spores being white, the gills more distant, and the taste\r\nbeing constantly mild. Since the taste in _L. fuliginosus_ is sometimes\r\nmild, or slowly acrid, and the lamellæ in the older plants are more\r\ndistant, the spores sometimes only tinged with yellow, there does not\r\nseem to be a very marked difference between the two species. In fact all\r\nthree of these species, _fuliginosus_, _lignyotus_ and _gerardii_, seem\r\nto be very closely related. Forms of _fuliginosus_ approach _lignyotus_\r\nin color, and the =pileus= sometimes is rugose wrinkled, while in\r\n_lignyotus_ pale forms occur, and the pileus is not always rugose\r\nwrinkled. The color of the bruised lamellæ is the same in the two last\r\nspecies and sometimes the change in color is not marked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 121.--Lactarius torminosus. Cap ochraceous and\r\npink hues, with zones of darker color, margin of cap wooly (natural\r\nsize, often much larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lactarius torminosus= (Schaeff.) Fr.--This plant is widely distributed\r\nin Europe, Asia, as well as in America. It is easily recognised by the\r\nuneven mixture of pink and ochraceous colors, and the very hairy or\r\ntomentose margin of the cap. The plants are 5--10 cm. high, the cap\r\nabout the same breadth, and the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness. It occurs in\r\nwoods on the ground during late summer and autumn.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, depressed in the center, and the margin strongly\r\nincurved when young, the abundant hairs on the margin forming an\r\napparent veil at this time which covers up the gills. The upper surface\r\nof the pileus is smooth, or sometimes more or less covered with a\r\ntomentum similar to that on the margin. The color is an admixture of\r\nochraceous and pink hues, sometimes with concentric zones of darker\r\nshades. The =gills= are crowded, narrow, whitish, with a tinge of\r\nyellowish flesh color. The =stem= is cylindrical, even, hollow, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe milk is white, unchangeable, acrid to the taste. Figure 121, left\r\nhand plants, is from plants (No. 3911, C. U. herbarium) collected in the\r\nBlue Ridge Mountains, N. C., in September, 1899, and the right hand\r\nplant (No. 2960, C. U. herbarium) collected at Ithaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 122.--Lactarius piperatus. Entirely white, milk\r\nvery peppery (natural size, often larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lactarius piperatus= (Scop.) Fr.--This species is very hot and peppery\r\nto the taste, is of medium size, entirely white, depressed at the\r\ncenter, or funnel-shaped, with a short stem, and very narrow and crowded\r\ngills, and abundant white milk. The plants are 3--7 cm. high, the cap\r\n8--12 cm. broad, and the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness. It grows in woods\r\non the ground and is quite common, sometimes very common in late summer\r\nand autumn.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, thick, firm, convex, umbilicate, and then\r\ndepressed in the center, becoming finally more or less funnel-shaped by\r\nthe elevation of the margin. It is white, smooth when young, in age\r\nsometimes becoming sordid and somewhat roughened. The =gills= are\r\nwhite, very narrow, very much crowded, and some of them forked, arcuate\r\nand then ascending because of the funnel-shaped pileus. The =spores= are\r\n_smooth_, oval, with a small point, 5--7 × 4--5 µ. The =stem= is equal\r\nor tapering below, short, solid.\r\n\r\nThe milk is white, unchangeable, very acrid to the taste and abundant.\r\nThe plant is reported as edible. A closely related species is _L.\r\npergamenus_ (Swartz) Fr., which resembles it very closely, but has a\r\nlonger, stuffed stem, and thinner, more pliant pileus, which is more\r\nfrequently irregular and eccentric, and not at first umbilicate. Figure\r\n122 is from plants (No. 3887, C. U. herbarium) collected at Blowing\r\nRock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 123.--Lactarius resimus. Entire plant white, in\r\nage scales on cap dull ochraceous (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lactarius resimus= Fr.?--This plant is very common in the woods\r\nbordering a sphagnum moor at Malloryville, N. Y., ten miles from Ithaca,\r\nduring July to September. I have found it at this place every summer for\r\nthe past three years. It occurs also in the woods of the damp ravines in\r\nthe vicinity of Ithaca. It was also abundant in the Blue Ridge\r\nMountains of North Carolina, during September, 1899. The plants are\r\nlarge, the caps 10--15 cm. broad, the stem 5--8 cm. long, and 2--3 cm.\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, umbilicate, then depressed and more or less\r\nfunnel-shaped in age, white, in the center roughened with fibrous scales\r\nas the plant ages, the scales becoming quite stout in old plants. The\r\nscales are tinged with dull ochraceous or are light brownish in the\r\nolder plants. The ochre colored scales are sometimes evident over the\r\nentire cap, even in young plants. In young plants the margin is strongly\r\ninvolute or inrolled, and a loose but thick veil of interwoven threads\r\nextends from the surface of the roll to the stem. This disappears as the\r\nmargin of the cap unrolls with the expanding pileus. The margin of the\r\npileus is often sterile, that is, it extends beyond the ends of the\r\ngills. The =gills= are white, stout, and broad, decurrent, some of them\r\nforked near the stem. When bruised, the gills after several hours become\r\nochraceous brown. The spores are subglobose, minutely spiny, 8--12 µ.\r\nThe =stem= is solid, cylindrical, minutely tomentose, spongy within when\r\nold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 124.--Lactarius resimus. Section of young plant\r\nshowing inrolled margin of cap, and the veil (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe taste is very acrid, and the white milk not changing to yellow.\r\nWhile the milk does not change to yellow, broken portions of the plant\r\nslowly change to flesh color, then ochraceous brown. Figures 123, 124\r\nare from plants collected in one of the damp gorges near Ithaca, during\r\nSeptember, 1896. The forked gills, the strongly inrolled margin of the\r\ncap and veil of the young plants are well shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\n=Lactarius chrysorrheus= Fr.--This is a common and widely distributed\r\nspecies, from small to medium size. The plants are 5--8 cm. high, the\r\ncap 5--10 cm. broad, and the stem 1--1.5 cm. in thickness. It grows in\r\nwoods and groves during late summer and autumn.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, of medium thickness, convex and depressed in the\r\ncenter from the young condition, and as the pileus expands the margin\r\nbecomes more and more upturned and the depression deeper, so that\r\neventually it is more or less broadly funnel-form. The color varies from\r\nwhite to flesh color, tinged with yellow sometimes in spots, and marked\r\nusually with faint zones of brighter yellow. The zones are sometimes\r\nvery indistinct or entirely wanting. The =gills= are crowded, white then\r\nyellow, where bruised becoming yellowish, then dull reddish. The =stem=\r\nis equal or tapering below, hollow or stuffed, paler than the pileus,\r\nsmooth (sometimes pitted as shown in the Fig. 125).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 125.--Lactarius chrysorrheus. Cap white or flesh\r\ncolor, often tinged with yellowish, and with darker zones (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe plant is acrid to the taste, the milk white changing to citron\r\nyellow on exposure. Figure 125 is from plants (No. 3875, C. U.\r\nherbarium) collected in the Blue Ridge Mountains at Blowing Rock, N. C.,\r\nSeptember, 1899. The species was quite abundant in this locality during\r\nAugust and September, in chestnut groves, mixed woods, and borders of\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n=Lactarius deliciosus= (L.) Fr. =Edible.=--_Lactarius deliciosus_ grows\r\nin damp woods, is widely distributed and sometimes is quite common. It\r\noccurs from July to October. It is one of the medium or large sized\r\nspecies, being 3--10 cm. high, the cap 5--12 cm. broad, and the stem\r\n1--2 cm. in thickness. It is easily recognized by its orange color and\r\nthe concentric zones of light and dark orange around on the pileus, and\r\nby the orange milk which is exuded where wounded.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is first convex, then slightly depressed in the center,\r\nbecoming more expanded, and finally more or less funnel-shaped by the\r\nelevation of the margin. It is usually more or less orange in color or\r\nmottled with varying shades, and with concentric bands of a deeper\r\ncolor. The =gills= are yellowish orange often with darker spots. The\r\n=stem= is of the same color as the pileus but paler, sometimes with\r\ndarker spots. The flesh of the plant is white, shaded with orange. In\r\nold plants the color fades out somewhat and becomes unevenly tinged with\r\ngreen, and bruised places become green. Peck states that when fresh the\r\nplant often has a slight acrid taste.\r\n\r\nBeing a widely distributed and not uncommon plant, and one so readily\r\nrecognized, it has long been known in the old world as well as here. All\r\nwriters on these subjects concur in recommending it for food, some\r\npronouncing it excellent, some the most delicious known. Its name\r\nsuggests the estimation in which it was held when christened.\r\n\r\n=Lactarius chelidonium= Pk. =Edible.=--This pretty little _Lactarius_\r\nwas described by Peck in the 24th Report, N. Y. State Mus., p. 74. It is\r\nclosely allied to _Lactarius deliciosus_, from which it is said to\r\ndiffer in its \"more narrow lamellæ, differently colored milk, smaller\r\nspores.\" The plant is about 5 cm. high, the cap about 5 cm. broad, and\r\nthe stem 1--1.5 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, firm, convex and depressed in the center,\r\nsmooth, slightly viscid when moist, \"of a grayish green color with blue\r\nand yellow tints, and a few narrow zones on the margin.\" The =gills= are\r\ncrowded, narrow, some of them forked at the base, and sometimes joining\r\nto form reticulations. The =spores= are yellowish. The short =stem= is\r\nnearly equal, smooth, hollow, and the same color as the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe taste is mild, the milk not abundant, and of a yellowish color,\r\n\"resembling the juice of Celandine or the liquid secreted from the mouth\r\nof grasshoppers.\" Wounds on the plant are first of the color of the\r\nmilk, changing on exposure to blue, and finally to green. The plant\r\noccurs during late summer and in the autumn in woods. Peck reported it\r\nfirst from Saratoga, N. Y. It has been found elsewhere in the State, and\r\nit has probably quite a wide distribution. I found it during September,\r\n1899, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of N. C. Figure 1, plate 39, is from\r\nsome of the water color drawings made by Mr. Franklin R. Rathbun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 39.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.--Lactarius deliciosus.\r\n  FIG. 2.--L. chelidonium.\r\n  FIG. 3.--L. indigo.\r\n  Copyright 1900.]\r\n\r\n=Lactarius indigo= (Schw.) Fr.--The indigo blue lactarius is a very\r\nstriking and easily recognized plant because of the rich indigo blue\r\ncolor so predominant in the entire plant. It is not very abundant, but\r\nis widely distributed in North America. The plant is 5--7 cm. high, the\r\ncap 5--12 cm. broad, and the stem is 1--2 cm. in thickness. The plants\r\noccur during late summer and in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= when young is umbilicate, the margin involute, and in age\r\nthe margin becomes elevated and then the pileus is more or less\r\nfunnel-shaped. The indigo blue color is deeply seated, and the surface\r\nof the pileus has a silvery gray appearance through which the indigo\r\nblue color is seen. The surface is marked by concentric zones of a\r\ndarker shade. In age the color is apt to be less uniformly distributed,\r\nit is paler, and the zones are fainter. The _gills_ are crowded, and\r\nwhen bruised, or in age, the indigo blue color changes somewhat to\r\ngreenish. The milk is dark blue.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSULA Pers.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Russula_ are very characteristic, and the genus is\r\neasily recognized in most cases after a little experience. In the very\r\nbrittle texture of the plants the genus resembles _Lactarius_, and many\r\nof them are more brittle than the species of this genus. A section of\r\nthe pileus shows under the microscope a similar vesicular condition,\r\nthat is the grouping of large rounded cells together, with threads\r\nbetween. But the species of _Russula_ are at once separated from those\r\nof _Lactarius_ by the absence of a juice which exudes in drops from\r\nbruised parts of _Lactarius_. While some of the species are white and\r\nothers have dull or sombre colors, many of the species of _Russula_ have\r\nbright, or even brilliant colors, as red, purple, violet, pink, blue,\r\nyellow, green. In determining many of the species, however, it is\r\nnecessary to know the taste, whether mild, bitter, acrid, etc., and in\r\nthis respect the genus again resembles _Lactarius_. The color of the\r\ngills as well as the color of the spores in mass should also be\r\ndetermined. The genus is quite a large one, and the American species are\r\nnot well known, the genus being a difficult one. In Jour. Mycolog., =5=:\r\n58--64, 1889, the characters of the tribes of Russula with descriptions\r\nof 25 species are quoted from Stevenson, with notes on their\r\ndistribution in N. A. by MacAdam.\r\n\r\n=Russula alutacea= Fr. =Edible.=--This handsome _Russula_ differs from\r\nthe others described here in the color of the gills and spores. The\r\nplant is common and occurs in mixed woods during the summer and early\r\nautumn. It is 5--10 cm. high, the cap 5--12 cm. broad, and the stem\r\n1.5--2.5 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, oval to bell-shaped, becoming plane, and\r\nsometimes umbilicate. It is red or blood red in color, sometimes purple,\r\nand becoming pale in age, especially at the center. It is viscid when\r\nmoist, the margin thin and striate-tuberculate. The =gills= are free\r\nfrom the stem, stout, broad, first white, becoming yellow, and in age\r\nochraceous. The gills are all of the same length, not crowded, and they\r\nare connected by vein-like elevations over the surface. The =stem= is\r\nstout, solid, even, white, portions of the stem are red, sometimes\r\npurple.\r\n\r\nThe taste is mild, and the plant is regarded as one of the very good\r\nones for food.\r\n\r\n=Russula lepida= Fr. =Edible.=--This elegant _Russula_ occurs in birch\r\nwoods or in mixed woods during late summer and autumn. It is 5--8 cm.\r\nhigh, the cap 6--8 cm. broad, and the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, convex, then expanded, obtuse, not shining, deep\r\nred, becoming pale in age, often whitish at the center, silky, in age\r\nthe surface cracking, the margin blunt and not striate. The =gills= are\r\nrounded next the stem, thick, rather crowded, and sometimes forked,\r\nwhite, sometimes red on the edge near the margin of the pileus. The\r\ngills are often connected by vein-like elevations over the surface. The\r\n=stem= is equal, white or rose color. The taste is mild.\r\n\r\n=Russula virescens= (Schaeff.) Fr. =Edible.=--This plant grows on the\r\nground in woods or in grassy places in groves from July to September.\r\nThe stem is short, 2--7 cm. long × 1--2 cm. thick, and the cap is 5--10\r\ncm. broad. The plant is well known by the green color of the pileus and\r\nby the surface of the pileus being separated into numerous, quite\r\nregular, somewhat angular areas or patches, where the green color is\r\nmore pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is first rounded, then convex and expanded, and when old\r\nsomewhat depressed in the center. It is quite firm, dry, greenish, and\r\nthe surface with numerous angular floccose areas or patches of usually a\r\ndeeper green. Sometimes the pileus is said to be tinged with yellow. The\r\n=gills= are adnate, nearly free from the stem, and crowded. The =stem=\r\nis white and firm.\r\n\r\nThe greenish Russula, _Russula virescens_, like a number of other\r\nplants, has long been recommended for food, both in Europe and in this\r\ncountry. There are several species of _Russula_ in which the pileus is\r\ngreen, but this species is readily distinguished from them by the\r\ngreenish floccose patches on the surface of the pileus. =Russula\r\nfurcata= is a common species in similar situations, with forked gills,\r\nand the cap very variable in color, sometimes reddish, purple, purple\r\nbrown, or in one form green. I know of the _Russula furcata_ having been\r\neaten in rather small quantities, and while in this case no harm\r\nresulted the taste was not agreeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 40.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.--Russula virescens.\r\n  FIG. 2.--R. alutacea.\r\n  FIG. 3.--R. lepida.\r\n  FIG. 4.--R. emetica.\r\n  FIG. 5.--Yellow Russula.\r\n  FIG. 6.--R. adusta.\r\n  Copyright 1900.]\r\n\r\n=Russula fragilis= (Pers.) Fr.--This plant is very common in damp woods,\r\nor during wet weather from July to September. It is a small plant and\r\nvery fragile, as its name suggests, much more so than most other\r\nspecies. It is 2--4 cm. high, the cap 2--5 cm. broad, and the stem about\r\n1 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, sometimes slightly umbonate, then plane, and in\r\nage somewhat depressed. The cuticle peels off very easily. The color is\r\noften a bright red, or pink, sometimes purple or violet, and becomes\r\npaler in age. It is somewhat viscid when moist, and the margin is very\r\nthin and strongly striate and tuberculate, i. e., the ridges between the\r\nmarginal furrows are tuberculate. The =gills= are lightly adnexed, thin,\r\ncrowded, broad, all of the same length, white. The =stem= is usually\r\nwhite, sometimes more or less pink colored, spongy within, becoming\r\nhollow. The taste is very acrid.\r\n\r\n=Russula emetica= Fr. =Poisonous.=--This _Russula_ has a very wide\r\ndistribution and occurs on the ground in woods or open places during\r\nsummer and autumn. It is a beautiful species and very fragile. The\r\nplants are 5--10 cm. high, the cap 5--10 cm. broad, and the stem 1--2\r\ncm. in thickness. The =pileus= is oval to bell-shaped when young,\r\nbecoming plane, and in age depressed. It is smooth, shining, the margin\r\nfurrowed and tuberculate. The color is from pink or rosy when young to\r\ndark red when older, and fading to tawny or sometimes yellowish in age.\r\nThe cuticle is easily separable as in _R. fragilis_, the flesh white,\r\nbut reddish just beneath the cuticle. The =gills= are nearly free,\r\nbroad, not crowded, white. The stem is stout, spongy within, white or\r\nreddish, fragile when old.\r\n\r\nThe plant is very acrid to the taste and is said to be poisonous, and to\r\nact as an emetic.\r\n\r\n=Russula adusta= (Pers.) Fr.--This plant occurs on the ground in woods\r\nduring late summer and in autumn. It is 3--6 cm. high, the cap 5--15 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem is 1--1.5 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, firm, convex, depressed at the center, and when\r\nold more or less funnel-shaped from the upturning of the margin, which\r\nis at first incurved and smooth. It varies from white to gray and smoky\r\ncolor. The =gills= are adnate, or decurrent, thin, crowded, of unequal\r\nlengths, white, then becoming dark. The =stem= is colored like the\r\npileus. The entire plant becomes darker in drying, sometimes almost\r\nblack. It is near _Russula nigricans_, but is smaller, and does not have\r\na red juice as _R. nigricans_ has.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTHARELLUS Adanson.\r\n\r\nFrom the other white-spored agarics of a fleshy consistency\r\n_Cantharellus_ is distinguished by the form of the gills. The gills are\r\ngenerally forked, once or several times, in a dichotomous manner, though\r\nsometimes irregularly. They are blunt on the edge, not acute as in most\r\nof the other genera. The gills are usually narrow and in many species\r\nlook like veins, folds, or wrinkles, but in some species, as in\r\n_Cantharellus aurantiacus_, they are rather thin and broad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 126.--Cantharellus cibarius. Under view showing\r\nforked gills with veins connecting them. Entire plant rich chrome yellow\r\n(natural size).]\r\n\r\n=Cantharellus cibarius= Fr. =Edible.=--This plant is known as the\r\n_chanterelle_. It has a very wide distribution and has long been\r\nregarded as one of the best of the edible mushrooms. Many of the writers\r\non fungi speak of it in terms of high praise. The entire plant is a\r\nuniform rich chrome yellow. Sometimes it is symmetrical in form, but\r\nusually it is more or less irregular and unsymmetrical in form. The\r\nplants are 5--10 cm. high, the cap 4--8 cm. broad, and the stem short\r\nand rather thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 41, FIGURE 127.--Cantharellus aurantiacus. Color\r\norange yellow, and cap varies ochre, raw sienna, tawny, in different\r\nspecimens (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, rather thick, the margin thick and blunt and at\r\nfirst inrolled. It is convex, becoming expanded or sometimes depressed\r\nby the margin of the cap becoming elevated. The margin is often wavy or\r\nrepand, and in irregular forms it is only produced at one side, or more\r\nat one side than at the other, or the cap is irregularly lobed. The\r\n=gills= are very narrow, stout, distant, more or less sinuous, forked or\r\nanastomosing irregularly, and because of the pileus being something like\r\nan inverted cone the gills appear to run down on the stem. The =spores=\r\nare faintly yellowish, elliptical, 7--10 µ. Figure 126 represents but a\r\nsingle specimen, and this one with a nearly lateral pileus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 128.--Cantharellus aurantiacus, under view,\r\nenlarged nearly twice, showing regularly forked gills.]\r\n\r\n=Cantharellus aurantiacus= Fr.--This orange cantharellus is very common,\r\nand occurs on the ground or on very rotten wood, logs, branches, etc.,\r\nfrom summer to very late autumn. It is widely distributed in Europe and\r\nAmerica. It is easily known by its dull orange or brownish pileus,\r\nyellow gills, which are thin and regularly forked, and by the pileus\r\nbeing more or less depressed or funnel-shaped. The plants are from 5--8\r\ncm. high, the cap from 2--7 cm. broad, and the stem about 4--8 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, soft, flexible, convex, to expanded, or obconic,\r\nplane or depressed, or funnel-shaped, the margin strongly inrolled when\r\nyoung, in age simply incurved, the margin plane or repand and undulate.\r\nThe color varies from ochre yellow to dull orange, or orange ochraceous,\r\nraw sienna, and tawny, in different specimens. It is often brownish at\r\nthe center. The surface of the pileus is minutely tomentose with silky\r\nhairs, especially toward the center, and sometimes smooth toward the\r\nmargin. The flesh is 3--5 mm. at the center, and thin toward the margin.\r\nThe gills are arcuate, decurrent, thin, the edge blunt, but not so much\r\nso as in a number of other species, crowded, regularly forked several\r\ntimes, at length ascending when the pileus is elevated at the margin.\r\nThe color of the =gills= is orange to cadmium orange, or sometimes\r\npaler, cadmium yellow or deep chrome. The =stem= is clay color to ochre\r\nyellow, enlarged below, spongy, stuffed, fistulose, soft, fibrous, more\r\nor less ascending at the base.\r\n\r\nThe taste is somewhat nutty, sometimes bitterish. The plants in Fig. 127\r\n(No. 3272, C. U. herbarium) were collected near Ithaca, October 7, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARASMIUS Fr.\r\n\r\nIn this genus the plants are tough and fleshy or membranaceous, leathery\r\nand dry. They do not easily decay, but shrivel up in dry weather, and\r\nrevive in wet weather, or when placed in water. This is an important\r\ncharacter in distinguishing the genus. It is closely related to\r\n_Collybia_, from which it is difficult to separate certain species. On\r\nthe other hand, it is closely related to _Lentinus_ and _Panus_, both of\r\nwhich are tough and pliant. In _Marasmius_, however, the substance of\r\nthe pileus is separate from that of the stem, while in _Lentinus_ and\r\n_Panus_ it is continuous, a character rather difficult for the beginner\r\nto understand. The species of _Marasmius_, however, are generally much\r\nsmaller than those of _Lentinus_ and _Panus_, especially those which\r\ngrow on wood. The stem in _Marasmius_ is in nearly all species central,\r\nwhile in _Lentinus_ and _Panus_ it is generally more or less eccentric.\r\nMany of the species of the genus _Marasmius_ have an odor of garlic when\r\nfresh. Besides the fairy ring (_M. oreades_) which grows on the ground,\r\n_M. rotula_ is a very common species on wood and leaves. It has a\r\nslender, black, shining stem, and a brownish pileus usually with a black\r\nspot in the depression in the center. The species are very numerous.\r\nPeck, 23rd Report, N. Y. State Mus., p. 124--126, describes 8 species.\r\nMorgan Jour. Cinn. Soc. Nat. Hist. =6=: 189--194, describes 17 species.\r\n\r\n=Marasmius oreades= Fr. =Edible.=--This is the well known \"fairy ring\"\r\nmushroom. It grows during the summer and autumn in grassy places, as in\r\nlawns, by roadsides, in pastures, etc. It appears most abundantly during\r\nwet weather or following heavy rains. It is found usually in circles, or\r\nin the arc of a circle, though few scattered plants not arranged in this\r\nway often occur. The plants are 7--10 cm. high, the cap 2--4 cm. broad,\r\nand the stem 3--4 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 129.--Marasmius oreades. Caps buff, tawny, or\r\nreddish.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, sometimes the center elevated,\r\nfleshy, rather thin, tough, smooth, buff color, or tawny or reddish, in\r\nage, or in drying, paler. When moist the pileus may be striate on the\r\nmargin. The =gills= are broad, free or adnexed, rounded near the stem,\r\nwhite or dull yellowish. The =spores= are elliptical, 7--8 µ long. The\r\n=stem= is tough, solid, whitish.\r\n\r\nThis widely distributed fungus is much prized everywhere by those who\r\nknow it. It is not the only fungus which appears in rings, so that this\r\nhabit is not peculiar to this plant. Several different kinds are known\r\nto appear in rings at times. The appearance of the fungus in rings is\r\ndue to the mode of growth of the mycelium or spawn in the soil.\r\n\r\nHaving started at a given spot the mycelium consumes the food material\r\nin the soil suitable for it, and the plants for the first year appear in\r\na group. In the center of this spot the mycelium, having consumed all\r\nthe available food, probably dies after producing the crop of\r\nmushrooms. But around the edge of the spot the mycelium or spawn still\r\nexists, and at the beginning of the next season it starts into growth\r\nand feeds on the available food in a zone surrounding the spot where it\r\ngrew the previous year. This second year, then, the plants appear in a\r\nsmall ring. So in succeeding years it advances outward, the ring each\r\nyear becoming larger. Where the plants appear only in the arc of a\r\ncircle, something has happened to check or destroy the mycelium in the\r\nremaining arc of the circle.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted by several observers that the grass in the ring\r\noccupied by the mushrooms is often greener than that adjoining. This is\r\nperhaps due to some stimulus exerted by the mycelium of the fungus on\r\nthe grass, or possibly the mycelium may in some way make certain foods\r\navailable for the grass which gives an additional supply to it at this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nFig. 129 is from plants (No. 5503, C. U. herbarium) collected in a lawn,\r\nOctober 25, 1900, Ithaca.\r\n\r\nIllustrations of some fine large rings formed by this fungus appeared in\r\ncircular No. 13 by Mr. Coville, of the Division of Botany in the U. S.\r\nDept. Agr.\r\n\r\n=Marasmius cohærens= (Fr.) Bres. (_Mycena cohærens_ Fr. _Collybia\r\nlachnophylla_ Berk. _Collybia spinulifera_ Pk.)--This plant grows in\r\ndense clusters, ten to twenty individuals with their stems closely\r\njoined below and fastened together by the abundant growth of threads\r\nfrom the lower ends. From this character the name _cohærens_ was\r\nderived. The plants grow on the ground or on very rotten wood in woods\r\nduring late spring and in the summer. The plant is not very common in\r\nthis country, but appears to be widely distributed both in Europe and\r\nhere, having been collected in Carolina, Ohio, Vermont, New York, etc.\r\nThe plants are 12--20 cm. high, the cap 2--2.5 cm. broad, and the stem\r\n4--7 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, tough, convex or bell-shaped, then expanded,\r\nsometimes umbonate, or in age sometimes the margin upturned and more or\r\nless wavy, not viscid, but finely striate when damp, thin. The color\r\nvaries from vinaceous cinnamon to chestnut or light leather color, or\r\ntawny, paler in age, and sometimes darker on the center. The =gills= are\r\nsometimes more or less crowded, narrow, 5--6 mm. broad, adnate, but\r\nnotched, and sometimes becoming free from the stem. The color is light\r\nleather color, brick red or bay, the color and color variations being\r\ndue to numbers of colored cystidia or spicules scattered over the\r\nsurface of the gills and on the edge. The =cystidia= are fulvous,\r\nfusoid, 75--90 µ long. The =spores= are oval, white, small, 6 × 3 µ. The\r\n=stem= is long and slender, nearly cylindrical, tapering somewhat\r\nabove, slightly enlarged below, and rooting. The color is the same as\r\nthat of the pileus or dark bay brown, and shining, and seems to be due\r\nto large numbers of spicules similar to those on the gills. The color is\r\npaler below in some cases, or gradually darker below in others. The\r\nstems are bound together below by numerous threads.\r\n\r\nFigure 130 is from plants (No. 2373, C. U. herbarium) collected in woods\r\nnear Freeville, N. Y. The plants have been collected near Ithaca on\r\nthree different occasions, twice near Freeville about nine miles from\r\nIthaca, and once in the woods at Ithaca. It is easily distinguished by\r\nits color and the presence of the peculiar setæ or cystidia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 130.--Marasmius cohaerens (Fr.) Bres.

Color\r\nchestnut, light leather color, tawny or vinaceous cinnamon, darker in\r\ncenter, stems dark, shining, gills leather color, or fulvous, or wine\r\ncolor, brick red or bay, varying in different specimens (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the plant has been collected on several different occasions in\r\nAmerica, it does not seem to have been recognized under this name until\r\nrecently, save the record of it from Carolina by de Schweinitz (Synop.\r\nfung. Car. No. 606. p. 81).\r\n\r\n\r\nLENTINUS Fr.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this genus are tough and pliant, becoming hard when old,\r\nunless very watery, and when dry. The genus differs from the other tough\r\nand pliant ones by the peculiarity of the gills, the gills being notched\r\nor serrate on the edges. Sometimes this appearance is intensified by the\r\ncracking of the gills in age or in drying. The nearest ally of the genus\r\nis _Panus_, which is only separated from _Lentinus_ by the edge of the\r\ngills being plane. This does not seem a very good character on which to\r\nseparate the species of the two genera, since it is often difficult to\r\ntell whether the gills are naturally serrate or whether they have become\r\nso by certain tensions which exist on the lamellæ during the expansion\r\nand drying of the pileus. Schroeter unites _Panus_ with _Lentinus_\r\n(Cohn's Krypt. Flora, Schlesien, =3=, 1; 554, 1889). The plants are\r\nusually very irregular and many of them shelving, only a few grow\r\nupright and have regular caps.\r\n\r\n=Lentinus vulpinus= Fr.--This is a large and handsome species, having a\r\nwide distribution in Europe and in this country, but it does not seem to\r\nbe common. It grows on trunks, logs, stumps, etc., in the woods. It was\r\nquite abundant during late summer and in the autumn on fallen logs, in a\r\nwoods near Ithaca. The =caps= are shelving, closely overlapping in\r\nshingled fashion (imbricated), and joined at the narrowed base. The\r\nsurface is convex, and the margin is strongly incurved, so that each of\r\nthe individual caps is shell-shaped (conchate). The surface of the\r\npileus is coarsely hairy or hispid, the surface becoming more rough with\r\nage. Many coarse hairs unite to form coarse tufts which are stouter and\r\nnearly erect toward the base of the cap, and give the surface a\r\ntuberculate appearance. Toward the margin of the cap these coarse hairs\r\nare arranged in nearly parallel lines, making rows or ridges, which are\r\nvery rough. The hairs and tubercles are dark in color, being nearly\r\nblack toward the base, especially in old plants, and sometimes pale or\r\nof a smoky hue, especially in young plants. The pileus is flesh color\r\nwhen young, becoming darker when old, and the flesh is quite thin,\r\nwhitish toward the gills and darker toward the surface. The =gills= are\r\nbroad, nearly white, flesh color near the base, coarsely serrate,\r\nbecoming cracked in age and in drying, narrowed toward the base of the\r\npileus, not forked, crowded, 4--6 mm. broad. The cap and gills are tough\r\neven when fresh. The plant has an intensely pungent taste.\r\n\r\nFigures 131, 132 represent an upper, front, and under view of the pilei\r\n(No. 3315, C. U. herbarium).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 42, FIGURE 131.--Lentinus vulpinus. The coarse,\r\nhairy scales are black in old plants, paler, of a smoky hue, in younger\r\nones (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lentinus lecomtei= Fr., is a very common and widely distributed species\r\ngrowing on wood. When it grows on the upper side of logs the pileus is\r\nsometimes regular and funnel-shaped (cyathiform), but it is often\r\nirregular and produced on one side, especially if it grows on the side\r\nof the substratum. In most cases, however, there is a funnel-shaped\r\ndepression above the attachment of the stem. The =pileus= is tough,\r\nreddish or reddish brown or leather color, hairy or sometimes strigose,\r\nthe margin incurved. The =stem= is usually short, hairy, or in age it\r\nmay become more or less smooth. The =gills= are narrow, crowded, the\r\nspores small, ovate to elliptical 5--6 × 2--3 µ. According to Bresadola\r\nthis is the same as _Panus rudis_ Fr. It resembles very closely also\r\n_Panus cyathiformis_ (Schaeff.) Fr., and _P. strigosus_ B. & C.\r\n\r\n=Lentinus lepideus= Fr., [_L. squamosus_ (Schaeff.) Schroet.] is another\r\ncommon and widely distributed species. It is much larger than _L.\r\nlecomtei_, whitish with coarse brown scales on the cap. It is 12--20 cm.\r\nhigh, and the cap is often as broad. The stem is 2--8 cm. long and 1--2\r\ncm. in thickness. It grows on wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 132.--Lentinus vulpinus, front and under view\r\n(natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Lentinus stipticus= (Bull.) Schroet. (_Panus stipticus_ Bull.) is a\r\nvery small species compared with the three named above. It is, however,\r\na very common and widely distributed one, growing on wood, and may be\r\nfound the year around. The pileus is 1--3 cm. in diameter, whitish or\r\ngrayish, very tough, expanded in wet weather, and curled up in dry\r\nweather. The stem is very short, and attached to one side of the cap.\r\nWhen freshly developed the plant is phosphorescent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHIZOPHYLLUM Fr.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting genus, but the species are very few. The\r\nplants are tough, pliant when fresh, and dry. The gills are very\r\ncharacteristic, being split along the edge and generally strongly\r\nrevolute, that is, the split edges curve around against the side of the\r\ngill. This character can be seen sometimes with the aid of a hand lens,\r\nbut is very evident when a section of the cap and gills is made and then\r\nexamined with a microscope. The spores are white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 133.--Schizophyllum alneum (==S. commune). View of\r\nunder side (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Schizophyllum alneum= (L.) Schroet.--This species usually goes by the\r\nname of _Schizophyllum commune_, but the earlier name is _S. alneum_. It\r\nis a very common plant and is world wide in its distribution, growing on\r\nwood, as on branches, trunks, etc. It is white, and the =pileus= is very\r\nhairy or tomentose, with coarse white hairs. It is 1--3 cm. in diameter,\r\nand the cap is sessile, either attached at one side when the cap is more\r\nproduced on one side than on the other, or it may be attached at or\r\nnear the center of the top, when the cap is more evenly developed on all\r\nsides. It is often crenate or lobed on the margin, the larger plants\r\nshowing this character more prominently. The margin is incurved. The\r\n=gills= are white, wooly, branched and extend out toward the margin of\r\nthe cap like the radiations of a fan. The gills are deeply split along\r\nthe edge, and strongly revolute. It is a very pretty plant, but one\r\nbecomes rather tired of collecting it because it is so common. It may be\r\nfound at all seasons of the year on dead sticks and branches, either in\r\nthe woods or elsewhere, if the branches are present. It is very\r\ncoriaceous, and tough. During dry weather it is much shrunken and curled\r\nup, but during rains it expands quickly and then it is seen in its\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 43, FIGURE 134.--Trogia crispa. Large cluster of\r\ncaps, view of underside (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nFigure 133 shows the plant in the expanded condition, from the under\r\nside. The plants were growing on a hickory branch, and were dry and\r\nshrunken when brought in the laboratory. The branch and the fungus were\r\nplaced in water for a few hours, when the fungus expanded, and was then\r\nphotographed in this condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROGIA Fr.\r\n\r\nThis genus is characterized, according to Fries, by the gills being\r\nchanneled along the edge, but singularly the only species attributed to\r\nthe genus in Europe and in our country has not channeled gills, but only\r\nsomewhat crisped along the edges. It is usually, therefore, a difficult\r\nmatter for a beginner to determine the plant simply from this\r\ndescription. The gills are furthermore narrow, irregular, and the plants\r\nare somewhat soft and flabby when wet, but brittle and persistent when\r\ndry, so that when moistened they revive and appear as if fresh.\r\n\r\n=Trogia crispa= Fr.--This species is the principal if not only one in\r\nEurope and America. It is widely distributed, and sometimes not very\r\nuncommon. It occurs on trunks, branches, etc., often on the birch. The\r\nplants are from 0.5--1 cm. broad, usually sessile. The upper surface is\r\nwhitish or reddish yellow toward the attachment, sometimes tan color,\r\nand when young it is sometimes covered with whitish hairs. The gills are\r\nvery narrow, vein-like, irregular, interrupted or continuous, and often\r\nmore or less branched. The gills are very much crisped, hence the name,\r\nblunt at the edge and white or bluish gray. The caps are usually much\r\ncrowded and overlapped in an imbricated fashion as shown in Fig. 134; a\r\nphotograph of a fine specimen after being moistened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ROSY-SPORED AGARICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spores are rosy, pink, salmon colored, flesh colored, or reddish.\r\nFor analytical keys to the genera see Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUTEUS Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Pluteus_ the volva and annulus are both wanting, the gills\r\nare usually free from the stem, and the stem is easily broken out from\r\nthe substance of the cap, reminding one in some cases of a ball and\r\nsocket joint. The substance of the cap is thus said to be not continuous\r\nwith that of the stem. The spores seen in mass are flesh colored as in\r\nother genera of this subdivision of the agarics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 135.--Pluteus cervinus. Cap grayish brown, or\r\nsooty, smooth or sometimes scaly, rarely white, stem same color, but\r\npaler; gills first white, then flesh color (natural size, often larger).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Pluteus cervinus= Schaeff. =Edible.=--This is one of the very common\r\nspecies of the higher fungi, and is also very widely distributed. It\r\nvaries considerably in size and appearance. It is 7--15 cm. high, the\r\ncap 5--10 cm. broad, and the stem 6--12 mm. in thickness. It occurs on\r\nthe ground from underground roots or rotten wood, or grows on decaying\r\nstumps, logs, etc., from spring until late autumn. Sometimes it is found\r\ngrowing in sawdust.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, bell-shaped, then convex, and becoming expanded,\r\nthe surface usually smooth, but showing radiating fibrils, grayish\r\nbrown, or sometimes sooty, sometimes more or less scaly. The =gills= are\r\nnot crowded, broad, free from the stem, white, then becoming flesh color\r\nwith the maturity of the spores. One very characteristic feature of the\r\nplant is the presence of =cystidia= in the hymenium on the gills. These\r\nare stout, colorless, elliptical, thick-walled, and terminate in two or\r\nthree blunt, short prongs.\r\n\r\nThe =stem= is nearly equal, solid, the color much the same as that of\r\nthe pileus, but often paler above, smooth or sometimes scaly.\r\n\r\nIn some forms the plant is entirely white, except the gills. In addition\r\nto the white forms occurring in the woods, I have found them in an old\r\nabandoned cement mine growing on wood props.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 136.--Pluteus tomentosulus. Cap and stem entirely\r\nwhite, gills flesh color, stem furrowed and tomentose (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Pluteus tomentosulus= Pk.--This plant was described by Peck in the 32d\r\nReport, N. Y. State Mus., page 28, 1879. It grows on decaying wood in\r\nthe woods during July and August. The plants are 5--12 cm. high, the cap\r\n3--7 cm. broad, and the stem 4--8 mm. in thickness. The description\r\ngiven by Peck is as follows: \"Pileus thin, convex or expanded,\r\nsubumbonate, dry, minutely squamulose-tomentose, white, sometimes\r\npinkish on the margin; lamellæ rather broad, rounded behind, free,\r\ncrowded, white then flesh colored; stem equal, solid, striate, slightly\r\npubescent or subtomentose, white; spores subglobose, 7 µ in diameter,\r\ngenerally containing a large single nucleus.\" From the plant collected\r\nat Ithaca the following notes were made. The =pileus= and stem are\r\nentirely white, the gills flesh color. The pileus is expanded, umbonate,\r\nthin except at the umbo, minutely floccose squamulose, no pinkish tinge\r\nnoted; the flesh is white, but on the umbo changing to flesh color where\r\nwounded. The =gills= are free, with a clear white space between stem and\r\nrounded edges, crowded, narrow (about 3--4 mm. broad) edge finely\r\nfimbriate, probably formed by numerous bottle-shaped cystidia on the\r\nedge, and which extend up a little distance on the side of the gills,\r\nbut are not distributed in numbers over the surface of the gills;\r\n=cystidia= thin walled, hyaline. The =spores= are flesh colored,\r\nsubglobose, 5--7 µ. =Stem= cylindrical, even, twisted somewhat, white,\r\nstriate and minutely squamulose like the pileus, but with coarser\r\nscales, especially toward the base, solid, flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe species received its name from the tomentose, striate character of\r\nthe stem. The plants (No. 3219, C.

The genus is characterized then by the rosy or\r\nreddish spores, the presence of a volva, and the annulus is wanting. The\r\nstem is easily separable from the pileus at its junction, in this\r\nrespect being similar to _Amanita_, _Amanitopsis_, _Lepiota_ and others.\r\nThe gills are usually, also, free from the stem. The species grow on\r\nrotting wood, on leaf mould and on richly manured ground, etc. They are\r\nof a very soft texture and usually soon decay.\r\n\r\n=Volvaria bombycina= (Pers.) Fr. =Edible.=--The silky volvaria is so\r\ncalled because of the beautiful silky texture of the surface of the cap.\r\nIt is not very common, but is world wide in its distribution, and\r\noccurs on decayed wood of logs, stumps, etc., during late summer and in\r\nautumn. It is usually of a beautiful white color, large, the volva large\r\nand thick, reminding one of a bag, and the stem is ascending when the\r\nplant grows on the side of the trunk, or erect when it grows on the\r\nupper side of a log or stump. The plant is from 8--16 cm. high, the cap\r\n6--20 cm. broad, and the stem 1--1.5 cm. thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is globose, then bell-shaped, and finally convex and\r\nsomewhat umbonate, white, according to some becoming somewhat reddish.\r\nThe entire surface is silky, and numerous hairs stand out in the form of\r\nsoft down, when older the surface becoming more or less scaly, or rarely\r\nbecoming smooth at the apex. The flesh is white. The =gills= are\r\ncrowded, very broad along the middle, flesh colored, the edge sometimes\r\nragged. The =spores= are rosy in mass, oval to broadly elliptical, 6--9\r\n× 5--6 µ, smooth. The =stem= tapers from the base to the apex, is solid,\r\nsmooth. The =volva= is large and bag-like. The plant is considered\r\nedible by some. Figure 137 is from a plant (No. 3096, C. U. herbarium)\r\ncollected on a log of Acer rubrum in Cascadilla woods, Ithaca, on August\r\n10th, 1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 137.--Volvaria bombycina. Cap, stem and volva\r\nentirely white, gills flesh color (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Volvaria speciosa= Fr.--This plant seems to be rare, but it has a wide\r\ndistribution in Europe and the United States. It occurs on richly\r\nmanured ground, on dung, etc. The plants are 10--20 cm. high, the cap\r\n6--12 cm. broad, and the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness. The entire plant is\r\nwhite or whitish, sometimes grayish, especially at the center, where it\r\nis also sometimes darker and of a smoky color.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is globose when young, then bell-shaped, and finally more\r\nor less expanded, and umbonate, smooth, very viscid, so that earth,\r\nleaves, etc., cling to it. The flesh is white and very soft. The =gills=\r\nare free, flesh colored to reddish or fulvous, from the deeply colored\r\nspores. The =spores= are broadly elliptical, or oval, 12--18 × 8--10 µ.\r\nThe =stem= is nearly cylindrical, or tapering evenly from the base, when\r\nyoung more or less hairy, becoming smooth. The =volva= is large, edge\r\nfree, but fitting very close, flabby and irregularly torn.\r\n\r\nThe species is reported from California by McClatchie, and from\r\nWisconsin by Bundy.\r\n\r\nSpecimens were received in June, 1898, from Dr. Post of Lansing, Mich.,\r\nwhich were collected there in a potato patch. It was abundant during May\r\nand June. Plants which were sent in a fresh condition were badly decayed\r\nby the time they reached Ithaca, and the odor was very disagreeable. It\r\nis remarkable that the odor was that of rotting potatoes! In this\r\nconnection might be mentioned Dr. Peck's observation (Bull. Torr. Bot.\r\nClub 26: p. 67, 1899) that _Agaricus maritimus_ Pk., which grows near\r\nthe seashore, possessed \"a taste and odor suggestive of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nMcClatchie reports that it is common in cultivated soil, especially\r\ngrain fields and along roads, and that it is \"a fine edible agaric and\r\nour most abundant one in California.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCLITOPILUS Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the rosy-spored agarics belonging to this genus the gills are\r\ndecurrent, that is, extend for some distance down on the stem. The stem\r\nis fleshy. The gills are white at first and become pink or salmon color\r\nas the plants mature, and the spores take on their characteristic color.\r\nThe plants should thus not be confused with any of the species of\r\n_Agaricus_ to which the common mushroom belongs, since in those species\r\nthe gills become dark brown or blackish when mature. The genus\r\ncorresponds with _Clitocybe_ among the white-spored ones.\r\n\r\n=Clitopilus prunulus= Scop. =Edible.=--This species grows on the ground\r\nin the woods from mid-summer to autumn. It is not very common, but\r\nsometimes appears in considerable quantities at one place. During the\r\nautumn of 1898 quite a large number of specimens were found in a woods\r\nnear Ithaca, growing on the ground around an old stump. The plants are\r\n3--8 cm. high, the cap 5--10 cm. broad, and stem 1--2 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 44, FIGURE 138.--Clitopilus prunulus, cap whitish\r\nor dark gray, gills flesh color (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, firm, convex and becoming nearly plane, and\r\nsometimes as the plants become old the center may be slightly\r\ndepressed. It is whitish in color, or dark gray, or with a leaden\r\ntint, dry, sometimes with a distinct bloom on the surface, and the\r\nmargin is often wavy. The cap is sometimes produced more on one side\r\nthan on the other. The =gills= are not close, at first whitish, then\r\nsalmon colored as the spores mature, and they are decurrent as is\r\ncharacteristic of the genus. The =spores= are elliptical or nearly so,\r\nand measure 10--12 µ long.\r\n\r\nFigure 138 is from plants collected near Ithaca, in the autumn of 1898.\r\nThis species is considered to be one of the excellent mushrooms for\r\nfood. When fresh it has a mealy odor and taste, as do several of the\r\nspecies of this genus. It is known as the prune mushroom.\r\n\r\n=Clitopilus orcella= Bull. =Edible.=--This plant is sometimes spoken of\r\nas the sweet-bread mushroom. It is much like the prune mushroom just\r\ndescribed, in odor and taste, and sometimes resembles it in form and\r\nother characters. It is white in color, and the plants are usually\r\nconsiderably smaller, and the pileus is, according to my observations,\r\nsometimes more irregular, lobed and wavy on the margin. The flesh is\r\nalso softer, and the cap is said to be slightly viscid in wet weather.\r\nThe plant grows in the woods and sometimes in open fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTOLOMA Fr.\r\n\r\nThe volva and annulus are absent in this genus, the spores are rosy, the\r\ngills adnate to sinuate or adnexed, easily separating from the stem in\r\nsome species. The stem is fleshy or fibrous, sometimes waxy, and the\r\npileus is fleshy with the margin incurved, especially when young. The\r\nspores are prominently angular. The genus corresponds with _Tricholoma_\r\nof the white-spored agarics, and also with _Hebeloma_ and _Inocybe_ of\r\nthe ochre-spored ones. _Entoloma repandum_ Bull., is an _Inocybe_ [_I.\r\nrepandum_ (Bull.) Bres.] and has angular spores resembling those of an\r\n_Entoloma_, but the spores are not rosy.\r\n\r\n=Entoloma jubatum= Fr.--Growing on the ground in woods. The plants are\r\n5--10 cm. high, the cap 3--6 cm. broad, and the stem 3--6 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is conic in some plants, to convex and umbonate, thin,\r\nminutely scaly with blackish hairy scales, dull heliotrope purple,\r\ndarker on the umbo. The =gills= are vinaceous rufus to deep flesh color,\r\nstrongly sinuate, and irregularly notched along the edge. The =spores=\r\nare irregularly oval to short oblong, coarsely angular, with an oil\r\ndrop, 5--7 angled, 7--11 × 6--7 µ. The =stem= is of the same color as\r\nthe pileus, sometimes deeply rooting, hollow. Figure 139 is from plants\r\n(No. 4000, C. U. herbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N. C., during\r\nSeptember, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Entoloma grayanum= Pk.--This plant grows on the ground in woods. It is\r\nfrom 6--8 cm. high, the cap is 3--6 cm. broad, and the stem 4--6 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 139.--Entoloma jubatum. Entire plant dull\r\nheliotrope purple, gills later flesh color (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, sometimes broadly umbonate, drab in\r\ncolor, the surface wrinkled or rugose, and watery in appearance. The\r\nflesh is thin and the margin incurved. The =gills= are first drab in\r\ncolor, but lighter than the pileus, becoming pinkish in age. The\r\n=spores= on paper are very light salmon color. They are globose or\r\nrounded in outline, 5--7 angled, with an oil globule, 8--10 µ in\r\ndiameter. The =stem= is the same color as the pileus, but lighter,\r\nstriate, hollow, somewhat twisted, and enlarged below. Figure 140 is\r\nfrom plants (No. 3998, C. U. herbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N.\r\nC., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 140.--Entoloma grayanum. Cap and stem drab, gills\r\nflesh color (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Entoloma strictius= Pk.--The plants grow in grassy places, pastures,\r\netc. They are clustered, sometimes two or three joined at the base of\r\nthe stem. They are 7--10 cm. high, the caps 2--4 cm. broad, and the\r\nstems 3--6 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, the disk expanded, and the margin incurved and\r\nmore or less wavy or repand on the extreme edge. It is umbonate at the\r\ncenter with usually a slight depression around the umbo, smooth, watery\r\n(hygrophanous) in appearance, not viscid, of an umber color, shining,\r\nfaintly and closely striate on the margin. In drying the surface of the\r\npileus loses some of its dark umber color and presents a silvery sheen.\r\nThe flesh is fibrous and umber color also. The =gills= are grayish\r\nwhite, then tinged with flesh color, slightly sinuate, the longer ones\r\nsomewhat broader in the middle (ventricose), rather distant, and quite\r\nthick as seen in cross section, the center of the gill (trama)\r\npresenting parallel threads. The sub-hymenium is very thin and composed\r\nof small cells; the =basidia= are clavate, 25--30 × 9--10 µ, and\r\nfour-spored. The =spores= are dull rose color on paper, subgloblose,\r\n5--8 µ in diameter, angular with 5--6 angles as seen from one side. The\r\n=stem= is the same color as the pileus, but considerably lighter. It is\r\nhollow with white fibers within, fibrous striate on the surface,\r\ntwisted, brittle, and somewhat cartilaginous, partly snapping, but\r\nholding by fibers in places, cylindrical, even, ascending, with delicate\r\nwhite fibers covering the lower end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 141.--Entoloma strictius.

The plants are 3--5 cm. high, the cap 2--4 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem 2--3 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then more or less expanded, umbilicate, rarely\r\numbonate, hair brown (mouse colored), with dark scales on the center and\r\nminute scales over the surface, striate.\r\n\r\nThe =gills= are sinuate to adnexed. The =spores= are strongly 5--6\r\nangled, 10--12 × 8--10 µ. The =stem= is smooth, even, usually the same\r\ncolor as the cap, but sometimes it is reddish brown, green, or blue.\r\nFigure 142 is from plants (No. 3996, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N.

The stem is cartilaginous, hollow or stuffed. The pileus is\r\nthin and somewhat membranaceous, plane or depressed at the center, and\r\nthe margin at first incurved. The gills are more or less decurrent.\r\n\r\n=Eccilia polita= Pers.--This plant occurs on the ground in woods. It is\r\n6--10 cm. high, the cap 2--4 cm. broad, and the stem is 3--4 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 143.--Eccilia polita.

The =gills= are decurrent. In the specimens illustrated in\r\nFig. 143 the gills are very irregular and many of them appear sinuate.\r\nThe =spores= are strongly 4--5 angled, some of them square, 10--12 µ in\r\ndiameter, with a prominent mucro at one angle. The =stem= is\r\ncartilaginous, becoming hollow, lighter in color than the pileus, and\r\nsomewhat enlarged below. Figure 143 is from plants (No. 3999, C.

Cap rich yellow or buff, gills flesh color (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAUDOPUS W. Smith.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Claudopus_, recognized by some, the pileus is eccentric or\r\nlateral, that is, the stem is attached near the side of the cap, or the\r\ncap is sessile and attached by one side to the wood on which the plant\r\nis growing; or the plants are resupinate, that is, they may be spread\r\nover the surface of the wood.\r\n\r\nThe genus is perhaps not well separated from some of the species of\r\n_Pleurotus_ with lilac spores like _P. sapidus_. In fact, a number of\r\nthe species were formerly placed in _Pleurotus_, while others were\r\nplaced in _Crepidotus_ among the ochre-spored agarics. Several species\r\nare reported from America. Peck in 39th Report N. Y. State Mus., p. 67,\r\n_et seq._, 1886, describes five species.\r\n\r\n=Claudopus nidulans= (Pers.) Pk.--This is one of the very pretty agarics\r\ngrowing on dead branches and trunks during the autumn, and is widely\r\ndistributed. It has, however, been placed in the genus _Pleurotus_, as\r\n_P. nidulans_. But because of the pink color of the spores in mass, Peck\r\nplaces it in the genus _Claudopus_, where Fries suggested it should go\r\nif removed from _Pleurotus_. It seems to be identical with _Panus\r\ndorsalis Bosc_. It is usually sessile and attached to the side of dead\r\nbranches, logs, etc., in a shelving manner, or sometimes it is\r\nresupinate.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is sessile, or sometimes narrowed at the base into a short\r\nstem, the caps often numerous and crowded together in an overlapping or\r\nimbricate manner. It is nearly orbicular, or reniform, and 1--5 cm.\r\nbroad. The margin is at first involute. The surface is coarsely hairy or\r\ntomentose, or scaly toward the margin, of a rich yellow or buff color.\r\nIt is soft, but rather tough in consistency. The =gills= are broad,\r\norange yellow. The =spores=, pink in mass, are smooth, elongated,\r\nsomewhat curved, 6--8 µ long.\r\n\r\nFigure 144 is from plants (No. 2660, C.

For analytical keys to the genera see Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOLIOTA Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pholiota_ has ferruginous or ferruginous brown spores. It\r\nlacks a volva, but has an annulus; the gills are attached to the stem.\r\nIt then corresponds to _Armillaria_ among white-spored agarics, and\r\n_Stropharia_ among the purple-brown-spored ones. There is one genus in\r\nthe ochre or yellow-spored plants with which it is liable to be confused\r\non account of the veil, namely _Cortinarius_, but in the latter the veil\r\nis in the form of loose threads, and is called an arachnoid veil, that\r\nis, the veil is spider-web-like. Many of the species of _Pholiota_ grow\r\non trunks, stumps, and branches of trees, some grow on the ground.\r\n\r\n=Pholiota præcox= Pers. =Edible.=--_Agaricus candicans_ Bull. T. 217,\r\n1770: _Pholiota candicans_ Schroeter, Krypt, Flora, Schlesien, p. 608,\r\n1889. This plant occurs during late spring and in the summer, in\r\npastures, lawns and grassy places, roadsides, open woods, etc. Sometimes\r\nit is very common, especially during or after prolonged or heavy rains.\r\nThe plants are 6--10 cm. high, the cap from 5--8 cm. broad, and the stem\r\n3--5 mm. in thickness. The plants are scattered or a few sometimes\r\nclustered.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then expanded, whitish to cream color or\r\nyellowish, then leather color, fleshy, the margin at first incurved,\r\nmoist, not viscid. Sometimes the pileus is umbonate. The surface is\r\nsometimes uneven from numerous crowded shallow pits, giving it a frothy\r\nappearance. In age the margin often becomes upturned and fluted. The\r\n=gills= are adnate or slightly decurrent by a tooth, 3--4 mm. broad, a\r\nlittle broader at or near the middle, crowded, white, then ferruginous\r\nbrown, edge sometimes whitish. There is often a prominent angle in the\r\ngills at their broadest diameter, not far from the stem, which gives to\r\nthem, when the plants are young or middle age, a sinuate appearance. The\r\n=spores= are ferruginous brown, elliptical. =Cystidia= abruptly\r\nclub-shaped, with a broad apiculus. The =stem= is stuffed, later\r\nfistulose, even, fragile, striate often above the annulus. The stem is\r\nwhitish or sometimes flesh color. The veil is whitish, large, frail, and\r\nsometimes breaks away from the stem and clings in shreds to the margin\r\nof the cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 46, FIGURE 145.--Pholiota praecox.

The plants are usually clustered, 3--5 cm. high, and the\r\ncaps 6--12 mm. in diameter, the annulus is thin but entire and\r\npersistent. The entire plant is bay brown, becoming ochraceous in color,\r\nand the margin of the cap in age is striate, first bell-shaped, then\r\nconvex and somewhat umbonate. The gills are lightly adnexed.\r\n\r\n=Pholiota adiposa= Fr.--The fatty pholiota usually forms large clusters\r\nduring the autumn, on the trunks of trees, stumps, etc. It is sometimes\r\nof large size, measuring up to 15 cm. and the pileus up to 17 cm.\r\nbroad. Specimens collected at Ithaca during October, 1899, were 8--10\r\ncm. high, the pileus 4--8 cm. broad, and the stems 5--9 mm. in\r\nthickness. The plants grew eight to ten in a cluster and the bases of\r\nthe stems were closely crowded and loosely joined.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then expanded, the margin more or less inrolled,\r\nthen incurved, prominently umbonate, very viscid when moist, the ground\r\ncolor a saffron yellow or in the center burnt umber to wood brown. The\r\ncuticle of the pileus is plain or torn into scales which are wood brown,\r\nor when close together they are often darker, sometimes nearly black.\r\nThe flesh is saffron yellow, thick at the center of the cap, thinning\r\nout toward the margin, spongy and almost tasteless. The =gills= are\r\nadnate, and sometimes a little notched, brown (mars brown), and the edge\r\nyellow, 6--7 mm. broad. The =spores= are 8 × 5 µ. The =stem= tapers\r\ndownward, is compact, whitish then yellow, saffron yellow, flesh\r\nvinaceous, viscid, and clothed more or less with reflexed (pointing\r\ndownward) scales. The stem is somewhat cartilaginous, tough, but\r\nsnapping off in places. The veil is thin floccose and sometimes with\r\ncoarse scales, soon disappearing.\r\n\r\nFigure 146 is from plants (No. 3295, C.

It is brownish or ferruginous in color.\r\n\r\n=Pholiota squarrosoides= Pk., as its name indicates, is closely related\r\nto _P. squarrosa_. It has erect, pointed, persistent scales, especially\r\nwhen young, and has a similar habit to _squarrosa_, but differs chiefly\r\nin the pileus being viscid, while that of _P. squarrosa_ is dry. _P.\r\nsubsquarrosa_ Fr., occurring in Europe, and also closely related to _P.\r\nsquarrosa_, is viscid, the scales are closely appressed to the surface\r\nof the cap, while in _squarrosa_ they are prominent and revolute.\r\n\r\n=Pholiota cerasina= Pk., occurs on decaying trunks of trees during late\r\nsummer. The plants grow in tufts. They are 5--12 cm. high, the caps\r\n5--10 cm. in diameter, and the stems 4--8 mm. in thickness. The pileus\r\nis smooth, watery when damp, cinnamon in color when fresh, becoming\r\nyellowish in drying, and the flesh is yellowish. The stem is solid, and\r\nequal, the apex mealy. The annulus is not persistent, and the gills are\r\ncrowded and notched. The spores are elliptical, and rugose, 5 × 8 µ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 48, FIGURE 148.--Pholiota squarrosoides.

The =gills= are\r\nattached to the stem by the upper angle (adnexed), rounded, or some of\r\nthem angled, some nearly free. In color they are first gray, then rusty\r\nbrown. They appear ascending because of the somewhat top-shaped pileus.\r\nThe =spores= are irregularly ovoid, 4--6 × 3--3.5 µ. The =stem= is\r\ncylindrical or slightly tapering upward, smooth, slightly striate above\r\nthe annulus, whitish, solid, with a tendency to become hollow. The\r\n=veil= is thick, and the annulus narrow and very thick or \"tumid,\"\r\neasily breaking up and disappearing. The plant is quite readily\r\ndistinguished by the form of the pileus with the ascending gills and the\r\ntumid annulus. Peck says it has a \"somewhat nutty flavor.\"\r\n\r\nFigure 149 is from plants (No. 4014, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUCORIA Fr.\r\n\r\nThis genus, with ferruginous spores, corresponds with _Collybia_ among\r\nthe white-spored agarics. The gills are free or attached, but not\r\ndecurrent, and the stem is cartilaginous. The plants grow both on the\r\nground and on wood. Peck, 23rd Report N. Y. State Mus., p. 91, _et\r\nseq._, gives a synopsis of seven species.\r\n\r\n=Naucoria semi-orbicularis= Bull. =Edible.=--This is one of the common\r\nand widely distributed species. It occurs in lawns, pastures, roadsides,\r\netc., in waste places, from June to autumn, being more abundant in rainy\r\nweather. The plants are 7--10 cm. high, the cap 3--5 cm. broad, and the\r\nstem 2--3 mm. in thickness. The =pileus= is convex to expanded, and is\r\nremarkably hemispherical, from which the species takes the name of\r\n_semi-orbicularis_. It is smooth, viscid when moist, tawny, and in age\r\nochraceous, sometimes the surface is cracked into areas. The =gills= are\r\nattached, sometimes notched, crowded, much broader than the thickness\r\nof the pileus, pale, then reddish brown. The =stem= is tough, slender,\r\nsmooth, even, pale reddish brown, shining, stuffed with a whitish pith.\r\nPeck says that the plants have an oily flavor resembling beechnuts.\r\n\r\n=Naucoria vernalis= Pk.--_Naucoria vernalis_ was described by Peck in\r\n23rd Report N. Y. State Mus., p. 91, from plants collected in May. The\r\nplants described here appeared in woods in late autumn. The specimens\r\nfrom which this description is drawn were found growing from the under\r\nside of a very rotten beech log, usually from deep crevices in the log,\r\nso that only the pileus is visible or exposed well to the view. The\r\nplants are 4--8 cm. high, the cap 2--3 cm. broad, and the stem 4--5 mm.\r\nin thickness. The taste is bitter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 150.--Naucoria vernalis. Cap hair brown to clay\r\ncolor; gills grayish brown to wood brown; stem clay color (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then the center is nearly or quite expanded, the\r\nmargin at first inrolled and never fully expanded, hygrophanous, smooth\r\n(not striate nor rugose), flesh about 5--6 mm. thick at center, thin\r\ntoward the margin. The color changes during growth, it is from\r\nochraceous rufus when young (1--2 mm. broad), then clove brown to hair\r\nbrown and clay color in age. The =gills= are grayish brown to wood\r\nbrown, at first adnate to slightly sinuate, then easily breaking away\r\nand appearing adnexed. The =spores= are wood brown in color, oval to\r\nshort elliptical and inequilateral 6--8 × 4--5 µ. =Cystidia= hyaline,\r\nbottle shaped, 40--50 × 8--12 µ. The =stem= is somewhat hollow and\r\nstuffed, rather cartilaginous, though somewhat brittle, especially when\r\nvery damp, breaking out from the pileus easily though with fragments of\r\nthe gills remaining attached, not strongly continuous with the substance\r\nof the pileus. The color is buff to pale clay color; the stem being\r\neven, not bulbous but somewhat enlarged below, mealy over the entire\r\nlength, which may be washed off by rains, striate at apex either from\r\nmarks left by the gills or remnants of the gills as they become freed\r\nfrom the stem. Base of stem sometimes with white cottony threads,\r\nespecially in damp situations. In the original description the stem is\r\nsaid to be \"striate sulcate.\" Figure 150 is from plants (No. 3242, C. U.\r\nherbarium) collected in woods near Ithaca, October 1, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALERA Fr.\r\n\r\n_Galera_ with ochraceous (ochraceous ferruginous) spores corresponds to\r\n_Mycena_ among the white-spored agarics. The pileus is usually\r\nbell-shaped, and when young the margin fits straight against the stem.\r\nThe stem is somewhat cartilaginous, but often very fragile. The genus\r\ndoes not contain many species. Peck gives a synopsis of five American\r\nspecies in the 23rd Report N. Y. State Mus., p. 93, _et seq._, and of\r\ntwelve species in the 46th Report, p. 61, _et seq._ One of the common\r\nspecies is =Galera tenera= Schaeff. It occurs in grassy fields or in\r\nmanured places. The plants are 5--8 cm. high, the cap 8--16 mm. broad,\r\nand the stem 2--3 mm. in thickness. The =pileus= is oval to bell-shaped,\r\nand tawny in color, thin, smooth, finely striate, becoming paler when\r\ndry. The =gills= are crowded, reddish-brown, adnexed and easily\r\nseparating. The =stem= is smooth, colored like the pileus but a little\r\npaler, sometimes striate, and with mealy whitish particles above.\r\n=Galera lateritia= is a related species, somewhat larger, and growing on\r\ndung heaps and in fields and lawns. =Galera ovalis= Fr., is also a\r\nlarger plant, somewhat shorter than the latter, and with a prominent\r\novate cap when young. =Galera antipoda= Lasch., similar in general\r\nappearance to G. _tenera_, has a rooting base by which it is easily\r\nknown. =Galera flava= Pk., occurs among vegetable mold in woods. The\r\npileus is membraneous, ovate or campanulate, moist or somewhat watery,\r\nobtuse, plicate, striate on the margin, yellow. The plants are 5--8 cm.\r\nhigh, the caps 12--25 mm. broad, and the stem 2--3 mm. in thickness. The\r\nplant is recognized by the pale yellow color of the caps and the plicate\r\nstriate character of the margin. The plicate striate character of the\r\ncap is singular among the species of this genus, and is shared by\r\nanother species, =G. coprinoides= Pk.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAMMULA Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Flammula_, the pileus is fleshy, stem fleshy-fibrous, and\r\nthe gills adnate to decurrent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 151.--Flammula polychroa, under view. Cap\r\nvinaceous buff to orange buff, scales lilac, purple or lavender; gills\r\ndrab to hair brown (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Flammula polychroa= Berk.--This is a beautiful plant with tints of\r\nviolet, lavender, lilac and purple, especially on the scales of the\r\npileus, on the veil and on the stem. It occurs in clusters during late\r\nsummer and autumn, on logs, branches, etc., in the woods. The plants\r\noccur singly, but more often in clusters of three to eight or more. The\r\nplants are 4--7 cm. high, the cap 3--5 cm. broad, and the stem 4--6 mm.\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, and in the young stage the margin strongly\r\nincurved, later the cap becomes expanded and has a very broad umbo. It\r\nis very viscid. The surface is covered with delicate hairs which form\r\nscales, more prominent during mid-age of the plant, and on the margin of\r\nthe cap. These scales are very delicate and vary in color from\r\nvinaceous-buff, lilac, wine-purple, or lavender. The ground color of the\r\npileus is vinaceous-buff or orange-buff, and toward the margin often\r\nwith shades of beryl-green, especially where it has been touched. In\r\nthe young plants the color of the delicate hairy surface is deeper,\r\noften phlox-purple, the color becoming thinner as the cap expands.\r\n\r\nThe =gills= are notched (sinuate) at the stem, or adnate, sometimes\r\nslightly decurrent, crowded. Before exposure by the rupture of the veil\r\nthey are cream-buff in color, then taking on darker shades, drab to hair\r\nbrown or sepia with a purple tinge. The =stem= is yellowish, nearly or\r\nquite the color of the cap, often with a purplish tinge at the base. It\r\nis covered with numerous small punctate scales of the same color, or\r\nsulphur yellow above where they are more crowded and larger. The scales\r\ndo not extend on the stem above the point where the veil is attached.\r\nThe stem is slightly striate above the attachment of the veil. It is\r\nsomewhat tough and cartilaginous, solid, or in age stuffed, or nearly\r\nhollow. The =veil= is floccose and quite thick when the plant is young.\r\nIt is scaly on the under side, clinging to the margin of the pileus in\r\ntriangular remnants, appearing like a crown. The color of the veil and\r\nof its remnants is the same as the color of the scales of the cap.\r\n\r\nThe spores in mass are light brown, and when fresh with a slight purple\r\ntinge. (The color of the spores on white paper is near walnut brown or\r\nhair brown of Ridgeway's colors.) Under the microscope they are\r\nyellowish, oval or short oblong, often inequilateral, 6--8 × 4--5 µ.\r\n\r\nFigure 151 is from plants (No. 4016, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., September, 1899, on a fallen maple log. The plants\r\nsometimes occur singly. It has been collected at Ithaca, N. Y., and was\r\nfirst described from plants collected at Waynesville, Ohio.\r\n\r\n=Flammula sapinea= Fr., is a common plant growing on dead coniferous\r\nwood. It is dull yellow, the pileus 1--4 cm. in diameter, and with\r\nnumerous small scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEBELOMA Fr.\r\n\r\nIn _Hebeloma_ the gills are either squarely set against the stem\r\n(adnate) or they are notched (sinuate), and the spores are clay-colored.\r\nThe edge of the gills is usually whitish, the surface clay-colored. The\r\nveil is only seen in the young stage, and then is very delicate and\r\nfibrillose. The stem is fleshy and fibrous, and somewhat mealy at the\r\napex. The genus corresponds with _Tricholoma_ of the white-spored\r\nagarics. All the species are regarded as unwholesome, and some are\r\nconsidered poisonous. The species largely occur during the autumn. Few\r\nhave been studied in America.\r\n\r\n=Hebeloma crustuliniforme= Bull.--This plant is usually common in some\r\nof the lawns, during the autumn, at Ithaca, N. Y. It often forms rings\r\nas it grows on the ground. It is from 5--7 cm. high, the cap 4--8 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and the stem is 4--6 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 152.--Hebeloma crustuliniforme, var. minor. Cap\r\nwhitish or tan color, or reddish-brown at center; gills clay color\r\n(natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex and expanded, somewhat umbonate, viscid when\r\nmoist, whitish or tan color, darker over the center, where it is often\r\nreddish-brown. The =gills= are adnexed and rounded near the stem,\r\ncrowded, whitish, then clay color and reddish-brown, the edge whitish\r\nand irregular. The =gills= are said to exude watery drops in wet\r\nweather. The =stem= is stuffed, later hollow, somewhat enlarged at the\r\nbase, white, and mealy at the apex. Figure 152 is from plants (No. 2713,\r\nC. U. herbarium) collected in lawns on the Cornell University campus.\r\nThe plants in this figure seem to represent the variety _minor_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINOCYBE Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Inocybe_ there is a universal veil which is fibrillose in\r\ncharacter, and more or less closely joined with the cuticle of the\r\npileus, and the surface of the pileus is therefore marked with fibrils\r\nor is more or less scaly. Sometimes the margin of the pileus possesses\r\nremnants of a veil which is quite prominent in a few species. The gills\r\nare adnate, or sinuate, rarely decurrent, and in one species they are\r\nfree. It is thus seen that the species vary widely, and there may be,\r\nafter a careful study of the species, grounds for the separation of the\r\nspecies into several genera. One of the most remarkable species is\r\n_Inocybe echinata_ Roth. This plant is covered with a universal veil of\r\na sooty color and powdery in nature. The gills are reddish purple, and\r\nthe stem is of the same color, the spores on white paper of a faint\r\npurplish red color. Some place in it _Psalliota_. Collected at Ithaca in\r\nAugust, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBARIA W. Smith.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Tubaria_ the spores are rust-red, or rusty brown\r\n(ferruginous or fuscous-ferruginous), the stem is somewhat\r\ncartilaginous, hollow, and, what is more important, the gills are more\r\nor less decurrent, broad next to the stem, and thus more or less\r\ntriangular in outline. It is related to _Naucoria_ and _Galera_, but\r\ndiffers in the decurrent gills. The pileus is convex, or with an\r\numbilicus.\r\n\r\n=Tubaria pellucida= Bull.--This species grows by roadsides in grassy\r\nplaces. The plants are from 3--4 cm. high, and the cap 1--2 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and the stem 2--3 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 153.--Tubaria pellucida. Dull reddish brown\r\n(natural size).]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is conic, then bell-shaped, often expanded and with a\r\nslight umbo; the color is dull, reddish brown, and it has a watery\r\nappearance. The plant is sometimes enveloped with a loose and delicate\r\nuniversal or outer veil, which remains on the margin of the cap in the\r\nform of silky squamules as shown in the figure. The margin of the pileus\r\nis faintly striate. The =gills= are only slightly decurrent. Figure 153\r\nis from plants (No. 2360 C. U. herbarium) collected along a street in\r\nIthaca.\r\n\r\nThe stem is at first solid, becoming hollow, tapering above, and the\r\napex is mealy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREPIDOTUS Fr.\r\n\r\nIn _Crepidotus_ the pileus is lateral, or eccentric, and thus more or\r\nless shelving, or it is resupinate, that is, lying flat or nearly so on\r\nthe wood. The species are usually of small size, thin, soft and fleshy.\r\nThe spores are reddish brown (ferruginous). The genus corresponds to\r\n_Pleurotus_ among the white-spored agarics, or to _Claudopus_ among the\r\nrosy-spored ones. Peck describes eleven species in the 39th Report, N.\r\nY. State Mus., p. 69 et seq., 1886.\r\n\r\n=Crepidotus versutus= Pk.--This little _Crepidotus_ has a pure white\r\npileus which is covered with a soft, whitish down. The plants grow\r\nusually on the underside of rotten wood or bark, and then the upper side\r\nof the cap lies against the wood, and is said to be resupinate.\r\nSometimes where they grow toward the side of the log the cap has a\r\ntendency to be shelving. In the resupinate forms the cap is attached\r\nusually near one side, and then is produced more at the opposite side,\r\nso that it is more or less lateral or eccentric. As the plant becomes\r\nmature the edge is free from the wood for some distance, only being\r\nattached over a small area. The cap is somewhat reniform, thin, and from\r\n6--12 cm. in diameter. The =gills= radiate from the point where the cap\r\nis attached to the substratum, are not crowded, rounded behind, that is,\r\nat the lateral part of the cap where they converge. They are whitish,\r\nthen ferruginous from the spores. The =spores= are sub-elliptical,\r\nsometimes inequilateral, and measure from 8--12 × 4--6 µ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 154.--Crepidotus versutus. Cap white, downy; gills\r\nwhitish, then rusty (twice natural size) Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Crepidotus herbarum= Pk., is a closely related species, separated on\r\naccount of the smaller spores. Both species grow either on herbs or\r\ndecaying wood. As suggested by Peck they are both closely related to _C.\r\nchimonophilus_ Berk., which has \"oblong elliptical\" spores. The shape of\r\nthe spores does not seem to differ from the specimens which I have taken\r\nto be _C. versutus_.\r\n\r\n=Crepidotus applanatus= Fr., is a larger species, shelving and often\r\nimbricated. =Crepidotus fulvotomentosus= Pk., is a pretty species with a\r\ntomentose cap and tawny scales, usually occurring singly. It is closely\r\nrelated to _C. calolepis_ Fr.\r\n\r\nFigure 154 is from plants of _Crepidotus versutus_ Pk., (No. 2732 C. U.\r\nherbarium) collected on rotting wood at Freeville, N. Y., eight miles\r\nfrom Ithaca. The plants are represented twice natural size.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORTINARIUS Fr.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cortinarius_ is chiefly distinguished from the other genera\r\nof the ochre-spored agarics by the presence of a spider-web-like\r\n(arachnoid) veil which is separate from the cuticle of the pileus, that\r\nis, superficial. The gills are powdered by the spores, that is, the\r\nspores fall away with difficulty and thus give the gills a pulverulent\r\nappearance. The plants are fleshy and decay easily. It is necessary to\r\nhave plants in the young as well as the old state to properly get at the\r\ncharacters, and the character of the veil is only seen in young or half\r\ndeveloped specimens. The species are to be distinguished from other\r\nochre-spored agarics with a cobwebby veil by the fact that the veil in\r\n_Cortinarius_ is superficial and the gills powdery. The number of\r\nspecies is very large, and they are difficult to determine. They mostly\r\noccur in northern countries and in the autumn or late summer; some\r\nspecies, however, occur during early summer. Peck, 23d Report, N. Y.\r\nState Mus., p. 105--112, describes 21 species.\r\n\r\n=Cortinarius (Inoloma) violaceus= (L.) Fr. =Edible.=--This species is\r\nknown by the violet or dark violet color which pervades all parts of the\r\nplant. The plants are 8--10 cm. high, the pileus 7--15 cm. broad, and\r\nthe stem is bulbous, 6--8 mm. in thickness. The veil is single. It\r\noccurs in woods and open places during late summer and in the autumn.\r\nThe flesh of the plant is also violet, and this color is imparted to the\r\nliquid when the plant is cooked. The flavor is said to be something like\r\nthat of _Agaricus campestris_.\r\n\r\n=Cortinarius (Myxacium) collinitus= (Pers.) Fr. =Edible.=--This is known\r\nas the smeared cortinarius because of the abundant glutinous substance\r\nwith which the plant is smeared during moist or wet weather. It grows in\r\nwoods. The plants are 7--10 cm. high, the cap 5--8 cm. in diameter, and\r\nthe stem is 8--12 mm. in thickness. It is usually known by the smooth,\r\neven, tawny cap, the great abundance of slimy substance covering the\r\nentire plant when moist, and when dry the cracking of the gluten on the\r\nstem into annular patches.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, smooth, even, glutinous when wet,\r\nshining when dry, tawny. The =gills= are adnate with a peculiar bluish\r\ngray tinge when young, and clay color to cinnamon when old. The =spores=\r\nare nearly elliptical, and 12--15 × 6--7 µ. The =stem= is cylindrical,\r\neven, and with patches of the cracked gluten when dry.\r\n\r\n=Cortinarius (Dermocybe) cinnamomeus= (L.) Fr. =Edible.=--The cinnamon\r\ncortinarius is so called because of the cinnamon color of the entire\r\nplant, especially of the cap and stem. It grows in the woods during\r\nsummer and autumn. It is a very pretty plant, and varies from 5--8 cm.\r\nhigh, the cap from 2--10 cm. broad, and the stem 4--6 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is conic, or convex, and nearly expanded, sometimes nearly\r\nplane, and again with a prominent blunt or conic umbo. Sometimes the\r\npileus is abruptly bent downward near the margin as shown in the plants\r\nin Fig. 155, giving the appearance of a \"hip-roof.\" The surface is\r\nsmooth, silky, with innate fibrils. Sometimes there are cinnabar stains\r\non parts of the pileus, and often there are concentric rows of scales\r\nnear the margin. The flesh is light yellowish and with stains of\r\ncinnabar. The =gills= are adnate, slightly sinuate, and decurrent by a\r\ntooth, easily separating from the stem, rather crowded, slightly\r\nventricose. The color of the gills varies greatly; sometimes they are\r\nthe same color as the pileus, sometimes reddish brown, sometimes blood\r\nred color, etc. This latter form is a very pretty plant, and is var.\r\n_semi-sanguineus_ Fr.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 155.--Cortinarius cinnamomeus var.\r\nsemi-sanguineus. Cap and stem cinnamon, gills blood red color (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nFigure 155 is from plants (No. 2883 C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nIthaca. The species is widely distributed in this country as well as in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 50, FIGURE 156.--Cortinarius ochroleucus. Entire\r\nplant pale ochre color, gills later ochre yellow (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Cortinarius (Dermocybe) ochroleucus= (Schaeff.) Fr.--This is a very\r\nbeautiful plant because of the soft, silky appearance of the surface of\r\npileus and stem, and the delicate yellowish white color. It occurs in\r\nwoods, on the ground among decaying leaves. The plants are 4--12 cm.\r\nhigh, the cap 4--7 cm. broad, and the stem above is 6--10 mm. in\r\nthickness, and below from 2--3 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 51, FIGURE 157.--Cortinarius ochroleucus. Colors\r\nsame as in Figure 156, this represents older plants.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to nearly expanded, and sometimes a little\r\ndepressed, usually, however, remaining convex at the top. It is dry, on\r\nthe center finely tomentose to minutely squamulose, sometimes the scales\r\nsplitting up into concentric rows around the cap. The cap is fleshy at\r\nthe center, and thin at the margin, the color is from cream buff to\r\nbuff, darker on the center. The =gills= are sinuate or adnate, slightly\r\nbroader in the middle (ventricose) in age, pale at first, then becoming\r\nochre yellow, and darker when the plant dries. The =spores= are tawny in\r\nmass, oval, elliptical, minutely tuberculate when mature, 6--9 × 4--6 µ.\r\nThe =stem= is clavate, pale cream buff in color, solid, becoming\r\nirregularly fistulose in age, bulbous or somewhat ventricose below, the\r\nbulb often large and abrupt, 1.5--3 cm. in diameter. The =veil= is\r\nprominent and attached to the upper part of the stem, the abundant\r\nthreads attached over an area 1 cm. in extent and forming a beautiful\r\ncortina of the same color as the pileus and stem, but becoming tawny\r\nwhen the spores fall on it. The stem varies considerably in length and\r\nshape, being rarely ventricose, and then only at the base; the bulbous\r\nforms predominate and the bulb is often very large.\r\n\r\nFigures 156, 157 are from plants (No. 3674 C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLBITIUS Fries.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Bolbitius_ contains a few species with yellowish or yellowish\r\nbrown spores. The plants are very fragile, more or less mucilaginous\r\nwhen moist, usually with yellowish colors, and, what is the most\r\ncharacteristic feature beside the yellowish color of the spores, the\r\ngills are very soft, and at maturity tend to dissolve into a\r\nmucilaginous consistency, though they do not deliquesce, or only rarely\r\ndissolve so far as to form drops. The surface of the gills at maturity\r\nbecomes covered with the spores so that they appear powdery, as in the\r\ngenus _Cortinarius_, which they also resemble in the color of the\r\nspores. In the mucilaginous condition of the gills the genus approaches\r\n_Coprinus_. It is believed to occupy an intermediate position between\r\n_Coprinus_ and _Cortinarius_. The species usually grow on dung or in\r\nmanured ground, and in this respect resemble many of the species of\r\n_Coprinus_. Some of the species are, however, not always confined to\r\nsuch a substratum, but grow on decaying leaves, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 158.--Bolbitius variicolor. Cap viscid, various\r\nshades of yellow, or smoky olive; gills yellowish, then rusty (natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\n=Bolbitius variicolor= Atkinson.--This plant was found abundantly during\r\nMay and June, 1898, in a freshly manured grass plat between the\r\nside-walk and the pavement along Buffalo street, Ithaca, N. Y. The\r\nseason was rainy, and the plants appeared each day during quite a long\r\nperiod, sometimes large numbers of them covering a small area, but they\r\nwere not clustered nor cespitose. They vary in height from 4--10 cm.,\r\nthe pileus from 2--4 cm. broad, and the stem is 3--8 mm. in thickness.\r\nThe colors vary from smoky to fuliginous, olive and yellow, and the\r\nspores are ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is from ovate to conic when young, the margin not at all\r\nincurved, but lies straight against the stem, somewhat unequal. In\r\nexpanding the cap becomes convex, then expanded, and finally many of the\r\nplants with the margin elevated and with a broad umbo, and finely\r\nstriate for one-half to two-thirds the way from the margin to the\r\ncenter. When young the pileus has a very viscid cuticle, which easily\r\npeels from the surface, showing the yellow flesh. The cuticle is smoky\r\nolive to fuliginous, darker when young, becoming paler as the pileus\r\nexpands, but always darker on the umbo. Sometimes the fibres on the\r\nsurface of the cap are drawn into strands which anastomose into coarse\r\nreticulations, giving the appearance of elevated veins which have a\r\ngeneral radiate direction from the center of the cap. As the pileus\r\nexpands the yellow color of the flesh shows through the cuticle more and\r\nmore, especially when young, but becoming light olive to fuliginous in\r\nage. In dry weather the surface of the pileus sometimes cracks into\r\npatches as the pileus expands. The =gills= are rounded next the stem,\r\nadnate to adnexed, becoming free, first yellow, then ferruginous. The\r\nbasidia are abruptly club-shaped, rather distant and separated regularly\r\nby rounded cells, four spored. The =spores= are ferruginous, elliptical,\r\n10--15 × 6--8 µ, smooth. The =stem= is cylindrical to terete, tapering\r\nabove, sulphur and ochre yellow, becoming paler and even with a light\r\nbrown tinge in age. The stem is hollow, and covered with numerous small\r\nyellow floccose scales which point upward and are formed by the tearing\r\naway of the edges of the gills, which are loosely united with the\r\nsurface of the stem in the young stage. The edges of the gills are thus\r\nsometimes finely fimbriate.\r\n\r\nAt maturity the gills become more or less mucilaginous, depending on the\r\nweather. Plants placed in a moist chamber change to a mucilaginous mass.\r\nWhen the plants dry the pileus is from a drab to hair brown or sepia\r\ncolor (Ridgeway's colors). Figure 158 is from plants (No. 2355 C. U.\r\nherbarium).\r\n\r\n\r\nPAXILLUS Fr.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Paxillus_ the gills are usually easily separated from the\r\npileus, though there are some species accredited to the genus that do\r\nnot seem to possess this character in a marked degree. The spores are\r\nochre or ochre brown. Often the gills are forked near the stem or\r\nanastomose, or they are connected by veins which themselves anastomose\r\nin a reticulate fashion so that the meshes resemble the pores of certain\r\nspecies of the family _Polyporaceæ_. The pileus may be viscid or dry in\r\ncertain species, but the plant lacks a viscid universal veil. The genus\r\nis closely related to _Gomphidius_, where the gills are often forked and\r\neasily separate from the pileus, but _Gomphidius_ possesses a viscid or\r\nglutinous universal veil. Peck in the Bull. N. Y. State Mus. Nat. Hist.\r\n2: 29--33, describes five species.\r\n\r\n=Paxillus involutus= (Batsch.) Fr. =Edible.=--This plant is quite common\r\nin some places and is widely distributed. It occurs on the ground in\r\ngrassy places, in the open, or in woods, and on decaying logs or stumps.\r\nThe stem is central, or nearly so, when growing on the ground, or\r\neccentric when growing on wood, especially if growing from the side of a\r\nlog or stump. The plants are 5--7 cm. high, the cap 3--7 cm. broad, and\r\nthe stem 1--2 cm. in thickness. The plant occurs from August to October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 159.--Paxillus involutus. Cap and stem gray,\r\nolive-brown, reddish brown or tawny (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, and depressed in the center. In the\r\nyoung plant the margin is strongly inrolled, and as the pileus expands\r\nit unrolls in a very pretty manner. The young plant is covered with a\r\ngrayish, downy substance, and when the inrolled margin of the cap comes\r\nin contact with the gills, as it does, it presses the gills against this\r\ndown, and the unrolling margin is thus marked quite prominently,\r\nsometimes with furrows where the pressure of the gills was applied. The\r\ncolor of the pileus varies greatly. In the case of plants collected at\r\nIthaca and in North Carolina mountains the young plant when fresh is\r\noften olive umber, becoming reddish or tawny when older, the margin with\r\na lighter shade. As Dr. Peck states, \"it often presents a strange\r\nadmixture of gray, ochraceous, ferruginous, and brown hues.\" The flesh\r\nis yellowish and changes to reddish or brownish where bruised. The\r\n=gills= are decurrent, when young arcuate, then ascending, and are more\r\nor less reticulated on the stem. They are grayish, then greenish yellow\r\nchanging to brown where bruised. The =spores= are oval, 7--9 × 4--5 µ.\r\nThe =stem= is short, even, and of the same color as the cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 52, FIGURE 160.--Paxillus rhodoxanthus. Cap reddish\r\nbrown, stem paler, gills yellow (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nAt Ithaca, N. Y., the plant is sometimes abundant in late autumn in\r\ngrassy places near or in groves. The Figure 159 is from plants (No. 2508\r\nC. U. herbarium) growing in such a place in the suburbs of Ithaca. At\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., the plant is often very abundant along the\r\nroadsides on the ground during August and September.\r\n\r\n=Paxillus rhodoxanthus= (Schw.)--This species was first described by de\r\nSchweinitz as _Agaricus rhodoxanthus_, p. 83 No. 640, Synopsis fungorum\r\nCarolinæ superioris, in Schriften der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft 1:\r\n19--131, 1822. It was described under his third section of _Agaricus_\r\nunder the sub-genus _Gymnopus_, in which are mainly species now\r\ndistributed in _Clitocybe_ and _Hygrophorus_. He remarks on the elegant\r\nappearance of the plant and the fact that it so nearly resembles\r\n_Boletus subtomentosus_ as to deceive one. The resemblance to _Boletus\r\nsubtomentosus_ as one looks upon the pileus when the plant is growing on\r\nthe ground is certainly striking, because of the reddish yellow,\r\nochraceous rufus or chestnut brown color of the cap together with the\r\nminute tomentum covering the surface. The suggestion is aided also by\r\nthe color of the gills, which one is apt to get a glimpse of from above\r\nwithout being aware that the fruiting surface has gills instead of\r\ntubes. But as soon as the plant is picked and we look at the under\r\nsurface, all suggestion of a _Boletus_ vanishes, unless one looks\r\ncarefully at the venation of the surface of the gills and the spaces\r\nbetween them. The plant grows on the ground in woods. At Blowing Rock,\r\nN. C., where it is not uncommon, I have always found it along the\r\nmountain roads on the banks. It is 5--10 cm. high, the cap from 3--8 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem 6--10 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, then expanded, plane or convex, and when mature\r\nmore or less top-shaped because it is so thick at the middle. In age the\r\nsurface of the cap often becomes cracked into small areas, showing the\r\nyellow flesh in the cracks. The flesh is yellowish and the surface is\r\ndry. The =gills= are not very distant, they are stout, chrome yellow to\r\nlemon yellow, and strongly decurrent. A few of them are forked toward\r\nthe base, and the surface and the space between them are marked by\r\nanastomosing veins forming a reticulum suggestive of the hymenium of the\r\n_Polyporaceæ_. This character is not evident without the use of a hand\r\nlens. The surface of the gills as well as the edges is provided with\r\nclavate =cystidia= which are filled with a yellow pigment, giving to the\r\ngills the bright yellow color so characteristic. These cystidia extend\r\nabove the basidia, and the ends are rounded so that sometimes they\r\nappear capitate. The yellow color is not confined to the cystidia, for\r\nthe sub-hymenium is also colored in a similar way. The =spores= are\r\nyellowish, oblong to elliptical or spindle-shaped, and measure 8--12 ×\r\n3--5 µ. The =stem= is the same color as the pileus, but paler, and more\r\nyellow at the base. It is marked with numerous minute dots of a darker\r\ncolor than the ground color, formed of numerous small erect tufts of\r\nmycelium.\r\n\r\nFigure 160 is from plants (No. 3977 C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899. As stated above, the plant\r\nwas first described by de Schweinitz as _Agaricus rhodoxanthus_ in 1822.\r\nIn 1834 (Synop. fung. Am. Bor. p. 151, 1834) he listed it under the\r\ngenus _Gomphus_ Fries (Syst. Mycolog. 319, 1821). Since Fries changed\r\n_Gomphus_ to _Gomphidius_ (Epicrisis, 319, 1836--1838) the species has\r\nusually been written _Gomphidius rhodoxanthus_ Schweinitz. The species\r\nlacks one very important characteristic of the genus _Gomphidius_,\r\nnamely, the slimy veil which envelops the entire plant. Its relationship\r\nseems rather to be with the genus _Paxillus_, though the gills do not\r\nreadily separate from the pileus, one of the characters ascribed to this\r\ngenus, and possessed by certain species of _Gomphidius_ in even a better\r\ndegree. (In Paxillus involutus the gills do not separate so readily as\r\nthey do in certain species of _Gomphidius_.) Berkeley (Decades N. A.\r\nFungi, 116) has described a plant from Ohio under the name _Paxillus\r\nflavidus_. It has been suggested by some (see Peck, 29th Report, p. 36;\r\nLloyd, Mycolog. Notes, where he writes it as _Flammula rhodoxanthus_!)\r\nthat _Paxillus flavidus_ Berk., is identical with _Agaricus\r\nrhodoxanthus_ Schw.\r\n\r\n_Paxillus rhodoxanthus_ seems also to be very near if not identical with\r\n_Clitocybe pelletieri_ Lev. (Gillet, Hymenomycetes =1=: 170), and\r\nSchroeter (Cohn's Krypt, Flora Schlesien, =3=, 1: 516, 1889) transfers\r\nthis species to _Paxillus_ as _Paxillus pelletieri_. He is followed by\r\nHennings, who under the same section of the genus, lists _P. flavidus_\r\nBerk., from N. A. The figure of _Clitocybe pelletieri_ in Gillet\r\nHymenomycetes, etc., resembles our plant very closely, and Saccardo\r\n(Syll. Fung. =5=: 192) says that it has the aspect of _Boletus\r\nsubtomentosus,_ a remark similar to the one made by de Schweinitz in the\r\noriginal description of _Agaricus rhodoxanthus_. _Flammula paradoxa_\r\nKalch. (Fung. Hung. Tab. XVII, Fig. 1) seems to be the same plant, as\r\nwell as _F. tammii_ Fr., with which Patouillard (Tab. Anal. N. 354)\r\nplaces _F. paradoxa_ and _Clitocybe pelletieri_.\r\n\r\n=Paxillus atro=tomentosus= (Batsch) Fr.--This plant is not very common.\r\nIt is often of quite large size, 6--15 cm. high, and the cap 5--10 cm.\r\nbroad, the stem very short or sometimes long, from 1--2.5 cm. in\r\nthickness. The plant is quite easily recognized by the stout and black\r\nhairy stem, and the dark brown or blackish, irregular and sometimes\r\nlateral cap, with the margin incurved. It grows on wood, logs, stumps,\r\netc., during late summer and autumn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 161.--Paxillus atro-tomentosus, form hirsutus. Cap\r\nand stem brownish or blackish (natural size, small specimens, they are\r\noften larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, expanded, sometimes somewhat depressed, lateral,\r\nirregular, or sometimes with the stem nearly in the center, brownish or\r\nblackish, dry, sometimes with a brownish or blackish tomentum on the\r\nsurface. The margin is inrolled and later incurved. The flesh is white,\r\nand the plant is tough. The =gills= are adnate, often decurrent on the\r\nstem, and easily separable from the pileus, forked at the base and\r\nsometimes reticulate, forming pores. =Spores= yellowish, oval, 4--6 ×\r\n3--4 µ. Stevenson says that the gills do not form pores like those of P.\r\ninvolutus, but Fig. 161 (No. 3362 C. U. herbarium) from plants collected\r\nat Ithaca, shows them well. There is, as it seems, some variation in\r\nthis respect. The =stem= is solid, tough and elastic, curved or\r\nstraight, covered with a dense black tomentum, sometimes with violet\r\nshades. On drying the plant becomes quite hard, and the gills blackish\r\nolive.\r\n\r\n=Paxillus panuoides= Fr.--This species was collected during August,\r\n1900, on a side-walk and on a log at Ithaca. The specimens collected\r\nwere sessile and the =pileus= lateral, somewhat broadened at the free\r\nend, or petaloid. The entire plant is pale or dull yellow, the surface\r\nof the pileus fibrous and somewhat uneven but not scaly. The plants are\r\n2--12 cm. long by 1--8 cm. broad, often many crowded together in an\r\nimbricated manner. The =gills= are pale yellow, and the =spores= are of\r\nthe same color when caught on white paper, and they measure 4--5 × 3--4\r\nµ, the size given for European specimens of this species. The gills are\r\nforked, somewhat anastomosing at the base, and sinuous in outline,\r\nthough not markedly corrugated as in the next form. From descriptions of\r\nthe European specimens the plants are sometimes larger than these here\r\ndescribed, and it is very variable in form and often imbricated as in\r\nthe following species.\r\n\r\n=Paxillus corrugatus= Atkinson.--This very interesting species was\r\ncollected at Ithaca, N. Y., on decaying wood, August 4, 1899. The pileus\r\nis lateral, shelving, the stem being entirely absent in the specimens\r\nfound. The =pileus= is 2--5 cm. broad, narrowed down in an irregular\r\nwedge form to the sessile base, convex, then expanded, the margin\r\nincurved (involute). The color of the cap is yellow, maize yellow to\r\ncanary yellow, with a reddish brown tinge near the base. It is nearly\r\nsmooth, or very slightly tomentose. The flesh is pale yellow, spongy.\r\nThe =gills= are orange yellow, 2--3 mm. broad, not crowded, regularly\r\nforked several times, thin, blunt, very wavy and crenulate, easily\r\nseparating from the hymenophore when fresh; the entire breadth of the\r\ngills is fluted, giving a corrugated appearance to the side. The\r\n=spores= in these specimens are faintly yellow, minute, oblong, broadly\r\nelliptical, short, sometimes nearly oval, 3 × 1.5--2 µ. The =basidia=\r\nare also very minute. The spores are olive yellow on white paper. The\r\nplant has a characteristic and disagreeable odor. This odor persists in\r\nthe dried plant for several months.\r\n\r\nFigure 162 is from the plants (No. 3332 C. U. herbarium) collected as\r\nnoted above on decaying hemlock logs in woods. A side and under view is\r\nshown in the figure, and the larger figure is the under-view, from a\r\nphotograph made a little more than twice natural size, in order to show\r\nclearly the character of the gills. The two smaller plants are natural\r\nsize. When dry the plant is quite hard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 53, FIGURE 162.--Paxillus corrugatus.

POLYPORACEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plants belonging to this family are characterized especially by a\r\nhoney-combed fruiting surface, that is, the under surface of the plants\r\npossesses numerous tubes or pores which stand close together side by\r\nside, and except in a very few forms these tubes are joined by their\r\nsides to each other. In _Fistulina_ the tubes are free from each other\r\nthough standing closely side by side. In _Merulius_ distinct tubes are\r\nnot present, but the surface is more or less irregularly pitted, the\r\npits being separated from each other by folds which anastomose, forming\r\na network. These pits correspond to shallow tubes.\r\n\r\nThe plants vary greatly in consistency, some are very fleshy and soft\r\nand putrify readily. Others are soft when young and become firmer as\r\nthey age, and some are quite hard and woody. Many of the latter are\r\nperennial and live for several or many years, adding a new layer in\r\ngrowth each year. The larger number of the species grow on wood, but\r\nsome grow on the ground; especially in the genus _Boletus_, which has\r\nmany species, the majority grow on the ground. Some of the plants have a\r\ncap and stem, in others the stem is absent and the cap attached to the\r\ntree or log, etc., forms a shelf, or the plant may be thin and spread\r\nover the surface of the wood in a thin patch.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Dædalea_ the tubes become more or less elongated\r\nhorizontally and thus approach the form of the gills, while in some\r\nspecies the tubes are more or less toothed or split and approach the\r\nspine-bearing fungi at least in appearance of the fruit-bearing surface.\r\nOnly a few of the genera and species will be described.\r\n\r\nThe following key is not complete, but may aid in separating some of the\r\nlarger plants:\r\n\r\n     Tubes or pores free from each other, though\r\n       standing closely side by side,                   _Fistulina_.\r\n     Tubes or pores not free, joined side by side,      1.\r\n  1--Plants soft and fleshy, soon decaying,             2.\r\n     Plants soft when young, becoming firm, some\r\n       woody or corky, stipitate, shelving, or spread\r\n       over the wood,                                   _Polyporus_.\r\n     Tubes or pores shallow, formed by a network of\r\n       folds or wrinkles, plants thin, sometimes spread\r\n       over the wood, and somewhat gelatinous,          _Merulius_.\r\n  2--Mass (stratum) of tubes easily separating from the\r\n       cap when peeled off, cap not with coarse scales,\r\n       tubes in some species in radiating lines,        _Boletus_.\r\n     Stratum of tubes separating, but not easily, cap\r\n       with coarse, prominent scales,                   _Strobilomyces_.\r\n     Stratum of tubes separating, but not easily, tubes\r\n        arranged in distinct radiating lines. In one\r\n        species (_B. porosus_) the tubes do not\r\n        separate from the cap,                          _Boletinus_.\r\n\r\nThis last genus is apt to be confused with certain species of Boletus\r\nwhich have a distinct radiate arrangement of the tubes. It is\r\nquestionable whether it is clearly distinguished from the genus Boletus.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLETUS Dill.\r\n\r\nOf the few genera in the _Polyporaceæ_ which are fleshy and putrescent,\r\n_Boletus_ contains by far the largest number of species. The entire\r\nplant is soft and fleshy, and decays soon after maturity. The stratum of\r\ntubes on the under side of the cap is easily peeled off and separates as\r\nshown in the portion of a cap near the right hand side of Fig. 169. In\r\nthe genus _Polyporus_ the stratum of tubes cannot thus be separated. In\r\nthe genera _Strobilomyces_ and _Boletinus_, two other fleshy genera of\r\nthis family, the separation is said to be more difficult than in\r\n_Boletus_, but it has many times seemed to me a \"distinction without a\r\ndifference.\"\r\n\r\nThe larger number of the species of _Boletus_ grow on the ground. Some\r\nchange color when bruised or cut, so that it is important to note this\r\ncharacter when the plant is fresh, and the taste should be noted as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n=Boletus edulis= Bull. =Edible.= [_Ag. bulbosus_ Schaeff. Tab. 134,\r\n1763. _Boletus bulbosus_ (Schaeff.) Schroeter. Cohn's Krypt, Flora.\r\nSchlesien, p. 499, 1889].--This plant, which, as its name implies, is\r\nedible, grows in open woods or their borders, in groves and in open\r\nplaces, on the ground. It occurs in warm, wet weather, from July to\r\nSeptember. It is one of the largest of the Boleti, and varies from 5--12\r\ncm. high, the cap from 8--25 cm. broad, and the stem 2--4 cm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 56, FIGURE 164.--Boletus edulis. Cap light brown,\r\ntubes greenish yellow or yellowish; stem in this specimen entirely\r\nreticulate (natural size, often larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, smooth, firm, quite hard when young\r\nand becoming soft in age. The color varies greatly, from buff to dull\r\nreddish, to reddish-brown, tawny-brown, often yellowish over a portion\r\nof the cap, usually paler on the margin. The flesh is white or tinged\r\nwith yellow, sometimes reddish under the cuticle. The =tubes= are white\r\nwhen young and the mouths are closed (stuffed), the lower surface of the\r\ntubes is convex from the margin of the cap to the stem, and depressed\r\naround the stem, sometimes separating from the stem. While the tubes are\r\nwhite when young, they become greenish or greenish-yellow, or entirely\r\nyellow when mature. The =spores= when caught on paper are\r\ngreenish-yellow, or yellow. They are oblong to fusiform, 12--15 µ long.\r\nThe =stem= is stout, even, or much enlarged at the base so that it is\r\nclavate. The surface usually shows prominent reticulations on mature\r\nplants near the tubes, sometimes over the entire stem. This is well\r\nshown in Fig. 164 from plants (No. 2886, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nIthaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 57, FIGURE 165.--Cap light brown, tubes greenish\r\nyellow or yellowish; stem in these specimens not reticulate (2/3 natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nFigure 165 represents plants (No. 4134, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., in September, 1899. The plant is widely distributed\r\nand has long been prized as an esculent in Europe and America. When raw\r\nthe plant has an agreeable nutty taste, sometimes sweet. The caps are\r\nsometimes sliced and dried for future use. It is usually recommended to\r\ndiscard the stems and remove the tubes since the latter are apt to form\r\na slimy mass on cooking.\r\n\r\n=Boletus felleus= Bull. =Bitter.=--This is known as the bitter boletus,\r\nbecause of a bitter taste of the flesh. It usually grows on or near much\r\ndecayed logs or stumps of hemlock spruce. It is said to be easily\r\nrecognized by its bitter taste. I have found specimens of a plant which\r\nseems to have all the characters of this one growing at the base of\r\nhemlock spruce trees, except that the taste was not bitter. At Ithaca,\r\nhowever, the plant occurs and the taste is bitter. It is one of the\r\nlarge species of the genus, being from 8--12 cm. high, the cap 7--20 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem 1--2.5 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex becoming nearly plane, firm, and in age soft,\r\nsmooth, the color varying from pale yellow to various shades of brown to\r\nchestnut. The flesh is white, and where wounded often changes to a pink\r\ncolor, but not always. The =tubes= are adnate, long, the under surface\r\nconvex and with a depression around the stem. The tubes are at first\r\nwhite, but become flesh color or tinged with flesh color, and the mouths\r\nare angular. The =stem= is stout, tapering upward, sometimes enlarged at\r\nthe base, usually reticulated at the upper end, and sometimes with the\r\nreticulations over the entire surface (Fig. 166). The color is paler\r\nthan that of the cap. The =spores= are oblong to spindle-shaped, flesh\r\ncolor in mass, and single ones measure 12--18 × 4--5 µ.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the plant is somewhat like that of the\r\n_Boletus edulis_, and beginners should be cautioned not to confuse the\r\ntwo species. It is known by its bitter taste and the flesh-colored\r\ntubes, while the taste of the _B. edulis_ is sweet, and the tubes are\r\ngreenish-yellow, or yellowish or light ochre.\r\n\r\nPlate 55 represents three specimens in color.\r\n\r\n=Boletus scaber= Fr. =Edible.=--This species is named the rough-stemmed\r\nboletus, in allusion to the rough appearance given to the stem from\r\nnumerous dark brown or reddish dots or scales. This is a characteristic\r\nfeature, and aids one greatly in determining the species, since the\r\ncolor of the cap varies much. The cap is sometimes whitish, orange red,\r\nbrown, or smoky in color. The plant is 6--15 cm. high, the cap 3--7 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem 8--12 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is rounded, becoming convex, smooth, or nearly so,\r\nsometimes scaly, and the flesh is soft and white, sometimes turning\r\nslightly to a reddish or dark color where bruised. The =tubes= are\r\nsmall, long, the surface formed by their free ends is convex in outline,\r\nand the tubes are depressed around the stem. They are first white,\r\nbecoming darker, and somewhat brownish. The =stem= is solid, tapering\r\nsomewhat upward, and roughened as described above.\r\n\r\nThe plant is one of the common species of the genus _Boletus_. It occurs\r\nin the woods on the ground or in groves or borders of woods in grassy\r\nplaces. Writers differ as to the excellence of this species for food;\r\nsome consider it excellent, while others regard it as less agreeable\r\nthan some other species. It is, at any rate, safe, and Peck considers it\r\n\"first-class.\"\r\n\r\n=Boletus retipes= B. & C.--This species was first collected in North\r\nCarolina by Curtis, and described by Berkeley. It has since been\r\nreported from Ohio, Wisconsin, and New England (Peck, Boleti of the U.\r\nS.). Peck reported it from New York in the 23d Report, N. Y. State Mus.,\r\np. 132. Later he recognized the New York plant as a new species which he\r\ncalled _B. ornatipes_ (29th Report, N. Y. State Mus., p. 67). I\r\ncollected the species in the mountains of North Carolina, at Blowing\r\nRock, in August, 1888. During the latter part of August and in\r\nSeptember, 1899, I had an opportunity of seeing quite a large number of\r\nspecimens in the same locality, for it is not uncommon there, and two\r\nspecimens were photographed and are represented here in Fig. 167. The\r\noriginal description published in Grevillea =1=: 36, should be modified,\r\nespecially in regard to the size of the plant, its habit, and the\r\npulverulent condition of the pileus. The plants are 6--15 cm. high, the\r\ncap 5--10 cm. broad, and the stem 0.5--1.5 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 58, FIGURE 166.--Boletus felleus. Cap light brown,\r\ntubes flesh color, stem in this specimen entirely reticulate (natural\r\nsize, often larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 167.--Boletus retipes. Cap yellowish brown, to\r\nolive-brown or nearly black, stem yellow, beautifully reticulate, tubes\r\nyellow (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, thick, soft and somewhat spongy, especially in\r\nlarge plants. The cap is dry and sometimes, especially when young, it is\r\npowdery; at other times, and in a majority of cases according to my\r\nobservations, it is not powdery. It is smooth or minutely tomentose,\r\nsometimes the surface cracked into small patches, but usually even. The\r\ncolor varies greatly between yellowish brown to olive brown, fuliginous\r\nor nearly black. The =tubes= are yellow, adnate, the tube surface plane\r\nor convex. The spores are yellowish or ochraceous, varying somewhat in\r\ntint in different specimens. The =stem= is yellow, yellow also within,\r\nand beautifully reticulate, usually to the base, but sometimes only\r\ntoward the apex. It is usually more strongly reticulate over the upper\r\nhalf. The stem is erect or ascending.\r\n\r\nThe plant grows in woods, in leaf mold or in grassy places. It is\r\nusually single, that is, so far as my observations have gone at Blowing\r\nRock. Berkeley and Curtis report it as cespitose. I have never seen it\r\ncespitose, never more than two specimens growing near each other.\r\n\r\n=Boletus ornatipes= Pk., does not seem to be essentially different from\r\n_B. retipes_. Peck says (Boleti U. S., p. 126) that \"the tufted mode of\r\ngrowth, the pulverulent pileus and paler spores separate this species\"\r\n(_retipes_) \"from the preceding one\" (_ornatipes_). Inasmuch as I have\r\nnever found _B. retipes_ tufted, and the fact that the pileus is not\r\nalways pulverulent (the majority of specimens I collected were not), and\r\nsince the tint of the spores varies as it does in some other species,\r\nthe evidence is strong that the two names represent two different habits\r\nof the same species. The tufted habit of the plants collected by Curtis,\r\nor at least described by Berkeley, would seem to be a rather unusual\r\ncondition for this species, and this would account for the smaller size\r\ngiven to the plants in the original description, where the pileus does\r\nnot exceed 5 cm. in diameter, and the stem is only 5 cm. long, and 6--12\r\nmm. in thickness. Plants which normally occur singly do on some\r\noccasions occur tufted, and then the habit as well as the size of the\r\nplant is often changed.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of this I found in the case of _Boletus edulis_\r\nduring my stay in the North Carolina mountains. The plant usually occurs\r\nsingly and more or less scattered. I found one case where there were\r\n6--8 plants in a tuft, the caps were smaller and the stems in this case\r\nconsiderably longer than in normal specimens. A plant which agrees with\r\nthe North Carolina specimens I have collected at Ithaca, and so I judge\r\nthat _B. retipes_ occurs in New York.\r\n\r\n=Boletus chromapes= Frost.--This is a pretty boletus, and has been\r\nreported from New England and from New York State. During the summer of\r\n1899 it was quite common in the Blue Ridge mountains, North Carolina.\r\nThe plant grows on the ground in woods. It is 6--10 cm. high, the cap is\r\n5--10 cm. in diameter, and the stem is 8--12 mm. in thickness. It is\r\nknown by the yellowish stem covered with reddish glandular dots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 59, FIGURE 168.--Boletus chromapes. Cap pale red,\r\nrose or pink, tubes flesh color, then brown, stem yellowish either above\r\nor below, the surface with reddish or pinkish dots (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to nearly expanded, pale red, rose pink to\r\nvinaceous pink in color, and sometimes slightly tomentose. The flesh is\r\nwhite, and does not change when cut or bruised. The =tube= surface is\r\nconvex, and the tubes are attached slightly to the stem, or free.\r\nThey are white, then flesh color, and in age become brown. The =stem= is\r\neven, or it tapers slightly upward, straight or ascending, whitish or\r\nyellow above, or below, sometimes yellowish the entire length. The flesh\r\nis also yellowish, especially at the base. The entire surface is marked\r\nwith reddish or pinkish dots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 60, FIGURE 169.--Boletus vermiculosus.

U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Boletus vermiculosus= Pk.--This species was named _B. vermiculosus_\r\nbecause it is sometimes very \"wormy.\" This is not always the case,\r\nhowever. It grows in woods on the ground, in the Eastern United States.\r\nIt is from 6--12 cm. high, the cap from 7--12 cm. broad, and the stem\r\n1--2 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is thick, convex, firm, smooth, and varies in color from\r\nbrown to yellowish brown, or drab gray to buff, and is minutely\r\ntomentose. The flesh quickly changes to blue where wounded, and the\r\nbruised portion, sometimes, changing to yellowish. The =tubes= are\r\nyellowish, with reddish-brown mouths, the tube surface being rounded,\r\nfree or nearly so, and the tubes changing to blue where wounded. The\r\n=stem= is paler than the pileus, often dotted with short, small, dark\r\ntufts below, and above near the tubes abruptly paler, and sometimes the\r\ntwo colors separated by a brownish line. The stem is not reticulated.\r\nFigure 169 is from a photograph of plants (No. 4132 C. U. herbarium)\r\ncollected at Blowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Boletus obsonium= (Paul.) Fr.--This species was not uncommon in the\r\nwoods at Blowing Rock, N. C., during the latter part of August and\r\nduring September, 1899. It grows on the ground, the plants usually\r\nappearing singly. It is from 10--15 cm. high, the cap 8--13 cm. broad,\r\nand the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness, considerably broader at the base\r\nthan at the apex.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to expanded, vinaceous cinnamon, to pinkish\r\nvinaceous or hazel in color. It is soft, slightly tomentose, and when\r\nold the surface frequently cracks into fine patches showing the pink\r\nflesh beneath. The thin margin extends slightly beyond the tubes, so\r\nthat it is sterile. The flesh does not change color on exposure to the\r\nair. The =tubes= are plane, adnate, very slightly depressed around the\r\nstem or nearly free, yellowish white when young, becoming dark olive\r\ngreen in age from the color of the spores. The tube mouths are small and\r\nrotund. The =spores= caught on white paper are dark olive green. They\r\nare elliptical usually, with rounded ends, 12--15 × 4--5 µ. The =stem=\r\nis white when young, with a tinge of yellow ochre, and pale flesh color\r\nbelow. It is marked with somewhat parallel elevated lines, or rugæ\r\nbelow, where it is enlarged and nearly bulbous. In age it becomes flesh\r\ncolor the entire length and is more plainly striate rugose with a\r\nyellowish tinge at the base. The stem tapers gradually and strongly from\r\nthe base to the apex, so that it often appears long conic.\r\n\r\nThe plant is often badly eaten by snails, so that it is sometimes\r\ndifficult to obtain perfect specimens. Figure 170 is from a photograph\r\nof plants (No. 4092 C. U. herbarium) from Blowing Rock, N. C.\r\n\r\n=Boletus americanus= Pk.--This species occurs in woods and open places,\r\ngrowing on the ground in wet weather. It occurs singly or clustered,\r\nsometimes two or three joined by their bases, but usually more\r\nscattered. It is usually found under or near pine trees. The plant is\r\n3--6 cm. high, the cap 2--7 cm. broad, and the stem is 4--8 mm. in\r\nthickness. It is very slimy in wet weather, the cap is yellow, streaked\r\nor spotted with faint red, and the stem is covered with numerous brown\r\nor reddish brown dots.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is rounded, then convex, becoming nearly expanded and\r\nsometimes with an umbo. It is soft, very slimy or viscid when moist,\r\nyellow. When young the surface gluten is often mixed with loose threads,\r\nmore abundant on the margin, and continuous with the veil, which can\r\nonly be seen in the very young stage. As the pileus expands the margin\r\nis sometimes scaly from remnants of the veil and of loose hairs on the\r\nsurface. The cap loses its bright color as it ages, and is then\r\nsometimes streaked or spotted with red. The =tube= surface is nearly\r\nplane, and the tubes join squarely against the stem. The tubes are\r\nrather large, angular, yellowish, becoming dull ochraceous. The =stem=\r\nis nearly equal, yellow, and covered with numerous brownish or reddish\r\nbrown glandular dots. No ring is present.\r\n\r\nThis species grows in the same situations as the _B. granulatus_,\r\nsometimes both species are common over the same area. Figure 171 is from\r\nplants (No. 3991 C. U. herbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N. C.,\r\nSeptember, 1899. The species is closely related to _B. flavidus_ Fr.,\r\nand according to some it is identical with it.\r\n\r\n=Boletus granulatus= L. =Edible.=--This species is one of the very\r\ncommon and widely distributed ones. It grows in woods and open places on\r\nthe ground. Like _B. americanus_, it is usually found under or near\r\npines. It occurs during the summer and autumn, sometimes appearing very\r\nlate in the season. The plants are 3--6 cm. high, the cap is 4--10 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem is 8--12 mm. in thickness. The plants usually are\r\nclustered, though not often very crowded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 61, FIGURE 170.--Boletus obsonium. Cap cinnamon to\r\npink or hazel in color, slightly tomentose; stem white, then pale flesh\r\ncolor (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex to nearly expanded, flat. When moist it is very\r\nviscid and reddish brown, paler and yellowish when it is dry, but very\r\nvariable in color, pink, red, yellow, tawny, and brown shades. The flesh\r\nis pale yellow. The =tubes= are joined squarely to the stem, short,\r\nyellowish, and the edges of the tubes, that is, at the open end (often\r\ncalled the mouth), are dotted or granulated. The =stem= is dotted in the\r\nsame way above. The =spores= in mass are pale yellow; singly they are\r\nspindle-shaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 171.--Boletus americanus. Cap slimy, yellow,\r\nsometimes with reddish spots, tubes yellowish (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nThe species is edible, though some say it should be regarded with\r\nsuspicion. Peck has tried it, and I have eaten it, but the viscid\r\ncharacter of the plant did not make it a relish for me. There are\r\nseveral species closely related to the granulated Boletus. _B. brevipes_\r\nPk., is one chiefly distinguished by the short stem, which entirely\r\nlacks the glandular dots. It grows in sandy soil, in pine groves and in\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n=Boletus punctipes= Pk.--This species has been reported from New York\r\nState by Peck. During September, 1899, I found it quite common in the\r\nBlue Ridge mountains of North Carolina, at an elevation of between 4000\r\nand 5000 feet. It grows on the ground in mixed woods. The plants are\r\n5--8 cm. high, the caps 5--7 cm. broad, and the stem 6--10 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 172.--Boletus punctipes. Cap viscid when moist,\r\nreddish brown, pink, yellow, tawny, etc., tubes yellowish, stem dark\r\npunctate (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, sometimes becoming nearly plane, and it is quite\r\nthick in the center, more so than the granulated boletus, while the\r\nmargin is thin, and when young with a minute gray powder. The margin\r\noften becomes upturned when old; the cap is viscid when moist, dull\r\nyellow. The =tubes= are short, their lower surface plane, and they are\r\nset squarely against the stem. They are small, the mouths rounded,\r\nbrownish, then dull ochraceous, and dotted with glandules. The =stem= is\r\nrather long, proportionately more so than in the granulated boletus. It\r\ndistinctly tapers upwards, is \"rhubarb yellow,\" and dotted with\r\nglandules. This character of the stem suggested the name of the species.\r\nThe =spores= are 8--10 × 4--5 µ. Figure 172 is from plants (No. 4067 C.\r\nU. herbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N. C. It is closely related to\r\n_B. granulatus_ and by some is considered the same.\r\n\r\n=Boletus luteus= Linn. (_B. subluteus_ Pk.) This species is widely\r\ndistributed in Europe and America, and grows in sandy soil, in pine or\r\nmixed woods or groves. The plants are 5--8 cm. high, the cap 3--12 cm.\r\nin diameter, and the stem 6--10 mm. in thickness. The general color is\r\ndull brown or yellowish brown, and the plants are slimy in moist\r\nweather, the stem and tubes more or less dotted with dark points. These\r\ncharacters vary greatly under different conditions, and the fact has led\r\nto some confusion in the discrimination of species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 173.--Boletus luteus. Cap viscid when moist, dull\r\nyellowish to reddish brown, tubes yellowish, stem punctate both above\r\nand below the annulus (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is convex, becoming nearly plane, viscid or glutinous when\r\nmoist, dull yellowish to reddish brown, sometimes with the color\r\nirregularly distributed in streaks. The flesh is whitish or dull\r\nyellowish. The =tube= surface is plane or convex, the tubes set squarely\r\nagainst the stem (adnate), while the tubes are small, with small, nearly\r\nrounded, or slightly angular mouths. The color of the tubes is yellowish\r\nor ochre colored, becoming darker in age, and sometimes nearly brown or\r\nquite dark. The =stem= is pale yellowish, reddish or brownish, and more\r\nor less covered with glandular dots, which when dry give a black dotted\r\nappearance to the stem. In the case of descriptions of _B. luteus_ the\r\nstem is said to be dotted only above the annulus, while the description\r\nof _B. subluteus_ gives the stem as dotted both above and below the\r\nannulus. The =spores= are yellowish brown or some shade of this color\r\nin mass, lighter yellowish brown under the microscope, fusiform or\r\nnearly so, and 7--10 × 2--4 µ. The =annulus= is very variable, sometimes\r\ncollapsing as a narrow ring around the stem as in Fig. 173, from plants\r\ncollected at Blowing Rock, N. C., September, 1899 (_B. subluteus_ Pk.),\r\nand sometimes appearing as a broad, free collar, as in Fig. 174. The\r\nveil is more or less gelatinous, and in an early stage of the plant may\r\ncover the stem as a sheath. The lower part of the stem is sometimes\r\ncovered at maturity with the sheathing portion of the veil, the upper\r\npart only appearing as a ring. In this way, the lower part of the stem\r\nbeing covered, the glandular dots are not evident, while the stem is\r\nseen to be dotted above the annulus. But in many cases the veil slips\r\noff from the lower portion of the stem at an early stage, and then in\r\nits slimy condition collapses around the upper part of the stem, leaving\r\nthe stem uncovered and showing the dots both above and below the ring\r\n(_B. subluteus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 62, FIGURE 174.--Boletus luteus. Cap drab to\r\nhair-brown with streaks of the latter, viscid when moist, tubes tawny\r\nolive to walnut-brown, stem black dotted both above and below the broad,\r\nfree annulus (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the figures of the European plant shows that the veil\r\noften slips off from the lower portion of the stem in _B. luteus_,\r\nespecially in the figures given by Krombholtz, T. 33. In some of these\r\nfigures the veil forms a broad, free collar, and the stem is then dotted\r\nboth above and below, as is well shown in the figures. In other figures\r\nwhere the lower part of the veil remains as a sheath over the lower part\r\nof the stem, the dots are hidden. I have three specimens of the _B.\r\nluteus_ of Europe from Dr. Bresadola, collected at Trento,\r\nAustria-Hungary: one of them has the veil sheathing the lower part of\r\nthe stem, and the stem only shows the dots above the annulus; a second\r\nspecimen has the annulus in the form of a collapsed ring near the upper\r\nend of the stem, and the stem dotted both above and below the annulus;\r\nin the third specimen the annulus is in the form of a broad, free\r\ncollar, and the stem dotted both above and below. The plants shown in\r\nFig. 174 (No. 4124, C. U. herbarium) were collected at Blowing Rock, N.\r\nC., during September, 1899. They were found in open woods under Kalmia\r\nwhere the sun had an opportunity to dry out the annulus before it became\r\ncollapsed or agglutinated against the stem, and the broad, free collar\r\nwas formed. My notes on these specimens read as follows: \"The =pileus=\r\nis convex, then expanded, rather thick at the center, the margin thin,\r\nsometimes sterile, incurved. In color it runs from ecru drab to\r\nhair-brown with streaks of the latter, and it is very viscid when moist.\r\nWhen dried the surface of the pileus is shining. The =tubes= are plane\r\nor concave, adnate, tawny-olive to walnut-brown. The tubes are small,\r\nangular, somewhat as in _B. granulatus_, but smaller, and they are\r\ngranulated with reddish or brownish dots. The =spores= are walnut brown,\r\noblong to elliptical, 8--10 × 2--3 µ. The =stem= is cylindrical, even,\r\nolive yellow above, and black dotted both above and below the annulus.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 175.--Boletinus pictus. Cap reddish, tinged with\r\nyellowish between the scales, stem same color, tubes yellow, often\r\nchanging to reddish brown where bruised (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Boletinus pictus= Pk.--This very beautiful plant is quite common in\r\ndamp pine woods. It is easily recognized by the reddish cottony layer of\r\nmycelium threads which cover the entire plant when young, and form a\r\nveil which covers the gills at this time. As the plant expands the\r\nreddish outer layer is torn into scales of the same color, showing the\r\nyellowish, or pinkish, flesh beneath, and the flesh often changes to\r\npink or reddish where wounded. The tubes are first pale yellow, but\r\nbecome darker in age, often changing to pinkish, with a brown tinge\r\nwhere bruised. The stem is solid, and is thus different from a closely\r\nrelated species, _B. cavipes_ Kalchb. The stem is covered with a coat\r\nlike that on the pileus and is similarly colored, though often paler.\r\nThe spores are ochraceous, 15--18 × 6--8 µ. The plants are 5--8 cm.\r\nhigh, the caps 5--8 cm. broad, and the stems 6--12 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nFigure 175 is from plants collected in the Blue Ridge mountains, Blowing\r\nRock, N. C., September, 1899.\r\n\r\n=Boletinus porosus= (Berk.) Pk.--This very interesting species is widely\r\ndistributed in the Eastern United States. It resembles a _Polyporus_,\r\nthough it is very soft like a _Boletus_, but quite tenacious. The plants\r\nare dull reddish-brown, viscid when moist, and shining. The cap is more\r\nor less irregular and the stem eccentric, the cap being sometimes more\r\nor less lobed. The plants are 4--6 cm. high, the cap 5--12 cm. broad,\r\nand the short stem 8--12 mm. in thickness. It occurs in damp ground in\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is fleshy, thick at the middle, and thin at the margin. The\r\n=tubes= are arranged in prominently radiating rows, the partitions often\r\nrunning radiately in the form of lamellæ, certain ones of them being\r\nmore prominent than others as shown in Fig. 176. These branch and are\r\nconnected by cross partitions of less prominence. This character of the\r\nhymenium led Berkeley to place the plant in the genus _Paxillus_, with\r\nwhich it does not seem to be so closely related as with the genus\r\n_Boletus_. The stratum of tubes, though very soft, is very tenacious,\r\nand does not separate from the flesh of the pileus, thus resembling\r\ncertain species of _Polyporus_. Figure 176 is from plants collected at\r\nIthaca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 63, FIGURE 176.--Boletinus porosus. Viscid when\r\nmoist, dull reddish brown (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Strobilomyces strobilaceus= Berk. =Edible.=--This plant has a peculiar\r\nname, both the genus and the species referring to the cone-like\r\nappearance of the cap with its coarse, crowded, dark brown scales,\r\nbearing a fancied resemblance to a pine cone. It is very easily\r\ndistinguished from other species of _Boletus_ because of this character\r\nof the cap. The plant has a very wide distribution though it is not\r\nusually very common. The plant is 8--14 cm. high, the cap 5--10 cm.\r\nbroad, and the stem 1--2 cm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is hemispherical to convex, shaggy from numerous large\r\nblackish, coarse, hairy, projecting scales. The margin of the cap is\r\nfringed with scales and fragments of the veil which covers the tubes in\r\nthe young plants. The flesh is whitish, but soon changes to reddish\r\ncolor, and later to black where wounded or cut. The =tubes= are adnate,\r\nwhitish, becoming brown and blackish in the older plants. The mouths of\r\nthe tubes are large and angular, and change color where bruised, as does\r\nthe flesh of the cap. The stem is even, or sometimes tapers upward,\r\noften grooved near the apex, very tomentose or scaly with soft scales of\r\nthe same color as the cap. The =spores= are in mass dark brown, nearly\r\nglobose, roughened, and 10--12 µ long. Figs. 177--179 are from plants\r\ncollected at Ithaca, N. Y. Another European plant, _S. floccopus_ Vahl,\r\nis said by Peck to occur in the United States, but is much more rare.\r\nThe only difference in the two noted by Peck in the case of the American\r\nplants is that the tubes are depressed around the stem in _S.\r\nfloccopus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 64, FIGURE 177.--Strobilomyces strobilaceus.

When the plant is young the tubes are very short, but\r\nthey elongate with age.\r\n\r\n=Fistulina hepatica= Fr. =Edible.=--This is one of the largest of the\r\nspecies in the genus and is the most widely distributed and common one.\r\nIt is of a dark red color, very soft and juicy. It has usually a short\r\nstem which expands out into the broad and thick cap. When young the\r\nupper side of the cap is marked by minute elevations of a different\r\ncolor, which suggest the papillæ on the tongue; in age the tubes on the\r\nunder surface have also some such suggestive appearance. The form, as it\r\nstands outward in a shelving fashion from stumps or trees, together with\r\nthe color and surface characters, has suggested several common names, as\r\nbeef tongue, beef-steak fungus, oak or chestnut tongue. The plant is\r\n10--20 cm. long, and 8--15 cm. broad, the stem very short and thick,\r\nsometimes almost wanting, and again quite long. I have seen some\r\nspecimens growing from a hollow log in which the stems were 12--15 cm.\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is very thick, 2 cm. or more in thickness, fleshy, soft,\r\nvery juicy, and in wet weather very clammy and somewhat sticky to the\r\ntouch. When mature there are lines of color of different shades\r\nextending out radially on the upper surface, and in making a\r\nlongitudinal section of the cap there are quite prominent, alternating,\r\ndark and light red lines present in the flesh. The =tubes=, short at\r\nfirst, become 2--3 mm. long, they are yellowish or tinged with flesh\r\ncolor, becoming soiled in age. The =spores= are elliptical, yellowish,\r\nand 5--6 µ long.\r\n\r\nThe plant occurs on dead trunks or stumps of oak, chestnut, etc., in wet\r\nweather from June to September. I have usually found it on chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe beef-steak fungus is highly recommended by some, while others are\r\nnot pleased with it as an article of food. It has an acid flavor which\r\nis disagreeable to some, but this is more marked in young specimens and\r\nin those not well cooked. When it is sliced thin and well broiled or\r\nfried, the acid taste is not marked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 65.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.--Fistulina hepatica.\r\n  FIG. 2.--F. pallida.\r\n  Copyright 1900.]\r\n\r\n=Fistulina pallida= B. & Rav. (_Fistulina firma_ Pk.)--This rare and\r\ninteresting species was collected by Mrs. A. M. Hadley, near Manchester,\r\nNew Hampshire, October, 1898, and was described by Dr. Peck in the\r\nBulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, =26=: 70, 1899, as _Fistulina\r\nfirma_. But two plants were then found, and these were connected at the\r\nbase. During August and September it was quite common in a small woods\r\nnear Ithaca, N. Y., and was first collected growing from the roots of a\r\ndead oak stump, August 4 (No. 3227 C. U. herbarium), and afterward\r\nduring October. During September I collected it at Blowing Rock, N. C.,\r\nin the Blue Ridge mountains, at an elevation of nearly 5000 feet,\r\ngrowing from the roots of a dead white oak tree. It was collected during\r\nSeptember, 1899, by Mr. Frank Rathbun at Auburn, N. Y. It was collected\r\nby Ravenel in the mountains of South Carolina, around a white oak stump\r\nby Peters in Alabama, and was first described by Berkeley in 1872, in\r\n=Grev. 1=: 71, Notices of N. A. F. No. 173. Growing from roots or wood\r\nunderneath the surface of the ground, the plant has an erect stem, the\r\nlength of the stem depending on the depth at which the root is buried,\r\njust as in the case of _Polyporus radicatus_, which has a similar\r\nhabitat. The plants are 5--12 cm. high, the cap is 3--7 cm. broad, and\r\nthe stem 6--8 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 66, FIGURE 180.--Fistulina pallida. Cap wood-brown\r\nto fawn or clay color, tubes and lower part of the stem whitish (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is wood brown to fawn, clay color or isabelline color. It\r\nis nearly semi-circular to reniform in outline, and the margin broadly\r\ncrenate, or sometimes lobed. The stem is attached at the concave margin,\r\nwhere the cap is auriculate and has a prominent boss or elevation, and\r\nbent at right angles with a characteristic curve. The pileus is firm,\r\nflexible, tough and fibrous, flesh white. The surface is covered with a\r\nfine and dense tomentum. The pileus is 5--8 mm. thick at the base,\r\nthinning out toward the margin. The =tubes= are whitish, 2--3 mm. long\r\nand 5--6 in the space of a millimeter. They are very slender, tubular,\r\nthe mouth somewhat enlarged, the margin of the tubes pale cream color\r\nand minutely mealy or furfuraceous, with numerous irregular, roughened\r\nthreads. The tubes often stand somewhat separated, areas being\r\nundeveloped or younger, so that the surface of the under side is not\r\nregular. The tubes are not so crowded as is usual in the _Fistulina\r\nhepatica_. They are not decurrent, but end abruptly near the stem. The\r\n=spores= are subglobose, 3 µ in diameter. The stem tapers downward, is\r\nwhitish below, and near the pileus the color changes rather abruptly to\r\nthe same tint as the pileus. The stem is sometimes branched, and two or\r\nthree caps present, or the caps themselves may be joined, as well as the\r\nstems, so that occasionally very irregular forms are developed, but\r\nthere is always the peculiar character of the attachment of the stem to\r\nthe side of the cap.\r\n\r\nFigure 180 is from plants (No 3676, C. U. herbarium) collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., September, 1899. Figures on the colored plate\r\nrepresent this plant.\r\n\r\n=Polyporus frondosus= Fr. =Edible.=--This plant occurs in both Europe\r\nand America, and while not very common seems to be widely distributed.\r\nIt grows about old stumps or dead trees, from roots, often arising from\r\nthe roots below the surface of the ground, and also is found on logs.\r\nThe plant represents a section of the genus _Polyporus_, in which the\r\nbody, both the stem and the cap, are very much branched. In this species\r\nthe stem is stout at the base, but it branches into numerous smaller\r\ntrunks, which continue to branch until finally the branches terminate in\r\nthe expanded and leaf-like caps as shown in Figs. 181--182. The plants\r\nappear usually during late summer and in the autumn. The species is\r\noften found about oak stumps. Some of the specimens are very large, and\r\nweigh 10 to 20 pounds, and the mass is sometimes 30 to 60 cm. (1--2\r\nfeet) in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe plant, when young and growing, is quite soft and tender, though it\r\nis quite firm. It never becomes very hard, as many of the other species\r\nof this family. When mature, insects begin to attack it, and not being\r\ntough it soon succumbs to the ravages of insects and decay, as do a\r\nnumber of the softer species of the _Polyporaceæ_. The caps are very\r\nirregular in shape, curved, repand, radiately furrowed, sometimes zoned;\r\ngray, or hair-brown in color, with a perceptibly hairy surface, the\r\nhairs running in lines on the surface. Sometimes they are quite broad\r\nand not so numerous as in Plate 67, and in other plants they are narrow\r\nand more numerous, as in Plate 68. The tubes are more or less irregular,\r\nwhitish, with a yellowish tinge when old. From the under side of the cap\r\nthey extend down on the stem. When the spores are mature they are\r\nsometimes so numerous that they cover the lower caps and the grass for\r\nquite a distance around as if with a white powder.\r\n\r\nThis species is edible, and because of the large size which it often\r\nattains, the few plants which are usually found make up in quantity what\r\nthey lack in numbers. Since the plant is quite firm it will keep several\r\ndays after being picked, in a cool place, and will serve for several\r\nmeals. A specimen which I gathered was divided between two families, and\r\nwas served at several meals on successive days. When stewed the plant\r\nhas for me a rather objectionable taste, but the stewing makes the\r\nsubstance more tender, and when this is followed by broiling or frying\r\nthe objectionable taste is removed and it is quite palatable. The plants\r\nrepresented in Plates 67 and 68 were collected at Ithaca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 67, FIGURE 181.--Polyporus frondosus. Caps\r\nhair-brown or grayish, tubes white (1/3 natural size, masses often\r\n20--40 cm. in breadth). The caps in this specimen are quite broad, often\r\nthey are narrower as in Fig. 182. Copyright.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 68, FIGURE 182.--Polyporus frondosus. Side and\r\nunder view of a larger cluster (1/3 natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThere are several species which are related to the frondose polyporus\r\nwhich occur in this country as well as in Europe. =Polyporus intybaceus=\r\nFr., is of about the same size, and the branching, and form of the caps\r\nis much the same, but it is of a yellowish brown or reddish brown color.\r\nIt grows on logs, stumps, etc., and is probably edible. It is not so\r\ncommon at Ithaca as the frondose polyporus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 183.--Polyporus umbellatus. Caps hair-brown\r\n(natural size, often much larger). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Polyporus umbellatus= Fr.--This species is also related to the frondose\r\npolyporus, but is very distinct. It is more erect, the branching more\r\nopen, and the caps at the ends of the branches are more or less circular\r\nand umbilicate. The branches are long, cylindrical and united near the\r\nbase. The spreading habit of the branching, or the form of the caps,\r\nsuggests an umbel or umbrella, and hence the specific name _umbellatus_.\r\n\r\nThe tufts occur from 12--20 cm. in diameter, and the individual caps are\r\nfrom 1--4 cm. in diameter. It grows from underground roots and about\r\nstumps during summer. It is probably edible, but I have never tried it.\r\nFigure 183 is from a plant (No. 1930, C. U. herbarium) collected in\r\nCascadilla woods, Ithaca.\r\n\r\n=Polyporus sulphureus= (Bull.) Fr. =Edible.= (_Boletus caudicinus_\r\nSchaeff. T. 131, 132: _Polyporus caudicinus_ Schroeter, Cohn's Krypt.\r\nFlora, Schlesien, p. 471, 1899).--The sulphur polyporus is so-called\r\nbecause of the bright sulphur color of the entire plant. It is one of\r\nthe widely distributed species, and grows on dead oak, birch, and other\r\ntrunks, and is also often found growing from wounds or knot-holes of\r\nliving trees of the oak, apple, walnut, etc. The mycelium enters at\r\nwounds where limbs are broken off, and grows for years in the heart\r\nwood, disorganizing it and causing it to decay. In time the mycelium has\r\nspread over a considerable area, from which nutriment enough is supplied\r\nfor the formation of the fruiting condition. The caps then appear from\r\nan open wound when such an exit is present.\r\n\r\nThe color of the plant is quite constant, but varies of course in shades\r\nof yellow to some extent. In form, however, it varies greatly. The caps\r\nare usually clustered and imbricated, that is, they overlap. They may\r\nall arise separately from the wood, and yet be overlapping, though\r\noftener several of them are closely joined or united at the base, so\r\nthat the mass of caps arises from a common outgrowth from the wood as\r\nshown in Fig. 184. The individual caps are flattened, elongate, and more\r\nor less fan-shaped. When mature there are radiating furrows and ridges\r\nwhich often increase the fan-like appearance of the upper surface of the\r\ncap. Sometimes also there are more or less marked concentric furrows.\r\nThe caps may be convex, or the margin may be more or less upturned so\r\nthat the central portion is depressed. When young the margin is thick\r\nand blunt and of course lighter in color, but as the plant matures the\r\nedge is usually thinner.\r\n\r\nIn some forms of the plant the caps are so closely united as to form a\r\nlarge rounded or tubercular mass, only the blunt tips of the individual\r\ncaps being free. This is well represented in Fig. 185, from a photograph\r\nof a large specimen growing from a wound in a butter-nut tree in Central\r\nNew York. The plant was 30 cm. in diameter. The plants represented in\r\nPlate 69 grew on an oak stump. The tree was affected by the fungus while\r\nit was alive, and the heart wood became so weakened that the tree broke,\r\nand later the fruit form of the fungus appeared from the dead stump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 69, FIGURE 184.--Polyporus sulphureus, on oak\r\nstump. Entirely sulphur-yellow (1/6 natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe tubes are small, and the walls thin and delicate, and are sometimes\r\nmuch torn, lacerated, and irregular. When the mycelium has grown in the\r\ninterior of a log for a number of years it tends to grow in sheets along\r\nthe line of the medullary rays of the wood or across in concentric\r\nlayers corresponding to the summer wood. Also as the wood becomes more\r\ndecomposed, cracks and rifts appear along these same lines. The mycelium\r\nthen grows in abundance in these rifts and forms broad and extensive\r\nsheets which resemble somewhat chamois skin and is called \"punk.\"\r\nSimilar punk is sometimes formed in conifers from the mycelium of _Fomes\r\npinicola_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 70, FIGURE 185.--Polyporus sulphureus. Caps joined\r\nin a massive tubercle (1/2 natural size).]\r\n\r\n_Polyporus sulphureus_ has long been known as an edible fungus, but from\r\nits rather firm and fibrous texture it requires a different preparation\r\nfrom the fleshy fungi to prepare it for the table, and this may be one\r\nreason why it is not employed more frequently as an article of food. It\r\nis common enough during the summer and especially during the autumn to\r\nprovide this kind of food in considerable quantities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 71, FIGURE 186.--Polyporus brumalis. Cap and stem\r\nbrown, tubes white. Lower three plants natural size, upper one enlarged\r\ntwice natural size. Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Polyporus brumalis= (Pers.) Fr.--This pretty plant is found at all\r\nseasons of the year, and from its frequency during the winter was named\r\n_brumalis_, from _bruma_, which means winter. It grows on sticks and\r\nbranches, or on trunks. It usually occurs singly, sometimes two or three\r\nclose together. The plants are 3--6 cm. high, the cap 2--6 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and the stem is 3--6 mm. in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe =cap= is convex, then plane, and sometimes depressed at the center\r\nor umbilicate. When young it is somewhat fleshy and pliant, then it\r\nbecomes tough, coriaceous, and hard when dry. During wet weather it\r\nbecomes pliant again. Being hard and firm, and tough, it preserves long\r\nafter mature, so that it may be found at any season of the year. The cap\r\nis smoky in color, varying in shade, sometimes very dark, almost black,\r\nand other specimens being quite light in color. The surface is hairy and\r\nthe margin is often fimbriate with coarse hairs. The =stem= is lighter,\r\nhairy or strigose. The =tubes= are first white, then become yellowish.\r\nThe tubes are very regular in arrangement.\r\n\r\nFigure 186 represents well this species, three plants being grouped\r\nrather closely on the same stick; two show the under surface and one\r\ngives a side view. The upper portion of the plate represents two of the\r\nplants enlarged, the three lower ones being natural size. The plant is\r\nvery common and widely distributed over the world. Those illustrated in\r\nthe plate were collected at Ithaca. This species is too tough for food.\r\n\r\nMany of the thin and pliant species of _Polyporus_ are separated by some\r\ninto the genus =Polystictus=. The species are very numerous, as well as\r\nsome of the individuals of certain species. They grow on wood or on the\r\nground, some have a central stem, and others are shelving, while some\r\nare spread out on the surface of the wood. One very pretty species is\r\nthe =Polystictus perennis= Fr. This grows on the ground and has a\r\ncentral stem. The plant is 2--3 cm. high, and the cap 1--4 cm. broad.\r\nThe =pileus= is thin, pliant when fresh and somewhat brittle when dry.\r\nIt is minutely velvety on the upper surface, reddish brown or cinnamon\r\nin color, expanded or umbilicate to nearly funnel-shaped. The surface is\r\nmarked beautifully by radiations and fine concentric zones. The =stem=\r\nis also velvety. The =tubes= are minute, the walls thin and acute, and\r\nthe mouths angular and at last more or less torn. The margin of the cap\r\nis finely fimbriate, but in old specimens these hairs are apt to become\r\nrubbed off. The left hand plant in Fig. 187 is _Polyporus perennis_.\r\n\r\n=Polystictus cinnamomeus= (Jacq.) Sacc., (_P. oblectans_ Berk. Hook.\r\nJour. p. 51, 1845, Dec. N. A. F. No. 35: _P. splendens_ Pk., 26th Report\r\nN. Y. State Mus., p. 26) is a closely related species with the same\r\nhabit, color, and often is found growing side by side with _P.\r\nperennis_. The margin of the cap is deeply and beautifully lacerate, as\r\nshown in the three other plants in Fig. 187. _Polystictus connatus_\r\nSchw., grows in similar situations and one sometimes finds all three of\r\nthese plants near each other on the ground by roadsides. _P. connatus_\r\nhas much larger pores than either of the other two, and it is a somewhat\r\nlarger plant. Figure 187 is from a photograph of plants collected at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 187.--Left-hand plant Polystictus perennis;\r\nright-hand three plants Polystictus cinnamomeus. All natural size.\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Polystictus versicolor= (L.) Fr., is a very common plant growing on\r\ntrunks and branches. It is more or less shelving, with a leaf-like\r\npileus, marked by concentric bands of different colors. =P. hirsutus=\r\nFr., is a somewhat thicker and more spongy plant, whitish or grayish in\r\ncolor, with the upper surface tomentose with coarse hairs. =P.\r\ncinnabarinus= (Jacq.) Fr., is shelving, spongy, pliant, rather thick,\r\ncinnabar colored. It grows on dead logs and branches. It is sometimes\r\nplaced in the genus _Trametes_ under the same specific name.\r\n=Polystictus pergamenus= Fr., is another common one growing on wood of\r\nvarious trees. It is thin and very pliant when fresh, somewhat tomentose\r\nabove when young, with faint bands, and the tubes are often violet or\r\npurple color, and they soon become deeply torn and lacerate so that they\r\nresemble the teeth of certain of the hedgehog fungi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 72, FIGURE 188.--Polyporus lucidus. Caps bright red\r\nor chestnut color, with a hard shiny crust (1/6 natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Polyporus lucidus= (Leys.) Fr. [_Fomes lucidus_ (Leys.) Fr.]--This\r\nspecies is a very striking one because of the bright red or chestnut\r\ncolor, the hard and brittle crust over the surface of the cap, which has\r\nusually the appearance of having been varnished. It grows on trunks,\r\nlogs, stumps, etc., in woods or groves. The cap is 5--20 cm. in\r\ndiameter, and the stem is 5--20 cm. long, and 1--2 cm. in thickness. The\r\nstem is attached to one side of the pileus so that the pileus is\r\nlateral, though the stem is more or less ascending.\r\n\r\nThe =cap= is first yellowish when young, then it becomes blood red, then\r\nchestnut color. The =stem= is the same color, and the =tubes= are not so\r\nbright in color, being a dull brown. The substance of the plant is quite\r\nwoody and tough when mature. When dry it is soon attacked and eaten by\r\ncertain insects, which are fond of a number of fungi, so that they are\r\ndifficult to preserve in good condition in herbaria without great care.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the pileus is quite uneven, wrinkled, and coarsely\r\ngrooved, the margin sometimes crenate, especially in large specimens.\r\nFigure 188 represents the plant growing on a large hemlock spruce stump\r\nin the woods. The surface character of the caps and the general form can\r\nbe seen. This photograph was taken near Ithaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\n=Polyporus applanatus= (Pers.) Fr. [_Fomes applanatus_ (Pers.)\r\nWallr.]--This plant is also one of the very common woody _Polyporaceæ_.\r\nIt grows on dead trunks, etc., and sometimes is found growing from the\r\nwounds of living trees. It is very hard and woody. It has a hard crust,\r\nmuch harder than that of the _Polyporus lucidus_. The surface is more or\r\nless marked by concentric zones which mark off the different years'\r\ngrowth, for this plant is perennial. At certain seasons of the year the\r\nupper surface is covered with a powdery substance of a reddish brown\r\ncolor, made up of numerous colored spores or conidia which are developed\r\non the upper surface of this plant in addition to the smaller spores\r\ndeveloped in the tubes on the under surface.\r\n\r\nThe plant varies in size from 5--20 cm. or more in diameter, and 1--10\r\ncm. in thickness, according to the rapidity of growth and the age of the\r\nfungus. The fruiting surface is white, and the tubes are very minute.\r\nThey scarcely can be seen with the unaided eye. Bruises of the tubes\r\nturn brown, and certain \"artists\" often collect these plants and sketch\r\nwith a pointed instrument on the tube surface. For other peculiarities\r\nof this plant see page 15. The age of the plant can usually be told by\r\ncounting the number of the broader zones on the upper surface, or by\r\nmaking a section through the plant and counting the number of tube\r\nstrata on the lower surface of the cap at its base.\r\n\r\n=Polyporus leucophæus= Mont., is said to differ from this species in\r\nbeing more strongly zonate, and in the crust being whitish instead of\r\nreddish brown.\r\n\r\n=Polyporus fomentarius= (L.) Fr. [_Fomes fomentarius_ (L.) Fr.,] is\r\nhoof-shaped, smoky in color, or gray, and of various shades of dull\r\nbrown. It is strongly zoned and sulcate, marking off each year's growth.\r\nThe margin is thick and blunt, and the tube surface concave, the tubes\r\nhaving quite large mouths so that they can be readily seen, the color\r\nwhen mature being reddish brown. Sections of the plant show that the\r\ntubes are very long, the different years' growth not being marked off so\r\ndistinctly as in _P. applanatus_ and _leucophæus_. The plant grows on\r\nbirch, beech, maple, etc. The inner portion was once used as tinder.\r\n\r\n=Polyporus pinicola= (Swartz.) Fr. [_Fomes pinicola_ (Swartz.) Fr.]\r\noccurs on dead pine, spruce, balsam, hemlock spruce, and other conifers.\r\nThe cap is about the width of the _F. applanatus_, but it is stouter,\r\nand does not have the same hard crust. The young growth at the margin,\r\nwhich is very thick, is whitish yellow, while the old zones are reddish.\r\nThe tubes are yellowish, and sections show that they are in strata\r\ncorresponding to the years' growth. =Polyporus igniarius= (L.) Fr.\r\n[_Fomes igniarius_ (L.) Fr.] is a black species, more or less\r\ntriangular, or sometimes hoof-shaped. The yearly zones are smaller,\r\nbecome much cracked, and the tubes are dark brown. One of these plants\r\nwhich I found on a birch tree in the Adirondacks was over 80 years old.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Merulius_ has a fruiting surface of irregular folds or\r\nwrinkles, forming shallow, irregular pits instead of a deeply\r\nhoney-combed surface. =Merulius lacrymans= (Jacq.) Fr., the \"weeping\"\r\nmerulius, or \"house fungus,\" often occurs in damp cellars, buildings,\r\nconduit pipes, etc. It is very destructive to buildings in certain parts\r\nof Europe (see Figs. 189, 190). =Merulius tremellosus= Schrad., is very\r\ncommon in woods during autumn. It is of a gelatinous consistency, and\r\nspread on the under surface of limbs or forms irregular shelves from the\r\nside (see Figs. 191, 192).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 73.--Merulius lacrymans.

Some of them are very large, some quite small, some are\r\nfleshy in consistency, some are woody, corky; some membranaceous; and if\r\nwe include plants formerly classed here, some are gelatinous, though\r\nthere is a tendency in recent years on the part of some to place the\r\ngelatinous ones among the trembling fungi. The special character which\r\nmarks the members of this family is the peculiarity of the fruiting\r\nsurface, just as a number of the other families are distinguished by\r\nsome peculiarity of the fruiting surface. In the _Hydnaceæ_ it covers\r\nthe surface of numerous processes in the form of spines, teeth, warts,\r\ncoarse granules, or folds which are interrupted at short intervals.\r\nThese spines or teeth always are directed toward the earth when the\r\nplant is in the position in which it grew. In this way the members of\r\nthe family can be distinguished from certain members of the club fungi\r\nbelonging to the family _Clavariaceæ_, for in the latter the branches or\r\nfree parts of the plant are erect.\r\n\r\nIn form the _Hydnaceæ_ are shelving, growing on trees; or growing on the\r\nground they often have a central or eccentric stem, and a more or less\r\ncircular cap; some of them are rounded masses, growing from trees, with\r\nvery long spines extending downward; others have ascending branches from\r\nwhich the spines depend; and still others form thin sheets which are\r\nspread over the surface of logs and sticks, the spines hanging down from\r\nthe surface, or roughened with granules or warts, or interrupted folds\r\n(see _Phlebia_, Figs. 193, 194). In one genus there is no fruit body,\r\nbut the spines themselves extend downward from the rotten wood, the\r\ngenus _Mucronella_. This is only distinguished, so far as its family\r\nposition is concerned, from such a species as _Clavaria mucida_ by the\r\nfact that the plant grows downward from the wood, while in _C. mucida_\r\nit grows erect.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDNUM Linn.\r\n\r\nThe only species of the _Hydnaceæ_ described here are in the genus\r\n_Hydnum_. In this genus the fruiting surface is on spine, or awl-shaped\r\nprocesses, which are either simple or in some cases the tips are more or\r\nless branched. The plants grow on the ground or on wood. The species\r\nvary greatly in form. Some are provided with a more or less regular cap\r\nand a stem, while others are shelving or bracket shaped, and still\r\nothers are spread out over the surface of the wood (resupinate).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 195.--Hydnum coralloides. Entirely white (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Hydnum coralloides= Scop. =Edible.=--Among the very beautiful species\r\nof the genus _Hydnum_ is the coral one, _Hydnum coralloides_. It grows\r\nin woods forming large, beautiful, pure white tufts on rotten logs,\r\nbranches, etc. The appearance of one of these tufts is shown in Fig.\r\n195. There is a common stem which arises from the wood, and this\r\nbranches successively into long, ascending, graceful shoots. The spines\r\nare scattered over the entire under side of these branches and hang down\r\nfor 3--6 mm. They are not clustered at the ends of the branches, as in\r\nthe bear's head hydnum, and the species can be easily distinguished by\r\ngiving attention to the form of the branching and the distribution of\r\nthe spines on the under side of the branches. Figure 195 represents a\r\nplant collected at Ithaca, and it is natural size. They grow, however,\r\nmuch larger than this specimen. The species is widely distributed, and\r\nnot uncommon. It is excellent for food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 77, FIGURE 196.--Hydnum caput-ursi. Entirely white\r\n(natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Hydnum caput-ursi= Fr. =Edible.=--This plant is also a beautiful one.\r\nIt is more common than the coral hydnum so far as my observation goes.\r\nIt is known by the popular name of \"bear's head hydnum\" in allusion to\r\nthe groups of spines at the ends of the branches. It occurs in woods\r\nwith a similar habit of growing on trunks, branches, etc. This plant\r\nalso arises from the wood with a single stout stem, which then branches\r\nsuccessively, the ends of the branches having groups of long pendant\r\nspines appearing like numerous heads. Sometimes the spines on the top of\r\nthe group are twisted or curled in a peculiar way. Large tufts are\r\nsometimes formed, varying from 12--20 or more centimeters in diameter.\r\nFigure 196 is from a plant collected at Ithaca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 197.--Hydnum erinaceus. Entirely white (natural\r\nsize, often larger).]\r\n\r\n=Hydnum caput-medusæ= Bull. =Edible.=--The medusa's head hydnum is a\r\nrarer species than either of the above in this country. It forms a\r\nlarge, tubercular mass which does not branch like the coral hydnum or\r\nthe bear's head, but more like the Satyr's beard hydnum, though the\r\ncharacter of the spines will easily separate it from the latter. The\r\nspines cover a large part of this large tubercle, and hang downward. The\r\nplant is known by the additional character, that, on the upper part of\r\nthe tubercle, the spines are twisted and interwoven in a peculiar\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n=Hydnum erinaceus= Bull. =Edible.=--This plant is sometimes called\r\n\"Satyr's beard.\" It grows on dead trunks in the woods or groves, and is\r\noften found growing from wounds in living trees. It forms a large,\r\ntubercular mass which does not branch. The spines are very long and\r\nstraight and hang downward in straight parallel lines from the sides of\r\nthe mass. The spines are from 1--2 cm. or more long. Figure 197\r\nrepresents one of the plants, showing the long spines.\r\n\r\n=Hydnum repandum= L. =Edible.=--This plant is not uncommon, and it is\r\nwidely distributed. It grows usually in woods, on the ground. It varies\r\ngreatly in size, from very small specimens, 1--2 cm. high to others\r\n10--12 cm. high. The cap is 2--18 cm. broad, and the stem 6--12 mm. in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 78, FIGURE 198.--Hydnum repandum. Cap whitish or\r\nyellowish, or pale yellowish brown; spines whitish or yellowish (natural\r\nsize, often smaller). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nIt is entirely white or the cap varies to buff, dull yellow reddish or\r\ndull brown. It is very brittle, and must be handled with the utmost care\r\nif one wishes to preserve the specimen intact. The pileus is more or\r\nless irregular, the stem being generally eccentric, so that the pileus\r\nis produced more on one side than on the other, sometimes entirely\r\nlateral at the end of the stem. The margin is more or less wavy or\r\nrepand. The spines are white, straight, and very brittle. The stem is\r\neven or clavate. Figure 198 is from plants collected at Ithaca during\r\nAugust, 1899, and represents one of the large specimens of the species.\r\nIn one plant the pileus is entirely lateral on the end of the long\r\nclavate stem, and is somewhat reniform, the stem being attached at the\r\nsinus. In the other plant the stem is attached near the center. This\r\nspecies is considered one of the best mushrooms for the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 79, FIGURE 199.--Hydnum putidum. Caps whitish then\r\nbuff, then brownish or nearly black in older parts, edge white (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Hydnum imbricatum= L. =Edible.=--This is a very variable species both\r\nin size and in the surface characters of the pileus. It occurs in woods,\r\ngroves, or in open places under trees. The plants are 3--7 cm. high, and\r\nthe pileus varies from 5--15 cm. broad, the stem from .5--2.5 cm. in\r\nthickness. The pileus is convex and nearly expanded, fleshy, thinner at\r\nthe margin, regular or very irregular. The color is grayish in the\r\nyounger and smaller plants to umber or quite dark in the larger and\r\nolder ones. The surface is cracked and torn into triangular scales,\r\nshowing the whitish color of the flesh between the scales. The scales\r\nare small in the younger plants and larger in the older ones. Figure 200\r\nis from plants collected at Ithaca, and the pileus in these specimens is\r\nirregular. The species is edible, but bitter to the taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 200.--Hydnum imbricatum. Caps brownish, spines\r\nwhitish (natural size, often larger).]\r\n\r\n=Hydnum putidum= Atkinson.--This plant grows on the ground in woods, and\r\nwas collected in the Blue Ridge mountains at Blowing Rock, N. C., at an\r\nelevation of about 4000 feet. It is remarkable for its peculiar odor,\r\nresembling, when fresh, that of an Ethiopian; for its tough, zonate\r\npileus with a prominent white edge, and the stout irregular stem,\r\nresembling the stem of _Hydnum velutinum_. The plants are 8--12 cm.\r\nhigh, the cap 8--12 cm. broad, and the stem 2--4 cm. in thickness. The\r\nplants grow singly, or sometimes a few close together, and then two or\r\nmore may be conjoined.\r\n\r\nThe =pileus= is first umbilicate or depressed, becoming depressed or\r\ninfundibuliform, irregular, eccentric, the margin repand, and sometimes\r\nlobed, and lobes appearing at times on the upper surface of the cap. The\r\nsurface is first tomentose or pubescent, becoming smooth, with prominent\r\nconcentric zones probably marked off by periodical growth; the color is\r\nfirst white, so that the edge is white, becoming cream color to buff,\r\nand in age dull brown and sometimes blackish brown in the center of the\r\nold plants. The pubescence disappears from the old portions of the cap,\r\nso that it is smooth. The pubescence or tomentum is more prominent on\r\nthe intermediate zones. The margin is rather thick, somewhat acute or\r\nblunt, the upper portion of the flesh is spongy and the middle portion\r\ntough and coriaceous, and darker in color. The pileus is somewhat pliant\r\nwhen moist or wet, and firm when dry, the dark inner stratum hard.\r\n\r\nThe =spines= are first white or cream color, in age changing through\r\nsalmon color, or directly into grayish or grayish brown. The spines when\r\nmature are long, slender, crowded, and decurrent on the upper part of\r\nthe stem. The =spores= are white, globose, echinulate, 3--4 µ. The\r\n=stem= is stout and irregular, very closely resembling the stem of\r\n_Hydnum velutinum_, with a thick, spongy, outer layer and a central hard\r\ncore.\r\n\r\nThe odor, which resembles that of a perspiring darkey, before the plant\r\nis dry, disappears after drying, and then the plant has the same\r\nagreeable odor presented by several different species of Hydnum. The\r\nodor suggests _H. graveolens_, but the characters of the stem and\r\nsurface of the pileus separate it from that species, while the tough and\r\npliant character of the cap separates it from _H. fragile_. Figure 199\r\nis from plants (No. 4334, C. U. herbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N.\r\nC., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCORAL FUNGI: CLAVARIACEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis family is a very characteristic one, and very interesting from the\r\nlarge number of beautiful species in one genus, the genus _Clavaria_.\r\nThe plants all are more or less erect, or at least stand out from the\r\nsubstratum, that is, the substance on which they are growing. The\r\nfruiting surface covers the entire upper part of the plant, all but the\r\nbases of the stems. Some of the branched species of the _Thelephoraceæ_\r\nresemble the branched species of the _Clavariaceæ_, but in the former\r\nthere is a more or less well defined upper portion on the tips of the\r\nbranches which is flat, or truncate, and sterile, that is, lacks the\r\nfruiting surface. Some of the species are simple, elongate and clavate\r\nbodies. Some stand singly, others are clustered, or others are joined by\r\ntheir bases, and others still are very much branched. All of the species\r\nare said to be edible, that is, they are not poisonous. A few are rather\r\ntough, but they are mostly the small species which would not be thought\r\nof for food. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia, as in the\r\ncommon mushrooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 80, FIGURE 201.--Clavaria formosa. Yellowish, red\r\ntipped when young, red disappearing in age (natural size, sometimes\r\ntwice this size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAVARIA Vaill.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Clavaria_ is one of the most common ones in the family, and\r\nis one of the most attractive from the variety and beauty of several of\r\nthe species. All of the plants are more or less erect, and at least\r\nstand out from the substratum on which they grow. They are either long\r\nand simple and more or less club-shaped, as the name implies, or they\r\nare branched, some but a few times, while others are very profusely\r\nbranched. The plants vary in color, some are white, some yellow, some\r\nred, and some are red-tipped, while others are brownish in color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 202.--Clavaria botrytes. Branches red tipped\r\n(natural size).]\r\n\r\n=Clavaria formosa= Pers. =Edible.=--This is one of the handsomest of the\r\ngenus. It is found in different parts of the world, and has been\r\ncollected in New England and in the Carolinas in this country. It is\r\nusually from 15--20 cm. high, and because of the great number of\r\nbranches is often broader in extent. There is a stout stem from 2--4 cm.\r\nin diameter, deep in the ground. This branches into a few stout trunks,\r\nwhich then rapidly branch into slender and longer branches, terminating\r\ninto numerous tips. The entire plant is very brittle, and great care is\r\nnecessary to prevent its breaking, both before drying and afterward.\r\nWhen the plant is young and is just pushing out of the ground, the\r\nbranches, especially the tips, are bright colored, red, pink, or orange,\r\nthe color usually brighter when young in the younger plants. As the\r\nplant becomes older the color fades out, until at maturity the pink or\r\nred color has in many cases disappeared, and then the entire plant is of\r\na light yellowish, or of a cream buff color. The spores are in mass\r\nlight yellow, and the spores on the surface of the plant probably give\r\nthe color to the plant at this stage. The spores are long, oval or\r\noblong, 10--15 × 2.5--3 µ, and are minutely spiny. Figure 201 is from a\r\nplant (No. 4343, C. U. herbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N. C., in\r\nSeptember, 1899. The plant is very common in the mountain woods of North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 203.--Clavaria pistillaris. Dull whitish, tan or\r\nreddish (natural size).]\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this Clavaria were several times prepared for table use\r\nduring my stay in the mountains, but the flavor was not an agreeable\r\none, possibly due to the fact that it needs some special preparation and\r\nseasoning.\r\n\r\n=Clavaria botrytes= Pers. =Edible.=--This plant is much smaller than _C.\r\nformosa_, but has much the same general habit and color, especially when\r\n_C. formosa_ is young. The plant has a stout stem which soon dissolves\r\ninto numerous branches, which are red tipped. The spores are white, and\r\nin this way it may be distinguished from _C. formosa_, or from _Clavaria\r\naurea_ (Schaeff.), which has yellow or ochre spores, and which has also\r\nmuch the same habit as _C. botrytes_, and is nearer in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 204.--Clavaria mucida. White (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Clavaria pistillaris= Linn. =Edible.=--This plant is a characteristic\r\none because of its usually large size and simple form. It is merely a\r\nclub-shaped body, growing from the ground. It has a wide range, both in\r\nEurope and North America, but does not seem to be common, though I have\r\nfound it more common in the mountain woods of North Carolina than in New\r\nYork. The plant is 5--20 cm. high, and 1--3 cm. thick at the upper end.\r\nIt is smooth, though often irregularly grooved and furrowed, due\r\nprobably to unequal tensions in growth. The apex in typical specimens is\r\nrounded and blunt. It is dull white or tan color or rufescent. The flesh\r\nis white, and very spongy, especially in age, when it is apt to be\r\nirregularly fistulose. Figure 203 is from plants collected at Blowing\r\nRock, N. C., during September 1899.\r\n\r\nThere is what seems to be an abnormal form of this species figured by\r\nSchaeffer, Table 290, which Fries separated as a distinct species and\r\nplaced in the genus _Craterellus_, one of the _Thelephoraceæ_, and\r\ncalled by him _Craterellus pistillaris_. This plant has been found at\r\nIthaca, and the only difference between this and the _Clavaria\r\npistillaris_ L., seems to be in the fact that in _Craterellus\r\npistillaris_ the end is truncate or in some specimens more or less\r\nconcave. The spores seem to be the same, and the color and general habit\r\nof the two plants are the same. It is probably only a form of _Clavaria\r\npistillaris_.\r\n\r\n=Clavaria mucida= Pers.--This is one of the smallest species of the\r\ngenus _Clavaria_. It grows on rotten wood, and appears throughout the\r\nyear. It is usually simple and clavate, but sometimes branched. The\r\nplant is white, or yellowish, or sometimes rose color, and measures from\r\n0.5 to 2 cm. in height, though I have usually found it from 0.5--1 cm.\r\nin height. It is soft and watery. Figure 204 is from plants (No. 4998,\r\nC. U. herbarium) collected at Ithaca in October, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE TREMBLING FUNGI: TREMELLINEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese fungi are called the trembling fungi because of their gelatinous\r\nconsistency. The colors vary from white, yellow, orange, reddish,\r\nbrownish, etc., and the form is various, often very irregular,\r\nleaf-like, or strongly folded and uneven. They are when fresh usually\r\nvery soft, clammy to the touch, and yielding like a mass of gelatine.\r\nThey usually grow on wood, but some species grow on the ground, and some\r\nare parasitic. The fruit surface usually covers the entire outer surface\r\nof the plant, but in some it is confined to one side of the plant. The\r\nbasidia are peculiar to the order, are deeply seated in the substance of\r\nthe plant, rounded or globose, and divided into four cells in a cruciate\r\nmanner. From each one of these cells of the basidium a long, slender\r\nprocess (sterigma) grows out to the surface of the plant and bears the\r\nspore. A few species only are treated of here.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREMELLA Dill.\r\n\r\nIn this genus the plants are gelatinous or cartilaginous. The form of\r\nthe plant is usually very much contorted, fold-like or leaf-like, and\r\nvery much branched. The fruiting surface extends over the entire upper\r\nsurface of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 205.--Tremella mycetophila, on Collybia dryophila\r\n(natural size).]\r\n\r\n=Tremella lutescens= Pers.--This plant is entirely yellow, and occurs on\r\nbranches. It is 2--5 cm. in diameter, and is strongly folded, somewhat\r\nlike the folds of a brain (gyrose). It is very soft and inclined to be\r\nwatery and fluid, and is of a bright yellow color, spread out on the\r\nsurface of rotten wood. It is of world-wide distribution, and appears\r\nfrom mid-summer to late autumn.\r\n\r\n=Tremella mycetophila= Pk.--This plant is interesting from the fact that\r\nit is parasitic on a mushroom, _Collybia dryophila_. It grows on the\r\nstem or on the top of the cap of the _Collybia_, and it is white, or\r\nyellowish, very much contorted (gyrose-plicate), nearly rounded, and\r\n8--16 mm. in diameter. Figure 205 represents this _Tremella_ growing on\r\nthe _Collybia dryophila_, from plants collected at Freeville woods near\r\nIthaca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 206.--Tremella frondosa. Pinkish yellow or pinkish\r\nvinaceous (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Tremella frondosa= Fr.--This is said to be the largest species of the\r\ngenus. It grows on rotten wood. It occurs in Europe, has been collected\r\nin New York State, and the Fig. 206 is from a plant (No. 4339, C. U.\r\nherbarium) collected at Blowing Rock, N. C., in September, 1899. The\r\nplant figured here was 10 cm. long and about 8 cm. high. It is very much\r\ntwisted and contorted, leaf-like, and the middle and base all united. It\r\nis of a pinkish yellow color, one plant being vinaceous pink and\r\nanother cream buff in color. When young the leaf-like lobes do not show\r\nwell, but as it expands they become very prominent.\r\n\r\nSeveral other species of Tremella are probably more common than the ones\r\nillustrated here. One of the commonest of the _Tremellineæ_ probably is\r\nthe =Exidia glandulosa=, which in dry weather appears as a black\r\nincrustation on dead limbs, but during rains it swells up into a large,\r\nblack, very soft, gelatinous mass. It is commonly found on fallen limbs\r\nof oak, and occurs from autumn until late spring. It is sometimes called\r\n\"witch's butter.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 207.--Tremella fuciformis. Entirely white (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Tremella fuciformis= Berk.--This is a very beautiful white tremella\r\ngrowing in woods on leaf mold close to the ground. It forms a large\r\nwhite tubercular mass resting on the ground, from the upper surface of\r\nwhich numerous stout, short, white processes arise which branch a few\r\ntimes in a dichotomous manner. The masses are 10--15 cm. in diameter,\r\nand nearly or quite as high. The flesh is very soft, and the parts are\r\nmore or less hollow. The basidia are like those of the genus, globose,\r\nsunk in the substance of the plant, and terminate with four long,\r\nslender, sterigmata which rise to the surface and bear the spores. The\r\nspores are white, nearly ovoid, but inequilateral and somewhat reniform,\r\ncontinuous, 7--9 × 5--6 µ.\r\n\r\nFigure 207 is from a plant collected in a woods near Ithaca, in August,\r\n1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYROCEPHALUS Pers.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Gyrocephalus_ differs from the other _Tremellineæ_ in having\r\nthe fruiting surface on the lower side of the fruit body, while the\r\nupper side is sterile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 208.--Gyrocephalus rufus. Reddish or reddish\r\nyellow (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Gyrocephalus rufus= (Jacq.) Bref.--This species is sometimes very\r\nabundant. It grows on the ground, generally from buried wood, or from\r\ndead roots. It is erect, stout at the base, and the upper end flattened\r\nand thinner. It is more or less spatulate, the upper side somewhat\r\nconcave, and the lower somewhat convex. In some plants the pileus is\r\nmore regular and there is then a tendency to the funnel form. It is\r\nreddish, or reddish yellow in color, smooth, clammy, watery, and quite\r\ngelatinous. When dry it is very hard. Figure 208 represents the form of\r\nthe plant well, from plants collected at Ithaca. The plant is quite\r\ncommon in the damp glens and woods at Ithaca during the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHELEPHORACEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the species of the Thelephoraceæ to which the following two\r\nspecies belong are too tough for food. A large number of these grow on\r\nwood. They are known by their hard or membranaceous character and by the\r\nfruiting surface (under surface when in the position in which they grew)\r\nbeing smooth, or only slightly uneven, or cracked.\r\n\r\n=Craterellus cantharellus= (Schw.) Fr., is an edible species. In general\r\nappearance it resembles the _Cantharellus cibarius_. The color is the\r\nsame, and the general shape, except that the former is perhaps more\r\nirregular in form. It may, however, be in most cases easily\r\ndistinguished from _C. cibarius_ by the absence of folds on the under or\r\nfruiting surface, since the fruiting surface is smooth, especially when\r\nthe plants are young or middle age. However, when the plants get quite\r\nlarge and old, in some cases the fruiting surface becomes very uneven\r\nfrom numerous folds and wrinkles, which, however, are more irregular\r\nthan the folds of _C. cibarius_.\r\n\r\n=Craterellus cornucopioides= (L.) Pers., is another edible species. It\r\ngrows on the ground in woods. It is of a dusky or dark smoky color, and\r\nis deeply funnel-shaped, resembling a \"horn of plenty,\" though usually\r\nstraight. The fruiting surface is somewhat uneven.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Stereum_ is a very common one on branches, etc., either\r\nentirely spread out on the wood, or with the margin or a large part of\r\nthe pileus free. _Hymenochæte_ is like _Stereum_, but has numerous small\r\nblack spines in the fruiting surface, giving it a velvety appearance.\r\n_Corticium_ is very thin and spread over the wood in patches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 81, FIGURE 209.--Lycoperdon cyathiforme (natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPUFF-BALLS: LYCOPERDACEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for a discussion of the different genera of the\r\npuff-balls, etc., but it might be well to say that in recent years the\r\nold genus _Lycoperdon_ has been divided into several genera. The giant\r\npuff-ball, and the _L. cyathiforme_, where the wall or peridium ruptures\r\nirregularly, have been placed in a genus called _Calvatia_; certain\r\nother species which are nearly globose, and in which the wall is of a\r\npapery texture at maturity, are placed in the genus _Bovista_. There is\r\none genus belonging to the same family as the lycoperdons, the species\r\nof which are very interesting on account of the peculiar way in which\r\nthe wall is ruptured. This is the genus _Geaster_, that is, \"earth\r\nstar.\" The wall, or peridium, is quite thick in the members of this\r\ngenus, and when it matures it separates into several layers which need\r\nnot all be discussed here. A thick outer portion which separates from a\r\nthinner inner portion further splits radially into several star-like\r\ndivisions, which spread outward and give to the plant the form of a\r\nstar. Since the plants lie on the earth the name earth star was applied\r\nto them. This opens out in dry weather, even curving around under the\r\nplant, so that the plant is raised above the ground. Then in wet weather\r\nit closes up again. The inner portion of the wall opens at the apex in\r\nvarious ways, in the different species, so that the spores may escape. A\r\nclosely related genus has several small perforations like a pepper box\r\nin the upper surface of the inner wall, _Myriostoma_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYCOPERDON Tourn.\r\n\r\nTo this genus belong most of the \"puff-balls,\" as they are commonly\r\ncalled, or, as they are denominated in the South, \"Devil's snuff box.\"\r\nAll, or a large portion, of the interior of the plant at maturity breaks\r\ndown into a powdery substance, which with the numerous spores is very\r\nlight, and when the plant is squeezed or pressed, clouds of this dust\r\nburst out at the opening through the wall. The wall of the plant is\r\ntermed the _peridium_. In this genus the wall is quite thin, and at\r\nmaturity opens differently in different species. In several species it\r\nopens irregularly, the entire wall becoming very brittle and cracking up\r\ninto bits, as in the giant puff-ball. In the remaining species it opens\r\nby a distinct perforation at the apex, and the remainder of the wall is\r\nmore or less pliant and membranous. All of the puff-balls are said to be\r\nedible, at least are harmless, if eaten when the flesh is white. They\r\nshould not be eaten when the flesh is dark, or is changing from the\r\nwhite color.\r\n\r\n=Lycoperdon giganteum= Batsch. =Edible.=--This, the giant puff-ball, is\r\nthe largest species of the genus. Sometimes it reaches immense\r\nproportions, two to three or even four feet, but these large sizes are\r\nrare. It is usually 20 to 40 cm. (8--16 in.) in diameter. It grows on\r\nthe ground in grassy places during late summer and in the autumn. It is\r\na large rounded mass, resting on the ground, and near or at the center\r\nof the under side, it is attached to the cords of mycelium in the\r\nground. It is white in color until it is ripe, that is, when the spores\r\nare mature, and it should be gathered for food before it is thus ripe.\r\nWhen it is maturing it becomes yellowish, then dusky or smoky in color.\r\nThe flesh, which is white when young, changes to greenish yellow and\r\nfinally brownish, with usually an olivaceous tinge, as the spores ripen.\r\n\r\nThe plant is so large that it may be sliced, and should be sliced before\r\nbroiling. A single specimen often forms enough for a meal for a large\r\nfamily, and some of the larger ones would serve for several meals.\r\n\r\n=Lycoperdon cyathiforme= Bosc. =Edible.=--This is called the\r\nbeaker-shaped puff-ball because the base of the plant, after the spores\r\nhave all been scattered, resembles to some extent a beaker, or a broad\r\ncup with a stout, stem-like base. These old sterile bases of the plant\r\nare often found in the fields long after the spores have disappeared.\r\nThe plants are somewhat pear-shaped, rounded above, and tapering below\r\nto the stout base. They are 7--15 cm. in diameter, and white when young.\r\nAt maturity the spore mass is purplish, and by this color as well as by\r\nthe sterile base the plant is easily recognized. Of course these\r\ncharacters cannot be recognized in the young and growing plant at the\r\ntime it is wanted for food, but the white color of the interior of the\r\nplant would be a sufficient guarantee that it was edible, granted of\r\ncourse that it was a member of the puff-ball family. Sometimes, long\r\nbefore the spores mature, the outer portion of the plant changes from\r\nwhite to pinkish, or brownish colors. At maturity the wall, or peridium,\r\nbreaks into brittle fragments, which disappear and the purplish mass of\r\nthe spores is exposed. The plant grows in grassy places or even in\r\ncultivated fields.\r\n\r\n=Lycoperdon gemmatum= Batsch. =Edible.=--This puff-ball is widely\r\ndistributed throughout the world and is very common. It grows in the\r\nwoods, or in open places on the ground, usually. It is known from its\r\ncharacteristic top shape, the more or less erect scales on the upper\r\nsurface intermingled with smaller ones, the larger ones falling away and\r\nleaving circular scars over the surface, which gives it a reticulate\r\nappearance. The plants are white, becoming dark gray or grayish brown\r\nwhen mature. They vary in size from 3--7 cm. high to 2--5 cm. broad.\r\nThey are more or less top-shaped, and the stem, which is stout, is\r\nsometimes longer than the rounded portion, which is the fruiting part.\r\nThe outer part of the wall (outer peridium) when quite young separates\r\ninto warts or scales of varying size, large ones arranged quite\r\nregularly with smaller ones between. These warts are well shown in the\r\ntwo plants at the left in Fig. 210, and the third plant from the left\r\nshows the reticulations formed of numerous scars on the inner peridium\r\nwhere the larger scales have fallen away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 210.--Lycoperdon gemmatum. Entirely white except\r\nwhen old (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe plant at the extreme right is mature, and the inner peridium has\r\nruptured at the apex to permit the escape of the spores. The spore mass,\r\ntogether with brownish threads which are intermingled, are greenish\r\nyellow with an olive tinge, then they become pale brown. The spores are\r\nrounded, 3.5--4.5 µ in diameter, smooth or minutely warted.\r\n\r\nAnother small puff-ball everywhere common in woods is the _Lycoperdon\r\npyriforme_, so called because of its pear shape. It grows on very rotten\r\nwood or on decaying logs in woods or groves, or in open places where\r\nthere is rotting wood. It is somewhat smaller than the gem-bearing\r\nlycoperdon, is almost sessile, sometimes many crowded very close\r\ntogether, and especially is it characterized by prominent root-like\r\nwhite strands of mycelium which are attached to the base where the\r\nplant enters the rotten wood. While these small species of puff-balls\r\nare not injurious to eat, they do not seem to possess an agreeable\r\nflavor. There are quite a number of species in this country which cannot\r\nbe enumerated here.\r\n\r\nRelated to the puff-balls, and properly classed with them, are the\r\nspecies of _Scleroderma_. This name is given to the genus because of the\r\nhard peridium, the wall being much firmer and harder than in\r\n_Lycoperdon_. There are two species which are not uncommon, _Scleroderma\r\nvulgare_ and _S. verrucosum_. They grow on the ground or on very rotten\r\nwood, and are sessile, often showing the root-like white strands\r\nattached to their base. They vary in size from 2--6 cm. and the outer\r\nwall is cracked into numerous coarse areas, or warts, giving the plant a\r\nverrucose appearance, from which one of the species gets its specific\r\nname.\r\n\r\n=Calostoma cinnabarinum= Desv.--This is a remarkably beautiful plant\r\nwith a general distribution in the Eastern United States. It has often\r\nbeen referred to in this country under the genus name _Mitremyces_, and\r\nsometimes has been confused with a rarer and different species,\r\n_Calostoma lutescens_ (Schw.) Burnap. It grows in damp woods, usually\r\nalong the banks of streams and along mountain roads. It is remarkable\r\nfor the brilliant vermilion color of the inner surface of the outer\r\nlayer of the wall (_exoperidium_), which is exposed by splitting into\r\nradial strips that curl and twist themselves off, and by the vermilion\r\ncolor of the edges of the teeth at the apex of the inner wall\r\n(_endoperidium_). The plant is 2--8 cm. high, and 1--2 cm. in diameter.\r\nWhen mature the base or stem, which is formed of reticulated and\r\nanastomosing cords, elongates and lifts the rounded or oval fruiting\r\nportion to some distance above the surface of the ground, when the\r\ngelatinous volva ruptures and falls to the ground or partly clings to\r\nthe stem, exposing the peridium, the outer portion of which then splits\r\nin the manner described.\r\n\r\nWhen the plant is first seen above the ground it appears as a globose or\r\nrounded body, and in wet weather has a very thick gelatinous layer\r\nsurrounding it. This is the volva and is formed by the gelatinization of\r\nthe outer layer of threads which compose it. This gelatinous layer is\r\nthick and also viscid, and when the plants are placed on paper to dry,\r\nit glues them firmly to the sheet. When the outer layer of the peridium\r\nsplits, it does so by splitting from the base toward the apex, or from\r\nthe apex toward the base. Of the large number of specimens which I have\r\nseen at Blowing Rock, N. C., the split more often begins at the apex, or\r\nat least, when the slit is complete, the strips usually stand out\r\nloosely in a radiate manner, the tips being free. At this stage the\r\nplant is a very beautiful object with the crown of vermilion strips\r\nradiating outward from the base of the fruit body at the top of the\r\nstem, and the inner peridium resting in the center and terminated by the\r\nfour to seven teeth with vermilion edges. At this time also the light\r\nyellow spore mass is oozing out from between the teeth. The spores are\r\noblong to elliptical, marked with very fine points, and measure 15--18 ×\r\n8--10 µ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 82, FIGURE 211.--Calostoma cinnabarinum. See text\r\nfor colors (natural size).]\r\n\r\nFigure 211 is from plants collected at Blowing Rock, N. C., in\r\nSeptember, 1899. The _Mytremyces lutescens_ reported in my list of \"Some\r\nFungi of Blowing Rock, N. C.,\" in Jour. Elisha Mitchell Sci. Soc. 9:\r\n95--107, 1892, is this _Calostoma cinnabarinum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE STINK-HORN FUNGI: PHALLOIDEAE Fries.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the stink-horn fungi are characterized by a very offensive odor.\r\nSome of them at maturity are in shape not unlike that of a horn, and the\r\nvulgar name is applied because of this form and the odor. The plants\r\ngrow in the ground, or in decaying organic matter lying on the ground.\r\nThe spawn or mycelium is in the form of rope-like strands which are\r\nusually much branched and matted together. From these cords the fruit\r\nform arises. During its period of growth and up to the maturity of the\r\nspores, the fruit body is oval, that is, egg form, and because of this\r\nform and the quite large size of these bodies they are often called\r\n\"eggs.\" The outer portion of the egg forms the volva. It is always\r\nthick, and has an outer thin coat or membrane, and an inner membrane,\r\nwhile between the two is a thick layer of gelatinous substance, so that\r\nthe wall of the volva is often 3--6 mm. in thickness, and is very soft.\r\nThe outline of the volva can be seen in Fig. 215, which shows sections\r\nof three eggs in different stages. Inside of the volva is the short stem\r\n(_receptacle_) which is in the middle portion, and covering the upper\r\nportion and sides of this short stem is the pileus; the fruit-bearing\r\nportion, which is divided into small chambers, lies on the outside of\r\nthe pileus. In the figure there can be seen cross lines extending\r\nthrough this part from the pileus to the wall of the volva. These\r\nrepresent ridges or crests which anastomose over the pileus, forming\r\nreticulations. The stem or receptacle is hollow through the center, and\r\nthis hollow opens out at the end so that there is a rounded perforation\r\nthrough the upper portion of the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe spores are borne on club-shaped basidia within the chambers of the\r\nfruit-bearing portion (_gleba_), and at maturity of the spores the stem\r\nor receptacle begins to elongate. This pushes the gleba and the upper\r\npart of the receptacle through the apex of the volva, leaving this as a\r\ncup-shaped body at the base, much as in certain species of _Amanita_,\r\nwhile the gleba is borne aloft on the much elongated stem. During this\r\nelongation of the receptacle a large part of the substance of the gleba\r\ndissolves into a thick liquid containing the spores. This runs off and\r\nis washed off by the rains, leaving the inner surface of the gleba\r\nexposed, and showing certain characters peculiar to the various genera.\r\n\r\nAmong the stink-horns are a number of genera which are very interesting\r\nfrom the peculiarities of development; and some of which are very\r\nbeautiful and curious objects, although they do possess offensive odors.\r\nIn some of the genera, the upper part of the plant expands into\r\nleaf-like--or petal-like, bodies, which are highly colored and resemble\r\nflowers. They are sometimes called \"fungus flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDICTYOPHORA Desvaux.\r\n\r\n=Dictyophora= means \"net bearer,\" and as one can see from Fig. 212 it is\r\nnot an inappropriate name. The stem or receptacle, as one can see from\r\nthe illustrations of the two species treated of here, possesses a very\r\ncoarse mesh, so that not only the surface but the substance within is\r\nreticulated, pitted and irregularly perforated. In the genus\r\n_Dictyophora_ an outer layer of the receptacle or stem is separated as\r\nit elongates, breaks away from the lower part of the stem, is carried\r\naloft, and hangs as a beautiful veil. This veil is very conspicuous in\r\nsome species and less so in others.\r\n\r\n=Dictyophora duplicata= (Bosc.) Ed. Fischer.--This species is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 212, made from plants collected at Ithaca. The\r\nplants are from 15--22 cm. high, the cap about 5 cm. in diameter, and\r\nthe stem 2--3 cm. in thickness. According to Burt (Bot. Gaz. =22=: 387,\r\n1896) it is a common species in the Eastern United States. The cap is\r\nmore or less bell-shaped and the sculptured surface is marked in a\r\nbeautiful manner with the reticulations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 83, FIGURE 212.--Dictyophora duplicata. White\r\n(natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 84, FIGURE 213.--Dictyophora ravenelii.

Sections of eggs, and\r\nshowing cords of mycelium (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Dictyophora ravenelii= (B. & C.) Burt.--This plant also has a wide\r\ndistribution in the Eastern United States. The stem is more slender than\r\nin the other species, _D. duplicata_, the pileus more nearly conic, and\r\nthe surface of the pileus is merely granular or minutely wrinkled after\r\nthe disappearance of the gleba, and does not present the strong\r\nreticulating ridges and crests which that species shows. The plants are\r\nfrom 10 to 18 cm. high. It grows in woods and fields about rotting wood,\r\nand in sawdust. The veil is very thin and delicate, forming simply a\r\nmembrane, and does not possess the coarse meshes present in the veil of\r\n_D. duplicata_. The Figs. 214, 215 represent the different stages in the\r\nelongation of the receptacle of this plant, and the rupture of the\r\nvolva. This elongation takes place quite rapidly. While photographing\r\nthe plant as it was bursting through the volva, I had considerable\r\ndifficulty in getting a picture, since the stem elongated so rapidly\r\nthat the plant would show that it had moved perceptibly, and the picture\r\nwould be blurred.\r\n\r\nIn a woods near Ithaca a large number of these plants have appeared from\r\nyear to year in a pile of sawdust. One of the most vile smelling plants\r\nof this family is the _Ithyphallus impudicus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMORELS, CUP-FUNGI, HELVELLAS, ETC.: DISCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining fungi to be considered belong to a very different group of\r\nplants than do the mushrooms, puff-balls, etc. Nevertheless, because of\r\nthe size of several of the species and the fact that several of them are\r\nexcellent for food, some attention will be given to a few. The entire\r\ngroup is sometimes spoken of as _Discomycetes_ or _cup-fungi_, because\r\nmany of the plants belonging here are shaped something like a disk, or\r\nlike a cup. The principal way in which they differ from the mushrooms,\r\nthe puff-balls, etc., is found in the manner in which the spores are\r\nborne. In the mushrooms, etc., the spores, we recollect, are borne on\r\nthe end of a club-shaped body, usually four spores on one of these. In\r\nthis group, however, the spores are borne inside of club-shaped bodies,\r\ncalled sacs or asci (singular, ascus). These sacs, or asci, are grouped\r\ntogether, lying side by side, forming the fruiting surface or hymenium,\r\nmuch as the basidia form the fruiting surface in the mushrooms. In the\r\ncase of the cup or disk forms, the upper side of the disk, or the upper\r\nand inner surface of the cap, is covered with these sacs, standing side\r\nby side, so that the free ends of the sacs form the outer surface. In\r\nthe case of the morel the entire outer surface of the upper portion of\r\nthe plant, that where there are so many pits, is covered with similar\r\nsacs. Since so few of the genera and species of the morels and cup-fungi\r\nwill be treated of here, I shall not attempt to compare the genera or\r\neven to give the characters by which the genera are known. In most\r\ncases the illustrations will serve this purpose so far as it is\r\ndesirable to accomplish it in such a work as the present. Certain of the\r\nspecies will then be described and illustrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 85, FIGURE 216.--Morchella esculenta (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMORCHELLA Dill.\r\n\r\nThe morels are all edible and they are usually easy to recognize. The\r\nplant consists of two distinct, prominent parts, the cap and the stem.\r\nThe cap varies in form from rounded, ovate, conic or cylindrical, or\r\nbell-shaped, but it is always marked by rather broad pits, covering the\r\nentire outer surface, which are separated from each other by ridges\r\nforming a network. The color of the plants does not differ to any\r\nperceptible extent in our species. The cap is usually buff or light\r\nochre yellow, becoming darker with age and in drying.\r\n\r\nThe stem in all our species is usually quite stout, though it varies to\r\nsome extent in some of the different species, in proportion to the\r\nthickness of the cap. The stem is marked in some of the species by large\r\nwrinkles or folds extending irregularly but with considerable uniformity\r\nover the surface. The surface is further minutely roughened by whitish\r\nor grayish elevations, giving it a granular appearance. Sometimes these\r\ngranules are quite evenly distributed over the surface, and in some\r\nspecies they are more or less separated into small areas by narrow\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe morels appear early in the season, during May and June. They grow\r\nusually in damp situations, and are more abundant during rainy weather.\r\nThree species are illustrated here.\r\n\r\n=Morchella esculenta= Pers. =Edible.=--The name of this species, the\r\nesculent morel, indicates that it has been long known as an edible\r\nplant, especially since the man who named it lived a century ago. The\r\nplant is from 5--15 cm. high, the stem is 1--3 cm. in thickness, and the\r\ncap is broader than the stem. The cap is somewhat longer than broad, and\r\nis more or less oval or rounded in outline. The arrangement of the pits\r\non the surface of the cap is regarded by some as being characteristic of\r\ncertain species. In this species the pits are irregularly arranged, so\r\nthat they do not form rows, and so that the ridges separating them do\r\nnot run longitudinally from the base toward the apex of the cap, but run\r\nquite irregularly. This arrangement can be seen in Fig. 216, which is\r\nfrom a photograph of this species. The stem is hollow.\r\n\r\n=Morchella conica= Pers. =Edible.=--This species is very closely related\r\nto the preceding one, and is considered by some to be only a form of the\r\n_Morchella esculenta_. The size is about the same, the only difference\r\nbeing in the somewhat longer cap and especially in the arrangement of\r\nthe pits. These are arranged more or less in distinct rows, so that the\r\nridges separating them run longitudinally and parallel from the base of\r\nthe cap to the apex, with connecting ridges extending across between the\r\npits. The cap is also more or less conic, but not necessarily so. Figure\r\n217 illustrates this species. The plant shown here is branched, and this\r\nshould not be taken to be a character of the species, for it is not,\r\nthis form being rather rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 217.--Morchella conica (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 86, FIGURE 218.--Morchella crassipes (natural\r\nsize). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Morchella crassipes= (Vent.) Pers. =Edible.=--This species differs from\r\nthe two preceding in the fact that the stem is nearly equal in width\r\nwith the cap. Figure 218 illustrates a handsome specimen which was 17\r\ncm. high. The granular surface and the folds of the stem show very\r\ndistinctly and beautifully. Collected at Ithaca.\r\n\r\n=Morchella deliciosa= Fr. =Edible=, has the cap cylindrical or nearly\r\nso. It is longer than the stem, and is usually two or three times as\r\nlong as it is broad. The plant is smaller than the preceding, though\r\nlarge ones may equal in size small ones of those two. The plant is from\r\n4--8 cm. high.\r\n\r\n=Morchella semilibera= DC., and =M. bispora= Sor., [_Verpa bohemica_\r\n(Kromb.) Schroet.] occur in this country, and are interesting from the\r\nfact that the cap is bell-shaped, the lower margin being free from the\r\nstem. In the latter species there are only two spores in an ascus.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELVELLA L.\r\n\r\nThe helvellas are pretty and attractive plants. They are smaller than\r\nthe morels, usually. They have a cap and stem, the cap being very\r\nirregular in shape, often somewhat lobed or saddle-shaped. It is smooth,\r\nor nearly so, at least it is not marked by the large pits present in the\r\ncap of the morel, and this is one of the principal distinguishing\r\nfeatures of the helvellas as compared with the morels. In one species\r\nthe thin cap has its lower margin free from the stem. This is =Helvella\r\ncrispa= Fr., and it has a white or whitish cap, and a deeply furrowed\r\nstem. It occurs in woods during the summer and autumn, and is known as\r\nthe white helvella.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 219.--Helvella lacunosa (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\nAnother species which has a wide range is the =Helvella lacunosa=, so\r\ncalled because of the deep longitudinal grooves in the stem. The cap is\r\nthin, but differs from the _H. crispa_ in that the lower margin is\r\nconnected with the stem. This species is illustrated in Fig. 219 from\r\nplants collected at Blowing Rock, N. C., during September, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Gyromitra_ is very closely related to _Helvella_, and is only\r\ndistinguished by the fact that the cap is marked by prominent folds and\r\nconvolutions, resembling somewhat the convolutions of the brain. Its\r\nname means _convoluted cap_. The =Gyromitra esculenta= Fr., is from\r\n5--10 cm. high, and the cap from 5--7 cm. broad. While this species has\r\nlong been reported as an edible one, and has been employed in many\r\ninstances as food with no evil results, there are known cases where it\r\nhas acted as a poison. In many cases where poisoning has resulted the\r\nplants were quite old and probably in the incipient stages of decay.\r\nHowever, it is claimed that a poisonous principle, called _helvellic\r\nacid_, has been isolated by a certain chemist, which acts as a violent\r\npoison. This principle is very soluble in hot water, and when care is\r\nused to drain off first water in which they have been cooked, squeezing\r\nthe water well from the plants, they are pronounced harmless. The safer\r\nway would be to avoid such suspicious species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 220.--Spathularia velutipes (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n=Spathularia velutipes= Cooke & Farlow.--This species represents another\r\ninteresting genus of the _Discomycetes_. It is in the form of a\r\n\"spatula,\" and from this shape of the plant the genus takes its name.\r\nThere are several species known in this country, and this one is quite\r\ncommon. The stem extends the entire length of the plant, running right\r\nthrough the cap, or perhaps it would be better to say that the cap or\r\nfruiting portion forms two narrow blades or wings on opposite sides of\r\nthe upper part of the stem. These wing-like expansions of the cap on the\r\nopposite sides of the stem give the spathulate form to the plant. Figure\r\n220 is from plants collected in the woods near Ithaca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 221.--Leotia lubrica (natural size). Copyright.]\r\n\r\n=Leotia lubrica= Pers.--The genus _Leotia_ is quite readily recognized\r\nby its form, and because the plants are usually slimy. This species is\r\ncalled _lubrica_ because of the slippery character of the entire plant.\r\nIt is dull yellowish or olive yellow in color. The cap, as can be seen\r\nfrom the figure (221), is irregularly rounded, and broader than the\r\nstem. The plant is illustrated natural size from specimens collected\r\nnear Ithaca.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE CUP-FUNGI.\r\n\r\nBy far the larger number of the _Discomycetes_ are cup-shaped, and are\r\npopularly called \"cup-fungi.\" They vary from plants of very minute size,\r\nso small that they can be just seen with the eye, or some of the larger\r\nones are several inches in breadth. They grow on the ground, on leaves,\r\nwood, etc. The variety of form and color is great. They may be sessile,\r\nthat is, the cup rests immediately on the ground or wood, or leaves, or\r\nthey may possess a short, or rather long stalk. The only species\r\nillustrated here has a comparatively long stalk, and the cap is deep\r\ncup-shaped, almost like a beaker. This plant is technically known as\r\n_Sarcoscypha floccosa_. It is represented here natural size (Fig. 222).\r\nThe stem is slender, and the rim of the cup is beset with long, strigose\r\nhairs. The inner surface of the cup is lined with the sacs (asci) and\r\nsterile threads (paraphyses), spoken of on a former page, when treating\r\nof the fruiting character of the morels and cup-fungi. In this plant the\r\ncolor of the inside of the cup is very beautiful, being a bright red.\r\nAnother species, _Sarcoscypha coccinea_, the scarlet sarcoscypha, is a\r\nlarger plant which appears in very early spring, soon after the frost is\r\nout of the ground. It grows on rotting logs and wood in the woods or in\r\ngroves. The inside of the cup in this species is a rich scarlet, and\r\nfrom this rich color the species takes its name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 222.--Sarcoscypha floccosa (natural size).\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FLESHY FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the collection of the higher fungi it is of the utmost importance\r\nthat certain precautions be employed in obtaining all parts of the\r\nplant, and furthermore that care be exercised in handling, in order not\r\nto remove or efface delicate characters. Not only is it important for\r\nthe beginner, but in many instances an \"expert\" may not be able to\r\ndetermine a specimen which may have lost what undoubtedly seem, to some,\r\ntrivial marks. The suggestions given here should enable one to collect\r\nspecimens in such a way as to protect these characters while fresh, to\r\nmake notes of the important evanescent characters and to dry and\r\npreserve them properly for future study. For collecting a number of\r\nspecimens under a variety of conditions the following list of\r\n\"apparatus\" is recommended:\r\n\r\nOne or two oblong or rectangular hand baskets, capacity from 8--12\r\nquarts.\r\n\r\nOr a rectangular zinc case with a closely fitting top (not the ordinary\r\nbotanical collecting case).\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen or so tall pasteboard boxes, or tins, 3 × 3, or 4 × 4, × 5\r\ninches deep, to hold certain species in an upright position.\r\n\r\nA quantity of tissue paper cut 8 × 10 or 6 × 8 inches.\r\n\r\nSmaller quantity of waxed tissue paper for wrapping viscid or sticky\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nTrowel; a stout knife; memorandum pad and pencil.\r\n\r\n=Collecting.=--During the proper season, and when rains are abundant,\r\nthe mushrooms are to be found in open fields, waste places, groves and\r\nwoods. They are usually more abundant in the forests. Especially in dry\r\nweather are specimens more numerous in rather damp woods, along ravines\r\nor streams. In collecting specimens which grow on the ground the trowel\r\nshould be used to dig up the plant carefully, to be sure that no\r\nimportant part of the plant is left in the ground. After one has become\r\nfamiliar with the habit of the different kinds the trowel will not be\r\nnecessary in all cases. For example, most species of _Russula_,\r\n_Lactarius_, _Tricholoma_, _Boletus_, etc., are not deeply seated in the\r\nsoil, and careful hand-picking will in most cases secure specimens\r\nproperly, especially if one does not object to digging in the soil with\r\nthe fingers. But in the case of most species of _Amanita_, certain\r\nspecies of _Lepiota_, _Collybia_, etc., a trowel is necessary to get up\r\nthe base of the plant in such a way as to preserve essential characters.\r\nEven then it is possible, if the ground is not too hard, to dig them out\r\nwith the fingers, or with a stout knife, but I have often found\r\nspecimens which could only be taken up with a trowel or spade.\r\n\r\nSpecies growing on sticks or leaves are easily collected by taking a\r\nportion of the substratum on which they grow. Specimens on the larger\r\nlimbs or trunks or stumps can sometimes be \"picked,\" but until one is\r\naccustomed to certain individualities of the plant it is well to employ\r\nthe knife and to cut off a portion of the wood if necessary, to avoid\r\ncutting off the base of the stem.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also to handle the specimens with the greatest care to\r\navoid leaving finger marks where the surface of the stem or cap is\r\ncovered with a soft and delicate outer coat, especially if one wishes to\r\nphotograph the plant, since rubbed or marked places spoil the plant for\r\nthis purpose. Also a little careless handling will remove such important\r\ncharacters as a frail annulus or volva, which often are absolutely\r\nnecessary to recognize the species.\r\n\r\nHaving collected the specimens, they should be properly placed in the\r\nbasket or collecting case. Those which are quite firm, and not long and\r\nslender, can be wrapped with tissue paper (waxed tissue paper if they\r\nare viscid or sticky), and placed directly in the basket, with some note\r\nor number to indicate habitat or other peculiarity which it is desirable\r\nto make at the time of collection. The smaller, more slender and\r\nfragile, specimens can be wrapped in tissue paper (a cluster of several\r\nindividuals can be frequently rolled up together) made in the form of a\r\nnarrow funnel and the ends then twisted. The shape of the paper enables\r\none to wrap them in such a way as to protect certain delicate characters\r\non the stem or cap. These can then be stood upright in the small\r\npasteboard boxes which should occupy a portion of the basket. A number\r\nof such wrappers can be placed in a single box, unless the specimens are\r\nof considerable size and numerous. In these boxes they are prevented\r\nfrom being crushed by the jostling of the larger specimens in the\r\nbasket. These boxes have the additional advantage of preserving certain\r\nspecimens entire and upright if one wishes later to photograph them.\r\n\r\n=Field Notes.=--The field notes which may be taken upon the collection\r\nwill depend on circumstances. If one goes to the sorting room soon after\r\nthe collection is made, so that notes can be made there before the more\r\ndelicate specimens dry, few notes will answer in the field, and usually\r\none is so busy collecting or hunting for specimens there is not much\r\ninclination to make extended notes in the field. But it is quite\r\nimportant to note the _habitat_ and _environment_, i. e., the place\r\nwhere they grow, the kind and character of the soil, in open field,\r\nroadside, grove, woods, on ground, leaves, sticks, stumps, trunks,\r\nrotting wood, or on living tree, etc. It is very important also that\r\ndifferent kinds be kept separate. The student will recognize the\r\nimportance of this and other suggestions much more than the new \"fungus\r\nhunter.\"\r\n\r\n=Sorting Room.=--When one returns from a collecting trip it is best to\r\ntake the plants as soon as possible to a room where they can be\r\nassorted. An hour or so delay usually does not matter, but the sooner\r\nthey are attended to the better. Sometimes when they are carefully\r\nplaced in the basket, as described above, they may be kept over night\r\nwithout injury, but this will depend on the _kinds_ in the collection.\r\n_Coprini_ are apt to deliquesce, certain other specimens, especially in\r\nwarm weather, are apt to be so infested with larvæ that they will be\r\nruined by morning, when immediate drying might save them. Other thin and\r\ndelicate ones, especially in dry weather, will dry out so completely\r\nthat one loses the opportunity of taking notes on the fresh specimen.\r\nSpecimens to be photographed should be attended to at once, unless it is\r\ntoo late in the day, when they should be set aside in an upright\r\nposition, and if necessary under a bell-jar, until the following day. As\r\nfar as possible good specimens should be selected for the photograph,\r\nrepresenting different stages of development, and one to show the\r\nfruiting surface. Sometimes it will be necessary to make more than one\r\nphotograph to obtain all the stages. Also on different days one is apt\r\nto obtain a specimen representing an important stage in development not\r\nrepresented before. The plants should be arranged close together to\r\neconomize space, but not usually touching nor too crowded. They should\r\nbe placed in their natural position as far as possible, and means for\r\nsupport, if used, should be hidden behind the plant. They should be so\r\narranged as to show individual as well as specific character and should\r\nbe photographed if possible natural size, or at least not on a plate\r\nsmaller than 5 × 7 inches unless the plants are small; while larger ones\r\nare better on 6 × 8 or larger. Some very small ones it may be necessary\r\nto enlarge in order to show the character of the fruiting surface, and\r\neven large specimens can sometimes have a portion of the hymenium\r\nenlarged to good advantage if it is desirable to show the characters\r\nclearly. The background should be selected to bring out the characters\r\nstrongly, and in the exposure and developing it is often necessary to\r\ndisregard the effect of the background in order to bring out the detail\r\nof texture on the plant itself. The background should be renewed as\r\noften as necessary to have it uniform and neat. There is much more that\r\nmight be said under this head, but there is not space here.\r\n\r\n=To Obtain Spore Prints.=--In many cases it is desirable to obtain\r\nspores in a mass on paper in order to know the exact tint of color\r\nproduced by the species. Often the color of the spores can be\r\nsatisfactorily determined by an examination of them under the\r\nmicroscope. One cannot always depend on the color of the lamellæ since a\r\nnumber of the species possess colored cystidia or spines in the hymenium\r\nwhich disguise the color of the spores. The best way to determine the\r\ncolor of the spores in mass is to catch them as they fall from the\r\nfruiting surface on paper. For the ordinary purpose of study and\r\nreference in the herbarium the spores caught on unprepared paper, which\r\nlater may be placed in the packet with the specimen, will answer. This\r\nmethod has the advantage of saving time, and also the danger of injury\r\nto the spores from some of the fixatives on prepared paper is avoided.\r\nIf for purposes of illustration one wishes pretty spore prints, perfect\r\ncaps must be cut from the stem and placed fruiting surface downward on\r\npaper prepared with some gum arable or similar preparation spread over\r\nit, while the paper is still moist with the fixative, and then the\r\nspecimen must be covered with a bell-jar or other receiver to prevent\r\neven the slightest draft of air, otherwise the spores will float around\r\nmore or less. The spores may be caught on a thin, absorbent paper, and\r\nthe paper then be floated on the fixative in a shallow vessel until it\r\nsoaks through and comes in contact with the spores. I have sometimes\r\nused white of egg as a fixative. These pieces of paper can then be cut\r\nout and either glued to card-boards, or onto the herbarium sheet.\r\n\r\n=Sorting the Plants.=--This should be done as soon as possible after\r\ncollection. A large table in the sorting room is convenient, upon which\r\nthe specimens may be spread, or grouped rather, by species, the\r\nindividuals of a species together, on sheets of paper. Surplus dirt, or\r\nwood, leaves, etc., can be removed. A few of the specimens can be turned\r\nso that spores can be caught on the papers. If only one or a few\r\nspecimens of a given species have been found, and it is desirable not to\r\ncut off the cap from the stem, the plant can be supported in an upright\r\nposition, a small piece of paper slit at one side can be slipped around\r\nthe stem underneath the cap, on which the spores will fall. Sometimes it\r\nwill be necessary to cover the plant with a bell-jar in order to prevent\r\nit from drying before the spores are shed. Experience with different\r\nspecies will suggest the treatment necessary.\r\n\r\n=Taking Notes on the Specimens.=--Very few probably realize the\r\ndesirability of making notes of certain characters while the plants are\r\nfresh, for future reference, or for use by those to whom the plants may\r\nbe sent for determination. It is some trouble to do this, and when the\r\ndifferent kinds are plentiful the temptation is strong to neglect it.\r\nWhen one has available books for determination of the species, as many\r\nas possible should be studied and determined while fresh. But it is not\r\nalways possible to satisfactorily determine all. Some may be too\r\ndifficult for ready recognition, others may not be described in the\r\nbooks at hand, or poorly so, and further the number of kinds may be too\r\ngreat for determination before they will spoil. On these as well as on\r\nsome of the interesting ones recognized, it is important to make a\r\nrecord of certain characters. These notes should be kept either with the\r\nspecimen, or a number should be given the specimen and the notes kept\r\nseparately with the corresponding number.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA.\r\n\r\n=No.=____. Locality, Date. Name of collector.\r\n\r\n=Weather.=\r\n\r\n=Habitat.=--If on ground, low or high, wet or dry, kind of soil; on\r\nfallen leaves, twigs, branches, logs, stumps, roots, whether dead or\r\nliving, kind of tree; in open fields, pastures, etc., woods, groves,\r\netc., mixed woods or evergreen, oak, chestnut, etc.\r\n\r\n=Plants.=--Whether solitary, clustered, tufted, whether rooting or not,\r\ntaste, odor, color when bruised or cut, and if a change in color takes\r\nplace after exposure to the air.\r\n\r\n=Cap.=--Whether dry, moist, watery in appearance (hygrophanous), slimy,\r\nviscid, glutinous; color when young, when old; whether with fine bloom,\r\npowder; kind of scales and arrangement, whether free from the cuticle\r\nand easily rubbed off. Shape of cap.\r\n\r\n=Margin of Cap.=--Whether straight or incurved when young, whether\r\nstriate or not when moist.\r\n\r\n=Stem.=--Whether slimy, viscid, glutinous, kind of scales if not smooth,\r\nwhether striate, dotted, granular, color; when there are several\r\nspecimens test one to see if it is easily broken out from the cap, also\r\nto see if it is fibrous, or fleshy, or cartilaginous (firm on the\r\noutside, partly snapping and partly tough). Shape of the stem.\r\n\r\n=Gills or Tubes.=--Color when young, old, color when bruised, and if\r\ncolor changes, whether soft, waxy, brittle, or tough; sharp or blunt,\r\nplane or serrate edge.\r\n\r\n=Milk.=--Color if present, changing after exposure, taste.\r\n\r\n=Veil.=--(Inner veil.) Whether present or not, character, whether\r\narachnoid, and if so whether free from cuticle of pileus or attached\r\nonly to the edge; whether fragile, persistent, disappearing, slimy,\r\netc., movable, etc.\r\n\r\n=Ring.=--Present or absent, fragile, or persistent, whether movable,\r\nviscid, etc.\r\n\r\n=Volva.=--Present or absent, persistent or disappearing, whether it\r\nsplits at apex or is circumscissile, or all crumbly and granular or\r\nfloccose, whether the part on the pileus forms warts, and then the kind,\r\ndistribution, shape, persistence, etc.\r\n\r\n=Spores.=--Color when caught on white paper.\r\n\r\nTo the close observer additional points of interest will often be noted.\r\n\r\n=To Dry the Specimens.=--Frequently the smaller specimens will dry well\r\nwhen left in the room, especially in dry weather, or better if they are\r\nplaced where there is a draft of air. Some dry them in the sun. But\r\noften the sun is not shining, and the weather may be rainy or the air\r\nvery humid, when it is impossible to dry the specimens properly except\r\nby artificial heat. The latter method is better for the larger specimens\r\nat all times. During the autumn when radiators are heated the fungi dry\r\nwell when placed on or over them. One of the best places which I have\r\nutilized is the brick work around a boiler connected with a mountain\r\nhotel. Two other methods are, however, capable of wider application.\r\n\r\n1st.--A tin oven about 2 × 2 feet, and two or several feet high, with\r\none side hinged as a door, and with several movable shelves of\r\nperforated tin, or of wire netting; a vent at the top, and perforations\r\naround the sides at the bottom to admit air. The object being to provide\r\nfor a constant current of air from below upwards between the specimens.\r\nThis may be heated, if not too large, with a lamp, though an oil stove\r\nor gas jet or heater is better. The specimens are placed on the shelves\r\nwith the accompanying notes or numbers. The height of this box can be\r\nextended where the number of specimens is great.\r\n\r\n2d.--A very successful method which I employed at a summer resort at\r\nBlowing Rock, N. C., in the mountains of North Carolina, during\r\nSeptember, 1899, was as follows: An old cook stove was set up in an\r\nunoccupied cottage, with two wire screens from 3 × 4 feet, one above the\r\nother, the lower one about one foot above the top of the stove. Large\r\nnumbers can be dried on these frames. Care of course must be taken that\r\nthe plants are not burned. In all cases the plants must be so placed\r\nthat air will circulate under and around them, otherwise they are apt to\r\nblacken.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are dry they are very brittle and must be handled\r\ncarefully. When removed from the drier many kinds soon absorb enough\r\nmoisture to become pliant so that they are not easily broken. Others\r\nremain brittle. They may be put away in small boxes; or pressed out\r\nnearly flat, _not so as to crush the gills_, and then put in paper\r\npackets. The plants which do not absorb sufficient moisture from the\r\nair, so that they are pliant enough to press, can be placed in small\r\nboxes or on paper in a large box with peat moss in the bottom, and the\r\nbox then closed tightly until they absorb enough moisture to become\r\nflexible. The plants must not get wet, and they should be examined every\r\nhalf hour or so, for some become limp much sooner than others. If the\r\nplants get too moist the gills crush together when pressed, and\r\notherwise they do not make such good specimens. When the specimens are\r\ndried and placed in the herbarium they must be protected from insects.\r\nSome are already infested with insects which the process of drying does\r\nnot kill. They must be either poisoned with corrosive sublimate in\r\nalcohol, or fumigated with carbon disulphide, and if the latter it must\r\nbe repeated one or two times at an interval of a month to catch those\r\nwhich were in the egg state the first time. When placed in the herbarium\r\nor in a box for storage, naphtha balls can be placed with them to keep\r\nout insects, but it should be understood that the naphtha balls will not\r\nkill or drive away insects already in the specimens. Where there are\r\nenough duplicates, some specimens preserved in 75 per cent. alcohol,\r\nunder the same number, are of value for the study of structural\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND PREPARATION OF MUSHROOMS FOR THE TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the selection of mushrooms to eat, great caution should be employed\r\nby those who are not reasonably familiar with the means of determination\r\nof the species, or those who have not an intimate acquaintance with\r\ncertain forms. Rarely should the beginner be encouraged to eat them upon\r\nhis own determination. It is best at first to consult some one who\r\nknows, or to send first specimens away for determination, though in many\r\ncases a careful comparison of the plant with the figures and\r\ndescriptions given in this book will enable a novice to recognize it. In\r\ntaking up a species for the first time it would be well to experiment\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\n=No Certain Rule to Distinguish the Poisonous from the Edible.=--There\r\nis no certain test, like the \"silver spoon test,\" which will enable one\r\nto tell the poisonous mushroom from the edible ones. Nor is the presence\r\nof the so-called \"death cup\" a sure sign that the fungus is poisonous,\r\nfor the _Amanita cæsarea_ has this cup. For the beginner, however, there\r\nare certain general rules, which, if carefully followed, will enable him\r\nto avoid the poisonous ones, while at the same time necessarily\r\nexcluding many edible ones.\r\n\r\n=1st.=--Reject all fungi which have begun to decay, or which are\r\ninfested with larvæ.\r\n\r\n=2d.=--Reject all fungi when in the button stage, since the characters\r\nare not yet shown which enable one to distinguish the genera and\r\nspecies. Buttons in pasture lands which are at the surface of the\r\nground and not deep-seated in the soil, would very likely not belong to\r\nany of the very poisonous kinds.\r\n\r\n=3d.=--Reject all fungi which have a cup or sac-like envelope at the\r\nbase of the stem, or which have a scaly or closely fitting layer at the\r\nbase of the stem, and rather loose warts on the pileus, especially if\r\nthe gills are white. _Amanita cæsarea_ has a sac-like envelope at the\r\nbase of the stem, and yellow gills as well as a yellow cap, and is\r\nedible. _Amanita rubescens_ has remnants of a scaly envelope on the base\r\nof the stem and loose warts on the cap, and the flesh where wounded\r\nbecomes reddish. It is edible. (See plate 19.)\r\n\r\n=4th.=--Reject all fungi with a milky juice unless the juice is reddish.\r\nSeveral species with copious white milk, sweet or mild to the taste, are\r\nedible (see _Lactarius volemus_ and _corrugis_).\r\n\r\n=5th.=--Reject very brittle fungi with gills nearly all of equal length,\r\nwhere the flesh of the cap is thin, especially those with bright caps.\r\n\r\n=6th.=--Reject all Boleti in which the flesh changes color where bruised\r\nor cut, or those in which the tubes have reddish mouths, also those the\r\ntaste of which is bitter. _Strobilomyces strobilaceus_ changes color\r\nwhen cut, and is edible.\r\n\r\n=7th.=--Reject fungi which have a cobwebby veil or ring when young, and\r\nthose with slimy caps and clay-colored spores.\r\n\r\nIn addition, proceed cautiously in all cases, and make it a point to\r\nbecome very familiar with a few species first, and gradually extend the\r\nrange of species, rather than attempt the first season to eat a large\r\nnumber of different kinds.\r\n\r\nAll puff-balls are edible so long as they are white inside, though some\r\nare better than others. All coral-like or club fungi are edible.\r\n\r\n=To Clean and Prepare the Specimens.=--The mushrooms having been\r\ncollected, all tough stems, the parts to which earth clings, should be\r\nremoved. After the specimens are selected, if there is danger that some\r\nof them may be infested with larvæ, it is well to cut off the stem close\r\nto the cap, for if the insects are in the stem and have not yet reached\r\nthe cap they may thus be cast away. Some recommend that the tubes of all\r\nBoleti be removed, since they are apt to make a slimy mass in cooking.\r\n\r\nWhere the plants are small they may be cooked entire. Large ones should\r\nbe quartered, or cut, or sliced, according to the size and form of the\r\nplant, or method of cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nUSES OF MUSHROOMS.[C]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most prominent and at present important use of mushrooms from the\r\nstandpoint of the utilitarian is as an article of food. We have now\r\nlearned that their food value as a nutrient substance is not so great as\r\nhas been fondly supposed, but, as Mr. Clark points out in Chapter XXII,\r\nin addition to the value they certainly do possess as food, they have\r\nvery great value as condiments or food accessories, and \"their value as\r\nsuch is beyond the computation of the chemist or physiologist. They are\r\namong the most appetizing of table delicacies, and add greatly to the\r\npalatability of many foods when cooked with them.\" Mushrooms undoubtedly\r\npossess a food value beyond that attributed to them by the chemist or\r\nphysiologist, since it is not possible in laboratory analysis to\r\nduplicate the conditions which exist in the natural digestion and\r\nassimilation of foods.\r\n\r\nProbably the larger number of persons, in America, at present interested\r\nin mushrooms, are chiefly concerned with them as an article of food, but\r\na great many of these persons love to tramp to the fields and woods in\r\nquest of them just as the sportsman loves to hunt his game with dog and\r\ngun. It is quite likely that there will always be a large body of\r\npersons who will maintain a lively interest in the collection of _game_\r\nmushrooms for food. There are several reasons for this. The zest of the\r\nsearch, the pleasure of discovery, and the healthfulness of the outdoor\r\nrecreation lend an appetizing flavor to the fruits of the chase not to\r\nbe obtained by purchasing a few pounds of cultivated mushrooms on the\r\nmarket. It cultivates powers of observation, and arouses a sympathetic\r\nfeeling toward nature, and with those outdoor environments of man which\r\nlend themselves so happily in bettering and brightening life, as well as\r\nin prolonging it.\r\n\r\nMany others are discovering that the observation of form and habits of\r\nmushrooms is a very interesting occupation for those who have short\r\nperiods of time at their disposal weekly. It requires but a little\r\nobservation to convince one that there is an interesting variety of form\r\namong these plants, that their growth and expansion operate in\r\nconformity with certain laws which result in great variation in form and\r\nhabit of the numerous kinds on the ground, on leaves, on branches, on\r\ntree trunks, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother very favorable indication accompanying the increasing interest\r\nin the study of these plants, is the recognition of their importance as\r\nobjects for nature study. There are many useful as well as interesting\r\nlessons taught by mushrooms to those who stop to read their stories. The\r\nlong growth period of the spawn in the ground, or in the tree trunk,\r\nwhere it may sometimes be imprisoned for years, sometimes a century, or\r\nmore, before the mushroom appears, is calculated to dispel the popular\r\nnotion that the mushroom \"grows in a night.\" Then from the button stage\r\nto the ripe fruit, several days, a week, a month, or a year may be\r\nneeded, according to the kind, while some fruiting forms are known to\r\nlive from several to eighty or more years. The adjustment of the fruit\r\ncap to a position most suitable for the scattering of the spores, the\r\ndifferent ways in which the fruit cap opens and expands, the different\r\nforms of the fruit surface, their colors and other peculiarities,\r\nsuggest topics for instructive study and observation. The inclination,\r\njust now becoming apparent, to extend nature study topics to include\r\nmushrooms is an evidence of a broader and more sympathetic attitude\r\ntoward nature.\r\n\r\nA little extension of one's observation on the habits of these plants in\r\nthe woods will reveal the fact that certain ones are serious enemies of\r\ntimber trees and timber. It is quite easy in many cases for one\r\npossessing no technical knowledge of the subject to read the story of\r\nthese \"wood destroying\" fungi in the living tree. Branches broken by\r\nsnow, by wind, or by falling timber provide entrance areas where the\r\nspores, lodging on the heart wood of broken timber, or on a bruise on\r\nthe side of the trunk which has broken through the living part of the\r\ntree lying just beneath the bark, provide a point for entrance. The\r\nliving substance (_protoplasm_) in the spawn exudes a \"juice\" (_enzyme_)\r\nwhich dissolves an opening in the wood cells and permits the spawn to\r\nenter the heart of the tree, where decay rapidly proceeds as a result.\r\nBut very few of these plants can enter the tree when the living part\r\nunderneath the bark is unbroken.\r\n\r\nThese observations suggest useful topics for thought. They suggest\r\npractical methods of prevention, careful forestry treatment and careful\r\nlumbering to protect the young growth when timber trees are felled. They\r\nsuggest careful pruning of fruit and shade trees, by cutting limbs\r\nsmooth and close to the trunk, and then painting the smooth surface with\r\nsome lead paint.\r\n\r\nWhile we are thus apt to regard many of the mushrooms as enemies of the\r\nforest, they are, at the same time, of incalculable use to the forest.\r\nThe mushrooms are nature's most active agents in the disposal of the\r\nforest's waste material. Forests that have developed without the\r\nguidance of man have been absolutely dependent upon them for their\r\ncontinued existence. Where the species of mushrooms are comparatively\r\nfew which attack living trees, there are hundreds of kinds ready to\r\nstrike into fallen timber. There is a degree of moisture present on the\r\nforest floor exactly suited to the rapid growth of the mycelium of\r\nnumbers of species in the bark, sap wood, and heart wood of the fallen\r\ntrees or shrubs. In a few years the branches begin to crumble because of\r\nthe disorganizing effect of the mycelium in the wood. Other species\r\nadapted to growing in rotting wood follow and bring about, in a few\r\nyears, the complete disintegration of the wood. It gradually passes into\r\nthe soil of the forest floor, and is made available food for the living\r\ntrees. How often one notices that seedling trees and shrubs start more\r\nabundantly on rotting logs.\r\n\r\nThe fallen leaves, too, are seized upon by the mycelium of a great\r\nvariety of mushrooms. It is through the action of the mycelium of\r\nmushrooms of every kind that the fallen forest leaves, as well as the\r\ntrunks and branches, are converted into food for the living trees. The\r\nfungi, are, therefore, one of the most important agents in providing\r\navailable food for the virgin forest.\r\n\r\nThe spawn of some fungi in the forest goes so far, in a number of cases,\r\nas to completely envelop those portions of the roots of certain trees as\r\nto prevent the possibility of the roots taking up food material and\r\nmoisture on their own account. In such cases, the oaks, beeches,\r\nhornbeams, and the like, have the younger parts of their roots\r\ncompletely enveloped with a dense coat of mycelium. The mycelium in\r\nthese cases absorbs the moisture from the soil or forest floor and\r\nconveys it over to the roots of the tree, and in this way supplies them\r\nwith both food and water from the decaying humus, the oak being thus\r\ndependent on the mycelium. In the fields, however, where there is not\r\nthe abundance of humus and decaying leaves present in the forest, the\r\ncoating of mycelium on the roots of these trees is absent, and in this\r\nlatter case the young roots are provided with root hairs which take up\r\nthe moisture and food substances from the soil in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nThe mushrooms also prevent the forest from becoming choked or strangled\r\nby its own fallen members. Were it not for the action of the mushroom\r\nmycelium in causing the decay of fallen timber in the forest, in time it\r\nwould be piled so high as to allow only a miserable existence to a few\r\nchoked individuals. The action of the mushrooms in thus disposing of the\r\nfallen timber in the forests, and in converting dead trees and fallen\r\nleaves into available food for the living ones, is probably the most\r\nimportant role in the existence of these plants. Mushrooms, then, are to\r\nbe given very high rank among the natural agencies which have\r\ncontributed to the good of the world. When we contemplate the vast areas\r\nof forest in the world we can gain some idea of the stupendous work\r\nperformed by the mushrooms in \"house cleaning,\" and in \"preparing food,\"\r\nwork in which they are still engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGI IN THE ARTS.\r\n\r\nA number of different species of mushrooms have been employed in the\r\nmanufacture of useful articles. Their use for such purposes, however,\r\nwas more common in the past than at present, and it is largely therefore\r\na matter of interest at the present time, though some are still employed\r\nfor purposes of this kind.\r\n\r\n=Tinder mushroom, or amadou.=--The _Polyporus fomentarius_, or \"tinder\r\nmushroom\" or, as it is sometimes called, \"German tinder,\" was once\r\nemployed in the manufacture of tinder. The outer hard coat was removed\r\nand the central portion, consisting almost entirely of the tube system\r\nof several years' growth, was cut into strips and beaten to a soft\r\ncondition. In this form it was used as tinder for striking fire.\r\n\r\nThe inner portion was also used in making caps, chest-protectors, and\r\nsimilar articles. A process now in vogue in some parts of Germany, is to\r\nsteam the fruit bodies, remove the outer crust, and then, by machinery\r\nconstructed for the purpose, shave the fruit body into a long, thin\r\nstrip by revolving it against a knife in much the same way that certain\r\nwoods are shaved into thin strips for the manufacture of baskets,\r\nplates, etc. Some articles of clothing made from this fungus material\r\nare worn by peasants in certain parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n=Mushrooms for razor strops.=--The beech polyporus (_P. betulinus_)\r\nseveral centuries ago was used for razor strops. The fruit body after\r\nbeing dried was cut into strips, glued upon a stretcher, and smoothed\r\ndown with pumice stone (Asa Gray Bull. 7: 18, 1900). The sheets of the\r\nweeping merulius (see Fig. 189) were also employed for the same purpose,\r\nas were also the sheets of \"punk\" formed from mycelium filling in\r\ncracks in old logs or between boards in lumber piles. Sometimes\r\nextensive sheets of this punk are found several feet long and a foot or\r\nmore wide. These sheets of pure mycelium resemble soft chamois skin or\r\nsoiled kid leather.\r\n\r\n=Mushrooms employed for flower pots.=--In Bohemia (according to Cooke,\r\nFungi, etc., p. 103) hoof-shaped fruit bodies of _Polyporus fomentarius_\r\nand _igniarius_ are used for flower pots. The inner, or tube portion, is\r\ncut out. The hoof-shaped portion, then inverted and fastened to the side\r\nof a building or place of support, serves as a receptacle for soil in\r\nwhich plants are grown.\r\n\r\n=Curios.=--The _Polyporus applanatus_ is much sought by some persons as\r\na \"curio,\" and also for the purpose of etching. In the latter case they\r\nserve as pastels for a variety of art purposes. The under surface of the\r\nplant is white. All collectors of this plant know that to preserve the\r\nwhite fruiting surface in a perfect condition it must be handled very\r\ncarefully. A touch or bruise, or contact with other objects mars the\r\nsurface, since a bruise or a scratch results in a rapid change in color\r\nof the injured surface. Beautiful etchings can thus be made with a fine\r\npointed instrument, the lines of color appearing as the instrument is\r\ndrawn over the surface.\r\n\r\n=Fungi for medicinal purposes.=--A number of the fungi were formerly\r\nemployed in medicine for various purposes, but most of them have been\r\ndiscarded. Some of the plants were once used as a purgative, as in the\r\ncase of the officinal polyporus, the great puff ball, etc. The internal\r\nportion of the great puff ball has been used as an anodyne, and\r\n\"formidable surgical operations have been performed under its\r\ninfluence.\" It is frequently used as a narcotic. Some species are\r\nemployed as drugs by the Chinese. The anthelmintic polyporus is employed\r\nin Burmah as a vermifuge. The ergot of rye is still employed to some\r\nextent in medicine, and the ripe puff balls are still used in some cases\r\nto stop bleeding of wounds.\r\n\r\n=Luminosity of fungi.=--While the luminosity possessed by certain fungi\r\ncannot be said to be of distinct utility, their phosphorescence is a\r\nnoteworthy phenomenon. That decaying wood often emits this\r\nphosphorescent light has been widely observed, especially in wooded\r\ndistricts. It is due to the presence of the mycelium of one of the wood\r\ndestroying fungi. The luminosity is often so bright that when brought\r\nnear a printed page in the dark, words can be read. Hawthorne \"reported\r\nthe light from an improvised torch of mycelium infected wood, to have\r\ncarried him safely several miles through an otherwise impassable\r\nforest.\" (Asa Gray, Bull. =7=: 7, 1900). The sulphur polyporus is said\r\nsometimes to be phosphorescent. The _Clitocybe illudens_ (see Fig. 92)\r\nhas long been known to emit a strong phosphorescent light, and has been\r\ncalled \"Jack-my-lantern.\" This plant often occurs in great abundance. At\r\nmountain hotels it is often brought in by day, and the guests at night,\r\ndiscovering its luminosity, trace grotesque figures, or monograms, on\r\nthe ground by broken portions, which can be seen at a considerable\r\ndistance. _Lentinus stipticus_ in this country is also phosphorescent.\r\nIn Europe, the _Pleurotus olearius_ (very closely related to our\r\n_Clitocybe illudens_) on dead olive trunks is one of the best known of\r\nthe phosphorescent species. Other phosphorescent species are, according\r\nto Tulasne, _A. igneus_ from Amboyna, _A. noctileucus_ in Manila, and\r\n_A. gardneri_ in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe use of certain mushrooms in making intoxicant beverages is referred\r\nto in Chapter XXII.\r\n\r\nSince the artificial cultivation of mushrooms for food is becoming quite\r\nan industry in this country with some, the following chapter is devoted\r\nto a treatment of the subject. Mention may be made here, however, of the\r\nattempts in parts of France to cultivate truffles, species of\r\nsubterranean fungi belonging to the ascomycetes (various species of the\r\ngenus _Tuber_). It had long been observed that truffles grow in regions\r\nforested by certain trees, as the oak, beech, hornbeam, etc. Efforts\r\nwere made to increase the production of truffles by planting certain\r\nregions to these trees. Especially in certain calcareous districts of\r\nFrance (see Cooke, Fungi, etc., p. 260) young plantations of oak, beech,\r\nor beech and fir, after the lapse of a few years, produced truffles. The\r\nspores of the truffles are in the soil, and the mycelium seems to\r\nmaintain some symbiotic relation with the roots of the young trees,\r\nwhich results in the increase in the production of the fruit bodies.\r\nDogs and pigs are employed in the collection of truffles from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nComparatively few of the truffles, or other subterranean fungi, have\r\nbeen found in America, owing probably to their subterranean habit, where\r\nthey are not readily observed, and to the necessity of special search to\r\nfind them. In California, however, Dr. Harkness (Proc. Calif. Acad.\r\nSci.) has collected a large number of species and genera. Recently\r\n(Shear. Asa Gray Bull. 7: 118, 1899) reports finding a \"truffle\"\r\n(_Terfezia oligosperma_ Tul.) in Maryland, and _T. leonis_ occurs in\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] There is not room here to discuss the uses of other fungi than the\r\n\"mushrooms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increasing interest in mushrooms during the past few years has not\r\nbeen confined to the kinds growing spontaneously in fields and woods,\r\nbut the interest aroused in the collection and study of the wild\r\nvarieties has been the means of awakening a general interest in the\r\ncultivation of mushrooms. This is leading many persons to inquire\r\nconcerning the methods of cultivation, especially those who wish to\r\nundertake the cultivation of these plants on a small scale, in cellars\r\nor cool basements, where they may be grown for their own consumption. At\r\nsomewhat frequent intervals articles appear in the newspapers depicting\r\nthe ease and certainty with which mushrooms can be grown, and the great\r\nprofits that accrue to the cultivator of these plants. While the profits\r\nin some cases, at least in the past, have been very great to cultivators\r\nof mushrooms, the competition has become so general that through a large\r\npart of the year the market price of mushrooms is often not sufficient\r\nto much more than pay expenses. In fact, it is quite likely that in many\r\ncases of the house cultivation of mushrooms the profits are no larger,\r\ntaking the season through, than they are from the cultivation of\r\ntomatoes or other hothouse vegetables. Occasionally some persons, who\r\nmay be cultivating them upon a small scale in houses erected for some\r\nother purpose, or perhaps partly used for some other purpose, may\r\nsucceed in growing quite a large crop from a small area with little\r\nexpenditure of time and money. The profits figured from such a crop\r\ngrown on a small scale where the investment in houses, heating\r\napparatus, and time, is not counted, may appear to be very large, but\r\nthey do not represent the true conditions of the industry where the\r\nexpense of houses and the cost of time and labor are taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nProbably the more profitable cultivation of mushrooms in this country is\r\nwhere the cultivation is practiced on quite a large scale, in tunnels,\r\nor caves, or abandoned mines, where no expense is necessary in the\r\nerection of houses. The temperature throughout the year is favorable for\r\nthe growth of the mushrooms without artificial heating. It is possible,\r\nalso, to grow them on a large scale during the warm summer months when\r\nit is impossible to grow them under the present conditions in heating\r\nhouse structures, and also when the market price of the mushrooms is\r\nvery high, and can be controlled largely by the grower. For this reason,\r\nif it were possible to construct a house with some practical system of\r\ncooling the air through the summer, and prevent the drip, the\r\ncultivation in houses would probably be more profitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 223.--View in Akron \"tunnel,\" N. Y. Mushroom Co.\r\nBeds beginning to bear. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nFor the past few years the writer has been giving some attention to the\r\ndifferent methods of the cultivation of mushrooms in America, and in\r\nresponse to the growing interest for information concerning the\r\nartificial cultivation of these plants, it has seemed well to add this\r\nchapter on the cultivation of mushrooms to the second edition of the\r\npresent work. The cultivation as practiced in America exists under a\r\ngreat variety of conditions. All of these conditions have not been\r\nthoroughly investigated, and yet a sufficient number of them have been\r\nrather carefully studied to warrant the preparation of this chapter. The\r\nillustrations which have been made from time to time, by flash light, of\r\nthe cave culture of mushrooms in America, as well as of the house\r\nculture, will serve to illustrate graphically some of the stages in the\r\nprogress of the work. For present purposes we will consider, first, the\r\nconditions under which the cultivation is carried on, followed by a\r\ndiscussion of the principles involved in the selection and preparation\r\nof the material, the selection and planting of the spawn, as well as the\r\nharvesting of the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVE CULTURE OF MUSHROOMS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 224.--View in Akron \"tunnel,\" N. Y. Mushroom Co.\r\nBeds beginning to bear. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThis has been practiced for a number of years in different parts of the\r\nEastern United States, but perhaps only a small portion of the available\r\ncaves or tunnels are at present used for this purpose. These\r\nsubterranean mushroom farms are usually established in some abandoned\r\nmine where, the rock having been removed, the space is readily adapted\r\nto this purpose, if portions of the mine are not wet from the dripping\r\nwater. The most extensive one which I have visited is located at Akron,\r\nNew York, and is operated by the New York Mushroom Company. In a single\r\nabandoned cement mine there are 12 to 15 acres of available space; about\r\n3 to 5 acres of this area are used in the operations of the culture and\r\nhandling of materials. The dry portions of the mine are selected, and\r\nflat beds are made upon the bottom rock, with the use of hemlock\r\nboards, making the beds usually 16 feet long by 4 feet wide, the boards\r\nbeing 10 inches wide. In this case, the beds, after soiling or\r\nfinishing, are 9 inches deep, the material resting directly upon the\r\nrock, the boards being used only to hold the material on the edges in\r\nposition. Figures 223 and 224 illustrate the position of the beds and\r\ntheir relation to each other, as well as showing the general structural\r\nfeatures of the mine. The pillars of rock are those which were left at\r\nthe time of mining, as supports for the rock roof above, while\r\nadditional wood props are used in places. In this mine all of the beds\r\nare constructed upon a single plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 225.--View in Wheatland cave, showing ridge beds,\r\nand one flat bed. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nAt another place, Wheatland, New York, where the Wheatland Cave\r\nMushrooms are grown, beds of two different styles are used, the flat\r\nbeds supported by boards as described in the previous case, and the\r\nridge beds, where the material, without any lateral support, is arranged\r\nin parallel ridges as shown in Fig. 225. This is the method largely, if\r\nnot wholly employed in the celebrated mushroom caves at Paris, and is\r\nalso used in some cases in the outdoor cultivation of mushrooms. As to\r\nthe advantage of one system of bed over the other, one must consider the\r\nconditions involved. Some believe a larger crop of mushrooms is obtained\r\nwhere there is an opportunity, as in the ridge beds, for the mushrooms\r\nto appear on the sides as well as on the upper surface of the beds. In\r\nthe flat beds the mushrooms can appear only at the upper surface,\r\nthough occasionally single ones crop out in the crevice between the side\r\nboard and the rock below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 226.--Single mushroom house (Wm. Swayne, Kennett\r\nSquare, Pa.), \"curing\" shed at left. This house is heated in connection\r\nwith other hothouses.]\r\n\r\nProbably at Paris, and perhaps also at some other places where the\r\nsystem of ridge beds is used, the question of the cost of the lumber is\r\nan important one, and the system of ridge beds avoids the expense of\r\nthis item of lumber. In other cases, where the flat beds are used with\r\nthe board supports, the cost of lumber is considered a small item when\r\ncompared with the additional labor involved in making the ridge bed. The\r\nflat beds are very quickly made, and the material in some cases is not\r\nmore than 7 inches deep, allowing a large surface area compared with the\r\namount of food material, for the growth of the mushrooms. It may be\r\npossible, with the flat, shallow bed system, that as many or more\r\nmushrooms are obtained from the same amount of manure, as in the case of\r\nthe ridge beds. When we consider the cost of the manure in some places,\r\nthis item is one which is well worth considering.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE CULTURE OF MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nWhere this method of cultivation is employed, as the main issue, houses\r\nare constructed especially for the purpose. In general the houses are of\r\ntwo kinds. Those which are largely above the ground, and those where a\r\ngreater or lesser pit is excavated so that the larger part of the house\r\nis below ground. Between these extremes all gradations exist. Probably\r\nit is easier to maintain an equable temperature when the house is\r\nlargely below ground. Where it is largely above ground, however, the\r\nequability of the temperature can be controlled to a certain extent by\r\nthe structure of the house. In some cases a wall air space is maintained\r\naround the sides and also over the roof of the building. And in some\r\ncases even a double air space of a foot or 18 inches each is maintained\r\nover the roof. In some cases, instead of an air space, the space is\r\nfilled with sawdust, single on the sides of the house, and also a 12 or\r\n18-inch space over the roof. The sides of the house are often banked\r\nwith earth, or the walls are built of stone or brick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 227.--Double mushroom house (L. S. Bigony's\r\nMushroom Plant.) Packing room at left, \"curing\" shed at right, next to\r\nthis is boiler room.]\r\n\r\nAll of these houses, no matter what the type of construction, require\r\nventilation. This is provided for by protected openings or exits through\r\nthe roof. In some cases the ventilators are along the side of the roof,\r\nwhen there would be two rows of ventilators upon the single gable roof.\r\nIn other cases a row of ventilators is placed at the peak, when a single\r\nrow answers. These ventilators are provided with shut-offs, so that the\r\nventilation can be controlled at will. The size of the house varies, of\r\ncourse, according to the extent of the operations which the grower has\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nThe usual type of house is long and rather narrow, varying from 50 to\r\n150 feet long by 18 to 21 or 24 feet wide. In some cases the single\r\nhouse is constructed upon these proportions, as shown by Fig. 226, with\r\na gable roof. If it is desired to double the capacity of a house, two\r\nsuch houses are built parallel, the intercepting wall supporting the\r\nadjacent roof of the two houses, as shown in Fig. 227. A still further\r\nincrease in the capacity of the house is often effected by increasing\r\nthe number of these houses side by side. This results in a series of 8\r\nor 10 houses forming one consolidated block of houses, each with its\r\nindependent ridge roof and system of ventilation. The separating walls\r\nbetween the several houses of such a block are probably maintained for\r\nthe purpose of better controlling the temperature conditions and\r\nventilation in various houses. If desired, communication from one house\r\nto another can be had by doors.\r\n\r\n=Interior structure and position of the beds.=--The beds are usually\r\narranged in tiers, one above the other, though in some houses the beds\r\nare confined only to the floor space. Where they are arranged in tiers\r\nin a house of the proportions given above, there are three tiers of\r\nbeds. There is one tier on either side, and a tier through the middle;\r\nthe middle tier, on account of the peak of the roof at this point, has\r\none more bed than the tiers on the side. The number of beds in a tier\r\nwill depend on the height of the house. Usually the house is constructed\r\nof a height which permits three beds in the side tier and four in the\r\ncenter tier, with an alley on either side of the center tier of beds,\r\ngiving communication to all. If the house is very long and it is\r\ndesirable, for convenience in passing from one house to another, to have\r\ncross alley-ways, they can be arranged, but the fewer cross alleys the\r\nlarger surface area there is for beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 228.--View in mushroom house (Wm. Swayne), showing\r\nupper bed in left hand tier. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe size of the beds is governed by convenience in making the beds and\r\nhandling the crop. The beds on the side tiers, therefore, are often\r\nthree to three and one-half feet in width, affording a convenient\r\nreaching distance from the alley. The beds of the center tier have\r\naccess from the alley on either side and are usually seven feet in\r\nwidth. The width of the alley varies according to the mind of the owner,\r\nfrom two to three or three and one-half feet. The narrow alley\r\neconomizes space in the structure of a house; the wide alley, while\r\nslightly increasing the cost of the structure, makes it much more\r\nconvenient in handling the material, and in moving about the house. The\r\nbeds are constructed of one-inch boards. Various kinds of lumber are\r\nused, the hemlock spruce, the oak, Georgia pine, and so on. The beds are\r\nsupported on framework constructed of upright scantling and cross\r\nstringers upon which the bottom boards are laid. These occur at\r\nintervals of three to four feet. The board on the side of each bed is 10\r\nto 12 inches in width. The bottom bed, of course, is made on the ground.\r\nThe upper beds in the tier are situated so that the distance is about\r\nthree feet from the bottom of one bed to the bottom of the next above.\r\nFigs. 228 to 231 show the general structure of the beds.\r\n\r\n=Heating.=--One portion of the house is set apart for the boiler room,\r\nwhere a small hot water heater is located. The position of the heater in\r\none of these houses is shown in Fig. 227. In other cases, where the\r\nplant is quite a large one, a small separate or connecting boiler\r\napartment is often constructed. In other cases, where the house is\r\nconnected with or adjoining a system of greenhouses devoted to hothouse\r\nvegetables, the water pipes may run from the general boiler house which\r\nsupplies the heat for all the houses. The water pipes in the mushroom\r\nhouses are sometimes run beneath the boards or the walk in the alley, or\r\nin other cases are run just beneath the roof of the building.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation of mushrooms under benches in greenhouses.=--This method is\r\npracticed to quite a large extent by some growers. In the house of Mr.\r\nWilliam Swayne, Kennett Square, Pa., a number of large houses, devoted\r\nthrough the winter to the growing of carnations, are also used for the\r\ncultivation of mushrooms, a single long bed being made up underneath the\r\nbeds of carnations. In these houses the water pipes providing heat for\r\nthe building run along the sides of the building underneath the\r\ncarnation beds at this point. Under these beds, where the water pipes\r\nrun, no mushroom beds are made, since the heat would be too great, but\r\nunder the three middle rows of beds in the house, mushroom beds are\r\nlocated. In this way, in a number of houses, several thousand square\r\nfeet of surface for mushroom beds can be obtained. The carnations are\r\ngrown, not in pots, but in a general bed on a bench. In watering the\r\ncarnations, care is used in the distribution of the water, and in the\r\namount used, to prevent a surplus of water dripping through on the\r\nmushrooms below.\r\n\r\n=Cellar culture.=--For the cultivation of mushrooms on a small scale,\r\nunoccupied portions of cellars in a dwelling house are often used. The\r\nquestion is sometimes asked if it is injurious to the health of the\r\nfamily in a dwelling house when mushrooms are grown in the cellar.\r\nProbably where the materials used in making up the beds are thoroughly\r\ncured before being taken into the cellar, no injurious results would\r\ncome from the cultivation of the plant there. In case the manure is\r\ncured in the cellar, that is, is there carried through the process of\r\nheating and fermentation in preparation for the beds, the odors arising\r\nfrom the fermenting material are very disagreeable to say the least, and\r\nprobably are not at all beneficial to one's general health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 229.--View in mushroom house (Wm. Swayne). View\r\ndown alley on right hand side. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nIn the cellar culture of mushrooms the places selected are along the\r\nsides of the cellar in unused portions. Floor beds alone may be made by\r\nusing the boards to support one side, while the wall forms the support\r\non the other side as in the arrangement of beds on the side tiers in the\r\nmushroom houses; or tiers of beds may be arranged in the same way, one\r\nbed on the bottom, and one or two beds above. The number of beds will\r\nvary according to the available space. Sometimes, where it is not\r\nconvenient to arrange the larger beds directly on the bottom of the\r\ncellar, or in tiers, boxes three or four feet, or larger, may be used in\r\nplace of the beds. These can be put in out of the way places in the\r\ncellar. The use of boxes of this description would be very convenient in\r\ncase it was desired to entirely do away with the possibility of odors\r\nduring the fermentation of the manure, or in the making up of the bed.\r\nEven though the manure may be cured outside of the cellar, at the time\r\nit is made in the beds the odors released are sometimes considerable,\r\nand for several days might be annoying and disagreeable to the occupants\r\nof the dwelling, until such a time as the temperature of the manure had\r\ndropped to the point where the odors no longer were perceptible. In this\r\ncase, with the use of boxes, the manure can be cured outside, made into\r\nbeds in the boxes and taken into the cellar after the temperature is\r\ndown to a point suitable for spawning, and very little odor will be\r\nreleased. If there is a furnace in the cellar it should be partitioned\r\noff from the portion devoted to mushroom culture.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation in sheds or out of the way places.=--It is possible to grow\r\nmushrooms in a number of places not used for other purposes. In sheds\r\nwhere the beds may be well protected from the rain and from changing\r\ncurrents of air, they may be grown. In open sheds the beds could be\r\ncovered with a board door, the sides of the bed being high enough to\r\nhold the door well above the mushrooms. In the basements of barns, or\r\neven in stables where room can be secured on one side for a bed, or tier\r\nof beds, they are often grown successfully.\r\n\r\n=Garden and field culture of mushrooms.=--In Europe, in some cases,\r\nmushrooms are often grown in the garden, ridge beds being made up in the\r\nspring and spawned, and then covered with litter, or with some material\r\nsimilar to burlaps, to prevent the complete drying out of the surface of\r\nthe beds. Sometimes they are cultivated along with garden crops. Field\r\nculture is also practiced to some extent. In the field culture rich and\r\nwell drained pastures are selected, and spawned sometime during the\r\nmonth of May. The portions of spawn are inserted in the ground in little\r\nT-shaped openings made by two strokes of the spade. The spade is set\r\ninto the ground once, lifted, and then inserted again so that this first\r\nslit is on one side of the middle of the spade and perpendicular to it.\r\nThe spade is inserted here and then bent backwards partly so as to lift\r\nopen the sod in the letter T. In this opening the block of spawn is\r\ninserted, then closed by pressure with the foot. The spawn is planted in\r\nthis way at distances of 6 to 8 feet. It runs through the summer, and\r\nthen in the autumn a good crop often appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING THE MANURE.\r\n\r\n=Selection of manure.=--Horse manure is the material which is most\r\ngenerally used, though sometimes a small percentage of other manures, as\r\nsheep manure, is added. In the selection of the manure it is desirable\r\nto obtain that which is as fresh as possible, which has not passed\r\nthrough the stage of fermentation, and which contains some straw,\r\nusually as litter, but not too large a percentage of straw. Where there\r\nis a very large percentage of straw the manure is usually shaken out\r\nwith a fork, and the coarser portion removed. If there is not too much\r\nof this coarse material the latter is often cured in a separate pile and\r\nused for the bottom of the beds, the finer portions of the manure, which\r\nhave been separated, are used for the finishing and for the bulk of the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 230.--View in mushroom house (L. S. Bigony). View\r\non top of fourth bed, middle tier. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nWhere manure is obtained on a large scale for the cultivation in houses\r\nor in caves, it is usually obtained by the carload from liveries in\r\nlarge cities. It is possible to contract for manure of certain livery\r\nstables so that it may be obtained in a practically fresh condition, and\r\nhandled by the liverymen according to directions, which will keep it in\r\nthe best possible condition for the purpose. In the cave culture of\r\nmushrooms the manure is usually taken directly into the caves, and cured\r\nin some portion of the cave. In the house cultivation of mushrooms there\r\nis usually a shed constructed with an opening on one or two sides, at\r\nthe end of the house connected with the beds, where the manure may be\r\ncured. In curing it, it is placed in piles, the size of which will\r\ndepend upon the amount of manure to be cured, and upon the method\r\nemployed by the operator. The usual size, where considerable manure is\r\nused, is about three feet in depth by ten or twelve feet wide, and\r\nfifteen to twenty feet long. The manure is laid in these piles to heat,\r\nand is changed or turned whenever desirable to prevent the temperature\r\nfrom rising too high. The object of turning is to prevent the burning of\r\nthe material, which results at high degrees of temperature in\r\nfermentation. It is usually turned when the temperature rises to about\r\n130° F. At each turning the outside portions are brought to the center\r\nof the pile. The process is continued until the manure is well fermented\r\nand the temperature does not rise above 100 to 120 degrees, and then it\r\nis ready for making into beds.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods used in the process of curing, and it does not\r\nseem necessary that any one method should be strictly adhered to. The\r\nmost important things to be observed are to prevent the temperature from\r\nrising too high during the process of fermentation, to secure a thorough\r\nfermentation, and to prevent the material from drying out, or burning,\r\nor becoming too wet. The way in which the material is piled influences\r\nthe rapidity of fermentation, or the increase of temperature. Where the\r\nmaterial is rather loosely piled it ferments more rapidly, and the\r\ntemperature rises quickly. Watering the manure tends to increase the\r\nrapidity of fermentation and the elevation of the temperature. It is\r\nnecessary, though, sometimes to water the material if the heat has\r\nreached such a point that it is becoming too dry, or if there is a\r\ntendency for it to burn. The material is then turned, and watered some,\r\nbut care should be used not to make it too wet, since the spawn will not\r\nrun in wet material.\r\n\r\nIn general we might speak of three different methods in the curing of\r\nthe manure. _First, the slow process of curing._ According to this\r\nmethod, which is practiced by some, the time of fermentation may extend\r\nfrom four to five weeks. In this case the manure is piled in such a way\r\nthat the temperature does not rise rapidly. During the four or five\r\nweeks the manure is turned four or five times. The turning occurs when\r\nthe temperature has arisen to such a point as to require it.\r\n\r\n_Another method, used by some, might be called a rapid process of\r\ncuring._ According to this, the time for curing the manure extends over\r\na period of about a week, or five to ten days. The material is piled in\r\nsuch a way as to cause rapid fermentation and rapid rising of\r\ntemperature, the material sometimes requiring to be turned every day or\r\ntwo, sometimes twice a day, in order to lower the temperature and\r\nprevent the material from burning or drying out. Between this rapid\r\nprocess of curing, and the slow process of curing, the practice may\r\nextend so that, according to the method of different operators, the\r\nperiod of curing extends from one week to a month or five weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 231.--View in mushroom house (L. S. Bigony's\r\nMushroom Plant, Lansdale, Pa.), showing alley and side tier of beds.\r\nCopyright.]\r\n\r\n_The third method of curing_ consists in putting the material at once\r\ninto the beds before curing, and mixing in with the manure, as it is\r\nplaced in the bed, about one part of loam or garden soil to four or five\r\nparts of the fresh manure. The material is then left in this condition\r\nto cure without changing or turning, the temperature rising perhaps not\r\nabove 130° F. With some experience in determining the firmness with\r\nwhich the bed should be made to prevent a too high rise of temperature,\r\nthis practice might prove to be successful, and would certainly save\r\nconsiderable labor and expense in the making of the beds. Mr. William\r\nSwayne of Kennett Square, Pa., in the winter of 1900--1901, made up a\r\nportion of one of his beds in this way, and no difference could be seen\r\nin the results of the crop, the crop from the beds made in this way\r\nbeing as good as that of the adjoining beds, and he intends the\r\nfollowing year to make up all of his beds in the same way.\r\n\r\n=Mixing soil with the manure at the time of fermentation.=--While in the\r\ncave culture of mushrooms the manure is usually fermented and used\r\nwithout the admixture of soil, usually in the house or cellar culture\r\nrich loam soil, or rotted sod, is mixed with the manure at the time of\r\nturning it, during the process of fermentation. At the time of the first\r\nturning, soil is mixed in, a layer of the manure being spread out on the\r\nground, and then a sprinkling of soil over this. Then another layer of\r\nthe manure is added with another sprinkling of soil, and so on as the\r\nnew pile is built up. In the first turning of the manure, about one part\r\nof soil is used to eight or nine parts of manure. Then at the last\r\nturning another mixture of soil is added, so that there is about\r\none-fifth part soil in the mixture. The soil aids somewhat in lowering\r\nthe temperature, and also adds some to the bulk, so that more beds can\r\nbe made up with the same amount of manure.\r\n\r\n=Horse droppings free from straw.=--For growing mushrooms on a small\r\nscale, as in cellars or boxes, some prefer to select the horse droppings\r\nfree from straw.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING UP THE BEDS.\r\n\r\n=Making up beds without the addition of soil.=--In the cave culture of\r\nmushrooms the beds are usually made from manure alone, there being no\r\naddition of soil. This is perhaps partly due to the expense of getting\r\nthe soil in and out from the caves as well as to the low temperature\r\nprevailing there. It is believed by many that the results are equally as\r\ngood in beds from the manure alone as in those which contain an\r\nadmixture of soil. The method of making the beds in the Akron cave, or\r\n\"tunnel,\" is as follows: The manure, immediately after it has passed\r\nthrough the process of fermentation and curing in the pile, is carted to\r\nthe district in the mine where the beds are to be made and is dumped in\r\na long windrow on the ground. The length of the windrow depends of\r\ncourse upon the amount of material which is ready, as well as upon the\r\namount necessary for making up the beds for that distance. Two hemlock\r\nboards, sixteen feet long and ten inches wide, and two, four feet long\r\nand the same width, are then hastily nailed into the form of a\r\nrectangular frame. This is placed upon the rock bottom at one end of the\r\nrow of material, perpendicular to it usually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 232.--View in Akron \"tunnel,\" N. Y. Mushroom Co.\r\nMaking up the beds. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThe workmen then, with forks, distribute the material in this frame. If\r\nthere is coarser material which has been separated from the finer\r\nmaterial, this is placed in the bottom of the bed and the finer material\r\nis then filled on top. A layer of material is distributed over the\r\nbottom and then tamped down by striking with the back of the fork, as\r\nshown in Fig. 232. In this figure the material is shown to be off at one\r\nend of the bed. This was in a section of the mine where it was not\r\nconvenient to follow the beds in the direction of the pile of manure, so\r\nthat the material is distributed on from the end of the bed instead of\r\nfrom the side, as is the usual method. After several inches have been\r\ndistributed in this way and tamped down with the back of the fork, the\r\noperator tramps over the material with his feet and presses it down more\r\nfirmly. Another layer of material is distributed over this, and tamped\r\nand tramped down in a similar manner. The operation is repeated until\r\nthe depth of the manure after tramping down is about seven inches. It is\r\nthen left for the completion of the curing process and for the lowering\r\nof the temperature to the desired point. Usually, after making the bed\r\nin this way, there is a rise in the temperature for several days,\r\ngradually lowering until finally it reaches the point favorable for\r\nplanting the spawn.\r\n\r\nWhere the beds are made successively, one after another, following the\r\nwindrow of manure, the material used for the first bed removes from the\r\nwindrow a sufficient amount to make room for the second bed, and in like\r\nmanner room for the successive beds is provided for as the material is\r\ntaken for each one, so that the frames are put together and the beds are\r\nformed rapidly and easily.\r\n\r\n=Making ridge beds in caves.=--In the making of the ridge beds in caves\r\nthere are two methods which might be spoken of. One method is the well\r\nknown one practiced in certain of the caves near Paris, where the\r\nmaterial is taken by workmen in large baskets and distributed in rows.\r\nThe ridge is gradually formed into shape by walking astride of it, as\r\nadditional material is emptied on from the baskets, the workmen packing\r\nand shaping the ridge by pressure from their limbs as they stand astride\r\nof the row. In this way the ridges are made as high or somewhat higher\r\nthan their breadth at the base, and quite near together, so that there\r\nis just room in many cases to walk between the beds. In one cave in\r\nAmerica, where the ridge system is used to some extent, the ridges are\r\nmade with the aid of a board frame the length of the bed and the width\r\nof the base of the ridge. The long boards of this frame are slanting so\r\nthat they are more or less the shape of the ridge, but not equal to its\r\nheight. This frame is placed on the rock bottom, filled with manure and\r\ntramped on by the workmen. Then the frame is lifted on the ridge and\r\nmore material is added and tramped on in like manner, until the bulk of\r\nthe ridge bed is built up in this way and compressed into shape.\r\n\r\n=Beds in Houses Constructed for the Purpose of Growing\r\nMushrooms.=--Where only the floor of the house is used, a middle bed and\r\ntwo side beds are sometimes formed in the same manner as described in\r\nthe construction of the house for the tiers of beds, with an alley on\r\neither side of the large center bed, giving access to all. In some cases\r\nthe entire surface of the bottom is covered with material, but divided\r\ninto sections of large beds by framework of boards, but with no alleys\r\nbetween. Access to these beds is obtained by placing planks on the top\r\nof the boards which make the frame, thus forming walks directly over\r\nportions of the bed. In some cases ridge beds, as described for cave\r\ncultivation, are made on the floor of these houses. The beds are filled\r\nin the same way as described for the cave culture of mushrooms, but\r\nusually, in the beds made in houses built for the purpose of growing\r\nmushrooms, a percentage of soil is mixed in with the manure, the soil\r\nbeing usually mixed in at the time of turning the manure during the\r\nprocess of fermentation. Garden soil or rich loam is added, say at the\r\nfirst time the manure is turned while it is fermenting. Then, some time\r\nlater during the process of fermenting, another admixture of soil is\r\nadded. The total amount of soil added is usually equal to about\r\none-fifth of the bulk of the manure.\r\n\r\nAs this material, formed of the manure with an admixture of soil, is\r\nplaced in the beds it is distributed much in the same manner as\r\ndescribed for the making of flat beds in caves or tunnels. Usually,\r\nhowever, if there is coarse material which was separated from the manure\r\nat the first sorting, this without any mixture of soil is placed in the\r\nbottom of the bed, and then the manure and soil is used for the bulk of\r\nthe bed above. This coarser material, however, is not always at hand,\r\nand in such cases the beds are built up from the bottom with the mixture\r\nof manure and soil. The depth of the material in the beds in these\r\nhouses varies according to the experience of the operator. Some make the\r\nbeds about eighteen inches in depth, while others do not make the beds\r\nmore than eight or ten or twelve inches in depth. Where there are tiers\r\nof beds, that is, one bed above the other, very often the lowest bed,\r\nthe one which rests directly upon the ground, is made deeper than the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWhile it is the general custom to use material consisting of an\r\nadmixture of manure and soil in the proportions described, this custom\r\nis not always followed. In the case of the beds which are made up in the\r\nsummer for the fall and early winter crop, soil, being easily obtained\r\nat that season of the year, is mixed with the manure. Some growers,\r\nhowever, in making the beds in midwinter for the spring crop, do not use\r\nany soil since it is more difficult to obtain it at that season. In such\r\ncases the beds are made up of manure alone. The experience in some cases\r\nshows that the crop resulting from this method is equally as good as\r\nthat grown where soil has been added. In the experience of some other\r\ngrowers a bin of soil is collected during the summer or autumn which can\r\nbe used in the winter for mixing in with the manure and making the beds\r\nfor the spring crop. Where sod is used this is collected in pastures or\r\nfence rows in June, piled, and allowed to rot during the summer.\r\n\r\nIn distributing the material in the beds, the methods of packing it vary\r\naccording to the wishes or experience of the grower. It is often\r\nrecommended to pack the material very firmly. The feeling that this must\r\nbe packed very thinly has led to the disuse of beds in tiers by some,\r\nbecause it is rather difficult to pack the material down very firmly\r\nwhere one bed lies so closely above another. Where the practice is\r\nfollowed of packing the material very firmly in the bed, some\r\ninstrument in the form of a maul is used to tamp it down. Where there\r\nare tiers of beds an instrument of this kind cannot well be used. Here a\r\nbrick or a similar heavy and small instrument is used in the hand, and\r\nthe bed is thus pounded down firmly. This is a tedious and laborious\r\noperation. Many growers do not regard it as essential that the beds\r\nshould be very firmly packed. In such cases the material is distributed\r\non the beds and the successive layers are tamped down as firmly as can\r\nwell be done with the back of a fork or an ordinary potato digger, which\r\ncan be wielded with the two hands in between the beds. In the experience\r\nof these growers the results seem to be just as good as where the beds\r\nare more firmly packed down.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice in some cases where the bed lies against the side of\r\nthe house to build up the material of the bed at the rear, that is, at\r\nthe side of the house, much deeper than at the front, so that the depth\r\nof the bed at the back may be eighteen to twenty inches or two feet,\r\nwhile the front is eight to ten or twelve inches. This provides a\r\nslightly increased surface because of the obliquity of the upper surface\r\nof the bed, but it consumes probably a greater amount of material. It\r\nprobably is not advantageous where the operations are carried on on a\r\nlarge scale, where abundant room is available, where the material for\r\nmaking the beds is expensive, and it is desirable to obtain from the\r\nmaterial all that can be drawn in a single crop. The same practice is\r\nsometimes recommended and followed in the case of the beds made in\r\ncellars.\r\n\r\nIn the making of beds with fresh material, that is, with unfermented\r\nmanure, as was done by Mr. William Swayne of Kennett Square, Pa., one\r\nseason, the coarser material is put in the bottom of the bed, and then\r\nas the manure is distributed in the bed the soil is sprinkled on also,\r\nso that finally when the bed is completed the proportions of soil and\r\nmanure are the same as when it is mixed in at the time of fermentation.\r\nIn making the beds in this way, should any one be led to attempt it, it\r\nwould be necessary to guard against a too high temperature in the\r\nfermentation of this fresh material; the temperature should not run\r\nabove 130 degrees. It would also require a longer time from the making\r\nof the bed to planting the spawn than in the case of those beds where\r\nthe manure is fermented and cured before being made up. Probably the\r\ntotal amount of time from the beginning to the completion of the\r\npreparation of the bed for spawning would not be greater, if it would be\r\nso great.\r\n\r\nThe beds all having been made, they are left until they are in a\r\nsuitable condition for spawning. The determination of this point, that\r\nis, the point when the beds are ready for planting the spawn, seems to\r\nbe one of the most important and critical features of the business. The\r\nmaterial must be of a suitable temperature, preferably not above 90° F.,\r\nand not below 70°. The most favorable temperature, according to some,\r\nother conditions being congenial, ranges from 80° to 85° F., while many\r\nprefer to spawn at 70° to 75°. Many of the very successful growers,\r\nhowever, do not lay so much stress upon the temperature of the bed for\r\nthe time of spawning as they do upon the ripeness, or the cured\r\ncondition, of the material in the bed. This is a matter which it is very\r\ndifficult to describe to one not familiar with the subject, and it is\r\none which it is very difficult to properly appreciate unless one has\r\nlearned it by experience. Some judge more by the odor, or the \"smell,\"\r\nas they say, of the manure. It must have lost the fresh manure \"smell,\"\r\nor the \"sour smell,\" and possess, as they say, a \"sweet smell.\"\r\nSometimes the odor is something like that of manure when spawn has\r\npartly run through it. It sometimes has a sweetish smell, or a smell\r\nsuggestive of mushrooms even when no spawn has run through it.\r\n\r\nAnother important condition of the material is its state of dryness or\r\nmoisture. It must not be too dry or the spawn will not run. In such\r\ncases there is not a sufficient amount of moisture to provide the water\r\nnecessary for the growth of the mycelium. On the other hand, it must not\r\nbe too wet, especially at the time of spawning and for a few weeks\r\nafter. Some test the material for moisture in this way. Take a handful\r\nof the material and squeeze it. If on releasing the hold it falls to\r\npieces, it is too dry. By squeezing a handful near the ear, if there is\r\nan indication of running water, even though no water may be expressed\r\nfrom the material, it is too wet. If on pressure of the material there\r\nis not that sense of the movement of water in it on holding it to the\r\near, and if on releasing the pressure of the hand the material remains\r\nin the form into which it has been squeezed, or expands slightly, it is\r\nconsidered to be in a proper condition so far as moisture is concerned\r\nfor planting the spawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SPAWN IS.\r\n\r\nThe spawn of the mushroom is the popular word used in speaking of the\r\nmycelium of the mushroom. The term is commonly used in a commercial\r\nsense of material in which the mycelium is growing. This material is\r\nhorse manure, or a mixture of one or two kinds of manure with some soil,\r\nand with the threads of the mycelium growing in it. The mycelium, as is\r\nwell known, is the growing or vegetative part of the mushroom.\r\nSometimes the word \"fiber\" is used by the mushroom growers in referring\r\nto the mycelium which appears in the spawn, or in the mushroom bed. The\r\nmycelium is that portion of the plant which, in the case of the wild\r\nvarieties, grows in the soil, or in the leaf mold, in the tree trunk or\r\nother material from which the mushroom derives its food. The threads of\r\nmycelium, as we know, first originated from the spore of the mushroom.\r\nThe spore germinates and produces delicate threads, which branch and\r\nincrease by growth in extent, and form the mycelium. So the term spawn\r\nis rarely applied to the pure mycelium, but is applied to the substratum\r\nor material in which spawn is growing; that is, the substratum and\r\nmycelium together constitute the spawn.\r\n\r\n=Natural spawn or virgin spawn.=--This is termed natural spawn because\r\nit occurs under natural conditions of environment. The original natural\r\nspawn was to be found in the fields. In the early history of mushroom\r\nculture the spawn from the pastures and meadows where mushrooms grew was\r\none of the sources of the spawn used in planting. The earth containing\r\nthe spawn underneath clumps of mushrooms was collected and used.\r\n\r\nIt occurs more abundantly, however, in piles of horse manure which have\r\nstood for some time in barn yards, or very often in stalls where the\r\nmanure is allowed to accumulate, has been thoroughly tramped down and\r\nthen has been left in this condition for some time. It occurs also in\r\ncomposts, hothouse beds, or wherever accumulations of horse manure are\r\nlikely to occur, if other conditions are congenial. The origin of the\r\nnatural spawn under these conditions of environment is probably\r\naccounted for in many cases by the presence of the spores which have\r\nbeen in the food eaten by the horse, have passed through the alimentary\r\ncanal and are thus distributed through the dung.\r\n\r\nThe spores present in the food of the horse may be due to various\r\nconditions. Horses which go out to pasture are likely to take in with\r\nthe food obtained in grazing the spores scattered around on the grass,\r\nand in the upper part of the sod, coming from mushrooms which grew in\r\nthe field. In other cases, the spores may be present in the hay, having\r\nbeen carried by the wind from adjacent fields, if not from those which\r\nhave grown in the meadow. In like manner they may be present in the oats\r\nwhich have been fed to the horse. In the case of stable-fed animals, the\r\ninoculation of the manure in this way may not always be certain or very\r\nfree. But in the case of pasture-fed horses which are stalled at night\r\nprobably the inoculation is very certain and very abundant, so that a\r\nlarge number of spores would be present in the manure from horses fed in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nThe natural spawn also may originate from spores which are carried by\r\nthe wind from the pasture or meadow mushrooms upon manure piles, or\r\nespecially from spores which may lodge in the dust of the highways or\r\nstreet. Many of these spores would cling to the hoofs of the horses and\r\nat night, or at times of feeding, would be left with the manure in the\r\nstall. At other times horse droppings may be gathered from roads or\r\nstreets where spores may be present in the dust. The piles of the\r\ndroppings accumulated in this way, if left a sufficient time, may\r\nprovide natural spawn by this accidental inoculation from the spores.\r\n\r\nProbably few attempts have been made to grow the natural spawn with\r\ncertainty in this country, though it does not appear to be an\r\nimpracticable thing to do, since formerly this was one source of the\r\nvirgin spawn in Europe. It is usually obtained by search through stables\r\nand barn yards or other places where piles of horse manure have\r\naccumulated and have remained for several months. In some cases the\r\ngrowers keep men employed through the summer season searching the yards\r\nand stables over a considerable area for the purpose of finding and\r\ngathering this natural spawn. It is probably termed virgin spawn because\r\nof its origin under these natural conditions, and never having been\r\npropagated artificially.\r\n\r\nThe natural spawn, as indicated above, is employed for a variety of\r\npurposes. It is used for inoculating the bricks in the manufacture of\r\nbrick spawn. It is used for propagating once or twice in the mushroom\r\nbeds, for the purpose of multiplying it, either in the manufacture of\r\nbrick spawn, or for flake spawn, which is planted directly in the beds\r\nto be used for the crop. In some places in America it is collected on a\r\nlarge scale and relied on as the chief source of spawn for planting\r\nbeds. In such cases the natural or virgin spawn is used directly and is\r\nof the first and most vigorous generation. It is believed by growers who\r\nemploy it in this way that the results in the quality and quantity of\r\nthe crop exceed those produced from the market spawn. But even these\r\ngrowers would not always depend on the natural spawn, for the reason,\r\nthat collecting it under these conditions, the quantity is certain to\r\nvary from year to year. This is due probably to varying conditions of\r\nthe season and also to the varying conditions which bring about the\r\nchance inoculation, or the accumulation of the material in the yard for\r\na sufficient amount of time to provide the mycelium.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting, and it might also prove to be profitable to\r\ngrowers, if some attempt were made to grow natural spawn under\r\nconditions which would perhaps more certainly produce a supply. This\r\nmight be attempted in several different ways. Stall-fed horses might be\r\nfed a ripe mushroom every day or two. Or from the cap of ripe mushrooms\r\nthe spores might be caught, then mixed with oats and fed to the horse.\r\nAgain, the manure piles might be inoculated by spores caught from a\r\nnumber of mushrooms. Manure might also be collected during the summer\r\nmonths from the highways and aside from the probable natural inoculation\r\nwhich this material would probably have from the spores blown from the\r\nmeadow and pasture mushrooms, additional inoculation might be made. The\r\nmanure obtained in this way could be piled under sheds, packed down\r\nthoroughly, and not allowed to heat above 100° F. These piles could then\r\nbe left for several months, care being used that the material should\r\nhave the proper moisture content, not too dry nor too wet. This is given\r\nonly as a suggestion and it is hoped that some practical grower will\r\ntest it upon a small scale. In all cases the temperature should be kept\r\nlow during the fermentation of these piles, else the spawn will be\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nOne of the methods of obtaining natural spawn recommended by Cuthill\r\n(\"Treatise on the Cultivation of the Mushroom\") is to collect horse\r\ndroppings all along the highways during the summer, mixing it with some\r\nroad sand and piling it in a dry shed. Here it is packed down firmly to\r\nprevent the heat rising too high. A \"trial\" stick is kept in the pile.\r\nWhen this is pulled out, if it is so hot as to \"burn the hand,\" the heat\r\nis too great and would kill the spawn. In several months an abundance of\r\nthe spawn is generated here.\r\n\r\n=Mill-track spawn.=--\"Mill-track\" spawn originated from the spawn found\r\nin covered roadways at mills or along tram-car tracks where horses were\r\nused. The accumulation of manure trodden down in these places and\r\nsometimes mixed with sawdust or earth, provided a congenial place for\r\nthe growth of the mycelium. The spawn was likely introduced here through\r\nspores taken in with the food of the horse, or brought there from\r\nhighways, if they were not already in the soil from mushrooms grown\r\nthere. It would be then multiplied by the growth of the spawn, and from\r\nspores of mushrooms which might appear and ripen. The well tramped\r\nmaterial in which the mycelium grew here, when broken up, formed\r\nconvenient blocks of spawn for storage and transportation, and probably\r\nled to the manufacture of brick spawn.\r\n\r\n=Manufactured spawn.=--The manufactured spawn, on the other hand, is\r\nthat which is propagated artificially by the special preparation of the\r\nsubstratum or material in which the mycelium is to grow. This material\r\nis inoculated either with a piece of natural spawn, or with pieces of\r\npreviously manufactured spawn. It is put upon the market in two\r\ndifferent forms; the brick spawn, and the flake spawn. The latter is\r\nsometimes known as the French spawn, while the former, being largely\r\nmanufactured in England, is sometimes spoken of as the English spawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 233.--Brick spawn. Three \"bricks,\" one marked to\r\nshow into how many pieces one brick may be broken.]\r\n\r\n=Brick spawn.=--The brick spawn is so called because the material in\r\nwhich the mycelium is present is in the form of bricks. These bricks are\r\nabout 5 by 8 inches by 1-1/2 inches in thickness, and weigh about 1-1/4\r\npounds each when dried. The proportions of different kinds of material\r\nused in the manufacture of brick spawn probably vary with different\r\nmanufacturers, since there is a difference in the size and texture of\r\nbricks from different sources. One method of making the brick spawn is\r\nas follows: Equal parts of horse dung, and cow dung, and loam soil are\r\nthoroughly mixed together to a consistency of mortar. This is pressed\r\ninto the form of bricks and stood on edge to dry. When partly dry, a\r\npiece of spawn about an inch in diameter is pressed into one side of\r\neach brick. The bricks are then stood up again until thoroughly dried.\r\nThey are then piled upon a layer of fresh horse manure about 8 inches\r\ndeep, the pile of bricks being about 3 feet high. This pile is then\r\ncovered over loosely with fresh horse manure, a sufficient amount to\r\nproduce, when heating, a temperature of about 100° F. They are left in\r\nthis condition until the mycelium or \"fiber\" has thoroughly permeated\r\nthe bricks. The spawn is now completed, and the bricks are allowed to\r\ndry. In this condition they are put upon the market. The bricks made\r\nwith a very high percentage of soil often have the appearance of dried\r\nsoil, with a slight admixture of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nBrick spawn from other sources presents a very different texture and\r\ncontains probably a much larger percentage of horse manure, or, at\r\nleast, a much smaller percentage of soil. The appearance of the brick is\r\nnot that of soil with a slight admixture of vegetable materials, but has\r\nmuch the appearance of a dried and compressed mixture of horse dung and\r\ncow dung, with an abundance of the \"fiber\" or mycelium, \"the greyish\r\nmoldy, or thready matter,\" which constitutes the vital part of the\r\nspawn. In the selection of spawn this is an important item, that is, the\r\npresence of an abundance of \"fiber\" or mycelium. It can be seen on the\r\nsurface, usually showing an abundance of these whitish threads or\r\nsheets, or a distinct moldy appearance is presented. On breaking the\r\nbrick the great abundance of the \"fiber\" or whitish mycelium is seen all\r\nthrough it. This indicates that the brick possesses a high percentage of\r\nthe \"fiber,\" an important part of the spawn.\r\n\r\nOne not accustomed to the quality of spawn can therefore judge to a\r\ncertain extent by the appearance of the bricks as to the quality, at\r\nleast they can judge as to the presence of an abundance or a scanty\r\nquantity of the \"fiber.\" Since the spawn remains in good condition for\r\nseveral years, there is usually no danger in the use of spawn which may\r\nbe one or two years old. But it does deteriorate to some extent with\r\nage, and young spawn is therefore to be preferred to old spawn, provided\r\nthe other desirable qualities are equal. Those who attempt to cultivate\r\nmushrooms, and depend on commercial or manufactured spawn, should see to\r\nit that the spawn purchased possesses these desirable qualities of\r\ntexture, and the presence of an abundance of the mycelium. That which\r\nappears devoid of an abundance of mycelium should be rejected, and good\r\nspawn should be called for. There is no more reason why a grower should\r\naccept a worthless spawn from his seedsman than that he should accept\r\n\"addled\" eggs from his grocer. In this business, that is, the\r\nmanufacture and sale of spawn, poor material is apt to be thrown on the\r\nmarket just as in the case of seeds, poor material may find its way upon\r\nthe market. Sometimes this occurs through unscrupulous dealers, at other\r\ntimes through their ignorance, or through their failure to know the\r\nquality of the product they are handling.\r\n\r\nThere are some brands of spawn, that is, those manufactured by certain\r\nhouses, which rank very high among those who know the qualities and the\r\nvalue of good spawn. Some large growers send direct to the manufacturer\r\nfor their spawn, and where it is to be obtained in large quantities this\r\nis a desirable thing to do, since the cost is much less. Where obtained\r\nfrom seedsmen in large quantities, the prices are much lower than where\r\nsmall quantities are purchased. One of these brands of spawn, the Barter\r\nspawn, is for sale by several different dealers, by Mr. H. E. Hicks,\r\nKennett Square, Pa., by Henry F. Michell, 1018 Market street,\r\nPhiladelphia, and by Henry Dreer, 724 Chestnut street, Philadelphia.\r\nAnother brick spawn, known as \"Watson Prolific,\" is for sale by George\r\nC. Watson, Juniper and Walnut streets, Philadelphia. James Vicks Sons,\r\nRochester, N. Y., and Peter Henderson & Co., New York City, have their\r\nspawn manufactured expressly for their trade.\r\n\r\nThe Barter spawn is said to be made fresh every year, or every other\r\nyear. Instead of the \"continued culture\" of spawn, that is, inoculating\r\nthe bricks each succeeding year from the same line of spawn, which is,\r\nas it were, used over and over again, a return is made each year, or in\r\nthe alternate years, to the natural or virgin spawn, which is obtained\r\nfrom old manure heaps. In this way, the Barter spawn[D] is within two to\r\nthree, or four, generations of the natural spawn. The number of\r\ngenerations distant the brick is from the natural spawn, depends upon\r\nthe number of times it may have been multiplied before it is inoculated\r\ninto the bricks. That is, the natural spawn is probably first grown in\r\nlarge beds in order to multiply, to produce a sufficiently large\r\nquantity for the inoculation of the immense number of bricks to be\r\nmanufactured. For it is likely that a sufficient amount of natural spawn\r\ncould not be obtained to inoculate all the bricks manufactured in one\r\nyear. If a sufficient amount of the natural or virgin spawn could be\r\nobtained to inoculate all the bricks of one year's manufacture, this\r\nwould produce a spawn removed only one generation from that of natural\r\nspawn.\r\n\r\nIf the natural spawn were first grown in beds, and from here inoculated\r\ninto bricks, this particular brick spawn would be removed two\r\ngenerations from the natural spawn. So the number of times that\r\nsuccessive inoculations are made to multiply the spawn, the manufactured\r\nproducts are removed that many generations from the natural spawn. Where\r\nrecourse is had to the natural, or virgin spawn only once in two years,\r\nthe second year's product would then be further removed from the natural\r\nspawn than the first year's product. Where we know that it is removed\r\nbut one or a few generations from the natural spawn, it is a more\r\ndesirable kind. For the nearer it is to the natural spawn, other things\r\nbeing equal, the more vigorous the mycelium, and the finer will be the\r\nmushrooms produced.\r\n\r\nThe brick spawn is sometimes manufactured in this country by growers for\r\ntheir own use, but at present it is manufactured on such a large scale\r\nin England that little or no saving is effected by an attempt to\r\nmanufacture one's own brick spawn in this country.\r\n\r\n=Flake Spawn.=--The flake spawn, or \"flakes,\" is commonly known as the\r\nFrench spawn, because it is so extensively manufactured in France. It is\r\nmade by breaking down beds through which the mycelium has run, and\r\nbefore the crop of mushrooms appears. That is, the bed is spawned in the\r\nordinary way. When the mycelium has thoroughly permeated the bed, it is\r\ntaken down and broken into irregular pieces, six to eight inches in\r\ndiameter. Thus, the French spawn, where the beds are made entirely of\r\nhorse manure, with no admixture of soil, consist merely of the fermented\r\nand cured manure, through which the mycelium has run, the material, of\r\ncourse, being thoroughly dried. This spawn may be removed one or several\r\ngenerations from the natural spawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 234.--French spawn, or \"flakes,\" ready to plant.]\r\n\r\nThe French growers depend on natural spawn much more than American\r\ngrowers do. The natural spawn is collected from old manure heaps. Beds\r\nmade up in the ordinary way for the cultivation of mushrooms are planted\r\nwith this. The mycelium is allowed to run until it has thoroughly\r\npermeated the manure. These beds are broken down and used to spawn the\r\nbeds for the crop. In this case the crop would be grown from spawn only\r\none generation removed from the virgin spawn. If a sufficient amount of\r\nnatural spawn could not be obtained, to provide the amount required one\r\ngeneration old, it might be run through the second generation before\r\nbeing used. From the appearance of any spawn, of course, the purchaser\r\ncannot tell how many generations it is removed from the natural spawn.\r\nFor this quality of the spawn one must depend upon the knowledge which\r\nwe may have of the methods practiced by the different producers of\r\nspawn, if it is possible even to determine this.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAWNING THE BEDS.\r\n\r\nThe beds for growing the mushrooms having been made up, the spawn having\r\nbeen selected, the beds are ready for planting whenever the temperature\r\nhas been sufficiently reduced and the material is properly cured. It is\r\nquite easy to determine the temperature of the beds, but it is a more\r\ndifficult problem for the inexperienced to determine the best stage in\r\nthe curing of the material for the reception of the spawn. Some growers\r\nrely more on the state of curing of the manure than they do upon the\r\ntemperature. They would prefer to spawn it at quite a low temperature,\r\nrather than to spawn at what is usually considered an optimum\r\ntemperature, if the material is not properly cured. The temperature at\r\nwhich different treatises and growers recommend that the bed should be\r\nspawned varies from 70° to 90° F. Ninety degrees F. is considered by\r\nmany rather high, while 70° F. is considered by others to be rather low;\r\n80° to 85° is considered by many to be the most favorable temperature,\r\nprovided of course the other conditions of the bed are congenial. But\r\nsome, so far as temperature is concerned, would prefer to spawn the bed\r\nat 75° F. rather than at 90°, while many recommend spawning at 70° to\r\n75°. In some cases, I have known the growers to allow the temperature of\r\nthe beds to fall as low as 60° before spawning, because the material was\r\nnot, until that time, at the proper state of curing. Yet an experienced\r\ngrower, who understands the kind of spawn to plant in such a bed, can\r\nallow the temperature to go down to 60° without any very great risk.\r\nFresh spawn in an active state, that is, spawn which is in a growing\r\ncondition, as may be obtained by tearing up a bed, or a portion of one,\r\nthrough which the spawn has run, is better to plant in a bed of such low\r\ntemperature. Or, a bed of such low temperature, after spawning, might be\r\n\"warmed up,\" by piling fresh horse manure over it loosely for a week or\r\nten days, sufficient to raise the temperature to 80° or 90°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 235.--Pieces of brick spawn ready to plant.]\r\n\r\nWhen the brick spawn is used, the method of planting varies, of course,\r\nwith the methods of different operators. Some break the bricks into the\r\ndesired size and plant the pieces directly in the bed, without any\r\nspecial preparation. The brick is broken into pieces about two or three\r\ninches in diameter. Some recommend breaking the brick of the ordinary\r\nsize into about twelve pieces, some into nine pieces, so the custom\r\nvaries with different operators. These pieces are planted from seven to\r\nnine inches apart in the bed. For example, if they are to be planted\r\nnine inches apart in the bed, holes are made, either with the hand or\r\nwith some instrument, by pressing the material to one side sufficiently\r\nto admit of the piece of spawn being pressed in tightly. These openings\r\nare made, say, the first row on one side of the bed, about four and\r\none-half inches from the side, and nine inches apart in the row. The\r\nsecond row is made nine inches from the first row, and so on. The pieces\r\nof spawn are inserted in the opening in the bed, and at a slight\r\ndistance, two to three inches, below the surface. Some, however, insert\r\nthe piece of spawn just at the level of the bed, the opening being such\r\nthat the piece of spawn pressed into the opening is crowded below in\r\nplace, and the surrounding material fits snugly on the sides. Thus, when\r\nthe bed is spawned, the pieces may be a slight distance below the top of\r\nthe bed when they can be covered by some material, or in other cases,\r\nwhere the operator varies the method, they would lie just at the surface\r\nof the bed.\r\n\r\nThe bed is now firmed down according to the custom of the operator,\r\neither tamped down with some instrument very firmly, or by others, with\r\nthe back of the fork or other similar instrument, the bed is made firm,\r\nbut not quite so hard. The object in firming it down after spawning is\r\nto make the surface of the bed level, and also to bring the material in\r\nthe bed very closely in touch on all sides with the spawn with which it\r\nis impregnated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 236.\r\n\r\n  Piece of Natural Spawn.\r\n  Piece of French Spawn.\r\n  \"Flakes\" many generations old, \"running out.\"]\r\n\r\nSome growers follow the method of giving the spawn some little\r\npreparation before putting it into the bed. This preparation varies with\r\ndifferent operators. Its object, however, is to slightly moisten the dry\r\nspawn, and perhaps, also, to very slightly start the growth. To\r\naccomplish this, some will cover the bricks, before breaking them, with\r\nfresh horse manure, and allow this to remain several days, so that the\r\nwarmth and moisture generated here penetrate the material and soften\r\nsomewhat the brick. Some pile it in a room or compartment where there is\r\nlittle moisture, until the bricks are permeated to some extent with the\r\nmoisture, so that they are a little easier broken. They should not,\r\nunder any circumstances, be wet or soft in the sense of having absorbed\r\nan excess of water, nor should they be stored for any length of time\r\nwhere they will be damp. Still others break the bricks into the desired\r\npieces and place these directly on the top of the bed, at the place\r\nwhere they wish to plant the piece of spawn. They are left here for two\r\nor three days on the surface of the beds. These pieces absorb some\r\nmoisture and take up some warmth from the bed. Then they are planted in\r\nthe ordinary way.\r\n\r\n=Spawning with Flake Spawn, or Natural Spawn.=--In the use of the flake\r\nor natural spawn, the planting is accomplished in a similar way, but\r\nlarger pieces of the spawn are used, two or three times the size of the\r\npieces of brick employed. Some use a large handful. In some few cases,\r\nthe growers use a flake spawn from their own crop. That is, each year a\r\nfew beds are spawned from material which has been kept over from the\r\nprevious season. This is often kept in boxes, in cool places, where it\r\ndoes not thoroughly dry out. In this way, the spawn is used over and\r\nover again, until it becomes much less vigorous than natural spawn, or a\r\nspawn which is only one or only a few generations distant from the\r\nnatural spawn. This is seen in the less certainty with which the spawn\r\nruns through the bed, in the smaller crop of mushrooms, and their\r\ngradual deterioration in size. Some few practice the method of breaking\r\ndown the bed after the crop has been nearly gathered, using this weak\r\nspawn to inoculate fresh beds. This practice is objectionable for the\r\nsame reason that long cultivated spawn is objectionable.\r\n\r\n=Soiling the Beds.=--After the beds have been planted with the spawn,\r\nthe next thing is to soil them. That is, the manure in the bed is\r\ncovered with a layer of loam soil, or garden soil, to the depth of two\r\ninches, then spread evenly over the bed, leveled off, and tamped down,\r\nthough not packed too hard, and the surface is smoothed off. The time at\r\nwhich the soiling is done, varies also with different operators. Some\r\nsoil immediately after planting the spawn. Others believe that the spawn\r\nwill most certainly fail to run if the beds are soiled immediately after\r\nplanting. These operators wait two or three weeks after the spawn has\r\nbeen planted to soil it. Others wait until the temperature of the bed\r\nhas fallen from 80° or 85° at the time of spawning, to 70° or 60° F.\r\nSoiling at this temperature, that is, at 60° or 70° F., probably\r\nprevents the rapid cooling down of the bed, and it is desirable to soil,\r\nat least at this temperature, for that purpose. When the beds are\r\nsoiled, they are then left until the crop is ready to gather. Some\r\noperators give no further attention to the beds after soiling, other\r\nthan to water the beds, if that becomes necessary. It is desirable to\r\navoid watering, if the bed can be kept at the right state of moisture\r\nwithout. In watering the beds while the spawn is running, there is\r\ndanger of killing the young spawn with the water. Wherever it is\r\nnecessary, however, if the material in the bed becomes too dry,\r\nlukewarm water should be used, and it should be applied through a fine\r\nrose of a watering pot.\r\n\r\nWhile some operators after soiling the bed give no further care to it\r\nuntil the bed is bearing, others cover the beds with some litter, in the\r\nform of straw or excelsior. This is done for the purpose of conserving\r\nthe moisture in the bed, and especially the moisture on the surface of\r\nthe bed. Sometimes where there is a tendency for the material in the bed\r\nto become too dry, this litter on the surface retards the loss of\r\nmoisture. Also, the litter itself may be moistened and the bed can\r\nabsorb some moisture in this way, if it is desirable to increase the\r\nmoisture content of the bed slightly.\r\n\r\nWhen the spawn has once run well through the bed, watering can be\r\naccomplished with less danger of injury, yet great care must be used\r\neven now. The spawn will run through a bed with a somewhat less moisture\r\ncontent in the material than is necessary for drawing off the crop of\r\nmushrooms, though, of course, the spawn will not run if the bed is too\r\ndry. The only way to see if the spawn has run satisfactorily is to open\r\nup the bed at one or two points to examine the material, opening it up\r\nslightly. If the spawn has run well, a very delicate white \"fiber,\" the\r\nmycelium, can be seen penetrating all through the material. This handful\r\ncan be replaced in the bed, packed down, and the soil covered over and\r\nfirmed again at this point.\r\n\r\nWhen the mushrooms begin to appear, if the bed is a little dry, it\r\nshould be watered from time to time through the fine rose of a watering\r\npot. Lukewarm water should be used. Nearly all growers water the beds\r\nduring the picking of the crop, or during the period of gathering the\r\ncrop. At the first few waterings, water should not be sprinkled on the\r\nbeds to wet them entirely through. Enough water is applied to diffuse a\r\nshort distance only through the upper surface of the bed. At the next\r\nwatering, several days later, the moisture is carried further down in\r\nthe bed, and so on, through the several weeks, or months, over which the\r\nharvesting season extends. The object of thus gradually moistening the\r\nbed from above, is to draw the crop from the spawn at the surface of the\r\nbed first, and then, as the moisture extends downward, to gradually\r\nbring on the crop from the \"fiber\" below.\r\n\r\n=Gathering the Mushrooms.=--In artificial cultivation, the mushrooms\r\nusually formed are very near, or on, the surface of the bed. In the case\r\nof the meadow or pasture mushrooms, they are formed further below the\r\nsurface. This is probably due to the fact that the conditions under\r\nwhich the mushrooms grow in cultivation are such that the surface of the\r\nbed is more moist, and is less subject to variations in the content of\r\nmoisture, than is the surface of the ground in pastures. Although there\r\nmay be abundant rains in the fields, the currents of air over the\r\nsurface of the ground, at other times, quickly dries out the upper\r\nlayers of the soil. But indoors the mycelium often runs to the surface\r\nof the bed, and there forms the numerous pinheads which are the\r\nbeginnings of the mushrooms. The beds at this stage often present\r\nnumerous clusters of the mycelium and these minute pinheads crowded very\r\nclosely together. Hundreds or perhaps thousands of these minute\r\nbeginnings of mushrooms occur within a small space. There are very few\r\nof these, however, that reach the point of the mature mushroom. Few only\r\nof the pinheads grow to form the button, and the others abort, or cease\r\nto grow. Others are torn out while the larger ones are being picked.\r\n\r\nThe time at which the mushrooms are picked varies within certain limits,\r\nwith the different growers. Most cultivators, especially those who grow\r\nthe mushrooms in houses, consider 60° F. the desirable temperature for\r\nthe growth of mushrooms, that is, at a room temperature of 60° (while\r\nsome recommend 57°). The temperature of the beds themselves will be\r\nslightly above this. Under these conditions, that is, where the\r\nmushrooms are grown at a room temperature of about 60°, they open very\r\nquickly. It is necessary here to gather the mushrooms before they open,\r\nthat is, before the veil on the under surface breaks to expose the gill\r\nsurface. This practice is followed, of course, within certain limits. It\r\nis not possible in all cases, to pick every mushroom before the veil\r\nbreaks. They are collected once a day usually. At the time of collection\r\nall are taken which are of suitable size. Many of them may not yet have\r\nopened. But in the case of some of the older or more rapidly growing\r\nones, the veil may have broken, although they have not expanded very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nSome follow the method of having the fireman, on his round at night,\r\nwhen he looks after the fires in the heating room, gather the mushrooms.\r\nHe passes through all parts of the house and picks the mushrooms which\r\nare of suitable size. These are gathered by grasping a single mushroom\r\nby the cap, or where there is a cluster of mushrooms close together,\r\nseveral are taken in the hand. The plant is twisted slightly to free the\r\nstem from the soil, without tearing it up to any great extent. They are\r\nthrown in this condition into baskets. The collector then takes them to\r\nthe packing room, and the following morning the plants are trimmed,\r\nthat is, the part of the stems to which the earth is attached is cut\r\naway, the plants are weighed, put in baskets, and prepared for the\r\nmarkets. In other cases, the mushrooms are gathered early in the\r\nmorning, in the same way, taken to the packing room, where the lower\r\npart of the stem is cut away, the plants are weighed, placed into the\r\nbaskets and shipped to market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 237.--View in Packing Room (H. E. Hicks' Mushroom\r\nHouse, Kennett Square, Pa.) Copyright.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the caves, or abandoned mines, which I have visited, where\r\nthe mushrooms are grown on a large scale, the practice in picking the\r\nmushrooms varies somewhat from that just described. In the first place,\r\nthe mushrooms are allowed to stand on the bed longer, before they are\r\npicked. They are rarely, if ever, picked before they open. Mushrooms may\r\nbe quite large, but if they have not opened, they are not picked. Very\r\nfrequently, the plant may open, but, the operator says, it is not open\r\nenough. It will grow more yet. The object of the grower, in this case,\r\nis to allow the mushrooms to grow as long as it is possible, before\r\npicking, for the larger the mushroom, the more water it will take from\r\nthe bed, and the more it weighs. This may seem an unprofessional thing\r\nfor a grower to do, and yet it must be remembered that a large water\r\ncontent of the mushroom is necessary. The mushrooms grown in these mines\r\nare very firm and solid, qualities which are desired, not only by the\r\nconsumer, but are desirable for shipment. These mushrooms are much\r\nthicker through the center of the cap than those usually grown in houses\r\nat a room temperature of 60° F. For this reason, the mushrooms in these\r\ncaves spread out more, and the edges do not turn up so soon. Since the\r\ncap is so thick and firm at the center, it continues to grow and expand\r\nfor some little time after having opened, without turning up on the\r\nedges, and without becoming black and unsightly underneath. These large\r\nand firm mushrooms are not only desirable for their shipping qualities,\r\nbut also, if they are not too large, they are prized because they are of\r\nsuch a nice size for broiling.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely that one of the important conditions in producing\r\nmushrooms of this character is the low temperature of the mine. The\r\ntemperature here, in July and August, rises not higher than 58° F., that\r\nis, the room temperature of the mines; while in the winter it falls not\r\nlower than 52°. The growth of mushrooms, under these conditions, may not\r\nbe quite so rapid as in a house maintaining a room temperature of 60°.\r\nThe operator may not be able to grow so many crops from the same area,\r\nduring the same length of time; but the very fact that this low\r\ntemperature condition retards the growth of the mushrooms is perhaps an\r\nimportant item in producing the firm and more marketable product, which\r\ncan be allowed to grow longer before it is picked. It is possible, also,\r\nthat another condition has something to do with the firmness and other\r\ndesirable qualities of these mushrooms. It is, perhaps, to be found in\r\nthe fact that natural spawn is largely used in planting the beds, so\r\nthat the spawn is more vigorous than that which is ordinarily used in\r\nplanting, which is several or many generations distant from the virgin\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe methods of picking in this mine differ, also, from those usually\r\nemployed by growers of mushrooms. The mushrooms are pulled from the bed\r\nin the same way, but the operator carries with him two baskets and a\r\nknife. As fast as the mushrooms are pulled, and while they are still in\r\nhand, before the dirt can sift upon the other mushrooms, or fall in upon\r\nthe gills of those which are open, the lower part of the stem is cut\r\noff. This stem end is then placed in one basket, while the mushrooms\r\nwhich have been trimmed are placed in another basket. In cutting off the\r\nstems, just enough is cut to remove the soil, so that the length of the\r\nstem of the mushroom varies. The mushrooms are then taken to the packing\r\nroom in the cleanest possible condition, with no soil scattering\r\ntherefrom or falling down among the gills, as occurs to a greater or\r\nlesser extent where the mushrooms are picked and thrown\r\nindiscriminately into baskets.\r\n\r\n=Packing the Mushrooms.=--In the packing room the mushrooms are prepared\r\nfor shipment to market. The method at present usually employed is to\r\nship them in baskets. The baskets vary in size, according to the market\r\nto which the mushrooms are to be shipped. They hold from three, to four,\r\nfive, six, or ten pounds each. The larger baskets are only used where\r\nthe mushrooms are shipped directly to the consumers. When the customer\r\nrequires a large number of mushrooms, they can be shipped in these\r\nlarger baskets. Where they are shipped to commission merchants, and the\r\nfinal market is not known to the packer, they are usually packed in\r\nsmall baskets, three to four or five pounds. The baskets are sometimes\r\nlined with paper; that is, at the time of the packing the paper is\r\nplaced in the basket, one or two thicknesses of paper. The number of\r\nlayers of paper depends somewhat upon the conditions of transportation.\r\nThe greater amount of paper affords some protection from cold, in cold\r\nweather, and some protection from the evaporation of the moisture, in\r\ndry weather. When the basket is filled with the required quantity of\r\nmushrooms, which is usually determined first by weight, the surplus\r\npaper is folded over them. This is covered in most cases by thin board\r\nstrips, which are provided for basket shipment of vegetables of this\r\nkind. In some cases, however, where shipped directly to customers so\r\nthat the baskets soon reach their destination, additional heavy paper,\r\ninstead of the board, may be placed over and around the larger part of\r\nthe basket, and then tied down neatly with cord.\r\n\r\n=Placing the Mushrooms in the Basket.=--Some growers do not give any\r\nattention to placing the mushrooms in the baskets. The stems are cut off\r\nin the packing room, they are thrown into the weighing pan, and when the\r\nbeam tips at three, or four, or five pounds, as the case may be, the\r\nmushrooms are emptied into the baskets, leveled down, and the baskets\r\nclosed for shipment. Others use more care in the packing of the\r\nmushrooms; especially is this the case on the part of those who pick the\r\nmushrooms when they are somewhat larger and more open, though the\r\npractice of placing the mushrooms in a basket is followed even by those\r\nwho pick before the mushrooms are open. In placing them, one mushroom is\r\ntaken at a time and put stem downward into the basket, until the bottom\r\nis covered with one layer, and then successive layers are placed on top\r\nof these. The upper layers in the basket then present a very neat and\r\nattractive appearance. In thus placing the mushrooms in the basket, if\r\nthere are any mushrooms which are quite large, they are placed in the\r\nbottom. The custom of the operator here is different from that of the\r\ngrower of apples, or of other fruit, where the larger and finer samples\r\nare often placed on top, the smaller ones being covered below. It is a\r\ncurious fact, however, that this practice of placing the largest\r\nmushrooms below in the basket is due to the fact that usually the larger\r\nmushrooms are not considered so marketable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 238.--View in packing room, Akron \"tunnel,\" N. Y.\r\nMushroom Co.; placing mushrooms in basket. Copyright.]\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why the larger mushrooms are not considered so\r\ndesirable or marketable as the medium-sized or smaller ones. In the\r\nfirst place, the larger mushrooms, under certain conditions, especially\r\nthose grown in house culture at a comparatively high temperature, are\r\napt to be very ripe, so that the gills are black from over-ripe spores,\r\nand are thus somewhat unsightly. Those grown at a lower temperature, as\r\nis the case in some mines, do not blacken so soon, and are therefore apt\r\nto be free from this objection. Another objection, however, is on the\r\npart of the restaurant owner where mushrooms are served. In serving the\r\nmushrooms broiled on toast, the medium-sized one is more desirable from\r\nthe standpoint of the restaurant owner, in that two medium-sized ones\r\nmight be sufficient to serve two persons, while one quite large one,\r\nweighing perhaps the same as the two medium ones, would only be\r\nsufficient to serve one person at the same price, unless the large\r\nmushroom was cut in two. If this were done, however, the customer would\r\nobject to being served with half a mushroom, and the appearance of a\r\nhalf mushroom served in this way is not attractive.\r\n\r\n=Resoiling.=--Once or twice a week during the harvesting period all\r\nloose earth, broken bits of spawn, free buttons, etc., should be cleaned\r\nout where the mushrooms have been picked. These places should be filled\r\nwith soil and packed down by hand. All young mushrooms that \"fog off\"\r\nshould be gathered up clean. Some persons follow the practice of growing\r\na second crop on the same bed from which the first crop has been\r\ngathered. The bed is resoiled by placing about two inches of soil over\r\nthe old soil. The bed is then watered, sometimes with lukewarm water to\r\nwhich a small quantity of nitrate of soda has been added. The large\r\ngrowers, however, usually do not grow a second crop in this way, but\r\nendeavor to exhaust the material in the bed by continuous growth.\r\n\r\n=Use of manure from beds which have failed.=--Manure in which the spawn\r\nhas failed to run is sometimes removed from the bed and mixed with fresh\r\nmanure, the latter restoring the heat. If the manure was too wet, the\r\nmoisture content can now be lessened by the use of dry soil.\r\n\r\n=Cleaning house to prepare for successive crops.=--When the crop is\r\nharvested, all the material is cleaned out to prepare the beds for the\r\nnext crop. The material is taken out \"clean,\" and the floors, beds,\r\nwalls, etc., swept off very clean. In addition, some growers whitewash\r\nthe floors and all wood-work. Some whitewash only the floors, depending\r\non sweeping the beds and walls very clean. Still others whitewash the\r\nfloors and wash the walls with some material to kill out the vermin.\r\nSome trap or poison the cockroaches, wood-lice, etc., when they appear.\r\nSome growers who succeed well for several years, and then fail, believe\r\nthat the house \"gets tired,\" as they express it, and that the place must\r\nrest for a few years before mushrooms can be grown there again. Others\r\ngrow mushrooms successfully year after year, but employ the best\r\nsanitary methods.\r\n\r\n=Number of crops during a year.=--In caves or mines, where the\r\ntemperature is low, the beds are in process of formation and cropping\r\ncontinuously. So soon as a bed has been exhausted the material is\r\ncleaned out, and new beds are made as fast as the fresh manure is\r\nobtained. In houses where the mushrooms cannot be grown during the\r\nsummer, the crops are grown at quite regular periods, the first crop\r\nduring fall and early winter, and the second crop during spring. Some\r\nobtain the manure and ferment it during August and September, spawning\r\nthe beds in September and October. Others begin work on the fermentation\r\nof the manure in June or July, make up the beds in July and August,\r\nspawn, and begin to draw off the crop somewhat earlier. The second crop\r\nis prepared for whenever the first one is drawn off, and this varies\r\neven in the experience of the same grower, since the rate of the running\r\nof the spawn varies from time to time. Sometimes the crop begins to come\r\nfour or five weeks from the time of planting the spawn. At other times\r\nit may be two or three months before the spawn has run sufficiently for\r\nthe crop to appear. Usually the crop begins to come on well in six to\r\neight weeks. The crop usually lasts for six weeks to two months, or\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n=Productivity of the beds.=--One pound of mushrooms from every two\r\nsquare feet of surface is considered a very good crop. Sometimes it\r\nexceeds this, the beds bearing one pound for every square foot, though\r\nsuch a heavy yield is rare. Oftener the yield is less than half a pound\r\nfor a square foot of surface.\r\n\r\n=Causes of failure.=--The beginner should study very carefully the\r\nconditions under which he grows his crops, and if failure results, he\r\nshould attempt to analyze the results in the light of the directions\r\ngiven for the curing of the manure, its moisture content, \"sweetness,\"\r\ncharacter of the spawn, temperature, ventilation, etc. While there\r\nshould be good ventilation, there should not be drafts of air. A\r\nbeginner may succeed the first time, the second or third, and then may\r\nfail, and not know the cause of the failure. But given a good spawn, the\r\nright moisture content of the material at time of planting and running\r\nof the spawn, the sweet condition, or proper condition of the curing of\r\nthe manure, proper sanitary conditions, there should be no failure.\r\nThese are the most important conditions in mushroom culture. After the\r\nspawn has run and the crop has begun to come, the beds have been known\r\nto freeze up during the winter, and in the spring begin and continue to\r\nbear a good crop. After the spawn has run well, beds have accidentally\r\nbeen flooded with water so that manure water would run out below, and\r\nyet come on and bear as good a crop as adjoining beds.\r\n\r\n=Volunteer mushrooms in greenhouses.=--Volunteer mushrooms sometimes\r\nappear in greenhouses in considerable quantity. These start from natural\r\nspawn in the manure used, or sometimes from the spawn remaining in\r\n\"spent\" mushroom beds which is mixed with the soil in making lettuce\r\nbeds, etc., under glass. One of the market gardeners at Ithaca used old\r\nspawn in this way, and had volunteer mushrooms among lettuce for several\r\nyears. In making the lettuce beds in the autumn, a layer of fresh horse\r\nmanure six inches deep is placed in the bottom, and on this is placed\r\nthe soil mixed with the old, spent mushroom beds. The following year the\r\nsoil and the manure at the bottom, which is now rotten, is mixed up, and\r\na fresh layer of manure is placed below. In this way the lettuce bed is\r\nself-spawned from year to year. About every six years the soil in the\r\nbed is entirely changed. This gardener, during the winter of 1900--1,\r\nsold $30.00 to $40.00 worth of volunteer mushrooms. Another gardener, in\r\na previous year, sold over $50.00 worth.\r\n\r\n=Planting mushrooms with other vegetables.=--In some cases gardeners\r\nfollow the practice of inserting a forkful of manure here and there in\r\nthe soil where other vegetables are grown under glass, and planting in\r\nit a bit of spawn.\r\n\r\n=Mushroom and vegetable house combined.=--Some combine a mushroom house\r\nand house for vegetables in one, there being a deep pit where several\r\ntiers of beds for mushrooms can be built up, and above this the glass\r\nhouse where lettuce, etc., is grown, all at a temperature of about 60°\r\nF.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE METHODS SUGGESTED FOR GROWING MUSHROOMS IN CELLARS AND SHEDS.\r\n\r\n     =First Method.=--Obtain fresh stable horse manure mixed with straw\r\n     used in bedding the animals. Shake it out, separating the coarse\r\n     material from the droppings. Put the droppings in a pile two to\r\n     three feet deep. Pack down firmly. When the heat rises to near 130°\r\n     F., turn and shake it out, making a new pile. Make the new pile by\r\n     layers of manure and loam soil, or rotted sod, one part of soil to\r\n     eight or nine parts of manure. Turn again when the heat rises to\r\n     near 130° F., and add the same amount of soil. When the temperature\r\n     is about 100° F., the material is ready for the beds.\r\n\r\n     =Preparing the beds.=--Make the beds as described under the\r\n     paragraph on pages 250--253, or use boxes. Place the coarse litter\r\n     in the bottom three to four inches deep. On this place three to\r\n     four inches of the cured material, pack it down, and continue\r\n     adding material until the bed is ten to fifteen inches deep. Allow\r\n     the beds to stand, covering them with straw or excelsior if the air\r\n     in the cellar or shed is such as to dry out the surface.\r\n\r\n     Test the moisture content according to directions on page 255.\r\n\r\n     Watch the temperature. Do not let it rise above 130° F. When it is\r\n     down to 90° F. or 70° F., if the manure has a \"sweetish\" or\r\n     \"mushroomy\" smell it is ready to spawn.\r\n\r\n     Spawn according to directions on page 263.\r\n\r\n     Soil according to directions on page 266; cover bed with straw or\r\n     excelsior.\r\n\r\n     =Second Method.=--Use horse droppings freed from the coarser\r\n     material. Proceed as in _first_ method.\r\n\r\n     =Third Method.=--Use horse droppings freed from coarser material.\r\n     Pile and _pack firmly_. Do not let temperature rise above 130° F.\r\n     When it has cooled to 100° F., make up the beds, at the same time\r\n     mixing in an _equal quantity_ of rich loam or rotted sod. Spawn in\r\n     a day or two.\r\n\r\n     In beginning, practice on a small scale and study the conditions\r\n     thoroughly, as well as the directions given in this chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[D] I have not learned the history of the other kinds of spawn referred\r\nto above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR COOKING MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nBy MRS. SARAH TYSON RORER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs varieties of mushrooms differ in analysis, texture and density of\r\nflesh, different methods of cooking give best results. For instance, the\r\n_Coprinus micaceus_, being very delicate, is easily destroyed by\r\nover-cooking; a dry, quick pan of the \"mushroom bells\" retains the best\r\nflavor; while the more dense _Agaricus campestris_ requires long, slow\r\ncooking to bring out the flavor, and to be tender and digestible.\r\nSimplicity of seasoning, however, must be observed, or the mushroom\r\nflavor will be destroyed. If the mushroom itself has an objectionable\r\nflavor, better let it alone than to add mustard or lemon juice to\r\novercome it. Mushrooms, like many of the more succulent vegetables, are\r\nlargely water, and readily part with their juices on application of salt\r\nor heat; hence it becomes necessary to put the mushroom over the fire\r\nusually without the addition of water, or the juices will be so diluted\r\nthat they will lack flavor. They have much better flavor cooked without\r\npeeling, with the exception of puff-balls, which should always be pared.\r\nAs they lose their flavor by soaking, wash them quickly, a few at a\r\ntime; take the mushroom in the left hand and with the right hand wash\r\nthe top or pileus, using either a very soft brush or a piece of flannel;\r\nshake them well and put them into a colander to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGARICUS.[E]\r\n\r\nThe wild or uncultivated _Agaricus campestris_, which is usually picked\r\nin open fields, will cook in less time than those grown in caves and\r\nsold in our markets during the winter and spring. Cut the stems close to\r\nthe gills; these may be put aside and used for flavoring sauces or\r\nsoups. Wash the mushrooms carefully, keeping the gills down; throw them\r\ninto a colander until drained.\r\n\r\n=Stewed.=--To each pound, allow two ounces of butter. Put the butter\r\ninto a saucepan, and when melted, not brown, throw in the mushrooms\r\neither whole or cut into slices; sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt;\r\ncover the saucepan closely to keep in the flavor, and cook very slowly\r\nfor twenty minutes, or until they are tender. Moisten a rounding\r\ntablespoonful of flour in a little cold milk; when perfectly smooth, add\r\nsufficient milk to make one gill; stir this into the mushrooms, add a\r\nsaltspoon of white pepper, stir carefully until boiling, and serve at\r\nonce. This makes a fairly thick sauce. Less flour is required when they\r\nare to be served as a sauce over chicken, steak, or made dishes.\r\n\r\n=Broiled.=--Cut the stems close to the gills; wash the mushrooms and dry\r\nthem with a soft piece of cheesecloth; put them on the broiler gills up.\r\nPut a piece of butter, the size of a marrowfat pea, in the center of\r\neach; sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Put the broiler over the\r\nfire skin side down; in this way, the butter will melt and sort of baste\r\nthe mushrooms. Have ready squares of neatly toasted bread; and, as soon\r\nas the mushrooms are hot on the skin side, turn them quickly and broil\r\nabout two minutes on the gill side. Five minutes will be sufficient for\r\nthe entire cooking. Dish on toast and serve at once.\r\n\r\n=Panned on Cream Toast.=--Cut the stem close to the gills; wash and dry\r\nas directed for broiling. Put them into a pan, and pour over a very\r\nlittle melted butter, having gill sides up; dust with salt and pepper,\r\nrun into a hot oven for twenty minutes. While these are panning, toast\r\nsufficient bread to hold them nicely; put it onto a hot platter, and\r\njust as the mushrooms are done, cover the bread with hot milk, being\r\ncareful not to have too much or the bread will be pasty and soft. Dish\r\nthe mushrooms on the toast, putting the skin side up, pour over the\r\njuices from the pan, and serve at once.\r\n\r\nThese are exceedingly good served on buttered toast without the milk,\r\nand will always take the place of broiled mushrooms.\r\n\r\n=In the Chafing Dish.=--Wash, dry the mushrooms, and cut them into\r\nslices. To each pound allow two ounces of butter. Put the butter in the\r\nchafing dish, when hot put in the mushrooms, sprinkle over a teaspoonful\r\nof salt, cover the dish, and cook slowly for five minutes, stirring the\r\nmushrooms frequently; then add one gill of milk. Cover the dish again,\r\ncook for three minutes longer, add the beaten yolks of two eggs, a dash\r\nof pepper, and serve at once. These must not be boiled after the eggs\r\nare added; but the yolk of egg is by far the most convenient form of\r\nthickening when mushrooms are cooked in the chafing dish.\r\n\r\n=Under the Glass Cover or \"Bell\" with Cream.=--With a small biscuit\r\ncutter, cut rounds from slices of bread; they should be about two and a\r\nhalf inches in diameter, and about a half inch in thickness. Cut the\r\nstems close to the gills from fresh mushrooms; wash and wipe the\r\nmushrooms. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan; when hot, throw\r\nin the mushrooms, skin side down; cook just a moment, and sprinkle them\r\nwith salt and pepper. Arrange the rounds of bread, which have been\r\nslightly toasted, in the bottom of your \"bell\" dish; heap the mushrooms\r\non these; put a little piece of butter in the center; cover over the\r\nbell, which is either of glass, china, or silver; stand them in a baking\r\npan, and then in the oven for twenty minutes. While these are cooking,\r\nmix a tablespoonful of butter and one of flour in a saucepan, add a half\r\npint of milk, or you may add a gill of milk and a gill of chicken stock;\r\nstir until boiling, add a half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper.\r\nWhen the mushrooms have been in the oven the allotted time, bring them\r\nout; lift the cover, pour over quickly a little of this sauce, cover\r\nagain, and send them at once to the table.\r\n\r\n=Another Method.=--Wash and dry the mushrooms; arrange them at once on\r\nthe \"bell plate.\" The usual plates will hold six good sized ones. Dust\r\nwith pepper and salt; put in the center of the pile a teaspoonful of\r\nbutter; pour over six tablespoonfuls of cream or milk; cover with the\r\nbell; stand the dish in a baking pan, and then in a hot oven for twenty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThese are arranged for individual bells. Where one large bell is used,\r\nthe mushrooms must be dished on toast before they are served. The object\r\nin covering with the bell is to retain every particle of the flavor. The\r\nbell is then lifted at the table, that the eater may get full aroma and\r\nflavor from the mushroom.\r\n\r\n=Puree.=--Wash carefully a half pound of mushrooms; chop them fine, put\r\nthem into a saucepan with a tablespoonful of butter, and if you have it,\r\na cup of chicken stock; if not, a cup of water. Cover the vessel and\r\ncook slowly for thirty minutes. In a double boiler, put one pint of\r\nmilk. Rub together one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of\r\nflour; add it to the milk; stir and cook until thick; add the mushrooms,\r\nand press the whole through a sieve; season to taste with salt and\r\npepper only.\r\n\r\n=Cream of Mushroom Soup.=--This will be made precisely the same as in\r\nthe preceding recipe, save that one quart of milk will be used instead\r\nof a pint with the same amount of thickening, and the mushrooms will not\r\nbe pressed through a sieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPRINUS COMATUS and COPRINUS ATRAMENTARIUS.\r\n\r\nAs these varieties usually grow together and are sort of companion\r\nmushrooms, recipes given for one will answer for the cooking of the\r\nother. Being soft and juicy, they must be handled with care, and are\r\nmuch better cooked with dry heat. Remove the stems, and wash them\r\ncarefully; throw them into a colander until dry; arrange them in a\r\nbaking pan; dot here and there with bits of butter, allowing a\r\ntablespoonful to each half pound of mushrooms; dust with salt and\r\npepper, run them into a very hot oven, and bake for thirty minutes; dish\r\nin a heated vegetable dish, pouring over the sauce from the pan.\r\n\r\nThe _C. micaceus_ may also be cooked after the same fashion--after\r\ndishing the mushrooms boil down the liquor.\r\n\r\n=Stewed.=--Wash and dry them; put them into a large, flat pan, allowing\r\na tablespoonful of butter to each half pound of mushrooms; sprinkle at\r\nonce with salt and pepper; cover the pan, and stew for fifteen minutes.\r\nMoisten a tablespoonful of flour in a little cold milk; when smooth, add\r\na half cup of cream, if you have it; if not, a half cup of milk. Push\r\nthe mushrooms to one side; turn in this mixture, and stir until boiling.\r\nDo not stir the mushrooms or they will fall apart and become unsightly.\r\nDish them; pour over the sauce, and serve at once. Or they may be served\r\non toast, the dish garnished with triangular pieces of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPRINUS MICACEUS.\r\n\r\nWash and dry the mushrooms; put them into a deep saucepan with a\r\ntablespoonful of butter to each quart; stand over a quick fire, sort of\r\ntossing the saucepan. Do not stir, or you will break the mushrooms. As\r\nsoon as they have reached the boiling point, push them to the back part\r\nof the stove for five minutes; serve on toast. These will be exceedingly\r\ndark, are very palatable, and perhaps are the most easily digested of\r\nall the varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPIOTA.\r\n\r\nThese mushrooms, having very thin flesh and deep gills, must be quickly\r\ncooked to be good. Remove the stem, take the mushrooms in your hand,\r\ngill side down, and with a soft rag wash carefully the top, removing all\r\nthe little brown scales. Put them into a baking pan, or on a broiler.\r\nMelt a little butter, allow it to settle, take the clear, oily part\r\nfrom the top and baste lightly the mushrooms, gill sides up; dust with\r\nsalt and pepper. Place the serving dish to heat. Put the mushrooms over\r\na quick fire, skin side down, for just a moment; then turn and boil an\r\ninstant on the gill side, and serve at once on the heated plate.\r\n\r\nIn this way _Lepiota procera_ is most delicious of all mushrooms; but if\r\ncooked in moist heat, it becomes soft, but tough and unpalatable; if\r\nbaked too long, it becomes dry and leathery. It must be cooked quickly\r\nand eaten at once. All the edible forms may be cooked after this recipe.\r\n\r\nThese are perhaps the best of all mushrooms for drying. In this\r\ncondition they are easily kept, and add so much to an ordinary meat\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER MUSHROOMS (Pleurotus).\r\n\r\nWash and dry the mushrooms; cut them into strips crosswise of the gills,\r\ntrimming off all the woody portion near the stem side. Throw the\r\nmushrooms into a saucepan, allowing a tablespoonful of butter to each\r\npint; sprinkle over a half teaspoonful of salt; cover, and cook slowly\r\nfor twenty minutes. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour in a half cup of\r\nmilk; when perfectly smooth, add another half cup; turn this into the\r\nmushroom mixture; bring to boiling point, add just a grating of nutmeg,\r\na few drops of onion juice, and a dash of pepper. Serve as you would\r\nstewed oysters.\r\n\r\nTo make this into à la poulette, add the yolks of two eggs just as you\r\ntake the mixture from the fire, and serve on toast.\r\n\r\n=Mock Oysters.=--Trim the soft gill portion of the _Pleurotus ostreatus_\r\ninto the shape of an oyster; dust with salt and pepper; dip in beaten\r\negg, then in bread crumbs, and fry in smoking hot fat as you would an\r\noyster, and serve at once. This is, perhaps, the best method of cooking\r\nthis variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSULA.\r\n\r\nWhile in this group we have a number of varieties, they may all be\r\ncooked after one recipe. The stems will be removed, the mushrooms\r\ncarefully washed, always holding the gill side down in the water,\r\ndrained in a colander; and while they apparently do not contain less\r\nwater than other mushrooms, the flesh is rather dense, and they do not\r\nso quickly melt upon being exposed to heat. They are nice broiled or\r\nbaked, or may be chopped fine and served with mayonnaise dressing,\r\nstuffed into peeled tomatoes, or with mayonnaise dressing on lettuce\r\nleaves, or mixed with cress and served with French dressing, as salads.\r\n\r\nThe \"green\" or _Russula virescens_ may be peeled, cut into thin slices,\r\nmixed with the leaves of water-cress which have been picked carefully\r\nfrom the stems, covered with French dressing, and served on slices of\r\ntomato. It is well to peel all mushrooms if they are to be served raw.\r\nTo bake, follow recipes given for baking _campestris_. In this way they\r\nare exceedingly nice over the ordinary broiled steak.\r\n\r\nOne of the nicest ways, however, of preparing them for steak is to wash,\r\ndry and put them, gills up, in a baking pan, having a goodly quantity;\r\npour over just a little melted butter; dust with salt and pepper, and\r\nput them into the oven for fifteen minutes. While you are broiling the\r\nsteak, put the plate upon which it is to be served over hot water to\r\nheat; put on it a tablespoonful of butter, a little salt, pepper, and\r\nsome finely chopped parsley. Take the mushrooms from the oven, put some\r\nin the bottom of the plate, dish the steak on top, covering the\r\nremaining quantity over the steak. Add two tablespoonfuls of stock or\r\nwater to the pan in which they were baked; allow this to boil, scraping\r\nall the material from the pan; baste this over the steak, and serve at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n_Agaricus campestris_ and many other varieties may also be used in this\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACTARII.\r\n\r\nRemove the stems, and wash the mushrooms. Put them into a saucepan,\r\nallowing a tablespoonful of butter and a half teaspoonful of salt to\r\neach pint. Add four tablespoonfuls of stock to the given quantity; cover\r\nthe saucepan, and _cook slowly_ three-quarters of an hour. At the end of\r\nthis time you will have a rich, brown sauce to which you may add a\r\nteaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and, if you like, a tablespoonful\r\nof sherry. Serve in a vegetable dish.\r\n\r\n=Lactarius deliciosus Stewed.=--Wash the mushrooms; cut them into\r\nslices; put them into a saucepan, allowing a half pint of stock to each\r\npint of mushrooms; add a half teaspoonful of salt; cover and stew slowly\r\nfor three-quarters of an hour. Put a tablespoonful of butter in another\r\nsaucepan, mix with it a tablespoonful of flour; add the mushrooms, stir\r\nuntil they have reached the boiling point; add a teaspoonful of kitchen\r\nbouquet, a dash of pepper, and serve it at once in a heated vegetable\r\ndish.\r\n\r\nA nice combination for a steak sauce is made by using a dozen good sized\r\n_Lactarius deliciosus_ with four \"beefsteak\" mushrooms, using then the\r\nfirst recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED WITH MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nWash a dozen good sized mushrooms, either _Lactarii_ or _Agarici_, also\r\nwash and remove the spores from half a dozen good sized \"beefsteak\"\r\nmushrooms, cutting them into slices. Put all these into a baking pan,\r\nsprinkle over a half teaspoonful of salt, add a tablespoonful of butter,\r\nand bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. Broil the steak\r\nuntil it is nearly done; then put it into the pan with the mushrooms,\r\nallowing some of the mushrooms to remain under the steak, and cover with\r\nthe remaining portion; return it to the oven for ten minutes; dish and\r\nserve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLETI.\r\n\r\nThese are more palatable baked or fried. Wash the caps and remove the\r\npores. Dip the caps in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry them in\r\nsmoking hot fat; oil is preferable to butter; even suet would make a\r\ndrier fry than butter or lard. Serve at once as you would egg plant.\r\n\r\n=Baked.=--Wash and remove the pores; put the mushrooms into a baking\r\npan; baste them with melted butler, dust with salt and pepper, and bake\r\nin a moderately hot oven three-quarters of an hour; dish in a vegetable\r\ndish. Put into the pan in which they were baked, a tablespoonful of\r\nbutter. Mix carefully with a tablespoonful of flour and add a half pint\r\nof stock, a half teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet or browning, the same of\r\nsalt, and a dash of pepper; pour this over the mushrooms, and serve.\r\n\r\n=In Fritter Batter.=--Beat the yolk of one egg slightly, and add a half\r\ncup of milk; stir into this two-thirds of a cup of flour; stir in the\r\nwell beaten white of the egg and a teaspoonful of olive oil. Wash and\r\nremove the pores from the boleti. Have ready a good sized shallow pan,\r\nthe bottom covered with smoking hot oil; dip the mushrooms, one at a\r\ntime, into this batter, drain for a moment, and drop them into the hot\r\nfat. When brown on one side, turn and brown on the other. Drain on soft\r\npaper and serve at once.\r\n\r\n=Boleti in Brown Sauce.=--Wash and dry the boleti; remove the pores; cut\r\nthem into small pieces. To each pound allow a tablespoonful of butter.\r\nPut the butter into a saucepan with the mushrooms; add a half\r\nteaspoonful of salt; cover the pan, and stew slowly for twenty minutes;\r\nthen dust over a tablespoonful of flour; add a half cup of good beef\r\nstock; cook slowly for ten minutes longer, and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDNUM.\r\n\r\nAs these mushrooms are slightly bitter, they must be washed, dried, and\r\nthrown into a little boiling water, to boil for just a moment; drain,\r\nand throw away this water, add a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful\r\nof salt, a dash of pepper, and a half cup of milk or stock; cover the\r\npan, and cook slowly for twenty minutes. As the milk scorches easily,\r\ncook over a very slow fire, or in a double boiler. Pour the mixture over\r\nslices of toast, and serve at once. A tablespoonful or two of sherry may\r\nbe added just as they are removed from the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAVARIA.\r\n\r\nWash, separating the bunches, and chop or cut them rather fine, measure,\r\nand to each quart allow a half pint of Supreme sauce. Throw the clavaria\r\ninto a saucepan, cover, and allow it to stew gently for fifteen minutes\r\nwhile you make the sauce. Put a tablespoonful of butter and one of flour\r\nin the saucepan; mix, and add a half pint of milk or chicken stock; or\r\nyou may add half of one and half of the other; stir until boiling; take\r\nfrom the fire, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper,\r\nand the yolks of two eggs. Take the clavaria from the fire, and when\r\ncool stir it into the sauce. Turn into a baking dish, sprinkle the top\r\nwith crumbs, and brown in a quick oven. Do not cook too long, as it will\r\nbecome watery.\r\n\r\n=Pickled Clavaria.=--Wash the clavaria thoroughly without breaking it\r\napart; put into a steamer; stand the steamer over a kettle of boiling\r\nwater, and steam rapidly, that is, keep the water boiling hard for\r\nfifteen minutes. Take from the fire, and cool. Put over the fire\r\nsufficient vinegar to cover the given quantity; to each quart, allow two\r\nbay leaves, six cloves, a teaspoonful of whole mustard, and a dozen\r\npepper corns, that is, whole peppers. Put the clavaria into glass jars.\r\nBring the vinegar to boiling point, and pour it over; seal and put\r\naside.\r\n\r\nThis may be served alone as any other pickle, or on lettuce leaves with\r\nFrench dressing as a salad.\r\n\r\n=Escalloped Clavaria.=--Wash, separate and cut the clavaria as in first\r\nrecipe. To each quart allow a half pint of chicken stock, a teaspoonful\r\nof salt, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Put a layer of bread crumbs\r\nin the bottom of the dish, then a layer of chopped clavaria, and so\r\ncontinue until you have the dish filled. Pour over the stock, which you\r\nhave seasoned with salt and pepper; dot bits of butter here and there\r\nover the top, and bake in a moderate oven thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is excellent for the young or button _Hypholoma_, except\r\nthat the time of baking must be forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUFF-BALLS.\r\n\r\nTo be eatable, the puff-balls must be perfectly white to the very\r\ncenter. Pare off the skin; cut them into slices; dust with salt and\r\npepper. Have ready in a large, shallow pan a sufficient quantity of hot\r\noil to cover the bottom. Throw in the slices and, when brown on one\r\nside, turn and brown on the other; serve at once on a heated dish.\r\n\r\n=A la Poulette.=--Pare the puff-balls; cut them into slices and then\r\ninto dice; put them into a saucepan, allowing a tablespoonful of butter\r\nto each pint of blocks. Cover the saucepan; stew gently for fifteen\r\nminutes; lift the lid; sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of\r\npepper. Beat the yolks of three eggs until light; add a half cup of\r\ncream and a half cup of milk; pour this into the hot mixture, and shake\r\nuntil smoking hot. Do not allow them to boil. Serve in a heated\r\nvegetable dish, with blocks of toast over the top.\r\n\r\n=Puff-Ball Omelet.=--Pare and cut into blocks sufficient puff-balls to\r\nmake a pint. Put a tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan; add the\r\npuff-balls, cover and cook for ten minutes. Beat six eggs without\r\nseparating, until thoroughly mixed, but not too light; add the cooked\r\npuff-balls, a level teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. Put a\r\ntablespoonful of butter into your omelet pan; when hot, turn in the egg\r\nmixture; shake over the hot fire until the bottom has thoroughly set,\r\nthen with a limber knife lift the edge, allowing the soft portion to run\r\nunderneath; continue this operation until the omelet is cooked through;\r\nfold and turn onto a heated dish. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nOther delicate mushrooms may be used in this same manner.\r\n\r\n=Puff-Balls with Agaricus campestris.=--As the _Agaricus campestris_ has\r\na rather strong flavor and the puff-balls are mild, both are better for\r\nbeing mixed in the cooking. Take equal quantities of _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_ and puff-balls; pare and cut the puff-balls into blocks; to\r\neach half pound allow a tablespoonful of butter. Put the butter in a\r\nsaucepan, add the mushrooms, sprinkle over the salt (allowing a half\r\nteaspoonful always to each pint); cover the saucepan and stew slowly for\r\ntwenty minutes. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour in a half cup of milk,\r\nadd it to the mixture, stir and cook for just a moment, add a dash of\r\npepper, and serve in a heated dish.\r\n\r\nThis recipe may be changed by omitting the flour and adding the yolks of\r\na couple of eggs; milk is preferable to stock, for all the white or\r\nlight-colored varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORCHELLA.\r\n\r\nSelect twelve large-sized morels; cut off the stalks, and throw them\r\ninto a saucepan of warm water; let them stand for fifteen minutes; then\r\ntake them on a skimmer one by one, and drain carefully. Chop fine\r\nsufficient cold boiled tongue or chicken to make one cupful; mix this\r\nwith an equal quantity of bread crumbs, and season with just a suspicion\r\nof onion juice, not more than ten drops, and a dash of pepper. Fill this\r\ninto the mushrooms, arrange them neatly in a baking pan, put in a half\r\ncup of stock and a tablespoonful of butter, bake in a moderate oven\r\nthirty minutes, basting frequently. When done, dish neatly. Boil down\r\nthe sauce that is in the pan until it is just sufficient to baste them\r\non the dish; serve at once.\r\n\r\n=A Second Method.=--Select large-sized morels; cut off the stalk; wash\r\nwell through several waters. Put into a frying pan a little butter,\r\nallowing about a tablespoonful to each dozen mushrooms. When hot, throw\r\nin the mushrooms, and toss until they are thoroughly cooked; then add a\r\nhalf pint of milk or stock; cover the vessel, and cook slowly twenty\r\nminutes; dust with salt and pepper, and serve in a vegetable dish. This\r\nmethod gives an exceedingly palatable and very sightly dish if garnished\r\nwith sweet Spanish peppers that have been boiled until tender.\r\n\r\n=Another Method.=--Remove the stems, and wash the morels as directed in\r\nthe preceding recipe. Make a stuffing of bread crumbs seasoned with\r\nsalt, pepper, chopped parsley, and sufficient melted butter to just\r\nmoisten. Place them in a baking pan; add a little stock and butter; bake\r\nfor thirty minutes. When done, dish. Into the pan in which they were\r\ncooked, turn a cupful of strained tomatoes; boil rapidly for fifteen\r\nminutes until slightly thickened; pour this over the mushrooms; garnish\r\nthe dish with triangular pieces of toasted bread, and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RECIPES.\r\n\r\nIn the following recipes one may use _Agaricus campestris_, _silvicola_,\r\n_arvensis_, or _Pleurotus ostreatus_, or _sapidus_, or _Coprinus\r\ncomatus_, or any kindred mushrooms. The _Agaricus campestris_, however,\r\nare to be preferred.\r\n\r\n=To Serve with a Boiled Leg of Mutton=, wash well the mushrooms and dry\r\nthem; dip each into flour, being careful not to get too much on the gill\r\nside. In a saucepan have a little hot butter or oil; drop these in, skin\r\nside down; dust them lightly with salt and pepper. After they have\r\nbrowned on this side, turn them quickly and brown the gills; add a half\r\npint of good stock; let them simmer gently for fifteen minutes. Take\r\nthem up with a skimmer, and dish them on a platter around the mutton.\r\nBoil the sauce down until it is the proper consistency; pour it over,\r\nand serve at once. These are also good to serve with roasted beef.\r\n\r\n=Mushroom Sauce for Game.=--Wash well one pound of fresh mushrooms; dry,\r\nand chop them very fine. Put them into a saucepan with one and a half\r\ntablespoonfuls of butter; cover, and cook slowly for eight minutes; then\r\nadd a half cup of fresh rubbed bread crumbs, a half teaspoonful of salt,\r\na saltspoon of white pepper; cover and cook again for five minutes;\r\nstir, add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and, if you like, two\r\ntablespoonfuls of sherry; turn into a sauce-boat.\r\n\r\n=A Nice Way to Serve with Fricassee of Chicken.=--Wash and dry the\r\nmushrooms; sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Put some oil or butter in\r\na shallow pan; when hot, throw in the mushrooms, skin side down; cover\r\nthe pan, put in the oven for fifteen minutes; baste them once during the\r\nbaking. Lift them carefully and put them on a heated dish. Add to the\r\nfat in the pan two tablespoonfuls of finely chopped mushrooms, a half\r\ncup of good stock; boil carefully for five minutes. Have ready rounds of\r\nbread toasted; dish the mushrooms on these; put on top a good sized\r\npiece of carefully boiled marrow; season the sauce with salt, and strain\r\nit over. Use these as a garnish around the edge of the plate, or you may\r\nsimply dish and serve them for breakfast, or as second course at lunch.\r\n\r\n=Oysters and Mushrooms.=--Wash and remove the stems from a half pound of\r\nfresh mushrooms; chop them fine; put them into a saucepan with a\r\ntablespoonful of butter, a half teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of\r\npepper; cover closely, and cook over a slow fire for ten minutes. Have\r\nready, washed and drained, twenty-five good sized fat oysters; throw\r\nthem perfectly dry into this mushroom mixture. Pull the saucepan over a\r\nbright fire; boil, stirring carefully, for about five minutes. Serve on\r\nsquares of carefully toasted bread.\r\n\r\n=Tomatoes Stuffed with Mushrooms.=--Wash perfectly smooth, solid\r\ntomatoes; cut a slice from the stem end, and remove carefully the seeds\r\nand core. To each tomato allow three good sized mushrooms; wash, dry,\r\nchop them fine, and stuff them into the tomatoes; put a half saltspoon\r\nof salt on the top of each and a dusting of pepper. Into a bowl put one\r\ncup of soft bread crumbs; season it with a half teaspoonful of salt and\r\na dash of pepper; pour over a tablespoonful of melted butter; heap this\r\nover the top of the tomato, forming a sort of pyramid, packing in the\r\nmushrooms; stand the tomatoes in a baking pan and bake in a moderate\r\noven one hour. Serve at once, lifting them carefully to prevent\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\nOr, the mushrooms may be chopped fine, put with a tablespoonful of\r\nbutter into a saucepan and cooked for five minutes before they are\r\nstuffed into the tomatoes; then the bread crumbs packed over the top,\r\nand the whole baked for twenty minutes. Each recipe will give you a\r\ndifferent flavor.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] The recipes for Agaricus are intended for the several species of\r\nthis genus (Psalliota).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY AND TOXICOLOGY OF MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nBy J. F. CLARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the chemical composition of mushrooms, we have in the past\r\nbeen limited largely to the work of European chemists. Recently,\r\nhowever, some very careful analyses of American mushrooms have been\r\nmade. The results of these investigations, while in general accord with\r\nthe work already done in Europe, have emphasized the fact that mushrooms\r\nare of very variable composition. That different species should vary\r\ngreatly was of course to be expected, but we now know that different\r\nspecimens of the same species grown under different conditions may be\r\nmarkedly different in chemical composition. The chief factors causing\r\nthis variation are the composition, the moisture content, and the\r\ntemperature of the soil in which they grow, together with the maturity\r\nof the plant. The temperature, humidity, and movement of the atmosphere\r\nand other local conditions have a further influence on the amount of\r\nwater present.\r\n\r\nThe following table, showing the amounts of the more important\r\nconstituents in a number of edible American species, has been compiled\r\nchiefly from a paper by L. B. Mendel (Amer. Jour. Phy. =1=: 225--238).\r\nThis article is one of the most recent and most valuable contributions\r\nto this important study, and anyone wishing to look into the methods of\r\nresearch, or desiring more detailed information than is here given, is\r\nreferred to the original paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TABLE I.\r\n\r\n  ===================================================================+\r\n                       |   FRESH   |     IN WATER-FREE MATERIAL.     |\r\n                       |  MATERIAL.|                                 |\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n                       |  W  | D M | T N| P N| E E| S I P A| F  | A  |\r\n                       |  A  | R A | O I| R I| T X| O N E L| I  | S  |\r\n                       |  T  | Y T | T T| O T| H T| L   R C| B  | H  |\r\n                       |  E  |   T | A R| T R| E R| U 8   O| R  |    |\r\n                       |  R  |   E | L O| E O| R A| B 5 C H| E  |    |\r\n                       |     |   R |   G| I G|   C| L   E O|    |    |\r\n                       |     |     |   E| D E|   T| E   N L|    |    |\r\n                       |     |     |   N|   N|    |     T  |    |    |\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n                       |  %  |  %  |  % |  % |  % |    %   |  % |  % |\r\n  Coprinus comatus     |92.19| 7.81|5.79|1.92| 3.3|    56.3| 7.3|12.5|\r\n                       |     |     |    |    |    |        |    |    |\r\n  Morchella esculenta  |89.54| 0.46|4.66|3.49| 4.8|    29.3| 8.7|10.4|\r\n                       |     |     |    |    |    |        |    |    |\r\n  Polyporus sulphureus |70.80| 9.20|3.29|2.23| 3.2|    27.8| 3.0| 7.3|\r\n                       |     |     |    |    |    |        |    |    |\r\n  Pleurotus ostreatus  |73.70| 6.30|2.40|1.13| 1.6|    31.5| 7.5| 6.1|\r\n                       |     |     |    |    |    |        |    |    |\r\n  Clitocybe multiceps  |89.61| 0.39|5.36|1.98| 6.0|    57.2| 9.6|11.5|\r\n                       |     |     |    |    |    |        |    |    |\r\n  Hypholoma            |88.97| 1.03|4.28|2.49| 2.5|    44.4|12.1|13.9|\r\n  candolleanum         |     |     |    |    |    |        |    |    |\r\n                       |     |     |    |    |    |        |    |    |\r\n  Agaricus campestris  | 91.8|  8.2|4.75|3.57|3.72|    --  | -- |11.6|\r\n  ===================================================================+\r\n\r\n=Water.=--Like all growing plants, the mushroom contains a very large\r\nproportion of water. The actual amount present varies greatly in\r\ndifferent species. In the above table it will be seen that _Polyporus\r\nsulphureus_, with over 70 per cent. of water, has the least of any\r\nspecies mentioned, while the species of _Coprinus_ and _Agaricus_ have\r\nusually fully 90 per cent. water. The amount of water present, however,\r\nvaries greatly in the same species at different seasons and in different\r\nlocalities, and with variations in the moisture content of soil and\r\natmosphere, also with the age and rapidity of development of the\r\nindividual plant.\r\n\r\n=Total Nitrogen.=--The proportion of nitrogen in the dry matter of\r\ndifferent species varies from 2 per cent. to 6 per cent. This\r\ncomparatively high nitrogen content was formerly taken to indicate an\r\nunusual richness in proteid substances, which in turn led to very\r\nerroneous ideas regarding the nutritive value of these plants. The\r\nnitrogenous substances will be more fully discussed later, when we\r\nconsider their nutritive value.\r\n\r\n=Ether Extract.=--This consists of a variety of fatty substances soluble\r\nin ether. It varies greatly in quality and quantity in different\r\nspecies. The amount is usually from 4 per cent. to 8 per cent. of the\r\ntotal dry matter. It includes, besides various other substances, several\r\nfree fatty acids and their glycerides, the acids of low melting point\r\nbeing most abundant. These fatty substances occur in the stem, but are\r\nmuch more abundant in the cap, especially in the fruiting portion. Just\r\nwhat nutritive value these fatty matters may have has never been\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n=Carbohydrates.=--The largest part of the dry matter of the mushrooms is\r\nmade up of various carbohydrates, including cellulose or fungocellulose,\r\nglycogen, mycoinuline, trehalose, mannite, glucose, and other related\r\nsubstances. The cellulose is present in larger proportion in the stem\r\nthan in the cap, and in the upper part of the cap than in the fruiting\r\nsurface. This is doubtless related to the sustaining and protective\r\nfunctions of the stem and the upper part of the cap. Starch, so common\r\nas a reserve food in the higher plants, does not occur in the mushrooms.\r\nAs is the case with the fats, no determination of the nutritive value of\r\nthese substances has been made, but it may be assumed that the soluble\r\ncarbohydrates of the mushrooms do not differ greatly from similar\r\ncompounds in other plants.\r\n\r\n=Ash.=--The ash of mushrooms varies greatly. _Polyporus officinalis_\r\ngives but 1.08 per cent. of ash in dry matter, _Pleurotus ulmarius_\r\ngives 12.6 per cent., and _Clitopilus prunulus_ gives 15 per cent. The\r\naverage of twelve edible species gave 7 per cent. ash in the stem and\r\n8.96 per cent. in the cap.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the constituents of the ash, potassium is by far the most\r\nabundant--the oxide averaging about 50 per cent. of the total ash.\r\nPhosphoric acid stands next to potassium in abundance and importance,\r\nconstituting, on an average, about one-third of the entire ash. Oxides\r\nof manganese and iron are always present; the former averaging about 3\r\nper cent. and the latter 5 per cent. to 2 per cent. of the ash. Sodium,\r\ncalcium, and chlorine are usually present in small and varying\r\nquantities. Sulphuric acid occurs in the ash of all fungi, and is\r\nremarkable for the great variation in quantity present in different\r\nspecies; e. g., ash of _Helvella esculenta_ contains 1.58 per cent.\r\nH_2SO_4 while that of _Agaricus campestris_ contains the relatively\r\nenormous amount of 24.29 per cent.\r\n\r\nAny discussion of the bare composition of a food is necessarily\r\nincomplete without a consideration of the nutritive value of the various\r\nconstituents. This is especially desirable in the case of the mushrooms,\r\nfor while they are frequently overestimated and occasionally\r\nridiculously overpraised by their friends, they are quite generally\r\ndistrusted and sometimes held in veritable abhorrence by those who are\r\nignorant of their many excellent qualities. On the one hand, we are told\r\nthat \"gastronomically and chemically considered the flesh of the\r\nmushroom has been proven to be almost identical with meat, and possesses\r\nthe same nourishing properties.\" We frequently hear them referred to as\r\n\"vegetable beefsteak,\" \"manna of the poor,\" and other equally\r\nextravagant and misleading terms. On the other hand, we see vast\r\nquantities of the most delicious food rotting in the fields and woods\r\nbecause they are regarded by the vast majority of the people as\r\n\"toadstools\" and as such particularly repulsive and poisonous.\r\n\r\nFoods may be divided into three classes according to the functions they\r\nperform:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To form the material of the body and repair its wastes.\r\n\r\n(_b_) To supply energy for muscular exertion and for the maintenance of\r\nthe body heat.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Relishes.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the body material and the repair of its wastes is the\r\nfunction of the proteids of foods. It has been found by careful\r\nexperiment that a man at moderately hard muscular exertion requires .28\r\nlb. of digestible proteids daily. The chief sources of our proteid foods\r\nare meats, fish, beans, etc. It has been as a proteid food that\r\nmushrooms have been most strongly recommended. Referring to Table I, it\r\nwill be seen that nitrogen constituted 5.79 per cent. of the total dry\r\nsubstance of _Coprinus comatus_. This high nitrogen content, which is\r\ncommon to the mushrooms in general, was formerly taken to indicate a\r\nvery unusual richness in proteid materials. It is now known, however,\r\nthat there were several sources of error in this assumption.\r\n\r\nMuch of the nitrogen is present in the form of non-proteid substances of\r\na very low food value. Another and very considerable portion enters into\r\nthe composition of a substance closely related to cellulose. A third\r\nsource of error was the assumption that all the proteid material was\r\ndigestible. It is now known that a very considerable portion is not\r\ndigestible and hence not available as food. Thus, notwithstanding the\r\n5.79 per cent. of nitrogen in _Coprinus comatus_, we find but .82 per\r\ncent. in the form of actually available (i. e., digestible) proteids, or\r\napproximately one-seventh of what was formerly supposed to be present.\r\n\r\nThe digestibility of the proteids varies very greatly with the species.\r\nMörner found the common field mushroom, _Agaricus campestris_, to have a\r\nlarger amount of proteids available than any other species studied by\r\nhim. Unfortunately, the digestibility of the American plant has not been\r\ntested. There is great need for further work along this line. Enough has\r\nbeen done, however, to demonstrate that mushrooms are no longer to be\r\nregarded as a food of the proteid class.\r\n\r\nThe energy for the muscular exertion and heat is most economically\r\nderived from the foods in which the carbohydrates and fats predominate.\r\n\r\nThe common way of comparing foods of the first two classes\r\nscientifically is to compare their heat-giving powers. The unit of\r\nmeasurement is termed a _calorie_. It represents the amount of heat\r\nrequired to raise a kilogram of water 1° Centigrade. (This is\r\napproximately the heat required to raise one pound of water 4°\r\nFahrenheit.) A man at moderately hard muscular labor requires daily\r\nenough food to give about 3500 _calories_ of heat-units. The major part\r\nof this food may be most economically derived from the foods of the\r\nsecond class, any deficiency in the .28 lb. of digestible protein being\r\nmade up by the addition of some food rich in this substance.\r\n\r\nIn the following table the value of ten pounds of several food\r\nsubstances of the three classes has been worked out. Especial attention\r\nis called to the column headed \"proteids\" and to the last column where\r\nthe number of heat-units which may be purchased for one cent at current\r\nmarket rates has been worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE II.\r\n\r\n            NUTRITIVE VALUE OF TEN POUNDS OF SEVERAL FOODS.\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================+\r\n                       |PROTEIDS.|FATS.| CARBO-  |CALORIES.|COST.|CALORIES|\r\n                       |         |     |HYDRATES.|         |     | FOR ONE|\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |  CENT. |\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  a. {Beef (round)     |     1.87|  .88|     ----|     7200|$1.50|     48.|\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n     {Beans (dried)    |     2.23|  .18|     5.91|    15900|  .30|    530.|\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n  b. {Cabbage          |      .18|  .03|      .49|     1400|  .15|     93.|\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n     {Potatoes         |      .18|  .01|     1.53|     3250|  .10|    325.|\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n     {Flour (roller    |     1.13|  .11|     7.46|    16450|  .25|    658.|\r\n       process)        |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n  c. {Coprinus comatus |      .04| .025|     .434|      987| 2.50|     3.9|\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n     {Pleurotus        |     .051| .042|     .828|     1811| 2.50|     7.2|\r\n       ostreatus       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n     {Morchella        |     .094|  .05|     .306|      955| 2.50|     3.8|\r\n       esculenta       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n     {Agaricus         |      .18|  .03|      .46|     1316| 2.50|     5.3|\r\n       campestris      |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n                       |         |     |         |         |     |        |\r\n     {Oysters          |      .61|  .14|      .33|     2350| 2.00|    11.7|\r\n  ========================================================================+\r\n\r\nThe mushrooms have been valued at 25 cents per pound, which is probably\r\nconsiderably below the average market price for a good article. It\r\nshould also be remarked that the amounts given in this table are the\r\ndigestible and hence available constituents of the foods. The only\r\nexception to this is in the case of the fats and carbohydrates of the\r\nmushrooms, no digestion experiments having been reported on these\r\nconstituents. In the absence of data we have assumed that they were\r\nentirely digested.\r\n\r\nThe beef and beans are typical animal and vegetable foods of the proteid\r\nclass. A glance at the table will show how markedly they differ from the\r\nmushrooms. The latter are nearest the cabbage in composition and\r\nnutritive value. The similarity between the cabbage and the _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_ here analyzed is very striking. The potato is somewhat\r\npoorer in fat, but very much richer than the mushroom in carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nThe figures in the last column will vary of course with fluctuations in\r\nthe market price, but such variation will not interfere at any time with\r\nthe demonstration that _purchased_ mushrooms are not a poor man's food.\r\nHere we find that one cent invested in cabbage at 1-1/2 cents per pound,\r\ngives 93 _calories_ of nutrition, while the same amount invested in\r\n_Agaricus campestris_--the common mushroom of our markets--would give\r\nbut 5.3 _calories_, although they are almost identical so far as\r\nnutritive value is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe same sum invested in wheat flour, with its high carbohydrate and\r\ngood proteid content, would yield 658 _calories_ or one-sixth the amount\r\nnecessary to sustain a man at work for one day. The amount of mushrooms\r\nnecessary for the same result is a matter of simple computation.\r\n\r\nMushrooms, however, have a distinct and very great value as a food of\r\nthe third class, that is, as condiments or food accessories, and their\r\nvalue as such is beyond the computation of the chemist or the\r\nphysiologist, and doubtless varies with different individuals. They are\r\namong the most appetizing of table delicacies and add greatly to the\r\npalatability of many foods when cooked with them. It is surely as unfair\r\nto decry the mushroom on account of its low nutritive value, as it is\r\nwrong to attribute to it qualities which are nothing short of absurd in\r\nview of its composition. In some respects its place as a food is not\r\nunlike that of the oyster, celery, berries, and other delicacies. Worked\r\nout on the basis of nutritive value alone they would all be condemned;\r\nthe oyster for instance presents a showing but little better than the\r\nmushroom, and vastly inferior, so far as economy is concerned, to the\r\ncommon potato. This, too, for oysters purchased by the quart. The\r\nnutritive value of one cent's worth of oysters \"on the half shell\" would\r\nbe interesting!\r\n\r\nThe question of the toxicology of the higher fungi is one of very great\r\ntheoretical and practical interest. But on account of the great\r\ndifficulties in the way of such investigations comparatively little has\r\nyet been accomplished. A few toxic compounds belonging chiefly to the\r\nclass termed alkaloids have, however, been definitely isolated.\r\n\r\n=Choline.=--This alkaloid is of wide occurrence in the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms. It has been isolated from _Amanita muscaria_, _A.\r\npantherina_, _Boletus luridus_, and _Helvella esculenta_. It is not very\r\ntoxic, but on uniting with oxygen it passes over to muscarine. According\r\nto Kobert the substance formed from choline on the decay of the\r\nmushrooms containing it is not muscarine, but a very closely related\r\nalkaloid, _neurin_. This transformation of a comparatively harmless\r\nalkaloid to an extremely deadly one simply by the partial decay of the\r\nplant in which the former is normally found, emphasizes very much the\r\nwisdom of rejecting for table use all specimens which are not entirely\r\nfresh. This advice applies to all kinds of mushrooms, and to worm-eaten\r\nand otherwise injured, as well as decayed ones. Neurin is almost\r\nidentical in its physiological effects with muscarine, which is\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\n=Muscarine.=--This is the most important because the most dangerous\r\nalkaloid found in the mushrooms. It is most abundant in _Amanita\r\nmuscaria_, it is also found in considerable quantity in _Amanita\r\npantherina_, and to a lesser, but still very dangerous extent in\r\n_Boletus luridus_ and _Russula emetica_. It is quite probably identical\r\nwith bulbosine, isolated from _Amanita phalloides_ by Boudier.\r\n_Muscarine_ is an extremely violent poison, .003 to .005 of a gram (.06\r\ngrain) being a very dangerous dose for a man. Like other constituents of\r\nmushrooms, the amount of muscarine present varies very greatly with\r\nvarying conditions of soil and climate. This, indeed, may account for\r\nthe fact that _Boletus luridus_ is regarded as an edible mushroom in\r\ncertain parts of Europe, the environment being such that little or no\r\nmuscarine is developed.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kobert, _Amanita muscaria_ contains, besides choline and\r\nmuscarine, a third alkaloid, _pilz-atropin_. This alkaloid, like\r\nordinary atropin, neutralizes to a greater or less extent the muscarine.\r\nThe amount of pilz-atropin present varies, as other constituents of\r\nmushrooms vary, with varying conditions of soil, climate, etc., and it\r\nmay be that in those localities where the _Amanita muscaria_ is used for\r\nfood the conditions are favorable for a large production of pilz-atropin\r\nwhich neutralizes the muscarine, thus making the plant harmless. Be\r\nthis as it may, _Amanita muscaria_, so deadly as ordinarily found, is\r\nundoubtedly used quite largely as food in parts of France and Russia,\r\nand it has been eaten repeatedly in certain localities in this country\r\nwithout harm.\r\n\r\nFortunately muscarine has a very unpleasant taste. It is interesting in\r\nthis connection to note that the _Amanita muscaria_ is said to be used\r\nby the inhabitants of Northern Russia--particularly the Koraks--as a\r\nmeans of inducing intoxication. To overcome the extremely unpleasant\r\ntaste of the plant they swallow pieces of the dried cap without chewing\r\nthem, or boil them in water and drink the decoction with other\r\nsubstances which disguise the taste.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning with muscarine are not at once evident, as is\r\nthe case with several of the less virulent poisons. They usually appear\r\nin from one-half to two hours. For the symptoms in detail we shall quote\r\nfrom Mr. V. K. Chestnut, Dept. of Agr., Washington (Circular No. 13,\r\nDiv. of Bot.): \"Vomiting and diarrhoea almost always occur, with a\r\npronounced flow of saliva, suppression of the urine, and various\r\ncerebral phenomena beginning with giddiness, loss of confidence in one's\r\nability to make ordinary movements, and derangements of vision. This is\r\nsucceeded by stupor, cold sweats, and a very marked weakening of the\r\nheart's action. In case of rapid recovery the stupor is short and\r\nusually marked with mild delirium. In fatal cases the stupor continues\r\nfrom one to two or three days, and death at last ensues from the gradual\r\nweakening and final stoppage of the heart's action.\"\r\n\r\nThe treatment for poisoning by muscarine consists primarily in removing\r\nthe unabsorbed portion of the mushroom from the alimentary canal and in\r\ncounteracting the effect of muscarine on the heart. The action of this\r\norgan should be fortified at once by the subcutaneous injection, by a\r\nphysician, of atropine in doses of from one one-hundredth to\r\none-fiftieth of a grain. The strongest emetics, such as sulphate of zinc\r\nor apomorphine, should be used, though in case of profound stupor even\r\nthese may not produce the desired action. Freshly ignited charcoal or\r\ntwo grains of a one per cent. alkaline solution of permanganate of\r\npotash may then be administered, in order, in the case of the former\r\nsubstance, to absorb the poison, or, in the case of the latter, to\r\ndecompose it. This should be followed by oils or oleaginous purgatives,\r\nand the intestines should be cleaned and washed out with an enema of\r\nwarm water and turpentine.\r\n\r\nExperiments on animals poisoned by _Amanita muscaria_ and with pure\r\nmuscarine show very clearly that when the heart has nearly ceased to\r\nbeat it may be stimulated to strong action almost instantly by the use\r\nof atropine. Its use as thus demonstrated has been the means of saving\r\nnumerous lives. We have in this alkaloid an almost perfect physiological\r\nantidote for muscarine, and therefore in such cases of poisoning its use\r\nshould be pushed as heroically as the symptoms of the case will warrant.\r\nThe presence of phallin in _Amanita muscaria_ is possible, and its\r\nsymptoms should be looked for in the red color of the blood serum\r\ndischarged from the intestines.\r\n\r\n=Phallin.=--The exact chemical nature of this extremely toxic substance\r\nis not certainly known, but it is generally conceded to be of an\r\nalbuminous nature. That it is an extremely deadly poison is shown by the\r\nfact that .0015 grain per 2 lbs. weight of the animal is a fatal dose\r\nfor cats and dogs. It is the active principle of the most deadly of all\r\nmushrooms, the _Amanita phalloides_, or death-cup fungus. We quote again\r\nfrom Mr. Chestnut's account of phallin and its treatment: \"The\r\nfundamental injury is not due, as in the case of muscarine, to a\r\nparalysis of the nerves controlling the action of the heart, but to a\r\ndirect effect on the blood corpuscles. These are quickly dissolved by\r\nphallin, the blood serum escaping from the blood vessels into the\r\nalimentary canal, and the whole system being rapidly drained of its\r\nvitality. No bad taste warns the victim, nor do the preliminary symptoms\r\nbegin until nine to fourteen hours after the poisonous mushrooms are\r\neaten. There is then considerable abdominal pain and there may be cramps\r\nin the legs and other nervous phenomena, such as convulsions, and even\r\nlockjaw or other kinds of tetanic spasms. The pulse is weak, the\r\nabdominal pain is rapidly followed by nausea, vomiting, and extreme\r\ndiarrhoea, the intestinal discharges assuming the 'rice-water'\r\ncondition characteristic of cholera. The latter symptoms are\r\npersistently maintained, generally without loss of consciousness, until\r\ndeath ensues, which happens in from two to four days. There is no known\r\nantidote by which the effects of phallin can be counteracted. The\r\nundigested material, if not already vomited, should, however, be removed\r\nfrom the stomach and intestines by methods similar to those given for\r\ncases of poisoning by _Amanita muscaria_.\r\n\r\n\"After that the remainder of the poison, if the amount of phallin\r\nalready taken up by the system is not too large, may wear itself out on\r\nthe blood and the patient may recover. It is suggested that this\r\nwearing-out process may be assisted by transfusing into the veins blood\r\nfreshly taken from some warm-blooded animal. The depletion of the blood\r\nserum might be remedied by similar transfusions of salt and warm water.\"\r\n\r\n=Helvellic Acid.=--This very deadly poison is sometimes found in\r\n_Helvella esculenta_ Persoon (Gyromitra esculenta), particularly in old\r\nor decaying specimens. It has been studied and named by Boehm. It is\r\nquite soluble in hot water, and in some localities this species of\r\n_Helvella_ is always parboiled--the water being thrown away--before it\r\nis prepared for the table. It seems to be quite generally agreed that\r\nyoung and perfectly fresh specimens are free from the poison. As the\r\npoison is very violent, however, this plant should be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms resemble in a very marked degree those of the deadly\r\nphallin, the dissolution of the red corpuscles of the blood being one of\r\nthe most marked and most dangerous; this is accompanied by nausea,\r\nvomiting, jaundice, and stoppage of the kidneys. There is no known\r\nantidote for this poison, hence the little that can be done would be\r\nsimilar to that mentioned under phallin.\r\n\r\nWhen poisoning by mushrooms is suspected, one cannot too strongly urge\r\nthat the services of a competent physician should be secured with the\r\nleast possible delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF TERMS APPLIED TO CERTAIN STRUCTURAL CHARACTERS OF\r\nMUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nBy H. HASSELBRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fungi, as in higher plants, each organ or part of the plant is\r\nsubject to a great number of variations which appeal to the eye of the\r\nstudent, and by which he recognizes relationship among the various\r\nindividuals, species, and genera of this group. For the purpose of\r\nsystematic studies of mushrooms or even for the recognition of a few\r\nspecies, it is of primary importance to be acquainted with terms used in\r\ndescribing different types of variation. Only a few of the more\r\nimportant terms, such as are employed in this book, together with\r\ndiagrams illustrating typical cases to which they are applied, will be\r\ngiven here.\r\n\r\n=The pileus.=--The _pileus_ or _cap_ is the first part of a mushroom\r\nwhich attracts the attention of the collector. It is the fleshy fruit\r\nbody of the plant. This, like all other parts of the mushroom, is made\r\nup, not of cellular tissue as we find it in flowering plants, but of\r\nnumerous interwoven threads, called _hyphæ_, which constitute the flesh\r\nor _trama_ of the pileus. Ordinarily, the filamentous structure of the\r\nflesh is very obvious when a thin section of the cap is examined under\r\nthe microscope, but in certain genera, as _Russula_ and _Lactarius_,\r\nmany branches of the _hyphæ_ become greatly enlarged, forming little\r\nvesicles or bladders. These vesicles lie in groups all through the flesh\r\nof the pileus, sometimes forming the greater part of its substance. The\r\nfilamentous _hyphæ_ pass around and through these groups, filling up the\r\ninterstices. In cross section this tissue resembles parenchyma, and\r\nappears as if it were made up of rounded cells. Such a trama is said to\r\nbe _vesiculose_ to distinguish it from the ordinary or _floccose_ trama.\r\nThe threads on the outer surface of the pileus constitute the cortex or\r\ncuticle. They are thick walled and often contain coloring matter which\r\ngives the plants their characteristic color. In many species their walls\r\nbecome gelatinized, covering the outside of the pileus with a viscid,\r\nslimy, or glutinous layer, often called _pellicle_. In other instances\r\nthe corticle layer ceases to grow with the pileus. It is then torn and\r\nsplit by the continued expanding of the rest of the plant, and remains\r\non the surface in the form of hairs, fibers, scales, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 239. Portion of vesiculose trama in the pileus of\r\na Russula.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 240. Portion of a floccose trama.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of the most usual form of the pileus, we may take that of\r\nthe common mushroom (_Agaricus campestris_) when it is nearly expanded.\r\nThe pileus is then quite regular in outline and evenly _convex_ (Fig.\r\n243). Many mushrooms during the early stages of their development have\r\nthis form, which is variously changed by later growth. The convex\r\npileus usually becomes _plane_ or _expanded_ as it grows. If the\r\nconvexity is greater it is said to be _campanulate_ (Fig. 245), _conical\r\nhemispherical_, etc., terms which need no explanation. The pileus is\r\n_umbilicate_ when it has an abrupt, sharp depression at the center (Fig.\r\n241), _infundibuliform_ when the margin is much higher than the center,\r\nso that the cap resembles a funnel (Fig. 244), and _depressed_ when the\r\ncenter is less, or irregularly, sunken. When the center of the pileus is\r\nraised in the form of a boss or knob it is _umbonate_ (Fig. 242). The\r\numbo may have the form of a sharp elevation at the center, or it may be\r\nrounded or obtuse, occupying a larger part of the disc. When it is\r\nirregular or indistinct the pileus is said to be _gibbous_ (Fig. 246).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 241. FIGURE 242. FIGURE 243.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 241.--Omphalia campanella, pileus umbilicate, gills decurrent.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 242.--Lepiota procera, pileus convex, umbonate; annulus free,\r\nmovable; gills free.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 243.--Agaricus campestris, pileus convex, gills free.]\r\n\r\n=The gills.=--The _gills_ or _lamellæ_ are thin blades on the under\r\nside of the pileus, radiating from the stem to the margin. When the\r\npileus is cut in halves the general outline of the gills may be\r\nobserved. In outline they may be broad, narrow, lanceolate, triangular,\r\netc. In respect to their ends they are _attenuate_ when gradually\r\nnarrowed to a sharp point, _acute_ when they end in a sharp angle, and\r\n_obtuse_ when the ends are rounded. Again, the gills are _arcuate_ when\r\nthey arch from the stem to the edge of the pileus, and _ventricose_ when\r\nthey are bellied out vertically toward the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 244.\r\n\r\nClitocybe infundibuliformis, pileus infundibuliform, gills decurrent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 245.\r\n\r\nMycena galericulata, pileus conic to campanulate, gills decurrent by a\r\ntooth, stem fistulose.]\r\n\r\nThe terms given above are often used in descriptive works, but the most\r\nimportant feature to be noted in the section of the plant is the\r\nrelation of the gills to the stem. This relation is represented by\r\nseveral distinct types which are sometimes used to limit genera or\r\nsub-genera, since the mode of attachment is usually constant in all\r\nspecies of a group. The principal relations of the gills to the stem are\r\ndescribed as follows: _Adnate_ when they reach the stem and are set\r\nsquarely against it (Fig. 247); _decurrent_ when they run down the stem\r\n(Fig. 244); _sinuate_ or _emarginate_ when they have a notch or vertical\r\ncurve at the posterior end (Fig. 246); and _free_ when they are rounded\r\noff without reaching the stem (Fig. 243). In all cases when the lamellæ\r\nreach the stem and are only attached by the upper angle they are said to\r\nbe _adnexed_. This term is often used in combination with others, as\r\n_sinuate-adnexed_ (Fig. 248, small figure), or _ascending adnexed_ (Fig.\r\n248, larger plant). Sometimes the lamellæ are adnate, adnexed, etc., and\r\nhave a slight decurrent process or tooth as in _Mycena galericulata_\r\n(Fig. 245). In many plants the gills separate very readily from the stem\r\nwhen the plants are handled. Sometimes merely the expansion of the\r\npileus tears them away, so that it is necessary to use great caution,\r\nand often to examine plants in different stages of development to\r\ndetermine the real condition of the lamellæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 246. FIGURE 247. FIGURE 248.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 246.--Tricholoma, gills sinuate, stipe solid.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 247.--Panæolus papilionaceus, gills adnate.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 248.--Left-hand small plant, Hygrophorus, gills sinuate, adnexed.\r\nRight-hand plant Panæolus retirugis, gills ascending adnexed, veil\r\nappendiculate.]\r\n\r\nIn certain genera the gills have special characteristics which may be\r\nnoted here. Usually the edge of the lamellæ is _acute_ or sharp like the\r\nblade of a knife, but in _Cantharellus_ and _Trogia_ the edges are very\r\nblunt or obtuse. In extreme forms the lamellæ are reduced to mere veins\r\nor ridges. Again, the edge is generally _entire_, i. e., not noticeably\r\ntoothed, but in _Lentinus_ it is often toothed or cut in various ways.\r\nIn some other plants the edges are _serrulate_, _crenulate_, etc. In\r\n_Schizophyllum alneum_, a small whitish plant very common on dead\r\nsticks, the gills are split lengthwise along the edge with the halves\r\nrevolute, i. e., rolled back. In _Coprinus_ the gills and often a large\r\npart of the pileus melt at maturity into a dark, inky fluid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 249.--Section of portion of gill of Marasmius\r\ncohærens. _t_, trama of gill; _sh_, sub-hymenium; _h_, hymenium layer.\r\nThe long, dark cells are brown cystidia, termed spicules by some to\r\ndistinguish them from the colorless cystidia. The long cells bearing the\r\noval spores are the basidia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 250.--Inocybe repanda (Bull.) Bres. (= Entoloma\r\nrepandum Bull.). _t_, trama of pileus; _sh_, sub-hymenium; _h_, the\r\nhymenial layer; the long cells with a drop of moisture at the ends are\r\ncystidia (sing. cystidium).]\r\n\r\n=The hymenium.=--The term _hymenium_ is applied to the spore-bearing\r\ntissue of many fungi. In the _Agaricaceæ_ the hymenium covers the entire\r\nsurface of the gills and usually the portion of the pileus between the\r\ngills. It originates in the following manner: the threads forming the\r\ntrama of the gills grow out from the lower side of the pileus and\r\nperpendicular to its under surface. As growth advances many branches of\r\nthe threads turn outward toward either surface of the gill and finally\r\nterminate in club-shaped cells. These cells, therefore, lie side by\r\nside, perpendicular to the surface, forming a pavement, as it were,\r\nover the entire surface of the gills. Some of them put out four little\r\nprongs, on each of which a spore is borne, while others simply remain as\r\nsterile cells (Figs. 249, 250). The spore-bearing cells are _basidia_;\r\nthe others are called _paraphyses_. They resemble each other very much,\r\nexcept that the basidia bear four _sterigmata_ and a spore on each. In a\r\nfew species the number of sterigmata is reduced to two and in some low\r\nforms the number is variable. The layer just beneath the basidia is\r\nusually more or less modified, being often composed of small cells\r\ndifferent from the rest of the trama. This is called the _sub-hymenial_\r\nlayer or _sub-hymenium_ (Fig. 250).\r\n\r\nOther cells called _cystidia_ occur in the hymenia of various species\r\ndistributed through nearly all the genera of the agarics. Cystidia are\r\nlarge, usually inflated, cells which project above the rest of the\r\nhymenium (Fig. 250). They originate either like the basidia, from the\r\nsub-hymenial cells (Fig. 250), or from special hyphæ deeper down in the\r\ntrama of the gill (Fig. 249). They are scattered over the entire surface\r\nof the hymenium, but become more numerous on the edge of the lamellæ.\r\nTheir number is much smaller than that of the basidia, but in some\r\nspecies where they are colored they may greatly change the appearance of\r\nthe gills. Cystidia often secrete moisture which collects in drops at\r\ntheir tips, a phenomenon common to all free fungous cells.\r\n\r\n=The stem.=--The stem is usually fixed to the center of the pileus, but\r\nit may be _eccentric_, i. e., fixed to one side of the center, or\r\nentirely lateral. When the stem is wanting the pileus is _sessile_. With\r\nregard to its interior the stem is _solid_, when it is evenly fleshy\r\nthroughout (Fig. 246), or _hollow_ when the interior is occupied by a\r\ncavity (Fig. 248). If the cavity is narrow and tubular the stem is\r\n_fistulose_ (Fig. 245); and if the center is filled with a pithy\r\nsubstance it is _stuffed_ (Fig. 243). These terms apply only to the\r\nnatural condition of the stem, and not the condition brought about by\r\nlarvæ, which eat out the interior of the stem, causing it to be hollow\r\nor fistulose.\r\n\r\nThe terms applicable to the consistency of the stem are difficult to\r\ndefine. In general, stems may be either _fleshy_ or _cartilaginous_. The\r\nmeaning of these terms can best be learned by careful study of specimens\r\nof each, but a few general characters can be given here. Fleshy, fibrous\r\nstems occur in the genera _Clitocybe_ and _Tricholoma_, among the\r\nwhite-spored forms. Their consistency is like that of the pileus,\r\nnamely, made up of fleshy, fibrous tissue. They are usually stout,\r\ncompared with the size of the plant, and when bent or broken they seem\r\nto be more or less spongy or tough, fibrous, so that they do not snap\r\nreadily. Cartilaginous stems have a consistency resembling that of\r\ncartilage. Their texture is always different from that of the pileus,\r\nwhich is fleshy or membranous. In general such stems are rather slender,\r\nin many genera rather thin, but firm. When bent sufficiently they either\r\nsnap suddenly, or break like a green straw, without separating. In\r\nregard to their external appearance some resemble fibrous stems, while\r\nothers are smooth and polished as in _Mycena_ and _Omphalia_.\r\n\r\n=The veil.=--In the young stages of development the margin of the pileus\r\nlies in close contact with the stipe, the line of separation being\r\nindicated by a kind of furrow which runs around the young button\r\nmushroom. In many genera, as _Collybia_, _Mycena_, _Omphalia_, etc., the\r\npileus simply expands without having its margin ever united to the stipe\r\nby any special structure, but in other forms, which include by far the\r\ngreater number of genera of the _Agaricaceæ_ and some _Boleti_, the\r\ninterval between the stem and pileus is bridged over by threads growing\r\nfrom the margin of the pileus and from the outer layers of the stem.\r\nThese threads interlace to form a delicate membrane, known as the\r\n_veil_, which closes the gap between the stem and pileus and covers over\r\nthe young hymenium.\r\n\r\nThe veil remains firm for a time, but it is finally torn by the\r\nexpanding pileus, and its remnants persist on the cap and stem in the\r\nform of various appendages, whose character depends on the character of\r\nthe veil. In _Cortinarius_ the veil is made up of delicate threads\r\nextending radially from the stem to the margin of the cap without\r\nforming a true membrane. From its resemblance to a spider's web such a\r\nveil is said to be _arachnoid_. At maturity mere traces of it can be\r\nfound on the stem. In many genera the veil consists of a delicate\r\nmembrane which tears away from the stem and hangs in flakes to the\r\nmargin of the pileus. In these cases the veil is _appendiculate_ (Fig.\r\n248). Frequently it is so delicate that no trace of it remains on the\r\nmature plant. Where the veil is well developed it usually remains on the\r\nstem as a _ring_ or _annulus_ which becomes free and movable in species\r\nof _Lepiota_ (Fig. 242) and _Coprinus_, or forms a hanging annular\r\ncurtain in _Amanita_, or a thick, felty ring in _Agaricus_, etc. In some\r\nplants (species of _Lepiota_) the annulus is continuous with the outer\r\ncortex of the stem, which then appears as if it were partially enclosed\r\nin a sheath, with the annulus forming a fringe on the upper end of the\r\nsheath, from which the apex of the stem projects.\r\n\r\nNo reference is here made to the _volva_, which encloses the entire\r\nplant, and which is described in connection with the genera in which it\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nThe few typical characters described here will help the student to\r\nbecome familiar with terms applied to them. In nature, however, typical\r\ncases rarely exist, and it is often necessary to draw distinction\r\nbetween differences so slight that it is almost impossible to describe\r\nthem. Only by patient study and a thorough acquaintance with the\r\ncharacters of each genus can one hope to become familiar with the many\r\nmushrooms growing in our woods and fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL KEYS.\r\n\r\nBy the Author.\r\n\r\nCLASS FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUB-CLASS BASIDIOMYCETES.[F]\r\n\r\nPlants of large or medium size; fleshy, membranaceous, leathery, woody\r\nor gelatinous; growing on the ground, on wood or decaying organic\r\nmatter; usually saprophytic, more rarely parasitic.
