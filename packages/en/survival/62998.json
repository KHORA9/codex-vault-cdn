This difficulty has been due for the most part to the following\r\ncauses: (1) To cutting the plants at an improper stage of development,\r\n(2) to the use of machinery not adapted to the handling of the crop,\r\n(3) to the shedding of immature pods, and (4) possibly to the lack of\r\npollination. As the first two have been overcome, mainly because of a\r\nbetter understanding of the requirements for handling this crop, the\r\nsubject matter of this bulletin is concerned primarily with the factors\r\nwhich produce the third and fourth causes.\r\n\r\nWhere the production of seed was disappointing although the plants\r\nproduced an abundance of flowers, it has been observed that many\r\napparently were not fertilized, or if fertilized the pods aborted. In\r\norder to obtain data in regard to the causes of the failure of sweet\r\nclover to produce a normal seed yield, a study was made of the insects\r\nwhich were most active in pollinating the flowers, the source of the\r\npollen necessary to effect fertilization, and the conditions under\r\nwhich the flowers must be pollinated in order to become fertilized.\r\nThe relation of environmental conditions to the shedding of immature\r\npods was also investigated. In order to overcome local environmental\r\nfactors as much as possible, the experiments were conducted on the\r\nGovernment Experiment Farm at Arlington, Va., and in cooperation with\r\nthe botanical department of the Iowa State College at Ames, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS OF THE POLLINATION OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nSince Darwin (4, p. 360)[1] published the statement that a plant of\r\n_Melilotus officinalis_ protected from insect visitation produced but\r\na very few seeds, while an unprotected plant produced many, other\r\nscientists have investigated this subject. Knuth (19, v. 1, p. 37),\r\nin giving a list of the best known cases of self-sterility in plants,\r\nmentions _Melilotus officinalis_. The same author (19, v. 2, p. 282)\r\nstates that since the stigma projects beyond the anthers, automatic\r\nself-pollination is difficult, and for the same reasons Müller (29, p.\r\n180) believes that self-fertilization is not apt to occur.\r\n\r\n[1] The serial numbers in parentheses refer to \"Literature cited,\"\r\npages 36-38.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Kirchner (18, p. 7) covered a number of _Melilotus alba_\r\nracemes with nets. On one of the plants 12 protected racemes produced\r\n187 seeds and on another plant only one seed was obtained from\r\n10 covered racemes. This experiment was duplicated in 1904, with\r\nthe result that 40 netted racemes produced an average of 38 seeds\r\neach. Kirchner concluded from this experiment that spontaneous\r\nself-pollination occurs regularly even though the stigma projects above\r\nthe anthers. He (18, p. 8) also performed an experiment with _Melilotus\r\nofficinalis_ in 1901. At this time 16 isolated racemes produced a total\r\nof 11 seeds. This experiment was repeated in 1904, with the result\r\nthat 16 protected racemes produced an average of 14 seeds each. As\r\nthe racemes on one of the plants that was protected in 1904 died,\r\nKirchner concluded that the flowers of _M. officinalis_ were especially\r\nsensitive to inclosure in nets and that the failures to obtain more\r\nthan a very few seeds on protected racemes in Darwin's experiment and\r\nin his first experiment were due to this cause.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kerner (17, v. 2, p. 399) the peas and lentils (Pisum and\r\nErvum) and the different species of horned clover and stone clover\r\n(Lotus and Melilotus) as well as the numerous species of the genus\r\nTrifolium and also many others produce seeds when insects are excluded\r\nfrom the plants, and only isolated species of these genera gave poor\r\nyields without insect visitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF POLLINATING EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe yield of sweet-clover seed varies greatly from year to year in many\r\nparts of the United States. It has been assumed that this variation\r\nwas due to climatic conditions, as excellent seed crops were seldom\r\nharvested in seasons of excessive rainfall or of prolonged drought just\r\npreceding or during the flowering period. The lack of a sufficient\r\nnumber of suitable pollinating insects also was thought to be an\r\nimportant factor in reducing seed production. This was especially true\r\nwhere the acreage of sweet clover was large and where few, if any,\r\nhoneybees were kept.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain data upon the factors influencing the yield of\r\nseed, a series of experiments was outlined to determine (1) whether\r\nthe flowers are able to set seed without the assistance of outside\r\nagencies, (2) whether cross-pollination is necessary, (3) the different\r\nkinds of insects which are active agents in pollinating sweet clover,\r\nand (4) whether a relation exists between the quantity of moisture in\r\nthe soil and the production of seed.\r\n\r\nThe racemes containing the flowers which were to be pollinated by hand\r\nwere covered with tarlatan before any of the flowers opened and were\r\nkept covered except while being pollinated until the seeds were nearly\r\nmature. This cloth has about twice as many meshes to the linear inch as\r\nordinary mosquito netting and served to exclude all insects that are\r\nable to pollinate the flowers. When entire plants were to be protected\r\nfrom all outside agencies, cages covered with cheesecloth, glass\r\nframes, or wire netting were used.\r\n\r\nA preliminary study of the pollination of _Melilotus alba_ and _M.\r\nofficinalis_ showed that both were visited by the same kinds of insects\r\nand that both required the same methods of pollination in order to set\r\nseed. On this account _M. alba_ was used in most of the experiments\r\nreported in this bulletin. Where _M. officinalis_ was employed it is so\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE FLOWERS OF MELILOTUS ALBA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Different parts of the flower of\r\n_Melilotus alba_: 1, Side view of the flower; 2, side view of the\r\nflower with the carina and alæ slightly depressed; 3, side view of the\r\nflower, showing the carina and alæ depressed sufficiently to expose\r\nthe staminal tube and the tenth free stamen; 4, ala; 5, ate and carina\r\nspread apart to show their relative position and shape; 6, flower after\r\nthe petals have been removed, showing in detail the calyx and staminal\r\ntube; 7, the staminal tube split open to show the relative size and\r\nposition of the pistil, _a_, Alæ; _b_, vexillum; _c_, carina; _d_,\r\ncalyx; _c_, stigma; _b_, anthers: _g_, tenth free stamen; _h_, digitate\r\nprocess of the superior basal angle of an ala; _i_, depressions in the\r\nala; _j_, staminal tube; _k_, pistil.]\r\n\r\nThe racemes of _Melilotus alba_ contain from 10 to 120 flowers with\r\nan average of approximately 50 per raceme for all of the racemes of a\r\nplant growing under cultivation in a field containing a good stand.\r\n\r\nThe flower consists of a green, smooth, or slightly pubescent calyx\r\nwith 5-pointed lobes and with an irregular white corolla of five\r\npetals. (Fig. 1.) The claws of the petals are not united nor are they\r\nattached to the staminal tube which is formed by the union of the\r\nfilaments of the nine inferior stamens. As the claws of the alæ and\r\ncarina are not attacked to the staminal tube; the petals may be bent\r\ndownward sufficiently far so that many different kinds of insects may\r\nsecure without difficulty the nectar secreted around the base of the\r\novary.\r\n\r\nThe fingerlike processes of the alæ are appressed closely to the\r\ncarina, therefore the alæ are bent downward with the carina by insects.\r\nThese processes grasp the staminal tube superiorly and tightly when\r\nthe carina and alæ are in their natural positions, but when the carina\r\nis pressed downward by insects the fingerlike processes open slightly\r\nbut not so far that they do not spring back to their original position\r\nwhen the pressure is removed. The staminal tube splits superiorly to\r\nadmit the tenth free stamen. The filament of this superior stamen lies\r\nalong the side of this staminal tube. The filaments of the nine stamens\r\nwhich compose the staminal tube separate in the hollow of the carina.\r\nAll stamens bear fertile anthers. The pistil is in the staminal tube,\r\nthe upper part of the style and stigma of which is inclosed with the\r\nanthers in the carina. The stigma is slightly above the stamens.\r\n\r\nAn insect inserts its head into a sweet-clover flower between the\r\nvexillum and carina, the stigma, therefore, comes into direct contact\r\nwith the head of the insect and cross-pollination is effected. At the\r\nsame time the anthers brush against the insect, so that its head is\r\ndusted with pollen, to be carried to other flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE FLORAL ORGANS OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Lengthwise sectional view of a very\r\nyoung flower of _Melilotus alba_, showing the relative development of\r\nthe stamens and pistil. In the upper set of stamens the divisions of\r\nthe mother cells are completed, while division is just beginning in\r\nthe lower set of stamens. In the ovules the outer integuments are well\r\nstarted on their development, _a_, Anther; _o_, ovule; _p_, pistil. ×\r\n38.]\r\n\r\nThe stamens of _Melilotus alba_ and _M. officinalis_ may be divided\r\ninto two sets, according to their length and time of development.\r\n(Fig. 2.) The longer set extends about the length of the anthers\r\nabove the shorter set, and the pollen mother cells in the longer set\r\ndivide to form pollen grains at least two days earlier than those\r\nin the shorter set. At the time the pollen mother cells divide, the\r\nlonger set of stamens is approximately three-eighths of a millimeter\r\nin length and the pistil about half a millimeter long. The stigma and\r\na portion of the style project beyond the stamens, and this relative\r\nposition is maintained to maturity. The pollen mother cells undergo the\r\nreduction division while the megaspore mother cells are just being\r\ndifferentiated and while the outer integuments are barely prominent at\r\nthe base of the nucellus. The pollen grains are formed while the embryo\r\nsac is beginning to develop. The division of the megaspore mother cell\r\ndoes not occur until a number of days later, and the embryo sac is\r\nnot mature until the flower is nearly ready to open. Thus, the pollen\r\ngrains are formed a week to 10 days before the embryo sac is ready for\r\nfertilization. The pollen grains increase in size and undergo internal\r\nchanges after their formation. These changes, which are not completed\r\nuntil the flower is one-half or more of its mature length, may be\r\nregarded as the ripening processes, and they are undoubtedly necessary\r\nbefore the pollen is capable of functioning. For this reason it is\r\nprobable that the pollen grains are not able to function much before\r\nthe embryo sac is mature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Stigma at the time of pollination,\r\nshowing its papillate character and the position of the pollen in\r\nreference to the papillæ in pollination. × 175.]\r\n\r\nThe pistils of _Melilotus alba_ and _M. officinalis_ are straight for\r\nthe greater part of their length, but curve rather abruptly toward\r\nthe keel just below the capitate stigma. The surface of the stigma is\r\npapillate. (Fig. 3.) In their reaction with Sudan III, alkanin, and\r\nsafranin the Walls of the papillæ of the stigma show that some fatlike\r\nsubstances are present. Aside from water, the contents of the papillæ\r\nconsist chiefly of a fine emulsion of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE OVULES.\r\n\r\nThe number of ovules in the ovary of _Melilotus alba_ varies from\r\ntwo to five; however, most commonly, three or four ovules occur. In\r\n_Melilotus officinalis_ the number in each ovary ranges from three to\r\nsix. In both species the ovules are campylotropous at maturity with the\r\nmicropylar end turned toward the base of the ovary.\r\n\r\nMature ovules contain two integuments, but the inner one does not close\r\nentirely around the end of the nucellus. The outer integument develops\r\nconsiderably ahead of the inner one. The outer integument is much\r\nthickened at the micropylar end, the seed coat is formed from it, and\r\nthe inner integument is used as nourishment by the endosperm and embryo.\r\n\r\nThe number of megaspore mother cells in an ovule varies from one to\r\nmany. Two or more embryo sacs often start to develop in the same ovule,\r\nbut seldom more than one matures. (Pl. I, figs. 1, 2, and 3.) In\r\ngeneral, the development of the embryo sac proceeds in the ordinary\r\nway, as described by Young (44, p. 133), with the inner megaspore\r\nfunctioning. (Text fig. 4 and Pl. II, fig. 1.) In its development\r\nthe nucellus is destroyed rapidly, the destruction being most rapid\r\nfirst at the micropylar end proceeding backward. The nucellus is\r\ncompletely destroyed at the micropylar end by the time the embryo sac\r\nis mature, and consequently the embryo sac comes in contact with the\r\nouter integument in this region. (Pl. II, fig. 1.) As the destruction\r\nof the nucellus extends toward the chalazal end the embryo sac becomes\r\nmuch elongated and tubelike. The antipodals disappear early, so that\r\na mature embryo sac consists of the egg, the synergids, and the two\r\npolars. The two polars lie in contact in the micropylar end of the sac\r\nnear the egg until fertilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERILITY OF THE OVULES.\r\n\r\nIn _Melilotus alba_ and _M. officinalis_ there is very little tendency\r\ntoward sterility of ovules. In an extended study of ovules developing\r\nunder normal and under excessive moisture conditions only an occasional\r\none was found in which no reproductive cells were differentiated, and\r\nno ovaries were found in which all of the ovules were sterile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Median section through an ovule,\r\nshowing the embryo sac with four nuclei and the position of the\r\ninteguments. × 150.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE POLLEN.\r\n\r\nThe pollen mother cells do not separate, but previous to the reduction\r\ndivision the protoplasm shrinks from the walls, thus forming a dense\r\nglobular mass which often occupies less than half the lumen of the\r\nmother cell. (Pl. I, fig. 4.) Nuclear division occurs while they are\r\nin this contracted condition, and four nuclei are formed from two\r\nsuccessive divisions. The cytoplasm is equally distributed around each\r\nnucleus. The four masses of protoplasm separate, and as they enlarge\r\na number of times and develop into mature pollen grains they become\r\nbinucleate, and a wall is gradually formed around each. (Pl. I, figs. 5\r\nand 6.) At first the cytoplasm is quite dense and contains some starch\r\nbut no fatty oils. However, the cytoplasm of mature pollen grains is\r\nvacuolate, and it contains a fatty oil in the form of an emulsion.\r\nSoon after the pollen grains are formed, the walls of the mother cells\r\ndisappear, thus permitting the pollen grains to lie loose in the anther.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILIZATION IN MELILOTUS ALBA.\r\n\r\nThe time intervening between pollination and fertilization was\r\ninvestigated with both self-pollinated and cross-pollinated flowers.\r\nIn cross-pollination the parents were separate plants. This point was\r\ninvestigated with plants out of doors during the summer of 1916 and\r\nwith plants in the greenhouse during the following winter. The time\r\nelapsing between pollination and fertilization ranged from 50 to 55\r\nhours and was not longer in the case of self-pollinated than with\r\ncross-pollinated flowers. Furthermore, the rate of the development of\r\nthe embryo in each kind of pollination was studied and was found to\r\nbe as rapid in self-pollination as in cross-pollination. Therefore,\r\nself-pollination is apparently as effective as cross-pollination in\r\n_Melilotus alba_ so far as the vigor of pollen tubes and the rate at\r\nwhich embryos develop are concerned. _Melilotus officinalis_ was not\r\nstudied in reference to this point.\r\n\r\nConsiderable difference often exists in the size of the young embryos\r\nin the ovules of the same pod. This is due in part to a difference in\r\nthe time of fertilization, although some of it is due to a difference\r\nin nourishment. It was observed that the ovule first fertilized might\r\nbe an upper one, lower one, or any one between these. Occasionally one\r\nor more ovules are not fertilized.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE SEED.\r\n\r\nA proembryo with a rather long suspensor is developed from the\r\nfertilized egg. (Pl. II, fig. 2). The endosperm, which quite early\r\nforms a peripheral layer around the entire embryo sac, develops most\r\nrapidly about the embryo, which soon becomes thoroughly embedded in it.\r\n(Pl. III, figs. 1 and 2.) After the embryo has used up the endosperm in\r\nthe micropylar end and has enlarged so much as to occupy nearly all of\r\nthe space in this region, the development of the endosperm becomes more\r\nactive in the chalazal end, and when the embryo is mature there is very\r\nlittle endosperm left.\r\n\r\nThe seed coat begins to form about the time of fertilization,\r\nalthough it apparently does not depend upon it, for in ovules where\r\nfertilization is prevented the outer integument undergoes the early\r\nmodifications in the development of the seed coat before the ovule\r\nbreaks down. The development of the seed coat is apparent first at\r\nthe micropylar and chalazal ends, where the outer cells of the outer\r\nintegument become much elongated and their outer walls thicken very\r\nsoon after fertilization. The modifications in the development of\r\nthe seed coat extend around the ovule from these points, involving\r\nat first only the outer or epidermal layer of cells which form the\r\nmalpighian layer. Later, the cells just beneath the malpighian layer\r\nform the osteosclerid layer. Accompanying or closely following the\r\nformation of the osteosclerid cells, the remaining cell layers of the\r\nouter integument become modified into the nutritive and aleurone layer,\r\nand the seed coat is fully formed. Meantime the inner integument is\r\npractically all used as food.\r\n\r\nPlate I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the Ovules and Pollen in Sweet Clover.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Section through the nucellus of an ovule of\r\n_Melilotus alba_, showing two megaspore mother cells. × 360.

At this stage the suspensor prominent part of the proembryo, and\r\nthe endosperm is most abundant around the embryo. The inner integument\r\nis being rapidly destroyed, and the outer integument is beginning to\r\nform the seed coat, as is indicated by the modifications in the outer\r\nlayer of its cells, which are elongating and thickening their outer\r\nwalls. × 33.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Section of an Ovule of Melilotus alba after\r\nFertilization.\r\n\r\nThe stage of development is a little later than that shown in Plate II,\r\nfigure 2.

The\r\nmodifications which transform the outer integument into a seed coat are\r\nwell under way. Not only the outer layer of cells which becomes the\r\nMalpighian layer is quite well modified, but also the layer beneath is\r\nbeing transformed into the osteosclerid layer. × 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nStubble of Melilotus alba.\r\n\r\nThese plants, which were cut 12 inches above the ground during rainy\r\nweather, had made a 40 to 42 inch growth. The stubble became infected\r\nat the top and the light-colored portions of them were killed by\r\ndisease, thus checking the water supply to the growing branches above\r\nthe infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATURE POLLEN OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nThe pollen grains of _Melilotus alba_ and of _M. officinalis_ are quite\r\nsimilar. Each grain contains three germ pores, and when viewed so\r\nthat the pores are visible they present a slightly angled appearance.\r\nThe average dimensions of the pollen of _Melilotus alba_ and of _M.\r\nofficinalis_ are 26 by 32 microns and 24 by 30 microns, respectively,\r\nwhen measured in the positions shown in _b_ in Plate I, figure 6.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the pollen grains have cutin deposited in them, as shown\r\nby their reactions with Sudan III, alkanin, safranin, and chloriodid of\r\nzinc. The contents of the pollen grains give a distinct reaction when\r\ntested for fat, and Millon's reagent shows that also some protein is\r\npresent. Tests for sugars and starch showed that these substances are\r\nnot present in perceptible quantities in mature pollen grains, although\r\nsome starch is present in immature pollen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMINATION OF THE POLLEN.\r\n\r\nThe germination of the pollen of _Melilotus alba_ permits considerable\r\nvariation in moisture, as is illustrated in Table I.\r\n\r\nTable I.--_Germination of the pollen of Melilotus alba in water and in\r\nsolutions of cane sugar of different strengths._\r\n\r\n  ---------------+--------+---------------------------------------\r\n                 |        | Cane sugar in solution (per cent).\r\n                 | Pure   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n  Melilotus alba.| water. |  8 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 35 | 45 | 55\r\n  ---------------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n  Germination    |        |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    of pollen    |   33   | 23 | 64 | 46 | 60 | 46 | 31 | 22 |  0\r\n      per cent   |        |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  ---------------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n\r\nThe results given in Table I represent the average of 12 tests. Some\r\nof the pollen grains burst in pure water and in the weak cane sugar\r\nsolutions, the percentage of bursting being greatest in pure water and\r\ndecreasing as the percentage of sugar in the solution was increased.\r\nThere was considerable variation in the percentages of germination in\r\nboth water and in the solutions of different strengths, and at times\r\nthere was very little bursting which was not accompanied by a high\r\npercentage of germination. The pollen tubes grew as rapidly in water as\r\nin any of the sugar solutions, some reaching a length of 100 microns\r\nin six hours. As the pollen tubes made no more growth in the solutions\r\nof sugar than in water, it is evident that the sugar is not used as\r\nfood, but helps in germination by reducing the rate at which water is\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\nTo judge from Table I, the pollen of sweet clover can be effective not\r\nonly under ordinary conditions but also when the flowers are wet with\r\nrain or dew or when the stigma is so dry that in order to obtain water\r\nfrom the papillæ the pollen must overcome a high resistance offered by\r\nthe sap of the papillæ, a resistance that may be equal to the osmotic\r\npressure of a 45 per cent solution of cane sugar. This is in accord\r\nwith results obtained under field conditions; as flowers that were\r\npollinated while rain was falling set seed satisfactorily, indicating\r\nthat a high percentage of humidity in the atmosphere does not check the\r\ngermination of the pollen sufficiently to interfere with fertilization.\r\nNeither was the setting of seed affected when the soil about the roots\r\nof plants was kept saturated with water, showing that the excessive\r\nquantity of water in the stigmas resulting from an abundance of water\r\nin the soil did not interfere with the fertilization of the flowers.\r\n\r\nNo definite counts were made of the germination of the pollen of\r\n_Melilotus officinalis_ in the solutions of cane sugar of different\r\nstrengths, but observations show that the moisture requirement of the\r\npollen of this species is approximately the same as that of _Melilotus\r\nalba_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSS-POLLINATION AND SELF-POLLINATION OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nResults published by previous investigators on the cross-pollination\r\nand self-pollination of sweet clover do not agree. The experiments of\r\nDarwin (4) show that the flowers are self-pollinated to only a small\r\nextent. On the other hand, Kirchner (18) and Kerner (17) find that\r\nself-pollination occurs generally and that cross-pollination is not\r\nnecessary for the production of seed. However, all investigators agree\r\nthat many different kinds of insects are able to pollinate sweet clover.\r\n\r\nBecause of the diverse opinions as to the pollination of sweet clover,\r\na number of experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether insect\r\nvisitation was necessary to pollinate the flowers, (2) if necessary,\r\nwhether the flowers must be cross-pollinated, and (3) what insects are\r\nactive agents as pollinators of sweet clover.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL MANIPULATION OF SWEET-CLOVER FLOWERS.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] The writers wish to acknowledge their indebtedness to Mr. Carl\r\nKurtzweil for assistance in conducting part of the field experiments at\r\nAmes.\r\n\r\nExperiments were conducted to determine, if possible, the effect of\r\nvarious types of artificial manipulation of sweet-clover flowers when\r\nin full bloom on the production of seed. Only healthy, vigorous plants\r\ngrowing on well-drained soil were selected for these experiments.\r\nBefore any of the flowers were open, the individual racemes were\r\ncovered with tarlatan and labeled. (Fig. 5.) As soon as part of the\r\nflowers opened, the racemes were uncovered and after removing all\r\nflowers that were not open the open flowers were pollinated and the\r\nracemes re-covered. If the flowers of sweet clover are not fertilized\r\nthey will remain open for two to three days, then wither, and in a\r\nshort time drop. But after being fertilized the ovules enlarge very\r\nrapidly, and the corollas usually drop in about seven or eight days.\r\nTherefore, all fertilized flowers can be distinguished a few days after\r\nfertilization has taken place. Counts were made of the number of pods\r\nwhich formed in 10 to 12 days after pollination. An outline of the\r\nexperiments is given in Table II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Individual racemes of white sweet\r\nclover covered with cheesecloth to protect them from insect visitation.]\r\n\r\nTable II.--_Treatment of sweet-clover flowers in the\r\nartificial-manipulation experiments._\r\n\r\n  ------------+---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Experiment. |          Method of pollinating the flowers.\r\n  ------------+---------------------------------------------------------\r\n    A         | Check--covered.\r\n              |\r\n    B         | Check--open to insect visitation at all times.\r\n              |\r\n    C         | A separate toothpick was used to spring the keel of each\r\n              |   flower on the raceme.\r\n              |\r\n    D         | One toothpick was used to spring the keels of all the\r\n              |   flowers on a raceme.\r\n              |\r\n    E         | Cross-pollinated.\r\n              |\r\n    F         | Raceme rolled several times between thumb and finger.\r\n  ------------+---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs insects, and especially honeybees, usually visit all recently\r\nopened flowers on a raceme, experiments C and D were conducted to\r\ndetermine whether more seed would be produced when pollen from other\r\nflowers on the same raceme was placed on the stigmas of the flowers\r\nthan when only the pollen produced by each flower was placed on its\r\nown stigma. The effect of pollination when only the pollen produced by\r\nan individual flower was placed on its own stigmas was also obtained\r\nin experiment F, as by this method of pollination no pollen was\r\ntransferred from one flower to another. It can not be stated definitely\r\nthat the seed produced by the cross-pollinated flowers was the result\r\nof fertilization with foreign pollen, as the anthers were not removed\r\nfrom the flowers pollinated because it would be necessary to remove\r\nthe anthers when the flowers were not more than two-thirds mature, and\r\nin doing this the flowers would be so mutilated that only occasionally\r\nwould pollination at this time or at a later date be effective. The\r\nflowers listed in experiment E were pollinated a short time before they\r\nopened, and in each case pollen taken from flowers of other plants\r\nwas placed on the stigmas. The petals of the cross-pollinated flowers\r\nwere not mutilated, and in each case they returned to their original\r\npositions soon after pollination. The results obtained in experiment B,\r\nwhere the racemes were simply labeled and left open to the action of\r\ninsects at all times, serve for comparison with other experiments where\r\nthe flowers were protected from insect visitation and were artificially\r\nmanipulated.\r\n\r\nMartin (25) found the setting of alfalfa seed and Westgate (40)\r\nfound the setting of red-clover seed to be affected by an excessive\r\nquantity of moisture in the soil or atmosphere. In order to overcome\r\nthe possible effect of this or of other detrimental factors, in each\r\nexperiment only the flowers on a certain number of racemes were\r\npollinated at one time. All of the experiments were repeated a number\r\nof times during the months of July and August, 1916, and the results\r\ngiven in Table III show the total number of flowers pollinated and the\r\nnumber of pods that formed during the two months.\r\n\r\nThe results presented in Table III show that flowers fertilized with\r\npollen transferred from another plant produced a higher percentage\r\nof pods than any of the other treatments. The results obtained in\r\nexperiment D, where the same toothpick was used to spring the keels\r\nof all the flowers on a raceme, show that this method of pollination\r\nproduced an average of 7.24 pods per raceme more than the racemes in\r\nexperiment C. where a separate toothpick was used for each flower.\r\nThese results indicate that pollen transferred from one flower to\r\nanother on the same raceme is more effective than when the pollen\r\nproduced by an individual flower is used to fertilize its own stigma.\r\nHowever, the results of experiment C prove that self-pollination\r\nis effective in _Melilotus alba_. In experiment B. which was the\r\nopen check, 4.3 per cent more flowers set seed than on the racemes\r\nwhere the same toothpick was used to spring all the keels, but 11.57\r\nper cent more seed was obtained than in experiment C. Spontaneous\r\nself-pollination occurs to only a very small extent, as will be seen\r\nfrom the results of experiment A, in which an average of only 2.9 per\r\ncent of the flowers set seed.\r\n\r\nTable III.--_Effect of different types of artificial\r\nmanipulation on the seed production of sweet clover at Arlington, Va.,\r\nand at Ames, Iowa, in 1916._\r\n\r\n  ----------+--------+---------------------------+-------------------\r\n            |        |    Total number of--      | Flowers that set\r\n            |        |                           |  seed (per cent).\r\n            | Experi-+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  Location. |  ment. |Racemes.|Flowers.|Pods set.| At each |\r\n            |        |        |        |         | station.| Average.\r\n  ----------+--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------\r\n            |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Arlington |    A   |    49  | 3,510  |    144  |     4.1 |}     2.9\r\n  Ames      |    A   |    84  | 4,536  |     92  |     2.0 |}\r\n            |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Arlington |    B   |   100  | 5,599  |  3,973  |   70.95 |}   66.51\r\n  Ames      |    B   |   196  | 1,276  |    600  |   47.02 |}\r\n            |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Arlington |    C   |    50  | 1,229  |    701  |   57.03 |}   54.94\r\n  Ames      |    C   |    75  |   289  |    133  |   46.02 |}\r\n            |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Arlington |    D   |    50  | 1,480  |    936  |   63.24 |}   62.18\r\n  Ames      |    D   |    88  |   575  |    342  |   59.47 |}\r\n            |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Arlington |    E   |    31  |   377  |    307  |   81.43 |}   70.10\r\n  Ames      |    E   |    48  |   175  |     80  |   45.71 |}\r\n            |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n  Arlington |    F   |    30  |   933  |    524  |   56.16 |.........\r\n  ----------+--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED PRODUCTION OF MELILOTUS ALBA UNDER ORDINARY FIELD CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\nThe production of seed of _Melilotus alba_ under ordinary field\r\nconditions varies considerably, not only in different parts of the\r\ncountry but also on different fields in the same region. A number\r\nof factors contribute to this variation, one of the most important\r\nof which appears to be the inability of the plant to supply all the\r\ndeveloping seed with sufficient moisture, causing some of them to\r\nabort. As pointed out on page 22 this condition was very marked in\r\ncertain parts of the country in 1916. However, poor seed production\r\nis not always correlated with lack of moisture, for the seed crop\r\nwas a failure in 1915, where cloudy and rainy weather prevailed much\r\nof the time the plants were in bloom. It is believed that the lack\r\nof pollination by insects was the principal cause for the failure of\r\nseed to set, as very few insects visit sweet-clover flowers when such\r\nconditions prevail. As sweet-clover pollen will germinate in pure\r\nwater and as plants which have their roots submerged in water set seed\r\nabundantly when pollinated, the failure of the seed crop in 1915 was\r\nnot due to excessive moisture.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, thin stands of sweet clover produce more seed to the acre\r\nthan thick stands and isolated plants more seed than those growing\r\nin either a thick or thin stand. The correlation of seed production\r\nwith the thickness of stand is probably due to the shading and partial\r\nprevention of insect visitation to part of the racemes on the lower\r\nbranches. Most of the flowers upon the lower branches of isolated\r\nplants are directly exposed to sunlight and to insect visits: therefore\r\nthe racemes on these branches produce as large a percentage of seed as\r\nthe racemes on the upper branches. In a thick stand, little seed is\r\nproduced by racemes on the lower branches.\r\n\r\nA plant approximately 3 feet high growing close to the center of\r\na field at Arlington. Va., in which was an average stand of four\r\nsweet-clover plants to the square foot was selected in order to\r\ndetermine the number of racemes produced and the average number of\r\nseeds to the raceme. This plant produced 196 racemes, which contained\r\nan average of 20.4 pods each. The racemes varied from 2 to 10 cm. in\r\nlength, and the number of pods to the raceme ranged from to 75. The\r\nracemes on the upper and most exposed portions of the plants were\r\nlarger and the flowers produced a much higher percentage of pods than\r\nthe racemes close to the bases of the larger branches. Many of the\r\nsmall racemes on the lower branches produced less than five pods each.\r\n\r\nThe data obtained from the two plants at Arlington that were protected\r\nfrom night-flying insects may also be cited here, as the results of\r\nthat experiment show that night-flying insects are not an important\r\nfactor in the production of sweet-clover seed, and, further. because\r\nthey were growing under the same conditions, in the same plat, and were\r\napproximately of the same size. These two plants produced a total of\r\n544 racemes, with an average of 20.9 pods each. The number of pods to\r\nthe raceme varied from to 86.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFICIENCY OF CERTAIN KINDS OF INSECTS AS POLLINATORS OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nIn order further to test the self-sterility of sweet clover and to\r\ndetermine the relative efficiency of night-flying and of different\r\nkinds of day-flying insects as pollinators of the flowers, a number\r\nof cages covered with cheesecloth, glass, or wire screen having 14\r\nmeshes to the linear inch were placed over plants at Arlington. Va.,\r\nand at Ames. Iowa, in July and August. 1916. The bases of the cages\r\nwere buried several inches in the ground, so that insects could not\r\npass under them. Cheesecloth was used to cover most of the cages and\r\nwas made into sacks of such a size that they could be put on or removed\r\nfrom the frames of the cages without difficulty. It was stretched\r\ntightly over the frames and fastened to their bases with laths.\r\n\r\nA cage having two sides and the top of glass but with ends covered with\r\ncheesecloth to permit ventilation was used at Ames to protect a number\r\nof plants from insect visitation at all times. The purpose of this\r\ncage was to determine whether the partial shading of the plants in the\r\ncages covered with cheesecloth would have any effect upon the setting\r\nof seed.\r\n\r\nThe cage covered with wire netting having 14 meshes to the linear inch\r\nwas used to determine the efficiency as pollinators of sweet clover of\r\ninsects so small that they could pass through openings of this size.\r\n\r\nThe plants used in the experiments at Arlington were growing close to\r\nthe center of a field of sweet clover. Volunteer plants in a field\r\nthat contained only a scattering stand were used at Ames. The cages\r\nwere placed over the plants in all of these experiments before any of\r\nthe flowers opened, and the work was continued until they were through\r\nblooming.\r\n\r\nPLANTS SUBJECT TO INSECT VISITATION AT ALL TIMES.\r\n\r\nA plant subject to insect visits at all times and growing in the same\r\nplat as those inclosed in the cages at Arlington was selected as a\r\ncheck to those inclosed in the cages during their entire flowering\r\nperiod or for only a portion of it. This plant, which was in bloom at\r\nthe same time as those inclosed in the cages, produced 196 racemes with\r\nan average of 20.4 pods each. As all of the racemes were collected and\r\nas those on the lower portions of the plant were smaller than those\r\non the upper branches, the average number of seeds per raceme is much\r\nlower than it would have been if only the larger racemes had been\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nAn isolated plant that was subject to insect visits at all times was\r\nselected for a check to the cage work conducted at Ames. This was\r\nnecessary in order to get results that would be comparable with those\r\nobtained from the plants inclosed in the cages, as the cage experiments\r\nat Ames were conducted with isolated plants. The plant produced 239\r\nracemes, with an average of 41.6 pods.\r\n\r\nPLANTS PROTECTED FROM INSECT VISITATION DURING THEIR ENTIRE FLOWERING\r\nPERIOD.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1916, a cage 3 feet square and 3½ feet high, covered with\r\ncheesecloth, was placed over three sweet-clover plants at Arlington.\r\n(Fig. 6.) This cage was not opened until August 3, when practically\r\nall of the racemes had passed the flowering stage and the few seeds\r\nthat formed on some of them were practically mature. The three plants\r\ninclosed in the cage produced 904 racemes, with an average of 0.63 pod\r\neach. No pods were produced on 594 racemes, while 150 produced but one\r\neach. None of the racemes produced more than five pods.\r\n\r\nThis experiment was duplicated at Ames in August, 1916, with the result\r\nthat the three protected plants produced a total of 776 racemes, with\r\nan average of 0.19 pod each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Cage covered with cheesecloth to\r\nprotect plants from insect visitation.]\r\n\r\nThe plants inclosed at Arlington produced 0.44 pod to the raceme more\r\nthan the plants inclosed at Ames, and the average for the six plants\r\nat Arlington and at Ames is only 0.42 pod to the raceme. Results given\r\nbelow for nine plants inclosed in the glass-covered cage show that the\r\npods produced per raceme by different plants varied from 0.1 to 0.45,\r\nwhich is slightly less than the variation in the two cages covered with\r\ncheese-cloth.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether the shading of the plants in the\r\ncheesecloth-covered cages had caused the production of seed to be\r\nreduced, a cage 4 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 10 feet long, having\r\nglass sides and top, but with ends covered with cheesecloth to permit\r\nventilation, was placed over nine plants at Ames in August, 1916. The\r\nresults obtained in this experiment are presented in Table IV.\r\n\r\nTable IV.--_Production of sweet-clover seed by plants\r\nprotected from insect visitation during their entire flowering period\r\nat Ames, Iowa, in 1916._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            |  Racemes  | Pods produced   | Average number of\r\n  Plant.    | per plant.| by all racemes. | pods to the raceme.\r\n  ----------+-----------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n            |           |                 |\r\n  No. 1     |      84   |         17      |       0.20\r\n  No. 2     |     130   |         58      |        .44\r\n  No. 3     |     166   |         30      |        .18\r\n  No. 4     |     199   |         88      |        .44\r\n  No. 5     |     243   |         35      |        .27\r\n  No. 6     |     131   |         36      |        .27\r\n  No. 7     |     119   |         13      |        .10\r\n  No. 8     |     182   |         83      |        .45\r\n  No. 9     |     340   |        142      |        .41\r\n            +-----------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n    Total   |   1,594   |        592      |      .......\r\n  Average   |           |                 |        .31\r\n  ----------+-----------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results given in Table IV show that an average of 0.31 of a pod\r\nto the raceme was obtained from 1,594 racemes and that the variation\r\nin seed production of the different plants was from 0.1 to 0.45 to\r\nthe raceme. The average seed production for the nine plants is 0.11\r\nseed to the raceme less than the average results obtained from the six\r\nplants that were covered with cheesecloth. As this difference is well\r\nwithin the limit of variation for individual plants, it may be stated\r\nthat the shading of the plants in the cheesecloth-covered cages did not\r\nreduce the production of seed. The results of this experiment show that\r\nspontaneous self-pollination does not occur regularly, as stated by\r\nKirchner.\r\n\r\nFLOWERS POLLINATED ONLY BY NIGHT-FLYING INSECTS.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the importance of night-flying insects as\r\npollinators, two cheesecloth-covered cages 3 feet square and 3½\r\nfeet high were placed over sweet-clover plants at Arlington on July\r\n10, 1916. The covers of the cages were removed each evening at 7:30\r\nand replaced each morning at 4:30 o'clock. Practically all the flowers\r\non these plants had bloomed by August 2, and the seed produced was\r\nnearly mature. The few racemes that contained opened flowers or buds\r\nwere discarded. The three plants in one cage produced 723 racemes,\r\nwith an average of 3.76 pods each, while the one plant in the other\r\ncage produced 227 racemes, with an average of 3.58 pods to the raceme.\r\nThe four plants, therefore, produced a total of 950 racemes, with an\r\naverage of 3.71 pods each. The only night-flying insect found working\r\non sweet clover while these plants were in bloom was _Diacrisia\r\nvirginica_ Fabr.\r\n\r\nThis experiment was duplicated at Ames in August, 1916, with the result\r\nthat one plant subject to visitation only by night-flying insects\r\nproduced 486 racemes, with an average of 16.5 pods each.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained in these experiments show that night-flying\r\ninsects were much more active in pollinating sweet clover at Ames than\r\nat Arlington. However, as the results obtained from the plants subject\r\nto visitation by day-flying insects only were practically the same as\r\nthose obtained from plants which were subject to insect visitation at\r\nall times, it is concluded that night-flying insects were not a factor\r\nin the pollination of sweet clover at Arlington or at Ames in 1916.\r\n\r\nFLOWERS POLLINATED ONLY BY DAY-FLYING INSECTS.\r\n\r\nA cheesecloth-covered cage, 3 feet square and 3½ feet high, was\r\nplaced on July 7, 1916, over two sweet-clover plants at Arlington,\r\nbefore any of the flowers opened. As the cover of this cage was\r\nremoved at 7.30 a. m. and replaced at 4.30 p. m. each day during the\r\nexperiment, the plants were subject to visitation by day-flying insects\r\nonly. As soon as all of the flowers on most of the racemes had bloomed,\r\nand before any mature pods shattered, the racemes were removed from the\r\nplants and the pods produced by each raceme counted. The two plants\r\nproduced a total of 544 racemes, with an average of 20.9 pods each.\r\n\r\nThis experiment was also conducted at Ames. One plant was protected\r\nfrom insect visitation at night in August, 1916, with the result that\r\nit produced 418 racemes, with an average of 41.11 pods each.\r\n\r\nPLANTS PROTECTED FROM ALL INSECTS THAT COULD NOT PASS THROUGH A WIRE\r\nSCREEN HAVING 14 MESHES TO THE LINEAR INCH.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that many small insects, and especially those\r\nbelonging to the family Syrphidæ and to the genus Halictus, frequent\r\nsweet-clover flowers, but no records have been noted that show how\r\nimportant these insects are as pollinators of this plant. In order to\r\nobtain data on this subject a cage 12 feet square and 6½ feet high,\r\nmade of wire screen having 14 meshes to the linear inch, was placed\r\nover a few plants at Ames, in July, 1916, before they began to bloom.\r\nThe base of the cage was buried several inches in the soil, so that\r\nno insects could get into it. As these plants were growing in a field\r\nwhere there was a sufficient supply of moisture at all times, they\r\nmade a growth of 5 to 6 feet. For this reason all the racemes were\r\ncollected from only a portion of one of the plants instead of from\r\nthe entire plant, as was done with the smaller ones inclosed in the\r\ncheesecloth-covered cages. The branches selected contained 224 racemes,\r\nwith an average of 24.53 pods each. Many insects that were able to pass\r\nthrough the wire netting were observed working on the flowers of the\r\ninclosed plants.\r\n\r\nA check plant, subject to visitation by all insects and growing within\r\na few yards of the cage, contained 264 racemes, with an average of\r\n28.23 pods each.\r\n\r\nThis experiment shows that small insects are efficient pollinators\r\nof sweet clover and that the plant to which all insects had access\r\nproduced an average of only 3.7 pods to the raceme more than the\r\none inclosed in the cage. As these plants were growing close to a\r\nstrip of timber and some distance from a field of sweet clover, it\r\nis probable that more small insects worked on the flowers than would\r\nhave been the case if the cage had been located in the center of a\r\nfield of sweet clover. Though these results show that small insects\r\nare able to pollinate sweet-clover flowers freely, it is very doubtful\r\nwhether insects of this kind would be numerous enough to pollinate\r\nsufficient flowers in a large field of sweet clover for profitable\r\nseed production. The honeybee is the most efficient pollinator of this\r\nplant, and it is believed that in many sections it is responsible for\r\nthe pollination of more than half of the flowers.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF INSECT-POLLINATION STUDIES.\r\n\r\nThe data secured in the different experiments where sweet-clover\r\nflowers were subject to insect visitation at one time or another are\r\npresented in detail in Table V.\r\n\r\nTable V.--_Summary of the insect pollination studies conducted\r\nat Arlington, Va., and Ames, Iowa, in 1916._\r\n\r\n  ----------+-------+-------------------------+----------------------------\r\n            |       |                         |        Number of--\r\n            |Number |                         +--------+---------+---------\r\n  Location. |  of   |  Method of treatment.   |Racemes.|  Pods   |Pods per\r\n            |plants.|                         |        |produced.| raceme,\r\n            |       |                         |        |         | average.\r\n  ----------+-------+-------------------------+--------+---------+---------\r\n  Arlington.|   1   |Check--subject to insect |   196  |  4,013  |  20.47\r\n            |       | visitation at all times.|        |         |\r\n  Ames.     |   1   |     do.                 |   239  |  9,943  |  41.60\r\n  Arlington.|   3   |Protected from all       |   904  |    577  |    .63\r\n            |       | insects.                |        |         |\r\n  Ames.     |  12   |     do.                 | 2,370  |    653  |    .27\r\n  Arlington.|   3   |Visited by night-flying  |   723  |  2,720  |   3.76\r\n            |       | insects only (cage 1).  |        |         |\r\n     Do.    |   1   |Visited by night-flying  |   227  |    152  |    .67\r\n            |       | insects only (cage 2).  |        |         |\r\n  Ames.     |   1   |Visited by night-flying  |   486  |  8,024  |  16.51\r\n            |       | insects only.           |        |         |\r\n  Arlington.|   2   |Visited by day-flying    |   544  | 11,397  |  20.95\r\n            |       | insects only.           |        |         |\r\n  Ames.     |   1   |     do.                 |   418  | 17,186  |  41.11\r\n     Do.    |   9   |Protected from all       | 1,594  |    502  |    .31\r\n            |       | insects.                |        |         |\r\n  ----------+-------+-------------------------+--------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nThe results in Table V show that an average of 0.37 pod to the raceme\r\nwas obtained from the plants protected from visitation by all insects\r\nduring the flowering period. As the racemes of _Melilotus alba_ will\r\naverage approximately 50 flowers each, less than 1 per cent of them\r\nset seed without being pollinated by insects. The results obtained in\r\nthe cages in which only night-flying insects had access to the flowers\r\nshow that these insects pollinate sweet clover to a slight extent,\r\nbut that the number of pods produced by them is so few that it may be\r\nassumed that these flowers would have been pollinated by day-flying\r\ninsects. This assumption is borne out by the results obtained in the\r\ncages where only day-flying insects had access to the flowers, as the\r\nresults obtained in these cages at Arlington and Ames, respectively,\r\nare approximately the same as those obtained on the plants subject\r\nto insect visitation at all times. It will be noted that the yield\r\nof seed on the plants visited by insects at Ames is much higher than\r\nthat of the plants subjected to insect visits during the same period\r\nat Arlington. This difference in seed yield may be attributed to the\r\nfact that isolated plants were used in the experiments at Ames, and\r\nat Arlington the experiments were conducted with plants growing under\r\nfield conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF THE POSITION OF THE FLOWERS ON MELILOTUS ALBA PLANTS TO\r\nSEED PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nObservations of sweet-clover plants grown under cultivation, and\r\nespecially when the stands were thick, showed that the flowers of the\r\nracemes on the upper and exposed branches produced a larger percentage\r\nof seed than those on the lower branches which were less exposed. It is\r\nthought by some that the failure of the flowers on the lower racemes\r\nto be fertilized is due to shading; but the results obtained in the\r\ncheesecloth and glass covered cages do not warrant this belief, as it\r\nis doubtful whether the shading of the flowers on the lower racemes is\r\nmore than that caused by the cheesecloth. It is probably the lack of\r\npollination that causes this decrease in seed production on the lower\r\nbranches of plants growing close together, as a vast number of flowers\r\nopen each day on portions of the plants which are exposed directly to\r\nvisitation by insects and are therefore more accessible to them.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain information upon the number of flowers that produce\r\nseed on the upper and lower portions, respectively, of sweet-clover\r\nplants when grown under field conditions and where the stand contained\r\nfour to five plants to the square foot, a number of racemes were\r\nlabeled on different portions of the plants at Ames in 1915 and 1916.\r\nWhen the pods were partly mature, records were made of the number of\r\nflowers that produced pods. The results obtained are given in Table VI.\r\n\r\nTable VI.--_Relation of the position of sweet-clover flowers\r\non the plants to seed production, at Ames, Iowa, in 1915 and 1916._\r\n\r\n  -----+------------------------+---------+------------------------------\r\n       |                        |         |       Pods formed.\r\n       |                        |Number of+--------+------------+--------\r\n  Year.|Position of the flowers.| flowers.| Number.| Percentage.|  Average.\r\n  -----+------------------------+---------+--------+------------+--------\r\n       |                        |         |        |            |\r\n  1915 | Upper half of plants   |   812   |   357  |    43.9 }  |\r\n  1916 |   do                   |   261   |   101  |    38.7 }  |  42.6\r\n       |                        |         |        |            |\r\n  1915 | Lower half of plants   |   344   |    44  |    12.7 }  |\r\n  1916 |   do                   |   216   |    59  |    27.3 }  |  18.3\r\n  -----+------------------------+---------+--------+------------+--------\r\n\r\nThe flowers on the upper racemes of the plants produced 31.2 per cent\r\nmore pods than those on the lower racemes in 1915. and 11.4 per cent\r\nmore in 1916. These results prove that insects more frequently visit\r\nthe flowers that are directly exposed and are therefore more accessible.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE WEATHER AT BLOSSOMING TIME UPON SEED PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe seed production of sweet clover is seldom satisfactory when rainy\r\nor muggy weather prevails during the flowering period. In order to\r\nobtain data as to the relation existing between the visits of insects\r\nand the prevailing weather conditions, a record of insect visits and\r\nof the number of flowers that opened each day was kept for a period of\r\nnine days at Ames in August, 1915.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment the racemes were marked early each morning just\r\nabove the last flowers which had opened the previous day, and early\r\nthe following morning the number of flowers which had opened the\r\nprevious day was noted. The number of flowers that were pollinated was\r\ndetermined by the number of pods that formed. Table VII gives in detail\r\nthe results obtained.\r\n\r\nTable VII.--_Influence of the weather at blossoming time upon\r\nthe yield of sweet -clover seed, at Ames.

While the useful insect visitors of flowers\r\nof red clover are limited to a few species of Hymenoptera, those\r\npollinating sweet-clover blossoms are many and belong to such orders as\r\nColeoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, as well as to the Hymenoptera.\r\nHowever, in the United States the honeybee is the most important\r\npollinator of sweet clover. In many parts of the country the different\r\nspecies of Halictus, commonly known as sweat bees, rank next in\r\nimportance. The margined soldier beetles (_Chauliognathus marginatus_\r\nFabr.) were very active pollinators at Arlington, Va., in the latter\r\npart of June and first part of July, 1916, but the woolly bear\r\n(_Diacrisia virginica_ Fabr.) was the only night-flying insect found\r\nworking on sweet clover at Arlington.\r\n\r\nInsects belonging to the genera Halictus, Syritta, and Paragus were\r\nvery active pollinators at Ames, Iowa, in 1916, and ranked next in\r\nimportance to the honeybee. In fact, the results obtained in the\r\ncage where the plants were protected from visitation by insects that\r\ncould not pass through a screen having 14 meshes to the linear inch\r\nshowed that these small insects were able under the conditions of that\r\nexperiment to pollinate practically as many flowers as larger insects.\r\n\r\nThe insects listed below were collected while visiting _Melilotus alba_\r\nand _M. officinalis_ flowers in 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT ARLINGTON, VA.\r\n\r\n _Neuroptera._--_Perithemis domitia_ Dru., _Enallagma_ sp.\r\n\r\n _Hemiptera._--_Adelphocoris rapidus_ Say, _Lygus pratensis_ Linn,\r\n (tarnished plant bug).\r\n\r\n _Coleoptera._--_Chauliognathus marginatus_ Fabr.

Examination of flowers that aborted shortly after reaching\r\ntheir mature size showed that the anther sacs had not burst, even\r\nthough the pollen grains were mature. Apparently for the same reason\r\nmany immature pods aborted. The precipitation for July, 1916, in\r\nLivingston County, Ill., where the sweet-clover seed crop suffered\r\nmaterially for lack of moisture, was 3.2 inches less than normal, while\r\nthe temperature was 4.5° F. above normal. In August the precipitation\r\nwas 0.96 of an inch below normal and the temperature 4.2° F. above\r\nnormal. At Ames, Iowa, the precipitation was 3.54 inches below\r\nnormal and the temperature 5.4° F. above normal in July. Both the\r\nprecipitation and temperature were about normal at Ames in August, but\r\nmost of the precipitation fell before the experiments were commenced.\r\n\r\nIn north-central Illinois the seed production of sweet clover was\r\nvery irregular. Some fields produced an abundance of seed, while a\r\nlarge percentage of the pods on the plants in other fields near by,\r\nwhere the thickness of the stand, size of the plants, and conditions\r\nin general were approximately the same, aborted. It was evident that\r\nall stands producing a good seed crop were growing on well-drained\r\nsoil and that those which were not yielding satisfactorily were on\r\npoorly drained land. It is well known that sweet clover will produce\r\ndeep taproots only when the plants are growing in well-drained soil\r\nand that a much-branched surface root system will be formed on poorly\r\ndrained land, and especially when there is an excess of moisture or a\r\nhigh water table during the first season's growth. During this droughty\r\nperiod in 1916 the upper layer of soil became so depleted of moisture\r\nthat the plants with surface root systems were unable to obtain\r\nsufficient water to mature their seed. On the other hand, the lack of\r\nprecipitation and the high temperatures did not affect the moisture\r\ncontent of the subsoil sufficiently to interfere with the normal seed\r\nproduction of deep-rooted plants. According to Lutts (22, p. 47) this\r\nsame condition was found to be true in Ohio in 1916.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, under droughty conditions the second crop of sweet clover\r\nwill produce a higher yield of seed than the first crop, as the second\r\ngrowth of the plants is seldom more than half as much as the first,\r\nthereby requiring less moisture. However, if showery hot weather\r\nprevails when the first crop is cut, the end of each stub is very apt\r\nto become infected, usually with a species of Fusarium, which kills all\r\nthe cortex as far back as the upper bud or young shoot and that part\r\nof it on the opposite side of this bud to the bud below. If the second\r\nbud from the top of a stub is not directly opposite the upper one the\r\ndecay may extend nearly to the ground. (Pl. IV.) The destruction of\r\nhalf to two-thirds of the cortex from 2 to 4 inches below the upper bud\r\nmaterially reduces the quantity of water that can be conveyed to the\r\nbranch above the base of the dead area. Plants thus infected obtain\r\nsufficient moisture for seed production only under the most favorable\r\nconditions. When the first crop is cut during warm dry weather, and\r\nespecially when the first crop has not been permitted to make more than\r\na 30 to 32 inch growth, the stubble seldom decays, and in no instance\r\nhave the plants been observed to decay as far back as the upper buds.\r\n\r\nAn experiment was conducted at Ames in the latter part of August and\r\nfirst part of September, 1916, to determine the effect of watering\r\nplants that were aborting a large percentage of their flowers and\r\nimmature pods. For this purpose several volunteer plants growing in\r\na meadow were selected. A hole 12 inches square and 14 inches deep\r\nwas dug 8 inches from the crown of one plant, and each evening during\r\nthe experiment 2 gallons of water were poured into the hole. The top\r\nof the hole was kept covered, so as to check evaporation from it as\r\nmuch as possible. Another plant of the same size and growing about 15\r\nyards from the watered plant served as a check. On both plants many\r\nof the flowers and immature buds were aborting at the beginning of\r\nthe experiment. The soil in this field was so depleted of moisture\r\nthat the leaves of the plants wilted during the hottest part of the\r\ndays preceding the experiment. The foliage on the check plant wilted\r\neach day for the first five days of the experiment. On the sixth day\r\n0.96 of an inch of rain fell and four days later 0.23 of an inch\r\nmore. The dropping of the flowers was temporarily checked by these\r\nprecipitations, but owing to the dry, compact condition of the soil\r\nthe rain was not sufficient to check entirely the fall of flowers and\r\nimmature pods. At the beginning of the experiment the racemes on both\r\nplants were divided into three classes, according to the development of\r\nthe flowers, and labeled. They were collected and the seeds counted as\r\nsoon as the pods at the bases of the racemes commenced to turn brown.\r\nTable VIII presents the results obtained.\r\n\r\nTable VIII.--_Effect of water upon the seed production of\r\nsweet clover when growing under droughty conditions at Ames, Iowa, in\r\n1916._\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------\r\n                          |Plant not watered.|  Plant watered.  |\r\n                          +--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n                          |        | Average |        | Average |\r\n  Stage of development    | Number |number of| Number |number of|Increase\r\n     when labeled.        |   of   |pods per |   of   |pods per |  from\r\n                          |racemes | raceme  |racemes | raceme  |watering.\r\n                          |labeled.|  that   |labeled.|  that   |\r\n                          |        | matured.|        | matured.|\r\n  ------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+---------\r\n  Flowers at the base of  |        |         |        |         |\r\n    the racemes just ready|   49   |  27.39  |   110  |  55.63  |  28.24\r\n    to open.              |        |         |        |         |\r\n                          |        |         |        |         |\r\n  Pods 3 to 6 days old    |   30   |  21.13  |   112  |  39.81  |  18.68\r\n                          |        |         |        |         |\r\n  Pods 9 to 12 days old   |   35   |  15.23  |    50  |  29.86  |  14.63\r\n                          |        |         |        |         |\r\n  ------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the water was noticeable soon after the first\r\napplication, as the leaves and flowers on this plant became turgid and\r\nthe anther sacs burst at the proper stage of their development. Very\r\nfew flowers fell after the second day. The water decidedly checked\r\nthe aborting of immature pods, as is shown by the results obtained on\r\nthe racemes which were labeled after the pods had formed. The racemes\r\nwhich contained pods 3 to 6 days old when labeled matured 9.95 pods to\r\nthe raceme more than those which contained older pods at the beginning\r\nof the experiment, but this was expected, as most of the aborting\r\nwhich caused this difference had taken place before the racemes were\r\nlabeled. As very few pods aborted before they were 3 to 6 days old, the\r\ndifference of 9.95 pods to the raceme in favor of the ones labeled\r\nwhen the flowers at their bases were just ready to open was largely\r\ndue to the dropping of the flowers on the older racemes before the\r\nexperiment was begun.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the production of mature pods on the plant not\r\nwatered was much greater on the racemes that were labeled before\r\nthe flowers opened than on the older racemes. This difference is\r\nundoubtedly due to the precipitation which fell on the sixth and tenth\r\ndays of the experiment. It is believed that the yield of 15.23 pods\r\nto the raceme on the ones labeled when the pods were 9 to 12 days old\r\nis representative of the production of pods per raceme previous to\r\nthe precipitation and that the other racemes on this plant would have\r\nyielded proportionately if conditions had remained the same.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1916, _Melilotus alba_ was planted in several\r\nlarge pots in the greenhouse of the Department of Agriculture at\r\nWashington, D. C. These pots were placed outside the greenhouse in\r\nthe late spring, where they remained until the following January,\r\nwhen they were taken into the greenhouse. The plants grew rapidly and\r\nbegan to flower during the latter part of April, 1917. At this time\r\ntwo pots were placed in a large cage made of screen having 20 meshes\r\nto the linear inch. One pot was submerged in a tub of water, so that\r\nthe soil was saturated at all times, while the plant in the other pot\r\nwas given only sufficient water to keep it from wilting. The pods on a\r\nfew racemes were self-pollinated and the results obtained are given in\r\nTable IX.\r\n\r\nTable IX.--_Effect of moisture on the seed production of\r\nMelilotus alba at Washington, D.

Doty, Instructor in Botany, Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa, in\r\nassisting in the preparation of this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nWhen agriculturists first began to cultivate wild legumes they observed\r\nthat many seeds would not germinate within a comparatively short time\r\nafter planting. Thus the problem of impermeable seeds began to demand\r\nattention many years ago. However, impermeable seeds are not confined\r\nto the Leguminosæ, as they occur also in the Malvaceæ, Chenopodiaceæ,\r\nConvolvulaceæ, Cannaceæ, and other families.\r\n\r\nSince the first account of the structure of legume seed coats by\r\nMalpighi (23 v. 1) in 1687, many investigators have contributed to our\r\nknowledge of the structure of the coats of seeds belonging to this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nPammel (31) made an extensive study of legume seeds, including all the\r\ngenera in the sixth edition of Gray's Manual, as well as genera not\r\nincluded in that publication. He found that the seed coat uniformly\r\nconsisted of three layers, namely, the outer layer of Malpighian cells,\r\nthe osteosclerid layer, and the inner layer of nutrient cells. Pammel's\r\nwork included a study of the seed coats of _Melilotus alba_ and _M.\r\nofficinalis_, and the descriptions and illustrations in his publication\r\nagree for the most part with the results obtained in the investigations\r\nreported in this article. However, more variation was noticed in the\r\ndifferent layers of the seed coat than he describes.\r\n\r\nThe cause of impermeability in seeds has been investigated by many.\r\nIt has been found to be due to the embryos in some seeds, such as the\r\nhawthorns, but in most cases to the structure of the seed coat, and\r\nespecially so in the Leguminosæ. Crocker (3) states that, exactly\r\nopposite to the common view, the cause of delayed germination generally\r\nlies in the seed coats rather than in the embryos. Nobbe (29) thought\r\nthat the hardness of leguminous seeds was due to the Malpighian layer,\r\nand in a later publication Nobbe and Haenlein (30, p. 81) state that\r\nthe absorbent power of many seeds is inhibited or entirely arrested\r\nby the cones of the Malpighian cells and the shields built up between\r\nthem, which consist principally of cutin. Huss (15) agrees with Nobbe\r\nand Haenlein. Verschaffelt (39) found that the impermeability of the\r\nseeds of Cæsalpiniaceæ and Mimosaceæ investigated was due to, the\r\ninability of water to pass through the canals of the seed coat. By\r\nsoaking the seeds in alcohol or other substances which change the\r\ncapillarity of the pores, the seed coats were made readily permeable\r\nto water. Gola (6) states that the cause of the impermeability of seeds\r\nis the peculiar character of the Malpighian cells, which prevents their\r\ninfiltration and consequent increase in volume, while Bergtheil and Day\r\n(2) found that the hardness of the seeds of _Indigofera arrecta_ was\r\ndue to their possession of a very thin outer covering of a substance\r\nresistant to water. Ewart (5, p. 185) believes that in most impermeable\r\nseeds the cuticle prohibits the absorption of water, but gives as an\r\nexception _Adansonia digitata_, in which the whole integument seems to\r\nbe permeable to water with difficulty. The following is quoted from\r\nWhite (42, p. 205):\r\n\r\n As a general rule in small and medium-sized seeds the cuticle is well\r\n developed and represents the impermeable part of the seed coat, while\r\n in the cases of large seeds, such as those of _Adansonia gregorii_,\r\n _Mucuna gigantea_, _Wistaria maideniana_, and _Guilandina bonducella_,\r\n the cuticle is relatively unimportant and inconspicuous. In these\r\n seeds the extreme resistance which they exhibit appears to be located\r\n in the palisade cells.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the seed coat of _Melilotus alba_, Rees (33, p. 404)\r\nstates that the outer layer consists of palisade cells covered,\r\nexternally by a structureless membrane, which, however, did not\r\nappear to be cuticle but hemicellulose, as it stained magenta with\r\nchloriodid of zinc. The greater part of the walls of the palisade\r\ncells also appears to be composed of hemicellulose and the outer ends\r\nonly were cuticularized. In order to find whether the outer membrane\r\nwas in itself impermeable to water, this author treated seeds for\r\nshort intervals in sulphuric acid to dissolve the outside covering\r\nwithout directly affecting the palisade cells. Seeds treated in this\r\nmanner swelled in water and microscopic examination showed that the\r\nends of the palisade cells were quite intact, but had separated from\r\neach other. From this it was concluded that the outer membrane is\r\ninstrumental in conferring impermeability on the seed, although not\r\ndirectly responsible for it, as is the case with a true cuticle. It\r\nis further believed that it probably served as a cement substance\r\nby means of which the cuticularized ends of the cells were held\r\ntogether closely, thus forming a barrier through which water could not\r\npenetrate, but that as soon as this barrier was removed the ends of the\r\npalisade cells separated and water passed in between them.\r\n\r\nMore than 20 years ago machines were devised by Kuntze, Michalowski\r\n(27, p. 86), Huss (15), and later by Hughes (14), to scarify\r\nimpermeable seeds. Other methods have been recommended and employed to\r\nsome extent for hastening the germination of seeds. Hiltner (13, p.\r\n44) treated seeds of red clover, white clover, and alfalfa 10, 30, and\r\n60 minutes with concentrated sulphuric acid and found that the best\r\ngermination resulted from the 60-minute treatment. Love and Leighty\r\n(21) also treated the seeds of various legumes with concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid and obtained a better germination in all cases. In\r\ntheir investigations with _Melilotus alba_ it was found that a 2-hour\r\ntreatment resulted in some injury to the seed, but that a treatment\r\nvarying from 25 minutes to 1 hour gave good results. In most cases in\r\nour investigations the seed coats of sweet clover became permeable\r\nto water after a treatment of 15 minutes in concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid, and within 5 minutes all of the Malpighian cells were destroyed\r\ndown to the light line. Harrington (10) found that the soil, season,\r\nclimate, color, or size of red-clover seeds had no influence upon\r\nthe percentage of impermeable seeds and that the good germination\r\nordinarily obtained with red clover was due to the scarifying of the\r\nseed coats by the rasps of hulling machines. Harrington (11) also\r\nstudied the agricultural value of impermeable seeds and found that\r\nalternations of temperature cause the softening and germinating of\r\nmany impermeable clover seeds when a temperature of 10° C. or cooler\r\nis used in alternation with a temperature of 20° C. or warmer and that\r\nthe effect of such an alternation of temperature is greatly increased\r\nby previously exposing the seeds to germinating conditions at a\r\ntemperature of 10° C. or cooler and is decreased by previously exposing\r\nthe seeds to germinating conditions at a temperature of 30° C. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that impermeable seeds which remain in the field over\r\nwinter germinate readily the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe light line is the most important and interesting feature of\r\nthe Malpighian cell, at least so far as _Melilotus alba_ and _M.\r\nofficinalis_ are concerned. But one light line occurs in the\r\nMalpighian cells in most Leguminosæ, although Pammel (32) reports two\r\nwell-developed light lines in _Gymnocladus canadensis_, Junowicz (16)\r\nfound three in _Lupinus varius_, and Sempolowski (36) two in _Lupinus\r\nangustifolius_.\r\n\r\nMany investigators have studied the light line, and different theories\r\nhave been advanced as to its function, physical properties, and\r\nchemical nature. Schleiden and Vogel (35, p. 26) in describing the\r\nmature testa of _Schizolobium excelsum_ in 1838 undoubtedly referred to\r\nthe light line when they stated that the walls of the Malpighian cells\r\nwere not equally thickened. Mettenius (26), in 1846, was probably the\r\nfirst definitely to describe the light line. This author believed it\r\nwas composed of pore canals, all appearing at the same height in the\r\ncells, but he was unable to prove this by cross sections. Lohde (20)\r\nstudied the light line in seeds of _Hibiscus trionum_ and found it\r\ncutinized. Hanstein (8) states that the Malpighian cells are composed\r\nof two cell layers and the light line is produced by the adjoining\r\nwalls of the ends of the cells. Later, this same author (9), according\r\nto Harz (12), refers to the light line as a perforated disk composed of\r\ntissue of strong refracting power.\r\n\r\nRussow (34) concludes that the light line is produced by neither\r\nchemical nor mechanical changes but is caused by a modified molecular\r\nstructure containing less water than the remainder of the cell wall.\r\nHiltner (13) agrees with Russow's explanation. Harz (12, p. 561) also\r\nagrees with Russow and adds that he has observed that the light line\r\ndisappeared in a number of cases after applications of nitric acid.\r\nWigand and Dennert (43) suggested that the light line is due to a\r\nseries of erect fissures, while Tietz (37, p. 32) believes it is due\r\nto a chemical modification and that the phenomenon results from the\r\nexceptionally extreme density of parts of the cellulose membrane.\r\nJunowicz (16) found evidence of cellulose material. The cell wall\r\nat this point was strongly refractive and had a different molecular\r\nstructure. After studying _Phaseolus vulgaris_, Haberlandt (7, p.\r\n38) agrees with the Russow explanation. In the seed of this plant\r\nthe light line colored blue after being treated with chloriodid of\r\nzinc. Sempolowski (36), who investigated the light line in _Lupinus\r\nangustifolius_, states that there is not only a difference in the\r\nmolecular structure but also a chemical modification of the cell wall\r\nat this point, since with iodin and sulphuric acid the cell wall\r\ncolored blue, whereas the light line colored yellow. Wettstein (41),\r\nwho studied seeds of Nelumbo, agrees with Russow (34) and Sempolowski\r\n(36) that chemical and physical modifications occur. He found that\r\niodin and sulphuric acid colored the Malpighian cells intensely blue,\r\nthe light line at first yellowish, and then later it gradually became\r\nblue. This reaction may be accelerated by heat. Iodin produced the same\r\neffect, and the light line colored blue more rapidly. When treated with\r\na water-withdrawing medium the light line was not altered for some\r\ntime, but finally disappeared with continued application. Cooking for a\r\nlong time in caustic potash or standing in cold caustic potash caused\r\nthe cells to swell, while the light line remained uninjured at first\r\nbut finally disappeared. He also believed that the absence of pore\r\ncanals in the region of the light line caused it to be more dense.\r\n\r\nNobbe and Haenlein (30) treated sections of seed coats of _Trifolium\r\npratense_ with iodin and sulphuric acid and found that the light line\r\ncolored blue as readily as the thickened ridges that radiate inward\r\nfrom it, but that the outer processes of the palisade cells projecting\r\nfrom the light line toward the cuticle stained dark brown. They also\r\nstate that various causes work to produce such unusual lusters in\r\nthe light line, the principle one of which is the thickened ridges\r\nwhich radiate inward, reach their greatest development at this point,\r\nand coalesce in the lumen of the cell. The result is that the light\r\nline falls upon a continuously homogeneous medium, while in the inner\r\nportions of the ridges the light passes through media of varying\r\nopacity, such as cellulose, water, and protoplasm, whereby it is\r\nprogressively subdued in varying degrees by partial reflection. Pammel\r\n(31, p. 147) studied the light line in _Melilotus alba_ and found that\r\nit consisted of a narrow but distinct refractive zone below the conical\r\nlayer. The refractive zone colored blue with chloriodid of zinc. The\r\nwhole upper part was, however, more or less refractive, while the\r\nremainder of the cell wall contained pigment and colored blue with\r\nchloriodid of zinc. Small canals project into the walls, in some cases\r\nextending beyond the light line.\r\n\r\nBeck (1) found that the light-refracting power of the light line was\r\nmuch greater than that of the undifferentiated membrane and stated that\r\nthere may be in addition to this a chemical difference which can not be\r\ndetected with the present microchemical methods. He does not believe\r\nthat it is cuticularized or that it contains less water than the rest\r\nof the cell.\r\n\r\nMarlière (24, p. 11) gives a physical explanation and states that\r\nthe true cause of the light line lies in the peculiar structure\r\nof the secondary membrane of the Malpighian cell. Tunmann (38, p.\r\n559) observed that it did not hydrolize in weak acids and therefore\r\ndecided that it was not hemicellulose. He found that it dissolved in\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid more readily than the regions surrounding\r\nit and that it was composed of pectin or callose. In our investigations\r\nthe main portion of the light line of _Melilotus alba_ and _M.\r\nofficinalis_ was very resistant to concentrated sulphuric acid, only\r\nthe narrow outer portion being attacked. It showed evidence of callose.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\r\n\r\nPermeable and impermeable seeds[4] of _Melilotus alba_ and _M.\r\nofficinalis_ were obtained from commercial samples and also from\r\nsamples collected in the field. Those selected for sectioning were\r\nallowed to dry after being removed from the germinator and then\r\nembedded on the ends of pine blocks in glycerin gum, which was made by\r\ndissolving 10 grams of powdered gum arabic in 10 c. c. of water and\r\nadding 40 drops of glycerin. After the glycerin gum had dried for 24\r\nhours, the seeds were easily sectioned. This method of embedding causes\r\nno change in the seed coat. It is more satisfactory than the paraffin\r\nmethod for holding the seeds firmly. The glycerin gum dissolved readily\r\nwhen the sections were mounted in water.\r\n\r\n[4] The term \"permeable\" is used in this paper to designate seeds whose\r\ncoats are permeable to water in two weeks or less at temperatures\r\nfavorable for germination, while the term \"impermeable\" is used to\r\ndesignate seeds whose seed coats are impermeable to water for this\r\nlength of time when temperatures are favorable for germination.\r\nImpermeable seeds are commonly referred to as \"hard seeds,\" and they\r\nmay become permeable in time.\r\n\r\nIn the microchemical studies Sudan III, alcanin, chlorophyll solution,\r\nand phosphoric acid iodin were used to test for cutin or suberin;\r\nsulphuric acid and iodin, chloriodid of zinc, and chloriodid of\r\ncalcium for cellulose; phloroglucin and hydrochloric acid for lignin;\r\nruthenium red for pectic substances; and sulphuric acid, Congo red, and\r\naniline blue for callose.\r\n\r\nWhere very thin sections were necessary for detailed study of the\r\nstructure of the seed coat, pods in various stages of development were\r\ncollected, and after the usual preliminary treatment they were embedded\r\nin paraffin and sectioned with the microtome. Microchemical tests were\r\nmade with these sections by using various specific stains. Safranin was\r\nused to test for cutin, suberin, and lignin; haematoxylin and methyl\r\nblue for cellulose ; methylene blue, methyl violet B, mauvein, and\r\nruthenium red for pectic substances; and aniline blue and Congo red for\r\ncallose. In studying some points with reference to the pore system of\r\nthe seed coat, it was necessary to use free-hand sections of fresh pods.\r\n\r\nIn studying the seed coat in relation to the absorption of water,\r\nboth permeable and impermeable seeds were soaked in water solutions\r\nof safranin, gentian violet, eosin, and haematoxylin, then dried and\r\nembedded in glycerin gum for sectioning. Seeds were soaked in stains\r\ndissolved in 95 per cent alcohol to test the penetration of alcohol. It\r\nwas evident that the seed coats did not act as a filter, as the stains\r\npassed through them with the water or alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE SEED COAT.\r\n\r\nThere is very little endosperm present in mature seeds of _Melilotus\r\nalba_ or _M. officinalis_. That which is present is quite permeable to\r\nwater and therefore bears no relation to the impermeable seeds of these\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe outer layer of the seed coat, which is the modified epidermal layer\r\nof the ovule, is known as the Malpighian layer. (Pl. V, figs. 1 and\r\n2.) The cells constituting this layer, commonly called palisade cells,\r\nare the most highly modified cells of the seed coat. They are very\r\nmuch elongated, their length varying in the different regions of the\r\ncoat, and their outer tangential walls and the outer portions of their\r\nradial walls are so much thickened that their lumina are confined to\r\nthe inner portion of the cells, sometimes occupying less than half the\r\nlength of the cells. The inner tangential walls and inner portions of\r\nthe radial walls are thickened just previous to the death of the cells,\r\nthe thickening sometimes being only slight and sometimes so much as to\r\nleave only very narrow lumina.\r\n\r\nThere is a very thin layer on the outer surface of the Malpighian\r\ncells which has been called cuticle by previous investigators, but\r\nthe chemical composition of this layer and its perviousness to water\r\nindicate that there is very little cutin present. This layer is\r\nprobably the primary epidermal cell wall rather than a deposit on the\r\nouter surface of the wall. To determine this a study of the development\r\nof the Malpighian cells is necessary.\r\n\r\nBeneath the so-called cuticle there is the much thickened outer portion\r\nof the Malpighian cells in which there are two rather distinct regions,\r\none constituting the conelike structures and the other forming a\r\ncontinuous layer over the conelike structures, separating them from\r\nthe cuticle and filling in between them. These two regions separate\r\neasily, and in cutting sections the outer region, called by some the\r\ncuticularized portion, often breaks away, leaving the entire surface of\r\nthe cones exposed.\r\n\r\nThe term \"cuticularized layer\" will be used to designate all of the\r\nthickening covering the cones, including that around the cones as well\r\nas the portion between the cones and the cuticle. This term is not\r\nentirely appropriate, for the region is practically free from cutin,\r\nbut for the want of a better term it will be used. There are canals\r\nin the cuticularized layer and cones, which are easily seen when the\r\nsections are treated with chloriodid of zinc or sulphuric acid. A\r\nsurface view of a section showing the cones and cuticularized layer\r\nwhen mounted in glycerin shows the canals as dark lines due to the\r\nair inclosed. The canals are most abundant along the lines where the\r\nlateral walls of the cells join, but many are within the cones and in\r\nthe cuticularized substance between the cones. (Pl. V, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe well-developed light line in _Melilotus alba_ and _M. officinalis_\r\nis found just below the bases of the cones. In some seed coats only\r\na few and in others none of the canals which are common in the cones\r\nand cuticularized region cross the light line. A very distinct line of\r\nsmall canals filled with air and thus forming a dark band is present\r\njust above the fight line, thus making the light line more conspicuous.\r\n(Pl. V, fig. 3.) When the lumina of the cells extend across the light\r\nline, they are exceedingly small. The light line is the most compact\r\nregion of the Malpighian layer and is conspicuous because it refracts\r\nthe light much more than the regions above and below it.\r\n\r\nJust below the Malpighian is a layer of cells variously modified and\r\nknown as the osteosclerid. The cells of this layer are often referred\r\nto as the hourglass cells on account of their shape. In some regions\r\nof the seed coat they are expanded at both ends and their walls are\r\nmuch thickened, the thickenings forming ridges on the radial walls,\r\nwhile in other regions only the upper tangential wall and a portion of\r\nthe radial walls are thickened and the cells are expanded only at the\r\ninner end, thus having the shape of the frustum of a cone. Beneath the\r\nosteosclerid layer is the nutrient layer.\r\n\r\nThe nutrient layer contains chloroplasts. It varies not only in the\r\nnumber of layers of cells composing it, but also in the modifications\r\nof these cells. This layer ranges from four to seven cells in thickness\r\nin the different parts of the seed coat.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nStructure of the Seed Coat of Sweet Clover.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Section of the seed coat of _Melilotus officinalis_. × 450.\r\nFig. 2.--Another section of the seed coat of _Melilotus officinalis_,\r\nshowing the variation in size and modifications that occur in the\r\nthree layers. × 450.

The lines between the cells were much\r\nmore distinct, appearing as small intercellular spaces through which\r\nsome stain passed. × 450. _a_, Cuticle; _b_, cuticularized layer; _c_,\r\nconelike portion of the thickening of the Malpighian cells; _d_, light\r\nline; _e_, region of a hard seed coat through which water and stains\r\nreadily passed; _l_, lumen; _M_, Malpighian cells; _N_, nutrient cells;\r\n_O_, osteosclerid cells; _p_, canals just above light zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROCHEMISTRY OF THE SEED COAT.\r\n\r\nTests for cutin showed that there was very little present in the seed\r\ncoat. Slight reactions for cutin were observed in the cuticle, in the\r\nouter margin of the cuticularized layer, and in the basal portion of\r\nthe cones. These reactions were so slight as to be almost negligible.\r\nIt is evident that the cuticle and cuticularized layer are not well\r\nnamed in _Melilotus alba_ and _M. officinalis_. Tests for cellulose\r\nshowed that it was present in the cuticle, cuticularized layer, cones,\r\nthe walls of the Malpighian cells below the light line, and the walls\r\nof the cells of the osteosclerid and nutrient layers. (Pl. V, fig. 9.)\r\nThe reaction for cellulose in the Malpighian cells was quite distinct\r\nin the walls below the light line, less distinct in the cones and\r\ncuticle, and least distinct in the cuticularized layer.\r\n\r\nTests for lignin occasionally showed slight traces in the Malpighian\r\ncells below the light line. When treated with reagents for pectic\r\nsubstances, the cuticle, cuticularized layer, cones, and all cell walls\r\nbelow the light line gave a definite reaction. The reaction of the\r\ncones and cuticle was more pronounced than the cuticularized layer.\r\nTests for callose gave no reaction except in the upper part of the\r\nlight line. This part of the light line stained slightly blue with\r\naniline blue and was easily dissolved with sulphuric acid. In cutting\r\nfree-hand sections of fresh material the Malpighian layer sometimes\r\nbroke along this line. The greater part of the light line reacted to\r\nnone of the tests, and its chemical nature was not determined.\r\n\r\nWhen microtome sections of seeds in different stages of development\r\nwere treated with various stains, the results were in accord with those\r\nobtained with free-hand sections. Thus with safranin the periphery and\r\ncones of the Malpighian cells were slightly stained, while haematoxylin\r\nand methyl blue stained all the seed coat except the light line. The\r\ncones and cuticle stained more readily than the cuticularized layer,\r\nbut neither stained as deeply as the cell walls below the light line.\r\nMethylene blue, methyl violet B, and mauvein stained all above the\r\nlight line, indicating the presence of pectic substances; however, the\r\nstaining was more prominent in the cones and cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe difference in reaction of the cones and cuticularized layer to\r\nthe cellulose and pectose tests probably indicates a difference in\r\ndensity rather than a difference in chemical composition. Since the\r\ncuticularized layer separates readily from the cones, there may be a\r\ndifference in physical properties.\r\n\r\nWith Congo red the upper part of the light line was only very slightly\r\nstained, but aniline blue had a more pronounced effect.\r\n\r\nThe microchemical tests applied to the seed coat show that in the\r\nregion above the light line there is only a slight trace of cutin\r\nor suberin, but a considerable amount of cellulose and pectose. All\r\ncell walls below the light line are mainly cellulose but contain some\r\npectose. The upper portion of the light line contains callose, but the\r\nremainder of the light line appears to be chemically different from all\r\nother parts of the seed coat or else so dense as to resist the attack\r\nof the reagents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEED COAT IN RELATION TO THE ABSORPTION OF WATER.\r\n\r\nA study of permeable seeds soaked in water containing stains showed\r\nthat there were no local regions through which the water passed.\r\nThe stains passed through all regions of the seed coat. Coating the\r\nmicropylar region with vaseline retarded germination, but had no\r\neffect upon the percentage of germination at the end of three days. In\r\nseed coats through which the stain had passed, the light line was not\r\nstained. Some stain was found in the canals which crossed the light\r\nline, and much more in the cell cavities. There was no evidence that\r\nthe stain had permeated the substance of the light line. It was able to\r\ncross the light line only when pores were present.\r\n\r\nIn impermeable seeds the stains passed readily to the light line.\r\n(Pl. V, fig. 7.) It was evident that the absorption of water was\r\nnot prevented by either the cuticularized layer or the cone-shaped\r\nstructures of the Malpighian layer, but by the light line. The region\r\noutside of the light line became stained in a few hours, but there\r\nwas no trace of the stain within the light line after the seeds had\r\nremained a week in the stains. Alcohol did not penetrate the seed coat\r\nmore readily than water.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPARISON OF PERMEABLE AND IMPERMEABLE SEED COATS.\r\n\r\nNo difference in chemical structure was found between the coats of\r\npermeable and impermeable seeds. The principal differences were in the\r\ncharacter and amount of thickening of the cell walls.\r\n\r\nIn many of the permeable seeds some of the canals were found to extend\r\nacross the light line, but this was not true for all permeable seeds.\r\n(Pl. V, fig. 8.) Oblique sections of permeable seed coats showed that\r\nthe cell cavities, although reduced to mere pores by the thickening of\r\ntheir radial walls, extended across the light line into the base of the\r\ncones, thus forming a passageway through which the stains passed to the\r\nlarger portions of the cell cavities below the light line. (Pl. V, fig.\r\n4.)\r\n\r\nIn the coats of the impermeable seeds the light line was usually\r\nbroader, the Malpighian cells thickened more below the light line,\r\nand the main cavities of the Malpighian cells were more reduced and\r\nfarther below the light line than in the coats of permeable seeds. (Pl.\r\nV, fig. 6.) No canals except occasionally a few very small ones were\r\nseen crossing the light line in impermeable seeds. Cross and oblique\r\nsections showed that the lumina of the Malpighian cells were closed\r\nin the region of the light line. Thus it was found that permeable and\r\nimpermeable seeds differ mainly in the amount of thickening which\r\noccurs in the walls of the Malpighian cells. In the impermeable seeds\r\nthe thickening which begins at the outer tangential wall of the\r\nMalpighian cell extends farther toward the inner tangential wall,\r\nleaving the cell lumina smaller and farther below the light line than\r\nin permeable seeds. The thickening is also more complete in impermeable\r\nseeds, leaving fewer and smaller canals across the light line as well\r\nas closing the cell lumina in the region of the light line.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID ON THE COATS OF IMPERMEABLE SEEDS.\r\n\r\nImpermeable seeds were soaked in concentrated sulphuric acid (sp. gr.\r\n1.84) for 15, 30, and 60 minutes; then washed and put in the staining\r\nsolutions. After they had swollen, they were removed from the staining\r\nsolutions, dried, and embedded in glycerin gum. A study of these seeds\r\nshowed that the acid had eaten away all of the material outside of the\r\nlight line and that the stain had passed through all regions of the\r\nseed coat. (Pl. V, fig. 10.) When observed under the microscope, it was\r\nseen that the action of the acid was rapid, destroying the cuticle,\r\ncuticularized layer, and cones in about 5 minutes. After 15 minutes\r\ntreatment with acid the light line, aside from the presence of canals\r\nand pores not previously visible, seemed to be very little affected.\r\nThe division lines along which the lateral walls of the Malpighian\r\ncells were joined now became much more distinct across the light line,\r\nthus indicating that there was some swelling in this region. When a\r\nclose examination of the path of the stain was made the cell lumina,\r\nand occasionally very small pores, were found to extend across the\r\nlight line. The presence of the stain in the pores indicated that\r\nthey were paths of the stain across the light line. Some of the stain\r\npassed along the lines between cells and through the occasional canals\r\ncrossing the light line, but judging from the intensity of the stain in\r\nthe lumina the canals appeared to be the principal passageways.\r\n\r\nThe action of the acid in opening the cell cavities across the light\r\nline was not determined. It may be due to the swelling of the light\r\nline or to the removal of substances closing the pores.\r\n\r\nNo seeds were exposed to the acid for longer than an hour, but at the\r\nend of this period the light line was still intact. As compared with\r\nother portions of the Malpighian layer, it is extremely resistant to\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid. Since all cell walls below the light line\r\nare mainly cellulose, the resistance of the light line prevents the\r\nacid from destroying the entire seed coat and reaching the embryo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Beck, Gunther.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1878.
