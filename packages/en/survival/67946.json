Then it\r\nran blood and became history. For it takes blood to make history.\r\n\r\nWhen Bragg went to pieces two months later, after the shambles of\r\nMissionary Ridge, Hooker’s Corps was the pack turned loose to harry him\r\nout of the valley. They rushed thoughtlessly—Hooker’s hounds always\r\ndid—and the foremost quickly paid the tax which Rashness pays to Reason.\r\nCleburne, the rebel general, who brought up the rear of Bragg’s army,\r\nturned, wolf-like, at a gap in the mountains and cut to pieces the hound\r\nthat had outstripped the pack in its zeal to snap at harried haunches.\r\nThe hound whimpered and fell back, but not before Cleburne had shingled\r\nthe sides of the mountain with the dead of the Yankee army.\r\n\r\nThe General who claimed the cut-up regiment was mad, and as he rode,\r\nwith his staff, to the front, he was swearing in a deep, jerky, guttural\r\nvoice. He stopped to look at the bloody gap, the lusty, voiceless,\r\nblue-coated forms, lying so weirdly unnatural—as trees when the hurricane\r\nhas passed: “Mountain gaps—they are little traps of hell,” he kept\r\nrepeating, and he spurred on for a guide—to a cracker cabin higher up on\r\nthe mountain side.\r\n\r\nThe General rode a clean-limbed, loosely-ribbed, long-back thoroughbred,\r\nfresh from a blue grass paddock in Middle Tennessee. For he was weak\r\non horse-flesh, and had impressed this scion of a Derby winner before\r\nRosecrans went North.\r\n\r\nTwo mountaineers stood in the cabin yard. One was middle-aged,\r\nsullen-eyed and stooped, but standing six feet with the stoop. He leaned\r\non an unmounted axe-helm, and as he stood slouching, long armed, bowed in\r\nthe legs, his hairy chest gleaming through open shirt front, he looked\r\nnot unlike a great gorilla, brought to bay with uprooted club in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe other man was not much more than a boy, except in size. He was\r\nlarger, bigger chested, bigger fisted, and his wonder-haunted, kindly\r\nface wore a smile instead of a scowl. Never before had he seen the flag\r\nwhich one of the officers carried. Never such a horse as the one ridden\r\nby the man in front—never such a horse, and how he did love horses!\r\n\r\nBut the thoroughbred shied at the sight of the bearded man and sprang\r\nsideways, snorting, and wheeled to run. The boy’s face broke over in a\r\nquizzical, familiar grin, and he drawled exultantly:\r\n\r\n“Say, Mister, whut yo ridin’ there?” The man turned sullenly and knocked\r\nhim down with the axe-helm. He went down helplessly and with a subdued\r\nsurprise in his blue eyes. The man did not turn his body, but stood\r\nindifferently, watching him slowly arising, wiping the blood from his\r\nforehead and whimpering like a struck cub:\r\n\r\n“Ef mammy hadn’t tuck an’ went an’ died—I promised mammy I’d nurver\r\nstrike ye, dad.” He blew the blood from his nose and stood scratching one\r\nleg with the bare foot of the other, whimpering still, and dazed.\r\n\r\n“Solomon Hosea Hanks, ye’re a blatherin’ yearlin’ an’ ’ll allers be one.\r\nAin’t I knocked ye down often fur buttin’ in ye horns befo’ ye’re axed up\r\nto the trough?”\r\n\r\nHe was talking to the boy, but saying it for the men in front:\r\n“Gentlemen, ’light an’ look at yer saddles. I’m jes teachin’ the lad some\r\nmanners—you hafter teach ’em to some folks with a club.”\r\n\r\nThe boy suddenly straightened up. Half defiantly, and with quick\r\neagerness, he leaped across the path where sat the color-bearer. He\r\nstopped beneath the flag and began to fondle it as a child would—the\r\npretty stars, the gold cord that fell from the eagle above: “Ye’ll nurver\r\nknock me down ag’in, Dad. Ye’re a g’erriller an’ ye know it, an’ ye\r\nwanter make me one, but I’ve seen my country’s colors to-day an’ I’m\r\ngoin’ ter jine.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to the group: “I know whut you want, Mister-men, an’ I’ll\r\nlead you over the mount’in ef you’ll let me jine. ’Taint uverbody\r\nI’ll let knock me down”—he wagged his head at the man with whimpering\r\napology—“promised mammy afo’ she tuck an’ went an’ died I’d nurver strike\r\nhim”—\r\n\r\nA rattling volley of shots rang out across the mountain, down in the next\r\nvalley. They were echoed back, then shouts, and when the General wheeled,\r\nthe boy had struck out toward the firing, his tough, bare feet crounching\r\nthe gravel as he strode on in his shambling way. They followed him, but\r\ncould not overtake the long, swinging trot in the crooked path amid the\r\nboulders and clay roots. On a projection beyond the ridge he stopped,\r\ncalling back to the man:\r\n\r\n“Far’well, Dad—you’ll nurver see me aga’in onless I hear you’ve beat\r\nlittle Dinah Mariah—then I’ll come back an’ forgit I urver had a mammy.”\r\nHe shook his great fist at the man still standing immovable, then: “Come\r\non, Mister-men—Bragg’s a good dog, but Holdfas’ is better.”\r\n\r\nAnd that is how Solomon came into the camp of the Tenth.\r\n\r\nHe led them to the firing line, where the General suddenly found plenty\r\nto do. So much that he forgot Solomon until the brigade went into camp\r\nfive miles further, on the trail of the retreating enemy. Then Solomon\r\nstaggered in through the darkness to the camp fire carrying a half dead\r\nConfederate on his back. He laid the man down on a bed of leaves near\r\nthe mess tent of the Tenth. He lifted the helpless head very tenderly\r\nand gave him water while the stricken one kept whispering, “Water—more\r\nwater—for God’s sake—and death!”\r\n\r\nThe staff had been laughing and swearing before, with tin cups full of\r\nmountain whisky. For they were tired, and death had sprung up so often\r\nand so suddenly that day from batteries and trenches and mountain gorges;\r\nand from still, restful copses of silent woods, peaceful and inviting,\r\nuntil—Spit! Spit!—and the rattlesnake of sharp-shooting rifles spat out\r\nthe virus which had put comrades and mess-mates to sleep. But now the\r\nsilence and the night fell from the deep treetops together. That dying\r\nman in the camp, that strange, solemn giant of the woods—\r\n\r\nThe General, his tin cup half emptied, spoke first, in a voice strangely\r\nsoft, the staff thought, for the old fighter:\r\n\r\n“Any kin to you, Solomon—the man there?”\r\n\r\n“He’s mighty nigh to me—mighty nigh.”\r\n\r\n“Ah—sorry—sorry. And who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Jes’ my brother, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, too bad—sorry—sorry”—and the staff muttered the echo.\r\n\r\nThen the General put down his cup, went over and glanced at the man.\r\nHe stepped back quickly and hastily drained the tin cup: “Nasty fix,\r\nSolomon—sorry—but we’ll do what we can for him. When did you see him\r\nlast?”\r\n\r\n“Nurver seed him befo’—but thar’s hund’erds of ’em—all our brothers,\r\n’specially when we’ve shot ’em an’ they’re helpless an’ dyin’.”\r\n\r\nThe General winced and turned quickly to the fire. The staff went after\r\nanother drink. Solomon’s eye fell on the mess table—the supper set forth\r\nand waiting; then Solomon fell on the supper. Between mouthfuls he\r\ngrowled out:\r\n\r\n“You fellers orter be ashamed o’ yerselves to shoot a man’s innards out\r\nlike that. I found him three miles beyant the mount’in whar you-uns fit\r\nthar this mornin’ an’ I fetch’t him over on my back.”\r\n\r\nThat reminded him. He picked up some hardtack and bacon and started\r\ntoward the groaning man. Then he stopped, disappointed: “Whut’s the\r\nuse—he’s got no whur to put it. You-uns done shot his innards out. The\r\nfust lickin’ Dad gin me was fur shootin’ a b’ar in ther innards.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down again and ate everything in sight. The General and staff got\r\nbusy at something else. Solomon gave the dying man another drink and\r\nbegan looking around like a huge bear-dog for a spot to roll up on, and\r\nsleep. He found it in the General’s blanket, his huge feet sticking out,\r\nbunion covered and black. They thought he was asleep and coming quietly\r\nback one by one, sat down, and were eating in silence when a shock of\r\nhair blurred up out of the blanket:\r\n\r\n“Say, Mister-men, but ain’t war hell sho’ nuff? But tell the boys not to\r\nshoot ther Innards out—’taint fair.” Then he slept.\r\n\r\nThe General waited till he heard him snoring: “Major, if you happen to\r\nlose him to-morrow in the first skirmish—really, I don’t think we need\r\nhim, Major?” The Major was sure they did not—so were the others.\r\n\r\nThey made the dying man as comfortable as they could, the General sparing\r\nhis own warm rain-coat for the limbs now rapidly chilling. But his groans\r\nkept them awake: “Water—water—oh, God—water and death—kill me, somebody!”\r\n\r\nThe cry fell out of the silence with the starlight, mingling strangely\r\nwith the shivering wail of a screech owl—so uncannily mingling that they\r\nseemed as one.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight when the General saw the foot withdrawn, the big\r\nform arise and slouch over to the dying man: “Water—water—and, oh, for\r\nGod’s sake—have mercy and kill me.”\r\n\r\nSolomon tenderly lifted the gasping lips to the canteen: “Do yo’ means\r\nit—want me to kill ye sho’ nuff, brother?”\r\n\r\nThe man’s eyes were beseeching as he gasped: “I——can’t——live——death\r\nevery——minute——put me——out of misery—God will——reward you.”\r\n\r\nSolomon’s eyes were wet with tears. His great pitying heart thumped\r\nloudly: “How, brother? Whut with?”\r\n\r\nThe dying man nodded at a bayonetted rifle near by: “That——push\r\nthat——through my heart——quick!”\r\n\r\nThe General arose just in time. Solomon, with a strange sob in his\r\nthroat, stood over the man, the gun poised, the bayonet’s point—\r\n\r\n“My God, Solomon!”—and he grasped the descending gun by the barrel. “This\r\nis murder—I’ll have you shot!” The giant turned on him astonished: “He\r\ncyant live—you-uns shot him to pieces. That’s war. I put him out o’ his\r\nmisery—that’s murder. Strange—strange! Brother,” he stooped and whispered\r\nregretfully to the man, who beseeched him with fixed, unwinking eyes,\r\n“Brother, I’d do it—God knows I’d like ter ’commodate yer, but ye heurn\r\nyo’self.” Still lower: “But say, brother, ef you fin’ ye cyant stan’ it\r\nno longer—when they sleep—call Solomon—an’ I’ll sho’ ’commodate you in\r\nthis. God bless ye.”\r\n\r\nLater there was a rigid stiffening and gasps among the leaves and Solomon\r\nknew there was no need for his bayonet.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when the General arose, Solomon had fed and rubbed down\r\nAjax, the thoroughbred. He stood talking to himself—he had forgotten the\r\nwar: “Whut a hoss—whut legs—whut muscles, like bees a swarming! I’ve\r\nallers dreamed o’ keerin’ fur sech!” He turned to the General: “I’ll\r\ntake keer o’ him from now on.” The General was touched and when he shook\r\nSolomon’s hand the bond was sealed.\r\n\r\n“How long have you been up, Solomon?”\r\n\r\n“Two hours b’ day—Gen’l.” It was the first time he had used the word and\r\nthe old fighter inwardly scored one more point for the horse—that could\r\nprune the pride of the mountaineer—he who knew no titles, no superior.\r\n\r\n“Ye see, Gen’l, forgot yistiddy to kiss Dinah Mariah good-bye. She’s the\r\nlittle deef-mute mammy lef’ befo’ she tuck an’ went an’ died. I raised\r\nher—gi’n her urver rappin she had ’cep the milk she drunk, an’ wish’t I\r\nc’ud er gi’n her that. Dad’s been so tarnel mean to her. D’ye know I had\r\nan idee that he wanted ter put her out o’ the way? So I steps back over\r\nthe mount’in an into the cabin whur they all sleeps—all ’leven on ’em.\r\nBut ye know I couldn’t kiss ’er good-bye, seein’ ’er sleepin’ thar so\r\nsweet?” He struck savagely at his eyes with his big-knuckled fist. “But\r\nI fetched this—I’ve jined fur the war an’ I wants my own gun—don’t like\r\nther blunderbusses you-uns shoots. This un’s a Deckerd—been thro’ ther\r\nRevolushun, an’ with Ole Hickory at New ’leans. It’s fittin’ fur it to\r\nfit ag’in fur the Union. Thar—see!” and he pointed the gun high up at the\r\nlimb of a big oak.\r\n\r\nThe General saw nothing until the great flint and steel snapped together\r\nlike the jaws of an alligator, and he had a tender but headless fox\r\nsquirrel for his breakfast, cooked, later, by Solomon’s own hand. “An’ I\r\ndon’t shoot ther innards out, nurther,” he growled.\r\n\r\n“You needn’t lose him, Major,” chuckled the general, as he pulled off\r\na succulent hind limb, roasted on a green stick-spittle over a pit of\r\ncoals. The Major having the mate of it in his own mouth, could not speak,\r\nbut nodded vigorously.\r\n\r\nA hard winter and deadly fighting between Missionary Ridge and Atlanta:\r\nbut Solomon enlivened it for the Tenth. For he was their brother and his\r\nquaint sayings became their intellectual stock in trade. For instance:\r\n“The —— Iowa flickered at Dug’s Creek. Then they sulked.” They had done\r\nit before. “What shall I do with them?” snarled the General that night in\r\ncamp. Solomon drawled in:\r\n\r\n“’Pint ’em ter bury ther dead—they’re nat’ul born pallbearers. I’ve seed\r\nlots o’ folks that was.”\r\n\r\nWhen old Tecumseh Sherman heard of this he offered to promote Solomon to\r\na corporalcy:\r\n\r\n“Nun—no,” said Solomon, “then I’d hafter wear boots an’ a unerform. An’\r\nsay, them thar unerforms you-uns wear meks you-uns look jes lak them\r\nlittle flyin’ stink-ants that swarms out in the spring. God didn’t inten’\r\nno two fol’ks ter be alike. Es fur boots, they fus’ jes make yer feet\r\ntender an’ then wears out. I’ve got on a pa’r thet nurver wears out.”\r\n\r\nHe figured next in a horse race with a Kentucky regiment which was first\r\nunwise enough to cast aspersions on the speed of Ajax and then bold\r\nenough to back them with the long green. It was a great race run between\r\ntwo lines of howling blue. “Nurver bet agin natur’,” said Solomon dryly,\r\nas he pocketed all the money of the Republic which the unwise Kentuckians\r\nhad. “Ajax is by natur’ a horse an’ your’n ain’t.”\r\n\r\nFor a week after that the Tenth indulged in vain and effeminate luxuries.\r\n\r\nSpring brought the fighting and the tragedy—of the latter, Solomon was\r\nthe ink.\r\n\r\nThey made him color-bearer—he was so strong, and it was so easy to see\r\nhim in his coon-skin cap, his Deckerd strapped to his back. For he would\r\nnot lay it down even while carrying the flag. At Resaca he took the\r\ncolors through balls which came thick enough to stop a bluebird. Mines\r\ncut the tail from his cap, a buck-and-ball cleared one foot of bunions,\r\nand canister carried his canteen bodily from his body; but in the thick\r\nof it he yelled out savagely at the General: “Say, thar, Gen’l, get out\r\no’ thar on that hoss! You mout get ’im hurt!”\r\n\r\nHe spent the next week nursing the wounded enemy: “For ain’t they our\r\nbrothers?” he asked, and the scoffers in blue were silent.\r\n\r\nA beautiful valley beyond Resaca and Solomon had never seen such rich\r\nland. A grand mansion in the valley and Solomon had never seen such a\r\nhouse. The General had pitched his camp near by. A thousand other camps\r\ndotted the valleys and hills. A hundred battle flags fluttered from their\r\nstaffs. There was planning, priming; trenches crept across the hills in\r\nthe night, like mole-paths in a garden, and the valleys were billowed\r\nwith them, cannon crowned and picketed with steel. They would give little\r\nJoe his death blow.\r\n\r\nSolomon stood sentinel that night by the big house on the lawn. It was\r\nnever the color-bearer’s duty to stand sentinel—but “Yer see, Gen’l,\r\nAjax is stalled right over thar beyant, an’ them brothers o’ our’n from\r\nKentucky loves a good hoss.”\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight and the army was asleep. There was a light\r\nsuspiciously faint in the window of the big house. Solomon slipped up and\r\npeeped in through a blind slat, awry. He stepped back blushing, ashamed\r\nthat he had peeped. He picked up his Deckerd. The light went out and the\r\ndoor opened silently and a handsome man dressed in citizens’ clothes\r\nkissed a Beautiful One good-bye. Then he slipped out into the dark and\r\nmounted a horse hid so securely as to surprise Solomon, with his keen\r\nmountain eyes.\r\n\r\n“Halt, thar, brother, an’ gin the countersign.”\r\n\r\nPistol shots buzzing from the cylinder of Colt, and that quick grapple\r\nof horse hoofs in the gravel which tells of a rowel driven in suddenly;\r\nthen the sound of a flying horse through the lane.\r\n\r\nSilence, then quaintly as if talking to himself: “A cyclone spiked with\r\nhell-fire! Solomon, yer nurver had so narrow a shave—yer’ll be keerful\r\nther nex’ time yer brother a gatlin’-gun buckled to a thoroughbred.”\r\n\r\nThe girl clutched the window—white and with eyes lit with flashes of the\r\nweird starlight. It seemed a half hour to Solomon before he heard her\r\ngive a rippling, cut-off laugh, and the dawn sprang to her cheeks as the\r\nstarlight went out of her eyes. High up on the mountain she had seen what\r\nSolomon had not—a splinter of light leap out of the heart of the mountain\r\nbeyond the picket lines. Solomon was still watching her—so strangely\r\nfascinated that he had not noticed the blood running down his arm. She\r\nclosed the window with a happy laugh, and Solomon felt that it was now\r\nnight—all around him.\r\n\r\nAnd so the spell of the big house was upon Solomon and he begged to stand\r\nguard next day. It was early and he stood silent before the splendor of\r\nthe house, the marble steps, the big, hooded gables, then—\r\n\r\n“God! she’s comin’!”\r\n\r\nHe turned—no, he was a sentinel—he could not run. She wore white—fluffy\r\nand airy in the warm June morning. Above—\r\n\r\n“Molasses candy hair,” said Solomon, licking his mouth, “an’, oh, Lord,\r\nBlack-Eyed-Susan eyes!”\r\n\r\nHe thought again of running. Then of the wild fawn that once ran to meet\r\nhim, off in the mountain woods, so innocent that it knew not that death\r\ndwelt with man.\r\n\r\nHe slipped behind a tree. Never before had he been ashamed of his bare\r\nfeet. He peeped out—she was still coming—no, she had come, and he turned\r\npale and his knees trembled, for there she stood smiling as only an angel\r\ncould, and holding something out to him:\r\n\r\n“I know you must be hungry, and it is so good of you to guard our house.\r\nNow, please let me serve you your breakfast.”\r\n\r\nOff came his coon-skin cap. Her smile, her eyes made him homesick. He\r\nsaw the summer lightning playing at midnight around the peaks of Tiger\r\nHead. Then tears welled which made him hate himself—him a soldier of the\r\nTenth—and he slipped farther around the tree. She was serious instantly,\r\nand her beautiful eyes had sized him up—gratitude, homesickness, all—and\r\nwhen she peeped around the tree again—after awhile, and he had had time\r\nto brace himself, she laughed a musical, comrady laugh, and—\r\n\r\n“Now, please don’t be offended, for I should love so much to be your\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\nAgain the homesickness. That laugh, that voice—it was the silver ripple\r\nof Telulah Falls under the white stars of the mountain. That meant home\r\nand Dinah Mariah. Trembling, dazed and choking with the swelling that\r\nmade him wish to do something—to do something grand for once in his life,\r\nhe tried to speak, but ended in bringing his Deckerd to present arms. She\r\nlaughed, saluting him in turn with a saucy military flash of her pretty\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Miss—Miss”—\r\n\r\n“Nellie,” she said, sympathetically, helping him out.\r\n\r\n“Do they—breed ’em—all like you-uns down here?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed and handed him the plate. Solomon knew the ham, but did not\r\nknow what the rolls and the orange were. His hand touched hers—he fumbled\r\nand dropped the plate: “God, but I thort I—I teched fire!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” and the hurt look made Solomon wish to fight something for her\r\nsake—“but I’ll soon be back with more.” She turned with a pretty gesture.\r\n\r\n“Don’t—don’t,” he called, “send it by a nigger. Who can eat with a angel\r\nlookin’?” She laughed so heartily at this that Solomon was soon himself.\r\nWhen she brought him another plate he forgot everything except he had\r\nseen her, that at last into his life something had come. He wished very\r\nmuch to impress her—to say something grand, but everything he tried to\r\nsay ended in a brag—so unusual for Solomon:\r\n\r\n“I was heah las’ night a-guardin’ you-uns, an’ I come mighty nigh killin’\r\na man.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”—and the fun went out of her eyes. “I am so grateful to you.\r\nDid—did—he hurt you when he fired?”\r\n\r\nAll the brag went out of him. Not for the world would he have her know\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“No—but—it was a narrow shave.”\r\n\r\n“I am so glad—you see he—was—my brother.”\r\n\r\n“Sho’ nuff?” and Solomon guffawed. Somehow it relieved him so to know he\r\nwas only a brother. “Wal, now, how strange! But the Gen’l was tellin’ us\r\n’bout a Johnny Scout in here, a tall feller in citizens’ clothes. Oh,\r\nhe’s played the devil with us. He knows our plans better’n we do. We ’low\r\nwe s’prise little Joe at Dug’s Gap, but little Joe s’prises us. Then we\r\n’low we’ll trap him at Resaca an’ swing round on his flank. But he come\r\nnigh trappin’ us. We laid for him mighty keerful at New Hope an’ saunt\r\nHoward to turn his flank. He turned our’n. It’s all that’r scout, and so\r\nthe Gen’l sed when he saunt me out las’ night: “Solomon, shoot anything\r\nin citizens’ clothes that tries to buck our lines. Kill him fust an’ ax\r\nhim whur he’s goin’ after’uds.” So when he steps out las’ night—that\r\nbrother er your’n—I was right thar watchin’, an’ I flung up my old\r\nDeckerd an’ I drawed a bead on him—it was all so plain, him outlined in\r\nthe starlight. But he looked so han’sum a-settin a hoss so lak Ajax thet\r\nI sed: ”No, I’ll not shoot him—he’s somebody’s brother. An’ sho’ nuff he\r\nwas your’n!”\r\n\r\nThe girl turned white, then pink. Tears came to her eyes, the sight of\r\nwhich made Solomon’s jaws set in stern decision. He pitied her, thinking\r\nof Dinah Mariah—his sister. He swelled savagely: “Say, but don’t you cry.\r\nI’ll lick arry man that ’ud hurt yo’ brother!”\r\n\r\n“That is so sweet of you,” she said softly.\r\n\r\n“Then I fetched my piece down an’ axed him fur the countersign an’—wal,”\r\nhe nodded his head up and down meaningly—“I got it!” He rolled up his\r\nsleeve and showed the red furrow of another across his arm.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am so sorry—do—do come in and let mamma and me dress it.”\r\n\r\nSolomon laughed: “Now, don’t bother ’bout it, Miss—yo’ bein’ sorry has\r\nalready cured it. I’d have it dressed but Gen’l ’ud find out an’ say I\r\nwas a fool fur not shootin’.”\r\n\r\nBut she dressed it—she and a stately White-haired one, bringing the salve\r\nand bandages out to his beat; and when they had finished and the smarting\r\npain had ceased, Solomon belonged to them.\r\n\r\nThen came the strange change in Solomon. He did not know what it meant.\r\nWhy he put on the uniform, the cavalry boots and the big spurs. Why he\r\nwanted to strut and swell in the pride of his six feet three, when the\r\nold General blurted out:\r\n\r\n“Solomon, damned if you ain’t real handsome—what’s come over you?”\r\n\r\n“Gen’l—Gen’l, I dunno—but I finds myse’f struttin’ jes like a wood-cock\r\nin the spring.”\r\n\r\n“Oho,” laughed the General, “look out, Solomon.”\r\n\r\nThat was all open—seen of all men. But secretly, silently, painfully—in\r\nthe depths of his great soul something stirred within him that he told to\r\nno man, for he knew not what it was. What it did he knew: “God, it lifts\r\nme out o’ the clay o’ myse’f!”\r\n\r\nNever had he been so happy. Ride? He could ride Ajax over a whole\r\nregiment. He could lick Johnston’s whole army. “An’ the cu’is part,\r\nSolomon—yer fool—you are wantin’ to fight outwardly, but in’ardly you are\r\ncryin’ all the time.”\r\n\r\nIt hurt him when he saw her. He was sorry when she brought him his meals;\r\nhe got behind a tree and wept when she left, and in this state he stopped\r\none day and turned white: “God, mebbe it’s that thar blin’ staggers I’ve\r\ngot—that I heur’n so o’ fo’ks havin’ in the rich valleys.” The dreadful\r\nblind staggers he had heard of all his life—that never came to those high\r\nup in the pure air of the mountain! He was sure they had him.\r\n\r\nIt was the third day and twilight, and when she came out, bringing his\r\nsupper, the red ribbon in the white of her gown, her dark eyes above,\r\nmade him think of the tiger lilies that grew by Telulah. He pretended not\r\nto see her and when she blocked his path with a pretty smile and salute,\r\nhe feigned astonishment:\r\n\r\n“Law, but I thort the moon had riz!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are a poet, Solomon, and a dreadful flatterer,” but she laughed\r\nin so pleased a way that Solomon swelled up in his great chest and blew\r\ndeep and long, snorting it out, to loosen the great hurting feeling that\r\nwas there. Then, too, he had seen Ajax do it with the thunder of battle\r\nin his nostrils.\r\n\r\nShe sat on the stump before him, kicking her slippered heels against the\r\nrough bark and watching him so keenly with measuring, wistful eyes.\r\n\r\n“Solomon, I have been thinking, and mother and I want you to come in the\r\nhouse and hear my music. You have been so good to us and we are so fond\r\nof you.” She jumped down, took his hand and led him. It burned him—it\r\nmade him gasp for breath, yet all he could do was to follow.\r\n\r\nAnd the house—never before had he seen splendor. They had trouble\r\npersuading him to step on the rugs and to walk on the carpets. But the\r\nsweet-faced, white-haired lady came graciously forward and shook his hand\r\nwhich made him feel better. Then the Angel sat down before something\r\nSolomon had never seen and—\r\n\r\nThey both stood over him ten minutes afterwards, for he was sitting on a\r\nsofa weeping:\r\n\r\n“’Scuse me—no—no, ’taint my wounded arm—it’s that’r thing over thar\r\nthat’s waked up the cat birds in the roderdendrums at home, an’ I heurd\r\nthe water failin’ over Telulah an’ the wind at midnight in Devil’s Gorge,\r\nan’ I nurver knowed befo’ whut little Dinah Mariah had missed bein’ a\r\ndeef-mute an’—so—it sot me ter bellerin’ this away.”\r\n\r\nThey were very gentle with him after that, and more gracious, and when\r\nthe Angel played another piece full of dash and jig and rosened-bow and\r\nthunder, he stood it until the blood began to boil under his hair and\r\nthey found him again in the middle of the floor shouting:\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, boys! Lord, but can’t he run? Come home, Ajax!” “’Scuse\r\nme—’scuse me—Mrs.—Mrs.—Angul—” after he came to himself—“but—but—she\r\nplays that thing ’zactly like Ajax runs.”\r\n\r\nIt was the greatest day that had ever come into his life, and when he\r\nleft to go back to his beat he proclaimed exultingly to the White-haired\r\none that it was “Christmas, an’ hog-killin’ an’ heav’n all rolled into\r\none.”\r\n\r\nIt was twilight when she came out on the lawn, dressed in white with\r\nribbons in her hair. When he turned she had perched herself on her\r\nfavorite stump and was beckoning him to sit by her. Trembling, weak he\r\nobeyed, his great arm touching hers, which thrilled him so that pains\r\nshot into his wounds. She was silent, looking at him with the same\r\nwistful, doubting eyes of the morning. He had seen them before, in camp,\r\nwhen the boys gambled and their month’s pay was at stake, holding a card\r\naloft uncertain whether to cast or not. And how they held him—those eyes\r\nof hers with the tragedy in them!\r\n\r\n“Solomon, you know how we love you, mamma and I.” He sat mute with bowed\r\nhead. “And Solomon, if I trust you—if I tell you—will you never betray?”\r\n\r\n“Whut—like that’r Judas I onct heurn of the time I went to meetin’?” She\r\nnodded. It hurt him. “I can’t betray—It ain’t in me,” he said simply.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, Solomon. I knew it,” and she put her hand in his just as\r\nDinah Mariah had so often done, except that this made his heart beat so\r\nit bothered his breathing and unlike Dinah Mariah’s he could not—she\r\nbeing an angel—clasp it in turn. “Now, Solomon, my brother is coming\r\nto-night—he will slip in yonder,” and she pointed to a by road leading\r\nthrough shrubbery to a side gate. “You are not to see him, Solomon,\r\nand you are to let him out the same way after we have fed him. For he\r\nis hungry, Solomon, and in great danger—been surrounded and hiding\r\nfor days—they are on his trail. Your men, you know, have killed his\r\nhorse”—(Solomon winced—it hurt him to hear of a horse being killed)—“and,\r\nSolomon, this is the only way he can get out—can save his life—for—for,\r\nSolomon, they are to take him dead or alive.” She had ceased to smile.\r\nTears were in her eyes and Solomon’s great hand closed over her little\r\none.\r\n\r\n“So he’p me God, I’ll nurver pester him!”\r\n\r\n“And when he is ready to go—to try to escape, oh, Solomon, you will stand\r\nby us—with Ajax ready?”\r\n\r\nHe started—he jumped from his seat. “Not Ajax—any critter we got but\r\nAjax.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Solomon, they cannot run—it’s—it’s—Ajax or death for him.”\r\n\r\nShe was weeping, her head on his great shoulder, clinging to his arm,\r\nthe perfume of her hair going into the soul of him like the odor of wild\r\ngrape blossoms after the spring rains in Dingley Dell. “Will you—will\r\nyou, Solomon; oh, save him for me!”\r\n\r\n“So he’p me God, I will—he bein’ yo’ brother—my brother.”\r\n\r\n“You are my brother, Solomon—the Brother of Nobility.”\r\n\r\nSilence. He sat holding her hand as he would Dinah Mariah’s. “Will\r\nyou—er—kiss yo’ brother—when he gits here?”\r\n\r\nShe blushed. “Don’t we always kiss our brothers, Solomon?”\r\n\r\nHe scratched his head thoughtfully. “Awhile ago you made a remark\r\ncal’k’lated ter sorter sot me to ’sposin’ thet mebbe I mou’t also be yo’\r\nbrother—”\r\n\r\nThere was a ripple from Telulah Falls, the pressure of lips on his cheek,\r\na whiff of wild grape blossoms in the Dell, a rustle of skirts up the\r\npath, and Solomon sat breathing hard in silence.\r\n\r\n“Wal, ef lightnin’ ’ud only give us notice when an’ whur it’s goin’ ter\r\nstrike!”\r\n\r\nIn camp he heard news—strange news. The whole army would strike next day,\r\nfor they had Johnston with his flank wide open; would bag him if that\r\nscout didn’t get back through the lines—Captain Coleman, the daring rebel\r\nscout. They had him surrounded now in a thicket by the creek, the man\r\nthey would give a brigade for—he was theirs if the pickets were careful.\r\n\r\nThen it all came over Solomon and with it a blow that brought the great\r\nstrange man to dumbness. “I swore not to betray her—not to be her\r\nJudas—oh, God, enny body but thet white-livered, snivelin’—” He heard\r\nthe flag rustling in the night air. He walked over, crept under the\r\nfolds, pressing it to his hot cheeks, kissing and fondling it. “Judas!\r\nJudas!—oh, my country’s colors.” He looked across the night to the\r\nhills where a thousand camp-fires twinkled in unbroken lines of starry\r\nsentinels.\r\n\r\n“Ye’ve got so menny to defen’ ye,” he said to the flag, “so menny twixt\r\nyou an’ death. An’ she—jes’ me—jes’ me!” He sang low the song that had\r\ntaken the camp.\r\n\r\n    “I’ve seed him in the camp fires of a hunder’d circlin’ camps,\r\n    They have builded him an altar in the evenin’ dews an’ damps—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looks at the living scene before him—it was all so true.\r\nThen lower still:\r\n\r\n    “He has sounded forth the trumpet thet shall nurver know retreat,\r\n    He is siftin’ out the souls o’ men—”\r\n\r\nHe sprang up with a pain in his heart. “Siftin’ out the Judases, an’, oh\r\nGod, I’m a Judas arry way you fix it! Why did you fling me in this heah\r\npit among the wolves o’ war—away from my mount’in home—from little Dinah\r\nMariah?”\r\n\r\nWhen Solomon went back to his beat he had slipped out Ajax, saddled, and\r\nheld him in the clump of orchard trees, near the sweet window where the\r\nfaint light came out, that he knew shone also over her and her brother.\r\nHe held his Deckerd proudly, for was he not all that stood between\r\nher and death? He swelled with the pride of it and that queer sullen\r\nfeeling that came over him at times—that savage feeling he could not\r\nunderstand—that made him willing to kill—kill if—\r\n\r\n“They’d better not pester her,” he growled as he heard the pickets go out\r\nfor their night’s duty.\r\n\r\nHe heard them moving in the room. Her brother was preparing to go. He\r\npeeped and turned away his head. “Somehow it riles me to see her brother\r\nkiss her that away.” He tapped on the blind saying softly: “Ready—ready.”\r\n\r\n“O, Solomon,” joyfully in a whisper, “bless you; bless you!”\r\n\r\n“No Judas in mine, Angul.”\r\n\r\nHe turned, for Ajax had thrust his head over his keeper’s shoulder and\r\nthe man laid his cheek against it and his lips had parted for the pet\r\nwords which he never uttered; for there was a noise in the dark behind\r\nhim and two soldiers tried to rush by to the door of the room.\r\n\r\nSolomon stopped them with his great Deckerd at port. “Halt fus’ an’\r\ngive the countersign,” he said, and he heard the scream of a woman, the\r\nhurrying of feet within.\r\n\r\n“Stand back, you fool, we are men of the Tenth and we’ve got Coleman in\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“Stan’ back yerse’f—he’s her brother—my brother.”\r\n\r\nThere was a rush at him, into arms which made them think of a mountain\r\nbear, for he gathered them to his heart, and the breath of them went out.\r\nIn the glare of the wide open door a girl stood white-faced with tragedy.\r\nA man leaped to the back of a horse and the swaying, struggling group\r\nwere baptized in a shower of flying gravel. Shots and shouts behind and\r\nthe scud of a flying horse into the night.\r\n\r\n“You damned traitor!” Solomon dropped the two men in the paralysis of the\r\nbayonet thrust that sank into his back.\r\n\r\nHe quivered to the death stroke and turned beseechingly to the man:\r\n“Shoot me, quick, brother—in the heart—in the breast—I’m no traitor, no\r\nJudas—she’ll say I ain’t.” The man cocked his rifle but the great head\r\nwith the shock of long hair had gone down and the girl stood between them.\r\n\r\n“No—no—not Judas—she’ll swear I ain’t.”\r\n\r\nShe did not seem to notice them—her beautiful head was turned side-wise\r\nlistening to the vanishing rhythm of flying hoof beats. “O, Solomon,\r\nSolomon; will they catch him?”\r\n\r\n“Whut—an’ him on Ajax? Ho-ho-oh,” and the great chest, schooled to the\r\nmountain halloo, echoed it for the last time, like the sound of thunder\r\namong the hollow gorges of the hills.\r\n\r\nThen joy, great, radiant joy in her face, and with the returning glory of\r\nit all—tenderness—tenderness and sorrow for him. “Can I—O, Solomon—can I\r\ndo anything for you?” She sat by him, her hand on the sweat-damp brow.\r\n\r\n“You mou’t—kiss—me ag’in—an’ ef—you—happen to see—little Dinah Mariah—”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    What doth it mean and whither tendeth,\r\n      This life—this death—this world—the whirling stars?\r\n    Why do we live to-day—to-morrow endeth\r\n      Our half dreampt dream behind the twilight bars?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Phosphates of Tennessee\r\n\r\nBy H. D. RUHM\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ruhm is one of the pioneers in the phosphate field and his\r\n    paper on this subject is the work of an expert.—Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phosphates of Tennessee occur chiefly, in fact, almost entirely, in\r\nthe strata representing the Silurian and Devonian geological ages, or,\r\nmore properly, in the former, and in a transition period between the two.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian age was essentially the age of shell fish, animals with\r\ntheir skeletons entirely on the outside of their bodies. The deposits of\r\ncountless millions of these shell fish and their remains form the immense\r\nbeds of limestone representing the Silurian age. The composition of these\r\nshell fish was carbonate of calcium, or “lime,” and hence our common\r\nlimestones are calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. A._ _Fig. B._]\r\n\r\nThe Devonian age was the age of fishes or vertebrates, and owing to the\r\nneed of greater elasticity of their bones and smaller weight, they are\r\ncomposed of phosphate of calcium, or “lime.” Far back in the Silurian\r\nage the “Hand that fashioned all things well” began to change some of\r\nthese shell fish to provide for the future order of things, so that\r\ntheir outside skeletons, or shells, were composed of phosphate of lime\r\ninstead of carbonate. These two commingling, the resultant beds of rock\r\nbecame somewhat phosphatic and formed the “phosphatic limestones”\r\nof the Silurian age. In some places the phosphate shells were in\r\nconsiderable proportion, and subsequent erosion, proper underground\r\ndrainage and leaching, dissolved out the carbonate of lime to greater or\r\nless extent and left the “brown phosphate” of the middle basin, varying\r\nin grade according to the preponderance of phosphate shells in the\r\noriginal deposit and the extent of the subsequent leaching. Meantime the\r\ntransition stage between the two ages had been reached and the resulting\r\ndeposit spread over the central basin and the highland rim in the form\r\nof a thin blanket of varying thickness and quality of the so-called blue\r\nrock, which is blue, brown, gray and black, according to the coloring\r\nmatter present or absent, composed of a preponderance of microscopic\r\nshell fish with skeleton composed of phosphate of lime, but mixed with\r\nenough carbonate to make the resulting mass vary from sixty-five per cent\r\nto as high as eighty per cent calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent depression and deposit of Devonian shales and\r\nsubcarboniferous beds and subsequent great pressure hardened all these\r\ninto rock, and about the middle of the subcarboniferous age all these\r\nwere elevated above the surrounding country, and while the rest of the\r\nland was taking its turn in being formed under the seas, this old central\r\nbasin was undergoing the wear and tear of erosion that finally produced\r\nthe “Dimple of the Universe,” surrounded by its chain of hills and ridges\r\nand flatwoods of the highland rim.\r\n\r\nIn the central basin where conditions were favorable the intervening\r\nstrata between the blue rock and the phosphatic limestones that were\r\nbeing converted into “brown rock” were sometimes partly and sometimes\r\nentirely washed away, and the blanket of the blue rock, cracked and\r\nbroken into plates of the hardest and most durable parts, settled down\r\non the brown rock, sometimes resting directly on it and sometimes with a\r\nclay seam left to represent the former intervening strata.\r\n\r\nA glance at the illustrations will show the process. Let Figure A\r\nrepresent the deposit as it originally was before the erosion and\r\nleaching started in.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 represents the layer of blue rock in its original position; 2\r\nthe layers of limestone underneath; 3 the layers of highly phosphatic\r\nlimestone in suitable condition for leaching; 4 the hard, insoluble\r\nportions of the limestone, and 5 the soluble portions of the limestone,\r\nnonphosphatic.\r\n\r\nIn Figure B, No. 5 has dissolved out and disappeared. In No. 3, the\r\ncarbonate has leached out and it has separated into laminations and\r\nfalling into the places left by No. 5, has assumed the jumbled condition\r\nfound in the dips between lime boulders; No. 2 has dissolved down to\r\nthe clay seam so generally found, varying in thickness from one or two\r\ninches to two or three feet, and No. 1 has settled down conforming to the\r\ngeneral bottom of 3 or top of 4, forming the top rock generally prevalent\r\nin the brown rock field.\r\n\r\nIf the analysis of the original phosphatic limestone was, say, 50 per\r\ncent phosphate of lime, 38 per cent carbonate and 12 per cent insoluble,\r\nand other matters, and the leaching took out all the soluble carbonate,\r\nthe resulting mass would be 80 per cent phosphate, which is generally\r\nthe analysis of the bottom rock at Mt. Pleasant, or the “export,” as it\r\nis termed. The top rock varies in analysis from 65 to 80, just as the\r\noriginal blue rock did.\r\n\r\nIn the highland rim this process took place only on the slopes of the\r\nnarrow creek valleys and occasionally in projecting points, instead of\r\nover large areas of country as in the central basin.\r\n\r\nIn the portion of the highland rim left intact the blue rock remains\r\nin place as a general thing with its varying quality and thickness,\r\nretaining its original compact form and density.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, however, is found the layer of blue rock resting\r\nimmediately on the layer of phosphatic limestone, and where this is the\r\ncase numerous faults and dips occur, showing a similar structure to the\r\nMt. Pleasant formation typified.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the central basin or brown rock region, the top erosion first\r\ndisintegrated and then partially took off the upper layers of shale or\r\nflint, sometimes entirely, sometimes leaving it from one to forty feet\r\nthick, which accounts for the varying overburden.\r\n\r\nIn some places the limestone layers were entirely soluble or reduced to\r\nclay and some acid condition of soil water dissolved the upper layers\r\nof phosphate and redeposited it in the boulder and stalagmite forms of\r\nthe “white rock” found in Perry and Decatur counties and near Godwin, in\r\nMaury County, and the “boulder rock” found everywhere to greater or less\r\nextent but in especially heavy deposits near Nashville on the McGavock\r\nPlace. These latter redeposit varieties vary in analysis from 50 per cent\r\nto as high as 90 per cent phosphate, and are uncertain as far as the\r\ngeneral variety goes, though individual deposits varying in extent from\r\none to twenty or thirty acres, are found of very uniform quality.\r\n\r\nThe first phosphate rock discovered in Tennessee was the kidney formation\r\nthat almost always attends the blue rock and black shale deposit. The\r\neminent physician, naturalist, botanist and geologist, Dr. Gattinger, of\r\nNashville, of revered and beloved memory, was first to recognize these as\r\nphosphate rock, but being much more interested in determining the family\r\nand pedigree of some new beetle or plant than in the commercial aspect\r\nof any mineral proposition, he never gave his discovery to the world,\r\nand only by his casual mention of the fact one day to Will Shirley and\r\nMaj. W. J. Whitthorne, of Columbia, are we able to give him credit for\r\nthe knowledge. Dr. Safford, in his “Geology of Tennessee,” describes in\r\ndetail both the blue and brown rocks geologically, referring to the blue\r\nrock as a blue fossiliferous limestone nearly always occurring under the\r\nDevonian shale; but no chemical investigations being provided for, he\r\ndid not find out that it was a phosphate rock. Major Whitthorne and Mr.\r\nShirley kept up a systematic hunt for a deposit of commercial value and\r\nfinally the former located one on upper Swan Creek simultaneously with\r\nthe discovery made lower down the same creek by Messrs. Bates and Childs.\r\nThese latter gentlemen were insistent that the black shale, commonly\r\ncalled slate rock, so abundant in the highland rim country, was a form\r\nof, or indicative of the proximity of, coal, and at regularly recurring\r\nintervals they would send in particularly promising looking samples to\r\nProfessor Wharton, of Nashville, for analysis. One day they dropped into\r\ntheir bag of samples a piece of blue rock which they informed Professor\r\nWharton was nearly always present under the “slate,” and seemed to be a\r\n“bloom.” What was their astonishment to receive from Professor Wharton\r\nthe report that their coal was still worthless, but that their bloom was\r\nphosphate rock, analyzing over 70 per cent. This was in December, 1893,\r\nand like the news of William Tell in Switzerland, of old, “From hill to\r\nhill the summons flew,” and the whole country went phosphate and option\r\nmad.\r\n\r\nLack of transportation and timidity of capital, coupled with the\r\nlarge amount of territory occupied by the deposit and the numerous\r\nparties holding properties caused the development to be spasmodic and\r\ncomparatively small and scattered, and in consequence the price soon fell\r\nfrom $4.25 per ton f. o. b. Aetna, which was the first sale, made by the\r\nold Southwestern Phosphate Co., to $2.25 per ton, which was the price at\r\nwhich blue rock guaranteed 65 per cent was sold in 1896, being just a\r\nsmall margin over the cost of production and hauling to the railroad.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1896, at a time when negotiations were on foot for the sale\r\nof a large tract of blue rock land on Swan Creek, Mr. S. Q. Weatherly,\r\nformer county judge, and prior to that county surveyor of Lewis County,\r\nwhile on a trip to Mt. Pleasant, noticed the peculiar brown rock in the\r\nditch at the roadside on the W. S. Jennings’ farm west of Mt. Pleasant,\r\nand being interested in minerals, picked up a piece of it. Noticing the\r\nanalagous appearance to the weathered blue rock, which is generally\r\nbrown on the surface, he dropped it in his buggy. On his return to Swan\r\nCreek, he showed it to Mr. Harry Arnold and Col. D. B. Cooper, who were\r\ninterested in the negotiations above mentioned. These gentlemen had it\r\nanalyzed and finding it to be 75 per cent phosphate rock, induced Mr.\r\nWeatherly to say nothing about it until after their deal was consummated.\r\nAssociated with these gentlemen was also Mr. W. J. Webster, and during\r\nthe time from January to July, 1896, when the negotiations for the\r\nsale of the blue rock properties were finally closed, they ascertained\r\npartially the extent of the Mt. Pleasant brown rock field.\r\n\r\nWhen their “big trade” was made they formed the firm of H. I. Arnold\r\n& Co., bought two and one-half acres of land from Mr. Mumford Smith,\r\nostensibly for a calf lot for Mt. Pleasant’s present genial mayor, Mr. W.\r\nD. Cooper, leased at a royalty of ten cents per ton a few acres from Mr.\r\nCooper and a few from a darky named Tom Smith, got an option from Mrs. M.\r\nG. Frierson on the present Columbian & Blue Grass Hills, and commenced\r\nmining rock and putting it on the cars at a cost of about eighty-five\r\ncents per ton. This rock, without preparation, ran 75 per cent instead of\r\n65 per cent, but whereas the blue rock had never run higher than 3 per\r\ncent I. & A., this rock ran, in the state they shipped it, from 4½ to 6\r\nper cent I. & A.\r\n\r\nOf course the manufacturers had bought blue rock for $2.25, and knew they\r\nwere getting it at very nearly the cost of production, and when they saw\r\nthe “snap” the miner had, they took the stick this excess of I. & A.\r\ngave them and proceeded to beat the price down with it until $1.25 and\r\neventually $1.00 per ton were common prices.\r\n\r\nCapitalists were rendered more timid than ever before, and even astute\r\nphosphate man that he was Col. D. B. Cooper threw up both hands and quit.\r\nHe said, “Boys, if that is phosphate, the whole basin of Middle Tennessee\r\nis full of it, and it will never be worth mining, as every farmer will\r\npick it up off the ground and haul it to the railroad.”\r\n\r\nMr. John S. O’Neal, in a paper presented to the Engineering Association\r\nof the South, as late as 1897, said, “the owner of a bed of phosphate\r\nrock, is not as well off as the owner of a sand bank, given the same\r\nproximity to market.”\r\n\r\nThe poor fellows in the phosphate business, however, couldn’t get out,\r\nand kept digging away, until gradually capital decided it was worth\r\nbuying the lands after all, and as a result nearly $2,000,000 has been\r\npaid for property in the Mt. Pleasant field, about $500,000 in other\r\nportions of Maury County, and over $1,000,000 for property in the\r\ncounties of Decatur, Perry, Lewis, Hickman, Giles, Williamson, Davidson\r\nand Sumner. Rock has gradually advanced in price until now 65 per cent\r\nblue rock sells at from $2.60 to $2.80 per ton, 75 per cent brown rock\r\nat from $3.10 to $3.60 per ton and 78 per cent domestic (4½ I. & A.) at\r\n$3.75 to $4.00, while 78 per cent export rock with 3 to 4 per cent I. &\r\nA. sells for from $4.00 to $4.25 per ton.\r\n\r\nAs the prices have increased the cost of production has increased for one\r\nreason and another, until now each ton of phosphate rock put on board\r\nthe cars represents an average cost in labor and salaries of $2.00 per\r\nton. The production for 1904 having been 540,000 tons, the wage earners\r\nof Tennessee have profited by this industry to the extent of $1,080,000\r\nduring last year alone. On the other hand, fertilizer factories have\r\nsprung up all through the interior of the country like magic, and as\r\nthey now get 75 per cent rock at their factory for less than the freight\r\nthey used to pay on 62 per cent rock from South Carolina, acid phosphate\r\nis cheaper than ever before, and consequently the farmer gets cheaper\r\nfertilizer or else better fertilizer for the same money.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which impresses itself on the mind of almost any visitor\r\nto the phosphate fields is the almost universal dependence on hand labor\r\nof the simplest pick and shovel kind. This is partially due to the fact\r\nthat they “just started that way,” and hence the most “experienced\r\nlaborers” have always done that way; and partially to the fact that after\r\nsufficient capital was at hand for the purpose, the varying conditions\r\nmet with in the deposit made it very difficult to devise appliances\r\nsuitable for one portion of a mine that would answer the requirements in\r\nthe closely adjacent portions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it is possible in the same open face of a mine to find the\r\noverburden varying from two feet to twenty and the rock from a few inches\r\nthick, sticking tight to the top of a lime boulder, to fifteen feet in\r\nthe “dip between two boulders,” while the rock itself will vary from the\r\nshaly, partially disintegrated top rock through various sizes to heavy\r\nblocks six to eight inches thick and often ten or twelve feet long.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be seen how difficult it is to design a machine that\r\nwill accommodate itself to the handling of this material. The removal of\r\nthe overburden has been generally accomplished with wheel scrapers. Two\r\ncompanies have used the New Era or Western machine plow with elevator\r\nbelt loading the dirt into dump bottom wagons alongside. Two steam\r\nshovels are now in use, being of the traction type, and occasionally\r\nthese have been used in digging the rock, though apparently with not\r\nsufficient success to justify its continuance. Cableways have never been\r\nused to transport the material and this is done largely by wagon and\r\nteam, though many tram roads with cars propelled either by mules or dinky\r\nengines are in use.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the rock, however, is dug by the miner with pick and fork,\r\nloaded into wagons, hauled out and dumped in windrows on the ground,\r\nstirred with a potato plow and harrows, allowed to dry in the sun, taken\r\nup again into wagons and hauled either direct to cars for shipping\r\nor put under sheds for storage. When an extra good quality of rock is\r\nwanted, as for export, a few layers of cordwood are put down and the\r\nsun-dried rock put on that. Then, when ready to ship, the wood is fired,\r\nand after the rock is cool, it is broken and loaded with forks, when most\r\nof the dirt sloughs off, leaving the rock almost perfectly clean.\r\n\r\nSome rock can be put from the mines immediately on the wood and burned\r\nfor export, but generally this will only be a safe domestic rock. Some\r\ncompanies who have water accessible, pick out the large pieces and send\r\nthem direct to the dry kilns and then the small pieces with the dirt,\r\nknown as “muck,” are passed through washers, the rock coming out clean,\r\nand being deposited on cordwood and burned as above described.\r\n\r\nThe resulting rock, after being crushed, is passed through screens which\r\nseparate it in three sizes, from one and one-half inch up going for\r\nexport, between that and one-fourth inch for domestic, and the dust and\r\none-fourth inch pieces being ground up and sold for direct use or to\r\nsmall factories.\r\n\r\nThe Century Phosphate Co. has installed a system of dryers and do not\r\nwash the rock, but dry it thoroughly in mechanical dryers and then screen\r\nand separate it as above.\r\n\r\nThe reason the larger pieces are as a rule of higher grade than the\r\nsmaller, is that the dirt and impurity is mostly on the surface of the\r\nrock and the greater the proportion of surface to volume the lower the\r\ngrade in B. P. L. and the higher in iron and alumina.\r\n\r\nOwners and operators of mines are gradually turning their attention\r\nto labor-saving devices for primary operations, and for systems of\r\nreclaiming the immense amount of waste that has heretofore gone on, both\r\nin the mining and the preparation of the rock.\r\n\r\nOne marked step forward in the business is the establishment of a\r\nsmall mixing plant for making complete fertilizers, and the commencing\r\nof operations on a large acid phosphate factory, with prospects for\r\nadditional ones later on.\r\n\r\nAt least ten per cent of the present output is thrown away to prepare\r\nthe high grade rock necessary, and this waste will make good 13 per cent\r\nacid phosphate, so that every year 50,000 tons of valuable material is\r\nabsolutely thrown away. This is more phosphate rock than is annually\r\nused by any one fertilizer factory in the world, so far as known to the\r\nwriter. This waste product could easily be transported to a local factory\r\nfor an average cost of less than 50 cents per ton. Sulphuric acid can be\r\nbought laid down at Mt. Pleasant for $7 per ton. The mixing and other\r\npreparation will not exceed $2 per ton, so that using half acid and half\r\nrock the cost of the acid phosphate will not be more than $4.75 per ton,\r\nwhile it will probably sell for at least $8 per ton. From these figures\r\nwe appear to be throwing into the waste pile at present material that\r\nshould represent a profit of not less than $162,500 per annum. That\r\nthis will be allowed to continue does not appear likely. The question\r\nmight arise, however, “What will you do with the acid phosphate thus\r\nmanufactured to keep from overcrowding or at least injuring the market?”\r\nI should answer this by calling attention to the immense area of land\r\nin Maury, Lawrence, Lewis and Hickman counties, known as “The Barrens,”\r\nwhich are gradually being denuded of their timber for cordwood that is\r\nshipped to Mt. Pleasant for use in drying the phosphate rock. There are\r\nat least 250,000 acres of this land, which is now readily purchasable\r\nat $3 per acre, with the cord wood on it. The wood alone will yield in\r\nvalue more than this price, thus leaving the land clear. Now, it has been\r\ndemonstrated at Lawrenceburg, Summertown, Loretto, St. Joseph, Hohenwald\r\nand numerous other places that systematic and intelligent farming, even\r\nwith the meager supply of fertilizer (almost entirely in the shape of\r\nbone meal) that has been used, will bring these lands up to a point\r\nwhere they will bring from fifteen to twenty bushels of wheat or from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty bushels of corn per acre. Such lands that have been\r\nso brought up readily sell for from $10 to $40 per acre, according to\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments it has been ascertained that the principal element of\r\nplant food lacking in these soils is phosphoric acid. The application\r\nof 275 pounds of acid phosphate per acre each year on these lands would\r\nconsume right at our doors the entire output of the proposed acid\r\nfactory, even if none were sold elsewhere. This appears chimerical to\r\nthe casual observer, I must confess, but a careful investigation will\r\ndemonstrate the soundness of the position taken.\r\n\r\nA feature throwing some light on the development of the business at Mt.\r\nPleasant is shown by the following table:\r\n\r\nThe lengths of track built in each year are as follows:\r\n\r\n                  L. & N.

There will be no new discoveries. Of course there\r\nwill be much new development, but the location of such development will\r\nhave been discovered long before.\r\n\r\nThe principal localities in the State where operations are now in\r\nprogress, are: Mt. Pleasant, Kleburn, Jameson and Century, in Maury\r\nCounty; Lower Swan Creek, Twomey and Totty’s Bend, in Hickman County;\r\nnear Gallatin, in Sumner County; Wales Station, in Giles County, and near\r\nNashville, in Davidson County.\r\n\r\nThe principal localities where developments will gradually take place\r\nas the demands of the business require are: Southport, Estes Bend, Bear\r\nCreek, Neeley’s Valley, Little Bigby, West Fork, *Baptist Branch and\r\n*Leiper’s Creek, in Maury County; Richland Creek, in Giles County;\r\nStation Camp Creek, in Sumner County; north and west of Franklin, in\r\nWilliamson County; Brentwood and Bellevue, in Davidson County; Beech\r\nRiver, in Decatur County; Tom’s Creek, Buffalo River, *Hurricane Creek\r\nand Cane Creek, in Perry County; *Forty-eight Mile Creek, in Wayne\r\nCounty; *Upper Swan and *Indian Creek, in Lewis County; *Lower Swan,\r\n*Indian Creek, Ship’s Bend, Gray’s Bend, Persimmon, Haleys and\r\n*Leatherwood creeks, in Hickman County.\r\n\r\n    * Blue rock.\r\n\r\nAnything exploited outside of these known and designated deposits is\r\nvery apt to prove either a flash in the pan or will be found to be only\r\nworked by the newspaper correspondents at so much per column.\r\n\r\nOf the present working localities the principal one is Mt. Pleasant, and\r\nwhile the property owners there are beginning to figure a little on how\r\nmuch they have left, still the prevailing impression that Mt. Pleasant\r\nis about through mining is an exceedingly mistaken one. With the present\r\nrate of output, the visible supply of the Mt. Pleasant field proper\r\nwill last for seven years longer, without taking into consideration the\r\nSouthport field, which is practically part of the Mt. Pleasant field.\r\nWith the Southport field mining will last here at the present rate of\r\noutput for eleven years. It is very easy to understand that as work\r\nprogresses at Mt. Pleasant and the end comes more nearly in sight, some\r\nminers drop out by selling, some by working out their small deposits and\r\nthese naturally go to the other fields above referred to. In none of the\r\nother fields is found the persistently uniform high grade brown rock of\r\nMt. Pleasant except Southport, Century and Kleburn, in the two latter of\r\nwhich operations are now in progress, and in the former the extension of\r\nthe Mt. Pleasant Southern Railway will soon cause development work there.\r\n\r\nAs these deposits afford practically the same grade of rock as Mt.\r\nPleasant proper, they will be worked out simultaneously with it and will\r\ncater to the same market.\r\n\r\nWith their knowledge that the visible supply of this character of rock is\r\ncomparatively limited, producers are gradually increasing their prices,\r\nand by reason of such increase they are slowly reducing their output and\r\ngiving opportunity for the marketing of the lower grades in the other\r\nfields, notably the Swan Creek and Indian Creek deposits in Hickman\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, means that the producers at Mt. Pleasant will make more\r\nmoney from their product, and that it will last a considerably longer\r\ntime, so that it is safe to say that mining in force will be carried on\r\nat Mt. Pleasant and kindred localities for at least twenty years.\r\n\r\nDuring the next decade, to supply the diminution of Mt. Pleasant’s\r\noutput, will come the gradual development of the vast blue rock field\r\nof Maury, Hickman and Lewis counties, and the white rock of Perry and\r\nDecatur counties, which form the backbone of the phosphate industry in\r\nTennessee, and whose millions of tons will cause these counties to be\r\nconsidered the phosphate reservoir of the world for the next seventy-five\r\nor one hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe change of base will be gradual and easy, and the trade will have\r\nample opportunity and time to adjust its operations so as to utilize the\r\nlower grade blue rock as it becomes advisable and necessary to do so. Its\r\nmany points of superiority for acidulation and for direct use without\r\nacidulation will largely make up for its lower grade, and as a mining\r\nproposition it more nearly approaches a technical field of operation.\r\n\r\nThe blue rock field proper covers a territory bounded approximately by\r\na trapezoid having as its four corners Centreville, in Hickman County;\r\nKinderhook and Mt. Joy, in Maury County, and Lewis Monument, in Lewis\r\nCounty. Traversing this territory are Duck River, Indian, Swan, Blue Buck\r\nand Cathey’s creeks, and their tributaries, and outcropping along these\r\nvalleys and underlying the ridges between them are deposits of blue rock\r\nrunning in bone phosphate from 60 per cent to 78 per cent, with less than\r\n3 per cent iron and alumina, that will aggregate in the neighborhood of\r\n40,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThis field will soon be developed by the extension of the Nashville,\r\nChattanooga & St. Louis branch up Swan Creek and the Louisville &\r\nNashville branch down Swan Creek, with side lines and spurs leading off\r\neach, surveys for which have been made, and work on construction will\r\nsoon be under way.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Florence Northern Railroad should ever be built from\r\nFlorence to Nashville it will run through the heart of this territory as\r\nwell as the magnificent iron deposits of Wayne and Lewis.\r\n\r\nWith the above road and a road from Huntsville on the southeast to Milan\r\non the northwest all of the phosphate territory would be fully developed,\r\nand this section of Maury, Hickman, Lewis, Perry, Giles, Davidson and\r\nWilliamson counties would be the site of more fertilizer factories than\r\nwill be found elsewhere in the world in the same space.\r\n\r\nContributary to such prospective development is the present opening up of\r\npyrites deposits at Pyriton, near Talladega, Ala., with ore running two\r\nto four units higher than the Virginia ores, and while from four to six\r\nunits lower than the best Spanish ores, it is much more free burning than\r\nthe latter, and with its advantage in freight rates, will likely give\r\nmanufacturers equally as good a product at a lower price.\r\n\r\nThe vein of pyrites is about one and one-half miles long and from four\r\nto fifteen feet thick and has been exploited to a depth of 430 feet, the\r\nore improving in quality with the depth. It is reported by manufacturers\r\nwho have used it to be the freest burning pyrites ore known, leaving\r\nonly about ½ of 1 per cent of the sulphur in the cinder and containing\r\nno deleterious ingredients. The deposits are controlled by the Alabama\r\nPyrites Company and the Southern Sulphur Ore Company, the latter owned by\r\nMessrs. Carpenter & Howard, of Columbia, their vein running from eight to\r\nfifteen feet thick. The railroad into this deposit has been built from\r\nthe Louisville & Nashville, at Talladega, a distance of twenty miles, at\r\na cost of nearly $400,000.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of fertilizers has increased 200 per cent in the United\r\nStates in the past twelve years, and while the visible supply of\r\nphosphate rock is rapidly decreasing, the consumption of fertilizers\r\nis almost as rapidly increasing, and with this fact in view, the large\r\nfertilizer companies are and have been for several years gradually\r\nbuying up phosphate lands to provide themselves for the future. This\r\ntendency has put a large amount of phosphate property in such strong\r\nhands that little or no danger is possible of the old scramble to sell,\r\nwith its attendant low prices. At the same time, a considerable amount\r\nof land valuable for its phosphate deposits is still uncontrolled by\r\nmanufacturers, so that a healthy competition in the business is still\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThe amount of fertilizer used in Middle Tennessee is almost a minus\r\nquantity, but this state of things cannot long exist. The horse worked\r\ncontinuously without feeding soon dies, and so it will be, nay already\r\nis, with much of our land in the “dimple of the universe.”\r\n\r\nFarmers know that the crops of ten years ago cannot be raised to-day\r\nand are all waking up to the fact that something is needed. The large\r\nstock-raiser, who husbands his stable manure, can partially take care of\r\nthe thin spots on his land. But the small farmer, the backbone of the\r\ncountry, whose acres do not afford him land sufficient to till and still\r\nhave the rich pastures necessary to raise much stock, contents himself\r\nwith simply wearing out his farm, selling it at a low price, generally\r\nwith the mediation of the sheriff, and moving elsewhere for better or\r\nmore probably for worse. To this class the use of fertilizer in Tennessee\r\nis practically unknown, but their successors of the next few decades\r\nwill form, as is the case in other States, the bulk of the fertilizer\r\nconsumers, and when this comes to pass Tennessee will indeed have come\r\ninto her own.\r\n\r\nThe use of fertilizer in the cotton States has enabled the planters to\r\ncontinue year after year to raise the enormous crops of cotton and has\r\nalso enabled them to diversify their crops by being able to produce the\r\nsame yield of cotton on a less number of acres.\r\n\r\nSo fertilizers will enable the Middle Tennessee farmers to raise the\r\nsame amount of feed on fewer acres, leaving more land to grow up to blue\r\ngrass, and our present greatly depreciated live stock interests will come\r\nup by leaps and bounds until we will rival the famous blue grass section\r\nof Kentucky, if we do not far outstrip it.\r\n\r\nWhen one stops to consider (1) that the wheat crop alone annually\r\nremoves from the soil of the United States more phosphoric acid than\r\nis the equivalent of twice the amount of phosphate rock produced in\r\nthe country; and (2) that over half of the amount mined is exported so\r\nthat the fertilizers used in the United States return to the soil only\r\none-fourth of the phosphoric acid that is taken away by the wheat crop\r\nalone, without considering the other crops, we can readily see that the\r\nconsumption of fertilizer and phosphate rock not only will, but of right\r\nought to, enormously increase, and that the industry is a permanent\r\none that will last without cessation or danger of serious interruption\r\nas long as the world eats bread. That it has been and still is being\r\ndeveloped almost entirely by outside capital is one of the features that\r\nseems to attend the development of practically all the industries of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nA complete analysis of a dry sample of average “brown rock,” which the\r\nwriter had made several years ago, may be of interest, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Moisture                                .87\r\n    Combined water and organic matter      1.53\r\n    Sand and insoluble matter              2.76\r\n    Peroxide of iron                       2.40\r\n    Alumina                                1.99\r\n    Lime                                  49.07\r\n    Magnesia                                .24\r\n    Carbonic acid                          1.08\r\n    Equals carbonate of lime, 2.41.\r\n    Fluorine                               2.98\r\n    Sulphuric acid                         1.03\r\n    Phosphoric acid                       35.62\r\n    Equals bone phosphate of lime, 77.78.\r\n                                          -----\r\n        Total                             99.57\r\n\r\nThe rock which is exported from Tennessee goes to England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, Belgium, Holland, France, Spain, Italy, Austria and Japan. The\r\ndomestic rock is consumed by the various fertilizer factories all over\r\nthat part of the United States east of the Mississippi River, some of the\r\nprincipal points being Philadelphia, Pa.; Buffalo, N. Y.; Cleveland and\r\nColumbus, Ohio; Chicago, Ill.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Lynchburg, Staunton,\r\nNorfolk and Richmond, Va.; Memphis, Nashville and Chattanooga, Tenn.;\r\nGreenville, Columbia and Charleston, S. C.; Charlotte and Winston, N.\r\nC.; Macon and Atlanta, Ga.; Meridian, Miss.; Birmingham, Montgomery and\r\nMobile, Ala.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a word might be appropriate on the subject of the direct\r\nuse of raw ground phosphate rock as a fertilizer, without acidulation.\r\n\r\nThe experiment stations of the great States of Illinois, Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey have made exhaustive experiments\r\nwith this material, and their bulletins may be had by any farmer desiring\r\nthem, showing that this material has given results that prove it to be\r\nmore valuable for many soils than the acidulated phosphate. The great\r\nState of Tennessee, on the other hand, without any practical experiments\r\nto back it up, in the face of the opinions of some of its most eminent\r\nchemists and experts, continues on its statute book an absolute\r\nprohibition against the sale of this material within its borders.\r\n\r\nMr. Cyril Hopkins, of the Illinois Experiment Station, says that the\r\ndiscovery of the Tennessee phosphate deposits is the greatest thing that\r\never happened for the farmers of Illinois.\r\n\r\nEach year many carloads of this material are shipped into other States\r\nand wherever it has been used its use is spreading, yet these people have\r\nto pay more in freight alone than it would cost the average Tennessee\r\nfarmer at his farm.\r\n\r\nImmense deposits of this rock exist in Tennessee high enough in grade\r\nto meet the requirements for direct use, and if this prohibition were\r\nremoved, almost every county seat in the sixth and seventh congressional\r\ndistricts would have phosphate mills to supply the local trade, just as\r\nthey have flour mills.\r\n\r\nThe next Legislature should certainly correct the errors of the past by\r\nallowing the Tennessee farmer to exercise the same amount of free agency,\r\ncommon sense judgment as his fellows of the other States.\r\n\r\nThe principal mines in Tennessee are shown in the table on the following\r\npage:\r\n\r\n    --------+---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n            |                          Operators.                     |\r\n    County. +---------------------------------------+-----------------+\r\n            |                                       |                 |\r\n            |          Name                         |   Post Office   |\r\n    --------+---------------------------------------+-----------------+\r\n    Davidson|Charleston, S.

The old “side-wheeler” has gone—the new, beautifully\r\ngaited, true striding pacing race horse has taken his place. No other\r\nfeature of a race meeting brings out the crowd and the enthusiasm equal\r\nto the free-for-all pace. Never before had such races been witnessed\r\nas those first seen in the days of the Big Four—the queen of which was\r\nMattie Hunter 2:12½, the first great Hal mare to attract the attention\r\nof the world. She was the star of the Big Four, the others being Blind\r\nTom, Lucy and Rowdy Boy. Later, some of the great free-for-allers were\r\nLittle Brown Jug, Brown Hal, Hal Pointer, Robert J, Direct, Joe Patchen,\r\nJohn R Gentry and many others whose names will be readily remembered by\r\nevery horseman. The very mention of these names brings a thrill to the\r\nheart as, toward the last of the century, Robert J, John R. Gentry and\r\nJoe Patchen and Star Pointer began to bring the pacing record to the\r\ntwo-minute mark. This was first done by Star Pointer, an inbred Hal,\r\ncrossed again and again in the thoroughbred blood which, undoubtedly,\r\ngave to the Hals the staying power so characteristic of the family. And\r\nso, looking back, the following article, written by Trotwood December 29,\r\n1892, seems prophetic—that is, if there were such a thing as prophecy.\r\nBut, alas, there is not, for prophecy is merely another name for the\r\ncause of the future as foreseen in the present’s effect. And though this\r\nwas written thirteen years ago, it is embodied into this history, as\r\nfitting so well the present:\r\n\r\n“There can no longer be any doubt that the pacer, as a future product on\r\nthe light harness race course, will be a still stronger factor than he\r\nis to-day. Even if desired, it is now not possible to eliminate him from\r\nthe light harness breeding world. He has come to stay. It matters not\r\nto us whether the honest, but sturdy, rascal can trace his ancestors to\r\nMarsh’s five-toed orohippos, weighing about forty pounds, and which had\r\nall he could do to keep out of the way of Darwin’s “missing link,” and\r\nthus save himself from drudgery, even before the days of the Silurian\r\nserpents, or whether he was developed in Trojan wars as carved on the\r\nfrieze of Grecian temples; the fact remains the same, that to-day he is\r\nhere by a large majority, and though snubbed by his more aristocratic\r\nbrother, he persistently refuses to stay behind in the procession, and\r\nis never happier than when he can get up a good, rattling fight in a\r\nfive-heat race, or stick his common, but inquisitive, nose a few seconds\r\nbeyond the trotting record securely placarded on the front of old Father\r\nTime. Flung into the world without prestige, friends or influence; his\r\ncoming regarded as the epitome of a breeder’s ill luck; condemned before\r\nhe was born, and damned before he could walk; a little too good to kill,\r\nyet hardly good enough to be allowed a square meal once a week that he\r\nmight grow up like any other horse; toe-weighted and hobbled and banged\r\nabout, and forced to trot in spite of the laws of nature herself, yet the\r\ngame and honest little fellow, when relieved of his owner’s prejudices\r\nand hobbles, has flown to the front with the ease of a swallow through\r\nthe air and the grace of a game fish in the lake, and now holds the first\r\nrecord for speed and the chief place on the program in the eye of a grand\r\nstand that paid its way to see an honest horse race.\r\n\r\n“It is the old story of the rejected stone, and he now holds up with\r\nsurprising popularity his corner of the race horse structure. And yet\r\ntwenty years ago a pacer was scarcely allowed on a fashionable race\r\ncourse; his pedigree, they said, took to the woods on the first cross;\r\nhe was regarded by the trotting world as a camel-backed, cat-hammed,\r\nnarrow-chested, curby-legged beast who paced because he couldn’t trot,\r\nand was alive because nobody cared to buy powder enough to kill all of\r\nthem in the woods of Tennessee and Kentucky. He was allowed to exist on\r\nthe race course very much on the same idea that a slave is allowed to\r\nbreathe the same air and view the same heaven his master does. He began\r\nhis career because he was a good kind of an animal to have around to do\r\nthe race act at the pumpkin show and come in along with the fat woman and\r\nthe five-legged calf. His coming to the front was his own work; and to\r\nuse a classical phrase, he was purely the architect of his own fortune.\r\nThe American people are a long time finding out merit, but nothing helps\r\nthem to see it as quickly as the image of the American eagle stamped on\r\nthe back of a silver dollar—and this the pacer has shown them.\r\n\r\n“Despite the oft-repeated theory of ‘the Canadian pacer,’ there is no\r\ndoubt that the pacer as now found in Kentucky, Tennessee and the West\r\ncame originally from the older Atlantic States, such as Virginia and\r\nthe Carolinas, and that he was brought there by our forefathers from\r\nEngland. The fact that there are pacers in Canada merely proves that in\r\nthat Dominion also they have been brought from the mother country. To\r\ntrace their origin in England is both a tedious task and a most uncertain\r\none. Yet, from the best information obtainable, there appears to be but\r\nlittle doubt that the pacer was originally a product of Spain, where\r\nmany years ago he was bred in the purple as a pleasure animal for the\r\nnobility of Andalusia and other Spanish states. In fact, it is more\r\nthan probable that he was bred with more care than was bestowed by the\r\nSpanish upon their now favorite animal—the ass. We know that the pacer\r\nwas safely domiciled in England as far back as the Norman Conquest, for\r\nin ‘Ivanhoe,’ written by that most painstaking scholar and novelist, Sir\r\nWalter Scott—a man who wrote truer to nature and with as much historic\r\naccuracy as any novelist who has ever lived in England—we find many\r\nallusions to the pacer under the style of the palfrey and the ambler.\r\n\r\n“The following is an extract from Ivanhoe, Chapter II., the scene being\r\nin the time of Richard I. In reading it we must remember that the name\r\njennet did not mean then as now the female of an ass, but it meant the\r\npalfrey which the lay brother was riding. Says Sir Walter: ‘This worthy\r\nchurchman rode upon a well-fed, ambling mule, whose furniture was highly\r\ndecorated and whose bridle, according to the fashion of the day, was\r\nornamented with silver bells.... A lay brother, one of those who followed\r\nin the train, had for his use on other occasions one of the most handsome\r\nSpanish jennets ever bred in Andalusia, which merchants used at that time\r\nto import, with great trouble and risk, for the use of persons of wealth\r\nand distinction. The saddle and housings of this superb palfrey were\r\ncovered by a long boat cloth which reached nearly to the ground, and on\r\nwhich were richly embroidered mitres, crosses and other ecclesiastical\r\nemblems.’\r\n\r\n“From other writings of Sir Walter Scott we find that the knight usually,\r\nwhen not in battle, rode upon an ambler, and a page, riding also upon the\r\nsame kind of a horse, led the knight’s large war horse, with his armorial\r\ntrappings. The fact that in the above extract the mule also paced, goes\r\nto show how strong must have been the pacing instinct in his dam, being\r\nable to overcome entirely the gait of the ass. But to go further into\r\nthe history of the pacer in England would be foreign to the ends of this\r\nbrief article.\r\n\r\n“We will only add that in spite of the fact that many English breeders\r\nassert that not a pacer has been kept in that country for many years,\r\nyet we believe that this is not true and that there are many of them\r\nthere to-day. But to return to our own pacer. It is quite easy to trace\r\nhis career as he came from the mother colonies, spreading out through\r\nKentucky, Tennessee and the States of the Northwest, under the name of\r\nthe ‘saddle horse,’ by which name he was held in the highest esteem and\r\nfilled an humble but most important position in the pioneer work of State\r\nmaking. Before the roads were cut out through the forests, and when only\r\nblazed Indian paths were the highways of the country, he was an absolute\r\nnecessity, and to-day there belongs to him the proud honor of having been\r\nthe first common carrier of American civilization. He was with Marion\r\nand Sumter in their partisan warfare in the Carolinas; he saw, no doubt,\r\nwith patriotic emotion, the ignoble surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown;\r\nhe followed the intrepid Boone across the Alleghanies into Kentucky,\r\nand came along with the immortal Jackson—the man of destiny—into the\r\n‘basin of middle Tennessee.’ Pulling the plow for an honest living\r\nin the rich cornfields during the week, he carried the women and the\r\nchildren on his back to the primitive church on Sunday. As civilization\r\nadvanced he improved with it, being crossed with thoroughbred blood\r\nin rich profusion, until to-day his lines of breeding are thoroughly\r\nestablished, and by his speed, gameness and bottom he has advanced from\r\nthe humble position of the family man-of-all-work to the fleet-footed\r\nking of the light-harness world—from the simple cabin in the clearing,\r\nand the gentle caress of the backwoodman’s family, to the applause of the\r\ngrand stand.\r\n\r\n“A scrub, indeed! He was here fighting for independence and an honest\r\nliving when the forefathers of the Wilkes and Almonts—since old imp.\r\nMessenger is regarded as the fountain head—were courting the favor\r\nof royalty in England ‘that thrift may follow fawning,’ or carrying\r\nsoup-drinking Britons on their jolting backs to the wharves of Liverpool,\r\nto be shipped over here as food for Tennessee rifles at New Orleans.\r\nPlebian, did you say? Why, he ought to be pensioned. He is older and more\r\nrespectable than the Dutch governors of New York and has a greater claim\r\nto patriotism than half of the pensioners who never smelled the smoke of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n“In Tennessee and Kentucky he has always been a great favorite, and since\r\nthe race-track act has been added to his many other accomplishments he is\r\ndestined to be yet more popular. But the student who attempts to trace\r\nhis development is lost in a maze of thoroughbred blood and ‘native\r\nstock.’ That the ‘pacing-bred pacer’ of to-day is simply a mixture of\r\nthe old ambling pacer of Europe, whatever he was, and thoroughbred there\r\nis no doubt in the world. And that this thorough blood has been as good,\r\nif not better, than that in old Messenger himself, is also true. But the\r\nastonishing thing about this amalgamation is the very small per cent of\r\npacing blood it required to leaven the thoroughbred loaf. A pacing sire\r\nbred to a running mare and that offspring to another running mare, and so\r\non for several generations, will end with the last, as with the first, in\r\ngetting a ‘saddler.’\r\n\r\n“We have always regarded this fact as the strongest evidence of the\r\nintensity of the pacing instinct—an instinct that has such a pure and\r\nstrong fountain-head somewhere that it is able to overcome the running\r\ninstinct, though crossed and recrossed upon the pure running blood, is\r\nabundant evidence of its own purity and prepotency. And the fact that\r\nso many fast pacers are continually thrown from the trotting ranks, now\r\ncommonly called ‘trotting-bred pacers,’ is but another illustration\r\nof the same fact. Verily, back somewhere in the past the pacer was a\r\nthoroughbred at his way of going. His remote ancestor, whether in the\r\nmyths of fables, or in the woods of northern Germany, or the vine-clad\r\nhills of Spain, or around the frozen lakes of Canada, was an Alexander, a\r\nJulius Caesar and a Napoleon Bonaparte, all in one, in the greatness and\r\ngameness of his gait. How else could the fact that every great family of\r\ntrotters is continually throwing pacers be explained by any other theory?\r\nThe fact that the trotting breeders have been careless in breeding to\r\nmares of strong pacing instinct or breeding, we admit; but the fact\r\nremains the same that the pacing blood in the pedigree of such trotters\r\ndoes not appear to have acted as a brake in their way of going, but, on\r\nthe contrary, has given to them a smoothness of action and an elasticity\r\nof stride which has carried them to the foremost rank at their gait; and\r\nwe are also led to believe that it often requires but a small portion of\r\npacing fluid to overcome several generations of the diagonal gait in the\r\nveins of the trotting-bred horse.\r\n\r\n“Take from the trotting ranks those out of mares or descendants of mares\r\nby old Pilot, Jr., and other pacers, and the truth of this assertion\r\nwill be most plainly seen. In fact, every noted family of trotters, such\r\nas the Wilkses and the Almonts—wherever there is any pacing blood, even\r\naway back in the fourth and fifth generation—have to the credit of that\r\nfamily some pacer who is faster at his way of going than the star trotter\r\nof that family is at his. No Hambletonian trotter has ever attained the\r\nspeed that has been shown by Direct, unless it be Nancy Hanks, who has\r\nsome pacing blood in her own royal veins and is inclined to pace a bit\r\nherself; nor has any Almont trotter ever equalled Flying Jib and hosts\r\nof others we might mention. Among the Wilkses they are thicker than the\r\nleaves of Valambrosa, until one is forced to believe that the Clay\r\nblood, if such it was, in the pedigree of George Wilkes was about as good\r\nas any the great horse had in his veins.\r\n\r\n“These facts being true, it is evident that the pacer is not a scrub.\r\nIf he is a scrub, then we are forced to the conclusion that nothing\r\nin all the breeding world may be likened to the intensity of his\r\ncold-bloodedness. This scrub blood overcomes the hot running blood,\r\nthough continually diluted for successive generations; and it needs only\r\na little of it to knock out the hopes of the bluest blooded trotter\r\ndescended from Hambletonian lines. If he is a scrub, then he is the\r\nveritable ‘original sire’ of the scrub horse business, which, like that\r\nin man, is ever on top. But as this sin of the pacer helps him to the\r\nwire first, and has given him the harness records of the world, we trust\r\nno trotting moralist will attempt to entirely obliterate it. We don’t\r\nneed any crucifixions there! To our mind, we believe that if the curtain\r\nof the past could ever be unrolled upon the pacers of old we would find\r\nthat centuries ago he was bred for no other way of going, and bred so\r\nlong and so purely and so consistently that in him has been planted an\r\ninstinct that will never be obliterated. To argue that a cold-blooded\r\nhorse can be thus preponent is to argue against the well-known laws of\r\nheredity!\r\n\r\n“In the second place, the pacer has undoubtedly come to stay. The\r\nAmerican people are nothing if not quick in realizing real merit and\r\nhonoring it when clearly proven. As they make no pretensions to the shams\r\nof royalty, so are they not bound by the iron rules of court custom from\r\n‘hustling’ to horse-racing. They do not care for so much trappy action;\r\nnor does the matter of a banged tail cut as much of a figure in their\r\ncalculations as does the intense patriotism which lies within them for\r\ntheir own almighty dollar. Passing over the generally admitted fact that\r\nthe pacer is naturally faster than the trotter, comes to his speed more\r\nquickly, may be more evenly matched in a race, and is preserved longer by\r\nreason of the smoothness of his gait, there is yet another cause why the\r\npacer is destined to become more popular.\r\n\r\n“A great English commoner, whose ire had been aroused on one occasion by\r\na member of the House of Lords, in reply, in a speech of burning oratory,\r\nspoke of the aforesaid gentleman as being in his titled position merely\r\nby reason of the fact that he was ‘the accident of an accident.’ There is\r\nno doubt that Hambletonian 10, the present head of the trotting family,\r\nwas even more of an accident than the English lord was. Bellfounder\r\nmares of trotting propensities were rarer than imported Messengers, and\r\nif the mating of Abdallah with this mare was not an accident, but the\r\nplan of a thoughtful intellect looking to the future, the descendants of\r\nthe man who thought it out should have risen up and told it last month,\r\nthat their forefathers might have been honored along with Columbus at\r\nthe opening of the World’s Fair. Now the ‘trotting-bred pacer’ is quite\r\nan accident himself. He is here by reason of the fact that many trotting\r\nbreeders in their wild vagaries and theories regarding the best way to\r\nbreed a trotter, ranging all the way, in the theory of breeding, from\r\nthoroughblood to jackass, have accidentally honored a few thousand\r\npacing mares with a service to some of their Hambletonians. As a result\r\nthe ‘trotting-bred’ pacer is with us. As it is quite impossible for the\r\ntrotting turf to get rid of this rascal if they wished to, and as he has\r\nmanaged to be quite a game and fast money-making machine himself, he has\r\nclinched the popularity of the pacer as a pacer and has stuck a peg in\r\nthe map of popular favor that would be hard to be removed.\r\n\r\n“And it is safe to say that by reason of the blood of Pilot, Jr., Clay,\r\nBlue Bull, Tom Hal, Pocahontas and many others being so generally\r\ndistributed in the pedigrees of trotters, the ‘trotting-bred pacer’ will\r\ncontinue to come from such trotting sources in the future in geometrical\r\nproportion and to pace in the same ratio. What will be done with them?\r\nEach one, with speed, is simply a money-making machine, and his owner\r\nwill not be long in putting him at the work which nature cut out for\r\nhim. To destroy him merely because he paces belongs to the dark ages when\r\nthe pacing gait was one which made no money, but now, since the pacing\r\npurses have gotten to be so liberal and getting more so each year, it\r\nis only common sense to suppose that owners of pacing horses will begin\r\nto take more pains in their development and their breeding. This will\r\nimprove their speed. As it is now, we do not suppose there is a betting\r\nhorseman alive who would not give large odds that the pacer will be the\r\nfirst two-minute horse.\r\n\r\n“And in this connection another thing must be taken into consideration.\r\nThe pacer’s gait has itself been greatly improved in the last ten\r\nyears. He is no longer the rotary-motioned mud-flinger of old, whose\r\nforefeet pawed the air in circles parallel with and above his ears, while\r\nhis hind feet described semicircles over the ground, but he is now a\r\nsmooth-gaited, straightforward, quick-actioned fellow, with plenty of\r\nknee action in front and the stride of a bullfrog behind, and at his\r\nhighest speed it requires more than a glance for one to say whether\r\nhe is trotting or pacing. In other words, the pacer has come to be a\r\nwell-rounded, symmetrical and well-bred horse. His gait is the poetry of\r\nharness motion, his courage is unquestioned and his staying qualities,\r\nespecially with the pacing-bred ones, of whom we are more familiar, are\r\nequal to those of any horse that ever stretched his neck in the home\r\nstretch. In view of these facts it doesn’t require even the grandson of a\r\nprophet to predict he is destined to a still greater career on the light\r\nharness race course.\r\n\r\n“We can only judge the future by the past and the present, and with that\r\nin view from a study of the 2:20 list, which a most exclusive list in the\r\nlight harness race course, we are startled with the enviable position the\r\ndespised side-wheeler holds in that charmed circle this season. There can\r\nbe no sham in the 2:20 list. A horse must be able to trot or pace that\r\nenters it. Up to November 15 there were, according to the statistics at\r\nmy command, 189 new 2:20 performers; and by new performers we mean horses\r\nthat had no record as good as 2:30 trotting or 2:25 pacing before the\r\nopening of this season. Of these 189 new 2:20 performers we find that\r\nthe pacers constitute 128 of the number, while the trotters are credited\r\nwith sixty-one. This table includes but seven pacers that have lowered\r\ntheir records from the 2:30 list last year to the 2:20 list this year,\r\nand we use it to get at the number of green horses to enter this list,\r\nand _from_ it we are able _to form_ a more correct idea of the material\r\ncoming fresh from both ranks. It cuts off such stars as Kremlin, Stamboul\r\nand Nancy Hanks among trotters, as well as Hal Pointer, Mascot, Guy,\r\nDirect and Storm among pacers.\r\n\r\n“But a still more exclusive list is the 2:15 class, and in order to\r\nshow your readers what has been accomplished by the new material from\r\nthe pacing ranks this year as compared with the same material from the\r\ntrotters, we publish that list in full, and in a spirit of generosity we\r\nplace the despised pacer on the left in the goat’s place. The fact that\r\nit looks something like the last electoral college, with Cleveland on the\r\npacer’s side, need not lead any one to think we are at all partisan in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n“New pacers with records of 2:15 or better:\r\n\r\n    Flying Gib      2:05¾\r\n    Jay-Eye-See     2:06¼\r\n    W.

Three of them have paced miles better than\r\ntwo minutes, and such names as Star Pointer, Joe Patchen, John R. Gentry,\r\nDirect, Robert J. and others have made the turf bright with glorious\r\ndeeds. Truly the pacer’s development surpasses even prophecy!\r\n\r\n(To be continued.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Past is Yesterday’s present. Remember it as you build to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Farmers Think?\r\n\r\nBy S. W. WARFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pertinent question was suggested by a conversation between a young\r\nfarmer—a college graduate—and a young man who had just received his\r\ndiploma from one of the leading agricultural colleges of the country.\r\nWhen questioned by the former as to what vocation he expected to follow,\r\nthe latter said: “I guess I’ll be a farmer, because farmers don’t have\r\nto think.” Was the young man correct? After a day’s journey through the\r\ncountry a very observant and thoughtful man will be forced to acknowledge\r\nthat a great many farmers do not seem to think. The amount of high-priced\r\nmachinery allowed to rust and ruin in the fields, the haphazard way in\r\nwhich grain and hay is stacked, the utter indifference displayed in\r\nplowing land and laying off rows, the disregard that is paid to the\r\nwashing away of the soil, soil that was thousands of years in forming,\r\nthe fertility of which depends upon the actions of the elements for\r\ngenerations; a soil that, when once gone, is gone forever. We are forced\r\nto admit that all farmers do not think. When we see farmers burning straw\r\nstacks or filling gullies with manure, which will soon rot, float off and\r\ncarry all accumulated soil with it, we know in that particular they do\r\nnot think. For when a gully is stopped with manure, it is only a question\r\nof time before it will have to be stopped again, and the next time the\r\ntask will be greater, for there will not be much adjoining soil with\r\nwhich to stop it.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a farmer delving with his whole household from daybreak till\r\ndark, denying his children the privilege of a common school education,\r\ntrusting to luck and brawn to carry them through life, we have another\r\nillustration of a farmer who does not think. For if he would but think,\r\nhe would realize that his sons, after he was dead and gone, would prove\r\neasy victims to the oily tongued sharper and his hard-earned dollars\r\nwould go soon to swell the coffers of another man’s son.\r\n\r\nA great many farmers do not think, and to them rightly belongs the\r\ndisrespectful epithets of “Reuben” and “Hay-seed.”\r\n\r\nAdmitting the foregoing, we are glad to know that there are a great many\r\nfarmers who keep abreast the times, are thoughtful and studious men.\r\n\r\nWith the vast area of fertile soil capable of producing vastly more of\r\nany crop than is needed, which fact is almost every year proven, with\r\na herd of middlemen manipulating the crop reports and combining to put\r\nand keep prices down; with this country a network of railroads, one\r\nand all of them clamoring for freight to haul; with shrewd managers\r\nto concoct the “rebate scheme” to counteract the “Interstate Commerce\r\nLaw” and “Railroad Commission,” put the farmer of any section in direct\r\ncompetition with the whole country. When the above facts are considered,\r\nit certainly behooves every farmer to “think” and study so that the\r\nthinking will be on sure footing.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the past has been, the day of haphazard farming for\r\nsuccess and competency is gone. Farming to-day is a scientific problem,\r\nand a problem that requires all the thought that can be bestowed upon\r\nit. Not a thought for to-day or to-morrow, but long-headed thought that\r\nstudies the supply and demand of the year ahead before planting largely\r\nof any one crop or launching into any new enterprise. He must study the\r\nsupply and price before he can tell whether to hold wheat or longer feed\r\nhis cattle; must know the needs and study the rotation to get the best\r\nresults from each crop; must think to be able to properly harvest and\r\ncare for each crop as it matures; must think how best to become his own\r\nfinancier, and not be controlled by any bank or supply merchant. He must\r\nthink to live on what he makes and make all that he needs.\r\n\r\nThe life of a shrewd, thoughtful farmer is the most independent in the\r\nworld—a life that the followers of all trades and professions yearn\r\nfor, a life acquired only by thought. So, in answering the question, Do\r\nfarmers think? we’ll say, If they succeed, they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNature Nuggets\r\n\r\nBy H. ALISON WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sexuality of plants has been known from the time of Camerarius, 1691;\r\nand yet, what farmer looks to the strains of the seeds he plants? How\r\nmany farmers buy their seed corn in the ear? The fact that like begets\r\nlike should never be overlooked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNature’s secrets, to a great extent, have been revealed, but if the\r\npractical man be not acquainted with the things revealed, to what avail\r\ntheir revelations?

Again, if the soil be properly\r\nconditioned rains will carry the acids, oxygen and lime down below the\r\nsurface to accomplish the same end. After the end is accomplished, the\r\nsoluble foods are brought back to the plants by capillary attraction.\r\nHumus should be in the soil to hold the moisture or foods coming from\r\nabove and below.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSystem breeds success, neglected details, failure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFarming needs brains as well as brawn; furthermore, it offers far greater\r\nopportunities for brains than do the overcrowded professions of the\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBuy for cash, and you will get more and need less.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are known by our faults and judged by the errors we make.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWouldst Thou Succeed?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wouldst thou succeed?

As it is in a few more decades, if the same spirit of\r\ngood feeling continues to prevail, and the fanatics be allowed to die a\r\nnatural death, it will be a question as to which side will have the most\r\nrespect for the brave men of the other. A striking feature of the great\r\nwar, to me, has always been the unanimity with which the entire country,\r\nwith the probable exception of the military leaders themselves, expected\r\nthe war to speedily terminate. In the South the enlisted men all feared\r\nit would end before they had time to get into a rousing good battle, and\r\nthe same feeling appears to have existed among the Northern volunteers.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this feeling in the South, in talking to an old\r\nfarmer the other day, and he a gallant cavalryman, who belonged to\r\nForrest’s immortal command, he laughingly remarked, that the greatest\r\nnumber of colts he ever saw at one time was a certain Tennessee cavalry\r\nregiment the first year after the war. “You see,” he said, “none of us\r\nexpected the war to last over three or six months, and never dreamed it\r\nwould go over a year. Nearly every man in our regiment went in on his pet\r\nsaddle mare or half thoroughbred, and fully two-thirds of us were horse\r\nbreeders, on a greater or less scale, while at home. But the war went on,\r\nwe were ordered here and there, hundreds of miles from home with plenty\r\nof fighting and little else to think of. We were kept so busy that many\r\nof us, in fact, had forgotten all about the spring breeding, and would\r\nhave been glad if it had forgotten about itself. But not so; the next\r\nspring there came the colts—war babies, to be sure—dropped into a hard\r\nworld at a cruel and unmotherly time, and before we knew it our regiment\r\nhad more colts than we knew what to do with. I had to send my mare home\r\nand get a fresh mount, and the others traded around, or left dam and\r\ncolt to shift for themselves in strange and foreign lands. I have often\r\nwondered what became of that crop of colts, the first breeding venture of\r\nour regiment.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA Contest in the King’s English.\r\n\r\nThere is a young darky downtown, at a livery stable, who has been priding\r\nhimself on his ability, as he expressed it, “ter fling English.” But he\r\ntakes no pride in it any more. Old Wash cured him, and it happened this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n“Wheneber I goes down dar arter yo’ mare,” the old darky said, “dis heah\r\nyoung niggah gins ter fling his English ’roun’ scan’lus. I tell you,\r\nboss, I’m gittin’ tired ob dat, an’ I’m gwi’ teach ’im how ter talk\r\nEnglish sho’ nuff some day. I sw’ar to you, sah,” said the old man, as he\r\nmopped his face with his red handkerchief, “It’s so hot I’ve mighty nigh\r\nmulterplied, an’ I’ve got de commissary rumertism, ter boot; but jes you\r\nwatch out fur me de naixt time dat nigger ’gins ter fling his jaw-bone\r\n’roun’ whar I’m standin’—jes you watch me riddle ’im wid sintax an’\r\norfrography an’ sich! Jes you watch!”\r\n\r\nFor several days after that I noticed the old man studying an old Davies\r\nGeometry and an obsolete work on synonyms, which I had sent to the attic\r\nlong ago—looking, as he expressed it, for “some good cuss-words to fit de\r\n’casion.” But I had forgotten all about it until one evening I drove into\r\nthe stable with him. A sprightly young darky ran out, took the mare by\r\nthe bit, and patronizingly remarked:\r\n\r\n“Gentermen, condescen’ to disintergrate frum de vehicle, an’ de quadruped\r\nshall hab my unqualified solicertashun, wid abundance ob nutrititious\r\nellerments.” And he smirked at the old man as much as to say: “Don’t dat\r\nparlyze you, old man?”\r\n\r\n“Hold on dar,” exclaimed Old Wash, and his eyes flashed as he rose\r\nquickly to the occasion: “Sonny,” he began witheringly, “it is\r\ntransparent to de interlactual apprehension ob eny disinterested\r\nindividual dat de gravertashun of special conceits described on de\r\nhypotonuse of your simeon-headed eclipse, am entirely too cumbershum fur\r\nde horizontal vinculum dat circumscribes de radius ob yo’ cocoanut-shaped\r\ntrapezium, sah!”\r\n\r\n“Wha—wha—what dat you say, Unker Wash?” gasped the young darky as his jaw\r\nbegan to drop.\r\n\r\n“I merely riz ter interjec’ de mental reservashun,” remarked the old man\r\nindifferently, “dat de interlectual hemmerage of verbosity procedin’ from\r\nde vacuum produced by de metermorphosis ob de origonal superstructure\r\nof de san’-stones ob yo’ cranium, am entirely incumpatabul wid de\r\nconsterpastion of ideas generated by de paralysis ob yo’ interlectual\r\nacumen, sah!”\r\n\r\n“Gord, what is he sayin’?” remarked the young negro sheepishly to the\r\ncrowd that had gathered to enjoy his discomfiture.\r\n\r\n“In udder words,” shot out the old man again, “ter make hit entirely\r\nincomprehensibul to de conglommerated hypothesis ob yo’ trapezoidal\r\ninterlec’, I simply remarked dat de corporeal superfluerty ob yo’\r\nphysical insigniferkance am entirely too cumbersome fur de belly-band ob\r\nyo’ mental confermashun, sah!”\r\n\r\nHere the crowd shouted, the young darky’s eyes looked like moons, his\r\nlegs shook, and he gasped out: “Wha—wha—what dat old man talkin’ ’bout,\r\nman?”\r\n\r\n“How long since this nigger wus cotch in the jungles of Africa,”\r\nasked Old Wash quietly of the proprietor of the stable, “dat he can’t\r\nunderstan’ de simples’ remark in de plaines’ of English?”\r\n\r\nAnd then the old man tried again. He rolled up his sleeves, and with the\r\nair of one who was trying to make himself exceedingly plain he began\r\nlaying it off on his fingers and palm:\r\n\r\n“Sonny, de equilateral altertude of de comprehenserbility ob my former\r\nobservations wus to de effect dat, if in de course of a cummercial\r\ntransacshun, I shu’d onexpectedly negotiate fur yo’ habeas-corporosity\r\nat its intrinsic invalidity an’ quickly dispose of it at de exaggerated\r\nhifolutiness of yo’ own colossal conceitability an’ hipnartic expectashun\r\nI’d have sufficient commercial collateral to transpose my present\r\nhabitation to de perennial localization of de avenue called Easy.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the young darky was fairly groveling in the dust.\r\n\r\n“Do yo’ comprehen’ dat,” yelled the old man, “yo’ po’ benighted\r\nparallelergram, distended from de apex of a truncated coon (cone), yo’\r\nbow-legged son of a parallelopipedon—”\r\n\r\nBut the old man got no further with his geometrical swearing, for\r\namid the shouts of the spectators his opponent had vanished, and\r\nas he went up the street to have the old man arrested for swearing\r\nin public, he remarked to the policeman as he told his tale: “I\r\ndidn’t keer, Cap’n, ’bout ’im outgineralin’ me er flingin’ English,\r\nan’ outcussin’ me in mo’ kinder newfangled cuss words den eber cum\r\nout ob Turkey, but when he ’flected on my mother by callin’ me de\r\nbow-legged-son-ob-a-parrot-an-er-pigeon-roost, de nigger don’t lib dat I\r\ngwi’ take dat frum!”\r\n\r\nIt was a week later before Old Wash and I had occasion to drive into the\r\nstable again. We were met by the same darky, who took the mare by the bit\r\nand meekly remarked: “Light, gentlemen; I’ll take de mair.”\r\n\r\nAnd the old man said: “I am so excruciatinly rejoiced, sonny, to\r\nrecognize de rejuvernated resurrection ob de exhileratin’ perception\r\ndat an infinertesermal ray ob common sense has penertrated de comatose\r\ncondition ob yo’ fibrous misunderstanding’. In other words,” he winked,\r\n“I’se saved an ebononic interlec frum er new-bohn grave.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Little Girl.”\r\n\r\nPioneer days in Texas, and the prairies unbroken by the smoke of a single\r\ncabin. To the south the Brazos, and to the west the buffalo lands, the\r\nherds crawling in the distance, like huge mud-waves on land, toward their\r\nfall feeding grounds.\r\n\r\nThere had been raids by the Comanches, then hot fighting with the troops\r\nand every settler west of the Brazos had run into the fort, each with his\r\nfamily, his man-servant and maid-servant, each with his cattle and his\r\nasses. For the Comanches are wily devils and born horsemen. One day they\r\nare here, and the next they are not. And they go on ponies that are as\r\ntough as their riders, and as fast and as fearless, and no man knows when\r\nand where they will strike.\r\n\r\nThree full companies of troops had gone north on the track of the\r\ndesperate band who, but a few days before, had surprised the settlers\r\non the upper Brazos and, after killing and scalping and plundering, had\r\nfled, as the troops thought, northward. The stricken settlers had been\r\ncoming in for two days, all plundered, tired, many wounded and some still\r\nsobbing with the grief that would never die.\r\n\r\nThere were little children—motherless, fatherless. There were mothers and\r\nfathers who but a day before held loving ones in their arms.\r\n\r\nTroop H, 7th Regiment, was holding the fort while the other companies\r\nwent north to avenge.\r\n\r\nThe First Lieutenant of Troop H was a beardless youth just from West\r\nPoint. He had been shot out of West Point into the saddle and to the\r\nfront. Two months of it had bronzed him and added two years to his looks;\r\nbut sentiment was still in him and Romance claimed his for her own. He\r\nhad had enough fighting for any ordinary trooper, but to-day he felt sad\r\nthat three companies had gone north after the marauders and he—he held\r\nthe peaceful fort.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting across the great plains and shadows had lengthened to\r\ntheir uttermost when a man on a cow-pony galloped in, not from the north,\r\nbut from the west.\r\n\r\nHis pony was reeling at the first gate. It was dead in the fort ten\r\nminutes later. The man himself carried two Comanche arrows sticking\r\nthrough a shoulder and an arm. A gash was in his head from a glancing\r\narrow and blood ran from another that had cut across his forehead.\r\n\r\nHe was unconscious before the surgeon could extract the arrows from his\r\nbody, but he said enough. The Comanches were not north, but west—they\r\nhad attacked him in his little squatter cabin forty miles west—they had\r\nkilled all his stock but one pony—he had no family but a little girl—he\r\nhad escaped on the pony. “An’ the little gal—God knows—I seed her cut\r\nfor a dug-out in the side of a hill—a kind of a cellar—where I kept\r\npertatoes an’ sich—then—wal—”\r\n\r\nHe went to sleep.\r\n\r\n“Let him sleep,” said the surgeon, “he is nearly gone as it is—forty\r\nmiles and blood leakin’ out of him every jump of the pony.”\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the bugler called “boots and saddles,” and when Company\r\nH wheeled in the fort’s square, the Captain said:\r\n\r\n“Well, men, the boys are on a cold trail. You have heard where the devils\r\nare; we can’t all go. Half of us must stay behind to hold the fort. I’ll\r\nbe fair to all, for I know you all want to go, so count by twos.”\r\n\r\n“One,”\r\n\r\n“Two.”\r\n\r\n“One,”\r\n\r\n“Two.”\r\n\r\nIt went down the line, one hundred strong.\r\n\r\n“Numbers Two, ten paces forward, march!”\r\n\r\nThere was a happy smile on Numbers Two as they spurred forward—they knew\r\nwhat it meant. They were lucky.\r\n\r\n“Now, boys, you know I want to lead you,” went on the Captain, “but it\r\nisn’t fair. I must take my chances, too, and tote fair with the First\r\nLieutenant. Lieutenant Troup will toss up with me,” he said with a laugh\r\nas he tossed a coin from his saddle into the air. It flashed high up in\r\nthe sunlight.\r\n\r\n“Heads for me, Lieutenant, and here’s wishing you—”\r\n\r\n“Tails!” said the soldier who picked it up.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant flushed as he spurred forward saluting. Then men cheered\r\nagain and the Captain wheeled, saying:\r\n\r\n“Take them out, Lieutenant Troup—it’s your luck, and maybe—ah, well, you\r\ncan’t tell how many there are, you know, and half a company is mighty few\r\nafter sending out three troops. Leave your trinkets, men, and any message\r\nyou may wish to send home. Yes, it’s a nasty bit of a fight you’ll be\r\nhaving, likely, and I wish it had been my luck to be in it. I have been\r\nin service a little longer, you know, perhaps the Lieutenant might—”\r\n\r\nBut the Lieutenant only smiled and saluted again.\r\n\r\n“I’ll do my best, Captain—war is on and it’s my time, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain pressed his hand as the Company filed out of the fort.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time the Lieutenant kept thinking of the half-dead man who\r\nkept saying even in his delirium: “An’ my little gal—God knows—I seed her\r\ncut for a dug-out—”\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant was young—very young—and he was romantic. He could see the\r\nlittle girl—of course she was about sixteen—all settlers called their\r\ngrown girls little. Perhaps—well—if she hadn’t been killed—\r\n\r\nThe troup wanted to gallop, but the Lieutenant brought them to a steady\r\ntrot:\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, men, and ten miles an hour is fast enough. We may need\r\nour horses for all that’s in them. We’ll be there by midnight as it is.”\r\n\r\nThe moon arose and drifted higher and higher and still the troopers\r\nstruck grimly across the plain. The wind brought the howl of wolves—big\r\ngreys—and the yelp of coyotes, but the troopers turned neither to the\r\nright nor left, and the Lieutenant rode at their head, and all the time\r\nhe was wondering what had become of the pretty girl—helpless—alone. “An’\r\nmy little gal—God knows—I seed her cut for a dug-out!”\r\n\r\nIt was the first streak of day. The men and horses had been resting for\r\nfour hours—those not on picket, and some had even slept and were fresh.\r\nBut the young officer could think of nothing but the little girl, and\r\nwonder at her fate.\r\n\r\nThey had lined in behind a few willows that skirted a small stream and\r\nwere concealed from the view of the Indians. Then they looked well to\r\nrifles and Colts. The light came slowly and as they peered through the\r\nmist where the cabin stood only a burnt place blurred the dry grass of\r\nthe prairie. There were no Indians in sight.\r\n\r\n“Thar—look!”\r\n\r\nIt was an old Indian fighter whose keen eyes saw it first—a thing which\r\nlooked like a potato-house butting out of a clay bank.\r\n\r\n“Thar’s life in thar—see—it’s the little gal, an’ she’s alive yit—see!”\r\n\r\nFrom the protection of small rises on the right three Comanches galloped\r\nout encircling the dug-out in a very generous circle. They had slipped on\r\nthe off-side of their ponies and clung to mane and neck, with one leg and\r\nheel thrust over the flank.\r\n\r\nThe old fighter snarled: “The cowardly coyotes! They seem ter be mighty\r\nskeered of a little gal. Say, but they’ve got a whole lot o’ respect for\r\nher; she must have a weep’n o’ some sort in thar an’ tort ’em a crackin’\r\nless’n with it, or them dogs ’ud et her up befo’ now; why—thar, by gad—”\r\n\r\nHe gripped the Lieutenant’s shoulder as a puff of smoke leaped out of the\r\nclay bank and the foremost pony stopped so quickly that it went down,\r\nComanche under.\r\n\r\n“She’s killed that Indian sho’,” cried the old hunter in a whisper. “No\r\nlive Comanche was ever cocht under a fallin’ pony. See.”\r\n\r\nThe pony sprang quickly up—the bullet had creased him; but marvelous the\r\nshot!—it had gone to the exact spot where it would bring down a pony\r\ncreased and a rider with a hole through his head.\r\n\r\n“That’s shootin’ some,” cried the old hunter as the young officer gave\r\nthe quick commands:\r\n\r\n“Ready!”\r\n\r\n“Mount!”\r\n\r\n“Charge!”\r\n\r\n“An’ remember the little gal!” they shouted as they broke across the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nIt was a running fight and the Indians taken by surprise, for they were\r\nafter the thing in the dug-out. And they paid for it—sixteen dead ones\r\nin the first half mile. The others—they had enough to get away from the\r\nforty troopers who shot as they rode and shot to kill.\r\n\r\nThen the Lieutenant and ten men rode back to the dug-out. They approached\r\nit slowly—reverently, and all the time the young officer was thinking of\r\ndark eyes and auburn curls and the beauty and bravery of the little girl.\r\n\r\n“Hello!” he shouted, his voice trembled in spite of himself.\r\n“Hello!—we’re your friends.”\r\n\r\n“Hello, yo’self—mighty glad to see you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the little girl, men,” shouted the Lieutenant, boyishly, as he\r\nrushed up. “She’s safe! hurrah!” and they gave it with a ring.\r\n\r\nAt the door he stopped short and looked into the hole under the\r\npotato-house.\r\n\r\nThen his romance went out as the tide to the sea.\r\n\r\nA woman at least thirty-five stood there. Her hair was red, her features\r\nhard, her face burned by the sun. Grim, square jaws set off her face.\r\nThere was a line only to show where her lips met in deadly determination.\r\nShe wore moccasins and leggins, a short skirt of deer skin and she held\r\nin her hand a rifle that had sent a dozen Indians to death in the twelve\r\nlong hours she had held the little fort. Stuck in her belt were two good\r\npistols. A thousand Comanches with arrows and antiquated guns could not\r\nhave taken her.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said, “but I’m glad to see you. Say, but I stood ’em off all\r\nright, didn’t I? It was awful—’specially last night, but the moon riz\r\nan’ saved me, for a Comanche with an arrow or a old gun is kinder techus\r\n’bout a rifle. Is Pap safe?”\r\n\r\nThey told her he was.\r\n\r\n“I tried to git the old fool to stay. I told him all hell couldn’t git us\r\nout o’ this hole, armed as we wus, lessen they come with bilin’ water,”\r\nshe laughed, “but he got panicky an’ vamoosed on the only pony left. Dad\r\nallers was a gal.”\r\n\r\n“Good gad,” cried the old hunter bluntly at last, “an’ is you the little\r\ngal he kip talkin’ ’bout?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he allers called me that,” she smiled.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’re the gamest little gal I ever seed,” and he wrung her hand\r\nwhile the others followed suit. “An’ you’re our little gal now,” went\r\non the old hunter, proudly, “an’ as I ain’t seed one like you since\r\nmine died years ago, I’d—I’d—I’d lak to kiss you jes onct for her,” he\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you shet up,” she said hotly. “D’ye think I stood off a lot o’\r\nComanches all night to be rewarded by kissin’ a old grizzly like you? But\r\nsay,” she added, hesitating, and with a laugh, “I wouldn’t mind kissin’\r\nthat pretty little boy thar!”\r\n\r\nThere was a wild shout from the men, but the young Lieutenant had turned\r\nto mount his horse.\r\n\r\n“Any way you belong to Company H,” said the old hunter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Preface.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the ladies of a church in Marion, Alabama, Trotwood\r\nwrote the following Preface, a few weeks ago for a cook-book which the\r\nladies are publishing with a view of paying off a church debt:\r\n\r\nThe climate, the soil, the very air play their part in the art of good\r\nrecipes. The cooking of the North and West is very different from that\r\nof the South, for Southern recipes are the products of sunshine and\r\nSouthlands, of culture, of rest, of the Old South.\r\n\r\nAnd nowhere has the Old South flowered to sweeter perfume than in my\r\nnative town of Marion. Macaulay’s New Zealander, if placed in Delmonico’s\r\nwould straightway beckon for cold clam, and good King Edward, if stranded\r\nin New Zealand, would soon fish an oyster cocktail out of some unruffled\r\nkiss of the sea.\r\n\r\nRecipes, indeed, are a test of one’s civilization—one’s religion—one’s\r\nmentality. They are the products of the centuries beginning with the\r\nprimitive clam and ending with the thousand glories of the oyster. They\r\nare the literature of the laughter which comes with good eating, the\r\nbon mots of jolly stomachs, the sparkle of centuries of good cheer, the\r\nmorals of mucous membranes, the religion of healthy livers.\r\n\r\nCharles Lamb tells us that roast pig, for instance, was accidentally\r\ndiscovered by the primitive man in the burning of his crude stable in\r\nwhich was a litter of pigs. After that, fires were frequent and log\r\nstables few. And I doubt not if the history of every good recipe in this\r\nsplendid collection were traced to its birth, it would show an unbroken\r\nline of progress as clearly defined as Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nThink not lightly, then, of the book, for you have in your hand the\r\nconcentrated perfection of the culinary ages. The dash of Caesar into\r\nBriton, the strength of the Dane, the brilliancy of the Norman, the\r\nexcellency of Angle and Saxon, the glory of the English and the old\r\nScotch. It is history, religion, progress. It is a novel more interesting\r\nthan all novels, a poem which made Tennyson possible.\r\n\r\nI have not read these recipes. I speak from higher authority. I have\r\ntasted them. From my infancy up I have known them. They are part of my\r\nlife and this article returned to them is a feeble result of their cause.\r\nThey are interwoven with the memory of my home, in the song of the pine\r\ntree, in the opal gleam of the old red hills, in the sweetness, the\r\nculture, the religion of Marion. And to-night, should Abou Ben Adhem’s\r\nAngel come to me and ask for the name of one blessed beyond his dues, I\r\nwould answer: “It is I, O Angel, blessed beyond words in the mother I\r\nhad, in the father; blessed in my birthplace, in the people among whom I\r\ngrew up, in the moral sweetness of their schools and churches, blessed\r\nthat I was born in\r\n\r\n                   MARION.\r\n\r\n    An opal sky and a sea of green,\r\n          Marion.\r\n    And ruby-red the hills between,\r\n          Marion.\r\n    Twilight tints that blend and shine\r\n    Through sinking clouds and sighing pine—\r\n    Dear native land—sweet mother mine—\r\n          Marion.\r\n\r\n    Rest and peace and sweet release,\r\n          Marion.\r\n    Home and the loves that never cease,\r\n          Marion.\r\n    O, cradling stars from out the glen—\r\n    O, sweet moon-mother, come again—\r\n    O, Peace that passeth human ken—\r\n          Marion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee Jersey\r\n\r\nBY W. J. WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.—Mr. W. J. Webster developed two of the three greatest\r\n    cows of the world to championship honors, and has made more\r\n    great churn tests than, perhaps, any other living man. His\r\n    experience is of the practical kind.—Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has become a well-known name among Jersey cattle breeders of the\r\nUnited States and frequently used in advertising strains of blood by the\r\nvarious owners. This is easily accounted for by the high stand taken by\r\nJersey cows owned, developed and bred in Tennessee. Many years ago the\r\npioneer breeders of this favorite dairy breed of cattle, Major Campbell\r\nBrown, Judge Thos. H. Malone, M. C. Campbell, M. M. Gardner, and the\r\nwriter of this article, W. J. Webster, built their herds on a very solid\r\nfoundation:\r\n\r\nFirst—Constitution and ability to stand long continued high feed.\r\n\r\nSecond—Richness of milk as well as quantity, but with the goal always\r\ncentered on production of butter as ascertained by actual test, without\r\nany instrument, calculation or guess work. The churn was adopted as a\r\ntest system.\r\n\r\nThird—Beauty, symmetry and general conformity. We early in our course of\r\nbreeding determined that beauty of cattle should not be ignored, but was\r\nan element certainly in the sale. Therefore, Tennessee Jerseys were bred\r\nfor all these qualities claimed and I do not think that anywhere in the\r\nUnited States a more uniform or more beautiful set of animals could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Basin of Tennessee is especially adapted to the breeding,\r\nrearing and developing of this cow. We have here the elements of the soil\r\nentering into the blood of the animal which I think develops them more\r\nhighly than in any other portion of the United States. We have lime rock\r\nand bone phosphate of lime entering into the water they drink, and the\r\nbluegrass and other grasses that they eat, corn, oats and hay consumed\r\nby them, and also mingled with enough iron so that the very highest\r\nopportunities are available for their growth. This thought applies not\r\nalone to the Jersey cow but to the whole animal kingdom as evidenced by\r\nthe fact that some of the finest race horses in the world, either running\r\nor pacing horses, have been developed in this Middle Basin of Tennessee.\r\nIn point of climate we are exceptionally well located, all things\r\nconsidered, about the same as the Isle of Jersey, the original home of\r\nthe Jersey cow. No wonder then that with the additional advantages of our\r\nsoil mentioned above the Jersey has developed wonderfully in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe question is sometimes asked why prices have declined the last twelve\r\nor fifteen years. My reply is that prices have not declined all over the\r\nUnited States, but that the old breeders have dropped out in Tennessee\r\nand that there are now very few breeders in Tennessee paying any\r\nattention to the development of the Jersey cow. Recently Messrs. Overton\r\nand Gardner, of Nashville, have begun to pay more attention to it and I\r\npredict that if this is continued the prices will again rise for they\r\nhave not fallen in New York and other centers, but the present year sales\r\nare higher than they have ever been at auction, as shown by the general\r\naverage at the Cooper sale of over six hundred dollars per head, a single\r\nanimal bringing ten thousand dollars and that in a sale of over a hundred\r\nanimals. So it is not a declining in the prices of the breed cattle but\r\nsimply a lack of driving their interests in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe system of testing Jerseys and knowing exactly what they were capable\r\nof doing did more to develop them than anything else. The American is\r\nalways an eminently practical man and wants to know what he is doing\r\ninstead of guessing. The Tennessee breeders inaugurated this test system,\r\nMessrs. Campbell Brown, Thos. H. Malone, M. M. Gardner and W. J. Webster\r\nhaving edited the first compilation of test in the United States as a\r\nventure of their own and at their own risk and expense; then turned it\r\nover to the Club of American Jersey Cattle Breeders, and the work has\r\nbeen continued by the club since that time. Prior to this time tests were\r\nreported to newspapers and frequently tests were claimed for ancestors\r\nof cattle that subsequent research showed were either tests for one day\r\nmultiplied by seven, making it an estimate test, or in some instances\r\nthat they did not exist at all. It therefore required a large amount\r\nof labor to run down by correspondence all this and procure from their\r\nowners the actual tests, and these were published with the tabulated\r\npedigree of the cow. This work caused a boom in the Jersey family shown\r\nto be prominent, and this has continued all along where they were pushed\r\nand developed. Tennessee breeders were fortunate in having laid well\r\ntheir foundation as it was based on such cows as Landseer’s Fancy, Oonan,\r\nDuchess of Bloomfield, Beeswax, Kate Gordon and other prominent and\r\nbeautiful cows and it so happened that the cows named possessed all the\r\nrequisites, constitution, richness and beauty, and no money was spared\r\nin heading the herd with such animals as Imported Tormentor, Signalda,\r\nIda’s Stoke Pogis, Gold Basis, Southern Prince and other noted animals\r\ntoo numerous to mention. From these came what is known as the Tennessee\r\nJerseys, possessing constitution, richness and beauty. As proof of\r\nthe wonderful development of these cows any person who desires to be\r\ninformed has only to consult the test books in charge of the American\r\nJersey Cattle Club to find that the richest cattle ever bred, owned and\r\ndeveloped were in Tennessee: Bisson’s Belle with the yearly test of 1,028\r\npounds and fifteen ounces, that held the champion cup, was developed in\r\nTennessee; Landseer’s Fancy tested 936 pounds fourteen and three-quarter\r\nounces in one year, was developed in Tennessee and held the cup. She and\r\nher descendants are known for their extreme richness: so marvelously rich\r\nthat they were compelled to demonstrate their ability to make this test\r\nagain and again, a number of times by official tests, by disinterested\r\ncommittees and verified by chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nI could not in this article undertake to give a list of Jersey cows from\r\nTennessee in the honor roll, but only mention a few of the prominent\r\nones: Ethleel the Second, 30 pounds 15 ounces at two and one-half years\r\nold; Landseer’s Fancy, 29 pounds one-half ounce; Bisson’s Belle, 28\r\npounds 10 ounces; Toltec’s Fancy, 27 pounds 5½ ounces—this cow was\r\nofficially tested by the Alabama experiment station and Major Campbell\r\nBrown, and her milk analyzed at Vanderbilt University confirms the test\r\nshowing butter fat 16.32 per cent, equivalent to one pound of butter\r\nto 4.79 of milk; Oonan, 22 pounds 2½ ounces; Duchess of Bloomfield, 20\r\npounds one-half ounce; Cherokee Rose, 23 pounds 10 ounces. And I might\r\ncontinue even from memory, as this article is dictated from memory (no\r\nrecords being before me), and give a long list. But for the purposes of\r\nthis article it would be useless and simply a compilation that the people\r\nwould not read, so I only call attention to the fact that the champion\r\ncup, a large silver urn costing five hundred dollars, was held only four\r\ntimes in all; twice in Tennessee against the whole United States. But to\r\nprove that the Tennessee Jersey has life in any other hands, scattered\r\nfar and wide over the United States we have only to look at the work of\r\nthe last great test at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis to\r\nshow what their descendants have done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISSON’S BELLE.]\r\n\r\nThe American Jersey Cattle Club has published a pamphlet giving the work\r\nof the Jersey team of twenty-five selected from all over the United\r\nStates under a committee appointed by the American Jersey Cattle Club\r\nwhich showed no favoritism, but the cows were judged for entrance into\r\nthis team by preliminary tests at St. Louis and then the team selected\r\nby a committee. It ought to be very gratifying to the old breeders in\r\nTennessee to analyze this pamphlet and find that the cattle bred, owned\r\nand developed in Tennessee have, through their descendants, put their\r\nmark on thirteen of the twenty-five. It certainly is very pleasant to the\r\nwriter of this to find that Tormentor, owned by Major Campbell Brown,\r\nplaced his mark on twelve of the twenty-five; Landseer’s Fancy, owned by\r\nthe writer, on seven; Oonan, six; Toltec’s Fancy, four. Only one other\r\ncow in the United States, of co-temporaneous age, competes with them with\r\nsix, this cow Erotas.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noted that No. 1 of the team of twenty-five champion\r\nover own team, the champion cow of all breeds at the World’s Fair, is\r\na descendant from cattle owned, bred and developed by old Tennessee\r\nbreeders. I do not mean, of course, that she is composed entirely of this\r\nblood, but she takes her line directly back from Chemical Test bred in\r\nTennessee, son of Toltec’s Fancy, that in turn was daughter of Landseer’s\r\nFancy. So carrying the blood of Tormentor, Landseer’s Fancy and Oonan.\r\n\r\nThen permit an old breeder to make the suggestion that what has been\r\ndone once could be done now even to greater advantage if taken up and\r\nthe proper amount of energy, zeal and intelligence bestowed upon it.\r\nPrices would again revive and Jersey interests in Tennessee would again\r\ndevelop. Why should young breeders of the country neglect the natural\r\nadvantages we have, backed by experience and the development of the\r\nbreed already accomplished? I think if there ever was a time that is\r\nexceedingly favorable for this industry it is now.\r\n\r\nCommencing with Landseer’s Fancy, then giving about thirty pounds of\r\nmilk per day, which made under test 14 pounds 6 ounces in one week, I\r\nfed and developed her through a long series of years, using more and\r\nmore concentrated food and less bran, until in the end she was capable\r\nof digesting two gallons at a feed, equal parts corn and oats, with\r\none-half gallon of bran (pure wheat bran), and when making her maximum\r\namount of butter—29 pounds one-half ounce—was giving only from twenty\r\nto twenty-three pounds of milk per day, and subsequently went as low as\r\nseventeen or eighteen pounds of milk per day, holding her own with regard\r\nto the butter. So it will be seen that from the commencement she lost in\r\nquantity of milk, but under such feed gained in butter. Her milk was so\r\nremarkably rich as also her daughter, Toltec’s Fancy’s milk, that, for a\r\nlong time having the test questioned notwithstanding the fact that she\r\nhad always proven by repeated official tests all claims made for her,\r\nfinally resorted to glass jars made of heavy glassware wherein her whole\r\nmilk was placed after each milking and placed under seal as usual in\r\nofficial tests so that when lifted from the water the line of cream and\r\nmilk would be seen, and it was demonstrated that it was almost entirely\r\ncream, being about three-fourths to seven-eighths cream. This cow was\r\nexceptional, or I might say, her whole family was exceptional in such\r\nremarkable rich production. But she handed down to her descendants the\r\nsame tendency to richness in other hands long years afterwards. She has\r\ntwo sons with over seventy daughters in the honor roll of the Jerseys,\r\nand five daughters all in the fourteen-pound class and upwards, and it\r\nwould be hard to give a list of her descendants in the fourteen-pound\r\nclass. I should say something over two hundred. This cow, with others\r\nhandled by me, was fed according to the capacity of each cow to digest\r\nthe corn and oats ground together, with grass, hay and running water\r\nat will. On this point I cannot too strongly emphasize the fact that\r\nTennessee is better located and supplied with running water than any\r\nplace I have ever seen. With all the bluegrass and other facilities of\r\nKentucky, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana, they lack running water for the\r\ncows to drink and the running water to set the milk in.\r\n\r\nI have tried every known experiment in raising the cream on the milk\r\nfor the best results, but in all I have ever tried I have never found\r\nanything equal to the stone spring-house with wire gauze over the windows\r\nto keep out all insects, ceiled overhead with plank (not plastered),\r\nand set the milk in jars, either stone or glass, when first drawn from\r\nthe cow warm, in the water about 56 to 59 degrees temperature. The\r\ntemperature of the milk soon becomes the same temperature as the water\r\nand remains stationary until all the cream is raised in the milk. The\r\ncurrent of water keeps the air in the spring-house fresh and clean and\r\nevery facility is given for the production of butter.\r\n\r\nIn building the various spring-houses that I used on the different farms\r\nat different times, I always used what is known as the test-room, about\r\nsix feet wide across the entire spring-house, a wall of brick or stone\r\ncemented inside and out, with only one door and window in the same, both\r\nof which could be placed under seal by any committee called to test the\r\ncattle at any time, or used by myself and manager in making private\r\ntests, so that the milk of the cow under test could be kept absolutely\r\nuntampered with by any person. And the tests made by me were made in this\r\nway and verified by various committees and also by chemical analysis. So\r\nthat when I went out of breeding Jerseys I know that I had more official\r\ntests than any Jersey breeder, and probably at one time as much as all\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nI believe in the theory that especial families of Jerseys are capable of\r\nbeing fed so as to grow richer after long continued feed. Some will not.\r\nThere is a limit that will be found in nearly all of them.\r\n\r\nIn testing cattle it was always my purpose to ascertain the maximum of\r\nfood capable of being digested by any cow under test, and fall slightly\r\nbelow this quantity of feed so as to keep her appetite always whetted.\r\n\r\nAnother point was that she be fed regularly and preferably, not over\r\ntwice a day with concentrated foods, and thus giving the stomach all the\r\ntime to do its work. I have seen many a test disturbed by feeding only a\r\nsmall amount of grain at the dinner time out of order. It disturbs the\r\nentire digesting of the animals and will probably throw them off a day or\r\ntwo. When undisturbed, the same cow will come up at night and take her\r\nregular feed and not be disturbed in her test at all. It may be thought\r\nthat this is going into detail too much, but small details sometimes have\r\nwonderful influence in handling any animal. A horse may be just on edge\r\nfor a race and some small circumstance occur that disturbs it. So with\r\nthe wonderful mechanism of the cow making her four pounds of butter per\r\nday, she must be handled very carefully.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, what profit is there in all this? My reply is that if\r\nLandseer’s Fancy had not been tested as she was and thoroughly developed\r\nher descendants might have passed unnoticed and we would have been none\r\nthe wiser as to the capabilities of this family. I have taken her as an\r\ninstance because more familiar with her history than others, and because\r\nshe was the hub around which the herd revolved. I paid $175 for her,\r\nand, on calculation of her descendants owned by me and sold to others,\r\nshe realized nearly $30,000 without any calculation as to her milk and\r\nbutter. She entered into and formed the web and woof of what was known\r\nas The Columbia Jersey Cattle Company’s herd. She was sold subsequently\r\nwhen that corporation was wound up to Messrs. Webster and Morrow and\r\nentered the great herd at Nashville.\r\n\r\nThis Columbia Jersey Cattle Company organized with a capital stock of\r\n$20,000, paid a dividend of 14 per cent or over per annum, and the stock\r\nwas retired at par with all debts paid; one of the most successful of\r\nall Jersey cattle enterprises I was ever in. I think the last year, with\r\nabout thirty working cows and the dairy receipts of thirty-six hundred\r\ndollars and over and the sales of calves and cattle from the herd, with\r\nthe herd products and heifers added, was something over ten thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nIt was then located at Indian Camp Springs, about three miles from\r\nColumbia and an ideal place for a spring-house, the spring being about\r\nfifty nine feet above the spring-house and coming to the spring-house\r\nthrough a four inch pipe, but the water had to be cut off so that it\r\nwould run slowly into the spring-house, and when we wanted to work the\r\nbutter in the churn it would be turned on into the hose and the butter\r\nthoroughly washed.\r\n\r\nYoung breeders cannot adopt a better formula for feed than the one I have\r\nsuggested, which is cheap also in the long run, for it is a farm product\r\nand it is not necessary to buy on the market, but it can be produced on\r\nthe farm. Besides this, no cow will stand commercial feed as she will\r\nthis corn and oats in equal parts. It is nearer suited to nature and\r\nshe can stand this feed longer without injury than any commercial food.\r\nWhen I say corn and oats in equal parts I mean bushel for bushel mixed\r\nand ground together. If any one will think a minute there is nothing\r\ndeleterious in this food. You can get it absolutely pure, whereas if you\r\ngo to market to buy bran to feed the cattle on you do not know what you\r\nare getting, sometimes the sweeping of the mill floor and any old waste\r\nthe miller is pleased to throw off. The Jersey breeder ought essentially\r\nto be a farmer and raise on his own farm what his herd consumes and thus\r\nmarket the products of the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn The Open\r\n\r\n    (Note.—Under this head communications are invited from\r\n    the open—of gun, dog and rod—stories of hunting, fishing,\r\n    traveling, etc.—Ed.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRAIRIE CHICKEN HUNT IN NORTH DAKOTA.\r\n\r\nBy Trotwood.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen of this great republic should travel over his own country.\r\nHe will be amazed at its greatness, and his prejudices and local\r\nconceits, if he have any breadth at all, will grow fewer the further he\r\ngoes, and learns that the world cares nothing for the petty environments\r\nand embroilments of his own bailiwick.\r\n\r\nThe most attractive country in the Northwest is the great prairies of\r\nthe Dakotas. I thought I had some idea of their immensity, of their\r\ngreatness, until for one solid day and night I raced across them by fast\r\nexpress, and saw by day the pillar of their cloud of smokestacks—for it\r\nwas harvest time—on each side, as far as the boundless horizon, and each\r\ncloud a thresher from whose funnel poured the wheat of the nation.\r\n\r\nThere is something in mere land to me—any kind of land—soil, you may call\r\nit—dirt—I care not what. But I love it just as I hate brick walls and\r\ncity pavements. There is something about it, from the rocks and hills to\r\nthe level, plowed valleys, that is clean and good. It means independence\r\nand honesty and clean living. It may not mean shrewdness and polish and\r\nthat smart education which comes from living by one’s wits in a great\r\nwalled-in home of wits, but it means independence and the rest that made\r\nShakespeare.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the Dakotas, I wondered how the white man had stayed away\r\nfrom them as long as he had. Perhaps it were better for the staying,\r\nstarving, striving quality of our forefathers that this grand garden\r\nspot of the Northwest lay hid between the mountains and the sea, instead\r\nof stretching up and down the coast. It were better for their children\r\nthat fathers should toil in sand and flint. It puts flint into the\r\nchildren—steel—gameness—the spirit to do.\r\n\r\nOne generation of striving poverty makes flint; two, steel; three, well,\r\nyou have heard of Andrew Jackson, of Lincoln, perhaps. Study the poverty\r\nof their pedigrees, for it takes poverty to make a pedigree.\r\n\r\nThe first immigrants to our shores came solely for gold, it is said. What\r\nkind of a republic would we have to-day if they had landed on the Pacific\r\nslope of gold instead of the Atlantic slope of rocks?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, America is run over with people to-day who think that gold is\r\neverything. They think it so hard that the land is filled with trusts\r\nand steals and the things which breed greed and guilt. They should\r\nlearn—they must learn—that, as the making of money is the lowest of all\r\nhuman talents—the talent of self first, which is the lowest instinct of\r\nall life—so is its talent for getting the lowest, meanest of all talents.\r\n“All my life,” says Edison, “I have been trying to keep away from mean\r\npeople who make money.”\r\n\r\nFargo I found to be a beautiful and prosperous city, and the soil of the\r\ncountry around it, as it had been for two hundred miles, truly a glory\r\nand an inspiration. If this land had the climate of the South it could\r\nfeed the world. As it is, Nature, who adjusts herself to environments,\r\nacts quickly here, and I was surprised at the stories of its\r\nproductiveness in the short season it had. Nay, mine own eye beheld it,\r\nfor never had I seen such wheat, barley and small grain, such cabbage,\r\nbeets, turnips, vegetables of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThere was a greatness and vastness everywhere. As far as the eye could\r\nsee, even beyond the rim of the horizon, it was vast—vast. And that\r\nalways affects me peculiarly. After I have seen as far as the eye will\r\nreach, I become homesick. I have a sacred, sad longing to see and go\r\nfarther and uplift the veil.\r\n\r\nI rejoiced in the fact that there were no trees, no high hills, nothing\r\nto break the great canvas of vastness—a bivouac of eternity dotted with\r\nmillions of camps of wheat shocks, fringed with the splendor of a vast,\r\npure sky, and framed in the purpling splendor of a horizon of blue and\r\ngold. The little ten acre lots of dwarf trees the Government has forced\r\nthe settlers to plant, I liked them not. They were warts, merely, on the\r\nbrow of Eternity. The great, rich, boundless, beautiful prairies were\r\nthere as God had Intended them to be—Nature’s handiwork, with splendid\r\nharmony in its whole.\r\n\r\nNo picture ever painted has equalled it—for Nature never makes a mistake\r\nin her pictures. She never sticks a bunch of dwarf trees where the great,\r\ngrand prairies should roll away.\r\n\r\nThere is but little difference between the Dakota prairies and the ocean.\r\nThe difference is that only between the imagination and the fact. And\r\nlooking over them, standing in them, seeing the ceaseless waves rippling\r\nacross the seas of wheat or the white caps come spinning from the\r\nuplifted heads of them, again and again I caught myself repeating Byron’s\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    “Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty’s form\r\n      Glasses itself in tempests, in all time,\r\n    Calm or convulsed, in breeze or gale or storm,\r\n      Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime\r\n      Dark heaving;—boundless, endless and sublime—\r\n    The image of Eternity—the throne\r\n      Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime\r\n    The monsters of the deep are made; each zone\r\n      Obeys thee; thou goest forth, dread fathomless, alone.”\r\n\r\nLisbon is a beautiful little town, and one comes upon it so suddenly it\r\nis a surprise. For hours nothing but the grand, great prairies, billowed\r\nin wheat waves, smoke-plumed with thresher stacks. Then down you go into\r\na beautiful valley—the valley of the Cheyenne, and nestling on its banks\r\nclean, church-spired, sits this up-to-date town.\r\n\r\nI landed in good luck there, for I had anticipated the pleasure of\r\nmeeting old friends and relatives—a cousin whom my mother had reared and\r\nwho to me had always been a sister—but I had the additional good luck\r\nto fall into the hands of Mr. Geo. W. Ferguson, the county treasurer,\r\nand the owner of Raymond S. by Montevideo, the handsomest young trotting\r\nsire it has been my good fortune to see in any State. And I found the\r\nblooded stock interest alive and growing in all that section, and surely\r\nno place under the skies has a better license to rear them. In the hands\r\nof Mr. Ferguson and Mr. W. B. Stone, the county game-warden, I realized\r\none of the dreams of my life—a prairie chicken shoot. If you have never\r\nindulged in one, go a thousand miles to Dakota—and every year will find\r\nyou wanting to go again. It was a bright, crisp morning in September, and\r\nMr. Stone’s beautiful setter bitch was good and fit. I had been out early\r\nto see some threshers at work in the wheat, and a little shower coming up\r\nI had gotten wet. This in the South would have meant two hours’ dampness,\r\nand a cold, but imagine my surprise, in a short while, to find the ground\r\ndry and myself with it, very dry! In the rarefied air of this great\r\ncountry I do not believe one can get wet unless he is foolish enough to\r\ndrink water.\r\n\r\nMr. Ferguson met me later with his surrey and two spanking red-sorrel\r\ntrotting mares, as well bred as Raymond S, and away we went across the\r\nprairie after the chickens. The ride itself was pleasure enough—forever\r\ngoing through that beautiful black loam, as tempting to the eye of the\r\nman who loves the soil as a cobwebbed bottle or a fat capon to the\r\nstomach of a priest. For it was bespangled with red berries, ripe heads\r\nof flax, golden stubbles of wheat and oats and barley, red grasses finer\r\nthan ever bluegrass grows to be and richer than all tame blades.\r\n\r\nMy first covey is pictured forever in my mind. The bitch came to a\r\nstaunch stand near a low, marshy place, where the grass was blue green\r\nand studded with fall flowers. On all sides were shocks of wheat, and\r\naway in the distance the interminable smokestacks of busy threshers. I\r\nwalked up and took it all in—I stamped the picture forever on my mind. I\r\nwanted it there that I might always see it—the very clouds, the distant\r\nhorizon, the golden stubble-blades, the very silence that hangs like a\r\nbenediction over the land. And all over it and above everything that\r\nbeautiful Llewellyn bitch, frozen in living marble before me.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” I thought, “that nothing is between these birds and\r\nme but the air?” No pines of Alabama and Mississippi, no thickets on\r\nthe creeks of Louisiana, no wooded lots and big hills of Tennessee, no\r\nbarb-wire fence with hideous signs stuck up warning me that some hog\r\nlived there on posted land? All my life I had shot quail under those\r\nconditions. Now—now—nothing but me and the pure, clear air and the\r\nboundless, rolling prairies and that dog of marble waiting for the word,\r\nto flush a dozen prairie hens squatting in the stubble ready to rise\r\nwith a cyclone’s rush on wings of thunder. I stood frozen—like the dog.\r\nI could not move. My heart beat like a race-horse in the back stretch,\r\nmaking me take long breaths and swallow hard as I came to the hunter’s\r\nattention. Then!—\r\n\r\nNever arose before mortal man so thrilling a sight. They sucked me\r\nforward like the gust of a passing express, like the roar of a wind\r\nstorm, like the burst of sun from a cloud, thunder-lined. The earth of\r\nstubble quivered to their wings of thunder and the air pulsed like a\r\nman-of-war when the big guns bellow to port.\r\n\r\nBut I did not forget to fire—oh, no! Man is a killing animal by instinct,\r\nand a hog by nature, and neither poetry nor romance nor the wild glory\r\nof the great fields can stop him from killing when his killing blood is\r\nup and his stomach is at stake. Yes, I fired—once—twice—and I shot to\r\nkill. Two beautiful ones I picked with lightning glance from the splendid\r\ncovey—two glorious ones that fairly split the air in the wild joy of\r\nescape, only suddenly to—\r\n\r\nWell, “the rest is silence,” as Shakespeare said, when Hamlet died, and\r\nit is the same death that will come to you and me—the end will be just as\r\nsudden, whether we fall in the mid-day of life or fall to the slow fever\r\nof age. They fell but ten feet apart and I walked up and looked down on\r\nthem—the proud, beautiful creatures now limp and lifeless.\r\n\r\nI took them up and fondled them—I wanted to kiss them, they were so quiet\r\nnow and warm, still splendid in death.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone had killed his brace also, but being more experienced, had shot\r\nthem farther off.\r\n\r\n“You killed yours too close,” he said, as I stood fondling the limp and\r\nbeautiful birds. “You should have waited up to fifty yards or seventy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “you see it is my quail hunting instinct. I had my first\r\nlesson in shooting quail in the pine woods of Alabama, and let me tell\r\nyou, I laughed, it may be wrong, but it’s dead easy killing those big,\r\nbeautiful hens. Honestly, except for their lightning flight I thought I\r\nwas shooting at Tennessee guineas.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stone laughed: “You wait and see,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why, if you want to know what real shooting is,” I went on, “you just\r\nget up a covey of piny wood quail, where every mother’s chick of them is\r\ntaught from his pipping moment to place a pine tree between him and a\r\nload of shot, and do it in the first twenty feet. You have got to shoot\r\nquick.”\r\n\r\nWe had walked away across the stubble to where they had gone down,\r\nscattered. Suddenly—\r\n\r\n“There they are,” said my companion. As we came on the bitch frozen again.\r\n\r\n“Now, you first,” said Mr. Stone, kindly, “it’s a single bird.”\r\n\r\nUp went the bird with his thunder of wings. I don’t know how it\r\nhappened—I can’t see how it happened to this day. I think I was thinking\r\nof Alabama quail or Tennessee “patterges,” as Old Wash calls them, but\r\nwhen I fired and the great game cock went on about his business, I got\r\nbusy seeing what ailed my gun, and wondering why we always fall down\r\nabout the time we think we are mounted on as many legs as a centipede.\r\nMr. Stone was too polite to refer to my previous remarks, and I watched\r\nthe big fellow sail away with more respect for the sport.\r\n\r\nA little further on the Llewellyn again stood, and this time it was my\r\ncompanion’s first shot. And here is where I did a shameless thing—but I\r\ncouldn’t help it, to save my life.\r\n\r\nUp went the bird, and I saw the old hunter throw up his gun. I\r\nlistened for the report, but on sailed the bird, fairly eating\r\nspace—on—on—fifty—sixty—seventy yards.\r\n\r\nMy fingers itched, my arms jerked upward, my gun jumped to my shoulder.\r\n“Great heavens,” I thought, “the bird is gone! His gun won’t fire”—\r\n\r\nThe report of my gun and the collapse of the bird came just a second\r\nbefore his.\r\n\r\nHe looked around astonished. “Pray forgive me,” I said. “I have acted the\r\nhog, but I was sure something was the matter with your gun.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed: “I was just waiting for it to get a little farther away.”\r\n\r\nAfter that I shot them farther off, and by noon we had eleven beauties,\r\nfilling up the front of our surrey, upon which my eye feasted in delight.\r\n\r\nWe decided we had enough, and towards evening we drove across the\r\ncooling, sweet grasses to a group of pretty little lakes or ponds in the\r\nhollow depression of the land. These we found literally covered with\r\nSpoonbills, Teal, Mallard and Red-heads, and then we had sport royal and\r\nof another kind. They were wary, though, very; and we had to crawl on\r\nour stomach for a quarter of a mile to get to them, Mr. Stone on the far\r\nside, to fire first and send them over me. And when his gun sounded once,\r\ntwice, here they came toward me, I lying flat in the grass. I picked\r\ntwo big ones leading the flock, knowing if I didn’t get the kings I’d\r\nget the knights and pawns behind them. I didn’t get the king, but down\r\ntumbled a Red-head, a Mallard—one—two—three—four! Good heaven! Did I kill\r\nall of them? I saw smoke drifting across my left. Mr. Stone had turned\r\nhis old Winchester repeater on them, also, and so I gave him credit for\r\neverything but the redhead, for I shot at him. This was our sport—from\r\none lake to another, until we had shot enough, and the ride home across\r\nthe starlit prairies and under the cool, bracing air of that boundless,\r\nglorious country.\r\n\r\nCan you not see how two days of that kind of sport is worth all drunken\r\nyacht trips, and all the heart-breaking, dust-killing automobile rides in\r\nthe world? You feel it bodily and spiritually for years, and remember it\r\nwith pleasure all your life.\r\n\r\nSo here’s to the grand Dakotas and their hospitable people and their\r\nsplendid birds!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher reasons and says it cannot be done. The Doer tries and\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModern Cotton Culture\r\n\r\nBy E. I. WOODFIN, OF ALABAMA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no subject which is of more vital interest to the South and to\r\nthe whole world than successful cotton culture. In spite of the repeated\r\nclaims to the contrary, in which every now and then it is predicted that\r\ncertain areas in Africa, India, China and South America will be devoted\r\nto cotton, the fact remains that that strip of country lying on the map\r\nof the Southern part of the United States is the finest cotton belt in\r\nthe world, and so far absolutely the only large body of land that has\r\never produced year in and out any very great amount of the fleece. That\r\nit will continue to be the world’s field for cotton for centuries remains\r\nclearly proven, not only because of its adaptability but because upon it\r\nlive an intelligent and industrious branch of the great white race, to\r\nguide and direct and work and this race of people have the best labor in\r\nthe world to assist—the negro.\r\n\r\nIn the early days this great cotton plantation, as the South might almost\r\nbe called, suffered greatly from careless and improvident cultivation in\r\nwhich the rich soil lost much that might have been kept in it. The great\r\nthing now is to reclaim and build up and at the same time produce cotton\r\nfor the steadily increasing demand, which is more as each year goes by.\r\nWith these preliminary remarks, and the further one that I cannot better\r\nillustrate my subject than to quote my own personal experience and with\r\napology for the personal tenor of this paper, I shall give to others the\r\nbenefits of my limited success.\r\n\r\nHowever, in every profession of life, each aspirant strives for golden\r\nresults, and as I feel that my harvests for the past few years have\r\nincreased several fold, perhaps the practical farmer may benefit some one.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 I purchased my farm containing about 200 acres. At that time\r\nthe natural resources of the soil were almost completely exhausted, the\r\nproduce from one acre being about one-third of a bale when planted to\r\ncotton. I realized there was no money from so small a yield as that\r\nso determined first to try to restore the impoverished soil—the soil\r\nwhich for fifty years had been planted in cotton. The clean culture that\r\ncotton requires had exhausted the humus from the soil, and it’s almost\r\nimpossible to make any money on cotton grown on such soil. I decided\r\nthat rotation of crops was the best and cheapest way of restoring this\r\nsoil. I divided my land into four fields, fencing each field with wire.\r\nNo. 1 I used for a permanent pasture. No. 2 I planted in cotton. No. 3\r\nhalf in corn, the other half in oats, followed by peas. No. 4 I used as\r\na temporary pasture, thereby giving the soil a much needed rest. Don’t\r\nbe afraid to do this; the cattle and hogs sold from it will pay you some\r\nrent, and in the improvement of your land lies the increase of your bank\r\naccount. Having started this rotation, I have kept it up, letting cotton\r\nfollow corn and oats, corn and oats follow temporary pasture, and pasture\r\nfollowing cotton. Could you see the result you would say with me that\r\nrotation is the keynote to successful cotton culture. Occasionally a\r\nfarmer will have the seasons very favorable and make a good crop on land\r\ndeficient in humus, but what we are striving for is to make a paying crop\r\nevery year. This restoration of humus is a wonderful safeguard against\r\nexcessive wet or dry weather. Stable manure supplies this much-wanted\r\nhumus, but our supply is very limited; from the number of stock required\r\nto work this amount of land we get only enough to cover three or four\r\nacres. But we farmers have to acquire patience, anyway. Take your field\r\nthat has been planted in corn, oats and peas, as soon as the stock has\r\nfinished up what the mower left (we save all the pea vines we can for\r\nfeed). Now, turn under all stubble with a two-horse plow. If this is well\r\ndone, it will decompose before planting time, if you finished with the\r\nplowing early enough, thereby adding much humus to the soil, as well as\r\nnitrogen stored there by the pea crop. The custom is to break this land\r\nflat, but I prefer to lay mine off in beds from the first. My land is\r\nnow bedded, and it is about time to commence planting. My fertilizer\r\ndistributor is started about two days ahead of my cotton planter. The\r\nfertilizer is put in drill not over three or four inches deep, and is\r\nto be followed by a harrow. Now, get the best cotton seed. I use what I\r\nconsider the best. I won’t tell you of its many good qualities for fear\r\nyou will think this an advertisement. After the cotton has come up to\r\na good stand, start the plows to barring it off. As soon as you have\r\nfinished barring put on little sweeps and run close to the plants. This\r\nleaves them on a very narrow ridge and a good hand will chop from one to\r\none-half acres more per day than he would on a bar. Push the chopping,\r\nand follow immediately, if possible, with plows, dirting the cotton up\r\nwith sweeps. In ten days’ time, or less, if it rains, go over again with\r\nhoes, taking out every other hill and putting it to a stand. These two\r\nworkings with the hoe will cost very little more than to have put it to\r\na stand at first and the cotton will be in much better shape. Strive to\r\nplow over every ten days until you see the first open boll. Guard against\r\nplowing too wet. After rains wait until the soil crumbles. In cultivating\r\nI use a double foot with two 14-inch sweeps, going twice to the row,\r\nuntil the first of July. After that I use a 28 or 30-inch wing sweep. I\r\ngenerally go over my crop with the hoes twice after it is put to a stand.\r\nIn dry seasons once is generally sufficient. By all means keep ahead of\r\nthe grass. It will injure your cotton and cost you more in the end to\r\nclean it out. You see my advice is to rotate. Come, walk over my fields\r\nwith me and see my cotton, in places growing more than a bale per acre,\r\nwhere a few years ago the yield was about one-fourth of a bale, and you\r\nwill say with me, “Help nature, give her back her natural elements, and\r\nshe will return you a harvest of gold.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoetry, True and False\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been many definitions of poetry ranging all the way from the\r\nwell-known Englishman’s definition, “A criticism of human life,” to that\r\ngiven by one of the most original of all poets, Poe, “the rhythmical\r\ncreation of beauty.” That was merely as these two men saw it, or had the\r\npoetic principle developed in them—the first, practically; the second in\r\nall the rythmical beauty and sensuousness and indefinable mistiness of\r\nthe immortal “Raven.”\r\n\r\nIt is quite plain that no definition can be given of poetry that would\r\napply to all poetry or even to the poetic principle. No more than can be\r\ngiven a definition of love, or the sweet character of the Christ, or of\r\nGod, or of eternity. Each true poem, like the keys of a piano, may awake\r\na different chord, and every one perfect. To attempt to define the poetic\r\nprinciple would be like attempting to sound the depths of our immortal\r\nsouls, the very spirit of eternal life, a depth as varied as humanity—in\r\nsome, as deep as the valleys in the ocean’s bed, in other “ending in\r\nshallows and in miseries.” I believe it was Mendelssohn who said there\r\nwere two things mortal man should not attempt to define—“God Almighty and\r\nThorough-Base-and-Harmony.”\r\n\r\nPoetry is the music of the intellect and, therefore, like the musical\r\nprinciple, is indefinable. But what are some of its attributes?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, real poetry is true, and absolutely a part of our souls,\r\nour experience, ourselves, our most positive beliefs. At first it may\r\nnot be readily understood by us—a fact in itself which should warn us\r\nnot to be too hasty in condemning it, because that very fact may show\r\nit has touched on a higher, not a lower plane than the plane we are on,\r\nand that we must climb to it, not drag it down to us. Such is the poetry\r\nof Keats, Tennyson, Shelley and Browning. And you who say you cannot\r\nread poetry, and who have had your taste destroyed for true poetry by\r\nnewspaper jingle, which lies at one extreme, and magazine poetry, which\r\nlies at the other, and both of which are more often false than true, let\r\nme ask you before you give up, to read some of the real poetry from each\r\nof the authors above before saying again that you cannot love poetry.\r\nRead Keats’ “The Eve of St. Agnes,” Tennyson’s “The Princess,” Shelley’s\r\n“To a Skylark,” and Longfellow’s “Evangeline.” In these, as in all true\r\npoetry, though all of it may not be fully grasped at first, there is an\r\nindefinable something that touches us and makes us wish to read it again\r\nand again until, having tuned our own souls to the key of its beauty we\r\nstand elevated, instructed, sweetened, strengthened, blessed!\r\n\r\nThe true poem, like the true poet, has a mission to perform and should\r\ngo right to the heart of it—no beating around the bush, no mental\r\npyrotechnics, no flowery words to sweeten and weaken it, no “churning\r\nabout to get up a foam,” no intellectual mistiness, but the simple\r\nlaying of the hands on the eyes of the blind! For every poet is also a\r\npreacher, and the greatest of all preachers. And if it fails to perform\r\nits mission, if it does not sound its chord, and that clearly, but a\r\nmere jingling of pretty bells, it is no more a poem than a dancing harem\r\ngirl, with silver bells, bracelets and anklets on her, is a woman. Every\r\npoem that has ever lived lived because it filled a mission; and all those\r\nthat have died, died because they had none to fill. “The Psalm of Life,”\r\n“Highland Mary,” “Evelyn Hope,” “Thanatopsis”—these and hundreds of\r\nothers, short as they are, came with a mission and, finding it, performed\r\nit, and each of the above, with the lesson it teaches, is a statue in\r\nthe temple of fame and will stand there for all times as clearly and\r\ndistinctly as Washington, Bruce, Nelson or Jackson.\r\n\r\nLet us not judge poetry, then, by the two false extremes in which we meet\r\nit most often—newspapers and magazines—and the two which have caused so\r\nmany to form unfavorable opinions of poetry. Forgetting that rhyme is\r\nnot poetry, and that a poem is the product of life, the newspaper poet\r\ntries to jingle one out every day. He might as well try to live his\r\nyear in a day! Clipped by some thoughtless editor, who uses his shears\r\nas recklessly as he does his spleen, and who clips as he writes—to\r\nfill space—the newspaper poet mistakes even this for ephemeral fame\r\nand like a howling dervish continues to dance around the circle to the\r\nmonotonous music of his tom-tom; while the magazine fellow, after months\r\nof laborious travail, brings forth an intellectual mouse. Posterity\r\nwill indict the first of these for false pretenses, and hang the other\r\nfor downright murder. But like the thief and the murderer of old, the\r\npunishment of one will not bring back the good opinion of poetry to those\r\nfrom whom he has filched it, nor will the lynching of the other give back\r\nto the world the life of Art after the murderer has taken it.\r\n\r\nImagine Robert Burns, having made a reputation with his “Highland Mary,”\r\nand filled with the newspaper’s idea of his art, grinding out another\r\npoem every few days to the Scotch lassie his genius immortalized.\r\nPosterity would hate him. Think of Shelley, for ten dollars a week,\r\n“trying his hand again on the ‘Skylark.’” And yet this is what many\r\nso-called modern newspaper poets try to do.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the true poet, like the mocking bird, never sings twice\r\non the same note, but in that song he exhausts his soul. It is only the\r\njaybird who sings the same thing every day and imagines it is a new song.\r\n\r\nI do not mean by the above criticism that real genius may not now and\r\nthen appear in newspapers. In fact, more of it—much more—appears there\r\nthan in magazines, being often the bursting of a wild rose in the meadow\r\ninto full bloom and giving its perfume to the world without pay and\r\nwithout knowledge of its own sweetness. But as the wild rose cannot bloom\r\nevery day in the year, so have I never yet seen two newspaper gems in\r\none year by the same poet. And those that appear, written quickly, and\r\napparently thoughtlessly, yet are they the product of years of sweet\r\ngrowth of unconscious development, of work, imperceptibly wrought out,\r\nbut, like the coral castle beneath the sea, as perfect and as beautiful.\r\n\r\nBut as between the newspaper and the magazine poet, give me the\r\nformer—for now and then he writes a poem, but the magazine poet—seldom!\r\nThe first-named is often a true poet, and my only objection to him\r\nis that he lowers the standard of his art, he desecrates his high\r\ncalling by a too often, too feeble, and a too familiar attempt; but the\r\nmagazine poems, after years of reading them, I am constrained to believe\r\nthat, with few exceptions, they are utterly devoid of even the poetic\r\nprinciple. Their authors not only would not know a poem if they met one\r\nin the road, but they could not read one if an angel of light would write\r\nit with a diamond-pointed star on the windows of heaven!\r\n\r\nPoetry need not rhyme, it need not be written in verse, even; and the\r\nsimple test of it all is, does it awaken some chord in you that uplifts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Old Wash.\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Boss,” said Old Wash the other night, “I have got ter hol’ a zamination\r\nover in my deestrick for skule teecher, an’ I wisht you’d write out de\r\nquestions for me.”\r\n\r\nI knew that the old man was the moving spirit in educational and\r\nreligious matters in his end of the county and that he holds an\r\nexamination now and then among the colored applicants, and none of them\r\nmay teach or preach unless the old man passes on their papers.\r\n\r\nAfter much work I wrote a list of questions suitable, as I thought, for\r\nsuch an occasion and read them to the examiner.\r\n\r\n“Deys all right, boss, ’cept one thing. Jes write de answers dar, too.\r\nIt’s a po’ teecher dat ain’t got his ansers as well as his questuns. An’\r\nI’d lak for you ter go along, too, jes ter see me squelch dem smart Ike\r\nniggers dat think dey kno’s it all.”\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed there were three applicants. One was a pompous\r\nlooking darky with a knack of saying things grandly and using big words.\r\nI named him Pompey. Number two was a sanctimonious looking fellow\r\nwho knew it all. He was a newly fledged preacher. Number three was a\r\nknowing-looking, sly soon, with less book sense, but more mother wit than\r\nthe others. He looked like a slick one.\r\n\r\nNothing pleased the old man more than to show off his own learning and he\r\nquickly caught on to Pompey’s gait—going him, in fact, one better. Slowly\r\nand with great dignity he pulled out his roll of manuscript, adjusted his\r\nbig, iron-rimmed spectacles, and squelched them all in the beginning\r\nwith the flow of language:\r\n\r\n“Now, I’m gwine ax you all a few supernumerous questions, calk’lated\r\nto disembody de fundermentalerties of yore onderstandin’ an’ de\r\nposserbilerties of yore interlects for impartin’ informashun. An’ I want\r\nyou all to chirp right out as peart as jay-birds on a Friday.”\r\n\r\nThere is a negro superstition to the effect that all jay-birds go to a\r\nplace unmentionable on Friday and carry sand to his Satanic majesty. I\r\nwondered If it was a hint of what the old man had coming for them.\r\n\r\nAdjusting his glasses again, the old man said to the preacher:\r\n\r\n“Whut is jog’erfy?”\r\n\r\nThe answer came back glibly and without a flaw:\r\n\r\n“Jog’erfy is de science of de earth an’ de art of navergashun.”\r\n\r\nThis was said in such a matter of fact, positive tone that I almost\r\ncaught my breath. But I soon learned that all their answers, right or\r\nwrong, came with the same assurance and without a quiver. The old man\r\nsquinted one eye and said:\r\n\r\n“Den I s’pose you’d say a coon-dog was de science ob coon-killin’ an’ de\r\nart ob barkin’. I turns you down on dat. Nex’!”\r\n\r\n“Jog’erfy,” said Pompey, “Jog’erfy! Brer Washington, ain’t dat got\r\nsumpin’ to do sorter lak a narrer neck jinin’ two dem-johns of lan’,\r\nsorter lak an’ so forth or sumpin lak it?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, it may smell ob de jug a leetle,” said the old man, “but it don’t\r\ngine de demi-john to de extent ob pullin’ out de cork. Nex’.”\r\n\r\n“Jog’erfy,” said the Slick One, “is de art ob joggin’ and de science ob\r\ngwine round circles.”\r\n\r\nThis set the old man to thinking. He scratched his head and inspected the\r\ncandidate closely. “Ain’t you de nigger dat use ter swipe old Hal P’inter\r\nwhen he went to de races?”\r\n\r\n“Yassir.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, dat ain’t zactly right, but it’s got mo’ sense in it dan anything\r\ndat’s been sed, an’ I’ll give you ten, as you seem to have sum hoss sense\r\nin yore make-up.”\r\n\r\nFortunately I was where I could lean back behind the blackboard and save\r\nthe dignity of the examination. For all this had been said with a dignity\r\nand earnestness that was appalling, and not the slightest trace of humor\r\nappeared in their voices.\r\n\r\n“How am Tennessee bounded?” he asked Pompey.\r\n\r\n“She’s bounded by straight lines makin’ a parallellogram inclinin’ in a\r\nright angle,” said Pompey, knowingly.\r\n\r\nThe old man scratched his jaw and passed it to the Preacher. The answer\r\ncame back glibly:\r\n\r\n“Tennessee am bounded on de north by Kaintucky an’ de rory-bory Alice, on\r\nde east by de Great Smoky mountains, on the west by Mt. Pelee an’ on de\r\nsouth—”\r\n\r\nThe old man brought his fist down indignantly. “Ef we’re bounded on all\r\ndem sides by de things you say dar ain’t but one thing dat can nachully\r\nbind us on de south an’ dat am hell! You may know a whole lot about dat\r\nplace but you don’t kno’ a little bit about jog’erfy. Lemme see whut you\r\nall kno’ ’bout hist’ry.”\r\n\r\nHe slowly studied out the next question:\r\n\r\n“Relate de causes leadin’ to de Riverlushunary war.”\r\n\r\n“De circumnavigatin’ cause ob de Riverlushunary war,” said Pompey glibly,\r\n“was de extenshun ob de Equater too far into de Gulf stream, endangerin’\r\nde tail ob de British Umpire.”\r\n\r\nThe old man sadly shook his head and passed it to the Swipe.\r\n\r\n“I can’t jes zactly spress it kordin’ to book larnin’,” said the Swipe,\r\n“but it was sorter lak dis: We drawed de pole an’ axed for a squar race,\r\nbut England fouled us on de fus’ turn an’ got us in a pocket on’ de half.\r\nWe run into her, cut her down an’ won as we pleased.”\r\n\r\n“Go head,” said the old man proudly. “Hal P’inter sho’ done lamed you\r\nsumpin’.”\r\n\r\nThis put the Swipe at the head. He scratched his chin, made eyes at the\r\nothers and licked out his tongue.\r\n\r\n“Who was Maj. Andre?” slowly spelled out the old man.\r\n\r\nThe Preacher thought he was one of the Disciples and Pompey, after much\r\nthought, said he was the man who went over Niagara in a barrel. The Swipe\r\nwasn’t sure, but after a while his face lit up with a broad smile and he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Unc. Wash, wan’t he a British ringer dat got unkivered an’ ruled off at\r\nde West P’int meetin’? ’Twas a close heat an’ he lost by a neck.”\r\n\r\n“De very man,” said the old man enthusiastically. “I tell you, sonny, if\r\nyou keep up dis clip, you’ll break in all de colts in dis deestrick.”\r\nThe Swipe smiled and sat up higher in the sulky. The old man studied his\r\nmanuscript carefully and propounded:\r\n\r\n“Describe de battle ob Shiloh.”\r\n\r\n“Dat’s easy,” said the Preacher smiling. “It was a hard-fit fight in\r\nwhich Shiloh got killed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he did,” said the old man, wrathfully. “I guess de nex’ thing you’ll\r\nbe tryin’ to teach de ole man dat at de battle ob de Nelson, de Nile fell\r\noffen his hoss. Nex’, whut you say?”\r\n\r\n“Dat ar battle wus a dead heat ’twixt Gen. Grant an’ Johnsing, wan’t it,\r\nUnc. Wash?”\r\n\r\n“Sonny,” said the old man proudly, “I’m beginnin’ to think I orter resign\r\nan’ let you ax dese questions. I didn’t kno’ dar was so much hoss sense\r\nin hist’ry.”\r\n\r\n“What am de princerpal organ ob circulation?” spelled out the old man.\r\n\r\nPompey thought a long time and thought it was the liver. The Preacher\r\nthrew up his hand and a knowing smile went over his face.\r\n\r\n“What am it, den?” asked the teacher.\r\n\r\n“De hat,” shouted the candidate.\r\n\r\n“Es dat’s de fust time you’ve come nigh it I’ll give you ten on dat,”\r\nsaid the old man, “but I think de P’inter boy can do better yet.”\r\n\r\n“De princerpal organ ob circulashun,” said the Swipe, “am de little\r\nsilver cartwheel dat is stamped wid de eagle.”\r\n\r\n“Sunny,” said the old man, “you have sho’ been in de hoss bisness for\r\nsome good. Now you Preacher man, whut was de greatest trade of England?”\r\n\r\n“De trade-wind,” came back promptly.\r\n\r\n“Trade yore grandmammy’s black cat,” said the old man, wrathfully. “What\r\nwind got to do wid dis deestrick skule? You ’pear to be mighty windy\r\nyo’se’f. Nex’.”\r\n\r\n“Wan’t dat de Pennsylvania whisky resurrecshun’?” timidly asked Pompey.\r\n\r\nThe old man glared at him. The Swipe held up his hand, and when the old\r\nman nodded, he said:\r\n\r\n“De princerpal trade, Unc. Wash? ’Pears to me it was when ole Richard\r\ntried to trade his kingdom for a good hoss.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said the old man, “tain’t down zactly dat way in my book, but\r\nI’m gwine give you de certificate, fur it ’pears lak you de only nigger\r\non dat bench dat’s got enny hoss sense an’ dat’s de main thing in skule\r\nteachin.”\r\n\r\n                                                                TROTWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And Who Is My Neighbor?” Luke 10:29\r\n\r\nBy REV. T. A. WHARTON, D.D., First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, Tenn.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a Pharisee. He was also a scribe—a lawyer. And he stood up to\r\ntempt the Master. He would show this throng gathered about the Lord that\r\ntheir alleged prophet was only a cheap schemer—a designing Galilean\r\nplaying upon their ignorance and credulity.\r\n\r\n“Rabbi (patronizingly), what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” Let us\r\nreason together and come to first principles: What do you make of the\r\nprimal law? Just the old question of the Pharisee—the classic question of\r\nthe legalist in every age of the world. There is a double blunder in this\r\nage-worn question. They belong to that class of blunders which have just\r\nenough truth in their midst to give them a species of eternal life, and\r\nself perpetuative power.\r\n\r\nThe first blunder is an assumption—that in doing alone depends an\r\nentrance into the kingdom of heaven. What shall I do—what shall I do?\r\nNever what shall I be? It is so much easier to do than to be—that it is\r\nnot a thing for wonder that our poor warped human nature should prefer to\r\nbeat out a path of merit and morals to the kingdom rather than submit the\r\nwill. “Do this and live” is its password and shibboleth—never the “live\r\nand do this” of the Master.\r\n\r\n“Ye must be born again” is something alike repulsive to the pride of\r\nreason and the pride of life. And yet there is nothing more certain\r\nthan this—no one of us shall ever see the kingdom of God without such a\r\nradical birth change in our heart of hearts as shall give all our doing a\r\nnew meaning and color. Is it not a strange blunder for man to make when\r\nit appears in the very question itself? We cannot do things to inherit—we\r\nmust be sons to inherit.\r\n\r\nThe second blunder is an assumption also. It appears in the tone of the\r\nquestioner. The tone implies, Rabbi, am I not doing enough already? Am\r\nI not doing all that is necessary. I give alms of all that I possess. I\r\nfast twice in the week. My life is clean in the sight of the law—“Thank\r\nGod, I am not as other men are”—as that disciple of yours there, for\r\ninstance. What further shall I do or can I do to inherit eternal life?\r\nWhat lack I yet or the existing church of God? In so far as you are\r\nteaching anything new it must be false, and anything old is it not\r\nunnecessary? Why then all this stir you are making throughout the land?\r\n\r\nThe Master’s reply is very simple. He takes this self-sufficient sinner\r\non his own ground: “How readest thou the law?” Since this is your trust\r\nand hope, what do you make of it? The lawyer replies glibly enough: “Thou\r\nshalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul,\r\nwith all thy might and with all thy strength, and thy neighbor as thy\r\nself.” The Saviour replies: “Thou hast answered right; do this and thou\r\nshalt live.” But there is such an emphasis upon the “do” this that a\r\ndead silence falls. The lawyer grows uncomfortable, and begins to hedge.\r\nHad he this “done?” But it is evident that the less said upon the first\r\ntable of the law the better. There is more hope of the second. So says\r\nthe record: “And willing to justify himself, he asks,” “And who is my\r\nneighbor?” Do you not see that this is a broken sentence? It is preceded\r\nby a bit of very hurried thinking. I have been good to my family—to those\r\nabout me—my next of kin—my set. It all depends upon this “who is my\r\nneighbor.” “And who is my neighbor?”\r\n\r\nThe answer is only a parable, but a parable whose meaning when once\r\ncaught and practiced shall change our world beyond the recognition of\r\neven the angels of heaven. It will make this poor, weary, burdened earth\r\nto blossom as the rose; shall make all our desert like the garden of the\r\nLord. It shall become the universal solvent for all problems arising from\r\nman’s relation to man. It will stop every war before noon to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThen shall the lion of capital and the lamb of labor lie down together,\r\nand neither shall be afraid, neither shall there be any more strikes,\r\nnor walking delegates; no more epidemics of hate; no more vipers to hiss\r\ntheir slander or trail their slime. “Then shall every battle flag be\r\nfurled in the parliament of nations, the federation of the world.”\r\n\r\nWherever there lies the wounded and helpless by the wayside of life,\r\nwheresoe’er in the world there shall spring to the rescue some strong son\r\nof God armed to the teeth with wine and oil for the wound and the sword\r\nof the Lord and of Gideon for the assassin, our right worshipful dollar\r\nshall change its meaning and its face—its eagle shall have the olive\r\nbranch in its mouth. It shall become a health certificate for the sick, a\r\nhelp certificate for the needy, even though they be not our next of kin.\r\n\r\nThis parable has wrapt up in it the one remedy for the race with which to\r\nwork out its salvation from man’s inhumanity to man.\r\n\r\nOh, this is a dream, the over statement of an enthusiast’s heated fancy.\r\nIf it be so, then farewell to our hope of civilization. Its permanence\r\nwill depend upon its obedience to this, its supreme law. It is no dream.\r\nEverywhere before your very eyes is it unfolding—unfolding an asylum\r\nfor the helpless, hospitals for the sick, charitable institutions of\r\nevery type are reaching out their arms all over the world for earth’s\r\nstricken ones—its motherless and helpless. You pessimists do not believe\r\nin humanity, nor do I, but I believe in humanity’s Christ, and I know He\r\nis breathing into His own utterance the law that is to redeem the whole\r\nearth. “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”\r\n\r\nAnd who is my neighbor? We have been saying all the time with this narrow\r\nJewish lawyer, He is my fellow-Jew; he is akin to me—a man of my nation,\r\nand my neighborliness, diminishing with the square of the distance,\r\nvanishing altogether when he is out of sight.\r\n\r\nWell, I tell you, this is not the Master’s, although very similar. His\r\ndefinition has just two definite terms, and two only—a certain man, and,\r\nto die unless someone helps him. A nameless man of a nameless land,\r\nand wholly desperate. All else is indefinite—a certain man. Was he a\r\nJew? No answer. Was he stranger from the Perean hills beyond Jordan? No\r\nanswer. Was he a merchantman from the isles of the sea returning with his\r\nDamascus purchases via Jerusalem and Joppa? No answer. Was he a good man?\r\nNo answer. A man of means, or poor, with a dependent family? No answer.\r\nWas it not wrong of him to venture through so dangerous a region, and\r\nalone? No answer. Was it not foolhardy of him not to yield his goods and\r\nwithout a struggle? No answer.\r\n\r\nAll that enters into the Saviour’s definition is the fact that he was a\r\nman, a helpless, wounded man, and to die unless someone comes to him and\r\nministers to his desperate need.\r\n\r\n    “Once in the flight of ages past,\r\n      There lived a man—and who was he?\r\n    Mortal howe’er thy lot be cast,\r\n      That man resembles thee.\r\n\r\n    The bounding pulse, the languid limb,\r\n      The changing spirit’s rise and fall,\r\n    We know that these were felt by him,\r\n      For these are felt by all.\r\n\r\n    He suffered, but his pangs are o’er,\r\n      Enjoyed, but his delights are fled;\r\n    Had friends, but his friends are now no more,\r\n      And foes—his foes are dead.\r\n\r\n    He saw whate’er thou hast seen,\r\n      Encountered all that troubles thee;\r\n    He was whatever thou hast been,\r\n      He is what thou shalt be.\r\n\r\n    The annals of the human race;\r\n      Their ruins since the world began,\r\n    Of him afford no other trace than\r\n      This—there lived a man.”\r\n\r\nNow, here is the definition and the picture of our neighbor, a picture\r\nwhose lights and shadows shall never vary while the world shall last.\r\nThis is the man whom Jehovah solemnly committed to his people in every\r\nage of His church. O land of Pharisees, O scribe and lawyer, ever since\r\nthe days of Abel this man has been your charge and ward. How sayest thou,\r\nI have loved my neighbor as myself? How sayest thou, I have kept the\r\ncommandment of God, when thou has walled thyself off in national barriers\r\nand hath built walls of caste and prejudice between thyself and him? How\r\nsayest thou, I have loved my neighbor as myself, when thou hast stopped\r\nthine ears and shut thine eyes and stalked on by all those who are lying\r\nby the wayside of the Kingdom, dying through all these years of your\r\nhistory and theirs?\r\n\r\nThis is our neighbor, where are his? We have found him, where shall he\r\nfind his neighbor?

He does not\r\nbelieve that either section has all the good or all the bad, but that\r\nin both there is far more good than evil and that the only reason why\r\npeople do not like each other is because they do not know each other.\r\nTransportation, the cable, the telegraph, wireless telegraphy and the\r\ntelephone have changed the face of the world and corralled mankind with\r\nwires of steel. Japan is nearer Washington to-day than Boston was fifty\r\nyears ago. You have more neighbors in Europe than your grandfather had\r\nin the county adjoining him. I am publishing this letter hoping my blind\r\nfriend may find the kind surgeon, and also to show the spirit of our\r\nreunited country for which my pen has always and will ever work to cement:\r\n\r\n                                      Merrill, Wis., June 30, 1905.\r\n\r\n    Dear Trotwood: Rather tardy in thanking you for taking the\r\n    trouble of sending me “Songs and Stories of Tennessee,” but my\r\n    wife and daughter have been away on a visit and though it’s\r\n    vacation, this is the first opportunity I’ve had to press my\r\n    sister into service. We all enjoyed the stories very much, and\r\n    are looking forward eagerly to the time when your new book will\r\n    be out.\r\n\r\n    I’ve been wanting to tell you of my father’s experience during\r\n    the Civil War, to see what you think of it, and to see if you\r\n    have any idea who the surgeon could have been and to show you\r\n    another family in the North with the kindliest of feelings for\r\n    the people of the South.\r\n\r\n    July 1, ’63, at about 2 o’clock p.m., a Confederate bullet laid\r\n    my father low at the Battle of Gettysburg. The ball passed\r\n    through and killed the man directly in front of him, entering\r\n    father below the heart, the wound being very similar to that\r\n    of President Garfield. He still carries the lead. He lay the\r\n    afternoon until along in the evening the Union line having\r\n    retreated, and firing ceased. About this time Gen. Lee and his\r\n    staff came on the field. The general, seeing father was alive,\r\n    asked what troops he had fought and how boys happened to get\r\n    commissions in the Northern Army. Father answered, “They fought\r\n    and earned them.” As the party passed on, the surgeon returned,\r\n    eased father’s position, gave him a drink of liquor and said he\r\n    would see him later. He came again at about nine o’clock that\r\n    night, twice the next day and late the afternoon of July 2 he\r\n    had two Confederate soldiers prepare a litter and carry father\r\n    to a farm house where, being the most dangerously wounded, he\r\n    was given the only mattress in the house. Father calls him his\r\n    “Good Samaritan.” During his time on the field his hat cord was\r\n    stolen and he gave all the money he had, twenty dollars, ten\r\n    each to two Union soldiers to get him off the field or get him\r\n    something to drink. They never returned. During the night a\r\n    Confederate soldier gave him a drink of milk for which he had\r\n    spent his last cent. This is in brief, but explicit enough to\r\n    show that though father was struck down by a Confederate bullet\r\n    he nevertheless owes his life to men of that army. When the\r\n    Confederate line retreated, father was taken to the hospital\r\n    in the city and was never able to learn the name of his “Good\r\n    Samaritan.” How his wound did not heal for two years, how Dr.\r\n    Bliss treated him and how an abscess formed in his back which\r\n    also took a long time to heal is probably but a repetition of\r\n    many such incidents of which you’ve already heard.\r\n\r\n    For fear you’ll grow weary, I’ll desist.\r\n\r\n                         Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                       H. R. BRUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is time that the flamboyant and flowery, the unreal, was cut out of\r\nour oratory and literature. Kill it. Talk straight, think straight,\r\nlive straight. The flamboyant, the flowery is the product of slavery,\r\nof idleness, of high living and no thinking. It is a relic of the past,\r\nof feudalism, a mixture of chivalry and unclear thinking. The great\r\npoet, the great writer, the great orator is he who talks the greatest\r\ngood sense. Anything else is the badge of mediocrity. The tendency of\r\neverything these strenuous days, from literature to life insurance,\r\nis expressed in the phrase: “Get there.” How amusing the efforts of a\r\nTennessee statesman in a recent great occasion, majestically sweeping\r\nthe heavens with his hands and solemnly proclaiming that “Tennessee had\r\nset more stars in the galaxy of glory than all the other States.” Bosh!\r\nTennessee has as many fools to the acre as any other State, and what she\r\nshould do just now is to set more hens and fewer stars!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeople who live with nature soon learn a great deal. The best way to\r\nstudy nature is to get in harmony with the laws of nature. The best\r\nadvice ever given on longevity was from the cheerful old gentleman who\r\nsaid: “To live long, live naturally, eat what you want and walk on the\r\nsunny side of the street.” Children think that some great man made up the\r\nhorrid rules of grammar, and then all the world learned them and went to\r\ntalking. They do not know that the world talked first and the rules of\r\ngrammar were deduced from the talking. From the facts of life we draw our\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nAnd Nature is the Great Fact.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of one of her facts the other day—she has so many\r\nthousands—but I noticed it is a fact that the man who works the soil is a\r\nnatural-born optimist. Let the farmer fail year after year and he still\r\nplants, hoping. Let the merchant fail one year and he is badly shaken—one\r\nmore—another, maybe—and he is done. That is the Fact. Now for the rule:\r\nGod intended man to love, to cultivate, to cling to the soil. In other\r\nwords, is not farming man’s natural vocation, since neither drought nor\r\nflood nor failure can shut out from his heart that instinct of hoping\r\nwhich has come down to him through centuries of farming fathers?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe—and that means England and America—have used the Jap to fight our\r\nbattles for us. The issue has been the stopping of the tide of Moscovites\r\nacross Asia, the killing of their influence in the East, the grasping\r\nfrom covetous hands the yellow empire, richer than mints of yellow gold\r\nto the nation that shall supply their wants. That means the open door\r\nuntil Japan decides to close it for the world and that the Muscovite must\r\nforever be bound between the Baltic and the North Sea and the ice zone\r\nof the Pacific, all of which was necessary. Arrogant and ignorant Russia\r\nneeded this chastisement. But is it not time to stop? We are chuckling\r\nnow, but the greatest problem lies before us. Sixteenth century Russia\r\nhas met twentieth century Japan, and walked from the woods of barbarity\r\ninto the daylight of a Mauser-swept, mine-entangled, smokeless-plowed\r\nfield of death. The harvest has been as certain as when the Gauls came\r\nout of the woods to meet the steel-sheathed legions of Caesar.\r\n\r\nHistory does not stop at one page. One was made at Port Arthur and the\r\nStraits of Japan, now—\r\n\r\n“Let China alone,” said Napoleon, “she is a sleeping giant.” The\r\nfight has been for China, and the wily Jap, playing on the unfailing\r\ncupidity and conquering, grabbing instinct of the Anglo-Saxon, has won.\r\nHereafter China belongs to Japan. Give her just a century to vitalize\r\nthe nation which, if the world were stood in a line, would count every\r\nfourth fighter as hers, and the white race will face the problem of its\r\nexistence. At Portsmouth recently, when the Sabbath came, the Russian\r\nwent to church. The Jap only laughed, and voted to work on. Shintoism\r\nknows no Sunday, no soul, no to-morrow, no eternity. Shintoism is blind\r\nchance pitched against the barb-wire of blind unbelief.\r\n\r\nIt is time to see clearly—to turn. We have conquered our own kin with a\r\nsoulless, smiling, ghost-born being who is far-sighted and will yet make\r\nour children wonder why we gave him a Mauser for posterity. As for us, we\r\nwill always be for the white man and the Christian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrotwood’s Monthly has installed a new feature in magazine management. We\r\ncall him Jonah. He is a bright boy who does things around the editorial\r\nroom. They are not always done right, but when he finishes with them we\r\nare willing to aver that they are always done. One of his duties is to\r\nread all of the poetry submitted—and it is coming in with a rush—condemn\r\nthe bad and pass the good up to Trotwood for final judgment. Here are his\r\ncomments on an execrable batch of it sent in under the title of “Piping\r\nLays” by a good, sweet, but sadly misguided being, whose name begins\r\nwith Tillie:\r\n\r\n    Hear we hav a poet boald.\r\n      Naught I’m frank to sa is worce,\r\n    Than the “Flowery” tales she’s told,\r\n      In her akrobatic verce.\r\n\r\n    Tillie fane would pipe a lay\r\n      That would markit fur a song,\r\n    But her Piping duz not pa,\r\n      Why?

They sent one sheet back to-day and i red it\r\n    and it reeds like this—“The Hal family is a very slow bunch,\r\n    and unless they cross the blood with a Texas Mustang pretty\r\n    soon, they will only be fit for water wagons and apple carts,\r\n    and anny boddy would go to sleep waiting for them to go around\r\n    a half mile track.”\r\n\r\n    I draped it on the floor, and when I picked it up it was\r\n    different, and red like this—(I had it up-side-down):\r\n\r\n        Life’s ills, could man by knowing,\r\n        Be spared from undergoing,\r\n        There would be sense in knowing;\r\n        But since with all our knowing,\r\n        This coal dust keeps on blowing,\r\n        Well—what’s the use in knowing?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sweetland the business manager said I was a fool, but when\r\n    he tried to reed it, he could not tell whuther it was a horse\r\n    story or poem or something about Uncle Wash. He said it was one\r\n    of the three, and said you wrote like a lobster. it is plain\r\n    enough to me, but i wish you would write and tell me just what\r\n    it is, and I will tell the printer for he is too fresh anyhow.\r\n    Hear is whut I mad of it last:\r\n\r\n        When you give a sweet maid kisses\r\n          She hands you back a sigh—\r\n        When you give a printer copy\r\n          He hands you back a pi—\r\n        And he made it in the gloaming\r\n          With his stomach full of rye!\r\n\r\n    noto bene:—Pleas com up and let us no which one goes. And pleas\r\n    pardon a suggestion but I saw to-day a thing that wurred me\r\n    verry grately. it was that the buggs insex and varments eats\r\n    up Three Billion Dollars worth of the farmers truck and stuff\r\n    every year. Don’t you think we ought to let them no about it.\r\n\r\n                                                             JONAH.\r\n\r\nThe following compliment from an old friend, Judge John L. Miller, of\r\nCorsicana, Texas, is highly appreciated. When we say “old” friend it\r\ncarries a double meaning, for in addition to having been our friend for\r\nmany years, this grand old gentleman has nearly reached his ninetieth\r\nmilestone, and is still enjoying good health. He writes:\r\n\r\n    When I learned that TROTWOOD was to edit TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY\r\n    I folded my arms and shouted for joy, I knew the author of\r\n    “Ole Mistis” and “Miss Kitty’s Funeral,” two of the brightest\r\n    literary gems of modern times, could and would give us a\r\n    monthly that would be read and appreciated by all reading\r\n    people in both North and South. This is the character of\r\n    reading matter the whole country needs, and judging from the\r\n    first number of TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY I think we will get it. The\r\n    visitor from Tennessee is gladly welcomed, bringing as it does\r\n    into our home good cheer and sunshine—short gems of poetry,\r\n    making “Tears from eyelids start,” then smiles and ringing\r\n    laughter.\r\n\r\n    With Little Sister, we grieve over the condemned long-legged\r\n    colt. We help her to rescue the little deformed thing from the\r\n    hands of the negro executioner. We shout and sing and dance\r\n    and “’Rah for Little Sister” at the race course as she swings\r\n    proudly into the ring and wins the race.\r\n\r\n    Right gladly we renew our acquaintance with “Old Wash” and our\r\n    sympathies are his as he attempts with his luscious watermelons\r\n    to reach the hearts of his people through their stomachs, and\r\n    also defeats his own purpose through their stomachs.\r\n\r\n    A “History of the Hals” appeals strongly to lovers of fine\r\n    horses. Many horses of the Hal family are owned by Texans and\r\n    the articles on this especial subject will be read with avidity\r\n    by subscribers over this state as well as elsewhere. A bright\r\n    magazine enjoyed alike by every member of the household we find\r\n    TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY to be, and “Barkis is more than willin’”\r\n    that it should be the success it so well deserves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe want a good live agent in every town in the United States for\r\n“Trotwood’s Monthly.” Write for terms to agents.
