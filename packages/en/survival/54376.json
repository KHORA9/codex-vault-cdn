My purpose in the present work,\r\nas in my “Light Science for Leisure Hours,” the “Myths and Marvels of\r\nAstronomy,” the “Borderland of Science,” and “Science Byways,” has been\r\nto provide paths of easy access to the knowledge of some of the more\r\ninteresting discoveries, researches, or inquiries of the science of\r\nthe day. I wish it to be distinctly understood that my purpose is to\r\ninterest rather than to instruct, in the strict sense of the word. But\r\nI may add that it seems to me even more necessary to be cautious, and\r\naccurate in such a work as the present than in advanced treatises. For\r\nin a scientific work the reasoning which accompanies the statements\r\nof fact affords the means of testing and sometimes of correcting\r\nsuch statements. In a work like the present, where explanation and\r\ndescription take the place of reasoning, there is no such check. For\r\nthis reason I have been very careful in the accounts which I have given\r\nof the subjects here dealt with. I have been particularly careful not\r\nto present, as established truths, such views as are at present only\r\nmatters of opinion.\r\n\r\nThe essays in the present volume are taken chiefly from the\r\n_Contemporary Review_, the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, the _Cornhill\r\nMagazine_, _Belgravia_, and _Chambers’ Journal_. The sixth, however,\r\npresents the substance (and official report) of a lecture which I\r\ndelivered at the Royal Institution in May, 1870. It was then that I\r\nfirst publicly enunciated the views respecting the stellar universe\r\nwhich I afterwards more fully stated in my “Universe of Stars.” The\r\nsame views have also been submitted to the Paris Academy of Science, as\r\nthe results of his own investigations, by M. Flammarion, in words which\r\nread almost like translations of passages in the above-mentioned essay.\r\n\r\n  RICHARD A. PROCTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASANT WAYS IN SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_OXYGEN IN THE SUN._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most promising result of solar research since Kirchhoff in 1859\r\ninterpreted the dark lines of the sun’s spectrum has recently been\r\nannounced from America. Interesting in itself, the discovery just made\r\nis doubly interesting in what it seems to promise in the future. Just\r\nas Kirchhoff’s great discovery, that a certain double dark line in the\r\nsolar spectrum is due to the vapour of sodium in the sun’s atmosphere,\r\nwas but the first of a long series of results which the spectroscopic\r\nanalysis of the sun was to reveal, so the discovery just announced that\r\na certain important gas—the oxygen present in our air and the chief\r\nchemical constituent of water—shows its presence in the sun by bright\r\nlines instead of dark, will in all probability turn out to be but the\r\nfirstfruits of a new method of examining the solar spectrum. As its\r\nauthor, Dr. Henry Draper, of New York, remarks, further investigation\r\nin the direction he has pursued will lead to the discovery of other\r\nelements in the sun, but it was not “proper to conceal, for the sake\r\nof personal advantage, the principle on which such researches are to\r\nbe conducted.” It may well happen, though I anticipate otherwise, that\r\nby thus at once describing his method of observation, Dr. Draper may\r\nenable others to add to the list of known solar elements some which\r\nyet remain to be detected; but if Dr. Draper should thus have added but\r\none element to that list, he will ever be regarded as the physicist\r\nto whose acumen the method was due by which all were detected, and to\r\nwhom, therefore, the chief credit of their discovery must certainly be\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\nI propose briefly to consider the circumstances which preceded the\r\ngreat discovery which it is now my pleasing duty to describe, in order\r\nthat the reader may the more readily follow the remarks by which I\r\nshall endeavour to indicate some of the results which seem to follow\r\nfrom the discovery, as well as the line along which, in my opinion, the\r\nnew method may most hopefully be followed.\r\n\r\nIt is generally known that what is called the spectroscopic method\r\nof analyzing the sun’s substance had its origin in Kirchhoff’s\r\ninterpretation of the dark lines in the solar spectrum. Until\r\n1859 these dark lines had not been supposed to have any special\r\nsignificance, or rather it had not been supposed that their\r\nsignificance, whatever it might be, could be interpreted. A physicist\r\nof some eminence spoke of these phenomena in 1858 in a tone which ought\r\nby the way seldom to be adopted by the man of science. “The phenomena\r\ndefy, as we have seen,” he said, “all attempts hitherto to reduce them\r\nwithin empirical laws, and no complete explanation or theory of them is\r\npossible. All that theory can be expected to do is this—it may explain\r\nhow dark lines of any sort may arise within the spectrum.” Kirchhoff,\r\nin 1859, showed not only how dark lines of any sort may appear, but how\r\nand why they do appear, and precisely what they mean. He found that\r\nthe dark lines of the solar spectrum are due to the vapours of various\r\nelements in the sun’s atmosphere, and that the nature of such elements\r\nmay be determined from the observed position of the dark lines. Thus\r\nwhen iron is raised by the passage of the electric spark to so intense\r\na degree of heat that it is vaporized, the light of the glowing\r\nvapour of iron is found to give a multitude of bright lines along the\r\nwhole length of the spectrum—that is, some red, some orange, some\r\nyellow, and so on. In the solar spectrum corresponding dark lines are\r\nfound along the whole length of the spectrum—that is, some in the\r\nred, some in the orange, yellow, etc., and precisely in those parts\r\nof these various spectral regions which the bright lines of glowing\r\niron would occupy. Multitudes of other dark lines exist of course in\r\nthe solar spectrum. But those corresponding to the bright lines of\r\nglowing iron are unquestionably there. They are by no means lost in\r\nthe multitude, as might be expected; but, owing to the peculiarity of\r\ntheir arrangement, strength, etc., they are perfectly recognizable as\r\nthe iron lines reversed, that is, dark instead of bright. Kirchhoff’s\r\nresearches showed how this is to be interpreted. It means that the\r\nvapour of iron exists in the atmosphere of the sun, glowing necessarily\r\nwith an intensely bright light; _but_, being cooler (however intensely\r\nhot) than the general mass of the sun within, the iron vapour absorbs\r\nmore light than it emits, and the result is that the iron lines,\r\ninstead of appearing bright, as they would if the iron vapour alone\r\nwere shining, appear relatively dark on the bright rainbow-tinted\r\nbackground of the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\nThus was it shown that in the atmosphere of the sun there is the\r\nglowing vapour of the familiar metal, iron; and in like manner other\r\nmetals, and one element (hydrogen) which is not ordinarily regarded as\r\na metal, were shown to be present in the sun’s atmosphere. In saying\r\nthat they are present in the sun’s atmosphere, I am, in point of fact,\r\nsaying that they are present in the sun; for the solar atmosphere is,\r\nin fact, the outer part of the sun himself, since a very large part,\r\nif not by far the greater part, of the sun’s mass must be vaporous.\r\nBut no other elements, except the metals iron, sodium, barium,\r\ncalcium, magnesium, aluminium, manganese, chromium, cobalt, nickel,\r\nzinc, copper, and titanium, and the element hydrogen, were shown\r\nto be present in the sun, by this method of observing directly the\r\nsolar dark lines. In passing, I may note that there are reasons for\r\nregarding hydrogen as a metallic element, strange though the idea may\r\nseem to those who regard hardness, brightness, malleability, ductility,\r\nplasticity, and the like, as the characteristic properties of metals,\r\nand necessarily fail to comprehend how a gas far rarer, under the\r\nsame conditions, than the air we breathe, and which cannot possibly\r\nbe malleable, ductile, or the like, can conceivably be regarded as a\r\nmetal. But there is in reality no necessary connection between any one\r\nof the above properties and the metallic nature; many of the fifty-five\r\nmetals are wanting in all of these properties; nor is there any reason\r\nwhy, as we have in mercury a metal which at ordinary temperatures is a\r\nliquid, so we might have in hydrogen a metal which, at all obtainable\r\ntemperatures, and under all obtainable conditions of pressure, is\r\ngaseous. It was shown by the late Professor Graham (aided in his\r\nresearches most effectively by Dr. Chandler Roberts) that hydrogen will\r\nenter into such combination with the metal palladium that it may be\r\nregarded as forming, for the time, with the palladium, an alloy; and\r\nas alloys can only be regarded as compounds of two or more metals, the\r\ninference is that hydrogen is in reality a metallic element.\r\n\r\nFourteen only of the elements known to us, or less than a quarter\r\nof the total number, were thus found to be present in the sun’s\r\nconstitution; and of these all were metals, if we regard hydrogen as\r\nmetallic. Neither gold nor silver shows any trace of its presence,\r\nnor can any sign be seen of platinum, lead, and mercury. But, most\r\nremarkable of all, and most perplexing, was the absence of all trace\r\nof oxygen and nitrogen, two gases which could not be supposed wanting\r\nin the substance of the great ruling centre of the planetary system.\r\nIt might well be believed, indeed, that none of the five metals just\r\nnamed are absent from the sun, and indeed that every one of the\r\nforty metals not recognized by the spectroscopic method nevertheless\r\nexists in the sun. For according to the nebular hypothesis of the\r\norigin of our solar system, the sun might be expected to contain all\r\nthe elements which exist in our earth. Some of these elements might\r\nindeed escape discovery, because existing only in small quantities;\r\nand others (as platinum, gold, and lead, for example), because but a\r\nsmall portion of their vaporous substance rose above the level of that\r\nglowing surface which is called the photosphere. But that oxygen, which\r\nconstitutes so large a portion of the solid, liquid, and vaporous mass\r\nof our earth, should not exist in enormous quantities, and its presence\r\nbe very readily discernable, seemed amazing indeed. Nitrogen, also,\r\nmight well be expected to be recognizable in the sun. Carbon, again,\r\nis so important a constituent of the earth, that we should expect to\r\ndiscover clear traces of its existence in the sun. In less degree,\r\nsimilar considerations apply to sulphur, boron, silicon, and the other\r\nnon-metallic elements.\r\n\r\nIt was not supposed, however, by any one at all competent to form an\r\nopinion on the subject, that oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon are absent\r\nfrom the sun. It was perceived that an element might exist in enormous\r\nquantities in the substance of the sun, and yet fail to give any\r\nevidence of its presence, or only give such evidence as might readily\r\nescape recognition. If we remember how the dark lines are really\r\ncaused, we shall perceive that this is so. A glowing vapour in the\r\natmosphere of the sun absorbs rays of the same colour as it emits. If\r\nthen, it is cooler than the glowing mass of the sun which it enwraps,\r\nand if, notwithstanding the heat received from this mass, it remains\r\ncooler, then it suffers none of those rays to pass earthwards.[1] It\r\nemits rays of the same kind (that is, of the same _colour_) itself,\r\nbut, being cooler, the rays thus coming from it are feebler; or, to\r\nspeak more correctly, the ethereal waves thus originated are feebler\r\nthan those of the same order which _would_ have travelled earthwards\r\nfrom the sun but for the interposed screen of vapour. Hence the\r\ncorresponding parts of the solar spectrum are less brilliant, and\r\ncontrasted with the rainbow-tinted streak of light, on which they lie\r\nas on a background, they appear dark.\r\n\r\nIn order, then, that any element may be detected by its dark lines, it\r\nis necessary that it should lie as a vaporous screen between the more\r\nintensely heated mass of the sun and the eye of the observer on earth.\r\nIt must then form an enclosing envelope cooler than the sun within it.\r\nOr rather, some part of the vapour must be thus situated. For enormous\r\nmasses of the vapour might be within the photospheric surface of the\r\nsun at a much higher temperature, which yet, being enclosed in the\r\ncooler vaporous shell of the same substance, would not be able to send\r\nits light rays earthwards. One may compare the state of things, so\r\nfar as that particular element is concerned, to what is presented in\r\nthe case of a metallic globe cooled on the outside but intensely hot\r\nwithin. The cool outside of such a globe is what determines the light\r\nand heat received from it, so long as the more heated mass within has\r\nnot yet (by conduction) warmed the exterior shell. So in the case of\r\na vapour permeating the entire mass, perhaps, of the sun, and at as\r\nhigh a temperature as the sun everywhere except on the outside: it is\r\nthe temperature of the outermost part of such a vaporous mass which\r\ndetermines the intensity of the rays received from it—or in other\r\nwords, determines whether the corresponding parts of the spectrum shall\r\nbe darker or not than the rest of the spectrum. If the vapour does\r\nnot rise above the photosphere of the sun in sufficient quantity to\r\nexercise a recognizable absorptive effect, its presence in the sun will\r\nnot be indicated by any dark lines.\r\n\r\nI dwell here on the question of quantity, which is sometimes overlooked\r\nin considering the spectroscopic evidence of the sun’s condition, but\r\nis in reality a very important factor in determining the nature of the\r\nevidence relating to each element in the solar mass. In some cases,\r\nthe quantity of a material necessary to give unmistakable spectroscopic\r\nevidence is singularly small; insomuch that new elements, as thallium,\r\ncæsium, rubidium, and gallium, have been actually first recognized\r\nby their spectral lines when existing in such minute quantities in\r\nthe substances examined as to give no other trace whatever of their\r\nexistence. But it would be altogether a mistake to suppose that some\r\nelement existing in exceedingly small quantities, or, more correctly,\r\nexisting in the form of an exceedingly rare vapour in the sun’s\r\natmosphere, would be detected by means of its dark lines, or _by any\r\nother method depending on the study of the solar spectrum_. When we\r\nplace a small portion of some substance in the space between the carbon\r\npoints of an electric lamp, and volatilize that substance in the\r\nvoltaic arc, we obtain a spectrum including all the bright lines of the\r\nvarious elements contained in the substance; and if some element is\r\ncontained in it in exceedingly small quantity, we may yet perceive its\r\ndistinctive bright lines among the others (many of them far brighter)\r\nbelonging to the elements present in greater quantities. But if we have\r\n(for example) a great mass of molten iron, the rainbow-tinted spectrum\r\nof whose light we examine from a great distance, and if a small\r\nquantity of sodium, or other substance which vaporizes at moderate\r\ntemperatures, be cast into the molten iron so that the vapour of the\r\nadded element presently rises above the glowing surface of the iron,\r\nno trace of the presence of this vapour would be shown in the spectrum\r\nobserved from a distance. The part of the spectrum where the dark lines\r\nof sodium usually appear would, undoubtedly, be less brilliant than\r\nbefore, in the same sense that the sun may be said to be less brilliant\r\nwhen the air is in the least degree moist than when it is perfectly\r\ndry; but the loss of brilliancy is as utterly imperceptible in the one\r\ncase as it is in the other. In like manner, a vapour might exist in\r\nthe atmosphere of the sun (above the photosphere, that is), of whose\r\npresence not a trace would be afforded in the spectroscope, for the\r\nsimple reason that the absorptive action of the vapour, though exerted\r\nto reduce the brightness of particular solar rays or tints, would not\r\naffect those rays sufficiently for the spectroscopist to recognize any\r\ndiminution of their lustre.\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration, which, so far as I know, has not\r\nhitherto received much attention, but should certainly be taken into\r\naccount in the attempt to interpret the real meaning of the solar\r\nspectrum. Some of the metals which are vaporized by the sun’s heat\r\nbelow the photosphere may become liquid or even solid at or near the\r\nlevel of the photosphere. Even though the heat at the level of the\r\nphotosphere may be such that, under ordinary conditions of pressure and\r\nso forth, such metals would be vaporous, the enormous pressure which\r\nmust exist not far below the level of the photosphere may make the\r\nheat necessary for complete vaporization far greater than the actual\r\nheat at that level. In that case the vapour will in part condense into\r\nliquid globules, or, if the heat is considerably less than is necessary\r\nto keep the substance in the form of vapour, then it may in part be\r\nsolidified, the tiny globules of liquid metal becoming tiny crystals\r\nof solid metal. We see both conditions fulfilled within the limits of\r\nour own air in the case of the vapour of water. Low down the water\r\nis present in the air (ordinarily) in the form of pure vapour; at a\r\nhigher level the vapour is condensed by cold into liquid drops forming\r\nvisible clouds (cumulus clouds), and yet higher, where the cold is\r\nstill greater, the minute water-drops turn into ice-crystals, forming\r\nthose light fleecy clouds called cirrus clouds by the meteorologist.\r\nNow true clouds of either sort may exist in the solar atmosphere even\r\nabove that photospheric level which forms the boundary of the sun we\r\nsee. It may be said that the spectroscope, applied to examine matter\r\noutside the photosphere, has given evidence only of vaporous cloud\r\nmasses. The ruddy prominences which tower tens of thousands of miles\r\nabove the surface of the sun, and the sierra (or as it is sometimes\r\nunclassically called, the chromosphere) which covers usually the\r\nwhole of the photosphere to a depth of about eight thousand miles,\r\nshow only, under spectroscopic scrutiny, the bright lines indicating\r\ngaseity. But though this is perfectly true, it is also true that we\r\nhave not here a particle of evidence to show that clouds of liquid\r\nparticles, and of tiny crystals, may not float over the sun’s surface,\r\nor even that the ruddy clouds shown by the spectroscope to shine with\r\nlight indicative of gaseity may not also contain liquid and crystalline\r\nparticles. For in point of fact, the very principle on which our\r\nrecognition of the bright lines depends involves the inference that\r\nmatter whose light would _not_ be resolved into bright lines would\r\nnot be recognizable at all. The bright lines are seen, because by\r\nmeans of a spectroscope we can throw them far apart, without reducing\r\ntheir lustre, while the background of rainbow-tinted spectrum has its\r\nvarious portions similarly thrown further apart and correspondingly\r\nweakened. One may compare the process (the comparison, I believe, has\r\nnot hitherto been employed) to the dilution of a dense liquid in which\r\nsolid masses have been floating: the more we increase the quantity of\r\nthe liquid in diluting it with water, the more transparent it becomes,\r\nbut the solid masses in it are not changed, so that we only have to\r\ndilute the liquid sufficiently to see these masses. _But_ if there were\r\nin the interstices of the solid masses particles of some substance\r\nwhich dissolved in the water, we should not recognize the presence of\r\nthis substance by any increase in its visibility; for the very same\r\nprocess which thinned the liquid would thin this soluble substance in\r\nthe same degree. In like manner, by dispersing and correspondingly\r\nweakening the sun’s light more and more, we can recognize the light of\r\nthe gaseous matter in the prominences, for this is not weakened; but if\r\nthe prominences also contain matter in the solid or liquid form (that\r\nis, drops or crystals), the spectroscopic method will not indicate the\r\npresence of such matter, for the spectrum of matter of this sort will\r\nbe weakened by dispersion in precisely the same degree that the solar\r\nspectrum itself is weakened.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how the evidence of the presence of any element\r\nwhich behaved in this way would be weakened, if we consider what would\r\nhappen in the case of our own earth, according as the air were simply\r\nmoist but without clouds, or loaded with cumulus masses but without\r\ncirrus clouds, or loaded with cirrus clouds. For although there is not\r\nin the case of the earth a central glowing mass like the sun’s, on\r\nwhose rainbow-tinted spectrum the dark lines caused by the absorptive\r\naction of our atmosphere could be seen by the inhabitant of some\r\ndistant planet studying the earth from without, yet the sun’s light\r\nreflected from the surface of the earth plays in reality a similar\r\npart. It does not give a simple rainbow-tinted spectrum; for, being\r\nsunlight, it shows all the dark lines of the solar spectrum: but the\r\naddition of new dark lines to these, in consequence of the absorptive\r\naction of the earth’s atmosphere, could very readily be determined. In\r\nfact, we do thus recognize in the spectra of Mars, Venus, and other\r\nplanets, the presence of aqueous vapour in their atmosphere, despite\r\nthe fact that our own air, containing also aqueous vapour, naturally\r\nrenders so much the more difficult the detection of that vapour in the\r\natmosphere of remote planets necessarily seen through our own air.\r\nNow, a distant observer examining the light of our own earth on a day\r\nwhen, though the air was moist, there were no clouds, would have ample\r\nevidence of the presence of the vapour of water; for the light which he\r\nexamined would have gone twice through our earth’s atmosphere, from its\r\noutermost thinnest parts to the densest layers close to the surface,\r\nthen back again through the entire thickness of the air. But if the\r\nair were heavily laden with cumulus clouds (without any cirrus clouds\r\nat a higher layer), although _we_ should know that there was abundant\r\nmoisture in the air, and indeed much more moisture then there had been\r\nwhen there had been no clouds, our imagined observer would either\r\nperceive no traces at all of this moisture, or he would perceive traces\r\nso much fainter than when the air was clear that he would be apt to\r\ninfer that the air was either quite dry, or at least very much drier\r\nthan it had been in that case. For the light which he would receive\r\nfrom the earth would not in this case have passed through the entire\r\ndepth of moisture-laden air twice, but twice only through that portion\r\nof the air which lay above the clouds, at whose surface the sun’s light\r\nwould be reflected. The whole of the moisture-laden layer of the air\r\nwould be snugly concealed under the cloud-layer, and would exercise\r\nno absorptive action whatever on the light which the remote observer\r\nwould examine. If from the upper surface of the layer of cumulus clouds\r\naqueous vapour rose still higher, and were converted in the cold upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere into clouds of ice-crystals, the distant\r\nobserver would have still less chance of recognizing the presence of\r\nmoisture in our atmosphere. For the layer of air between the cumulus\r\nclouds and the cirrus clouds would be unable to exert any absorptive\r\naction on the light which reached the observer. All such light would\r\ncome to him after reflection from the layer of cirrus clouds. He would\r\nbe apt to infer that there was no moisture at all in the air of our\r\nplanet, at the very time when in fact there was so much moisture that\r\nnot one layer only, but two layers of clouds enveloped the earth, the\r\ninnermost layer consisting of particles of liquid water, the outermost\r\nof particles of frozen water. Using the words ice, water, and steam,\r\nto represent the solid, liquid, and vaporous states of water, we may\r\nfairly say that ice and water, by hiding steam, would persuade the\r\nremote observer that there was no water at all on the earth—at least\r\nif he trusted solely to the spectroscopic evidence then obtained.[2]\r\n\r\nWe might in like manner fail to obtain any spectroscopic evidence of\r\nthe presence of particular elements in the sun, because they do not\r\nexist in sufficient quantity in the vaporous form in those outer layers\r\nwhich the spectroscope can alone deal with.\r\n\r\nIn passing, I must note a circumstance in which some of those who have\r\ndealt with this special part of the spectroscopic evidence have erred.\r\nIt is true in one sense that some elements may be of such a nature that\r\ntheir vapours cannot rise so high in the solar atmosphere as those of\r\nother elements. But it must not be supposed that the denser vapours\r\nseek a lower level, the lighter vapours rising higher. According to\r\nthe known laws of gaseous diffusion, a gas or vapour diffuses itself\r\nthroughout a space occupied by another gas or several other gases,\r\nin the same way as though the space were not occupied at all. If we\r\nintroduce into a vessel full of common air a quantity of carbonic\r\nacid gas (I follow the older and more familiar nomenclature), this\r\ngas, although of much higher specific gravity than either oxygen or\r\nnitrogen, does not take its place at the bottom of the vessel, but so\r\ndiffuses itself that the air of the upper part of the vessel contains\r\nexactly the same quantity of carbonic acid gas as the air of the\r\nlower part. Similarly, if hydrogen is introduced, it does not seek\r\nthe upper part of the vessel, but diffuses itself uniformly throughout\r\nthe vessel. If we enclose the carbonic acid gas in a light silken\r\ncovering, and the hydrogen in another (at the same pressure as the air\r\nin the vessel) one little balloon will sink and the other will rise;\r\nbut this is simply because diffusion is prevented. It may be asked\r\nhow this agrees with what I have said above, that some elements may\r\nnot exist in sufficient quantity or in suitable condition above the\r\nsun’s photospheric level to give any spectroscope evidence of their\r\nnature. As to quantity, indeed, the answer is obvious: if there is only\r\na small quantity of any given element in the entire mass of the sun,\r\nonly a very small quantity can under any circumstances exist outside\r\nthe photosphere. As regards condition, it must be remembered that the\r\nvessel of my illustrative case was supposed to contain air at a given\r\ntemperature and pressure throughout. If the vessel was so large that\r\nin different parts of it the temperature and pressure were different,\r\nthe diffusion would, indeed, still be perfect, because at all ordinary\r\ntemperatures and pressures hydrogen and carbonic acid gas remain\r\ngaseous. But if the vapour introduced is of such a nature that at\r\nmoderate temperatures and pressures it condenses, wholly or in part, or\r\nliquefies, the diffusion will not take place with the same uniformity.\r\nWe need not go further for illustration than to the case of our own\r\natmosphere as it actually exists. The vapour of water spreads uniformly\r\nthrough each layer of the atmosphere which is at such a temperature\r\nand pressure as to permit of such diffusion; but where the temperature\r\nis too low for complete diffusion (at the actual pressure) the aqueous\r\nvapour is condensed into visible cloud, diffusion being checked at\r\nthis point as at an impassable boundary. In the case of the sun, as\r\nin the case of our own earth, it is not the density of an element\r\nwhen in a vaporous form which limits its diffusion, but the value\r\nof the temperature at which its vapour at given pressure condenses\r\ninto liquid particles. It is in this way only that any separation can\r\nbe effected between the various elements which exist in the sun’s\r\nsubstance. A separation of this sort is unquestionably competent to\r\nmodify the spectroscopic evidence respecting different elements. But\r\nit would be a mistake to suppose that any such separation could occur\r\nas has been imagined by some—a separation causing in remote times\r\nthe planets supposed to have been thrown off by the sun to be rarest\r\non the outskirts of the solar system and densest close to the sun.\r\nThe small densities of the outer family of planets, as compared with\r\nthe densities of the so-called terrestrial planets, must certainly be\r\notherwise explained.\r\n\r\nBut undoubtedly the chief circumstance likely to operate in veiling\r\nthe existence of important constituents of the solar mass must be that\r\nwhich has so long prevented spectroscopists from detecting the presence\r\nof oxygen in the sun. An element may exist in such a condition, either\r\nover particular parts of the photosphere, or over the entire surface\r\nof the sun, that instead of causing dark lines in the solar spectrum\r\nit may produce bright lines. Such lines may be conspicuous, or they\r\nmay be so little brighter than the background of the spectrum as to be\r\nscarcely perceptible or quite imperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn passing, I would notice that this interpretation of the want of all\r\nspectroscopic evidence of the presence of oxygen, carbon, and other\r\nelements in the sun, is not an _ex post facto_ explanation. As will\r\npresently appear, it is now absolutely certain that oxygen, though\r\nreally existing, and doubtless, in enormous quantities, in the sun, has\r\nbeen concealed from recognition in this way. But that this might be so\r\nwas perceived long ago. I myself, in the first edition of my treatise\r\non “The Sun,” pointed out, in 1870, with special reference to nitrogen\r\nand oxygen, that an element “may be in a condition enabling it to\r\nradiate as much light as it absorbs, or else very little more or very\r\nlittle less; so that it either obliterates all signs of its existence,\r\nor else gives lines so little brighter or darker than the surrounding\r\nparts of the spectrum that we can detect no trace of its existence.”\r\nI had still earlier given a similar explanation of the absence of all\r\nspectroscopic evidence of hydrogen in the case of the bright star\r\nBetelgeux.[3]\r\n\r\nLet us more closely consider the significance of what we learn from\r\nthe spectral evidence respecting the gas hydrogen. We know that when\r\nthe total light of the sun is dealt with, the presence of hydrogen is\r\nconstantly indicated by dark lines. In other words, regarding the sun\r\nas a whole, hydrogen constantly reduces the emission of rays of those\r\nspecial tints which correspond to the light of this element. When we\r\nexamine the light of other suns than ours, we find that in many cases,\r\nprobably in by far the greater number of cases, hydrogen acts a similar\r\npart. But not in every case. In the spectra of some stars, notably in\r\nthose of Betelgeux and Alpha Herculis, the lines of hydrogen are not\r\nvisible at all; while in yet others, as Gamma Cassiopeiæ, the middle\r\nstar of the five which form the straggling W of this constellation,\r\nthe lines of hydrogen show bright upon the relatively dark background\r\nof the spectrum. When we examine closely the sun himself, we find that\r\nalthough his light as a whole gives a spectrum in which the lines of\r\nhydrogen appear dark, the light of particular parts of his surface,\r\nif separately examined, occasionally shows the hydrogen lines bright\r\nas in the spectrum of Gamma Cassiopeiæ, while sometimes the light of\r\nparticular parts gives, like the light of Betelgeux, no spectroscopic\r\nevidence whatever of the presence of hydrogen. Manifestly, if the whole\r\nsurface of the sun were in the condition of the portions which give\r\nbright hydrogen lines, the spectrum of the sun would resemble that of\r\nGamma Cassiopeiæ; while if the whole surface were in the condition of\r\nthose parts which show no lines of hydrogen, the spectrum of the sun\r\nwould resemble that of Betelgeux. Now if there were any reason for\r\nsupposing that the parts of the sun which give no lines of hydrogen\r\nare those from which the hydrogen has been temporarily removed in some\r\nway, we might reasonably infer that in the stars whose spectra show no\r\nhydrogen lines there is no hydrogen. But the fact that the hydrogen\r\nlines are sometimes seen bright renders this supposition untenable.\r\nFor we cannot suppose that the lines of hydrogen change from dark\r\nto bright or from bright to dark (both which changes certainly take\r\nplace) without passing through a stage in which they are neither bright\r\nnor dark; in other words, we are compelled to assume that there is\r\nan intermediate condition in which the hydrogen lines, though really\r\nexistent, are invisible because they are of precisely the same lustre\r\nas the adjacent parts of the spectrum. Hence the evanescence of the\r\nhydrogen lines affords no reason for supposing that hydrogen has become\r\neven reduced in quantity where the lines are not seen. And therefore\r\nit follows that the invisibility of the hydrogen lines in the spectrum\r\nof Betelgeux is no proof that hydrogen does not exist in that star in\r\nquantities resembling those in which it is present in the sun. And\r\nthis, being demonstrated in the case of one gas, must be regarded as\r\nat least probable in the case of other gases. Wherefore the absence of\r\nthe lines of oxygen from the spectrum of any star affords no sufficient\r\nreason for believing that oxygen is not present in that star, or that\r\nit may not be as plentifully present as hydrogen, or even far more\r\nplentifully present.\r\n\r\nThere are other considerations which have to be taken into account, as\r\nwell in dealing with the difficulty arising from the absence of the\r\nlines of particular elements from the solar spectrum as in weighing the\r\nextremely important discovery which has just been effected by Dr. H.\r\nDraper.\r\n\r\nI would specially call attention now to a point which I thus presented\r\nseven years ago:—“The great difficulty of interpreting the results\r\nof the spectroscopic analysis of the sun arises from the circumstance\r\nthat we have no means of learning whence that part of the light comes\r\nwhich gives the continuous spectrum. When we recognize certain dark\r\nlines, we know certainly that the corresponding element exists in the\r\ngaseous form at a lower temperature than the substance which gives the\r\ncontinuous spectrum. But as regards that continuous spectrum itself\r\nwe can form no such exact opinion.” It might, for instance, have\r\nits origin in glowing liquid or solid matter; but it might also be\r\ncompounded of many spectra, each containing a large number of bands,\r\nthe bands of one spectrum filling up the spaces which would be left\r\ndark between the bands of another spectrum, and so on until the entire\r\nrange from the extreme visible red to the extreme visible violet were\r\noccupied by what appeared as a continuous rainbow-tinted streak. “We\r\nhave, in fact, in the sun,” as I pointed out, “a vast agglomeration\r\nof elements, subject to two giant influences, producing in some sort\r\nopposing effects—viz., a temperature far surpassing any we can form\r\nany conception of, and a pressure (throughout nearly the whole of\r\nthe sun’s globe) which is perhaps even more disproportionate to the\r\nphenomena of our experience. Each known element would be vaporized by\r\nthe solar temperature at known pressures; each (there can be little\r\nquestion) would be solidified by the vast pressures, did these arise\r\nat known temperatures. Now whether, under these circumstances, the\r\nlaws of gaseous diffusion prevail where the elements _are_ gaseous in\r\nthe solar globe; whether, where liquid matter exists it is in general\r\nbounded in a definite manner from the neighbouring gaseous matter;\r\nwhether any elements at all are solid, and if so under what conditions\r\ntheir solidity is maintained and the limits of the solid matter\r\ndefined—all these are questions which _must_ be answered before we\r\ncan form a satisfactory idea of the solar constitution; yet they are\r\nquestions which we have at present no means of answering.” Again, we\r\nrequire to know whether any process resembling combustion can under\r\nany circumstances take place in the sun’s globe. If we could assume\r\nthat some general resemblance exists between the processes at work upon\r\nthe sun and those we are acquainted with, we might imagine that the\r\nvarious elements ordinarily exist in the sun’s globe in the gaseous\r\nform (chiefly) to certain levels, to others chiefly in the liquid form,\r\nand to yet others chiefly in the solid form. But even then that part\r\nof each element which is gaseous may exist in two forms, having widely\r\ndifferent spectra (in reality in five, but I consider only the extreme\r\nforms). The light of one part is capable of giving characteristic\r\nspectra of lines or bands (which will be different according to\r\npressure and may appear either dark or bright); that of the other is\r\ncapable of giving a spectrum nearly or quite continuous.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Dr. H. Draper’s discovery supplies an answer to\r\none of the questions, or rather to one of the sets of questions, thus\r\nindicated. I give his discovery as far as possible in his own words.\r\n\r\n“_Oxygen discloses itself_,” he says, “_by bright lines or bands in\r\nthe solar spectrum_, and does not give dark absorption-lines like the\r\nmetals. We must therefore change our theory of the solar spectrum,\r\nand no longer regard it merely as a continuous spectrum with certain\r\nrays absorbed by a layer of ignited metallic vapours, but as having\r\nalso bright lines and bands superposed on the background of continuous\r\nspectrum. Such a conception not only opens the way to the discovery\r\nof others of the non-metals, sulphur, phosphorus, selenium, chlorine,\r\nbromine, iodine, fluorine, carbon, etc., but also may account for some\r\nof the so-called dark lines, by regarding them as intervals between\r\nbright lines. It must be distinctly understood that in speaking of the\r\nsolar spectrum here, I do not mean the spectrum of any limited area\r\nupon the disc or margin of the sun, but the spectrum of light from the\r\nwhole disc.”\r\n\r\nIn support of the important statement here advanced, Dr. Draper submits\r\na photograph of part of the solar spectrum with a comparison spectrum\r\nof air, and also with some of the lines of iron and aluminium. The\r\nphotograph itself, a copy of which, kindly sent to me by Dr. Draper,\r\nlies before me as I write, fully bears out Dr. Draper’s statement. It\r\nis absolutely free from handwork or retouching, except that reference\r\nletters have been added in the negative. It shows the part of the solar\r\nspectrum between the well-known Fraunhofer lines G and H, of which G\r\n(an iron line) lies in the indigo, and H (a line of hydrogen) in the\r\nviolet, so that the portion photographed belongs to that region of\r\nthe spectrum whose chemical or actinic energy is strongest. Adjacent\r\nto this lies the photograph of the air lines, showing nine or ten\r\nwell-defined oxygen lines or groups of lines, and two nitrogen bands.\r\nThe exact agreement of the two spectra in position is indicated by\r\nthe coincidence of bright lines of iron and aluminium included in the\r\nair spectrum with the dark lines of the same elements in the solar\r\nspectrum. “No close observation,” as Dr. Draper truly remarks, “is\r\nneeded to demonstrate to even the most casual observer” (of this\r\nphotograph) “that the oxygen lines are found in the sun as bright\r\nlines.” There is in particular one quadruple group of oxygen lines in\r\nthe air spectrum, the coincidence of which with a group of bright lines\r\nin the solar spectrum is unmistakable.\r\n\r\n“This oxygen group alone is almost sufficient,” says Dr. Draper, “to\r\nprove the presence of oxygen in the sun, for not only does each of\r\nthe four components have a representative in the solar group, but the\r\nrelative strength and the general aspect of the lines in each case is\r\nsimilar.[4] I shall not attempt at this time,” he proceeds, “to give\r\na complete list of the oxygen lines, ... and it will be noticed that\r\nsome lines in the air spectrum which have bright anologues in the sun\r\nare not marked with the symbol of oxygen. This is because there has not\r\nyet been an opportunity to make the necessary detailed comparisons. In\r\norder to be certain that a line belongs to oxygen, I have compared,\r\nunder various pressures, the spectra of air, oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic\r\nacid, carburetted hydrogen, hydrogen, and cyanogen.\r\n\r\n“As to the spectrum of nitrogen and the existence of this element in\r\nthe sun there is not yet certainty. Nevertheless, even by comparing\r\nthe diffused nitrogen lines of this particular photograph, in which\r\nnitrogen has been sacrificed to get the best effect for oxygen, the\r\ncharacter of the evidence appears. There is a triple band somewhat\r\ndiffused in the photograph belonging to nitrogen, which has its\r\nappropriate representative in the solar spectrum, and another band of\r\nnitrogen is similarly represented.” Dr. Draper states that “in another\r\nphotograph a heavy nitrogen line which in the present one lies opposite\r\nan insufficiently exposed part of the solar spectrum, corresponds to a\r\ncomparison band in the sun.”\r\n\r\nBut one of the most remarkable points in Dr. Draper’s paper is what\r\nhe tells us respecting the visibility of these lines in the spectrum\r\nitself. They fall, as I have mentioned, in a part of the spectrum where\r\nthe actinic energy is great but the luminosity small; in fact, while\r\nthis part of the spectrum is the very strongest for photography, it is\r\nclose to the region of the visible spectrum,\r\n\r\n    “Where the last gleamings of refracted light\r\n    Die in the fainting violet away.”\r\n\r\nIt is therefore to be expected that those, if any, of the bright lines\r\nof oxygen, will be least favourably shown for direct vision, and most\r\nfavourably for what might almost be called photographic vision, where\r\nwe see what photography records for us. Yet Dr. Draper states that\r\nthese bright lines of oxygen can be readily seen. “The bright lines\r\nof oxygen in the spectrum of the solar disc have not been hitherto\r\nperceived, probably from the fact that in eye-observation bright lines\r\non a less bright background do not make the impression on the mind that\r\ndark lines do. When attention is called to their presence they are\r\nreadily enough seen, even without the aid of a reference spectrum. The\r\nphotograph, however, brings them into greater prominence.” As the lines\r\nof oxygen are not confined to the indigo and violet, we may fairly hope\r\nthat the bright lines in other parts of the spectrum of oxygen may be\r\ndetected in the spectrum of the sun, now that spectroscopists know that\r\nbright lines and not dark lines are to be looked for.\r\n\r\nDr. Draper remarks that from purely theoretic considerations derived\r\nfrom terrestrial chemistry, and the nebular hypothesis, the presence of\r\noxygen in the sun might have been strongly suspected; for this element\r\nis currently stated to form eight-ninths of the water of the globe,\r\none-third of the crust of the earth, and one-fifth of the air, and\r\nshould therefore probably be a large constituent of every member of the\r\nsolar system. On the other hand, the discovery of oxygen, and probably\r\nother non-metals, in the sun gives increased strength to the nebular\r\nhypothesis, because to many persons the absence of this important group\r\nhas presented a considerable difficulty. I have already remarked on the\r\ncircumstance that we cannot, according to the known laws of gaseous\r\ndiffusion, accept the reasoning of those who have endeavoured to\r\nexplain the small density of the outer planets by the supposition that\r\nthe lighter gases were left behind by the great contracting nebulous\r\nmass, out of which, on the nebular hypothesis, the solar system is\r\nsupposed to have been formed. It is important to notice, now, that if\r\non the one hand we find in the community of structure between the sun\r\nand our earth, as confirmed by the discovery of oxygen and nitrogen\r\nin the sun, evidence favouring the theory according to which all the\r\nmembers of that system were formed out of what was originally a single\r\nmass, we do not find evidence against the theory (as those who have\r\nadvanced the explanation above referred to may be disposed to imagine)\r\nin the recognition in the sun’s mass of enormous quantities of one\r\nof these elements which, according to their view, ought to be found\r\nchiefly in the outer members of the solar system. If those who believe\r\nin the nebular hypothesis (generally, that is, for many of the details\r\nof the hypothesis as advanced by Laplace are entirely untenable in\r\nthe present position of physical science) had accepted the attempted\r\nexplanation of the supposed absence of the non-metallic elements in the\r\nsun, they would now find themselves in a somewhat awkward position.\r\nThey would, in fact, be almost bound logically to reject the nebular\r\nhypothesis, seeing that one of the asserted results of the formation of\r\nour system, according to that hypothesis, would have been disproved.\r\nBut so far as I know no supporter of the nebular hypothesis possessing\r\nsufficient knowledge of astronomical facts and physical laws to render\r\nhis opinion of any weight, has ever given in his adhesion to the\r\nunsatisfactory explanation referred to.\r\n\r\nThe view which I have long entertained respecting the growth of the\r\nsolar system—viz., that it had its origin, not in contraction only or\r\nchiefly, but in combined processes of contraction and accretion—seems\r\nto me to be very strongly confirmed by Dr. Draper’s discovery. This\r\nwould not be the place for a full discussion of the reasons on which\r\nthis opinion is based. But I may remark that I believe no one who\r\napplies the laws of physics, _as at present known_, to the theory of\r\nthe simple contraction of a great nebulous mass formerly extending\r\nfar beyond the orbit of Neptune, till, when planet after planet had\r\nbeen thrown off, the sun was left in his present form and condition\r\nin the centre, will fail to perceive enormous difficulties in the\r\nhypothesis, or to recognize in Dr. Draper’s discovery a difficulty\r\nadded to those affecting the hypothesis _so presented_. Has it ever\r\noccurred, I often wonder, to those who glibly quote the nebular theory\r\nas originally propounded, to inquire how far some of the processes\r\nsuggested by Laplace are in accordance with the now known laws of\r\nphysics? To begin with, the original nebulous mass extending to a\r\ndistance exceeding the earth’s distance from the sun more than thirty\r\ntimes (this being only the distance of Neptune), if we assign to it a\r\ndegree of compression making its axial diameter half its equatorial\r\ndiameter, would have had a volume exceeding the sun’s (roughly) about\r\n120,000,000,000 times, and in this degree its mean density would have\r\nbeen less than the sun’s. This would correspond to a density equal\r\n(roughly) to about one-400,000th part of the density of hydrogen gas at\r\natmospheric pressure. To suppose that a great mass of matter, having\r\nthis exceedingly small mean density, and extending to a distance of\r\nthree or four thousand millions of miles from its centre, could under\r\nany circumstances rotate as a whole, or behave in other respects after\r\nthe fashion attributed to the gaseous embryon of the solar system\r\nin ordinary descriptions of the nebular hypothesis, is altogether\r\ninconsistent with correct ideas of physical and dynamical laws. It is\r\nabsolutely a necessity of any nebular hypothesis of the solar system,\r\nthat from the very beginning a central nucleus and subordinate nuclei\r\nshould form in it, and grow according to the results of the motions (at\r\nfirst to all intents and purposes independent) of its various parts.\r\nGranting this state of things, we arrive, by considering the combined\r\neffects of accretion and contraction, at a process of development\r\naccording fully as well as that ordinarily described with the general\r\nrelations described by Laplace, and accounting also (in a general way)\r\nfor certain peculiarities which are in no degree explained by the\r\nordinary theory. Amongst these may specially be noted the arrangement\r\nand distribution of the masses within the solar system, and the fact\r\nthat so far as spectroscopic evidence enables us to judge, a general\r\nsimilarity of structure exists throughout the whole of the system.\r\n\r\nInquiring as to the significance of his discovery, Dr. Draper remarks\r\nthat it seems rather difficult “at first sight to believe that an\r\nignited[5] gas in the solar atmosphere should not be indicated by dark\r\nlines in the solar spectrum, and should appear not to act under the\r\nlaw, ‘a gas when ignited absorbs rays of the same refrangibility as\r\nthose it emits.’ But, in fact, the substances hitherto investigated in\r\nthe sun are really metallic vapours, hydrogen probably coming under\r\nthat rule. The non-metals obviously may behave differently. It is easy\r\nto speculate on the causes of such behaviour; and it may be suggested\r\nthat the reason of the non-appearance of a dark line may be that\r\nthe intensity of the light from a great thickness of ignited oxygen\r\noverpowers the effect of the photosphere, just as, if a person were to\r\nlook at a candle-flame through a yard thickness of sodium vapour, he\r\nwould only see bright sodium lines, and no dark absorption.”\r\n\r\nThe reasoning here is not altogether satisfactory (or else is not\r\nquite correctly expressed). In the first place, the difficulty dealt\r\nwith has no real existence. The law that a gas when glowing absorbs\r\nrays of the same refrangibility as it emits, does not imply that a\r\ngas between a source of light and the observer will show its presence\r\nby spectroscopic dark lines. A gas so placed _does_ receive from the\r\nsource of light rays corresponding to those which it emits itself, if\r\nit is cooler than the source of light; and it absorbs them, being in\r\nfact heated by means of them, though the gain of temperature may be\r\ndissipated as fast as received; but if the gas is hotter, it emits more\r\nof those rays than it absorbs, and will make its presence known by its\r\nbright lines. This is not a matter of speculation, but of experiment.\r\nOn the other hand, the experiment suggested by Dr. Draper would not\r\nhave the effect he supposes, if it were correctly made. Doubtless,\r\nif the light from a considerable area of dully glowing sodium vapour\r\nwere received by the spectroscope at the same time as the light of a\r\ncandle-flame seen through the sodium vapour, the light of the sodium\r\nvapour overcoming that of the candle-flame would indicate its presence\r\nby bright lines; but if light were received only from that portion of\r\nthe sodium vapour which lay between the eye and the candle-flame, then\r\nI apprehend that the dark lines of sodium would not only be seen, but\r\nwould be conspicuous by their darkness.\r\n\r\nIt is in no cavilling spirit that I indicate what appears to me\r\nerroneous in a portion of Dr. Draper’s reasoning on his great\r\ndiscovery. The entire significance of the discovery depends on the\r\nmeaning attached to it, and therefore it is most desirable to ascertain\r\nwhat this meaning really is. There can be no doubt, I think, that we\r\nare to look for the true interpretation of the brightness of the oxygen\r\nlines in the higher temperature of the oxygen, not in the great depth\r\nof oxygen above the photospheric level. The oxygen which produces\r\nthese bright lines need not necessarily be above the photosphere at\r\nall. (In fact, I may remark here that Dr. Draper, in a communication\r\naddressed to myself, mentions that he has found no traces at present\r\nof oxygen above the photosphere, though I had not this circumstance\r\nin my thoughts in reasoning down to the conclusion that the part of\r\nthe oxygen effective in showing these bright lines lies probably below\r\nthe visible photosphere.) Of course, if the photosphere were really\r\ncomposed of glowing solid and liquid matter, or of masses of gas so\r\ncompressed and so intensely heated as to give a continuous spectrum,\r\nno gas existing below the photosphere could send its light through,\r\nnor could its presence, therefore, be indicated in any spectroscopic\r\nmanner. But the investigations which have been made into the structure\r\nof the photosphere as revealed by the telescope, and in particular the\r\nobservations made by Professor Langley, of the Alleghany Observatory,\r\nshow that we have not in the photosphere a definite bounding envelope\r\nof the sun, but receive light from many different depths below that\r\nspherical surface, 425,000 miles from the sun’s centre, which we call\r\nthe photospheric level. We receive more light from the centre of\r\nthe solar disc, I feel satisfied, not solely because the absorptive\r\nlayer through which we there see the sun is shallower, but partly,\r\nand perhaps chiefly, because we there receive light from some of the\r\ninterior and more intensely heated parts of the sun.[6] Should this\r\nprove to be the case, it may be found possible to do what heretofore\r\nastronomers have supposed to be impossible—to ascertain in some degree\r\nhow far and in what way the constitution of the sun varies below the\r\nphotosphere, which, so far as ordinary telescopic observation is\r\nconcerned, seems to present a limit below which researches cannot be\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nI hope we shall soon obtain news from Dr. Huggins’s Observatory that\r\nthe oxygen lines have been photographed, and possibly the bright lines\r\nof other elements recognized in the solar spectrum. Mr. Lockyer also,\r\nwe may hope, will exercise that observing skill which enabled him early\r\nto recognize the presence of bright hydrogen lines in the spectrum\r\nof portions of the sun’s surface, to examine that spectrum for other\r\nbright lines.\r\n\r\nI do not remember any time within the last twenty years when the\r\nprospects of fresh solar discoveries seemed more hopeful than they do\r\nat present. The interest which has of late years been drawn to the\r\nsubject has had the effect of enlisting fresh recruits in the work of\r\nobservation, and many of these may before long be heard of as among\r\nthose who have employed Dr. Draper’s method successfully.\r\n\r\nBut I would specially call attention to the interest which attaches\r\nto Dr. Draper’s discovery and to the researches likely to follow from\r\nit, in connection with a branch of research which is becoming more\r\nand more closely connected year by year with solar investigations—I\r\nmean stellar spectroscopy. We have seen the stars divided into orders\r\naccording to their constitution. We recognize evidence tending to show\r\nthat these various orders depend in part upon age—not absolute but\r\nrelative age. There are among the suns which people space some younger\r\nby far than our sun, others far older, and some in a late stage of\r\nstellar decrepitude. Whether as yet spectroscopists have perfectly\r\nsucceeded in classifying these stellar orders in such sort that the\r\nconnection between a star’s spectrum and the star’s age can be at\r\nonce determined, may be doubtful. But certainly there are reasons for\r\nhoping that before long this will be done. Amongst the stars, and\r\n(strange to say) among celestial objects which are not stars, there\r\nare suns in every conceivable stage of development, from embryon\r\nmasses not as yet justly to be regarded as suns, to masses which have\r\nceased to fulfil the duties of suns. Among the more pressing duties of\r\nspectroscopic analysis at the present time is the proper classification\r\nof these various orders of stars. Whensoever that task shall have been\r\naccomplished, strong light, I venture to predict, will be thrown on our\r\nsun’s present condition, as well as on his past history, and on that\r\nfuture fate upon which depends the future of our earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUN-SPOT, STORM, AND FAMINE._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last five or six years a section of the scientific world\r\nhas been exercised with the question how far the condition of the\r\nsun’s surface with regard to spots affects our earth’s condition as to\r\nweather, and therefore as to those circumstances which are more or less\r\ndependent on weather. Unfortunately, the question thus raised has not\r\npresented itself alone, but in company with another not so strictly\r\nscientific, in fact, regarded by most men of science as closely related\r\nto personal considerations—the question, namely, whether certain\r\nindicated persons should or should not be commissioned to undertake the\r\ninquiry into the scientific problem. But the scientific question itself\r\nought not to be less interesting to us because it has been associated,\r\ncorrectly or not, with the wants and wishes of those who advocate\r\nthe endowment of science. I propose here to consider the subject in\r\nits scientific aspect only, and apart from any bias suggested by the\r\nappeals which have been addressed to the administrators of the public\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out, in the first place, that all\r\nthe phenomena of weather are directly referable to the sun as their\r\ngoverning cause. His rays poured upon our air cause the more important\r\natmospheric currents directly. Indirectly they cause modifications\r\nof these currents, because where they fall on water or on moist\r\nsurfaces they raise aqueous vapour into the air, which, when it\r\nreturns to the liquid form as cloud, gives up to the surrounding air\r\nthe heat which had originally vaporized the water. In these ways,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, various degrees of pressure and temperature\r\nare brought about in the atmospheric envelope of the earth, and,\r\nspeaking generally, all air currents, from the gentlest zephyr to the\r\nfiercest tornado, are the movements by which the equilibrium of the\r\nair is restored. Like other movements tending to restore equilibrium,\r\nthe atmospheric motions are oscillatory. Precisely as when a spring\r\nhas been bent one way, it flies not back only, but beyond the mean\r\nposition, till it is almost equally bent the other way, so the current\r\nof air which rushes in towards a place of unduly diminished pressure\r\ndoes more than restore the mean pressure, so that presently a return\r\ncurrent carries off the excess of air thus carried in. We may say,\r\nindeed, that the mean pressure at any place scarcely ever exists, and\r\nwhen it exists for a time the resulting calm is of short duration.\r\nJust as the usual condition of the sea surface is one of disturbance,\r\ngreater or less, so the usual condition of the air at every spot on\r\nthe earth’s surface is one of motion not of quiescence. Every movement\r\nof the air, thus almost constantly perturbed, is due directly or\r\nindirectly to the sun.\r\n\r\nSo also every drop of rain or snow, every particle of liquid or of\r\nfrozen water in mist or in cloud, owes its birth to the sun. The\r\nquestions addressed of old to Job, “Hath the rain a father? or who\r\nhath begotten the drops of dew? out of whose womb came the ice? and\r\nthe hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?” have been answered\r\nby modern science, and to every question the answer is, The Sun. He\r\nis parent of the snow and hail, as he is of the moist warm rains of\r\nsummer, of the ice which crowns the everlasting hills, and of the mist\r\nwhich rises from the valleys beneath his morning rays.\r\n\r\nSince, then, the snow that clothes the earth in winter as with a\r\ngarment, and the clouds that in due season drop fatness on the earth,\r\nare alike gendered by the sun; since every movement in our air, from\r\nthe health-bringing breeze to the most destructive hurricane, owns him\r\nas its parent; we must at the outset admit, that if there is any body\r\nexternal to the earth whose varying aspect or condition can inform us\r\nbeforehand of changes which the weather is to undergo, the sun is that\r\nbody. That for countless ages the moon should have been regarded as\r\nthe great weather-breeder, shows only how prone men are to recognize\r\nin apparent changes the true cause of real changes, and how slight\r\nthe evidence is on which they will base laws of association which\r\nhave no real foundation in fact. Every one can see when the moon is\r\nfull, or horned, or gibbous, or half-full; when her horns are directed\r\nupwards, or downwards, or sideways. And as the weather is always\r\nchanging, even as the moon is always changing, it must needs happen\r\nthat from time to time changes of weather so closely follow changes\r\nof the moon as to suggest that the two orders of change stand to each\r\nother in the relation of cause and effect. Thus rough rules (such as\r\nthose which Aratus has handed down to us) came to be formed, and as\r\n(to use Bacon’s expression) men mark when such rules hit, and never\r\nmark when they miss, a system of weather lore gradually comes into\r\nbeing, which, while in one sense based on facts, has not in reality a\r\nparticle of true evidence in its favour—every single fact noted for\r\neach relation having been contradicted by several unnoted facts opposed\r\nto the relation. There could be no more instructive illustration of\r\nmen’s habits in such matters than the system of lunar weather wisdom in\r\nvogue to this day among seamen, though long since utterly disproved by\r\nscience. But let it be remarked in passing, that in leaving the moon,\r\nwhich has no direct influence, and scarcely any indirect influence, on\r\nthe weather, for the sun, which is all-powerful, we have not got rid of\r\nthe mental habits which led men so far astray in former times. We shall\r\nhave to be specially careful lest it lead us astray yet once more,\r\nperhaps all the more readily because of the confidence with which we\r\nfeel that, at the outset anyway, we are on the right road.\r\n\r\nI suppose there must have been a time when men were not altogether\r\ncertain whether the varying apparent path of the sun, as he travels\r\nfrom east to west every day, has any special effect on the weather.\r\nIt seems so natural to us to recognize in the sun’s greater mid-day\r\nelevation and longer continuance above the horizon in summer, the cause\r\nof the greater warmth which then commonly prevails, that we find it\r\ndifficult to believe that men could ever have been in doubt on this\r\nsubject. Yet it is probable that a long time passed after the position\r\nof the sun as ruler of the day had been noticed, before his power as\r\nruler of the seasons was recognized. I cannot at this moment recall\r\nany passage in the Bible, for example, in which direct reference is\r\nmade to the sun’s special influence in bringing about the seasons, or\r\nany passage in very ancient writings referring definitely to the fact\r\nthat the weather changes with the changing position of the sun in the\r\nskies (as distinguished from the star-sphere), and with the changing\r\nlength of the day. “While the earth remaineth,” we are told in Genesis,\r\n“seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and\r\nday and night, shall not cease;” but there is no reference to the sun’s\r\naspect as determining summer and winter. We find no mention of any of\r\nthe celestial signs of the seasons anywhere in the Bible, I think, but\r\nsuch signs as are mentioned in the parable of the fig tree—“When his\r\nbranch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is\r\nnigh.” Whether this indicates or not that the terrestrial, rather than\r\nthe celestial signs of the progress of the year were chiefly noted by\r\nmen in those times, it is tolerably certain that in the beginning a\r\nlong interval must have elapsed between the recognition of the seasons\r\nthemselves, and the recognition of their origin in the changes of the\r\nsun’s apparent motions.\r\n\r\nWhen this discovery was effected, men made the most important and, I\r\nthink, the most satisfactory step towards the determination of cyclic\r\nassociations between solar and terrestrial phenomena. It is for that\r\nreason that I refer specially to the point. In reality, it does not\r\nappertain to my subject, for seasons and sun-spots are not associated.\r\nBut it admirably illustrates the value of cyclic relations. Men might\r\nhave gone on for centuries, we may conceive, noting the recurrence\r\nof seed-time and harvest-time, summer and winter, recognizing the\r\nperiodical returns of heat and cold, and (in some regions) of dry\r\nseasons and wet seasons, of calm and storm, and so forth, without\r\nperceiving that the sun runs through his changes of diurnal motion in\r\nthe same cyclic period. We can imagine that some few who might notice\r\nthe connection between the two orders of celestial phenomena would\r\nbe anxious to spread their faith in the association among their less\r\nobservant brethren. They might maintain that observatories for watching\r\nthe motions of the sun would demonstrate either that their belief\r\nwas just or that it was not so, would in fact dispose finally of the\r\nquestion. It is giving the most advantageous possible position to those\r\nwho now advocate the erection of solar observatories for determining\r\nwhat connection, if any, may exist between sun-spots and terrestrial\r\nphenomena, thus to compare them to observers who had noted a relation\r\nwhich unquestionably exists. But it is worthy of notice that if those\r\nwhom I have imagined thus urging the erection of an observatory for\r\nsolving the question whether the sun rules the seasons, and to some\r\ndegree regulates the recurrence of dry or rainy, and of calm or\r\nstormy weather, had promised results of material value from their\r\nobservations, they would have promised more than they could possibly\r\nhave performed. Even in this most favourable case, where the sun is,\r\nbeyond all question, the efficient ruling body, where the nature of\r\nthe cyclic change is most exactly determinable, and where even the way\r\nin which the sun acts can be exactly ascertained, no direct benefit\r\naccrues from the knowledge. The exact determination of the sun’s\r\napparent motions has its value, and this value is great, but it is most\r\ncertainly not derived from any power of predicting the recurrence of\r\nthose phenomena which nevertheless depend directly on the sun’s action.\r\nThe farmer who in any given year knows from the almanac the exact\r\nduration of daylight, and the exact mid-day elevation of the sun for\r\nevery day in the year, is not one whit better able to protect his crops\r\nor his herds against storm or flood than the tiller of the soil or the\r\ntender of flocks a hundred thousand years or so ago, who knew only when\r\nseed-time and summer and harvest-time and winter were at hand or in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe evidence thus afforded is by no means promising, then, so far as\r\nthe prediction of special storms, or floods, or droughts is concerned.\r\nIt would seem that if past experience can afford any evidence in such\r\nmatters, men may expect to recognize cycles of weather change long\r\nbefore they recognize corresponding solar cycles (presuming always that\r\nsuch cycles exist), and that they may expect to find the recognition\r\nof such association utterly barren, so far as the possibility of\r\npredicting definite weather changes is concerned. It would seem that\r\nthere is no likelihood of anything better than what Sir J. Herschel\r\nsaid _might_ be hoped for hereafter. “A lucky hit may be made; nay,\r\nsome rude approach to the perception of a ‘cycle of seasons’ may\r\n_possibly_ be obtainable. But no person in his senses would alter\r\nhis plans of conduct for six months in advance in the most trifling\r\nparticular on the faith of any special prediction of a warm or a cold,\r\na wet or a dry, a calm or a stormy, summer or winter”—far less of a\r\ngreat storm or flood announced for any special day.\r\n\r\nBut let us see what the cycle association between solar spots and\r\nterrestrial weather actually is, or rather of what nature it promises\r\nto be, for as yet the true nature of the association has not been made\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that in a period of about eleven years the sun’s\r\nsurface is affected by what may be described as a wave of sun-spots.\r\nThere is a short time—a year or so—during which scarce any spots are\r\nseen; they become more and more numerous during the next four or five\r\nyears, until they attain a maximum of frequency and size; after this\r\nthey wane in number and dimensions, until at length, about eleven years\r\nfrom the time when he had before been freest from spots, he attains\r\nagain a similar condition. After this the spots begin to return,\r\ngradually attain to a maximum, then gradually diminish, until after\r\neleven more years have elapsed few or none are seen. It must not be\r\nsupposed that the sun is always free from spots at the time of minimum\r\nspot frequency, or that he always shows many and large spots at the\r\ntime of maximum spot frequency. Occasionally several very large spots,\r\nand sometimes singularly large spots, have been seen in the very heart\r\nof the minimum spot season, and again there have been occasions when\r\nscarcely any spots have been seen for several days in the very heart\r\nof the maximum spot season. But, taking the average of each year,\r\nthe progression of the spots in number and frequency from minimum\r\nto maximum, and their decline from maximum to minimum, are quite\r\nunmistakeable.\r\n\r\nNow there are some terrestrial phenomena which we might expect to\r\nrespond in greater or less degree to the sun’s changes of condition\r\nwith respect to spots. We cannot doubt that the emission both of light\r\nand of heat is affected by the presence of spots. It is not altogether\r\nclear in what way the emission is affected. We cannot at once assume\r\nthat because the spots are dark the quantity of sunlight must be less\r\nwhen the spots are numerous; for it may well be that the rest of the\r\nsun’s surface may at such times be notably brighter than usual, and the\r\ntotal emission of light may be greater on the whole instead of less.\r\nSimilarly of the emission of heat. It is certain that when there are\r\nmany spots the surface of the sun is far less uniform in brightness\r\nthan at other times. The increase of brightness all round the spots is\r\nobvious to the eye when the sun’s image, duly enlarged, is received\r\nupon a screen in a darkened room. Whether the total emission of light\r\nis increased or diminished has not yet been put to the test. Professor\r\nLangley, of the Alleghany Observatory, near Pittsburg, U.S., has\r\ncarefully measured the diminution of the sun’s emission of light and\r\nheat on the assumption that the portion of the surface not marked by\r\nspots remains unchanged in lustre. But until the total emission of\r\nlight and heat at the times of maximum and minimum has been measured,\r\nwithout any assumption of the kind, we cannot decide the question.\r\n\r\nMore satisfactory would seem to be the measurements which have been\r\nmade by Professor Piazzi Smyth, at Edinburgh, and later by the\r\nAstronomer Royal at Greenwich, into the underground temperature of\r\nthe earth. By examining the temperature deep down below the surface,\r\nall local and temporary causes of change are eliminated, and causes\r\nexternal to the earth can alone be regarded as effective in producing\r\nsystematic changes. “The effect is very slight,” I wrote a few years\r\nago, “indeed barely recognizable. I have before me as I write Professor\r\nSmyth’s sheet of the quarterly temperatures from 1837 to 1869 at\r\ndepths of 3, 6, 12, and 24 French feet. Of course the most remarkable\r\nfeature, even at the depth of 24 feet, is the alternate rise and fall\r\nwith the seasons. But it is seen that, while the range of rise and fall\r\nremains very nearly constant, the crests and troughs of the waves lie\r\nat varying levels.” After describing in the essay above referred to,\r\nwhich appears in my “Science Byways,” the actual configuration of the\r\ncurves of temperature both for seasons and for years, and the chart in\r\nwhich the sun-spot waves and the temperature waves are brought into\r\ncomparison, I was obliged to admit that the alleged association between\r\nthe sun-spot period and the changes of underground temperature did\r\nnot seem to me very clearly made out. It appears, however, there is a\r\nslight increase of temperature at the time when the sun-spots are least\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nThat the earth’s magnetism is affected by the sun’s condition with\r\nrespect to spots, seems to have been more clearly made out, though\r\nit must be noted that the Astronomer Royal considers the Greenwich\r\nmagnetic observations inconsistent with this theory. It seems to have\r\nbeen rendered at least extremely probable that the daily oscillation\r\nof the magnetic needle is greater when spots are numerous than when\r\nthere are few spots or none. Magnetic storms are also more numerous at\r\nthe time of maximum spot-frequency, and auroras are then more common.\r\n(The reader will not fall into the mistake of supposing that magnetic\r\nstorms have the remotest resemblance to hurricanes, or rainstorms, or\r\nhailstorms, or even to thunderstorms, though the thunderstorm is an\r\nelectrical phenomenon. What is meant by a magnetic storm is simply such\r\na condition of the earth’s frame that the magnetic currents traversing\r\nit are unusually strong.)\r\n\r\nThus far, however, we have merely considered relations which we might\r\nfairly expect to find affected by the sun’s condition as to spots.\r\nA slight change in his total brightness and in the total amount of\r\nheat emitted by him may naturally be looked for under circumstances\r\nwhich visibly affect the emission of light, and presumably affect the\r\nemission of heat also, from portions of his surface. Nor can we wonder\r\nif terrestrial magnetism, which is directly dependent on the sun’s\r\nemission of heat, should be affected by the existence of spots upon his\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with the effects which have recently been associated\r\nwith the sun’s condition. It may or may not prove actually to be the\r\ncase that wind and rain vary in quantity as the sun-spots vary in\r\nnumber (at least when we take in both cases the average for a year, or\r\nfor two or three years), but it cannot be said that any such relation\r\nwas antecedently to be expected. When we consider what the sun actually\r\ndoes for our earth, it seems unlikely that special effects such as\r\nthese should depend on relatively minute peculiarities of the sun’s\r\nsurface. There is our earth, with her oceans and continents, turning\r\naround swiftly on her axis, and exposed to his rays as a whole. Or,\r\ninverting the way of viewing matters, there is the sun riding high in\r\nthe heavens of any region of the earth, pouring down his rays upon that\r\nregion. We can understand how in the one case that rotating orb of the\r\nearth may receive rather more or rather less heat from the sun when\r\nhe is spotted than when he is not, or how in the other way of viewing\r\nmatters, that orb of the sun may give to any region rather more or\r\nrather less heat according as his surface is more or less spotted.\r\nBut that in special regions of that rotating earth storms should be\r\nmore or less frequent or rainfall heavier or lighter, as the sun’s\r\ncondition changes through the exceedingly small range of variation due\r\nto the formation of spots, seems antecedently altogether unlikely; and\r\nequally unlikely the idea that peculiarities affecting limited regions\r\nof the sun’s surface should affect appreciably the general condition\r\nof the earth. If a somewhat homely comparison may be permitted, we\r\ncan well understand how a piece of meat roasting before a fire may\r\nreceive a greater or less supply of heat on the whole as the fire\r\nundergoes slight local changes (very slight indeed they must be, that\r\nthe illustration may be accurate); but it would be extremely surprising\r\nif, in consequence of such slight changes in the fire, the roasting of\r\nparticular portions of the joint were markedly accelerated or delayed,\r\nor affected in any other special manner.\r\n\r\nBut of course all such considerations as to antecedent probabilities\r\nmust give way before the actual evidence of observed facts. Utterly\r\ninconsistent with all that is yet known of the sun’s physical action,\r\nas it may seem, on _à priori_ grounds, to suppose that spots, currents,\r\nor other local disturbances of the sun’s surface could produce any but\r\ngeneral effects on the earth as a whole, yet if we shall find that\r\nparticular effects are produced in special regions of the earth’s\r\nsurface in cycles unmistakably synchronizing with the solar-spot-cycle,\r\nwe must accept the fact, whether we can explain it or not. Only let it\r\nbe remembered at the outset that the earth is a large place, and the\r\nvariations of wind and calm, rain and drought, are many and various in\r\ndifferent regions. Whatever place we select for examining the rainfall,\r\nfor example, we are likely to find, in running over the records of the\r\nlast thirty years or so, some seemingly oscillatory changes; in the\r\nrecords of the winds, again, we are likely to find other seemingly\r\noscillatory changes; if none of these records provide anything which\r\nseems in any way to correspond with the solar spot-cycle, we may\r\nperchance find some such cycle in the relative rainfall of particular\r\nmonths, or in the varying wetness or dryness of particular winds, and\r\nso forth. Or, if we utterly fail to find any such relation in one\r\nplace we may find it in another, or not improbably in half-a-dozen\r\nplaces among the hundreds which are available for the search. If we\r\nare content with imperfect correspondence between some meteorological\r\nprocess or another and the solar-spot cycle, we shall be exceedingly\r\nunfortunate indeed if we fail to find a score of illustrative\r\ninstances. And if we only record these, without noticing any of the\r\ncases where we fail to find any association whatever—in other words,\r\nas Bacon puts it, if “we note when we hit and never note when we\r\nmiss,” we shall be able to make what will seem a very strong case\r\nindeed. But this is not exactly the scientific method in such cases.\r\nBy following such a course, indeed, we might prove almost anything. If\r\nwe take, for instance, a pack of cards, and regard the cards in order\r\nas corresponding to the years 1825 to 1877, and note their colours as\r\ndealt _once_, we shall find it very difficult to show that there is any\r\nconnection whatever between the colours of the cards corresponding to\r\nparticular years and the number of spots on the sun’s face. But if we\r\nrepeat the process a thousand times, we shall find certain instances\r\namong the number, in which red suits correspond to all the years when\r\nthere are many spots on the sun, and black suits to all the years\r\nwhen there are few spots on the sun. If now we were to publish all\r\nsuch deals, without mentioning anything at all about the others which\r\nshowed no such association, we should go far to convince a certain\r\nsection of the public that the condition of the sun as to spots might\r\nhereafter be foretold by the cards; whence, if the public were already\r\nsatisfied that the condition of the sun specially affects the weather\r\nof particular places, it would follow that the future weather of these\r\nplaces might also be foretold by the cards.\r\n\r\nI mention this matter at the outset, because many who are anxious to\r\nfind some such cycle of seasons as Sir John Herschel thought might be\r\ndiscovered, have somewhat overlooked the fact that we must not hunt\r\ndown such a cycle _per fas et nefas_. “Surely in meteorology as in\r\nastronomy,” Mr. Lockyer writes, for instance, “the thing to hunt down\r\nis a cycle, and if that is not to be found in the temperate zone, then\r\ngo to the frigid zones or the torrid zone to look for it; and if found,\r\nthen above all things and in whatever manner, lay hold of, study, and\r\nread it, and see what it means.” There can be no doubt that this is the\r\nway to find a cycle, or at least to find what looks like a cycle, but\r\nthe worth of a cycle found in this way will be very questionable.[7]\r\n\r\nI would not have it understood, however, that I consider all the cycles\r\nnow to be referred to as unreal, or even that the supposed connection\r\nbetween them and the solar cycle has no existence. I only note that\r\nthere are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of relations among\r\nwhich cycles may be looked for, and that there are perhaps twenty or\r\nthirty cases in which some sort of cyclic association between certain\r\nmeteorological relations and the period of the solar spots presents\r\nitself. According to the recognized laws of probability, some at least\r\namongst these cases must be regarded as accidental. Some, however, may\r\nstill remain which are not accidental.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest published instances may be mentioned Mr. Baxendell’s\r\nrecognition of the fact that during a certain series of years, about\r\nthirty, I think, the amount of rainfall at Oxford was greater under\r\nwest and south-west winds than under south and south-east winds when\r\nsun-spots were most numerous, whereas the reverse held in years when\r\nthere were no spots or few. Examining the meteorological records of\r\nSt. Petersburg, he found that a contrary state of things prevailed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Main, Director of the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford,\r\nfound that westerly winds were slightly more common (as compared with\r\nother winds) when sun-spots were numerous than when they were few.\r\n\r\nMr. Meldrum, of Mauritius, has made a series of statistical inquiries\r\ninto the records of cyclones which have traversed the Indian Ocean\r\nbetween the equator and 34 degrees south latitude, in each year from\r\n1856 to 1877, noting the total distances traversed by each, the sums\r\nof their radii and areas, their duration in days, the sums of their\r\ntotal areas, and their relative areas. His researches, be it marked\r\nin passing, are of extreme interest and value, whether the suggested\r\nconnection between sun-spots and cyclones (in the region specified)\r\nbe eventually found to be a real one or not. The following are his\r\nresults, as described in _Nature_ by a writer who manifestly favours\r\nvery strongly the doctrine that an intimate association exists between\r\nsolar maculation (or spottiness) and terrestrial meteorological\r\nphenomena:—\r\n\r\n“The period embraces two complete, or all but complete, sun-spot\r\nperiods, the former beginning with 1856 and ending in 1867, and the\r\nlatter extending from 1867 to about the present time [1877]. The broad\r\nresult is that the number of cyclones, the length and duration of\r\ntheir courses, and the extent of the earth’s surface covered by them\r\nall, reach the maximum in each sun-spot period during the years of\r\nmaximum maculation, and fall to the minimum during the years of minimum\r\nmaculation. The peculiar value of these results lies in the fact that\r\nthe portion of the earth’s surface over which this investigation\r\nextends, is, from its geographical position and what may be termed\r\nits meteorological homogeneity, singularly well fitted to bring out\r\nprominently any connection that may exist between the condition of the\r\nsun’s surface and atmospheric phenomena.”\r\n\r\nThe writer proceeds to describe an instance in which Mr. Meldrum\r\npredicted future meteorological phenomena, though without specifying\r\nthe exact extent to which Mr. Meldrum’s anticipations were fulfilled or\r\nthe reverse. “A drought commenced in Mauritius early in November,” he\r\nsays, “and Mr. Meldrum ventured (on December 21) to express publicly\r\nhis opinion that probably the drought would not break up till towards\r\nthe end of January, and that it might last till the middle of February,\r\nadding that up to these dates the rainfall of the island would probably\r\nnot exceed 50 per cent. of the mean fall. This opinion was an inference\r\ngrounded on past observations, which show that former droughts have\r\nlasted from about three to three and a half months, and that these\r\ndroughts have occurred in the years of minimum sun-spots, or, at all\r\nevents, in years when the spots were far below the average, such as\r\n1842, 1843, 1855, 1856, 1864, 1866, and 1867, and that now we are\r\nnear the minimum epoch of sun-spots. It was further stated that the\r\nprobability of rains being brought earlier by a cyclone was but slight,\r\nseeing that the season for cyclones is not till February or March, and\r\nthat no cyclone whatever visited Mauritius during 1853–56 and 1864–67,\r\nthe years of minimum sun-spots. From the immense practical importance\r\nof this application of the connection between sun-spots and weather\r\nto the prediction of the character of the weather of the ensuing\r\nseason, we shall look forward with the liveliest interest to a detailed\r\nstatement of the weather which actually occurred in that part of the\r\nIndian Ocean from November to March last [1876].”\r\n\r\nIt was natural that the great Indian famine, occurring at a time\r\nwhen sun-spots were nearly at a minimum, should by some be directly\r\nassociated with a deficiency of sun-spots. In this country, indeed,\r\nwe have had little reason, during the last two or three years of few\r\nsun-spots, to consider that drought is one of the special consequences\r\nto be attributed to deficient solar maculation. But in India it may\r\nbe different, or at least it may be different in Madras, for it has\r\nbeen satisfactorily proved that in some parts of India the rainfall\r\nincreases in inverse, not in direct proportion, to the extent of\r\nsolar maculation. Dr. Hunter has shown to the satisfaction of many\r\nthat at Madras there is “a cycle of rainfall corresponding with the\r\nperiod of solar maculation.” But Mr. E. D. Archibald, who is also\r\nthoroughly satisfied that the sun-spots affect the weather, remarks\r\nthat Dr. Hunter has been somewhat hasty in arguing that the same\r\nconditions apply throughout the whole of Southern India. “This hasty\r\ngeneralization from the results of one station situated in a vast\r\ncontinent, the rainfall of which varies completely, both in amount and\r\nthe season in which it falls, according to locality, has been strongly\r\ncontested by Mr. Blanford, the Government Meteorologist, who, in making\r\na careful comparison of the rainfalls of seven stations, three of which\r\n(Madras, Bangalore, and Mysore) are in Southern India, the others\r\nbeing Bombay, Najpore, Jubbulpore, and Calcutta, finds that, with the\r\nexception of Najpore in Central India, which shows some slight approach\r\nto the same cyclical variation which is so distinctly marked in the\r\nMadras registers, the rest of the stations form complete exceptions\r\nto the rule adduced for Madras, in many of them the hypothetical\r\norder of relation being reversed. Mr. Blanford, however, shows that,\r\nunderlying the above irregularities, a certain cyclical variation\r\nexists on the average at all the stations, the amount, nevertheless,\r\nbeing so insignificant (not more than 9 per cent. of the total falls)\r\nthat it could not be considered of sufficient magnitude to become a\r\ndirect factor in the production of famine. It thus appears that the\r\ncycle of rainfall which is considered to be the most important element\r\nin causing periodic famines has only been proved satisfactorily for\r\nthe town of Madras. It may perhaps hold for the Carnatic and Northern\r\nSiccars, the country immediately surrounding Madras, though perhaps,\r\nowing to the want of rainfall registers in these districts, evidence\r\nwith regard to this part is still wanting.” On this Mr. Archibald\r\nproceeds to remark that, though Dr. Hunter has been only partially\r\nsuccessful, the value of his able pamphlet is not diminished in any\r\nway, “an indirect effect of which has been to stimulate meteorological\r\ninquiry and research in the same direction throughout India. The\r\nmeteorology of this country (India), from its peculiar and tropical\r\nposition, is in such complete unison with any changes that may\r\narise from oscillations in the amount of solar radiation, and their\r\neffects upon the velocity and direction of the vapour-bearing winds,\r\nthat a careful study of it cannot fail to discover meteorological\r\nperiodicities in close connection with corresponding periods of solar\r\ndisturbance.” So, indeed, it would seem.\r\n\r\nThe hope that famines may be abated, or, at least, some of their most\r\ngrievous consequences forestalled by means of solar observatories, does\r\nnot appear very clearly made out. Rather it would seem that the proper\r\nthing to do is to investigate the meteorological records of different\r\nIndian regions, and consider the resulting evidence of cyclic changes\r\nwithout any special reference to sun-spots; for if sun-spots may cause\r\ndrought in one place, heavy rainfall in another, winds here and calms\r\nthere, it seems conceivable that the effects of sun-spots may differ at\r\ndifferent times, as they manifestly do in different places.\r\n\r\nLet us turn, however, from famines to shipwrecks. Perhaps, if we admit\r\nthat cyclones are more numerous, and blow more fiercely, and range\r\nmore widely, even though it be over one large oceanic region only, in\r\nthe sun-spot seasons than at other times, we may be assured, without\r\nfurther research, that shipwrecks will, on the whole, be more numerous\r\nnear the time of sun-spot maxima than near the time of sun-spot minima.\r\n\r\nThe idea that this may be so was vaguely shadowed forth in a poem of\r\nmany stanzas, called “The Meteorology of the Future: a Vision,” which\r\nappeared in _Nature_ for July 5, 1877. I do not profess to understand\r\nprecisely what the object of this poem may have been-—I mean, whether\r\nit is intended to support or not the theory that sun-spots influence\r\nthe weather. Several stanzas are very humorous, but the object of the\r\nhumour is not manifest. The part referred to above is as follows:—Poor\r\nJack lies at the bottom of the sea in 1881, and is asked in a spiritual\r\nway various questions as to the cause of his thus coming to grief. This\r\nhe attributed to the rottenness of the ship in which he sailed, to\r\nthe jobbery of the inspector, to the failure of the system of weather\r\ntelegraphing, and so forth. But, says the questioner, there was one\r\n\r\n    “In fame to none will yield,\r\n    He led the band who reaped renown\r\n    On India’s famine field.\r\n\r\n    “Was he the man to see thee die?\r\n    Thou wilt not tax him—come?\r\n    The dead man groaned—‘_I met my death\r\n    Through a sun-spot maximum_.’”\r\n\r\nThe first definite enunciation, however, of a relation between\r\nsun-spots and shipwrecks appeared in September, 1876. Mr. Henry\r\nJeula, in the _Times_ for September 19, stated that Dr. Hunter’s\r\nresearches into the Madras rainfall had led him to throw together the\r\nscanty materials available relating to losses posted on Lloyd’s loss\r\nbook, to ascertain if any coincidences existed between the varying\r\nnumber of such losses and Dr. Hunter’s results. “For,” he proceeds,\r\n“since the cycle of rainfall at Madras coincides, I am informed, with\r\nthe periodicity of the cyclones in the adjoining Bay of Bengal” (a\r\nrelation which is more than doubtful) “as worked out by the Government\r\nAstronomer at Mauritius” (whose researches, however, as we have seen,\r\nrelated to a region remote from the Bay of Bengal), “some coincidence\r\nbetween maritime casualties, rainfalls, and sun-spots appeared at\r\nleast possible.” In passing, I may note that if any such relation were\r\nestablished, it would be only an extension of the significance of\r\nthe cycle of cyclones, and could have no independent value. It would\r\ncertainly follow, if the cycle of cyclones is made out, that shipwrecks\r\nbeing more numerous, merchants would suffer, and we should have the\r\ninfluence of the solar spots asserting itself in the _Gazette_. From\r\nthe cyclic derangement of monetary and mercantile matters, again,\r\nother relations also cyclic in character would arise. But as all these\r\nmay be inferred from the cycle of cyclones once this is established,\r\nwe could scarcely find in their occurrence fresh evidence of the\r\nnecessity of that much begged-for solar observatory. The last great\r\nmonetary panic in this country, by the way, occurred in 1866, at a\r\ntime of minimum solar maculation. Have we here a decisive proof that\r\nthe sun rules the money market, the bank rate of discount rising to a\r\nmaximum as the sun-spots sink to a minimum, and _vice versâ_? The idea\r\nis strengthened by the fact that the American panic in 1873 occurred\r\nwhen spots were very numerous, and its effects have steadily subsided\r\nas the spots have diminished in number; for this shows that the sun\r\nrules the money market in America on a principle diametrically opposed\r\nto that on which he (manifestly) rules the money market in England,\r\nprecisely as the spots cause drought in Calcutta and plenteous rainfall\r\nat Madras, wet south-westers and dry south-westers at Oxford, and wet\r\nsouth-easters and dry south-easters at St. Petersburg. Surely it would\r\nbe unreasonable to refuse to recognize the weight of evidence which\r\nthus tells on both sides at once.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the sun’s influence upon shipwrecks.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeula was “only able to obtain data for two complete cycles of\r\neleven years, namely, from 1855 to 1876 inclusive, while the period\r\ninvestigated by Dr. Hunter extended from 1813 to 1876, and his\r\nobservations related to Madras and its neighbourhood only, while the\r\nlosses posted at Lloyd’s occurred to vessels of various countries, and\r\nhappened in different parts of the world. It was necessary to bring\r\nthese losses to some common basis of comparison, and the only available\r\none was the number of ‘British registered vessels of the United Kingdom\r\nand Channel Islands’—manifestly an arbitrary one. I consequently\r\ncast out the percentage of losses posted each year upon the number of\r\nregistered vessels for the same year, and also the percentage of losses\r\nposted in each of the eleven years of the two cycles upon the total\r\nposted in each complete cycle, thus obtaining two bases of comparison\r\nindependent of each other.”\r\n\r\nThe results may be thus presented:—\r\n\r\nTaking the four years of each cycle when sun-spots were least in\r\nnumber, Mr. Jeula found the mean percentage of losses in registered\r\nvessels of the United Kingdom and Channel Islands to be 11·13, and the\r\nmean percentage of losses in the total posted in the entire cycle of\r\neleven years to be 8·64.\r\n\r\nIn the four years when sun-spots were intermediate in number, that\r\nis in two years following the minimum and in two years preceding the\r\nminimum, the respective percentages were 11·91 and 9·21.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the three years when sun-spots were most numerous, these\r\npercentages were, respectively, 12·49 and 9·53.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may more clearly understand what is meant here by\r\npercentages, I explain that while the numbers 11·13, 11·91 and 12·49\r\nsimply indicate the average number of wrecks (per hundred of all\r\nthe ships registered) which occurred in the several years of the\r\neleven-years cycle, the other numbers, 8·64, 19·21, and 9·53, indicate\r\nthe average number of wrecks (per hundred of wrecks recorded) during\r\neleven successive years, which occurred in the several years of the\r\ncycle. The latter numbers seem more directly to the purpose; and as the\r\ntwo sets agree pretty closely, we may limit our attention to them.\r\n\r\nNow I would in the first place point out that it would have been well\r\nif the actual number or percentage had been indicated for each year of\r\nthe cycle, instead of for periods of four years, four years, and three\r\nyears. Two eleven-year cycles give in any case but meagre evidence,\r\nand it would have been well if the evidence had been given as fully\r\nas possible. If we had a hundred eleven-yearly cycles, and took the\r\naverages of wrecks for the four years of minimum solar maculation, the\r\nfour intermediate years, and the three years of maximum maculation,\r\nwe might rely with considerable confidence on the result, because\r\naccidental peculiarities one way or the other could be eliminated. But\r\nin two cycles only, such peculiarities may entirely mask any cyclic\r\nrelation really existing, and appear to indicate a relation which has\r\nno real existence. If the percentages had been given for each year,\r\nthe effect of such peculiarities would doubtless still remain, and the\r\nfinal result would not be more trustworthy than before; but we should\r\nhave a chance of deciding whether such peculiarities really exist or\r\nnot, and also of determining what their nature may be. As an instance\r\nin point, let me cite a case where, having only the results of a\r\nsingle cycle, we can so arrange them as to appear to indicate a cyclic\r\nassociation between sun-spots and rainfall, while, when we give them\r\nyear by year, such an association is discredited, to say the least.\r\n\r\nThe total rainfall at Port Louis, between the years 1855 and 1868\r\ninclusive, is as follows:—\r\n\r\n   In         _Rainfall._     _Condition of Sun._\r\n  1855       42·665  inches    Sun-spot minimum.\r\n  1856       46·230     „\r\n  1857       43·445     „\r\n  1858       35·506     „\r\n  1859       56·875     „\r\n  1860       45·166     „      Sun-spot maximum.\r\n  1861       68·733     „\r\n  1862       28·397     „\r\n  1863       33·420     „\r\n  1864       24·147     „\r\n  1865       44·730     „\r\n  1866       20·571     „      Sun-spot minimum.\r\n  1867       35·970     „\r\n  1868       64·180     „\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI think no one, looking at these numbers as they stand, can recognize\r\nany evidence of a cyclic tendency. If we represent the rainfall by\r\nordinates we get the accompanying figure, which shows the rainfall for\r\neighteen years, and again I think it may be said that a very lively\r\nimagination is required to recognize anything resembling that wave-like\r\nundulation which the fundamental law of statistics requires where\r\na cycle is to be made out from a single oscillation. Certainly the\r\nagreement between the broken curve of rainfall and the sun-spot curve\r\nindicated by the waved dotted line is not glaringly obvious. But when\r\nwe strike an average for the rainfall, in the way adopted by Mr. Jeula\r\nfor shipwrecks, how pleasantly is the theory of sun-spot influence\r\nillustrated by the Port Louis rainfall! Here is the result, as quoted\r\nby the high-priest of the new order of diviners, from the papers by Mr.\r\nMeldrum:—\r\n\r\n  Three minimum years—total rainfall      133·340\r\n  Three maximum years—total rainfall      170·774\r\n  Three minimum years—total rainfall      120·721\r\n\r\nNothing could be more satisfactory, but nothing, I venture to assert,\r\nmore thoroughly inconsistent with the true method of statistical\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nMay it not be that, underlying the broad results presented by Mr.\r\nJeula, there are similar irregularities?\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that the loss of ships depends, not only on a cause so\r\nirregularly variable (to all seeming) as wind-storms, but also on other\r\nmatters liable to constant change, as the variations in the state of\r\ntrade, the occurrence of wars and rumours of wars, special events, such\r\nas international exhibitions, and so forth, we perceive that an even\r\nwider range of survey is required to remove the effects of accidental\r\npeculiarities in their case, than in the case of rainfall, cyclones,\r\nor the like. I cannot but think, for instance, that the total number\r\nof ships lost in divers ways during the American war, and especially\r\nin its earlier years (corresponding with two of the three maximum\r\nyears of sun-spots) may have been greater, not merely absolutely but\r\nrelatively, than in other years. I think it conceivable, again, that\r\nduring the depression following the great commercial panic of 1866\r\n(occurring at a time of minimum solar maculation, as already noticed)\r\nthe loss of ships may have been to some degree reduced, relatively as\r\nwell as absolutely. We know that when trade is unusually active many\r\nships have sailed, and perhaps may still be allowed to sail (despite\r\nMr. Plimsoll’s endeavours), which should have been broken up; whereas\r\nin times of trade depression the ships actually afloat are likely\r\nto be, _on the average_, of a better class. So also, when, for some\r\nspecial reason, passenger traffic at sea is abnormally increased. I\r\nmerely mention these as illustrative cases of causes not (probably)\r\ndependent on sun-spots, which may (not improbably) have affected the\r\nresults examined by Mr. Jeula. I think it possible that those results,\r\nif presented for each year, would have indicated the operation of such\r\ncauses, naturally masked when sets of four years, four years, and three\r\nyears are taken instead of single years.\r\n\r\nI imagine that considerations such as these will have to be taken into\r\naccount and disposed of before it will be unhesitatingly admitted that\r\nsun-spots have any great effect in increasing the number of shipwrecks.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the doctrine of sun-spot influence—or, perhaps\r\nit would be more correct to say, the advocates of the endowment of\r\nsun-spot research—think differently on these and other points. Each\r\none of the somewhat doubtful relations discussed above is constantly\r\nreferred to by them as a demonstrated fact, and a demonstrative proof\r\nof the theory they advocate. For instance, Mr. Lockyer, in referring to\r\nMeldrum’s statistical researches into the frequency of cyclones, does\r\nnot hesitate to assert that according to these researches “the whole\r\nquestion of cyclones is merely a question of solar activity, and that\r\nif we wrote down in one column the number of cyclones in any given\r\nyear, and in another column the number of sun-spots in any given year,\r\nthere will be a strict relation between them—many sun-spots, many\r\nhurricanes; few sun-spots, few hurricanes.” ... And again, “Mr. Meldrum\r\nhas since found” (not merely “has since found reason to believe,” but\r\ndefinitely, “has since found”) “that what is true of the storms which\r\ndevastate the Indian Ocean is true of the storms which devastate the\r\nWest Indies; and on referring to the storms of the Indian Ocean, Mr.\r\nMeldrum points out that at those years where we have been quietly\r\nmapping the sun-spot maxima, the harbours were filled with wrecks, and\r\nvessels coming in disabled from every part of the Indian Ocean.” Again,\r\nMr. Balfour Stewart accepts Mr. Jeula’s statistics confidently as\r\ndemonstrating that there are most shipwrecks during periods of maximum\r\nsolar activity. Nor are the advocates of the new method of prediction\r\nat all doubtful as to the value of these relations in affording the\r\nbasis of a system of prediction. They do not tell us precisely _how_ we\r\nare to profit by the fact, if fact it is, that cyclones and shipwrecks\r\nmark the time of maximum solar maculation, and droughts and famine the\r\ntime of minimum. “If we can manage to get at these things,” says Mr.\r\nLockyer, “the power of prediction, that power which would be the most\r\nuseful one in meteorology, if we could only get at it, would be within\r\nour grasp.” And Mr. Balfour Stewart, in a letter to the _Times_, says,\r\n“If we are on the track of a discovery which will in time enable\r\nus to foretell the cycle of droughts, public opinion should demand\r\nthat the investigation be prosecuted with redoubled vigour and under\r\nbetter conditions. If forewarned be forearmed, then such research will\r\nultimately conduce to the saving of life both at times of maximum and\r\nminimum sun-spot frequency.”\r\n\r\nIf these hopes are really justified by the facts of the case, it would\r\nbe well that the matter should be as quickly as possible put to the\r\ntest. No one would be so heartless, I think, as to reject, through an\r\nexcess of scientific caution, a scheme which might issue in the saving\r\nof many lives from famine or from shipwreck. And on the other hand, no\r\none, I think, would believe so ill of his fellow-men as to suppose for\r\none moment that advantage could be taken of the sympathies which have\r\nbeen aroused by the Indian famine, or which may from time to time be\r\nexcited by the record of great disasters by sea and land, to advocate\r\nbottomless schemes merely for purposes of personal advancement. We must\r\nnow, perforce, believe that those who advocate the erection of new\r\nobservatories and laboratories for studying the physics of the sun,\r\nhave the most thorough faith in the scheme which they proffer to save\r\nour Indian population from famine and our seamen from shipwreck.\r\n\r\nBut they, on the other hand, should now also believe that those who\r\nhave described the scheme as entirely hopeless, do really so regard it.\r\nIf we exonerate them from the charge of responding to an appeal for\r\nfood by offering spectroscopes, they in turn should exonerate us from\r\nthe charge of denying spectroscopes to the starving millions of India\r\nthough knowing well that the spectroscopic track leads straight to\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge I cannot for my own part see even that small modicum\r\nof hope in the course suggested which would suffice to justify its\r\nbeing followed. In my opinion, one ounce of rice would be worth more\r\n(simply because it would be worth something) than ten thousand tons of\r\nspectroscopes. For what, in the first place, has been shown as to the\r\nconnection between meteorological phenomena and sun-spots? Supposing we\r\ngrant, and it is granting a great deal, that all the cycles referred\r\nto have been made out. They one and all affect averages only. The most\r\nmarked among them can so little be trusted in detail that while the\r\nmaximum of sun-spots agrees _in the main_ with an excess or defect of\r\nrain or wind, or of special rains with special winds, or the like, the\r\nactual year of maximum may present the exact reverse.\r\n\r\nOf what use can it be to know, for instance, that the three years of\r\nleast solar maculation will probably give a rainfall less than that\r\nfor the preceding or following three years, if the middle year of\r\nthe three, when the spots are most numerous of all, _may_ haply show\r\nplenteous rainfall? Or it may be the first of the three, or the last,\r\nwhich is thus well supplied, while a defect in the other two, or in one\r\nof the others, brings the total triennial rainfall below the average.\r\nWhat provision could possibly be made under such circumstances to meet\r\na contingency which may occur in any one of three years? or, at least,\r\nwhat provision could be made which would prove nearly so effective\r\nas an arrangement which could readily be made for keeping sufficient\r\nGovernment stores at suitable stations (that is, never allowing such\r\nstores to fall at the critical season in each year below a certain\r\nminimum), and sending early telegraphic information of unfavourable\r\nweather? Does any one suppose that the solar rice-grains are better\r\nworth watching for such a purpose than the terrestrial rice-grains, or\r\nthat it is not well within the resources of modern science and modern\r\nmeans of communication and transport, to make sufficient preparation\r\neach year for a calamity always possible in India? And be it noticed\r\nthat if, on the one hand, believers in solar safety from famine may\r\nurge that, in thus objecting to their scheme, I am opposing what might,\r\nin some year of great famine and small sun-spots, save the lives of\r\na greater number than would be saved by any system of terrestrial\r\nwatchfulness, I would point out, on the other, that the solar scheme,\r\nif it means anything at all, means special watchfulness at the minimum\r\nsun-spot season, and general confidence (so far as famine is concerned)\r\nat the season of maximum solar maculation; and that while as yet\r\nnothing has been really proved about the connection between sun-spots\r\nand famine, such confidence might prove to be a very dangerous mistake.\r\n\r\nSupposing even it were not only proved that sun-spots exert such and\r\nsuch effects, but that this knowledge can avail to help us to measures\r\nof special precaution, how is the study of the sun going to advance\r\nour knowledge? In passing, let it be remarked that already an enormous\r\nnumber of workers are engaged in studying the sun in every part of\r\nthe world. The sun is watched on every fine day, in every quarter of\r\nthe earth, with the telescope, analyzed with the spectroscope, his\r\nprominences counted and measured, his surface photographed, and so\r\nforth. What more ought to be or could be done? But that is not the main\r\npoint. If more could be done, what could be added to our knowledge\r\nwhich would avail in the way of prediction? “At present,” says Mr.\r\nBalfour Stewart, “the problem has not been pursued on a sufficiently\r\nlarge scale or in a sufficient number of places. If the attack is to\r\nbe continued, the skirmishers should give way to heavy guns, and these\r\nshould be brought to bear without delay now that the point of attack is\r\nknown.” In other words, now that we know, according to the advocates\r\nof these views, that meteorological phenomena follow roughly the great\r\nsolar-spot period, we should prosecute the attack in this direction,\r\nin order to find out—what? Minor periods, perhaps, with which\r\nmeteorological phenomena may still more roughly synchronize. Other such\r\nperiods are already known with which meteorological phenomena have\r\nnever yet been associated. New details of the sun’s surface? No one has\r\nyet pretended that any of the details already known, except the spots,\r\naffect terrestrial weather, and the idea that peculiarities so minute\r\nas hitherto to have escaped detection can do so, is as absurd, on the\r\nface of it, as the supposition that minute details in the structure\r\nof a burning coal, such details as could only be detected by close\r\nscrutiny, can affect the general quality and effects of the heat\r\ntransmitted by the coal, as part of a large fire, to the further side\r\nof a large room.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would urge this general argument against a theory which seems\r\nto me to have even less to recommend it to acceptance than the faith\r\nin astrology.[8] _If it requires, as we are so strongly assured, the\r\nmost costly observations, the employment of the heaviest guns (and\r\n“great guns” are generally expensive), twenty or thirty years of time,\r\nand the closest scrutiny and research, to prove that sun-spots affect\r\nterrestrial relations in a definite manner, effects so extremely\r\ndifficult to demonstrate cannot possibly be important enough to be\r\nworth predicting._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NEW WAYS OF MEASURING THE SUN’S DISTANCE._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the problem of determining the sun’s distance, which\r\nfor many ages was regarded as altogether insoluble, and which even\r\nduring later years had seemed fairly solvable in but one or two ways,\r\nshould be found, on closer investigation, to admit of many methods\r\nof solution. If astronomers should only be as fortunate hereafter in\r\ndealing with the problem of determining the distances of the stars,\r\nas they have been with the question of the sun’s distance, we may\r\nhope for knowledge respecting the structure of the universe such as\r\neven the Herschels despaired of our ever gaining. Yet this problem of\r\ndetermining star-distances does not seem more intractable, now, than\r\nthe problem of measuring the sun’s distance appeared only two centuries\r\nago. If we rightly view the many methods devised for dealing with the\r\neasier task, we must admit that the more difficult—which, by the way,\r\nis in reality infinitely the more interesting—cannot be regarded\r\nas so utterly hopeless as, with our present methods and appliances,\r\nit appears to be. True, we know only the distances of two or three\r\nstars, approximately, and have means of forming a vague opinion\r\nabout the distances of only a dozen others, or thereabouts, while at\r\ndistances now immeasurable lie six thousand stars visible to the eye,\r\nand twenty millions within range of the telescope. Yet, in Galileo’s\r\ntime, men might have argued similarly against all hope of measuring\r\nthe proportions of the solar system. “We know only,” they might have\r\nurged, “the distance of the moon, our immediate neighbour,—beyond\r\nher, at distances so great that hers, so far as we can judge, is by\r\ncomparison almost as nothing, lie the Sun and Mercury, Venus and Mars;\r\nfurther away yet lie Jupiter and Saturn, and possibly other planets,\r\nnot visible to the naked eye, but within range of that wonderful\r\ninstrument, the telescope, which our Galileo and others are using so\r\nsuccessfully. What hope can there be, when the exact measurement of the\r\nmoon’s distance has so fully taxed our powers of celestial measurement,\r\nthat we can ever obtain exact information respecting the distances of\r\nthe sun and planets? By what method is a problem so stupendous to be\r\nattacked?” Yet, within a few years of that time, Kepler had formed\r\nalready a rough estimate of the distance of the sun; in 1639, young\r\nHorrocks pointed to a method which has since been successfully applied.\r\nBefore the end of the seventeenth century Cassini and Flamsteed had\r\napproached the solution of the problem more nearly, while Hailey had\r\ndefinitely formulated the method which bears his name. Long before the\r\nend of the eighteenth century it was certainly known that the sun’s\r\ndistance lies between 85 millions of miles and 98 millions (Kepler,\r\nCassini, and Flamsteed had been unable to indicate any superior limit).\r\nAnd lastly, in our own time, half a score of methods, each subdivisible\r\ninto several forms, have been applied to the solution of this\r\nfundamental problem of observational astronomy.\r\n\r\nI propose now to sketch some new and very promising methods, which have\r\nbeen applied already with a degree of success arguing well for the\r\nprospects of future applications of the methods under more favourable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let us very briefly consider the methods which had\r\nbeen before employed, in order that the proper position of the new\r\nmethods may be more clearly recognized.\r\n\r\nThe plan obviously suggested at the outset for the solution of the\r\nproblem was simply to deal with it as a problem of surveying. It was\r\nin such a manner that the moon’s distance had been found, and the\r\nonly difficulty in applying the method to the sun or to any planet\r\nconsisted in the delicacy of the observations required. The earth being\r\nthe only surveying-ground available to astronomers in dealing with\r\nthis problem (in dealing with the problem of the stars’ distances they\r\nhave a very much wider field of operations), it was necessary that\r\na base-line should be measured on this globe of ours,—large enough\r\ncompared with our small selves, but utterly insignificant compared\r\nwith the dimensions of the solar system. The diameter of the earth\r\nbeing less than 8000 miles, the longest line which the observers could\r\ntake for base scarcely exceeded 6000 miles; since observations of the\r\nsame celestial object at opposite ends of a diameter necessarily imply\r\nthat the object is in the horizon of _both_ the observing stations\r\n(for precisely the same reason that two cords stretched from the ends\r\nof any diameter of a ball to a distant point touch the ball at those\r\nends). But the sun’s distance being some 92 millions of miles, a base\r\nof 6000 miles amounts to less than the 15,000th part of the distance\r\nto be measured. Conceive a surveyor endeavouring to determine the\r\ndistance of a steeple or rock 15,000 feet, or nearly three miles, from\r\nhim, with a base-line _one foot_ in length, and you can conceive the\r\ntask of astronomers who should attempt to apply the direct surveying\r\nmethod to determine the sun’s distance,—at least, you have one of\r\ntheir difficulties strikingly illustrated, though a number of others\r\nremain which the illustration does not indicate. For, after all, a\r\nbase one foot in length, though far too short, is a convenient one in\r\nmany respects: the observer can pass from one end to the other without\r\ntrouble—he looks at the distant object under almost exactly the same\r\nconditions from each end, and so forth. A base 6000 miles long for\r\ndetermining the sun’s distance is too short in precisely the same\r\ndegree, but it is assuredly not so convenient a base for the observer.\r\nA giant 36,000 miles high would find it as convenient as a surveyor\r\nsix feet high would find a one foot base-line; but astronomers, as\r\na rule, are less than 36,000 miles in height. Accordingly the same\r\nobserver cannot work at both ends of the base-line, and they have to\r\nsend out expeditions to occupy each station. All the circumstances\r\nof temperature, atmosphere, personal observing qualities, etc., are\r\nunlike at the two ends of the base-line. The task of measuring the\r\nsun’s distance directly is, in fact, at present beyond the power of\r\nobservational astronomy, wonderfully though its methods have developed\r\nin accuracy.\r\n\r\nWe all know how, by observations of Venus in transit, the difficulty\r\nhas been so far reduced that trustworthy results have been obtained.\r\nSuch observations belong to the surveying method, only Venus’s distance\r\nis made the object of measurement instead of the sun’s. The sun serves\r\nsimply as a sort of dial-plate, Venus’s position while in transit\r\nacross this celestial dial-plate being more easily measured than when\r\nshe is at large upon the sky. The devices by which Halley and Delisle\r\nseverally caused _time_ to be the relation observed, instead of\r\nposition, do not affect the general principle of the transit method. It\r\nremains dependent on the determination of position. Precisely as by the\r\nchange of the _position_ of the hands of a clock on the face we measure\r\n_time_, so by the transit method, as Halley and Delisle respectively\r\nsuggested its use, we determine Venus’s position on the sun’s face,\r\nby observing the difference of the time she takes in crossing, or the\r\ndifference of the time at which she begins to cross, or passes off, his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBesides the advantage of having a dial-face like the sun’s on which\r\nthus to determine positions, the transit method deals with Venus when\r\nat her nearest, or about 25 million miles from us, instead of the sun\r\nat his greater distance of from 90½ to 93½ millions of miles. Yet we\r\ndo not get the entire advantage of this relative proximity of Venus.\r\nFor the dial-face—the sun, that is—changes its position too—in less\r\ndegree than Venus changes hers, but still so much as largely to reduce\r\nher seeming displacement. The sun being further away as 92 to 25, is\r\nless displaced as 25 to 92. Venus’s displacement is thus diminished by\r\n25/92nds of its full amount, leaving only 67/92nds. Practically, then,\r\nthe advantage of observing Venus, so far as distance is concerned, is\r\nthe same as though, instead of being at a distance of only 25 million\r\nmiles, her distance were greater as 92 to 67, giving as her effective\r\ndistance when in transit some 34,300,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAll the methods of observing Venus in transit are affected in _this_\r\nrespect. Astronomers were not content during the recent transit to use\r\nHalley’s and Delisle’s two time methods (which may be conveniently\r\ncalled the duration method and the epoch method), but endeavoured to\r\ndetermine the position of Venus on the sun’s face directly, both by\r\nobservation and by photography. The heliometer was the instrument\r\nspecially used for the former purpose; and as, in one of the new\r\nmethods to be presently described, this is the most effective of all\r\navailable instruments, a few words as to its construction will not be\r\nout of place.\r\n\r\nThe heliometer, then, is a telescope whose object-glass (that is,\r\nthe large glass at the end towards the object observed) is divided\r\ninto two halves along a diameter. When these two halves are exactly\r\ntogether—that is, in the position they had before the glass was\r\ndivided—of course they show any object to which they may be directed\r\nprecisely as they would have done before the glass was cut. But if,\r\nwithout separating the straight edges of the two semicircular glasses,\r\none be made to slide along the other, the images formed by the two\r\nno longer coincide.[9] Thus, if we are looking at the sun we see\r\ntwo overlapping discs, and by continuing to turn the screw or other\r\nmechanism which carries our half-circular glass past the other, the\r\ndisc-images of the sun may be brought entirely clear of each other.\r\nThen we have two suns in the same field of view, seemingly in contact,\r\nor nearly so. Now, if we have some means of determining how far the\r\nmovable half-glass has been carried past the other to bring the two\r\ndiscs into apparently exact contact, we have, in point of fact, a\r\nmeasure of the sun’s apparent diameter. We can improve this estimate by\r\ncarrying back the movable glass till the images coincide again, then\r\nfurther back till they separate the other way and finally are brought\r\ninto contact on that side. The entire range, from contact on one side\r\nto contact on the other side, gives twice the entire angular span of\r\nthe sun’s diameter; and the half of this is more likely to be the true\r\nmeasure of the diameter, than the range from coincident images to\r\ncontact either way, simply because instrumental errors are likely to be\r\nmore evenly distributed over the double motion than over the movement\r\non either side of the central position. The heliometer derived its\r\nname—which signifies sun-measurer—from this particular application of\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen how the heliometer was made available in determining\r\nthe position of Venus at any instant during transit. The observer\r\ncould note what displacement of the two half-glasses was necessary to\r\nbring the black disc of Venus on one image of the sun to the edge of\r\nthe other image, first touching on the inside and then on the outside.\r\nThen, reversing the motion, he could carry her disc to the opposite\r\nedge of the other image of the sun, first touching on the inside and\r\nthen on the outside. Lord Lindsay’s private expedition—one of the\r\nmost munificent and also one of the most laborious contributions to\r\nastronomy ever made—was the only English expedition which employed\r\nthe heliometer, none of our public observatories possessing such an\r\ninstrument, and official astronomers being unwilling to ask Government\r\nto provide instruments so costly. The Germans, however, and the\r\nRussians employed the heliometer very effectively.\r\n\r\nNext in order of proximity, for the employment of the direct surveying\r\nmethod, is the planet Mars when he comes into opposition (or on the\r\nsame line as the earth and sun) in the order\r\n\r\n  Sun____________________________Earth__________Mars,\r\n\r\nat a favourable part of his considerably eccentric orbit. His distance\r\nthen may be as small as 34½ millions of miles; and we have in his case\r\nto make no reduction for the displacement of the background on which\r\nhis place is to be determined. That background is the star sphere,\r\nhis place being measured from that of stars near which his apparent\r\npath on the heavens carries him; and the stars are so remote that\r\nthe displacement due to a distance of six or seven thousand miles\r\nbetween two observers on the earth is to all intents and purposes\r\nnothing. The entire span of the earth’s orbit round the sun, though\r\namounting to 184 millions of miles, is a mere point as seen from all\r\nsave ten or twelve stars; how utterly evanescent, then, the span of\r\nthe earth’s globe—less than the 23,000th part of her orbital range!\r\nThus the entire displacement of Mars due to the distance separating\r\nthe terrestrial observers comes into effect. So that, in comparing the\r\nobservation of Mars in a favourable opposition with that of Venus in\r\ntransit, we may fairly say that, so far as surveying considerations are\r\nconcerned, the two planets are equally well suited for the astronomer’s\r\npurpose. Venus’s less distance of 25 millions of miles is effectively\r\nincreased to 34⅓ millions by the displacement of the solar background\r\non which we see her when in transit; while Mars’s distance of about\r\n34½ millions of miles remains effectively the same when we measure his\r\ndisplacement from neighbouring fixed stars.\r\n\r\nBut in many respects Mars is superior to Venus for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the sun’s distance. Venus can only be observed at her\r\nnearest when in transit, and transit lasts but a few hours. Mars can\r\nbe observed night after night for a fortnight or so, during which his\r\ndistance still remains near enough to the least or opposition distance.\r\nAgain, Venus being observed on the sun, all the disturbing influences\r\ndue to the sun’s heat are at work in rendering the observation\r\ndifficult. The air between us and the sun at such a time is disturbed\r\nby undulations due in no small degree to the sun’s action. It is true\r\nthat we have not, in the case of Mars, any means of substituting time\r\nmeasures or time determinations for measures of position, as we have\r\nin Venus’s case, both with Halley’s and Delisle’s methods. But to say\r\nthe truth, the advantage of substituting these time observations has\r\nnot proved so great as was expected. Venus’s unfortunate deformity of\r\nfigure when crossing the sun’s edge renders the determination of the\r\nexact moments of her entry on the sun’s face and of her departure from\r\nit by no means so trustworthy as astronomers could wish. On the whole,\r\nMars would probably have the advantage even without that point in his\r\nfavour which has now to be indicated.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of observing Mars for determining the sun’s distance are\r\navailable, both of which, as they can be employed in applying one of\r\nthe new methods, may conveniently be described at this point.\r\n\r\nAn observer far to the north of the earth’s equator sees Mars at\r\nmidnight, when the planet is in opposition, displaced somewhat to\r\nthe south of his true position—that is, of the position he would\r\nhave as supposed to be seen from the centre of the earth. On the\r\nother hand, an observer far to the south of the equator sees Mars\r\ndisplaced somewhat to the north of his true position. The difference\r\nmay be compared to different views of a distant steeple (projected,\r\nlet us suppose, against a much more remote hill), from the uppermost\r\nand lowermost windows of a house corresponding to the northerly and\r\nsoutherly stations on the earth, and from a window on the middle\r\nstory corresponding to a view of Mars from the earth’s centre. By\r\nascertaining the displacement of the two views of Mars obtained from\r\na station far to the north and another station far to the south,\r\nthe astronomer can infer the distance of the planet, and thence the\r\ndimensions of the solar system. The displacement is determinable by\r\nnoticing Mars’s position with respect to stars which chance to be close\r\nto him. For this purpose the heliometer is specially suitable, because,\r\nhaving first a view of Mars and some companion stars as they actually\r\nare placed, the observer can, by suitably displacing the movable\r\nhalf-glass, bring the star into apparent contact with the planet, first\r\non one side of its disc, and then on the other side—the mean of the\r\ntwo resulting measures giving, of course, the distance between the star\r\nand the centre of the disc.\r\n\r\nThis method requires that there shall be two observers, one at a\r\nnorthern station, as Greenwich, or Paris, or Washington, the other at\r\na southern station, as Cape Town, Cordoba, or Melbourne. The base-line\r\nis practically a north-and-south line; for though the two stations may\r\nnot lie in the same, or nearly the same, longitude, the displacement\r\ndetermined is in reality that due to their difference of latitude only,\r\na correction being made for their difference of longitude.\r\n\r\nThe other method depends, not on displacement of two observers north\r\nand south, or difference of latitude, but on displacement east and\r\nwest. Moreover, it does not require that there shall be two observers\r\nat stations far apart, but uses the observations made at one and the\r\nsame stations at different times. The earth, by turning on her axis,\r\ncarries the observer from the west to the east of an imaginary line\r\njoining the earth’s centre and the centre of Mars. When on the west\r\nof that line, or in the early evening, he sees Mars displaced towards\r\nthe east of the planet’s true position. After nine or ten hours the\r\nobserver is carried as far to the east of that line, and sees Mars\r\ndisplaced towards the west of his true position. Of course Mars has\r\nmoved in the interval. He is, in fact, in the midst of his retrograde\r\ncareer. But the astronomer knows perfectly well how to take that\r\nmotion into account. Thus, by observing the two displacements, or the\r\ntotal displacement of Mars from east to west on account of the earth’s\r\nrotation, one and the same observer can, in the course of a single\r\nfavourable night, determine the sun’s distance. And in passing, it may\r\nbe remarked that this is the only general method of which so much can\r\nbe said. By some of the others an astronomer can, indeed, estimate the\r\nsun’s distance without leaving his observatory—at least, theoretically\r\nhe can do so. But many years of observation would be required before he\r\nwould have materials for achieving this result. On the other hand, one\r\ngood pair of observations of Mars, in the evening and in the morning,\r\nfrom a station near the equator, would give a very fair measure of\r\nthe sun’s distance. The reason why the station should be near the\r\nequator will be manifest, if we consider that at the poles there\r\nwould be no displacement due to rotation; at the equator the observer\r\nwould be carried round a circle some twenty-five thousand miles in\r\ncircumference; and the nearer his place to the equator the larger\r\nthe circle in which he would be carried, and (_cæteris paribus_) the\r\ngreater the evening and morning displacement of the planet.\r\n\r\nBoth these methods have been successfully applied to the problem of\r\ndetermining the sun’s distance, and both have recently been applied\r\nafresh under circumstances affording exceptionally good prospects of\r\nsuccess, though as yet the results are not known.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, when we leave the direct surveying method to which\r\nboth the observations of Venus in transit and Mars in opposition\r\nbelong (in all their varieties), that the most remarkable, and, one\r\nmay say, unexpected methods of determining the sun’s distance present\r\nthemselves. Were not my subject a wide one, I would willingly descant\r\nat length on the marvellous ingenuity with which astronomers have\r\navailed themselves of every point of vantage whence they might measure\r\nthe solar system. But, as matters actually stand, I must be content\r\nto sketch these other methods very roughly, only indicating their\r\ncharacteristic features.\r\n\r\nOne of them is in some sense related to the method by actual survey,\r\nonly it takes advantage, not of the earth’s dimensions, but of the\r\ndimensions of her orbit round the common centre of gravity of herself\r\nand the moon. This orbit has a diameter of about six thousand miles;\r\nand as the earth travels round it, speeding swiftly onwards all the\r\ntime in her path round the sun, the effect is the same as though the\r\nsun, in his apparent circuit round the earth, were constantly circling\r\nonce in a lunar month around a small subordinate orbit of precisely the\r\nsame size and shape as that small orbit in which the earth circuits\r\nround the moon’s centre of gravity. He appears then sometimes displaced\r\nabout 3000 miles on one side, sometimes about 3000 miles on the other\r\nside of the place which he would have if our earth were not thus\r\nperturbed by the moon. But astronomers can note each day where he is,\r\nand thus learn by how much he seems displaced from his mean position.\r\nKnowing that his greatest displacement corresponds to so many miles\r\nexactly, and noting what it seems to be, they learn, in fact, how large\r\na span of so many miles (about 3000) looks at the sun’s distance.\r\nThus they learn the sun’s distance precisely as a rifleman learns the\r\ndistance of a line of soldiers when he has ascertained their apparent\r\nsize—for only at a certain distance can an object of known size have a\r\ncertain apparent size.\r\n\r\nThe moon comes in, in another way, to determine the sun’s distance\r\nfor us. We know how far away she is from the earth, and how much,\r\ntherefore, she approaches the sun when new, and recedes from him when\r\nfull. Calling this distance, roughly, a 390th part of the sun’s, her\r\ndistance from him when new, her mean distance, and her distance from\r\nhim when full, are as the numbers 389, 390, 391. Now, these numbers\r\ndo not quite form a continued proportion, though they do so very\r\nnearly (for 389 is to 390 as 390 to 391-1/400). If they were in exact\r\nproportion, the sun’s disturbing influence on the moon when she is at\r\nher nearest would be exactly equal to his disturbing influence on the\r\nmoon when at her furthest from him—or generally, the moon would be\r\nexactly as much disturbed (on the average) in that half of her path\r\nwhich lies nearer to the sun as in that half which lies further from\r\nhim. As matters are, there is a slight difference. Astronomers can\r\nmeasure this difference; and measuring it, they can ascertain what the\r\nactual numbers are for which I have roughly given the numbers 389, 390,\r\nand 391; in other words, they can ascertain in what degree the sun’s\r\ndistance exceeds the moon’s. This is equivalent to determining the\r\nsun’s distance, since the moon’s is already known.\r\n\r\nAnother way of measuring the sun’s distance has been “favoured”\r\nby Jupiter and his family of satellites. Few would have thought,\r\nwhen Römer first explained the delay which occurs in the eclipse of\r\nthese moons while Jupiter is further from us than his mean distance,\r\nthat that explanation would lead up to a determination of the sun’s\r\ndistance. But so it happened. Römer showed that the delay is not in the\r\nrecurrence of the eclipses, but in the arrival of the news of these\r\nevents. From the observed time required by light to traverse the extra\r\ndistance when Jupiter is nearly at his furthest from us, the time in\r\nwhich light crosses the distance separating us from the sun is deduced;\r\nwhence, if that distance has been rightly determined, the velocity of\r\nlight can be inferred. If this velocity is directly measured in any\r\nway, and found not to be what had been deduced from the adopted measure\r\nof the sun’s distance, the inference is that the sun’s distance has\r\nbeen incorrectly determined. Or, to put the matter in another way, we\r\nknow exactly how many minutes and seconds light takes in travelling to\r\nus from the sun; if, therefore, we can find out how fast light travels\r\nwe know how far away the sun is.\r\n\r\nBut who could hope to measure a velocity approaching 200,000 miles in a\r\nsecond? At a first view the task seems hopeless. Wheatstone, however,\r\nshowed how it might be accomplished, measuring by his method the yet\r\ngreater velocity of freely conducted electricity. Foucault and Fizeau\r\nmeasured the velocity of light; and recently Cornu has made more exact\r\nmeasurements. Knowing, then, how many miles light travels in a second,\r\nand in how many seconds it comes to us from the sun, we know the sun’s\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe first of the methods which I here describe as new methods must next\r\nbe considered. It is one which Leverrier regards as the method of the\r\nfuture. In fact, so highly does he esteem it, that, on its account, he\r\nmay almost be said to have refused to sanction in any way the French\r\nexpeditions for observing the transit of Venus in 1874.\r\n\r\nThe members of the sun’s family perturb each other’s motions in a\r\ndegree corresponding with their relative mass, compared with each\r\nother and with the sun. Now, it can be shown (the proof would be\r\nunsuitable to these pages,[10] but I have given it in my treatise\r\non “The Sun”) that no change in our estimate of the sun’s distance\r\naffects our estimate of his mean density as compared with the earth’s.\r\nHis substance has a mean density equal to one-fourth of the earth’s,\r\nwhether he be 90 millions or 95 millions of miles from us, or indeed\r\nwhether he were ten millions or a million million miles from us\r\n(supposing for a moment our measures did not indicate his real distance\r\nmore closely). We should still deduce from calculation the same\r\nunvarying estimate of his mean density. It follows that the nearer\r\nany estimate of his distance places him, and therefore the smaller it\r\nmakes his estimated volume, the smaller also it makes his estimated\r\nmass, and in precisely the same degree. The same is true of the planets\r\nalso. We determine Jupiter’s mass, for example (at least, this is the\r\nsimplest way), by noting how he swerves his moons at their respective\r\n(estimated) distances. If we diminish our estimate of their distances,\r\nwe diminish at the same time our estimate of Jupiter’s attractive\r\npower, and in such degree, it may be shown (see note), as precisely to\r\ncorrespond with our changed estimate of his size, leaving our estimate\r\nof his mean density unaltered. And the same is true for all methods of\r\ndetermining Jupiter’s mass. Suppose, then, that, adopting a certain\r\nestimate of the scale of the solar system, we find that the resulting\r\nestimate of the masses of the planets and of the sun, _as compared with\r\nthe earth’s mass_, from their observed attractive influences on bodies\r\ncircling around them or passing near them, accords with their estimated\r\nperturbing action as compared with the earth’s,—then we should infer\r\nthat our estimate of the sun’s distance or of the scale of the solar\r\nsystem was correct. But suppose it appeared, on the contrary, that\r\nthe earth took a larger or a smaller part in perturbing the planetary\r\nsystem than, according to our estimate of her relative mass, she\r\nshould do,—then we should infer that the masses of the other members\r\nof the system had been overrated or underrated; or, in other words,\r\nthat the scale of the solar system had been overrated or underrated\r\nrespectively. Thus we should be able to introduce a correction into our\r\nestimate of the sun’s distance.\r\n\r\nSuch is the principle of the method by which Leverrier showed that in\r\nthe astronomy of the future the scale of the solar system may be very\r\nexactly determined. Of course, the problem is a most delicate one. The\r\nearth plays, in truth, but a small part in perturbing the planetary\r\nsystem, and her influence can only be distinguished satisfactorily\r\n(at present, at any rate) in the case of the nearer members of the\r\nsolar family. Yet the method is one which, unlike others, will have\r\nan accumulative accuracy, the discrepancies which are to test the\r\nresult growing larger as time proceeds. The method has already been\r\nto some extent successful. It was, in fact, by observing that the\r\nmotions of Mercury are not such as can be satisfactorily explained by\r\nthe perturbations of the earth and Venus according to the estimate of\r\nrelative masses deducible from the lately discarded value of the sun’s\r\ndistance, that Leverrier first set astronomers on the track of the\r\nerror affecting that value. He was certainly justified in entertaining\r\na strong hope that hereafter this method will be exceedingly effective.\r\n\r\nWe come next to a method which promises to be more quickly if not more\r\neffectively available.\r\n\r\nVenus and Mars approach the orbit of our earth more closely than any\r\nother planets, Venus being our nearest neighbour on the one side, and\r\nMars on the other. Looking beyond Venus, we find only Mercury (and the\r\nmythical Vulcan), and Mercury can give no useful information respecting\r\nthe sun’s distance. He could scarcely do so even if we could measure\r\nhis position among the stars when he is at his nearest, as we can\r\nthat of Mars; but as he can only then be fairly seen when he transits\r\nthe sun’s face, and as the sun is nearly as much displaced as Mercury\r\nby change in the observer’s station, the difference between the two\r\ndisplacements is utterly insufficient for accurate measurement. But,\r\nwhen we look beyond the orbit of Mars, we find certain bodies which are\r\nwell worth considering in connection with the problem of determining\r\nthe sun’s distance. I refer to the asteroids, the ring of small planets\r\ntravelling between the paths of Mars and Jupiter, but nearer (on the\r\nwhole[11]) to the path of Mars than to that of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe asteroids present several important advantages over even Mars and\r\nVenus.\r\n\r\nOf course, none of the asteroids approach so near to the earth as Mars\r\nat his nearest. His least distance from the sun being about 127 million\r\nmiles, and the earth’s mean distance about 92 millions, with a range of\r\nabout a million and a half on either side, owing to the eccentricity of\r\nher orbit, it follows that he _may_ be as near as some 35 million miles\r\n(rather less in reality) from the earth when the sun, earth, and Mars\r\nare nearly in a straight line and in that order. The least distance of\r\nany asteroid from the sun amounts to about 167 million miles, so that\r\ntheir least distance from the earth cannot at any time be less than\r\nabout 73,500,000 miles, even if the earth’s greatest distance from\r\nthe sun corresponded with the least distance of one of these closely\r\napproaching asteroids. This, by the way, is not very far from being the\r\ncase with the asteroid Ariadne, which comes within about 169 million\r\nmiles of the sun at her nearest, her place of nearest approach being\r\nalmost exactly in the same direction from the sun as the earth’s place\r\nof greatest recession, reached about the end of June. So that, whenever\r\nit so chances that Ariadne comes into opposition in June, or that the\r\nsun, earth, and Ariadne are thus placed—\r\n\r\n  Sun________Earth________Ariadne,\r\n\r\nAriadne will be but about 75,500,000 miles from the earth. Probably no\r\nasteroid will ever be discovered which approaches the earth much more\r\nnearly than this; and this approach, be it noticed, is not one which\r\ncan occur in the case of Ariadne except at very long intervals.\r\n\r\nBut though we may consider 80 millions of miles as a fair average\r\ndistance at which a few of the most closely approaching asteroids may\r\nbe observed, and though this distance seems very great by comparison\r\nwith Mars’s occasional opposition distance of 35 million miles, yet\r\nthere are two points in which asteroids have the advantage over Mars.\r\nFirst, they are many, and several among them can be observed under\r\nfavourable circumstances; and in the multitude of observations there\r\nis safety. In the second place, which is the great and characteristic\r\ngood quality of this method of determining the sun’s distance, they do\r\nnot present a disc, like the planet Mars, but a small star-like point.\r\nWhen we consider the qualities of the heliometric method of measuring\r\nthe apparent distance between celestial objects, the advantage of\r\npoints of light over discs will be obvious. If we are measuring the\r\napparent distance between Mars and a star, we must, by shifting the\r\nmovable object-glass, bring the star’s image into apparent contact\r\nwith the disc-image of Mars, first on one side and then on the other,\r\ntaking the mean for the distance between the centres. Whereas, when we\r\ndetermine the distance between a star and an asteroid, we have to bring\r\ntwo star-like points (one a star, the other the asteroid) into apparent\r\ncoincidence. We can do this in two ways, making the result so much the\r\nmore accurate. For consider what we have in the field of view when the\r\ntwo halves of the object-glass coincide. There is the asteroid and\r\nclose by there is the star whose distance we seek to determine in order\r\nto ascertain the position of the asteroid on the celestial sphere.\r\nWhen the movable half is shifted, the two images of star and asteroid\r\nseparate; and by an adjustment they can be made to separate along the\r\nline connecting them. Suppose, then, we first make the movable image\r\nof the asteroid travel away from the fixed image (meaning by movable\r\nand fixed images, respectively, those given by the movable and fixed\r\nhalves of the object-glass), towards the fixed image of the star—the\r\ntwo points, like images, being brought into coincidence, we have the\r\nmeasure of the distance between star and asteroid. Now reverse the\r\nmovement, carrying back the movable images of the asteroid and star\r\ntill they coincide again with their fixed images. This movement gives\r\nus a second measure of the distance, which, however, may be regarded as\r\nonly a reversed repetition of the preceding. But now, carrying on the\r\nreverse motion, the moving images of star and asteroid separate from\r\ntheir respective fixed images, the moving image of the star drawing\r\nnear to the fixed image of the asteroid and eventually coinciding with\r\nit. Here we have a third measure of the distance, which is independent\r\nof the two former. Reversing the motion, and carrying the moving\r\nimages to coincidence with the fixed images, we have a fourth measure,\r\nwhich is simply the third reversed. These four measures will give a\r\nfar more satisfactory determination of the true apparent distance\r\nbetween the star and the asteroid than can, under any circumstances,\r\nbe obtained in the case of Mars and a star. Of course, a much more\r\nexact determination is required to give satisfactory measures of the\r\nasteroid’s real distance from the earth in miles, for a much smaller\r\nerror would vitiate the estimate of the asteroid’s distance than would\r\nvitiate to the same degree the estimate of Mars’s distance: for the\r\napparent displacements of the asteroid as seen either from Northern and\r\nSouthern stations, or from stations east and west of the meridian, are\r\nvery much less than in the case of Mars, owing to his great proximity.\r\nBut, on the whole, there are reasons for believing that the advantage\r\nderived from the nearness of Mars is almost entirely counterbalanced\r\nby the advantage derived from the neatness of the asteroid’s image.\r\nAnd the number of asteroids, with the consequent power of repeating\r\nsuch measurements many times for each occasion on which Mars has been\r\nthus observed, seem to make the asteroids—so long regarded as very\r\nunimportant members of the solar system—the bodies from which, after\r\nall, we shall gain our best estimate of the sun’s distance; that is, of\r\nthe scale of the solar system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the above pages were written, the results deduced from the\r\nobservations made by the British expeditions for observing the transit\r\nof December 9, 1874, have been announced by the Astronomer Royal.\r\nIt should be premised that they are not the results deducible from\r\nthe entire series of British observations, for many of them can only\r\nbe used effectively in combination with observations made by other\r\nnations. For instance, the British observations of the duration of the\r\ntransit as seen from Southern stations are only useful when compared\r\nwith observations of the duration of the transit as seen from Northern\r\nstations, and no British observations of this kind were taken at\r\nNorthern stations, or could be taken at any of the British Northern\r\nstations except one, where chief reliance was placed on photographic\r\nmethods. The only British results as yet “worked up” are those which\r\nare of themselves sufficient, theoretically, to indicate the sun’s\r\ndistance, viz., those which indicated the epochs of the commencement of\r\ntransit as seen from Northern and Southern stations, and those which\r\nindicated the epochs of the end of transit as seen from such stations.\r\nThe Northern and Southern epochs of commencement compared together\r\nsuffice _of themselves_ to indicate the sun’s distance; so also do the\r\nepochs of the end of transit suffice _of themselves_ for that purpose.\r\nSuch observations belong to the Delislean method, which was the subject\r\nof so much controversy for two or three years before the transit took\r\nplace. Originally it had been supposed that only observations by that\r\nmethod were available, and the British plans were formed upon that\r\nassumption. When it was shown that this assumption was altogether\r\nerroneous, there was scarcely time to modify the British plans so that\r\nof themselves they might provide for the other or Halleyan method.\r\nBut the Southern stations which were suitable for that method were\r\nstrengthened; and as other nations, especially America and Russia,\r\noccupied large numbers of Northern stations, the Halleyan method was,\r\nin point of fact, effectually provided for—a fortunate circumstance,\r\nas will presently be seen.\r\n\r\nThe British operations, then, thus far dealt with, were based on\r\nDelisle’s method; and as they were carried out with great zeal and\r\ncompleteness, we may consider that the result affords an excellent\r\ntest of the qualities of this method, and may supply a satisfactory\r\nanswer to the questions which were under discussion in 1872–74. Sir\r\nGeorge Airy, indeed, considers that the zeal and completeness with\r\nwhich the British operations were carried out suffice to set the\r\nresult obtained from them above all others. But this opinion is based\r\nrather on personal than on strictly scientific grounds. It appears to\r\nme that the questions to be primarily decided are whether the results\r\nare in satisfactory agreement (i) _inter se_ and (ii) with the general\r\ntenor of former researches. In other words, while the Astronomer Royal\r\nconsiders that the method and the manner of its application must\r\nbe considered so satisfactory that the results are to be accepted\r\nunquestionably, it appears to me that the results must be carefully\r\nquestioned (as it were) to see whether the method, and the observations\r\nby it, are satisfactory. In the first place, the result obtained\r\nfrom Northern and Southern observations of the commencement ought to\r\nagree closely with the result obtained from Northern and Southern\r\nobservations of the end of transit. Unfortunately, they differ rather\r\nwidely. The sun’s distance by the former observations comes out about\r\none million miles greater than the distance determined by the latter\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThis should be decisive, one would suppose. But it is not all.\r\nThe mean of the entire series of observations by Delisle’s method\r\ncomes out nearly one million miles greater than the mean deduced by\r\nProfessor Newcomb from many entire series of observations by six\r\ndifferent methods, all of which may fairly be regarded as equal in\r\nvalue to Delisle’s, while three are regarded by most astronomers as\r\nunquestionably superior to it. Newcomb considers the probable limits of\r\nerror in his evaluation from so many combined series of observations\r\nto be about 100,000 miles. Sir G. Airy will allow no wider limits of\r\nerror for the result of the one series his observers have obtained than\r\n200,000 miles. Thus the greatest value admitted by Newcomb falls short\r\nof the least value admitted by Sir G. Airy, by nearly 700,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe obvious significance of this result should be, one would suppose,\r\nthat Delisle’s method is not quite so effective as Sir G. Airy\r\nsupposed; and the wide discordance between the several results, of\r\nwhich the result thus deduced is the mean, should prove this, one\r\nwould imagine, beyond all possibility of question. The Astronomer\r\nRoyal thinks differently, however. In his opinion, the wide difference\r\nbetween his result and the mean of all the most valued results by other\r\nastronomers, indicates the superiority of Delisle’s method, not its\r\ninadequacy to the purpose for which it has been employed.\r\n\r\nTime will shortly decide which of these views is correct; but, for my\r\nown part, I do not hesitate to express my own conviction that the sun’s\r\ndistance lies very near the limits indicated by Newcomb, and therefore\r\nis several hundred thousand miles less than the minimum distance\r\nallowed by the recently announced results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIFTING LIGHT-WAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method of measuring the motion of very swiftly travelling bodies\r\nby noting changes in the light-waves which reach us from them—one\r\nof the most remarkable methods of observation ever yet devised by\r\nman—has recently been placed upon its trial, so to speak; with results\r\nexceedingly satisfactory to the students of science who had accepted\r\nthe facts established by it. The method will not be unfamiliar to many\r\nof my readers. The principle involved was first noted by M. Doppler,\r\nbut not in a form which promised any useful results. The method\r\nactually applied appears to have occurred simultaneously to several\r\npersons, as well theorists as observers. Thus Secchi claimed in March,\r\n1868, to have applied it though unsuccessfully; Huggins in April, 1868,\r\ndescribed his successful use of the method. I myself, wholly unaware\r\nthat either of these observers was endeavouring to measure celestial\r\nmotions by its means, described the method, in words which I shall\r\npresently quote, in the number of _Fraser’s Magazine_ for January,\r\n1868, two months before the earliest enunciation of its nature by the\r\nphysicists just named.\r\n\r\nIt will be well briefly to describe the principle of this interesting\r\nmethod, before considering the attack to which it has been recently\r\nsubjected, and its triumphant acquittal from defects charged against\r\nit. This brief description will not only be useful to those readers who\r\nchance not to be acquainted with the method, but may serve to remove\r\nobjections which suggest themselves, I notice, to many who have had\r\nthe principle of the method imperfectly explained to them.\r\n\r\nLight travels from every self-luminous body in waves which sweep\r\nthrough the ether of space at the rate of 185,000 miles per second.\r\nThe whole of that region of space over which astronomers have extended\r\ntheir survey, and doubtless a region many millions of millions of times\r\nmore extended, may be compared to a wave-tossed sea, only that instead\r\nof a wave-tossed surface, there is wave-tossed space. At every point,\r\nthrough every point, along every line, athwart every line, myriads of\r\nlight-waves are at all times rushing with the inconceivable velocity\r\njust mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is from such waves that we have learned all we know about the\r\nuniverse outside our own earth. They bring to our shores news from\r\nother worlds, though the news is not always easy to decipher.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that we are thus immersed in an ocean, athwart which\r\ninfinite series of waves are continually rushing, and moreover that\r\nwe ourselves, and every one of the bodies whence the waves proceed\r\neither directly or after reflection, are travelling with enormous\r\nvelocity through this ocean, the idea naturally presents itself that we\r\nmay learn something about these motions (as well as about the bodies\r\nthemselves whence they proceed), by studying the aspect of the waves\r\nwhich flow in upon us in all directions.\r\n\r\nSuppose a strong swimmer who knew that, were he at rest, a certain\r\nseries of waves would cross him at a particular rate—ten, for\r\ninstance, in a minute—were to notice that when he was swimming\r\ndirectly facing them, eleven passed him in a minute: he would be able\r\nat once to compare his rate of swimming with the rate of the waves’\r\nmotion. He would know that while ten waves had passed him on account\r\nof the waves’ motion, he had by his own motion caused yet another wave\r\nto pass him, or in other words, had traversed the distance from one\r\nwave-crest to the next Thus he would know that his rate was one-tenth\r\nthat of the waves. Similarly if, travelling the same way as the waves,\r\nhe found that only nine passed him in a minute, instead of ten.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is not difficult to see that if an observer were at rest,\r\nand a body in the water, which by certain motions produced waves,\r\nwere approaching or receding from the observer, the waves would come\r\nin faster in the former case, slower in the latter, than if the body\r\nwere at rest. Suppose, for instance, that some machinery at the bows\r\nof a ship raised waves which, if the ship were at rest, would travel\r\nalong at the rate of ten a minute past the observer’s station. Then\r\nclearly, if the ship approached him, each successive wave would have\r\na shorter distance to travel, and so would reach him sooner than it\r\notherwise would have done. Suppose, for instance, the ship travelled\r\none-tenth as fast as the waves, and consider ten waves proceeding from\r\nher bows—the first would have to travel a certain distance before\r\nreaching the observer; the tenth, starting a minute later, instead of\r\nhaving to travel the same distance, would have to travel this distance\r\ndiminished by the space over which the ship had passed in one minute\r\n(which the wave itself passes over in the tenth of a minute); instead,\r\nthen, of reaching the observer one minute after the other, it would\r\nreach him nine-tenths of a minute after the first. Thus it would seem\r\nto him as though the waves were coming in faster than when the ship was\r\nat rest, in the proportion of ten to nine, though in reality they would\r\nbe travelling at the same rate as before, only arriving in quicker\r\nsuccession, because of the continual shortening of the distance they\r\nhad to travel, on account of the ship’s approach. If he knew precisely\r\nhow fast they _would_ arrive if the ship were at rest, and determined\r\nprecisely how fast they _did_ arrive, he would be able to determine at\r\nonce the rate of the ship’s approach, at least the proportion between\r\nher rate and the rate of the waves’ motion. Similarly if, owing to the\r\nship’s recession, the apparent rate of the waves’ motion were reduced,\r\nit is obvious that the actual change in the wave motion would not be\r\na difference of rate; but, in the case of the approaching ship, the\r\nbreadth from crest to crest would be reduced, while in the case of a\r\nreceding ship the distance from crest to crest would be increased.\r\n\r\nIf the above explanation should still seem to require closer attention\r\nthan the general reader may be disposed to give, the following,\r\nsuggested by a friend of mine—a very skilful mathematician—will be\r\nfound still simpler: Suppose a stream to flow quite uniformly, and that\r\nat one place on its banks an observer is stationed, while at another\r\nhigher up a person throws corks into the water at regular intervals,\r\nsay ten corks per minute; then these will float down and pass the other\r\nobserver, wherever he may be, at the rate of ten per minute, _if_\r\nthe cork-thrower is at rest. But if he saunters either up-stream or\r\ndown-stream, the corks will no longer float past the other at the exact\r\nrate of ten per minute. If the thrower is sauntering down-stream, then,\r\nbetween throwing any cork and the next, he has walked a certain way\r\ndown, and the tenth cork, instead of having to travel the same distance\r\nas the first before reaching the observer, has a shorter distance to\r\ntravel, and so reaches that observer sooner. Or in fact, which some may\r\nfind easier to see, this cork will be nearer to the first cork than it\r\nwould have been if the thrower had remained still. The corks will lie\r\nat equal distances from each other, but these equal distances will be\r\nless than they would have been if the observer had been at rest. If, on\r\nthe contrary, the cork-thrower saunters up-stream, the corks will be\r\nsomewhat further apart than if he had remained at rest. And supposing\r\nthe observer to know beforehand that the corks would be thrown in\r\nat the rate of ten a minute, he would know, if they passed him at a\r\ngreater rate than ten a minute (or, in other words, at a less distance\r\nfrom each other than the stream traversed in the tenth of a minute),\r\nthat the cork-thrower was travelling down-stream or approaching him;\r\nwhereas, if fewer than ten a minute passed him, he would know that the\r\ncork-thrower was travelling away from him, or up-stream. But also, if\r\nthe cork-thrower were at rest, and the observer moved up-stream—that\r\nis, towards him—the corks would pass him at a greater rate than ten a\r\nminute; whereas, if the observer were travelling down-stream, or from\r\nthe thrower, they would pass him at a slower rate. If both were moving,\r\nit is easily seen that if their movement brought them nearer together,\r\nthe number of corks passing the observer per minute would be increased,\r\nwhereas if their movements set them further apart, the number passing\r\nhim per minute would be diminished.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations, derived from the motions of water, suffice in\r\nreality for our purpose. The waves which are emitted by luminous\r\nbodies in space travel onwards like the water-waves or the corks of\r\nthe preceding illustrations. If the body which emits them is rapidly\r\napproaching us, the waves are set closer together or narrowed; whereas,\r\nif the body is receding, they are thrown further apart or broadened.\r\nAnd if we can in any way recognize such narrowing or broadening of the\r\nlight-waves, we know just as certainly that the source of light is\r\napproaching us or receding from us (as the case may be) as our observer\r\nin the second illustration would know from the distance between the\r\ncorks whether his friend, the cork-thrower, was drawing near to him or\r\ntravelling away from him.\r\n\r\nBut it may be convenient to give another illustration, drawn from\r\nwaves, which, like those of light, are not themselves discernible\r\nby our senses—I refer to those aerial waves of compression and\r\nrarefaction which produce what we call sound. These waves are not\r\nonly in this respect better suited than water-waves to illustrate\r\nour subject, but also because they travel in all directions through\r\naerial space, not merely along a surface. The waves which produce\r\na certain note, that is, which excite in our minds, through the\r\nauditory nerve, the impression corresponding to a certain tone, have\r\na definite length. So long as the observer, and a source of sound\r\nvibrating in one particular period, remain both in the same place,\r\nthe note is unchanged in tone, though it may grow louder or fainter\r\naccording as the vibrations increase or diminish in amplitude. But if\r\nthe source of sound is approaching the hearer, the waves are thrown\r\ncloser together and the sound is rendered more acute (the longer waves\r\ngiving the deeper sound); and, on the other hand, if the source of\r\nsound is receding from the hearer, the waves are thrown further apart\r\nand the sound is rendered graver. The _rationale_ of these changes is\r\nprecisely the same as that of the changes described in the preceding\r\nillustrations. It might, perhaps, appear that in so saying we were\r\ndismissing the illustration from sound, at least as an independent\r\none, because we are explaining the illustration by preceding\r\nillustrations. But in reality, while there is absolutely nothing\r\nnew to be said respecting the increase and diminution of distances\r\n(as between the waves and corks of the preceding illustration),\r\nthe illustration from sound has the immense advantage of admitting\r\nreadily of experimental tests. It is necessary only that the rate of\r\napproach or recession should bear an appreciable proportion to the\r\nrate at which sound travels. For waves are shortened or lengthened by\r\napproach or recession by an amount which bears to the entire length of\r\nthe wave the same proportion which the rate of approach or recession\r\nbears to the rate of the wave’s advance. Now it is not very difficult\r\nto obtain rates of approach or recession fairly comparable with the\r\nvelocity of sound—about 364 yards per second. An express train at\r\nfull speed travels, let us say, about 1800 yards per minute, or 30\r\nyards per second. Such a velocity would suffice to reduce all the\r\nsound-waves proceeding from a bell or whistle upon the engine, by\r\nabout one-twelfth part, for an observer at rest on a station platform\r\napproached by the engine. On the contrary, after the engine had passed\r\nhim, the sound-waves proceeding from the same bell or whistle would be\r\nlengthened by one-twelfth. The difference between the two tones would\r\nbe almost exactly three semitones. If the hearer, instead of being on\r\na platform, were in a train carried past the other at the same rate,\r\nthe difference between the tone of the bell in approaching and its\r\ntone in receding would be about three tones. It would not be at all\r\ndifficult so to arrange matters, that while two bells were sounding the\r\nsame note—_Mi_, let us say—one bell on one engine the other on the\r\nother, a traveller by one should hear his own engine’s bell, the bell\r\nof the approaching engine, and the bell of the same engine receding,\r\nas the three notes—_Do_—_Mi_—_Sol_, whose wave-lengths are as the\r\nnumbers 15, 12, and 10. We have here differences very easily to be\r\nrecognized even by those who are not musicians. Every one who travels\r\nmuch by train must have noticed how the tone of a whistle changes as\r\nthe engine sounding it travels past. The change is not quite sharp,\r\nbut very rapid, because the other engine does not approach with a\r\ncertain velocity up to a definite moment and then recede with the same\r\nvelocity. It could only do this by rushing through the hearer, which\r\nwould render the experiment theoretically more exact but practically\r\nunsatisfactory. As it rushes past instead of through him, there is a\r\nbrief time during which the rate of approach is rapidly being reduced\r\nto nothing, followed by a similarly brief time during which the rate of\r\nrecession gradually increases from nothing up to the actual rate of the\r\nengines’ velocities added together.[12] The change of tone may be thus\r\nillustrated:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA B representing the sound of the approaching whistle, B C representing\r\nthe rapid degradation of sound as the engine rushes close past the\r\nhearer, and C D representing the sound of the receding whistle. When\r\na bell is sounded on the engine, as in America, the effect is better\r\nrecognized, as I had repeated occasion to notice during my travels in\r\nthat country. Probably this is because the tone of a bell is in any\r\ncase much more clearly recognized than the tone of a railway whistle.\r\nThe change of tone as a clanging bell is carried swiftly past (by the\r\ncombined motions of both trains) is not at all of such a nature as to\r\nrequire close attention for its detection.\r\n\r\nHowever, the apparent variation of sound produced by rapid approach or\r\nrecession has been tested by exact experiments. On a railway uniting\r\nUtrecht and Maarsen “were placed,” the late Professor Nichol wrote,\r\n“at intervals of something upwards of a thousand yards, three groups\r\nof musicians, who remained motionless during the requisite period.\r\nAnother musician on the railway sounded at intervals one uniform note;\r\nand its effects on the ears of the stationary musicians have been\r\nfully published. From these, certainly—from the recorded changes\r\nbetween grave and the more acute, and _vice versâ_,—confirming, even\r\n_numerically_, what the relative velocities might have enabled one to\r\npredict, it appears justifiable to conclude that the general theory is\r\ncorrect; and that the note of any sound may be greatly modified, if\r\nnot wholly changed, by the velocity of the individual hearing it,” or,\r\nhe should have added, by the velocity of the source of sound: perhaps\r\nmore correct than either, is the statement that the note may be altered\r\nby the approach or recession of the source of sound, whether that be\r\ncaused by the motion of the sounding body, or of the hearer himself, or\r\nof both.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, indeed, to understand how doubt can exist in the\r\nmind of any one competent to form an opinion on the matter, though,\r\nas we shall presently see, some students of science and one or two\r\nmathematicians have raised doubts as to the validity of the reasoning\r\nby which it is shown that a change should occur. That the reasoning is\r\nsound cannot, in reality, be questioned, and after careful examination\r\nof the arguments urged against it by one or two mathematicians, I\r\ncan form no other opinion than that these arguments amount really\r\nbut to an expression of inability to understand the matter. This\r\nmay seem astonishing, but is explained when we remember that some\r\nmathematicians, by devoting their attention too particularly to special\r\ndepartments, lose, to a surprising degree, the power of dealing with\r\nsubjects (even mathematical ones) outside their department. Apart\r\nfrom the soundness of the reasoning, the facts are unmistakably in\r\naccordance with the conclusion to which the reasoning points. Yet some\r\nfew still entertain doubts, a circumstance which may prove a source of\r\nconsolation to any who find themselves unable to follow the reasoning\r\non which the effects of approach and recession on wave-lengths depend.\r\nLet such remember, however, that experiment in the case of the aerial\r\nwaves producing sound, accords perfectly with theory, and that the\r\nwaves which produce light are perfectly analogous (so far as this\r\nparticular point is concerned) with the waves producing sound.\r\n\r\nOrdinary white light, and many kinds of coloured light, may be compared\r\nwith _noise_—that is, with a multitude of intermixed sounds. But light\r\nof one pure colour may be compared to sound of one determinate note.\r\nAs the aerial waves producing the effect of one definite tone are all\r\nof one length, so the ethereal waves producing light of one definite\r\ncolour are all of one length. Therefore if we approach or recede from a\r\nsource of light emitting such waves, effects will result corresponding\r\nwith what has been described above for the case of water-waves and\r\nsound-waves. If we approach the source of light, or if it approaches\r\nus, the waves will be shortened; if we recede from it, or if it\r\nrecedes from us, the waves will be lengthened. But the colour of light\r\ndepends on its wave-length, precisely as the tone of sound depends on\r\nits wave-length. The waves producing red light are longer than those\r\nproducing orange light, these are longer than the waves producing\r\nyellow light; and so the wave-lengths shorten down from yellow to\r\ngreen, thence to blue, to indigo, and finally to violet. Thus if a body\r\nshining in reality with a pure green colour, approached the observer\r\nwith a velocity comparable with that of light, it would seem blue,\r\nindigo, or violet, according to the rate of approach; whereas if it\r\nrapidly receded, it would seem yellow, orange, or red, according to the\r\nrate of recession.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in one sense, though very fortunately in many much more\r\nimportant respects, the rates of motion among the celestial bodies are\r\n_not_ comparable with the velocity of light, but are always so much\r\nless as to be almost rest by comparison. The velocity of light is about\r\n187,000 miles per second, or, according to the measures of the solar\r\nsystem at present in vogue (which will shortly have to give place to\r\nsomewhat larger measures, the result of observations made upon the\r\nrecent transit of Venus), about 185,000 miles per second. The swiftest\r\ncelestial motion of which we have ever had direct evidence was that of\r\nthe comet of the year 1843, which, at the time of its nearest approach\r\nto the sun, was travelling at the rate of about 350 miles per second.\r\nThis, compared with the velocity of light, is as the motion of a person\r\ntaking six steps a minute, each less than half a yard long, to the\r\nrush of the swiftest express train. No body within our solar system\r\ncan travel faster than this, the motion of a body falling upon the sun\r\nfrom an infinite distance being only about 370 miles per second when it\r\nreaches his surface. And though swifter motions probably exist among\r\nthe bodies travelling around more massive suns than ours, yet of such\r\nmotions we can never become cognizant. All the motions taking place\r\namong the stars themselves would appear to be very much less in amount.\r\nThe most swiftly moving sun seems to travel but at the rate of about 50\r\nor 60 miles per second.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider how far a motion of 100 miles per second might be\r\nexpected to modify the colour of pure green light—selecting green as\r\nthe middle colour of the spectrum. The waves producing green light\r\nare of such a length, that 47,000 of them scarcely equal in length a\r\nsingle inch. Draw on paper an inch and divide it carefully into ten\r\nequal parts, or take such parts from a well-divided rule; divide one\r\nof these tenths into ten equal parts, as nearly as the eye will permit\r\nyou to judge; then one of these parts, or about half the thickness of\r\nan average pin, would contain 475 of the waves of pure green light.\r\nThe same length would equal the length of 440 waves of pure yellow\r\nlight, and of 511 waves of pure blue light. (The green, yellow, and\r\nblue, here spoken of, are understood to be of the precise colour of\r\nthe middle of the green, yellow, and blue parts of the spectrum.) Thus\r\nthe green waves must be increased in the proportion of 475 to 440 to\r\ngive yellow light, or reduced in the proportion of 511 to 475 to give\r\nblue light. For the first purpose, the velocity of recession must bear\r\nto the velocity of light the proportion which 30 bears to 475, or\r\nmust be equal to rather more than one-sixteenth part of the velocity\r\nof light—say 11,600 miles per second. For the second purpose, the\r\nvelocity of approach must bear to the velocity of light the proportion\r\nwhich 36 bears to 475, or must be nearly equal to one-thirteenth part\r\nof the velocity of light—say 14,300 miles per second. But the motions\r\nof the stars and other celestial bodies, and also the motions of matter\r\nin the sun, and so forth, are very much less than these. Except in the\r\ncase of one or two comets (and always dismissing from consideration\r\nthe amazing apparent velocities with which comets’ tails _seem_ to\r\nbe formed), we may take 100 miles per second as the extreme limit of\r\nvelocity with which we have to deal, in considering the application\r\nof our theory to the motions of recession and approach of celestial\r\nbodies. Thus in the case of recession the greatest possible change\r\nof colour in pure green light would be equivalent to the difference\r\nbetween the medium green of the spectrum, and the colour 1-116th part\r\nof the way from medium green to medium yellow; and in the case of\r\napproach, the change would correspond to the difference between the\r\nmedium green and the colour 1-143rd part of the way from medium green\r\nto medium blue. Let any one look at a spectrum of fair length, or even\r\nat a correctly tinted painting of the solar spectrum, and note how\r\nutterly unrecognizable to ordinary vision is the difference of tint for\r\neven the twentieth part of the distance between medium green and medium\r\nyellow on one side or medium blue on the other, and he will recognize\r\nhow utterly hopeless it would be to attempt to appreciate the change\r\nof colour due to the approach or recession of a luminous body shining\r\nwith pure green light and moving at the tremendous rate of 100 miles\r\nper second. It would be hopeless, even though we had the medium green\r\ncolour and the changed colour, either towards yellow or towards blue,\r\nplaced side by side for comparison—how much more when the changed\r\ncolour would have to be compared with the observer’s recollection of\r\nthe medium colour, as seen on some other occasion!\r\n\r\nBut this is the least important of the difficulties affecting the\r\napplication of this method by noting change of colour, as Doppler\r\noriginally proposed. Another difficulty, which seems somehow to have\r\nwholly escaped Doppler’s attention, renders the colour test altogether\r\nunavailable. We do not get _pure_ light from any of the celestial\r\nbodies except certain gaseous clouds or nebulæ. From every sun we get,\r\nas from our own sun, all the colours of the rainbow. There may be an\r\nexcess of some colours and a deficiency of others in any star, so as\r\nto give the star a tint, or even a very decided colour. But even a\r\nblood-red star, or a deep-blue or violet star, does not shine with\r\npure light, for the spectroscope shows that the star has other colours\r\nthan those producing the prevailing tint, and it is only the great\r\n_excess_ of red rays (all kinds of red, too) or of blue rays (of all\r\nkinds), and so on, which makes the star appear red, or blue, and so on,\r\nto the eye. By far the greater number of stars or suns show all the\r\ncolours of the rainbow nearly equally distributed, as in the case of\r\nour own sun. Now imagine for a moment a white sun, which had been at\r\nrest, to begin suddenly to approach us so rapidly (travelling more than\r\n10,000 miles per second) that the red rays became orange, the orange\r\nbecame yellow, the yellow green, the green blue, the blue indigo, the\r\nindigo violet, while the violet waves became too short to affect the\r\nsense of sight. Then, _if that were all_, that sun, being deprived of\r\nthe red part of its light, would shine with a slightly bluish tinge,\r\nowing to the relative superabundance of rays from the violet end of\r\nthe spectrum. We should be able to recognize such a change, yet not\r\nnearly so distinctly as if that sun had been shining with a pure green\r\nlight, and suddenly beginning to approach us at the enormous rate just\r\nmentioned, changed in colour to full blue. _Though_, if that sun were\r\nall the time approaching us at the enormous rate imagined, we should be\r\nquite unable to tell whether its slightly bluish tinge were due to such\r\nmotion of approach or to some inherent blueness in the light emitted by\r\nthe star. Similarly, if a white sun suddenly began to recede so rapidly\r\nthat its violet rays were turned to indigo, the indigo to blue, and\r\nso on, the orange rays turning to red, and the red rays disappearing\r\naltogether, then, _if that were all_, its light would become slightly\r\nreddish, owing to the relative superabundance of light from the red\r\nend of the spectrum; and we might distinguish the change, yet not so\r\nreadily as if a sun shining with pure green light began to recede at\r\nthe same enormous rate, and so shone with pure yellow light. _Though_,\r\nif that sun were all the time receding at that enormous rate, we should\r\nbe quite unable to tell whether its slightly reddish hue were due to\r\nsuch motion of recession or to some inherent redness in its own lustre.\r\n_But in neither case would that be all._ In the former, the red rays\r\nwould indeed become orange; but the rays beyond the red, which produce\r\nno effect upon vision, would be converted into red rays, and fill up\r\nthe part of the spectrum deserted by the rays originally red. In the\r\nlatter, the violet rays would indeed become indigo; but the rays beyond\r\nthe violet, ordinarily producing no visible effect, would be converted\r\ninto violet rays, and fill up the part of the spectrum deserted by the\r\nrays originally violet. Thus, despite the enormous velocity of approach\r\nin one case and of recession in the other, there would be no change\r\nwhatever in the colour of the sun in either case. All the colours of\r\nthe rainbow would still be present in the sun’s light, and it would\r\ntherefore still be a white sun.\r\n\r\nDoppler’s method would thus fail utterly, even though the stars were\r\ntravelling hither and thither with motions a hundred times greater than\r\nthe greatest known stellar motions.\r\n\r\nThis objection to Doppler’s theory, as originally proposed, was\r\nconsidered by me in an article on “Coloured Suns” in _Fraser’s\r\nMagazine_ for January, 1868. His theory, indeed, was originally\r\npromulgated not as affording a means of measuring stellar motions, but\r\nas a way of accounting for the colours of double stars. It was thus\r\npresented by Professor Nichol, in a chapter of his “Architecture of the\r\nHeavens,” on this special subject:—“The rapid motion of light reaches\r\nindeed one of those numbers which reason owns, while imagination ceases\r\nto comprehend them; but it is also true that the swiftness with which\r\ncertain individuals of the double stars sweep past their perihelias,\r\nor rather their periasters, is amazing; and in this matter of colours,\r\nit must be recollected that the question solely regards the difference\r\nbetween the velocities of the waves constituent of colours, at those\r\ndifferent stellar positions. Still it is a bold—even a magnificent\r\nidea; and if it can be reconciled with the permanent colours of the\r\nmultitude of stars surrounding us—stars which too are moving in great\r\norbits with immense velocities—it may be hailed almost as a positive\r\ndiscovery. It must obtain confirmation, or otherwise, so soon as we\r\ncan compare with certainty the observed colorific changes of separate\r\nsystems with the known fluctuations of their orbital motions.”\r\n\r\nThat was written a quarter of a century ago, when spectroscopic\r\nanalysis, as we now know it, had no existence. Accordingly, while the\r\nfatal objection to Doppler’s original theory is overlooked on the\r\none hand, the means of applying the principle underlying the theory,\r\nin a much more exact manner than Doppler could have hoped for, is\r\noverlooked on the other. Both points are noted in the article above\r\nreferred to, in the same paragraph. “We may dismiss,” I there stated,\r\n“the theory started some years ago by the French astronomer, M.\r\nDoppler.” But, I presently added, “It is quite clear that the effects\r\nof a motion rapid enough to produce such a change” (_i.e._ a change\r\nof tint in a pure colour) “would shift the position of the whole\r\nspectrum—and this change would be readily detected by a reference\r\nto the spectral lines.” This is true, even to the word “readily.”\r\nVelocities which would produce an appreciable change of tint would\r\nproduce “readily” detectible changes in the position of the spectral\r\nlines; the velocities actually existing among the star-motions would\r\nproduce changes in the position of these lines detectible only with\r\nextreme difficulty, or perhaps in the majority of instances not\r\ndetectible at all.\r\n\r\nIt has been in this way that the spectroscopic method has actually been\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive the essential difference between this way of\r\napplying the method and that depending on the attempted recognition\r\nof changes of colour. A dark line in the spectrum marks in reality\r\nthe place of a missing tint. The tints next to it on either side are\r\npresent, but the tint between them is wanting. They are changed in\r\ncolour—very slightly, in fact quite inappreciably—by motions of\r\nrecession or approach, or, in other words, they are shifted in position\r\nalong the spectrum, towards the red end for recession, towards the\r\nviolet end for approach; and of course the dark space between is\r\nshifted along with them. One may say that the missing tint is changed.\r\nFor in reality that is precisely what would happen. If the light of\r\na star at rest gave every tint of the spectrum, for instance, except\r\nmid-green alone, and that star approached or receded so swiftly that\r\nits motion would change pure green light to pure yellow in one case,\r\nor pure blue in the other, then the effect on the spectrum of such a\r\nstar would be to throw the dark line from the middle of the green part\r\nof the spectrum to the middle of the yellow part in one case, or to\r\nthe middle of the blue part in the other. The dark line would be quite\r\nnotably shifted in either case. With the actual stellar motions, though\r\nall the lines are more or less shifted, the displacement is always\r\nexceedingly minute, and it becomes a task of extreme difficulty to\r\nrecognize, and still more to measure, such displacement.\r\n\r\nWhen I first indicated publicly (January, 1868) the way in which\r\nDoppler’s principle could alone be applied, two physicists, Huggins\r\nin England and Secchi in Italy, were actually endeavouring, with the\r\nexcellent spectroscopes in their possession, to apply this method. In\r\nMarch, 1868, Secchi gave up the effort as useless, publicly announcing\r\nthe plan on which he had proceeded and his failure to obtain any\r\nresults except negative ones. A month later Huggins also publicly\r\nannounced the plan on which he had been working, but was also able\r\nto state that in one case, that of the bright star Sirius, he had\r\nsucceeded in measuring a motion in the line of sight, having discovered\r\nthat Sirius was receding from the earth at the rate of 41·4 miles per\r\nsecond. I say was receding, because a part of the recession at the time\r\nof observation was due to the earth’s orbital motion around the sun. I\r\nhad, at his request, supplied Huggins with the formula for calculating\r\nthe correction due to this cause, and, applying it, he found that\r\nSirius is receding from the sun at the rate of about 29½ miles per\r\nsecond, or some 930 millions of miles per annum.\r\n\r\nI am not here specially concerned to consider the actual results of the\r\napplication of this method since the time of Huggins’s first success;\r\nbut the next chapter of the history of the method is one so interesting\r\nto myself personally that I feel tempted briefly to refer to details.\r\nSo soon as I had heard of Huggins’s success with Sirius, and that an\r\ninstrument was being prepared for him wherewith he might hope to extend\r\nthe method to other stars, I ventured to make a prediction as to the\r\nresult which he would obtain whensoever he should apply it to five\r\nstars of the seven forming the so-called Plough. I had found reason\r\nto feel assured that these five form a system drifting all together\r\namid stellar space. Satisfied for my own part as to the validity of\r\nthe evidence, I submitted it to Sir J. Herschel, who was struck by\r\nits force. The apparent drift of those stars was, of course, a thwart\r\ndrift; but if they really were drifting in space, then their motions in\r\nthe line of sight must of necessity be alike. My prediction, then, was\r\nthat whensoever Huggins applied to those stars the new method he would\r\nfind them either all receding at the same rate, or all approaching at\r\nthe same rate, or else that all _alike_ failed to give any evidence at\r\nall either of recession or approach. I had indicated the five in the\r\nfirst edition of my “Other Worlds”—to wit, the stars of the Plough,\r\nomitting the nearest “pointer” to the pole and the star marking the\r\nthird horse (or the tip of the Great Bear’s tail). So soon as Huggins’s\r\nnew telescope and its spectroscopic adjuncts were in working order, he\r\nre-examined Sirius, determined the motions of other stars; and at last\r\non one suitable evening he tested the stars of the Plough. He began\r\nwith the nearest pointer, and found that star swiftly approaching the\r\nearth. He turned to the other pointer, and found it rapidly receding\r\nfrom the earth. Being under the impression that my five included both\r\npointers, he concluded that my prediction had utterly failed, and so\r\nwent on with his observations, altogether unprejudiced in its favour,\r\nto say the least. The next star of the seven he found to be receding\r\nat the same rate as the second pointer; the next at the same rate,\r\nthe next, and the next receding still at the same rate, and lastly\r\nthe seventh receding at a different rate. Here, then, were five stars\r\nall receding at a common rate, and of the other two one receding at\r\na different rate, the other swiftly approaching. Turning next to the\r\nwork containing my prediction, Huggins found that the five stars thus\r\nreceding at a common rate were the five whose community of motion I\r\nhad indicated two years before. Thus the first prediction ever made\r\nrespecting the motions of the so-called fixed stars was not wanting in\r\nsuccess. I would venture to add that the theory of star-drift, on the\r\nstrength of which the prediction was made, was in effect demonstrated\r\nby the result.\r\n\r\nThe next application of the new method was one of singular interest. I\r\nbelieve it was Mr. Lockyer who first thought of applying the method to\r\nmeasure the rate of solar hurricanes as well as the velocities of the\r\nuprush and downrush of vaporous matter in the atmosphere of the sun.\r\nAnother spectroscopic method had enabled astronomers to watch the rush\r\nof glowing matter from the edge of the sun, by observing the coloured\r\nflames and their motions; but by the new method it was possible to\r\ndetermine whether the flames at the edge were swept by solar cyclones\r\ncarrying them from or towards the eye of the terrestrial observer,\r\nand also to determine whether glowing vapours over the middle of the\r\nvisible disc were subject to motion of uprush, which of course would\r\ncarry them towards the eye, or of downrush, which would carry them\r\nfrom the eye. The result of observations directed to this end was to\r\nshow that at least during the time when the sun is most spotted, solar\r\nhurricanes of tremendous violence take place, while the uprushing and\r\ndownrushing motions of solar matter sometimes attain a velocity of more\r\nthan 100 miles per second.\r\n\r\nIt was this success on the part of an English spectroscopist which\r\ncaused that attack on the new method against which it has but recently\r\nbeen successfully defended, at least in the eyes of those who are\r\nsatisfied only by experimental tests of the validity of a process.\r\nThe Padre Secchi had failed, as we have seen, to recognize motions of\r\nrecession and approach among the stars by the new method. But he had\r\ntaken solar observation by spectroscopic methods under his special\r\ncharge, and therefore when the new results reached his ears he felt\r\nbound to confirm or invalidate them. He believed that the apparent\r\ndisplacement of dark lines in the solar spectrum might be due to the\r\nheat of the sun causing changes in the delicate adjustments of the\r\ninstrument—a cause of error against which precautions are certainly\r\nvery necessary. He satisfied himself that when sufficient precautions\r\nare taken no displacements take place such as Lockyer, Young, and\r\nothers claimed to have seen. But he submitted the matter to a further\r\ntest. As the sun is spinning swiftly on his axis, his mighty equator,\r\nmore than two and a half millions of miles in girth, circling once\r\nround in about twenty-four days, it is clear that on one side the sun’s\r\nsurface is swiftly moving _towards_, and on the other side as swiftly\r\nmoving _from_, the observer. By some amazing miscalculation, Secchi\r\nmade the rate of this motion 20 miles per second, so that the sum of\r\nthe two motions in opposite directions would equal 40 miles per second.\r\nHe considered that he ought to be able by the new method, if the new\r\nmethod is trustworthy at all, to recognize this marked difference\r\nbetween the state of the sun’s eastern and western edges; he found on\r\ntrial that he could not do so; and accordingly he expressed his opinion\r\nthat the new method is not trustworthy, and that the arguments urged in\r\nits favour are invalid.\r\n\r\nThe weak point in his reasoning resided in the circumstance that the\r\nsolar equator is only moving at the rate of about 1¼ miles per second,\r\nso that instead of a difference of 40 miles per second between the\r\ntwo edges, which should be appreciable, the actual difference (that\r\nis, the sum of the two equal motions in opposite directions) amounts\r\nonly to 2½ miles per second, which certainly Secchi could not hope to\r\nrecognize with the spectroscopic power at his disposal. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen the error in his reasoning was pointed out, though he admitted\r\nthat error, he maintained the justice of his conclusion; just as\r\nCassini, having mistakenly reasoned that the degrees of latitude should\r\ndiminish towards the pole instead of increasing, and having next\r\nmistakenly found, as he supposed, that they do diminish, acknowledged\r\nthe error of his reasoning, but insisted on the validity of his\r\nobservations,—maintaining thenceforth, as all the world knows, that\r\nthe earth is extended instead of flattened at the poles.\r\n\r\nHuggins tried to recognize by the new method the effects of the sun’s\r\nrotation, using a much more powerful spectroscope than Secchi’s. The\r\nhistory of the particular spectroscope he employed is in one respect\r\nspecially interesting to myself, as the extension of spectroscopic\r\npower was of my own devising before I had ever used or even seen a\r\npowerful spectroscope. The reader is aware that spectroscopes derive\r\ntheir light-sifting power from the prisms forming them. The number\r\nof prisms was gradually increased, from Newton’s single prism to\r\nFraunhofer’s pair, and to Kirchhoff’s battery of four, till six were\r\nused, which bent the light round as far as it would go. Then the idea\r\noccurred of carrying the light to a higher level (by reflections)\r\nand sending it back through the same battery of prisms, doubling the\r\ndispersion. Such a battery, if of six prisms, would spread the spectral\r\ncolours twice as widely apart as six used in the ordinary way, and\r\nwould thus have a dispersive power of twelve prisms. It occurred\r\nto me that after taking the rays through six prisms, arranged in a\r\ncurve like the letter C, an intermediate four-cornered prism of a\r\nparticular shape (which I determined) might be made to send the rays\r\ninto another battery of six prisms, the entire set forming a double\r\ncurve like the letter S, the rays being then carried to a higher level\r\nand back through the double battery. In this way a dispersive power of\r\nnineteen prisms could be secured. My friend, Mr. Browning, the eminent\r\noptician, made a double battery of this kind,[13] which was purchased\r\nby Mr. W. Spottiswoode, and by him lent to Mr. Huggins for the express\r\npurpose of dealing with the task Secchi had set spectroscopists. It\r\ndid not, however, afford the required evidence. Huggins considered\r\nthe displacement of dark lines due to the sun’s rotation to be\r\nrecognizable, but so barely that he could not speak confidently on the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThere for a while the matter rested. Vögel made observations confirming\r\nHuggins’s results relative to stellar motions; but Vögel’s instrumental\r\nmeans were not sufficiently powerful to render his results of much\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nBut recently two well-directed attacks have been made upon this\r\nproblem, one in England, the other in America, and in both cases with\r\nsuccess. Rather, perhaps, seeing that the method had been attacked and\r\nwas supposed to require defence, we may say that two well-directed\r\nassaults have been made upon the attacking party, which has been\r\ncompletely routed.\r\n\r\nArrangements were made not very long ago, by which the astronomical\r\nwork of Greenwich Observatory, for a long time directed almost\r\nexclusively to time observations, should include the study of the sun,\r\nstars, planets, and so forth. Amongst other work which was considered\r\nsuited to the National Observatory was the application of spectroscopic\r\nanalysis to determine motions of recession and approach among the\r\ncelestial bodies. Some of these observations, by the way, were made, we\r\nare told, “to test the truth of Doppler’s principle,” though it seems\r\ndifficult to suppose for an instant that mathematicians so skilful as\r\nthe chief of the Observatory and some of his assistants could entertain\r\nany doubt on that point. Probably it was intended by the words just\r\nquoted to imply simply that some of the observations were made for the\r\npurpose of illustrating the principle of the method. We are not to\r\nsuppose that on a point so simple the Greenwich observers have been in\r\nany sort of doubt.\r\n\r\nAt first their results were not very satisfactory. The difficulties\r\nwhich had for a long time foiled Huggins, and which Secchi was never\r\nable to master, rendered the first Greenwich measures of stellar\r\nmotions in the line of sight wildly inconsistent, not only with\r\nHuggins’s results, but with each other.\r\n\r\nSecchi was not slow to note this. He renewed his objections to the new\r\nmethod of observation, pointing and illustrating them by referring to\r\nthe discrepancies among the Greenwich results. But recently a fresh\r\nseries of results has been published, showing that the observers\r\nat Greenwich have succeeded in mastering some at least among the\r\ndifficulties which they had before experienced. The measurements\r\nof star-motions showed now a satisfactory agreement with Huggins’s\r\nresults, and their range of divergence among themselves was greatly\r\nreduced. The chief interest of the new results, however, lay in the\r\nobservations made upon bodies known to be in motion in the line of\r\nsight at rates already measured. These observations, though not wanted\r\nas tests of the accuracy of the principle, were very necessary as tests\r\nof the qualities of the instruments used in applying it. It is here and\r\nthus that Secchi’s objections alone required to be met, and here and\r\nthus they have been thoroughly disposed of. Let us consider what means\r\nexist within the solar system for thus testing the new method.\r\n\r\nThe earth travels along in her orbit at the rate of about 18⅓ miles\r\nin every second of time. Not to enter into niceties which could only\r\nproperly be dealt with mathematically, it may be said that with this\r\nfull velocity she is at times approaching the remoter planets of the\r\nsystem, and at times receding from them; so that here at once is a\r\nrange of difference amounting to about 37 miles per second, and fairly\r\nwithin the power of the new method of observation. For it matters\r\nnothing, so far as the new method is concerned, whether the earth is\r\napproaching another orb by her motion, or that orb approaching by its\r\nown motion. Again, the plant Venus travels at the rate of about 21½\r\nmiles per second, but as the earth travels only 3 miles a second less\r\nswiftly, and the same way round, only a small portion of Venus’s motion\r\never appears as a motion of approach towards or recession from the\r\nearth. Still, Venus is sometimes approaching and sometimes receding\r\nfrom the earth, at a rate of more than 8 miles per second. Her light\r\nis much brighter than that of Jupiter or Saturn, and accordingly this\r\nsmaller rate of motion would be probably more easily recognized than\r\nthe greater rate at which the giant planets are sometimes approaching\r\nand at other times receding from the earth. At least, the Greenwich\r\nobservers seem to have confined their attention to Venus, so far as\r\nmotions of planets in the line of sight are concerned. The moon, as\r\na body which keeps always at nearly the same distance from us, would\r\nof course be the last in the world to be selected to give positive\r\nevidence in favour of the new method; but she serves to afford a useful\r\ntest of the qualities of the instruments employed. If when these were\r\napplied to her they gave evidence of motions of recession or approach\r\nat the rate of several miles per second, when we know as a matter of\r\nfact that the moon’s distance never[14] varies by more than 30,000\r\nmiles during the lunar month, her rate of approach or recession thus\r\naveraging about one-fiftieth part of a mile per second, discredit\r\nwould be thrown on the new method—not, indeed, as regards its\r\nprinciple, which no competent reasoner can for a moment question, but\r\nas regards the possibility of practically applying it with our present\r\ninstrumental means.\r\n\r\nObservations have been made at Greenwich, both on Venus and on the\r\nmoon, by the new method, with results entirely satisfactory. The method\r\nshows that Venus is receding when she is known to be receding, and\r\nthat she is approaching when she is known to be approaching. Again,\r\nthe method shows no signs of approach or recession in the moon’s case.\r\nIt is thus in satisfactory agreement with the known facts. Of course\r\nthese results are open to the objection that the observers have known\r\nbeforehand what to expect, and that expectation often deceives the\r\nmind, especially in cases where the thing to be observed is not at all\r\neasy to recognize. It will presently be seen that the new method has\r\nbeen more satisfactorily tested, in this respect, in other ways. It may\r\nbe partly due to the effect of expectation that in the case of Venus\r\nthe motions of approach and recession, tested by the new method, have\r\nalways been somewhat too great. A part of the excess may be due to the\r\nuse of the measure of the sun’s distance, and therefore the measures\r\nof the dimensions of the solar system, in vogue before the recent\r\ntransit. These measures fall short to some degree of those which result\r\nfrom the observations made in December, 1874, on Venus in transit, the\r\nsun’s distance being estimated at about 91,400,000 miles instead of\r\n92,000,000 miles, which would seem to be nearer the real distance. Of\r\ncourse all the motions within the solar system would be correspondingly\r\nunder-estimated. On the other hand, the new method would give all\r\nvelocities with absolute correctness if instrumental difficulties\r\ncould be overcome. The difference between the real velocities of Venus\r\napproaching and receding, and those calculated according to the present\r\ninexact estimate of the sun’s distance, is however much less than\r\nthe observed discrepancy, doubtless due to the difficulties involved\r\nin the application of this most difficult method. I note the point,\r\nchiefly for the sake of mentioning the circumstance that theoretically\r\nthe method affords a new means of measuring the dimensions of the\r\nsolar system. Whensoever the practical application of the method has\r\nbeen so far improved that the rate of approach or recession of Venus,\r\nor Mercury, or Jupiter, or Saturn (any one of these planets), can be\r\ndetermined on any occasion, with great nicety, we can at once infer\r\nthe sun’s distance with corresponding exactness. Considering that\r\nthe method has only been invented ten years (setting aside Doppler’s\r\nfirst vague ideas respecting it), and that spectroscopic analysis as a\r\nmethod of exact observation is as yet little more than a quarter of\r\na century old, we may fairly hope that in the years to come the new\r\nmethod, already successfully applied to measure motions of recession\r\nand approach at the rate of 20 or 30 miles per second, will be employed\r\nsuccessfully in measuring much smaller velocities. Then will it give\r\nus a new method of measuring the great base-line of astronomical\r\nsurveying—the distance of our world from the centre of the solar\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThat this will one day happen is rendered highly probable, in my\r\nopinion, by the successes next to be related.\r\n\r\nBesides the motions of the planets around the sun, there are their\r\nmotions of rotation, and the rotation of the sun himself upon his\r\naxis. Some among these turning motions are sufficiently rapid to be\r\ndealt with by the new method. The most rapid rotational motion with\r\nwhich we are acquainted from actual observation is that of the planet\r\nJupiter. The circuit of his equator amounts to about 267,000 miles,\r\nand he turns once on his axis in a few minutes less than ten hours, so\r\nthat his equatorial surface travels at the rate of about 26,700 miles\r\nan hour, or nearly 7½ miles per second. Thus between the advancing and\r\nretreating sides of the equator there is a difference of motion in\r\nthe line of sight amounting to nearly 15 miles. But this is not all.\r\nJupiter shines by reflecting sunlight. Now it is easily seen that where\r\nhis turning equator _meets_ the waves of light from the sun, these are\r\nshortened, in the same sense that waves are shortened for a swimmer\r\ntravelling to meet them, while these waves, already shortened in this\r\nway, are further shortened when starting from the same advancing\r\nsurface of Jupiter, on their journey to us after reflection. In this\r\nway the shortening of the waves is doubled, at least when the earth is\r\nso placed that Jupiter lies in the same direction from us as from the\r\nsun, the very time, in fact, when Jupiter is most favourably placed\r\nfor ordinary observation, or is at his highest due south, when the sun\r\nis at his lowest below the northern horizon—that is, at midnight.\r\nThe lengthening of the waves is similarly doubled at this most\r\nfavourable time for observation; and the actual difference between the\r\nmotion of the two sides of Jupiter’s equator being nearly 15 miles\r\nper second, the effect on the light-waves is equivalent to that due\r\nto a difference of nearly 30 miles per second. Thus the new method\r\nmay fairly be expected to indicate Jupiter’s motion of rotation. The\r\nGreenwich observers have succeeded in applying it, though Jupiter has\r\nnot been favourably situated for observation. Only on one occasion,\r\nsays Sir G. Airy, was the spectrum of Jupiter “seen fairly well,”\r\nand on that occasion “measures were obtained which gave a result in\r\nremarkable agreement with the calculated value.” It may well be hoped\r\nthat when in the course of a few years Jupiter returns to that part of\r\nhis course where he rises high above the horizon, shining more brightly\r\nand through a less perturbed air, the new method will be still more\r\nsuccessfully applied. We may even hope to see it extended to Saturn,\r\nnot merely to confirm the measures already made of Saturn’s rotation,\r\nbut to resolve the doubts which exist as to the rotation of Saturn’s\r\nring-system.\r\n\r\nLastly, there remains the rotation of the sun, a movement much more\r\ndifficult to detect by the new method, because the actual rate of\r\nmotion even at the sun’s equator amounts only to about 1 mile per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this very difficult task, the hardest which\r\nspectroscopists have yet attempted, the Greenwich observers have\r\nachieved an undoubted success; but unfortunately for them, though\r\nfortunately for science, another observatory, far smaller and of much\r\nless celebrity, has at the critical moment achieved success still more\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers at our National Observatory have been able to recognize\r\nby the new method the turning motion of the sun upon his axis. And\r\nhere we have not, as in the case of Venus, to record merely that the\r\nobservers have seen what they expected to see because of the known\r\nmotion of the sun. “Particular care was taken,” says Airy, “to\r\navoid any bias from previous knowledge of the direction in which a\r\ndisplacement” (of the spectral lines) “was to be expected,” the side of\r\nthe sun under observation not being known by the observer until after\r\nthe observation was completed.\r\n\r\nBut Professor Young, at Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H., has done much\r\nmore than merely obtain evidence by the new method that the sun is\r\nrotating as we already knew. He has succeeded so perfectly in mastering\r\nthe instrumental and observational difficulties, as absolutely to be\r\nable to rely on his _measurement_ (as distinguished from the mere\r\nrecognition) of the sun’s motion of rotation. The manner in which he\r\nhas extended the powers of ordinary spectroscopic analysis, cannot very\r\nreadily be described in these pages, simply because the principles on\r\nwhich the extension depends require for their complete description a\r\nreference to mathematical considerations of some complexity. Let it be\r\nsimply noted that what is called the diffraction spectrum, obtained\r\nby using a finely lined plate, results from the dispersive action\r\nof such a plate, or _grating_ as it is technically called, and this\r\ndispersive power can be readily combined with that of a spectroscope\r\nof the ordinary kind. Now Dr. Rutherfurd, of New York, has succeeded\r\nin ruling so many thousand lines on glass within the breadth of a\r\nsingle inch as to produce a grating of high dispersive power. Availing\r\nhimself of this beautiful extension of spectroscopic powers, Professor\r\nYoung has succeeded in recognizing effects of much smaller motions\r\nof recession and approach than had before been observable by the new\r\nmethod. He has thus been able to measure the rotation-rate of the sun’s\r\nequatorial regions. His result exceeds considerably that inferred from\r\nthe telescopic observation of the solar spots. For whereas from the\r\nmotion of the spots a rotation-rate of about 1¼ mile per second has\r\nbeen calculated for the sun’s equator, Professor Young obtains from his\r\nspectroscopic observations a rate of rather more than 1⅖ mile, or about\r\n300 yards per second more than the telescopic rate.\r\n\r\nIf Young had been measuring the motion of the same matter which is\r\nobserved with the telescope, there could of course be no doubt that\r\nthe telescope was right and the spectroscope wrong. We might add a\r\nfew yards per second for the probably greater distance of the sun\r\nresulting from recent transit observations. For of course with an\r\nincrease in our estimate of the sun’s distance there comes an increase\r\nin our estimate of the sun’s dimensions, and of the velocity of the\r\nrotational motion of his surface. But only about 12 yards per second\r\ncould be allowed on this account; the rest would have to be regarded\r\nas an error due to the difficulties involved in the spectroscopic\r\nmethod. In reality, however, the telescopist and the spectroscopist\r\nobserve different things in determining by their respective methods\r\nthe sun’s motion of rotation. The former observes the motion of the\r\nspots belonging to the sun’s visible surface; the latter observes the\r\nmotion of the glowing vapours outside that surface, for it is from\r\nthese vapours, not from the surface of the sun, that the dark lines\r\nof the spectrum proceed. Now so confident is Professor Young of the\r\naccuracy of his spectroscopic observations, that he is prepared to\r\nregard the seeming difference of velocity between the atmosphere and\r\nsurface of the sun as real. He believes that “the solar atmosphere\r\nreally sweeps forward over the underlying surface, in the same way\r\nthat the equatorial regions outstrip the other parts of the sun’s\r\nsurface.” This inference, important and interesting in itself, is far\r\nmore important in what it involves. For if we can accept it, it follows\r\nthat the spectroscopic method of measuring the velocity of motions in\r\nthe line of sight is competent, under favourable conditions, to obtain\r\nresults accurate within a few hundred yards per second, or 10 or 12\r\nmiles per minute. If this shall really prove to be true for the method\r\nnow, less than ten years after it was first successfully applied,\r\nwhat may we not hope from the method in future years? Spectroscopic\r\nanalysis itself is in its infancy, and this method is but a recent\r\napplication of spectroscopy. A century or so hence astronomers will\r\nsmile (though not disdainfully) at these feeble efforts, much as we\r\nsmile now in contemplating the puny telescopes with which Galileo and\r\nhis contemporaries studied the star-depths. And we may well believe\r\nthat largely as the knowledge gained by telescopists in our own\r\ntime surpasses that which Galileo obtained, so will spectroscopists\r\na few generations hence have gained a far wider and deeper insight\r\ninto the constitution and movements of the stellar universe than the\r\nspectroscopists of our own day dare even hope to attain.\r\n\r\nI venture confidently to predict that, in that day, astronomers will\r\nrecognize in the universe of stars a variety of structure, a complexity\r\nof arrangement, an abundance of every form of cosmical vitality, such\r\nas I have been led by other considerations to suggest, not the mere\r\ncloven lamina of uniformly scattered stars more or less resembling our\r\nsun, and all in nearly the same stage of cosmical development, which\r\nthe books of astronomy not many years since agreed in describing. The\r\nhistory of astronomical progress does not render it probable that the\r\nreasoning already advanced, though in reality demonstrative, will\r\nconvince the generality of science students until direct and easily\r\nunderstood observations have shown the real nature of the constitution\r\nof that part of the universe over which astronomical survey extends.\r\nBut the evidence already obtained, though its thorough analysis may\r\nbe “_caviare_ to the general,” suffices to show the real nature of\r\nthe relations which one day will come within the direct scope of\r\nastronomical observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE NEW STAR WHICH FADED INTO STAR-MIST._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a new star in the constellation of the Swan in the\r\nautumn of 1876 promises to throw even more light than was expected on\r\nsome of the most interesting problems with which modern astronomy has\r\nto deal. It was justly regarded as a circumstance of extreme interest\r\nthat so soon after the outburst of the star which formed a new gem\r\nin the Northern Crown in May, 1866, another should have shone forth\r\nunder seemingly similar conditions. And when, as time went on, it\r\nappeared that in several respects the new star in the Swan differed\r\nfrom the new star in the Crown, astronomers found fresh interest in\r\nstudying, as closely as possible, the changes presented by the former\r\nas it gradually faded from view. But they were not prepared to expect\r\nwhat has actually taken place, or to recognize so great a difference\r\nof character between these two new stars, that whereas one seemed\r\nthroughout its visibility to ordinary eyesight, and even until the\r\npresent time, to be justly called a star, the other should so change as\r\nto render it extremely doubtful whether at any time it deserved to be\r\nregarded as a star or sun.\r\n\r\nFew astronomical phenomena, even of those observed during this century\r\n(so fruitful in great astronomical discoveries), seem better worthy\r\nof thorough investigation and study than those presented by the two\r\nstars which appeared in the Crown and in the Swan, in 1866 and 1876\r\nrespectively. A new era seems indeed to be beginning for those\r\ndepartments of astronomy which deal with stars and star-cloudlets on\r\nthe one hand, and with the evolution of solar systems and stellar\r\nsystems on the other.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly consider the history of the star of 1866 in the first\r\nplace, and then turn our thoughts to the more surprising and probably\r\nmore instructive history of the star which shone out in November, 1876.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, however, I would desire to make a few remarks\r\non the objections which have been expressed by an observer to whom\r\nastronomy is indebted for very useful work, against the endeavour to\r\ninterpret the facts ascertained respecting these so-called new stars.\r\nM. Cornu, who made some among the earliest spectroscopic observations\r\nof the star in Cygnus, after describing his results, proceeded as\r\nfollows:—“Grand and seductive though the task may be of endeavouring\r\nto draw from observed facts inductions respecting the physical state of\r\nthis new star, respecting its temperature, and the chemical reactions\r\nof which it may be the scene, I shall abstain from all commentary and\r\nall hypothesis on this subject. I think that we do not yet possess\r\nthe data necessary for arriving at useful conclusions, or at least at\r\nconclusions capable of being tested: however attractive hypotheses may\r\nbe, we must not forget that they are outside the bounds of science,\r\nand that, far from serving science, they seriously endanger its\r\nprogress.” This, as I ventured to point out at the time, is utterly\r\ninconsistent with all experience. M. Cornu’s objection to theorizing\r\nwhen he did not see his way to theorizing justly, is sound enough;\r\nbut his general objection to theorizing is, with all deference be it\r\nsaid, sheerly absurd. It will be noticed that I say theorizing, not\r\nhypothesis-framing; for though he speaks of hypotheses, he in reality\r\nis describing theories. The word hypothesis is too frequently used in\r\nthis incorrect sense—perhaps so frequently that we may almost prefer\r\nsanctioning the use to substituting the correct word. But the fact\r\nreally is, that many, even among scientific writers, when they hear\r\nthe word hypothesis, think immediately of Newton’s famous “hypotheses\r\nnon fingo,” a dictum relating to real hypotheses, not to theories. It\r\nwould, in fact, be absurd to suppose that Newton, who had advanced,\r\nadvocated, and eventually established, the noblest scientific theory\r\nthe world has known, would ever have expressed an objection to\r\ntheorizing, as he is commonly understood to have done by those who\r\ninterpret his “hypotheses non fingo” in the sense which finds favour\r\nwith M. Cornu. But apart from this, Newton definitely indicates what he\r\nmeans by hypotheses. “I frame no hypotheses,” he says, “_for whatever\r\nis not deduced from phenomena is to be called an hypothesis_.” M.\r\nCornu, it will be seen, rejects the idea of deducing from phenomena\r\nwhat he calls an hypothesis, but what would not be an hypothesis\r\naccording to Newton’s definition: “Malgré tout ce qu’il y aurait de\r\nséduisant et de grandiose à tirer de ce fait des inductions, etc., je\r\nm’abstiendrai de tout commentaire et de toute hypothèse à ce sujet.” It\r\nis not thus that observed scientific facts are to be made fruitful, nor\r\nthus that the points to which closer attention must be given are to be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nSince the preceding paragraph was written, my attention has been\r\nattracted to the words of another observer more experienced than M.\r\nCornu, who has not only expressed the same opinion which I entertain\r\nrespecting M. Cornu’s ill-advised remark, but has illustrated in a\r\nvery practical way, and in this very case, how science gains from\r\ncommentary and theory upon observed facts. Herr Vögel considers “that\r\nthe fear that an hypothesis” (he, also, means a theory here) “might do\r\nharm to science is only justifiable in very rare cases: in most cases\r\nit will further science. In the first place, it draws the attention of\r\nthe observer to things which but for the hypothesis might have been\r\nneglected. Of course if the observer is so strongly influenced that\r\nin favour of an hypothesis he sees things which do not exist—and\r\nthis may happen sometimes—science may for a while be arrested in its\r\nprogress, but in that case the observer is far more to blame than\r\nthe author of the hypothesis. On the other hand, it is very possible\r\nthat an observer may, involuntarily, arrest the progress of science,\r\neven without originating an hypothesis, by pronouncing and publishing\r\nsentences which have a tendency to diminish the general interest in a\r\nquestion, and which do not place its high significance in the proper\r\nlight.” (This is very neatly put.) He is “almost inclined to think that\r\nsuch an effect might follow from the reading of M. Cornu’s remark, and\r\nthat nowhere better than in the present case, where in short periods\r\ncolossal changes showed themselves occurring upon a heavenly body,\r\nmight the necessary data be obtained for drawing useful conclusions,\r\nand tests be applied to those hypotheses which have been ventured\r\nwith regard to the condition of heavenly bodies.” It was, as we shall\r\npresently see, in thus collecting data and applying tests, that Vögel\r\npractically illustrated the justice of his views.\r\n\r\nThe star which shone out in the Northern Crown in May, 1866, would seem\r\nto have grown to its full brightness very quickly. It is not necessary\r\nthat I should here consider the history of the star’s discovery; but\r\nI think all who have examined that history agree in considering that\r\nwhereas on the evening of May 12, 1866, a new star was shining in the\r\nNorthern Crown with second-magnitude brightness, none had been visible\r\nin the same spot with brightness above that of a fifth-magnitude\r\nstar twenty-four hours earlier. On ascertaining, however, the place\r\nof the new star, astronomers found that there had been recorded in\r\nArgelander’s charts and catalogue a star of between the ninth and tenth\r\nmagnitude in this spot. The star declined very rapidly in brightness.\r\nOn May 13th it appeared of the third magnitude; on May 16th it had\r\nsunk to the fourth magnitude; on the 17th to the fifth; on the 19th to\r\nthe seventh; and by the end of the month it shone only as a telescopic\r\nstar of the ninth magnitude. It is now certainly not above the tenth\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nExamined with the spectroscope, this star was found to be in an\r\nabnormal condition. It gave the rainbow-tinted streak crossed by dark\r\nlines, which is usually given by stars (with minor variations, which\r\nenable astronomers to classify the stars into several distinct orders).\r\nBut superposed upon this spectrum, or perhaps we should rather say\r\nshining through this spectrum, were seen four brilliant lines, two\r\nof which certainly belonged to glowing hydrogen. These lines were so\r\nbright as to show that the greater part of the light of the star at\r\nthe time came from the glowing gas or gases giving these lines. It\r\nappeared, however, that the rainbow-tinted spectrum on which these\r\nlines were seen was considerably brighter than it would otherwise have\r\nbeen, in consequence of the accession of heat indicated by and probably\r\nderived from the glowing hydrogen.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have not accordant accounts of the changes which the\r\nspectrum of this star underwent as the star faded out of view. Wolf\r\nand Rayet, of the Paris Observatory, assert that when there remained\r\nscarcely any trace of the continuous spectrum, the four bright lines\r\nwere still quite brilliant. But Huggins affirms that this was not the\r\ncase in his observations; he was “able to see the continuous spectrum\r\nwhen the bright lines could be scarcely distinguished.” As the bright\r\nlines certainly faded out of view eventually, we may reasonably assume\r\nthat the French observers were prevented by the brightness of the lines\r\nfrom recognizing the continuous spectrum at that particular stage of\r\nthe diminution of the star’s light when the continuous spectrum had\r\nfaded considerably but the hydrogen lines little. Later, the continuous\r\nspectrum ceased to diminish in brightness, while the hydrogen lines\r\nrapidly faded. Thereafter the continuous spectrum could be discerned,\r\nand with greater and greater distinctness as the hydrogen lines faded\r\nout.\r\n\r\nNow, in considering the meaning of the observed changes in the\r\nso-called “new star,” we have two general theories to consider.\r\n\r\nOne of these theories is that to which Dr. Huggins would seem to have\r\ninclined, though he did not definitely adopt it—the theory, namely,\r\nthat in consequence of some internal convulsion enormous quantities of\r\nhydrogen and other gases were evolved, which in combining with some\r\nother elements ignited on the surface of the star, and thus enveloped\r\nthe whole body suddenly in a sheet of flame.\r\n\r\n“The ignited hydrogen gas in burning produced the light corresponding\r\nto the two bright bands in the red and green; the remaining bright\r\nlines were not, however, coincident with those of oxygen, as might have\r\nbeen expected. According to this theory, the burning hydrogen must have\r\ngreatly increased the heat of the solid matter of the photosphere and\r\nbrought it into a state of more intense incandescence and luminosity,\r\nwhich may explain how the formerly faint star could so suddenly assume\r\nsuch remarkable brilliance; the liberated hydrogen became exhausted,\r\nthe flame gradually abated, and with the consequent cooling the\r\nphotosphere became less vivid, and the star returned to its original\r\ncondition.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the other theory, advanced by Meyer and Klein, the\r\nblazing forth of this new star may have been occasioned by the violent\r\nprecipitation of some great mass, perhaps a planet, upon a fixed star,\r\n“by which the momentum of the falling mass would be changed into\r\nmolecular motion,” and result in the emission of light and heat.\r\n\r\n“It might even be supposed that the new star, through its rapid motion,\r\nmay have come in contact with one of the nebulæ which traverse in great\r\nnumbers the realms of space in every direction, and which from their\r\ngaseous condition must possess a high temperature; such a collision\r\nwould necessarily set the star in a blaze, and occasion the most\r\nvehement ignition of its hydrogen.”\r\n\r\nIf we regard these two theories in their more general aspect,\r\nconsidering one as the theory that the origin of disturbance was within\r\nthe star, and the other as the theory that the origin of disturbance\r\nwas outside the star, they seem to include all possible interpretations\r\nof the observed phenomena. But, as actually advanced, neither seems\r\nsatisfactory. The sudden pouring forth of hydrogen from the interior,\r\nin quantities sufficient to explain the outburst, seems altogether\r\nimprobable. On the other hand, as I have pointed out elsewhere, there\r\nare reasons for rejecting the theory that the cause of the heat which\r\nsuddenly affected this star was either the downfall of a planet on\r\nthe star or the collision of the star with a star-cloudlet or nebula,\r\ntraversing space in one direction, while the star rushed onwards in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nA planet could not very well come into final conflict with its sun at\r\none fell swoop. It would gradually draw nearer and nearer, not by the\r\nnarrowing of its path, but by the change of the path’s shape. The path\r\nwould, in fact, become more and more eccentric; until at length, at its\r\npoint of nearest approach, the planet would graze its primary, exciting\r\nan intense heat where it struck, but escaping actual destruction that\r\ntime. The planet would make another circuit, and again graze the sun,\r\nat or near the same part of the planet’s path. For several circuits\r\nthis would continue, the grazes not becoming more and more effective\r\neach time, but rather less. The interval between them, however, would\r\ngrow continually less and less; at last the time would come when\r\nthe planet’s path would be reduced to the circular form, its globe\r\ntouching the sun’s all the way round, and then the planet would very\r\nquickly be reduced to vapour and partly burned up, its substance being\r\nabsorbed by its sun. But all successive grazes would be indicated to\r\nus by accessions of lustre, the period between each seeming outburst\r\nbeing only a few months at first, and gradually becoming less and less\r\n(during a long course of years, perhaps even of centuries) until the\r\nplanet was finally destroyed. Nothing of this sort has happened in the\r\ncase of any so-called new star. As for the rush of a star through a\r\nnebulous mass, that is a theory which would scarcely be entertained by\r\nany one acquainted with the enormous distances separating the gaseous\r\nstar-clouds properly called nebulæ. There may be small clouds of the\r\nsame sort scattered much more freely through space; but we have not a\r\nparticle of evidence that this is actually the case. All we certainly\r\n_know_ about star-cloudlets suggests that the distances separating them\r\nfrom each other are comparable with those which separate star from\r\nstar, in which case the idea of a star coming into collision with a\r\nstar-cloudlet, and still more the idea of this occurring several times\r\nin a century, is wild in the extreme.\r\n\r\nBut while thus advancing objections, which seem to me irrefragable,\r\nagainst the theory that either a planet or a nebula (still less another\r\nsmall star) had come into collision with the orb in Corona which shone\r\nout so splendidly for a while, I advanced another view which seemed\r\nto me then and seems now to correspond well with phenomena, and to\r\nrender the theory of action from without on the whole preferable to the\r\ntheory of outburst from within. I suggested that, far more probably,\r\nan enormous flight of large meteoric masses travelling around the\r\nstar had come into partial collision with it in the same way that the\r\nflight of November meteors comes into collision with our earth thrice\r\nin each century, and that other meteoric flights may occasionally come\r\ninto collision with our sun, producing the disturbances which occasion\r\nthe sun-spots. As I pointed out, in conceiving this we are imagining\r\nnothing new. A meteoric flight capable of producing the suggested\r\neffects would differ only in kind from meteoric flights which are known\r\nto circle around our own sun. The meteors which produce the November\r\ndisplays of falling stars follow in the track of a comet barely visible\r\nto the naked eye.\r\n\r\n“May we not reasonably assume that those glorious comets which have not\r\nonly been visible but conspicuous, shining even in the day-time, and\r\nbrandishing around tails, which like that of the ‘wonder in heaven, the\r\ngreat dragon,’ seemed to ‘draw the third part of the stars of heaven,’\r\nare followed by much denser flights of much more massive meteors?\r\nSome of these giant comets have paths which carry them very close to\r\nour sun. Newton’s comet, with its tail a hundred millions of miles in\r\nlength, all but grazed the sun’s globe. The comet of 1843, whose tail,\r\nsays Sir John Herschel, ‘stretched half-way across the sky,’ must\r\nactually have grazed the sun, though but lightly, for its nucleus was\r\nwithin 80,000 miles of his surface, and its head was more than 160,000\r\nmiles in diameter. And these are only two among the few comets whose\r\npaths are known. At any time we might be visited by a comet mightier\r\nthan either, travelling in an orbit intersecting the sun’s surface,\r\nfollowed by flights of meteoric masses enormous in size and many in\r\nnumber, which, falling on the sun’s globe with enormous velocity\r\ncorresponding to their vast orbital range and their near approach to\r\nthe sun—a velocity of some 360 miles per second—would, beyond all\r\ndoubt, excite his whole frame, and especially his surface regions, to a\r\ndegree of heat far exceeding what he now emits.”\r\n\r\nThis theory corresponds far better also with observed facts than the\r\ntheory of Meyer and Klein, in other respects than simply in antecedent\r\nprobability. It can easily be shown that if a planet fell upon a\r\nsun in such sort as to become part of his mass, or if a nebula in a\r\nstate of intense heat excited the whole frame of a star to a similar\r\ndegree of heat, the effects would be of longer duration than the\r\nobserved accession of heat and light in the case of all the so-called\r\n“new stars.” It has been calculated by Mr. Croll (the well-known\r\nmathematician to whom we owe the most complete investigations yet made\r\ninto the effect of the varying eccentricity of the earth’s orbit on the\r\nclimate of the earth) that if two suns, each equal in mass to one-half\r\nof our sun, came into collision with a velocity of 476 miles per\r\nsecond, light and heat would be produced which would cover the present\r\nrate of the sun’s radiation for fifty million years. Now although it\r\ncertainly does not follow from this that such a collision would result\r\nin the steady emission of so much light and heat as our sun gives out,\r\nfor a period of fifty million years, but is, on the contrary, certain\r\nthat there would be a far greater emission at first and a far smaller\r\nemission afterwards, yet it manifestly must be admitted that such a\r\ncollision could not possibly produce so short-lived an effect as we see\r\nin the case of every one of the so-called new stars. The diminution\r\nin the emission of light and heat from the maximum to one-half the\r\nmaximum would not occupy fifty millions of years, or perhaps even five\r\nmillion or five hundred thousand years; but it would certainly require\r\nthousands of years; whereas we have seen that the new stars in the\r\nCrown and in the Swan have lost not one-half but ninety-nine hundredths\r\nof their maximum lustre in a few months.\r\n\r\nThis has been urged as an objection even to the term star as applied to\r\nthese suddenly appearing orbs. But the objection is not valid; because\r\nthere is no reason whatever for supposing that even our own sun might\r\nnot be excited by the downfall of meteoric or cometic matter upon it\r\nto a sudden and short-lasting intensity of splendour and of heat. Mr.\r\nLockyer remarks that, if any star, properly so called, were to become\r\na “a world on fire,” or “burst into flames,” or, in less poetical\r\nlanguage, were to be driven either into a condition of incandescence\r\nabsolutely, or to have its incandescence increased, there can be little\r\ndoubt that thousands or millions of years would be necessary for the\r\nreduction of its light to its original intensity. This must, however,\r\nhave been written in forgetfulness of some facts which have been\r\nascertained respecting our sun, and which indicate pretty clearly that\r\nthe sun’s surface might be roused to a temporary intensity of splendour\r\nand heat without any corresponding increase in the internal heat, or in\r\nthe activity of the causes, whatever they may be, to which the sun’s\r\n_steady_ emissions of light and heat are due.\r\n\r\nFor instance, most of my readers are doubtless familiar with the\r\naccount (an oft-told tale, at any rate) of the sudden increase in\r\nthe splendour of a small portion of the sun’s surface on September\r\n1, 1859, observed by two astronomers independently. The appearances\r\ndescribed corresponded exactly with what we should expect if two large\r\nmeteoric masses travelling side by side had rushed, with a velocity\r\noriginally amounting to two or three hundred miles per second, through\r\nthe portions of the solar atmosphere lying just above, at, and just\r\nbelow the visible photosphere. The actual rate of motion was measured\r\nat 120 miles per second as the minimum, but may, if the direction of\r\nmotion was considerably inclined to the line of sight, have amounted\r\nto more than 200 miles per second. The effect was such, that the parts\r\nof the sun thus suddenly excited to an increased emission of light and\r\nheat appeared like bright stars upon the background of the glowing\r\nphotosphere itself. One of the observers, Carrington, supposed for a\r\nmoment that the dark glass screen used to protect the eye had broken.\r\nThe increase of splendour was exceedingly limited in area, and lasted\r\nonly for a few minutes—fortunately for the inhabitants of earth. As\r\nit was, the whole frame of the earth sympathized with the sun. Vivid\r\nauroras were seen, not only in both hemispheres, but in latitudes where\r\nauroras are seldom seen. They were accompanied by unusually great\r\nelectro-magnetic disturbances.\r\n\r\n“In many places,” says Sir J. Herschel, “the telegraph wires struck\r\nwork. At Washington and Philadelphia, the electric signalmen received\r\nsevere electric shocks. At a station in Norway, the telegraphic\r\napparatus was set fire to, and at Boston, in North America, a flame of\r\nfire followed the pen of Bain’s electric telegraph, which writes down\r\nthe message upon chemically prepared paper.”\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that most certainly the sun can be locally excited to\r\nincreased emission of light and heat, which nevertheless may last but\r\nfor a very short time; and we have good reason for believing that the\r\nactual cause of the sudden change in his condition was the downfall\r\nof meteoric matter upon a portion of his surface. We may well believe\r\nthat, whatever the cause may have been, it was one which might in the\r\ncase of other suns, or even in our sun’s own case, affect a much larger\r\nportion of the photosphere. If this happened there would be just\r\nsuch an accession of splendour as we recognize in the case of the new\r\nstars. And as the small local accession of brilliancy lasted only a few\r\nminutes, we can well believe that an increase of surface brilliancy\r\naffecting a much larger portion of the photosphere, or even the entire\r\nphotosphere, might last but for a few days or weeks.\r\n\r\nAll that can be said in the way of negative evidence, so far as our\r\nown sun is concerned, is that we have no reason for believing that\r\nour sun has, at any time within many thousands of years, been excited\r\nto emit even for a few hours a much greater amount of light and heat\r\nthan usual; so that it has afforded no direct evidence in favour of\r\nthe belief that other suns may be roused to many times their normal\r\nsplendour, and yet very quickly resume that usual lustre. But we know\r\nthat our sun, whether because of his situation in space, or of his\r\nposition in time (that is, the stage of solar development to which he\r\nhas at present attained), belongs to the class of stars which shine\r\nwith steady lustre. He does not vary like Betelgeux, for example, which\r\nis not only a sun like him as to general character, but notably a\r\nlarger and more massive orb. Still less is he like Mira, the Wonderful\r\nStar; or like that more wonderful variable star, Eta Argûs, which at\r\none time shines with a lustre nearly equalling that of the bright\r\nSirius, and anon fades away almost into utter invisibility. He _is_ a\r\nvariable sun, for we cannot suppose that the waxing and waning of the\r\nsun-spot period leaves his lustre, as a whole, altogether unaffected.\r\nBut his variation is so slight that, with all ordinary methods of\r\nphotometric measurement by observers stationed on worlds which circle\r\naround other suns, it must be absolutely undiscernible. We do not,\r\nhowever, reject Betelgeux, or Mira, or even Eta Argûs, from among stars\r\nbecause they vary in lustre. We recognize the fact that, as in glory,\r\nso in condition and in changes of condition, one star differeth from\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there are excellent reasons for rejecting the theory that a\r\nmassive body like a planet, or a nebulous mass like those which are\r\nfound among the star-depths (the least of which would exceed many\r\ntimes in volume a sphere filling the entire space of the orbit of\r\nNeptune), fell on some remote sun in the Northern Crown. But there are\r\nno sufficient reasons for rejecting or even doubting the theory that\r\na comet, bearing in its train a flight of many millions of meteoric\r\nmasses, falling directly upon such a sun, might cause it to shine\r\nwith many times its ordinary lustre, but only for a short time, a few\r\nmonths or weeks, or a few days, or even hours. In the article entitled\r\n“Suns in Flames,” in my “Myths and Marvels of Astronomy,” before the\r\nstartling evidence recently obtained from the star in Cygnus had\r\nbeen thought of, I thus indicated the probable effects of such an\r\nevent:—“When the earth has passed through the richer portions (not the\r\nactual nuclei be it remembered) of meteor systems, the meteors visible\r\nfrom even a single station have been counted by tens of thousands, and\r\nit has been computed that millions must have fallen upon the whole\r\nearth. These were meteors following in the trains of very small comets.\r\nIf a very large comet followed by no denser a flight of meteors, but\r\neach meteoric mass much larger, fell directly upon the sun, it would\r\nnot be the outskirts but the nucleus of the meteoric train which would\r\nimpinge upon him. They would number thousands of millions. The velocity\r\nof downfall of each mass would be more than 360 miles per second. And\r\nthey would continue to pour in upon him for several days in succession,\r\nmillions falling every hour. It seems not improbable that under this\r\ntremendous and long-continued meteoric hail, his whole surface would\r\nbe caused to glow as intensely as that small part whose brilliancy\r\nwas so surprising in the observation made by Carrington and Hodgson.\r\nIn that case our sun, seen from some remote star whence ordinarily he\r\nis invisible, would shine out as a new sun for a few days, while all\r\nthings living, on our earth and whatever other members of the solar\r\nsystem are the abodes of life, would inevitably be destroyed.”\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, reasons for believing, not only, as I have already\r\nindicated, that the outburst in the sun was caused by the downfall of\r\nmeteoric masses, but that those masses were following in the train of\r\na known comet, precisely as the November meteors follow in the train of\r\nTempel’s comet (II., 1866). For we know that November meteoric displays\r\nhave been witnessed for five or six years after the passage of Tempel’s\r\ncomet, in its thirty-three year orbit, while the August meteoric\r\ndisplays have been witnessed fully one hundred and twenty years\r\nafter the passage of their comet (II., 1862).[15] Now only sixteen\r\nyears before the solar outburst witnessed by Carrington and Hodgson,\r\na magnificent comet had passed even closer to the sun than either\r\nTempel’s comet or the second comet of 1862 approached the earth’s\r\norbit. That was the famous comet of the year 1843. Many of us remember\r\nthat wonderful object. I was but a child myself when it appeared, but\r\nI can well remember its amazing tail, which in March, 1843, stretched\r\nhalf-way across the sky.\r\n\r\n“Of all the comets on record,” says Sir J. Herschel, “that approached\r\nnearest the sun; indeed, it was at first supposed that it had actually\r\ngrazed the sun’s surface, but it proved to have just missed by an\r\ninterval of not more than 80,000 miles—about a third of the distance\r\nof the moon from the earth, which (in such a matter) is a very close\r\nshave indeed to get clear off.”\r\n\r\nWe can well believe that the two meteors which produced the remarkable\r\noutburst of 1859 may have been stragglers from the main body following\r\nafter that glorious comet. I do not insist upon the connection. In\r\nfact, I rather incline to the belief that the disturbance in 1859,\r\noccurring as it did about the time of maximum sun-spot frequency, was\r\ncaused by meteors following in the train of some as yet undiscovered\r\ncomet, circuiting the sun in about eleven years, the spots themselves\r\nbeing, I believe, due in the main to meteoric downfalls. There is\r\ngreater reason for believing that the great sun-spot which appeared\r\nin June, 1843, was caused by the comet which three months before had\r\ngrazed the sun’s surface. As Professor Kirkwood, of Bloomington,\r\nIndiana, justly remarks, had this comet approached a little nearer,\r\nthe resistance of the solar atmosphere would probably have brought\r\nthe comet’s entire mass to the solar surface. Even at its actual\r\ndistance, it must have produced considerable atmospheric disturbance.\r\nBut the recent discovery that a number of comets are associated\r\nwith meteoric matter travelling in nearly the same orbits, suggests\r\nthe inquiry whether an enormous meteorite following in the comet’s\r\ntrain, and having a somewhat less perihelion distance, may not have\r\nbeen precipitated upon the sun, thus producing the great disturbance\r\nobserved so shortly after the comet’s perihelion passage.\r\n\r\nLet us consider now the evidence obtained from the star in Cygnus,\r\nnoting especially in what points it resembles, and in what points it\r\ndiffers from, the evidence afforded by the star in the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe new star was first seen by Professor Schmidt at a quarter to six\r\non the evening of November 24. It was then shining as a star of the\r\nthird magnitude, in the constellation of the Swan, not very far from\r\nthe famous but faint star 61 Cygni—which first of all the stars in the\r\nnorthern heavens had its distance determined by astronomers. The three\r\nprevious nights had unfortunately been dark; but Schmidt is certain\r\nthat on November 20 the star was not visible. At midnight, November\r\n24, its light was very yellow, and it was somewhat brighter than the\r\nwell-known star Eta Pegasi, which marks the forearm of the Flying\r\nHorse. Schmidt sent news of the discovery to Leverrier, at Paris;\r\nbut neither he nor Leverrier telegraphed the news, as they should\r\nhave done, to Greenwich, Berlin, or the United States. Many precious\r\nopportunities for observing the spectrum of the new-comer at the time\r\nof its greatest brilliancy were thus lost.\r\n\r\nThe observers at Paris did their best to observe the spectrum of the\r\nstar and the all-important changes in the spectrum. But they had\r\nunfavourable weather. It was not till December 2 that the star was\r\nobserved at Paris, by which time the colour, which had been very yellow\r\non November 24, had become “greenish, almost blue.” The star had also\r\nthen sunk from the third to far below the fourth magnitude. It is\r\nseldom that science has to regret a more important loss of opportunity\r\nthan this. What we want specially to know is the nature of the spectrum\r\ngiven by this star when its light was yellow; and this we can now never\r\nknow. Nor are the outbursts of new stars so common that we may quickly\r\nexpect another similar opportunity, even if any number of other new\r\nstars should present the same series of phenomena as the star in Cygnus.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, the spectrum, as observed by M. Cornu, consisted almost\r\nentirely of bright lines. On December 5, he determined the position of\r\nthese lines, though clouds still greatly interfered with his labours.\r\nHe found three bright lines of hydrogen, the strong double sodium line\r\nin the orange-yellow, the triple magnesium line in the yellow-green,\r\nand two other lines—one of which seemed to agree exactly in position\r\nwith a bright line belonging to the solar corona. All these lines were\r\nshining upon the rainbow-tinted background of the spectrum, which was\r\nrelatively faint. He drew the conclusion that in chemical constitution\r\nthe atmosphere of the new star was constituted exactly like the solar\r\nsierra.\r\n\r\nHerr Vögel’s observations commenced on December 5, and were continued\r\nat intervals until March 10, when the star had sunk to below the eighth\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nVögel’s earlier observations agreed well with Cornu’s. He remarks,\r\nhowever, that Cornu’s opinion as to the exact resemblance of the\r\nchemical constitution of the star’s atmosphere with that of the sierra\r\nis not just, for both Cornu and himself noticed one line which did not\r\ncorrespond with any line belonging to the solar sierra; and this line\r\neventually became the brightest line of the whole spectrum. Comparing\r\nhis own observations with those of Cornu, Vögel points out that they\r\nagree perfectly with regard to the presence of the three hydrogen\r\nlines, and that of the brightest line of the air spectrum (belonging to\r\nnitrogen),—which is the principal line of the spectrum of nebulæ. This\r\nis the line which has no analogue in the spectrum of the sierra.\r\n\r\nWe have also observations by F. Secchi, at Rome, Mr. Copeland, at\r\nDunecht, and Mr. Backhouse, of Sunderland, all agreeing in the main\r\nwith the observations made by Vögel and Cornu. In particular, Mr.\r\nBackhouse observed, as Vögel had done, that whereas in December the\r\ngreenish-blue line of hydrogen, F, was brighter than the nitrogen line\r\n(also in the green-blue, but nearer the red end than F), on January 6\r\nthe nitrogen line was the brightest of all the lines in the spectrum of\r\nthe new star.\r\n\r\nVögel, commenting on the results of his observations up to March 10,\r\nmakes the following interesting remarks (I quote, with slight verbal\r\nalterations, from a paraphrase in a weekly scientific journal):—“A\r\nstellar spectrum with _bright_ lines is always a highly interesting\r\nphenomenon for any one acquainted with stellar spectrum analysis,\r\nand well worthy of deep consideration. Although in the chromosphere\r\n(sierra) of our sun, near the limb, we see numerous bright lines, yet\r\nonly dark lines appear in the spectrum whenever we produce a small\r\nstar-like image of the sun, and examine it through the spectroscope. It\r\nis generally believed that the bright lines in some few star-spectra\r\nresult from gases which break forth from the interior of the luminous\r\nbody, the temperature of which is higher than that of the surface of\r\nthe body—that is, the phenomenon is the same sometimes observed in\r\nthe spectra of solar spots, where incandescent hydrogen rushing out\r\nof the hot interior becomes visible above the cooler spots through\r\nthe hydrogen lines turning bright. But this is not the only possible\r\nexplanation. We may also suppose that the atmosphere of a star,\r\nconsisting of incandescent gases, as is the case with our own sun, is\r\non the whole cooler than the nucleus, but with regard to the latter is\r\nextremely large. I cannot well imagine how the phenomenon can last for\r\nany long period of time if the former hypothesis be correct. The gas\r\nbreaking forth from the hot interior of the body will impart a portion\r\nof its heat to the surface of the body, and thus raise the temperature\r\nof the latter; consequently, the difference of temperature between the\r\nincandescent gas and the surface of the body will soon be insufficient\r\nto produce bright lines; and these will disappear from the spectrum.\r\nThis view applies perfectly to stars which suddenly appear and soon\r\ndisappear again, or at least increase considerably in intensity—that\r\nis, it applies perfectly to so-called new stars in the spectra of\r\nwhich bright lines are apparent, _if_ the hypothesis presently to be\r\nmentioned is admitted for their explanation. For a more stable state\r\nof things the second hypothesis seems to be far better adapted. Stars\r\nlike Beta Lyræ, Gamma Cassiopeiæ, and others, which show the hydrogen\r\nlines and the sierra D line bright on a continuous spectrum, with\r\nonly slight changes of intensity, possess, according to this theory,\r\natmospheres very large relatively to their own volume—the atmospheres\r\nconsisting of hydrogen and that unknown element which produces the\r\nD line.[16] With regard to the new star, Zöllner, long before the\r\nprogress lately made in stellar physics by means of spectrum analysis,\r\ndeduced from Tycho’s observations of the star called after him, that\r\non the surface of a star, through the constant emission of heat, the\r\nproducts of cooling, which in the case of our sun we call sun-spots,\r\naccumulate: so that finally the whole surface of the body is covered\r\nwith a colder stratum, which gives much less light or none at all.\r\nThrough a sudden and violent tearing up of this stratum, the interior\r\nincandescent materials which it encloses must naturally break forth,\r\nand must in consequence, according to the extent of their eruption,\r\ncause larger or smaller patches of the dark envelope of the body to\r\nbecome luminous again. To a distant observer such an eruption from the\r\nhot and still incandescent interior of a heavenly body must appear as\r\nthe sudden flashing-up of a new star. That this evolution of light\r\nmay under certain conditions be an extremely powerful one, could be\r\nexplained by the circumstance that all the chemical compounds which,\r\nunder the influence of a lower temperature, had already formed upon the\r\nsurface, are again decomposed through the sudden eruption of these hot\r\nmaterials; and that this decomposition, as in the case of terrestrial\r\nsubstances, takes place under evolution of light and heat. Thus the\r\nbright flashing-up is not only ascribed to the parts of the surface\r\nwhich through the eruption of the incandescent matter have again become\r\nluminous, but also to a simultaneous process of combustion, which is\r\ninitiated through the colder compounds coming into contact with the\r\nincandescent matter.”\r\n\r\nVögel considers that Zöllner’s hypothesis has been confirmed in its\r\nessential points by the application of spectrum analysis to the stars.\r\nWe can recognize from the spectrum different stages in the process\r\nof cooling, and in some of the fainter stars we perceive indeed that\r\nchemical compounds have already formed, and still exist. As to new\r\nstars, again, says Vögel, Zöllner’s theory seems in nowise contradicted\r\n“by the spectral observations made on the two new stars of 1866 and\r\n1876. The bright continuous spectrum, and the bright lines only\r\nslightly exceeding it at first” (a description, however, applying\r\ncorrectly only to the star of 1876), “could not be well explained if we\r\nonly suppose a violent eruption from the interior, which again rendered\r\nthe surface wholly or partially luminous; but are easily explained\r\nif we suppose that the quantity of light is considerably augmented\r\nthrough a simultaneous process of combustion. If this process is of\r\nshort duration, then the continuous spectrum, as was the case with the\r\nnew star of 1876, will very quickly decrease in intensity down to a\r\ncertain limit, while the bright lines in the spectrum, which result\r\nfrom the incandescent gases that have emanated in enormous quantities\r\nfrom the interior, will continue for some time.”\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that Herr Vögel regarded the observations which had\r\nbeen made on this remarkable star up to March 10 as indicating that\r\nfirst there had been an outburst of glowing gaseous matter from the\r\ninterior, producing the part of the light which gave the bright\r\nlines indicative of gaseity, and that then there had followed, as a\r\nconsequence, the combustion of a portion of the solid and relatively\r\ncool crust, causing the continuous part of the spectrum. We may\r\ncompare what had taken place, on this hypothesis, with the outburst of\r\nintensely hot gases from the interior of a volcanic crater, and the\r\nincandescence of the lips of the crater in consequence of the intense\r\nheat of the out-rushing gases. Any one viewing such a crater from a\r\ndistance, with a spectroscope, would see the bright lines belonging\r\nto the out-rushing gases superposed upon the continuous spectrum due\r\nto the crater’s burning lips. Vögel further supposes that the burning\r\nparts of the star soon cooled, the majority of the remaining light (or\r\nat any rate the part of the remaining light spectroscopically most\r\neffective) being that which came from the glowing gases which had\r\nemanated in vast quantities from the star’s interior.\r\n\r\n“The observations of the spectrum show, beyond doubt,” he says, “that\r\nthe decrease in the light of the star corresponds with the cooling\r\nof its surface. The violet and blue parts decreased more rapidly in\r\nintensity than the other parts; and the absorption-bands which crossed\r\nthe spectrum have gradually become darker and darker.”\r\n\r\nThe reasoning, however, if not altogether unsatisfactory, is by no\r\nmeans so conclusive as Herr Vögel appears to think. It is not clear how\r\nthe incandescent portion of the surface could possibly cool in any\r\ngreat degree while enormous quantities of gas more intensely heated (by\r\nthe hypothesis) remained around the star. The more rapid decrease in\r\nthe violet and blue parts of the spectrum than in the red and orange\r\nis explicable as an effect of absorption, at least as readily as by\r\nthe hypothesis that burning solid or liquid matter had cooled. Vögel\r\nhimself could only regard the other bands which crossed the spectrum\r\nas absorption-bands. And the absorption of light from the continuous\r\nspectrum in these parts (that is, not where the bright lines belonging\r\nto the gaseous matter lay) could not possibly result from absorption\r\nproduced by those gases. If other gases were in question, gases which,\r\nby cooling with the cooling surface, had become capable of thus\r\nabsorbing light from special parts of the spectrum, how is it that\r\nbefore, when these gases were presumably intensely heated, they did not\r\nindicate their presence by bright bands? Bright bands, indeed, were\r\nseen, which eventually faded out of view, but these bright bands did\r\nnot occupy the position where, later on, absorption-bands appeared.\r\n\r\nThe natural explanation of what had thus far been observed is different\r\nfrom that advanced by Vögel, though we must not assume that because\r\nit is the natural, it is necessarily the true explanation. It is\r\nthis—that the source of that part of the star’s light which gave the\r\nbright-line spectrum, or the spectrum indicative of gaseity, belongs\r\nto the normal condition of the star, and not to gases poured forth,\r\nin consequence of some abnormal state of things, from the sun’s\r\ninterior. We should infer naturally, though again I say not _therefore_\r\ncorrectly, that if a star spectroscope had been directed upon the\r\nplace occupied by the new star before it began to shine with unusual\r\nsplendour, the bright-line spectrum would have been observed. Some\r\nexceptional cause would then seem to have aroused the entire surface\r\nof the star to shine with a more intense brightness, the matter thus\r\n(presumably) more intensely heated being such as would give out the\r\ncombined continuous and bright-line spectrum, including the bright\r\nlines which, instead of fading out, shone with at least relatively\r\nsuperior brightness as the star faded from view. The theory that, on\r\nthe contrary, the matter giving these more persistent lines was that\r\nwhose emission caused the star’s increase of lustre, seems at least not\r\nproven, and I would go so far as to say that it accords ill with the\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe question, be it noted, is simply whether we should regard the kind\r\nof light which lasts longest in this star as it fades out of view as\r\nmore probably belonging to the star’s abnormal brightness or to its\r\nnormal luminosity. It seems to me there can be little doubt that the\r\npersistence of this part of the star’s light points to the latter\r\nrather than to the former view.\r\n\r\nLet it also be noticed that the changes which had been observed thus\r\nfar were altogether unlike those which had been observed in the case of\r\nthe star in the Northern Crown, and therefore cannot justly be regarded\r\nas pointing to the same explanation. As the star in the Crown faded\r\nfrom view, the bright lines indicative of glowing hydrogen died out,\r\nand only the ordinary stellar spectrum remained. In the case of the\r\nstar in the Swan, the part of the spectrum corresponding to stellar\r\nlight faded gradually from view, and bright lines only were left, at\r\nleast as conspicuous parts of the star’s spectrum. So that whereas one\r\norb seemed to have faded into a faint star, the other seemed fading\r\nout into a nebula—not merely passing into such a condition as to\r\nshine with light indicative of gaseity, but actually so changing as\r\nto shine with light of the very tints (or, more strictly, of the very\r\nwave-lengths) observed in all the gaseous nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThe strange eventful history of the new star in Cygnus did not end\r\nhere, however. We may even say, indeed, that it has not ended yet. But\r\nanother chapter can already be written.\r\n\r\nVögel ceased from observing the star in March, precisely when\r\nobservation seemed to promise the most interesting results. At most\r\nother observatories, also, no observations were made for about half\r\na year. At the Dunecht Observatory[17] pressure of work relating to\r\nMars interfered with the prosecution of those observations which\r\nhad been commenced early in the year. But on September 3, Lord\r\nLindsay’s 15-inch reflector was directed upon the star. A star was\r\nstill shining where the new star’s yellow lustre had been displayed\r\nin November, 1876; but now the star shone with a faint blue colour.\r\nUnder spectroscopic examination, however, the light from this seeming\r\nblue star was found not to be starlight, properly speaking, at all.\r\nIt formed no rainbow-tinted spectrum, but gave light of only a single\r\ncolour. The single line now seen was that which at the time of Vögel’s\r\nlatest observation had become the strongest of the bright lines of\r\nthe originally complex spectrum of the so-called new star. It is the\r\nbrightest of the lines given by the gaseous nebulæ. In fact, if nothing\r\nhad been known about this body before the spectroscopic observation\r\nof September 3 was made, the inference from the spectrum given by the\r\nblue star would undoubtedly have been that the object is in reality a\r\nsmall nebula of the planetary sort, very similar to that one close by\r\nthe pole of the ecliptic, which gave Huggins the first evidence of the\r\ngaseity of nebulæ, but very much smaller. I would specially direct the\r\nreader’s attention, in fact, to Huggins’s account of his observation\r\nof that planetary nebula in the Dragon. “On August 19, 1864,” he says,\r\n“I directed the telescope armed with the spectrum apparatus to this\r\nnebula. At first I suspected some derangement of the instrument had\r\ntaken place, for no spectrum was seen, but only” a single line of\r\nlight. “I then found that the light of this nebula, unlike any other\r\nextra-terrestrial light which had yet been subjected by me to prismatic\r\nanalysis, was not composed of light of different refrangibilities, and\r\ntherefore could not form a spectrum. A great part of the light from\r\nthis nebula is monochromatic, and after passing through the prisms\r\nremains concentrated in a bright line.” A more careful examination\r\nshowed that not far from the bright line was a much fainter line;\r\nand beyond this, again, a third exceedingly faint line was seen. The\r\nbrightest of the three lines was a line of nitrogen corresponding in\r\nposition with the brightest of the lines in the spectrum of our own\r\nair. The faintest corresponded in position with a line of hydrogen. The\r\nother has not yet been associated with a known line of any element.\r\nBesides the faint lines, Dr. Huggins perceived an exceedingly faint\r\ncontinuous spectrum on both sides of the group of bright lines; he\r\nsuspected, however, that this faint spectrum was not continuous, but\r\ncrossed by dark spaces. Later observations on other nebulæ induced him\r\nto regard this faint continuous spectrum as due to the solid or liquid\r\nmatter of the nucleus, and as quite distinct from the bright lines into\r\nwhich nearly the whole of the light from the nebula is concentrated.\r\nThe fainter parts of the spectrum of the gaseous nebulæ, in fact,\r\ncorrespond to those parts of the spectrum of the “new star” in Cygnus\r\nwhich last remained visible, before the light assumed its present\r\nmonochromatic colour.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the significance of the evidence afforded by this\r\ndiscovery—not perhaps hoping at once to perceive the full meaning of\r\nthe discovery, but endeavouring to advance as far as we safely can in\r\nthe direction in which it seems to point.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, these broad facts: where no star had been known, an\r\nobject has for a while shone with stellar lustre, in this sense, that\r\nits light gave a rainbow-tinted spectrum not unlike that which is given\r\nby a certain order of stars; this object has gradually parted with its\r\nnew lustre, and in so doing the character of its spectrum has slowly\r\naltered, the continuous portion becoming fainter, and the chief lustre\r\nof the bright-line portion shifting from the hydrogen lines to a line\r\nwhich, there is every reason to believe, is absolutely identical with\r\nthe nebula nitrogen line: and lastly, the object has ceased to give\r\nany perceptible light, other than that belonging to this nitrogen line.\r\n\r\nNow it cannot, I think, be doubted that, accompanying the loss of\r\nlustre in this orb, there has been a corresponding loss of heat. The\r\ntheory that all the solid and liquid materials of the orb have been\r\nvaporized by intense heat, and that this vaporization has caused the\r\nloss of the star’s light (as a lime-light might die out with the\r\nconsumption of the lime, though the flame remained as hot as ever),\r\nis opposed by many considerations. It seems sufficient to mention\r\nthis, that if a mass of solid matter, like a dead sun or planet, were\r\nexposed to an intense heat, first raising it to incandescence, and\r\neventually altogether vaporizing its materials, although quite possibly\r\nthe time of its intensest lustre might precede the completion of the\r\nvaporization, yet certainly so soon as the vaporization was complete,\r\nthe spectrum of the newly vaporized mass would show multitudinous\r\nbright lines corresponding to the variety of material existing in the\r\nbody. No known fact of spectroscopic analysis lends countenance to the\r\nbelief that a solid or liquid mass, vaporized by intense heat, would\r\nshine thenceforth with monochromatic light.\r\n\r\nAgain, I think we are definitely compelled to abandon Vögel’s\r\nexplanation of the phenomena by Zöllner’s theory. The reasons which\r\nI have urged above are not only strengthened severally by the change\r\nwhich has taken place in the spectrum of the new star since Vögel\r\nobserved it, but an additional argument of overwhelming force has\r\nbeen introduced. If any one of the suns died out, a crust forming\r\nover its surface and this crust being either absolutely dark or only\r\nshining with very feeble lustre, the sun would still in one respect\r\nresemble all the suns which are spread over the heavens—it would show\r\nno visible disc, however great the telescopic power used in observing\r\nit. If the nearest of all the stars were as large, or even a hundred\r\ntimes as large, as Sirius, and were observed with a telescope of ten\r\ntimes greater magnifying power than any yet directed to the heavens,\r\nit would appear only as a point of light. If it lost the best part of\r\nits lustre, it would appear only as a dull point of light. Now the\r\nplanetary nebulæ show discs, sometimes of considerable breadth. Sir\r\nJ. Herschel, to whom and to Sir W. Herschel we owe the discovery and\r\nobservation of nearly all these objects, remarks that “the planetary\r\nnebulæ have, as their name imports, a near, in some instances a\r\nperfect, resemblance to planets, presenting discs round, or slightly\r\noval, in some quite sharply terminated, in others a little hazy or\r\nsoftened at the borders....” Among the most remarkable may be specified\r\none near the Cross, whose light is about equal to that of a star just\r\nvisible to the naked eye, “its diameter about twelve seconds, its\r\ndisc circular or very slightly elliptic, and with a clear, sharp,\r\nwell-defined outline, having exactly the appearance of a planet, with\r\nthe exception of its colour, which is a fine and full blue, verging\r\nsomewhat upon green.” But the largest of these planetary nebulæ, not\r\nfar from the southernmost of the two stars called the Pointers, has\r\na diameter of 2⅔ minutes of arc, “which, supposing it placed at a\r\ndistance from us not greater than that of the nearest known star of our\r\nnorthern heavens, would imply a linear diameter seven times greater\r\nthan that of the orbit of Neptune.” The actual volume of this object,\r\non this assumption, would exceed our sun’s ten million million times.\r\nNo one supposes that this planetary nebula, shining with a light\r\nindicative of gaseity, has a mass exceeding our sun’s in this enormous\r\ndegree. It probably has so small a mean density as not greatly to\r\nexceed, or perhaps barely to equal, our sun in mass. Now though the\r\n“new star” in Cygnus presented no measurable disc, and still shines\r\nas a mere blue point in the largest telescope, yet inasmuch as its\r\nspectrum associated it with the planetary and gaseous nebulæ, which\r\nwe know to be much larger bodies than the stars, it must be regarded,\r\nin its present condition, as a planetary nebula, though a small one;\r\nand since we cannot for a moment imagine that the monstrous planetary\r\nnebulæ just described are bodies which once were suns, but whose crust\r\nhas now become non-luminous, while around the crust masses of gas shine\r\nwith a faint luminosity, so are we precluded from believing that this\r\nsmaller member of the same family is in that condition.\r\n\r\nIt _is_ conceivable (and the possibility must be taken into account\r\nin any attempt to interpret the phenomena of the new star) that when\r\nshining as a star, the new orb, so far as this unusual lustre was\r\nconcerned, was of sunlike dimensions. For we cannot tell whether the\r\nsurface which gave the strong light was less or greater than, or equal\r\nto, that which is now shining with monochromatic light. Very likely,\r\nif we had been placed where we could have seen the full dimensions of\r\nthe planetary nebula as it at present exists, we should have found\r\nonly its nuclear part glowing suddenly with increased lustre, which,\r\nafter very rapidly attaining its maximum, gradually died out again,\r\nleaving the nebula as it had been before. But that the mass now shining\r\nwith monochromatic light is, I will not say enormously large, but\r\nof exceedingly small mean density, so that it is enormously large\r\ncompared with the dimensions it would have if its entire substance were\r\ncompressed till it had the same mean density as our own sun, must be\r\nregarded as, to all intents and purposes, certain.\r\n\r\nWe certainly have not here, then, the case of a sun which has grown\r\nold and dead and dark save at the surface, but within whose interior\r\nfire has still remained, only waiting some disturbing cause to enable\r\nit for a while to rush forth. If we could suppose that in such a case\r\nthere _could_ be such changes as the spectroscope has indicated—that\r\nthe bright lines of the gaseous outbursting matter would, during the\r\nearlier period of the outburst, show on a bright continuous background,\r\ndue to the glowing lips of the opening through which the matter had\r\nrushed, but later would shine alone, becoming also fewer in number,\r\ntill at last only one was left,—we should find ourselves confronted\r\nwith the stupendous difficulty that that single remaining line is the\r\nbright line of the planetary and other gaseous nebulæ. Any hypothesis\r\naccounting for its existence in the spectrum of the faint blue starlike\r\nobject into which the star in Cygnus has faded ought to be competent\r\nto explain its existence in the spectrum of those nebulæ. But _this_\r\nhypothesis certainly does not so explain its existence in the nebular\r\nspectrum. The nebulæ cannot be suns which have died out save for the\r\nlight of gaseous matter surrounding them, for they are millions, or\r\nrather millions of millions, of times too large. If, for instance, a\r\nnebula, like the one above described as lying near the southernmost\r\nPointer, were a mass of this kind, having the same mean density as\r\nthe sun, and lying only at the distance of the nearest of the stars\r\nfrom us, then not only would it have the utterly monstrous dimensions\r\nstated by Sir J. Herschel, but it would in the most effective way\r\nperturb the whole solar system. With a diameter exceeding seven times\r\nthat of the orbit of Neptune, it would have a volume, and therefore a\r\nmass, exceeding our sun’s volume and mass more than eleven millions\r\nof millions of times. But its distance on this assumption would be\r\nonly about two hundred thousand times the sun’s, and its attraction\r\nreduced, as compared with his, on this account only forty thousand\r\nmillions of times. So that its attraction on the sun and on the earth\r\nwould be greater than his attraction on the earth, in the same degree\r\nthat eleven millions are greater than forty thousand—or two hundred\r\nand seventy-five times. The sun, despite his enormous distance from\r\nsuch a mass, would be compelled to fall very quickly into it, unless\r\nhe circuited (with all his family) around it in about one-sixteenth of\r\na year, which most certainly he does not do. Nor would increasing the\r\ndistance at which we assume the star to lie have any effect to save\r\nthe sun from being thus perturbed, but the reverse. If we double for\r\ninstance our estimate of the nebula’s distance, we increase eightfold\r\nour estimate of its mass, while we only diminish its attraction on\r\nour sun fourfold on account of increased distance; so that now its\r\nattraction on our sun would be one-fourth its former attraction\r\nmultiplied by eight, or twice our former estimate. We cannot suppose\r\nthe nebula to be much nearer than the nearest star. Again, we cannot\r\nsuppose that the light of these gaseous nebulæ comes from some bright\r\norb within them of only starlike apparent dimensions, for in that case\r\nwe should constantly recognize such starlike nucleus, which is not the\r\ncase. Moreover, the bright-line spectrum from one of these nebulæ comes\r\nfrom the whole nebula, as is proved by the fact that if the slit of the\r\nspectroscope be opened it becomes possible to see three spectroscopic\r\nimages of the nebula itself, not merely the three bright lines.\r\n\r\nSo that, if we assume the so-called star in Cygnus to be now like other\r\nobjects giving the same monochromatic spectrum—and this seems the only\r\nlegitimate assumption—we are compelled to believe that the light now\r\nreaching us comes from a nebulous mass, not from the faintly luminous\r\nenvelope of a dead sun. Yet, remembering that when at its brightest\r\nthis orb gave a spectrum resembling in general characteristics that of\r\nother stars or suns, and closely resembling even in details that of\r\nstars like Gamma Cassiopeiæ, we are compelled by parity of reasoning\r\nto infer that when the so-called new star was so shining, the greater\r\npart of its light came from a sunlike mass. Thus, then, we are led\r\nto the conclusion that in the case of this body we have a nucleus or\r\ncentral mass, and that around this central mass there is a quantity of\r\ngaseous matter, resembling in constitution that which forms the bulk\r\nof the other gaseous nebulæ. The denser nucleus ordinarily shines with\r\nso faint a lustre that the continuous spectrum from its light is too\r\nfaint to be discerned with the same spectroscopic means by which the\r\nbright lines of the gaseous portion are shown; and the gaseous portion\r\nordinarily shines with so faint a lustre that its bright lines would\r\nnot be discernible on the continuous background of a stellar spectrum.\r\nThrough some cause unknown—possibly (as suggested in an article on\r\nthe earlier history of this same star in my “Myths and Marvels of\r\nAstronomy”) the rush of a rich and dense flight of meteors upon the\r\ncentral mass—the nucleus was roused to a degree of heat far surpassing\r\nits ordinary temperature. Thus for a time it glowed as a sun. At the\r\nsame time the denser central portions of the nebulous matter were\r\nalso aroused to intenser heat, and the bright lines which ordinarily\r\n(and certainly at present) would not stand out bright against the\r\nrainbow-tinted background of a stellar spectrum, showed brightly upon\r\nthe continuous spectrum of the new star. Then as the rush of meteors\r\nupon the nucleus and on the surrounding nebulous matter ceased—if\r\nthat be the true explanation of the orb’s accession of lustre—or as\r\nthe cause of the increase of brightness, whatever that cause may have\r\nbeen, ceased to act, the central orb slowly returned to its usual\r\ntemperature, the nebulous matter also cooling, the continuous spectrum\r\nslowly fading out, the denser parts of the nebulous matter exercising\r\nalso a selective absorption (explaining the bands seen in the spectrum\r\nat this stage) which gradually became a continuous absorption—that\r\nis, affected the entire spectrum. Those component gases, also, of the\r\nnebulous portion which had for a while been excited to sufficient heat\r\nto show their bright lines, cooled until their lines disappeared, and\r\nnone remained visible except for a while the three usual nebular lines,\r\nand latterly (owing to still further cooling) only the single line\r\ncorresponding to the monochromatic light of the fainter gaseous nebulæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_STAR-GROUPING, STAR-DRIFT, AND STAR-MIST._\r\n\r\n_A Lecture delivered at the Royal Institution on May 6, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly a century has passed since the greatest astronomer the world has\r\never known—the Newton of observational astronomy, as he has justly\r\nbeen called by Arago—conceived the daring thought that he would gauge\r\nthe celestial depths. And because in his day, as indeed in our own,\r\nvery little was certainly known respecting the distribution of the\r\nstars, he was forced to found his researches upon a guess. He supposed\r\nthat the stars, not only those visible to the naked eye, but all that\r\nare seen in the most powerful telescopes, are suns, distributed with\r\na certain general uniformity throughout space. It is my purpose to\r\nattempt to prove that—as Sir Wm. Herschel was himself led to suspect\r\nduring the progress of his researches—this guess was a mistaken one;\r\nthat but a small proportion of the stars can be regarded as real suns;\r\nand that in place of the uniformity of distribution conceived by Sir\r\nWm. Herschel, the chief characteristic of the sidereal system is\r\n_infinite variety_.\r\n\r\nIn order that the arguments on which these views are based may be\r\nclearly apprehended, it will be necessary to recall the main results of\r\nSir Wm. Herschel’s system of star-grouping.\r\n\r\nDirecting one of his 20-feet reflectors to different parts of the\r\nheavens, he counted the stars seen in the field of view. Assuming that\r\nthe telescope really reached the limits of the sidereal system, it is\r\nclear that the number of stars seen in any direction affords a means\r\nof estimating the relative extension of the system in that direction,\r\nprovided always that the stars are really distributed throughout the\r\nsystem with a certain approach to uniformity. Where many stars are\r\nseen, there the system has its greatest extension; where few, there the\r\nlimits of the system must be nearest to us.\r\n\r\nSir Wm. Herschel was led by this process of star-grouping to the\r\nconclusion that the sidereal system has the figure of a cloven disc.\r\nThe stars visible to the naked eye lie far within the limits of\r\nthis disc. Stars outside the relatively narrow limits of the sphere\r\nincluding all the visible stars, are separately invisible. But where\r\nthe system has its greatest extension these orbs produce collectively\r\nthe diffused light which forms the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, applying a similar series of researches to the\r\nsouthern heavens, was led to a very similar conclusion. His view of the\r\nsidereal system differs chiefly in this respect from his father’s, that\r\nhe considered the stars within certain limits of distance from the sun\r\nto be spread less richly through space than those whose united lustre\r\nproduces the milky light of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that if the supposition on which these views are based\r\nis just, the three following results are to be looked for.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the stars visible to the naked eye would be\r\ndistributed with a certain general uniformity over the celestial\r\nsphere; so that if on the contrary we find certain extensive regions\r\nover which such stars are strewn much more richly than over the rest of\r\nthe heavens, we must abandon Sir Wm. Herschel’s fundamental hypothesis\r\nand all the conclusions which have been based upon it.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we ought to find no signs of the aggregation\r\nof lucid stars into streams or clustering groups. If we should find\r\nsuch associated groups, we must abandon the hypothesis of uniform\r\ndistribution and all the conclusions founded on it.\r\n\r\nThirdly, and most obviously of all, the lucid stars ought not to be\r\nassociated in a marked manner with the figure of the Milky Way. To\r\ntake an illustrative instance. When we look through a glass window at\r\na distant landscape we do not find that the specks in the substance\r\nof the glass seem to follow the outline of valleys, hills, trees, or\r\nwhatever features the landscape may present. In like manner, regarding\r\nthe sphere of the lucid stars as in a sense the window through which we\r\nview the Milky Way, we ought not to find these stars, which are so near\r\nto us, associated with the figure of the Milky Way, whose light comes\r\nfrom distances so enormously exceeding those which separate us from the\r\nlucid stars. Here again, then, if there should appear signs of such\r\nassociation, we must abandon the theory that the sidereal system is\r\nconstituted as Sir Wm. Herschel supposed.\r\n\r\nIt should further be remarked that the three arguments derived from\r\nthese relations are independent of each other. They are not as three\r\nlinks of a chain, any one of which being broken the chain is broken.\r\nThey are as three strands of a triple cord. If one strand holds, the\r\ncord holds. It may be shown that all three are to be trusted.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected, however, that the stars as actually seen\r\nshould exhibit these relations, since far the larger number are but\r\nfaintly visible; so that the eye would look in vain for the signs of\r\nlaw among them, even though law may be there. What is necessary is that\r\nmaps should be constructed on a uniform and intelligible plan, and that\r\nin these maps the faint stars should be made bright, and the bright\r\nstars brighter.\r\n\r\nThe maps exhibited during this discourse [since published as my\r\n“Library Atlas”] have been devised for this purpose amongst others.\r\nThere are twelve of them, but they overlap, so that in effect each\r\ncovers a tenth part of the heavens. There is first a north-polar map,\r\nthen five maps symmetrically placed around it; again, there is a\r\nsouth-polar map, and five maps symmetrically placed round that map; and\r\nthese five so fit in with the first five as to complete the enclosure\r\nof the whole sphere. In effect, every map of the twelve has five maps\r\nsymmetrically placed around it and overlapping it.\r\n\r\nSince the whole heavens contain but 5932 stars visible to the naked\r\neye, each of the maps should contain on the average about 593 stars.\r\nBut instead of this being the case, some of the maps contain many more\r\nthan their just proportion of stars, while in others the number as\r\ngreatly falls short of the average. One recognizes, by combining these\r\nindications, the existence of a roughly circular region, rich in stars,\r\nin the northern heavens, and of another, larger and richer, in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nTo show the influence of these rich regions, it is only necessary to\r\nexhibit the numerical relations presented by the maps.\r\n\r\nThe north-polar map, in which the largest part of the northern rich\r\nregion falls, contains no less than 693 lucid stars, of which upwards\r\nof 400 fall within the half corresponding to the rich region. Of the\r\nadjacent maps, two contain upwards of 500 stars, while the remaining\r\nthree contain about 400 each. Passing to the southern hemisphere, we\r\nfind that the south-polar map, which falls wholly within a rich region,\r\ncontains no less than 1132 stars! One of the adjacent maps contains 834\r\nstars, and the four others exhibit numbers ranging from 527 to 595.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly impossible not to recognize so unequal a distribution as\r\nexhibiting the existence of special laws of stellar aggregation.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy, too, that the greater Magellanic cloud falls in\r\nthe heart of the southern rich region. Were there not other signs\r\nthat this wonderful object is really associated with the sidereal\r\nsystem, it might be rash to recognize this relation as indicating the\r\nexistence of a physical connection between the Nubecula Major and\r\nthe southern region rich in stars. Astronomers have indeed so long\r\nregarded the Nubeculæ as belonging neither to the sidereal nor to the\r\nnebular systems, that they are not likely to recognize very readily\r\nthe existence of any such connection. Yet how strangely perverse is\r\nthe reasoning which has led astronomers so to regard these amazing\r\nobjects. Presented fairly, that reasoning amounts simply to this: The\r\nMagellanic clouds contain stars and they contain nebulæ; therefore\r\nthey are neither nebular nor stellar. Can perversity of reasoning be\r\npushed further? Is not the obvious conclusion this, that since nebulæ\r\nand stars are _seen_ to be intermixed in the Nubeculæ, the nebular and\r\nstellar systems form in reality but one complex system?\r\n\r\nAs to the existence of star-streams and clustering aggregations, we\r\nhave also evidence of a decisive character. There is a well-marked\r\nstream of stars running from near Capella towards Monoceros. Beyond\r\nthis lies a long dark rift altogether bare of lucid orbs, beyond which\r\nagain lies an extensive range of stars, covering Gemini, Cancer, and\r\nthe southern parts of Leo. This vast system of stars resembles a\r\ngigantic sidereal billow flowing towards the Milky Way as towards some\r\nmighty shore-line. Nor is this description altogether fanciful; since\r\none of the most marked instances of star-drift presently to be adduced\r\nrefers to this very region. These associated stars _are_ urging their\r\nway towards the galaxy, and that at a rate which, though seemingly slow\r\nwhen viewed from beyond so enormous a gap as separates us from this\r\nsystem, must in reality be estimated by millions of miles in every year.\r\n\r\nOther streams and clustering aggregations there are which need not\r\nhere be specially described. But it is worth noticing that all the\r\nwell-marked streams recognized by the ancients seem closely associated\r\nwith the southern rich region already referred to. This is true of the\r\nstars forming the River Eridanus, the serpent Hydra, and the streams\r\nfrom the water-can of Aquarius. It is also noteworthy that in each\r\ninstance a portion of the stream lies outside the rich region, the rest\r\nwithin it; while all the streams which lie on the same side of the\r\ngalaxy tend towards the two Magellanic clouds.\r\n\r\nMost intimate signs of association between lucid stars and the galaxy\r\ncan be recognized—(i.) in the part extending from Cygnus to Aquila;\r\n(ii.) in the part from Perseus to Monoceros; (iii.) over the ship Argo;\r\nand (iv.) near Crux and the feet of Centaurus.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the subject of Star-drift, three broad facts may\r\nbe stated. They are, I believe, now recognized for the first time, and\r\nseem decisive of the existence of special laws of distribution among\r\nthe stars:—\r\n\r\nFirst, the rich southern region, though covering but a sixth part of\r\nthe heavens, contains one-third of all the lucid stars, leaving only\r\ntwo-thirds for the remaining five-sixths of the heavens.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if the two rich regions and the Milky Way be considered as\r\none part of the heavens, the rest as another, then the former part is\r\nthree times as richly strewn with lucid stars as the second.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the southern hemisphere contains one thousand more lucid\r\nstars than the northern, a fact which cannot but be regarded as most\r\nstriking when it is remembered that the total number of stars visible\r\nto ordinary eyesight in both hemispheres falls short of 6000.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years ago, the idea suggested itself to me that if\r\nthe proper motions of the stars were examined, they would be found\r\nto convey clear information respecting the existence of variety of\r\nstructure, and special laws of distribution within the sidereal system.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the mere amount of a star’s apparent motion must\r\nbe regarded as affording a means of estimating the star’s distance.\r\nThe nearer a moving object is, the faster it will seem to move, and\r\n_vice versâ_. Of course in individual instances little reliance can be\r\nplaced on this indication; but by taking the average proper motions of\r\na set of stars, a trustworthy measure may be obtained of their average\r\ndistance, as compared with the average distance of another set.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have in this process the means of settling the question\r\nwhether the apparent brightness of a star is indeed a test of relative\r\nnearness. According to accepted theories the sixth-magnitude stars\r\nare ten or twelve times as far off as those of the first magnitude.\r\nHence their motions should, on the average, be correspondingly small.\r\nNow, to make assurance doubly sure, I divided the stars into two sets,\r\nthe first including the stars of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, the second\r\nincluding those of the 4th, 5th, and 6th magnitude. According to\r\naccepted views, the average proper motion for the first set should be\r\nabout five times as great as that for the second. I was prepared to\r\nfind it about three times as great; that is, not so much greater as\r\nthe accepted theories require, but still considerably greater. To my\r\nsurprise, I found that the average proper motion of the brighter orders\r\nof stars is barely equal to that of the three lower orders.\r\n\r\nThis proves beyond all possibility of question that by far the greater\r\nnumber of the fainter orders of stars (I refer here throughout to lucid\r\nstars) owe their faintness not to vastness of distance, but to real\r\nrelative minuteness.\r\n\r\nTo pass over a number of other modes of research, the actual mapping of\r\nthe stellar motions, and the discovery of the peculiarity to which I\r\nhave given the name of star-drift, remain to be considered.\r\n\r\nIn catalogues it is not easy to recognize any instances of community of\r\nmotion which may exist among the stars, owing to the method in which\r\nthe stars are arranged. What is wanted in this case (as in many others\r\nwhich yet remain to be dealt with) is the adoption of a plan by which\r\nsuch relations may be rendered obvious to the eye. The plan I adopted\r\nwas to attach to each star in my maps a small arrow, indicating the\r\namount and direction of that star’s apparent motion in 36,000 years\r\n(the time-interval being purposely lengthened, as otherwise most of the\r\narrows would have been too small to be recognized). When this was done,\r\nseveral well-marked instances of community of motion could immediately\r\nbe recognized.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to premise, however, that before the experiment was\r\ntried, there were reasons for feeling very doubtful whether it would\r\nsucceed. A system of stars might really be drifting athwart the\r\nheavens, and yet the drift might be rendered unrecognizable through\r\nthe intermixture of more distant or nearer systems having motions of\r\nanother sort and seen accidentally in the same general direction.\r\n\r\nThis was found to be the case, indeed, in several instances. Thus the\r\nstars in the constellation Ursa Major, and neighbouring stars in Draco,\r\nexhibit two well-marked directions of drift. The stars β, γ, δ, ε, and\r\nζ of the Great Bear, besides two companions of the last-named star,\r\nare travelling in one direction, with equal velocity, and clearly form\r\none system. The remaining stars in the neighbourhood are travelling in\r\na direction almost exactly the reverse. But even this relation, thus\r\nrecognized in a region of diverse motions, is full of interest. Baron\r\nMädler, the well-known German astronomer, recognizing the community\r\nof motion between ζ Ursæ and its companions, calculated the cyclic\r\nrevolution of the system to be certainly not less than 7000 years. But\r\nwhen the complete system of stars showing this motion is considered,\r\nwe get a cyclic period so enormous, that not only the life of man,\r\nbut the life of the human race, the existence of our earth, nay, even\r\nthe existence of the solar system, must be regarded as a mere day in\r\ncomparison with that tremendous cycle.\r\n\r\nThen there are other instances of star-drift where, though two\r\ndirections of motion are not intermixed, the drifting nature of the\r\nmotion is not at once recognized, because of the various distances at\r\nwhich the associated stars lie from the eye.\r\n\r\nA case of this kind is to be met with in the stars forming the\r\nconstellation Taurus. It was here that Mädler recognized a community\r\nof motion among the stars, but he did not interpret this as I do. He\r\nhad formed the idea that the whole of the sidereal system must be in\r\nmotion around some central point; and for reasons which need not here\r\nbe considered, he was led to believe that in whatever direction the\r\ncentre of motion may lie, the stars seen in that general direction\r\nwould exhibit a community of motion. Then, that he might not have to\r\nexamine the proper motions all over the heavens, he inquired in what\r\ndirection (in all probability) the centre of motion may be supposed\r\nto lie. Coming to the conclusion that it must lie towards Taurus,\r\nhe examined the proper motions in that constellation, and found a\r\ncommunity of motion which led him to regard Alcyone, the chief star of\r\nthe Pleiades, as the centre around which the sidereal system is moving.\r\nHad he examined further he would have found more marked instances of\r\ncommunity of motion in other parts of the heavens, a circumstance which\r\nwould have at once compelled him to abandon his hypothesis of a central\r\nsun in the Pleiades, or at least to lay no stress on the evidence\r\nderivable from the community of motion in Taurus.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable instance of star-drift is that observed in\r\nthe constellations Gemini and Cancer. Here the stars seem to set bodily\r\ntowards the neighbouring part of the Milky Way. The general drift\r\nin that direction is too marked, and affects too many stars, to be\r\nregarded as by any possibility referable to accidental coincidence.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that if the community of star-drift should be\r\nrecognized (or I prefer to say, _when_ it is recognized), astronomers\r\nwill have the means of determining the relative distances of the\r\nstars of a drifting system. For differences in the apparent direction\r\nand amount of motion can be due but to differences of distance and\r\nposition, and the determination of these differences becomes merely a\r\nquestion of perspective.[18]\r\n\r\nBefore long it is likely that the theory of star-drift will be\r\nsubjected to a crucial test, since spectroscopic analysis affords the\r\nmeans of determining the stellar motions of recess or approach. The\r\ntask is a very difficult one, but astronomers have full confidence that\r\nin the able hands of Mr. Huggins it will be successfully accomplished.\r\nI await the result with full confidence that it will confirm my views.\r\n(See pages 92–94 for the result.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning to the subject of Star-mist, under which head I include all\r\norders of nebulæ, I propose to deal with but a small proportion of the\r\nevidence I have collected to prove that none of the nebulæ are external\r\ngalaxies. That evidence has indeed become exceedingly voluminous.\r\n\r\nI shall dwell, therefore, on three points only.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the distribution of the nebulæ:—They are not spread with\r\nany approach to uniformity over the heavens, but are gathered into\r\nstreams and clusters. The one great law which characterizes their\r\ndistribution is an avoidance of the Milky Way and its neighbourhood.\r\nThis peculiarity has, strangely enough, been regarded by astronomers\r\nas showing that there is no association between the nebulæ and the\r\nsidereal system. They have forgotten that marked contrast is as clear\r\na sign of association as marked resemblance, and has always been so\r\nregarded by logicians.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are in the southern heavens two well-marked streams of\r\nnebulæ. Each of these streams is associated with an equally well-marked\r\nstream of stars. Each intermixed stream directs its course towards a\r\nMagellanic Cloud, one towards the Nubecula Minor, the other towards the\r\nNubecula Major. To these great clusters they flow, like rivers towards\r\nsome mighty lake. And within these clusters, which are doubtless\r\nroughly spherical in form, there are found intermixed in wonderful\r\nprofusion, stars, star-clusters, and all the orders of nebulæ. Can\r\nthese coincidences be regarded as accidental? And if not accidental,\r\nis not the lesson they clearly teach us this, that nebulæ form but\r\nportions of the sidereal system, associating themselves with stars on\r\nterms of equality (if one may so speak), even if single stars be not\r\nmore important objects in the scale of creation than these nebulous\r\nmasses, which have been so long regarded as equalling, if not outvying,\r\nthe sidereal system itself in extent?\r\n\r\nThe third point to which I wish to invite attention is the way in which\r\nin many nebulæ stars of considerable relative brightness, and belonging\r\nobviously to the sidereal system, are so associated with nebulous\r\nmasses as to leave no doubt whatever that these masses really cling\r\naround them. The association is in many instances far too marked to be\r\nregarded as the effect of accident.\r\n\r\nAmong other instances[19] may be cited the nebula round the stars _c_¹\r\nand _c_² in Orion. In this object two remarkable nebulous nodules\r\ncentrally surround two double stars. Admitting the association here to\r\nbe real (and no other explanation can reasonably be admitted), we are\r\nled to interesting conclusions respecting the whole of that wonderful\r\nnebulous region which surrounds the sword of Orion. We are led to\r\nbelieve that the other nebulæ in that region are really associated with\r\nthe fixed stars there; that it is not a mere coincidence, for instance,\r\nthat the middle star in the belt of Orion is involved in nebula, or\r\nthat the lowest star of the sword is similarly circumstanced. It is\r\na legitimate inference from the evidence that all the nebulæ in this\r\nregion belong to one great nebulous group, which extends its branches\r\nto these stars. As a mighty hand, this nebulous region seems to gather\r\nthe stars here into close association, showing us, in a way there is no\r\nmisinterpreting, that these stars form one system.\r\n\r\nThe nebula around the strange variable star, Eta Argûs, is another\r\nremarkable instance of this sort. More than two years ago I ventured\r\nto make two predictions about this object. The first was a tolerably\r\nsafe one. I expressed my belief that the nebula would be found to be\r\ngaseous. After Mr. Huggins’s discovery that the great Orion nebula is\r\ngaseous, it was not difficult to see that the Argo nebula must be\r\nso too. At any rate, this has been established by Captain Herschel’s\r\nspectroscopic researches. The other prediction was more venturesome.\r\nSir John Herschel, whose opinion on such points one would always\r\nprefer to share, had expressed his belief that the nebula lies far out\r\nin space beyond the stars seen in the same field of view. I ventured\r\nto express the opinion that those stars are involved in the nebula.\r\nLately there came news from Australia that Mr. Le Sueur, with the\r\ngreat reflector erected at Melbourne, has found that the nebula has\r\nchanged largely in shape since Sir John Herschel observed it. Mr. Le\r\nSueur accordingly expressed his belief that the nebula lies _nearer_ to\r\nus than the fixed stars seen in the same field of view. More lately,\r\nhowever, he has found that the star Eta Argûs is shining with the\r\nlight of burning hydrogen, and he expresses his belief that the star\r\nhas consumed the nebulous matter near it. Without agreeing with this\r\nview, I recognize in it a proof that Mr. Le Sueur now considers the\r\nnebula to be really associated with the stars around it. My belief is\r\nthat as the star recovers its brilliancy observation will show that the\r\nnebula in its immediate neighbourhood becomes brighter (_not_ fainter\r\nthrough being consumed as fuel). In fact, I am disposed to regard the\r\nvariations of the nebula as systematic, and due to orbital motions\r\namong its various portions around neighbouring stars.\r\n\r\nAs indicative of other laws of association bearing on the relations I\r\nhave been dealing with, I may mention the circumstance that red stars\r\nand variable stars affect the neighbourhood of the Milky Way or of\r\nwell-marked star-streams. The constellation Orion is singularly rich in\r\nobjects of this class. It is here that the strange “variable” Betelgeux\r\nlies. At present this star shows no sign of variation, but a few years\r\nago it exhibited remarkable changes. One is invited to believe that\r\nthe star may have been carried by its proper motion into regions where\r\nthere is a more uniform distribution of the material whence this orb\r\nrecruits its fires. It may be that in the consideration of such causes\r\nof variation affecting our sun in long past ages a more satisfactory\r\nexplanation than any yet obtained may be found of the problem\r\ngeologists find so perplexing—the former existence of a tropical\r\nclimate in places within the temperate zone, or even near the Arctic\r\nregions.[20]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt remains that I should exhibit the general results to which I have\r\nbeen led. It has seemed to many that my views tend largely to diminish\r\nour estimate of the extent of the sidereal system. The exact reverse\r\nis the case. According to accepted views there lie within the range of\r\nour most powerful telescopes millions of millions of suns. According\r\nto mine the primary suns within the range of our telescopes must be\r\ncounted by tens of thousands, or by hundreds of thousands at the\r\noutside. What does this diminution of numbers imply but that the space\r\nseparating sun from sun is enormously greater than accepted theories\r\nwould permit? And this increase implies an enormous increase in the\r\nestimate we are to form of the vital energies of individual suns. For\r\nthe vitality of a sun, if one may be permitted the expression, is\r\nmeasured not merely by the amount of matter over which it exercises\r\ncontrol, but by the extent of space within which that matter is\r\ndistributed. Take an orb a thousand times vaster than our sun, and\r\nspread over its surface an amount of matter exceeding a thousandfold\r\nthe combined mass of all the planets of the solar system:—So far as\r\nliving force is concerned, the result is—_nil_. But distribute that\r\nmatter throughout a vast space all round the orb:—That orb becomes\r\nat once fit to be the centre of a host of dependent worlds. Again,\r\naccording to accepted theories, when the astronomer has succeeded in\r\nresolving the milky light of a portion of the galaxy into stars, he\r\nhas in that direction, at any rate, reached the limits of the sidereal\r\nsystem. According to my views, what he has really done has been but to\r\nanalyze a definite aggregation of stars, a mere corner of that great\r\nsystem. Yet once more, according to accepted views, thousands and\r\nthousands of galaxies, external to the sidereal system, can be seen\r\nwith powerful telescopes. If I am right, the external star-systems lie\r\nfar beyond the reach of the most powerful telescope man has yet been\r\nable to construct, insomuch that perchance the nearest of the outlying\r\ngalaxies may lie a million times beyond the range even of the mighty\r\nmirror of the great Rosse telescope.\r\n\r\nBut this is little. Wonderful as is the extent of the sidereal system\r\nas thus viewed, even more wonderful is its infinite variety. We know\r\nhow largely modern discoveries have increased our estimate of the\r\ncomplexity of the planetary system. Where the ancients recognized\r\nbut a few planets, we now see, besides the planets, the families of\r\nsatellites; we see the rings of Saturn, in which minute satellites must\r\nbe as the sands on the sea-shore for multitude; the wonderful zone\r\nof asteroids; myriads on myriads of comets; millions on millions of\r\nmeteor-systems, gathering more and more richly around the sun, until\r\nin his neighbourhood they form the crown of glory which bursts into\r\nview when he is totally eclipsed. But wonderful as is the variety seen\r\nwithin the planetary system, the variety within the sidereal system is\r\ninfinitely more amazing. Besides the single suns, there are groups and\r\nsystems and streams of primary suns; there are whole galaxies of minor\r\norbs; there are clustering stellar aggregations, showing every variety\r\nof richness, of figure, and of distribution; there are all the various\r\nforms of nebulæ, resolvable and irresolvable, circular, elliptical,\r\nand spiral; and lastly, there are irregular masses of luminous gas,\r\nclinging in fantastic convolutions around stars and star-systems. Nor\r\nis it unsafe to assert that other forms and variety of structure will\r\nyet be discovered, or that hundreds more exist which we may never hope\r\nto recognize.\r\n\r\nBut lastly, even more wonderful than the infinite variety of the\r\nsidereal system, is its amazing vitality. Instead of millions of inert\r\nmasses, we see the whole heavens instinct with energy—astir with busy\r\nlife. The great masses of luminous vapour, though occupying countless\r\nmillions of cubic miles of space, are moved by unknown forces like\r\nclouds before the summer breeze; star-mist is condensing into clusters;\r\nstar-clusters are forming into suns; streams and clusters of minor orbs\r\nare swayed by unknown attractive energies; and primary suns singly or\r\nin systems are pursuing their stately path through space, rejoicing as\r\ngiants to run their course, extending on all sides the mighty arm of\r\ntheir attraction, gathering from ever-new regions of space supplies of\r\nmotive energy, to be transformed into the various forms of force—light\r\nand heat and electricity—and distributed in lavish abundance to the\r\nworlds which circle round them.\r\n\r\nTruly may I say, in conclusion, that whether we regard its vast extent,\r\nits infinite variety, or the amazing vitality which pervades its every\r\nportion, the sidereal system is, of all the subjects man can study,\r\nthe most imposing and the most stupendous. It is as a book full of\r\nmighty problems—of problems which are as yet almost untouched by man,\r\nof problems which it might seem hopeless for him to attempt to solve.\r\nBut those problems are given to him for solution, and he _will_ solve\r\nthem, whenever he dares attempt to decipher aright the records of that\r\nwondrous volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MALLET’S THEORY OF VOLCANOES._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few subjects less satisfactorily treated in scientific\r\ntreatises than that which Humboldt calls the Reaction of the Earth’s\r\nInterior. We find, not merely in the configuration of the earth’s\r\ncrust, but in actual and very remarkable phenomena, evidence of\r\nsubterranean forces of great activity; and the problems suggested seem\r\nin no sense impracticable: yet no theory of the earth’s volcanic energy\r\nhas yet gained general acceptance. While the astronomer tells us of the\r\nconstitution of orbs millions of times further away than our own sun,\r\nthe geologist has hitherto been unable to give an account of the forces\r\nwhich agitate the crust of the orb on which we live.\r\n\r\nThe theory put forward respecting volcanic energy, however, by the\r\neminent seismologist Mallet, promises not merely to take the place\r\nof all others, but to gain a degree of acceptance which has not been\r\naccorded to any theory previously enunciated. It is, in principle,\r\nexceedingly simple, though many of the details (into which I do not\r\npropose to enter) involve questions of considerable difficulty.\r\n\r\nLet us, in the first place, consider briefly the various explanations\r\nwhich had been already advanced.\r\n\r\nThere was first the chemical theory of volcanic energy, the favourite\r\ntheory of Sir Humphry Davy. It is possible to produce on a small scale\r\nnearly all the phenomena due to subterranean activity, by simply\r\nbringing together certain substances, and leaving them to undergo\r\nthe chemical changes due to their association. As a familiar instance\r\nof explosive action thus occasioned, we need only mention the results\r\nexperienced when any one unfamiliar with the methods of treating\r\nlime endeavours over hastily to “slake” or “slack” it with water.\r\nIndeed, one of the strong points of the chemical theory consisted in\r\nthe circumstance that volcanoes only occur where water can reach the\r\nsubterranean regions—or, as Mallet expresses it, that “without water\r\nthere is no volcano.” But the theory is disposed of by the fact, now\r\ngenerally admitted, that the chemical energies of our earth’s materials\r\nwere almost wholly exhausted before the surface was consolidated.\r\n\r\nAnother inviting theory is that according to which the earth is\r\nregarded as a mere shell of solid matter surrounding a molten nucleus.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the whole interior of the earth\r\nis in a state of intense heat; and if the increase of heat with depth\r\n(as shown in our mines) is supposed to continue uniformly, we find that\r\nat very moderate depths a degree of heat must prevail sufficient to\r\nliquefy any known solids under ordinary conditions. But the conditions\r\nunder which matter exists a few miles only below the surface of the\r\nearth are not ordinary. The pressure enormously exceeds any which our\r\nphysicists can obtain experimentally. The ordinary distinction between\r\nsolids and liquids cannot exist at that enormous pressure. A mass\r\nof cold steel could be as plastic as any of the glutinous liquids,\r\nwhile the structural change which a solid undergoes in the process\r\nof liquefying could not take place under such pressure even at an\r\nenormously high temperature. It is now generally admitted that if the\r\nearth really has a molten nucleus, the solid crust must, nevertheless,\r\nbe far too thick to be in any way disturbed by changes affecting the\r\nliquid matter beneath.\r\n\r\nYet another theory has found advocates. The mathematician Hopkins,\r\nwhose analysis of the molten-nucleus theory was mainly effective in\r\nshowing that theory to be untenable, suggested that there may be\r\nisolated subterranean lakes of fiery matter, and that these may be the\r\ntrue seat of volcanic energy. But such lakes could not maintain their\r\nheat for ages, if surrounded (as the theory requires) by cooler solid\r\nmatter, especially as the theory also requires that water should have\r\naccess to them. It will be observed also that none of the theories just\r\ndescribed affords any direct account of those various features of the\r\nearth’s surface—mountain ranges, table-lands, volcanic regions, and so\r\non—which are undoubtedly due to the action of subterranean forces. The\r\ntheory advanced by Mr. Mallet is open to none of these objections. It\r\nseems, indeed, competent to explain all the facts which have hitherto\r\nappeared most perplexing.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized by physicists that our earth is gradually parting with\r\nits heat. As it cools it contracts. Now if this process of contraction\r\ntook place uniformly, no subterranean action would result. But if the\r\ninterior contracts more quickly than the crust, the latter must in some\r\nway or other force its way down to the retreating nucleus. Mr. Mallet\r\nshows that the hotter internal portion must contract faster than the\r\nrelatively cool crust; and then he shows that the shrinkage of the\r\ncrust is competent to occasion all the known phenomena of volcanic\r\naction. In the distant ages when the earth was still fashioning, the\r\nshrinkage produced the _irregularities of level_ which we recognize in\r\nthe elevation of the land and the depression of the ocean-bed. Then\r\ncame the period when as the crust shrank it formed _corrugations_, in\r\nother words, when the foldings and elevations of the somewhat thickened\r\ncrust gave rise to the mountain-ranges of the earth. Lastly, as the\r\nglobe gradually lost its extremely high temperature, the continuance\r\nof the same process of shrinkage led no longer to the formation of\r\nridges and table-lands, but to local crushing-down and dislocation.\r\nThis process is still going on, and Mr. Mallet not only recognizes here\r\nthe origin of earthquakes, and of the changes of level now in progress,\r\nbut the true cause of volcanic heat. The modern theory of heat as\r\na form of motion here comes into play. As the solid crust closes in\r\nupon the shrinking nucleus, the work expended in crushing down and\r\ndislocating the parts of the crust is transformed into heat, by which,\r\nat the places where the process goes on with greatest energy, “the\r\nmaterials of the rock so crushed and of that adjacent to it are heated\r\neven to fusion. The access of water to such points determines volcanic\r\neruption.”\r\n\r\nNow all this is not mere theorising. Mr. Mallet does not come before\r\nthe scientific world with an ingenious speculation, which may or may\r\nnot be confirmed by observation and experiment. He has measured and\r\nweighed the forces of which he speaks. He is able to tell precisely\r\nwhat proportion of the actual energy which must be developed as the\r\nearth contracts is necessary for the production of observed volcanic\r\nphenomena. It is probable that nine-tenths of those who have read\r\nthese lines would be disposed to think that the contraction of the\r\nearth must be far too slow to produce effects so stupendous as those\r\nwhich we recognize in the volcano and the earthquake. But Mr. Mallet\r\nis able to show, by calculations which cannot be disputed, that less\r\nthan one-fourth of the heat at present annually lost by the earth is\r\nsufficient to account for the total annual volcanic action, according\r\nto the best data at present in our possession.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I do not propose to follow out Mr. Mallet’s admirable\r\ntheory into all its details. I content myself with pointing out how\r\nexcellently it accounts for certain peculiarities of the earth’s\r\nsurface configuration. Few that have studied carefully drawn charts\r\nof the chief mountain-ranges can have failed to notice that the\r\narrangement of these ranges does not accord with the idea of upheaval\r\nthrough the action of internal forces. But it will be at once\r\nrecognized that the aspect of the mountain-ranges accords exactly with\r\nwhat would be expected to result from such a process of contraction\r\nas Mr. Mallet has indicated. The shrivelled skin of an apple affords\r\nno inapt representation of the corrugated surface of our earth,\r\nand according to the new theory, the shrivelling of such a skin is\r\nprecisely analogous to the processes at work upon the earth when\r\nmountain-ranges were being formed. Again, there are few students of\r\ngeology who have not found a source of perplexity in the foldings and\r\noverlappings of strata in mountainous regions. No forces of upheaval\r\nseem competent to produce this arrangement. But by the new theory this\r\nfeature of the earth’s surface is at once explained; indeed, no other\r\narrangement could be looked for.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that Mr. Mallet’s theory of Volcanic energy\r\nis completely opposed to ordinary ideas respecting earthquakes and\r\nvolcanoes. We have been accustomed vaguely to regard these phenomena\r\nas due to the eruptive outbursting power of the earth’s interior; we\r\nshall now have to consider them as due to the subsidence and shrinkage\r\nof the earth’s exterior. Mountains have not been upheaved, but valleys\r\nhave sunk down. And in another respect the new theory tends to modify\r\nviews which have been generally entertained in recent times. Our\r\nmost eminent geologists have taught that the earth’s internal forces\r\nmay be as active now as in the epochs when the mountain-ranges were\r\nformed. But Mr. Mallet’s theory tends to show that the volcanic energy\r\nof the earth is a declining force. Its chief action had already been\r\nexerted when mountains began to be formed; what remains now is but\r\nthe minutest fraction of the volcanic energy of the mountain-forming\r\nera; and each year, as the earth parts with more and more of its\r\ninternal heat, the sources of her subterranean energy are more and more\r\nexhausted. The thought once entertained by astronomers that the earth\r\nmight explode like a bomb, her scattered fragments producing a ring of\r\nbodies resembling the zone of asteroids, seems further than ever from\r\nprobability; if ever there was any danger of such a catastrophe, the\r\ndanger has long since passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TOWARDS THE NORTH POLE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Expedition which returned to our shores in the autumn of\r\n1876 may be regarded as having finally decided the question whether\r\nthe North Pole of the earth is accessible by the route through Smith’s\r\nSound—a route which may conveniently and properly be called the\r\nAmerican route. Attacks may hereafter be made on the Polar fastness\r\nfrom other directions; but it is exceedingly unlikely that this\r\ncountry, at any rate, will again attempt to reach the Pole along\r\nthe line of attack followed by Captain Nares’s expedition. I may be\r\nforgiven, perhaps, for regarding Arctic voyages made by the seamen\r\nof other nations as less likely to be successful than those made by\r\nmy own countrymen. It is not mere national prejudice which suggests\r\nthis opinion. It is the simple fact that hitherto the most successful\r\napproaches towards both the Northern and the Southern Poles have been\r\nmade by British sailors. Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since\r\nSir E. Parry made the nearest approach to the North Pole recorded up\r\nto that time; and although, in the interval between Parry’s expedition\r\nand Nares’s, no expedition had been sent out from our shores with\r\nthe object of advancing towards the Pole, while America, Sweden,\r\nRussia, and Germany sent out several, Parry’s attempt still remained\r\nunsurpassed and unequalled. At length it has been surpassed, but it has\r\nbeen by his own countrymen. In like manner, no nation has yet succeeded\r\nin approaching the Antarctic Pole so nearly, within many miles, as did\r\nCaptain Sir J. C. Ross in 1844. Considering these circumstances, and\r\nremembering the success which rewarded the efforts of Great Britain\r\nin the search for the North-West Passage, it cannot be regarded as\r\nnational prejudice to assert that events indicate the seamen of this\r\ncountry as exceptionally fitted to contend successfully against the\r\ndifficulties and the dangers of Arctic exploration. Should England,\r\nthen, give up the attempt to reach the North Pole by way of Smith’s\r\nSound and its northerly prolongation, it may fairly be considered\r\nunlikely that the Pole will ever be reached in that direction.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to examine the relative probable chances of success\r\nalong other routes which have either not been so thoroughly tried, or\r\nhave been tried under less favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nPassing over the unfortunate expedition under Hugh Willoughby in 1553,\r\nthe first attempt to penetrate within the Polar domain was made by\r\nHenry Hudson in 1607. The route selected was one which many regard\r\n(and I believe correctly) as the one on which there is the best chance\r\nof success; namely, the route across the sea lying to the west of\r\nSpitzbergen. That Hudson, in the clumsy galleons of Elizabeth’s time,\r\nshould have penetrated to within eight degrees and a half of the Pole,\r\nor to a distance only exceeding Nares’s nearest approach by about 130\r\nmiles, proves conclusively, we think, that with modern ships, and\r\nespecially with the aid of steam, this route might be followed with\r\nmuch better prospect of success than that which was adopted for Nares’s\r\nexpedition. If the reader will examine a map of the Arctic regions he\r\nwill find that the western shores of Spitzbergen and the north-eastern\r\nshores of Greenland, as far as they have been yet explored, are\r\nseparated by about 33 degrees of longitude, equivalent on the 80th\r\nparallel of latitude to about 335 miles. Across the whole breadth of\r\nthis sea Arctic voyagers have attempted to sail northwards beyond the\r\n80th parallel, but no one has yet succeeded in the attempt except on\r\nthe eastern side of that sea. It was here that Hudson—fortunately for\r\nhim—directed his attack; and he passed a hundred miles to the north\r\nof the 80th parallel, being impeded and finally stopped by the packed\r\nice around the north-western shores of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the fortunes of other attempts which have been made to\r\napproach the Pole in this direction.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Captain (afterwards Sir Edward) Parry, who had already four\r\ntimes passed beyond the Arctic Circle—viz., in 1818, 1819, 1821–23,\r\nand 1824–25—made an attempt to reach the North Pole by way of\r\nSpitzbergen. His plan was to follow Hudson’s route until stopped by\r\nice; then to leave his ship, and cross the ice-field with sledges\r\ndrawn by Esquimaux dogs, and, taking boats along with the party, to\r\ncross whatever open water they might find. In this way he succeeded\r\nin reaching latitude 82° 45´ north, the highest ever attained until\r\nNares’s expedition succeeded in crossing the 83rd parallel. Parry found\r\nthat the whole of the ice-field over which his party were laboriously\r\ntravelling northwards was being carried bodily southwards, and that at\r\nlength the distance they were able to travel in a day was equalled by\r\nthe southerly daily drift of the ice-field, so that they made no real\r\nprogress. He gave up further contest, and returned to his ship the\r\n_Hecla_.\r\n\r\nIt is important to inquire whether the southerly drift which stopped\r\nParry was due to northerly winds or to a southerly current; and if\r\nto the latter cause, whether this current probably affects the whole\r\nextent of the sea in which Parry’s ice-field was drifting. We know\r\nthat his party were exposed, during the greater part of their advance\r\nfrom Spitzbergen, to northerly winds. Now the real velocity of these\r\nwinds must have been greater than their apparent velocity, because the\r\nice-field was moving southwards. Had this not been the case, or had the\r\nice-field been suddenly stopped, the wind would have seemed stronger;\r\nprecisely as it seems stronger to passengers on board a sailing vessel\r\nwhen, after being before the wind for a time, she is brought across\r\nthe wind. The ice-field was clearly travelling before the wind, but\r\nnot nearly so fast as the wind; and therefore there is good reason\r\nfor believing that the motion of the ice-field was due to the wind\r\nalone. If we suppose this to have been really the case, then, as there\r\nis no reason for believing that northerly winds prevail uniformly in\r\nthe Arctic regions, we must regard Parry’s defeat as due to mischance.\r\nAnother explorer might have southerly instead of northerly winds, and\r\nso might be assisted instead of impeded in his advance towards the\r\nPole. Had this been Parry’s fortune, or even if the winds had proved\r\nneutral, he would have approached nearer to the Pole than Nares. For\r\nParry reckoned that he had lost more than a hundred miles by the\r\nsoutherly drift of the ice-field, by which amount at least he would\r\nhave advanced further north. But that was not all; for there can be\r\nlittle doubt that he would have continued his efforts longer but for\r\nthe Sisyphæan nature of the struggle. It is true he was nearer home\r\nwhen he turned back than he would have been but for the drift, and one\r\nof his reasons for turning back was the consideration of the distance\r\nwhich his men had to travel in returning. But he was chiefly influenced\r\n(so far as the return journey was concerned) by the danger caused by\r\nthe movable nature of the ice-field, which might at any time begin to\r\ntravel northwards, or eastwards, or westwards.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose that not the wind but Arctic currents carried the\r\nice-field southwards, we must yet admit the probability—nay, almost\r\nthe certainty—that such currents are only local, and occupy but a part\r\nof the breadth of the North Atlantic seas in those high latitudes. The\r\ngeneral drift of the North Atlantic surface-water is unquestionably\r\nnot towards the south but towards the north; and whatever part we\r\nsuppose the Arctic ice to perform in regulating the system of oceanic\r\ncirculation—whether, with Carpenter, we consider the descent of\r\nthe cooled water as the great moving cause of the entire system of\r\ncirculation, or assign to that motion a less important office (which\r\nseems to me the juster opinion)—we must in any case regard the Arctic\r\nseas as a region of surface indraught. The current flowing from those\r\nseas, which caused (on the hypothesis we are for the moment adopting)\r\nthe southwardly motion of Parry’s ice-field, must therefore be regarded\r\nas in all probability an exceptional phenomenon of those seas. By\r\nmaking the advance from a more eastwardly or more westwardly part of\r\nSpitzbergen, a northerly current would probably be met with; or rather,\r\nthe motion of the ice-field would indicate the presence of such a\r\ncurrent, for I question very much whether open water would anywhere be\r\nfound north of the 83rd parallel. In that case, a party might advance\r\nin one longitude and return in another, selecting for their return\r\nthe longitude in which (always according to our present hypothesis\r\nthat currents caused the drift) Parry found that a southerly current\r\nunderlay his route across the ice. On the whole, however, it appears to\r\nme more probable that winds, not currents, caused the southerly drift\r\nof Parry’s ice-field.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, a German expedition, under Captain Koldewey, made the first\r\nvisit to the seas west of Spitzbergen in a steamship, the small but\r\npowerful screw steamer _Germania_ (126 tons), advancing northwards\r\na little beyond the 81st parallel. But this voyage can scarcely be\r\nregarded as an attempt to approach the Pole on that course; for\r\nKoldewey’s instructions were, “to explore the eastern coast of\r\nGreenland northwards; and, if he found success in that direction\r\nimpossible, to make for the mysterious Island of Gilles on the east of\r\nSpitzbergen.”\r\n\r\nScoresby in 1806 had made thus far the most northerly voyage in a ship\r\non Hudson’s route, but in 1868 a Swedish expedition attained higher\r\nlatitudes than had ever or have ever been reached by a ship in that\r\ndirection. The steamship _Sofia_, strongly built of Swedish iron, and\r\noriginally intended for winter voyages in the Baltic, was selected for\r\nthe voyage. Owing to a number of unfortunate delays, it was not until\r\nSeptember, 1868, that the _Sofia_ reached the most northerly part of\r\nher journey, attaining a point nearly fifteen miles further north than\r\nHudson had reached. To the north broken ice was still found, but it was\r\nso closely packed that not even a boat could pass through. Two months\r\nearlier in the season the voyagers might have waited for a change of\r\nwind and the breaking up of the ice; but in the middle of September\r\nthis would have been very dangerous. The temperature was already\r\nsixteen degrees below the freezing-point, and there was every prospect\r\nthat in a few weeks, or even days, the seas over which they had reached\r\ntheir present position would be icebound. They turned back from that\r\nadvanced position; but, with courage worthy of the old Vikings, they\r\nmade another attack a fortnight later. They were foiled again, as was\r\nto be expected, for by this time the sun was already on the wintry side\r\nof the equator. They had, indeed, a narrow escape from destruction.\r\n“An ice-block with which they came into collision opened a large leak\r\nin the ship’s side, and when, after great exertions, they reached the\r\nland, the water already stood two feet over the cabin floor.”[21]\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the North Atlantic Channel—so to term the part\r\nlying between Greenland and Spitzbergen—the nearest approach towards\r\nthe Pole was made by the Dutch in 1670, nearly all the more recent\r\nattempts to reach high northern latitudes in this direction having\r\nhitherto ended in failure more or less complete.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Captain Koldewey was charged to explore the\r\neastern coast of Greenland in the _Germania_ in 1868. In 1869 the\r\n_Germania_ was again despatched under his command from Bremerhaven,\r\nin company with the _Hansa_, a sailing vessel. Lieutenant Payer and\r\nother Austrian _savants_ accompanied Captain Koldewey. The attack was\r\nagain made along the eastern shores of Greenland. As far as the 74th\r\ndegree the two vessels kept company; but at this stage it happened\r\nunfortunately that a signal from the _Germania_ was misinterpreted,\r\nand the _Hansa_ left her. Soon after, the _Hansa_ was crushed by masses\r\nof drifting ice, and her crew and passengers took refuge on an immense\r\nice-floe seven miles in circumference. Here they built a hut, which was\r\nin its turn crushed. Winds and currents carried their icy home about,\r\nand at length broke it up. Fortunately they had saved their boats, and\r\nwere able to reach Friedrichsthal, a missionary station in the south of\r\nGreenland, whence they were conveyed to Copenhagen in September, 1870.\r\nReturning to the _Germania_, we find that she had a less unfortunate\r\nexperience. She entered the labyrinth of sinuous fjords, separated\r\nby lofty promontories, and girt round by gigantic glaciers, which\r\ncharacterize the eastern coast of Greenland to the north of Scoresby\r\nSound. In August the channels by which she had entered were closed,\r\nand the _Germania_ was imprisoned. So soon as the ice would bear\r\nthem, Koldewey and his companions made sledging excursions to various\r\npoints around their ship. But in November the darkness of the polar\r\nwinter settled down upon them, and these excursions ceased. The polar\r\nwinter of 1869–70 was “characterized by a series of violent northerly\r\ntempests, one of which continued more than 100 hours, with a velocity\r\n(measured by the anemometer) of no less than sixty miles an hour”—a\r\nvelocity often surpassed, indeed, but which must have caused intense\r\nsuffering to all who left the shelter of the ship; for it is to be\r\nremembered that the air which thus swept along at the rate of a mile\r\na minute was the bitter air of the Arctic regions. The thermometer\r\ndid not, however, descend lower than 26° below zero, or 58° below the\r\nfreezing-point—a cold often surpassed in parts of the United States. I\r\nhave myself experienced a cold of more than 30° below zero, at Niagara.\r\n“With proper precautions as regards shelter and clothing,” proceeds\r\nthe narrative, “even extreme cold need not cause great suffering to\r\nthose who winter in such regions. One of the worst things to be endured\r\nis the physical and moral weariness of being cut off from external\r\nobservations during the long night of some ninety days, relieved only\r\nby the strange Northern Lights. The ice accumulates all round with\r\npressure, and assumes peculiar and fantastic forms, emitting ever and\r\nanon ominous noises. Fortunately, the _Germania_ lay well sheltered\r\nin a harbour opening southwards, and, being protected by a rampart of\r\nhills on the north, was able to resist the shock of the elements. The\r\nsun appearing once more about the beginning of February, the scientific\r\nwork of exploration began.... The pioneers of the _Germania_ advanced\r\nas far as the 77th degree of latitude, in longitude 18° 50´ west from\r\nGreenwich. There was no sign of an open sea towards the Pole. _Had it\r\nnot been for want of provisions, the party could have prolonged their\r\nsledge journey indefinitely._ The bank of ice, without remarkable\r\nprotuberances, extends to about two leagues from the shore, which\r\nfrom this extreme point seems to trend towards the north-west, where\r\nthe view was bounded by lofty mountains.” As the expedition was only\r\nequipped for one winter, it returned to Europe in September, 1870,\r\nwithout having crossed the 78th parallel of north latitude.\r\n\r\nCaptain Koldewey was convinced, by the results of his exploration,\r\nthat there is no continuous channel northwards along the eastern coast\r\nof Greenland. It does not seem to me that his expedition proved this\r\nbeyond all possibility of question. Still, it seems clear that the\r\neastern side of the North Atlantic is less suited than the western for\r\nthe attempt to reach the North Pole. The prevailing ocean-currents are\r\nsoutherly on that side, just as they are northerly on the western side.\r\nThe cold also is greater, the lines of equal temperature lying almost\r\nexactly in the direction of the channel itself—that is, nearly north\r\nand south—and the cold increasing athwart that direction, towards the\r\nwest. The nearer to Greenland the greater is the cold.[22]\r\n\r\nThe next route to be considered in order of time would be the American\r\nroute; but I prefer to leave this to the last, as the latest results\r\nrelate to that route. I take next, therefore, a route which some regard\r\nas the most promising of all—that, namely, which passes between\r\nSpitzbergen and the Scandinavian peninsula.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Lieutenant Payer, of the Austrian navy, had\r\naccompanied Captain Koldewey’s first expedition. When driven back from\r\nthe attempt to advance along the eastern shores of Greenland, that\r\ncommander crossed over to Spitzbergen, and tried to find the Land of\r\nGilles. He also accompanied Koldewey’s later expedition, and shared his\r\nbelief that there is no continuous channel northwards on the western\r\nside of the North Atlantic channel. Believing still, however, with\r\nDr. Petermann, the geographer, that there is an open Polar sea beyond\r\nthe ice-barrier, Payer set out in 1871, in company with Weyprecht,\r\ntowards the Land of Gilles. They did not find this mysterious land,\r\nbut succeeded in passing 150 miles further north, after rounding the\r\nsouth-eastern shores of Spitzbergen, than any Arctic voyagers who had\r\nbefore penetrated into the region lying between Spitzbergen and Novaia\r\nZemlia. Here they found, beyond the 76th parallel, and between 42° and\r\n60° east longitude, an open sea, and a temperature of between 5° and 7°\r\nabove the freezing-point. Unfortunately, they had not enough provisions\r\nwith them to be able safely to travel further north, and were thus\r\ncompelled to return. The season seems to have been an unusually open\r\none; and it is much to be regretted that the expedition was not better\r\nsupplied with provisions—a defect which appears to be not uncommon\r\nwith German expeditions.\r\n\r\nSoon after their return, Payer and Weyprecht began to prepare for a new\r\nexpedition; and this time their preparations were thorough, and adapted\r\nfor a long stay in Arctic regions. “The chief aim of this expedition,”\r\nsays the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, in an interesting account of recent\r\nPolar researches, “was to investigate the unknown regions of the Polar\r\nseas to the north of Siberia, and to try to reach Behring’s Straits\r\nby this route.” It was only if after two winters and three summers\r\nthey failed to double the extreme promontory of Asia, that they were\r\nto direct their course towards the Pole. The voyagers, numbering\r\ntwenty-four persons, left the Norwegian port of Tromsoë, in the steamer\r\n_Tegethoff_, on July 14, 1872. Count Wilczek followed shortly after\r\nin a yacht, which was to convey coals and provisions to an eastern\r\npoint of the Arctic Ocean, for the benefit of the _Tegethoff_. At\r\na point between Novaia Zemlia and the mouth of the Petschora, the\r\nyacht lost sight of the steamer, and nothing was heard of the latter\r\nfor twenty-five months. General anxiety was felt for the fate of the\r\nexpedition, and various efforts were made by Austria, England, and\r\nRussia to obtain news of it. In September, 1874, the voyagers suddenly\r\nturned up at another port, and soon after entered Vienna amid great\r\nenthusiasm. Their story was a strange one.\r\n\r\nIt appears that when the _Tegethoff_ was lost sight of (August 21,\r\n1872), she had been surrounded by vast masses of ice, which crushed\r\nher hull. For nearly half a year the deadly embrace of the ice\r\ncontinued; and when at length pressure ceased, the ship remained\r\nfixed in the ice, several miles from open water. During the whole\r\nsummer the voyagers tried to release their ship, but in vain. They had\r\nnot, however, remained motionless all this time. The yacht had lost\r\nsight of them at a spot between Novaia Zemlia and Malaia Zemlia (in\r\nNorth Russia) in about 71° north latitude, and they were imprisoned\r\nnot far north of this spot. But the ice-field was driven hither\r\nand thither by the winds, until they found themselves, on the last\r\nday of August, 1873, only 6´ or about seven miles south of the 80th\r\nparallel of latitude. Only fourteen miles from them, on the north,\r\nthey saw “a mass of mountainous land, with numerous glaciers.” They\r\ncould not reach it until the end of October, however, and then they\r\nhad to house themselves in preparation for the long winter night.\r\nThis land they called Francis Joseph Land. It lies north of Novaia\r\nZemlia, and on the Polar side of the 80th parallel of latitude. The\r\nwinter was stormy and bitterly cold, the thermometer descending on one\r\noccasion to 72° below zero—very nearly as low as during the greatest\r\ncold experienced by Nares’s party. In February, 1874, “the sun having\r\nreappeared, Lieutenant Payer began to prepare sledge excursions to\r\nascertain the configuration of the land.... In the second excursion\r\nthe voyagers entered Austria Sound, which bounds Francis Joseph Island\r\non the east and north, and found themselves, after emerging from it,\r\nin the midst of a large basin, surrounded by several large islands.\r\nThe extreme northern point reached by the expedition was a cape on one\r\nof these islands, which they named Prince Rodolph’s Land, calling the\r\npoint Cape Fligely. It lies a little beyond the 81st parallel. They\r\nsaw land further north beyond the 83rd degree of latitude, and named\r\nit Petermann’s Land. The archipelago thus discovered is comparable\r\nin extent to that of which Spitzbergen is the chief island.” The\r\nvoyagers were compelled now to return, as the firm ice did not extend\r\nfurther north. They had a long, difficult, and dangerous journey\r\nsouthwards—sometimes on open water, in small boats, sometimes on\r\nice, with sledges—impeded part of the time by contrary winds, and\r\nwith starvation staring them in the face during the last fortnight of\r\ntheir journey. Fortunately, they reached Novaia Zemlia before their\r\nprovisions quite failed them, and were thence conveyed to Wardhoë by a\r\nRussian trading ship.\r\n\r\nWe have now only to consider the attempts which have been made to\r\napproach the North Pole by the American route. For, though Collinson\r\nin 1850 reached high latitudes to the north of Behring’s Straits, while\r\nWrangel and other Russian voyagers have attempted to travel northwards\r\nacross the ice which bounds the northern shores of Siberia, it can\r\nhardly be said that either route has been followed with the definite\r\npurpose of reaching the North Pole. I shall presently, however, have\r\noccasion to consider the probable value of the Behring’s Straits route,\r\nwhich about twelve years ago was advocated by the Frenchman Lambert.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane’s expedition in 1853–55 was one of those sent out in search\r\nof Sir John Franklin. It was fitted out at the expense of the United\r\nStates Government, and the route selected was that along Smith’s Sound,\r\nthe northerly prolongation of Baffin’s Bay. Kane wintered in 1853 and\r\n1854 in Van Reusselaer’s Inlet, on the western coast of Greenland, in\r\nlatitude 78° 43´ north. Leaving his ship, the _Advance_, he made a\r\nboat-journey to Upernavik, 6° further south. He next traced Kennedy\r\nChannel, the northerly prolongation of Smith’s Sound, reaching latitude\r\n81° 22´ north. He named heights visible yet further to the north,\r\nParry Mountains; and at the time—that is, twenty-two years ago—the\r\nland so named was the highest northerly land yet seen. Hayes, who had\r\naccompanied Kane in this voyage, succeeded in reaching a still higher\r\nlatitude in sledges drawn by Esquimaux dogs. Both Kane and Hayes agreed\r\nin announcing that where the shores of Greenland trend off eastwards\r\nfrom Kennedy Channel, there is an open sea, “rolling,” as Captain Maury\r\nmagniloquently says, “with the swell of a boundless ocean.” It was in\r\nparticular noticed that the tides ebbed and flowed in this sea. On this\r\ncircumstance Captain Maury based his conclusion that there is an open\r\nsea to the north of Greenland. After showing that the tidal wave could\r\nnot well have travelled along the narrow and icebound straits between\r\nBaffin’s Bay and the region reached by Kane and Hayes, Maury says:\r\n“Those tides must have been born in that cold sea, having their cradle\r\nabout the North Pole.” The context shows, however, that he really\r\nintended to signify that the waves were formed in seas around the North\r\nPole, and thence reached the place where they were seen; so that, as\r\nbirth usually precedes cradling, Maury would more correctly have said\r\nthat these tides are cradled in that cold sea, having their birth about\r\nthe North Pole.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Kane and Hayes afford no reason, however, for\r\nsupposing that there is open water around the North Pole. They have\r\nbeen rendered somewhat doubtful, be it remarked in passing, by the\r\nresults of Captain Nares’s expedition; and it has been proved beyond\r\nall question that there is not an open sea directly communicating with\r\nthe place where Kane and Hayes observed tidal changes. But, apart\r\nfrom direct evidence of this kind, two serious errors affect Maury’s\r\nreasoning, as I pointed out eleven years since. In the first place,\r\na tidal wave would be propagated quite freely along an ice-covered\r\nsea, no matter how thick the ice might be, so long as the sea was not\r\nabsolutely icebound. Even if the latter condition could exist for a\r\ntime, the tidal wave would burst the icy fetters that bound the sea,\r\nunless the sea were frozen to the very bottom; which, of course, can\r\nnever happen with any sea properly so called. It must be remembered\r\nthat, even in the coldest winter of the coldest Polar regions, ice\r\nof only a moderate thickness can form in open sea in a single day;\r\nbut the tidal wave does not allow ice to form for a single hour in\r\nsuch sort as to bind the great ice-fields and the shore-ice into one\r\nmighty mass. At low tide, for a very short time, ice may form in the\r\nspaces between the shore-ice and the floating ice, and again between\r\nthe various masses of floating ice, small or large (up to many square\r\nmiles in extent); but as the tidal wave returns it breaks through these\r\nbonds as easily as the Jewish Hercules burst the withes with which the\r\nPhilistines had bound his mighty limbs. It is probable that if solid\r\nice as thick as the thickest which Nares’s party found floating in the\r\nPalæocrystic Sea—ice 200 feet thick—reached from shore to shore of\r\nthe North Atlantic channel, the tidal wave would burst the barrier as\r\neasily as a rivulet rising but a few inches bursts the thin coating\r\nwhich has formed over it on the first cold night of autumn. But no such\r\nmassive barriers have to be broken through, for the tidal wave never\r\ngives the ice an hour’s rest Maury reasons that “the tidal wave from\r\nthe Atlantic can no more pass under the icy barrier to be propagated\r\nin the seas beyond, than the vibrations of a musical string can pass\r\nwith its notes a fret on which the musician has placed his finger.” But\r\nthe circumstances are totally different. The ice shares the motion of\r\nthe tidal wave, which has not to pass under the ice, but to lift it.\r\nThis, of course, it does quite as readily as though there were no ice,\r\nbut only the same weight of water. The mere weight of the ice counts\r\nsimply for nothing. The tidal wave would rise as easily in the British\r\nChannel if a million Great Easterns were floating there as if there was\r\nnot even a cock-boat; and the weight of ice, no matter how thick or\r\nextensive, would be similarly ineffective to restrain the great wave\r\nwhich the sun and moon send coursing twice a day athwart our oceans.\r\nMaury’s other mistake was even more important so far as this question\r\nof an open sea is concerned. “No one,” as I wrote in 1867, “who is\r\nfamiliar with the astronomical doctrine of the tides, can believe for\r\na moment that tides could be generated in a land-locked ocean, so\r\nlimited in extent as the North Polar sea (assuming its existence) must\r\nnecessarily be.” To raise a tidal wave the sun and moon require not\r\nmerely an ocean of wide extent to act upon, but an ocean so placed that\r\nthere is a great diversity in their pull on various parts of it; for it\r\nis the difference between the pull exerted on various parts, and not\r\nthe pull itself, which creates the tidal wave. Now the Polar sea has\r\nnot the required extent, and is not in the proper position, for this\r\ndiversity of pull to exist in sufficient degree to produce a tidal wave\r\nwhich could be recognized. It is certain, in fact, that, whether there\r\nis open water or not near the Pole, the tides observed by Kane and\r\nHayes must have come from the Atlantic, and most probably by the North\r\nAtlantic channel.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hall’s expedition in the _Polaris_ (really under the command\r\nof Buddington), in 1871–72, will be probably in the recollection of\r\nmost of my readers. Leaving Newfoundland on June 29, 1871, it sailed up\r\nSmith’s Sound, and by the end of August had reached the 80th parallel.\r\nThence it proceeded up Kennedy Channel, and penetrated into Robeson\r\nChannel, the northerly prolongation of Kennedy Channel, and only 13\r\nmiles wide. Captain Hall followed this passage as far as 82° 16´ north\r\nlatitude, reaching his extreme northerly point on September 3. From it\r\nhe saw “a vast expanse of open sea, which he called Lincoln Sea, and\r\nbeyond that another ocean or gulf; while on the west there appeared,\r\nas far as the eye could reach, the contours of coast. This region he\r\ncalled Grant Land.” So far as appears, there was no reason at that time\r\nwhy the expedition should not have gone still further north, the season\r\napparently having been exceptionally open. But the naval commander of\r\nthe expedition, Captain Buddington, does not seem to have had his heart\r\nin the work, and, to the disappointment of Hall, the _Polaris_ returned\r\nto winter in Robeson Channel, a little beyond the 81st degree. In the\r\nsame month, September, 1871, Captain Hall died, under circumstances\r\nwhich suggested to many of the crew and officers the suspicion that\r\nhe had been poisoned.[23] In the spring of 1870 the _Polaris_ resumed\r\nher course homewards. They were greatly impeded by the ice. A party\r\nwhich got separated from those on board were unfortunately unable to\r\nregain the ship, and remained on an ice-field for 240 days, suffering\r\nfearfully. The ice-field, like that on which the crew of the _Hansa_\r\nhad to take up their abode, drifted southwards, and was gradually\r\ndiminishing, when fortunately a passing steamer observed the prisoners\r\n(April 30, 1872) and rescued them. The _Polaris_ herself was so injured\r\nby the ice that her crew had to leave her, wintering on Lyttelton\r\nIsland. They left this spot in the early summer of 1872, in two boats,\r\nand were eventually picked up by a Scotch whaler.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nares’s expedition followed Hall’s route. I do not propose to\r\nenter here into any of the details of the voyage, with which my readers\r\nare no doubt familiar. The general history of the expedition must be\r\nsketched, however, in order to bring it duly into its place here. The\r\n_Alert_ and _Discovery_ sailed under Captains Nares and Stephenson, in\r\nMay, 1875. Their struggle with the ice did not fairly commence until\r\nthey were nearing the 79th parallel, where Baffin’s Bay merges into\r\nSmith’s Sound. Thence, through Smith’s Sound, Kennedy Channel, and\r\nRobeson Channel, they had a constant and sometimes almost desperate\r\nstruggle with the ice, until they had reached the north end of Robeson\r\nChannel. Here the _Discovery_ took up her winter quarters, in north\r\nlatitude 81° 44´, a few miles north of Captain Hall’s wintering-place,\r\nbut on the opposite (or westerly) side of Robeson Channel. The _Alert_\r\nstill struggled northwards, rounding the north-east point of Grant\r\nLand, and there finding, not, as was expected, a continuous coast-line\r\non the west, but a vast icebound sea. No harbour could be found, and\r\nthe ship was secured on the inside of a barrier of grounded ice, in\r\nlatitude 82° 31´, in the most northerly wintering-place ever yet\r\noccupied by man. The ice met with on this sea is described as “of most\r\nunusual age and thickness, resembling in a marked degree, both in\r\nappearance and formation, low floating icebergs rather than ordinary\r\nsalt-water ice. Whereas ordinary ice is from 2 feet to 10 feet in\r\nthickness, that in this Polar sea has gradually increased in age and\r\nthickness until it measures from 80 feet to 120 feet, floating with\r\nits surface at the lower part 15 feet above the water-line. In some\r\nplaces the ice reaches a thickness of from 150 to 200 feet, and the\r\ngeneral impression among the officers of the expedition seems to have\r\nbeen that the ice of this Palæocrystic Sea is the accumulation of many\r\nyears, if not of centuries; “that the sea is never free of it and never\r\nopen; and that progress to the Pole through it or over it is impossible\r\nwith our present resources.”\r\n\r\nThe winter which followed was the bitterest ever known by man. For\r\n142 days the sun was not seen; the mercury was frozen during nearly\r\nnine weeks. On one occasion the thermometer showed 104° below the\r\nfreezing-point, and during one terrible fortnight the mean temperature\r\nwas 91° below freezing!\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sun reappeared sledge-exploration began, each ship being\r\nleft with only half-a-dozen men and officers on board. Expeditions were\r\nsent east and west, one to explore the northern coast of Greenland, the\r\nother to explore the coast of Grant Land. Captain Stephenson crossed\r\nover from the _Discovery’s_ wintering-place to Polaris Bay, and there\r\nplaced over Hall’s grave a tablet, prepared in England, bearing the\r\nfollowing inscription: “Sacred to the memory of Captain C. F. Hall, of\r\nU.S. _Polaris_, who sacrificed his life in the advancement of science,\r\non November 8, 1871. This tablet has been erected by the British Polar\r\nExpedition of 1875, who, following in his footsteps, have profited by\r\nhis experience”—a graceful acknowledgment (which might, however, have\r\nbeen better expressed). The party which travelled westwards traced\r\nthe shores of Grant Land as far as west longitude 86° 30´, the most\r\nnortherly cape being in latitude 83° 7´, and longitude 70° 30´ west.\r\nThis cape they named Cape Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Greenland was explored as far east as longitude 50° 40´\r\n(west), land being seen as far as 82° 54´ north, longitude 48° 33´\r\nwest. Lastly, a party under Commander Markham and Lieutenant Parr\r\npushed northwards. They were absent ten weeks, but had not travelled\r\nso far north in the time as was expected, having encountered great\r\ndifficulties. On May 12, 1876, they reached their most northerly point,\r\nplanting the British flag in latitude 83° 20´ 26´´ north. “Owing to\r\nthe extraordinary nature of the pressed-up ice, a roadway had to be\r\nformed by pickaxes for nearly half the distance travelled, before any\r\nadvance could be safely made, even with light loads; this rendered it\r\nalways necessary to drag the sledge-loads forward by instalments, and\r\ntherefore to journey over the same road several times. The advance was\r\nconsequently very slow, and only averaged about a mile and a quarter\r\ndaily—much the same rate as was attained by Sir Edward Parry during\r\nthe summer of 1827. The greatest journey made in any one day amounted\r\nonly to two miles and three quarters. Although the distance made good\r\nwas only 73 miles from the ship, 276 miles were travelled over to\r\naccomplish it.” It is justly remarked, in the narrative from which I\r\nhave made this extract, that no body of men could have surpassed in\r\npraiseworthy perseverance this gallant party, whose arduous struggle\r\nover the roughest and most monotonous road imaginable, may fairly be\r\nregarded as surpassing all former exploits of the kind. (The narrator\r\nsays that it has “eclipsed” all former ones, which can scarcely be\r\nintended to be taken _au pied de la lettre_.) The expedition reached\r\nthe highest latitude ever yet attained under any conditions, carried\r\na ship to higher latitudes than any ship had before reached, and\r\nwintered in higher latitudes than had ever before been dwelt in during\r\nthe darkness of a Polar winter. They explored the most northerly\r\ncoast-line yet traversed, and this both on the east and west of their\r\nroute northwards. They have ascertained the limits of human habitation\r\nupon this earth, and have even passed beyond the regions which animals\r\noccupy, though nearly to the most northerly limit of the voyage they\r\nfound signs of the occasional visits of warm-blooded animals. Last, but\r\nnot least, they have demonstrated, as it appears to me (though possibly\r\nAmericans will adopt a different opinion), that by whatever route the\r\nPole is to be reached, it is not by that which I have here called\r\nthe American route, at least with the present means of transit over\r\nicebound seas. The country may well be satisfied with such results\r\n(apart altogether from the scientific observations, which are the\r\nbest fruits of the expedition), even though the Pole has not yet been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nMust we conclude, however, that the North Pole is really inaccessible?\r\nIt appears to me that the annals of Arctic research justify no such\r\nconclusion. The attempt which has just been made, although supposed at\r\nthe outset to have been directed along the most promising of all the\r\nroutes heretofore tried, turned out to be one of the most difficult\r\nand dangerous. Had there been land extending northwards (as Sherard\r\nOsborn and others opined), on the western side of the sea into which\r\nRobeson Channel opens, a successful advance might have been made along\r\nits shore by sledging. M’Clintock, in 1853, travelled 1220 miles in 105\r\ndays; Richards 1012 miles in 102 days; Mecham 1203 miles; Richards and\r\nOsborn 1093 miles; Hamilton 1150 miles with a dog-sledge and one man.\r\nIn 1854 Mecham travelled 1157 miles in only 70 days; Young travelled\r\n1150 miles and M’Clintock 1330 miles. But these journeys were made\r\neither over land or over unmoving ice close to a shore-line. Over an\r\nicebound sea journeys of the kind are quite impracticable. But the\r\nconditions, while not more favourable in respect of the existence of\r\nland, were in other respects altogether less favourable along the\r\nAmerican route than along any of the others I have considered in this\r\nbrief sketch of the attempts hitherto made to reach the Pole.\r\n\r\nThe recent expedition wintered as near as possible to the region of\r\nmaximum winter cold in the western hemisphere, and pushed their journey\r\nnorthwards athwart the region of maximum summer cold. Along the course\r\npursued by Parry’s route the cold is far less intense, in corresponding\r\nlatitudes, than along the American route; and cold is the real enemy\r\nwhich bars the way towards the Pole. All the difficulties and dangers\r\nof the journey either have their origin (as directly as the ice itself)\r\nin the bitter Arctic cold, or are rendered effective and intensified\r\nby the cold. The course to be pursued, therefore, is that indicated\r\nby the temperature. Where the July isotherms, or lines of equal summer\r\nheat, run northwards, a weak place is indicated in the Arctic barrier;\r\nwhere they trend southwards, that barrier is strongest. Now there are\r\ntwo longitudes in which the July Arctic isotherms run far northward\r\nof their average latitude. One passes through the Parry Islands, and\r\nindicates the sea north-east of Behring’s Straits as a suitable region\r\nfor attack; the other passes through Spitzbergen, and indicates the\r\ncourse along which Sir E. Parry’s attack was made. The latter is\r\nslightly the more promising line of the two, so far as temperature is\r\nconcerned, the isotherm of 36° Fahrenheit (in July) running here as\r\nfar north as the 77th parallel, whereas its highest northerly range in\r\nthe longitude of the Parry Islands is but about 76°. The difference,\r\nhowever, is neither great nor altogether certain; and the fact that\r\nParry found the ice drifting southwards, suggests the possibility that\r\nthat _may_ be the usual course of oceanic currents in that region.\r\nNorth of the Parry Islands the drift may be northwardly, like that\r\nwhich Payer and Weyprecht experienced to the north of Novaia Zemlia.\r\n\r\nThere is one great attraction for men of science in the route by the\r\nParry Islands. The magnetic pole has almost certainly travelled into\r\nthat region. Sir J. Ross found it, indeed, to be near Boothia Gulf,\r\nfar to the east of the Parry Islands, in 1837. But the variations of\r\nthe needle all over the world since then, indicate unmistakably that\r\nthe magnetic poles have been travelling round towards the west, and at\r\nsuch a rate that the northern magnetic pole has probably nearly reached\r\nby this time the longitude of Behring’s Straits. The determination of\r\nthe exact present position of the Pole would be a much more important\r\nachievement, so far as science is concerned, than a voyage to the pole\r\nof rotation.\r\n\r\nThere is one point which suggests itself very forcibly in reading the\r\naccount of the sledging expedition from the _Alert_ towards the north.\r\nIn his official report, Captain Nares says that “half of each day was\r\nspent in dragging the sledges in that painful fashion—face toward the\r\nboat—in which the sailors drag a boat from the sea on to the sand;”\r\nand again he speaks of the “toilsome dragging of the sledges over\r\nice-ridges which resembled a stormy sea suddenly frozen.” In doing\r\nthis “276 miles were toiled over in travelling only 73 miles.” Is it\r\naltogether clear that the sledges were worth the trouble? One usually\r\nregards a sledge as intended to carry travellers and their provisions,\r\netc., over ice and snow, and as useful when so employed; but when the\r\ntravellers have to take along the sledge, going four times as far and\r\nworking ten times as hard as if they were without it, the question\r\nsuggests itself whether all necessary shelter, provisions, and utensils\r\nmight not have been much more readily conveyed by using a much smaller\r\nand lighter sledge, and by distributing a large part of the luggage\r\namong the members of the expedition. The parts of a small hut could,\r\nwith a little ingenuity, be so constructed as to admit of being used as\r\nlevers, crowbars, carrying-poles, and so forth, and a large portion of\r\nthe luggage absolutely necessary for the expedition could be carried by\r\ntheir help; while a small, light sledge for the rest could be helped\r\nalong and occasionally lifted bodily over obstructions by levers and\r\nbeams forming part of the very material which by the usual arrangement\r\nforms part of the load. I am not suggesting, be it noticed, that by any\r\ndevices of this sort a journey over the rough ice of Arctic regions\r\ncould be made easy. But it does seem to me that if a party could go\r\nback and forth over 276 miles, pickaxing a way for a sledge, and\r\neventually dragging it along over the path thus pioneered for it, and\r\nmaking only an average of 1¼ mile of real progress per day, or 73 miles\r\nin all, the same men could with less labour (though still, doubtless,\r\nwith great toil and trouble) make six or seven miles a day by reducing\r\ntheir _impedimenta_ to what could be carried directly along with them.\r\nWhether use might not be made of the lifting power of buoyant gas, is\r\na question which only experienced aëronauts and Arctic voyagers could\r\nanswer. I believe that the employment of imprisoned balloon-power for\r\nmany purposes, especially in time of war, has received as yet much less\r\nattention than it deserves. Of course I am aware that in Arctic regions\r\nmany difficulties would present themselves; and the idea of ordinary\r\nballooning over the Arctic ice-fields may be regarded as altogether\r\nwild in the present condition of the science of aëronautics. But the\r\nuse of balloon-power as an auxiliary, however impracticable at present,\r\nis by no means to be despaired of as science advances.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the advance upon the Pole itself, however\r\ninteresting to the general public, is far less important to science\r\nthan other objects which Arctic travellers have had in view. The\r\ninquiry into the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism within the Arctic\r\nregions; the investigation of oceanic movements there; of the laws\r\naccording to which low temperatures are related to latitude and\r\ngeographical conditions; the study of aerial phenomena; of the limits\r\nof plant life and animal life; the examination of the mysterious\r\nphenomena of the Aurora Borealis—these and many other interesting\r\nsubjects of investigation have been as yet but incompletely dealt with.\r\nIn the Polar regions, as Maury well remarked, “the icebergs are framed\r\nand glaciers launched; there the tides have their cradle, the whales\r\ntheir nursery; there the winds complete their circuit, and the currents\r\nof the sea their round, in the wonderful system of oceanic circulation;\r\nthere the Aurora is lighted up, and the trembling needle brought to\r\nrest; and there, too, in the mazes of that mystic circle, terrestrial\r\nforces of occult power and of vast influence upon the well-being of man\r\nare continually at work. It is a circle of mysteries; and the desire to\r\nenter it, to explore its untrodden wastes and secret chambers, and to\r\nstudy its physical aspects, has grown into a longing. Noble daring has\r\nmade Arctic ice and snow-clad seas classic ground.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A MIGHTY SEA-WAVE._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 10th, 1876, a tremendous wave swept the Pacific Ocean from Peru\r\nnorthwards, westwards, and southwards, travelling at a rate many times\r\ngreater than that of the swiftest express train. For reasons best known\r\nto themselves, writers in the newspapers have by almost common consent\r\ncalled this phenomenon a tidal-wave. But the tides had nothing to do\r\nwith it. Unquestionably the wave resulted from the upheaval of the bed\r\nof the ocean in some part of that angle of the Pacific Ocean which is\r\nbounded by the shores of Peru and Chili. This region has long been\r\ncelebrated for tremendous submarine and subterranean upheavals. The\r\nopinions of geologists and geographers have been divided as to the real\r\norigin of the disturbances by which at one time the land, at another\r\ntime the sea, and at yet other times (oftener, in fact, than either\r\nof the others) both land and sea have been shaken as by some mighty\r\nimprisoned giant, struggling, like Prometheus, to cast from his limbs\r\nthe mountain masses which hold them down. Some consider that the seat\r\nof the Vulcanian forces lies deep below that part of the chain of the\r\nAndes which lies at the apex of the angle just mentioned, and that the\r\ndirection of their action varies according to the varying conditions\r\nunder which the imprisoned gases find vent. Others consider that there\r\nare two if not several seats of subterranean activity. Yet others\r\nsuppose that the real seat of disturbance lies beneath the ocean\r\nitself, a view which seems to find support in several phenomena of\r\nrecent Peruvian earthquakes.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have not full information concerning the great wave which\r\nin May, 1876, swept across the Pacific, and northwards and southwards\r\nalong the shores of the two Americas, it may be interesting to consider\r\nsome of the more striking features of this great disturbance of the\r\nso-called peaceful ocean, and to compare them with those which have\r\ncharacterized former disturbances of a similar kind. We may thus,\r\nperhaps, find some evidence by which an opinion may be formed as to the\r\nreal seat of subterranean activity in this region.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it may be necessary to explain why I have asserted\r\nsomewhat confidently that the tides have nothing whatever to do with\r\nthis great oceanic wave. It is of course well known to every reader\r\nthat the highest or spring tides occur always two or three days after\r\nnew moon and after full moon, the lowest (or rather the tides having\r\nleast range above and below the mean level) occurring two or three days\r\nafter the first and third quarters of the lunar month. The sun and moon\r\ncombine, indeed, to sway the ocean most strongly at full and new, while\r\nthey pull contrariwise at the first and third quarters; but the full\r\neffect of their combined effort is only felt a few days later than when\r\nit is made, while the full effect of their opposition to each other,\r\nin diminishing the range of the oceanic oscillation, is also only felt\r\nafter two or three days. Thus in May, 1876, the tidal wave had its\r\ngreatest range on or about May 16, new moon occurring at half-past five\r\non the morning of May 13; and the tidal wave had its least range on or\r\nabout May 8, the moon passing her third quarter a little after eleven\r\non the morning of May 4. Accordingly the disturbance which affected the\r\nwaters of the Pacific so mightily on May 10, occurred two days after\r\nthe lowest or neap tides, and five days before the highest or spring\r\ntides. Manifestly that was not a time when a tidal wave of exceptional\r\nheight could be expected, or, indeed, could possibly occur. Such a\r\nwave as actually disturbed the Pacific on that day could not in any\r\ncase have been produced by tidal action, even though the winds had\r\nassisted to their utmost, and all the circumstances which help to make\r\nhigh tides had combined—as the greatest proximity of moon to earth,\r\nthe conjunction of moon and sun near the celestial equator, and (of\r\ncourse) the exact coincidence of the time of the tidal disturbance\r\nwith that when the combined pull of the sun and moon is strongest. As,\r\ninstead, the sun was nearly eighteen degrees from the equator, the moon\r\nmore than nine, and as the moon was a full week’s motion from the part\r\nof her path where she is nearest to the earth, while, as we have seen,\r\nonly two days had passed from the time of absolutely lowest tides, it\r\nwill be seen how utterly unable the tidal-wave must have been on the\r\nday of the great disturbance to produce the effects presently to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange, in dealing with the case of a wave which\r\napparently had its origin in or near Peru on May 9, to consider the\r\nbehaviour of a volcano, distant 5000 miles from this region, a week\r\nbefore the disturbance took place. But although the coincidence may\r\npossibly have been accidental, yet in endeavouring to ascertain\r\nthe true seat of disturbance we must overlook no evidence, however\r\nseemingly remote, which may throw light on that point; and as the\r\nsea-wave generated by the disturbance reached very quickly the distant\r\nregion referred to, it is by no means unlikely that the subterranean\r\nexcitement which the disturbance relieved may have manifested its\r\neffects beforehand at the same remote volcanic region. Be this as\r\nit may, it is certain that on May 1 the great crater of Kilauea, in\r\nthe island of Hawaii, became active, and on the 4th severe shocks of\r\nearthquake were felt at the Volcano House. At three in the afternoon a\r\njet of lava was thrown up to a height of about 100 feet, and afterwards\r\nsome fifty jets came into action. Subsequently jets of steam issued\r\nalong the line formed by a fissure four miles in length down the\r\nmountain-side. The disturbance lessened considerably on the 5th, and an\r\nobserving party examined the crater. They found that a rounded hill,\r\n700 feet in height, and 1400 feet in diameter, had been thrown up on\r\nthe plain which forms the floor of the crater. Fire and scoria spouted\r\nup in various places.\r\n\r\nBefore rejecting utterly the belief that the activity thus exhibited in\r\nthe Hawaii volcano had its origin in the same subterrene or submarine\r\nregion as the Peruvian earthquake, we should remember that other\r\nregions scarcely less remote have been regarded as forming part of the\r\nsame Vulcanian district. The violent earthquakes which occurred at\r\nNew Madrid, in Missouri, in 1812, took place at the same time as the\r\nearthquake of Caraccas, the West Indian volcanoes being simultaneously\r\nactive; and earthquakes had been felt in South Carolina for several\r\nmonths before the destruction of Caraccas and La Guayra. Now we have\r\nabundant evidence to show that the West Indian volcanoes are connected\r\nwith the Peruvian and Chilian regions of Vulcanian energy, and the\r\nChilian region is about as far from New Madrid as Arica in Peru from\r\nthe Sandwich Isles.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until about half-past eight on the evening of May\r\n9 that the Peruvian earthquake began. A severe shock, lasting from\r\nfour to five minutes, was felt along the entire southern coast, even\r\nreaching Antofagasta. The shock was so severe that it was impossible,\r\nin many places, to stand upright. It was succeeded by several others of\r\nless intensity.\r\n\r\nWhile the land was thus disturbed, the sea was observed to be gradually\r\nreceding, a movement which former experiences have taught the Peruvians\r\nto regard with even more terror than the disturbance of the earth\r\nitself. The waters which had thus withdrawn, as if concentrating their\r\nenergies to leap more fiercely on their prey, presently returned in\r\na mighty wave, which swept past Callao, travelling southwards with\r\nfearful velocity, while in its train followed wave after wave, until\r\nno less than eight had taken their part in the work of destruction.\r\nAt Mollendo the railway was torn up by the sea for a distance of 300\r\nfeet. A violent hurricane which set in afterwards from the south\r\nprevented all vessels from approaching, and unroofed most of the houses\r\nin the town. At Arica the people were busily engaged in preparing\r\ntemporary fortifications to repel a threatened assault of the rebel ram\r\n_Huiscar_, at the moment when the roar of the earthquake was heard.\r\nThe shocks here were very numerous, and caused immense damage in the\r\ntown, the people flying to the Morro for safety. The sea was suddenly\r\nperceived to recede from the beach, and a wave from ten feet to fifteen\r\nfeet in height rolled in upon the shore, carrying before it all that it\r\nmet. Eight times was this assault of the ocean repeated. The earthquake\r\nhad levelled to the ground a portion of the custom-house, the railway\r\nstation, the submarine cable office, the hotel, the British Consulate,\r\nthe steamship agency, and many private dwellings. Owing to the early\r\nhour of the evening, and the excitement attendant on the proposed\r\nattack of the _Huiscar_, every one was out and stirring; but the only\r\nloss of life which was reported was that of three little children who\r\nwere overtaken by the water. The progress of the wave was only stopped\r\nat the foot of the hill on which the church stands, which point is\r\nfurther inland than that reached in August, 1868. Four miles of the\r\nembankment of the railway were swept away like sand before the wind.\r\nLocomotives, cars, and rails, were hurled about by the sea like so many\r\nplaythings, and left in a tumbled mass of rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe account proceeds to say that the United States steamer _Waters_,\r\nstranded by the bore of 1868, was lifted up bodily by the wave at\r\nArica, and floated two miles north of her former position. The\r\nreference is no doubt to the double-ender _Watertree_, not stranded by\r\na bore (a term utterly inapplicable to any kind of sea-wave at Arica,\r\nwhere there is no large river), but carried in by the great wave which\r\nfollowed the earthquake of August 13. The description of the wave at\r\nArica on that occasion should be compared with that of the wave of\r\nMay, 1876. About twenty minutes after the first earth shock, the sea\r\nwas seen to retire, as if about to leave the shores wholly dry; but\r\npresently its waters returned with tremendous force. A mighty wave,\r\nwhose length seemed immeasurable, was seen advancing like a dark wall\r\nupon the unfortunate town, a large part of which was overwhelmed by\r\nit. Two ships, the Peruvian corvette _America_, and the American\r\ndouble-ender _Watertree_, were carried nearly half a mile to the north\r\nof Arica, beyond the railroad which runs to Tacna, and there left\r\nstranded high and dry. As the English vice-consul at Arica estimated\r\nthe height of this enormous wave at fully fifty feet, it would not seem\r\nthat the account of the wave of May, 1876, has been exaggerated, for a\r\nmuch less height is, as we have seen, attributed to it, though, as it\r\ncarried the _Watertree_ still further inland, it must have been higher.\r\nThe small loss of life can be easily understood when we consider that\r\nthe earthquake was not followed instantly by the sea-wave. Warned by\r\nthe experience of the earthquake of 1868, which most of them must have\r\nremembered, the inhabitants sought safety on the higher grounds until\r\nthe great wave and its successors had flowed in. We read that the\r\ndamage done was greater than that caused by the previous calamity, the\r\nnew buildings erected since 1868 being of a more costly and substantial\r\nclass. Merchandise from the custom-house and stores was carried by the\r\nwater to a point on the beach five miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt Iquique, in 1868, the great wave was estimated at fifty feet in\r\nheight. We are told that it was black with the mud and slime of the sea\r\nbottom. “Those who witnessed its progress from the upper balconies of\r\ntheir houses, and presently saw its black mass rushing close beneath\r\ntheir feet, looked on their safety as a miracle. Many buildings were,\r\nindeed, washed away, and in the low-lying parts of the town there was a\r\nterrible loss of life.” In May, 1876, the greatest mischief at Iquique\r\nwould seem to have been caused by the earthquake, not by the sea-wave,\r\nthough this also was destructive in its own way. “Iquique,” we are\r\ntold, “is in ruins. The movement was experienced there at the same time\r\nand with the same force [as at Arica]. Its duration was exactly four\r\nminutes and a third. It proceeded from the south-east, exactly from the\r\ndirection of Ilaga.” The houses built of wood and cane tumbled down at\r\nthe first attacks, lamps were broken, and the burning oil spread over\r\nand set fire to the ruins. Three companies of firemen, German, Italian,\r\nand Peruvian, were instantly at their posts, although it was difficult\r\nto maintain an upright position, shock following shock with dreadful\r\nrapidity. Nearly 400,000 quintals of nitrate in the stores at Iquique\r\nand the adjacent ports of Molle and Pisagua were destroyed. The British\r\nbarque _Caprera_ and a German barque sank, and all the coasting craft\r\nand small boats in the harbour were broken to pieces and drifted about\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nAt Chanavaya, a small town at the guano-loading dépôt known as Pabellon\r\nde Pica, only two houses were left standing out of four hundred. Here\r\nthe earthquake shock was specially severe. In some places the earth\r\nopened in crevices seventeen yards deep and the whole surface of the\r\nground was changed.\r\n\r\nAt Punta de Eobos two vessels were lost, and fourteen ships more\r\nor less damaged, by the wave. Antofagasta, Mexillones, Tocopilla,\r\nand Cobigo, on the Bolivian coast, suffered simultaneously from the\r\nearthquake and the sea-wave. The sea completely swept the business\r\nportion of Antofagasta during four hours. Here a singular phenomenon\r\nwas noticed. For some time the atmosphere was illuminated with a ruddy\r\nglow. It was supposed that this light came from the volcano of San\r\nPedro de Atacama, a few leagues inland from Antofagasta. A somewhat\r\nsimilar phenomenon was noticed at Tacna during the earthquake of\r\nAugust, 1868. About three hours after the earthquake an intensely\r\nbrilliant light made its appearance above the neighbouring mountains.\r\nIt lasted fully half an hour, and was ascribed to the eruption of some\r\nas yet unknown volcano.\r\n\r\nAs to the height of the great wave along this part of the shore-line\r\nof South America, the accounts vary. According to those which are best\r\nauthenticated, it would seem as though the wave exceeded considerably\r\nin height that which flowed along the Peruvian, Bolivian, and Chilian\r\nshores in August, 1868. At Huaniles the wave was estimated at sixty\r\nfeet in height, at Mexillones, where the wave, as it passed southwards,\r\nran into Mexillones Bay, it reached a height of sixty-five feet.\r\nTwo-thirds of the town were completely obliterated, wharves, railway\r\nstations, distilleries, etc., all swallowed up by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe shipping along the Peruvian and Bolivian coast suffered terribly.\r\nThe list of vessels lost or badly injured at Pabellon de Pica alone,\r\nreads like the list of a fleet.\r\n\r\nI have been particular in thus describing the effects produced by the\r\nearthquake and sea-wave on the shores of South America, in order that\r\nthe reader may recognize in the disturbance produced there the real\r\norigin of the great wave which a few hours later reached the Sandwich\r\nIsles, 5000 miles away. Doubt has been entertained respecting the\r\npossibility of a wave, other than the tidal-wave, being transmitted\r\nright across the Pacific. Although in August, 1868, the course of the\r\ngreat wave which swept from some region near Peru, not only across\r\nthe Pacific, but in all directions over the entire ocean, could be\r\nclearly traced, there were some who considered the connection between\r\nthe oceanic phenomena and the Peruvian earthquake a mere coincidence.\r\nIt is on this account perhaps chiefly that the evidence obtained in\r\nMay, 1876, is most important. It is interesting, indeed, as showing\r\nhow tremendous was the disturbance which the earth’s frame must\r\nthen have undergone. It would have been possible, however, had we\r\nno other evidence, for some to have maintained that the wave which\r\ncame in upon the shores of the Sandwich Isles a few hours after the\r\nearthquake and sea disturbance in South America was in reality an\r\nentirely independent phenomenon. But when we compare the events which\r\nhappened in May, 1876, with those of August, 1868, and perceive their\r\nexact similarity, we can no longer reasonably entertain any doubt of\r\nthe really stupendous fact that _the throes of the earth in and near\r\nPeru are of sufficient energy to send oceanic waves right across the\r\nPacific_,—waves, too, of such enormous height at starting, that,\r\nafter travelling with necessarily diminishing height the whole way\r\nto Hawaii, they still rose and fell through thirty-six feet The real\r\nsignificance of this amazing oceanic disturbance is exemplified by the\r\nwave circles which spread around the spot where a stone has fallen into\r\na smooth lake. We know how, as the circles widen, the height of the\r\nwave grows less and less, until, at no great distance from the centre\r\nof disturbance, the wave can no longer be discerned, so slight is the\r\nslope of its advancing and following faces. How tremendous, then, must\r\nhave been the upheaval of the bed of ocean by which wave-circles were\r\nsent across the Pacific, retaining, after travelling 5000 miles from\r\nthe centre of disturbance, the height of a two-storied house! In 1868,\r\nindeed, we know that the wave travelled very much further, reaching the\r\nshores of Japan, of New Zealand, and of Australia, even if it did not\r\nmake its way through the East Indian Archipelago to the Indian Ocean,\r\nas some observations seem to show. Although no news has been received\r\nwhich would justify us in believing that the wave of May, 1876,\r\nproduced corresponding effects at such great distances from the centre\r\nof disturbance, it must be remembered that the dimensions of the wave\r\nwhen it reached the Sandwich Isles fell far short of those of the great\r\nwave of August 13–14, 1868.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to make a direct comparison between the waves of May,\r\n1876, and August, 1868, in this respect, as also with regard to the\r\nrate at which they would seem to have traversed the distance between\r\nPeru and Hawaii. On this last point, however, it must be noted that\r\nwe cannot form an exact opinion until we have ascertained the real\r\nregion of Vulcanian disturbance on each occasion. It is possible that\r\na careful comparison of times, and of the direction in which the wave\r\nfront advanced upon different shores, might serve to show where this\r\nregion lay. I should not be greatly surprised to learn that it was far\r\nfrom the continent of South America.\r\n\r\nThe great wave reached the Sandwich Isles between four and five on the\r\nmorning of May 10, corresponding to about five hours later of Peruvian\r\ntime. An oscillation only was first observed at Hilo, on the east coast\r\nof the great southern island of Hawaii, the wave itself not reaching\r\nthe village till about a quarter before five. The greatest difference\r\nbetween the crest and trough of the wave was found to be thirty-six\r\nfeet here; but at the opposite side of the island, in Kealakekua Bay\r\n(where Captain Cook was killed), amounted only to thirty feet. In\r\nother places the difference was much less, being in some only three\r\nfeet, a circumstance doubtless due to interference, waves which have\r\nreached the same spot along different courses chancing so to arrive\r\nthat the crest of one corresponded with the trough of the other, so\r\nthat the resulting wave was only the difference of the two. We must\r\nexplain, however, in the same way, the highest waves of thirty-six to\r\nforty feet, which were doubtless due to similar interference, crest\r\nagreeing with crest and trough with trough, so that the resulting wave\r\nwas the sum of the two which had been divided, and had reached the\r\nsame spot along different courses. It would follow that the higher of\r\nthe two waves was about twenty-one feet high, the lower about eighteen\r\nfeet high; but as some height would be lost in the encounter with the\r\nshore-line, wherever it lay, on which the waves divided, we may fairly\r\nassume that in the open ocean, before reaching the Sandwich group, the\r\nwave had a height of nearly thirty feet from trough to crest. We read,\r\nin accordance with this explanation, that “the regurgitations of the\r\nsea were violent and complex, and continued through the day.”\r\n\r\nThe wave, regarded as a whole, seems to have reached all the islands at\r\nthe same time. Since this has not been contradicted by later accounts,\r\nwe are compelled to conclude that the wave reached the group with its\r\nfront parallel to the length of the group, so that it must have come\r\n(arriving as it did from the side towards which Hilo lies) from the\r\nnorth-east It was, then, not the direct wave from Peru, but the wave\r\nreflected from the shores of California, which produced the most marked\r\neffects. We can understand well, this being so, that the regurgitations\r\nof the sea were complex. Any one who has watched the inflow of waves\r\non a beach so lying within an angle of the line that while one set of\r\nwaves comes straight in from the sea, another thwart set comes from the\r\nshore forming the other side of the angle, will understand how such\r\nwaves differ from a set of ordinary rollers. The crests of the two\r\nsets form a sort of network, ever changing as each set rolls on; and\r\nconsidering any one of the four-cornered meshes of this wave-net, the\r\nobserver will notice that while the middle of the raised sides rises\r\nlittle above the surrounding level, because here the crests of one set\r\ncross the troughs of the other, the corners of each quadrangle are\r\nhigher than they would be in either set taken separately, while the\r\nmiddle of the four-cornered space is correspondingly depressed. The\r\nreason is that at the corners of the wave-net crests join with crests\r\nto raise the water surface, while in the middle of the net (not the\r\nmiddle of the sides, but the middle of the space enclosed by the four\r\nsides) trough joins with trough to depress the water surface.[24]\r\n\r\nWe must take into account the circumstance that the wave which reached\r\nHawaii in May, 1876, was probably reflected from the Californian coast,\r\nwhen we endeavour to determine the rate at which the sea disturbance\r\nwas propagated across the Atlantic. The direct wave would have come\r\nsooner, and may have escaped notice because arriving in the night-time,\r\nas it would necessarily have done if a wave which travelled to\r\nCalifornia, and thence, after reflection, to the Sandwich group arrived\r\nthere at a quarter before five in the morning following the Peruvian\r\nearthquake. We shall be better able to form an opinion on this point\r\nafter considering what happened in August, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe earth-throe on that occasion was felt in Peru about five minutes\r\npast five on the evening of August 13. Twelve hours later, or shortly\r\nbefore midnight, August 13, Sandwich Island time (corresponding to\r\n5 p.m., August 14, Peruvian time), the sea round the group of the\r\nSandwich Isles rose in a surprising manner, “insomuch that many thought\r\nthe islands were sinking, and would shortly subside altogether beneath\r\nthe waves. Some of the smaller islands were for a time completely\r\nsubmerged. Before long, however, the sea fell again, and as it did so\r\nthe observers found it impossible to resist the impression that the\r\nislands were rising bodily out of the water. For no less than three\r\ndays this strange oscillation of the sea continued to be experienced,\r\nthe most remarkable ebbs and floods being noticed at Honolulu, on the\r\nisland of Woahoo.”\r\n\r\nThe distance between Honolulu and Arica is about 6300 statute miles;\r\nso that, if the wave travelled directly from the shores of Peru to the\r\nSandwich Isles, it must have advanced at an average rate of about 525\r\nmiles an hour (about 450 knots an hour). This is nearly half the rate\r\nat which the earth’s surface near the equator is carried round by the\r\nearth’s rotation, or is about the rate at which parts in latitude 62 or\r\n63 degrees north are carried round by rotation; so that the motion of\r\nthe great wave in 1868 was fairly comparable with one of the movements\r\nwhich we are accustomed to regard as cosmical. I shall presently have\r\nsomething more to say on this point.\r\n\r\nNow in May, 1876, as we have seen, the wave reached Hawaii at about a\r\nquarter to five in the morning, corresponding to about ten, Peruvian\r\ntime. Since, then, the earthquake was felt in Peru at half-past eight\r\non the previous evening, it follows that the wave, if it travelled\r\ndirectly from Peru, must have taken about 13½ hours—or an hour and a\r\nhalf longer, in travelling from Peru to the Sandwich Isles, than it\r\ntook in August, 1868. This is unlikely, because ocean-waves travel\r\nnearly at the same rate in the same parts of the ocean, whatever\r\ntheir dimensions, so only that they are large. We have, then, in the\r\ndifference of time occupied by the wave in May, 1876, and in August,\r\n1868, in reaching Hawaii, some confirmation of the result to which we\r\nwere led by the arrival of the wave simultaneously at all the islands\r\nof the Sandwich group—the inference, namely, that the observed wave\r\nhad reached these islands after reflection from the Californian\r\nshore-line. As the hour when the direct wave probably reached Hawaii\r\nwas about a quarter past three in the morning, when not only was it\r\nnight-time but also a time when few would be awake to notice the rise\r\nand fall of the sea, it seems not at all improbable that the direct\r\nwave escaped notice, and that the wave actually observed was the\r\nreflected wave from California. The direction, also, in which the\r\noscillation was first observed corresponds well with this explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the wave which traversed the Pacific in May, 1876,\r\nwas somewhat inferior in size to that of August, 1868, which therefore\r\nstill deserves to be called (as I then called it) the greatest sea-wave\r\never known. The earthquake, indeed, which preceded the oceanic\r\ndisturbance of 1868 was far more destructive than that of May, 1876,\r\nand the waves which came in upon the Peruvian and Bolivian shores were\r\nlarger. Nevertheless, the wave of May, 1876, was not so far inferior to\r\nthat of August, 1868, but that its course could be traced athwart the\r\nentire extent of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the characteristic features of the Peruvian and\r\nChilian earthquakes, and especially when we note how wide is the extent\r\nof the region over which their action is felt in one way or another,\r\nit can scarcely be doubted that the earth’s Vulcanian energies are at\r\npresent more actively at work throughout that region than in any other.\r\nThere is nothing so remarkable, one may even say so stupendous, in\r\nthe history of subterranean disturbance as the alternation of mighty\r\nearth-throes by which, at one time, the whole of the Chilian Andes seem\r\ndisturbed and anon the whole of the Peruvian Andes. In Chili scarcely\r\na year ever passes without earthquakes, and the same may be said of\r\nPeru; but so far as great earthquakes are concerned the activity of the\r\nPeruvian region seems to synchronize with the comparative quiescence\r\nof the Chilian region, and _vice versâ_. Thus, in 1797, the terrible\r\nearthquake occurred which is known as the earthquake of Riobamba, which\r\naffected the entire Peruvian earthquake region. Thirty years later\r\na series of tremendous throes shook the whole of Chili, permanently\r\nelevating its long line of coast to the height of several feet. During\r\nthe last twelve years the Peruvian region has in turn been disturbed by\r\ngreat earthquakes. It should be added that between Chili and Peru there\r\nis a region about five hundred miles in length in which scarcely any\r\nvolcanic action has been observed. And singularly enough, “this very\r\nportion of the Andes, to which one would imagine that the Peruvians and\r\nChilians would fly as to a region of safety, is the part most thinly\r\ninhabited; insomuch that, as Von Buch observes, it is in some places\r\nentirely deserted.”\r\n\r\nOne can readily understand that this enormous double region of\r\nearthquakes, whose oscillations on either side of the central region\r\nof comparative rest may be compared to the swaying of a mighty see-saw\r\non either side of its point of support, should be capable of giving\r\nbirth to throes propelling sea-waves across the Pacific Ocean. The\r\nthroe actually experienced at any given place is relatively but an\r\ninsignificant phenomenon: it is the disturbance of the entire region\r\nover which the throe is felt which must be considered in attempting\r\nto estimate the energy of the disturbing cause. The region shaken by\r\nthe earthquake of 1868, for instance, was equal to at least a fourth\r\nof Europe, and probably to fully one-half. From Quito southwards as\r\nfar as Iquique—or along a full third part of the length of the South\r\nAmerican Andes—the shock produced destructive effects. It was also\r\ndistinctly felt far to the north of Quito, far to the south of Iquique,\r\nand inland to enormous distances. The disturbing forces which thus\r\nshook 1,000,000 square miles of the earth’s surface must have been of\r\nalmost inconceivable energy. If directed entirely to the upheaval of a\r\nland region no larger than England, those forces would have sufficed\r\nto have destroyed utterly every city, town, and village within such a\r\nregion; if directed entirely to the upheaval of an oceanic region, they\r\nwould have been capable of raising a wave which would have been felt\r\non every shore-line of the whole earth. Divided even between the ocean\r\non the one side and a land region larger than Russia in Europe on the\r\nother, those Vulcanian forces shook the whole of the land region, and\r\nsent athwart the largest of our earth’s oceans a wave which ran in upon\r\nshores 10,000 miles from the centre of disturbance with a crest thirty\r\nfeet high. Forces such as these may fairly be regarded as cosmical;\r\nthey show unmistakably that the earth has by no means settled down into\r\nthat condition of repose in which some geologists still believe. We\r\nmay ask with the late Sir Charles Lyell whether, after contemplating\r\nthe tremendous energy thus displayed by the earth, any geologist will\r\ncontinue to assert that the changes of relative level of land and sea,\r\nso common in former ages of the world, have now ceased? and agree\r\nwith him that if, in the face of such evidence, a geologist persists\r\nin maintaining this favourite dogma, it would be vain to hope, by\r\naccumulating proofs of similar convulsions during a series of ages, to\r\nshake the tenacity of his conviction—\r\n\r\n    “Si fractus illabatur orbis,\r\n    Impavidum ferient ruinæ.”\r\n\r\nBut there is one aspect in which such mighty sea-waves as, in 1868 and\r\nagain in May, 1876, have swept over the surface of our terrestrial\r\noceans, remains yet to be considered.\r\n\r\nThe oceans and continents of our earth must be clearly discernible from\r\nher nearer neighbours among the planets—from Venus and Mercury on the\r\ninner side of her path around the sun, and from Mars (though under\r\nless favourable conditions) from the outer side. When we consider,\r\nindeed, that the lands and seas of Mars can be clearly discerned with\r\ntelescopic aid from our earth at a distance of forty millions of miles,\r\nwe perceive that our earth, seen from Venus at little more than half\r\nthis distance, must present a very interesting appearance. Enlarged,\r\nowing to greater proximity, nearly fourfold, having a diameter nearly\r\ntwice as great as that of Mars, so that at the same distance her disc\r\nwould seem more than three times as large, more brightly illuminated\r\nby the sun in the proportion of about five to two, she would shine\r\nwith a lustre exceeding that of Mars, when in full brightness in the\r\nmidnight sky, about thirty times; and all her features would of course\r\nbe seen with correspondingly increased distinctness. Moreover, the\r\noceans of our earth are so much larger in relative extent than those\r\nof Mars, covering nearly three-fourths instead of barely one-half of\r\nthe surface of the world they belong to, that they would appeal as far\r\nmore marked and characteristic features than the seas and lakes of\r\nMars. When the Pacific Ocean, indeed, occupies centrally the disc of\r\nthe earth which at the moment is turned towards any planet, nearly the\r\nwhole of that disc must appear to be covered by the ocean. Under such\r\ncircumstances the passage of a wide-spreading series of waves over the\r\nPacific, at the rate of about 500 miles an hour, is a phenomenon which\r\ncould scarcely fail to be discernible from Venus or Mercury, if either\r\nplanet chanced to be favourably placed for the observation of the\r\nearth—always supposing there were observers in Mercury or Venus, and\r\nthat these observers were provided with powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the waves which spread over the Pacific\r\non August 13–14, 1868, and again on May 9–10, 1876, were not only of\r\nenormous range in length (measured along crest or trough), but also\r\nof enormous breadth (measured from crest to crest, or from trough\r\nto trough). Were it otherwise, indeed, the progress of a wave forty\r\nor fifty feet high (at starting, and thirty-five feet high after\r\ntravelling 6000 miles), at the rate of 500 miles per hour, must\r\nhave proved destructive to ships in the open ocean as well as along\r\nthe shore-line. Suppose, for instance, the breadth of the wave from\r\ncrest to crest one mile, then, in passing under a ship at the rate\r\nof 500 miles per hour, the wave would raise the ship from trough to\r\ncrest—that is, through a height of forty feet—in one-thousandth\r\npart of an hour (for the distance from trough to crest is but half\r\nthe breadth of the wave), or in less than four seconds, lowering it\r\nagain in the same short interval of time, lifting and lowering it\r\nat the same rate several successive times. The velocity with which\r\nthe ship would travel upwards and downwards would be greatest when\r\nshe was midway in her ascent and descent, and would then be equal to\r\nabout the velocity with which a body strikes the ground after falling\r\nfrom a height of four yards. It is hardly necessary to say that small\r\nvessels subjected to such tossing as this would inevitably be swamped.\r\nOn even the largest ships the effect of such motion would be most\r\nunpleasantly obvious. Now, as a matter of fact, the passage of the\r\ngreat sea-wave in 1868 was not noticed at all on board ships in open\r\nsea. Even within sight of the shore of Peru, where the oscillation of\r\nthe sea was most marked, the motion was such that its effects were\r\nreferred to the shore. We are told that observers on the deck of a\r\nUnited States’ war steamer distinctly saw the “peaks of the mountains\r\nin the chain of the Cordilleras wave to and fro like reeds in a storm;”\r\nthe fact really being that the deck on which they stood was swayed to\r\nand fro. This, too, was in a part of the sea where the great wave had\r\nnot attained its open sea form, but was a rolling wave, because of the\r\nshallowness of the water. In the open sea, we read that the passage\r\nof the great sea-wave was no more noticed than is the passage of the\r\ntidal-wave itself. “Among the hundreds of ships which were sailing upon\r\nthe Pacific when its length and breadth were traversed by the great\r\nsea-wave, there was not one in which any unusual motion was perceived.”\r\nThe inference is clear, that the slope of the advancing and following\r\nfaces of the great wave was very much less than in the case above\r\nimagined; in other words, that the breadth of the wave greatly exceeded\r\none mile—amounting, in fact, to many miles.\r\n\r\nWhere the interval between the passage of successive wave-crests was\r\nnoted, we can tell the actual breadth of the wave. Thus, at the Samoan\r\nIsles, in 1868, the crests succeeded each other at intervals of sixteen\r\nminutes, corresponding to eight minutes between crest and trough.\r\nBut we have seen, that if the waves were one mile in breadth, the\r\ncorresponding interval would be only four seconds, or only one 120th\r\npart of eight minutes: it follows, then, that the breadth of the great\r\nwave, where it reached the Samoan Isles in 1868, was about 120 miles.\r\n\r\nNow a wave extending right athwart the Pacific Ocean, and having a\r\ncross breadth of more than 120 miles, would be discernible as a marked\r\nfeature of the disc of our earth, seen under the conditions described\r\nabove, either from Mercury or Venus. It is true that the slope of\r\nthe wave’s advancing and following surfaces would be but slight, yet\r\nthe difference of the illumination under the sun’s rays would be\r\nrecognizable. Then, also, it is to be remembered that there was not\r\nmerely a single wave, but a succession of many waves. These travelled\r\nalso with enormous velocity; and though at the distance of even the\r\nnearest planet, the apparent motion of the great wave, swift though\r\nit was in reality, would be so far reduced that it would have to be\r\nestimated rather than actually seen, yet there would be no difficulty\r\nin thus perceiving it with the mind’s eye. The rate of motion indeed\r\nwould almost be exactly the same as that of the equatorial part of the\r\nsurface of Mars, in consequence of the planet’s rotation; and this\r\n(as is well known to telescopists), though not discernible directly,\r\nproduces, even in a few minutes, changes which a good eye can clearly\r\nrecognize. We can scarcely doubt then that if our earth were so\r\nsituated at any time when one of the great waves generated by Peruvian\r\nearthquakes in traversing the Pacific, that the hemisphere containing\r\nthis ocean were turned fully illuminated towards Venus (favourably\r\nplaced for observing her), the disturbance of the Pacific could be\r\nobserved and measured by telescopists on that planet.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is little chance that terrestrial observers will\r\never be able to watch the progress of great waves athwart the oceans of\r\nMars, and still less that any disturbance of the frame of Venus should\r\nbecome discernible to us by its effects. We can scarce even be assured\r\nthat there are lands and seas on Venus, so far as direct observation is\r\nconcerned, so unfavourably is she always placed for observation; and\r\nthough we see Mars under much more favourable conditions, his seas are\r\ntoo small and would seem to be too shallow (compared with our own) for\r\ngreat waves to traverse them such as could be discerned from the earth.\r\n\r\nYet it is well to remember the possibility that changes may at times\r\ntake place in the nearer planets—the terrestrial planets, as they\r\nare commonly called, Mars, Venus, and Mercury—such as telescopic\r\nobservation under favourable conditions might detect. Telescopists\r\nhave, indeed, described apparent changes, lasting only for a short\r\ntime, in the appearance of one of these planets, Mars, which may fairly\r\nbe attributed to disturbances affecting its surface in no greater\r\ndegree than the great Peruvian earthquakes have affected for a time the\r\nsurface of our earth. For instance, the American astronomer Mitchel\r\nsays that on the night of July 12, 1845, bright polar snows of Mars\r\nexhibited an appearance never noticed at any preceding or succeeding\r\nobservation. In the very centre of the white surface appeared a\r\ndark spot, which retained its position during several hours: on the\r\nfollowing evening not a trace of the spot could be seen. Again the same\r\nobserver says that on the evening of August 30, 1845, he observed for\r\nthe first time a small bright spot, nearly or quite round, projecting\r\nout of the lower side of the polar spot. “In the early part of the\r\nevening,” he says, “the small bright spot seemed to be partly buried\r\nin the large one. After the lapse of an hour or more my attention was\r\nagain directed to the planet, when I was astonished to find a manifest\r\nchange in the position of the small bright spot. It had apparently\r\nseparated from the large spot, and the edges alone of the two were now\r\nin contact, whereas when first seen they overlapped by an amount quite\r\nequal to one-third of the diameter of the small one. This, however,\r\nwas merely an optical phenomenon, for on the next evening the spots\r\nwent through the same apparent changes as the planet went through the\r\ncorresponding part of its rotation. But it showed the spots to be real\r\nice masses. The strange part of the story is that in the course of a\r\nfew days the smaller spot, which must have been a mass of snow and ice\r\nas large as Novaia Zemlia, gradually disappeared. Probably some great\r\nshock had separated an enormous field of ice from the polar snows, and\r\nit had eventually been broken up and its fragments carried away from\r\nthe Arctic regions by currents in the Martian oceans. It appears to\r\nme that the study of our own earth, and of the changes and occasional\r\nconvulsions which affect its surface, gives to the observation of such\r\nphenomena as I have just described a new interest. Or rather, perhaps,\r\nit is not too much to say that the telescopic observations of the\r\nplanets derive their only real interest from such considerations.\r\n\r\nI may note in conclusion, that while on the one hand we cannot doubt\r\nthat the earth is slowly parting with its internal heat, and thus\r\nlosing century by century a portion of its Vulcanian energy, such\r\nphenomena as the Peruvian earthquakes show that the loss of energy is\r\ntaking place so slowly that the diminution during many ages is almost\r\nimperceptible. As I have elsewhere remarked, “When we see that while\r\nmountain ranges were being upheaved or valleys depressed to their\r\npresent position, race after race and type after type lived out on the\r\nearth the long lives which belong to races and to types, we recognize\r\nthe great work which the earth’s subterranean forces are still engaged\r\nupon. Even now continents are being slowly depressed or upheaved, even\r\nnow mountain ranges are being raised to a different level, table-lands\r\nare being formed, great valleys are being gradually scooped out; old\r\nshore-lines shift their place, old soundings vary; the sea advances in\r\none place and retires in another; on every side nature’s plastic hand\r\nis still at work, modelling and remodelling the earth, and making it\r\nconstantly a fit abode for those who dwell upon it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_STRANGE SEA CREATURES._\r\n\r\n  “We ought to make up our minds to dismiss as idle prejudices,\r\n  or, at least, suspend as premature, any preconceived notion of\r\n  what _might_, or what _ought to_, _be_ the order of nature, and\r\n  content ourselves with observing, as a plain matter of fact, what\r\n  _is_.”—Sir J. HERSCHEL, “Prelim. Disc.” page 79.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fancies of men have peopled three of the four so-called elements,\r\nearth, air, water, and fire, with strange forms of life, and have even\r\nfound in the salamander an inhabitant for the fourth. On land the\r\ncentaur and the unicorn, in the air the dragon and the roc, in the\r\nwater tritons and mermaids, may be named as instances among many of the\r\nfabulous creatures which have been not only imagined but believed in\r\nby men of old times. Although it may be doubted whether men have ever\r\ninvented any absolutely imaginary forms of life, yet the possibility\r\nof combining known forms into imaginary, and even impossible, forms,\r\nmust be admitted as an important element in any inquiry into the origin\r\nof ideas respecting such creatures as I have named. One need only look\r\nthrough an illuminated manuscript of the Middle Ages to recognize the\r\nreadiness with which imaginary creatures can be formed by combining,\r\nor by exaggerating, the characteristics of known animals. Probably\r\nthe combined knowledge and genius of all the greatest zoologists of\r\nour time would not suffice for the invention of an entirely new form\r\nof animal which yet should be zoologically possible; but to combine\r\nthe qualities of several existent animals in a single one, or to\r\nconceive an animal with some peculiarity abnormally developed, is\r\nwithin the capacity of persons very little acquainted with zoology,\r\nnay, is perhaps far easier to such persons than it would be to an\r\nOwen, a Huxley, or a Darwin. In nearly every case, however, the purely\r\nimaginary being is to be recognized by the utter impossibility of\r\nits actual existence. If it be a winged man, arms and wings are both\r\nprovided, but the pectoral muscles are left unchanged. A winged horse,\r\nin like manner, is provided with wings, without any means of working\r\nthem. A centaur, as in the noble sculptures of Phidias, has the upper\r\npart of the trunk of a man superadded, not to the hind quarters of a\r\nhorse or other quadruped, but to the entire trunk of such an animal,\r\nso that the abdomen of the human figure lies _between_ the upper half\r\nof the human trunk and the corresponding part of the horse’s trunk,\r\nan arrangement anatomically preposterous. Without saying that every\r\nfabulous animal which was anatomically and zoologically possible, had a\r\nreal antitype, exaggerated though the fabulous form may have been, we\r\nmust yet admit that errors so gross marked the conception of all the\r\nreally imaginary animals of antiquity, that any fabulous animal found\r\nto accord fairly well with zoological possibilities may be regarded,\r\nwith extreme probability, as simply the exaggerated presentation of\r\nsome really existent animal. The inventors of centaurs, winged and\r\nman-faced bulls, many-headed dogs, harpies, and so forth, were utterly\r\nunable to invent a possible new animal, save by the merest chance, the\r\nprobability of which was so small that it may fairly be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThis view of the so-called fabulous animals of antiquity has been\r\nconfirmed by the results of modern zoological research. The merman,\r\nzoologically possible (not in all details, of course, but generally),\r\nhas found its antitype in the dugong and the manatee; the roc in the\r\ncondor, or perhaps in those extinct species whose bones attest their\r\nmonstrous proportions; the unicorn in the rhinoceros; even the dragon\r\nin the pterodactyl of the green-sand; while the centaur, the minotaur,\r\nthe winged horse, and so forth, have become recognized as purely\r\nimaginary creatures, which had their origin simply in the fanciful\r\ncombination of known forms, no existent creatures having even suggested\r\nthese monstrosities.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the sea should have been more prolific\r\nin monstrosities and in forms whose real nature has been misunderstood.\r\nLand animals cannot long escape close observation. Even the most\r\npowerful and ferocious beasts must succumb in the long run to man, and\r\nin former ages, when the struggle was still undecided between some race\r\nof animals and savage man, individual specimens of the race must often\r\nhave been killed, and the true appearance of the animal determined.\r\nPowerful winged animals might for a longer time remain comparatively\r\nmysterious creatures even to those whom they attacked, or whose flocks\r\nthey ravaged. A mighty bird, or a pterodactylian creature (a late\r\nsurvivor of a race then fast dying out), might swoop down on his prey\r\nand disappear with it too swiftly to be made the subject of close\r\nscrutiny, still less of exact scientific observation. Yet the general\r\ncharacteristics even of such creatures would before long be known.\r\nFrom time to time the strange winged monster would be seen hovering\r\nover the places where his prey was to be found. Occasionally it would\r\nbe possible to pierce one of the race with an arrow or a javelin; and\r\nthus, even in those remote periods when the savage progenitors of the\r\npresent races of man had to carry on a difficult contest with animals\r\nnow extinct or greatly reduced in power, it would become possible to\r\ndetermine accurately the nature of the winged enemy. But with sea\r\ncreatures, monstrous, or otherwise, the case would be very different.\r\nTo this day we remain ignorant of much that is hidden beneath the\r\nwaves of the “hollow-sounding and mysterious main.” Of far the greater\r\nnumber of sea creatures, it may truly be said that we never see any\r\nspecimens except by accident, and never obtain the body of any except\r\nby very rare accident. Those creatures of the deep sea which we are\r\nbest acquainted with, are either those which are at once very numerous\r\nand very useful as food or in some other way, or else those which are\r\nvery rapacious and thus expose themselves, by their attacks on men,\r\nto counter-attack and capture or destruction. In remote times, when\r\nmen were less able to traverse the wide seas, when, on the one hand,\r\nattacks from great sea creatures were more apt to be successful,\r\nwhile, on the other, counter-attack was much more dangerous, still\r\nless would be known about the monsters of the deep. Seen only for a\r\nfew moments as he seized his prey, and then sinking back into the\r\ndepths, a sea monster would probably remain a mystery even to those\r\nwho had witnessed his attack, while their imperfect account of what\r\nthey had seen would be modified at each repetition of the story, until\r\nthere would remain little by which the creature could be identified,\r\neven if at some subsequent period its true nature were recognized. We\r\ncan readily understand, then, that among the fabulous creatures of\r\nantiquity, even of those which represented actually existent races\r\nincorrectly described, the most remarkable, and those zoologically\r\nthe least intelligible, would be the monsters of the deep sea. We can\r\nalso understand that even the accounts which originally corresponded\r\nbest with the truth would have undergone modifications much more\r\nnoteworthy than those affecting descriptions of land animals or winged\r\ncreatures—simply because there would be small chance of any errors\r\nthus introduced being corrected by the study of freshly discovered\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nWe may, perhaps, explain in this way the strange account given by\r\nBerosus of the creature which came up from the Red Sea, having the body\r\nof a fish but the front and head of a man. We may well believe that\r\nthis animal was no other than a dugong, or halicore (a word signifying\r\nsea-maiden), a creature inhabiting the Indian Ocean to this day, and\r\nwhich might readily find its way into the Red Sea. But the account of\r\nthe creature has been strangely altered from the original narrative,\r\nif at least the original narrative was correct. For, according to\r\nBerosus, the animal had two human feet which projected from each side\r\nof the tail; and, still stranger, it had a human voice and human\r\nlanguage. “This strange monster sojourned among the rude people during\r\nthe day, taking no food, but retiring to the sea again at night, and\r\ncontinued for some time teaching them the arts of civilized life.” A\r\npicture of this stranger is said to have been preserved at Babylon\r\nfor many centuries. With a probable substratum of truth, the story in\r\nits latest form is as fabulous as Autolycus’s “ballad of a fish that\r\nappeared upon the coast, on Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty\r\nthousand fathoms above water, and sang a ballad against the hard hearts\r\nof maids.”\r\n\r\nIt is singular, by the way, how commonly the power of speech, or at\r\nleast of producing sounds resembling speech or musical notes, was\r\nattributed to the creature which imagination converted into a man-fish\r\nor woman-fish. Dugongs and manatees make a kind of lowing noise, which\r\ncould scarcely be mistaken under ordinary conditions for the sound of\r\nthe human voice. Yet, not only is this peculiarity ascribed to the\r\nmermaid and siren (the merman and triton having even the supposed power\r\nof blowing on conch-shells), but in more recent accounts of encounters\r\nwith creatures presumably of the seal tribe and allied races, the same\r\nfeature is to be noticed. The following account, quoted by Mr. Gosse\r\nfrom a narrative by Captain Weddell, the well-known geographer, is\r\ninteresting for this reason amongst others. It also illustrates well\r\nthe mixture of erroneous details (the offspring, doubtless, of an\r\nexcited imagination) with the correct description of a sea creature\r\nactually seen:—“A boat’s crew were employed on Hall’s Island, when\r\none of the crew, left to take care of some produce, saw an animal\r\nwhose voice was musical. The sailor had lain down, and at ten o’clock\r\nhe heard a noise resembling human cries, and as daylight in these\r\nlatitudes never disappears at this season” (the Antarctic summer),\r\n“he rose and looked around, but, on seeing no person, returned to\r\nbed. Presently he heard the noise again; he rose a second time, but\r\nstill saw nothing. Conceiving, however, the possibility of a boat\r\nbeing upset, and that some of the crew might be clinging to detached\r\nrocks, he walked along the beach a few steps and heard the noise more\r\ndistinctly but in a musical strain. Upon searching around, he saw an\r\nobject lying on a rock a dozen yards from the shore, at which he was\r\nsomewhat frightened. The face and shoulders appeared of human form and\r\nof a reddish colour; over the shoulders hung long green hair; the tail\r\nresembled that of the seal, but the extremities of the arms he could\r\nnot see distinctly. The creature continued to make a musical noise\r\nwhile he gazed about two minutes, and on perceiving him it disappeared\r\nin an instant. Immediately, when the man saw his officer, he told this\r\nwild tale, and to add weight to his testimony (being a Romanist) he\r\nmade a cross on the sand, which he kissed, as making oath to the truth\r\nof his statement. When I saw him he told the story in so clear and\r\npositive a manner, making oath to its truth, that I concluded he must\r\nreally have seen the animal he described, or that it must have been the\r\neffects of a disturbed imagination.”\r\n\r\nIn this story all is consistent with the belief that the sailor saw\r\nan animal belonging to the seal family (of a species unknown to him),\r\nexcept the green hair. But the hour was not very favourable to the\r\ndiscerning of colour, though daylight had not quite passed away, and as\r\nGosse points out, since golden-yellow fur and black fur are found among\r\nAntarctic seals, the colours may be intermingled in some individuals,\r\nproducing an olive-green tint, which, by contrast with the reddish\r\nskin, might be mistaken for a full green. Considering that the man had\r\nbeen roused from sleep and was somewhat frightened, he would not be\r\nlikely to make very exact observations. It will be noticed that it was\r\nonly at first that he mistook the sounds made by the creature for human\r\ncries; afterwards he heard only the same _noise_, but in a musical\r\nstrain. Now with regard to the musical sounds said to have been uttered\r\nby this creature, and commonly attributed to creatures belonging to\r\nfamilies closely allied to the seals, I do not know that any attempt\r\nhas yet been made to show that these families possess the power of\r\nemitting sounds which can properly be described as musical. It is quite\r\npossible that the Romanist sailor’s ears were not very nice, and that\r\nany sound softer than a bellow seemed musical to him. Still, the idea\r\nsuggests itself that possibly seals, like some other animals, possess a\r\nnote not commonly used, but only as a signal to their mates, and never\r\nuttered when men or other animals are known to be near. It appears\r\nto me that this is rendered probable by the circumstance that seals\r\nare fond of music. Darwin refers to this in his treatise on Sexual\r\nSelection (published with his “Descent of Man”), and quotes a statement\r\nto the effect that the fondness of seals for music “was well known to\r\nthe ancients, and is often taken advantage of by hunters to the present\r\nday.” The significance of this will be understood from Darwin’s remark\r\nimmediately following, that “with all these animals, the males of which\r\nduring the season of courtship incessantly produce musical notes or\r\nmere rhythmical sounds, we must believe that the females are able to\r\nappreciate them.”\r\n\r\nThe remark about the creature’s arms seems strongly to favour the\r\nbelief that the sailor intended his narrative to be strictly truthful.\r\nHad he wished to excite the interest of his comrades by a marvellous\r\nstory, he certainly would have described the creature as having\r\nwell-developed human hands.\r\n\r\nLess trustworthy by far seem some of the stories which have been told\r\nof animals resembling the mermaid of antiquity. It must always be\r\nremembered, however, that in all probability we know very few among the\r\nspecies of seals and allied races, and that some of these species may\r\npresent, in certain respects and perhaps at a certain age, much closer\r\nresemblance to the human form than the sea-lion, seal, manatee, or\r\ndugong.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, for instance, attach much weight to the following story\r\nrelated by Hudson, the famous navigator:—“One of our company, looking\r\noverboard, saw a mermaid and calling up some of the company to see her,\r\none more came up, and by that time she was come close to the ship’s\r\nside, looking earnestly on the men. A little after a sea came and\r\noverturned her. From the navel upward her back and breasts were like a\r\nwoman’s, as they say that saw her; her body as big as one of us; her\r\nskin very white; and long hair hanging down behind, of colour black. In\r\nher going down they saw her tail, which was like the tail of a porpoise\r\nand speckled like a mackerel.” If Hudson himself had seen and thus\r\ndescribed the creature it would have been possible to regard the story\r\nwith some degree of credence; but his account of what Thomas Hilles and\r\nRobert Rayner, men about whose character for veracity we know nothing,\r\n_said_ they saw, is of little weight. The skin very white, and long\r\nhair hanging down behind, are especially suspicious features of the\r\nnarrative; and were probably introduced to dispose of the idea, which\r\nothers of the crew may have advanced, that the creature was only some\r\nkind of seal after all. The female seal (_Phoca Greenlandica_ is the\r\npretty name of the animal) is not, however, like the male, tawny grey,\r\nbut dusky white, or yellowish straw-colour, with a tawny tint on the\r\nback. The young alone could be called “very white.” They are so white\r\nin fact as scarcely to be distinguishable when lying on ice and snow,\r\na circumstance which, as Darwin considers, serves as a protection for\r\nthese little fellows.\r\n\r\nThe following story, quoted by Gosse from Dr. Robert Hamilton’s able\r\n“History of the Whales and Seals,” compares favourably in some respects\r\nwith the last narrative:—“It was reported that a fishing-boat off the\r\nisland of Yell, one of the Shetland group, had captured a mermaid by\r\nits getting entangled in the lines! The statement is, that the animal\r\nis about three feet long, the upper part of the body resembling the\r\nhuman, with protuberant mammæ like a woman; the face, the forehead,\r\nand neck, were short, and resembling those of a monkey; the arms,\r\nwhich were small, were kept folded across the breast; the fingers were\r\ndistinct, not webbed; a few stiff long bristles were on the top of\r\nthe head, extending down to the shoulders, and these it could erect\r\nand depress at pleasure, something like a crest. The inferior part of\r\nthe body was like a fish. The skin was smooth and of a grey colour.\r\nIt offered no resistance, nor attempted to bite, but uttered a low,\r\nplaintive sound. The crew, six in number, took it within their boat;\r\nbut superstition getting the better of curiosity, they carefully\r\ndisentangled it from the lines and a hook which had accidentally\r\nfastened in the body, and returned it to its native element. It\r\ninstantly dived, descending in a perpendicular direction.” “They had\r\nthe animal for three hours within the boat; the body was without scales\r\nor hair; of a silvery grey colour above, and white below, like the\r\nhuman skin; no gills were observed, nor fins on the back or belly. The\r\ntail was like that of the dog-fish; the mammæ were about as large as\r\nthose of a woman; the mouth and lips were very distinct, and resembled\r\nthe human.”\r\n\r\nThis account, if accepted in all its details, would certainly indicate\r\nthat an animal of some species before unknown had been captured. But it\r\nis doubtful how much reliance can be placed on the description of the\r\nanimal. Mr. Gosse, commenting upon the case, says that the fishermen\r\ncannot have been affected by fear in such sort that their imagination\r\nexaggerated the resemblance of the creature to the human form. “For the\r\nmermaid,” he says, “is not an object of terror to the fishermen; it\r\nis rather a welcome guest, and danger is to be apprehended only from\r\nits experiencing bad treatment.” But then this creature had not been\r\ntreated as a specially welcome guest. The crew had captured it; and\r\nprobably not without some degree of violence; for though it offered\r\nno resistance it uttered a plaintive cry. And that hook which “had\r\naccidentally fastened in the body” has a very suspicious look. If the\r\nanimal could have given its own account of the capture, probably the\r\nhook would not have been found to have fastened in the body altogether\r\nby accident. Be this as it may, the fishermen were so far frightened\r\nthat superstition got the better of curiosity; so that, as they were\r\nevidently very foolish fellows, their evidence is scarcely worth much.\r\nThere are, however, only two points in their narrative which do not\r\nseem easily reconciled with the belief that they had captured a rather\r\nyoung female of a species closely allied to the common seal—the\r\ndistinct unwebbed fingers and the small arms folded across the breast.\r\nOther points in their description suggest marked differences in\r\ndegree from the usual characteristics of the female seal; but these\r\ntwo alone seem to differ absolutely in kind. Considering all the\r\ncircumstances of the narrative, we may perhaps agree with Mr. Gosse to\r\nthis extent, that, combined with other statements, the story induces a\r\nstrong suspicion that the northern seas may hold forms of life as yet\r\nuncatalogued by science.\r\n\r\nThe stories which have been related about monstrous cuttle-fish\r\nhave only been fabulous in regard to the dimensions which they have\r\nattributed to these creatures. Even in this respect it has been shown,\r\nquite recently, that some of the accounts formerly regarded as fabulous\r\nfell even short of the truth. Pliny relates, for instance, that the\r\nbody of a monstrous cuttle-fish, of a kind known on the Spanish coast,\r\nweighed, when captured, 700 lbs., the head the same, the arms being 30\r\nfeet in length. The entire weight would probably have amounted to about\r\n2000 lbs. But we shall presently see that this weight has been largely\r\nexceeded by modern specimens. It was, however, in the Middle Ages that\r\nthe really fabulous cuttle-fish flourished—the gigantic kraken, “liker\r\nan island than an animal,” according to credulous Bishop Pontoppidan,\r\nand able to destroy in its mighty arms the largest galleons and war\r\nships of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that animals really monstrous should be magnified by the\r\nfears of those who have seen or encountered them, and still further\r\nmagnified afterwards by tradition. Some specimens of cuttle-fish which\r\nhave been captured wholly, or in part, indicate that this creature\r\nsometimes attains such dimensions that but little magnifying would\r\nbe needed to suggest even the tremendous proportions of the fabulous\r\nkraken. In 1861, the French war-steamer _Alecton_ encountered a\r\nmonstrous cuttle, on the surface of the sea, about 120 miles north-east\r\nof Teneriffe. The crew succeeded in slipping a noose round the body,\r\nbut unfortunately the rope slipped, and, being arrested by the tail\r\nfin, pulled off the tail. This was hauled on board, and found to weigh\r\nover 40 lbs. From a drawing of the animal, the total length without\r\nthe arms was estimated at 50 feet, and the weight at 4000 lbs., nearly\r\ntwice the weight of Pliny’s monstrous cuttle-fish, long regarded as\r\nfabulous. In one respect this creature seems to have been imperfect,\r\nthe two long arms usually possessed by cuttle-fish of the kind being\r\nwanting. Probably it had lost these long tentacles in a recent\r\nencounter with some sea enemy, perhaps one of its own species. Quite\r\npossibly it may have been such recent mutilation which exposed this\r\ncuttle-fish to successful attack by the crew of the _Alecton_.\r\n\r\nA cuttle-fish of about the same dimensions was encountered by two\r\nfishermen in 1873, in Conception Bay, Newfoundland. When they attacked\r\nit, the creature threw its long arms across the boat, but the fishermen\r\nwith an axe cut off these tentacles, on which the cephalopod withdrew\r\nin some haste. One of the arms was preserved, after it had lost about\r\n6 feet of its length. Even thus reduced it measured 19 feet; and as\r\nthe fishermen estimate that the arm was struck off about 10 feet from\r\nthe body, it follows that the entire length of the limb must have\r\nbeen about 35 feet. They estimated the body at 60 feet in length and\r\n5 feet in diameter—a monstrous creature! It was fortunate for these\r\nfishermen that they had an axe handy for its obtrusive tentacles, as\r\nwith so great a mass and the great propulsive power possessed by all\r\ncephalopods, it might readily have upset their small boat. Once in the\r\nwater, they would have been at the creature’s mercy—a quality which,\r\nby all accounts, the cuttle-fish does not possess to any remarkable\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nTurn we, however, from the half fabulous woman-fish, and the\r\nexaggeratedly monstrous cuttle-fish, to the famous sea-serpent, held\r\nby many to be the most utterly fabulous of all fabled creatures, while\r\na few, including some naturalists of distinction, stoutly maintain\r\nthat the creature has a real existence, though whether it be rightly\r\ncalled a sea-serpent or not is a point about which even believers are\r\nextremely doubtful.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, in the first place, to remark that in weighing the\r\nevidence for and against the existence of this creature, and bearing\r\non the question of its nature (if its existence be admitted), we ought\r\nnot to be influenced by the manifest falsity of a number of stories\r\nrelating to supposed encounters with this animal. It is probable\r\nthat, but for these absurd stories, the well-authenticated narratives\r\nrelating to the creature, whatever it may be, which has been called\r\nthe sea-serpent, would have received much more attention than has\r\nheretofore been given to them. It is also possible that some narratives\r\nwould have been published which have been kept back from the fear\r\nlest a truthful (though possibly mistaken) account should be classed\r\nwith the undoubted untruths which have been told respecting the great\r\nsea-serpent. It cannot be denied that in the main the inventions and\r\nhoaxes about the sea-serpent have come chiefly from American sources.\r\nIt is unfortunately supposed by too many of the less cultured sons of\r\nAmerica that (to use Mr. Gosse’s expression) “there is somewhat of wit\r\nin gross exaggerations or hoaxing inventions.” Of course an American\r\ngentleman—using the word “in that sense in which every man may be\r\na gentleman,” as Twemlow hath it—would as soon think of uttering a\r\nbase coin as a deliberate untruth or foolish hoax. But it is thought\r\nclever, by not a few in America who know no better, to take any one in\r\nby an invention. Some, perhaps but a small number, of the newspapers\r\nset a specially bad example in this respect, giving room in their\r\ncolumns for pretended discoveries in various departments of science,\r\nelaborate accounts of newly discovered animals, living or extinct, and\r\nother untruths which would be regarded as very disgraceful indeed by\r\nEnglish editors. Such was the famous “lunar hoax,” published in the\r\nNew York _Sun_ some forty years ago; such the narrative, in 1873, of a\r\nmonstrous fissure which had been discerned in the body of the moon, and\r\nthreatened to increase until the moon should be cloven into two unequal\r\nparts; such the fables which have from time to time appeared respecting\r\nthe sea-serpent. But it would be as unreasonable to reject, because\r\nof these last-named fables, the narratives which have been related by\r\nquiet, truth-loving folk, and have borne close and careful scrutiny, as\r\nit would be to reject the evidence given by the spectroscope respecting\r\nthe existence of iron and other metals in the sun because an absurd\r\nstory had told how creatures in the moon had been observed to make use\r\nof metal utensils or to adorn the roofs of their temples with metallic\r\nimitations of wreathed flames.\r\n\r\nThe oldest accounts on record of the appearance of a great sea creature\r\nresembling a serpent are those quoted by Bishop Pontoppidan, in his\r\ndescription of the natural history of his native country, Norway.\r\nAmongst these was one confirmed by oath taken before a magistrate\r\nby two of the crew of a ship commanded by Captain de Ferry, of the\r\nNorwegian navy. The captain and eight men saw the animal, near Molde,\r\nin August, 1747. They described it as of the general form of a serpent,\r\nstretched on the surface in receding coils (meaning, probably, the\r\nshape assumed by the neck of a swan when the head is drawn back). The\r\nhead, which resembled that of a horse, was raised two feet above the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1817, a large marine animal, supposed to be a serpent, was\r\nseen near Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Eleven witnesses of good reputation\r\ngave evidence on oath before magistrates. One of these magistrates had\r\nhimself seen the creature, and corroborated the most important points\r\nof the evidence given by the eleven witnesses. The creature had the\r\nappearance of a serpent, dark brown in colour (some said mottled),\r\nwith white under the head and neck. Its length was estimated at from\r\n50 to 100 feet. The head was in shape like a serpent’s, but as large\r\nas a horse’s. No mane was noticed. Five of the witnesses deposed\r\nto protuberances on the back; four said the back was straight; the\r\nother two gave no opinion on this point. The magistrate who had seen\r\nthe animal considered the appearance of protuberances was due to the\r\nbendings of the body while in rapid motion.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, when the captain of the British frigate _Dædalus_ had\r\npublished an account of a similar animal seen by him and several of his\r\nofficers and crew, the Hon. Colonel T. H. Perkins, of Boston, who had\r\nseen the animal on the occasion just mentioned in 1817, gave an account\r\n(copied from a letter written in 1820) of what he had witnessed. It\r\nis needless to quote those points which correspond with what has\r\nbeen already stated. Colonel Perkins noticed “an appearance in the\r\nfront of the head like a single horn, about nine inches to a foot in\r\nlength, shaped like a marlinspike, which will presently be explained.\r\nI left the place,” he proceeds, “fully satisfied that the reports in\r\ncirculation, though differing in details, were essentially correct.”\r\nHe relates how a person named Mansfield, “one of the most respectable\r\ninhabitants of the town, who had been such an unbeliever in the\r\nexistence of this monster that he had not given himself the trouble to\r\ngo from his house to the harbour when the report was first made,” saw\r\nthe animal from a bank overlooking the harbour. Mr. Mansfield and his\r\nwife agreed in estimating the creature’s length at 100 feet. Several\r\ncrews of coasting vessels saw the animal, _in some instances within a\r\nfew yards_. “Captain Tappan,” proceeds Colonel Perkins, “a person well\r\nknown to me, saw him with his head above water two or three feet, at\r\ntimes moving with great rapidity, at others slowly. He also saw what\r\nexplained the appearance which I have described of a horn on the front\r\nof the head. This was doubtless what was observed by Captain Tappan to\r\nbe the tongue, thrown in an upright position from the mouth, and having\r\nthe appearance which I have given to it. One of the revenue cutters,\r\nwhilst in the neighbourhood of Cape Ann, had an excellent view of him\r\nat a few yards’ distance; he moved slowly, and upon the appearance of\r\nthe vessel sank and was seen no more.”\r\n\r\nFifteen years later, in May 1833, five British officers—Captain\r\nSullivan, Lieutenants Maclachlan and Malcolm of the Rifle Brigade,\r\nLieutenant Lyster of the Artillery, and Mr. Snee of the Ordnance—when\r\ncruising in a small yacht off Margaret’s Bay, not far from Halifax,\r\n“saw the head and neck of some denizen of the deep, precisely like\r\nthose of a common snake, in the act of swimming, the head so elevated\r\nand thrown forward by the curve of the neck as to enable us to see\r\nthe water under and beyond it.” They judged its length to exceed\r\n80 feet. “There could be no mistake nor delusion, and we were all\r\nperfectly satisfied that we had been favoured with a view of the ‘true\r\nand veritable sea-serpent,’ which had been generally considered to\r\nhave existed only in the brain of some Yankee skipper, and treated\r\nas a tale not entitled to belief.” Dowling, a man-of-war’s man they\r\nhad along with them, made the following unscientific but noteworthy\r\ncomment: “Well, I’ve sailed in all parts of the world, and have seen\r\nrum sights too in my time, but this is the queerest thing I ever\r\nsee.” “And surely,” adds Captain Sullivan, “Jack Dowling was right.”\r\nThe description of the animal agrees in all essential respects with\r\nprevious accounts, but the head was estimated at about six feet in\r\nlength—considerably larger, therefore, than a horse’s head.\r\n\r\nBut unquestionably the account of the sea-serpent which has commanded\r\nmost attention was that given by the captain, officers, and crew of\r\nthe British frigate _Dædalus_, Captain M’Quhæ, in 1848. The _Times_\r\npublished on October 9, 1848, a paragraph stating that the sea-serpent\r\nhad been seen by the captain and most of the officers and crew of this\r\nship, on her passage home from the East Indies. The Admiralty inquired\r\nat once into the truth of the statement, and the following is abridged\r\nfrom Captain M’Quhæ’s official reply, addressed to Admiral Sir W. H.\r\nGage.\r\n\r\n“Sir,—In reply to your letter, requiring information as to the truth\r\nof a statement published in the _Times_ newspaper, of a sea-serpent of\r\nextraordinary dimensions having been seen from the _Dædalus_, I have\r\nthe honour to inform you that at 5 p.m., August 6 last, in latitude 24°\r\n44´ S., longitude 9° 22´ E., the weather dark and cloudy, wind fresh\r\nfrom N.W., with long ocean swell from S.W., the ship on the port tack,\r\nheading N.E. by N., Mr. Sartoris, midshipman, reported to Lieutenant\r\nE. Drummond (with whom, and Mr. W. Barrett, the master, I was walking\r\nthe quarter-deck) something very unusual rapidly approaching the ship\r\nfrom before the beam. The object was seen to be an enormous serpent,\r\nwith head and shoulders kept about four feet constantly above the\r\nsurface of the sea, as nearly as we could judge; at least 60 feet of\r\nthe animal was on the surface, no part of which length was used, so\r\nfar as we could see, in propelling the animal either by vertical or\r\nhorizontal undulation. It passed quietly, _but so closely under our lee\r\nquarter that, had it been a man of my acquaintance, I should easily\r\nhave recognized his features with the naked eye_. It did not, while\r\nvisible, deviate from its course to the S.W., which it held on at the\r\npace of from 12 to 15 miles per hour, as if on some determined purpose.\r\nThe diameter of the serpent was from 15 to 16 inches behind the head,\r\nwhich was, without any doubt, that of a snake. Its colour was a dark\r\nbrown, with yellowish white about the throat. It did not once, while\r\nwithin the range of view from our glasses, sink below the surface. It\r\nhad no fins, but something like the mane of a horse, or rather a bunch\r\nof sea-weed, washed about its back. It was seen by the quarter-master,\r\nthe boatswain’s mate, and the man at the wheel, in addition to myself\r\nand the officers above-mentioned. I am having a drawing of the serpent\r\nmade from a sketch taken immediately after it was seen, which I hope to\r\nhave ready for my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty by to-morrow’s\r\npost.—Peter M’Quhæ, Captain.”\r\n\r\nThe drawing here mentioned was published in the _Illustrated London\r\nNews_ for October 28, 1848, being there described as made “under the\r\nsupervision of Captain M’Quhæ, and his approval of the authenticity of\r\nthe details as to position and form.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondence and controversy elicited by the statement of Captain\r\nM’Quhæ were exceedingly interesting. It is noteworthy, at the outset,\r\nthat few, perhaps none, who had read the original statement, suggested\r\nthe idea of illusion, while it need hardly perhaps be said that no one\r\nexpressed the slightest doubt as to the _bona fides_ of Captain M’Quhæ\r\nand his fellow-witnesses. These points deserve attention, because,\r\nin recent times, the subject of the sea-serpent has been frequently\r\nmentioned in public journals and elsewhere as though no accounts of\r\nthe creature had ever been given which had been entitled to credence.\r\nI proceed to summarise the correspondence which followed M’Quhæ’s\r\nannouncement. The full particulars will be found in Mr. Gosse’s\r\ninteresting work, the “Romance of Natural History,” where, however, as\r\nit seems to me, the full force of the evidence is a little weakened,\r\nfor all save naturalists, by the introduction of particulars not\r\nbearing directly on the questions at issue.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest communications was one from Mr. J. D. M. Stirling,\r\na gentleman who, during a long residence in Norway, had heard repeated\r\naccounts of the sea-serpent in Norwegian seas, and had himself seen a\r\nfish or reptile at a distance of a quarter of a mile, which, examined\r\nthrough a telescope, corresponded in appearance with the sea-serpent as\r\nusually described. This communication was chiefly interesting, however,\r\nas advancing the theory that the supposed sea-serpent is not a serpent\r\nat all, but a long-necked plesiosaurian. This idea had been advanced\r\nearlier, but without his knowledge, by Mr. E. Newman, the editor of\r\nthe _Zoologist_. Let us briefly inquire into the circumstances which\r\nsuggest the belief.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the usual account of the sea-serpent, we find one\r\nconstant feature, which seems entirely inconsistent with the belief\r\nthat the creature can be a serpent. The animal has always shown a\r\nlarge portion of its length, from 20 to 60 feet, above the surface\r\nof the water, and without any evident signs of undulation, either\r\nvertically or horizontally. Now, apart from all zoological evidence,\r\nour knowledge of physical laws will not permit us to believe that the\r\nportion thus visible above the surface was propelled by the undulations\r\nof a portion concealed below the surface, unless this latter portion\r\nlargely exceeded the former in bulk. A true fish does not swim for any\r\nlength of time with any but a very small portion of its body above\r\nwater; probably large eels never show even a head or fin above water\r\nfor more than a few seconds when not at rest. Cetaceans, owing to the\r\nlayers of blubber which float them up, remain often for a long time\r\nwith a portion of their bulk out of the water, and the larger sort\r\noften swim long distances with the head and fore-part out of water.\r\nBut, even then, the greater part of the creature’s bulk is under water,\r\nand the driving apparatus, the anterior fins and the mighty tail, are\r\nconstantly under water (when the animal is urging its way horizontally,\r\nbe it understood). A sea creature, in fact, whatever its nature, which\r\nkeeps any considerable volume of its body out of water constantly,\r\nwhile travelling a long distance, must of necessity have a much greater\r\nvolume all the time under water, and must have its propelling apparatus\r\nunder water. Moreover, if the propulsion is not effected by fins,\r\npaddles, a great flat tail, or these combined, but by the undulations\r\nof the animal’s own body, then the part out of water must of necessity\r\nbe affected by these undulations, unless it is very small in volume\r\nand length compared with the part under water. I assert both these\r\npoints as matters depending on physical laws, and without fear that the\r\nbest-informed zoologist can adduce any instances to the contrary. It\r\nis in fact physically impossible that such instances should exist.\r\n\r\nIt would not be saying too much to assert that if the so-called\r\nsea-serpent were really a serpent, its entire length must be nearer\r\n1000 than 100 feet. This, of course, is utterly incredible. We are,\r\ntherefore, forced to the belief that the creature is not a serpent.\r\nIf it were a long-necked reptile, with a concealed body much bulkier\r\nthan the neck, the requirements of floatation would be satisfied; if\r\nto that body there were attached powerful paddles, the requirements\r\nof propulsion would be satisfied. The theory, then, suggested, first\r\nby Mr. Newman, later but independently by Mr. Stirling, and advocated\r\nsince by several naturalists of repute, is simply that the so-called\r\nsea-serpent is a modern representative of the long-necked plesiosaurian\r\nreptile to which has been given the name of the _enaliosaurus_.\r\nCreatures of this kind prevailed in that era when what is called the\r\nlias was formed, a fossiliferous stratum belonging to the secondary or\r\nmesozoic rocks. They are not found in the later or tertiary rocks, and\r\nthereon an argument might be deduced against their possible existence\r\nin the present, or post-tertiary, period; but, as will presently be\r\nshown, this argument is far from being conclusive. The enaliosaurian\r\nreptiles were “extraordinary,” says Lyell, “for their number, size, and\r\nstructure.” Like the ichthyosauri, or fish-lizards, the enaliosauri\r\n(or serpent-turtles, as they might almost be called) were carnivorous,\r\ntheir skeletons often enclosing the fossilized remains of half-digested\r\nfishes. They had extremely long necks, with heads very small compared\r\nwith the body. They are supposed to have lived chiefly in narrow seas\r\nand estuaries, and to have breathed air like the modern whales and\r\nother aquatic mammals. Some of them were of formidable dimensions,\r\nthough none of the skeletons yet discovered indicate a length of more\r\nthan 35 feet. It is not, however, at all likely that the few skeletons\r\nknown indicate the full size attained by these creatures. Probably,\r\nindeed, we have the remains of only a few out of many species, and\r\nsome species existing in the mesozoic period may have as largely\r\nexceeded those whose skeletons have been found, as the boa-constrictor\r\nexceeds the common ringed snake. It is also altogether probable that\r\nin the struggle for existence during which the enaliosaurian reptiles\r\nhave become _almost_ extinct (according to the hypothesis we are\r\nconsidering), none but the largest and strongest had any chance, in\r\nwhich case the present representatives of the family would largely\r\nexceed in bulk their progenitors of the mesozoic period.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Times_ of November 2, 1848, under the signature\r\nF. G. S., pointed out how many of the external characters of the\r\ncreature seen from the _Dædalus_ corresponded with the belief that it\r\nwas a long-necked plesiosaurus. “Geologists,” he said, “are agreed in\r\nthe inference that the plesiosauri carried their necks, which must\r\nhave resembled the bodies of serpents, above the water, while their\r\npropulsion was effected by large paddles working beneath, the short but\r\nstout tail acting the part of a rudder.... In the letter and drawing\r\nof Captain M’Quhæ ... we have ... the short head, the serpent-like\r\nneck, carried several feet above the water. Even the bristly mane in\r\ncertain parts of the back, so unlike anything found in serpents, has\r\nits analogue in the iguana, to which animal the plesiosaurus has been\r\ncompared by some geologists. But I would most of all insist upon the\r\npeculiarity of the animal’s progression, which could only have been\r\neffected with the evenness and at the rate described by an apparatus of\r\nfins or paddles, not possessed by serpents, but existing in the highest\r\nperfection in the plesiosaurus.”\r\n\r\nAt this stage a very eminent naturalist entered the field—Professor\r\nOwen. He dwelt first on a certain characteristic of Captain M’Quhæ’s\r\nletter which no student of science could fail to notice—the definite\r\nstatement that the creature _was_ so and so, where a scientific\r\nobserver would simply have said that the creature presented such and\r\nsuch characteristics. “No sooner was the captain’s attention called to\r\nthe object,” says Professor Owen, “than ‘it was discovered to be an\r\nenormous serpent,’” though in reality the true nature of the creature\r\ncould not be determined even from the observations made during the\r\nwhole time that it remained visible. Taking, however, “the more certain\r\ncharacters,” the “head with a convex, moderately capacious cranium,\r\nshort, obtuse muzzle, gape not extending further than to beneath the\r\neye, which (the eye) is rather small, round, filling closely the\r\npalpebral aperture” (that is, the eyelids fit closely[25]); “colour and\r\nsurface as stated; nostrils indicated in the drawing by a crescentic\r\nmark at the end of the nose or muzzle. All these,” proceeds Owen,\r\n“are the characters of the head of a warm-blooded mammal, none of\r\nthem those of a cold-blooded reptile or fish. Body long, dark brown,\r\nnot undulating, without dorsal or other apparent fins, ‘but something\r\nlike the mane of a horse, or rather a bunch of sea-weed, washed about\r\nits back.’” He infers that the creature had hair, showing only where\r\nlongest on the back, and therefore that the animal was not a mammal\r\nof the whale species but rather a great seal. He then shows that the\r\nsea-elephant, or _Phoca proboscidea_, which attains the length of\r\nfrom 20 to 30 feet, was the most probable member of the seal family\r\nto be found about 300 miles from the western shore of the southern\r\nend of Africa, in latitude 24° 44´. Such a creature, accidentally\r\ncarried from its natural domain by a floating iceberg, would have\r\n(after its iceberg had melted) to urge its way steadily southwards,\r\nas the supposed sea-serpent was doing; and probably the creature\r\napproached the _Dædalus_ to scan her “capabilities as a resting-place,\r\nas it paddled its long, stiff body past the ship.” “In so doing it\r\nwould raise a head of the form and colour described and delineated\r\nby Captain M’Quhæ”—its head only, be it remarked, corresponding\r\nwith the captain’s description. The neck also would be of the right\r\ndiameter. The thick neck, passing into an inflexible trunk, the longer\r\nand coarser hair on the upper part of which would give rise to the\r\nidea “explained by the similes above cited” (of a mane or bunch of\r\nsea-weed), the paddles would be out of sight; and the long eddy and\r\nwake created by the propelling action of the tail would account for the\r\nidea of a long serpentine body, at least for this idea occurring to one\r\n“looking at the strange phenomenon with a sea-serpent in his mind’s\r\neye.” “It is very probable that not one on board the _Dædalus_ ever\r\nbefore beheld a gigantic seal freely swimming in the open ocean.” The\r\nexcitement produced by the strange spectacle, and the recollection of\r\n“old Pontoppidan’s sea-serpent with the mane,” would suffice, Professor\r\nOwen considered, to account for the metamorphosis of a sea-elephant\r\ninto a maned sea-serpent.\r\n\r\nThis was not the whole of Professor Owen’s argument; but it may be well\r\nto pause here, to consider the corrections immediately made by Captain\r\nM’Quhæ; it may be noticed, first, that Professor Owen’s argument\r\nseems sufficiently to dispose of the belief that the creature really\r\nwas a sea-serpent, or any cold-blooded reptile. And this view of the\r\nmatter has been confirmed by later observations. But few, I imagine,\r\ncan readily accept the belief that Captain M’Quhæ and his officers\r\nhad mistaken a sea-elephant for a creature such as they describe and\r\npicture. To begin with, although it might be probable enough that\r\nno one on board the _Dædalus_ had ever seen a gigantic seal freely\r\nswimming in the open ocean—a sight which Professor Owen himself had\r\ncertainly never seen—yet we can hardly suppose they would not have\r\nknown a sea-elephant under such circumstances. Even if they had never\r\nseen a sea-elephant at all, they would surely know what such an animal\r\nis like. No one could mistake a sea-elephant for any other living\r\ncreature, even though his acquaintance with the animal were limited to\r\nmuseum specimens or pictures in books. The supposition that the entire\r\nanimal, that is, its entire length, should be mistaken for 30 or 40\r\nfeet of the length of a serpentine neck, seems, in my judgment, as\r\nstartling as the ingenious theory thrown out by some naturalists when\r\nthey first heard of the giraffe—to the effect that some one of lively\r\nimagination had mistaken the entire body of a short-horned antelope for\r\nthe neck of a much larger animal!\r\n\r\nCaptain M’Quhæ immediately replied:—“I assert that neither was it\r\na common seal nor a sea-elephant; its great length and its totally\r\ndifferent physiognomy precluding the possibility of its being a _Phoca_\r\nof any species. The head was flat, and not a capacious vaulted cranium;\r\nnor had it a stiff, inflexible trunk—a conclusion to which Professor\r\nOwen has jumped, most certainly not justified by my simple statement,\r\nthat ‘no portion of the 60 feet seen by us was used in propelling it\r\nthrough the water, either by vertical or horizontal undulation.’”\r\nHe explained that the calculation of the creature’s length was made\r\nbefore, not after, the idea had been entertained that the animal was\r\na serpent, and that he and his officers were “too well accustomed\r\nto judge of lengths and breadths of objects in the sea to mistake a\r\nreal substance and an actual living body, coolly and dispassionately\r\ncontemplated, at so short a distance too, for the ‘eddy caused by\r\nthe action of the deeply immersed fins and tail of a rapidly moving,\r\ngigantic seal raising its head above the water,’ as Professor Owen\r\nimagines, in quest of its lost iceberg.” He next disposed of Owen’s\r\nassertion that the idea of clothing the serpent with a mane had been\r\nsuggested by old Pontoppidan’s story, simply because he had never seen\r\nPontoppidan’s account or heard of Pontoppidan’s sea-serpent, until\r\nhe had told his own tale in London. Finally, he added, “I deny the\r\nexistence of excitement, or the possibility of optical illusion. I\r\nadhere to the statement as to form, colour, and dimensions, contained\r\nin my report to the Admiralty.”\r\n\r\nA narrative which appeared in the _Times_ early in 1849 must be\r\nreferred to in this place, as not being readily explicable by Professor\r\nOwen’s hypothesis. It was written by Mr. R. Davidson, superintending\r\nsurgeon, Najpore Subsidiary Force Kamptee, and was to the following\r\neffect (I abridge it considerably):—When at a considerable distance\r\nsouth-west of the Cape of Good Hope, Mr. Davidson, Captain Petrie, of\r\nthe _Royal Saxon_, a steerage passenger, and the man at the wheel, saw\r\n“an animal of which no more correct description could be given than\r\nthat by Captain M’Quhæ. It passed within 35 yards of the ship, without\r\naltering its course in the least; but as it came right abreast of us it\r\nslowly turned its head towards us.” About one-third of the upper part\r\nof its body was above water, “in nearly its whole length; and we could\r\nsee the water curling up on its breast as it moved along, but by what\r\nmeans it moved we could not perceive.” They _saw this creature in its\r\nwhole length_ with the exception of a small portion of the tail which\r\nwas under water; and by comparing its length with that of the _Royal\r\nSaxon_, 600 feet, when exactly alongside in passing, they calculated it\r\nto be in length as well as in other dimensions greater than the animal\r\ndescribed by Captain M’Quhæ.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1852 two statements were made, one by Captain Steele, 9th\r\nLancers, the other by one of the officers of the ship _Barham_ (India\r\nmerchantman), to the effect that an animal of a serpentine appearance\r\nhad been seen about 500 yards from that ship (in longitude 40° E. and\r\n37° 16´ S., that is, east of the south-eastern corner of Africa). “We\r\nsaw him,” said the former, “about 16 or 20 feet out of the water, and\r\nhe _spouted_ a long way from his head”—that is, I suppose, he spouted\r\nto some distance, not, as the words really imply, at a part of his neck\r\nfar removed from the head. “Down his back he had a crest like a cock’s\r\ncomb, and was going very slowly through the water, but left a wake of\r\nabout 50 or 60 feet, as if dragging a long body after him. The captain\r\nput the ship off her course to run down to him, but as we approached\r\nhim he went down. His colour was green with light spots. He was seen by\r\nevery one on board.” The other witness gives a similar account, adding\r\nthat the creature kept moving his head up and down, and was surrounded\r\nby hundreds of birds. “We at first thought it was a dead whale....\r\nWhen we were within 100 yards he slowly sank into the depths of the\r\nsea; while we were at dinner he was seen again.” Mr. Alfred Newton,\r\nthe well-known naturalist, guarantees his personal acquaintance with\r\none of the recipients of the letters just quoted from. But such a\r\nguarantee is, of course, no sufficient guarantee of the authenticity\r\nof the narrative. Even if the narrative be accepted, the case seems a\r\nvery doubtful one. The birds form a suspicious element in the story.\r\nWhy should birds cluster around a living sea creature? It seems to\r\nme probable that the sea-weed theory, presently to be noticed, gives\r\nthe best explanation of this case. Possibly some great aggregation of\r\nsea-weed was there, in which were entangled divers objects desirable\r\nto birds and to fishes. These last may have dragged the mass under\r\nwater when the ship approached, being perhaps more or less entangled\r\nin it—and it floated up again afterwards. The spouting may have been\r\nsimply the play of water over the part mistaken for the head.\r\n\r\nThe sea-weed theory of the sea-serpent was broached in February, 1849,\r\nand supported by a narrative not unlike the last. When the British\r\nship _Brazilian_ was becalmed almost exactly in the spot where M’Quhæ\r\nhad seen his monster, Mr. Herriman, the commander, perceived something\r\nright abeam, about half a mile to the westward, “stretched along the\r\nwater to the length of about 25 or 30 feet, and perceptibly moving from\r\nthe ship with a steady, sinuous motion. The head, which seemed to be\r\nlifted several feet above the waters, had something resembling a mane,\r\nrunning down to the floating portion, and within about 6 feet of the\r\ntail it forked out into a sort of double fin.” Mr. Herriman, his first\r\nmate, Mr. Long, and several of the passengers, after surveying the\r\nobject for some time, came to the unanimous conclusion that it must be\r\nthe sea-serpent seen by Captain M’Quhæ. “As the _Brazilian_ was making\r\nno headway, Mr. Herriman, determining to bring all doubts to an issue,\r\nhad a boat lowered down, and taking two hands on board, together with\r\nMr. Boyd, of Peterhead, near Aberdeen, one of the passengers, who\r\nacted as steersman under the direction of the captain, they approached\r\nthe monster, Captain Herriman standing on the bow of the boat, armed\r\nwith a harpoon to commence the onslaught. The combat, however, was\r\nnot attended with the danger which those on board apprehended; for\r\non coming close to the object it was found to be nothing more than\r\nan immense piece of sea-weed, evidently detached from a coral reef\r\nand drifting with the current, which sets constantly to the westward\r\nin this latitude, and which, together with the swell left by the\r\nsubsidence of the gale, gave it the sinuous, snake-like motion.”\r\n\r\nA statement was published by Captain Harrington in the _Times_ of\r\nFebruary, 1858, to the effect that from his ship _Castilian_, then\r\ndistant ten miles from the north-east end of St. Helena, he and\r\nhis officers had seen a huge marine animal within 20 yards of the\r\nship; that it disappeared for about half a minute, and then made its\r\nappearance in the same manner again, showing distinctly its neck and\r\nhead about 10 or 12 feet out of the water. “Its head was shaped like\r\na long nun-buoy,” proceeds Captain Harrington, “and I suppose the\r\ndiameter to have been 7 or 8 feet in the largest part, with a kind of\r\nscroll, or tuft, of loose skin encircling it about 2 feet from the top;\r\nthe water was discoloured for several hundred feet from its head....\r\nFrom what we saw from the deck, we conclude that it must have been over\r\n200 feet long. The boatswain and several of the crew who observed it\r\nfrom the top-gallant forecastle,[26] (query, cross-trees?) state that\r\nit was more than double the length of the ship, in which case it must\r\nhave been 500 feet. Be that as it may, I am convinced that it belonged\r\nto the serpent tribe; it was of a dark colour about the head, and was\r\ncovered with several white spots.”\r\n\r\nThis immediately called out a statement from Captain F. Smith, of\r\nthe ship _Pekin_, that on December 28, not far from the place where\r\nthe _Dædalus_ had encountered the supposed sea-serpent, he had seen,\r\nat a distance of about half a mile, a creature which was declared by\r\nall hands to be the great sea-serpent, but proved eventually to be a\r\npiece of gigantic sea-weed. “I have no doubt,” he says, that the great\r\nsea-serpent seen from the _Dædalus_ “was a piece of the same weed.”\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that the sea-weed sea-serpents, seen by\r\nCaptain F. Smith and by Captain Herriman, were both at a distance\r\nof half a mile, at which distance one can readily understand that a\r\npiece of sea-weed might be mistaken for a living creature. This is\r\nrather different from the case of the _Dædalus_ sea-serpent, which\r\npassed so near that had it been a man of the captain’s acquaintance\r\nhe could have recognized that man’s features with the naked eye. The\r\ncase, too, of Captain Harrington’s sea-serpent, seen within 20 yards\r\nof the _Castilian_, can hardly be compared to those cases in which\r\nsea-weed, more than 800 yards from the ship, was mistaken for a living\r\nanimal. An officer of the _Dædalus_ thus disposed of Captain Smith’s\r\nimputation:—“The object seen from the ship was beyond all question a\r\nliving animal, moving rapidly through the water against a cross sea,\r\nand within five points of a fresh breeze, with such velocity that\r\nthe water was surging against its chest as it passed along at a rate\r\nprobably of ten miles per hour. Captain M’Quhæ’s first impulse was to\r\ntack in pursuit, but he reflected that we could neither lay up for it\r\nnor overhaul it in speed. There was nothing to be done, therefore, but\r\nto observe it as accurately as we could with our glasses as it came up\r\nunder our lee quarter and passed away to windward, being at its nearest\r\nposition not more than 200 yards from us; _the eye, the mouth, the\r\nnostril, the colour, and the form, all being most distinctly visible\r\nto us_.... My impression was that it was rather of a lizard than a\r\nserpentine character, as its movement was steady and uniform, _as if\r\npropelled by fins_, not by any undulatory power.”\r\n\r\nBut all the evidence heretofore obtained respecting the sea-serpent,\r\nalthough regarded by many naturalists, Gosse, Newman, Wilson, and\r\nothers, as demonstrating the existence of some as yet unclassified\r\nmonster of the deep, seems altogether indecisive by comparison with\r\nthat which has recently been given by the captain, mates, and crew\r\nof the ship _Pauline_. In this case, assuredly, we have not to deal\r\nwith a mass of sea-weed, the floating trunk of a tree, a sea-elephant\r\nhastening to his home amid the icebergs, or with any of the other more\r\nor less ingenious explanations of observations previously made. We have\r\neither the case of an actual living animal, monstrous, fierce, and\r\ncarnivorous, or else the five men who deposed on oath to the stated\r\nfacts devised the story between them, and wilfully perjured themselves\r\nfor no conceivable purpose—that, too, not as men have been known to\r\nperjure themselves under the belief that none could know of their\r\ninfamy, but with the certainty on the part of each that four others\r\n(any one of whom might one day shame him and the rest by confessing)\r\nknew the real facts of the case.\r\n\r\nThe story of the _Pauline_ sea-serpent ran simply as follows, as\r\nattested at the Liverpool police-court:—“We, the undersigned, captain,\r\nofficers, and crew of the bark _Pauline_, of London, do solemnly\r\nand sincerely declare, that on July 8, 1875, in latitude 5° 13´ S.,\r\nlongitude 35° W., we observed three large sperm whales, and one of\r\nthem was gripped round the body with two turns of what appeared to be\r\na huge serpent. The head and tail appeared to have a length beyond\r\nthe coils of about 30 feet, and its girth 8 or 9 feet. The serpent\r\nwhirled its victim round and round for about fifteen minutes, and then\r\nsuddenly dragged the whale to the bottom, head first.—George Drevat,\r\nmaster; Horatio Thompson, chief mate; John H. Landells, second mate;\r\nWilliam Lewarn, steward; Owen Baker, A.B. Again on the 13th July a\r\nsimilar serpent was seen about 200 yards off, shooting itself along the\r\nsurface, head and neck being out of the water several feet. This was\r\nseen only by the captain and an ordinary seaman.—George Drevat. A few\r\nmoments afterwards it was seen elevated some 60 feet perpendicularly\r\nin the air by the chief officer and two seamen, whose signatures are\r\naffixed.—Horatio Thompson, Owen Baker, William Lewarn.”\r\n\r\nThe usual length of the cachalot or sperm whale is about 70 feet, and\r\nits girth about 50 feet. If we assign to the unfortunate whale which\r\nwas captured on this occasion, a length of only 50 feet, and a girth\r\nof only 35 feet, we should still have for the entire length of the\r\nsupposed serpent about 100 feet. This can hardly exceed the truth,\r\nsince the three whales are called large sperm whales. With a length of\r\n100 feet and a girth of about 9 feet, however, a serpent would have\r\nno chance in an attempt to capture a sperm whale 50 feet long and 35\r\nfeet in girth, for the simple reason that the whale would be a good\r\ndeal heavier than its opponent. In a contest in open sea, where one\r\nanimal seeks to capture another bodily, weight is all-important. We\r\ncan hardly suppose the whale could be so compassed by the coils of his\r\nenemy as to be rendered powerless; in fact, the contest lasted fifteen\r\nminutes, during the whole of which time the so-called serpent was\r\nwhirling its victim round, though more massive than itself, through\r\nthe water. On the whole, it seems reasonable to conclude—in fact, the\r\nopinion is almost forced upon us—that besides the serpentine portion\r\nof its bulk, which was revealed to view, the creature, thus whirling\r\nround a large sperm whale, had a massive concealed body, provided with\r\npropelling paddles of enormous power. _These_ were at work all the time\r\nthe struggle went on, enabling the creature to whirl round its enemy\r\neasily, whereas a serpentine form, with two-thirds of its length, at\r\nleast, coiled close round another body, would have had no propulsive\r\npower left, or very little, in the remaining 30 feet of its length,\r\nincluding both the head and tail ends beyond the coils. Such a creature\r\nas an enaliosaurus _could_ no doubt have done what a serpent of twice\r\nthe supposed length would have attempted in vain—viz., dragged down\r\ninto the depths of the sea the mighty bulk of a cachalot whale.\r\n\r\nWhen all the evidence is carefully weighed, we appear led to the\r\nconclusion that at least one large marine animal exists which has not\r\nas yet been classified among the known species of the present era. It\r\nwould appear that this animal has certainly a serpentine neck, and a\r\nhead small compared with its body, but large compared with the diameter\r\nof the neck. It is probably an air-breather and warm-blooded, and\r\ncertainly carnivorous. Its propulsive power is great and apparently\r\nindependent of undulations of its body, wherefore it presumably\r\nhas powerful concealed paddles. All these circumstances correspond\r\nwith the belief that it is a modern representative of the long-neck\r\nplesiosaurians of the great secondary or mesozoic era, a member of that\r\nstrange family of animals whose figure has been compared to that which\r\nwould be formed by drawing a serpent through the body of a sea-turtle.\r\n\r\nAgainst this view sundry objections have been raised, which must now be\r\nbriefly considered.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Professor Owen pointed out that the sea-saurians\r\nof the secondary period have been replaced in the tertiary and present\r\nseas by the whales and allied races. No whales are found in the\r\nsecondary strata, no saurians in the tertiary. “It seems to me less\r\nprobable,” he says, “that no part of the carcase of such reptiles\r\nshould have ever been discovered in a recent unfossilized state, than\r\nthat men should have been deceived by a cursory view of a partly\r\nsubmerged and rapidly moving animal which might only be strange to\r\nthemselves. In other words, I regard the negative evidence from the\r\nutter absence of any of the recent remains of great sea-serpents,\r\nkrakens, or enaliosauria, as stronger against their actual existence,\r\nthan the positive statements which have hitherto weighed with the\r\npublic mind in favour of their existence. A larger body of evidence\r\nfrom eye-witnesses might be got together in proof of ghosts than of the\r\nsea-serpent.”\r\n\r\nTo this it has been replied that genera are now known to exist, as the\r\n_Chimæra_, the long-necked river tortoise, and the iguana, which are\r\nclosely related to forms which existed in the secondary era, while no\r\ntraces have been found of them in any of the intermediate or tertiary\r\nstrata. The chimæra is a case precisely analogous to the supposed case\r\nof the enaliosaurus, for the chimæra is but rarely seen, like the\r\nsupposed enaliosaurus, is found in the same and absent from the same\r\nfossiliferous strata. Agassiz is quoted in the _Zoologist_, page 2395,\r\nas saying that it would be in precise conformity with analogy that such\r\nan animal as the enaliosaurus should exist in the American seas, as\r\nhe had found numerous instances in which the fossil forms of the Old\r\nWorld were represented by living types in the New. In close conformity\r\nwith this opinion is a statement made by Captain the Hon. George Hope,\r\nthat when in the British ship _Fly_, in the Gulf of California, the\r\nsea being perfectly calm and transparent, he saw at the bottom a large\r\nmarine animal, with the head and general figure of an alligator, but\r\nthe neck much longer, and with four large paddles instead of legs.\r\nHere, then, unless this officer was altogether deceived, which seems\r\nquite unlikely under the circumstances, was a veritable enaliosaurus,\r\nthough of a far smaller species, probably, than the creature mistaken\r\nfor a sea-serpent.\r\n\r\nAs for the absence of remains, Mr. Darwin has pointed out that\r\nthe fossils we possess are but fragments accidentally preserved\r\nby favouring circumstances in an almost total wreck. We have many\r\ninstances of existent creatures, even such as would have a far better\r\nchance of floating after death, and so getting stranded where their\r\nbones might be found, which have left no trace of their existence. A\r\nwhale possessing two dorsal fins was said to have been seen by Smaltz,\r\na Sicilian naturalist; but the statement was rejected, until a shoal\r\nof these whales were seen by two eminent French zoologists, MM. Quoy\r\nand Gaimard. No carcase, skeleton, or bone of this whale has ever\r\nbeen discovered. For seventeen hours a ship, in which Mr. Gosse was\r\ntravelling to Jamaica, was surrounded by a species of whale never\r\nbefore noticed—30 feet long, black above and white beneath, with\r\nswimming paws white on the upper surface. Here, he says, was “a whale\r\nof large size, occurring in great numbers in the North Atlantic, which\r\non no other occasion has fallen under scientific observation. The\r\ntoothless whale of Havre, a species actually inhabiting the British\r\nChannel, is only known from a single specimen accidentally stranded on\r\nthe French coast; and another whale, also British, is known only from\r\na single specimen cast ashore on the Elgin roast, and there seen and\r\ndescribed by the naturalist Sowerby.\r\n\r\nDr. Andrew Wilson, in an interesting paper, in which he maintains that\r\nsea-serpent tales are not to be treated with derision, but are worthy\r\nof serious consideration, “supported as they are by zoological science,\r\nand in the actual details of the case by evidence as trustworthy in\r\nmany cases as that received in our courts of law,” expresses the\r\nopinion that plesiosauri and ichthyosauri have been unnecessarily\r\ndisinterred to do duty for the sea-serpents. But he offers as an\r\nalternative only the ribbon-fish; and though some of these may attain\r\nenormous dimensions, yet we have seen that some of the accounts of\r\nthe supposed sea-serpent, and especially the latest narrative by the\r\ncaptain and crew of the _Pauline_, cannot possibly be explained by any\r\ncreature so flat and relatively so feeble as the ribbon-fish.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it appears to me that a very strong case has been made\r\nout for the enaliosaurian, or serpent-turtle, theory of the so-called\r\nsea-serpent.\r\n\r\nOne of the ribbon-fish mentioned by Dr. Wilson, which was captured,\r\nand measured more than 60 feet in length, might however fairly take\r\nits place among strange sea creatures. I scarcely know whether to add\r\nto the number a monstrous animal like a tadpole, or even more perhaps\r\nlike a gigantic skate, 200 feet in length, said to have been seen in\r\nthe Malacca Straits by Captain Webster and Surgeon Anderson, of the\r\nship _Nestor_. Perhaps, indeed, this monster, mistaken in the first\r\ninstance for a shoal, but presently found to be travelling along at\r\nthe rate of about ten knots an hour, better deserves to be called\r\na strange sea creature even than any of those which have been dealt\r\nwith in the preceding pages. But the only account I have yet seen\r\nof Captain Webster’s statement, and Mr. Anderson’s corroboration,\r\nappeared in an American newspaper; and though the story is exceedingly\r\nwell authenticated if the newspaper account of the matter is true, it\r\nwould not be at all a new feature in American journalism if not only\r\nthe story itself, but all the alleged circumstances of its narration,\r\nshould in the long run prove to be pure invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ON SOME MARVELS IN TELEGRAPHY._\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years Electric Telegraphy has received some\r\ndevelopments which seem wonderful even by comparison with those other\r\nwonders which had before been achieved by this method of communication.\r\nIn reality, all the marvels of electric telegraphy are involved, so\r\nto speak, in the great marvel of electricity itself, a phenomenon\r\nas yet utterly beyond the interpretation of physicists, though not\r\nmore so than its fellow marvels, light and heat. We may, indeed,\r\ndraw a comparison between some of the most wonderful results which\r\nhave recently been achieved by the study of heat and light and those\r\neffected in the application of electricity to telegraphy. It is as\r\nstartling to those unfamiliar with the characteristics of light, or\r\nrather with certain peculiarities resulting from these characteristics,\r\nto be told that an astronomer can tell whether there is water in the\r\nair of Mars or Venus, or iron vapour in the atmosphere of Aldebaran\r\nor Betelgeux, as it is to those unfamiliar with the characteristics\r\nof electricity, or with the results obtained in consequence of these\r\ncharacteristics, to be told that a written message can be copied by\r\ntelegraph, a map or diagram reproduced, or, most wonderful of all,\r\na musical air correctly repeated, or a verbal message made verbally\r\naudible. Telegraphic marvels such as these bear to the original marvel\r\nof mere telegraphic communication, somewhat the same relation which\r\nthe marvels of spectroscopic analysis as applied to the celestial orbs\r\nbear to that older marvel, the telescopic scrutiny of those bodies. In\r\neach case, also, there lies at the back of all these marvels a greater\r\nmarvel yet—electricity in the one case, light in the other.\r\n\r\nI propose in this essay to sketch the principles on which some of the\r\nmore recent wonders of telegraphic communication depend. I do not\r\nintend to describe at any length the actual details or construction\r\nof the various instruments employed. Precisely as the principles of\r\nspectroscopic analysis can be made clear to the general reader without\r\nthe examination of the peculiarities of spectroscopic instruments,\r\nso can the methods and principles of telegraphic communication be\r\nunderstood without examining instrumental details. In fact, it may\r\nbe questioned whether general explanations are not in such cases\r\nmore useful than more detailed ones, seeing that these must of\r\nnecessity be insufficient for a student who requires to know the\r\nsubject practically in all its details, while they deter the general\r\nreader by technicalities in which he cannot be expected to take any\r\ninterest. If it be asked, whether I myself, who undertake to explain\r\nthe principles of certain methods of telegraphic communication, have\r\nexamined _practically_ the actual instrumental working of these\r\nmethods, I answer frankly that I have not done so. As some sort\r\nof proof, however, that without such practical familiarity with\r\nworking details the principles of the construction of instruments\r\nmay be thoroughly understood, I may remind the reader (see p. 96)\r\nthat the first spectroscopic battery I ever looked through—one in\r\nwhich the dispersive power before obtained in such instruments had\r\nbeen practically doubled—was of my own invention, constructed (with\r\na slight mechanical modification) by Mr. Browning, and applied at\r\nonce successfully to the study of the sun by Mr. Huggins, in whose\r\nobservatory I saw through this instrument the solar spectrum extended\r\nto a length which, could it all have been seen at once, would have\r\nequalled many feet.[27] On the other hand, it is possible to have a\r\nconsiderable practical experience of scientific instruments without\r\nsound knowledge of the principles of their construction; insomuch that\r\ninstances have been known in which men who have effected important\r\ndiscoveries by the use of some scientific instrument, have afterwards\r\nobtained their first clear conception of the principles of its\r\nconstruction from a popular description.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to consider, though briefly, some of the methods of\r\ncommunication which were employed before the electric telegraph was\r\ninvented. Some of the methods of electric telegraphy have their\r\nantitypes, so to speak, in methods of telegraphy used ages before the\r\napplication of electricity. The earliest employment of telegraphy\r\nwas probably in signalling the approach of invading armies by beacon\r\nfires. The use of this method must have been well known in the time\r\nof Jeremiah, since he warns the Benjamites “to set up a sign of fire\r\nin Beth-haccerem,” because “evil appeareth out of the north and great\r\ndestruction.” Later, instead of the simple beacon fire, combinations\r\nwere used. Thus, by an Act of the Scottish Parliament in 1455, the\r\nblazing of one bale indicated the probable approach of the English, two\r\nbales that they were coming indeed, and four bales blazing beside each\r\nother that they were in great force. The smoke of beacon fires served\r\nas signals by day, but not so effectively, except under very favourable\r\natmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\nTorches held in the hand, waved, depressed, and so forth, were\r\nanciently used in military signalling at night; while in the day-time\r\nboards of various figures in different positions indicated either\r\ndifferent messages or different letters, as might be pre-arranged.\r\n\r\nHooke communicated to the Royal Society in 1684 a paper describing a\r\nmethod of “communicating one’s mind at great distances.” The letters\r\nwere represented by various combinations of straight lines, which might\r\nbe agreed upon previously if secrecy were desired, otherwise the same\r\nforms might represent constantly the same letters. With four straight\r\nplanks any letter of this alphabet could be formed as wanted, and being\r\nthen run out on a framework (resembling a gallows in Hooke’s picture),\r\ncould be seen from a distant station. Two curved beams, combined in\r\nvarious ways, served for arbitrary signals.\r\n\r\nChappe, in 1793, devised an improvement on this in what was called\r\nthe T telegraph. An upright post supported a cross-bar (the top of\r\nthe T), at each end of which were the short dependent beams, making\r\nthe figure a complete Roman capital T. The horizontal bar as first\r\nused could be worked by ropes within the telegraph-house, so as to be\r\ninclined either to right or left. It thus had three positions. Each\r\ndependent beam could be worked (also from within the house) so as to\r\nturn upwards, horizontally, or downwards (regarding the top bar of\r\nthe T as horizontal), thus having also three positions. It is easily\r\nseen that, since each position of one short beam could be combined\r\nwith each position of the other, the two together would present\r\nthree times three arrangements, or nine in all; and as these nine\r\ncould be given with the cross-bar in any one of its three positions,\r\nthere were in all twenty-seven possible positions. M. Chappe used an\r\nalphabet of only sixteen letters, so that all messages could readily\r\nbe communicated by this telegraph. For shorter distances, indeed, and\r\nin all later uses of Chappe’s telegraph, the short beams could be\r\nused in intermediate positions, by which 256 different signals could\r\nbe formed. Such telegraphs were employed on a line beginning at the\r\nLouvre and proceeding by Montmartre to Lisle, by which communications\r\nwere conveyed from the Committee of Public Welfare to the armies in the\r\nLow Countries. Telescopes were used at each station. Barrère stated,\r\nin an address to the Convention on August 17, 1794, that the news of\r\nthe recapture of Lisle had been sent by this line of communication to\r\nParis in one hour after the French troops had entered that city. Thus\r\nthe message was conveyed at the rate of more than 120 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nVarious other devices were suggested and employed during the first half\r\nof the present century. The semaphores still used in railway signalling\r\nillustrate the general form which most of these methods assumed. An\r\nupright, with two arms, each capable of assuming six distinct positions\r\n(excluding the upright position), would give forty-eight different\r\nsignals; thus each would give six signals alone, or twelve for the\r\npair, and each of the six signals of one combined with each of the six\r\nsignals of the other, would give thirty-six signals, making forty-eight\r\nin all. This number suffices to express the letters of the alphabet\r\n(twenty-five only are needed), the Arabic numerals, and thirteen\r\narbitrary signals.\r\n\r\nThe progress of improvement in such methods of signalling promised to\r\nbe rapid, before the invention of the electric telegraph, or rather,\r\nbefore it was shown how the principle of the electric telegraph could\r\nbe put practically into operation. We have seen that they were capable\r\nof transmitting messages with considerable rapidity, more than twice\r\nas fast as we could now send a written message by express train. But\r\nthey were rough and imperfect. They were all, also, exposed to one\r\nserious defect. In thick weather they became useless. Sometimes, at the\r\nvery time when it was most important that messages should be quickly\r\ntransmitted, fog interrupted the signalling. Sir J. Barrow relates that\r\nduring the Peninsular War grave anxiety was occasioned for several\r\nhours by the interruption of a message from Plymouth, really intended\r\nto convey news of a victory. The words transmitted were, “Wellington\r\ndefeated;” the message of which these words formed the beginning was:\r\n“Wellington defeated the French at,” etc. As Barrow remarks, if the\r\nmessage had run, “French defeated at,” etc., the interruption of the\r\nmessage would have been of less consequence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the employment of electricity as a means of communicating\r\nat a distance was suggested before the end of the last century, in\r\nfact, so far back as 1774, the idea has only been worked out during\r\nthe last forty-two years. It is curious indeed to note that until\r\nthe middle of the present century the word “telegraph,” which is now\r\nalways understood as equivalent to electric telegraph, unless the\r\ncontrary is expressed, was commonly understood to refer to semaphore\r\nsignalling,[28] unless the word “electric” were added.\r\n\r\nThe general principle underlying all systems of telegraphic\r\ncommunication by electricity is very commonly misunderstood. The idea\r\nseems to prevail that electricity can be sent out along a wire to any\r\nplace where some suitable arrangement has been made to receive it. In\r\none sense this is correct. But the fact that the electricity has to\r\nmake a circuit, returning to the place from which it is transmitted,\r\nseems not generally understood. Yet, unless this is understood, the\r\nprinciple, even the possibility, of electric communication is not\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nLet us, at the outset, clearly understand the nature of electric\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nIn a variety of ways, a certain property called electricity can be\r\nexcited in all bodies, but more readily in some than in others. This\r\nproperty presents itself in two forms, which are called positive\r\nand negative electricity, words which we may conveniently use, but\r\nwhich must not be regarded as representing any real knowledge of\r\nthe distinction between these two kinds of electricity. In fact,\r\nlet it be remembered throughout, that we do not in the least know\r\nwhat electricity is; we only know certain of the phenomena which\r\nit produces. Any body which has become charged with electricity,\r\neither positive or negative, will part with its charge to bodies in a\r\nneutral condition, or charged with the opposite electricity (negative\r\nor positive). But the transference is made much more readily to\r\nsome substances than to others—so slowly, indeed, to some, that in\r\nordinary experiments the transference may be regarded as not taking\r\nplace at all. Substances of the former kind are called good conductors\r\nof electricity; those which receive the transfer of electricity less\r\nreadily are said to be bad conductors; and those which scarcely receive\r\nit at all are called insulating substances. The reader must not\r\nconfound the quality I am here speaking of with readiness to become\r\ncharged with electricity. On the contrary, the bodies which most\r\nfreely receive and transmit electricity are least readily charged with\r\nelectricity, while insulating substances are readily electrified. Glass\r\nis an insulator, but if glass is briskly rubbed with silk it becomes\r\ncharged (or rather, the part rubbed becomes charged) with positive\r\nelectricity, formerly called _vitreous_ electricity for this reason;\r\nand again, if wax or resin, which are both good insulators, be rubbed\r\nwith cloth or flannel, the part rubbed becomes charged with negative,\r\nformerly called _resinous_, electricity.\r\n\r\nElectricity, then, positive or negative, however generated, passes\r\nfreely along conducting substances, but is stopped by an insulating\r\nbody, just as light passes through transparent substances, but is\r\nstopped by an opaque body. Moreover, electricity may be made to pass\r\nto any distance along conducting bodies suitably insulated. Thus, it\r\nmight seem that we have here the problem of distant communication\r\nsolved. In fact, the first suggestion of the use of electricity in\r\ntelegraphy was based on this property. When a charge of electricity has\r\nbeen obtained by the use of an ordinary electrical machine, this charge\r\ncan be drawn off at a distant point, if a conducting channel properly\r\ninsulated connects that point with the bodies (of whatever nature)\r\nwhich have been charged with electricity. In 1747, Dr. Watson exhibited\r\nelectrical effects from the discharges of Leyden jars (vessels\r\nsuitably constructed to receive and retain electricity) at a distance\r\nof two miles from the electrical machine. In 1774, Le Sage proposed\r\nthat by means of wires the electricity developed by an electrical\r\nmachine should be transmitted by insulated wires to a point where an\r\nelectroscope, or instrument for indicating the presence of electricity,\r\nshould, by its movements, mark the letters of the alphabet, one wire\r\nbeing provided for each letter. In 1798 Béthencourt repeated Watson’s\r\nexperiment, increasing the distance to twenty-seven miles, the\r\nextremities of his line of communication being at Madrid and Aranjuez.\r\n(Guillemin, by the way, in his “Applications of the Physical Forces,”\r\npasses over Watson’s experiment; in fact, throughout his chapters on\r\nthe electric telegraph, the steam-engine, and other subjects, he seems\r\ndesirous of conveying as far as possible the impression that all the\r\ngreat advances of modern science had their origin in Paris and its\r\nneighbourhood.)\r\n\r\nFrom Watson’s time until 1823 attempts were made in this country\r\nand on the Continent to make the electrical machine serve as the\r\nmeans of telegraphic communication. All the familiar phenomena of\r\nthe lecture-room have been suggested as signals. The motion of pith\r\nballs, the electric spark, the perforation of paper by the spark, the\r\ndischarge of sparks on a fulminating pane (a glass sheet on which\r\npieces of tinfoil are suitably arranged, so that sparks passing from\r\none to another form various figures or devices), and other phenomena,\r\nwere proposed and employed experimentally. But practically these\r\nmethods were not effectual. The familiar phenomenon of the electric\r\nspark explains the cause of failure. The spark indicates the passage of\r\nelectricity across an insulating medium—dry air—when a good conductor\r\napproaches within a certain distance of the charged body. The greater\r\nthe charge of electricity, the greater is the distance over which the\r\nelectricity will thus make its escape. Insulation, then, for many miles\r\nof wire, and still more for a complete system of communication such\r\nas we now have, was hopeless, so long as frictional electricity was\r\nemployed, or considerable electrical intensity required.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider how galvanic electricity, discovered in 1790,\r\nwas rendered available for telegraphic communication. In the first\r\nplace, let us consider what galvanic or voltaic electricity is.\r\n\r\nI have said that electricity can be generated in many ways. It may\r\nbe said, indeed, that every change in the condition of a substance,\r\nwhether from mechanical causes, as, for instance, a blow, a series of\r\nsmall blows, friction, and so forth, or from change of temperature,\r\nmoisture, and the like, or from the action of light, or from chemical\r\nprocesses, results in the development of more or less electricity.\r\n\r\nWhen a plate of metal is placed in a vessel containing some acid\r\n(diluted) which acts chemically on the metal, this action generates\r\nnegative electricity, which passes away as it is generated. But if a\r\nplate of a different metal, either not chemically affected by the acid\r\nor less affected than the former, be placed in the dilute acid, the two\r\nplates being only partially immersed and not in contact, then, when a\r\nwire is carried from one plate to the other, the excess of positive\r\nelectricity in the plate least affected by the acid is conveyed to\r\nthe other, or, in effect, discharged; the chemical action, however,\r\ncontinues, or rather is markedly increased, fresh electricity is\r\ngenerated, and the excess of positive electricity in the plate least\r\naffected is constantly discharged. Thus, along the wire connecting\r\nthe two metals a current of electricity passes from the metal least\r\naffected to the metal most affected; a current of negative electricity\r\npasses in a contrary direction in the dilute acid.\r\n\r\nI have spoken here of currents passing along the wire and in the acid,\r\nand shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the plate of metal least\r\naffected as the positive pole, this plate being regarded, in this\r\ncase, as a source whence a current of positive electricity flows along\r\nthe wire connection to the other plate, which is called the negative\r\npole. But I must remind the reader that this is only a convenient\r\nway of expressing the fact that the wire assumes a certain condition\r\nwhen it connects two such plates, and is capable of producing certain\r\neffects. Whether in reality any process is taking place which can be\r\njustly compared to the flow of a current one way or the other, or\r\nwhether a negative current flows along the circuit one way, while the\r\npositive current flows the other way, are questions still unanswered.\r\nWe need not here enter into them, however. In fact, very little is\r\nknown about these points. Nor need we consider here the various ways in\r\nwhich many pairs of plates such as I have described can be combined in\r\nmany vessels of dilute acid to strengthen the current. Let it simply\r\nbe noted that such a combination is called a battery; that when the\r\nextreme plates of opposite kinds are connected by a wire, a current\r\nof electricity passes along the wire from the extreme plate of that\r\nmetal which is least affected, forming the positive pole, to the other\r\nextreme plate of that metal which is most affected and forms the\r\nnegative pole. The metals commonly employed are zinc and copper, the\r\nformer being the one most affected by the action of the dilute acid,\r\nusually sulphuric acid. But it must here be mentioned that the chemical\r\nprocess, affecting both metals, but one chiefly, would soon render a\r\nbattery of the kind described useless; wherefore arrangements are made\r\nin various ways for maintaining the efficiency of the dilute acid and\r\nof the metallic plates, especially the copper: for the action of the\r\nacid on the zinc tends, otherwise, to form on the copper a deposit of\r\nzinc. I need not describe the various arrangements for forming what are\r\ncalled constant batteries, as Daniell’s, Grove’s, Bunsen’s, and others.\r\nLet it be understood that, instead of a current which would rapidly\r\ngrow weaker and weaker, these batteries give a steady current for a\r\nconsiderable time. Without this, as will presently be seen, telegraphic\r\ncommunication would be impossible.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, in a galvanic battery a steady source of electricity.\r\nThis electricity is of low intensity, incompetent to produce the more\r\nstriking phenomena of frictional electricity. Let us, however, consider\r\nhow it would operate at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe current will pass along any length of conducting substance properly\r\ninsulated. Suppose, then, an insulated wire passes from the positive\r\npole of a battery at a station A to a station B, and thence back to the\r\nnegative pole at the station A. Then the current passes along it, and\r\nthis can be indicated at B by some action such as electricity of low\r\nintensity can produce. If now the continuity of the wire be interrupted\r\nclose by the positive pole at A, the current ceases and the action is\r\nno longer produced. The observer at B knows then that the continuity of\r\nthe wire has been interrupted; he has been, in fact, signalled to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, the electrical phenomena which can be produced by\r\nthe current along a wire connecting the positive and negative poles\r\nof a galvanic battery are not striking. They do not afford effective\r\nsignals when the distance traversed is very great and the battery not\r\nexceptionally strong. Thus, at first, galvanic electricity was not more\r\nsuccessful in practice than frictional electricity.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the effect of the galvanic current on the magnetic\r\nneedle had been discovered that electricity became practically\r\navailable in telegraphy.\r\n\r\nOersted discovered in 1820 that a magnetic needle poised horizontally\r\nis deflected when the galvanic current passes above it (parallel to\r\nthe needle’s length) or below it. If the current passes above it, the\r\nnorth end of the needle turns towards the east when the current travels\r\nfrom north to south, but towards the west when the current travels from\r\nsouth to north; on the other hand, if the current passes below the\r\nneedle, the north end turns towards the west when the current travels\r\nfrom south to north, and towards the east when the current travels from\r\nnorth to south. The deflection will be greater or less according to the\r\npower of the current. It would be very slight indeed in the case of a\r\nneedle, however delicately poised, above or below which passed a wire\r\nconveying a galvanic current from a distant station. But the effect can\r\nbe intensified, as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nSuppose _a b c d e f_ to be a part of the wire from A to B, passing\r\nabove a delicately poised magnetic needle N S, along _a b_ and then\r\nbelow the needle along _c d_, and then above again along _e f_ and so\r\nto the station B. Let a current traverse the wire in the direction\r\nshown by the arrows. Then N, the north end of the needle, is deflected\r\ntowards the east by the current passing along _a b_. But it is also\r\ndeflected to the east by the current passing along _c d_; for this\r\nproduces a deflection the reverse of that which would be produced by a\r\ncurrent in the same direction above the needle—that is, in direction\r\n_b a_, and therefore the same as that produced by the current along\r\n_a b_. The current along _e f_ also, of course, produces a deflection\r\nof the end N towards the east. All three parts, then, _a b_, _c d_,\r\n_e f_, conspire to increase the deflection of the end N towards the\r\neast. If the wire were twisted once again round N S, the deflection\r\nwould be further increased; and finally, if the wire be coiled in the\r\nway shown in Fig. 1, but with a great number of coils, the deflection\r\nof the north end towards the east, almost imperceptible without such\r\ncoils, will become sufficiently obvious. If the direction of the\r\ncurrent be changed, the end N will be correspondingly deflected towards\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nThe needle need not be suspended horizontally. If it hang vertically,\r\nthat is, turn freely on a horizontal axis, and the coil be carried\r\nround it as above described, the deflection of the upper end will be to\r\nthe right or to the left, according to the direction of the current.\r\nThe needle actually seen, moreover, is not the one acted upon by the\r\ncurrent. This needle is inside the coil; the needle seen turns on the\r\nsame axis, which projects through the coil.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the observer at the station B have a magnetic needle suitably\r\nsuspended, round which the wire from the battery at A has been coiled,\r\nhe can tell by the movement of the needle whether a current is passing\r\nalong the wire in one direction or in the other; while if the needle is\r\nat rest he knows that no current is passing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nNow suppose that P and N, Fig. 2, are the positive and negative poles\r\nof a galvanic battery at A, and that a wire passes from P to the\r\nstation B, where it is coiled round a needle suspended vertically\r\nat _n_, and thence passes to the negative pole N. Let the wire be\r\ninterrupted at _a b_ and also at _c d_. Then no current passes along\r\nthe wire, and the needle _n_ remains at rest in a vertical position.\r\nNow suppose the points _a b_ connected by the wire _a b_, and at the\r\nsame moment the points _c d_ connected by the wire _c d_, then a\r\ncurrent flows along P _a b_ to B, as shown in Fig. 2, circuiting the\r\ncoil round the needle _n_ and returning by _d c_ to N. The upper end\r\nof the needle is deflected to the right while this current continues\r\nto flow; returning to rest when the connection is broken at _a b_\r\nand _c d_. Next, let _c b_ and _a d_ be simultaneously connected as\r\nshown by the cross-lines in Fig. 3. (It will be understood that _a d_\r\nand _b c_ do not touch each other where they cross.) The current will\r\nnow flow from P along _a d_ to B, circuiting round the needle _n_ in\r\na contrary direction to that in which it flowed in the former case,\r\nreturning by _b c_ to N. The upper end of the needle is deflected then\r\nto the left while the current continues to flow along this course.\r\n\r\nI need not here describe the mechanical devices by which the connection\r\nat _a b_ and _c d_ can be instantly changed so that the current may\r\nflow either along _a b_ and _d c_, as in Fig. 2, circuiting the needle\r\nin one direction, or along _a d_ and _b c_, as in Fig. 3, circuiting\r\nthe needle in the other direction. As I said at the outset, this paper\r\nis not intended to deal with details of construction, only to describe\r\nthe general principles of telegraphic communication, and especially\r\nthose points which have to be explained in order that recent inventions\r\nmay be understood. The reader will see that nothing can be easier than\r\nso to arrange matters that, by turning a handle, either (1), _a b_ and\r\n_c d_ may be connected, or, (2), _a d_ and _c b_, or, (3), both lines\r\nof communication interrupted. The mechanism for effecting this is\r\ncalled a _commutator_.\r\n\r\nTwo points remain, however, to be explained: First, A must be a\r\nreceiving station as well as a transmitting station; secondly, the\r\nwire connecting B with N, in Figs. 2 and 3, can be dispensed with, for\r\nit is found that if at B the wire is carried down to a large metal\r\nplate placed some depth underground, while the wire at _c_ is carried\r\ndown to another plate similarly buried underground, the circuit is\r\ncompleted even better than along such a return wire as is shown in the\r\nfigures. The earth either acts the part of a return wire, or else,\r\nby continually carrying off the electricity, allows the current to\r\nflow continuously along the single wire. We may compare the current\r\ncarried along the complete wire circuit, to water circulating in a pipe\r\nextending continuously from a reservoir to a distance and back again to\r\nthe reservoir. Water sucked up continuously at one end could be carried\r\nthrough the pipe so long as it was continuously returned to the\r\nreservoir at the other; but it could equally be carried through a pipe\r\nextending from that reservoir to some place where it could communicate\r\nwith the open sea—the reservoir itself communicating with the open\r\nsea—an arrangement corresponding to that by which the return wire is\r\ndispensed with, and the current from the wire received into the earth.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that the return wire may be dispensed with was made by\r\nSteinheil in 1837.\r\n\r\nThe actual arrangement, then, is in essentials that represented in Fig.\r\n4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nA and B are the two stations; P N is the battery at A, P´ N´ the\r\nbattery at B; P´ P´ are the positive poles, N´ N´, the negative poles.\r\nAt _n_ is the needle of station A, at _n´_ the needle of station B.\r\nWhen the handle of the commutator is in its mean position—which is\r\nsupposed to be the case at station B—the points _b´ d´_ are connected\r\nwith each other, but neither with _a´_ nor _c´_; no current, then,\r\npasses from B to A, but station B is in a condition to receive\r\nmessages. (If _b´_ and _d´_ were not connected, of course no messages\r\ncould be received, since the current from A would be stopped at\r\n_b´_—which does not mean that it would pass round _n´_ to _b´_, but\r\nthat, the passage being stopped at _b´_, the current would not flow at\r\nall.) When (the commutator at B being in its mean position, or _d´ b´_\r\nconnected, and communication with _c´_ and _a´_ interrupted) the handle\r\nof the commutator at A is turned from its mean position in _one_\r\ndirection, _a_ and _b_ are connected, as are _c_ and _d_—as shown in\r\nthe figure—while the connection between _b_ and _d_ is broken. Thus\r\nthe current passes from P by _a_ and _b_, round the needle _n_; thence\r\nto station B, round needle _n´_, and by _b´_ and _d´_, to the earth\r\nplate G´; and so along the earth to G, and by _d c_, to the negative\r\npole N. The upper end of the needle of both stations is deflected to\r\nthe right by the passage of the current in this direction. When the\r\nhandle of the commutator at A is turned in the other direction, _b_ and\r\n_c_ are connected, as also _a_ and _d_; the current from P passes along\r\n_a d_ to the ground plate G, thence to G´, along _d´ b´_, round the\r\nneedle _n´_, back by the wire to the station A, where, after circuiting\r\nthe needle _n_ in the same direction as the needle _n´_, it travels by\r\n_b_ and _c_ to the negative pole N. The upper end of the needle, at\r\nboth stations, is deflected to the left by the passage of the current\r\nin this direction.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen that, with two wires and one battery, two needles\r\ncan be worked at both stations, either one moving alone, or the other\r\nalone, or both together; but for the two to move differently, two\r\nbatteries must be used. The systems by which either the movements of\r\na single needle, or of a pair of needles, may be made to indicate the\r\nvarious letters of the alphabet, numerals, and so on, need not here be\r\ndescribed. They are of course altogether arbitrary, except only that\r\nthe more frequent occurrence of certain letters, as _e_, _t_, _a_,\r\nrenders it desirable that these should be represented by the simplest\r\nsymbols (as by a single deflection to right or left), while letters\r\nwhich occur seldom may require several deflections.\r\n\r\nOne of the inventions to which the title of this paper relates can now\r\nbe understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement described, when a message is transmitted, the\r\nneedle of the sender vibrates synchronously with the needle at the\r\nstation to which the message is sent. Therefore, till that message is\r\nfinished, none can be received at the transmitting station. In what\r\nis called duplex telegraphy, this state of things is altered, the\r\nneedle at the sending station being left unaffected by the transmitted\r\ncurrent, so as to be able to receive messages, and in self-recording\r\nsystems to record them. This is done by dividing the current from the\r\nbattery into two parts of equal efficiency, acting on the needle at\r\nthe transmitting station in contrary directions, so that this needle\r\nremains unaffected, and ready to indicate signals from the distant\r\nstation. The principle of this arrangement is indicated in Fig. 5. Here\r\n_a b n_ represents the main wire of communication with the distant\r\nstation, coiled round the needle of the transmitting station in one\r\ndirection; the dotted lines indicate a finer short wire, coiled round\r\nthe needle in a contrary direction. When a message is transmitted,\r\nthe current along the main wire tends to deflect the needle at _n_ in\r\none direction, while the current along the auxiliary wire tends to\r\ndeflect it in the other direction. If the thickness and length of the\r\nshort wire are such as to make these two tendencies equal, the needle\r\nremains at rest, while a message is transmitted to the distant station\r\nalong the main wire. In this state of things, if a current is sent\r\nfrom the distant station along the wire in the direction indicated by\r\nthe dotted arrow, this current also circuits the auxiliary wire, but\r\nin the direction indicated by the arrows on the dotted curve, which\r\nis the same direction in which it circuits the main wire. Thus the\r\nneedle is deflected, and a signal received. When the direction of the\r\nchief current at the transmitting station is reversed, so also is\r\nthe direction of the artificial current, so that again the needle is\r\nbalanced. Similarly, if the direction of the current from the distant\r\nstation is reversed, so also is the direction in which this current\r\ntraverses the auxiliary wire, so that again both effects conspire to\r\ndeflect the needle.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another way in which an auxiliary wire may be made\r\nto work. It may be so arranged that, when a message is transmitted,\r\nthe divided current flowing equally in opposite directions, the\r\ninstrument at the sending station is not affected; but that when the\r\noperator at the distant station sends a current along the main wire,\r\nthis neutralizes the current coming towards him, which current had\r\nbefore balanced the artificial current. The latter, being no longer\r\ncounterbalanced, deflects the needle; so that, in point of fact, by\r\nthis arrangement, the signal received at a station is produced by the\r\nartificial current at that station, though of course the real cause of\r\nthe signal is the transmission of the neutralizing current from the\r\ndistant station.\r\n\r\nThe great value of duplex telegraphy is manifest. Not only can\r\nmessages be sent simultaneously in both directions along the wire—a\r\ncircumstance which of itself would double the work which the wire is\r\ncapable of doing—but all loss of time in arranging about the order\r\nof outward and homeward messages is prevented. The saving of time is\r\nespecially important on long lines, and in submarine telegraphy. It is\r\nalso here that the chief difficulties of duplex telegraphy have been\r\nencountered. The chief current and the artificial current must exactly\r\nbalance each other. For this purpose the flow along each must be\r\nequal. In passing through the long wire, the current has to encounter\r\na greater resistance than in traversing the short wire; to compensate\r\nfor this difference, the short wire must be much finer than the long\r\none. The longer the main wire, the more delicate is the task of\r\neffecting an exact balance. But in the case of submarine wires, another\r\nand a much more serious difficulty has to be overcome. A land wire\r\nis well insulated. A submarine wire is separated by but a relatively\r\nmoderate thickness of gutta-percha from water, an excellent conductor,\r\ncommunicating directly with the earth, and is, moreover, surrounded by\r\na protecting sheathing of iron wires, laid spirally round the core,\r\nwithin which lies the copper conductor. Such a cable, as Faraday long\r\nsince showed, acts precisely as an enormous Leyden jar; or rather,\r\nFaraday showed that such a cable, without the wire sheathing, would\r\nact when submerged as a Leyden jar, the conducting wire acting as\r\nthe interior metallic coating of such a jar, the gutta-percha as the\r\nglass of the jar (the insulating medium), and the water acting as the\r\nexterior metallic coating. Wheatstone showed further that such a cable,\r\nwith a wire sheathing, would act as a Leyden jar, even though not\r\nsubmerged, the metal sheathing taking the part of the exterior coating\r\nof the jar. Now, regarding the cable thus as a condenser, we see that\r\nthe transmission of a current along it may in effect be compared with\r\nthe passage of a fluid along a pipe of considerable capacity, into\r\nwhich and from which it is conveyed by pipes of small capacity. There\r\nwill be a retardation of the flow of water corresponding to the time\r\nnecessary to fill up the large part of the pipe; the water may indeed\r\nbegin to flow through as quickly as though there were no enlargement of\r\nthe bore of the pipe, but the full flow from the further end will be\r\ndelayed. Just so it is with a current transmitted through a submarine\r\ncable. The current travels instantly (or with the velocity of freest\r\nelectrical transmission) along the entire line; but it does not attain\r\na sufficient intensity to be recognized for some time, nor its full\r\nintensity till a still longer interval has elapsed. The more delicate\r\nthe means of recognizing its flow, the more quickly is the signal\r\nreceived. The time intervals in question are not, indeed, very great.\r\nWith Thomson’s mirror galvanometer, in which the slightest motion of\r\nthe needle is indicated by a beam of light (reflected from a small\r\nmirror moving with the needle), the Atlantic cable conveys its signal\r\nfrom Valentia to Newfoundland in about one second, while with the less\r\nsensitive galvanometer before used the time would be rather more than\r\ntwo seconds.\r\n\r\nNow, in duplex telegraphy the artificial current must be equal to the\r\nchief current in intensity all the time; so that, since in submarine\r\ntelegraphy the current rises gradually to its full strength and as\r\ngradually subsides, the artificial current must do the same. Reverting\r\nto the illustration derived from the flow of water, if we had a small\r\npipe the rapid flow through which was to carry as much water one way as\r\nthe slow flow through a large pipe was to carry water the other way,\r\nthen if the large pipe had a widening along one part of its long course\r\nthe short pipe would require to have a similar widening along the\r\ncorresponding part of its short course. And to make the illustration\r\nperfect, the widenings along the large pipe should be unequal in\r\ndifferent parts of the pipe’s length; for the capacity of a submarine\r\ncable, regarded as a condenser, is different along different parts of\r\nits length. What is wanted, then, for a satisfactory system of duplex\r\ntelegraphy in the case of submarine cables, is an artificial circuit\r\nwhich shall not only correspond as a whole to the long circuit, but\r\nshall reproduce at the corresponding parts of its own length all the\r\nvarieties of capacity existing along various parts of the length of the\r\nsubmarine cable.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made by electricians to accomplish this\r\nresult. Let it be noticed that two points have to be considered: the\r\nintensity of the current’s action, which depends on the resistance\r\nit has to overcome in traversing the circuit; and the velocity of\r\ntransmission, depending on the capacity of various parts of the circuit\r\nto condense or collect electricity. Varley, Stearn, and others have\r\nendeavoured by various combinations of condensers with resistance coils\r\nto meet these two requisites. But the action of artificial circuits\r\nthus arranged was not sufficiently uniform. Recently Mr. J. Muirhead,\r\njun., has met the difficulty in the following way (I follow partially\r\nthe account given in the _Times_ of February 3, 1877, which the reader\r\nwill now have no difficulty in understanding):—He has formed his\r\nsecond circuit by sheets of paper prepared with paraffin, and having\r\nupon one side a strip of tinfoil, wound to and fro to represent\r\nresistance. Through this the artificial current is conducted. On the\r\nother side is a sheet of tinfoil to represent the sheathing,[29] and\r\nto correspond to the capacity of the wire. Each sheet of paper thus\r\nprepared may be made to represent precisely a given length of cable,\r\nhaving enough tinfoil on one side to furnish the resistance, and on the\r\nother to furnish the capacity. A sufficient number of such sheets would\r\nexactly represent the cable, and thus the artificial or non-signalling\r\npart of the current would be precisely equivalent to the signalling\r\npart, so far as its action on the needle at the transmitting station\r\nwas concerned. “The new plan was first tried on a working scale,” says\r\nthe _Times_, “on the line between Marseilles and Bona; but it has\r\nsince been brought into operation from Marseilles to Malta, from Suez\r\nto Aden, and lastly, from Aden to Bombay. On a recent occasion when\r\nthere was a break-down upon the Indo-European line, the duplex system\r\nrendered essential service, and maintained telegraphic communication\r\nwhich would otherwise have been most seriously interfered with.” The\r\ninvention, we may well believe, “cannot fail to be highly profitable to\r\nthe proprietors of submarine cables,” or to bring about “before long a\r\nmaterial reduction in the cost of messages from places beyond the seas.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next marvel of telegraphy to be described is the transmission\r\nof actual facsimiles of writings or drawings. So far as strict\r\nsequence of subject-matter is concerned, I ought, perhaps, at this\r\npoint, to show how duplex telegraphy has been surpassed by a recent\r\ninvention, enabling three or four or more messages to be simultaneously\r\ntransmitted telegraphically. But it will be more convenient to consider\r\nthis wonderful advance after I have described the methods by which\r\nfacsimiles of handwriting, etc., are transmitted.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered the action of the electric current\r\nin deflecting a magnetic needle to right or left, a method of\r\ncommunication leaving no trace of its transmission. We have now to\r\nconsider a method at once simpler in principle and affording means\r\nwhereby a permanent record can be left of each message transmitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nIf the insulated wire is twisted in the form of a helix or coil round\r\na bar of soft iron, the bar becomes magnetized while the current is\r\npassing. If the bar be bent into the horse-shoe form, as in Fig. 6,\r\nwhere A C B represents the bar, _a b c d e f_ the coil of insulated\r\nwire, the bar acts as a magnet while the current is passing along the\r\ncoil, but ceases to do so as soon as the current is interrupted.[30]\r\nIf, then, we have a telegraphic wire from a distant station in electric\r\nconnection with the wire _a b c_, the part _e f_ descending to an\r\nearth-plate, then, according as the operator at that distant station\r\ntransmits or stops the current, the iron A C B is magnetized or\r\ndemagnetized. The part C is commonly replaced by a flat piece of iron,\r\nas is supposed to be the case with the temporary magnets shown in Fig.\r\n7, where this flat piece is below the coils.\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1838 this property was applied by Morse in America\r\nin the recording instrument which bears his name, and is now (with\r\nslight modifications) in general use not only in America but on the\r\nContinent. The principle of this instrument is exceedingly simple. Its\r\nessential parts are shown in Fig. 7; H is the handle, H _b_ the lever\r\nof the manipulator at the station A. The manipulator is shown in the\r\nposition for receiving a message from the station B along the wire W.\r\nThe handle H´ of the manipulator at the station B is shown depressed,\r\nmaking connection at _a´_ with the wire from the battery N´ P´. Thus a\r\ncurrent passes through the handle to _c´_, along the wire to _c_ and\r\nthrough _b_ to the coil of the temporary magnet M, after circling which\r\nit passes to the earth at _e_ and so by E´ to the negative pole N´. The\r\npassage of this current magnetizes M, which draws down the armature\r\n_m_. Thus the lever _l_, pulled down on this side, presses upwards the\r\npointed style _s_ against a strip of paper _p_ which is steadily rolled\r\noff from the wheel W so long as a message is being received. (The\r\nmechanism for this purpose is not indicated in Fig. 7.) Thus, so long\r\nas the operator at B holds down the handle H´, the style _s_ marks the\r\nmoving strip of paper, the spring _r_, under the lever _s l_, drawing\r\nthe style away so soon as the current ceases to flow and the magnet to\r\nact. If he simply depresses the handle for an instant, a dot is marked;\r\nif longer, a dash; and by various combinations of dots and dashes all\r\nthe letters, numerals, etc., are indicated. When the operator at B has\r\ncompleted his message, the handle H´ being raised by the spring under\r\nit (to the position in which H is shown), a message can be received at\r\nB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nI have in the figure and description assumed that the current from\r\neither station acts directly on the magnet which works the recording\r\nstyle. Usually, in long-distance telegraphy, the current is too weak\r\nfor this, and the magnet on which it acts is used only to complete the\r\ncircuit of a local battery, the current from which does the real work\r\nof magnetizing M at A or M´ at B, as the case may be. A local battery\r\nthus employed is called a _relay_.\r\n\r\nThe Morse instrument will serve to illustrate the _principle_ of the\r\nmethods by which facsimiles are obtained. The details of construction\r\nare altogether different from those of the Morse instrument; they\r\nalso vary greatly in different instruments, and are too complex to be\r\nconveniently described here. But the principle, which is the essential\r\npoint, can be readily understood.\r\n\r\nIn working the Morse instrument, the operator at B depresses the handle\r\nH´. Suppose that this handle is kept depressed by a spring, and that\r\na long strip of paper passing uniformly between the two points at _a_\r\nprevents contact. Then no current can pass. But if there is a hole in\r\nthis paper, then when the hole reaches _a_ the two metal points at _a_\r\nmeet and the current passes. We have here the principle of the Bain\r\ntelegraph. A long strip of paper is punched with round and long holes,\r\ncorresponding to the dots and marks of a message by the Morse alphabet.\r\nAs it passes between a metal wheel and a spring, both forming part of\r\nthe circuit, it breaks the circuit until a hole allows the spring to\r\ntouch the wheel, either for a short or longer time-interval, during\r\nwhich the current passes to the other station, where it sets a relay\r\nat work. In Bain’s system the message is received on a chemically\r\nprepared strip of paper, moving uniformly at the receiving station, and\r\nconnected with the negative pole of the relay battery. When contact is\r\nmade, the face of the paper is touched by a steel pointer connected\r\nwith the positive pole, and the current which passes from the end of\r\nthe pointer through the paper to the negative pole produces a blue\r\nmark on the chemically prepared paper.[31]\r\n\r\nWe see that by Bain’s arrangement a paper is marked with dots and\r\nlines, corresponding to round and elongated holes, in a ribbon of\r\npaper. It is only a step from this to the production of facsimiles of\r\nwritings or drawings.\r\n\r\nSuppose a sheet of paper so prepared as to be a conductor of\r\nelectricity, and that a message is written on the paper with some\r\nnon-conducting substance for ink. If that sheet were passed between\r\nthe knobs at _a_ (the handle H being pressed down by a spring),\r\nwhilst simultaneously a sheet of Bain’s chemically prepared paper\r\nwere passed athwart the steel pointer at the receiving station,\r\nthere would be traced across the last-named paper a blue line, which\r\nwould be broken at parts corresponding to those on the other paper\r\nwhere the non-conducting ink interrupted the current. Suppose the\r\nprocess repeated, each paper being slightly shifted so that the line\r\ntraced across either would be parallel and very close to the former,\r\nbut precisely corresponding as respects the position of its length.\r\nThen this line, also, on the recording paper will be broken at parts\r\ncorresponding to those in which the line across the transmitting paper\r\nmeets the writing. If line after line be drawn in this way till the\r\nentire breadth of the transmitting paper has been crossed by close\r\nparallel lines, the entire breadth of the receiving paper will be\r\ncovered by closely marked blue lines except where the writing has\r\nbroken the contact. Thus a negative facsimile of the writing will\r\nbe found in the manner indicated in Figs. 8 and 9.[32] In reality,\r\nin processes of this kind, the papers (unlike the ribbons on Bain’s\r\ntelegraph) are not carried across in the way I have imagined, but are\r\nswept by successive strokes of a movable pointer, along which the\r\ncurrent flows; but the principle is the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.      FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nIt is essential, in such a process as I have described, first, that the\r\nrecording sheet should be carried athwart the pointer which conveys\r\nthe marking current (or the pointer carried across the recording\r\nsheet) in precise accordance with the motion of the transmitting sheet\r\nathwart the wire or style which conveys the current to the long wire\r\nbetween the stations (or of this style across the transmitting sheet).\r\nThe recording sheet and the transmitting sheet must also be shifted\r\nbetween each stroke by an equal amount. The latter point, is easily\r\nsecured; the former is secured by causing the mechanism which gives the\r\ntransmitting style its successive strokes to make and break circuit,\r\nby which a temporary magnet at the receiving station is magnetized and\r\ndemagnetized; by the action of this magnet the recording pointer is\r\ncaused to start on its motion athwart the receiving sheet, and moving\r\nuniformly it completes its thwart stroke at the same instant as the\r\ntransmitting style.\r\n\r\nCaselli’s pantelegraph admirably effects the transmission of\r\nfacsimiles. The transmitting style is carried by the motion of a\r\nheavy pendulum in an arc of constant range over a cylindrical surface\r\non which the paper containing the message, writing, or picture, is\r\nspread. As the swing of the pendulum begins, a similar pendulum at the\r\nreceiving station begins its swing; the same break of circuit which\r\n(by demagnetizing a temporary magnet) releases one, releases the other\r\nalso. The latter swings in an arc of precisely the same range, and\r\ncarries a precisely similar style over a similar cylindrical surface\r\non which is placed the prepared receiving paper. In fact, the same\r\npendulum at either station is used for transmitting and for receiving\r\nfacsimiles. Nay, not only so, but each pendulum, as it swings, serves\r\nin the work both of transmitting and recording facsimiles. As it\r\nswings one way, it travels along a line over each of two messages or\r\ndrawings, while the other pendulum in its synchronous swing traces a\r\ncorresponding line over each of two receiving sheets; and as it swings\r\nthe other way, it traces a line on each of two receiving sheets,\r\ncorresponding to the lines along which the transmitting style of the\r\nother is passing along two messages or drawings. Such, at least, is the\r\nway in which the instrument works in busy times. It can, of course,\r\nsend a message, or two messages, without receiving any.[33]\r\n\r\nIn Caselli’s pantelegraph matters are so arranged that instead of a\r\nnegative facsimile, like Fig. 9, a true facsimile is obtained in all\r\nrespects except that the letters and figures are made by closely set\r\ndark lines instead of being dark throughout as in the message. The\r\ntransmitting paper is conducting and the ink non-conducting, as in\r\nBakewell’s original arrangement; but instead of the conducting paper\r\ncompleting the circuit for the distant station, it completes a short\r\nhome circuit (so to speak) along which the current travels without\r\nentering on the distant circuit When the non-conducting ink breaks the\r\nshort circuit, the current travels in the long circuit through the\r\nrecording pointer at the receiving station; and a mark is thus made\r\ncorresponding to the inked part of the transmitting sheet instead of\r\nthe blank part, as in the older plan.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Guillemin’s “Application of the Physical\r\nForces” indicates the effectiveness of Caselli’s pantelegraph not\r\nonly as respects the character of the message it conveys, but as\r\nto rapidity of transmission. (I alter the measures from the metric\r\nto our usual system of notation.[34]) “Nothing is simpler than the\r\nwriting of the pantelegraph. The message when written is placed on\r\nthe surface of the transmitting cylinder. The clerk makes the warning\r\nsignals, and then sets the pendulum going. The transmission of the\r\nmessage is accomplished automatically, without the clerk having any\r\nwork to do, and consequently without [his] being obliged to acquire\r\nany special knowledge. Since two despatches may be sent at the same\r\ntime—and since shorthand may be used—the rapidity of transmission\r\nmay be considerable.” “The long pendulum of Caselli’s telegraph,” says\r\nM. Quet, “generally performs about forty oscillations a minute, and\r\nthe styles trace forty broken lines, separated from each other by less\r\nthan the hundredth part of an inch. In one minute the lines described\r\nby the style have ranged over a breadth of more than half an inch,\r\nand in twenty minutes of nearly 10½ inches. As we can give the lines\r\na length of 4¼ inches, it follows that in twenty minutes Caselli’s\r\napparatus furnishes the facsimile of the writing or drawing traced on a\r\nmetallized plate 4¼ inches broad by 10½ inches long. For clearness of\r\nreproduction, the original writing must be very legible and in large\r\ncharacters.” “Since 1865 the line from Paris to Lyons and Marseilles\r\nhas been open to the public for the transmission of messages by this\r\ntruly marvellous system.”\r\n\r\nIt will easily be seen that Caselli’s method is capable of many\r\nimportant uses besides the transmission of facsimiles of handwriting.\r\nFor instance, by means of it a portrait of some person who is to be\r\nidentified—whether fraudulent absconder, or escaped prisoner or\r\nlunatic, or wife who has eloped from her husband, or husband who has\r\ndeserted his wife, or missing child, and so on—can be sent in a few\r\nminutes to a distant city where the missing person is likely to be. All\r\nthat is necessary is that from a photograph or other portrait an artist\r\nemployed for the purpose at the transmitting station should, in bold\r\nand heavy lines, sketch the lineaments of the missing person on one\r\nof the prepared sheets, as in Fig. 10. The portrait at the receiving\r\nstation will appear as in Fig. 11, and if necessary an artist at this\r\nstation can darken the lines or in other ways improve the picture\r\nwithout altering the likeness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.      FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nBut now we must turn to the greatest marvel of all—the transmission of\r\ntones, tunes, and words by the electric wire.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of the rhythm of an air is of course a very simple\r\nmatter. I have seen the following passage from “Lardner’s Museum of\r\nScience and Art,” 1859, quoted as describing an anticipation of the\r\ntelephone, though in reality it only shows what every one who has\r\nheard a telegraphic indicator at work must have noticed, that the\r\nclick of the instrument may be made to keep time with an air. “We\r\nwere in the Hanover Street Office, when there was a pause in the\r\nbusiness operations. Mr. M. Porter, of the office at Boston—the\r\nwriter being at New York—asked what tune we would have? We replied,\r\n‘Yankee Doodle,’ and to our surprise he immediately complied with our\r\nrequest. The instrument, a Morse one, commenced drumming the notes of\r\nthe tune as perfectly and distinctly as a skilful drummer could have\r\nmade them at the head of a regiment, and many will be astonished to\r\nhear that ‘Yankee Doodle’ can travel by lightning.... So perfectly\r\nand distinctly were the sounds of the tunes transmitted, that good\r\ninstrumental performers could have no difficulty in keeping time with\r\nthe instruments at this end of the wires.... That a pianist in London\r\nshould execute a fantasia at Paris, Brussels, Berlin, and Vienna, at\r\nthe same moment, and with the same spirit, expression, and precision as\r\nif the instruments at these distant places were under his fingers, is\r\nnot only within the limits of practicability, but really presents no\r\nother difficulty than may arise from the expense of the performances.\r\nFrom what has just been stated, it is clear that the time of music\r\nhas been already transmitted, and the production of the sounds does\r\nnot offer any more difficulty than the printing of the letters of a\r\ndespatch.” Unfortunately, Lardner omitted to describe how this easy\r\ntask was to be achieved.\r\n\r\nReuss first in 1861 showed how a sound can be transmitted. At the\r\nsending station, according to his method, there is a box, into which,\r\nthrough a pipe in the side, the note to be transmitted is sounded. The\r\nbox is open at the top, and across it, near the top, is stretched\r\na membrane which vibrates synchronously with the aerial vibrations\r\ncorresponding to the note. At the middle of the membrane, on its upper\r\nsurface, is a small disc of metal, connected by a thin strip of copper\r\nwith the positive pole of the battery at the transmitting station. The\r\ndisc also, when the machine is about to be put in use, lightly touches\r\na point on a metallic arm, along which (while this contact continues)\r\nthe electric current passes to the wire communicating with the distant\r\nstation. At that station the wire is carried in a coil round a straight\r\nrod of soft iron suspended horizontally in such a way as to be free\r\nto vibrate between two sounding-boards. After forming this coil, the\r\nwire which conveys the current passes to the earth-plate and so home.\r\nAs already explained, while the current passes, the rod of iron is\r\nmagnetized, but the rod loses its magnetization when the current ceases.\r\n\r\nNow, when a note is sounded in the box at the transmitting station, the\r\nmembrane vibrates, and at each vibration the metal disc is separated\r\nfrom the point which it lightly touches when at rest. Thus contact is\r\nbroken at regular intervals, corresponding to the rate of vibration\r\ndue to the note. Suppose, for instance, the note _C_ is sounded; then\r\nthere are 256 complete vibrations in a second, the electric current is\r\ntherefore interrupted and renewed, and the bar of soft iron magnetized\r\nand demagnetized, 256 times in a second. Now, it had been discovered\r\nby Page and Henry that when a bar of iron is rapidly magnetized\r\nand demagnetized, it is put into vibrations synchronizing with the\r\ninterruptions of the current, and therefore emits a note of the same\r\ntone as that which has been sounded into the transmitting box.\r\n\r\nProfessor Heisler, in his “Lehrbuch der technischen Physik,” 1866,\r\nwrote of Reuss’s telephone: “The instrument is still in its infancy;\r\nhowever, by the use of batteries of proper strength, it already\r\ntransmits not only single musical tones, but even the most intricate\r\nmelodies, sung at one end of the line, to the other, situated at a\r\ngreat distance, and makes them perceptible there with all desirable\r\ndistinctness.” Dr. Van der Weyde, of New York, states that, after\r\nreading an account of Reuss’s telephone, he had two such instruments\r\nconstructed, and exhibited them at the meeting of the Polytechnic\r\nClub of the American Institute. “The original sounds were produced at\r\nthe furthest extremity of the large building (the Cooper Institute),\r\ntotally out of hearing of the Association; and the receiving\r\ninstrument, standing on the table in the lecture-room, produced, with\r\na peculiar and rather nasal twang, the different tunes sung into the\r\nbox at the other end of the line; not powerfully, it is true, but very\r\ndistinctly and correctly. In the succeeding summer I improved the form\r\nof the box, so as to produce a more powerful vibration of the membrane.\r\nI also improved the receiving instrument by introducing several iron\r\nwires into the coil, so as to produce a stronger vibration. I submitted\r\nthese, with some other improvements, to the meeting of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, and on that occasion (now\r\nseven years ago) expressed the opinion that the instrument contained\r\nthe germ of a new method of working the electric telegraph, and would\r\nundoubtedly lead to further improvements in this branch of science.”\r\n\r\nThe telephonic successes recently achieved by Mr. Gray were in\r\npart anticipated by La Cour, of Copenhagen, whose method may be\r\nthus described: At the transmitting station a tuning-fork is set\r\nin vibration. At each vibration one of the prongs touches a fine\r\nstrip of metal completing a circuit. At the receiving station the\r\nwire conveying the electric current is coiled round the prongs of\r\nanother tuning-fork of the same tone, but without touching them.\r\nThe intermittent current, corresponding as it does with the rate of\r\nvibration proper to the receiving fork, sets this fork in vibration;\r\nand in La Cour’s instrument the vibrations of the receiving fork\r\nwere used to complete the circuit of a local battery. His object was\r\nnot so much the production of tones as the use of the vibrations\r\ncorresponding to different tones, to act on different receiving\r\ninstruments. For only a fork corresponding to the sending fork could\r\nbe set in vibration by the intermittent current resulting from the\r\nlatter’s vibrations. So that, if there were several transmitting forks,\r\neach could send its own message at the same time, each receiving fork\r\nresponding only to the vibrations of the corresponding transmitting\r\nfork. La Cour proposed, in fact, that his instrument should be used\r\nin combination with other methods of telegraphic communication. Thus,\r\nsince the transmitting fork, whenever put in vibration, sets the local\r\nbattery of the receiving station at work, it can be used to work a\r\nMorse instrument, or it could work an ordinary Wheatstone and Cook\r\ninstrument, or it could be used for a pantelegraph. The same wire, when\r\ndifferent forks are used, could work simultaneously several instruments\r\nat the receiving station. One special use indicated by La Cour was the\r\nadaptation of his system to the Caselli pantelegraph, whereby, instead\r\nof one style, a comb of styles might be carried over the transmitting\r\nand recording plates. It would be necessary, in all such applications\r\nof his method (though, strangely enough, La Cour’s description makes\r\nno mention of the point), that the vibrations of the transmitting fork\r\nshould admit of being instantly stopped or “damped.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gray’s system is more directly telephonic, as aiming rather at the\r\ndevelopment of sound itself than at the transmission of messages by\r\nthe vibrations corresponding to sound. A series of tuning-forks are\r\nused, which are set in separate vibration by fingering the notes of a\r\nkey-board. The vibrations are transmitted to a receiving instrument\r\nconsisting of a series of reeds, corresponding in note to the series of\r\ntransmitting forks, each reed being enclosed in a sounding-box. These\r\nboxes vary in length from two feet to six inches, and are connected\r\nby two wooden bars, one of which carries an electro-magnet, round the\r\ncoils of which pass the currents from the transmitting instrument. When\r\na tuning-fork is set in vibration by the performer at the transmitting\r\nkey-board, the electro-magnet is magnetized and demagnetized\r\nsynchronously with the vibrations of the fork. Not only are vibrations\r\nthus imparted to the reed of corresponding note, but these are\r\nsynchronously strengthened by thuds resulting from the lengthening of\r\nthe iron when magnetized.\r\n\r\nSo far as its musical capabilities are concerned, Gray’s telephone can\r\nhardly be regarded as fulfilling all the hopes that have been expressed\r\nconcerning telephonic music. “Dreaming enthusiasts of a prophetic turn\r\nof mind foretold,” we learn, “that a time would come when future Pattis\r\nwould sing on a London stage to audiences in New York, Berlin, St.\r\nPetersburg, Shanghai, San Francisco, and Constantinople all at once.”\r\nBut the account of the first concert given at a distance scarcely\r\nrealizes these fond expectations. When “Home, Sweet Home,” played at\r\nPhiladelphia, came floating through the air at the Steinway Hall, New\r\nYork, “the sound was like that of a distant organ, rather faint, for a\r\nhard storm was in progress, and there was consequently a great leakage\r\nof the electric current, but quite clear and musical. The lower notes\r\nwere the best, the higher being sometimes almost inaudible. ‘The Last\r\nRose of Summer,’ ‘Com’ è gentil,’ and other melodies, followed, with\r\nmore or less success. There was no attempt to play chords,” though\r\nthree or four notes can be sounded together. It must be confessed that\r\nthe rosy predictions of M. Strakosch (the _impresario_) “as to the\r\nfuture of this instrument seem rather exalted, and we are not likely as\r\nyet to lay on our music from a central reservoir as we lay on gas and\r\nwater, though the experiment was certainly a very curious one.”\r\n\r\nThe importance of Mr. Gray’s, as of La Cour’s inventions, depends,\r\nhowever, far more on the way in which they increase the message-bearing\r\ncapacity of telegraphy than on their power of conveying airs to a\r\ndistance. At the Philadelphia Exhibition, Sir W. Thomson heard four\r\nmessages sounded simultaneously by the Gray telephone. The Morse\r\nalphabet was used. I have mentioned that in that alphabet various\r\ncombinations of dots and dashes are used to represent different\r\nletters; it is only necessary to substitute the short and long duration\r\nof a note for dots and dashes to have a similar sound alphabet.\r\nSuppose, now, four tuning-forks at the transmitting station, whose\r\nnotes are _Do_ [Illustration], _Mi_, _Sol_, and _Do_ [Illustration],\r\nor say _C_, _E_, _G_, and _C_´, then by each of these forks a\r\nseparate message may be transmitted, all the messages being carried\r\nsimultaneously by the same line to separate sounding reeds (or forks,\r\nif preferred), and received by different clerks. With a suitable\r\nkey-board, a single clerk could send the four messages simultaneously,\r\nstriking chords instead of single notes, though considerable practice\r\nwould be necessary to transform four verbal messages at once into the\r\nproper telephonic music, and some skill in fingering to give the proper\r\nduration to each note.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the greatest achievement of all, Professor Graham\r\nBell’s vocal telephone. In the autumn of 1875 I had the pleasure\r\nof hearing from Professor Bell in the course of a ride—all too\r\nshort—from Boston to Salem, Mass., an account of his instrument as\r\nthen devised, and of his hopes as to future developments. These hopes\r\nhave since been in great part fulfilled, but I venture to predict that\r\nwe do not yet know all, or nearly all, that the vocal telephone, in\r\nBell’s hands, is to achieve.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be mentioned at the outset that Bell claims to have\r\ndemonstrated in 1873 (a year before La Cour) the possibility of\r\ntransmitting several messages simultaneously by means of the Morse\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\nBell’s original arrangement for vocal telephony was as follows:—At one\r\nstation a drumhead of goldbeaters’ skin, about 2¾ inches in diameter,\r\nwas placed in front of an electro-magnet. To the middle of the\r\ndrumhead, on the side towards the magnet, was glued a circular piece\r\nof clockspring. A similar electro-magnet, drumhead, etc., were placed\r\nat the other station. When notes were sung or words spoken before one\r\ndrumhead, the vibrations of the goldbeaters’ skin carried the small\r\npiece of clockspring vibratingly towards and from the electro-magnet,\r\nwithout producing actual contact. Now, the current which was passing\r\nalong the coil round the electro-magnet changed in strength with each\r\nchange of position of this small piece of metal. The more rapid the\r\nvibrations, and the greater their amplitude, the more rapid and the\r\nmore intense were the changes in the power of the electric current.\r\nThus, the electro-magnet at the other station underwent changes of\r\npower which were synchronous with, and proportionate to, those changes\r\nof power in the current which were produced by the changes of position\r\nof the vibrating piece of clockspring. Accordingly, the piece of\r\nclockspring at the receiving station, and with it the drumhead there,\r\nwas caused by the electro-magnet to vibrate with the same rapidity and\r\nenergy as the piece at the transmitting station. Therefore, as the\r\ndrumhead at one station varied its vibrations in response to the sounds\r\nuttered in its neighbourhood, so the drumhead at the other station,\r\nvarying its vibrations, emitted similar sounds. Later, the receiving\r\ndrumhead was made unlike the transmitting one. Instead of a membrane\r\ncarrying a small piece of metal, a thin and very flexible disc of\r\nsheet-iron, held in position by a screw, was used. This disc, set in\r\nvibration by the varying action of an electro-magnet, as in the older\r\narrangement, uttered articulate sounds corresponding to those which,\r\nsetting in motion the membrane at the transmitting station, caused the\r\nchanges in the power of the electric current and in the action of the\r\nelectro-magnet.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the British Association in 1876 Sir W. Thomson gave\r\nthe following account of the performance of this instrument at the\r\nPhiladelphia Exhibition:—“In the Canadian department” (for Professor\r\nBell was not at the time an American citizen) “I heard ‘To be or not\r\nto be—there’s the rub,’ through the electric wire; but, scorning\r\nmonosyllables, the electric articulation rose to higher flights, and\r\ngave me passages taken at random from the New York newspapers:—‘S. S.\r\nCox has arrived’ (I failed to make out the ‘S. S. Cox’), ‘the City\r\nof New York,’ ‘Senator Morton,’ ‘the Senate has resolved to print a\r\nthousand extra copies,’ ‘the Americans in London have resolved to\r\ncelebrate the coming Fourth of July.’ All this my own ears heard\r\nspoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the thin circular disc\r\narmature of just such another little electro-magnet as this which I\r\nhold in my hand. The words were shouted with a clear and loud voice\r\nby my colleague judge, Professor Watson, at the far end of the line,\r\nholding his mouth close to a stretched membrane, carrying a piece of\r\nsoft iron, which was thus made to perform in the neighbourhood of an\r\nelectro-magnet, in circuit with the line, motions proportional to the\r\nsonorific motions of the air. This, the greatest by far of all the\r\nmarvels of the electric telegraph, is due to a young countryman of\r\nour own, Mr. Graham Bell, of Edinburgh, and Montreal, and Boston, now\r\nabout to become a naturalized citizen of the United States. Who can\r\nbut admire the hardihood of invention which devised such very slight\r\nmeans to realize the mathematical conception that, if electricity is\r\nto convey all the delicacies of quality which distinguish articulate\r\nspeech, the strength of its current must vary continuously, and as\r\nnearly as may be in simple proportion to the velocity of a particle of\r\nair engaged in constituting the sound?”\r\n\r\nSince these words were spoken by one of the highest authorities in\r\nmatters telegraphic, Professor Bell has introduced some important\r\nmodifications in his apparatus. He now employs, not an electro-magnet,\r\nbut a permanent magnet. That is to say, instead of using at each\r\nstation such a bar of soft iron as is shown in Fig. 6, which becomes\r\na magnet while the electric current is passing through the coil\r\nsurrounding it, he uses at each station a bar of iron permanently\r\nmagnetized (or preferably a powerful magnet made of several horse-shoe\r\nbars—that is, a compound magnet), surrounded similarly by coils of\r\nwire. No battery is needed. Instead of a current through the coils\r\nmagnetizing the iron, the iron already magnetized causes a current\r\nto traverse the coils whenever it acts, or rather whenever its action\r\nchanges. If an armature were placed across its ends or poles, at\r\nthe moment when it drew that armature to the poles by virtue of its\r\nmagnetic power, a current would traverse the coils; but afterwards,\r\nso long as the armature remained there, there would be no current. If\r\nan armature placed near the poles were shifted rapidly in front of\r\nthe poles, currents would traverse the coils, or be induced, their\r\nintensity depending on the strength of the magnet, the length of the\r\ncoil, and the rapidity and range of the motions. In front of the\r\npoles of the magnet is a diaphragm of very flexible iron (or else\r\nsome other flexible material bearing a small piece of iron on the\r\nsurface nearest the poles). A mouthpiece to converge the sound upon\r\nthis diaphragm substantially completes the apparatus at each station.\r\nProfessor Bell thus describes the operation of the instrument:—“The\r\nmotion of steel or iron in front of the poles of a magnet creates a\r\ncurrent of electricity in coils surrounding the poles of the magnet,\r\nand the duration of this current of electricity coincides with the\r\nduration of the motion of the steel or iron moved or vibrated in the\r\nproximity of the magnet. When the human voice causes the diaphragm to\r\nvibrate, electrical undulations are induced in the coils around the\r\nmagnets precisely similar to the undulations of the air produced by the\r\nvoice. The coils are connected with the line wire, and the undulations\r\ninduced in them travel through the wire, and, passing through the coils\r\nof another instrument of similar construction at the other end of the\r\nline, are again resolved into air undulations by the diaphragm of this\r\n(other) instrument.”\r\n\r\nSo perfectly are the sound undulations repeated—though the instrument\r\nhas not yet assumed its final form—that not only has the lightest\r\nwhisper uttered at one end of a line of 140 miles been distinctly heard\r\nat the other, but the speaker can be distinguished by his voice when he\r\nis known to the listener. So far as can be seen, there is every room\r\nto believe that before long Professor Bell’s grand invention will be\r\nperfected to such a degree that words uttered on the American side of\r\nthe Atlantic will be heard distinctly after traversing 2000 miles under\r\nthe Atlantic, at the European end of the submarine cable—so that Sir\r\nW. Thomson at Valentia could tell by the voice whether Graham Bell,\r\nor Cyrus Field, or his late colleague Professor Watson, were speaking\r\nto him from Newfoundland. Yet a single wave of those which toss in\r\nmillions on the Atlantic, rolling in on the Irish strand, would utterly\r\ndrown the voices thus made audible after passing beneath two thousand\r\nmiles of ocean.\r\n\r\nHere surely is the greatest of telegraphic achievements. Of all the\r\nmarvels of telegraphy—and they are many—none are equal to, none\r\nseem even comparable with, this one. Strange truly is the history of\r\nthe progress of research which has culminated in this noble triumph,\r\nwonderful the thought that from the study of the convulsive twitchings\r\nof a dead frog by Galvani, and of the quivering of delicately poised\r\nmagnetic needles by Ampère, should gradually have arisen through\r\nsuccessive developments a system of communication so perfect and so\r\nwonderful as telegraphy has already become, and promising yet greater\r\nmarvels in the future.\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph had barely been written when news arrived of another\r\nform of telephone, surpassing Gray’s and La Cour’s in some respects as\r\na conveyor of musical tones, but as yet unable to speak like Bell’s. It\r\nis the invention of Mr. Edison, an American electrician. He calls it\r\nthe motograph. He discovered about six years ago the curious property\r\non which the construction of the instrument depends. If a piece of\r\npaper moistened with certain chemical solutions is laid upon a metallic\r\nplate connected with the positive pole of a galvanic battery, and a\r\nplatinum wire connected with the negative pole is dragged over the\r\nmoistened paper, the wire slides over the paper like smooth iron over\r\nice—the usual friction disappearing so long as the current is passing\r\nfrom the wire to the plate through the paper. At the receiving station\r\nof Mr. Edison’s motograph there is a resonating box, from one face\r\nof which extends a spring bearing a platinum point, which is pressed\r\nby the spring upon a tape of chemically prepared paper. This tape is\r\nsteadily unwound, drawing by its friction the platinum point, and\r\nwith it the face of the resonator, outwards. This slight strain on\r\nthe face of the resonator continues so long as no current passes from\r\nthe platinum point to the metallic drum over which the moistened tape\r\nis rolling. But so soon as a current passes, the friction immediately\r\nceases, and the face of the resonator resumes its normal position. If\r\nthen at the transmitting station there is a membrane or a very fine\r\ndiaphragm (as in Reuss’s or Bell’s arrangement) which is set vibrating\r\nby a note of any given tone, the current, as in those arrangements, is\r\ntransmitted and stopped at intervals corresponding to the tone, and the\r\nface of the resonating box is freed and pulled at the same intervals.\r\nHence, it speaks the corresponding tone. The instrument appears to have\r\nthe advantage over Gray’s in range. In telegraphic communication Gray’s\r\ntelephone is limited to about one octave. Edison’s extends from the\r\ndeepest bass notes to the highest notes of the human voice, which, when\r\nmagnets are employed, are almost inaudible. But Edison’s motograph has\r\nyet to learn to speak.\r\n\r\nOther telegraphic marvels might well find a place here. I might speak\r\nof the wonders of submarine telegraphy, and of the marvellous delicacy\r\nof the arrangements by which messages by the Atlantic Cable are read,\r\nand not only read, but made to record themselves. I might dwell, again,\r\non the ingenious printing telegraph of Mr. Hughes, which sets up its\r\nown types, inks them, and prints them, or on the still more elaborate\r\nplan of the Chevalier Bonelli “for converting the telegraph stations\r\ninto so many type-setting workshops.” But space would altogether\r\nfail me to deal properly with these and kindred marvels. There is,\r\nhowever, one application of telegraphy, especially interesting to the\r\nastronomer, about which I must say a few words: I mean, the employment\r\nof electricity as a regulator of time. Here again it is the principle\r\nof the system, rather than details of construction, which I propose to\r\ndescribe. Suppose we have a clock not only of excellent construction,\r\nbut under astronomical surveillance, so that when it is a second or so\r\nin error it is set right again by the stars. Let the pendulum of this\r\nclock beat seconds; and at each beat let a galvanic current be made and\r\nbroken. This may be done in many ways—thus the pendulum may at each\r\nswing tilt up a very light metallic hammer, which forms part of the\r\ncircuit when down; or the end of the pendulum may be covered with some\r\nnon-conducting substance which comes at each swing between two metallic\r\nsprings in very light contact, separating them and so breaking circuit;\r\nor in many other ways the circuit may be broken. When the circuit\r\nis made, let the current travel along a wire which passes through a\r\nnumber of stations near or remote, traversing at each the coils of a\r\ntemporary magnet. Then, at each swing of the pendulum of the regulating\r\nclock, each magnet is magnetized and demagnetized. Thus each, once in\r\na second, draws to itself, and then releases its armature, which is\r\nthereupon pulled back by a spring. Let the armature, when drawn to the\r\nmagnet, move a lever by which one tooth of a wheel is carried forward.\r\nThen the wheel is turned at the rate of one tooth per second. This\r\nwheel communicates motion to others in the usual way. In fact, we have\r\nat each station a clock driven, _not_ by a weight or spring and with a\r\npendulum which allows one tooth of an escapement wheel to pass at each\r\nswing, but by the distant regulating clock which turns a driving wheel\r\nat the rate of one tooth per second, that is, one tooth for each swing\r\nof the regulating clock’s pendulum. Each clock, then, keeps perfect\r\ntime with the regulating clock. In astronomy, where it is often of the\r\nutmost importance to secure perfect synchronism of observation, or the\r\npower of noting the exact difference of time between observations made\r\nat distant stations, not only can the same clock thus keep time for\r\ntwo observers hundreds of miles apart, but each observer can record by\r\nthe same arrangement the moment of the occurrence of some phenomenon.\r\nFor if a tape be unwound automatically, as in the Morse instrument,\r\nit is easy so to arrange matters that every second’s beat of the\r\npendulum records itself by a dot or short line on the tape, and that\r\nthe observer can with a touch make (or break) contact at the instant of\r\nobservation, and so a mark be made properly placed between two seconds’\r\nmarks—thus giving the precise time when the observation was made. Such\r\napplications, however, though exceedingly interesting to astronomers,\r\nare not among those in which the general public take chief interest.\r\nThere was one occasion, however, when astronomical time-relations were\r\nconnected in the most interesting manner with one of the greatest of\r\nall the marvels of telegraphy: I mean, when the _Great Eastern_ in\r\nmid-ocean was supplied regularly with Greenwich time, and this so\r\nperfectly (and therefore with such perfect indication of her place in\r\nthe Atlantic), that when it was calculated from the time-signals that\r\nthe buoy left in open ocean to mark the place of the cut cable had been\r\nreached, and the captain was coming on deck with several officers to\r\nlook for it, the buoy announced its presence by thumping the side of\r\nthe great ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PHONOGRAPH, OR VOICE-RECORDER._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding essay I have described the wonderful instrument called\r\nthe telephone, which has recently become as widely known in this\r\ncountry as in America, the country of its first development. I propose\r\nnow briefly to describe another instrument—the phonograph—which,\r\nthough not a telegraphic instrument, is related in some degree to the\r\ntelephone. In passing, I may remark that some, who as telegraphic\r\nspecialists might be expected to know better, have described the\r\nphonograph as a telegraphic invention. A writer in the _Telegraphic\r\nJournal_, for instance, who had mistaken for mine a paper on the\r\nphonograph in one of our daily newspapers, denounced me (as the\r\nsupposed author of that paper) for speaking of the possibility of\r\ncrystallizing sound by means of this instrument; and then went on to\r\nspeak of the mistake I (that is, said author) had made in leaving my\r\nown proper subject of study to speak of telegraphic instruments and\r\nto expatiate on the powers of electricity. In reality the phonograph\r\nhas no relation to telegraphy whatever, and its powers do not in the\r\nslightest degree depend on electricity. If the case had been otherwise,\r\nit may be questioned whether the student of astronomy, or of any other\r\ndepartment of science, should be considered incompetent of necessity\r\nto describe a telegraphic instrument, or to discuss the principles\r\nof telegraphic or electrical science. What should unquestionably be\r\nleft to the specialist, is the description of the practical effect of\r\ndetails of instrumental construction, and the like—for only he who is\r\nin the habit of using special instruments or classes of instrument can\r\nbe expected to be competent adequately to discuss such matters.\r\n\r\nAlthough, however, the phonograph is not an instrument depending, like\r\nthe telephone, on the action of electricity (in some form or other),\r\nyet it is related closely enough to the telephone to make the mistake\r\nof the _Telegraphic_ journalist a natural one. At least, the mistake\r\nwould be natural enough for any one but a telegraphic specialist; the\r\nmore so that Mr. Edison is a telegraphist, and that he has effected\r\nseveral important and interesting inventions in telegraphic and\r\nelectrical science. For instance, in the previous article, pp. 270,\r\n271, I had occasion to describe at some length the principles of his\r\n“Motograph.” I spoke of it as “another form of telephone, surpassing\r\nGray’s and La Cour’s in some respects as a conveyer of musical\r\ntones, but as yet unable to speak like Bell’s ... in telegraphic\r\ncommunication.” I proceeded: “Gray’s telephone is limited to about one\r\noctave. Edison’s extends from the deepest bass notes to the highest\r\nnotes of the human voice, which, when magnets are employed, are almost\r\ninaudible; but it has yet to learn to speak.”\r\n\r\nThe phonograph is an instrument which _has_ learned to speak, though\r\nit does not speak at a distance like the telephone or the motograph.\r\nYet there seems no special reason why it should not combine both\r\nqualities—the power of repeating messages at considerable intervals of\r\ntime after they were originally spoken, and the power of transmitting\r\nthem to great distances.\r\n\r\nI have said that the phonograph is an instrument closely related to the\r\ntelephone. If we consider this feature of the instrument attentively,\r\nwe shall be led to the clearer recognition of the acoustical principles\r\non which its properties depend, and also of the nature of some of the\r\ninteresting acoustical problems on which light seems likely to be\r\nthrown by means of experiments with this instrument.\r\n\r\nIn the telephone a stretched membrane, or a diaphragm of very flexible\r\niron, vibrates when words are uttered in its neighbourhood. When\r\na stretched membrane is used, with a small piece of iron at the\r\ncentre, this small piece of iron, as swayed by the vibrations of the\r\nmembrane, causes electrical undulations to be induced in the coils\r\nround the poles of a magnet placed in front of the membrane. These\r\nundulations travel along the wire and pass through the coils of another\r\ninstrument of similar construction at the other end of the wire, where,\r\naccordingly, a stretched membrane vibrates precisely as the first had\r\ndone. The vibrations of this membrane excite atmospheric vibrations\r\nidentical in character with those which fell upon the first membrane\r\nwhen the words were uttered in its neighbourhood; and therefore the\r\nsame words appear to be uttered in the neighbourhood of the second\r\nmembrane, however far it may be from the transmitting membrane, so only\r\nthat the electrical undulations are effectually transmitted from the\r\nsending to the receiving instrument.\r\n\r\nI have here described what happened in the case of that earlier form\r\nof the telephone in which a stretched membrane of some such substance\r\nas goldbeater’s skin was employed, at the centre of which only was\r\nplaced a small piece of iron. For in its bearing on the subject of\r\nthe phonograph, this particular form of telephonic diaphragm is\r\nmore suggestive than the later form in which very flexible iron was\r\nemployed. We see that the vibrations of a small piece of iron at the\r\ncentre of a membrane are competent to reproduce all the peculiarities\r\nof the atmospheric waves which fall upon the membrane when words are\r\nuttered in its neighbourhood. This must be regarded, I conceive, as a\r\nremarkable acoustical discovery. Most students of acoustics would have\r\nsurmised that to reproduce the motions merely of the central parts\r\nof a stretched diaphragm would be altogether insufficient for the\r\nreproduction of the complicated series of sound-waves corresponding to\r\nthe utterance of words. I apprehend that if the problem had originally\r\nbeen suggested simply as an acoustical one, the idea entertained\r\nwould have been this—that though the motions of a diaphragm receiving\r\nvocal sound-waves _might_ be generated artificially in such sort as to\r\nproduce the same vocal sounds, yet this could only be done by first\r\ndetermining what particular points of the diaphragm were centres of\r\nmotion, so to speak, and then adopting some mechanical arrangements for\r\ngiving to small portions of the membrane at these points the necessary\r\noscillating motions. It would not, I think, have been supposed that\r\nmotions communicated to the centre of the diaphragm would suffice to\r\nmake the whole diaphragm vibrate properly in all its different parts.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly consider what was before known about the vibrations\r\nof plates, discs, and diaphragms, when particular tones were sounded\r\nin their neighbourhood; and also what was known respecting the\r\nrequirements for vocal sounds and speech as distinguished from simple\r\ntones. I need hardly say that I propose only to consider these points\r\nin a general, not in a special, manner.\r\n\r\nWe must first carefully draw a distinction between the vibrations of a\r\nplate or disc which is itself the source of sound, and those vibrations\r\nwhich are excited in a plate or disc by sound-waves otherwise\r\noriginated. If a disc or plate of given size be set in vibration by a\r\nblow or other impulse it will give forth a special sound, according to\r\nthe place where it is struck, or it will give forth combinations of\r\nthe several tones which it is capable of emitting. On the other hand,\r\nexperiment shows that a diaphragm like that used in the telephone—not\r\nonly the electric telephone, but such common telephones as have been\r\nsold of late in large quantities in toy shops, etc.—will respond\r\nto any sounds which are properly directed towards it, not merely\r\nreproducing sounds of different tones, but all the peculiarities which\r\ncharacterize vocal sounds. In the former case, the size of a disc and\r\nthe conditions under which it is struck determine the nature of its\r\nvibrations, and the air responds to the vibrations thus excited; in the\r\nlatter, the air is set moving in vibrations of a special kind by the\r\nsounds or words uttered, and the disc or diaphragm responds to these\r\nvibrations. Nevertheless, though it is important that this distinction\r\nbe recognized, we can still learn, from the behaviour of discs and\r\nplates set in vibration by a blow or other impulse, the laws according\r\nto which the actual motions of the various parts of a vibrating disc\r\nor plate take place. We owe to Chladni the invention of a method for\r\nrendering visible the nature of such motions.\r\n\r\nCertain electrical experiments of Lichtenberg suggested to Chladni\r\nthe idea of scattering fine sand over the plate or disc whose motions\r\nhe wished to examine. If a horizontal plate covered with fine sand is\r\nset in vibration, those parts which move upwards and downwards scatter\r\nthe sand from their neighbourhood, while on those points which undergo\r\nno change of position the sand will remain. Such points are called\r\n_nodes_; and rows of such points are called _nodal lines_, which may be\r\neither straight or curved, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf a square plate of glass is held by a suitable clamp at its centre,\r\nand the middle point of a side is touched while a bow is drawn across\r\nthe edge near a corner, the sand is seen to gather in the form of a\r\ncross dividing the square into four equal squares—like a cross of St\r\nGeorge. If the finger touches a corner, and the bow is drawn across the\r\nmiddle of a side, the sand forms a cross dividing the square along its\r\ndiagonals—like a cross of St Andrew. Touching two points equidistant\r\nfrom two corners, and drawing the bow along the middle of the opposite\r\nedge, we get the diagonal cross and also certain curved lines of\r\nsand systematically placed in each of the four quarters into which\r\nthe diagonals divide the square. We also have, in this case, a far\r\nshriller note from the vibrating plate. And so, by various changes in\r\nthe position of the points clamped by the finger and of the part of the\r\nedge along which the bow is drawn, we can obtain innumerable varieties\r\nof nodal lines and curves along which the sand gathers upon the surface\r\nof the vibrating plate.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a circular plate of glass, clamped at the middle, and\r\ntouching one part of its edge with the finger, draw the bow across a\r\npoint of the edge half a quadrant from the finger, we see the sand\r\narrange itself along two diameters intersecting at right angles. If the\r\nbow is drawn at a point one-third a quadrant from the finger-clamped\r\npoint, we get a six-pointed star. If the bow is drawn at a point\r\na fourth of a quadrant from the finger-clamped point, we get an\r\neight-pointed star. And so we can get the sand to arrange itself into a\r\nstar of any even number of points; that is, we can get a star of four,\r\nsix, eight, ten, twelve, etc., points, but not of three, five, seven,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the centre of the plate or disc has been fixed. If,\r\ninstead, the plate or disc be fixed by a clip at the edge, or clamped\r\nelsewhere than at the centre, we find the sand arranging itself into\r\nother forms, in which the centre may or may not appear; that is, the\r\ncentre may or may not be nodal, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nA curious effect is produced if very fine powder be strewn along\r\nwith the sand over the plate. For it is found that the dust gathers,\r\nnot where the nodes or places of no vibration lie, but where the\r\nmotion is greatest. Faraday assigns as the cause of this peculiarity\r\nthe circumstance that “the light powder is entangled by the little\r\nwhirlwinds of air produced by the vibrations of the plate; it cannot\r\nescape from the little cyclones, though the heavier sand particles are\r\nreadily driven through them; when, therefore, the motion ceases, the\r\nlight powder settles down in heaps at the places where the vibration\r\nwas a maximum.” In proof of this theory we have the fact that “in vacuo\r\nno such effect is produced; all powders light and heavy move to the\r\nnodal lines.” (Tyndall on “Sound.”)\r\n\r\nNow if we consider the meaning of such results as these, we shall begin\r\nto recognize the perplexing but also instructive character of the\r\nevidence derived from the telephone, and applied to the construction\r\nof the phonograph. It appears that when a disc is vibrating under such\r\nspecial conditions as to give forth a particular series of tones (the\r\nso-called fundamental tone of the disc and other tones combined with it\r\nwhich belong to its series of overtones), the various parts of the disc\r\nare vibrating to and fro in a direction square to the face of the disc,\r\nexcept certain points at which there is no vibration, these points\r\ntogether forming curves of special forms along the substance of the\r\ndisc.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand, tones of various kinds are sounded in the\r\nneighbourhood of a disc or of a stretched circular membrane, we may\r\nassume that the different parts of the disc are set in vibration after\r\na manner at least equally complicated. If the tones belong to the\r\nseries which could be emitted by the diaphragm when struck, we can\r\nunderstand that the vibrations of the diaphragm would resemble those\r\nwhich would result from a blow struck under special conditions. When\r\nother tones are sounded, it may be assumed that the sound-waves which\r\nreach the diaphragm cause it to vibrate as though not the circumference\r\n(only) but a circle in the substance of the diaphragm—concentric,\r\nof course, with the circumference, and corresponding in dimensions\r\nwith the tone of the sounds—were fixed. If a drum of given size is\r\nstruck, we hear a note of particular tone. If we heard, as the result\r\nof a blow on the same drum, a much higher tone, we should know that\r\nin some way or other the effective dimensions of the drum-skin had\r\nbeen reduced—as for instance, by a ring firmly pressed against the\r\ninside of the skin. So when a diaphragm is responding to tones other\r\nthan those corresponding to its size, tension, etc., we infer that the\r\nsound-waves reaching it cause it to behave, so far as its effective\r\nvibrating portion is concerned, as though its conformation had altered.\r\nWhen several tones are responded to by such a diaphragm, we may infer\r\nthat the vibrations of the diaphragm are remarkably complicated.\r\n\r\nNow the varieties of vibratory motion to which the diaphragm of the\r\ntelephone has been made to respond have been multitudinous. Not only\r\nhave all orders of sound singly and together been responded to, but\r\nvocal sounds which in many respects differ widely from ordinary tones\r\nare repeated, and the peculiarities of intonation which distinguish one\r\nvoice from another have been faithfully reproduced.\r\n\r\nLet us consider in what respects vocal sounds, and especially the\r\nsounds employed in speech, differ from mere combinations of ordinary\r\ntones.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and with some justice, that the organ of voice\r\nis of the nature of a reed instrument. A reed instrument, as most\r\npersons know, is one in which musical sounds are produced by the\r\naction of a vibrating reed in breaking up a current of air into a\r\nseries of short puffs. The harmonium, accordion, concertina, etc.,\r\nare reed instruments, the reed for each note being a fine strip of\r\nmetal vibrating in a slit. The vocal organ of man is at the top of\r\nthe windpipe, along which a continuous current of air can be forced\r\nby the lungs. Certain elastic bands are attached to the head of the\r\nwindpipe, almost closing the aperture. These vocal chords are thrown\r\ninto vibration by the current of air from the lungs; and as the rate\r\nof their vibration is made to vary by varying their tension, the sound\r\nchanges in tone. So far, we have what corresponds to a reed instrument\r\nadmitting of being altered in pitch so as to emit different notes.\r\nThe mouth, however, affects the character of the sound uttered from\r\nthe throat. The character of a _tone_ emitted by the throat cannot be\r\naltered by any change in the configuration of the mouth; so that if a\r\nsingle tone were in reality produced by the vocal chords, the resonance\r\nof the mouth would only strengthen that tone more or less according to\r\nthe figure given to the cavity of the mouth at the will of the singer\r\nor speaker. But in reality, besides the fundamental tone uttered by\r\nthe vocal chords, a series of overtones are produced. Overtones are\r\ntones corresponding to vibration at twice, three times, four times,\r\netc., the rate of the vibration producing the fundamental tone. Now the\r\ncavity of the mouth can be so modified in shape as to strengthen either\r\nthe fundamental tone or any one of these overtones. And according as\r\nspecial tones are strengthened in this way various vocal sounds are\r\nproduced, without changing the pitch or intensity of the sound actually\r\nuttered. Calling the fundamental tone the first tone, the overtones\r\njust mentioned the second, third, fourth, etc., tones respectively\r\n(after Tyndall), we find that the following relations exist between the\r\ncombinations of these tones and the various vowel sounds:—\r\n\r\nIf the lips are pushed forward so as to make the cavity of the mouth\r\ndeep and the orifice of the mouth small, we get the deepest resonance\r\nof which the mouth is capable, the fundamental tone is reinforced,\r\nwhile the higher tones are as far as possible thrown into the shade.\r\nThe resulting vowel sound is that of deep U (“oo” in “hoop”).\r\n\r\nIf the mouth is so far opened that the fundamental tone is accompanied\r\nby a strong second tone (the next higher octave to the fundamental\r\ntone), we get the vowel sound O (as in “hole”). The third and fourth\r\ntones feebly accompanying the first and second make the sound more\r\nperfect, but are not necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the orifice of the mouth is so widened, and the volume of the cavity\r\nso reduced, that the fundamental tone is lost, the second somewhat\r\nweakened, and the third given as the chief tone, with very weak fourth\r\nand fifth tones, we have the vowel sound A.\r\n\r\nTo produce the vowel sound E, the resonant cavity of the mouth must be\r\nconsiderably reduced. The fourth tone is the characteristic of this\r\nvowel. Yet the second tone also must be given with moderate strength.\r\nThe first and third tones must be weak, and the fifth tone should be\r\nadded with moderate strength.\r\n\r\nTo produce the vowel sound A, as in “far,” the higher overtones are\r\nchiefly used, the second is wanting altogether, the third feeble, the\r\nhigher tones—especially the fifth and seventh—strong.\r\n\r\nThe vowel sound I, as in “fine,” it should be added, is not a simple\r\nsound, but diphthongal. The two sounds whose succession gives the sound\r\nwe represent (erroneously) by a single letter I (long), are not very\r\ndifferent from “a” as in “far,” and “ee” (or “i” as in “ravine”);\r\nthey, lie, however, in reality, respectively between “a” in “far” and\r\n“fat,” and “i” in “ravine” and “pin.” Thus the tones and overtones\r\nnecessary for sounding “I” long, do not require a separate description,\r\nany more than those necessary for sounding other diphthongs, as “oi,”\r\n“oe,” and so forth.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the sound-waves necessary to reproduce accurately\r\nthe various vowel sounds, are more complicated than those which would\r\ncorrespond to the fundamental tones simply in which any sound may be\r\nuttered. There must not only be in each case certain overtones, but\r\neach overtone must be sounded with its due degree of strength.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all, even as regards the vowel sounds, the most\r\nreadily reproducible peculiarities of ordinary speech. Spoken sounds\r\ndiffer from musical sounds properly so called, in varying in pitch\r\nthroughout their continuance. So far as tone is concerned, apart from\r\nvowel quality, the speech note may be imitated by sliding a finger up\r\nthe finger-board of a violin while the bow is being drawn. A familiar\r\nillustration of the varying pitch of a speech note is found in the\r\nutterance of Hamlet’s question, “Pale, or red?” with intense anxiety of\r\ninquiry, if one may so speak. “The speech note on the word ‘pale’ will\r\nconsist of an upward movement of the voice, while that on ‘red’ will\r\nbe a downward movement, and in both words the voice will traverse an\r\ninterval of pitch so wide as to be conspicuous to ordinary ears; while\r\nthe cultivated perception of the musician will detect the voice moving\r\nthrough a less interval of pitch while he is uttering the word ‘or’\r\nof the same sentence. And he who can record in musical notation the\r\nsounds which he hears, will perceive the musical interval traversed in\r\nthese vocal movements, and the place also of these speech notes on the\r\nmusical staff.” Variations of this kind, only not so great in amount,\r\noccur in ordinary speech; and no telephonic or phonographic instrument\r\ncould be regarded as perfect, or even satisfactory, which did not\r\nreproduce them.\r\n\r\nBut the vowel sounds are, after all, combinations and modifications\r\nof musical tones. It is otherwise with consonantal sounds, which, in\r\nreality, result from various ways in which vowel sounds are commenced,\r\ninterrupted (wholly or partially), and resumed. In one respect this\r\nstatement requires, perhaps, some modification—a point which has not\r\nbeen much noticed by writers on vocal sounds. In the case of liquids,\r\nvowel sounds are not partially interrupted only, as is commonly stated.\r\nThey cease entirely as vowel sounds, though the utterance of a vocal\r\nsound is continued when a liquid consonant is uttered. Let the reader\r\nutter any word in which a liquid occurs, and he will find that while\r\nthe liquid itself is sounded the vowel sounds preceding or following\r\nthe liquid cease entirely. Repeating slowly, for example, the word\r\n“remain,” dwelling on all the liquids, we find that while the “r” is\r\nbeing sounded the “ē” sound cannot be given, and this sound ceases so\r\nsoon as the “m” is sounded; similarly the long “a” sound can only be\r\nuttered when the “m” sound ceases, and cannot be carried on into the\r\nsound of the final liquid “n.” The liquids are, in fact, improperly\r\ncalled semi-vowels, since no vowel sound can accompany their utterance.\r\nThe tone, however, with which they are sounded can be modified during\r\ntheir utterance. In sounding labials the emission of air is not stopped\r\ncompletely at any moment. The same is true of the sibilants s, z, sh,\r\nzh, and of the consonants g, j, f, v, th (hard and soft). These are\r\ncalled, on this account, _continuous_ consonants. The only consonants\r\nin pronouncing which the emission of air is for a moment entirely\r\nstopped, are the true mutes, sometimes called the six _explosive_\r\nconsonants, b, p, t, d, k, and g.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce artificially sounds resembling those of the consonants\r\nin speech, we must for a moment interrupt, wholly for explosive and\r\npartially for continuous consonant sounds, the passage of air through a\r\nreed pipe. Tyndall thus describes an experiment of this kind in which\r\nan imperfect imitation of the sound of the letter “m” was obtained—an\r\nimitation only requiring, to render it perfect, as I have myself\r\nexperimentally verified, attention to the consideration respecting\r\nliquids pointed out in the preceding paragraph. “Here,” says Tyndall,\r\ndescribing the experiment as conducted during a lecture, “is a free\r\nreed fixed in a frame, but without any pipe associated with it, mounted\r\non the acoustic bellows. When air is urged through the orifice, it\r\nspeaks in this forcible manner. I now fix upon the frame of the reed\r\na pyramidal pipe; you notice a change in the clang, and, by pushing\r\nmy flat hand over the open end of the pipe, the similarity between\r\nthe sounds produced and those of the human voice is unmistakable.\r\nHolding the palm of my hand over the end of the pipe, so as to close\r\nit altogether, and then raising my hand twice in quick succession, the\r\nword ‘mamma’ is heard as plainly as if it were uttered by an infant.\r\nFor this pyramidal tube I now substitute a shorter one, and with it\r\nmake the same experiment. The ‘mamma’ now heard is exactly such as\r\nwould be uttered by a child with a stopped nose. Thus, by associating\r\nwith a vibrating reed a suitable pipe, we can impart to the sound of\r\nthe reed the qualities of the human voice.” The “m” obtained in these\r\nexperiments was, however, imperfect. To produce an “m” sound such as an\r\nadult would utter without a “stopped nose,” all that is necessary is\r\nto make a small opening (experiment readily determines the proper size\r\nand position) in the side of the pyramidal pipe, so that, as in the\r\nnatural utterance of this liquid, the emission of air is not altogether\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nI witnessed in 1874 some curious illustrations of the artificial\r\nproduction of vocal sounds, at the Stevens Institute, Hoboken,\r\nN.J., where the ingenious Professor Mayer (who will have, I trust,\r\na good deal to say about the scientific significance of telephonic\r\nand phonographic experiments before long) has acoustic apparatus,\r\nincluding several talking-pipes. By suitably moving his hand on the top\r\nof some of these pipes, he could make them speak certain words with\r\ntolerable distinctness, and even utter short sentences. I remember\r\nthe performance closed with the remarkably distinct utterance, by one\r\nprofane pipe, of the words euphemistically rendered by Mark Twain (in\r\nhis story of the Seven Sleepers, I think), “Go thou to Hades!”\r\n\r\nNow, the speaking diaphragm in the telephone, as in the phonograph,\r\npresently to be described, must reproduce not only all the varieties\r\nof sound-wave corresponding to vowel sounds, with their intermixtures\r\nof the fundamental tone and its overtones and their inflexions or\r\nsliding changes of pitch, but also all the effects produced on the\r\nreceiving diaphragm by those interruptions, complete or partial, of\r\naerial emission which correspond to the pronunciation of the various\r\nconsonant sounds. It might certainly have seemed hopeless, from all\r\nthat had been before known or surmised respecting the effects of aerial\r\nvibrations on flexible diaphragms, to attempt to make a diaphragm speak\r\nartificially—in other words, to make the movements of all parts of\r\nit correspond with those of a diaphragm set in vibration by spoken\r\nwords—by movements affecting only its central part. It is in the\r\nrecognition of the possibility of this, or rather in the discovery\r\nof the fact that the movements of a minute portion of the middle of\r\na diaphragm regulate the vibratory and other movements of the entire\r\ndiaphragm, that the great scientific interest of Professor Graham\r\nBell’s researches appears to me to reside.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, in illustration of the difficulties with which formerly\r\nthe subject appeared to be surrounded, to describe the results of\r\nexperiments which preceded, though they can scarcely be said to have\r\nled up to, the invention of artificial ways of reproducing speech.\r\nI do not now refer to experiments like those of Kratzenstein of\r\nSt. Petersburg, and Von Kempelen of Vienna, in 1779, and the more\r\nsuccessful experiments by Willis in later years, but to attempts\r\nwhich have been made to obtain material records of the aerial motions\r\naccompanying the utterance of spoken words. The most successful of\r\nthese attempts was that made by Mr. W. H. Barlow. His purpose was “to\r\nconstruct an instrument which should record the pneumatic actions”\r\naccompanying the utterance of articulated sounds “by diagrams, in\r\na manner analogous to that in which the indicator-diagram of a\r\nsteam-engine records the action of the engine.” He perceived that the\r\nactual aerial pressures involved being very small and very variable,\r\nand the succession of impulses and changes of pressure being very\r\nrapid, it was necessary that the moving parts should be very light,\r\nand that the movement and marking should be accomplished with as\r\nlittle friction as possible. The instrument he constructed consisted\r\nof a small speaking-trumpet about four inches long, having an ordinary\r\nmouthpiece connected to a tube half an inch in diameter, the thin end\r\nof which widened out so as to form an aperture of 2¼ inches diameter.\r\nThis aperture was covered with a membrane of goldbeater’s skin, or thin\r\ngutta-percha. A spring carrying a marker was made to press against the\r\nmembrane with a slight initial pressure, to prevent as far as possible\r\nthe effects of jarring and consequent vibratory action. A light arm\r\nof aluminium was connected with the spring, and held the marker; and\r\na continuous strip of paper was made to pass under the marker in the\r\nmanner employed in telegraphy. The marker consisted of a small, fine\r\nsable brush, placed in a light tube of glass one-tenth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, the tube being rounded at the lower end, and pierced with a\r\nhole about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter. Through this hole the\r\ntip of the brush projected, and was fed by colour put into the glass\r\ntube by which it was held. It should be added that, to provide for the\r\nescape of air passing through the speaking-trumpet, a small opening\r\nwas made in the side, so that the pressure exerted upon the membrane\r\nwas that due to the excess of air forced into the trumpet over that\r\nexpelled through the orifice. The strength of the spring which carried\r\nthe marker was so adjusted to the size of the orifice that, while the\r\nlightest pressures arising under articulation could be recorded, the\r\ngreatest pressures should not produce a movement exceeding the width of\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n“It will be seen,” says Mr. Barlow, “that in this construction of the\r\ninstrument the sudden application of pressure is as suddenly recorded,\r\nsubject only to the modifications occasioned by the inertia, momentum,\r\nand friction of the parts moved. But the record of the sudden cessation\r\nof pressure is further affected by the time required to discharge the\r\nair through the escape-orifice. Inasmuch, however, as these several\r\neffects are similar under similar circumstances, the same diagram\r\nshould always be obtained from the same pneumatic action when the\r\ninstrument is in proper adjustment; and this result is fairly borne out\r\nby the experiments.”\r\n\r\nThe defect of the instrument consisted in the fact that it recorded\r\nchanges of pressure only; and in point of fact it seems to result,\r\nfrom the experiments made with it, that it could only indicate the\r\norder in which explosive, continuant, and liquid consonants succeeded\r\neach other in spoken words, the vowels being all expressed in the\r\nsame way, and only one letter—the rough R, or R with a burr—being\r\nalways unmistakably indicated. The explosives were represented by a\r\nsudden sharp rise and fall in the recorded curve; the height of the\r\nrise depending on the strength with which the explosive is uttered,\r\nnot on the nature of the consonant itself. Thus the word “tick” is\r\nrepresented by a higher elevation for the “t” than for the “k,” but the\r\nword “kite” by a higher elevation for the “k” than for the “t.” It is\r\nnoteworthy that there is always a second smaller rise and fall after\r\nthe first chief one, in the case of each of the explosives. This shows\r\nthat the membrane, having first been forcibly distended by the small\r\naerial explosion accompanying the utterance of such a consonant, sways\r\nback beyond the position where the pressure and the elasticity of the\r\nmembrane would (for the moment) exactly balance, and then oscillates\r\nback again over that position before returning to its undistended\r\ncondition. Sometimes a third small elevation can be recognized,\r\nand when an explosive is followed by a rolling “r” several small\r\nelevations are seen. The continuous consonants produce elevations less\r\nsteep and less high; aspirates and sibilants give rounded hills. But\r\nthe results vary greatly according to the position of a consonant; and,\r\nso far as I can make out from a careful study of the very interesting\r\ndiagrams accompanying Mr. Barlow’s paper, it would be quite impossible\r\nto define precisely the characteristic records even of each order of\r\nconsonantal sounds, far less of each separate sound.\r\n\r\nWe could readily understand that the movement of the central part of\r\nthe diaphragm in the telephone should give much more characteristic\r\ndifferences for the various sounds than Barlow’s logograph. For if\r\nwe imagine a small pointer attached to the centre of the face of the\r\nreceiving diaphragm while words are uttered in its neighbourhood, the\r\nend of that pointer would not only move to and fro in a direction\r\nsquare to the face of the diaphragm, as was the case with Barlow’s\r\nmarker, but it would also sway round its mean position in various small\r\ncircles or ovals, varying in size, shape, and position, according to\r\nthe various sounds uttered. We might expect, then, that if in any way\r\na record of the actual motions of the extremity of that small pointer\r\ncould be obtained, in such sort that its displacement in directions\r\nsquare to the face of the diaphragm, as well as its swayings around\r\nits mean position, would be indicated in some pictorial manner, the\r\nstudy of such records would indicate the exact words spoken near the\r\ndiaphragm, and even, perhaps, the precise tones in which they were\r\nuttered. For Barlow’s logograph, dealing with one only of the orders\r\nof motion (really triple in character), gives diagrams in which the\r\ngeneral character of the sounds uttered is clearly indicated, and the\r\nsupposed records would show much more.\r\n\r\nBut although this might, from _à priori_ considerations, have been\r\nreasonably looked for, it by no means follows that the actual results\r\nof Bell’s telephonic experiments could have been anticipated. That the\r\nmovement of the central part of the diaphragm should suffice to show\r\nthat such and such words had been uttered, is one thing; but that these\r\nmovements should of themselves suffice, if artificially reproduced, to\r\ncause the diaphragm to reproduce these words, is another and a very\r\ndifferent one. I venture to express my conviction that at the beginning\r\nof his researches Professor Bell can have had very little hope that\r\nany such result would be obtained, notwithstanding some remarkable\r\nexperiments respecting the transmission of sound which we can _now_\r\nvery clearly perceive to point in that direction.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, he had invented the telephone, this point was in effect\r\ndemonstrated; for in that instrument, as we have seen, the movements\r\nof the minute piece of metal attached (at least in the earlier forms\r\nof the instrument) to the centre of the receiving membrane, suffice,\r\nwhen precisely copied by the similar central piece of metal in the\r\ntransmitting membrane, to cause the words which produced the motions of\r\nthe receiving or hearing membrane to be uttered (or seem to be uttered)\r\nby the transmitting or speaking membrane.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved, however, for Edison (of New Jersey, U.S.A., Electrical\r\nAdviser to the Western Union Telegraph Company) to show how advantage\r\nmight be taken of this discovery to make a diaphragm speak, not\r\ndirectly through the action of the movements of a diaphragm affected by\r\nspoken words or other sounds, and therefore either simultaneously with\r\nthese or in such quick succession after them as corresponds with the\r\ntransmission of their effects along some line of electrical or other\r\ncommunication, but by the mechanical reproduction of similar movements\r\nat any subsequent time (within certain limits at present, but probably\r\nhereafter with practically unlimited extension as to time).\r\n\r\nThe following is slightly modified from Edison’s own description of the\r\nphonograph:—\r\n\r\nThe instrument is composed of three parts mainly; namely, a receiving,\r\na recording, and a transmitting apparatus. The receiving apparatus\r\nconsists of a curved tube, one end of which is fitted with a\r\nmouthpiece. The other end is about two inches in diameter, and is\r\nclosed with a disc or diaphragm of exceedingly thin metal, capable of\r\nbeing thrust slightly outwards or vibrated upon gentle pressure being\r\napplied to it from within the tube. To the centre of this diaphragm\r\n(which is vertical) is fixed a small blunt steel pin, which shares the\r\nvibratory motion of the diaphragm. This arrangement is set on a table,\r\nand can be adjusted suitably with respect to the second part of the\r\ninstrument—the recorder. This is a brass cylinder, about four inches\r\nin length and four in diameter, cut with a continuous V-groove from\r\none end to the other, so that in effect it represents a large screw.\r\nThere are forty of these grooves in the entire length of the cylinder.\r\nThe cylinder turns steadily, when the instrument is in operation,\r\nupon a vertical axis, its face being presented to the steel point of\r\nthe receiving apparatus. The shaft on which it turns is provided with\r\na screw-thread and works in a screwed bearing, so that as the shaft\r\nis turned (by a handle) it not only turns the cylinder, but steadily\r\ncarries it upwards. The rate of this vertical motion is such that the\r\ncylinder behaves precisely as if its groove worked in a screw-bearing.\r\nThus, if the pointer be set opposite the middle of the uppermost part\r\nof the continuous groove at the beginning of this turning motion, it\r\nwill traverse the groove continuously to its lowest part, which it will\r\nreach after forty turnings of the handle. (More correctly, perhaps, we\r\nmight say that the groove continuously traverses past the pointer.)\r\nNow, suppose that a piece of some such substance as tinfoil is wrapped\r\nround the cylinder. Then the pointer, when at rest, just touches the\r\ntinfoil. But when the diaphragm is vibrating under the action of aerial\r\nwaves resulting from various sounds, the pointer vibrates in such a way\r\nas to indent the tinfoil—not only to a greater or less depth according\r\nto the play of the pointer to and fro in a direction square to the face\r\nof the diaphragm, but also over a range all round its mean position,\r\ncorresponding to the play of the end of the pointer around _its_ mean\r\nposition. The groove allows the pressure of the pointer against the\r\ntinfoil free action. If the cylinder had no groove the dead resistance\r\nof the tinfoil, thus backed up by an unyielding surface, would stop\r\nthe play of the pointer. Under the actual conditions, the tinfoil\r\nis only kept taut enough to receive the impressions, while yielding\r\nsufficiently to let the play of the pointer continue unrestrained.\r\nIf now a person speaks into the receiving tube, and the handle of\r\nthe cylinder be turned, the vibrations of the pointer are impressed\r\nupon the portion of the tinfoil lying over the hollow groove, and are\r\nretained by it. They will be more or less deeply marked according to\r\nthe quality of the sounds emitted, and according also, of course, to\r\nthe strength with which the speaker utters the sounds, and to the\r\nnature of the modulations and inflexions of his voice. The result is\r\na message verbally imprinted upon a strip of metal. It differs from\r\nthe result in the case of Barlow’s logograph, in being virtually a\r\nrecord in three dimensions instead of one only. The varying depth of\r\nthe impressions corresponds to the varying height of the curve in\r\nBarlow’s diagrams; but there the resemblance ceases; for that was\r\nthe single feature which Barlow’s logographs could present. Edison’s\r\nimprinted words show, besides varying depth of impression, a varying\r\nrange on either side of the mean track of the pointer, and also—though\r\nthe eye is not able to detect this effect—there is a varying rate of\r\nprogression according as the end of the pointer has been swayed towards\r\nor from the direction in which, owing to the motion of the cylinder,\r\nthe pointer is virtually travelling.\r\n\r\nWe may say of the record thus obtained that it is sound presented\r\nin a visible form. A journalist who has written on the phonograph\r\nhas spoken of this record as corresponding to the crystallization of\r\nsound. And another who, like the former, has been (erroneously, but\r\nthat is a detail) identified with myself, has said, in like fanciful\r\nvein, that the story of Baron Münchausen hearing words which had been\r\nfrozen during severe cold melting into speech again, so that all the\r\nbabble of a past day came floating about his ears, has been realized\r\nby Edison’s invention. Although such expressions may not be, and in\r\npoint of fact are not, strictly scientific, I am not disposed, for my\r\nown part, to cavil with them. If they could by any possibility be taken\r\n_au pied de la lettre_ (and, by the way, we find quite a new meaning\r\nfor this expression in the light of what is now known about vowels\r\nand consonants), there would be valid objection to their use. But, as\r\nno one supposes that Edison’s phonograph really crystallizes words or\r\nfreezes sounds, it seems hypercritical to denounce such expressions as\r\nthe critic of the _Telegraphic Journal_ has denounced them.\r\n\r\nTo return to Edison’s instrument.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained a material record of sounds, vocal or otherwise,\r\nit remains that a contrivance should be adopted for making this\r\nrecord reproduce the sounds by which it was itself formed. This is\r\neffected by a third portion of the apparatus, the transmitter. This\r\nis a conical drum, or rather a drum shaped like a frustum of a cone,\r\nhaving its larger end open, the smaller—which is about two inches in\r\ndiameter—being covered with paper stretched tight like the parchment\r\nof a drumhead. In front of this diaphragm is a light flat steel spring,\r\nheld vertically, and ending in a blunt steel point, which projects\r\nfrom it and corresponds precisely with that on the diaphragm of the\r\nreceiver. The spring is connected with the paper diaphragm by a silken\r\nthread, just sufficiently in tension to cause the outer face of the\r\ndiaphragm to be slightly convex. Having removed the receiving apparatus\r\nfrom the cylinder and set the cylinder back to its original position,\r\nthe transmitting apparatus is brought up to the cylinder until the\r\nsteel point just rests, without pressure, in the first indentation\r\nmade in the tinfoil by the point of the receiver. If now the handle is\r\nturned at the same speed as when the message was being recorded, the\r\nsteel point will follow the line of impression, and will vibrate in\r\nperiods corresponding to the impressions which were produced by the\r\npoint of the receiving apparatus. The paper diaphragm being thus set\r\ninto vibrations of the requisite kind in number, depth, and side-range,\r\nthere are produced precisely the same sounds that set the diaphragm of\r\nthe receiver into vibration originally. Thus the words of the speaker\r\nare heard issuing from the conical drum in his own voice, tinged\r\nwith a slightly metallic or mechanical tone. If the cylinder be more\r\nslowly turned when transmitting than it had been when receiving the\r\nmessage, the voice assumes a base tone; if more quickly, the message\r\nis given with a more treble voice. “In the present machine,” says the\r\naccount, “when a long message is to be recorded, so soon as one strip\r\nof tinfoil is filled, it is removed and replaced by others, until the\r\ncommunication has been completed. In using the machine for the purpose\r\nof correspondence, the metal strips are removed from the cylinder\r\nand sent to the person with whom the speaker desires to correspond,\r\nwho must possess a machine similar to that used by the sender. The\r\nperson receiving the strips places them in turn on the cylinder of\r\nhis apparatus, applies the transmitter, and puts the cylinder in\r\nmotion, when he hears his friend’s voice speaking to him from the\r\nindented metal. And he can repeat the contents of the missive as often\r\nas he pleases, until he has worn the metal through. The sender can\r\nmake an infinite number of copies of his communication by taking a\r\nplaster-of-Paris cast of the original, and rubbing off impressions from\r\nit on a clean sheet of foil.”\r\n\r\nI forbear from dwelling further on the interest and value of this\r\nnoble invention, or of considering some of the developments which it\r\nwill probably receive before long, for already I have occupied more\r\nspace than I had intended. I have no doubt that in these days it will\r\nbring its inventor less credit, and far less material gain, than would\r\nbe acquired from the invention of some ingenious contrivance for\r\ndestroying many lives at a blow, bursting a hole as large as a church\r\ndoor in the bottom of an ironclad, or in some other way helping men to\r\ncarry out those destructive instincts which they inherit from savage\r\nand brutal ancestors. But hereafter, when the representatives of the\r\nbrutality and savagery of our nature are held in proper disesteem, and\r\nthose who have added new enjoyments to life are justly valued, a high\r\nplace in the esteem of men will be accorded to him who has answered\r\none-half of the poet’s aspiration,\r\n\r\n    “Oh for the touch of a vanished hand,\r\n    And the sound of a voice that is still!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Since the present paper was written, M. Aurel de Ratti has\r\nmade some experiments which he regards as tending to show that there\r\nis no mechanical vibration. Thus, “when the cavities above and below\r\nthe iron disc of an ordinary telephone are filled with wadding, the\r\ninstrument will transmit and speak with undiminished clearness. On\r\nplacing a finger on the iron disc opposite the magnet, the instrument\r\nwill transmit and speak distinctly, only ceasing to act when sufficient\r\npressure is applied to bring plate and magnet into contact. Connecting\r\nthe centre of the disc by means of a short thread with an extremely\r\nsensitive membrane, no sound is given out by the latter when a message\r\nis transmitted. Bringing the iron cores of the double telephone in\r\ncontact with the disc, and pressing with the fingers against the\r\nplate on the other side, a weak current from a Daniell cell produced\r\na distinct click in the plate, and on drawing a wire from the cell\r\nover a file which formed part of the circuit, a rattling noise was\r\nproduced in the instrument.” If these experiments had been made\r\nbefore the phonograph was invented, they would have suggested the\r\nimpracticability of constructing any instrument which would do what the\r\nphonograph actually does, viz., cause sounds to be repeated by exciting\r\na merely mechanical vibration of the central part of a thin metallic\r\ndisc. But as the phonograph proves that this can actually be done,\r\nwe must conclude that M. Aurel de Ratti’s experiments will not bear\r\nthe interpretation he places upon them. They show, nevertheless, that\r\nexceedingly minute vibrations of probably a very small portion of the\r\ntelephonic disc suffice for the distinct transmission of vocal sounds.\r\nThis might indeed be inferred from the experiments of M. Demozet, of\r\nNantes, who finds that the vibrations of the transmitting telephone\r\nare in amplitude little more than 1-2000th those of the receiving\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE GORILLA AND OTHER APES._\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five centuries ago, a voyager called Hanno is said to\r\nhave sailed from Carthage, between the Pillars of Hercules—that is,\r\nthrough the Straits of Gibraltar—along the shores of Africa. “Passing\r\nthe Streams of Fire,” says the narrator, “we came to a bay called the\r\nHorn of the South. In the recess there was an island, like the first,\r\nhaving a lake, and in this there was another island full of wild men.\r\nBut much the greater part of them were women, with hairy bodies, whom\r\nthe interpreters called ‘Gorillas.’ Pursuing them, we were not able to\r\ntake the men; they all escaped, being able to climb the precipices;\r\nand defended themselves with pieces of rock. But three women, who bit\r\nand scratched those who led them, were not willing to follow. However,\r\nhaving killed them, we flayed them, and conveyed the skins to Carthage;\r\nfor we did not sail any further, as provisions began to fail.”[35]\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of many naturalists, the wild men of this story\r\nwere the anthropoid or manlike apes which are now called gorillas,\r\nrediscovered recently by Du Chaillu. The region inhabited by the\r\ngorillas is a well-wooded country, “extending about a thousand miles\r\nfrom the Gulf of Guinea southward,” says Gosse; “and as the gorilla\r\nis not found beyond these limits, so we may pretty conclusively infer\r\nthat the extreme point of Hanno was somewhere in this region.” I must\r\nconfess these inferences seem to me somewhat open to question, and\r\nthe account of Hanno’s voyage only interesting in its relation to the\r\ngorilla, as having suggested the name now given to this race of apes.\r\nIt is not probable that Hanno sailed much further than Sierra Leone;\r\naccording to Rennell, the island where the “wild men” were seen, was\r\nthe small island lying close to Sherbro, some seventy miles south of\r\nSierra Leone. To have reached the gorilla district after doubling Cape\r\nVerd—which is itself a point considerably south of the most southerly\r\ncity founded by Hanno—he would have had to voyage a distance exceeding\r\nthat of Cape Verd from Carthage. Nothing in the account suggests that\r\nthe portion of the voyage, after the colonizing was completed, had\r\nso great a range. The behaviour of the “wild men,” again, does not\r\ncorrespond with the known habits of the gorilla. The idea suggested\r\nis that of a species of anthropoid ape far inferior to the gorilla in\r\nstrength, courage, and ferocity.\r\n\r\nThe next accounts which have been regarded as relating to the gorilla\r\nare those given by Portuguese voyagers. These narratives have been\r\nreceived with considerable doubt, because in some parts they seem\r\nmanifestly fabulous. Thus the pictures representing apes show also\r\nhuge flying dragons with a crocodile’s head; and we have no reason for\r\nbelieving that batlike creatures like the pterodactyls of the greensand\r\nexisted in Africa or elsewhere so late as the time of the Portuguese\r\nvoyages of discovery. Purchas, in his history of Andrew Battell,\r\nspeaks of “a kinde of great apes, if they might so bee termed, of the\r\nheight of a man, but twice as bigge in feature of their limmes, with\r\nstrength proportionable, hairie all over, otherwise altogether like\r\nmen and women in their whole bodily shape, except that their legges\r\nhad no calves.” This description accords well with the peculiarities\r\nof gorillas, and may be regarded as the first genuine account of these\r\nanimals. Battell’s contemporaries called the apes so described Pongoes.\r\nIt is probable that in selecting the name Pongo for the young gorilla\r\nlately at the Westminster Aquarium, the proprietors of this interesting\r\ncreature showed a more accurate judgment of the meaning of Purchas’s\r\nnarrative than Du Chaillu showed of Hanno’s account, in calling the\r\ngreat anthropoid ape of the Gulf of Guinea a gorilla.\r\n\r\nI propose here briefly to sketch the peculiarities of the four apes\r\nwhich approach nearest in form to man—the gorilla, the chimpanzee, the\r\norang-outang, and the gibbon; and then, though not dealing generally\r\nwith the question of our relationship to these non-speaking (and, in\r\nsome respects, perhaps, “unspeakable”) animals, to touch on some points\r\nconnected with this question, and to point out some errors which are\r\nvery commonly entertained on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, in the first place, to point out that the terms “ape,”\r\n“baboon,” and “monkey” are no longer used as they were by the older\r\nnaturalists. Formerly the term “ape” was limited to tailless simians\r\nhaving no cheek-pouches, and the same number of teeth as man; the\r\nterm “baboon” to short-tailed simians with dog-shaped heads; and the\r\nterm “monkey,” unless used generically, to the long-tailed species.\r\nThis was the usage suggested by Ray, and adopted systematically\r\nthirty or forty years ago. But it is no longer followed, though no\r\nuniform classification has been substituted for the old arrangement.\r\nThus Mivart divides the apes into two classes—calling the first the\r\n_Simiadæ_, or Old World apes; and the second the _Cebidæ_, or New World\r\napes. He subdivides the _Simiadæ_ into (1) the _Siminæ_, including the\r\ngorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and gibbon; (2) the _Semnopithecinæ_; and\r\n(3) the _Cynopithecinæ_; neither of which subdivisions will occupy much\r\nof our attention here, save as respects the third subdivision of the\r\n_Cynopithecinæ_, viz., the _Cynocephali_, which includes the baboons.\r\nThe other great division, the _Cebidæ_, or New World apes, are for the\r\nmost part very unlike the Old World apes. None of them approach the\r\ngorilla or orang-outang in size; most of them are long-tailed; and the\r\nnumber and arrangement of the teeth is different. The feature, however,\r\nwhich most naturalists have selected as the characteristic distinction\r\nbetween the apes of the Old World and of the New World is the position\r\nof the nostrils. The former are called Catarhine, a word signifying\r\nthat the nostrils are directed downwards; the latter are called\r\nPlatyrhine, or broad-nosed. The nostrils of all the Old World apes are\r\nseparated by a narrow cartilaginous plate or septum, whereas the septum\r\nof the New World apes is broad. After the apes come, according to\r\nMivart’s classification, the half-apes or lemuroids.\r\n\r\nI ought, perhaps, to have mentioned that Mivart, in describing the\r\nlemuroids as the second sub-order of a great order of animals, the\r\nPrimates, speaks of a man as (zoologically speaking) belonging to the\r\nfirst sub-order. So that, in point of fact, the two sub-orders are the\r\nAnthropoids, including the Anthropos (man) and the Lemuroids, including\r\nthe lemur.\r\n\r\nThe classification here indicated will serve our present purpose\r\nvery well. But the reader is reminded that, as already mentioned,\r\nnaturalists do not adopt at present any uniform system of\r\nclassification. Moreover, the term _Simiadæ_ is usually employed—and\r\nwill be employed here—to represent the entire simian race, _i.e._,\r\nboth the Simiadæ and the Cebidæ of Mivart’s classification.\r\n\r\nAnd now, turning to the Anthropoid apes, we find ourselves at the\r\noutset confronted by the question, Which of the four apes, the gorilla,\r\nthe orang-outang, the chimpanzee, or the gibbon, is to be regarded\r\nas nearest to man in intelligence? So far as bodily configuration is\r\nconcerned, our opinion would vary according to the particular feature\r\nwhich we selected for consideration. But it will probably be admitted\r\nthat intelligence should be the characteristic by which our opinions\r\nshould be guided.\r\n\r\nThe gibbon may be dismissed at once, though, as will presently appear,\r\nthere are some features in which this ape resembles man more closely\r\nthan either the gorilla, the orang-outang, or the chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nThe gorilla must, I fear, be summarily ejected from the position of\r\nhonour to which he has been raised by many naturalists. Though the\r\ngorilla is a much larger animal than the chimpanzee, his brain barely\r\nequals the chimpanzee’s in mass. It is also less fully developed in\r\nfront. In fact Gratiolet asserts that of all the broad-chested apes,\r\nthe gorilla is—so far as brain character is concerned—the lowest\r\nand most degraded. He regards the gorilla’s brain as only a more\r\nadvanced form of that of the brutal baboons, while the orang’s brain\r\nis the culminating form of the gibbon type, and the chimpanzee’s the\r\nculminating form of the macaque type. This does not dispose of the\r\ndifficulty very satisfactorily, however, because it remains to be shown\r\nwhether the gibbon type and the macaque type are superior as types to\r\nthe baboon types. But it may suffice to remark that the baboons are\r\nall brutal and ferocious, whereas the gibbons are comparatively gentle\r\nanimals, and the macaques docile and even playful. It may be questioned\r\nwhether brutality and ferocity should be regarded as necessarily\r\nremoving the gorilla further from man; because it is certain that the\r\nraces of man which approach nearest to the anthropoid apes, with which\r\nraces the comparison should assuredly be made, are characterized by\r\nthese very qualities, brutality and ferocity. Intelligence must be\r\notherwise gauged. Probably the average proportion of the brain’s weight\r\nto that of the entire body, and the complexity of the structure of\r\nthe brain, would afford the best means of deciding the question. But,\r\nunfortunately, we have very unsatisfactory evidence on these points.\r\nThe naturalists who have based opinions on such evidence as has been\r\nobtained, seem to overlook the poverty of the evidence. Knowing as we\r\ndo how greatly the human brain varies in size and complexity, not only\r\nin different races, but in different individuals of the same race, it\r\nappears unsatisfactory in the extreme to regard the average of the\r\nbrains of each simian species hitherto examined as presenting the true\r\naverage cerebral capacity for each species.\r\n\r\nStill it seems tolerably clear that the choice as to the race of apes\r\nwhich must be regarded as first in intelligence, and therefore as on\r\nthe whole the most manlike, rests between the orang-outang and the\r\nchimpanzee. “In the world of science, as in that of politics,” said\r\nProfessor Rolleston in 1862, “France and England have occasionally\r\ndiffered as to their choice between rival candidates for royalty. If\r\neither hereditary claims or personal merits affect at all the right\r\nof succession, beyond a question the gorilla is but a pretender, and\r\none or other of the two (other) candidates the true prince. There is\r\na graceful as well as an ungraceful way of withdrawing from a false\r\nposition, and the British public will adopt the graceful course\r\nby accepting forthwith and henceforth the French candidate”—the\r\norang-outang. If this were intended as prophecy, it has not been\r\nfulfilled by the event, for the gorilla is still regarded by most\r\nBritish naturalists as the ape which comes on the whole nearest to man;\r\nbut probably, in saying “the British public will adopt the graceful\r\ncourse” in accepting the orang-outang as “the king of the Simiadæ,”\r\nProfessor Rolleston meant only that that course would be graceful if\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of the gorilla, the chimpanzee was usually\r\nregarded as next to man in the scale of the animal creation. It was\r\nCuvier who first maintained the claim of the orang-outang to this\r\nposition. Cuvier’s opinion was based on the greater development\r\nof the orang-outang’s brain, and the height of its forehead. But\r\nthese marks of superiority belong to the orang only when young. The\r\nadult orang seems to be inferior, or at least not superior, to the\r\nchimpanzee as respects cerebral formation, and in other respects seems\r\nless to resemble man. The proportions of his body, his long arms,\r\nhigh shoulders, deformed neck, and imperfect ears are opposed to its\r\nclaims to be regarded as manlike. In all these respects, save one, the\r\nchimpanzee seems to be greatly its superior. (The ear of the chimpanzee\r\nis large, and not placed as with us: that of the gorilla is much more\r\nlike man’s.)\r\n\r\nAs to the intelligence exhibited in the conduct of the chimpanzee and\r\norang-outang, various opinions may be formed according to the various\r\ncircumstances under which the animals are observed. The following\r\nhas been quoted in evidence of the superiority of the chimpanzee in\r\nthis respect:—“About fifty years ago, a young chimpanzee and an\r\norang-outang of about the same age were exhibited together at the\r\nEgyptian Hall. The chimpanzee, though in a declining state of health,\r\nand rendered peevish and irritable by bodily suffering, exhibited\r\nmuch superior marks of intelligence to his companion; he was active,\r\nquick, and observant of everything that passed around him; no new\r\nvisitor entered the apartment in which he was kept, and no one left it,\r\nwithout attracting his attention. The orang-outang, on the contrary,\r\nexhibited a melancholy and a disregard of passing occurrences almost\r\namounting to apathy; and though in the enjoyment of better health, was\r\nevidently much inferior to his companion in quickness and observation.\r\nOn one occasion, when the animals were dining on potatoes and boiled\r\nchicken, and surrounded as usual with a large party of visitors, the\r\norang-outang allowed her plate to be taken without exhibiting the least\r\napparent concern. Not so, however, the chimpanzee. We took advantage\r\nof an opportunity when his head was turned (to observe a person coming\r\nin) to secrete his plate also. For a few seconds he looked round to\r\nsee what had become of it, but, not finding it, began to pout and fret\r\nexactly like a spoiled child, and perceiving a young lady, who happened\r\nto be standing near him, laughing, perhaps suspecting her to be the\r\ndelinquent, he flew at her in the greatest rage, and would probably\r\nhave bitten her had she not got beyond his reach. Upon having his plate\r\nrestored, he took care to prevent the repetition of the joke by holding\r\nit firmly with one hand, while he fed himself with the other.”\r\n\r\nThis story can hardly be regarded as deciding the question in favour\r\nof the chimpanzee. Many animals, admittedly far inferior to the lowest\r\norder of monkeys in intelligence, show watchfulness over their food,\r\nand as much ill-temper when deprived of it, and as much anxiety to\r\nrecover it, as this chimpanzee did. A hundred cases in point might\r\nreadily be cited.[36]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the soundest opinion respecting the relative position of\r\nthe gorilla, chimpanzee, and orang-outang with reference to man, is\r\nthat which places the gorilla nearest to the lower tribes of man now\r\ninhabiting Africa, the chimpanzee approximating, but not so closely,\r\nto higher African tribes, and the orang-outang approximating, but\r\nstill less closely, to Asiatic tribes. It appears to me that, whatever\r\nweight naturalists may attach to those details in which the gorilla\r\nand the chimpanzee are more removed from man than the orang, no one\r\nwho takes a _general_ view of these three races of anthropoid apes can\r\nhesitate to regard the gorilla as that which, on the whole, approaches\r\nnearest to man; but it is to a much lower race of man that the gorilla\r\napproximates, so that the chimpanzee and the orang-outang may fairly be\r\nregarded as higher in the scale of animal life.\r\n\r\nIf we consider young specimens of the three animals, which is, on\r\nthe whole, the safest way of forming an opinion, we are unmistakably\r\nled, in my judgment, to such a conclusion. I have seen three or four\r\nyoung chimpanzees, two young orangs, and the young gorilla lately\r\nexhibited at the Aquarium (where he could be directly compared with\r\nthe chimpanzee), and I cannot hesitate to pronounce Pongo altogether\r\nthe most human of the three. A young chimpanzee reminds one rather of\r\nan old man than of a child, and the same may be said of young orangs;\r\nbut the young gorilla unmistakably reminds one of the young negro.\r\nRepeatedly, while watching Pongo, I was reminded of the looks and\r\nbehaviour of young negroes whom I had seen in America, though not able\r\nin every case to fix definitely on the feature of resemblance which\r\nrecalled the negro to my mind. (The reader is, doubtless, familiar with\r\nhalf-remembered traits such as those I refer to—traits, for instance,\r\nsuch as assure you that a person belongs to some county or district,\r\nthough you may be unable to say what feature, expression, or gesture\r\nsuggests the idea.) One circumstance may be specially noted, not only\r\nas frequently recurring, but as illustrating the traits on which the\r\nresemblance of the gorilla (when young, at any rate) to the negro\r\ndepends. A negro turns his eyes where a Caucasian would turn his head.\r\nThe peculiarity is probably a relic of savage life; for the savage,\r\nwhether engaged in war or in the chase, avoids, as far as possible,\r\nevery movement of body or limb. Pongo looked in this way. When he thus\r\ncast his black eyes sideways at an object I found myself reminded\r\nirresistibly of the ways of the watchful negro waiters at an American\r\nhotel. Certainly there is little in the movements of the chimpanzee to\r\nremind one of any kind of human child. He is impish; but not the most\r\nimpish child of any race or tribe ever had ways, I should suppose,\r\nresembling his.\r\n\r\nThe four anthropoid apes, full grown and in their native wilds, differ\r\ngreatly from each other in character. It may be well to consider their\r\nvarious traits, endeavouring to ascertain how far diversities existing\r\namong them may be traced to the conditions under which the four orders\r\nsubsist.\r\n\r\nThe gorilla occupies a well-wooded country extending along the coast\r\nof Africa from the Gulf of Guinea southwards across the equator. When\r\nfull grown he is equal to a man in height, but much more powerfully\r\nbuilt. “Of specimens shot by Du Chaillu,” says Rymer Jones, “the\r\nlargest male seems to have been at least six feet two in height;\r\nso that, making allowance for the shortness of the lower limbs, the\r\ndimensions of a full-grown male may be said to equal those of a man of\r\neight or nine feet high, and it is only in their length that the lower\r\nlimbs are disproportionate to the gigantic trunk. In the thickness and\r\nsolidity of their bones, and in the strength of their muscles, these\r\nlimbs are quite in keeping with the rest of the body. When upright,\r\nthe gorilla’s arms reach to his knees; the hind hands are wide, and of\r\namazing size and power; the great toe or thumb measures six inches in\r\ncircumference; the palms and soles, and the naked part of the face, are\r\nof an intense black colour, as is also the breast. The other parts are\r\nthickly clothed with hair of an iron grey, except the head, on which it\r\nis reddish brown, and the arms, where it is long and nearly black. The\r\nfemale is wholly tinged with red.”\r\n\r\nDu Chaillu gives the following account of the aspect of the gorilla\r\nin his native woods:—“Suddenly, as we were yet creeping along in a\r\nsilence which made even a heavy breath seem loud and distinct, the\r\nwoods were at once filled with a tremendous barking roar; then the\r\nunderbrush swayed rapidly just ahead, and presently stood before us an\r\nimmense gorilla. He had gone through the jungle on all-fours; but when\r\nhe saw our party he erected himself and looked us boldly in the face.\r\nHe stood about a dozen yards from us, and was a sight I think I shall\r\nnever forget. Nearly six feet high (he proved four inches shorter),\r\nwith immense body, huge chest, and great muscular arms, with fiercely\r\nglaring, large, deep-grey eyes, and a hellish expression of face, which\r\nseemed to me some night-mare vision; thus stood before us the king of\r\nthe African forest. He was not afraid of us; he stood there and beat\r\nhis breasts with his large fists till it resounded like an immense bass\r\ndrum (which is their mode of bidding defiance), meantime giving vent to\r\nroar after roar.”\r\n\r\nThe gorilla is a fruit-eater, but as fierce as the most carnivorous\r\nanimals. He is said to show an enraged enmity against men, probably\r\nbecause he has found them not only hostile to himself, but successful\r\nin securing the fruits which the gorilla loves, for he shows a similar\r\nhatred to the elephant, which also seeks these fruits. We are told\r\nthat when the gorilla “sees the elephant busy with his trunk among\r\nthe twigs, he instantly regards this as an infraction of the laws\r\nof property, and, dropping silently down to the bough, he suddenly\r\nbrings his club smartly down on the sensitive finger of the elephant’s\r\nproboscis, and drives off the alarmed animal trumpeting shrilly with\r\nrage and pain.” His enmity to man is more terribly manifested. “The\r\nyoung athletic negroes in their ivory-haunts,” says Gosse, “well know\r\nthe prowess of the gorilla. He does not, like the lion, sullenly\r\nretreat on seeing them, but swings himself rapidly down to the lower\r\nbranches, courting the conflict, and clutches the nearest of his\r\nenemies. The hideous aspect of his visage (his green eyes flashing\r\nwith rage) is heightened by the thick and prominent brows being drawn\r\nspasmodically up and down, with the hair erect, causing a horrible\r\nand fiendish scowl. Weapons are torn from their possessor’s grasp,\r\ngun-barrels bent and crushed in by the powerful hands and vice-like\r\nteeth of the enraged brute. More horrid still, however, is the sudden\r\nand unexpected fate which is often inflicted by him. Two negroes will\r\nbe walking through one of the woodland paths unsuspicious of evil, when\r\nin an instant one misses his companion, or turns to see him drawn up\r\nin the air with a convulsed choking cry, and in a few minutes dropped\r\nto the ground, a strangled corpse. The terrified survivor gazes up,\r\nand meets the grin and glare of the fiendish giant, who, watching his\r\nopportunity, had suddenly put down his immense hind hand, caught the\r\nwretch by the neck with resistless power, and dropped him only when he\r\nceased to struggle.”\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee inhabits the region from Sierra Leone to the southern\r\nconfines of Angola, possibly as far as Cape Negro, so that his domain\r\nincludes within it that of the gorilla. He attains almost the same\r\nheight as the gorilla when full grown, but is far less powerfully\r\nbuilt. In fact, in general proportions the chimpanzee approaches man\r\nmore nearly than does any other animal. His body is covered with long\r\nblack coarse hair, thickest on the head, shoulders, and back, and\r\nrather thin on the breast and belly. The face is dark brown and naked,\r\nas are the ears, except that long black whiskers adorn the animal’s\r\ncheeks. The hair on the forearms is directed towards the elbows,\r\nas is the case with all the anthropoid apes, and with man himself.\r\nThis hair forms, where it meets the hair from the upper arm, a small\r\nruff about the elbow joint. The chimpanzees live in society in the\r\nwoods, constructing huts from the branches and foliage of trees to\r\nprotect themselves against the sun and heavy rains. It is said by some\r\ntravellers that the chimpanzee walks upright in its native woods, but\r\nthis is doubtful; though certainly the formation of the toes better\r\nfits them to stand upright than either the gorilla or the orang. They\r\narm themselves with clubs, and unite to defend themselves against the\r\nattacks of wild beasts, “compelling,” it is said, “even the elephant\r\nhimself to abandon the districts in which they reside.” We learn that\r\n“it is dangerous for men to enter their forests, unless in companies\r\nand well armed; women in particular are often said to be carried away\r\nby these animals, and one negress is reported to have lived among them\r\nfor the space of three years, during which time they treated her with\r\nuniform kindness, but always prevented any attempt on her part to\r\nescape. When the negroes leave a fire in the woods, it is said that\r\nthe chimpanzees will gather round and warm themselves at the blaze,\r\nbut they have not sufficient intelligence to keep it alive by fresh\r\nsupplies of fuel.”\r\n\r\nThe orang-outang inhabits Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and other islands\r\nof the Indian coast. He attains a greater height than the gorilla,\r\nbut, though very powerful and active, would probably not be a match\r\nfor the gorilla in a single combat. His arms are by comparison as\r\nwell as actually much longer. Whereas the gorilla’s reach only to the\r\nknees, the arms of the orang-outang almost reach the ground when the\r\nanimal is standing upright. The orang does not often assume an upright\r\nattitude, however. “It seldom attempts to walk on the hind feet alone,\r\nand when it does the hands are invariably employed for the purpose of\r\nsteadying its tottering equilibrium, touching the ground lightly on\r\neach side as it proceeds, and by this means recovering the lost balance\r\nof the body.” The gorilla uses his hands differently. He can scarcely\r\nbe said to walk on all-fours, because he does not place the inside of\r\nthe hand on the ground, but walks on the knuckles, evidently trying\r\nto keep the fore part of the body as high as possible. “The muzzle is\r\nsomewhat long, the mouth ill-shaped, the lips thin and protuberant; the\r\nears are very small, the chin scarcely recognizable, and the nose only\r\nto be recognized by the nostrils. The face, ears, and inside of the\r\nhands of the orang are naked and of a brick-red colour; the fore parts\r\nare also but thinly covered with hair; but the head, shoulders, back,\r\nand extremities are thickly clothed with long hair of dark wine-red\r\ncolour, directed forwards on the crown of the head and upwards towards\r\nthe elbows on the forearms.”\r\n\r\nThe orang-outang changes remarkably in character and appearance as he\r\napproaches full growth. “Though exhibiting in early youth a rotundity\r\nof the cranium and a height of forehead altogether peculiar, and\r\naccompanied at the same time with a gentleness of disposition and\r\na gravity of manners which contrast strongly with the petulant and\r\nirascible temper of the lower orders of quadrumanous mammals, the\r\norang-outang in its adult state is even remarkable for the flatness\r\nof its retiring forehead, the great development of the superorbital\r\nand occipital crests, the prominence of its jaws, the remarkable\r\nsize of its canine teeth, and the whole form of the skull, which\r\nfrom the globular shape of the human head, as in the young specimen,\r\nassumes all the forms and characters belonging to that of a large\r\ncarnivorous animal. The extraordinary contrasts thus presented in the\r\nform of the skull at different epochs of the same animal’s life were\r\nlong considered as the characters of distinct species; nor was it\r\ntill intermediate forms were obtained, exhibiting in some degree the\r\npeculiarities of both extremes, that they were finally recognized as\r\ndistinguishing different periods of growth only.”\r\n\r\nUnlike the gorilla, which attacks man with peculiar malignity, and the\r\nchimpanzee, which when in large troops assails those who approach its\r\nretreats, the orang, even in its adult state, seems not to be dangerous\r\nunless attacked. Even then he does not always show great ferocity.\r\nThe two following anecdotes illustrate well its character. The first\r\nis from the pen of Dr. Abel Clarke (fifth volume of the “Asiatic\r\nResearches”); the other is from Wallace’s interesting work, “The Malay\r\nArchipelago.” An orang-outang fully seven feet high was discovered\r\nby the company of a merchant ship, at a place called Ramboon, on the\r\nnorth-west coast of Sumatra, on a spot where there were few trees\r\nand little cultivated ground. “It was evident that he had come from\r\na distance, for his legs were covered with mud up to the knees, and\r\nthe natives were unacquainted with him. On the approach of the boat’s\r\ncrew he came down from the tree in which he was discovered, and made\r\nfor a clump at some distance; exhibiting, as he moved, the appearance\r\nof a tall man-like figure, covered with shining brown hair, walking\r\nerect, with a waddling gait, but sometimes accelerating his motion\r\nwith his hands, and occasionally impelling himself forward with the\r\nbough of a tree. His motion on the ground was evidently not his natural\r\nmode of progression, for, even when assisted by his hands and the\r\nbough, it was slow and vacillating; it was necessary to see him among\r\nthe trees to estimate his strength and agility. On being driven to a\r\nsmall clump, he gained by one spring a very lofty branch and bounded\r\nfrom one branch to another with the swiftness of a common monkey, his\r\nprogress being as rapid as that of a swift horse. After receiving\r\nfive balls his exertions relaxed, and, reclining exhausted against a\r\nbranch, he vomited a quantity of blood. The ammunition of the hunters\r\nbeing by this time exhausted, they were obliged to fell the tree\r\nin order to obtain him; but what was their surprise to see him, as\r\nthe tree was falling, effect his retreat to another, with seemingly\r\nundiminished vigour! In fact, they were obliged to cut down all the\r\ntrees before they could force him to combat his enemies on the ground,\r\nand when finally overpowered by numbers, and nearly in a dying state,\r\nhe seized a spear made of supple wood, which would have withstood the\r\nstrength of the stoutest man, and broke it like a reed. It was stated,\r\nby those who aided in his death, that the human-like expression of\r\nhis countenance and his piteous manner of placing his hands over his\r\nwounds, distressed their feelings so as almost to make them question\r\nthe nature of the act they were committing. He was seven feet high,\r\nwith a broad expanded chest and narrow waist. His chin was fringed\r\nwith a beard that curled neatly on each side, and formed an ornamental\r\nrather than a frightful appendage to his visage. His arms were long\r\neven in proportion to his height, but his legs were much shorter. Upon\r\nthe whole, he was a wonderful beast to behold, and there was more about\r\nhim to excite amazement than fear. His hair was smooth and glossy, and\r\nhis whole appearance showed him to be in the full vigour of his youth\r\nand strength.” On the whole, the narrative seems to suggest a remark\r\nsimilar to one applied by Washington Irving to the followers of Ojeda\r\nand their treatment of the (so-called) Indians of South America, “we\r\nconfess we feel a momentary doubt whether the arbitrary appellation of\r\n‘brute’ is always applied to the right party.”\r\n\r\nThe other story also presents man as at least as brutal as the orang\r\nconcerned in the event. “A few miles down the river,” says Wallace,\r\n“there is a Dyak house, and the inhabitants saw a large orang feeding\r\non the young shoots of a palm by the river-side. On being alarmed he\r\nretreated towards the jungle which was close by, and a number of the\r\nmen, armed with spears and choppers, ran out to intercept him. The man\r\nwho was in front tried to run his spear through the animal’s body; but\r\nthe orang seized it in his hands, and in an instant got hold of the\r\nman’s arm, which he seized in his mouth, making his teeth meet in\r\nthe flesh above the elbow, which he tore and lacerated in a dreadful\r\nmanner. Had not the others been close behind, the man would have been\r\nmore seriously injured, if not killed, as he was quite powerless; but\r\nthey soon destroyed the creature with their spears and choppers. The\r\nman remained ill for a long time, and never fully recovered the use of\r\nhis arm.”\r\n\r\nThe term gibbon includes several varieties of tail-less, long-armed,\r\ncatarhine apes. The largest variety, called the siamang, need alone be\r\ndescribed here.\r\n\r\nThe siamang inhabits Sumatra. It presents several points of resemblance\r\nto the orang-outang, but is also in several respects strongly\r\ndistinguished from that animal. The arms are longer even than the\r\norang’s, and the peculiar use which the orang makes of his long arms\r\nis more strikingly shown in the progression of the long-armed siamang,\r\nfor the body inclining slightly forward, when the animal is on level\r\nground the long arms are used somewhat like crutches, and they advance\r\nby jerks resembling the hobbling of a lame man whom fear compels\r\nto make an extraordinary effort. The skull is small, and much more\r\ndepressed than that of the orang or chimpanzee. The face is naked and\r\nblack, straggling red hairs marking the eyebrows. The eyes are deeply\r\nsunk, a peculiarity which, by the way, seems characteristic of arboreal\r\ncreatures generally;[37] the nose broad and flat, with wide-open\r\nnostrils; the cheeks sunk under high cheekbones; the chin almost\r\nrudimentary. “The hair over the whole body is thick, long, and of a\r\nglossy black colour, much closer on the shoulders, back, and limbs than\r\non the belly, which, particularly in the females, is nearly naked. The\r\nears are entirely concealed by the hair of the head; they are naked,\r\nand, like all the other naked parts, of a deep black colour. Beneath\r\nthe chin there is a large, bare sac, of a lax and oily appearance,\r\nwhich is distended with air when the animal cries, and in that state\r\nresembles an enormous goitre. It is similar to that possessed by\r\nthe orang-outang, and undoubtedly assists in swelling the volume of\r\nthe voice, and producing those astounding cries which, according to\r\nDuvancelle’s account, may be heard at the distance of several miles.”\r\nThis, however, may be doubted, for M. Duvancelle himself remarks of the\r\nwouwou, that, “though deprived of the guttural sac so remarkable in the\r\nsiamang, its cry is very nearly the same; so that it would appear that\r\nthis organ does not produce the effect of increasing the sound usually\r\nattributed to it, or else that it must be replaced in the wouwou by\r\nsome analogous formation.”\r\n\r\nThe habits of the siamang are interesting, especially in their bearing\r\non the relationship between the various orders of anthropoid apes\r\nand man; for, though the gibbon is unquestionably the lowest of the\r\nfour orders of the anthropoid apes in intelligence, it possesses\r\nsome characteristics which bring it nearer to man (so far as they\r\nare concerned) than any of its congeners. The chief authorities\r\nrespecting the ways of the siamang are the French naturalists Diard and\r\nDuvancelle, and the late Sir Stamford Raffles.\r\n\r\nThe siamangs generally assemble in large troops, “conducted, it is\r\nsaid, by a chief, whom the Malays believe to be invulnerable, probably\r\nbecause he is more agile, powerful, and difficult to capture than the\r\nrest.” “Thus united,” proceeds M. Duvancelle (in a letter addressed\r\nto Cuvier), “the siamangs salute the rising and the setting sun with\r\nthe most terrific cries” (like sun-worshippers), “which may be heard\r\nat the distance of many miles, and which, when near, stun when they\r\ndo not frighten. This is the morning call of the mountain Malays; but\r\nto the inhabitants of the town, who are unaccustomed to it, it is an\r\nunsupportable annoyance. By way of compensation, the siamangs keep\r\na profound silence during the day, unless when interrupted in their\r\nrepose or their sleep. They are slow and heavy in their gait, wanting\r\nconfidence when they climb and agility when they leap, so that they may\r\nbe easily caught when they can be surprised. But nature, in depriving\r\nthem of the means of readily escaping danger, has endowed them with a\r\nvigilance which rarely fails them; and if they hear a noise which is\r\nunusual to them, even at the distance of a mile, fright seizes them and\r\nthey immediately take flight. When surprised on the ground, however,\r\nthey may be captured without resistance, either overwhelmed with fear\r\nor conscious of their weakness and the impossibility of escaping. At\r\nfirst, indeed, they endeavour to avoid their pursuers by flight, and\r\nit is then that their want of skill in this exercise becomes most\r\napparent.”\r\n\r\n“However numerous the troop may be, if one is wounded it is immediately\r\nabandoned by the rest, unless, indeed, it happen to be a young one.\r\nThen the mother, who either carries it or follows close behind, stops,\r\nfalls with it, and, uttering the most frightful cries, precipitates\r\nherself upon the common enemy with open mouth and arms extended. But it\r\nis manifest that these animals are not made for combat; they neither\r\nknow how to deal nor to shun a blow. Nor is their maternal affection\r\ndisplayed only in moments of danger. The care which the females bestow\r\nupon their offspring is so tender and even refined, that one would be\r\nalmost tempted to attribute the sentiment to a rational rather than\r\nan instinctive process. It is a curious and interesting spectacle,\r\nwhich a little precaution has sometimes enabled me to witness, to see\r\nthese females carry their young to the river, wash their faces in\r\nspite of their outcries, wipe and dry them, and altogether bestow\r\nupon their cleanliness a time and attention that in many cases the\r\nchildren of our own species might well envy. The Malays related a\r\nfact to me, which I doubted at first, but which I consider to be in\r\na great measure confirmed by my own subsequent observations. It is\r\nthat the young siamangs, whilst yet too weak to go alone, are always\r\ncarried by individuals of their own sex, by their fathers if they are\r\nmales, and by their mothers if females. I have also been assured that\r\nthese animals frequently become the prey of the tiger, from the same\r\nspecies of fascination which serpents are said to exercise over birds,\r\nsquirrels, and other small animals. Servitude, however long, seems\r\nto have no effect in modifying the characteristic defects of this\r\nape—his stupidity, sluggishness, and awkwardness. It is true that a\r\nfew days suffice to make him as gentle and contented as he was before\r\nwild and distrustful; but, constitutionally timid, he never acquires\r\nthe familiarity of other apes, and even his submission appears to be\r\nrather the result of extreme apathy than of any degree of confidence or\r\naffection. He is almost equally insensible to good or bad treatment;\r\ngratitude and revenge are equally strange to him.”\r\n\r\nWe have next to consider certain points connected with the theory of\r\nthe relationship between man and the anthropoid apes. It is hardly\r\nnecessary for me to say, perhaps, that in thus dealing with a subject\r\nrequiring for its independent investigation the life-long study of\r\ndepartments of science which are outside those in which I have taken\r\nspecial interest, I am not pretending to advance my opinion as of\r\nweight in matters as yet undetermined by zoologists. But it has always\r\nseemed to me, that when those who have made special study of a subject\r\ncollect and publish the result of their researches, and a body of\r\nevidence is thus made available for the general body scientific, the\r\nfacts can be advantageously considered by students of other branches\r\nof science, so only that, in leaving for a while their own subject,\r\nthey do not depart from the true scientific method, and that they are\r\nspecially careful to distinguish what has been really ascertained from\r\nwhat is only surmised with a greater or less degree of probability.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, I would call attention to some very common\r\nmistakes respecting the Darwinian theory of the Descent of Man. I\r\ndo not refer here to ordinary misconceptions respecting the theory\r\nof natural selection. To say the truth, those who have not passed\r\nbeyond _this_ stage of error,—those who still confound the theory of\r\nnatural selection with the Lamarckian and other theories (or rather\r\nhypotheses[38]) of evolution,—are not as yet in a position to deal\r\nwith our present subject, and may be left out of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe errors to which I refer are in the main included in the following\r\nstatement. It is supposed by many, perhaps by most, that according to\r\nDarwin man is descended from one or other of the races of anthropoid\r\napes; and that the various orders and sub-orders of apes and monkeys\r\nat present existing can be arranged in a series gradually approaching\r\nmore and more nearly to man, and indicating the various steps (or some\r\nof them, for gaps exist in the series) by which man was developed.\r\nNothing can be plainer, however, than Darwin’s contradiction of this\r\ngenealogy for the human races. Not only does he not for a moment\r\ncountenance the belief that the present races of monkeys and apes can\r\nbe arranged in a series gradually approximating more and more nearly to\r\nman, not only does he reject the belief that man is descended from any\r\npresent existing anthropoid ape, but he even denies that the progenitor\r\nof man resembled any known ape. “We must not fall into the error of\r\nsupposing,” he says, “that the early progenitor of the whole simian\r\nstock, including man, was identical with, or even closely resembled,\r\nany existing ape or monkey.”\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, though it may seem somewhat bold to express this\r\nopinion of the views of a naturalist so deservedly eminent as Mr.\r\nMivart, that in his interesting little treatise, “Man and Apes,”—a\r\ntreatise which may be described as opposed to Darwin’s special views\r\nbut not generally opposed to the theory of evolution,—he misapprehends\r\nDarwin’s position in this respect. For he arrives at the conclusion\r\nthat if the Darwinian theory is sound, then “low down” (_i.e._, far\r\nremote) “in the scale of Primates” (tri-syllabic) “was an ancestral\r\nform so like man that it might well be called an _homunculus_; and we\r\nhave the virtual pre-existence of man’s body supposed, in order to\r\naccount for the actual first appearance of that body as we know it—a\r\nsupposition manifestly absurd if put forward as an explanation.”[39]\r\n\r\nHow, then, according to the Darwinian theory, is man related to the\r\nmonkey? The answer to this question is simply that the relationship\r\nis the same in kind, though not the same in degree, as that by which\r\nthe most perfect Caucasian race is related to the lowest race of\r\nAustralian, or Papuan, or Bosjesman savages. No one supposes that one\r\nof these races of savages could by any process of evolution, however\r\nlong-continued, be developed into a race resembling the Caucasian\r\nin bodily and mental attributes. Nor does any one suppose that the\r\nsavage progenitor of the Caucasian races was identical with, or even\r\nclosely resembled, any existing race of savages. Yet we recognize in\r\nthe lowest forms of savage man our blood relations. In other words, it\r\nis generally believed that if our genealogy, and that of any existing\r\nrace of savages, could be traced back through all its reticulations,\r\nwe should at length reach a race whose blood we share with that race.\r\nIt is also generally believed (though for my own part I think the\r\nlogical consequences of the principle underlying all theories of\r\nevolution is in reality opposed to the belief) that, by tracing the\r\ngenealogical reticulations still further back, we should at length\r\narrive at a single race from which all the present races of man and no\r\nother animals have descended. The Darwinian faith with respect to men\r\nand monkeys is precisely analogous. It is believed that the genealogy\r\nof every existent race of monkeys, if traced back, would lead us to\r\na race whose blood we share with that race of monkeys; and—which is\r\nat once a wider and a more precise proposition—that, as Darwin puts\r\nit, “the two main divisions of the Simiadæ, namely, the catarhine\r\nand platyrhine monkeys, with their sub-groups, have all proceeded\r\nfrom some one extremely ancient progenitor.” This proposition is\r\nmanifestly wider. I call it also more precise, because it implies, and\r\nis evidently intended by Darwin to signify, that from that extremely\r\nancient progenitor no race outside the two great orders of Simiadæ have\r\neven partially _descended_, though other races share with the Simiadæ\r\ndescent from some still more remote race of progenitors.\r\n\r\nThis latter point, however, is not related specially to the common\r\nerrors respecting the Darwinian theory which I have indicated above,\r\nexcept in so far as it is a detail of the actual Darwinian theory.\r\nI would, in passing, point out that, like the detail referred to in\r\nconnection with the relationship of the various races of man, this\r\none is not logically deducible from the theory of evolution. In fact,\r\nI have sometimes thought that the principal difficulties of that\r\ntheory arise from this unnecessary and not logically sound doctrine.\r\nI pointed out, rather more than three years ago, in an article “On\r\nsome of our Blood Relations,” in a weekly scientific journal, that the\r\nanalogy between the descent of races and the descent of individual\r\nmembers of any race, requires us rather to believe that the remote\r\nprogenitor of the human race and the Simiadæ has had its share—though\r\na less share—in the generation of other races related to these in more\r\nor less remote degrees. I may perhaps most conveniently present the\r\nconsiderations on which I based this conclusion, by means of a somewhat\r\nfamiliar illustration:—\r\n\r\nLet us take two persons, brother and sister (whom let us call the\r\npair A), as analogues of the human race. Then these two have four\r\ngreat-grandparents on the father’s side, and four on the mother’s side.\r\nAll these may be regarded as equally related to the pair A. Now, let us\r\nsuppose that the descendants of the four families of great-grandparents\r\nintermarry, no marriages being in any case made outside these families,\r\nand that the descendants in the same generation as the pair A are\r\nregarded as corresponding to the entire order of the Simiadæ, the\r\npair A representing, as already agreed, the race of man, and all\r\nfamilies outside the descendants of the four great-grandparental\r\nfamilies corresponding to orders of animals more distantly related\r\nthan the Simiadæ to man. Then we have what corresponds (so far as\r\nour illustration is concerned) to Darwin’s views respecting man\r\nand the Simiadæ, and animals lower in the scale of life. The first\r\ncousins of the pair A may be taken as representing the anthropoid\r\napes; the second cousins as representing the lemurs or half-apes; the\r\nthird cousins as representing the platyrhine or American apes. The\r\nentire family—including the pair A, representing man—is descended\r\nalso, in accordance with the Darwinian view, from a single family of\r\nprogenitors, no outside families sharing _descent_, though all share\r\n_blood_, with that family.\r\n\r\nBut manifestly, this is an entirely artificial and improbable\r\narrangement in the case of families. The eight grandparents _might_\r\nbe so removed in circumstances from surrounding families—so much\r\nsuperior to them, let us say—that neither they nor any of their\r\ndescendants would intermarry with these inferior families: and thus\r\nnone of their great-grandchildren would share descent from some other\r\nstock contemporary with the great-grandparents; or—which is the same\r\nthing, but seen in another light—none of the contemporaries of the\r\ngreat-grandchildren would share descent from the eight grandparents.\r\nBut so complete a separation of the family from surrounding families\r\nwould be altogether exceptional and unlikely. For, even assuming the\r\neight families to be originally very markedly distinguished from all\r\nsurrounding families, yet families rise and fall, marry unequally, and\r\nwithin the range of a few generations a wide disparity of blood and\r\ncondition appears among the descendants of any group of families. So\r\nthat, in point of fact, the relations assumed to subsist between man,\r\nthe Simiadæ, and lower animal forms, corresponds to an unusual and\r\nimprobable set of relations among families of several persons. Either,\r\nthen, the relations of families must be regarded as not truly analogous\r\nto the relations of races, which no evolutionist would assert, or else\r\nwe must adopt a somewhat different view of the relationship between\r\nman, the Simiadæ, and inferior animals.\r\n\r\nOne other illustration may serve not only to make my argument clearer,\r\nbut also, by presenting an actual case, to enforce the conclusion to\r\nwhich it points.\r\n\r\nWe know that the various races of man are related together more or\r\nless closely, that some are purer than others, and that one or two\r\nclaim almost absolute purity. Now, if we take one of these last, as,\r\nfor instance, the Jewish race, and trace the race backwards to its\r\norigin, we find it, according to tradition, carried back to twelve\r\nfamilies, the twelve sons of Jacob and their respective wives. (We\r\ncannot go further back because the wives of Jacob’s sons must be taken\r\ninto account, and they were not descended from Abraham or Isaac and\r\ntheir wives only,—in fact, could not have been.) If the descendants\r\nof those twelve families had never intermarried with outside families\r\nin such sort that the descendants of such mixed families came to\r\nbe regarded as true Hebrews, we should have in the Hebrews a race\r\ncorresponding to the Simiadæ as regarded by Darwin, _i.e._, a race\r\nentirely descended from one set of families, and so constituting,\r\nin fact, a single family. But we know that, despite the objections\r\nentertained by the Hebrews against the intermixture of their race with\r\nother races, this did not happen. Not only did many of those regarded\r\nas true Hebrews share descent from nations outside their own, but many\r\nof those regarded as truly belonging to nations outside the Jewish race\r\nshared descent from the twelve sons of Jacob.\r\n\r\nThe case corresponding, then, to that of the purest of all human\r\nraces, and the case therefore most favourable to the view presented\r\nby Darwin (though very far from essential to the Darwinian theory),\r\nis simply this, that, in the first place, many animals regarded as\r\ntruly Simiadæ share descent from animals outside that family which\r\nDarwin regards as the ape progenitor of man; and, in the second place,\r\nmany animals regarded as outside the Simiadæ share descent from that\r\nape-like progenitor. This involves the important inference that the\r\nape-like progenitor of man was not so markedly differentiated from\r\nother families of animals then existing, that fertile intercourse\r\nwas impossible. A little consideration will show that this inference\r\naccords well with, if it might not almost have been directly deduced\r\nfrom, the Darwinian doctrine that all orders of mammals were, in\r\nturn, descended from a still more remote progenitor race. The same\r\nconsiderations may manifestly be applied also to that more remote\r\nrace, to the still more remote race from which all the vertebrates\r\nhave descended, and so on to the source itself from which all forms of\r\nliving creatures are supposed to have descended. A difficulty meets\r\nus at that remotest end of the chain analogous to the difficulty of\r\nunderstanding how life began at all; but we should profit little by\r\nextending the inquiry to these difficulties, which remain, and are\r\nlikely long to remain, insuperable.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, are the considerations above urged from introducing\r\nany new or insuperable objection to the Darwinian theory, that, rightly\r\nunderstood, they indicate the true answer to an objection which has\r\nbeen urged by Mivart and others against the belief that man has\r\ndescended from some ape-like progenitor.\r\n\r\nMivart shows that no existing ape or monkey approaches man more nearly\r\nin all respects than other races, but that one resembles man more\r\nclosely in some respects, another in others, a third in yet others,\r\nand so forth. “The ear lobule of the gorilla makes him our cousin,”\r\nhe says, “but his tongue is eloquent in his own dispraise.” If the\r\n“bridging convolutions of the orang[’s brain] go to sustain his claim\r\nto supremacy, they also go far to sustain a similar claim on the\r\npart of the long-tailed thumbless spider-monkeys. If the obliquely\r\nridged teeth of _Simia_ and _Troglodytes_ (the chimpanzee) point to\r\ncommunity of origin, how can we deny a similar community of origin, as\r\nthus estimated, to the howling monkeys and galagos? The liver of the\r\ngibbons proclaims them almost human; that of the gorilla declares him\r\ncomparatively brutal. The lower American apes meet us with what seems\r\nthe ‘front of Jove himself,’ compared with the gigantic but low-browed\r\ndenizens of tropical Western Africa.”\r\n\r\nHe concludes that the existence of these wide-spread signs of affinity\r\nand the associated signs of divergence, disprove the theory that the\r\nstructural characters existing in the human frame have had their origin\r\nin the influence of inheritance and “natural selection.” “In the words\r\nof the illustrious Dutch naturalists, Messrs. Schroeder, Van der Kolk\r\nand Vrolik,” he says, “the lines of affinity existing between different\r\nPrimates construct rather a network than a ladder. It is indeed a\r\ntangled web, the meshes of which no naturalist has as yet unravelled\r\nby the aid of natural selection. Nay, more, these complex affinities\r\nform such a net for the use of the teleological _retiarius_ as it\r\nwill be difficult for his Lucretian antagonist to evade, even with the\r\ncountless turns and doublings of Darwinian evolutions.”\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that when we observe the analogy between the\r\nrelationships of individuals, families, and races of man, and the\r\nrelationships of the various species of animals, the difficulty\r\nindicated by Mr. Mivart disappears. Take, for instance, the case\r\nof the eight allied families above considered. Suppose, instead of\r\nthe continual intermarriages before imagined—an exceptional order\r\nof events, be it remembered—that the more usual order of things\r\nprevails, viz., that alliances take place with other families. For\r\nsimplicity, however, imagine that each married pair has two children,\r\nmale and female, and that each person marries once and only once. Then\r\nit will be found that the pair A have ten families of cousins, two\r\nfirst-cousin families, and eight second-cousin families; these are all\r\nthe families which share descent from the eight great-grandparents of\r\nthe pair. (To have third-cousin families we should have to go back to\r\nthe fourth generation.) Thus there are eleven families in all. Now,\r\nin the case first imagined of constant intermarrying, there would\r\nstill have been eleven families, but they would all have descended\r\nfrom eight great-grandparents, and we should then expect to find\r\namong the eleven families various combinations, so to speak, of the\r\nspecial characteristics of the eight families from which they had\r\ndescended. On the other hand, eleven families, in _no_ way connected,\r\nhave descended from eighty-eight great-grandparents, and would\r\npresent a corresponding variety of characteristics. But in the case\r\nactually supposed, in which the eleven families are so related that\r\neach one (for what applies to the pair A applies to the others) has\r\ntwo first-cousin families, and eight second-cousin families, it will\r\nbe found that instead of 88 they have only 56 great-grandparents,\r\nor ancestors, in the third generation above them. The two families\r\nrelated as first cousins to the pair A have, like these, eight\r\ngreat-grandparents, four out of these eight for one family, being the\r\nfour grandparents of the father of the pair A, the other four being\r\noutsiders; while four of the eight great-grandparents of the other\r\nfamily of first cousins are the four grandparents of the mother of the\r\npair A, the other four being outsiders. The other eight families each\r\nhave eight great-grandparents; two of the families having among their\r\ngreat-grandparents the parents of one of the grandfathers of the pair\r\nA, but no other great-grandparent in common with the pair A; other two\r\nof the eight families having among their great-grandparents the parents\r\nof the other grandfather of the pair A; other two having among their\r\ngreat-grandparents the parents of one of the grandmothers of the pair\r\nA; the remaining two families having among their great-grandparents the\r\nparents of the other grandmother of the pair A; while in all cases the\r\nsix remaining great-grandparents of each family are outsiders, in no\r\nway related, on our assumption, either to the eight great-grandparents\r\nof the pair A or to each other, except as connected in pairs by\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nNow manifestly in such a case, which, save for the symmetry introduced\r\nto simplify its details, represents fairly the usual relationships\r\nbetween any family, its first cousins, and its second cousins, we\r\nshould not expect to find any one of the ten other families resembling\r\nthe pair A more closely in _all_ respects than would any other of\r\nthe ten. The two first-cousin families would _on the whole_ resemble\r\nthe pair A more nearly than would any of the other eight, but we\r\nshould expect to find _some_ features or circumstances in which one\r\nor other or all of the second-cousin families would show a closer\r\nresemblance to one or other or both of the pair A. This is found often,\r\nperhaps generally, to be the case, even as respects the ordinary\r\ncharacteristics in which resemblance is looked for, as complexion,\r\nheight, features, manner, disposition, and so forth. Much more would\r\nit be recognized, if such close investigation could be made among the\r\nvarious families as the naturalist can make into the characteristics\r\nof men and animals. The fact, then, that features of resemblance to\r\nman are found, not all in one order of the Simiadæ, but scattered among\r\nthe various orders, is perfectly analogous with the laws of resemblance\r\nrecognized among the various members of more or less closely related\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe same result follows if we consider the analogy between various\r\ndifferent species of animals on the one hand and between various races\r\nof the human family on the other. No one thinks of urging against the\r\nordinary theory that men form only a single species, the objection that\r\nnone of the other families of the human race can be regarded as the\r\nprogenitor of the Caucasian family, seeing that though the Mongolian\r\ntype is nearer in some respects, the Ethiopian is nearer in others,\r\nthe American in others, the Malay in yet others. We find in this the\r\nperfect analogue of what is recognized in the relationships between\r\nfamilies all belonging to one nation, or even to one small branch of\r\na nation. Is it not reasonable, then, to find in the corresponding\r\nfeatures of scattered resemblance observed among the various branches\r\nof the great Simian family, not the objection which Mivart finds\r\nagainst the theory of relationship, but rather what should be expected\r\nif that theory is sound, and therefore, _pro tanto_, a confirmation of\r\nthe theory?\r\n\r\nBut now, in conclusion, let us briefly consider the great difficulty\r\nof the theory that man is descended from some ape-like, arboreal,\r\nspeechless animal,—the difficulty of bridging over the wide gap which\r\nconfessedly separates the lowest race of savages from the highest\r\nexisting race of apes. After all that has been done to diminish the\r\ndifficulty, it remains a very great one. It is quite true that what\r\nis going on at this present time shows how the gap has been widened,\r\nand therefore indicates how it may once have been comparatively small.\r\nThe more savage races of man are gradually disappearing on the one\r\nhand, the most man-like apes are being destroyed on the other,—so\r\nthat on both sides of the great gap a widening process is at work. Ten\r\nthousand years hence the least civilized human race will probably be\r\nlittle inferior to the average Caucasian races of the present day,\r\nthe most civilized being far in advance of the most advanced European\r\nraces of our time. On the other hand, the gorilla, the chimpanzee, the\r\norang-outang, and the gibbon will probably be extinct or nearly so.\r\nTrue, the men of those days will probably have very exact records of\r\nthe characteristics not only of the present savage races of man, but of\r\nthe present races of apes. Nay, they will probably know of intermediate\r\nraces, long since extinct even now, whose fossil remains geologists\r\nhope to discover before long as they have already discovered the\r\nremains of an ape as large as man (the _Dryopithecus_) which existed\r\nin Europe during the Miocene period;[40] and more recently the remains\r\nof a race of monkeys akin to Macacus, which once inhabited Attica. But\r\nalthough our remote descendants will thus possess means which we do not\r\npossess of bridging the gap between the highest races of apes and the\r\nlowest races of man, the gap will nevertheless be wider in their time.\r\nAnd tracing backwards the process, which, thus traced forward, shows a\r\nwidened gap, we see that once the gap must have been much narrower than\r\nit is. Lower races of man than any now known once existed on the earth,\r\nand also races of apes nearer akin to man than any now existing, even\r\nif the present races of apes are not the degraded descendants of races\r\nwhich, living under more favourable conditions, were better developed\r\nafter their kind than the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and gibbon of the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nIt may be, indeed, that in the consideration last suggested we may find\r\nsome assistance in dealing with our difficult problem. It is commonly\r\nassumed that the man-like apes are the most advanced members of the\r\nSimian family save man alone, and so far as their present condition is\r\nconcerned this may be true. But it is not necessarily the case that\r\nthe anthropoid apes have advanced to their present condition. Judging\r\nfrom the appearance of the young of these races, we may infer with some\r\ndegree of probability that these apes are the degraded representatives\r\nof more intelligent and less savage creatures. Whereas the young of\r\nman is decidedly more savage in character than the well-nurtured and\r\ncarefully trained adult, the young of apes are decidedly less savage\r\nthan the adult. The same reasoning which leads us to regard the\r\nwildness, the natural cruelty, the destructiveness, the love of noise,\r\nand many other little ways of young children, as reminders of a more or\r\nless remote savage ancestry, should lead us to regard the comparative\r\ntameness and quiet of the young gorilla, for example, as evidence that\r\nin remote times the progenitors of the race were not so wild and fierce\r\nas the present race of gorillas.\r\n\r\nBut even when all such considerations, whether based on the known or\r\nthe possible, have been taken into account, the gap between the lowest\r\nsavage and the highest ape is not easily bridged. It is easier to see\r\nhow man _may_ have developed from an arboreal, unspeaking animal to his\r\npresent state, than to ascertain how any part of the development was\r\nactually effected; in other words, it is easier to suggest a general\r\nhypothesis than to establish an even partial theory.\r\n\r\nThat the progenitor of man was arboreal in his habits seems altogether\r\nprobable. Darwin recognizes in the arrangement of the hair on the human\r\nforearm the strongest evidence on this point, so far as the actual\r\nbody of man is concerned; the remaining and perhaps stronger evidence\r\nbeing derived from appearances recognized in the unborn child. He,\r\nwho usually seems as though he could overlook nothing, seems to me to\r\nhave overlooked a peculiarity which is even more strikingly suggestive\r\nof original arboreal habits. There is one set of muscles, and, so far\r\nas I know, one only, which the infant uses freely, while the adult\r\nscarcely uses them at all. I mean the muscles which separate the toes,\r\nand those, especially, which work the big toe. Very young children\r\nnot only move the toes apart, so that the great toe and the little toe\r\nwill be inclined to each other (in the plane of the sole) nearly ninety\r\ndegrees, but also distinctly clutch with the toes. The habit has no\r\nrelation to the child’s actual means of satisfying its wants. I have\r\noften thought that the child’s manner of clutching with its fingers is\r\nindicative of the former arboreal habits of the race, but it is not\r\ndifficult to explain the action otherwise. The clutching movement of\r\nthe toes, however, cannot be so explained. The child can neither bring\r\nfood to its mouth in this way nor save itself from falling; and as the\r\nadult does not use the toes in this way the habit cannot be regarded\r\nas the first imperfect effort towards movements subsequently useful.\r\nIn fact, the very circumstance that the movement is gradually disused\r\nshows that it is useless to the human child in the present condition\r\nof the race. In the very young gorilla the clutching motion of the\r\ntoes is scarcely more marked than it is in a very young child; only in\r\nthe gorilla the movement, being of use, is continued by the young, and\r\nis developed into that effective clutch with the feet which has been\r\nalready described. Here we have another illustration of that divergency\r\nwhich, rather than either simple descent or ascent, characterizes the\r\nrelationship between man and the anthropoid ape. In the growing gorilla\r\na habit is more and more freely used, which is more and more completely\r\ngiven up by the child as he progresses towards maturity.\r\n\r\nProbably the arboreal progenitor of man was originally compelled to\r\nabandon his arboreal habits by some slow change in the flora of his\r\nhabitat, resulting in the diminution and eventual disappearance of\r\ntrees suited for his movements. He would thus be compelled to adopt, at\r\nfirst, some such course as the chimpanzee—making huts of such branches\r\nand foliage as he could conveniently use for the purpose. The habit\r\nof living in large companies would (as in the case of the chimpanzee)\r\nbecome before long necessary, especially if the race or races thus\r\ndriven from their former abode in the trees were, like the gibbons,\r\nunapt when alone both in attack and in defence. One can imagine how\r\nthe use of vocal signals of various kinds would be of service to the\r\nmembers of these troops, not only in their excursions, but during the\r\nwork of erecting huts or defences against their enemies. If in two\r\ngenerations the silent wild dog acquires, when brought into the company\r\nof domestic dogs, no less than five distinct barking signals, we can\r\nwell believe that a race much superior in intelligence, and forced\r\nby necessity to associate in large bodies, would—in many hundreds\r\nof generations, perhaps—acquire a great number of vocal symbols.\r\nThese at first would express various emotions, as of affection, fear,\r\nanxiety, sympathy, and so forth. Other signals would be used to\r\nindicate the approach of enemies, or as battle-cries. I can see no\r\nreason why gradually the use of particular vocal signs to indicate\r\nvarious objects, animate or inanimate, and various actions, should\r\nnot follow after a while. And though the possession and use of many,\r\neven of many hundreds, of such signs would be very far from even the\r\nmost imperfect of the languages now employed by savage races, one can\r\nperceive the possibility—which is all that at present we can expect\r\nto recognize—that out of such systems of vocal signalling a form of\r\nlanguage might arise, which, undergoing slow and gradual development,\r\nshould, in the course of many generations, approach in character\r\nthe language of the lowest savage races. That from such a beginning\r\nlanguage should attain its higher and highest developments is not more\r\nwonderful in kind, though much more wonderful, perhaps, in degree,\r\nthan that from the first imperfect methods of printing should have\r\narisen the highest known developments of the typographic art. The\r\nreal difficulty lies in conceiving how mere vocal signalling became\r\ndeveloped into what can properly be regarded as spoken language.\r\n\r\nOf the difficulties related to the origin of, or rather the development\r\nof, man’s moral consciousness, space will not permit me to speak, even\r\nthough there were much to be said beyond the admission that these\r\ndifficulties have not as yet been overcome. It must be remembered,\r\nhowever, that races of men still exist whose moral consciousness can\r\nhardly be regarded as very fully developed. Not only so, but, through\r\na form of reversion to savage types, the highest and most cultivated\r\nraces of man bring forth from time to time (as our police reports too\r\nplainly testify) beings utterly savage, brutal, and even (“which is\r\nelse”) bestial. Nay, the man is fortunate who has never had occasion\r\nto control innate tendencies to evil which are at least strongly\r\nsignificant of the origin of our race. To most minds it must be\r\npleasanter as certainly it seems more reasonable, to believe that the\r\nevil tendencies of our race are manifestations of qualities undergoing\r\ngradual extinction, than to regard them as the consequences of one\r\npast offence, and so to have no reason for trusting in their gradual\r\neradication hereafter. But, as Darwin says, in the true scientific\r\nspirit, “We are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only with\r\nthe truth as far as our reason allows us to discover it. We must\r\nacknowledge that man, with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which\r\nfeels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only\r\nto other men but to the humblest living creature, with his God-like\r\nintellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of\r\nthe solar system,—with all these exalted powers, man still bears in\r\nhis bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.” As it seems\r\nto me, man’s moral nature teaches the same lesson with equal, if not\r\ngreater, significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE USE AND ABUSE OF FOOD._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon has laid it down as an axiom that experiment is the\r\nfoundation of all real progress in knowledge. “Man,” he said, “as the\r\nminister and interpreter of nature, does and understands as much as\r\nhis observations on the order of nature permit him, and neither knows\r\nnor is capable of more.”[41] It would seem, then, as if there could be\r\nno subject on which man should be better informed than on the value\r\nof various articles of food, and the quantity in which each should\r\nbe used. On most branches of experimental inquiry, a few men in each\r\nage—perhaps but for a few ages in succession—have pursued for a\r\nlonger or shorter portion of their life, a system of experiment and\r\nobservation. But on the subject of food or diet all men in all ages\r\nhave been practical experimenters, and not for a few years only, but\r\nduring their entire life. One would expect, then, that no questions\r\ncould be more decisively settled than those which relate to the use or\r\nthe abuse of food. Every one ought to know, it might be supposed, what\r\nkinds of food are good for the health, in what quantity each should\r\nbe taken, what changes of diet tend to correct this or that kind of\r\nill-health, and how long each change should be continued.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as we know, this is far from being the case. We all\r\neat many things which are bad for us, and omit to eat many things\r\nwhich would be good for us. We change our diet, too often, without\r\nany consideration, or from false considerations, of the wants of the\r\nbody. When we have derived benefit from some change of diet, we are apt\r\nto continue the new diet after the necessity for it has passed away.\r\nAs to quantity, also, we seldom follow well-judged rules. Some take\r\nless nutriment (or less of some particular form of nutriment) than\r\nis needed to supply the absolute requirements of the system; others\r\npersistently overload the system, despite all the warnings which their\r\nown experience and that of others should afford of the mischief likely\r\nto follow that course.\r\n\r\nIt is only of late years that systematic efforts have been made to\r\nthrow light on the subject of the proper use of food, to distinguish\r\nbetween its various forms, and to analyze the special office of each\r\nform. I propose to exhibit, in a popular manner, some of the more\r\nimportant practical conclusions to which men of science have been led\r\nby their investigations into these questions.\r\n\r\nThe human body has been compared to a lamp in which a flame is burning.\r\nIn some respects the comparison is a most apt one, as we shall see\r\npresently. But man does more than _live_; he _works_,—with his\r\nbrain or with his muscles. And therefore the human frame may be more\r\njustly compared to a steam-engine than to the flame of a lamp. Of\r\nmere life, the latter illustration is sufficiently apt, but it leaves\r\nunillustrated man’s capacity for work; and since food is taken with\r\ntwo principal objects—the maintenance of life and the renewal of\r\nmaterial used up in brain work and muscular work—we shall find that\r\nthe comparison of man to a machine affords a far better illustration\r\nof our subject than the more common comparisons of the life of man\r\nto a burning flame, and of food to the fuel which serves to maintain\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one class of food, and, perhaps, on the whole, the\r\nmost important, the operation of which is equally well illustrated by\r\neither comparison. The sort of food to which I refer may be termed\r\n_heat-maintaining_ food. I distinguish it thus from food which serves\r\nother ends, but of course it is not to be understood that any article\r\nof diet serves _solely_ the end of maintaining heat. Accordingly, we\r\nfind that heat-maintaining substance exists in nearly all the ordinary\r\narticles of food. Of these there are two—sugar and fat—which may be\r\nlooked on as special “heat-givers.” Starch, also, which appears in all\r\nvegetables, and thus comes to form a large proportion of our daily\r\nfood, is a heat-giver. In fact, this substance only enters the system\r\nin the form of sugar, the saliva having the power of converting starch\r\n(which is insoluble in water) into sugar, and thus rendering it soluble\r\nand digestible.\r\n\r\nStarch, as I have said, appears in all vegetables. But it is found\r\nmore freely in some than in others. It constitutes nearly the whole\r\nsubstance of arrowroot, sago, and tapioca, and appears more or less\r\nfreely in potatoes, rice, wheat, barley, and oats. In the process\r\nof vegetation it is converted into sugar; and thus it happens that\r\nvegetable diet—whether presenting starch in its natural form to\r\nbe converted into sugar by the consumer, or containing sugar which\r\nhas resulted from a process of change undergone by starch—is in\r\ngeneral heat-maintaining. Sugar is used as a convenient means of\r\nmaintaining the heat-supply; for in eating sugar we are saved the\r\ntrouble of converting starch into sugar. A love for sweet things is\r\nthe instinctive expression of the necessity for heat-maintaining\r\nfood. We see this liking strongly developed in children, whose rapid\r\ngrowth is continually drawing upon their heat-supply. So far as adults\r\nare concerned, the taste for sweet food is found to prevail more in\r\ntemperate than in tropical climes, as might be expected; but, contrary\r\nto what we might at first expect, we do not find any increase in\r\nthe liking for sweet food in very cold climates. Another and a more\r\neffective way of securing the required heat-supply prevails in such\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nAs starch is converted into sugar, so by a further process sugar is\r\nconverted into fat. It is by the conversion of sugar into fat that\r\nits heat-supplying power is made available. This conversion takes\r\nplace in the vegetable as well as in the animal system, and thus fat\r\nappears in a variety of forms—as butter, suet, oil, and so forth. Now,\r\nprecisely as sugar is a more convenient heat-supplier than starch,\r\nso fat exceeds sugar in its power of maintaining animal heat. It has\r\nbeen calculated that one pound of fat—whether in the form of suet,\r\nbutter, or oil—will go as far towards the maintenance of animal heat\r\nas two pounds of sugar, or as two pounds and a half of starch. Thus\r\nit happens that in very cold countries there is developed a taste for\r\nsuch articles of food as contain most fat, or even for pure fat and its\r\nanalogues—oil, butter, tallow, dripping, and other forms of _grease_.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of starch, sugar, and fat as heat-forming articles of\r\nfood; but I must note their influence in the development of muscles and\r\nnerves. Without a certain proportion of fat in the food a wasting of\r\nthe tissues will always take place; for muscles and nerves cannot form\r\nwithout fat. And conversely, the best remedy for wasting diseases is to\r\nbe found in the supply of some easily digestible form of fatty food.\r\nWell-fatted meat, and especially meat in which the fat is to be seen\r\ndistributed through the flesh, may be taken under such circumstances.\r\nButter and salad oil are then also proper articles of food. Cream is\r\nstill better, and cream cheeses may be used with advantage. It is on\r\naccount of its heat-supplying and fat-forming qualities that cod-liver\r\noil has taken its place as one of the most valuable remedies for\r\nscrofulous and consumptive patients.\r\n\r\nBut it must be noted that the formation of fat is not the object with\r\nwhich heat-supplying food is taken. It is an indication of derangement\r\nof the system when heat-giving food is too readily converted into\r\nfat. And in so far as this process of conversion takes place beyond\r\nwhat is required for the formation of muscles and nerves, the body\r\nsuffers in the loss of its just proportion of heat-supply. Of course,\r\nif too large an amount of heat-giving food is taken into the system,\r\nwe may expect that the surplus will be deposited in the form of\r\nadipose tissue. The deposition of fat in such a case will be far less\r\ninjurious to the system than an excessive heat-supply would be. But\r\nwhen only a just amount of heat-giving food is taken, and in place\r\nof fulfilling its just office this food is converted into adipose\r\ntissue, it becomes necessary to inquire into the cause of the mischief.\r\nTechnically, the evil may be described as resulting from the deficient\r\noxygenation of the heat-supplying food. This generally arises from\r\ndefective circulation, and may often be cured by a very moderate but\r\n_systematic_ increase in the amount of daily exercise, or by the use\r\nof the sponge-bath, or, lastly, by such changes in the dress—and\r\nespecially in the articles of attire worn next to the skin—as tend to\r\nencourage a freer circulation of the blood. The tendency to accumulate\r\nfat may sometimes be traced to the use of over-warm coverings at night,\r\nand especially to the use of woollen night-clothes. By attending to\r\nconsiderations of this sort, more readily and safely than by an undue\r\ndiminution of the amount of heat-supplying food, the tendency to\r\nobesity may frequently be corrected.\r\n\r\nIn warm weather we should diminish the supply of heat-giving food. In\r\nsuch weather the system does not require the same daily addition to its\r\nanimal heat, and the excess is converted into fat. Experiments have\r\nshown that despite the increased rate at which perspiration proceeds\r\nduring the summer months, men uniformly fed throughout the year\r\nincrease in weight in summer and lose weight in winter.\r\n\r\nSo far as mere existence is concerned, heat-forming food may be looked\r\nupon as the real fuel on which the lamp of life is sustained. But man,\r\nconsidered as a working being, cannot exist without _energy-forming_\r\nfood. All work, whether of the brain or of the limbs, involves the\r\nexhaustion of nervous and muscular matter; and unless the exhausted\r\nmatter be renewed, the work must come to an end. The supply of\r\nheat-giving food may be compared to the supply of fuel for the fire\r\nof a steam-engine. By means of this supply the _fire_ is kept alive;\r\nbut if the fire have nothing to work upon, its energies are wasted or\r\nused to the injury of the machine itself. The supply of water, and its\r\ncontinual use (in the form of steam) in the propulsion of the engine,\r\nare the processes corresponding to the continual exhaustion and renewal\r\nof the muscles and nerves of the human frame. And the comparison may be\r\ncarried yet further. We see that in the case of the engine the amount\r\nof smoke, or rather of carbonic acid, thrown out by the blast-pipe is\r\na measure of the vital energy (so to speak) within the engine; but the\r\namount of work done by the engine is measured rather by the quantity of\r\nsteam which is thrown out, because the elastic force of every particle\r\nof steam has been exerted in the propulsion of the engine before being\r\nthrown out through the blast-pipe. In a manner precisely corresponding\r\nto this, the amount of carbonic acid gas exhaled by a man is a measure\r\nof the rate at which mere existence is proceeding; but the amount of\r\nwork, mental or muscular, which the man achieves, is measured by the\r\namount of used-up brain-material and muscle-material which is daily\r\nthrown off by the body. I shall presently show in what way this amount\r\nis estimated.\r\n\r\nIn the composition of the muscles there is a material called _fibrine_,\r\nand in the composition of the nerves there is a material called\r\n_albumen_. These are the substances[42] which are exhausted during\r\nmental and bodily labour, and which have to be renewed if we are to\r\ncontinue working with our head or with our hands. Nay more, life itself\r\ninvolves work; the heart, the lungs, the liver, each internal organ of\r\nthe body, performs its share of work, just as a certain proportion of\r\nthe power of a steam-engine is expended in merely moving the machinery\r\nwhich sets it in action. If the waste of material involved in this form\r\nof work is not compensated by a continual and sufficient supply of\r\nfibrine and albumen the result will be a gradual lowering of all the\r\npowers of the system, until some one or other gives way,—the heart\r\nceases to beat, or the stomach to digest, or the liver to secrete\r\nbile,—and so death ensues.\r\n\r\nThe fibrine and albumen in the animal frame are derived exclusively\r\nfrom vegetables. For although we seem to derive a portion of the\r\nsupply from animal food, yet the fibrine and albumen thus supplied\r\nhave been derived in the beginning from the vegetable kingdom. “It is\r\nthe peculiar property of the plant,” says Dr. Lankester, “to be able,\r\nin the minute cells of which it is composed, to convert the carbonic\r\nacid and ammonia which it gets from the atmosphere into fibrine\r\nand albumen, and by easy chemical processes we can separate these\r\nsubstances from our vegetable food. Wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice, all\r\ncontain fibrine, and some of them also albumen. Potatoes, cabbage, and\r\nasparagus contain albumen. It is a well-ascertained fact that those\r\nsubstances which contain most of these ‘nutritious secretions,’ as they\r\nhave been called, support life the longest.” They change little during\r\nthe process of digestion, entering the blood in a pure state, and being\r\ndirectly employed to renew the nervous and muscular matter which has\r\nbeen used up during work, either mental or muscular. Thus the supply\r\nof these substances is continually being drawn upon. The carbon, which\r\nforms their principal constituent, is converted into carbonic acid;\r\nand the nitrogen, which forms about a sixth part of their substance,\r\nre-appears in the nitrogen of urea, a substance which forms the\r\nprincipal solid constituent of the matter daily thrown from the system\r\nthrough the action of the kidneys. Thus the amount of urea which daily\r\npasses from the body affords a measure of the work done during the day.\r\n“This is not,” says Dr. Lankester, “the mere dream of the theorist;\r\nit has been practically demonstrated that increased stress upon the\r\nnervous system, viz., brain work, emotion, or excitement from disease,\r\nincreases the quantity of urea and the demand for nitrogenous food. In\r\nthe same manner the amount of urea is the representative of the amount\r\nof muscular work done.”\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the average amount of urea daily formed\r\nin the body of a healthy man is about 470 grains. To supply this\r\ndaily consumption of nitrogenous matter, it is necessary that about\r\nfour ounces of flesh-forming substance should be consumed daily.\r\nIt is important, therefore, to inquire how this substance may be\r\nobtained. The requisite quantity of albuminous and fibrinous matter\r\n“is contained,” says Dr. Lankester, “in a pound of beef; in two pounds\r\nof eggs; in two quarts of milk; in a pound of peas; in five pounds of\r\nrice; in sixteen pounds of potatoes; in two pounds of Indian meal;\r\nin a pound and a half of oatmeal; and in a pound and three-quarters\r\nof flour.” A consideration of this list will show the importance of\r\nattending to the quality as well as the quantity of our food. A man\r\nof ordinary appetite might satisfy his hunger on potatoes or on rice,\r\nwithout by any means supplying his system with a sufficient amount of\r\nflesh-forming food. On the other hand, if a man were to live on bread\r\nand beef alone, he would load his system with an amount of nitrogenous\r\nfood, although not taking what could be considered an excessive amount\r\nof daily nourishment. We see, also, how it is possible to continually\r\nvary the form in which we take the required supply of nitrogenous food,\r\nwithout varying the amount of that supply from day to day.\r\n\r\nThe supply itself should of course also vary from day to day as the\r\namount of daily work may vary. What would be ample for a person\r\nperforming a moderate amount of work would be insufficient for one\r\nwho underwent daily great bodily or mental exertions, and would be\r\ntoo much for one who was taking holiday. It would appear, from the\r\nresearches of Dr. Haughton, that the amount of urea daily formed in\r\nthe body of a healthy man of average weight varies from 400 to 630\r\ngrains. Of this weight it appears that 300 grains results from the\r\naction of the internal organs. It would seem, therefore, that the\r\namount of flesh-forming food indicated in the preceding paragraph may\r\nbe diminished in the proportion of 47 to 40 in the case of a person\r\ntaking the minimum of exercise—that is, avoiding all movements save\r\nthose absolutely necessary for comfort or convenience. On the other\r\nhand, that amount must be increased in the proportion of 74 to 63 in\r\nthe case of a person (of average weight) working up to his full powers.\r\nIt will be seen at once, therefore, that a hardworking man, whether\r\nlabourer or thinker, must make good flesh-forming food constitute a\r\nconsiderable portion of his diet; otherwise he would require to take an\r\namount of food which would seriously interfere with his comfort and the\r\ndue action of his digestive organs. For instance, if he lived on rice\r\nalone, he would require to ingest nearly seven pounds of food daily; if\r\non potatoes, he would require upwards of twenty-one pounds; whereas one\r\npound and a third of meat would suffice to supply the same amount of\r\nflesh-forming food.\r\n\r\nMen who have to work, quickly find out what they require in the way of\r\nfood. The Irishman who, while doing little work, will live contentedly\r\non potatoes, asks for better flesh-forming food when engaged in heavy\r\nlabour. In fact, the employer of the working man, so far from feeling\r\naggrieved when his men require an improvement in their diet, either as\r\nrespects quality or quantity, ought to look on the want as evidence\r\nthat they are really working hard in his service, and also that they\r\nhave a capacity for continuous work. The man who lives on less than\r\nthe average share of flesh-forming food is doing less than an average\r\namount of work; the man who is unable to eat an average quantity of\r\nflesh-forming food, is _unable_ to do an average amount of work. “‘On\r\nwhat principle do you discharge your men?’ I once said,” relates Dr.\r\nLankester, “to a railway contractor. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘it’s according to\r\ntheir appetites.’ ‘But,’ I said, ‘how do you judge of that?’ ‘Why,’\r\nhe said, ‘I send a clerk round when they are getting their dinners,\r\nand those who can’t eat he marks with a bit of chalk, and we send them\r\nabout their business.’”\r\n\r\nAt a lecture delivered at the Royal Museum of Physics and Natural\r\nHistory at Florence, by Professor Mantegazza, a few years since, the\r\nProfessor dwelt on the insufficient food which Italians are in the\r\nhabit of taking, as among the most important causes of the weakness of\r\nthe nation. “Italians,” he said, “you should follow as closely as you\r\ncan the example of the English in your eating and in your drinking,\r\nin the choice of flesh-meat (in tossing off bumpers of your rich\r\nwines),[43] in the quality of your coffee, your tea, and your tobacco.\r\nI give you this advice, dear countrymen, not only as a medical man, but\r\nalso as a patriot. It is quite evident, from the way millions of you\r\nperform the process which you call eating and drinking, that you have\r\nnot the most elementary notions of the laws of physiology. You imagine\r\nthat you are living. You are barely prolonging existence on maccaroni\r\nand water-melons. You neither know how to eat nor how to drink. You\r\nhave no muscular energy; and, therefore, you have no continuous mental\r\nenergy. The weakness of the individual, multiplied many millions of\r\ntimes, results in the collective weakness of the nation. Hence results\r\ninsufficient work, and thence insufficient production. Thus the returns\r\nof the tax-collector and the custom-house officer are scanty, and the\r\nnational exchequer suffers accordingly.” Nor is all this, strange as it\r\nmay sound, the mere gossip of the lecture-room. “The question of good\r\nfeeding,” says Dr. Lankester, “is one of national importance. It is\r\nvain to expect either brain or muscles to do efficient work when they\r\nare not provided with the proper material. Neither intellectual nor\r\nphysical work can be done without good food.”\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the two principal forms of food, the\r\nheat-forming—sometimes called the _amylaceous_—constituents, and\r\nthe flesh-forming or _nitrogenous_ constituents. But there are other\r\nsubstances which, although forming a smaller proportion of the daily\r\nfood, are yet scarcely less important. Returning to our comparison of\r\nthe human system to a steam-engine—we have seen how the heat-forming\r\nand flesh-forming constituents of food correspond to the supply of\r\nfuel and water; but an engine would quickly fall into a useless state\r\nif the wear and tear of the material of which it is constructed were\r\nnot attended to and repaired. Now, in the human frame there are\r\nmaterials which are continually being used up, and which require to be\r\ncontinually restored, if the system is to continue free from disease.\r\nThese materials are the mineral constituents of the system. Amongst\r\nthem we must include _water_, which composes a much larger portion of\r\nour bodies than might be supposed. Seven-ninths of our weight consists\r\nsimply of water. Every day there is a loss of about one-thirtieth\r\npart of this constituent of our system. The daily repair of this\r\nimportant waste of material is not effected by imbibing a corresponding\r\nsupply of water. A large proportion of the weight of water daily lost\r\nis renewed in the solid food. Many vegetables consist principally\r\nof water. This is notably the case with potatoes. Where the water\r\nsupplied to a district is bad, so that little water is consumed by the\r\ninhabitants—at least, without the addition of some other substance—it\r\nbecomes important to notice the varying proportion of water present\r\nin different articles of food. As an instance of this, I may call\r\nattention to a remarkable circumstance observed during the failure of\r\nthe potato crops in Ireland. Notwithstanding the great losses which\r\nthe people sustained at that time, it was noticed that the amount of\r\ntea imported into Ireland exhibited a remarkable increase. This seemed\r\nat first sight a somewhat perplexing phenomenon. The explanation was\r\nrecognized in the circumstance that the potato—a watery vegetable, as\r\nwe have said—no longer formed the chief portion of the people’s diet.\r\nThus the deficiency in the supply of water had to be made up by the\r\nuse of a larger quantity of fluid food; and as simple water was not\r\npalatable to the people, they drank tea in much larger quantities than\r\nthey had been in the habit of taking before the famine.\r\n\r\nBut we have to consider the other mineral constituents of the system.\r\n\r\nIf I were to run through the list of all the minerals which exist\r\nwithin the body, I should weary the patience of the reader, and\r\nperhaps not add very much to the clearness of his ideas respecting the\r\nconstitution of the human frame. Let it suffice to state generally\r\nthat, according to the calculations of physiologists, a human body\r\nweighing 154 pounds contains about 17½ pounds of mineral matter; and\r\nthat the most important mineral compounds existing within the body are\r\nthose which contain lime, soda, and potash. Without pretending to any\r\nstrictly scientific accuracy in the classification, we may say that\r\nthe lime is principally found in the bones, the soda in the blood, the\r\npotash in the muscles; and according as one or other of these important\r\nconstituents is wanting in our food, so will the corresponding portions\r\nof the frame be found to suffer.\r\n\r\nWe have a familiar illustration of the effects of unduly diminishing\r\nthe supply of the mineral constituents of the body in the ravages\r\nwhich scurvy has worked amongst the crews of ships which have remained\r\nfor a long period ill-supplied with fresh vegetables. Here it is\r\nchiefly the want of potash in the food which causes the mischief.\r\nAn interesting instance of the rapid—almost startling—effects of\r\nfood containing potash, in the cure of men stricken by scurvy, is\r\nrelated by Dana. The crew of a ship which had been several months at\r\nsea, but was now nearing the land, were prostrated by the ravages of\r\nscurvy. Nearly all seemed hopelessly ill. One young lad was apparently\r\ndying, the livid spots which were spreading over his limbs seeming to\r\nbetoken his rapidly approaching end. At this moment a ship appeared\r\nin view which had but lately left the land, and was laden with fresh\r\nvegetables. Before long large quantities of the life-bearing food had\r\nbeen transferred to the decks of the other ship. The instincts of life\r\ntaught the poor scurvy-stricken wretches to choose the vegetable which\r\nof all others was best suited to supply the want under which their\r\nframes were wasting. They also were led by the same truthful instincts\r\nto prefer the raw to cooked vegetables. Thus the sick were to be seen\r\neating raw onions with a greater relish than the gourmand shows for\r\nthe most appetising viands. But the poor lad who was the worse of the\r\nsufferers had already lost the power of eating; and it was without\r\na hope of saving his life that some of his companions squeezed the\r\njuice of onions between his lips, already quivering with the tremor of\r\napproaching death. He swallowed a few drops, and presently asked for\r\nmore. Shortly he began to revive, and to the amazement of all those\r\nwho had seen the state of prostration to which he had been reduced, he\r\nregained in a few days his usual health and strength.\r\n\r\nThe elements which we require in order to supply the daily waste of\r\nthe mineral constituents of the body are contained in greater or less\r\nquantities in nearly all the articles which man uses for food. But it\r\nmay readily happen that, by adopting an ill-regulated diet, a man may\r\nnot take a sufficient quantity of these important elements. It must\r\nalso be noticed that articles of food, both animal and vegetable, may\r\nbe deprived of a large proportion of their mineral elements by boiling;\r\nand if, as often happens, the water in which the food has been boiled\r\nis thrown away, injurious effects can scarcely fail to result from\r\nthe free use of food which has lost so important a portion of its\r\nconstituent elements. Accordingly, when persons partake much of boiled\r\nmeat, they should either consume the broth with the meat, or use it\r\nas soup on the alternate days. Vegetables steamed in small quantities\r\nof water (this water being taken with them), also afford a valuable\r\naddition to boiled meat. In fact, experience seems to have suggested\r\nthe advantage of mixing carrots, parsnips, turnips, and greens with\r\nboiled meat; but unfortunately the addition is not always made in\r\na proper manner. If the vegetables are boiled separately in large\r\nquantities of water, and served up after this water has been thrown\r\naway, more harm than good is done by the addition; since the appetite\r\nis satisfied with comparatively useless food, instead of being left\r\nfree to choose, as it might otherwise do, such forms of food as would\r\nbest supply the requirements of the system. Salads and uncooked fruits,\r\nfor instance, contain saline ingredients in large proportion, and\r\ncould be used advantageously after a meal of boiled meat. Potatoes are\r\nlikewise a valuable article of food on account of the mineral elements\r\ncontained in them. And there can be no doubt that the value of potatoes\r\nas an article of food is largely increased when they are cooked in\r\ntheir skins, after the Irish fashion.\r\n\r\nLastly, we must consider those articles of food which promote the\r\nnatural vital changes, but do not themselves come to form part of the\r\nframe, or, at least, not in any large proportion of their bulk. Such\r\nare tea, coffee, and cocoa: alchoholic drinks; narcotics; and lastly,\r\nspices and condiments. We may compare the use of these articles of food\r\nto that of oil in lubricating various parts of a steam-engine. For, as\r\nthe oil neither forms part of the heat-supply nor of the force-supply\r\nof the steam-engine, nor is used to replace the worn material of its\r\nstructure, yet serves to render the movements of the machine more\r\nequable and effective, so the forms of food we are considering are\r\nneither heat-producing nor flesh-forming, nor do they serve to replace,\r\nto any great extent, the mineral constituents of the body, yet they\r\nproduce a sense of refreshment accompanied with renewed vigour. It is\r\ndifficult to determine in what precise way these effects are produced,\r\nbut no doubt can exist as to the fact that they are really attributable\r\nto the forms of food to which we have assigned them.\r\n\r\nTea, coffee, and cocoa owe their influence on the nervous system to\r\nthe presence of a substance which has received the various names of\r\n_theine_, _caffeine_, and _theobromine_. It is identical in composition\r\nwith _piperine_, the most important ingredient in pepper. It may be\r\nseparated in the form of delicate white, silky crystals, which have a\r\nbitter taste. In its concentrated form this substance is poisonous, and\r\nto this circumstance must be ascribed the ill effects which follow\r\nfrom the too free use of strong tea or coffee. However, the instances\r\nof bad effects resulting from the use of “the cup which cheers but not\r\ninebriates” are few and far between, while the benefits derived from\r\nit are recognized by all. It has, indeed, been stated that no nation\r\nwhich has begun to make use of tea, coffee, or cocoa, has ever given up\r\nthe practice; and no stronger evidence can be required of the value of\r\nthose articles of food.\r\n\r\nOf alcoholic liquors it is impossible to speak so favourably. They\r\nare made use of, indeed, almost as extensively as tea or coffee; they\r\nhave been made the theme of the poet, and hailed as the emblems of\r\nall that is genial and convivial. Yet there can be little doubt that,\r\nwhen a balance is struck between the good and evil which have resulted\r\nto man from their use, the latter is found largely to preponderate.\r\nThe consideration of these evils belongs, however, rather to the\r\nmoralist than to the physiologist. I have here simply to consider\r\nalcoholic liquors as articles of food. There can be little doubt that,\r\nwhen used with caution and judgment, they afford in certain cases an\r\nimportant adjunct to those articles which are directly applied to\r\nthe reparation of bodily waste. Without absolutely nourishing the\r\nframe, they ultimately lead to this end by encouraging the digestive\r\nprocesses which result in the assimilation of nutritive articles of\r\nfood. But the quantity of alcohol necessary to effect this is far less\r\nthan is usually taken even by persons who are termed temperate. It is\r\nalso certain that hundreds make use of alcoholic liquors who have no\r\nnecessity for them, and who would be better without them. Those who\r\nrequire them most are men who lead a studious sedentary life; and it\r\nis such men, also, who suffer most from excess in the use of alcoholic\r\nliquors.\r\n\r\nIt remains that I should make a few remarks on mistakes respecting the\r\nquantity of food.\r\n\r\nSome persons fall into the habit of taking an excessive quantity of\r\nfood, not from greediness, but from the idea that a large amount of\r\nfood is necessary for the maintenance of their strength. They thus\r\novertax the digestive organs, and not only fail of their purpose, but\r\nweaken instead of strengthening the system. Especially serious is the\r\nmistake often made by persons in delicate health of swallowing—no\r\nother word can be used, for the digestive organs altogether refuse\r\nto respond to the action of the mouth—large quantities of some\r\nconcentrated form of food, such as even the strongest stomach could\r\nnot deal with in that form. I knew a person who, though suffering\r\nfrom weakness such as should have suggested the blandest and simplest\r\nforms of food, adopted as a suitable breakfast mutton-chops and\r\nbottled stout, arguing, when remonstrated with, that he required more\r\nsupport than persons in stronger health. He was simply requiring his\r\nweak digestive organs to accomplish work which would have taxed the\r\ndigestive energies of the most stalwart labourer working daily in the\r\nopen air for many hours.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a too abstemious diet is as erroneous in principle\r\nas a diet in excess of the natural requirements of the system. A\r\ndiet which is simply too abstemious is perhaps less dangerous than\r\npersistent abstinence from the use of certain necessary forms of food.\r\nNature generally prevents us from injuring ourselves by unwisely\r\ndiminishing the quantity of food we take; but unfortunately she is not\r\nalways equally decided in her admonitions respecting the quality of\r\nour food. A man may be injuring his health through a deficiency in the\r\namount either of the heat-forming or of the flesh-forming food which he\r\nconsumes, and yet know nothing of the origin of the mischief. It may\r\nalso be noted that systematic abstinence, either as respects quantity\r\nor quality of food, is much more dangerous than an occasional fast.\r\nIndeed, it is not generally injurious either to abstain for several\r\ndays from particular articles or forms of food, or to remain, for\r\nseveral hours beyond the usual interval between meals, without food of\r\nany sort. On the contrary, benefit often arises from each practice. The\r\nEmperor Aurelian used to attribute the good health he enjoyed to his\r\nhabit of abstaining for a whole day, once a month, from food of all\r\nsorts; and many have found the Lenten rules of abstinence beneficial.\r\nAs a rule, however, change of diet is a safer measure than periodical\r\nfasting or abstinence from either heat-producing or flesh-forming\r\nfood. It must be noticed, in conclusion, that young persons ought not,\r\nwithout medical advice, to fast or abstain for any length of time from\r\nthe more important forms of food, as serious mischief to the digestive\r\norgans frequently follows from either course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_OZONE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe singular gas termed ozone has attracted a large amount of attention\r\nfrom chemists and meteorologists. The vague ideas which were formed as\r\nto its nature when as yet it had been but newly discovered, have given\r\nplace gradually to more definite views; and though we cannot be said\r\nto have thoroughly mastered all the difficulties which this strange\r\nelement presents, yet we know already much that is interesting and\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly consider the history of ozone.\r\n\r\nNine years after Priestley had discovered oxygen, Van Marum, the\r\nelectrician, noticed that when electric sparks are taken through that\r\ngas, a peculiar odour is evolved. Most people know this odour, since\r\nit is always to be recognized in the neighbourhood of an electrical\r\nmachine in action. In reality, it indicates the presence of ozone in\r\nthe air. But for more than half a century after Van Marum had noticed\r\nit, it was supposed to be the “smell of electricity.”\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Schönbein began to inquire into the cause of this peculiar\r\nodour. He presently found that it is due to some change in the oxygen;\r\nand that it can be produced in many ways. Of these, the simplest, and,\r\nin some respects, the most interesting, is the following:—“Take sticks\r\nof common phosphorus, scrape them until they have a metallic lustre,\r\nplace them in this condition under a large bell-jar, and half-cover\r\nthem with water. The air in the bell-jar is soon charged with ozone,\r\nand a large room can readily be supplied with ozonized air by this\r\nprocess.”\r\n\r\nSchönbein set himself to inquire into the properties of this new gas,\r\nand very interesting results rewarded his researches. It became quite\r\nclear, to begin with, that whatever ozone may be, its properties are\r\nperfectly distinct from those of oxygen. Its power of oxidizing or\r\nrusting metals, for example, is much greater than that which oxygen\r\npossesses. Many metals which oxygen will not oxidize at all, even\r\nwhen they are at a high temperature, submit at once to the influence\r\nof ozone. But the power of ozone on other substances than metals is\r\nequally remarkable. Dr. Richardson states that, when air is so ozonized\r\nas to be only respirable for a short time, its destructive power is\r\nsuch that gutta-percha and india-rubber tubings are destroyed by merely\r\nconveying it.\r\n\r\nThe bleaching and disinfecting powers of ozone are very striking.\r\nSchönbein was at first led to associate them with the qualities of\r\nchlorine gas; but he soon found that they are perfectly distinct.\r\n\r\nIt had not yet been shown whether ozone was a simple or a compound\r\ngas. If simple, of course it could be but another form of oxygen. At\r\nfirst, however, the chances seemed against this view; and there were\r\nnot wanting skilful chemists who asserted that ozone was a compound of\r\nthe oxygen of the air with the hydrogen which forms an element of the\r\naqueous vapour nearly always present in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt was important to set this question at rest. This was accomplished by\r\nthe labours of De la Rive and Marignac, who proved that ozone is simply\r\nanother form of oxygen.\r\n\r\nHere we touch on a difficult branch of modern chemical research. The\r\nchemical elements being recognized as the simplest forms of matter,\r\nit might be supposed that each element would be unchangeable in its\r\nnature. That a compound should admit of change, is of course a thing to\r\nbe expected. If we decompose water, for instance, into its component\r\nelements, oxygen and hydrogen, we may look on these gases as exhibiting\r\nwater to us in another form. And a hundred instances of the sort might\r\nbe adduced, in which, either by separating the elements of a compound,\r\nor by re-arranging them, we obtain new forms of matter without any real\r\nchange of substance. But with an element, the case, one would suppose,\r\nshould be different.\r\n\r\nHowever, the physicist must take facts as he finds them; and amongst\r\nthe most thoroughly recognized chemical facts we have this one, that\r\nelementary substances may assume different forms. Chemists call the\r\nphenomenon allotropy. A well-known instance of allotropy is seen in\r\nred phosphorus. Phosphorus is one of the chemical elements; and, as\r\nevery one knows, the form in which it is usually obtained is that of a\r\nsoft, yellow, semi-transparent solid, somewhat resembling bees’ wax in\r\nconsistence, poisonous, and readily taking fire. Red phosphorus is the\r\nsame element, yet differs wholly in its properties. It is a powder, it\r\ndoes not readily take fire, and it is not poisonous.\r\n\r\nOzone, then, is another form of oxygen. It is the only instance yet\r\ndiscovered of gaseous allotropy.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have to deal with the difficult and still-vexed questions\r\nof the way in which the change from oxygen is brought about, and the\r\nactual distinction between the two forms of the same gas. Schönbein\r\nheld that common oxygen is produced by the combination of two special\r\nforms of oxygen—the positive and the negative, or, as he called them,\r\nozone and antozone. He showed that, in certain conditions of the air,\r\nthe atmospheric oxygen exhibits qualities which are the direct reverse\r\nof those which ozone exhibits, and are distinct from those of ordinary\r\noxygen. In oxygen thus negatived or antozonized, animals cannot live\r\nany more than they can in nitrogen. The products of decomposition are\r\nnot only not destroyed as by ozone, but seem subject to preservative\r\ninfluences, and speedily become singularly offensive; dead animal\r\nmatter rapidly putrefies, and wounds show a tendency to mortification.\r\n\r\nBut the theory of positive and negative forms of oxygen, though still\r\nheld by a few physicists, has gradually given way before the advance\r\nof new and sounder modes of inquiry. It has been proved, in the first\r\nplace, that ozone is denser than ordinary oxygen. The production of\r\nozone is always followed by a contraction of the gas’s volume, the\r\ncontraction being greater or less according to the amount of oxygen\r\nwhich has been ozonized. Regularly as the observers—Messrs. Andrews\r\nand Tait—converted a definite proportion of oxygen into ozone, the\r\ncorresponding contraction followed, and as regularly was the original\r\nvolume of the gas restored when, by the action of heat, the ozone was\r\nreconverted into oxygen.\r\n\r\nAnd now a very singular experiment was made by the observers, with\r\nresults which proved utterly perplexing to them. Mercury has the power\r\nof absorbing ozone; and the experimenters thought that if, after\r\nproducing a definite contraction by the formation of ozone, they could\r\nabsorb the ozone by means of mercury, the quantity of oxygen which\r\nremained would serve to show them how much ozone had been formed, and\r\nthence, of course, they could determine the density of ozone.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that we have one hundred cubic inches of oxygen,\r\nand that by any process we reduce it to a combination of oxygen and\r\nozone occupying ninety-five cubic inches. Now, if the mercury absorbed\r\nthe ozone, and we found, say, that there only remained eighty-five\r\ncubic inches of oxygen, we could reason in this way:—Ten cubic inches\r\nwere occupied by the ozone before the mercury absorbed it; but these\r\ncorrespond to fifteen cubic inches of oxygen; hence, ozone must be\r\ndenser than oxygen in the proportion of fifteen to ten, or three to\r\ntwo. And whatever result might have followed, a real absorption of the\r\nozone by the mercury would have satisfactorily solved the problem.\r\n\r\nBut the result actually obtained did not admit of interpretation in\r\nthis way. The apparent absorption of the ozone by the mercury, that\r\nis, the disappearance of the ozone from the mixture, was accompanied\r\nby _no diminution of volume at all_. In other words, returning to\r\nour illustrative case, after the absorption of the ozone from the\r\nninety-five cubic inches occupied by the mixture, there still remained\r\nninety-five cubic inches of oxygen; so that it seemed as though an\r\nevanescent volume of ozone corresponded in weight to five cubic inches\r\nof oxygen. This solution, of course, could not be admitted, since it\r\nmade the density of ozone _infinite_.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this perplexing experiment is full of interest and\r\ninstruction. The following is the account given by Mr. C. W. Heaton\r\n(Professor of Chemistry at Charing Cross Hospital), slightly modified,\r\nhowever, so that it may be more readily understood.\r\n\r\nModern chemists adopt, as a convenient mode of representing the\r\nphenomena which gases exhibit, the theory that every gas, whether\r\nelementary or compound, consists of minute molecules. They suppose\r\nthat these molecules are of equal size, and are separated by equal\r\nintervals so long as the gas remains unchanged in heat and density.\r\nThis view serves to account for the features of resemblance presented\r\nby all gases. The features in which gases vary are accounted for by the\r\ntheory that the molecules are differently constituted. The molecules\r\nare supposed to be clusters of atoms, and the qualities of a gas are\r\nassumed to depend on the nature and arrangement of these ultimate\r\natoms. The molecules of some elements consist but of a single atom;\r\nthe molecules of others are formed by pairs of atoms; those of others\r\nby triplets; and so on. Again, the molecules of compound gases are\r\nsupposed to consist of combinations of different _kinds_ of atoms.\r\n\r\nNow, Dr. Odling, to whom we owe the solution of the perplexing problem\r\ndescribed above, thus interpreted the observed phenomena. A molecule\r\nof oxygen contains two atoms, one of ozone contains three, _and the\r\noxidizing power of ozone depends on the ease with which it parts with\r\nits third atom of oxygen_. Thus, in the experiment which perplexed\r\nMessrs. Andrews and Tait, the mercury only _seemed_ to absorb the\r\nozone; in reality it converted the ozone into oxygen by removing\r\nits third atom. And now we see how to interpret such a result as we\r\nconsidered in our illustrative case. Five cubic inches of oxygen\r\ngave up their atoms, each atom combining with one of the remaining\r\noxygen doublets, so as to form a set of ozone triplets. Clearly, then,\r\nfifteen cubic inches of oxygen were transformed into ozone. They now\r\noccupied but ten cubic inches; so that the mixture, or ozonized oxygen,\r\ncontained eighty-five cubic inches of oxygen and ten of ozone. When the\r\nmercury was introduced, it simply transformed all the ozone triplets\r\ninto oxygen doublets, by taking away the odd atom from each. It thus\r\nleft ten cubic inches of oxygen, which, with the remaining eighty-five,\r\nconstituted the ninety-five cubic inches observed to remain after the\r\nsupposed absorption of the ozone.\r\n\r\nIt follows, of course, that ozone is half as heavy again as oxygen.\r\n\r\nBut, as Mr. Heaton remarked, “this beautiful hypothesis, although\r\naccounting perfectly for all known facts, was yet but a probability.\r\nOne link was lacking in the chain of evidence, and that link M. Soret\r\nhas supplied by a happily devised experiment.” Although mercury and\r\nmost substances are only capable of converting ozone into oxygen, oil\r\nof turpentine has the power of absorbing ozone in its entirety. Thus,\r\nwhen the experiment was repeated, with oil of turpentine in place of\r\nthe mercury, the ozone was absorbed, and the remaining oxygen, instead\r\nof occupying ninety-five inches, occupied but eighty-five. After\r\nthis, no doubt could remain that Dr. Odling’s ingeniously conceived\r\nhypothesis was the correct explanation of Messrs. Andrews and Tait’s\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nWe recognize, then, in ozone a sort of concentrated oxygen, with this\r\npeculiar property, that it possesses an extraordinary readiness to\r\npart with its characteristic third atom, and so disappear _as ozone_,\r\ntwo-thirds of its weight remaining as oxygen.\r\n\r\nIt is to this peculiarity that ozone owes the properties which render\r\nit so important to our welfare. We are indeed, as yet, in no position\r\nto theorize respecting this element, our knowledge of its very\r\nexistence being so recent, and our information respecting its presence\r\nin our atmosphere being of still more recent acquisition.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is well remarked by Mr. Heaton, that we had, until quite\r\nlately, no reason for confidently adopting Schönbein’s view that ozone\r\nexists in our atmosphere. The test-papers which Schönbein made use of\r\nturned blue under the influence of ozone, it is true, but they were\r\nsimilarly influenced by other elements which are known to exist in our\r\natmosphere, and even the sun’s rays turned them blue. However, Dr.\r\nAndrews has shown how the character of the air producing the change\r\ncan be further tested, so as to render it certain that ozone only has\r\nbeen at work. If air which colours the test-papers be found to lose\r\nthe property after being heated, the change can only be due to ozone,\r\nbecause nitrous and nitric acids (which have the power of colouring the\r\ntest-papers) would not be removed by the heat, whereas ozone is changed\r\nby heat into oxygen.\r\n\r\nOnce we are certain that ozone exists in the air, we must recognize\r\nthe fact that its presence cannot fail to have an important bearing on\r\nour health and comfort; for ozone is an exceedingly active agent, and\r\ncannot exist anywhere without setting busily to its own proper work.\r\nWhat that work is, and whether it is beneficial or deleterious to\r\nourselves, remains to be considered.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, ozone has immense power as a disinfectant.\r\nIt decomposes the products emanating from putrefying matter more\r\neffectually than any other known element. Perhaps the most striking\r\nproof ever given of its qualities in this respect is that afforded by\r\nan experiment conducted by Dr. Richardson a few years ago.\r\n\r\nHe placed a pint of blood taken from an ox in a large wide-mouthed\r\nbottle. The blood had then coagulated, and it was left exposed to\r\nthe air until it had become entirely redissolved by the effects of\r\ndecomposition. At the end of a year the blood was put into a stoppered\r\nbottle, and set aside for seven years. “The bottle was then taken from\r\nits hiding-place,” says Dr. Richardson, “and an ounce of the blood was\r\nwithdrawn. The fluid was so offensive as to produce nausea when the\r\ngases evolved from it were inhaled. It was subjected by Dr. Wood and\r\nmyself to a current of ozone. For a few minutes the odour of ozone\r\nwas destroyed by the odour of the gases from the blood; gradually the\r\noffensive smell passed away; then the fluid mass became quite sweet,\r\nand at last a faint odour of ozone was detected, whereupon the current\r\nwas stopped. The blood was thus entirely deodorized; but another and\r\nmost singular phenomenon was observed. The dead blood coagulated as the\r\nproducts of decomposition were removed, and this so perfectly, that\r\nfrom the new clot that was formed serum exuded. Before the experiment\r\ncommenced, I had predicted on theoretical grounds that secondary\r\ncoagulation would follow on purification; and this experiment, as well\r\nas several others afterwards performed, verified the truth of the\r\nprediction.”\r\n\r\nIt will of course be understood that ozone, in thus acting as a\r\ndisinfectant, is transformed into oxygen. It parts with its third atom\r\nas in the mercury experiment, and so loses its distinctive peculiarity.\r\nThus we might be led to anticipate the results which come next to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nOzone has certain work to do, and in doing that work is transmuted into\r\noxygen. It follows, then, that where there has been much work for ozone\r\nto do, there we shall find little ozone left in the air. Hence, in\r\nopen spaces where there is little decomposing matter, we should expect\r\nto find more ozone than in towns or cities. This accords with what is\r\nactually observed. And not only is it found that country air contains\r\nmore ozone than town air, but it is found that air which has come from\r\nthe sea has more ozone than even the country air, while air in the\r\ncrowded parts of large cities has no ozone at all, nor has the air of\r\ninhabited rooms.\r\n\r\nSo far as we have gone, we might be disposed to speak unhesitatingly in\r\nfavour of the effects produced by ozone. We see it purifying the air\r\nwhich would otherwise be loaded by the products of decomposing matter,\r\nwe find it present in the sea air and the country air which we know\r\nto be so bracing and health-restoring after a long residence in town,\r\nand we find it absent just in those places which we look upon as most\r\nunhealthy.\r\n\r\nAgain, we find further evidence of the good effects of ozone in\r\nthe fact that cholera and other epidemics never make their dreaded\r\nappearance in the land when the air is well supplied with ozone—or\r\nin what the meteorologists call “the ozone-periods.” And though we\r\ncannot yet explain the circumstance quite satisfactorily, we yet seem\r\njustified in ascribing to the purifying and disinfecting qualities of\r\nozone our freedom at those times from epidemics to which cleanliness\r\nand good sanitary regulations are notedly inimical.\r\n\r\nBut there is a reverse side to the picture. And as we described an\r\nexperiment illustrating the disinfecting qualities of ozone before\r\ndescribing the good effects of the element, we shall describe an\r\nexperiment illustrating certain less pleasing qualities of ozone,\r\nbefore discussing the deleterious influences which it seems capable of\r\nexerting.\r\n\r\nDr. Richardson found that when the air of a room was so loaded with\r\nozone as to be only respirable with difficulty, animals placed in the\r\nroom were affected in a very singular manner. “In the first place,”\r\nhe says, “all the symptoms of nasal catarrh and of irritation of the\r\nmucous membranes of the nose, the mouth, and the throat were rapidly\r\ninduced. Then followed free secretion of saliva and profuse action of\r\nthe skin—perspiration. The breathing was greatly quickened, and the\r\naction of the heart increased in proportion.” When the animals were\r\nsuffered to remain yet longer within the room, congestion of the lungs\r\nfollowed, and the disease called by physicians “congestive bronchitis”\r\nwas set up.\r\n\r\nA very singular circumstance was noticed also as to the effects of\r\nozone on the different orders of animals. The above-mentioned effects,\r\nand others which accompanied them, the description of which would be\r\nout of place in these pages, were developed more freely in carnivorous\r\nthan in herbivorous animals. Rats, for example, were much more easily\r\ninfluenced by ozone than rabbits were.\r\n\r\nThe results of Dr. Richardson’s experiments prepare us to hear that\r\nozone-periods, though characterized by the absence of certain diseases,\r\nbring with them their own forms of disease. Apoplexy, epilepsy,\r\nand other similar diseases seem peculiarly associated with the\r\nozone-periods, insomuch that eighty per cent. of the deaths occurring\r\nfrom them take place on days when ozone is present in the air in larger\r\nquantities than usual. Catarrh, influenza, and affections of the\r\nbronchial tubes, also affect the ozone-periods.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that we have much yet to learn respecting ozone before\r\nwe can pronounce definitively whether it is more to be welcomed or\r\ndreaded. We must wait until the researches which are in progress have\r\nbeen carried out to their conclusion, and perhaps even then further\r\nmodes of inquiry will have to be pursued before we can form a definite\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DEW._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few phenomena of common occurrence which have proved more\r\nperplexing to philosophers than those which attend the deposition of\r\ndew. Every one is familiar with these phenomena, and in very early\r\ntimes observant men had noticed them; yet it is but quite recently\r\nthat the true theory of dew has been put forward and established.\r\nThis theory affords a striking evidence of the value of careful and\r\nsystematic observation applied even to the simplest phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nIt was observed, in very early times, that dew is only formed on\r\nclear nights, when, therefore, the stars are shining. It was natural,\r\nperhaps, though hardly philosophical, to conclude that dew is directly\r\nshed down upon the earth from the stars; accordingly, we find the\r\nreference of dew to stellar influences among the earliest theories\r\npropounded in explanation of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nA theory somewhat less fanciful, but still depending on supposed\r\nstellar influences, was shortly put forward. It was observed that\r\ndew is only formed when the atmosphere is at a low temperature; or,\r\nmore correctly, when the air is at a much lower temperature than has\r\nprevailed during the daytime. Combining this peculiarity with the\r\nformer ancient philosophers reasoned in the following manner: Cold\r\ngenerates dew, and dew appears only when the skies are clear—that is,\r\nwhen the stars are shining; hence it follows that the stars generate\r\ncold, and thus lead indirectly to the formation of dew. Hence arose\r\nthe singular theory, that as the sun pours down heat upon the earth, so\r\nthe stars (and also the moon and planets) pour down cold.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common—we may note in passing—than this method of\r\nphilosophizing, especially in all that concerns weather-changes; and\r\nperhaps it would be impossible to find a more signal instance of the\r\nmistakes into which men are likely to fall when they adopt this false\r\nmethod of reasoning; for, so far is it from being true that the stars\r\nshed cold upon the earth, that the exact reverse is the case. It has\r\nbeen established by astronomers and physicists that an important\r\nportion of the earth’s heat-supply is derived from the stars.\r\n\r\nFollowing on these fanciful speculations came Aristotle’s theory\r\nof dew—celebrated as one of the most remarkable instances of the\r\napproximation which may sometimes be made to the truth by clever\r\nreasoning on insufficient observations. For we must not fall into\r\nthe mistake of supposing, as many have done, that Aristotle framed\r\nhypotheses without making observations; indeed, there has seldom lived\r\na philosopher who has made more observations than he did. His mistake\r\nwas that he extended his observations too widely, not making enough on\r\neach subject. He imagined that, by a string of syllogisms, he could\r\nmake a few supply the place of many observations.\r\n\r\nAristotle added two important facts to our knowledge respecting\r\ndew—namely, first, that dew is only formed in serene weather; and\r\nsecondly, that it is not formed on the summits of mountains. Modern\r\nobservations show the more correct statement of the case to be that dew\r\nis _seldom_ formed either in windy weather or on the tops of mountains.\r\nNow, Aristotle reasoned in a subtle and able manner on these two\r\nobservations. He saw that dew must be the result of processes which\r\nare interfered with when the air is agitated, and which do not extend\r\nhigh above the earth’s surface; he conjectured, therefore, that dew is\r\nsimply caused by the discharge of vapour from the air. “Vapour is a\r\nmixture,” he said, “of water and heat, and as long as water can get a\r\nsupply of heat, vapour rises. But vapour cannot rise high, or the heat\r\nwould get detached from it; and vapour cannot exist in windy weather,\r\nbut becomes dissipated. Hence, in high places, and in windy weather,\r\ndew cannot be formed for want of vapour.” He derided the notion that\r\nthe stars and moon cause the precipitation of dew. “On the contrary,\r\nthe sun,” he said, “is the cause; since its heat raises the vapour,\r\nfrom which the dew is formed when that heat is no longer present to\r\nkeep up the vapour.”\r\n\r\nAmidst much that is false, there is here a good deal that is sound.\r\nThe notion that heat is some substance which floats up the vapour,\r\nand may become detached from it in high or windy places, is of course\r\nincorrect. So also is the supposition that the dew is produced by\r\nthe _fall_ of condensed vapour as the heat passes away. Nor is it\r\ncorrect to say that the absence of the sun causes the condensation of\r\nvapour, since, as we shall presently see, the cold which causes the\r\ndeposition of dew results from more than the mere absence of the sun.\r\nBut, in pointing out that the discharge of vapour from the air, owing\r\nto loss of heat, is the true cause of the deposition of dew, Aristotle\r\nexpressed an important truth. It was when he attempted to account for\r\nthe discharge that he failed. It will be observed, also, that his\r\nexplanation does not account for the observed fact that dew is only\r\nformed in clear weather.\r\n\r\nAristotle’s views did not find acceptance among the Greeks or Romans;\r\nthey preferred to look on the moon, stars, and planets as the agents\r\nwhich cause the deposition of dew. “This notion,” says a modern author,\r\n“was too beautiful for a Greek to give up, and the Romans could not do\r\nbetter than follow the example of their masters.”\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, despite the credit attached to Aristotle’s name,\r\nthose who cultivated the physical sciences were unwilling to accept his\r\nviews; for the alchemists (who alone may be said to have been students\r\nof nature) founded their hopes of success in the search for the\r\nphilosopher’s stone, the _elixir vitæ_, and the other objects of their\r\npursuit, on occult influences supposed to be exercised by the celestial\r\nbodies. It was unlikely, therefore, that they would willingly reject\r\nthe ancient theory which ascribed dew to lunar and stellar radiations.\r\n\r\nBut at length Baptista Porta adduced evidence which justified him in\r\ndenying positively that the moon or stars exercise any influence on the\r\nformation of dew. He discovered that dew is sometimes deposited on the\r\ninside of glass panes; and again, that a bell-glass placed over a plant\r\nin cold weather is more copiously covered with dew within than without;\r\nnay, he observed that even some opaque substances show dew on their\r\n_under_ surface when none appears on the upper. Yet, singularly enough,\r\nBaptista Porta rejected that part of Aristotle’s theory which was alone\r\ncorrect. He thought his observations justified him in looking on dew\r\nas condensed—not from vapour, as Aristotle thought—but from the air\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBut now a new theory of dew began to be supported. We have seen that\r\nnot only the believers in stellar influence, but Aristotle also, looked\r\non dew as falling from above. Porta’s experiments were opposed to this\r\nview. It seemed rather as if dew rose from the earth. Observation also\r\nshowed that the amount of dew obtained at different heights from the\r\nground diminishes with the height. Hence, the new theorists looked upon\r\ndew as an exhalation from the ground and from plants—a fine steam, as\r\nit were, rising upwards, and settling principally on the under surfaces\r\nof objects.\r\n\r\nBut this view, like the others, was destined to be overthrown.\r\nMuschenbroek, when engaged in a series of observations intended to\r\nestablish the new view, made a discovery which has a very important\r\nbearing on the theory of dew: he found that, instead of being deposited\r\nwith tolerable uniformity upon different substances,—as falling rain\r\nis, for instance, and as the rising rain imagined by the new theorists\r\nought to be,—dew forms very much more freely on some substances than\r\non others.\r\n\r\nHere was a difficulty which long perplexed physicists. It appeared that\r\ndew neither fell from the sky nor arose from the earth. The object\r\nitself on which the dew was formed seemed to play an important part in\r\ndetermining the amount of deposition.\r\n\r\nAt length it was suggested that Aristotle’s long-neglected explanation\r\nmight, with a slight change, account for the observed phenomena. The\r\nformation of dew was now looked upon as a discharge of vapour from the\r\nair, this discharge not taking place necessarily upwards or downwards,\r\nbut always from the air next to the object. But it was easy to test\r\nthis view. It was understood that the coldness of the object, as\r\ncompared with the air, was a necessary element in the phenomenon. It\r\nfollowed, that if a cold object is suddenly brought into warm air,\r\nthere ought to be a deposition of moisture upon the object. This was\r\nfound to be the case. Any one can readily repeat the experiment. If a\r\ndecanter of ice-cold water is brought into a warm room, in which the\r\nair is not dry—a crowded room, for example—the deposition of moisture\r\nis immediately detected by the clouding of the glass. But there is, in\r\nfact, a much simpler experiment. When we breathe, the moisture in the\r\nbreath generally continues in the form of vapour. But if we breathe\r\nupon a window-pane, the vapour is immediately condensed, because the\r\nglass is considerably colder than the exhaled air.\r\n\r\nBut although this is the correct view, and though physicists had made\r\na noteworthy advance in getting rid of erroneous notions, yet a theory\r\nof dew still remained to be formed; for it was not yet shown how the\r\ncold, which causes the deposition of dew, is itself occasioned. The\r\nremarkable effects of a clear sky and serene weather in encouraging the\r\nformation of dew, were also still unaccounted for. On the explanation\r\nof these and similar points, the chief interest of the subject depends.\r\nScience owes the elucidation of these difficulties to Dr. Wells, a\r\nLondon physician, who studied the subject of dew in the commencement\r\nof the present century. His observations were made in a garden three\r\nmiles from Blackfriars Bridge.\r\n\r\nWells exposed little bundles of wool, weighing, when dry, ten grains\r\neach, and determined by their increase in weight the amount of moisture\r\nwhich had been deposited upon them. At first, he confined himself to\r\ncomparing the amount of moisture collected on different nights. He\r\nfound that although it was an invariable rule that cloudy nights were\r\nunfavourable to the deposition of dew, yet that on some of the very\r\nclearest and most serene nights, less dew was collected than on other\r\noccasions. Hence it became evident that mere clearness was not the only\r\ncircumstance which favoured the deposition of dew. In making these\r\nexperiments, he was struck by results which appeared to be anomalous.\r\nHe soon found that these anomalies were caused by any obstructions\r\nwhich hid the heavens from his wool-packs: such obstructions hindered\r\nthe deposition of dew. He tried a crucial experiment. Having placed\r\na board on four props, he laid a piece of wool _on_ the board,\r\nand another _under_ it. During a clear night, he found that the\r\ndifference in the amount of dew deposited on the two pieces of wool\r\nwas remarkable: the upper one gained fourteen grains in weight, the\r\nlower one gained only four grains. He made a little roof over one piece\r\nof wool, with a sheet of pasteboard; and the increase of weight was\r\nreduced to two grains, while a piece of wool outside the roof gained no\r\nless than sixteen grains in weight.\r\n\r\nLeaving these singular results unexplained for a while, Dr. Wells\r\nnext proceeded to test the temperature near his wool-packs. He found\r\nthat where dew is most copiously produced, there the temperature is\r\nlowest. Now, since it is quite clear that the deposition of dew was not\r\nthe cause of the increased cold—for the condensation of vapour is a\r\nprocess _producing heat_—it became quite clear that the formation of\r\ndew is dependent on and proportional to the loss of heat.\r\n\r\nAnd now Wells was approaching the solution of the problem he had set\r\nhimself; for it followed from his observations, that such obstructions\r\nas the propped board and the pasteboard roof _kept in the heat_. It\r\nfollowed also, from the observed effects of clear skies, that clouds\r\n_keep in the heat_. Now, what sort of heat is that which is prevented\r\nfrom escaping by the interference of screens, whether material or\r\nvaporous? There are three processes by which heat is transmitted from\r\none body to another,—these are, conduction, convection, and radiation.\r\nThe first is the process by which objects in contact communicate\r\ntheir heat to each other, or by which the heat in one part of a body\r\nis gradually transmitted to another part. The second is the process\r\nby which heat is carried from one place to another by the absolute\r\ntransmission of heated matter. The third is that process by which heat\r\nis spread out in all directions, in the same manner as light. A little\r\nconsideration will show that the last process is that with which we\r\nare alone concerned; and this important result flows from Dr. Wells’\r\nexperiments, that _the rate of the deposition of dew depends on the\r\nrate at which bodies part with their heat by radiation_. If the process\r\nof radiation is checked, dew is less copiously deposited, and _vice\r\nversâ_.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the case of heat accompanied by light, we understand\r\nreadily enough that a screen may interfere with the emission of\r\nradiant heat. We use a fire-screen, for instance, with the object of\r\nproducing just such an interference. But we are apt to forget that\r\nwhat is true of luminous heat is true also of that heat which every\r\nsubstance possesses. In fact, we do not meet with many instances in\r\nwhich the effect of screens in preventing the loss of obscure heat is\r\nvery noteworthy. There are some, as the warmth of a green-house at\r\nnight, and so on; but they pass unnoticed, or are misunderstood. It\r\nwas in this way that the explanation of dew-phenomena had been so long\r\ndelayed. The very law on which it is founded had been _practically_\r\napplied, while its meaning had not been recognized. “I had often\r\nin the pride of half-knowledge,” says Wells, “smiled at the means\r\nfrequently employed by gardeners to protect tender plants from cold,\r\nas it appeared to me impossible that a thin mat, or any such flimsy\r\nsubstance, could prevent them from attaining the temperature of the\r\natmosphere, by which alone I thought them liable to be injured. But\r\nwhen I had seen that bodies on the surface of the earth become, during\r\na still and serene night, colder than the atmosphere, by radiating\r\ntheir heat to the heavens, I perceived immediately a just reason for\r\nthe practice which I had before deemed useless.”\r\n\r\nAnd now all the facts which had before seemed obscure were accounted\r\nfor. It had been noticed that metallic plates were often dry when\r\ngrass or wood was copiously moistened. Now, we know that metals part\r\nunwillingly with their heat by radiation, and therefore the temperature\r\nof a metal plate exposed in the open air is considerably higher than\r\nthat of a neighbouring piece of wood. For a similar reason, dew is\r\nmore freely deposited on grass than on gravel. Glass, again, is a\r\ngood radiator, so that dew is freely deposited on glass objects,—a\r\ncircumstance which is very annoying to the telescopist. The remedy\r\nemployed is founded on Wells’ observations—a cylinder of tin or card,\r\ncalled a dew-cap, is made to project beyond the glass, and thus to act\r\nas a screen, and prevent radiation.\r\n\r\nWe can now also interpret the effects of a clear sky. Clouds act the\r\npart of screens, and check the emission of radiant heat from the earth.\r\nThis fact has been noticed before, but misinterpreted, by Gilbert White\r\nof Selborne. “I have often observed,” he says, “that cold seems to\r\ndescend from above; for when a thermometer hangs abroad on a frosty\r\nnight, the intervention of a cloud shall immediately raise the mercury\r\nten degrees, and a clear sky shall again compel it to descend to its\r\nformer gauge.” Another singular mistake had been made with reference\r\nto the power which clouds possess of checking the emission of radiant\r\nheat. It had been observed that on moonlit nights the eyes are apt to\r\nsuffer in a peculiar way, which has occasionally brought on temporary\r\nblindness. This had been ascribed to the moon’s influence, and the term\r\nmoon-blindness had therefore been given to the affection. In reality,\r\nthe moon has no more to do with this form of blindness than the stars\r\nhave to do with the formation of dew. The absence of clouds from the\r\nair is the true cause of the mischief. There is no sufficient check\r\nto the radiation of heat from the eyeballs, and the consequent chill\r\nresults in temporary loss of sight, and sometimes even in permanent\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nSince clouds possess this important power, it is clear that while they\r\nare present in the air there can never be a copious formation of dew,\r\nwhich requires, as we have seen, a considerable fall in the temperature\r\nof the air around the place of deposition. When the air is clear,\r\nhowever, radiation proceeds rapidly, and therefore dew is freely formed.\r\n\r\nBut it might seem that since objects in the upper regions of the air\r\npart with their radiant heat more freely than objects on the ground,\r\nthe former should be more copiously moistened with dew than the latter.\r\nThat the fact is exactly the reverse is thus explained. The cold\r\nwhich is produced by the radiation of heat from objects high in the\r\nair is communicated to the surrounding air, which, growing heavier,\r\ndescends towards the ground, its place being supplied by warmer air.\r\nThus the object is prevented from reducing the air in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood to so low a temperature as would be attained if this\r\nprocess of circulation were checked. Hence, a concave vessel placed\r\nbelow an object high in air, would serve to increase the deposition\r\nof dew by preventing the transfer of the refrigerated air. We are not\r\naware that the experiment has ever been tried, but undoubtedly it would\r\nhave the effect we have described. An object on the ground grows cold\r\nmore rapidly, because the neighbouring air cannot descend after being\r\nchilled, but continues in contact with the object; also cold air is\r\ncontinually descending from the neighbourhood of objects higher in\r\nair which are parting with their radiant heat, and the cold air thus\r\ndescending takes the place of warmer air, whose neighbourhood might\r\notherwise tend to check the loss of heat in objects on the ground.\r\n\r\nHere, also, we recognize the cause of the second peculiarity detected\r\nby Aristotle—namely, that dew is only formed copiously in serene\r\nweather. When there is wind, it is impossible that the refrigerated air\r\naround an object which is parting with its radiant heat, can remain\r\nlong in contact with the object. Fresh air is continually supplying the\r\nplace of the refrigerated air, and thus the object is prevented from\r\ngrowing so cold as it otherwise would.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we should wish to point out the important preservative\r\ninfluence exercised during the formation of dew. If the heat which is\r\nradiated from the earth, or from objects upon it, during a clear night,\r\nwere not repaired in any way, the most serious injury would result to\r\nvegetation. For instance, if the sun raised no vapour during the day,\r\nso that when night came on the air was perfectly dry, and thus the\r\nradiant heat passed away into celestial space without compensation, not\r\na single form of vegetation could retain its life during the bitter\r\ncold which would result. But consider what happens. The sun’s heat,\r\nwhich has been partly used up during the day in supplying the air\r\nwith aqueous vapour, is gradually given out as this vapour returns to\r\nthe form of water. Thus the process of refrigeration is effectually\r\nchecked, and vegetation is saved from destruction. There is something\r\nvery beautiful in this. During the day, the sun seems to pour forth his\r\nheat with reckless profusion, yet all the while it is being silently\r\nstored up; during the night, again, the earth seems to be radiating\r\nher heat too rapidly into space, yet all the while a process is going\r\non by which the loss of heat is adequately compensated. Every particle\r\nof dew which we brush from the blades of grass, as we take our morning\r\nrambles, is an evidence of the preservative action of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE LEVELLING POWER OF RAIN._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been recognized, ever since geology has become truly a science,\r\nthat the two chief powers at work in remodelling the earth’s surface,\r\nare fire and water. Of these powers one is in the main destructive, and\r\nthe other preservative. Were it not for the earth’s vulcanian energies,\r\nthere can be no question that this world would long since have been\r\nrendered unfit for life,—at least of higher types than we recognize\r\namong sea creatures. For at all times igneous causes are at work,\r\nlevelling the land, however slowly; and this not only by the action\r\nof sea-waves at the border-line between land and water, but by the\r\naction of rain and flood over inland regions. Measuring the destructive\r\naction of water by what goes on in the lifetime of a man, or even\r\nduring many successive generations, we might consider its effects very\r\nslight, even as on the other hand we might underrate the effects of the\r\nearth’s internal fires, were we to limit our attention to the effects\r\nof upheaval and of depression (not less preservative in the long run)\r\nduring a few hundreds or thousands of years. As Lyell has remarked in\r\nhis “Principles of Geology,” “our position as observers is essentially\r\nunfavourable when we endeavour to estimate the nature and magnitude of\r\nthe changes now in progress. As dwellers on the land, we inhabit about\r\na fourth part of the surface; and that portion is almost exclusively\r\na theatre of decay, and not of reproduction. We know, indeed, that\r\nnew deposits are annually formed in seas and lakes, and that every\r\nyear some new igneous rocks are produced in the bowels of the earth,\r\nbut we cannot watch the progress of their formation; and as they are\r\nonly present to our minds by the aid of reflection, it requires an\r\neffort both of the reason and the imagination to appreciate duly their\r\nimportance.” But that they are actually of extreme importance, that in\r\nfact all the most characteristic features of our earth at present are\r\ndue to the steady action of these two causes, no geologist now doubts.\r\n\r\nI propose now to consider one form in which the earth’s aqueous\r\nenergies effect the disintegration and destruction of the land. The sea\r\ndestroys the land slowly but surely, by beating upon its shores and by\r\nwashing away the fragments shaken down from cliffs and rocks, or the\r\nmore finely divided matter abstracted from softer strata. In this work\r\nthe sea is sometimes assisted by the other form of aqueous energy—the\r\naction of rain. But in the main, the sea is the destructive agent by\r\nwhich shore-lines are changed. The other way in which water works the\r\ndestruction of the land affects the interior of land regions, or only\r\naffects the shore-line by removing earthy matter from the interior of\r\ncontinents to the mouths of great rivers, whence perhaps the action of\r\nthe sea may carry it away to form shoals and sandbanks. I refer to the\r\ndirect and indirect effects of the downfall of rain. All these effects,\r\nwithout a single exception, tend to level the surface of the earth. The\r\nmountain torrent whose colour betrays the admixture of earthy fragments\r\nis carrying those fragments from a higher to a lower level. The river\r\nowes its colour in like manner to earth which it is carrying down to\r\nthe sea level. The flood deposits in valleys matter which has been\r\nwithdrawn from hill slopes. Rainfall, acts, however, in other ways, and\r\nsometimes still more effectively. The soaked slopes of great hills give\r\nway, and great landslips occur. In winter the water which has drenched\r\nthe land freezes, in freezing expands, and then the earth crumbles and\r\nis ready to be carried away by fresh rains; or when dry, by the action\r\neven of the wind alone. Landslips, too, are brought about frequently in\r\nthe way, which are even more remarkable than those which are caused by\r\nthe unaided action of heavy rainfalls.\r\n\r\nThe most energetic action of aqueous destructive forces is seen when\r\nwater which has accumulated in the higher regions of some mountain\r\ndistrict breaks its way through barriers which have long restrained it,\r\nand rushes through such channels as it can find or make for itself into\r\nvalleys and plains at lower levels. Such catastrophes are fortunately\r\nnot often witnessed in this country, nor when seen do they attain the\r\nsame magnitude as in more mountainous countries. It would seem, indeed,\r\nas though they could attain very great proportions only in regions\r\nwhere a large extent of mountain surface lies above the snow-line.\r\nThe reason why in such regions floods are much more destructive than\r\nelsewhere will readily be perceived if we consider the phenomena of one\r\nof these terrible catastrophes.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the floods which inundated the plains of Martigny\r\nin 1818. Early in that year it was found that the entire valley of the\r\nBagnes, one of the largest side-valleys of the great valley of the\r\nRhône, above Geneva, had been converted into a lake through the damming\r\nup of a narrow outlet by avalanches of snow and ice from a loftier\r\nglacier overhanging the bed of the river Dranse. The temporary lake\r\nthus formed was no less than half a league in length, and more than\r\n200 yards wide, its greatest depth exceeding 200 feet. The inhabitants\r\nperceived the terrible effects which must follow when the barrier\r\nburst, which it could not fail to do in the spring. They, therefore,\r\ncut a gallery 700 feet long through the ice, while as yet the water\r\nwas at a moderate height. When the waters began to flow through this\r\nchannel, their action widened and deepened it considerably. At length\r\nnearly half the contents of the lake were poured off. Unfortunately,\r\nas the heat of the weather increased, the middle of the barrier slowly\r\nmelted away, until it became too weak to withstand the pressure of\r\nthe vast mass of water. Suddenly it gave way; and so completely that\r\nall the water in the lake rushed out in half an hour. The effects of\r\nthis tremendous outrush of the imprisoned water were fearful. “In\r\nthe course of their descent,” says one account of the catastrophe,\r\n“the waters encountered several narrow gorges, and at each of these\r\nthey rose to a great height, and then burst with new violence into the\r\nnext basin, sweeping along forests, houses, bridges, and cultivated\r\nland.” It is said by those who witnessed the passage of the flood at\r\nvarious parts of its course, that it resembled rather a moving mass\r\nof rock and mud than a stream of water. “Enormous masses of granite\r\nwere torn out of the sides of the valleys, and whirled for hundreds\r\nof yards along the course of the flood.” M. Escher the engineer tells\r\nus that a fragment thus whirled along was afterwards found to have a\r\ncircumference of no less than sixty yards. “At first the water rushed\r\non at a rate of more than a mile in three minutes, and the whole\r\ndistance (forty-five miles) which separates the Valley of Bagnes from\r\nthe Lake of Geneva was traversed in little more than six hours. The\r\nbodies of persons who had been drowned in Martigny were found floating\r\non the further side of the Lake of Geneva, near Vevey. Thousands of\r\ntrees were torn up by the roots, and the ruins of buildings which had\r\nbeen overthrown by the flood were carried down beyond Martigny. In\r\nfact, the flood at this point was so high, that some of the houses in\r\nMartigny were filled with mud up to the second story.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted respecting this remarkable flood, that its effects\r\nwere greatly reduced in consequence of the efforts made by the\r\ninhabitants of the lower valleys to make an outlet for the imprisoned\r\nwaters. It was calculated by M. Escher that the flood carried down\r\n300,000 cubic feet of water every second, an outflow five times as\r\ngreat as that of the Rhine below Basle. But for the drawing off of the\r\ntemporary lake, the flood, as Lyell remarks, would have approached in\r\nvolume some of the largest rivers in Europe. “For several months after\r\nthe _débâcle_ of 1818,” says Lyell, “the Dranse, having no settled\r\nchannel, shifted its position continually from one side to the other of\r\nthe valley, carrying away newly erected bridges, undermining houses,\r\nand continuing to be charged with as large a quantity of earthy\r\nmatter as the fluid could hold in suspension. I visited this valley\r\nfour months after the flood, and was witness to the sweeping away of\r\na bridge and the undermining of part of a house. The greater part of\r\nthe ice-barrier was then standing, presenting vertical cliffs 150 feet\r\nhigh, like ravines in the lava-currents of Etna, or Auvergne, where\r\nthey are intersected by rivers.” It is worthy of special notice that\r\ninundations of similar or even greater destructiveness have occurred in\r\nthe same region at former periods.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, necessary for the destructive action of floods\r\nin mountain districts that ice and snow should assist, as in the\r\nMartigny flood. In October, 1868, the cantons of Tessin, Grisons, Uri,\r\nValois, and St. Gall, suffered terribly from the direct effects of\r\nheavy rainfall. The St. Gothard, Splugen, and St. Bernhardin routes\r\nwere rendered impassable. In the former pass twenty-seven lives were\r\nlost, besides many horses and waggons of merchandise. On the three\r\nroutes more than eighty persons in all perished. In the small village\r\nof Loderio alone, no less than fifty deaths occurred. The damage in\r\nTessin was estimated at £40,000. In Uri and Valois large bridges were\r\ndestroyed and carried away. Everything attested the levelling power\r\nof rain; a power which, when the rain is falling steadily on regions\r\nwhence it as steadily flows away, we are apt to overlook.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, necessary to go beyond our own country for\r\nevidence of the destructive action of water. We have had during the\r\npast few years very striking evidence in this respect, which need\r\nscarcely be referred to more particularly here, because it will be\r\nin the recollection of all our readers. Looking over the annals of\r\nthe last half-century only, we find several cases in which the power\r\nof running water in carrying away heavy masses of matter has been\r\nstrikingly shown. Consider, for instance, the effects of the flood in\r\nAberdeenshire and the neighbouring counties, early in August, 1829. In\r\nthe course of two days a great flood extended itself over “that part of\r\nthe north-east of Scotland which would be cut off by two lines drawn\r\nfrom the head of Loch Rannoch, one towards Inverness and the other to\r\nStonehaven.” The total length of various rivers in this region which\r\nwere flooded amounted to between 500 and 600 miles. Their courses were\r\nmarked everywhere by destroyed bridges, roads, buildings, and crops.\r\nSir T. D. Lauder records “the destruction of thirty-eight bridges, and\r\nthe entire obliteration of a great number of farms and hamlets. On the\r\nNairn, a fragment of sandstone fourteen feet long by three feet wide\r\nand one foot thick, was carried about 200 yards down the river. Some\r\nnew ravines were formed on the sides of mountains where no streams had\r\npreviously flowed, and ancient river channels, which had never been\r\nfilled from time immemorial, gave passage to a copious flood.” But\r\nperhaps the most remarkable effect of these inundations was the entire\r\ndestruction of the bridge over the Dee at Ballater. It consisted of\r\nfive arches, spanning a waterway of 260 feet. The bridge was built of\r\ngranite, the pier, resting on rolled pieces of granite and gneiss.\r\nWe read that the different parts of this bridge were swept away in\r\nsuccession by the flood, the whole mass of masonry disappearing in the\r\nbed of the river. Mr. Farquharson states that on his own premises the\r\nriver Don forced a mass of 400 or 500 tons of stones, many of them of\r\n200 or 300 pounds’ weight, up an inclined plane, rising six feet in\r\neight or ten yards, and left them in a rectangular heap about three\r\nfeet deep on a flat ground, the heap ending abruptly at its lower\r\nextremity.” At first sight this looks like an action the reverse of\r\nthat levelling action which we have here attributed to water. But in\r\nreality it indicates the intense energy of this action; which drawing\r\nheavy masses down along with swiftly flowing water, communicates to\r\nthem so great a momentum, that on encountering in their course a rising\r\nslope, they are carried up its face and there left by the retreating\r\nflood. The rising of these masses no more indicates an inherent\r\nuplifting power in running water, than the ascent of a gently rising\r\nslope by a mass which has rolled headlong down the steep side of a\r\nhill indicates an upward action exerted by the force of gravity.\r\n\r\nEven small rivers, when greatly swollen by rain, exhibit great energy\r\nin removing heavy masses. Thus Lyell mentions that in August, 1827, the\r\nCollege, a small river which flows down a slight declivity from the\r\neastern watershed of the Cheviot Hills, carried down several thousand\r\ntons’ weight of gravel and sand to the plain of the Till. This little\r\nriver also carried away a bridge then in process of building, “some of\r\nthe arch stones of which, weighing from half to three-quarters of a ton\r\neach, were propelled two miles down the rivulet.” “On the same occasion\r\nthe current tore away from the abutment of a mill-dam a large block\r\nof greenstone porphyry, weighing nearly two tons, and transported it\r\nto a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile. Instances are related as\r\noccurring repeatedly, in which from 1000 to 3000 tons of gravel are in\r\nlike manner removed by this streamlet to still greater distances in one\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nIt may appear, however, to the reader that we have in such instances\r\nas these the illustration of destructive agencies which are of their\r\nvery nature limited within very narrow areas. The torrent, or even\r\nthe river, may wear out its bed or widen it, but nevertheless can\r\nhardly be regarded as modifying the aspect of the region through which\r\nit flows. Even in this respect, however, the destructive action of\r\nwater is not nearly so limited as it might appear to be. Taking a few\r\ncenturies or a few thousand years, no doubt, we can attribute to the\r\naction of rivers, whether in ordinary flow or in flood, little power\r\nof modifying the region which they drain. But taking that wider survey\r\n(in time) of fluviatile work which modern science requires, dealing\r\nwith this form of aqueous energy as we deal with the earth’s vulcanian\r\nenergies, we perceive that the effects of river action in the course of\r\nlong periods of time are not limited to the course which at any given\r\ntime a river may pursue. In carrying down material along its course\r\nto the sea, a river is not merely wearing down its own bed, but is so\r\nchanging it that in the course of time it will become unfit to drain\r\nthe region through which it flows. Its bottom must of necessity become\r\nless inclined. Now although it will then be lower than at present,\r\nand therefore be then even more than now the place to which the water\r\nfalling upon the region traversed by the river will naturally tend,\r\nit will no longer carry off that water with sufficient velocity.\r\nThree consequences will follow from this state of things. In the\r\nfirst place there will be great destruction in the surrounding region\r\nthrough floods because of inadequate outflow; in the second place, the\r\noverflowing waters will in the course of time find new channels, or in\r\nother words new rivers will be formed in this region; thirdly, owing to\r\nthe constant presence of large quantities of water in the depressed bed\r\nof the old river, the banks on either side will suffer, great landslips\r\noccurring and choking up its now useless channel. Several rivers are\r\nundergoing these changes at the present time, and others, which are\r\nmanifestly unfit for the work of draining the region through which they\r\nflow (a circumstance attested by the occurrence of floods in every wet\r\nseason), must before long be modified in a similar way.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to the consideration of the second form in which\r\nthe destructive action of inland waters, or we may truly say, the\r\ndestructive action of _rain_, is manifested,—viz., in landslips.\r\nThese, of course, are also caused not unfrequently by vulcanian action,\r\nbut equally of course landslips so caused do not belong to our present\r\nsubject. Landslips caused directly or indirectly by rain, are often\r\nquite as extensive as those occasioned by vulcanian energy, and they\r\nare a great deal more common. We may cite as a remarkable instance\r\na landslip of nearly half a mile in breadth, now in progress, in a\r\ndistrict of the city of Bath called Hedgmead, which forms a portion\r\nof the slope of Beacon Hill. It is attributed to the action of a\r\nsubterranean stream on a bed of gravel, the continued washing away of\r\nwhich causes the shifting; but the heavy rains of 1876–77 caused the\r\nlandslip to become much more marked.\r\n\r\nBesides slow landslips, however, rain not unfrequently causes great\r\nmasses of earth to be precipitated suddenly, and where such masses fall\r\ninto the bed of a river, local deluges of great extent and of the most\r\ndestructive character often follow. The following instances, cited in\r\nan abridged form from the pages of Lyell’s “Principles of Geology,”\r\nattest the terrible nature of catastrophes such as these.\r\n\r\nTwo dry seasons in the White Mountains of New Hampshire were followed\r\nby heavy rains on August 28, 1826. From the steep and lofty slopes\r\nof the River Saco great masses of rock and stone were detached, and\r\ndescending carried along with them “in one promiscuous and frightful\r\nruin, forests, shrubs, and the earth which sustained them.” “Although\r\nthere are numerous indications on the steep sides of these hills of\r\nformer slides of the same kind, yet no tradition had been handed down\r\nof any similar catastrophe within the memory of man, and the growth of\r\nthe forest on the very spots now devastated clearly showed that for a\r\nlong interval nothing similar had occurred. One of these moving masses\r\nwas afterwards found to have slid three miles, with an average breadth\r\nof a quarter of a mile.” At the base of the vast chasms formed by these\r\nnatural excavations, a confused mass of ruins was seen, consisting of\r\ntransported earth, gravel, rocks, and trees. Forests were prostrated\r\nwith as much ease as if they had been mere fields of grain; if they\r\nresisted for a while, “the torrent of mud and rock accumulated behind\r\ntill it gathered sufficient force to burst the temporary barrier.”\r\n“The valleys of the Amonoosuck and Saco presented, for many miles, an\r\nuninterrupted scene of desolation, all the bridges being carried away,\r\nas well as those over the tributary streams. In some places the road\r\nwas excavated to the depth of from fifteen to twenty feet; in others\r\nit was covered with earth, rocks, and trees to as great a height.\r\nThe water flowed for many weeks after the flood, as densely charged\r\nwith earth as it could be without being changed into mud, and marks\r\nwere seen in various localities of its having risen on either side of\r\nthe valley to more than twenty-five feet above the ordinary level.”\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable evidence of the tremendous nature\r\nof this cataclysm is to be found in Lyell’s statements respecting\r\nthe condition of the region nineteen years later. “I found the signs\r\nof devastation still very striking,” he says; “I also particularly\r\nremarked that the surface of the bare granite rocks had been smoothed\r\nby the passage over them of so much mud and stone.” Professor Hubbard\r\nmentions in _Silliman’s Journal_ that “in 1838 the deep channels worn\r\nby the avalanches of mud and stone, and the immense heaps of boulders\r\nand blocks of granite in the river channel, still formed a picturesque\r\nfeature in the scenery.”\r\n\r\nIt will readily be understood that when destruction such as this\r\nfollows from landslips along the borders of insignificant rivers,\r\nthose occurring on the banks of the mighty rivers which drain whole\r\ncontinents are still more terrible. The following account from the pen\r\nof Mr. Bates the naturalist, indicates the nature of the landslips\r\nwhich occur on the banks of the Amazon. “I was awoke before sunrise,\r\none morning,” he says, “by an unusual sound resembling the roar of\r\nartillery; the noise came from a considerable distance, one crash\r\nsucceeding another. I supposed it to be an earthquake, for, although\r\nthe night was breathlessly calm, the broad river was much agitated,\r\nand the vessel rolled heavily. Soon afterwards another loud explosion\r\ntook place, followed by others which lasted for an hour till the day\r\ndawned, and we then saw the work of destruction going forward on the\r\nother side of the river, about three miles off. Large masses of forest,\r\nincluding trees of colossal size, probably 200 feet in height, were\r\nrocking to and fro, and falling headlong one after another into the\r\nwater. After each avalanche the wave which it caused returned on the\r\ncrumbly bank with tremendous force, and caused the fall of other masses\r\nby undermining. The line of coast over which the landslip extended was\r\na mile or two in length; the end of it, however, was hid from our view\r\nby an intervening island. It was a grand sight; each downfall created\r\na cloud of spray; the concussion in one place causing other masses\r\nto give way a long distance from it, and thus the crashes continued,\r\nswaying to and fro, with little prospect of termination. When we glided\r\nout of sight two hours after sunrise the destruction was still going\r\non.”\r\n\r\nWe might consider here the action of glaciers in gradually grinding\r\ndown the mountain slopes, the destructive action of avalanches, and a\r\nnumber of other forms in which snow and ice break down by slow degrees\r\nthe upraised portions of the earth. For in reality all these forms of\r\ndestructive action take their origin in the same process whence running\r\nwaters and heavy rainfalls derive their power. All these destructive\r\nagencies are derived from the vapour of water in the air. But it seems\r\nbetter to limit the reader’s attention in this place to the action of\r\nwater in the liquid form; and therefore we proceed to consider the\r\nother ways in which rain wears down the land.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have considered effects which are produced chiefly along\r\nthe courses of rivers, or in their neighbourhood. But heavy rainfall\r\nacts, and perhaps in the long run as effectively (when we remember the\r\nfar wider region affected) over wide tracts of nearly level ground, as\r\nalong the banks of torrents and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe rain which falls on plains or gently undulating surfaces, although\r\nafter a while it dries up, yet to some degree aids in levelling the\r\nland, partly by washing down particles of earth, however slowly, to\r\nlower levels, partly by soaking the earth and preparing a thin stratum\r\nof its upper surface to be converted into dust, and blown away by the\r\nwind. But it is when very heavy storms occur that the levelling action\r\nof rain over widely extending regions can be most readily recognized.\r\nOf this fact observant travellers cannot fail to have had occasional\r\nevidence. Sir Charles Lyell mentions one instance observed by him,\r\nwhich is specially interesting. “During a tour in Spain,” he says,\r\n“I was surprised to see a district of gently undulating ground in\r\nCatalonia, consisting of red and grey sandstone, and in some parts\r\nof red marl, almost entirely denuded of herbage, while the roots of\r\nthe pines, holm oaks, and some other trees, were half exposed, as if\r\nthe soil had been washed away by a flood. Such is the state of the\r\nforests, for example, between Oristo and Vich, and near San Lorenzo.\r\nBut being overtaken by a violent thunderstorm, in the month of August,\r\nI saw the whole surface, even the highest levels of some flat-topped\r\nhills, streaming with mud, while on every declivity the devastation\r\nof torrents was terrific. The peculiarities in the physiognomy of the\r\ndistrict were at once explained, and I was taught that, in speculating\r\non the greater effects which the direct action of rain may once have\r\nproduced on the surface of certain parts of England, we need not revert\r\nto periods when the heat of the climate was tropical.” He might have\r\ncited instances of such storms occurring in England. For example,\r\nWhite, in his delightful “Natural History of Selborne,” describes\r\nthus the effects of a storm which occurred on June 5, 1784: “At about\r\na quarter after two the storm began in the parish of Harpley, moving\r\nslowly from north to south, and from thence it came over Norton Farm\r\nand so to Grange Farm, both in this parish. Had it been as extensive\r\nas it was violent (for it was very short) it must have ravaged all the\r\nneighbourhood. The extent of the storm was about two miles in length\r\nand one in breadth. There fell prodigious torrents of rain on the farms\r\nabove mentioned, which occasioned a flood as violent as it was sudden,\r\ndoing great damage to the meadows and fallows by deluging the one and\r\nwashing away the soil of the other. The hollow lane towards Alton was\r\nso torn and disordered as not to be passable till mended, rocks being\r\nremoved which weighed two hundredweight.”\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned the formation of dust, and the action of wind upon\r\nit, as a cause tending to level the surface of the land. It may appear\r\nto many that this cause is too insignificant to be noticed among those\r\nwhich modify the earth’s surface. In reality, however, owing to its\r\ncontinuous action, and to its always acting (in the main) in one\r\ndirection, this cause is much more important than might be supposed.\r\nWe overlook its action as actually going on around us, because in a\r\nfew years, or in a few generations, it produces no change that can be\r\nreadily noticed. But in long periods of time it changes very markedly\r\nthe level of lower lands, and that too even in cities, where means\r\nexist for removing the accumulations of dust which are continually\r\ncollecting on the surface of the earth. We know that the remains of\r\nold Roman roads, walls, houses, and so forth, in this country, are\r\nfound, not at the present level of the surface, but several feet—in\r\nsome cases many yards—below this level. The same holds elsewhere,\r\nunder the same conditions—that is, where we know quite certainly\r\nthat the substances thus found underground were originally on the\r\nsurface, and that there has been neither any disturbance causing them\r\nto be engulfed, nor any deposition of scoriæ, volcanic dust, or other\r\nproducts of subterranean disturbance. We cannot hesitate to regard this\r\nburying of old buildings as due to the continual deposition of dust,\r\nwhich eventually becomes compacted into solid earth. We know, moreover,\r\nthat the formation of dust is in the main due to rain converting the\r\nsurface layers of the earth into mud, which on drying requires but the\r\nfrictional action of heavy winds to rise in clouds of dust. In some\r\nsoils this process goes on more rapidly than in others, as every one\r\nwho has travelled much afoot is aware. There are parts of England, for\r\ninstance, where, even in the driest summer, the daily deposition of\r\ndust on dry and breezy days is but slight, others where in such weather\r\na dust layer at least a quarter of an inch in thickness is deposited\r\nin the course of a day. If we assumed, which would scarcely seem an\r\nexaggerated estimate, that in the course of a single year a layer of\r\ndust averaging an inch in thickness is deposited over the lower levels\r\nof the surface of the land, we should find that the average depth of\r\nthe layer formed in the last thousand years would amount to no less\r\nthan eighty-three feet. Of course in inhabited places the deposition\r\nof dust is checked, though not so much as most persons imagine. There\r\nis not probably in this country a single building five hundred years\r\nold, originally built at a moderately low level, the position of whose\r\nfoundation does not attest the constant gathering of matter upon the\r\nsurface. The actual amount by which the lower levels are raised and\r\nthe higher levels diminished in the course of a thousand years may be\r\nvery much less, but that it must amount to many feet can scarcely be\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nAnd as in considering the action of rain falling over a wide range of\r\ncountry, we have to distinguish between the slow but steady action\r\nof ordinary rains and the occasional violent action of great storms\r\nof rain, so in considering the effects of drought following after\r\nrain which has well saturated the land we have to distinguish between\r\nordinarily dusty times and occasions when in a very short time, owing\r\nto the intensity of the heat and the violence of the wind large\r\nquantities of dust are spread over a wide area. Darwin thus describes\r\nthe effect of such exceptional drought, as experienced in the years\r\n1827–1832 in Buenos Ayres:—“So little rain fell that the vegetation,\r\neven to the thistles, failed; the brooks were dried up, and the\r\nwhole country assumed the appearance of a dusty high road. This was\r\nespecially the case in the northern part of the province of Buenos\r\nAyres, and the southern part of Santa Fé.” He describes the loss of\r\nlife caused by the want of water, and many remarkable circumstances of\r\nthe drought which do not here specially concern us. He then goes on to\r\nspeak of the dust which gathered over the open country. “Sir Woodbine\r\nParish,” he says, “informed me of a very curious source of dispute.\r\nThe ground being so long dry, such quantities of dust were blown about\r\nthat in this open country the landmarks became obliterated, and people\r\ncould not tell the limits of their estates.” The dust thus scattered\r\nover the land, whether left or removed, necessarily formed part of the\r\nsolid material brought from higher to lower levels, indirectly (in\r\nthis case) through the action of rain; for a drought can only convert\r\ninto friable matter earth which has before been thoroughly soaked. But\r\nthe action of rain, which had originally led to the formation of these\r\nenormous masses of dust, presently took part in carrying the dust in\r\nthe form of mud to yet lower levels. “Subsequently to the drought of\r\n1827 to 1832,” proceeds Darwin, “a very rainy season followed, which\r\ncaused great floods. Hence it is almost certain that some thousands\r\nof the skeletons” (of creatures whose deaths he had described before)\r\n“were buried by the deposits of the very next year. What could be the\r\nopinion of a geologist, viewing such an enormous collection of bones,\r\nof all kinds of animals and of all ages, thus embedded in one thick\r\nearthy mass? Would he not attribute it to a flood having swept over the\r\nsurface of the land, rather than to the common order of things?” In\r\nfact, a single great drought, followed by a very rainy season, must in\r\nthis instance, which was however altogether exceptional, have produced\r\na layer or stratum such as geologists would ordinarily regard as the\r\nwork of a much longer time and much more potent disturbing causes.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to consider in this place the question whether in\r\nreality the quantity of rain which falls now during our winter months\r\ndoes not greatly exceed that which formerly fell in that part of\r\nthe year. The idea is very prevalent that our winters have changed\r\nentirely in character in recent times, and the fear (or the hope?) is\r\nentertained that the change may continue in the same direction until\r\nwet and mild winters replace altogether the cold which prevailed in\r\nformer years. There is no sufficient reason, however, for supposing\r\nthat any such change is taking place. It is, indeed, not difficult to\r\nfind in the meteorological annals of the first half of the present\r\ncentury, instances of the occurrence of several successive winters very\r\nunlike the greater number of those which we have experienced during\r\nthe last ten or twelve years. But if we take any considerable series\r\nof years in the last century we find the alternations of the weather\r\nvery similar to those we at present recognize. Consider, for instance,\r\nGilbert White’s brief summary of the weather from 1768 onwards:—\r\n\r\nFor the winter of 1768–69 we have October and the first part of\r\nNovember rainy; thence to the end of 1768 alternate rains and frosts;\r\nJanuary and February frosty and rainy, with gleams of fine weather; to\r\nthe middle of March, wind and rain.\r\n\r\nFor the winter of 1769–70 we have October frosty, the next fortnight\r\nrainy, the next dry and frosty. December windy, with rain and intervals\r\nof frost (the first fortnight very foggy); the first half of January\r\nfrosty, thence to the end of February mild hazy weather. March frosty\r\nand brighter.\r\n\r\nFor 1770–71, from the middle of October to the end of the year, almost\r\nincessant rains; January severe frosts till the last week, the next\r\nfortnight rain and snow, and spring weather to the end of February.\r\nMarch frosty.\r\n\r\nFor 1771–72, October rainy, November frost with intervals of fog and\r\nrain, December bright mild weather with hoar frosts; then six weeks of\r\nfrost and snow, followed by six of frost, sleet, hail, and snow.\r\n\r\nFor 1772–73, October, November, and to December 22, rain, with mild\r\nweather; to the end of 1772, cold foggy weather; then a week of frost,\r\nfollowed by three of dark rainy weather. First fortnight of February\r\nfrost; thence to the end of March misty showery weather.\r\n\r\nPassing over the winter of 1773–74, which was half rainy, half frosty,\r\nwhat could more closely resemble the winter weather we have had so much\r\nof during the last few years, than that experienced in the winter of\r\n1774–75? From August 24 to the third week of November, there was rain,\r\nwith frequent intervals of sunny weather; to the end of December, dark\r\ndripping fogs; to the end of the first fortnight in March, rain almost\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, with no remarkable changes, until the year 1792, the last of\r\nGilbert White’s records.\r\n\r\nIf we limit our attention to any given month of winter, we find the\r\nsame mixture of cold and dry with wet and open weather as we are\r\nfamiliar with at present. Take, for instance, the month usually the\r\nmost wintry of all, viz., January. Passing over the years already\r\nconsidered, we have January, 1776, dark and frosty with much snow\r\ntill the 26th (at this time the Thames was frozen over), then foggy\r\nwith hoar frost; January, 1777, frosty till the 10th, then foggy and\r\nshowery; 1778, frosty till the 13th, then rainy to the 24th, then\r\nhard frost; 1779, frost and showers throughout January; 1780, frost\r\nthroughout; 1781, frost and snow to the 25th, then rain and snow;\r\n1782, open and mild; 1783, rainy with heavy winds; 1784, hard frost;\r\n1785, a thaw on the 2nd, then rainy weather to the 28th, the rest of\r\nthe month frosty; 1786, frost and snow till January 7, then a week\r\nmild with much rain, the next week heavy snow, and the rest mild with\r\nfrequent rain; 1787, first twenty-four days dark moist mild weather,\r\nthen four days frost, the rest mild and showery; 1788, thirteen days\r\nmild and wet, five days of frost, and from January 18 to the end of the\r\nmonth dry windy weather; 1789, thirteen days hard frost, the rest of\r\nthe month mild with showers; 1790, sixteen days of mild foggy weather\r\nwith occasional rain, to the 21st frost, to the 28th dark with driving\r\nrains, and the rest mild dry weather; 1791, the whole of January mild\r\nwith heavy rains; and lastly 1792, “some hard frost in January, but\r\nmostly wet and mild.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing certainly in this record to suggest that any material\r\nchange has taken place in our January weather during the last eight\r\nyears. And if we had given the record of the entire winter for each of\r\nthe years above dealt with the result would have been the same.\r\n\r\nWe have, in fact, very striking evidence in Gilbert White’s account\r\nof the cold weather of December, 1784, which he specially describes\r\nas “very extraordinary,” to show that neither our severe nor our\r\naverage winter weather can differ materially from that which people\r\nexperienced in the eighteenth century. “In the evening of December 9,”\r\nhe says, “the air began to be so very sharp that we thought it would be\r\ncurious to attend to the motions of a thermometer; we therefore hung\r\nout two, one made by Martin and one by Dolland” (_sic_, presumably\r\nDollond), “which soon began to show us what we were to expect; for by\r\nten o’clock they fell to twenty-one, and at eleven to four, when we\r\nwent to bed. On the 10th, in the morning the quicksilver in Dolland’s\r\nglass was down to half a degree below zero, and that of Martin’s, which\r\nwas absurdly graduated only to four degrees above zero, sank quite\r\ninto the brass guard of the ball, so that when the weather became most\r\ninteresting this was useless. On the 10th, at eleven at night, though\r\nthe air was perfectly still, Dolland’s glass went down to one degree\r\nbelow zero!” The note of exclamation is White’s. He goes on to speak\r\nof “this strange severity of the weather,” which was not exceeded\r\nthat winter, or at any time during the twenty-four years of White’s\r\nobservations. Within the last quarter of a century, the thermometer,\r\non more than one occasion, has shown two or three degrees below zero.\r\nCertainly the winters cannot be supposed to have been ordinarily\r\nseverer than ours in the latter half of the last century, when we find\r\nthat thermometers, by well-known instrument makers, were so constructed\r\nas to indicate no lower temperature than four degrees above zero.\r\n\r\nLet us return, after this somewhat long digression, to the levelling\r\naction of rain and rivers.\r\n\r\nIf we consider this action alone, we cannot but recognize in it a cause\r\nsufficient to effect the removal of all the higher parts of the land\r\nto low levels, and eventually of all the low-lying land to the sea, in\r\nthe course of such periods as geology makes us acquainted with. The\r\nmud-banks at the mouths of rivers show only a part of what rain and\r\nriver action is doing, yet consider how enormous is the mass which is\r\nthus carried into the sea. It has been calculated that in a single week\r\nthe Ganges alone carries away from the soil of India and delivers\r\ninto the sea twice as much solid substance as is contained in the\r\ngreat pyramid of Egypt. “The Irrawaddy,” says Sir J. Herschel, “sweeps\r\noff from Burmah 62 cubit feet of earth in every second of time on an\r\naverage, and there are 86,400 seconds in every day, and 365 days in\r\nevery year; and so on for other rivers. Nor is there any reason to fear\r\nor hope that the rains will cease, and this destructive process come to\r\nan end. For though the quantity of water on the surface of the earth\r\nis probably undergoing a slow process of diminution, small portions of\r\nit year by year taking their place as waters under the earth,[44] yet\r\nthese processes are far too slow to appreciably affect the supply of\r\nwater till a far longer period has elapsed than that during which (in\r\nall probability) life can continue upon the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the force really represented by the downfall of rain,\r\nwe need not greatly wonder that the levelling power of rain is so\r\neffective. The sun’s heat is the true agent in thus levelling the\r\nearth, and if we regard, as we justly may, the action of water, whether\r\nin the form of rain or river, or of sea-wave raised by wind or tide, as\r\nthe chief levelling and therefore destructive force at work upon the\r\nearth, and the action of the earth’s vulcanian energies as the chief\r\nrestorative agent, then we may fairly consider the contest as lying\r\nbetween the sun’s heat and the earth’s internal heat. There can be\r\nlittle question as to what would be the ultimate issue of the contest\r\nif land and sea and air all endured or were only so far modified as\r\nthey were affected by these causes. Sun-heat would inevitably prevail\r\nin the long run over earth-heat. But we see from the condition of\r\nour moon how the withdrawal of water and air from the scene must\r\ndiminish the sun’s power of levelling the irregularities of the earth’s\r\nsurface. We say advisedly _diminish_, not _destroy_; for there can be\r\nno question that the solar heat alternating with the cold of the long\r\nlunar night is still at work levelling, however slowly, the moon’s\r\nsurface; and the same will be the case with our earth when her oceans\r\nand atmosphere have disappeared by slow processes of absorption.\r\n\r\nThe power actually at work at present in producing rain, and so,\r\nindirectly, in levelling the earth’s surface, is enormous. I have shown\r\nthat the amount of heat required to evaporate a quantity of water which\r\nwould cover an area of 100 square miles to a depth of one inch would\r\nbe equal to the heat which would be produced by the combustion of half\r\na million tons of coals, and that the amount of force of which this\r\nconsumption of heat would be the equivalent corresponds to that which\r\nwould be required to raise a weight of upwards of one thousand millions\r\nof tons to a height of one mile.[45] When we remember that the land\r\nsurface of the earth amounts to about fifty millions of square miles,\r\nwe perceive how enormous must be the force-equivalent of the annual\r\nrainfall of our earth. We are apt to overlook when contemplating the\r\nsilent and seemingly quiet processes of nature—such as the formation\r\nof the rain-cloud or the precipitation of rain—the tremendous energy\r\nof the forces really causing these processes. “I have seen,” says\r\nProfessor Tyndall, “the wild stone-avalanches of the Alps, which smoke\r\nand thunder down the declivities with a vehemence almost sufficient to\r\nstun the observer. I have also seen snow-flakes descending so softly\r\nas not to hurt the fragile spangles of which they were composed; yet\r\nto produce from aqueous vapour a quantity which a child could carry of\r\nthat tender material demands an exertion of energy competent to gather\r\nup the shattered blocks of the largest stone-avalanche I have ever\r\nseen, and pitch them to twice the height from which they fell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ANCIENT BABYLONIAN ASTROGONY._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is singular to consider how short a time elapsed, after writings\r\nin the arrow-headed or cuneiform letters (the Keilschriften of the\r\nGermans) were discovered, before, first, the power of interpreting them\r\nwas obtained, and, secondly, the range of the cuneiform literature\r\n(so to speak) was recognized. Not more than ninety years have passed\r\nsince the first specimens of arrow-headed inscriptions reached Europe.\r\nThey had been known for a considerable time before this. Indeed, it\r\nhas been supposed that the Assyrian letters referred to by Herodotus,\r\nThucydides, and Pliny, were in this character. Della Valle and\r\nFigueroa, early in the seventeenth century, described inscriptions in\r\narrow-headed letters, and hazarded the idea that they are to be read\r\nfrom left to right. But no very satisfactory evidence was advanced to\r\nshow whether the inscriptions were to be so read, or from right to\r\nleft, or, as Chardin suggested, in vertical lines. The celebrated Olaus\r\nGerhard Tychsen, of Rostock, and other German philologists, endeavoured\r\nto decipher the specimens which reached Europe towards the end of the\r\nlast century; but their efforts, though ingenious and zealous, were not\r\nrewarded with success. In 1801 Dr. Hager advanced the suggestion that\r\nthe combinations formed by the arrow-heads did not represent letters\r\nbut words, if not entire sentences. Lichtenstein, on the other hand,\r\nmaintained that the letters belonged to an old form of the Arabic\r\nor Coptic character; and he succeeded to his own satisfaction in\r\nfinding various passages from the Koran in the cuneiform inscriptions.\r\nDr. Grotefend was the first to achieve any real success in this line\r\nof research. It is said that he was led to take up the subject by a\r\nslight dispute with one of his friends, which led to a wager that he\r\nwould decipher one of the cuneiform inscriptions. The results of his\r\ninvestigations were that cuneiform inscriptions are alphabetical, not\r\nhieroglyphical; that the language employed is the basis of most of the\r\nEastern languages; and that it is written from right to left. Since\r\nhis time, through the labours of Rich, Botta, Rawlinson, Hincks, De\r\nSaulcy, Layard, Sayce, George Smith, and others, the collection and\r\ninterpretation of the arrow-headed inscriptions have been carried\r\nout with great success. We find reason to believe that, though the\r\noriginal literature of Babylon was lost, the tablet libraries of\r\nAssyria contained copies of most of the writings of the more ancient\r\nnation. Amongst these have been found the now celebrated descriptions\r\nof the Creation, the Fall of Man, the Deluge, the Tower of Babel, and\r\nother matters found in an abridged and expurgated form in the book of\r\nGenesis. It is to that portion of the Babylonian account which relates\r\nto the creation of the sun and moon and stars that I wish here to call\r\nattention. It is not only curious in itself, but throws light, in my\r\nopinion, on questions of considerable interest connected with the views\r\nof ancient Eastern nations respecting the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, before considering the passage in question, to consider\r\nbriefly—though we may not be able definitely to determine—the real\r\nantiquity of the Babylonian account.\r\n\r\nIn Smith’s interesting work on the Chaldæan account of Genesis, the\r\nquestion whether the Babylonian account preceded the writing of the\r\nbook of Genesis, or _vice versâ_, is not definitely dealt with.\r\nProbably this part of his subject was included among the “important\r\ncomparisons and conclusions with respect to Genesis” which he preferred\r\nto avoid, as his “desire was first to obtain the recognition of the\r\nevidence without prejudice.” It might certainly have interfered to\r\nsome degree with the unprejudiced recognition of the evidence of the\r\ntablets if it had been maintained by him, and still more if he had\r\ndemonstrated, that the Babylonian is the earlier version. For the\r\naccount in the book of Genesis, coming thus to be regarded as merely an\r\nexpurgated version of a narrative originally containing much fabulous\r\nmatter, and not a little that is monstrous and preposterous, would\r\ncertainly not have been presented to us in quite that aspect in which\r\nit had long been regarded by theologians.\r\n\r\nBut although Mr. Smith states that he placed the various dates as low\r\nas he fairly could, considering the evidence,—nay, that he “aimed to\r\ndo this rather than to establish any system of chronology,”—there can\r\nbe no mistake about the relative antiquity which he in reality assigns\r\nto the Babylonian inscriptions. He states, indeed, that every copy of\r\nthe Genesis legends belongs to the reign of Assurbanipal, who reigned\r\nover Assyria B.C. 670. But it is “acknowledged on all hands that the\r\ntablets are not the originals, but are only copies from earlier texts.”\r\nThe Assyrians acknowledge themselves that this literature was borrowed\r\nfrom Babylonian sources, and of course it is to Babylonia we have to\r\nlook to ascertain the approximate dates of the original documents.\r\n“The difficulty,” he proceeds, “is increased by the following\r\nconsiderations: it appears that at an early period in Babylonian\r\nhistory a great literary development took place, and numerous works\r\nwere produced which embodied the prevailing myths, religion, and\r\nscience of that day. Written, many of them, in a noble style of poetry\r\non one side, or registering the highest efforts of their science on\r\nthe other, these texts became the standards for Babylonian literature,\r\nand later generations were content to copy these writings instead of\r\nmaking new works for themselves. Clay, the material on which they were\r\nwritten, was everywhere abundant, copies were multiplied, and by the\r\nveneration in which they were held these texts fixed and stereotyped\r\nthe style of Babylonian literature, and the language in which they\r\nwere written remained the classical style in the country down to the\r\nPersian conquest. Thus it happens that texts of Rim-agu, Sargon, and\r\nHammurabi, who were 1000 years before Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus,\r\nshow the same language as the texts of these later kings, there being\r\nno sensible difference in style to match the long interval between\r\nthem,”—precisely as a certain devotional style of writing of our own\r\nday closely resembles the style of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, then, from the style, determine the age of the original\r\nwritings from which the Assyrian tablets were copied. But there are\r\ncertain facts which enable us to form an opinion on this point.\r\nBabylonia was conquered about B.C. 1300, by Tugultininip, king of\r\nAssyria. For 250 years before that date a foreign race (called by\r\nBerosus, Arabs) had ruled in Babylonia. There is no evidence of any of\r\nthe original Babylonian Genesis tablets being written after the date of\r\nHammurabi, under whom it is supposed that this race obtained dominion\r\nin Babylonia. Many scholars, indeed, regard Hammurabi as much more\r\nancient; but none set him later than 1550 B.C.\r\n\r\nNow, before the time of Hammurabi several races of kings reigned,\r\ntheir reigns ranging over a period of 500 years. They were called\r\nchiefly Kings of Sumir and Akkad—that is, Kings of Upper and Lower\r\nBabylonia. It is believed that before this period,—ranging, say, from\r\nabout 2000 B.C. to 1550 B.C. (at least not later, though possibly,\r\nand according to many scholars, probably, far earlier),—the two\r\ndivisions of Babylonia were separate monarchies. Thus, evidence\r\nwhether any literature was written before or after B.C. 2000, may\r\nbe found in the presence or absence of mention, or traces, of this\r\ndivision of the Babylonian kingdom. Mr. Smith considers, for example,\r\nthat two works,—the great Chaldæan work on astrology, and a legend\r\nwhich he calls “The Exploits of Lubara,”—certainly belong to the\r\nperiod preceding B.C. 2000. In the former work, the subject of which\r\nspecially connects it, as will presently be seen, with the tablet\r\nrelating to the creation of the heavenly bodies, Akkad is always\r\nreferred to as a separate state.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Smith finds that the story of the Creation and Fall belongs\r\nto the upper or Akkad division of the country. The Izdubar legends,\r\ncontaining the story of the Flood, and what Mr. Smith regards as\r\nprobably the history of Nimrod, seem to belong to Sumir, the southern\r\ndivision of Babylonia. He considers the Izdubar legends to have been\r\nwritten at least as early as B.C. 2000. The story of the Creation\r\n“may not have been committed to writing so early;” but it also is\r\nof great antiquity. And these legends “were traditions before they\r\nwere committed to writing, and were common, in some form, to all the\r\ncountry.” Remembering Mr. Smith’s expressed intention of setting all\r\ndates as late as possible, his endeavour to do this rather than to\r\nestablish any system of chronology, we cannot misunderstand the real\r\ndrift of his arguments, or the real significance of his conclusion that\r\nthe period when the Genesis tablets were originally written extended\r\nfrom B.C. 2000 to B.C. 1550, or roughly synchronized with the period\r\nfrom Abraham to Moses, according to the ordinary chronology of our\r\nBibles. “During this period it appears that traditions of the creation\r\nof the universe, and human history down to the time of Nimrod, existed\r\nparallel to, and in some points identical with, those given in the book\r\nof Genesis.”\r\n\r\nThus viewing the matter, we recognize the interest of that passage in\r\nthe Babylonian Genesis tablets which corresponds with the account in\r\nthe book of Genesis respecting the creation of the heavenly bodies. We\r\nfind in it the earliest existent record of the origin of astrological\r\nsuperstitions. It does not express merely the vague belief, which\r\nmight be variously interpreted, that the sun and moon and stars were\r\nspecially created (after light had been created, after the firmament\r\nhad been formed separating the waters above from the waters below, and\r\nafter the land had been separated from the water) to be for signs and\r\nfor seasons for the inhabitants of the world—that is, of our earth.\r\nIt definitely states that those other suns, the stars, were set into\r\nconstellation figures for man’s benefit; the planets and the moon next\r\nformed for his use; and the sun set thereafter in the heavens as the\r\nchief among the celestial bodies.\r\n\r\nIt runs thus, so far as the fragments have yet been gathered together:—\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH TABLET OF CREATION LEGEND.\r\n\r\n   1.

It is important to notice\r\nits significance in this respect. We can understand now the meaning\r\nunderlying the words, “God said, Let there be lights in the firmament\r\nof the heavens, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for\r\nsigns and for seasons, and for days and years.” The order, indeed,\r\nin which the bodies are formed according to the biblical account is\r\ninverted. The greater light—the sun—is made first, to rule the day:\r\nthen the lesser light—the moon—to rule the night. These are the\r\nheavenly bodies which in this description rule the day of 24 hours.\r\nThe sun may be regarded also as ruling (according to the ancient view,\r\nas according to nature) the seasons and the year. The stars remain as\r\nset in the heaven for signs. “He made the stars also.” “And God set\r\nthem”—that is, the sun, moon, and stars—“in the firmament of the\r\nheaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over\r\nthe night,” and so forth.\r\n\r\nNo one can doubt, I conceive, that the biblical account is superior\r\nto the other, both in a scientific and in a literary sense. It states\r\nmuch less as actually known, and what it does state accords better with\r\nthe facts known in the writer’s day. Then, the Babylonian narrative,\r\nthough impressive in certain passages, is overloaded with detail.\r\nIn both accounts we find the heavenly bodies set in the firmament\r\nby a special creative act, and specially designed for the benefit\r\nof man. And in passing I would observe that the discovery of these\r\nBabylonian inscriptions, however they may be interpreted, and whether\r\nthey be regarded as somewhat earlier or somewhat later than the Bible\r\nnarrative, appears to dispose finally of the fantastic interpretation\r\nassigned by Hugh Miller and others to the biblical cosmogony, as\r\ncorresponding to a series of visions in which the varying aspects\r\nof the world were presented. It has long seemed to me an utterly\r\nuntenable proposition that a narrative seemingly intended to describe\r\ndefinitely a certain series of events should, after being for ages\r\nso interpreted, require now for its correct interpretation to be\r\nregarded as an account of a series of visions. If the explanation were\r\nreconcilable in any way with the words of Genesis, there yet seems\r\nsomething of profanity in imagining that men’s minds had thus been\r\nplayed with by a narrative purporting to be of one sort yet in reality\r\nof quite a different character. But whatever possibility there may be\r\n(and it can be but the barest possibility) that the Genesis narrative\r\nadmits of the vision interpretation, no one can reasonably attempt to\r\nextend that interpretation to the Babylonian account. So that either\r\na narrative from which the Genesis account was presumably derived was\r\ncertainly intended to describe a series of events, or else a narrative\r\nvery nearly as early as the Genesis account, and presumably derived\r\nfrom it at a time when its true meaning must have been known, presents\r\nthe sun, moon, and stars as objects expressly created and set in the\r\nsky after the earth had been formed, and for the special benefit of man\r\nas yet uncreated.\r\n\r\nI am not concerned, however, either to dwell upon this point, or to\r\ninsist on any of its consequences. Let us return to the consideration\r\nof the Babylonian narrative as it stands.\r\n\r\nWe find twelve constellations or signs of the zodiac are mentioned\r\nas set to fix the year. I am inclined to consider that the preceding\r\nwords, “stars, their appearance in figures of animals he arranged,”\r\nrelate specially to the stars of the zodiac. The inventor of this\r\nastrogony probably regarded the stars as originally scattered in an\r\nirregular manner over the heavens,—rather as chaotic material from\r\nwhich constellations might be formed, than as objects separately and\r\nexpressly created. Then they were taken and formed into figures of\r\nanimals, set in such a way as to fix the year through the observation\r\nof these constellations. It is hardly necessary, perhaps, to remind the\r\nreader that the word zodiac is derived from a Greek word signifying\r\nan animal, the original name of the zone being the zodiacal way,\r\nor the pathway of the animals. Our older navigators called it the\r\nBestiary.[46] “Twelve months or signs in three rows.” Smith takes the\r\nthree rows to mean (i.) the zodiacal signs, (ii.) the constellations\r\nnorth of the zodiac, and (iii.) the constellations south of the zodiac.\r\nBut this does not agree with the words “twelve signs in three rows.”\r\nPossibly the reference is to three circles, two bounding the zodiac\r\non the north and south respectively, the third central, the ecliptic,\r\nor track of the sun; or the two tropics and the equator may have\r\nbeen signified. Instead of “twelve signs in three rows,” we should,\r\nprobably, read “twelve signs along a triple band.” The description was\r\nwritten long after astronomical temples were first erected, and as\r\nthe designer of a zodiacal dome like that (far more recently) erected\r\nat Denderah would set the twelve zodiacal signs along a band formed\r\nby three parallel circles, marking its central line and its northern\r\nand southern limits, so we can understand the writer of the tablet\r\npresenting the celestial architect as working in the same lines, on a\r\ngrander scale; setting the twelve zodiacal signs on the corresponding\r\ntriple band in the heavens themselves.\r\n\r\nThe next point to be noticed in the Babylonian astrology is the\r\nreference to “wandering stars.” Mr. Smith remarks that the word\r\n_nibir_, thus translated, “is not the usual word for planet, and\r\nthere is a star called _Nibir_ near the place where the sun crossed\r\nthe boundary between the old and new years, and this star was one of\r\ntwelve supposed to be favourable to Babylonia.” “It is evident,” he\r\nproceeds, “from the opening of the inscription on the first tablet of\r\nthe Chaldæan astrology and astronomy, that the functions of the stars\r\nwere, according to the Babylonians, to act not only as regulators of\r\nthe seasons and the year, but also to be used as signs, as in Genesis\r\ni. 14; for in those ages it was generally believed that the heavenly\r\nbodies gave, by their appearance and positions, signs of events which\r\nwere coming on the earth.” The two verses relating to Nibir seem to\r\ncorrespond to no other celestial bodies but planets (unless, perhaps,\r\nto comets). If we regard Nibir as signifying any fixed star, we can\r\nfind no significance in the marking of the course of the star Nibir,\r\nthat it may do no injury and may not trouble any one. Moreover, as the\r\nfixed stars, the sun, and the moon, are separately described, it seems\r\nunlikely that the planets would be left unnoticed. In the biblical\r\nnarrative the reference to the celestial bodies is so short that we\r\ncan understand the planets being included in the words, “He made the\r\nstars also.” But in an account so full of detail as that presented\r\nin the Babylonian tablet, the omission of the planets would be very\r\nremarkable. It is also worthy of notice that in Polyhistor’s Babylonian\r\ntraditions, recorded by Berosus, we read that “Belus formed the stars,\r\nthe sun, the moon, and the five planets.”\r\n\r\nIn the tablet narrative the creator of the heavenly bodies is supposed\r\nto be Anu, god of the heavens. This is inferred by Mr. Smith from the\r\nfact “that the God who created the stars, fixed places or habitations\r\nfor Bel and Hea with himself in the heavens.” For according to the\r\nBabylonian theogony, the three gods Anu, Bel, and Hea share between\r\nthem the divisions of the face of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe account of the creation of the moon is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting part of the narrative. We see that, according to the\r\nBabylonian philosophy, the earth is regarded as formed from the waters\r\nand resting after its creation above a vast abyss of chaotic water.\r\nWe find traces of this old hypothesis in several biblical passages,\r\nas, for instance, in the words of the Third Commandment, “the heaven\r\nabove, the earth beneath, and the waters under the earth;” and again\r\nin Proverbs xxx. 4, “Who hath bound the waters in a garment? who\r\nhath established all the ends of the earth?” “The great gates in the\r\ndarkness shrouded, the fastenings strong on the left and right,” in the\r\nBabylonian account, refer to the enclosure of the great infernal lake,\r\nso that the waters under the earth might not overwhelm the world. It\r\nis from out the dark ocean beneath the earth that the god Anu calls\r\nthe moon into being. He opens the mighty gates shrouded in the nether\r\ndarkness, and creates a vast whirlpool in the gloomy ocean; then “at\r\nhis bidding, from the turmoil arose the moon like a giant bubble, and\r\npassing through the open gates mounted on its destined way across the\r\nvaults of heaven.” It is strange to reflect that in quite recent times,\r\nat least 4000 years after the Babylonian tablet was written, and who\r\nshall tell how many years after the tradition was first invented?—a\r\ntheory of the moon’s origin not unlike the Babylonian hypothesis has\r\nbeen advanced, despite overwhelming dynamical objections; and a modern\r\nparadoxist has even pointed to the spot beneath the ocean where a\r\nsudden increase of depth indicates that matter was suddenly extruded\r\nlong ago, and driven forcibly away from the earth to the orbit along\r\nwhich that expelled mass—our moon—is now travelling.\r\n\r\nIt would have been interesting to have known how the Babylonian tablet\r\ndescribed the creation of Shamas, the sun; though, so far as can be\r\njudged from the fragments above quoted, there was not the same fulness\r\nof detail in this part of the description as in that relating to the\r\nmoon. Mr. Smith infers that the Babylonians considered the moon the\r\nmore important body, unlike the writer or compiler of the book of\r\nGenesis, who describes the sun as the greater light. It does not seem\r\nto follow very clearly, however, from the tablet record, that the\r\nsun was considered inferior to the moon in importance, and certainly\r\nwe cannot imagine that the Babylonians considered the moon a greater\r\nlight. The creation of the stars precedes that of the moon, though\r\nmanifestly the moon was judged to be more important than the stars. Not\r\nimprobably, therefore, the sun, though following the moon in order of\r\ncreation, was regarded as the more important orb of the two. In fact,\r\nin the Babylonian as in the (so-called) Mosaic legend of Creation,\r\nthe more important members of a series of created bodies are, in some\r\ncases, created last—man last of all orders of animated beings, for\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now from the consideration of the Babylonian tradition of\r\nthe creation of the heavenly bodies to note how the biblical account\r\ndiffers from it, not only or chiefly in details, but in general\r\ncharacter, we seem to recognize in the latter a determination to\r\ndetach from the celestial orbs the individuality, so to speak, which\r\nthe older tradition had given to them. The account in Genesis is not\r\nonly simpler, and, in a literary sense, more effective, but it is in\r\nanother sense purified. The celestial bodies do not appear in it as\r\ncelestial beings. The Babylonian legend is followed only so far as it\r\ncan be followed consistently with the avoidance of all that might tempt\r\nto the worship of the sun, moon, and stars. The writer of the book of\r\nGenesis, whether Moses or not, seems certainly to have shared the views\r\nof Moses as to the Sabæanism of the nation from which the children\r\nof Abraham had separated. Moses warned the Israelite,—“Take good\r\nheed unto thyself, lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven; and when\r\nthou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of\r\nheaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the\r\nLord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.” So\r\nthe writer of Genesis is careful to remove from the tradition which he\r\nfollows all that might suggest the individual power and influence of\r\nthe heavenly bodies. The stars are to be for signs, but we read nothing\r\nof the power of the wandering stars “to do injury or trouble any one.”\r\n(That is, not in the book of Genesis. In the song of Deborah we find,\r\nthough perhaps only in a poetic fashion, the old influences assigned\r\nto the planets, when the singer says that the “stars in their courses\r\nfought against Sisera.” Deborah, however, was a woman, and women have\r\nalways been loth and late to give up ancient superstitions.) Again, the\r\nsun and the moon in Genesis are the greater and the lesser lights, not,\r\nas in the Babylonian narrative, the god Shamas and the god Uru.\r\n\r\nWe may find a parallel to this treatment of the Babylonian myth in the\r\ntreatment by Moses of the observance of the Sabbath, a day of rest\r\nwhich the Babylonian tablets show to have had, as for other reasons\r\nhad been before suspected, an astrological significance. The Jewish\r\nlawgiver does not do away with the observance; in fact, he was probably\r\npowerless to do away with it. At any rate, he suffers the observance\r\nto remain, precisely as the writer of the book of Genesis retains the\r\nBabylonian tradition of the creation of the celestial bodies. But he\r\nis careful to expurgate the Chaldæan observance, just as the writer\r\nof Genesis is careful to expurgate the Babylonian tradition. The week\r\nas a period is no longer associated with astrological superstitions,\r\nnor the Sabbath rest enjoined as a fetish. Both ideas are directly\r\nassociated with the monotheistic principle which primarily led to the\r\nseparation of the family of Abraham from the rest of the Chaldæan race.\r\nIn Babylonia, the method of associating the names of the sun, moon,\r\nand stars with the days, doubtless had its origin. Saturn was the\r\nSabbath star, as it is still called (Sabbatai) in the Talmud. But, as\r\nProfessor Tischendorf told Humboldt, in answer to a question specially\r\naddressed to him on the subject, “there is an entire absence in both\r\nthe Old and New Testaments, of any traces of names of week-days taken\r\nfrom the planets.” The lunar festivals, again, though unquestionably\r\nSabaistic in their origin, were apparently too thoroughly established\r\nto be discarded by Moses; nay, he was even obliged to permit the\r\ncontinuance of many observances which suspiciously resembled the old\r\nofferings of sacrifice to the moon as a deity. He had also to continue\r\nthe sacrifice of the passover, the origin of which was unmistakably\r\nastronomical,—corresponding in time to the sun’s passage across the\r\nequator, or rather to the first lunar month following and including\r\nthat event. But he carefully dissociates both the lunar and the\r\nlunisolar sacrifices from their primary Sabaistic significance. In\r\nfact, the history of early Hebrew legislation, so far as it related to\r\nreligion, is the history of a struggle on the part of the lawgivers and\r\nthe leaders of opinion against the tendency of the people to revert to\r\nthe idolatrous worship of their ancestors and of races closely akin to\r\nthem—especially against the tendency to the worship of the sun and\r\nmoon and all the host of heaven.\r\n\r\nIn the very fact, however, that this contest was maintained, while yet\r\nthe Hebrew cosmogony, and in particular the Hebrew astrogony, contains\r\nindubitable evidence of its origin in the poetical myths of older\r\nBabylonia, we find one of the strongest proofs of the influence which\r\nthe literature of Babylon, when at the fulness of its development,\r\nexerted upon surrounding nations. This influence is not more clearly\r\nshown even by the fact that nearly 2000 years after the decay of\r\nBabylonian literature, science, and art, a nation like the Assyrians,\r\nengaged in establishing empire rather than in literary and scientific\r\npursuits, should have been at the pains to obtain copies of many\r\nthousands of the tablet records which formed the libraries of older\r\nBabylonia. In both circumstances we find good reason for hoping that\r\ncareful search among Assyrian and Babylonian ruins may not only be\r\nrewarded by the discovery of many other portions of the later Assyrian\r\nlibrary (which was also in some sense a museum), but that other and\r\nearlier copies of the original Babylonian records may be obtained.\r\nFor it seems unlikely that works so valuable as to be thought worth\r\nrecopying after 1500 or 2000 years, in Assyria, had not been more than\r\nonce copied during the interval in Babylonia. “Search in Babylonia,”\r\nsays Mr. Smith, “would no doubt yield earlier copies of all these\r\nworks, but that search has not yet been instituted, and for the present\r\nwe have to be contented with our Assyrian copies. Looking, however, at\r\nthe world-wide interest of the subjects, and at the important evidence\r\nwhich perfect copies of these works would undoubtedly give, there can\r\nbe no doubt,” Mr. Smith adds, “that the subject of further search and\r\ndiscovery will not slumber, and that all as yet known will one day be\r\nsuperseded by newer texts and fuller and more perfect light.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\n  Edinburgh & London\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] More strictly, it plays the same part as a glass screen before a\r\nglowing fire. When the heat of the fire falls on such a screen (through\r\nwhich light passes readily enough), it is received by the glass,\r\nwarming the glass up to a certain point, and the warmed glass emits in\r\nall directions the heat so received; thus scattering over a large space\r\nthe rays which, but for the glass, would have fallen directly upon the\r\nobjects which the screen is intended to protect.\r\n\r\n[2] The case here imagined is not entirely hypothetical. We examine\r\nMercury and Venus very nearly under the conditions here imagined; for\r\nwe can obtain only spectroscopic evidence respecting the existence\r\nof water on either planet. In the case of Mars we have telescopic\r\nevidence, and no one now doubts that the greenish parts of the planet\r\nare seas and oceans. But Venus and Mercury are never seen under\r\nconditions enabling the observer to determine the colour of various\r\nparts of their discs.\r\n\r\nI may add that a mistake, somewhat analogous to that which I have\r\ndescribed in the cases of an imagined observer of our earth, has\r\nbeen made by some spectroscopists in the case of the planets Jupiter\r\nand Saturn. In considering the spectroscopic evidence respecting\r\nthe condition of these planets’ atmospheres, they have overlooked\r\nthe circumstance that we can judge only of the condition of the\r\noutermost and coolest layers, for the lower layers are concealed\r\nfrom view by the enormous cloud masses, floating, as the telescope\r\nshows, in the atmospheric envelopes of the giant planets. Thus the\r\nGerman spectroscopist Vögel argues that because in the spectrum\r\nof Jupiter dark lines are seen which are known to belong to the\r\nabsorption-spectrum of aqueous vapour, the planet’s surface cannot be\r\nintensely hot. But Jupiter’s absorption-spectrum belongs to layers of\r\nhis atmosphere lying far above his surface. We can no more infer the\r\nactual temperature of Jupiter’s surface from the temperature of the\r\nlayers which produce his absorption-spectrum, than a visitor who should\r\nview our earth from outer space, observing the low temperature of the\r\nair ten or twelve miles above the sea-level, could infer thence the\r\nactual temperature of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n[3] In “Other Worlds than Ours,” I wrote as follows:—“The lines of\r\nhydrogen, which are so well marked in the solar spectrum, are not seen\r\nin the spectrum of Betelgeux. We are not to conclude from this that\r\nhydrogen does not exist in the composition of the star. We know that\r\ncertain parts of the solar disc, when examined with the spectroscope,\r\ndo not at all times exhibit the hydrogen lines, or may even present\r\nthem as bright instead of dark lines. It may well be that in Betelgeux\r\nhydrogen exists under such conditions that the amount of light it sends\r\nforth is nearly equivalent to the amount it absorbs, in which case its\r\ncharacteristic lines would not be easily discernible. In fact, it is\r\nimportant to notice generally, that while there can be no mistaking\r\nthe positive evidence afforded by the spectroscope as to the existence\r\nof any element in sun or star, the negative evidence supplied by the\r\nabsence of particular lines is not to be certainly relied upon.”\r\n\r\n[4] Dr. Draper remarks here in passing, “I do not think that, in\r\ncomparisons of the spectra of the elements and sun, enough stress has\r\nbeen laid on the general appearance of lines apart from their mere\r\nposition; in photographic representations this point is very prominent.”\r\n\r\n[5] The word “ignited” may mislead, and indeed is not correctly used\r\nhere. The oxygen in the solar atmosphere, like the hydrogen, is simply\r\nglowing with intensity of heat. No process of combustion is taking\r\nplace. Ignition, strictly speaking, means the initiation of the process\r\nof combustion, and a substance can only be said to be ignited when it\r\nhas been set burning. The word _glowing_ is preferable; or if reference\r\nis made to heat and light combined, then “glowing with intensity of\r\nheat” seems the description most likely to be correctly understood.\r\n\r\n[6] It would be an interesting experiment, which I would specially\r\nrecommend to those who, like Dr. Draper, possess instrumental means\r\nspecially adapted to the inquiry, to ascertain what variations, if any,\r\noccur in the solar spectrum when (i.) the central part of the disc\r\nalone, and (ii.) the outer part alone, is allowed to transmit light to\r\nthe spectroscope. The inquiry seems specially suited to the methods\r\nof spectral photography pursued by Dr. Draper, and by Dr. Huggins, in\r\nthis country. Still, I believe interesting results can be obtained even\r\nwithout these special appliances; and I hope before long to employ my\r\nown telescope in this department of research.\r\n\r\n[7] In 1860, a year of maximum sun-spot frequency, Cambridge won the\r\nUniversity boat-race; the year 1865, of minimum sun-spot frequency,\r\nmarked the middle of a long array of Oxford victories; 1872, the next\r\nmaximum, marked the middle of a Cambridge series of victories. May we\r\nnot anticipate that in 1878, the year of minimum spot frequency, Oxford\r\nwill win? [This prediction made in autumn, 1877, was fulfilled.] I\r\ndoubt not similar evidence might be obtained about cricket.\r\n\r\n[8] It must be understood that this remark relates only to the theory\r\nthat by close scrutiny of the sun a power of predicting weather\r\npeculiarities can be obtained, not to the theory that there may be\r\na cyclic association between sun-spots and the weather. If this\r\nassociation exists, yet no scrutiny of the sun can tell us more than\r\nwe already know, and it will scarcely be pretended that new solar\r\nobservatories could give us any better general idea of the progress of\r\nthe great sun-spot period than we obtain from observatories already in\r\nexistence, or, indeed, might obtain from the observations of a single\r\namateur telescopist.\r\n\r\nI think it quite possible that, from the systematic study of\r\nterrestrial relations, the existence of a cyclic association between\r\nthe great spot period and terrestrial phenomena may be demonstrated,\r\ninstead of being merely surmised, as at present. By the way, it may be\r\nworth noting that a prediction relative to the coming winter [that of\r\n1877–78] has been made on the faith of such association by Professor\r\nPiazzi Smyth. It runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Having recently computed the remaining observations of our\r\nearth-thermometers here, and prepared a new projection of all the\r\nobservations from their beginning in 1837 to their calamitous close\r\nlast year [1876]—results generally confirmatory of those arrived at in\r\n1870 have been obtained, but with more pointed and immediate bearing on\r\nthe weather now before us.\r\n\r\n“The chief features undoubtedly deducible for the past thirty-nine\r\nyears, after eliminating the more seasonal effects of ordinary summer\r\nand winter, are:—\r\n\r\n“1. Between 1837 and 1876 three great heat-waves, from without,\r\nstruck this part of the earth, viz., the first in 1846·5, the second\r\nin 1858·0, and the third in 1868·7. And unless some very complete\r\nalteration in the weather is to take place, the next such visitation\r\nmay be looked for in 1879·5, within limits of half a year each way.\r\n\r\n“2. The next feature in magnitude and certainty is that the periods\r\nof minimum temperature, or cold, are not either in, or anywhere near,\r\nthe middle time between the crests of those three chronologically\r\nidentified heat-waves, but are comparatively close up to them _on\r\neither side_, at a distance of about a year and a half, so that the\r\nnext such cold-wave is due at the end of the present year [1877].\r\n\r\n“This is, perhaps, not an agreeable prospect, especially if political\r\nagitators are at this time moving amongst the colliers, striving to\r\npersuade them to decrease the out-put of coal at every pit’s mouth.\r\nBeing, therefore, quite willing, for the general good, to suppose\r\nmyself mistaken, I beg to send you a first impression of plate 17 of\r\nthe forthcoming volume of observations of this Royal Observatory, and\r\nshall be very happy if you can bring out from the measures recorded\r\nthere any more comfortable view for the public at large.\r\n\r\n  “PIAZZI SMYTH,\r\n  “Astronomer-Royal for Scotland.”\r\n\r\nIf this prediction shall be confirmed [this was written in autumn,\r\n1877], it will afford an argument in favour of the existence of the\r\ncyclic relation suggested, but no argument for the endowment of solar\r\nresearch. Professor Smyth’s observations were not solar but terrestrial.\r\n\r\n[The prediction was not confirmed, the winter of 1877–78 being, on the\r\ncontrary, exceptionally mild.]\r\n\r\n[9] The reader unfamiliar with the principles of the telescope may\r\nrequire to be told that in the ordinary telescope each part of the\r\nobject-glass forms a complete image of the object examined. If, when\r\nusing an opera-glass (one barrel), a portion of the large glass be\r\ncovered, a portion of what had before been visible is concealed. But\r\nthis is not the case with a telescope of the ordinary construction. All\r\nthat happens when a portion of the object-glass is covered is that the\r\nobject appears in some degree less fully illuminated.\r\n\r\n[10] It may be briefly sketched, perhaps, in a note. The force\r\nnecessary to draw the earth inwards in such sort as to make her follow\r\nher actual course is proportional to (i) the square of her velocity\r\ndirectly, and (ii) her distance from the sun inversely. If we increase\r\nour estimate of the earth’s distance from the sun, we, in the same\r\ndegree, increase our estimate of her orbital velocity. The square of\r\nthis velocity then increases as the square of the estimated distance;\r\nand therefore, the estimated force sunwards is increased as the square\r\nof the distance on account of (i), and diminished as the distance on\r\naccount of (ii), and is, therefore, on the whole, increased as the\r\ndistance. That is, we now regard the sun’s action as greater at this\r\ngreater distance, and in the same degree that the distance is greater;\r\nwhereas, if it had been what we before supposed it, it would be less\r\nat the greater distance as the square of the distance (attraction\r\nvarying inversely as the square of the distance). Being greater as the\r\ndistance, instead of less as the square of the distance, it follows\r\nthat our estimate of the sun’s absolute force is now greater as the\r\ncube of the distance. Similarly, if we had diminished our estimate\r\nof the sun’s distance, we should have diminished our estimate of his\r\nabsolute power (or mass) as the cube of the distance. But our estimate\r\nof the sun’s volume is also proportional to the cube of his estimated\r\ndistance. Hence our estimate of his mass varies as our estimate of his\r\nvolume; or, our estimate of his mean density is constant.\r\n\r\n[11] Only very recently an asteroid, Hilda (153rd in order of\r\ndetection), has been discovered which travels very much nearer to the\r\npath of Jupiter than to that of Mars—a solitary instance in that\r\nrespect. Its distance (the earth’s distance being represented by\r\nunity), is 3·95, Jupiter’s being 5·20, and Mars’s 1·52; its period\r\nfalls short of 8 years by only two months, the average period of the\r\nasteroidal family being only about 4½ years. Five others, Cybele,\r\nFreia, Sylvia, Camilla, and Hermione, travel rather nearer to Jupiter\r\nthan to Mars; but the remaining 166 travel nearer to Mars, and most of\r\nthem much nearer.\r\n\r\n[12] Even this statement is not mathematically exact. If the rails are\r\nstraight and parallel, the ratio of approach and recession of an engine\r\non one line, towards or from an engine on the other, is never quite\r\nequal to the engines’ velocities added together; but the difference\r\namounts practically to nothing, except when the engines are near each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[13] I have omitted all reference to details; but in reality the\r\ndouble battery was automatic, the motion of the observing telescope,\r\nas different colours of the spectrum were brought into view, setting\r\nall the prisms of the double battery into that precise position which\r\ncauses them to show best each particular part of the spectrum thus\r\nbrought into view. It is rather singular that the first view I ever had\r\nof the solar prominences, was obtained (at Dr. Huggins’s observatory)\r\nwith this instrument of my own invention, which also was the first\r\npowerful spectroscope I had ever used or even seen.\r\n\r\n[14] It varies more in some months than in others, as the moon’s orbit\r\nchanges in shape under the various perturbing influences to which she\r\nis subject.\r\n\r\n[15] It may seem strange to say that one hundred and twenty years after\r\nthe passage of a comet which last passed in 1862, and was then first\r\ndiscovered, August meteors have been seen. But in reality, as we know\r\nthe period of that comet to be about one hundred and thirty years, we\r\nknow that the displays of the years 1840, 1841, etc., to 1850, must\r\nhave followed the preceding passage by about that interval of time.\r\n\r\n[16] The D line, properly speaking, as originally named by Fraunhofer,\r\nbelongs to sodium. The line spoken of above as the sierra D line is\r\none close by the sodium line, and mistaken for it when first seen in\r\nthe spectrum of the coloured prominences as a bright line. It does not\r\nappear as a dark line in the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\n[17] Since this was written, I have learned that Mr. Backhouse, of\r\nSunderland, announced similar results to those obtained at Dunecht, as\r\nseen a fortnight or so earlier.\r\n\r\n[18] Here no account is taken of the motions of the stars within the\r\nsystem; such motions must ordinarily be minute compared with the common\r\nmotion of the system.\r\n\r\n[19] Eight pictures of nebulæ were exhibited in illustration of this\r\npeculiarity.\r\n\r\n[20] Sir John Herschel long since pointed to the variation of our sun\r\nas a possible cause of such changes of terrestrial climate.\r\n\r\n[21] During these journeys the Atlantic was sounded, and Scoresby’s\r\nestimate of the enormous depth of the Atlantic to the north-west of\r\nSpitzbergen was fully confirmed, the line indicating a depth of more\r\nthan two miles. It was found also that Spitzbergen is connected with\r\nNorway by a submarine bank.\r\n\r\n[22] It is far from improbable that a change has taken place in the\r\nclimate of the part of the Arctic regions traversed by Koldewey; for\r\nthe Dutch seem readily to have found their way much further north two\r\ncenturies ago. Indeed, among Captain Koldewey’s results is one which\r\nseems to indicate the occurrence of such a change. The country he\r\nexplored was found to have been inhabited. “Numerous huts of Esquimaux\r\nwere seen, and various instruments and utensils of primitive form;\r\nbut for some reason or other the region seems to have been finally\r\ndeserted. The Polar bear reigns supreme on the glaciers, as the walrus\r\ndoes among the icebergs.” Not improbably the former inhabitants were\r\nforced to leave this region by the gradually increasing cold.\r\n\r\n[23] Dr. Emile Bessels was tried at New York in 1872, on the charge of\r\nhaving poisoned Captain Hall, but was acquitted.\r\n\r\n[24] The phenomena here described are well worth observing on their\r\nown account, as affording a very instructive and at the same time very\r\nbeautiful illustration of wave motions. They can be well seen at many\r\nof our watering-places. The same laws of wave motion can be readily\r\nillustrated also by throwing two stones into a large smooth pool, at\r\npoints a few yards apart. The crossing of the two sets of circular\r\nwaves produces a wave-net, the meshes of which vary in shape according\r\nto their position.\r\n\r\n[25] It is a pity that men of science so often forget, when addressing\r\nthose who are not men of science, or who study other departments than\r\ntheirs, that technical terms are out of place. Most people, I take it\r\nare more familiar, on the whole, with eyelids than with _palpebræ_.\r\n\r\n[26] This nautical expression is new to me. Top-gallants—fore,\r\nmain, and mizen—I know, and forecastle I know, but the top-gallant\r\nforecastle I do not know.\r\n\r\n[27] The instrument was lent to Mr. Huggins by Mr. W. Spottiswoode. It\r\nhas been recently employed successfully at Greenwich.\r\n\r\n[28] Thus in _Christie Johnstone_, written in 1853, when Flucker\r\nJohnstone tells Christie the story of the widow’s sorrows, giving\r\nit word for word, and even throwing in what dramatists call “the\r\nbusiness,” he says, “‘Here ye’ll play your hand like a geraffe.’\r\n‘Geraffe?’ she says; ‘that’s a beast, I’m thinking.’ ‘Na; it’s the\r\nthing on the hill that makes signals.’ ‘Telegraph, ye fulish goloshen!’\r\n‘Oo, ay, telegraph! geraffe’s sunnest said for a’.’” “Playing the hand\r\nlike a telegraph” would now be as unmeaning as Flucker Johnstone’s\r\noriginal description.\r\n\r\n[29] Not “to represent the gutta-percha,” as stated in the _Times_\r\naccount of Mr. Muirhead’s invention. The gutta-percha corresponds\r\nto the insulating material of the artificial circuit; viz., the\r\nprepared paper through which the current along the tinfoil strips acts\r\ninductively on the coating of tinfoil.\r\n\r\n[30] I must caution the reader against Fig. 348 in Guillemin’s\r\n_Application of the Physical Forces_, in which the part _c d_ of the\r\nwire is not shown. The two coils are in reality part of a single coil,\r\ndivided into two to permit of the bar being bent; and to remove the\r\npart _c d_ is to divide the wire, and, of course, break the current. It\r\nwill be seen that _c d_ passes from the remote side of coil _b c_, Fig.\r\n6, to the near side of coil _d e_. If it were taken round the remote\r\nside of the latter coil, the current along this would neutralize the\r\neffect of the current along the other.\r\n\r\n[31] The paper is soaked in dilute ferrocyanide of potassium, and the\r\npassage of the current forms a Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n[32] Sir W. Thomson states, in his altogether excellent article on the\r\nelectric telegraph, in Nichol’s _Cyclopædia_, that the invention of\r\nthis process is due to Mr. Bakewell.\r\n\r\n[33] It is to be noticed, however, that the recording pointer must\r\nalways mark its lines in the same direction, so that, unless a message\r\nis being transmitted at the same time that one is being received (in\r\nwhich case the oscillations both ways are utilized), the instrument\r\nworks only during one-half of each complete double oscillation.\r\n\r\n[34] It seems to me a pity that in the English edition of this work\r\nthe usual measures have not been substituted throughout. The book is\r\nnot intended or indeed suitable for scientific readers, who alone are\r\naccustomed to the metric system. Other readers do not care to have a\r\nlittle sum in reduction to go through at each numerical statement.\r\n\r\n[35] Hanno’s _Periplus_—the voyage of Hanno, chief of the\r\nCarthaginians, round the parts of Libya, beyond the Pillars of\r\nHercules, the narrative of which he posted up in the Temple of Kronos.\r\n\r\n[36] I may mention one which occurred within my own experience. A\r\nmastiff of mine, some years ago, was eating from a plate full of broken\r\nmeat. It was his custom to bury the large pieces when there was more\r\nthan he could get through. While he was burying a large piece, a cat\r\nran off with a small fragment. The moment he returned to the plate he\r\nmissed this, and, seeing no one else near the plate, he, in his own\r\nway, accused a little daughter of mine (some two or three years old)\r\nof the theft. Looking fiercely at her, he growled his suspicions, and\r\nwould not suffer her to escape from the corner where his plate stood\r\nuntil I dragged him away by his chain. Nor did he for some time forget\r\nthe wrong which he supposed she had done him, but always growled when\r\nshe came near his house.\r\n\r\n[37] It may be suggested, in passing, that the association which\r\nhas been commonly noticed between prominent eyeballs and command\r\nof language (phrenologists place the organ of language, in their\r\nunscientific phraseology, behind the eyeballs) may be related in\r\nsome degree to the circumstance that in gradually emerging from the\r\ncondition of an arboreal creature the anthropoid ape would not only\r\ncease to derive advantage from sunken eyes, but would be benefited by\r\nthe possession of more prominent eyeballs. The increasing prominence\r\nof the eyeballs would thus be a change directly associated with the\r\ngradual advance of the animal to a condition in which, associating\r\ninto larger and larger companies and becoming more and more dependent\r\non mutual assistance and discipline, they would require the use of a\r\ngradually extending series of vocal signs to indicate their wants and\r\nwishes to each other.\r\n\r\n[38] The word hypothesis is too often used as though it were synonymous\r\nwith theory, so that Newton’s famous saying, “Hypotheses non fingo”\r\nhas come to be regarded by many as though it expressed an objection on\r\nNewton’s part against the formation of theories. This would have been\r\nstrange indeed in the author of the noblest theory yet propounded by\r\nman in matters scientific. Newton indicates his meaning plainly enough,\r\nin the very paragraph in which the above expression occurs, defining an\r\nhypothesis as an opinion not based on phenomena.\r\n\r\n[39] I find it somewhat difficult to understand clearly Mr. Mivart’s\r\nown position with reference to the general theory of evolution. He\r\ncertainly is an evolutionist, and as certainly he considers natural\r\nselection combined with the tendency to variation (as ordinarily\r\nunderstood) insufficient to account for the existence of the various\r\nforms of animal and vegetable existence. He supplies the missing factor\r\nin “an innate law imposed on nature, by which new and definite species,\r\nunder definite conditions, emerged from a latent and potential being\r\ninto actual and manifest existence;” and, so far as can be judged,\r\nhe considers that the origin of man himself is an instance of the\r\noperation of this law.\r\n\r\n[40] The Middle Tertiary period—the Tertiary, which includes the\r\nEocene, Miocene, and Pliocene periods, being the latest of the three\r\ngreat periods recognized by geologists as preceding the present\r\nera, which includes the entire history of man as at present known\r\ngeologically.\r\n\r\n[41] Closely following in this respect his illustrious namesake\r\nRoger, who writes, in the sixth chapter of his _Opus Majus_, “_Sine\r\nexperientia nihil sufficienter sciri potest._”\r\n\r\n[42] Fibrine and albumen are identical in composition. _Caseine_, which\r\nis the coagulable portion of milk, is composed in the same manner. The\r\nchief distinction between the three substances consists in their mode\r\nof coagulation; fibrine coagulating spontaneously, albumen under the\r\naction of heat, and caseine by the action of acetic acid.\r\n\r\n[43] To this article of the Professor’s faith decided objection must be\r\ntaken, however.\r\n\r\n[44] Those whose custom it is to regard all theorizing respecting\r\nthe circumstances revealed by observation as unscientific, may read\r\nwith profit an extremely speculative passage in Newton’s _Principia_\r\nrelating to the probable drying up of the earth in future ages. “As the\r\nseas,” he says, “are absolutely necessary to the constitution of our\r\nearth, that from them the sun, by its heat, may exhale a sufficient\r\nquantity of vapours, which, being gathered together into clouds, may\r\ndrop down in rain, for watering of the earth, and for the production\r\nand nourishment of vegetables; or being condensed with cold on the tops\r\nof mountains (as some philosophers with reason judge), may run down in\r\nsprings and rivers; so for the conservation of the seas and fluids of\r\nthe planets, comets seem to be required, that, from their exhalations\r\nand vapours condensed, the wastes of the planetary fluids spent upon\r\nvegetation and putrefaction, and converted into dry earth, may be\r\nultimately supplied and made up; for all vegetables entirely derive\r\ntheir growths from fluids, and afterwards, in great measure, are turned\r\ninto dry earth by putrefaction; and a sort of slime is always found\r\nto settle at the bottom of putrefied fluids; and hence it is that the\r\nbulk of the solid earth is continually increased; and the fluids, if\r\nthey are not supplied from without, must be in a continual decrease,\r\nand quite fail at last. I suspect, moreover, that it is chiefly from\r\nthe comets that spirit comes which is indeed the smallest but the most\r\nsubtle and useful part of our air, and so much required to sustain the\r\nlife of all things with us.”\r\n\r\n[45] See my “Science Byways,” pp. 244, 245.\r\n\r\n[46] The following passage from Admiral Smyth’s Bedford Catalogue is\r\nworth noticing in this connection:—“We find that both the Chinese and\r\nthe Japanese had a zodiac consisting of animals, as _zodiacs_ needs\r\nmust, among which they placed a tiger, a peacock, a cat, an alligator,\r\na duck, an ape, a hog, a rat, and what not. Animals also formed the\r\n_Via Solis_ of the Kirghis, the Mongols, the Persians, the Mantshus,\r\nand the ancient Turks; and the Spanish monks in the army of Cortes\r\nfound that the Mexicans had a zodiac with strange creatures in the\r\ndepartments. Such a striking similitude is assuredly indicative of a\r\ncommon origin, since the coincidences are too exact in most instances\r\nto be the effect of chance; but where this origin is to be fixed has\r\nbeen the subject of interminable discussions, and learning, ignorance,\r\nsagacity, and prejudice have long been in battle array against each\r\nother. Diodorus Siculus considers it to be Babylonian, but Bishop\r\nWarburton, somewhat dogmatically tells us, ‘Brute worship gave rise to\r\nthe Egyptian asterisms prior to the time of Moses.’” There is now, of\r\ncourse, very little reason for questioning that Egyptian astronomy was\r\nborrowed from Babylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nCover created by Transcriber and placed in the Public Domain.\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nSome ditto marks have been replaced by the actual text.\r\n\r\nPage 83: In the illustration, “O” should be “C”.\r\n\r\nPage 171: There is no obvious closing quotation mark to match the\r\nopening mark at “of most unusual age and thickness”.\r\n\r\nPage 192: “Divided even between the ocean” may be a misprint for\r\n“evenly”.\r\n\r\nPage 197: No matching closing quotation mark for the opening mark at\r\n“the small bright spot”.\r\n\r\nPage 222: Transcriber added an opening quotation mark at “Down his\r\nback” to match the closing mark after “He was seen by every one on\r\nboard.”\r\n\r\nPage 230: No matching closing quotation mark for the opening mark at “a\r\nwhale of large size”.\r\n\r\nPage 302: Transcriber added an opening quotation mark at “About fifty\r\nyears ago” to match the closing mark after “fed himself with the other.”\r\n\r\nPage 372: No matching opening quotation mark for the closing mark after\r\n“its lower extremity.”\r\n\r\nPage 385: No matching closing quotation mark for the opening mark at\r\n“sweeps off from”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Pleasant Ways in Science, by Richard A.
