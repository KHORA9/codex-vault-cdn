Now, could anybody,\r\nPansy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" answered Pansy, shaking her pretty head. Pansy was hardly eight\r\nyears old, and always agreed with her older sister, who was nearly\r\neleven.\r\n\r\n\"How I wish he were home again from his old ship,\" sighed Aralia, \"and\r\nTom with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ara, we can sit here hours and hours every day and watch the sea,\r\ncan't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and we shall easily know the ship. As she goes by, shell set all\r\nher flags a-flying, and, if Father isn't at home, Mother will send up our\r\ngreat red flag on the garden pole. Oh dear! I could nearly cry for joy to\r\nthink of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"And me too!\" said Pansy.\r\n\r\n\"And me too!\" Veevee seemed to say, as he gave a short bark, and, jumping\r\ndown from the seat, ran round the garden, looking like a fluffy white\r\nball.\r\n\r\nThe sea was very blue, only patched with green wherever a cloud-shadow\r\nfell on it. Down beneath the cliff on which the cottage stood, the waves\r\nbroke lazily in long white lines of foam. On the sea itself were vessels\r\nof almost every kind, from the little fishing craft with brown sails to\r\ngreat ships sailing away to distant lands.\r\n\r\nAralia knew what class of vessel each was by its rig; her best of uncles\r\nhad taught her. And well could she use the spy-glass too, which she now\r\nheld to her right eye. It had been hard at first to keep the left closed,\r\nbut she could manage it now quite easily without asking Pansy to clap a\r\nhand over it.\r\n\r\nSoon she began to talk in little gasps:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Pansy--I think--Oh, I'm nearly sure--yes--yes--it must be! it _is_\r\nUncle's ship! I can see the flags all a-flying--Hurrah! Come and look!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPansy sat on her sister's knee and peeped through the glass. Then both\r\nthe children started up and waved their arms in the air at the far-off\r\nship. They were just about to rush off to tell Mother, when their cousin\r\nFrank came up. He was a lad of about thirteen or fourteen, but he was so\r\ntall and manly that he looked older.\r\n\r\nFrank came into the garden with a rush and a run when he heard the girls\r\ncall out. A fishing basket was slung over his back, from which the tails\r\nof fish stuck out, showing what good sport he had had.\r\n\r\n\"Hillo, Ara! Hillo, Pansy! What are you dancing and 'hoo-laying' about?\r\nBeen stung by a wasp, my little Pansy Blossom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Frank,\" cried the elder girl, \"look through the glass! Uncle's\r\ncoming! Look at the ship, and all the flags.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was almost as excited now as the girls themselves, and presently\r\nthey were all running in a string through the pretty garden towards the\r\ncottage with the news, Veevee bringing up the rear and barking bravely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRat-tat-tat at the door next afternoon, and little Pansy ran to open it,\r\nexpecting to see the postman, but the knocking was only a bit of Tom's\r\nfun. Frank had left for Hull the evening before to meet him, and here was\r\nTom the sailor, tall and bonny and dark. Pansy jumped into his arms like\r\na baby, Aralia rushed to meet him, and his mother came out, though a\r\nlittle more slowly. When the bustle was all over, and Tom had answered\r\nnearly a hundred questions, they all went in to tea.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Aralia, Uncle is coming up from Hull with Father and Cousin Frank,\r\nand we shall stop here three whole days before we go back to clear ship\r\nand pay off\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" added Tom, \"Uncle has something so strange and nice to tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Tom?\" said his two sisters, both in a breath as it were.\r\n\r\n\"I can't, won't, and sha'n't tell you, girls,\" cried Tom, laughing,\r\n\"because that would spoil the fun when Uncle comes.\"\r\n\r\nSo all, even Veevee, who would not get off Tom's knees for a minute, had\r\nto be as patient as they could. But the time passed so quickly, listening\r\nto all this hearty young sailor had to tell of his voyage to the far\r\nnorth, that before anyone was aware it was nearly seven o'clock.\r\n\r\nAnd now down jumps Veevee and runs towards the door, barking aloud as if\r\nhe were a very big dog.\r\n\r\n\"They're coming! They're coming! Veevee knows!\" And coming they were\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nTom had had a hearty welcome when he arrived, but when this best of\r\nuncles at last managed to sit down on the sofa: \"Shiver my timbers,\r\nsister,\" he said to Mrs. Dunlop, \"if it isn't worth while going all the\r\nway to the back of the North Pole just to get such a welcome home as\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nJack Staysail was a sailor every inch of him. He had roughed it so much\r\nin the Greenland seas, and been out in so many storms, that his face was\r\nas red as a boiled beet; but his eyes were as full of fun and merriment\r\nas a boy's.\r\n\r\n\"We're not all here yet,\" he said. \"I have asked my friend, Professor\r\nPeterkin, the Swede, to come in to-night with his mastiff.\" When their\r\nuncle mentioned the mastiff, Aralia and Pansy began to tremble for\r\nVeevee, but Tom only laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he said, \"although Briton--that's his name--is big enough to\r\ntackle a bear, he wouldn't injure a mouse.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly nine o'clock when the professor arrived. Briton marched in\r\nfirst, and a bigger and more noble-looking fellow was never seen. Veevee\r\nsaid he couldn't stand another dog in the place. So he started up,\r\nbarking loudly, and offering to fight the mastiff to the death on the\r\nspot. But Briton stepped gingerly over the little dog, and went and lay\r\nquietly down on the rug.\r\n\r\nThen in bustled the professor himself, very droll, very small,\r\nclean-shaven, merry-eyed, and with as much hair on his great head as\r\nwould have stuffed a cushion. He bowed and smiled to all, patted the\r\nchildren, and at last sat down to supper.\r\n\r\nAll made a very hearty supper, though it was long past the children's\r\nbed-time. Only Uncle didn't come home every night, you know.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished, Briton had a huge dish of scraps; Veevee sat\r\nwatching him eat, and the children were very much surprised to see\r\nBriton shove one of the biggest and best morsels towards him. The tiny\r\ndog picked up the titbit and wagged his tail. After he had eaten it,\r\nhe went and lay down beside Briton on the hearth-rug.\r\n\r\nThe \"something nice\" that Uncle had to tell was soon told now.\r\nCaptain Staysail cleared his throat before he began: \"Ahem! Oh,\r\nyou're  all waiting, are you, to hear what I've got to say? Well,\r\nthen--ahem!--Professor Peterkin--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pete--Pete--Pete--Pete!\" cried the droll, wee man, stopping him, and\r\none would have thought he was calling a dog. \"I'm not going to be called\r\nProfessor, and I won't Peterkin. Just Pete, as I was on board ship, as I\r\nam to everybody, and must be to you.\r\n\r\n\"But just look here, Staysail, you're a sailor, and you can't make a\r\nspeech. Let me speak.\" And speak he did without waiting for a reply.\r\n\r\n\"It's all in a nutshell, dear Mr. and Mrs. Dunlop, and I'll tell you in\r\ntwo or three sentences what your worthy sailor-brother would have kept\r\nyou up all night to hear. Now listen! Briton, you lie down! Good again!\r\nNow I, Dan Peterkin, am a man who has been used to study hard, and think\r\nhard. You follow me so far? Good again!\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is one thing has taken me years to work out, and that is,\r\nwhere in this world gold and coal are to be found. And I've done it. I\r\ncan go right to the spots. One of them lies on an island right away up in\r\nthe Frozen North. And we're going there. Your brother, Mrs. Dunlop, is\r\ngoing to take me.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we may have some hardships. Paff! What do we care? We shall win\r\nsuch wealth as has never been seen before. You follow still? Good again!\r\nWell, I go to a town in the north last spring, when the seal ships are\r\nall there, and I look for an honest face. I find Staysail. I say to him:\r\n'You give me a passage to Greenland, my friend.' He say: 'What for I give\r\nyou passage?' I smile. I take him by one button, and pull him all the way\r\ninto a private room of the hotel. Briton follows. We all dine well--we\r\nall come out smiling--Briton too. And now, my friends, all is arranged.\r\nWe sail away and away and away next spring for the seas of ice and the\r\nislands of gold.\r\n\r\n\"That is all. You have followed me? Good again!\" And once more the\r\nprofessor sat down, and the big arm-chair seemed to swallow him up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAra and Pansy lay awake a long time that night thinking of what Pete had\r\nsaid. But the next day they went about their duties as usual. They did\r\nnot go to school, as they had a governess, of whom they were both very\r\nfond. Nearly half their day would be spent out-of-doors with her and\r\nVeevee. In spring and summer they would gather flowers inland, but what\r\nthey liked best was to play about on the sands, to go out boating with an\r\nold seaman they knew, or climb the rocks and get into very steep and\r\ngiddy places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPoor Frank Dunlop was an orphan, and was now the adopted son of Ara's\r\nfather. As for Tom, who was a year or two older, his father had wanted\r\nhim to go into business at home in England, but nothing would satisfy the\r\nlad but going to sea, so he had been sent to rough it with his uncle in\r\nthe stormy seas of the Frozen North. The cruise now ended was his second,\r\nand Tom wasn't tired of the sea yet.\r\n\r\nFrank went back to school, and appeared no more at the cottage until\r\nChristmas came round. Then not only Uncle, but Pete and Briton came to\r\nspend a whole fortnight with the Dunlop family, and to make their final\r\nplans for the spring. And I should say that no fortnight seemed to pass\r\nso quickly to the children as did the two weeks when their visitors\r\nstayed with them.\r\n\r\nAt last, one day in early spring, there left Hull on a trial trip one of\r\nthe handsomest little steamers, and, for her size, one of the strongest\r\nthat ever put to sea from that port. She was Captain Staysail's new ship,\r\nthe _Valhalla_. Everything on board, both on deck and between decks, and\r\nin the saloon, was as clean and beautiful as if she had been a royal\r\nyacht. The decks were as white as ivory, the polished wood shone in the\r\nsun, and the brass-work looked like gold. The saloon itself, with its\r\ncurtains, its mirrors, tables pillars, and piano, was really fit for a\r\nfairy princess to live in. Everything had been prepared under the eye of\r\nProfessor Peterkin himself, so everything was perfect in its way.\r\n\r\nPansy, who was on board, and had been peeping in some of the rooms, said\r\nto Aralia at last: \"Oh, Aralia, what a dear little doll's house of a\r\ncabin; I should like to live in it always!\"\r\n\r\nNeither of the children was sea-sick when the _Valhalla_ went out under\r\nsteam, and they had such fun with the sailors and the two dogs that they\r\nwere quite sorry when the ship once more steamed into port.\r\n\r\nAnd didn't everybody sleep soundly that night in the hotel! I should say\r\nso!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe merry month of May had hardly begun when the brave _Valhalla_ steamed\r\naway on her perilous cruise to the far and icy north.\r\n\r\nFrank, with his two little cousins, had begged leave to go to Hull in\r\norder to see the very, very last of the beautiful ship and that best of\r\nuncles, Captain Staysail. Leave had been given by their parents, because\r\n\"Wherever Frank is,\" said Mr. Dunlop, \"the children are sure to be safe.\"\r\n\r\nThere had been a good deal of stir and bustle on the very last evening,\r\nand many visitors had been to the _Valhalla_, for somehow word had gone\r\nout that Professor Peterkin, the great Swedish traveller, was off to find\r\nthe North Pole!\r\n\r\nAnd all believed that he would find it. Some of the sailors even went so\r\nfar as to say that he would bring it back with him rigged up as a mast of\r\nhis ship!\r\n\r\nBut by the time eight bells had rung out all was quiet. The hands had\r\nturned in, and only Tom and two men were left on watch.\r\n\r\n\"Go forward,\" said Tom, \"and have a cup of coffee and a smoke, and I'll\r\nsee to the safety of the ship here at the gangway.\"\r\n\r\nThe men took the young officer at his word, and it was not very long ere\r\ntheir smoke was finished, and they, too, were fast asleep. Had any other\r\neyes than Tom's been watching the shore, about half an hour afterwards,\r\nthey must have noticed that something very strange was taking place.\r\n\r\nDark figures could be seen drawing near with stealthy footsteps to the\r\nfarther end of the gangway. Then they stopped as if in fear and dread.\r\nBut Tom whistled a long, low whistle, and three figures, muffled in\r\noil-skins, stole along the gangway and stepped silently on deck.\r\n\r\nThen Tom sprang a small bull's-eye lantern, and let its light shine right\r\nin front of him, so that no one meeting him could have told who or what\r\nwas stealing up behind. In the same quiet way he led the little party\r\ndown a ladder to the deck below, and then beneath hammocks filled with\r\nsleeping sailors, and along a passage, until he came to a door, which he\r\ncarefully unlocked, and soon afterwards locked again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy midnight next night the _Valhalla_ was far out at sea, bearing to the\r\nnorth, for Captain Staysail did not mean to touch at any of the English\r\nor Scotch ports on this voyage.\r\n\r\nThe weather at first was very beautiful, and so it remained, with a calm\r\nsea and hardly a breath of wind, until nearly sunset of the second day.\r\nThen clouds began to bank up, dark and threatening, and the glass--so\r\nWebb, the first mate, reported to the captain--was going tumbling down.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to have a blow, sir,\" he said, \"and it's coming up sharp\r\nbehind us. I reckon, sir, we'll have a ten-knotter afore the middle watch\r\nis called!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, have the fires banked, Mr. Webb, as soon as the wind is\r\nstrong enough to get way on her. I wouldn't set too much sail, and if it\r\ndoes come a gale, I'd ease her right away. You know what she can do,\r\nMate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think that's all.\"\r\n\r\nBut the mate didn't move.\r\n\r\n\"Anything else, Mr. Webb?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something else, sir,\" said the mate rather sheepishly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, out with it. Why, you look as if you'd seen a ghost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, there is a ghost, or demon, or something aboard of this very\r\nship, and some of the crew are in a state next door to mutiny about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth do you mean, Mr. Webb?\"\r\n\r\nThe tall, handsome, fair-haired Webb leaned over the table and spoke to\r\nStaysail almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"It's the little professor they all blame, sir; and there are four of\r\nthem who swear the ship is haunted--that he keeps evil spirits under lock\r\nand key for'ard--\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but--Mr. Webb--Evil spirits under lock and key! Do you mean bad\r\nrum? And who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, sir! don't talk so loud. He's walking the deck now. It's the\r\nprofessor I mean, sir. As to the evil spirits, I've heard them\r\nmyself--mutter, mutter, squeak, squeak, squeak! Ugh! it is awful,\r\nsir--awful!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the mate shuddered as he spoke.\r\n\r\nNow, Staysail was always a good laugher, but at this tale he fairly\r\nyelled with laughter until everything jingled in the cabin, and the tears\r\nran down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe mate never moved a muscle.\r\n\r\n\"That awful fore-cabin, sir!\" he said. \"It's in there, and Broomberg, the\r\nFinlander, declares that if you don't land him and his mates at Bergen\r\nthey'll seize the ship and sail for Aberdeen.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why on earth don't you open the fore-cabin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's where it is, sir! The key is lost, or else the professor has\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\"\r\n\r\nA squall at that moment struck the ship and heeled her over. It blew with\r\ntremendous force for a time, and at last settled down to a steady gale.\r\nBut in less than an hour the captain's orders were carried out, and the\r\ngood ship _Valhalla_ was speeding before the wind at a good rate with\r\nvery little sail on her.\r\n\r\nThe storm increased towards midnight, and at that dark hour the\r\n_Valhalla_ had to lie to under almost bare poles. So busy had all hands\r\nbeen kept that there was very little time to think of ghosts or evil\r\nspirits, and now that the crew had a chance of turning in, it is needless\r\nto say that sleep was the first thing to be considered.\r\n\r\nBut fresh trouble came with the new day. The wind had gone down, and the\r\nsea as well, and the _Valhalla_ was now bowling along on a pretty even\r\nkeel, for the breeze was well astern.\r\n\r\nWebb, the mate, and Tom both slept in bunks in the same cabin. Just as\r\nthe steward was laying breakfast, Webb popped his head out from his cabin\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\n\"Hillo, steward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, sah!\" said Jake Brown, who, strange as it may seem, was a\r\ntall and important-looking black man, with hair as white as snow.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Master Tom? He hasn't been here all night. I slept too\r\nsound to take much notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sakes alive, no!\" cried burly Jake. \"I run and search de ship plenty\r\nquick.\" And away he went.\r\n\r\nWebb was dressed and leaving his cabin when Jake returned. But neither\r\nhigh nor low, fore nor aft, could Tom be found, nor had he been seen\r\nsince the main-topsail had carried away just before midnight.\r\n\r\nThe captain was now roused and the terrible news reported.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Tom! poor Tom! Washed overboard without a doubt!\" he said.\r\n\r\nTom had been a great favourite on board, and the news caused a general\r\ngloom all over the ship.\r\n\r\nBut Broomberg and his mates received the news in another way.\r\n\r\n\"It is von unlucky ship,\" cried the former, \"and did not those below hear\r\nthe shrieking of the ghosts when the waves and wind were highest? Come we\r\nto the captain at once, men. I will not sail in a haunted ship. No, no.\"\r\n\r\nSome minutes before eight bells rang out in the morning air, the captain\r\non the quarter-deck, with Mr. Webb and the professor, were engaged in\r\nangry talk with Broomberg and his fellows.\r\n\r\n\"Return to your duty, men,\" the captain said. \"I will make enquiries\r\ninto the matter. As for you, Broomberg, hand over that knife you are\r\nfingering, and consider yourself under arrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not,\" shouted the fellow. \"See!\"\r\n\r\nHe made a wild rush aft, holding the glittering blade high in air, and\r\nseized the professor by the neck.\r\n\r\nBut help from an unexpected quarter was at hand, and next moment\r\nBroomberg was sprawling on his back with Briton's great paws on his\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nMutiny and ghosts and storm were at once forgotten. The men cheered\r\nwildly, Broomberg's knife was snatched from his hand, and he himself\r\nbound hand and foot, while everybody crowded round to shake hands with\r\nthe little professor, or to pat the noble dog who had saved his life.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly joy was changed to terror, for shriek after shriek could be\r\nheard forward, and in a few seconds' time the cook rushed helter-skelter\r\nup on deck, almost pale with fright, followed by the men of the watch\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\"The ghosts!\" somebody shouted.\r\n\r\nThe captain stood as if stupefied, the little professor's eyes were as\r\nbig as watch-glasses, and the mate had to catch hold of a back-stay to\r\nprevent himself from falling.\r\n\r\nThe whole crew now took to the rigging, and the only marvel is that some\r\nof them did not slip overboard and make food for the sharks.\r\n\r\n\"Look, look!--oh, look, sir!\" shouted the mate with a cry like one in\r\na nightmare; and the next moment he fainted and fell on the top of\r\nBroomberg the mutineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo little girls, one little boy, and one little dog, all as black as\r\nchimney-sweeps, the girls with their arms in the air, now came wildly\r\nracing aft.\r\n\r\nTom himself, come back to life, was standing on the capstan waving his\r\ncap in the air, and cheering and laughing like a mad thing.\r\n\r\nAralia and Pansy reached the quarter-deck before anyone could say\r\n\"knife\", and, black as they were, sprang right into Captain Staysail's\r\narms, hugging him and kissing him.\r\n\r\n\"What!--what!--what!--\" He tried to get out a sentence, but failed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was so frightened, Unky dear, but I is so happy now!\" cried Pansy.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul and body,\" cried Staysail at last, \"how did all this\r\nhappen?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen he went forward a few paces, the little ones clinging to him all the\r\ntime, and Veevee racing round the deck like a live muff.\r\n\r\n\"Tom, you young rascal, jump down here at once. This is all your work.\r\nNow, give a full account of it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do hope, Uncle, you'll forgive me, but Frank and little Pansy and\r\nAralia did want to come with us so much, that--that--!\"\r\n\r\n\"That you took them as stowaways, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid that's it, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain pretended to be awfully angry, and said he would put about\r\nand land the lot at Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, go below, children, and get yourselves washed; the\r\nsteward will see to you. Steward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir, I'se heah, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let Miss Aralia and Pansy have that spare cabin near mine. I'll talk to\r\nyou afterwards, Tom.\"\r\n\r\nTom hung his head in sorrow--so it seemed,--but it really was to hide a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nHe got near enough to his sisters to say: \"Keep up your pecker, Pansy,\r\nfor there won't be any Aberdeen about it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spare cabin stood a big box that nobody had noticed before. Tom\r\nhad smuggled it on board, and it contained his sisters' best things, and\r\na full rig-out for them for the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nSly old Tom!\r\n\r\nHe now stole into their cabin and gave them their clothes, and when\r\nStaysail came down to dinner at twelve, with his spy-glass under his arm,\r\nno wonder he cried: \"Hillo! Hillo!\"\r\n\r\nFor here were the three children, all mirth and smiles, seated beside\r\nPete, and Tom, with head bowed down, waiting to take his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Hillo! Hillo! But what will your father and mother think, my dears?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Tom, \"we made that all right! Father gave his consent, and\r\nhe'll easily manage Mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steward!\" shouted the captain, and Jake came running. \"Put the other\r\nhalf-leaf in the table to-night, and lay covers for three more, for these\r\nyoung ragamuffins must mess with us in future.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no more word about ghosts now, and the kind professor forgave\r\nthe Finlander. He was set free and sent to duty, and now for weeks and\r\nweeks there wasn't a much happier vessel afloat than the brave ship\r\n_Valhalla_ bound for the Frozen North.\r\n\r\nThe two dogs became great friends, but, strangely enough, both disliked\r\nBroomberg, and kept out of his way whenever they could. Once, indeed,\r\nwhen the man bent down to stroke Veevee, Briton stood guard over his\r\nlittle friend and growled.\r\n\r\n\"Hands off!\" the mastiff seemed to say, \"hands off till we know more\r\nabout you!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course Uncle was chief favourite with the children, but all the three\r\nof them came to like the little professor very much indeed. He was with\r\nthem nearly all day long. Tom was usually very busy; so, too, was Uncle\r\nStaysail; and though it must not be thought that Pete was an idle man,\r\nfor he had much to study, still he always found time to romp and play\r\nwith Aralia, Pansy, and the two dogs.\r\n\r\nThough the weather grew colder for a time, it was all one long, long\r\nsummer's day. For in the Arctic regions the sun never sets for at least\r\nthree months, but just goes round and round, blazing high in the south at\r\nmid-day, and lower in the north at midnight. Indeed, in these seas, if\r\nyou were not to look at the clock, you could not really tell whether it\r\nwas night or day.\r\n\r\nEvery evening now the little party gathered round the large stove, on\r\nwhich a copper urn of coffee was always gently simmering. Then the\r\nprofessor told his strangest stories, with perhaps Pansy on his knee, and\r\nAralia lying on the hearth-rug with the dogs. Most of his yarns were\r\nabout the Frozen North, its dangers and perils, its joys and pleasures.\r\n\r\n\"And shall we see all these strange sights?\" Pansy used to ask.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, and many more than these, because I mean to give you a treat\r\nif you are good and don't get your fingers frozen.\"\r\n\r\nOne day great lumps of white snow-clad ice came floating by, and that\r\nsame evening the crow's-nest was hoisted high, high up at the very top of\r\nthe main-mast. The crow's-nest was like a big barrel with a lid at the\r\nbottom, Pansy said, and Tom, or the mate, used to climb and crawl through\r\nthe bottom, and stand, spy-glass in hand, and look all about them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Pansy one day, \"shouldn't I like to get up just once!\r\nWouldn't you, Ara?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we could never climb up,\" sighed her sister.\r\n\r\nThe clever professor heard them, and lo and behold! the very next day he\r\nhad a kind of easy-chair ready for them to go up in. He himself sat down\r\nin it with the children, and up they were hoisted, up and up. It was so\r\nfearsome that the girls shut their eyes and clung to Pete, but when they\r\ndid open them what a sight they saw!\r\n\r\nThey were not far off the main pack, and as far as the eye could see was\r\none vast field of snow-covered ice. Their eyes were dazzled in looking at\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThey were not in the crow's-nest, but close beside it, and Pete made them\r\nlook through the spy-glass. This was wonderful, for away yonder to the\r\nnorth, and near to the edge of the pack, where the sea looked as black\r\nas ink, they could see four great ships, with their crews on the ice,\r\nshooting seals and dragging skins. But in two hours' time the _Valhalla_\r\nherself got north as far as these ships, and was stopped.\r\n\r\nNeither of the girls felt cold, for they wore great mits and hoods, and\r\nwere altogether as snug as mice.\r\n\r\nThen a boat was lowered, and when they looked down they could see Tom\r\nhimself get in with shooting-clothes on and a great rifle in his hand. He\r\nwaved his cap to them, and Pansy cried: \"Hoo-lay!\" The boat pulled away\r\nand soon touched the ice; Tom sprang nimbly on shore, and before long he\r\ncould be seen only as a little black dot on that dazzling plain of snow.\r\nThen he was observed to stop and kneel down while some huge monster,\r\nyellowish-white in colour, came rushing towards him.\r\n\r\nAralia must have the glass now.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the bear! the bear!\" she cried in grief. \"It is going to kill Tom.\r\nOh! oh! oh! my brother Tom!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see! let me see!\" screamed Pansy.\r\n\r\n\"Look now!\" said Aralia with a smile. \"Isn't Tom brave?\"\r\n\r\nTom was indeed. For Pansy could now see the monster lying dead, and Tom\r\nleaning on his gun, and once more waving his cap. Then men came up and\r\nskinned the bear, and dragged the head and hide and paws to the ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTom was a splendid shot, and this was his first bear. When he came\r\naboard, his sisters met him with pleasure, although with tears in their\r\neyes, for he had run a great risk.\r\n\r\nA day or two after this, when still farther north, the children had had\r\ntheir first run upon the ice. It was all so strange, and the ice was so\r\nwhite, that they felt very giddy for a time. But the professor held\r\nPansy, and Tom walked by Aralia.\r\n\r\nThe whole ice-pack seemed one vast plain, like a bleak moorland in\r\nwinter, only with little hillocks of ice here and there called hummocks,\r\nfor the flat pieces of ice were all frozen hard together, and Ara\r\nwondered where \"Greenland's icy mountains\" had all got to.\r\n\r\nThere were no bears about to-day, and no seals, only the sea-birds that\r\nwent wheeling and screaming about them in thousands. When they got back\r\nto the ship it was dinner-time, and both were snow-blind. The black\r\nsteward carried them down and seated them at table, but it was quite half\r\nan hour before they could see.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ship was now kept well away from the ice-pack, they could\r\noften see vessels far in through frozen ice, but busy, busy at their\r\nterrible work. Sometimes Tom and the mate would have a boat lowered, and\r\nwould set off bear-hunting. One day Tom brought home a young seal. It was\r\nsuch a beauty, with soft eyes and long, warm, fluffy hair. It was so\r\nsmall that even Pansy could carry it a little way in her arms.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do let us have it for a pet!\" cried Aralia, and her uncle consented.\r\nSo they called the seal \"Flossy\", and warmed frozen milk for it--great\r\nstores of which had been taken on board,--and fed it with a spoon, and\r\nsoon the wee thing knew Pansy, and used to crawl and waddle after her.\r\n\r\nThe dogs didn't know what to make of Flossy at first, and Briton used to\r\nroll it all round the deck with his big nose; but Flossy rather liked\r\nthis. But one day, when Briton tried to lift it up by the tail, it struck\r\nhim a slap with its flipper that could be heard from stem to stern.\r\n\r\n\"Take that,\" Flossy seemed to say, \"and leave my tail alone!\"\r\n\r\nThe vessel was now kept farther to the east, and every day they passed\r\nbetween great patches of ice, big pieces of which kept striking the ship\r\nwith such a noise that when anyone wanted to be heard he had to shout\r\naloud.\r\n\r\nThe professor was very busy now, taking soundings almost every day, and\r\ndoing all kinds of clever work that even Tom, smart as he was, couldn't\r\nunderstand. But in the evenings he still played with the children, or\r\namused them by showing them, through magnifying-glasses, some of the\r\nwonderful things he had brought up from the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was all very strange and beautiful, and the children were enchanted.\r\nBut their greatest treat was when he brought some little glass tanks\r\ncontaining forms of animal life they had never seen before, and were\r\nnever tired of watching. Only Professor Pete didn't--because he said he\r\ncouldn't--bring them out every night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn and on sailed the beautiful _Valhalla_. East and west, but always\r\nnorth, went she.\r\n\r\nPeterkin was on a voyage of discovery, and one of his chief objects\r\nseemed to be to keep clear of the ice, which had grown very heavy indeed.\r\n\r\nIt was a delightful holiday for the children as yet, but for the\r\nprofessor a time of harder work than many know anything about at all. It\r\nwas really wonderful how this busy little man found time to play with the\r\nchildren, with Flossy and with the dogs, or even to play his fiddle. But\r\nthis, he would have told you, was his way of taking exercise; and he told\r\nPansy that if it were not for her he didn't think he should ever be able\r\nto find the island of gold he was in search of.\r\n\r\nDo not think, though, it was all and always plain sailing. There were\r\ndangers of many kinds. Sometimes storms would suddenly rise and blow for\r\na day or two at a stretch. At such times the sun was hidden, and the\r\ncold became intense. The waves that broke on board were turned into ice,\r\ncovering the decks and bows, and giving to the ship a wondrous\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nOne evening, after a gale like this had blown over, the stowaways, who\r\nhad not dared to show face all day, were told to come up on deck.\r\n\r\nWhat a sight! Why, the _Valhalla_ was like a ghost-ship. The decks were\r\nwhite, and the bulwarks too. Every rope and stay seemed made of frosted\r\nsilver, while great icicles hung everywhere around.\r\n\r\nIt was very dark this evening, so that the children at first could hardly\r\nsee anything. But Pete soon had them all hoisted up on to the bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd now he turned on the electric and coloured lights--crimson, blue, and\r\norange. Then, what a sight was there! It was one that caused Pansy and\r\nAralia quite to forget the beauty of a pantomime they had seen the winter\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThey stood spell-bound, and would not have been a bit surprised if all\r\nthe deck had suddenly been crowded with fairies, with silver wands,\r\ngarlands of flowers, and wings of pearly gauze. But the only fairies were\r\nthe sailors, and every one of these looked like a very old man, because\r\nheads and beards were white with frost and snow, and little icicles hung\r\nround their hats.\r\n\r\nThe children dreamt of it all again that night; but lo! when they went on\r\ndeck next morning, before breakfast, to have a romp and a run with the\r\ndogs and Flossy, everything was changed.\r\n\r\nAnd what a change!\r\n\r\nThe sun was now shining brightly, with not a cloud in the blue sky.\r\nIcebergs lay far astern; all around was a calm blue sea, with one great\r\nwhale half-asleep on its surface, wild birds more beautiful than any they\r\nhad ever seen before sailing around, and, more wonderful than anything\r\nelse, the _Valhalla_ was safe at anchor in front of a pretty island,\r\npatched with the greens, reds, and browns of lovely flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Behold!\" cried Peterkin, as he lifted Pansy up. \"Behold, my child, the\r\nland of gold and coals!\"\r\n\r\nPansy's reply was to the point.\r\n\r\n\"Very pretty, very pretty,\" she said; \"but, 'Fessor Pete, I wants to see\r\nthe gold--not the nasty coals.\"\r\n\r\nThis very forenoon Peterkin started off in the biggest boat to \"spy out\r\nthe land\", as he called it Tom and the three little stowaways were\r\nallowed to come too. To them it was going to be a kind of picnic, and the\r\nsteward sent with them a huge basket, filled with enough good things to\r\nlast the whole crew for a week. As there was no wind, the men had to row\r\nall the way.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Pansy, \"I hope dear Flossy won't swim away!\"\r\n\r\nYes, they had taken Flossy with them as well as the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe water was deep and dark quite close to the beautiful shore, and the\r\ngirls could not help marvelling at the monsters of jelly-fish they saw\r\nfar down in its depths. Their bodies were as great as sunshades, and of\r\nthe same shape, and the legs they jerked out from under were spangled\r\nwith stars of blue and red. Once a huge shark swam up to the boat, leered\r\nat them with his sly and evil eyes, then, turning on his back, showed a\r\nmouth that could have swallowed them all. Poor Pansy drew nearer to the\r\nprofessor with a cry of horror.\r\n\r\nThey found a little bay at last, and landed for a meal.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there is anything that can hurt you here,\" said Peterkin,\r\n\"and, if you like, you can run about and gather flowers while I cruise\r\nround the coast for an hour. There, I will leave you all the rugs, the\r\nbear-skin, and the basket too.\"\r\n\r\nThey were delighted.\r\n\r\nSo off they set, Veevee and Briton bounding and barking in front, and\r\nFlossy waddling behind. Tom had his rifle and plenty of cartridges, but\r\nthere was really nothing to shoot but the lovely gulls, and the boy was\r\nnot so cruel as to touch one of these.\r\n\r\nSo they wandered on and on and upwards, until they came to a level spot\r\nall one lovely carpet of small wild flowers. Poppies of many colours grew\r\nhere, mosses, yellow stone-crop, and grasses of every hue, but they\r\nagreed not to pick any until they should be returning. Still higher they\r\nwent up the mountain-side, when suddenly little Pansy exclaimed: \"Look,\r\nTom! look, Ara! the sea is all flied away!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTom stared behind him and stood aghast.\r\n\r\nA huge wall of fog or white mist had quite covered the ocean and even the\r\nshore, shutting them out from view, and was now slowly advancing towards\r\nthem. But that was not the worst, for a low, moaning wind came on before\r\nit, and flakes of snow began to fall.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for Tom to say: \"Let us get back at once to the beach, the\r\nboat must be there already.\" They had come miles from the bay. Before\r\nthey could walk half the distance back, the snow-fog had swallowed them,\r\nand it was no wonder that they lost their way, and became cold and faint\r\nand dizzy.\r\n\r\nBoth Aralia and Pansy began to cry now, and at last sank down among the\r\ndry snow, unable to move another yard.\r\n\r\nTom was a boy of great courage. He thought for a little, and then he\r\nsaid: \"Frank, if you can carry Pansy I'm sure I can manage Ara; and we\r\nwill try to find shelter somewhere till the storm is blown over.\"\r\n\r\nSo on again in this way they struggled, till, more dead than alive, they\r\nfound, by good luck, the welcome shelter of a cave. The cave was by no\r\nmeans large, but they were surprised to find it so warm. The first thing,\r\nhowever, that Tom did was to walk all round the inside, rifle in hand.\r\nTom had not been two years at sea for nothing. Meanwhile, where was\r\nFlossy, and where was Briton?\r\n\r\nTom whistled again and again, till he said he had nearly whistled the\r\nwhites of his eyes out, but never a dog replied.\r\n\r\nSomething else had begun to whistle also, and that was the wind, and\r\nalthough Tom made several attempts to leave the cave, to have a look at\r\nthe weather as he called it, he found it impossible to stand. Hours and\r\nhours passed away like this, and the tempest seemed only to increase in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThey were all very hungry now, and so Tom shared out some biscuits he had\r\nbrought with him, and after they had swallowed a little snow they all sat\r\ndown to talk.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said Tom, \"we'll have to stay here all night. It will be good\r\nfun, won't it, girls?\"\r\n\r\nHe knew it was anything but fun himself, but he spoke in that way to keep\r\nup the children's courage.\r\n\r\nWhen Aralia said, \"Yes,\" so did Pansy, but both looked very quiet.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, to their great joy, in bounded Briton himself, and close\r\nbehind him waddled Floss. It was clear to all that he had been helping\r\nFlossy along, for Flossy was still little more than a puppy; but, poor\r\nwee beauty, how glad she was to see them all again!\r\n\r\nShe crawled up to Pansy, and lay down on her back to be scratched, which\r\nwas always Flossy's way of showing she was pleased.\r\n\r\nWell, after they had all talked till they were tired, Tom said: \"Now,\r\ngirls, just you lie down to sleep. Frank, here is my ticker.\" He gave his\r\ncousin his watch as he spoke. \"You have to do sentry for three hours.\r\nThen wake me up and I'll let you lie down. See, I'll put my rifle and\r\nbelt, with fifty cartridges in it, beside you. Mind, that is only for\r\nshow, because you're too little a boy to touch guns. Anybody want a\r\nlittle more snow? No? Very well.\"\r\n\r\nSo the girls curled up with Veevee and Floss, and Tom lay near. But\r\nBriton seemed to say: \"No, I won't sleep; I'll lie and watch with Frank.\"\r\n\r\nFrank was not sorry to have the dog beside him for it was terrible to\r\nfeel all alone in such a dismal place.\r\n\r\nWell, the night wore slowly on--one, two, three, four hours--and Frank\r\nwas just looking at the rifle, and pretending to aim at something in the\r\nfalling snow, when, all at once, Briton uttered a low warning growl and\r\nsprang to his feet.\r\n\r\nNext moment a great shambling bear was right in the mouth of the cave. He\r\ngave a roar that seemed to shake the whole island.\r\n\r\nWhether the boy took aim or not, I never could tell, but he certainly\r\nfired the rifle, and down dropped Bruin dead, and lay in the snow with\r\nhis great tongue hanging out, a marvellous sight to see.\r\n\r\nThe noise in the cave was fearful, but as soon as the girls had stopped\r\nscreaming, Frank told what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is, girls,\" he said more than once, \"there wasn't the\r\nleast bit of bravery about it. I just held out the gun, and off it went.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but you were brave!\" said Aralia; \"and if you hadn't killed the\r\nawful monster, we should all be dead now.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried Tom, \"it was only Flossy that the bear wanted! He just\r\nwanted a bit of seal for supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wowff!\" barked Briton.\r\n\r\n\"Wiff!\" barked Veevee, as much as to say: \"No bear shall touch Flossy\r\nwhile we are alive.\"\r\n\r\nBut nobody thought of sleeping any more, and as they were all very\r\nhungry, Tom served out more snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tempest howled for many hours more. Then at last it grew almost calm,\r\nand the sun shone out on the pure white snow.\r\n\r\n\"I know what to do now,\" said Tom. \"Let us find our way to the beach. The\r\nboat may be there, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBut long before they reached the shore they beheld a wondrous sight, for\r\nas far as the eye could reach there was no water to be seen, only huge\r\nicebergs covered with dazzling snow, all gently moving up and down with\r\nthe swelling waves beneath. The noise made by these great bergs as they\r\nground their sides together was deafening.\r\n\r\nBut there were no signs of the boat, and no ship was to be seen. The\r\n_Valhalla_ had either been crushed to atoms or been driven out to sea.\r\nTom clung to the last hope, and even told his sisters that she was sure\r\nto return for them soon. He would not get downhearted.\r\n\r\n\"This is a queer business, Frank,\" he said with a light laugh, which had\r\nno sound of fun in it however; \"but we must do the best we can till they\r\ncome back. Eh, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course.\"\r\n\r\nBut Pansy was clinging to Aralia, quietly crying.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frank, we must live in the cave for a little, and so we had better\r\nget everything in, and be as jolly as we can.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen they had got everything up to the cave, which took a long time,\r\neverybody had a good breakfast. There was really enough food to last a\r\nweek, and it was lucky there were several boxes of sardines, for Floss\r\nwould take nothing else.\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be a big, big picnic,\" said Frank, and the girls began to\r\nlaugh. \"We're going to have lots of fun.\"\r\n\r\nFrank and Tom could climb like monkeys, and in about an hour's time they\r\nhad put all the food high up in a hole in the rock out of the reach of\r\nbears or foxes.\r\n\r\nBy twelve o'clock, when the sun was as high as it could get, the snow had\r\ndisappeared, and once more there was a soft, warm breeze blowing, and\r\nbeauty everywhere.\r\n\r\nTwo days flew by and nothing happened, only at night they could hear\r\nfoxes barking in the distance. They never attack people singly, as bears\r\ndo, but they are dangerous in packs, as Tom one day found out to his\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe food was getting low, and Tom thought it was time to do something.\r\nThey had found strange fruits like strawberries growing, and also some\r\nsort of roots that tasted like nuts; but unless they could get some fish\r\npoor Flossy would die.\r\n\r\nSo Tom started off all alone on a voyage of discovery. Frank stayed in\r\nthe cave with the girls, and they promised to be very good.\r\n\r\nThe morning was very calm, and so still that Tom could hear Pansy calling\r\nto him \"not to be long\" when he was quite a mile up the mountain-side.\r\nWhy he took this course he could never tell, but, when he crossed the\r\ntop, marvellous indeed was the view that lay before his eyes.\r\n\r\nUncle Staysail used to tell him that the natives of the north say there\r\nis an open sea somewhere near the Pole, with many islands in it, and\r\ntrees, and flowers, and birds.\r\n\r\nAnd now, behold! such a sea lay right down in the round valley yonder at\r\nhis feet. It was not really a sea, but a lovely round lake, and right in\r\nthe middle was a large green island.\r\n\r\nTom rubbed his eyes and gazed and gazed, and then rubbed his eyes and\r\ngazed again.\r\n\r\n\"Was it all a dream?\" he wondered.\r\n\r\nNo, there was no dream about it. It took Tom some hours to explore this\r\nlake. He walked round it and found that at the far side a ridge of rocks,\r\nvery narrow, led right out to the island. He crossed this natural bridge\r\nand found himself in a perfect paradise. Flowers and fruit everywhere,\r\nand beautiful wild birds the like of which he had never seen before.\r\nThere were rabbits, too, and very tame they were, for they followed him\r\nabout, and seemed to wonder what he was and where on earth he came from.\r\n\r\nTom knocked one on the head, though he was not cruel, and with this slung\r\nover his shoulder, and his pockets full of nuts, he started to walk back.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose that walking round in a circle had confused him. Anyhow he\r\nwalked miles out of his way, and lost himself. He sat down on a big stone\r\nat last, and wondered what he should do. He was tired and hungry, so he\r\nate a handful of nuts. And then he began to nod.\r\n\r\n\"I'll just have five minutes of a nap,\" he said, \"and then get on again.\"\r\n\r\nSo down he lay. But his five minutes lasted for an hour, and still the\r\nlad lay fast asleep.\r\n\r\nA large gray fox stole up and smelt the rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"That'll just suit me,\" said he to himself. \"I'll go and call my brothers\r\nand sisters, and we'll kill this two-legged creature and steal his\r\nrabbit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yap-yap-yap!\" barked the fox, and soon he had a whole pack round him.\r\nBut just as they were getting near to Tom, he awoke and sat up. Bang went\r\nhis rifle at once, as he saw his danger. One fox fell dead, but the\r\nothers came on with a rush, and there was soon a lively fight. Tom laid\r\nabout him with the butt end of his rifle, and, being a strong young\r\nfellow, dead and dying foxes were soon lying all round him.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the pack drew back a little way, only to come on again,\r\nyelping and yelling more than ever. Poor Tom's wrists were dripping with\r\nblood, for he had been bitten in many places. He thought it was all over\r\nnow, yet he meant to fight to the last.\r\n\r\nBut help was at hand, for the next moment Briton bounded into the centre\r\nof the spiteful pack, and the savage beasts fled in every direction.\r\n\r\nWhat a happy meeting that was! The mastiff led Tom back over the hills,\r\nand in an hour's time he was safe and sound at the cave.\r\n\r\nPansy wept with delight, and Aralia bound up Tom's wrists. He made very\r\nlight of the bites, however.\r\n\r\nThere were many pieces of old black wood in the cave, so Frank collected\r\nthem and lit a fire; and when it was quite clear, the rabbit was roasted,\r\nand everybody made a splendid dinner.\r\n\r\nThen Tom told them all he had seen; and, after a night's rest, they all\r\nstarted off the next morning for the lake and the island, taking the\r\nskins and rugs with them. They reached the long ridge of rocks and\r\ncrossed over. Then, indeed, were the girls surprised and delighted. What\r\na lot they would have to tell Father and Mother when they got home again!\r\n\r\nTom sighed. He feared in his own mind that they would never, never see\r\ntheir home any more.\r\n\r\nWhen Flossie saw the lake she made a spring towards it and dived below\r\nthe surface. They could see her darting about beneath, and soon up she\r\ncame, looking as pleased as Punch, with a fine, great fish in her mouth.\r\nShe laid it gently at Pansy's feet, and dived in again.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be happy here,\" she seemed to say, as she brought another fish,\r\n\"and we need never be hungry any more.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Tom had well explored the island, he told Frank they must build a\r\nfort. He had found the very spot for it, too, on a little hill. This was\r\nabout a hundred feet high, and the top was hollow, like a cup, with only\r\none opening into it. In fact, the top of the hill was part of the crater\r\nof an extinct volcano, and was shaped like the letter G, the doorway\r\nbeing only a gap in the rocks, through which no bear could squeeze.\r\n\r\nInside, the walls were twenty feet high all round, all bare rock; but the\r\nfloor was covered with grass, and moss, and wild flowers.\r\n\r\nAralia and Pansy were wild with delight, and Pansy said she would now be\r\nable to sleep without ugly dreams.\r\n\r\nVeevee would be her bed-fellow, and Floss would curl up with Sissie, and\r\nbig Briton could sleep at the entrance.\r\n\r\nSo it was all arranged.\r\n\r\nBut as there could be no telling how long they might have to remain here,\r\nand as rain would be sure to fall, even if snow did not, Tom and Frank\r\nbegan to build a hut inside Fort Fairyland, as they called their strange\r\nabode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow each boy had--like all Greenland sailors--not only a large,\r\nmany-bladed knife, with a saw in it, but a huge broad dagger in a\r\nleathern belt round his waist. So they did not want for tools.\r\n\r\nThey found the best wood for what they wanted growing close by the lake,\r\nin the shape of straight and strong willows. There were plenty of leaves,\r\nand grasses, and heath also.\r\n\r\nIt would be rather a long job, but they set to work with a will, and in\r\nthree days' time they had dragged everything they wanted up to Fort\r\nFairyland. The building of the hut was fine fun. At first it was only\r\nmeant to be a kind of shelter on poles, but, as they had so much time\r\nupon their hands, they agreed to build real walls, and leave space for a\r\ndoor and a window. In little more than a week they had the framework all\r\nup, and the roof all made. It was thatched first with broad leaves, and\r\nthen with grass. And, mind you a short ladder had to be made first to\r\npermit them to do the thatching. When this was finished, all the sides\r\nwere filled in with willow branches, except door and window. Never a hole\r\nwas left in it, for Aralia and Pansy collected heaps and heaps of dried\r\nmoss, and the boys worked this in to fill up the gaps.\r\n\r\nAnd when all was finished, and wicker seats made, it did look a cosy\r\nlittle hut indeed.\r\n\r\nBut all the cooking was done out-of-doors. There were no sauce-pans to\r\nclean, nor knives nor forks. The plates were broad leaves, and for knives\r\nand forks the castaways used pointed sticks.\r\n\r\nIt really wasn't bad fun at all being Crusoes in such a place as this.\r\n\r\nBut--dear me! there is always a \"but\" about everything--how was it all to\r\nend?\r\n\r\nAnd where was the _Valhalla_?\r\n\r\nExcept for these two questions, which would keep on running through Tom's\r\nand Frank's minds, they could have been quite contented--well, for a time\r\nat all events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their rambles through this little Arctic fairy land, Tom noticed that\r\nthe squirrels were now busy every day running away to their holes with\r\nnuts and leaves. Of course they might have young ones to feed, he\r\nthought; but surely it was something more than this which made them act\r\nthus.\r\n\r\nCreeping all alone one morning through the bushes, as quietly as a mouse,\r\nTom came upon a sight which taught him a useful lesson. For high up in\r\nthe trunk of an old tree was a big round hole with a squirrel's tail\r\nhanging out. Presently up ran another squirrel, carrying a great mouthful\r\nof leaves and clay.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer made a slight noise, when out came No. 1 and took the\r\nbundle from No. 2, which then darted off for more.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" said Tom to himself, \"they seem to be storing up food for\r\nwinter. Heigho! I thought it would always be summer in this fairyland.\r\nBut thank you, Master Squirrel, I shall go and do the same.\" So off went\r\nTom to tell Frank and the girls what he had seen the squirrels doing.\r\n\r\n\"As there is no sign of the ship coming back for us, children,\" he said\r\nsomewhat seriously, \"and we may have to spend the winter here, I think,\r\nyou know, we ought to be making ready for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Pansy, looking very wise. \"We want food, and we want wood\r\nand all, doesn't we, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be very, very cold in this island,\" said her brother, \"because\r\nwe have the warm-water lake all round us. But perhaps the squirrels know\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nSo now began a very busy season indeed, for everybody went nut-gathering.\r\n\r\nTom opened up a squirrel's store, and a pretty noise the little creature\r\nmade about it. But he did not rob it; he only wanted to learn a lesson.\r\n\r\nHe noticed that the nuts it had collected were a little green on one\r\nside, so these must be the best. Then he looked at the leaves and clay\r\nthat were packed over them, and thought he would get some just the same.\r\n\r\nThis going a-nutting in fairyland was real fine fun, and to have heard\r\ntheir merry voices, talking and laughing and singing, with every now and\r\nthen Briton's great bass \"Wowff!\" and Veevee's shrill \"Wiff!\" no one\r\nwould have taken them for castaways and Crusoes.\r\n\r\nNutting made everyone so hungry too!\r\n\r\nRabbits were very plentiful on the island. The boys caught them by means\r\nof snares made of a kind of tough creeper. And bonny Flossy caught as\r\nmany fish as would have kept a large family alive.\r\n\r\nTom seldom used his rifle, though he always carried it. The cartridges\r\nwere too precious to waste.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which these Crusoes had to be very careful to do was never\r\nto let the fire go out. It was easily kept in by placing a kind of mossy\r\npeat among the hot ashes and covering it quite over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo they collected an immense quantity of nuts, and these were placed in\r\nholes found in the rocks, and covered right up with the same sort of\r\ncement as the squirrels used. The roots that served them instead of bread\r\nevery day, and which were cooked by placing them for a short time in the\r\nhot ashes, they also collected and stored. So when the harvest was all\r\nover, Tom told Frank and his sisters that they needn't be afraid to spend\r\ntheir Christmas in this beautiful island.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but, Tom,\" said Pansy, \"we'll all be home long, long before\r\nChristmas, won't we?\"\r\n\r\nPoor child! She was beginning to long for her mother's cosy cottage on\r\nthe cliff, and for the fires that in the long winter evenings always\r\nburned so brightly in the parlour grate.\r\n\r\n\"Now, about light for the long Arctic winter night, which will soon be\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the question that Tom put to Frank just after sunset one\r\nbeautiful evening as the snow on the tops of the highest mountains was\r\nchanged to a rose tint in the sun's parting rays.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very serious question, you know,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Very serious,\" said Pansy, who heard him, shaking her wise, wee head.\r\n\r\nSitting by the camp fire there, with its lights and shadows chasing each\r\nother over her face and through her sunny hair, Pansy looked a very\r\nbeautiful child indeed.\r\n\r\nFor some time they had all been sitting round the fire, watching the\r\ncurling smoke and the dancing flames, everyone intent on his or her own\r\nthoughts. Aralia had been wondering what they were all doing at home, and\r\nif her father and mother were anxious about her and Pansy. It was such a\r\nlong, long time--hundreds of years it seemed--since they had sailed away;\r\nso many strange things had happened since that day. Pansy was a little\r\nmaiden who took the world very easily, and enjoyed each day and hour as\r\nit passed. Her thoughts were hardly worth a penny. Frank was not unlike\r\nPansy, and took things as they came, and if they were not nice, just let\r\nthem slide. The mastiff was asleep, so was Veevee, and both seemed to be\r\ndreaming, and talking in their dreams. But Flossy's eyes were very wide\r\nopen now. She was really wondering if she could catch another fish\r\nto-night. Flossy had lately taken to waddling away towards evening for a\r\nswim in the warm lake, and never came back without something in her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nSo nobody was surprised when they missed her from the fire, only, as she\r\nstayed rather longer to-night than usual, and as the long twilight would\r\nsoon end, Tom took up his rifle and went off all by himself to look for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" cried Pansy, as the sound of a shot startled everyone in the\r\nfort. \"Tom's gone and killed something!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's run and see,\" said Frank. Veevee and Briton had already rushed\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThey found Tom at the lake-side, standing over a huge dead bear, with\r\nFlossy near him.\r\n\r\n\"That bear,\" said Tom, laughing, \"was keeping poor Floss in the lake; but\r\nhe won't do so again. Isn't he a fine one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" cried Frank; \"he is indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, children,\" said Tom, when he was once more seated in front of\r\nthe camp fire, \"the question of lights is settled for good. Frank and I\r\nare going to make candles out of that bear's tallow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Pansy, we are. Oh, we shouldn't be half Crusoes if we couldn't make\r\ncandles!\"\r\n\r\nSo the boys arranged to start work the very next morning at sunrise.\r\n\r\n\"But first let us have a look through this beautiful isle of the sea,\r\nwhile the girls are asleep. There may be more bears. Briton, you must\r\nstay and watch. Veevee, you may come.\"\r\n\r\nThough Veevee searched every bush and grove, no bear was found. The one\r\nTom had so cleverly killed must have crossed to the island alone by the\r\nbridge of rocks.\r\n\r\nSo, after breakfast, the boys built their fire. With big blocks of lava\r\nthey made a sort of stove, and on top of this was placed a large cup-like\r\nstone, which they had chanced to find. Into this they put the tallow to\r\nmelt. In the meantime Tom pulled a quantity of thick rushes, and set\r\nFrank and the girls to peel them, while the dogs looked on as if\r\nwondering what it was all about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"It's something to eat, I suppose,\" said Briton, looking very wise.\r\n\r\n\"A sort of soup of some kind from the smell of it, I should think,\" was\r\nVeevee's remark.\r\n\r\nThe long threads of white pith were about as thick as a penholder, and\r\nthese were to form the wicks. When dried they were tied two and two by\r\none end.\r\n\r\nThen between two uprights Tom placed a long willow rod, with three dozen\r\nstrong thorns stuck in it about two inches apart, to serve as hooks.\r\n\r\nBy this time the tallow was melted and all was ready.\r\n\r\n\"Now, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Tom, \"you shall see how candles were\r\nbuilt in the Royal Navy when Uncle was a boy.\" He rolled up his sleeves,\r\nand, picking up a double wick, dipped it in the pan, and then hung it on\r\nthe first peg for the tallow to set. He did the same with all the rest,\r\nand by the time he had the thirty-sixth wick hung up, No. 1 was ready to\r\nbe taken down and dipped again. So on he went all along the row, till he\r\nhad dipped them a dozen times at least, when, lo! and behold! they were\r\nthick and beautiful candles, each one strong enough to give the light of\r\nhalf a dozen ordinary ship's candles.\r\n\r\nHe worked for two days, and made about a hundred in all, so there was no\r\nfear of their having to sit in the dark.\r\n\r\nNext night, while the moon was shining low over the snow-clad hills, the\r\nwhole camp was alarmed by the fierce barking of Briton. The mastiff was\r\n\"wowffing\", Veevee was \"wiffing\", and Flossy was moaning and wagging her\r\ntail in the air. Though it was long past midnight, Briton wanted to be\r\noff out and kill something or somebody he had heard, and Veevee would\r\nalso go on the war-path for fear Briton might get hurt.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after came the most tremendous yelling the Crusoes had\r\never heard, and it was clear that a whole pack of foxes had invaded the\r\nisland, and if Briton and Veevee had been allowed to go out, they would\r\nboth have been torn to pieces. The awful din lasted for hours, with a\r\nsound now and then of fighting.\r\n\r\nThen it stopped, and all was still.\r\n\r\nEverybody went quietly off to sleep again, but next day, when they went\r\nto the lake-side, behold not a trace of the bear was to be seen. The\r\nbeasts had eaten all the flesh, and carried away the bones and skin.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what if these wild dogs return some night,\" said Tom to Frank, \"and\r\nattack the camp. Although no bear could squeeze in here, these half-bred\r\nwolves might, and tear us all in pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Don't frighten a fellow, Tom,\" said Frank. \"But I say, old man, we must\r\npuzzle our heads once again and make a gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's good!\" cried Tom, laughing; \"why, there is only one head\r\nbetween the two of us, and that belongs to me, Master Frank; and don't\r\nyou forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, you may have it, only for goodness' sake make good use of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nThe cup-like top of the hill in which our Crusoes were living had but one\r\nentrance, as I have before told you, and the path leading to it was very\r\nsteep, and made up of large stones and lumps of lava.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a good thing,\" Tom said, \"to get a lot of these inside. They\r\nwould come in very handy to throw at an enemy, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"That they would,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\nWell, it took them three whole days to make and fix up a gate, which they\r\ncould raise or lower before the entrance by means of ropes made out of\r\nlong trailing weeds, or creepers.\r\n\r\nThen, after they had carried about a hundred big stones inside, they\r\nbegan to feel happier and safer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, a month or two after this, the Crusoes awoke to find that\r\nthe sun rose that day for the last time, and, until spring should return,\r\nthey would see his golden beams no more.\r\n\r\nBut there was a bright and beautiful twilight every mid-day for two weeks\r\nlonger. Then they knew that the long, dreary Arctic night had come in\r\nearnest. For about a month the Crusoes had been eating very heartily\r\nevery day and were getting quite fat. It was the same with the animals.\r\n\r\nFlossy had long ago lost her puppy coat, and was now a bonny\r\nwhitish-yellow seal, not very large, and with a black saddle on her back.\r\nBut Flossy got drowsy too, and if the boys had not stirred her up every\r\nday, and sent her off to catch fish, I believe she would have slept\r\nnearly all the time.\r\n\r\nEven the boys felt sleepy, though they could not tell why. Said Tom one\r\nday to Frank as they sat playing draughts on a rough board, with nuts for\r\nmen: \"Frank, old man, by this time all the bears will have gone into\r\nwinter quarters. They won't come out much until the sun returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy,\" cried Aralia, clapping her hands, \"Fancy all of us sleeping all\r\nnight long--three months, didn't you say, Tom? Wouldn't it be nice? And\r\nif Uncle Staysail should come in to wake us in the morning! 'Get up,' he\r\nwould say, 'are you going to sleep all day?'\"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed at the idea, but it was not carried out. Besides the\r\ncandles, which they only burned at supper and after, they had torches\r\nmade of wood which they could burn at any time. Moreover, there was the\r\nlight of the camp fire, which they kept always burning, for they had laid\r\nin a vast store of peat and wood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTom was time-keeper. He had a little log-book in which he had been\r\ncareful to note down day and date every morning, and, like a good lad, he\r\nnever forgot to wind his watch. He made a really first-class Crusoe.\r\n\r\nBut they were all good. And what a grand guard Briton was! If ever he\r\nheard the slightest sound of bird or rabbit down amongst the trees or\r\nbushes beneath them, he gave a low growl. One night he sprang to his feet\r\nand barked very loudly and angrily.\r\n\r\nThe Crusoes were awake at once.\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder, for terrible noises, like distant thunder, were heard just\r\nbeneath their feet. They were startled still more when explosion after\r\nexplosion took place, both in the air and in the earth, while the ground\r\nwas shaken under them.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious, giddy movement, and made them all feel rather sick.\r\n\r\nThen the thunder-storm burst in earnest, with rain and hail in torrents,\r\nand the whole island seemed to be on fire with the lightning.\r\n\r\nTom had to take Pansy in his arms to soothe her, for she shook and\r\ntrembled like a little bird. But in two hours it was all over, and the\r\nstars were shining as bright and large and near as before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometimes the moon shone with a stronger light than it ever does in this\r\ncountry. It seemed so close to them, too, that Pansy used to say it was\r\nonly just resting on the snowy hill-top.\r\n\r\nOn moonlit days the children were always abroad in the forest or by the\r\nlake-side watching Flossy catching fish. She dived and swam far more\r\nquickly than an eel.\r\n\r\nIt is terribly dreary to want the sun, but after a month one gets used to\r\nit. Besides, one knows that bright and beautiful days are on ahead. Older\r\npeople might have felt very weary, but none of our Crusoes lost heart.\r\n\r\nI have not told you yet of the Aurora Borealis, which was best seen on\r\ndark, starry nights. It was not in the north only, but all around them,\r\ngreat bright fringes of coloured lights--chiefly green, crimson, or pink.\r\nHow they danced and flickered, to be sure! Such dazzling beauty no pen\r\ncould describe, and I will not attempt it.\r\n\r\nWell, Christmas-day came at last, and how glad they all were to be still\r\nspared alive and in comfort!\r\n\r\nTom meant to make the most of it. But, of course, there was no turkey or\r\ngoose to roast. Instead, they had a splendid great rabbit stuffed with\r\nnuts, and roasted roots to eat with it.\r\n\r\nThey had no crackers either, but Tom and Frank got an immense pile of dry\r\nwood, and heaped it in the middle of the rocky bridge that led to the\r\nmainland, and early in the day or night--whichever you like to call\r\nit--they set it alight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow, probably this pile saved some of their lives. It had been placed\r\nthere about five days before Christmas, and a huge bear, who had the\r\nnightmare I suppose, came yawning out of his cave and down the\r\nmountain-side.\r\n\r\nHe had shambled along to about the centre of the bridge, then lain down\r\namong the wood and gone off to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe slept so soundly that he did not hear the boys crossing over to set\r\nthe bonfire ablaze.\r\n\r\nBut when the smoke and crackling flames got towards him he started up and\r\nbegan to trot off, coughing and roaring till all the hills sent back the\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nSo awful was the echo that the boys were for a time almost\r\nterror-stricken. They thought that about a score of bears had left their\r\nsnow-caves and were swarming down the hill.\r\n\r\nTom fired his rifle, but missed. Veevee wanted to follow up.\r\n\r\n\"Only just let me get at him,\" cried the little rascal, \"and I'll tear\r\nhim limb from limb!\"\r\n\r\nAnyhow that was a fine fire, and it lit up the lake and the woods all\r\nabout, while the numerous sparks that rose and fell in the air were like\r\ngolden rain.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire began to fade and to die they all returned to their\r\nChristmas dinner in the hut.\r\n\r\nNo fewer than four candles were lighted to-night, one in each corner of\r\nthe room. Oh, Tom meant to do everything in first-class form, I can tell\r\nyou!\r\n\r\nAnd I feel pretty certain that even at home in Merrie England no one that\r\nevening ate more heartily or made a better dinner than our Crusoes, all\r\nalone though they were in the far-off Frozen North.\r\n\r\nAfter supper they all came round the fire, and the dogs went off to\r\nsleep, perchance to dream; but the children kept very wide awake indeed.\r\nAnd Tom told lots of droll, funny stories, and everybody sang songs.\r\nAfter this, all the talk was about home and the delightful time they were\r\nsure to have in one year's time, when Christmas came round again once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThen came sleep, and when Tom looked at his watch--next morning let me\r\ncall it--it was very nearly twelve o'clock!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough it now wanted but a fortnight, according to Tom's reckoning, of\r\nthe first sunrise, it was still as dark as ever, and but for the moon and\r\nstars and glorious Aurora, life about this time would have been very tame\r\nand dreary indeed.\r\n\r\nYet, owing to the clearness of the air and the purity of everything\r\naround them, the children never once lost heart. In fact they were as\r\nmerry as sky-larks, and often made the island resound with song and mirth\r\nand laughter.\r\n\r\nAnd the dogs, as well as Flossy, were merrier still. They barked and\r\nlaughed as only dogs can, and chased each other round and round in great\r\ncircles, often disappearing for ten minutes at a time, and springing out\r\nand rolling Flossy over and over when she least expected them.\r\n\r\nFlossy was gay enough, although she couldn't run, and often leapt fully\r\nsix feet high, turning over and over in the air before she came down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnd when she did manage to entice the dogs into the water, it was her\r\nturn to show them her skill; and indeed her feats in the water were\r\nmarvellous. Anyhow, she used quite to astonish the dogs. They were all\r\nvery well in the woods, but couldn't match Flossy in the water, and there\r\nwas no use trying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long mid-day twilights came first, uncertain and gray to begin with,\r\nbut getting brighter and more lovely as time went on. It was as if Nature\r\nwere trying her hand in painting the sky to give the great king of day a\r\nglorious welcome.\r\n\r\nBut one day the snow on the mountain peaks changed to a bright red, while\r\nabove floated just one streak of crimson cloud; higher up, the stars\r\nshone in a strange, green light, and all the horizon was of the richest\r\norange colour.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, surely,\" cried Pansy, \"the sun will rise to-day!\"\r\n\r\nBut the red faded from the mountain-top, the little cloud turned brown,\r\nthen gray, then black, and it was night once more.\r\n\r\n\"No, little sister,\" said Tom kindly; \"but the sun will rise to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAll went to bed early that night, and were up very early in the morning.\r\nIn fact, breakfast was finished before the stars had begun to pale in the\r\nwest. Then came twilight itself, and, long though it was, its intense\r\nbeauty was the best reward for the waiting, watching little Crusoes.\r\n\r\nEvery heart was beating quickly, and Pansy was standing on brave Tom's\r\nshoulder, just to be \"nearer the sky\", she said.\r\n\r\nAll were silent.\r\n\r\nThe sun came at last, and with such a silvery sheen, too, that the\r\nchildren were dazzled.\r\n\r\nThis was best, for they could not thus see the tears that slowly trickled\r\ndown each other's faces.\r\n\r\n\"Look! look! look!\" was all Pansy could say.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, isn't it splendid!\" said Tom, as soon as he could speak.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle is sure to come now,\" said Aralia firmly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go and fish,\" Flossy seemed to say as she sprang three times her\r\nlength in the air, and turned head over heels like the clown in a circus.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Veevee,\" cried the mastiff, \"come for a run in the sunshine.\"\r\nAnd off they set.\r\n\r\nBut the day soon ended, for the sun quickly disappeared. Yet the Crusoes\r\nhad seen it, and that was joy enough for once.\r\n\r\nAnd now the days began to lengthen out, but at the same time earthquakes\r\nand thunder-storms became more and more frequent. The lake felt hot\r\nagain, and the water tossed about so much at times, that even Flossy was\r\nafraid to venture in to catch the fish she could not live without.\r\n\r\nThere was a most terrible earthquake-storm about two weeks after the\r\nfirst sunrise.\r\n\r\nEven Tom himself was frightened this time, for the thunderings and\r\nlightnings and explosions were awful, and lasted for three long days.\r\nIt was pitch dark all the time, and the rain came down in sheets.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, smoke of a strange red colour was seen on the\r\nhills. It looked as if it came from rents in the mountain-sides, and\r\nthere was a smell like burning sulphur in the air.\r\n\r\nBut this season of terror ended at last; the stars shone out, there was a\r\nfine display of northern lights, and, soon after, the sun rose. A stiff\r\nbreeze sprang up, and all the clouds and vapours were blown away, the\r\nlast thing seen being a rainbow in the east.\r\n\r\nThe joy of the Crusoes now knew no bounds. The dogs dashed about, Veevee\r\nbarked \"Wiff!\" Briton barked \"Wowff!\" and Flossy frisked her tail and\r\nwent off to fish.\r\n\r\nThe children now set out for a stroll, and saw many curious sights. Close\r\nto the lake, in several places, the earth seemed to have been ripped\r\nopen, and, looking down as they stood hand in hand on the edge, they\r\nseemed to be gazing right into the world's dark depths.\r\n\r\nNext day Tom took a long walk alone. He went to the top of one of the\r\nhighest hills, having left his sisters in charge of Frank and Briton, but\r\ntaking Veevee and his rifle with him.\r\n\r\nPansy watched him go up and up the mountain, until he was lost to sight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried, as she clapped her hands, \"I know where Tom has gone! He\r\nhas just gone away to bring Uncle and 'Fessor Pete back again.\"\r\n\r\nWell, anyhow, Tom had a look at the sea. It spread out as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, and was covered everywhere with great snow-clad bergs of\r\nice, except just close to the island, where it was clear, but black as\r\nink.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing more than he expected, but somehow he wished it had been\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nHe marched down the other side of the hill for quite a mile, keeping a\r\ngood look-out, however, lest some huge ice-bear should catch him\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nBy and by he missed his little four-footed friend, and traced him by his\r\nfootprints into a cave.\r\n\r\nHe called aloud, but received no answer. The cave seemed to be a vast\r\none, and he had to feel his way in the dark with his rifle, for fear of\r\nfalling down some hole.\r\n\r\nAs he could hear nothing, he thought poor Veevee must be dead, and slowly\r\nand sadly turned back.\r\n\r\nHis foot kicked against something hard when he was near to the entrance,\r\nand, stooping down, he picked up what seemed to be a piece of white\r\nstone, and put it into the pocket of his jacket.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back home at last, poor Pansy cried very much indeed at the\r\nloss of her pet. But when, next morning, she found him curled up at her\r\nfeet, she thought it must have been all a dream.\r\n\r\nHow the dog got back was never known, but it is possible he had been\r\nwandering all night in that cavern, deep down in the earth, and come out\r\nat the lake side of the range of hills.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was quite a month before Tom crossed the hills again. By this time\r\nspring had already come back to Fairy Island. The buds were all out on\r\nthe trees, and the green leaves on a thousand bushes. Wild flowers were\r\neverywhere. The birds, too, had returned, and the sea-gulls had taken up\r\ntheir abode on a great patch of level ground just on the other side of\r\nthe lake. When anyone went near to their nests, which were in thousands,\r\nand so close together that it was difficult to thread one's way through\r\nthem, the noise and screaming they made was deafening.\r\n\r\nNow I don't think that Tom and Frank were cruel, but they had to live,\r\nand those great green-speckled eggs made a splendid addition to the\r\nlarder, so that, what with sunshine and better food, the girls soon got\r\nback all the colour they had lost during the long, long night of winter.\r\n\r\nBut where was the _Valhalla_ and her crew all this time? Would they\r\nnever, never come?\r\n\r\nThe Crusoes lived in hope.\r\n\r\nNow in spring-time the foxes and bears of the north, that have slept or\r\nstarved for months, become bold and dangerous through hunger. Bears are\r\nalways to be feared, but more so at this time of the year than any other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne day the prisoners of Fairy Island had been gayer than usual, but at\r\nlast, tired and happy, they had lain down to rest. It might have been\r\nabout midnight when they were awakened by a warning growl from Briton.\r\nThen, with Veevee, he sprang up and rushed to the gate barking furiously.\r\n\r\nTom sprang to his feet, and snatched up his rifle. He was not left long\r\nin doubt as to who the enemy was. The wild wolf-foxes were in force, and\r\nthe yelping and howling outside was terrible to listen to.\r\n\r\nHe fired his rifle several times right into the centre of the pack,\r\nkilling many and wounding more. This only made matters worse. The fierce\r\nand hungry beasts dashed themselves at the gate and tried to tear it in\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nStones were hurled at them, but all in vain. Poor Briton was as anxious\r\nto get out as they were to get in, and had to be kept back by force.\r\n\r\n\"Go, quick, Frank,\" shouted Tom, \"and stir up the fire; heap more peats\r\nand wood on, and bring lighted torches as soon as you can. I will guard\r\nthe gate till you come.\"\r\n\r\nSo there Tom stood opposed to the whole awful crowd, with their glaring\r\neyes, red tongues, and white-flashing teeth, with only a slight gateway\r\nbetween him and death. When he thrust his rifle between the willow bars\r\nto take a shot, the beasts bit and tore at it, as if they would have\r\ndragged it from his grasp.\r\n\r\nAralia was busy helping Frank, and presently both came running up with\r\nlighted fir-torches, which Tom at once flung over the gate, together with\r\npieces of burning peat and wood. These did splendid work, and after a\r\ntime the terrible pack drew off.\r\n\r\nThere was no more sleep that night, however, and towards morning the\r\nattack began again. The foxes had dragged off their dead and wounded and\r\ndevoured them. In the gray light of morning they rushed to the gate once\r\nmore, and the battle raged again in all its fury.\r\n\r\nPoor little Pansy was trembling and shaking with fear as she looked up\r\nand saw that high up on the walls of the fort those savage, wild animals\r\nhad taken their stand.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible morning, and hope seemed at last to fade, for even\r\nbrave Tom had grown faint and weary, and could fight but little longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come along, Professor! Come along, Mate! The children are there\r\nsomewhere, over in that strange island. Ha! here is a bridge of rocks!\r\nThank goodness for that! And look! here, too, are tracks!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Uncle Staysail who spoke, and behind him was 'Fessor Pete himself,\r\nand at least a dozen well-armed sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" cried the captain. \"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wolves, I think,\" said the professor. \"And hark! surely that was a\r\nrifle-shot. Pray Heaven we may be in time, Staysail!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, men! Hurry up!\" cried the captain; and the men dashed onwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTom had revived a little, and he and Frank were fighting harder than ever\r\nto hold the gate, as bold\r\n\r\n          \"Horatius kept the bridge\r\n  In the brave days of old\".\r\n\r\nBut it was already giving way, and the beasts without seemed to know it.\r\n\r\nBriton was on his legs ready, and all seemed to be lost, when suddenly a\r\nrattling volley of rifle fire was heard from beneath, with shouts of men.\r\n\r\nVolley followed volley, and in less time than it takes me to tell it, the\r\nwild wolf-foxes were seeking safety in flight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Tell us all your story again,\" said Tom to his uncle, as the children\r\nsat round the stove that same evening in the cosy cabin of the\r\n_Valhalla_.\r\n\r\nThey were all washed and clean by this time, and the girls were\r\nbeautifully dressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Ah! well, you see,\" said Uncle as he relit his pipe, \"the professor here\r\nmade a dart for the vessel when the storm came on. He wanted a stronger\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\n\"He caught us just in time, for though the gale was a furious one we\r\ncould steam up to it, and were doing so, when suddenly there was a loud\r\nexplosion; one of the boilers had burst, and the engines were smashed and\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n\"We were now at the mercy of the sea, the waves, and the icebergs too,\r\nand before another day we were blown far away to sea.\r\n\r\n\"Even then we had hope. But in a week's time we were frozen into the main\r\npack, and there we have had to winter, and it is hardly a week since we\r\ngot clear by cutting a canal with our great ice-saws. Oh! it has been a\r\ndreary time for us, but must have been more so to you, poor darlings! and\r\nwell and bravely you have borne it all!\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" he added, \"that even Pansy has grown, and her mother will\r\nhardly know her again when we all get home.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going now, aren't we, 'Fessor Pete?\" said Pansy, who was sitting\r\non his knee.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, yes. It is no use staying here when we have no steam, so\r\nthe ship is now making for England's sunny shores. And we'll get there in\r\nthe rosy month of June. Won't it be nice?\"\r\n\r\nPansy was jumping with joy.\r\n\r\nAralia clapped her hands and cried: \"Just too jolly for anything!\"\r\n\r\nBy and by Aralia sat down to the piano, and Pete brought out his fiddle,\r\nand a very happy evening indeed was spent in the _Valhalla_.\r\n\r\nThe men were keeping it up forward too, around the galley fire, singing\r\nsongs and spinning yarns, for the ship was \"homeward bound\".\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Oh, by the by,\" said Tom one day to the professor, \"I forgot to tell you\r\nthat in the cave where poor Veevee got lost I picked up this curious\r\nstone!\"\r\n\r\nThe professor put his spectacles on his nose and gazed at it for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\"Why, my dear Tom, this is solid gold, in the centre of a coating of\r\nquartz! You're in luck, lad; and it is just as I said; that is the Island\r\nof Gold. We shall return another year, and you will be one of the richest\r\nmen in the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy story is finished, or almost.\r\n\r\n'Fessor Pete and Tom, with Uncle Staysail, to say nothing of the mastiff\r\nBriton, are out there in the Frozen North this very summer, and I do hope\r\nthey will have luck.\r\n\r\nBut Aralia and Pansy, with sometimes Frank and always Veevee, may be seen\r\nany day playing on the sands not far from their mother's home, and Flossy\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nFlossy is wondrously tame, and spends an hour or two almost every day in\r\nthe sea, or on the beach, to the great delight of all who see her. But\r\nAralia has a whistle, and no matter how far away in the water this\r\nstrange pet may be, whenever the call is sounded she comes ploughing back\r\nto the beach, and after she has shaken her bonny coat in the sunshine,\r\ngoes waddling home with her little friend Veevee and the Crusoes of the\r\nFrozen North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Crusoes of the Frozen North, by Gordon Stables",
