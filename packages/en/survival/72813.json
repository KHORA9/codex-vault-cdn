Every attempt has been made to preserve \r\nthe original formatting, including author’s and editor’s notes \r\nin their original placements, while combining both into a single \r\neBook for convenience. The title page has been slightly altered, \r\nboth books’ Table of Contents have been moved to the front, all \r\nnotes have been moved to the back, and a Part II divider has \r\nbeen substituted for the title page of the second book. Additionally, \r\nsome images have been moved.\r\n\r\nThe source texts for this eBook are the first editions of the \r\nEnglish translation published by M. J. Godwin and Co. in 1816. \r\nAs early as two years later, in 1818, the publisher released \r\na second edition with the more familiar title, “The Swiss Family \r\nRobinson: Or, Adventures of a Father and Mother and Four Sons \r\nin a Desert Island: Being a Practical Illustration of the First \r\nPrinciples of Mechanics, Natural Philosophy, Natural History, \r\nand All Those Branches of Science Which Most Immediately Apply \r\nto the Business of Life.” However, scans of this edition were \r\nnot as readily available, so I have chosen to maintain the title \r\nof the edition that I used.\r\n\r\nNew original cover art included with this eBook is granted to \r\nthe public domain.\r\n\r\nInconsistent spelling, hyphenation, and italicization in the \r\noriginal document have been preserved. However, some obvious \r\ntypographical errors have been corrected; see the Errata for \r\na complete list of changes made.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Frontispiece: Family Robinson Crusoe]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \r\nFAMILY \r\nRobinson Crusoe: \r\n\r\nOR, \r\n\r\nJOURNAL \r\nOF A FATHER SHIPWRECKED, WITH HIS \r\nWIFE AND CHILDREN, ON AN \r\nUNINHABITED ISLAND.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF \r\nM.

For the first however, it is not \r\nall children for which it can pretend to be adapted, but only \r\nsuch as are able to mix some reflection with their reading, as \r\nalready possess certain general ideas on the subjects of natural \r\nhistory and geography; in a word, such as have acquired that \r\nportion of instruction which is given from the age of eight to \r\nfourteen years in most of the primary schools in the large towns, \r\nand even in the villages.\r\n\r\nFor the second, I do not by the _friends of children_ particularly \r\nunderstand that class of individuals who are engaged in philosophical \r\nresearches, theories, and experiments on the subject of education; \r\nbut such fathers, teachers, and others, who delight to employ \r\ntheir attention on the youthful mind; who observe with pleasure \r\nthe actions and discourses of children; who reflect naturally and \r\nwithout any preconcerted system upon their faculties, dispositions, \r\nand characters; who find themselves prompted to infuse useful \r\nknowledge into them through the medium of conversation; and who \r\nwill not regard with disdain a simple and well intended essay \r\ntowards their improvement, merely because it pretends to no novelty \r\nof theorems, and is not founded upon the basis of a long series \r\nof scientifical and metaphysical propositions.\r\n\r\nPrefaces are not intended for the perusal of children; but the \r\n_friends of children_ will perhaps be gratified to find in this \r\nsome account of the origin and object of the present work. In \r\nsuch a detail they will perhaps find motives for indulgence, \r\nif not for approbation, and will proceed to the work itself with \r\nless severity of analysis and criticism.\r\n\r\nIt is now nearly twenty years since the writer of the following \r\nsheets began to throw together the hints of his work in detached \r\nparcels. The purpose he had in view was to amuse, to instruct, \r\nand to fashion the character of four sons borne to him by an \r\nexemplary mother: in doing this, he conceived the idea of faithfully \r\npourtraying these four children in correspondence with the germs \r\nof character he already remarked in them. He made them act and \r\nspeak, exactly as they were accustomed to act and speak in the \r\nordinary train of their lives; with this difference only, that \r\nhe often strengthened and made more prominent whatever of excellence \r\nor of frailty he found in them, representing them rather such \r\nas he might suppose them to become at a period of greater maturity, \r\nthan such as they were at the moment of writing; entertaining \r\nthe idea, that by this means he should render their faults the \r\nmore displeasing to them, and alarm them the more with the \r\nconsequences that might result, and that he might render sound \r\njudgement and integrity more lovely in their eyes. The portrait \r\nof the mother was drawn with all that earnest esteem and affection \r\nwhich she inspired in her husband, and which she well deserved. \r\nOn the one side he was anxious to paint his family just as \r\nit was, and on the other he thought that the book so constructed \r\ncould not be without utility to children of the softer sex; \r\nas in delineating his wife he should present to them a model \r\nof the power given to the female sex over the happiness of \r\ntheir families, both as wives and mothers. Various motives \r\nprevented him from introducing girls in his uninhabited island. \r\nThe first was, that he had himself no girls, and that introducing \r\nthem would have spoiled the integrity of his painting: several \r\nother motives may easily be conceived.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to his apprehension, that a book not less useful \r\nthan entertaining might be formed, by transporting in fancy a \r\nsingle family from the civilized world, and placing it in the \r\nmidst of savage nature. Such a family would necessarily derive great \r\nadvantage from the knowledge they had acquired of the inventions \r\nand contrivances of European society. To give children an interest in \r\nthe studies they pursue, it is necessary to excite their curiosity, \r\nand to give them a wish to learn. The lessons of morality and \r\nscience that are interspersed will then be read with pleasure, \r\nand devoured with avidity. Scarcely any thing appeared better \r\ncalculated for such a purpose, than a strange and untried scene \r\nof action, and a multitude of small incidents of a striking nature, \r\nbut entirely within the reach of their early capacities to understand.\r\n\r\nThere is no book that has been more universally read and approved, \r\nfor the opening of the infant mind, than The Adventures of Robinson \r\nCrusoe. Every child is impressed with the conception of this \r\nsolitary and forlorn individual, existing with no aids but those \r\nof his own industry, and carrying on, single-handed, the tremendous \r\nbattle which man, wherever he lives alone, must have to fight \r\nwith nature. Robinson Crusoe shows us human nature in its origin \r\nand in its weakness, and proves to us what reflection and labour \r\nare capable of effecting in the most trying and perilous situations. \r\nHere we are feelingly taught, how inestimably the social state, \r\nwhether in its domestic or its national form, together with the \r\narts and inventions that accompany it, conduces to the well-being \r\nof every individual of whom it is composed.\r\n\r\nThe persuasion of this truth determined the author to give his \r\nlittle family fiction the form under which it now appears, and \r\nto entitle it The Family Robinson Crusoe. It has however in many \r\nrespects a different object from that of the original work; \r\npurposing, as it does, to instruct its young readers in various \r\nsciences, particularly that of natural history, and especially \r\nthe natural history of distant countries and climates. Some \r\nthings this book has in common with its model: the shipwreck, \r\nthe desert island, and the resources drawn by the hero from \r\nthe wreck of his unfortunate vessel. In other points the present \r\nwork is entirely different; for example, in painting the family \r\nscene, in developing the different characters of the members \r\nthat compose it, and in the perpetual attention given by the \r\nfather to instruct his children in different sciences and arts, \r\nand to forward and mature their moral and intellectual natures. \r\nHis own children were especially delighted at finding themselves \r\nbrought forward as the personages of this imaginary history, \r\nand transported to the scene of a distant ocean.\r\n\r\nThe sheets now laid before the public were originally destined \r\nto remain unknown beyond the circle of the family for which they \r\nwere composed; but one of the personages, who is brought forward \r\nas a child in the course of this narrative, having felt in his \r\nown person the deep interest and lively pleasure which the story \r\nexcited, and recollecting how many lasting advantages he had \r\nhimself derived from the use of this book, could not refrain \r\nfrom ultimately resolving to render the benefit of it more general, \r\nand has voluntarily undertaken the labour of giving to it the \r\nform in which it now appears. The very name of Robinson Crusoe, \r\nwhich it bears, will awaken the curiosity of the young reader; \r\nand it is therefore confidently hoped that these new Adventures \r\nwill be graciously received by those for whose instruction they \r\nare destined.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the editor to declare that he lays no claim \r\nto the merit of any one incident in the story; he has merely \r\ntaken the liberty to make some corrections in the style, and \r\nto endeavour to dispose and connect the scattered fragments into a \r\nregular story. His acquaintance with natural history is unfortunately \r\nvery limited, nor has he had leisure to make such researches \r\nas would have been requisite to verify all the facts here brought \r\nforward. He has equally to confess his incompetence with respect \r\nto several of the arts that are here put into action; he has \r\ntherefore been obliged to refer himself on these two points to \r\nthe judgement of the author, and to adopt his descriptions as \r\nhe found them; he is at least well assured that the writer had \r\nrecourse to the best authorities, and was extensively acquainted \r\nwith those books of voyages and travels which are in the highest \r\nesteem. Notwithstanding which, it may however have happened, \r\nthat in the twenty years which have elapsed since this work was \r\nwritten, many new discoveries may have been made, and many juster \r\nprinciples and conclusions have been established. It is therefore \r\nto be desired, that such parents and teachers as shall put this \r\nbook into the hands of the children under their care, or shall \r\nread it with them, would have the goodness to correct its errors, \r\nand supply such omissions as they may discover. In reality, \r\nit is very rarely, and perhaps never, proper that children should \r\nread by themselves; few indeed are the individuals in those tender \r\nyears that are not either too indolent, too lively, or too capricious \r\nto employ themselves usefully upon this species of occupation.\r\n\r\nIn the following Introduction will be found a brief detail of \r\nwhat may be supposed respecting the manner in which the accompanying \r\nnarrative has been brought before the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION. \r\n\r\nIt is well known that a Swiss, Counsellor Horner of Zurich, sailed \r\nsome years ago round the world on board a Russian vessel, the \r\nPodesta, commanded by Captain Kreusenstern. They discovered a \r\nnumber of islands, and one among the rest of a considerable size \r\nand great fertility, situate to the south-west of Java, near \r\nthe coast of Papua or New Guinea, hitherto unknown to navigators, \r\nand which appeared to them worthy to be examined. They landed \r\naccordingly; and to the great surprise of the crew, but particularly \r\nof Mr. Horner, they found this island, which they had conceived \r\nto be uninhabited, already in the possession of a European family, \r\nwho met them on the bank, and saluted them in German. The family \r\nconsisted of a father, a mother, and four sons of a robust and \r\nactive appearance, who willingly communicated to Mr. Horner the \r\nhistory of their adventures.\r\n\r\nThe father had been a pastor or clergyman of West Switzerland, \r\nwho having lost his fortune in the Revolution of 1798, and reflecting \r\non the family he had to bring up, resolved to become a voluntary \r\nexile, and to seek in other climates the means of support. He \r\nsailed accordingly with his wife and children, four sons, from \r\ntwelve to five years of age, for England, where he accepted an \r\nappointment of missionary to Otaheite; not that he had any desire \r\nto take up his abode in that island, but that he had conceived \r\nthe plan of passing from thence to Port Jackson, and domiciliating \r\nhimself there as a free settler. He possessed a considerable \r\nknowledge of agriculture, and, with the aid of his sons, he hoped \r\nto gain for himself there that advantageous establishment, which \r\nhis own country, convulsed with the horrors of war, denied him. \r\nHe turned all that yet remained to him into money, and then vested \r\nhis little property in seeds of various sorts and a few cattle, \r\nas a farming stock. The family took their passage accordingly, \r\nsatisfied with this consolation that they should still remain \r\ntogether, and sailed with favourable winds till they came in \r\nsight of New Guinea. Here they were attacked by a most destructive \r\nand unrelenting tempest; and it is in this crisis of their adventures \r\nthat the Swiss Pastor, or Family Robinson Crusoe, begins the \r\njournal, which he liberally consigned to the care of Mr. Horner, \r\nwho carried it with him into Switzerland; and from the manuscript, \r\nthus brought over from one of the remotest parts of the earth, \r\nthe following narrative has been faithfully printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY ROBINSON CRUSOE. \r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_A shipwreck, and preparations for deliverance._\r\n\r\n. . . . . Already the tempest had continued six terrible days, and \r\nfar from subsiding on the seventh, its fury seemed to increase. \r\nWe had wandered so materially from the right track, and were \r\nso forcibly driven toward the south-east, that not a creature \r\non board knew where we were. The ship’s company were exhausted \r\nby constant labour and watching, and the courage which had hitherto \r\nsustained them now began to fail. The masts had been shivered \r\nto pieces and cast into the sea; several leaks appeared, and \r\nthe ship began to fill. The sailors forbore from swearing, and \r\nwere now employed in prayers, or in making the absurdest vows \r\nas the condition of their release from danger. Each recommended \r\nhis soul to God, but at the same moment thought of contriving \r\nthe best means for preserving his life. My children, said I to \r\nmy four boys who clung to me in terrible alarm, God can save \r\nus, for nothing is impossible to him; but if he sees fit that \r\nwe should not be saved, we must not murmur at his decree, but \r\nrely that what he does is most for our good; that we shall be \r\nnear him in heaven, and united through eternity. Death may be \r\nwell supported when it does not separate those who love.\r\n\r\nMy excellent wife wiped the tears which were falling on her cheeks, \r\nand from this moment became more tranquil; she encouraged the \r\nyoungest children, who were leaning on her knees; while I, who \r\nowed them an example of firmness, was scarcely able to resist \r\nthe grief which assailed my heart at the thought of what would \r\nmost likely be the fate of beings so tenderly beloved. We all \r\nfell on our knees, and supplicated the God of mercy to protect \r\nus; and the emotion and the fervour of the innocent creatures \r\nare a convincing proof, that even in childhood, devotion may \r\nbe felt and understood, and that its effects, tranquillity and \r\nconsolation, may be no less certainly experienced.\r\n\r\nFritz, my eldest son, implored in a loud voice that God would \r\ndeign to save his dear parents and his brothers, generously unmindful \r\nof himself: they got up with a state of mind so improved, that \r\nthey seemed forgetful of the impending danger. I myself began \r\nto feel my confidence in Providence increase as I beheld the \r\naffecting group. Heaven will surely have pity on them, thought \r\nI, and will save their parents to guard their tender years!\r\n\r\nAt this moment a cry of Land, land, was heard through the roaring \r\nof the waves, and instantly the vessel struck against a rock \r\nwith so violent a motion as to drive every one from his place; \r\na tremendous cracking succeeded, as if the ship was going to \r\npieces; the sea rushed in, in all directions; we perceived that \r\nthe vessel had grounded and could not long hold together. The \r\ncaptain in a mournful voice called out that all was lost, and \r\nbade the men lose not a moment in putting out the boats. The \r\nsounds fell on my heart like a blow from a dagger: We are lost! \r\nI exclaimed; and the children broke out into piercing cries. \r\nI then recollected myself, and endeavoured to be more composed; \r\nand addressing them again, I exhorted them to courage, by observing \r\nthat the water had not yet reached us, that the ship was near \r\nland, and that Providence would assist the brave. Keep where \r\nyou are, added I, while I go and examine what is best to be done.\r\n\r\nI left my family, and went on the deck. A wave instantly threw \r\nme down and wetted me to the skin; another followed, and then \r\nanother. I sustained myself as steadily as I could; and when \r\nI could look around, a scene of terrific and complete disaster \r\nmet my eyes: the ship was shattered on all sides, and split in \r\ntwo on one side. The ship’s company crowded into the boats till \r\nthey could contain not one man more, and the last who entered \r\nwere now cutting the ropes to move off. I called to them with \r\nentreaties and prayers to stop and receive us also, but in vain; \r\nfor the roaring of the sea prevented my being heard, and the \r\nwaves, which rose to the height of mountains, would have made \r\nit impossible for a boat to return. All hope therefore from this \r\nsource was extinguished, for the boats and all they contained \r\nwere driving out of sight. My best consolation now was to observe \r\nthat the sea could not enter the ship above a certain height. \r\nThe stern, under which was the cabin that inclosed all that was \r\ndear to me on earth, had been driven to a considerable height \r\nbetween two rocks, where it appeared immoveably fixed; at the \r\nsame time in the distance southward I descried through clouds \r\nand rain, several nooks of land, which, however rude and savage \r\nin appearance, were the object of every hope I could form in \r\nthis distressing moment.\r\n\r\nSunk and desolate from the loss of every chance for human aid, \r\nit was yet my duty to make every effort to appear serene before \r\nmy family. Courage, dear ones, cried I, on entering their cabin, \r\nall is not yet lost. I will not conceal from you that the ship \r\nis aground: but we are at least in greater safety than we should \r\nbe if she were beating upon the rocks: our cabin is above water; \r\nand should the sea be more calm tomorrow, we may yet find means \r\nto reach the land in safety.\r\n\r\nWhat I had just said, appeased the fears of all; for they had \r\nthe habit of confiding in my assurances. They now therefore began \r\nto feel the advantage of the ship’s remaining still; for its \r\nmotion had cruelly annoyed them by jostling them one against \r\nanother, and sometimes against the vessel. My wife, however, \r\nmore accustomed than the children to read my inmost thoughts, \r\nperceived the anxiety which devoured me. I made her a sign which \r\nconveyed an idea of the hopelessness of our situation, and I \r\nhad the consolation to see that she was resolved to support the \r\ntrial with resignation. Let us take some nourishment, said she: \r\nour courage will strengthen with our bodies; we shall perhaps \r\nneed this comfort to support a long and melancholy night.\r\n\r\nSoon after the evening set in: the tempest and the waves continued \r\ntheir fury; the planks and beams of the vessel separated in many \r\nparts with a horrible crash. It seemed impossible for the boats, \r\nor any one of the persons they contained, to escape the raging \r\nof the storm.\r\n\r\nPapa, cried my youngest boy, six years old, will not God assist \r\nus soon?\r\n\r\nHold your tongue, replied his eldest brother. Do you not know \r\nthat it is our duty not to prescribe to God, but to wait for \r\nhis assistance with patience and humility?\r\n\r\nWell spoken, my boy, said I; but you should not have reproved \r\nyour brother so sharply. The eldest instantly ran and kissed \r\nthe innocent little creature.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, their mother had prepared our meal, and the \r\nfour boys partook of it with an appetite to which their parents \r\nwere strangers. They afterwards went to bed, and in a short time, \r\nin spite of the tempest, they were snoring soundly. Fritz, the \r\neldest, sat up with us. I have been examining, said he after \r\na long silence, how it may be possible to save ourselves. If \r\nwe had only some instruments for swimming, some bladders or cork \r\njackets for my mother and my brothers, you and I, father, would \r\nsoon contrive to swim to land.\r\n\r\nThat is a good thought, said I: we will see if we can bring it \r\nto bear this very night, for fear of the worst.\r\n\r\nFritz and I immediately looked about for some small empty tubs \r\nor casks, or tin canisters, heavy enough to keep one of our children \r\nin a state of equilibrium on the surface of the water; these \r\nwe fastened two and two together with handkerchiefs or towels, \r\nleaving about a foot distance between them; attaching this sort \r\nof swimming-jacket under the arms of each child; my wife, at \r\nthe same time, preparing one for herself. We all provided ourselves \r\nwith knives, some string, some turfs, and other necessaries which \r\ncould be put into the pocket, proceeding upon the hope, that \r\nif the ship should go to pieces in the night, we should either \r\nbe able to swim to land or be driven thither by the waves.\r\n\r\nFritz, who had been up the whole of the preceding night, and \r\nwas fatigued with his new and laborious occupation, now lay down \r\nnear his brothers, and was soon asleep; but their mother and \r\nI, too full of anxiety to close our eyes, kept watch, listening \r\nto every sound that seemed to threaten a further change in our \r\nsituation. We passed this terrible night in prayer, in agonizing \r\napprehensions, and in forming various resolutions as to what \r\nwe should next attempt. We hailed with joy the first gleam of \r\nlight which shot through a small opening of the window. The raging \r\nof the winds had begun to abate, the sky was become serene, and \r\nwith hope swelling in my bosom, I beheld the sun already tinging \r\nthe horizon: thus revived, I hastily summoned my wife and the \r\nboys to the deck, that they might partake of the scene. The children \r\nasked with much surprise why we were there alone and what had \r\nbecome of the ship’s company. I answered that they were gone \r\naway in the boats. Next followed, Why did they not take us with \r\nthem? How are we to do without their assistance? How shall we \r\nknow where we are?\r\n\r\nDearest children, said I, a Being more powerful than man has \r\nhelped us to the present moment, and will, no doubt, continue \r\nto help us, if we do not abandon ourselves to a fruitless complaining \r\nand despair. Observe our companions, in whom we had so much \r\nconfidence, have deserted us without mercy, and that Divine \r\nProvidence has given us protection! But, my dear ones, we must \r\nnow trust to our own exertions. Let us be willing to help ourselves, \r\nand we shall obtain support from Heaven. Let us never forget \r\nthis useful maxim, and let each labour according to his strength. \r\nNow let us see what in our situation it is best to set about next.\r\n\r\nFritz advised that we should all throw ourselves into the sea, \r\nwhile it was calm, and swim to land. Ah! that may be well enough \r\nfor you, said Ernest, for you can swim; but we others should \r\nsoon be drowned. Would it not be better to make a float of rafts, \r\nand get to land all together upon it?\r\n\r\nVastly well, answered I, if we had the means for contriving such a \r\nfloat, and if, after all, it were not a dangerous sort of conveyance. \r\nCome along, my boys, let each go a different way about the ship, \r\nand see what he can do to be useful, and what he can find to \r\nenable us to get away.\r\n\r\nThey now all sprang from me with eager looks to do what I had \r\ndesired. I, on my part, lost no time in examining what we had to \r\ndepend upon in regard to provisions and fresh water, the principles \r\nof life; my wife and the youngest boy visited all the animals, \r\nwhom they found in a pitiable condition, and nearly perishing \r\nwith hunger and thirst. Fritz repaired to the ammunition chamber, \r\nErnest to the carpenter’s cabin, and Jack to the apartment of \r\nthe captain; but scarcely had he opened the door, when two large \r\ndogs sprung joyfully upon him, and saluted him with such rude \r\naffection, that, finding himself nearly thrown down, he roared \r\nfor assistance as if they had been killing him. Hunger, however, \r\nhad rendered the animals so gentle, that they licked his hands \r\nand face, uttering all the time a low sort of groan, and continued \r\ntheir caresses till he was almost suffocated. Poor Jack exerted \r\nall his strength in aiming blows at them to drive them away: \r\nat last he began to sympathize in their joyful movements, and \r\nput himself upon another footing; got upon his legs; and gently \r\ntaking the largest dog by the ears, he sprang upon his back, \r\nand with great gravity presented himself thus mounted before \r\nme as I came out of the ship’s hold. I could not refrain from \r\nlaughing, and I praised his courage: but I added a little exhortation \r\nto be cautious, and not go too far with animals of this species, \r\nwho in a state of hunger might be dangerous.\r\n\r\nBy and by my little company were again assembled round me, and \r\neach boasted of what he had to contribute. Fritz had two fowling \r\npieces, some powder and some small shot contained in horn flasks, \r\nand balls in bags.\r\n\r\nErnest produced his hat filled with nails, and held in his hands \r\na hatchet and a hammer; in addition, a pair of pincers, a pair \r\nof large scissars, and an auger, peeped out at his pocket-hole.\r\n\r\nEven the little Francis carried under his arm a box of no very \r\nsmall size, from which he eagerly produced what he called some \r\nlittle sharp-pointed hooks. His brothers smiled scornfully. Vastly \r\nwell, gentlemen, said I; but let me tell you that the youngest \r\nhas brought the most valuable prize: and this is often the case \r\nin the world; the person who least courts the smiles of Fortune, \r\nand in the innocence of his heart is scarcely conscious of her \r\nexistence, is often he to whom she most readily presents herself. \r\nThese little sharp-pointed hooks, as Francis calls them, are \r\nfishing-hooks, and will probably be of more use in preserving \r\nour lives than all we may find besides in the ship. In justice, \r\nhowever, I must confess that what Fritz and Ernest have contributed, \r\nwill also afford us essential service.\r\n\r\nI for my part, said my wife, have brought nothing; but I have \r\nsome tidings to communicate which I hope will secure my welcome: \r\nwhat I have to tell, is, that I have found on board the ship, \r\na cow and an ass, two goats, six sheep, and a sow big with young, \r\nall of whom I have just supplied with food and water, and that \r\nI reckon on being able to preserve their lives.\r\n\r\nAll this is admirable, said I to my little labourers, and there \r\nis only master Jack, who, instead of thinking of something that \r\nmight be useful, has done us the favour to present us two personages \r\nwho no doubt will be principally distinguished by being willing \r\nto eat more than we shall have to give them.\r\n\r\nAh! replied Jack; but I know that if we can once get to land, \r\nyou will see that they will assist us in hunting and shooting.\r\n\r\nTrue enough, said I; but be so good as to tell us how we are \r\nto get to land, and whether you have contrived the means.\r\n\r\nI am sure it cannot be very difficult, said Jack with an arch \r\nmotion of his head. Look here at these large tubs. Why cannot \r\neach of us get into one of them, and float to the land? I remember \r\nI succeeded very well in this manner on the water when I was \r\nvisiting my godfather at S***.\r\n\r\nEvery hint is good for something, cried I, and I begin to think \r\nthat what Jack has suggested is worth a trial; the counsels of \r\neven a child may be worth consideration, and should be accepted \r\nwith gratitude. Quick then. Jack, give me the saw, the auger, \r\nand some nails; we will see what is to be done. I recollected \r\nhaving seen some empty casks in the ship’s hold; we went down, \r\nand found them floating with the water which had got into the \r\nvessel; it cost us but little trouble to hoist them up and place \r\nthem on the lower deck, which was at this time scarcely above \r\nwater. We saw with delight that they were all made of excellent \r\nwood, well guarded by iron hoops, and in every respect in sound \r\ncondition; they were exactly suited for my object; and with the \r\nassistance of my sons I instantly began to saw them in two. In \r\na certain time I had produced eight tubs of equal size and of \r\nthe proper height. We now allowed ourselves some refreshment \r\nfrom the wine and biscuit with which some of these very casks \r\nwere still filled.\r\n\r\nI contemplated with perfect satisfaction my eight little tubs \r\nranged in a line. I was surprised to see that my wife was still \r\ndejected; she sighed deeply as she looked at them: Never, never, \r\ncried she, can I venture to get into one of these.\r\n\r\nDo not decide so hastily, my dear, said I: my plan is not yet \r\ncomplete, and you will see presently that it is more worthy of \r\nour confidence than this shattered vessel, which cannot move \r\nfrom its place.\r\n\r\nI then sought for a long plank capable of being a little curved, \r\nand contrived to fasten my eight tubs to it, leaving a space \r\nat each end of the plank, reaching beyond the tubs, and presenting \r\nan outline like the keel of a vessel; we next nailed all the \r\ntubs to the plank, and then the tubs to each other as they stood \r\nside by side, to make them the firmer, and afterwards two other \r\nplanks of the same length as the first, on each side of the tubs. \r\nWhen all this was finished, we found we had produced a kind of \r\nnarrow boat divided into eight compartments, which I had no doubt \r\nwould be able to perform a short course in calm water.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, our marvellous machine proved so heavy, that \r\nwith the strength of all united, we were not able to move it \r\nan inch from its place. I bade Fritz fetch me a crow, who soon \r\nreturned with it: in the meanwhile I sawed a thick round pole \r\ninto several pieces, to make some rollers. I now with the crow \r\neasily raised the foremost part of my machine, while Fritz placed \r\none of the rollers under it.\r\n\r\nHow astonishing, said Ernest, that this engine, which is smaller \r\nthan any of us, can do more than our united strength was able \r\nto effect! I wish I could know how it is constructed.\r\n\r\nI explained to him as well as I could, the power of Archimedes’s \r\nlever, with which he said he could move the world if you would \r\ngive him a point from which his mechanism might act, and promised \r\nto explain the nature of the operation of the crow when we should \r\nbe safe on land.\r\n\r\nOne of the points of my system of education was to awaken the \r\ncuriosity of my sons by interesting observations, to leave time \r\nfor the activity of their imagination, and then to correct any \r\nerror they might fall into. I contented myself now, however, \r\nwith this general remark, That God sufficiently compensated the \r\nnatural weakness of man by the gifts of reason, invention, and \r\nthe adroitness of the hands; and that human meditation and reflection \r\nhad composed a science called mechanics, the object of which \r\nwas, to teach us how to make our own natural strength act to \r\nan incredible distance and with extraordinary force, by the \r\nintervention of instruments.\r\n\r\nJack here remarked that the action of the crow was very slow.\r\n\r\nBetter slow than never, Jack, replied I. Experience has ever \r\ntaught, and mechanical observations have established as a principle, \r\nthat what is gained in speed is lost in strength; the purpose \r\nof the crow is not to enable us to raise any thing rapidly, but \r\nto raise what is exceedingly heavy; and the heavier the thing \r\nwe would move, the slower is the mechanical operation. But are \r\nyou aware, what we have at our command to compensate this slowness?\r\n\r\nYes, it is turning the handle quicker.\r\n\r\nYour guess is wrong; that would be no compensation: the true \r\nremedy, my boy, is to call in the assistance of patience and \r\nreason; with the aid of these two fairies I am in hopes to set \r\nmy machine afloat. As I said this, I tied a long cord to its \r\nstern, and the other end of it to one of the timbers of the ship \r\nwhich appeared to be still firm, so that the cord being left \r\nloose would serve to guide and restrain it when launched. We \r\nnow put a second and a third roller under, and applying the crow, \r\nto our great joy our construction descended into the water with \r\nsuch a velocity, that if the rope had not been well fastened \r\nit would have gone far out to sea. But now a new misfortune presented \r\nitself: the machine leaned so much on one side that my boys all \r\nexclaimed they could not venture to get into it. I was for some \r\nmoments in the most painful perplexity; but it suddenly occurred \r\nto me that ballast only was wanting to set it straight. I threw \r\nevery thing I could find that was weighty and of small size into \r\nthe tubs: by degrees the machine recovered, and was at length \r\nquite straight and firm in the water, and seeming to invite us to \r\ntake refuge in its protection. All now would have thrown themselves \r\nat once into it, and the boys began to push each other, and dispute \r\nwhich should get in first.\r\n\r\nI however drew them back, plainly perceiving that at best the \r\nvoyage would be hazardous, and that the least motion of even \r\none of these boisterous children might upset it and cause us \r\nto be all drowned. In seeking for a remedy for this inconvenience, \r\nI recollected that savage nations make use of a paddle for preventing \r\ntheir canoes from upsetting. With this thought I once more set \r\nto work to make one of these, that the completion of a contrivance \r\nwhich promised safety to so many cherished beings might not be \r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nI took two of the poles of equal length, upon which the sails \r\nof the vessel had been stretched, and fixed one of them at the \r\nhead and the other at the stern of my floating machine, in such \r\na manner as to enable us to turn them at pleasure to right or \r\nleft, as should best answer the purpose of guiding our machine, \r\nand putting it out to sea. I stuck the end of each pole, or paddle, \r\ninto the bung-hole of an empty brandy keg, which served to keep \r\nthe paddles steady, and to prevent any interruption in the management \r\nof the machine.\r\n\r\nThere remained nothing more for me to do, but to find out in \r\nwhat way I could clear out from the incumbrance of the wreck \r\nand get completely to sea. I got into the first tub, and steered \r\nthe head of the machine, so as to make it enter the cleft in \r\nthe ship’s side where it could remain quiet. I then remounted \r\nthe vessel, and sometimes with the saw and sometimes with the \r\nhatchet, I cleared away to right and left every thing that could \r\nobstruct our passage: and that being effected, we next secured \r\nsome oars for our voyage the next morning.\r\n\r\nWe had spent the day in laborious exertions; it was already late; \r\nand as it would not have been possible to reach the land that \r\nevening, we were obliged, though much against our inclination, \r\nto pass a second night in the wrecked vessel, which at every \r\ninstant threatened to fall to pieces. We now refreshed ourselves \r\nby a regular meal, for during the day’s work, we had scarcely \r\nallowed ourselves to take a bit of bread or a glass of wine. \r\nBeing in a more tranquil and unapprehensive state of mind than \r\nthe preceding day, we all abandoned ourselves to sleep; not however \r\ntill I had used the precaution of tying the swimming apparatus \r\nround my three youngest boys and my wife, as a means of safety, \r\nif the storm should again come on and should put the finishing \r\nstroke to the destruction of the vessel. I also advised my wife \r\nto dress herself in the clothes of one of the sailors, which \r\nwas so much more convenient for swimming, or any other exertions \r\nshe might be compelled to engage in. She consented, but not without \r\nreluctance, and left us, to look for one that might best suit \r\nher size. In a quarter of an hour she returned, dressed in the \r\nclothes of a young man who had served as volunteer on board the \r\nship, and which she had found in his chest. She approached us \r\nwith a natural timidity: but I soon found means to reconcile \r\nher to the change, by representing the many advantages it gave \r\nher. At length she joined in the merriment her dress occasioned, \r\nand one and all crept into our separate hammocks, where a delicious \r\nrepose prepared us for the renewal of our labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. \r\n\r\n_A landing, and consequent occupations._\r\n\r\nBy break of day we were all awake and alert, for hope as well \r\nas grief, is unfriendly to lengthened slumbers. When we had finished \r\nour morning prayer, I said, We now, my best beloved, with the \r\nassistance of heaven, must enter upon the work of our deliverance. \r\nThe first thing to be done, is to give to each poor animal on \r\nboard, before we leave them, a hearty meal; we will then put \r\nfood enough before them for several days; we cannot take them \r\nwith us; but we will hope it may be possible, if our voyage succeeds, \r\nto return and fetch them. Are you now all ready? Bring together \r\nwhatever we mean to take, whatever is absolutely necessary for \r\nour wants. It is my wish that our first cargo should consist \r\nof a barrel of gunpowder, three fowling-pieces, and three carbines, \r\nwith as much small shot and lead and as many bullets as our boat \r\nwill bear; two pair of pocket pistols and one of large ones, \r\nnot forgetting a mould to cast balls in: each of the boys and \r\ntheir mother also should have a bag to carry game in; you will \r\nfind plenty of these in the cabins of the officers. We added \r\na chest containing cakes of portable soup, another full of hard \r\nbiscuits, an iron pot, a fishing-rod, a chest of nails and another \r\nof different utensils, such as hammers, saws, pincers, hatchets, \r\naugers, &c. and lastly some sail-cloth to make a tent. In short, \r\nthe boys brought so many things, that we were obliged to reject \r\nsome of them, though I had already exchanged the worthless ballast \r\nfor articles of use for our subsistence.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, we stepped bravely each into a tub. At the \r\nmoment of our departure we heard all the cocks and hens begin \r\nto crow, as if they were conscious that we had deserted them, \r\nyet willing to bid us a sorrowful adieu. This suggested to me \r\nthe idea of taking the geese, ducks, fowls, and pigeons with \r\nus; observing to my wife, that if we could not find means to \r\nfeed them, at least they would feed us.\r\n\r\nWe accordingly executed this plan. We put ten hens and an old \r\nand a young cock into one of the tubs, and covered it with planks; \r\nwe set the rest of the poultry at liberty, in the hope that instinct \r\nwould direct them towards the land, the geese and the ducks by \r\nwater, and the pigeons by the air.\r\n\r\nWe were waiting for my wife, who had the care of this last part \r\nof our embarkation, when she joined us loaded with a large bag, \r\nwhich she threw into the tub which already contained her youngest \r\nson. I imagined that she intended it for him to sit upon, and \r\nalso to confine him so as to prevent his being tossed from side \r\nto side. I therefore asked no questions concerning it. The order \r\nof our departure was as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the first tub at the boat’s head, my wife, the most tender \r\nand exemplary of her sex, placed herself.\r\n\r\nIn the second, our little Francis, a lovely boy six years old, \r\nfull of the happiest dispositions, but whose character was not \r\nyet pronounced.\r\n\r\nIn the third, Fritz, our eldest boy, between fourteen and fifteen \r\nyears of age, a handsome curl-pated youth full of intelligence \r\nand vivacity.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth was the barrel of gunpowder, with the cocks and \r\nhens and the sail-cloth.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth, the provisions for the support of life.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth, my son Jack, a light-hearted, enterprising, audacious, \r\ngenerous lad, about ten years old.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh, my son Ernest, a boy of twelve years old, of \r\na rational reflecting temper, well informed, but somewhat disposed \r\nto indolence and the pleasures of the senses.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth, a father, to whose paternal care the task of guiding \r\nthe machine for the safety of his beloved family was intrusted. \r\nEach of us had useful implements within reach; the hand of each \r\nheld an oar, and near each was a swimming apparatus in readiness \r\nfor what might happen. The tide was already at half its height \r\nwhen we left the ship, and I had counted on this circumstance \r\nas favourable to our want of strength. We held the two paddles \r\nlongways, and thus we passed without accident through the cleft \r\nof the vessel into the sea. The boys devoured with their eyes \r\nthe blue land they saw at a distance (for to us it appeared to \r\nbe of this colour). We rowed with all our strength, but long \r\nin vain, to reach it: the boat only turned round and round: at \r\nlength, however, I had the good fortune to steer in such a way \r\nthat she proceeded in a straight line. The two dogs we had left \r\non board, perceiving that we had abandoned them, plunged immediately \r\ninto the sea and swam to the boat; they were too large for us \r\nto think of giving them admittance, and I dreaded lest they should \r\njump in and upset us. Turk was an English dog, and Ponto of the \r\nDanish breed. I was in great uneasiness on their account, for \r\nI feared it would not be possible for them to swim so far. The \r\ndogs however managed the affair with perfect intelligence. When \r\nthey found themselves fatigued, they rested their fore paws on \r\none of the paddles, which were now turned crossways, and the \r\nrest of their bodies followed with very little effort.\r\n\r\nJack was disposed to refuse them this accommodation: but he soon \r\nyielded to my argument, that it was cruel and unwise to neglect \r\ncreatures thrown on our protection, and who indeed might hereafter \r\nprotect us in their turn by guarding us from harm, and assisting \r\nin our pursuit of animals for food. Besides, added I, animals \r\nare created beings, and God has given the dog to man to be his \r\nfriend and faithful companion.\r\n\r\nOur voyage proceeded securely, though slowly; but the nearer \r\nwe approached the land, the more gloomy and unpromising we thought \r\nits aspect appeared. The coast was occupied by barren rocks, \r\nwhich seemed to offer nothing but hunger and distress. The sea \r\nwas calm; the waves, gently agitated, washed the shore, and the \r\nsky was serene; in every direction we perceived casks, bales, \r\nchests, and other vestiges of shipwrecks, floating round us. \r\nIn the hope of obtaining some good provisions, I determined on \r\nendeavouring to secure two of the casks. I bade Fritz have a \r\nrope, a hammer, and some nails ready, and to try to seize them \r\nas we passed. He succeeded in laying hold of two of them, and \r\nin such a way that we found it easy to draw them after us to \r\nthe shore. Now that we were close on land, its hideous aspect \r\nwas considerably softened, the rocks no longer appeared one undivided \r\nchain; Fritz with his hawk’s eyes already descried some trees, \r\nand exclaimed that they were palm trees. Ernest expressed his \r\njoy that he should now get much larger and better cocoa nuts \r\nthan those of Europe. I for my part was venting audibly my regret, \r\nthat I had not thought of bringing with us a telescope that I \r\nknew was in the captain’s cabin, when Jack drew a small spy-glass \r\nfrom his pocket, and, with a look of triumph that he was able \r\nto compensate this neglect, instantly presented it to me.\r\n\r\nSo, so, then, said I, you meant to keep this spy-glass for yourself, \r\nand to let no one else have the benefit of it! This was not fair; \r\npleasures and pain, all should be in common in such a situation \r\nas ours. Jack assured me that he had forgot to give it to me \r\nsooner, and that he had taken it for the benefit of all. In reality, \r\nthe glass was of great importance; for with its aid I was able \r\nto make the necessary observations, and consequently became more \r\nsure of the route I ought to take. I remarked that the shore \r\nbefore us had a desert and savage aspect, but that towards the \r\nleft, the scene was much more agreeable: but when I attempted \r\nto steer in that direction, a current carried me irresistibly \r\ntowards the coast that was rocky and barren. By and by we perceived \r\na little opening between the rocks, near the mouth of a creek, \r\ntowards which all our geese and ducks betook themselves; and \r\nI, relying on their sagacity, followed in the same course. This \r\nopening formed a little bay, the water of which was tranquil, \r\nand neither too deep nor too shallow to receive our boat. I entered \r\nit, and cautiously put on shore on a spot where the coast was \r\nabout the same height above the water as our tubs, and where \r\nat the same time there was a quantity sufficient to keep us afloat. \r\nThe shore extended inland in a shelving declivity in the form \r\nof an isosceles triangle, the upper angle of which terminated \r\namong the rocks, while the margin of the sea formed the basis.\r\n\r\nAll that had life in the boat jumped eagerly on land. Even little \r\nFrancis, who had been wedged in his tub like a potted herring, \r\nnow got up and sprang forward; but, with all his efforts, he \r\ncould not succeed without his mother’s help. The dogs, who had \r\nswam on shore, received us as if they were appointed to do the \r\nhonours of the place, jumping round us with every demonstration \r\nof joy: the geese kept up a loud continual cackling, to which \r\nthe ducks, with their broad yellow beaks, contributed a perpetual \r\nthorough bass: the cocks and hens, which we had already set at \r\nliberty, clucked; the boys chattering all at once; produced all \r\ntogether an overpowering confusion of sounds: to this was added \r\nthe disagreeable scream of some penguins and flamingos, which \r\nwe now perceived, some flying over our heads, others sitting \r\non the points of the rocks at the entrance of the bay. By and \r\nby the notes of the latter had the ascendant, from the superiority \r\nof their numbers; and their society became the more unpleasant, \r\nfrom a comparison we could not avoid making, between the sounds \r\nthey uttered, with the harmony of the feathered musicians of \r\nour own country. I had however one advantage in perspective;—it \r\nwas the reflection that, should we hereafter be short of food, \r\nthese very birds might serve for our subsistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Family Landed]\r\n\r\nThe first thing we did on finding ourselves safe on _terra firma_, \r\nwas to fall on our knees, and return thanks to the Supreme Being \r\nwho had preserved our lives, and to recommend ourselves with \r\nentire resignation to the care of his paternal kindness.\r\n\r\nWe next employed our whole attention in unloading the boat. Oh, \r\nhow rich we thought ourselves in the little we had been able \r\nto rescue from the merciless abyss of waters! We looked every \r\nwhere for a convenient place to build a tent under the shade \r\nof the rocks; and having all consulted and agreed upon a place, \r\nwe set to work. We drove one of our poles firmly into a fissure \r\nof the rock; this formed the ridge of our tent, and rested upon \r\nanother pole, which was driven perpendicularly into the ground. \r\nA frame for a dwelling was thus made secure. We next threw some \r\nsail-cloth over the ridge; and, stretching it to a convenient \r\ndistance on each side, fastened its extremities to the ground \r\nwith stakes. By way of precaution, we left the chests of provisions \r\nand other heavy matters on the shore, and fixed some tenter-hooks \r\nnear the edge of the sail-cloth in front, that we might be able \r\nto inclose the entrance during night. I next desired my sons \r\nto look about and collect all the grass and moss they could find, \r\nand spread it to dry in the sun, as it would then serve us for \r\nbeds. During this occupation, in which even the little Francis \r\ncould take a share, I erected at a small distance from the tent, \r\nand near a river from which I hoped to be supplied with fresh \r\nwater, a kind of little kitchen. A few flat stones that I found \r\nin the bed of the river served for a fire-place. I got a quantity \r\nof dry branches: with the largest I made a small inclosure round \r\nit; and with the little twigs, added to some of our turf, I made \r\na brisk cheering fire. We put some of the soup cakes, with water, \r\ninto our iron pot, and placed it over the fire; and my wife, \r\nwith her little Francis for a scullion, took charge of preparing \r\nthe dinner. Francis, from their colour, had mistaken the soup \r\ncakes for glue. Why, papa, said he, what are you going to use \r\nglue for? I am going to make some soup of it, said his mother \r\nlaughing. That is droll enough, answered he; for how shall we \r\nget any meat to put into it, here, where there is nothing like \r\na butcher’s shop?\r\n\r\nLittle blockhead, said I, what you have been thinking was glue, \r\nis in reality excellent meat, reduced as you see to a jelly, \r\nby the process of cookery, and which being dried, is in no danger \r\nof becoming stale. In this state it will bear long voyages by \r\nsea, where it would be difficult to take sufficient animals for \r\nthe use of the ship’s company, who would otherwise be kept constantly \r\non a less wholesome soup made from salted meat; but ours, I assure \r\nyou, Francis, will be excellent. The poor child was hungry enough \r\nto believe he should partake of it with joy.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Fritz had been reloading the guns, with one \r\nof which he had wandered along the side of the river. He had \r\nproposed to Ernest to accompany him; but Ernest replied that \r\nhe did not like a rough and stony walk, and that he should go \r\nalone to the sea-shore. Jack took the road towards a chain of \r\nrocks which jutted out into the sea, with the intention of gathering \r\nsome of the muscles which grew upon them. My own occupation was \r\nnow an endeavour to draw the two floating casks on shore, but \r\nin which I could not succeed; for our place of landing, though \r\nconvenient enough for our machine, was too steep for the casks. \r\nWhile I was looking about to find a more favourable spot, I heard \r\nloud cries proceeding from a short distance, and recognised the \r\nvoice of my son Jack. I snatched my hatchet, and ran in an agony \r\nof apprehension to his assistance. I soon perceived him up to \r\nhis knees in water in a shallow, and that a large sea lobster \r\nhad fastened his claws in his leg. The poor boy screamed pitiably, \r\nand made useless efforts to disengage himself. I jumped instantly \r\ninto the water; and the enemy was no sooner sensible of my approach, \r\nthan he let go his hold, and would have scampered out to sea, \r\nbut that I indulged the fancy of a little malice against him \r\nfor the alarm he had caused us. I turned quickly upon him, and \r\ntook him up by the body and carried him off, followed by Jack, \r\nwho shouted our triumph all the way. He begged me at last to \r\nlet him hold the animal in his own hand, that he might himself \r\npresent so fine a booty to his mother. Accordingly, having observed \r\nhow I held it to avoid the gripe, he laid his own hand upon it \r\nin exactly the same manner; but scarcely had he grasped it, than \r\nhe received a violent blow on the face from the lobster’s tail, \r\nwhich made him lose his hold, and the animal fell to the ground. \r\nJack again began to bawl out, while I could not refrain from \r\nlaughing heartily. In his rage he took up a stone, and killed \r\nthe lobster with a single blow. I was a little vexed at this \r\nconclusion to the scene. This is what we call killing an enemy \r\nwhen he is unable to defend himself, Jack, said I;—it is wrong \r\nto revenge an injury while we are in a state of anger: the lobster, \r\nit is true, had given you a bite; but then you on your part, \r\nwould have eaten the lobster. So I think the game was equal. \r\nAnother time I advise you to be both more prudent and more merciful. \r\nBut pray, papa, let me carry it to my mother, said Jack, fearless \r\nnow of further warfare; and accordingly he carried it to the kitchen, \r\ntriumphantly exclaiming, Mamma, mamma, a sea-lobster!—Ernest, \r\na sea-lobster! Where is Fritz? Where is Fritz? Take care, Francis, \r\nhe will bite you. In a moment all were round him to examine the \r\nwonderful creature, and all proclaimed their astonishment at \r\nhis enormous size; while they observed that its form was precisely \r\nthat of the common lobster so much in use in Europe.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, said Jack, holding up one of his claws; you may well \r\nwonder at his size: this was the frightful claw which seized my \r\nleg, and I believe that if I had not had on my thick sea pantaloons, \r\nhe would have bit it through and through; but I have taught him \r\nwhat it is to attack me: I have paid him well.\r\n\r\nOh, ho! Mr. Boaster, cried I, you give a pretty account of the \r\nmatter. Now mine would be, that if I had not been near, the lobster \r\nwould have shown you another sort of game; for the slap he gave \r\nyou in the face compelled you, I think, to let go your hold. \r\nAnd it is well it should be thus; for he fought with the arms \r\nwith which nature had supplied him, but you must have recourse \r\nto a great stone for your defence. Believe me, Jack, you have \r\nno great reason to boast of the adventure.\r\n\r\nErnest, ever eager about his meals, now bawled out that the lobster \r\nhad better be put into the soup, which would give it an excellent \r\nflavour; but this his mother opposed, observing, that we must \r\nbe more economical of our provisions than that, for the lobster \r\nof itself would furnish a dinner for the whole family. I now \r\nleft them, and walked again to the scene of this adventure, and \r\nexamined the shallow. I then made another attempt upon my two \r\ncasks, and at length succeeded in getting them into the shallow, \r\nand in fixing them there securely on their bottoms.\r\n\r\nOn my return, I complimented Jack on his being the first to have \r\nprocured us an animal that might serve for our subsistence, and \r\nI promised him for his own share, the famous claw which had already \r\nfurnished us with so lively a discussion.\r\n\r\nAh! but _I_ have seen something too that is good to eat, said \r\nErnest; and I should have got it if it had not been in the water, \r\nso that I must have wetted my feet——;\r\n\r\nOh, that is a famous story, said Jack; I can tell you what he \r\nsaw,—some nasty muscles: why, I would not eat one of them for \r\nthe world.—Think of my lobster!\r\n\r\nThat is not true, Jack; for it was oysters, and not muscles, \r\nthat I saw: I am sure of it, for they stuck against the foot \r\nof the rock, and I know they must be oysters.\r\n\r\nFortunate enough, my dainty gentleman, cried I, addressing myself \r\nto Ernest; and since you are so well acquainted with the place \r\nwhere these shell-fish can be found, you will be so obliging \r\nas to dismiss your fears about wetting your feet, and to return \r\nand procure us some. In such a situation as ours, every member \r\nof the family must be actively employed for the common good, \r\nand not be afraid of wetting his feet. Take example by Fritz \r\nand your father: they bear a greater evil, the scorching heat \r\nof the sun, without complaining.\r\n\r\nI will do my best with all my heart, answered Ernest; and at \r\nthe same time I will bring home some salt, of which I have seen \r\nimmense quantities in the holes of the rocks, where I suppose \r\nit is dried by the sun. I tasted some of it, and it was excellent. \r\nPapa, is it not left there by the sea?\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is, Mr. Reasoner, for where else do you think it \r\ncould come from? You would have done more wisely if you had brought \r\nus a bag of it, instead of spending your time in such profound \r\nreflections upon an operation so simple and obvious; and if you \r\ndo not wish to dine upon a soup without flavour, you had better \r\nrun and fetch us a little immediately.\r\n\r\nHe set off, and soon returned: what he brought had the appearance \r\nof sea salt, but was so mixed with earth and sand, that I was \r\non the point of throwing it away. My wife however prevented me; \r\nand by dissolving and afterwards filtering some of it through \r\na piece of muslin, we found it admirably fit for use.\r\n\r\nWhy could we not have used some seawater, said Jack, instead \r\nof having all this trouble?\r\n\r\nSea water, answered I, is even more bitter than it is salt; and \r\nit has besides a disagreeable sickly taste. While I was speaking, \r\nmy wife tasted the soup with a little stick with which she had \r\nbeen stirring it, and pronounced that it was all the better for \r\nthe salt, and now quite ready. But, said she, Fritz is not come \r\nin. And then, how shall we manage to eat our soup without spoons, \r\nor dishes? Why did we not remember to bring some from the ship?\r\n\r\nWhy did we not think of them?—Because, my dear, one cannot think \r\nof every thing at once. We shall be lucky if we do not discover \r\nthat we have forgotten even more important things.\r\n\r\nBut indeed, said she, this is a matter which cannot easily be \r\nset to rights. How will it be possible for each of us to raise \r\nthis large boiling pot to his lips?\r\n\r\nA moment’s further reflection convinced me my wife was right. \r\nWe all cast our eyes upon the pot with a sort of silent and stupid \r\nperplexity, and we looked a little like the fox in the fable, \r\nwhen the stork desires him to help himself from a vessel with \r\na long neck. Silence was at length broken, by all bursting into \r\na hearty laugh at our want of every kind of utensil, and at the \r\nthought of our own folly, in not recollecting that spoons and \r\nforks were things of absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nErnest observed, that if we could but get some cocoa-nuts, we \r\nmight divide and empty them, and use the pieces of the shells \r\nfor spoons.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, that is true enough, replied I; _if we could but get,_—but \r\nwe have them not; our ifs will do but little good; and if wishing \r\nwere to any purpose, I had as lief wish at once for a dozen silver \r\nspoons; but alas! of what use is wishing?\r\n\r\nBut at least, said the boy, we can use some oyster-shells for \r\nspoons.\r\n\r\nWhy, this is well, Ernest, said I, and is what I call a useful \r\nthought. Run then quickly, and get us some of them. But, gentlemen, \r\nI must give you notice, that no one of you must give himself \r\nairs because his spoon is without a handle, or if he should chance \r\nto grease his fingers in the soup.\r\n\r\nJack ran the first, and was up to his knees in the water before \r\nErnest could reach the place. Jack tore off the fish with eagerness, \r\nand threw them to the slothful Ernest, who put them into his \r\npocket handkerchief, having first secured in his pocket, one \r\nshell he had met with of a large size. The boys came back together \r\nwith their booty.\r\n\r\nFritz not having yet returned, his mother was beginning to be \r\nuneasy, when we heard him shouting to us from a small distance, \r\nto which we answered by similar sounds. In a few minutes he was \r\namong us; his two hands behind him, and with a sort of would-be \r\nmelancholy air, which none of us could well understand. What \r\nhave you brought? asked his brothers; let us see your booty, \r\nand you shall see ours. Ah! said he, I have unfortunately nothing, \r\nfor I have seen nothing. What! nothing at all? said I. Nothing \r\nat all, said he. But now, on fixing my eye upon him, I perceived \r\na smile of proud success through his assumed dissatisfaction. \r\nAt the same instant Jack, having stolen behind him, exclaimed: \r\nA sucking pig! A sucking pig! Fritz, finding his trick discovered, \r\nnow proudly displayed his prize, which I immediately perceived, \r\nfrom the description I had read in different books of travels, \r\nwas an agouti, an animal common in that country, and not a sucking \r\npig, as the boys had supposed. The agouti, says M. de Courtills \r\nin his Voyage to St. Domingo, is of the size of a hare, and runs \r\nwith the same swiftness; but its form is more like the pig, and \r\nhe makes the same grunting noise. He is not a voracious animal, \r\nbut is nice in the choice of his food. When his appetite is satiated, \r\nhe buries what remains, and keeps it for another time. He is \r\nnaturally of a gentle temper; but if provoked, his hair becomes \r\nerect, he bites, and strikes the ground with his hind feet like \r\nthe rabbit, which he also resembles in digging himself a burrow \r\nunder ground: but this burrow has but one entrance; he conceals \r\nhimself in it during the hottest part of the day, taking care \r\nto provide himself with a store of patates and bananas. He is \r\nusually taken by coursing, and sometimes by dogs, or with nets. \r\nWhen it is found difficult to seize him, the sportsman has only \r\nto whistle. As soon as the agouti hears the sound, he is instantly \r\nstill, remains resting on his hind feet, and suffers himself \r\nto be taken. His flesh is white, like that of the rabbit; but \r\nit is dry, has no fat, and never entirely loses a certain wild \r\nflavour, which is extremely disagreeable to Europeans. He is \r\nheld in great esteem by the natives, particularly when the animal \r\nhas been feeding near the sea on plants impregnated with salt. \r\nThey are therefore caught in great numbers, and for this reason \r\nthe species is much diminished.—Where did you find him? How did \r\nyou get at him? Did he make you run a great way? asked all at \r\nonce the young brothers. Tell me, tell us all . . . . &c. I, for \r\nmy part, assumed a somewhat serious tone. I should have preferred, \r\nsaid I, that you had in reality brought us nothing, rather than \r\nto have heard you assert a falsehood. Never allow yourself, even \r\nin jest, my dear boy, to assert what you know to be an untruth. \r\nBy such trifles as these, a habit of lying, the most disgusting \r\nand frightful of vices, may be induced. Now then that I have \r\ngiven you this caution, let us look at the animal. Where did \r\nyou find it?\r\n\r\nFritz related, that he had passed over to the other side of the \r\nriver. Ah! continued he, it is quite another thing from this \r\nplace; the shore is low, and you can have no notion of the quantity \r\nof casks, chests, and planks, and different sorts of things washed \r\nthere by the sea. Ought we not to go and try to obtain some of \r\nthese treasures? We ought also, said I, to make our little voyage \r\nto the vessel, and fetch away our animals; at least you will \r\nall agree that of the cow we are pretty much in want. If our \r\nbiscuit were soaked in milk, it would not be so hard, but much \r\nimproved, said our glutton Ernest. I must tell you too, said \r\nFritz, that over on the other side there is as much grass for \r\npasturage as we can desire, and besides a pretty wood, in the \r\nshade of which we could repose. Why then should we remain on \r\nthis barren desert side? Patience, patience, replied I, there \r\nis a time for every thing, friend Fritz; we shall not be without \r\nsomething to undertake tomorrow, and even after tomorrow. But, \r\nabove all, I am eager to know if you discovered in your excursion \r\nany traces of our ship companions. Not the smallest trace of \r\nman, dead or alive, on land or water; but I have seen some other \r\nanimals that more resembled pigs than the one I have brought \r\nyou, but with paws more like those of the hare: the animal I \r\nam speaking of, leaps from place to place on the grass, now sitting \r\non his hind legs, rubbing his face with his front feet, and then \r\nseeking for roots and gnawing them like the squirrel. If I had \r\nnot been afraid of his escaping me, I should have tried to catch \r\nhim with my hands, for he appeared almost tame.\r\n\r\nErnest, with the look and manner of a deep observer, now turned \r\nthe agouti backwards and forwards to examine him on all sides. \r\nAfter a long silence, he said with importance, I cannot be sure \r\nthat this animal, as you all believe, is a sucking pig; his hair \r\nand his snout pretty much resemble, it is true, those of a pig: \r\nbut pray observe his teeth; he has but four incisores in front \r\nsimilar to the genus Voracious animals: in general he has a greater \r\nresemblance to the rabbit than to the hare. I have seen an engraving \r\nof him in our book of natural history; if I am not mistaken he \r\nis named the _agouti_.\r\n\r\nAh! ha! said Fritz, here is a learned professor, profound in \r\nthe subject of natural history!\r\n\r\nAnd who this once is not mistaken? cried I. Spare your raillery, \r\nFritz, for it is really an agouti. I do not myself know any thing \r\nof the animal: but by his description in books or engravings, \r\nwith which his appearance perfectly corresponds; he is a native \r\nof America, lives under ground on the roots of trees, and is, \r\nas travellers report, excellent food. But of this we will judge \r\nfor ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhile we were speaking, Jack was trying with all his might to \r\nopen one of the oysters with his knife; but he could not succeed. \r\nI laughed heartily at his disappointment, and put a few of them \r\non the fire, where they soon opened of themselves. Now then, \r\nboys, you may have as fine and choice a regale as if you were \r\nin a palace. I swallowed one myself; but I have never been fond \r\nof oysters; and the boys, observing the wry face I made, all \r\nlooked at me with surprise. I thought every body was fond of \r\noysters, papa, said one of them. I do not mean to dispute the \r\ntaste of others, replied I; but, for myself, nothing but a craving \r\nhunger could force me to make a meal of them; but you can yourselves \r\ntry the experiment, and perhaps you will like them. This sort \r\nof shell-fish is so little agreeable to the eye of those unaccustomed \r\nto see them, that not one of the boys had any inclination to \r\ntouch them. Shortly, however, Jack, in the character of the most \r\ncourageous, swallowed one hastily, shutting and squeezing up \r\nhis eyes as if it were a medicine, and the others followed his \r\nexample; but one and all declared that the oyster was a fish \r\nnot at all to their taste, and each hastened to dip his shell \r\ninto the pot to get out a little soup; but, as I had foreseen, \r\neach drew out a scalded finger, and it was who could scream the \r\nloudest. Ernest was the only one who had been too cautious to \r\nexpose himself to this misfortune; he quietly took his muscle-shell, \r\nas large and deep as a plate, from his pocket, and carefully \r\ndipping it into the pot, drew it out filled with as much soup \r\nas was his fair share; and casting a look of exultation on his \r\nbrothers, he set it down to wait till it should be cold enough \r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nYou have taken excellent care of yourself, I perceive, said I. \r\nBut now answer me, dear boy, is the advantage worth the pains \r\nyou take to be better off than your companions? Yet this is the \r\nconstant failing of your character. As your best friend, I feel \r\nit to be my duty to balk you of the expected success. I therefore \r\nadjudge your dish of delicious soup to our faithful followers, \r\nTurk and Ponto. For ourselves, we will all fare alike, you as \r\nwell as the rest; we will simply dip our oyster-shells into the \r\npot till hunger is appeased; but the picked dish for the dogs, \r\nErnest, and all the rest _alike!_\r\n\r\nThis gentle reproach sunk, I perceived, into his heart; he placed \r\nthe shell, filled with soup, upon the ground, and in the twinkling \r\nof an eye the dogs had licked up every drop. We on our parts \r\nwere almost as sharp set as they, and every eye was fixed on \r\nthe pot, watching when the steam would subside a little, that \r\nwe might begin dipping; when on looking round we saw Turk and \r\nPonto standing over the agouti, gnawing and tearing him fiercely \r\nwith their teeth and paws. The boys all screamed together; Fritz \r\nseized his gun, and struck them with it; called them the unkindest \r\nnames, threw stones at them, and was so furious, that, if I had \r\nnot interfered, it is probable he would have killed them. He \r\nhad already bent his gun with the blows he had aimed at them, \r\nand his voice was raised so high as to be reechoed from the rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen he had grown a little cool, I seriously remonstrated with \r\nhim on his violence of temper. I represented to him what distress \r\nhe had occasioned his mother and myself for the event of a rage \r\nso alarming; that his gun, which might have been so useful, was now \r\nentirely spoiled; and that the poor animals, upon whose assistance \r\nwe should probably so much depend, he had, no doubt, greatly \r\ninjured. Anger, continued I, is always a bad counsellor, and \r\nmay even lead the way to crimes; you are not ignorant of the \r\nhistory of Cain, who, in a moment of violent anger, killed his \r\nbrother. Say no more, my dearest father, interrupted Fritz in \r\na tone of horror.—Happy am I to recollect on this occasion, resumed \r\nI, that they were animals, and not human creatures, you treated \r\nthus. But an angry person never reasons; he scarcely knows whom \r\nhe attacks. The most convincing proof of this, is, that you just \r\nnow fell upon two dumb animals incapable of judgement, and who \r\nmost likely thought that your agouti was placed there, as the \r\nsoup had been before, for them to eat. Confess too, that it was \r\nvanity which excited the furious temper you exhibited. If another \r\nthan yourself had killed the agouti, you would have been more \r\npatient under that accident. Fritz agreed that I was right, and, \r\nhalf drowned in tears, entreated my forgiveness.\r\n\r\nSoon after we had taken our meal, the sun began to sink into \r\nthe west. Our little flock of fowls assembled round us, pecking \r\nhere and there what morsels of our biscuit had fallen on the \r\nground. Just at this moment my wife produced the bag she had \r\nso mysteriously huddled into the tub. Its mouth was now opened,—it \r\ncontained the various sorts of grain for feeding poultry—barley, \r\npeas, oats, &c., and also different kinds of seeds of vegetables \r\nfor the table. In the fullness of her kind heart she scattered \r\nseveral handfuls at once upon the ground, which the innocent \r\ncreatures began eagerly to seize. I complimented her on the benefit \r\nher foresight had secured for us; but I recommended a more sparing \r\nuse of so valuable an acquisition, observing, that the grain, \r\nif kept for sowing, would produce a harvest, and that we could \r\nfetch from the ship spoiled biscuit enough to feed the fowls. \r\nOur pigeons sought a roosting place among the rocks; the hens, \r\nwith the two cocks at their head, ranged themselves in a line along \r\nthe ridge of the tent; and the geese and ducks betook themselves \r\nin a body, cackling and quacking as they proceeded, to a marshy \r\nbit of ground near the sea, where some thick bushes afforded \r\nthem shelter.\r\n\r\nA little later, we ourselves began to follow the example of our \r\nwinged companions by beginning our preparations for repose. First, \r\nwe charged our guns and pistols, and laid them carefully in the \r\ntent: next, we assembled all together and joined in offering \r\nup our thanks to the Almighty for the succour afforded us, and \r\nsupplicating his watchful care for our preservation. With the \r\nlast ray of the sun we entered our tent, and laid ourselves close \r\nto each other on the grass and moss we had collected in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe children observed, with surprise, that darkness came upon \r\nus all at once; that night succeeded to day without an intermediate \r\ntwilight.—This, replied I, makes me suspect that we are not far \r\nfrom the equator, or at least between the tropics, where this \r\nis of ordinary occurrence; for the twilight is occasioned by \r\nthe rays of the sun being broken in the atmosphere; the more \r\nobliquely they fall, the more their feeble light is extended \r\nand prolonged; while, on the other hand, the more perpendicular \r\nthe rays the less their declination: consequently the change \r\nfrom day to night is much more sudden when the sun is under the \r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nI looked once more out of the tent to see if all was quiet around \r\nus, and then carefully fastened the sail-cloth across the entrance. \r\nThe old cock, awakened by the rising of the moon, chaunted our \r\nvespers, and then I lay down to sleep. In proportion as we had \r\nbeen during the day oppressed with heat, we were now in the night \r\ninconvenienced by the cold so that we were obliged to cling close \r\nto each other for warmth. A sweet sleep began to close the eyes \r\nof my beloved family; I was secretly endeavouring to keep awake \r\ntill I was sure my wife’s solicitude had yielded to the same \r\nhappy state, and then I closed my own. Thanks to the fatigue \r\nwe had undergone, our first night in the desert island was very \r\ntolerably comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. \r\n\r\n_Voyage of discovery._\r\n\r\nI was awaked at the first dawn of day by the crowing of the cocks. \r\nI awoke my wife, and we consulted together as to our occupation \r\nfor the day. We both agreed, that the thing of the most importance \r\nwas to seek for such traces as might be found of our late ship \r\ncompanions, and at the same time to examine the nature of the \r\nsoil on the other side of the river before we came to a determination \r\nabout a fixed place of abode. My wife easily perceived that such \r\nan excursion could not be undertaken by all the members of the \r\nfamily; and full of confidence in the protection of Heaven, she \r\ncourageously consented to my proposal of my leaving her with \r\nthe three youngest boys, and proceeding myself with Fritz on \r\na journey of discovery. I entreated her not to lose a moment \r\nin giving us our breakfast. She gave us notice that the share \r\nof each would be but small, there being no more soup prepared. \r\nWhat then, I asked, is become of Jack’s lobster? That he can \r\nbest tell you himself, answered his mother. But now pray step \r\nand awake the boys, while I make a fire and put on some water.\r\n\r\nThe children were soon roused; even our slothful Ernest submitted \r\nto the hard fate of rising so early in the morning. When I asked \r\nJack for his lobster, he ran and fetched it from a cleft in the \r\nrock in which he had carefully concealed it. I was determined, \r\nsaid he, that the dogs should not treat my lobster as they did \r\nthe agouti, for I knew them for a sort of gentlemen to whom nothing \r\ncomes amiss. I am glad to see, son Jack, said I, that that giddy \r\nhead upon your shoulders can be prevailed upon to reflect. Happy \r\nis he who knows how to profit in the misfortunes of others, says \r\nthe proverb. But will you not kindly give Fritz the great claw \r\nwhich bit your leg (though I promised it to you) to carry with \r\nhim for his dinner on our journey?\r\n\r\nWhat journey? asked all the boys at once. Ah! we will go too: \r\na journey,—a journey—repeated they, clapping their hands and \r\njumping round me like little kids. For this time, said I, it \r\nis impossible for all of you to go; we know not yet what we are \r\nto set about, nor whither we are going. Your eldest brother and \r\nmyself shall be better able to defend ourselves in any danger \r\nwithout you; besides, that with so many persons we could proceed \r\nbut slowly. You will then all three remain with your mother in \r\nthis place, which appears to be one of perfect safety, and you \r\nshall keep Ponto to be your guard, while we will take Turk with \r\nus. With such a protector, and a gun well loaded, who shall dare \r\ntreat us with disrespect? Fritz, make haste and tie up Ponto, \r\nthat he may not follow us; and have your eye on Turk, that he \r\nmay be at hand to accompany us, and get the guns ready.\r\n\r\nAt the word guns the colour rose in the cheeks of my poor boy. \r\nHis gun was so curved as to be of no use; he took it up and tried \r\nin vain to straighten it; I let him alone for a short time; but \r\nat length I gave him leave to take another, perceiving with pleasure \r\nthat the vexation had produced a proper feeling in his mind. \r\nA moment after, he attempted to lay hold of Ponto to tie him \r\nup; but the dog, recollecting the blows he had so lately received, \r\nbegan to snarl, and would not go near him. Turk behaved the same, \r\nand I found it necessary to call with my own voice to induce \r\nthem to approach us. Fritz then in tears entreated for some biscuit \r\nof his mother, declaring that he would willingly go without his \r\nbreakfast to make his peace with the dogs; he accordingly carried \r\nthem some biscuit, stroked and caressed them, and in every motion \r\nseemed to ask their pardon. As of all animals, without excepting \r\nman, the dog is least addicted to revenge, and at the same time \r\nis the most sensible of kind usage, Ponto instantly relented, \r\nand began to lick the hands which fed him; but Turk, who was \r\nof a more fierce and independent temper, still held off, and \r\nseemed to feel a want of confidence in Fritz’s advances. Give \r\nhim a claw of my lobster, cried Jack, for I mean to give it all \r\nto you for your journey.\r\n\r\nI cannot think why you should give it all, said Ernest, for you \r\nneed not be uneasy about their journey. Like Robinson Crusoe \r\nthey will be sure enough to find some cocoa-nuts, which they \r\nwill like much better than your miserable lobster: only think, \r\na fine round nut, Jack, as big as my head, and with at least \r\na tea-cup full of delicious sweet milk in it!\r\n\r\nOh! brother Fritz, pray do bring me some, said the little Francis.\r\n\r\nWe now prepared for our departure: we took each a bag for game, \r\nand a hatchet; I put a pair of pistols in the leather band round \r\nFritz’s waist in addition to the gun, and provided myself with \r\nthe same articles, not forgetting a stock of biscuit and a flask \r\nof fresh river water. My wife now called us to breakfast, when \r\nall attacked the lobster; but its flesh proved so hard, that \r\nthere was a great deal left when our meal was finished, and we \r\npacked it for our journey without further regret from any one. \r\nThe sea-lobster is an animal of considerable size, and its flesh \r\nmuch more nutritious, but much less delicate, than the common \r\nlobster.\r\n\r\nFritz urged me to set out before the excessive heat came on. \r\nWith all my heart, said I, but we have forgotten one thing of \r\nimportance. What is that? asked Fritz looking round him; I see \r\nnothing else to do but to take our leave of my mother and my \r\nbrothers. I know what it is, said Ernest, we have not said our \r\nprayers this morning.\r\n\r\nThat is the very thing, my dear boy, said I. We are too apt to \r\nforget God, the parent of all, for the cares of this world; and \r\nyet never had we so much need of his support and protection as in \r\nour present situation, and particularly at the moment of undertaking \r\na journey to an unknown soil.\r\n\r\nUpon this, our little pickle Jack began to imitate the sound \r\nof church-bells, and to cry Bome! bome! bidi bome, bidiman, bome, \r\nTo prayers, to prayers, bome, bome.—Thoughtless boy! cried I \r\nwith a look of displeasure, will you then never learn that there \r\nis a sacredness in devotion, that, in a well disposed mind, banishes \r\nfor the time every thought of levity or amusement? Recollect \r\nyourself, and let this be the last time you force from me a reproof \r\non a subject of so grave a nature.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour we had completed all that was necessary to be \r\ndone previous to our departure, and were ready to set out. I \r\nhad loaded the guns we left behind, and I now enjoined my wife \r\nto keep by day as near the boat as possible, which in case of \r\ndanger was the best and most speedy means of escape. My next \r\nconcern was to shorten the moment of separation, judging by my \r\nown heart of the emotion of my dear wife; for it was impossible \r\nwe could mutually be without the most painful apprehension, as \r\nto what new misfortune might occur on either side during the \r\ninterval. We all melted into tears;—I seized this instant for \r\ndrawing Fritz away, and in a few moments the sobs and often repeated \r\nadieus of those we left behind, were drowned in the noise of \r\nthe waves which we were approaching on our way, and which now \r\nturned our thoughts upon ourselves and the immediate object of \r\nour journey.\r\n\r\nThe river we were about to pass, was on each side so steep as \r\nto be inaccessible, except by one narrow slip near the mouth, \r\non one side, and from whence we had already drawn our supply \r\nof fresh water: but there was no means of effecting a passage \r\nacross from this place, the opposite shore being an unbroken \r\nline of sharp, high, perpendicular rocks. We therefore walked on, \r\nfollowing the course of the river till we arrived at an assemblage \r\nof rocks at which the stream formed a cascade: a few paces beyond, \r\nwe observed some large fragments of rock which had fallen into \r\nthe bed of the river; by stepping upon these, and making now \r\nand then some hazardous leaps, we at length contrived to reach \r\nto the other side. We had proceeded a short way along the rock \r\nwe ascended in landing, forcing ourselves a passage through overgrown \r\ngrass mixed with plants, and rendered more capable of resistance \r\nby being half dried up by the sun. Perceiving however, that walking \r\non this kind of surface, joined to the heat, would soon exhaust \r\nour strength, we looked for a path by which we might descend \r\nand proceed along the river, in which direction we hoped to meet \r\nwith fewer obstacles, and perhaps might discover traces of the \r\nboats and of our ship companions.\r\n\r\nWhen we had walked about a hundred paces, we heard a loud noise \r\nbehind us as if we were pursued, and perceived a rustling motion \r\nin the grass, which was almost as tall as ourselves. I confess \r\nI was a good deal alarmed, thinking that it was probably occasioned \r\nby some frightful serpent, a tiger, or other ferocious animal, \r\nwhich might instantly devour us. But I was well satisfied with \r\nthe courage of Fritz, who, instead of being frightened and running \r\naway, stood still and firm to face the danger; the only motion \r\nhe made being that of seeing that his piece was fit to be discharged, \r\nand turning himself to front the spot from whence the noise \r\nproceeded. Our alarm however was of short duration; for what was our \r\njoy on seeing rush out, not an enemy, but our faithful Turk whom \r\nin the distress of the parting scene we had quite forgotten, \r\nand whom no doubt our anxious relatives had sent on to us! We received \r\nthe poor fellow with lively joy, and did not fail to commend \r\nboth the bravery and discretion of my son, in not yielding to even \r\na rational alarm, and for waiting till he was sure of the object \r\nbefore he resolved to fire: had he done otherwise, he might have \r\ndestroyed a creature formed to afford us various kinds of aid, \r\nand to contribute by the kindness of his temper to the pleasures \r\nof our domestic scene. Observe, my dear boy, said I, to what dangers \r\nthe tumult of the passions exposes us: the anger which over-powered \r\nyou yesterday, and the terror natural to the occasion we have \r\nthis moment witnessed, if you had unfortunately given way to \r\nit, might either of them have produced for us an irretrievable \r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nFritz assured me he was sensible of truth and importance of my \r\nremarks; that he would watch constantly over the defects of his \r\ntemper: and then he fell to caressing the faithful and interesting \r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nConversing on such subjects as these, we pursued our way. On \r\nour left was the sea, and on our right, at the distance of half \r\na league, the continuation of the ridge of rocks, which extended \r\nfrom the place of our debarkation in a direction nearly parallel \r\nwith the shore, the summit every where adorned with a fresh verdure \r\nand a great variety of trees; and the space between, partly covered \r\nwith tall grass and partly with small clumps of bushes, which \r\non one side extended to the rocks, and on the other to the sea. \r\nWe were careful to proceed in a course as near the shore as possible, \r\nfixing our eyes rather upon its smooth expanse than upon the \r\nland, at every instant in hopes to see something of the boats. \r\nWe did not however wholly neglect the shore, where we looked \r\nabout in all directions for the objects of our search: but our \r\nendeavours were all in vain; no sign appeared of their having \r\nbeen near the spot.\r\n\r\nFritz proposed to fire his gun from time to time, suggesting \r\nthat, should they be any where concealed near us, they might \r\nthus be led to know of our pursuit.\r\n\r\nThis would be vastly well, answered I, if you could contrive \r\nfor our friends to hear the report of the gun, and not the savages, \r\nwho are most likely not far distant, and who would be induced \r\nby the alarm, to watch and surprise us. I am thinking, father, \r\ninterrupted Fritz, that there is no good reason why we should \r\ngive ourselves so much trouble and uneasiness about persons who \r\nabandoned us so cruelly, and thought only of their own safety.\r\n\r\nThere is not only one good reason, but many, replied I: first, \r\nwe should not return evil for evil; next, it may be in their \r\npower to be of use and to assist us; and lastly, that they are \r\nmost likely at this moment in the greatest want of our exertions. \r\nIt was their lot to escape with nothing but their persons from \r\nthe ship, if indeed they are still alive while we had the good \r\nfortune to secure provisions enough for present subsistence to \r\na share of which they are as fully entitled as ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut, father, while we are wandering here and losing our time \r\nalmost without a hope of benefit to them, might we not better \r\nemploy ourselves in returning to the vessel and saving the lives \r\nof the animals on board?\r\n\r\nWhen a variety of duties present themselves for our choice, we \r\nshould always give the preference to that which can confer the \r\nmost solid advantage. The saving of the life of a man, is a more \r\nexalted action than to be employed in contributing to the further \r\ncomfort of some quadrupeds, whom we have already supplied with \r\nfood for several days longer, particularly as the sea is in so \r\ncalm a state, that we need entertain no apprehension that the \r\nship will be sunk or go entirely to pieces just at present.\r\n\r\nMy son made no reply to what I said, and we each seemed by mutual \r\nsilent consent to take a few moments for reflection.\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone about two leagues, we entered a wood situated \r\na little further from the sea: here we threw ourselves on the \r\nground, and under the shade of a tree, by the side of a clear \r\nrunning stream, took out some provisions and refreshed ourselves. \r\nWe heard on every side around us, the chirping, singing, and \r\nthe motion of unknown birds among the leaves, and which in reality \r\nwere more attractive by their splendid plumage than by any charm \r\nof note. Fritz assured me that between the branches of the bushes \r\nhe saw some animals resembling apes: this indeed was further \r\nconfirmed by the restless movements we had observed in Turk, \r\nwho began to smell about him, and to bark so loud that the wood \r\nresounded with the noise. Fritz stole softly about to be sure, \r\nand raising his head to spy into the branches above his height, \r\nhe stumbled on a small round body which lay on the ground: he \r\ntook it up and brought it to me, observing that he thought it \r\nmust be the nest of some bird. What makes you of that opinion? \r\nsaid I. It is, I think, much more like a cocoa-nut.\r\n\r\nBut I have read that there are some kinds of birds who build \r\ntheir nests quite round; and look, father, how the outside is \r\ncrossed and twined!\r\n\r\nThat is true, Fritz; but it is wrong from a single view to be \r\nso positive. Do you not perceive that what you take for straws \r\ncrossed and twined by the beak of a bird, is in fact a coat of \r\nfibres formed by the hand of nature? Do you not remember to have \r\nread that the nut of a cocoa shell is inclosed within a round \r\nfibrous covering, which again is surrounded by a skin of a thin \r\nand fragile texture? I see that in the one you hold in your hand, \r\nthis skin has been destroyed by time, and this is the reason \r\nwhy the twisted fibres (or inner covering) are so apparent; but \r\nnow let us break the shell, and you will see the nut inside.\r\n\r\nWe soon accomplished this; but the nut, alas, from lying on the \r\nground had perished, and appeared but little different from a \r\nbit of dried skin, and not the least inviting to the palate.\r\n\r\nFritz was much amused at this discovery. How I wish Ernest could \r\nhave been here! cried he. How he envied me the fine large cocoa-nuts \r\nI was to find, and the whole tea cup full of sweet delicious \r\nmilk, which was to spring out upon me from the inside! But, father, \r\nI myself believed that the cocoa-nut contained a sweet refreshing \r\nliquid, a little like the juice of almonds; travellers surely \r\ntell untruths!\r\n\r\nTravellers certainly do sometimes tell untruths, but on the subject \r\nof the cocoa-nut I believe them to be innocent. The cocoa-nut \r\nis well known to contain the liquid you describe, just before \r\nthey are in a state of ripeness. It is the same with our European \r\nnuts, with only the difference of quantity; and the circumstance \r\nis common to both, that as the nut ripens, the milk diminishes, \r\nby thickening and becoming the same substance as the nut. If \r\nyou put a ripe nut a little way under the earth in a good soil, \r\nthe kernel will shoot and burst the shell; but if it remain above \r\nground, or in a place that does not suit its nature, the principle \r\nof vegetation is extinguished by internal fermentation, and the \r\nnut perishes as you have seen.\r\n\r\nI am now surprised that this principle is not extinguished in \r\nevery nut; for the shell is so hard, it seems impossible for \r\na softer substance to break it.\r\n\r\nThe peach stone is no less hard: the kernel notwithstanding never \r\nfails to break it, if it is placed in a well nurtured soil.\r\n\r\nNow I begin to understand. The peach stone is divided into two \r\nparts like a muscle-shell; it has a kind of seam round it, which \r\nseparates of itself when the kernel is swelled by moisture:—but \r\nthe cocoa-nut in my hand is not so divided, and I cannot conceive \r\nof its separating.\r\n\r\nI grant that the cocoa-nut is differently formed; but you may \r\nsee by the fragments you have just thrown on the ground, that \r\nnature has in another manner stepped in to its assistance. Look \r\nnear the stalk, and you will discover three round holes, which are \r\nnot, like the rest of its surface, covered with a hard impenetrable \r\nshell, but are stopped by a spongy kind of matter; it is through \r\nthese that the kernel shoots.\r\n\r\nI will gather all the pieces and take them to Ernest, and tell \r\nhim all these particulars; I wonder what he will say about it, \r\nand how he will like the withered nut.\r\n\r\nNow the fancy of your father, my dear boy, would be to find you \r\nwithout so keen a relish for a bit of mischief. Joke with Ernest \r\nif you will about the withered nut; but I should like to see \r\nyou heal the disappointment he will feel, by presenting him at \r\nlast with a sound and perfect nut, provided we should have one \r\nto spare.\r\n\r\nAfter looking for some time, we had the good luck to meet with \r\none single nut. We opened it, and finding it sound, we sat down \r\nand ate it for our dinner, by which means we were enabled to \r\nhusband the provisions we had brought. The nut, it is true, was \r\na little oily and rancid; yet, as this was not a time to be nice, \r\nwe made a hearty meal, and then continued our route. We did not \r\nquit the wood, but pushed our way through it, being often obliged \r\nto cut a path through the bushes overrun by creeping plants, \r\nwith our hatchet. At length we reached a plain, which afforded \r\na more extensive prospect and a path less perplexed and intricate.\r\n\r\nWe next entered a forest to the right, and soon observed in it \r\nhere and there some trees of a particular species. Fritz, whose \r\nsharp eye was continually on a journey of discovery, remarked \r\nthat some of them were of so very extraordinary an appearance, \r\nthat he could not resist the curiosity he felt to examine them \r\nclosely. O heavens! father, he next exclaimed, what a singular \r\nkind of trees, with wens growing all about their trunks! We both \r\nwalked up to some of them, and I perceived, with great surprise \r\nand satisfaction, that they were of the gourd tree kind, the \r\ntrunks of which bear fruit. Fritz, who had never heard of such \r\na tree, could not conceive the meaning of what he saw, and asked \r\nme if the fruit was a sponge or a wen. We will see, I replied, \r\nif we cannot unravel the mystery. Try to get down one of them, \r\nand we will examine them minutely.\r\n\r\nI have got one, cried Fritz, and it is exactly like a gourd, \r\nonly the rind is thicker and harder.\r\n\r\nIt then, like the rind of that fruit, can be used for making \r\nvarious utensils, observed I; plates, dishes, basons, flasks. \r\nWe will give it the name of the gourd tree.\r\n\r\nFritz jumped for joy. O heavens! cried he in ecstasy, how happy \r\nmy mother will be! She will no longer have the vexation, when \r\nshe makes soup, of thinking that we shall all scald our fingers!\r\n\r\nWhat, my boy, do you think is the reason that this tree bears \r\nits fruit only on the trunk and on its topmost branches?\r\n\r\nI think it must be because the middle branches are too feeble \r\nto support such a weight.\r\n\r\nYou have guessed exactly right.\r\n\r\nBut are these gourds good to eat?\r\n\r\nAt worst they are, I believe, harmless; but they have not a very \r\ntempting flavour. The negro savages set as much value on the \r\nrind of this fruit as on gold, for its use to them is indispensable. \r\nThese rinds serve them to keep their food and drink in, and sometimes \r\nthey even cook their victuals in them.\r\n\r\nOh, father! it must be impossible to cook their victuals in them; \r\nfor the heat of fire would soon consume such a substance.\r\n\r\nI did not say the rind was put upon the fire.\r\n\r\nHow droll! Pray how are victuals to be cooked without fire?\r\n\r\nNor did I say that victuals could be cooked without a fire; and \r\nmy meaning was, that there is no need to put the vessel that \r\ncontains the food, upon the fire.\r\n\r\nI have not the least idea of what you mean; there seems to be \r\na miracle.\r\n\r\nSo be it, my son. A little tincture of enchantment is the lot \r\nof man. When he finds himself deficient in intelligence, or is \r\ntoo indolent to give himself the trouble to reflect, he is driven \r\nby his weakness to ascribe to a miracle, or to witchcraft, what \r\nis, most likely, nothing but the most ordinary operation of art \r\nor nature.\r\n\r\nWell, father, I will then believe in what you tell me of these \r\nrinds.\r\n\r\nThat is, you will cut the matter short, by resolving to swear \r\non the word of another; this is an excellent method for letting \r\nyour own reason lie fallow. Come, come, no such idleness; let \r\nme help you to understand this amazing phenomenon. When it is \r\nintended to dress food in one of these rinds, the process is, \r\nto cut the fruit into two equal parts, and scoop out the whole \r\nof the inside; some water is put into one of the halves, and \r\ninto the water some fish, a crab, or whatever else is to be dressed; \r\nthen some stones red hot, beginning with one at a time, are thrown \r\nin, which impart sufficient heat to the water to dress the food, \r\nwithout the smallest injury to the pot.\r\n\r\nBut is not the food spoiled by ashes falling in, or by pieces \r\nof the heated stones separating in the water?\r\n\r\nCertainly it is not very easy to make fine sauces or ragouts in \r\nsuch a vessel; but a dressing of the meat is actually accomplished, \r\nand the negroes and savages, who are principally the persons \r\nto make use of what is thus cooked, are not very delicate: but \r\nI can imagine a tolerable remedy for even the objection you have \r\nfound. The food might be inclosed in a vessel small enough to \r\nbe contained in our capacious half of a gourd, and thus be cooked \r\nupon the principle so much used in chemistry, the application \r\nof a milder heat than fire. And this method of cooking has also \r\nanother advantage, that the thing contained cannot adhere to \r\nthe sides or bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\nWe next proceeded to the manufacture of our plates and dishes. \r\nI taught my son how to divide the gourd with a bit of string, \r\nwhich would cut more equally than a knife; I tied the string \r\nround the middle of the gourd as tight as possible, striking \r\nit pretty hard with the handle of my knife, and I drew tighter \r\nand tighter till the gourd fell apart, forming two regular shaped \r\nbowls or vessels; while Fritz, who had used a knife for the same \r\noperation, had entirely spoiled his gourd by the irregular strokes \r\nof his instrument. I recommended his making some spoons with \r\nthe spoiled rind, as it was good for no other purpose. I, on \r\nmy part, had soon completed two dishes of convenient size, and \r\nsome smaller ones to serve as plates.\r\n\r\nFritz was in the utmost astonishment at my success. I cannot \r\nimagine, father, said he, how this way of cutting the gourd could \r\noccur to you!\r\n\r\nI have read the description of such a process, replied I, in \r\nbooks of travels; and also, that such of the savages as have \r\nno knives, and who make a sort of twine from the bark of trees, \r\nare accustomed to use it for this kind of purpose. So you see \r\nwhat benefit may be derived from reading, and from afterwards \r\nreflecting on what we read.\r\n\r\nAnd the flasks, father; in what manner are they made?\r\n\r\nFor this branch of their ingenuity they make preparation a long \r\ntime beforehand. If a negro wishes to have a flask or bottle \r\nwith a neck, he ties a very young gourd round in the proper place \r\nwith a piece of string, of linen, bark of a tree, or any thing \r\nhe can get hold of; he draws this bandage so tight, that the \r\npart at liberty soon forms itself to a round shape, while the \r\npart which is confined contracts, and remains ever after narrow. \r\nBy this method it is that they obtain flasks or bottles of a \r\nperfect form.\r\n\r\nAre then the bottle-shaped gourds I have seen in Europe trained \r\nby a similar preparation? \r\n\r\nNo, they are not; they are of another species, and what you have \r\nseen is their natural shape.\r\n\r\nOur conversation and our labour thus went on together. Fritz \r\nhad completed some plates, and was not a little proud of this \r\nachievement. Ah, how delighted my mother will be to eat upon \r\nthem! cried he. But how shall we convey them to her? They will \r\nnot, I fear, bear travelling well.\r\n\r\nWe must leave them here on the sand for the sun to dry them \r\nthoroughly; this will be accomplished by the time of our return \r\nthis way, and we can then carry them with us; but care must \r\nbe taken to fill them with sand, that they may not shrink or \r\nwarp in so ardent a heat. My boy did not dislike this task; \r\nfor he had no great fancy to the idea of carrying such a load \r\non our journey of further discovery. Our sumptuous service \r\nof porcelain was accordingly spread upon the shore, and abandoned \r\nto its fate.\r\n\r\nWe amused ourselves as we walked along in endeavouring to fashion \r\nsome spoons from the fragments of the gourd-rinds. I had the \r\nfancy to try my skill upon a piece of cocoa-nut; but I must needs \r\nconfess that what we produced had not the least resemblance to \r\nthose I had seen in the Museum at London, and which were shown \r\nthere as the work of some of the islanders of the Southern Seas. \r\nA European without instruments must always find himself excelled \r\nin such attempts by the superior adroitness and patience of savages; \r\nin this instance too, of ourselves, we had the assistance of \r\nknives, while the savages have only sharp flat stones to work \r\nwith.\r\n\r\nMy attempt has been scarcely more successful than your own, I \r\ncried; and to eat soup with either your spoon or mine, we ought \r\nto have mouths extending from ear to ear.\r\n\r\nTrue enough, father, answered Fritz; but it is not my fault. \r\nIn making mine, I took the curve of my bit of rind for a guide; \r\nif I had made it smaller, it would have been too flat, and it is \r\nstill more difficult to eat with a shovel than with an oyster-shell. \r\nBut I am thinking that they may serve till I have learned to \r\nimprove upon my first attempt, and I am quite sure of the pleasure \r\nthey will afford my mother. I imagine it pleases God sometimes \r\nto visit his creatures with distress, that they may learn to \r\nbe satisfied with a little.\r\n\r\nThat is an excellent remark, my boy, said I, and gives me more \r\npleasure than a hundred crowns would do. Fritz burst into a fit \r\nof laughter. You do not rate my remark very high when you say \r\nthis, father, cried he, for of what use would a hundred crowns \r\nbe to you at present? If you had said a good soup or a hundred \r\ncocoa-nuts, I should be much prouder for having made it.\r\n\r\nBut as it is, my son, you have a right to be proud. I am well \r\npleased to find you are beginning to estimate things according \r\nto their real value and usefulness, instead of considering them \r\nas good or bad, like children, upon feeble views. Money is only \r\na means of exchange in human society; but here on this solitary \r\ncoast, nature is more generous than man, and asks no payment \r\nfor the benefits she bestows.\r\n\r\nWhile these different conversations and our labours had been \r\ngoing on, we had not neglected the great object of our pursuit,—the \r\nmaking every practicable search for our ship-companions. But \r\nall, alas, was in vain.\r\n\r\nAfter a walk of about four leagues in all, we arrived at a spot \r\nwhere a slip of land reached far out into the sea, on which we \r\nobserved a hill or rising piece of ground of considerable height. \r\nOn a moment’s reflection we determined to ascend to its summit, \r\nwhich could not fail to give us a clear view of all adjacent \r\nparts; this would save us the fatigue of further rambles. We \r\naccordingly accomplished the design.\r\n\r\nWe did not reach the top of the hill without many courageous \r\nefforts and a plentiful perspiration: but when there, it presented \r\na magnificent scene of wild and solitary beauty, comprehending \r\na vast extent of land and water. It was, however, in vain that \r\nwe made use of our spying glass; no trace of man appeared. A \r\nhighly embellished nature presented herself; and though deprived \r\nof human succour, we were in the highest degree sensible of her \r\nthousand charms. The shore, rounded by a bay of some extent, \r\nthe bank of which ended in a promontory on the further side; \r\nthe agreeable blue tint of its surface; the sea, gently agitated \r\nwith waves, in which the rays of the sun were reflected; the \r\nwoods of variegated hues and verdure, formed altogether a picture \r\nof such new and exquisite delight, that if the recollection of \r\nour unfortunate companions, already perhaps ingulfed in this \r\nvery ocean, had not intervened to damp our spirits, we should \r\nhave yielded to the ecstasy the scene was calculated to inspire. \r\nIn reality, from this moment we began to lose the consolatory \r\nhope we had hitherto entertained, and a certain sadness stole \r\ninvoluntarily into our hearts. We, however, became but the more \r\nsensible of the goodness of the Divine Being in the special \r\nprotection afforded us, in permitting us to find a home where \r\nthere seemed to be no cause for fear of danger from without, where \r\nwe had not experienced even the want of food, and where there seemed \r\nto be a prospect of future safety for us all. We had encountered \r\nno venomous or ferocious animals; and as far as our sight could \r\nyet reach, we were not threatened by the approach of savages. \r\nI remarked to Fritz that we seemed destined to a solitary life, \r\nand that it was a rich country which appeared to be allotted us \r\nfor a habitation; at least our habitation it must be, unless some \r\nvessel should happen to put on shore on the same coast, and be \r\nin a condition to take us back to our native land. And God’s will \r\nbe done! added I, for he knows what is best for us.\r\n\r\nHaving left our native country, fixed in the intention of inhabiting \r\nsome more propitious soil,* it was natural to expect that we \r\nmust at first encounter difficult adventures. Let us, therefore, \r\nconsider our present situation as no disappointment in any essential \r\nrespect. We can pursue our scheme for agriculture. We shall learn \r\nto invent arts. Our only want is numbers.\r\n\r\n* See the Introduction.\r\n\r\nAs for me, answered Fritz, I care but little about being so few \r\nof us. If I have the happiness of seeing you and my mother well \r\nand satisfied, I shall not give myself much uneasiness about \r\nthose wicked unkind ship companions of ours.\r\n\r\nDo not say that, my boy; they were not all bad people; and the \r\ngreater part of them would have become better men here, because \r\nthey would not have been exposed to the attacks of seduction. \r\nSocial intercourse, common interests, united exertions, mutual \r\nservices and counsels, together with the reflections which would \r\nhave grown in such a state as this, are agents capable of powerfully \r\ncontributing to the well-being of the individual, and to a happy \r\nand successful industry.\r\n\r\nWe, however, of ourselves, observed Fritz, form a larger society \r\nthan was the lot of Adam before he had children; and as we grow \r\nolder, we will perform all the necessary labour, while you and \r\nmy mother enjoy a serene repose.\r\n\r\nYour assurances are as kind as I can desire, and they encourage \r\nme to struggle with what hardships may present themselves. Who \r\ncan foresee in what manner it may be the will of Heaven to dispose \r\nof us? In times of old, God said to one of his chosen: “I will \r\ncause a great nation to descend from thy loins.”\r\n\r\nAnd why may not we too become patriarchs, if it please God to \r\ncontinue our lives?\r\n\r\nWhy not? you ask—and I have not now time to answer. But come \r\nalong, my young patriarch, and let us find a shady spot, that \r\nwe may not be consumed with the intensity of the sun’s heat before \r\nthe patriarchal condition can be conferred upon us. Look yonder \r\nat that inviting wood: let us hasten thither to take a little \r\nrest, then eat our dinner, and return to our dear expecting family.\r\n\r\nWe descended from the hill, and having regained the shore, we \r\nmade our way to the wood of palms, which I had just pointed out \r\nto Fritz; but not without considerable difficulty, for our path \r\nlay through a quantity of reeds, entwined with other plants, which \r\ngreatly obstructed our march. We advanced slowly and cautiously, \r\nfearing at every step we might receive a mortal bite from some \r\nserpent that might be concealed among them. We made Turk go before \r\nus, to give us timely notice of any thing dangerous. I also cut \r\nmyself a stalk of the reeds of uncommon length and thickness, \r\nthe better to defend myself against an enemy that might attack \r\nme from the ground. It was not without astonishment that I perceived \r\na glutinous kind of sap proceed from the divided end of the stalk. \r\nPrompted by curiosity, I tasted the sap, and found it sweet and \r\nof an agreeable flavour, so that not a doubt remained in my mind \r\nthat we were passing through a fine plantation of sugar-canes. \r\nI again applied the cane to my lips, and sucked it for some moments, \r\nand soon after felt myself singularly refreshed and strengthened \r\nfrom its use. I determined not to tell Fritz immediately of the \r\nfortunate discovery I had made, preferring that he should find \r\nthe pleasure out for himself. As he was at some distance on before, \r\nI called out to him to cut a reed for his defence. This he instantly \r\ndid, and, without any remark, used it simply for a stick, striking \r\nlustily with it on all sides to clear a passage. This motion \r\noccasioned the sap to run out abundantly upon his hand, and he \r\nstopped to examine so strange a circumstance. He lifted it up, \r\nand still a larger quantity escaped. He now tasted what was on \r\nhis fingers. Oh! then for the exclamations. Father, father, I \r\nhave found some sugar!—some syrup! I have a sugar-cane in my \r\nhand! Run quickly, father! We were soon together, jointly partaking \r\nof the pleasure we had in store for his dear mother and the younger \r\nbrothers. In the mean time Fritz eagerly devoured the single \r\ncane he had cut, till his relish for it was appeased. I thought \r\nthis a profitable moment to say a word or two about excesses, \r\nof the wisdom of husbanding even our lawful pleasures, and of \r\nthe advantages of moderation in even our most rational enjoyments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Family Congregation]\r\n\r\nBut I was so thirsty, and the sap was so delicious!\r\n\r\nYour excuse is like that of the drunkard, who tells you he drinks \r\nimmoderately because he is thirsty, and because wine has a pleasant \r\nflavour; while, however good the excuse, it does not protect \r\nthe person from being deprived of his reason.\r\n\r\nWell, father, I will observe. But I will take home a good provision \r\nof sugar-canes, however. I shall only just taste of them once \r\nor twice as I walk along. But it will be so delightful to regale \r\nmy mother and my little brothers with them!\r\n\r\nI have not the least objection; but do not take too heavy a load, \r\nfor recollect you have other things to carry, and we have yet \r\nfar to go.\r\n\r\nCounsel was given in vain. He persisted in cutting at least a \r\ndozen of the largest canes, tore off their leaves, tied them \r\ntogether, and, putting them under his arm, dragged them as well \r\nas he was able through thick and thin to the end of the plantation. \r\nWe arrived without accident at the wood of palms, which we entered \r\nin search of a place of shade, where we might stretch our limbs \r\non the ground, and finish our repast. We were scarcely settled, \r\nwhen suddenly a great number of large monkeys, terrified by the \r\nsight of us and the barking of Turk, stole so nimbly, and yet \r\nso quietly, up the trees, that we scarcely perceived them till \r\nthey had reached the topmost parts. From this height they fixed \r\ntheir eyes upon us, grinding their teeth, making most horrible \r\ngrimaces, and saluting us with frightful screams of hostile import. \r\nI observed that the trees were palms, bearing cocoa-nuts, and \r\nI instantly conceived the hope of obtaining some of this fruit \r\nin an unripe and milky state, through the monkeys. Fritz, on \r\nhis part, prepared to shoot at them instantly. He threw his burdens \r\non the ground, and it was with difficulty I could prevent him \r\nfrom firing, by pulling his arm in another direction. What are \r\nyou going to do, said I, in this youthful ardour of yours? What \r\nuse or what pleasure can it be to you to destroy one of these \r\nmonkeys?\r\n\r\nAh, father, why did you not let me kill him? Monkeys are such \r\nmalicious, mischievous animals! Look how they raise their backs \r\nin derision of us!\r\n\r\nAnd is it possible that this can excite your vengeance, my most \r\nreasonable Mr. Fritz? To say the truth, I am not myself a patron \r\nof the race of monkeys, who, as you say, are naturally prone \r\nto be malicious. But as long as an animal does us no injury, \r\nor that his death can in no shape be useful in preserving our \r\nown lives, we have no right to destroy it, and still less to \r\ntorment it for our amusement, or from an insensate desire of \r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nWe could as easily roast a monkey as any kind of game.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the hint! A fine repast you would have provided \r\nus! Thanks to our stars, too, we are each too heavily loaded \r\nto have carried the dead body to our kitchen, and I shrewdly \r\nsuspect that it would not have found the way thither of its own \r\naccord. Does not your large bundle of sugar-canes convince you \r\nthat I speak the truth? But the living monkeys we may perhaps \r\nfind means to make contribute to our service.—See what I am going \r\nto do;—but step aside, for fear of your head. If I succeed, the \r\nmonkeys will furnish us with plenty of our much desired cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nI now began to throw some stones at the monkeys; and though I \r\ncould not make them reach to half of the height at which they \r\nhad taken refuge, they showed every mark of excessive anger. \r\nWith their accustomed habit of imitation, they furiously tore \r\noff, nut by nut, all that grew upon the branches near them, to \r\nhurl them down upon us; so that it was with difficulty we avoided \r\nthe blows; and in a short time a large quantity of cocoa-nuts \r\nlay on the ground round us. Fritz laughed heartily at the excellent \r\nsuccess of our stratagem; and as the shower of cocoa-nuts began \r\nto subside, we set about collecting them. We chose a place where \r\nwe could repose at our ease, to regale ourselves on this rich \r\nharvest. We opened the shells with a hatchet, but not without \r\nhaving first enjoyed the sucking of some of the milk through \r\nthe three small holes, round which we found it easy to insert \r\na knife, and let the milk escape. The milk of the cocoa-nut has \r\nnot in reality a very pleasant flavour; but it is excellent for \r\nquenching violent thirst. What we liked best, was a kind of solid \r\ncream which adheres to the shell, and which we scraped off with \r\nour spoons. We mixed with it a little of the sap of our sugar-canes, \r\nand it made a delicious repast; while Turk obtained for his share, \r\nwhat remained of the sea-lobster, which we now regarded with \r\ndisdain, and to which we added a small quantity of biscuit. All \r\nthis, however, was insufficient to satisfy the hunger of so large \r\nan animal, and he sought about for bits of the sugar-canes and \r\nof the cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nOur meal being finished, we prepared to leave the place. I tied \r\ntogether such of the cocoa-nuts as had retained the stalks, and threw \r\nthem across my shoulder. Fritz resumed his bundle of sugar-canes. \r\nWe divided the rest of the things between us, and continued our \r\nway towards home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. \r\n\r\n_Return from the voyage of discovery. A nocturnal alarm._\r\n\r\nMy poor boy now began to complain heavily of fatigue; the bundle \r\nof sugar-canes galled his shoulders, and he was obliged to move \r\nit from place to place. At last, he stopped to take breath. No, \r\ncried he, I never could have thought that a few sugar-canes could \r\nbe so heavy. How sincerely I pity the poor negroes who carry \r\nthem in even larger quantities, and to a greater distance! I \r\nshould however be so glad, if my mother and my brother could \r\nbut partake of our booty!\r\n\r\nA little patience and a little courage, dear Fritz, replied I, will \r\nenable you to accomplish this wish; recollect Esop’s bread-basket, \r\nwhich at first was so overwhelming a burden, but which at last became \r\nso light. We can cause it to be the same with your sugar-canes, \r\nif we consent to diminish them by sucking a certain number of \r\nthem on the road; as a precedent, you may dispose of one to me, \r\nand I will use it at one moment as a walking-stick, and at another \r\nas a sugarplum. Take you one, also; the rest we will bind together \r\nand put at your back, hanging them upon the barrel of your gun, \r\nby which means you will carry them with ease.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation as ours we must learn to call forth all our \r\nintelligence; reflection and the faculty of invention must be \r\nmade to compensate our want of means.\r\n\r\nWhile we were conversing and proceeding on our way, Fritz perceived \r\nthat from time to time I sucked the end of my sugar-cane, and \r\nhe would needs do the same. It was in vain, however, that he \r\ntried; scarcely a drop of the sap reached his eager lips. What \r\nthen is the reason, said he, that though the cane is full of \r\njuice, I cannot get out a drop?\r\n\r\nThe reason is, answered I, that you make use neither of reflection \r\nnor of your imagination.\r\n\r\nAh! I recollect now, is it not a question about air? Unless there \r\nwere a particular opening in the cane, I may suck in vain, no \r\njuice will come.\r\n\r\nYou have well explained the difficulty: but how will you manage \r\nto set it right?\r\n\r\nFather, lend me your cane an instant.\r\n\r\nNo, no, that will not do; what I wish is, that you should yourself \r\ninvent the remedy.\r\n\r\nLet me see; I imagine that I have only to make a little opening \r\njust above the first knot, and then the air can enter.\r\n\r\nExactly right. But tell me what you think would be the operation \r\nof this opening near the first knot; and in what manner can it \r\nmake the juice get into your mouth?\r\n\r\nThe pith of the cane being completely interrupted by each knot \r\nin its growth, the opening that I might make below, could have \r\nno effect upon the part above; in sucking the juice, I draw in \r\nmy breath, and thus exhaust the air in my mouth; the external \r\nair presses at the same time through the hole I have made, and \r\nfills this void: the juice of the cane forms an obstacle to this \r\neffort, and is accordingly driven into my mouth. But how shall \r\nI manage, when I have sucked this part dry, to get at the part \r\nabove?\r\n\r\nOh, ho! Mr. Philosopher, what should prevent you, who have been \r\nreasoning so well about the force and fluidity of the air, from \r\nimmediately conceiving so simple a process as that of cutting \r\naway the part of the cane you have already sucked dry, and making \r\na second perforation in the part above, so that . . . . . \r\n\r\nOh, I have it, I have it, I understand;—but if we should become \r\ntoo expert in the art of drawing out the juice, I fear but few \r\nof the canes will reach our good friends in the tent.\r\n\r\nI also am not without my apprehensions, that of our acquisition \r\nwe shall carry them only a few sticks for fire-wood; for I must \r\nbring another circumstance to your recollection: the juice of \r\nthe sugar-cane is apt to turn sour soon after cutting, and the \r\nmore certainly in such heat as we now experience; we may suck \r\nthem therefore without compunction, and without regret at the \r\ndiminution of their numbers.\r\n\r\nWell then, if we can do no better with the sugar-canes, at least \r\nI will take them a good provision of the milk of cocoa-nuts, \r\nwhich I have here in a tin bottle; we shall sit round on the \r\ngrass and drink it so deliciously!\r\n\r\nIn this too, my generous boy, I fear, you will also be disappointed. \r\nYou talk of milk; but the milk of the cocoa-nut, no less than \r\nthe juice of the sugar-cane, when exposed to the air and heat, \r\nturns soon to vinegar. I would almost wager that it is already \r\nsour; for the tin bottle which contains it, is particularly liable \r\nto become hot in the sun.\r\n\r\nO heavens, how provoking! I must taste it this very minute. The \r\ntin bottle was lowered from his shoulder in the twinkling of \r\nan eye, and he began to pull the cork with all his strength; \r\nas soon as it was loose, the liquid flew upwards in a brisk stream, \r\nand with a loud noise and frothing like champain.\r\n\r\nBravo, Mr. Fritz! you have manufactured there a wine of some \r\nmettle. I must now caution you not to let it make you tipsy.\r\n\r\nOh, taste it, father, pray taste it; it is quite delicious; not \r\nthe least like vinegar; it is rather like excellent new wine; \r\nits taste is sweet, and it is so sparkling! do take a little, \r\nfather. Is it not good? If all the milk remains in this state, \r\nthe treat will be better even than I thought.\r\n\r\nI wish it may prove so: but I have my fears; its present state \r\nis what is called the first degree of fermentation; the same \r\nthing happens to honey dissolved in water, of which hydromel \r\nis made. When this first fermentation is past, and the liquid \r\nis clear, it is become a sort of wine, or other fermented liquor, the \r\nquality of which depends on the materials used. By the application \r\nof heat, there next results a second and more gradual fermentation, \r\nwhich turns the fluid into vinegar. But this may be prevented \r\nby extraordinary care, and by keeping the vessel that contains \r\nit in a cool place. Lastly, a third fermentation takes place \r\nin the vinegar itself, which entirely changes its character, \r\nand deprives it of its taste, its strength, and its transparency. \r\nIn the intense temperature of this climate, this triple fermentation \r\ncomes on very rapidly, so that it is not improbable that, on \r\nentering our tent, you might find your liquids turned to vinegar, \r\nor even to a thick liquid of ill odour: we may therefore venture \r\nto refresh ourselves with a portion of our booty, that it may \r\nnot all be spoiled. Come then, I drink your health, and that \r\nof our dear family. I find the liquor at present both refreshing \r\nand agreeable; but I am pretty sure that, if we would arrive \r\nsober, we must not venture on frequent libations.\r\n\r\nOur regale imparted to our exhausted frames an increase of strength \r\nand cheerfulness; we pursued our way with briskness, to the place \r\nwhere we had left our gourd utensils upon the sands; we found \r\nthem perfectly dry, as hard as bone, and not the least mis-shapen. \r\nWe now therefore could put them into our game bags conveniently \r\nenough; and this done, we continued our way. Scarcely had we \r\npassed through the little wood in which we breakfasted, when \r\nTurk sprang furiously away to seize upon a troop of monkeys, \r\nwho were skipping about and amusing themselves without observing \r\nour approach toward the place of their merriment. They were thus \r\ntaken by surprise; and before we could get to the spot, our ferocious \r\nTurk had already seized one of them: it was a female monkey who \r\nheld a young one in her arms, which she was caressing almost \r\nto suffocation, and which incumbrance in reality deprived her of \r\nthe power of escaping. The poor creature was killed, and afterwards \r\ndevoured; the young one hid himself in the grass, and looked \r\non grinding his teeth all the time that this horrible achievement \r\nwas performing. Fritz flew like lightning to force the ferocious \r\nTurk from his prey. He lost his hat, threw down his tin bottle, \r\ncanes, and other burdens, but all in vain; he arrived too late \r\nto prevent the murder of the interesting mother.\r\n\r\nThe next scene that presented itself was of a different nature, \r\nand comical enough; it afforded me considerable amusement. The \r\nyoung monkey, on perceiving Fritz, sprang nimbly on his shoulders, \r\nand fastened his feet securely in the stiff curls of his hair; \r\nnor could the squalls of Fritz, nor all the shaking he gave him, \r\nmake him let go his hold. I ran to them, laughing heartily, for \r\nI saw that the animal was too young to be capable of doing him \r\nany injury, while the expression of the panic in the features \r\nof the boy, made the most diverting contrast with the grimaces \r\nof the monkey, whom I in vain endeavoured to disengage. There \r\nis no remedy, Fritz, said I, but to submit quietly and carry \r\nhim; he will furnish an addition to our stock of provisions, \r\nthough less alluring, I must needs confess, than that we could \r\nwish to take to your mother. The conduct of the little animal \r\ndisplays a very surprising intelligence; he has lost his mother, \r\nand he adopts you for his father; perhaps he discovered in you \r\nsomething of the air of a father of a family.\r\n\r\nOr rather the little rogue found out that he had to do with a \r\nchicken-hearted fellow, who shrinks with aversion from the idea \r\nof ill-treating an animal which has thrown itself on his protection. \r\nBut I assure you, father, he is giving me some terrible twitches, \r\nand I shall be obliged to you to try once more to get him off.\r\n\r\nWith a little gentleness and management I found means to succeed. \r\nI took the creature in my arms as one would an infant, and I \r\nconfess I could not help pitying and caressing him. He was not \r\nlarger than a kitten, and quite unable to help himself: its mother \r\nappeared to us to be at least as tall as Fritz.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I do with thee, poor orphan? cried I, and how in our \r\nstate of necessity shall I be able to maintain thee? We have \r\nalready more mouths to fill, than food to put into them, and \r\nour workmen are too young to afford us soon much hope from their \r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nFather, cried Fritz, do let me have this little animal in my \r\nown keeping. I will take the greatest care of him; I will give \r\nhim all my share of the milk of the cocoa-nuts till we get our \r\ncows and goats; and who knows? his monkey instinct may one day \r\nassist us in discovering some different kinds of wholesome fruits.\r\n\r\nI have not the least objection, answered I. You have conducted \r\nyourself throughout this tragi-comic adventure as a lad of courage \r\nand sensibility, and I am well satisfied with every circumstance \r\nof your behaviour. It is therefore but just that the little dependent \r\nshould be given up to your management and discretion; much will \r\ndepend on your manner of educating him; by and by we shall see \r\nwhether he will be fittest to aid us with his intelligence, or \r\nto injure us by his malice; in this last case we shall have nothing \r\nto do but to get rid of him.\r\n\r\nWhile Fritz and I were conversing on the subject of his adoption \r\nof the young monkey, Turk was employed in taking his fill of \r\nthe remains of its unfortunate mother. Fritz would have driven \r\nhim away from so cannibal-like a repast: but besides the difficulty \r\nof restraining him, we had to consider, that we might ourselves \r\nbe in danger from the pressing hunger of so powerful an animal; \r\nall the food we had before given him in the day seeming to be \r\nnothing for his voracious and unbounded appetite.\r\n\r\nWe now again thought of resuming our journey, and accordingly \r\nleft the ferocious Turk to pursue his sanguinary dispositions; \r\nthe little orphan jumped again on the shoulder of his protector, \r\nwhile I on my part relieved my boy of the bundle of canes. Scarcely \r\nhad we proceeded a quarter of a league when Turk overtook us \r\nfull gallop. Fritz and I received him without the usual marks \r\nof kindness, and reproached him with the cruel action he had \r\ncommitted, as if he could feel, and understand us; but he showed \r\nno sign of giving himself any concern about the matter, following \r\nquietly behind Fritz with an air of cool and perfect satisfaction. \r\nThe young monkey appeared uneasy, from seeing him so near, and \r\npassed round and fixed himself on his protector’s bosom, who \r\ndid not long bear with so great an inconvenience without having \r\nrecourse to his invention for a remedy. He tied some string round \r\nTurk’s body in such a way, as to admit of the monkey’s being \r\nfastened on his back with it, and then in a tone really pathetic \r\naddressed the dog as follows: Now, Mr. Turk, since it was you \r\nwho had the cruelty to destroy the mother, it is for you to take \r\nevery care of her child. At first the dog was restive and resisted; \r\nbut by degrees, partly by menaces and partly by caresses, we \r\nsucceeded in gaining his good will, and he quietly consented \r\nto carry the little burden; and the young monkey, who also had made \r\nsome difficulties, at length found himself perfectly accommodated. \r\nFritz put another string round Turk’s neck, by which he might \r\nlead him, a precaution he used to prevent him from going out \r\nof sight. I must needs confess, we had not the sin of too great \r\nhaste to answer for, so that I had sufficient leisure for amusing \r\nmyself with the idea, that we should arrive at our home with \r\nsomething of the appearance of keepers of rare animals for show. \r\nI enjoyed in foresight the jubilations of our young ones when \r\nthey should see the figure we made. Ah! cried Fritz, I promise \r\nyou, brother Jack will draw from the occasion materials enough \r\nfor future malicious jokes. Do you then, my son, said I, take \r\nyour materials for a model from your admirable mother, who never \r\nfails to make allowance for the buoyant spirits so natural to \r\nyouth. Your reflections on their faults, which, thanks be to \r\nheaven, are such as to do injury to none, give me no pleasure; \r\nI am aware of their existence without the aid of your observations, \r\nand I beg you will leave to me the task of correcting them.\r\n\r\nMay I however observe, father, that I wish we could cure Turk \r\nof his passion for attacking living animals, and tearing them \r\nto pieces? It was, I assure you, a most frightful spectacle; \r\nthe more so, that monkeys so much resemble our own species that \r\nI could scarcely convince myself he was not killing a man.\r\n\r\nThere was reason enough to be disgusted with the sight, though \r\nit were only an animal you saw so treated; but, for all this, \r\nit would in our situation be dangerous to teach our dogs not \r\nto attack and kill, if they can, what unknown animals they meet \r\nwith. You will see that Turk will soon regard your little monkey \r\nas a member of our family; already he is content to carry him \r\non his back; but I assure you we must not discourage him in his \r\nfancy for attacking wild beasts. Heaven bestowed the dog on man \r\nfor his safe-guard and defence, and the horse the same: they \r\nmay be considered as our allies against the different tribes \r\nof pernicious animals. How conspicuous is the goodness of the \r\nAlmighty in the natural dispositions he has bestowed on these \r\nuseful creatures, who at all times discover so much affection \r\nfor man, and so easily submit to the slavery of serving him! \r\nA man on horseback, and accompanied by a troop of well conditioned \r\ndogs, has no occasion to fear any species of wild beasts, not \r\neven the lion, nor the hyena; he may even baffle the voracious \r\nrapidity of the tiger.\r\n\r\nI see clearly how fortunate we are in the possession of two such \r\ncreatures, who feel the strongest attachment to our persons and \r\nare ever ready to protect us from danger; but what a pity it \r\nwas that the horses we had on board should have died during our \r\nvoyage, and have left us with only an ass!\r\n\r\nLet us take care how we treat even our ass with disdain. I wish \r\nwe had him safe on land. Fortunately he is a powerful creature \r\nof his species, and not of the common kind. We may train him \r\nto do us the same services as are performed by the horse; and \r\nit is not improbable that he will even improve under our care, \r\nand from the excellent pasture he will find in this climate.\r\n\r\nIn such conversation as this, on subjects equally interesting \r\nto both, we forgot the length of our journey, and soon found \r\nourselves on the bank of the river and near our family before \r\nwe were aware. Ponto on the other side announced our approach \r\nby a violent barking, and Turk replied so heartily, that his \r\nmotions disturbed the tranquillity of his little burden, who, \r\nin his fright, jumped the length of his string from his back \r\nto Fritz’s shoulder, which he could not afterwards be prevailed \r\nupon to leave. Turk, who began to be well acquainted with the \r\ncountry, ran off to meet his companion and announce our arrival; \r\nand shortly after our much-loved family appeared in sight on \r\nthe opposite shore, exhibiting every demonstration of unbounded \r\njoy at our safe return. They advanced along by the course of \r\nthe river, till they on one side, and we on the other, had reached \r\nthe place where we had crossed it in the morning. We re-passed \r\nit again in safety, and threw ourselves into each other’s arms. \r\nScarcely had the young ones joined their brother, than they again \r\nbegan their joyful exclamations: A monkey, a live monkey! Papa, \r\nmamma, a live monkey! Oh, how delightful! how happy shall we \r\nbe! How did you catch him? What a droll face he has! He is very \r\nugly, said little Francis, half afraid to touch him. He is much \r\nprettier than you, retorted Jack; only see, he is laughing; I \r\nwish I could see him eat. Ah! if we had but some cocoa-nut! said \r\nErnest; could you not find any? Are they nice? Have you brought me \r\nany milk of almonds? said Francis. Have you met with any unfortunate \r\nadventure? asked my wife. In this manner, questions and exclamations \r\nsucceeded to each other without interval, and with such rapidity \r\nas not to leave us time to answer them.\r\n\r\nAt length when all became a little tranquil I answered them thus: \r\nMost happy am I to return to you again, my best beloved, and \r\nGod be praised! without having encountered any new misfortune. \r\nWe have even the pleasure of presenting you with many valuable \r\nacquisitions; but in the object nearest my heart, the discovering \r\nwhat has become of our ship-companions, or of any individual \r\nof them, we have entirely failed.\r\n\r\nSince it pleases God that it should be so, said my wife, let \r\nus endeavour to be content, and let us be grateful to him for \r\nhaving saved us from their unhappy fate, and for having once \r\nmore brought us all together: I have laboured this day under \r\nan unusual uneasiness about your safety, and imagined a thousand \r\nevils that might beset you. The day appeared an age. But now \r\nI see you once more safe and well, I trust I shall again resume \r\nmy tranquillity. But put down your burdens; we will all help \r\nyou; for though we have not, I assure you, spent the day in idleness, \r\nwe are less fatigued than you. Quick then, my boys, and help \r\nto take the loads from your father and your brother. Now then \r\nsit down and tell us your adventures.\r\n\r\nJack received my gun, Ernest the cocoa-nuts, Francis the gourd-rinds, \r\nand my wife my game-bag. Fritz distributed the sugar-canes, and \r\nput his monkey on the back of Turk, to the great amusement of \r\nthe children, at the same time begging Ernest to relieve him \r\nof his gun. But Ernest, ever careful of his own accommodation, \r\nassured him, that the large heavy bowls with which he was loaded, \r\nwere the most he had strength to carry. His mother, a little \r\ntoo indulgent to his lazy humour, relieved him of them: and thus \r\nwe proceeded all together to our tent.\r\n\r\nFritz whispered to me, that if Ernest had known what the large \r\nheavy bowls were, he would not so readily have parted with them. \r\nThen turning to his brother, Why, Ernest, cried he, do you know \r\nthat these bowls are cocoa-nuts, your dear much-desired cocoa-nuts, \r\nand each containing the sweet nice milk you have so much wished \r\nto taste?\r\n\r\nAre they indeed? are they really and truly cocoa-nuts, brother? \r\nOh! mamma, return them to me quickly; I will carry them if you \r\nplease, and I can carry the gun too without finding it heavy.\r\n\r\nNo, no, Ernest, answered his mother, I do not intend to be teased \r\nwith hearing any more of your heavy sighs and moanings about \r\nyour being fatigued; for I am certain you would begin again before \r\nwe had gone a hundred paces. Ernest would willingly have asked \r\nhis mother to give him the cocoa-nuts and take the gun herself, \r\nbut this he dared not do:—I have only, said he, to get rid of \r\nthese sticks, and carry the gun in my hand.\r\n\r\nI would advise you not to give up the sticks either, said Fritz \r\ndrily; I know you will be sorry if you do; and for this good \r\nreason—the sticks are sugar-canes!\r\n\r\nSugar-canes! cried he. Sugar-canes! exclaimed they all; and, \r\nsurrounding Fritz, made him give them full instructions on the \r\nsublime art of sucking sugar-canes.\r\n\r\nMy wife also, who had always entertained a high respect for the \r\narticle of sugar in her household management, was perfectly \r\nastonished, and earnestly entreated we would explain to her all about \r\nit. I instantly complied with her request, giving her every \r\nexplanation and particular respecting our journey, and our new \r\nacquisitions, which I alternately exhibited for her inspection. \r\nNo one of them afforded her more pleasure than the plates and \r\ndishes, because to persons of decent habits they were articles \r\nof indispensable necessity. We now adjourned to our little kitchen, \r\nand with great delight observed the preparations going forward \r\nin it for an excellent repast. On one side of the fire we saw \r\na turnspit, which my wife had contrived by driving two forked \r\npieces of wood into the ground, and placing a long even stick \r\nsharpened at one end across them. By this invention she was \r\nenabled to roast different kinds of fish, or other food, with \r\nthe help of little Francis, who was intrusted with the care of \r\nturning it round from time to time. On the occasion of our return \r\nshe had prepared us the treat of a goose, the fat of which ran \r\ndown into some oyster-shells placed there to serve the purpose \r\nof a dripping-pan. And besides a dish of fish, which the little \r\nones had caught, the iron pot was upon the fire, provided with \r\na good soup, the agreeable odour of which increased our appetite. \r\nBy the side of these most exhilarating preparations, stood one \r\nof the casks which we had recovered from the waves, the head \r\nof which my wife had knocked out, so that it exposed to our \r\nview a cargo of the finest sort of Dutch cheeses contained in \r\nround tins. All this display was made to excite the appetite \r\nof the two travellers, who had fared but scantily during the \r\nday; and I must needs observe, that the whole was very little \r\nlike such a dinner as one should expect to see on a desert island.\r\n\r\nYou indeed but barely did yourselves justice, my dear ones, in \r\nsaying that you had not been idle during our absence, cried I. \r\nI see before me what must have cost you considerable labour. \r\nI am however a little sorry that you have killed one of our geese \r\nso soon; we must employ the utmost economy in the use of our \r\npoultry, which may be of service in a time of need.\r\n\r\nDo not make yourself uneasy on this subject, said my wife; for \r\nwhat you see is not one of our geese, but a kind of wild bird, \r\nand is the booty of your son Ernest, who calls him by a singular \r\nname, and assures me that it is good to eat.\r\n\r\nYes, father, I believe that the bird which I have caught is a \r\nkind of penguin, or we might distinguish him by the surname of \r\n_Stupid_. He showed himself to be a bird so destitute, of even \r\nthe least degree of intelligence, that I killed him with a single \r\nblow with my stick.\r\n\r\nWhat is the form of his feet, and of his beak? asked I.\r\n\r\nHis feet were formed for swimming; in other words, he was what \r\nis called web-footed; the beak was long, small, and a little \r\ncurved downwards: I have preserved his head and neck, that you \r\nmight examine it yourself; it reminds me exactly of the penguin, \r\ndescribed as so stupid a bird in my book of natural history.\r\n\r\nYou now then perceive, my son, of what use it is to read, and \r\nto extend our knowledge, particularly on subjects of natural \r\nhistory and the productions of nature in general; by this study \r\nand knowledge, we are enabled to recognise at the moment, the \r\nobjects which chance throws in our way, whether we have seen \r\nthem before or not. Tell me now what birds there are with feet \r\nformed like those which you have just described, and which are \r\nso formed to enable the creature to strike the water and prevent \r\nhimself from sinking.\r\n\r\nThere are the man of war bird, cormorants, and pelicans, father.\r\n\r\nBy what mark do you distinguish the kind to which you just now \r\nsaid the _penguin_ or _Stupid_ belonged?\r\n\r\nUpon my word, interrupted his mother, I must give the answer \r\nmyself: and it will consist of a petition, that you will take \r\nsome other time for your catechism on birds: when once you have \r\nbegun on any particular subject, one never sees the end of it. \r\nNow to my mind there is a time for every thing; Ernest killed \r\nthe bird, and was able to tell his kind; we on our parts shall \r\neat him; what more therefore is necessary? Do you not see that \r\nthe poor child is thinking all the while of his cocoa-nuts? Let \r\nme intercede on his behalf, and prevail upon you to let him have \r\nthe pleasure of examining and tasting them.\r\n\r\nAh! thank you, my good mother; I shall be very glad if papa will \r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Well, well, you have my full permission. But first \r\nyou will be obliged to learn from Fritz the best manner of opening \r\nthem, so as to preserve the milk: and one word more; I recommend \r\nto you not to forget the young monkey, who has no longer his \r\nmother’s milk for food.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I cannot prevail upon him to taste a bit; I have offered \r\nhim every thing we have.\r\n\r\n_Father._—It cannot well be otherwise, for he has not yet learned \r\nhow to eat; you must feed him with the milk of cocoa-nuts till \r\nwe can procure something more proper for him to eat.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I will give the poor little creature my share with all \r\nmy heart.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I have however the greatest desire to taste this milk \r\nmyself, just to know what it is like.\r\n\r\nAnd so have I, said the little Francis.\r\n\r\nHowever, gentlemen, the monkey must live, said Jack a little \r\nmaliciously.\r\n\r\nAnd we and our children must live too, answered their mother. \r\nCome then, the supper is ready, and the cocoa-nuts shall be for \r\nthe dessert.\r\n\r\nWe seated ourselves on the ground; my wife had placed each article \r\nof the repast in one of our newly manufactured dishes, the neat \r\nappearance of which exceeded all our expectations. My sons had \r\nnot patience to wait, but had broken the cocoa-nuts, and already \r\nconvinced themselves of their delicious flavour; and then they \r\nfell to making spoons with the fragments of the shells. The little \r\nmonkey, thanks to the kind temper of Jack, had been served the \r\nfirst, and each amused himself with making him suck the corner \r\nof his pocket-handkerchief, dipped in the milk of the cocoa-nut. \r\nHe appeared delighted with the treatment he received, and we \r\nremarked with satisfaction, that we should most likely be able \r\nto preserve him.\r\n\r\nThe boys were preparing to break some more of the nuts with the \r\nhatchet, after having drawn out the milk through the three little \r\nholes which I have already observed are found near the stalk \r\nof the cocoa-nut, and which are guarded by a soft substance which \r\nmay easily be pierced. I pronounced the word _halt_, and bade \r\nthem bring me a saw; the thought struck me, that by dividing \r\nthe nuts carefully with this instrument, the two halves when \r\nemptied, would remain with the form of some well looking tea-cups \r\nor basons already made to our hands. Jack, who was on every occasion \r\nthe most active, brought me a saw. I performed my undertaking \r\nin the best manner I could, and in a short time each of us was \r\nprovided with a convenient receptacle for food. Accordingly my \r\nwife put the share of soup which belonged to each, into those \r\nbasons or vessels. The excellent creature appeared delighted \r\nthat we should no longer be under the necessity, as before, of \r\nscalding our fingers by dipping into the pot; and I firmly believe, \r\nthat never did the most magnificent service of china occasion \r\nhalf the pleasure to its possessor, as our utensils, manufactured \r\nby our own hands from gourds and cocoa-nuts, excited in the kind \r\nheart of my wife. Fritz asked me if he might not invite our company \r\nto taste his fine champain, which he said would not fail to make \r\nus all the merrier.\r\n\r\nI have not the least objection, answered I, but remember to taste \r\nit yourself, before you serve it to your guests.\r\n\r\nHe ran to draw out the stopple and to taste it . . . . . . . How \r\nunfortunate! said he, it is already turned to vinegar.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? vinegar, did you say? exclaimed my wife. How lucky! \r\nit will make the most delicious sauce for our bird, mixed with \r\nthe fat which has fallen from it in roasting, and will be as \r\ngood a relish as a salad. No sooner said than done. This vinegar \r\nproduced from cocoa-nut proved a most agreeable corrective of \r\nthe wild and fishy flavour of the penguin, and without which \r\nI am afraid we should have found it not very palatable. The same \r\nsauce considerably improved our dish of fish also. Each boasted \r\nmost of what he himself had been the means of procuring; it was \r\nJack and Francis who had caught the fish in one of the shallows, \r\nwhile Ernest was employed with very little trouble to himself \r\nin securing his penguin _the stupid_. My poor wife had herself \r\nperformed the most difficult task of all, that of rolling the \r\ncask of Dutch cheeses into the kitchen, and then knocking out \r\nits head. But if it was she who had most exerted herself, it \r\nwas she also who received the highest commendations; for one \r\nand all agreed, that nothing we had tasted since we left the \r\nship, was half so agreeable to our appetites as this cheese which \r\nshe served for our dessert.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had finished our meal, the sun was retiring from \r\nour view; and recollecting how quickly the night would fall upon \r\nus, we were in the greatest haste to regain our place of rest. \r\nMy wife had considerately procured for us a tenfold quantity of \r\ndry grass, which she had spread in the tent, so that we anticipated \r\nwith joy the prospect which was now afforded, of stretching our limbs \r\non a substance somewhat approaching to the quality of mattresses, \r\nwhile, the night before, our bodies seemed to touch the ground. \r\nOur whole flock of fowls placed themselves as they had done the \r\npreceding evening; we said our prayers, and, with an improved \r\nserenity of mind, lay down in the tent, taking the young monkey \r\nwith us, who was become the little favourite of all. Fritz and \r\nJack contended for a short time which should enjoy the honour \r\nof his company for the night; and it was at last decided that \r\nhe should be laid between them; after which, each would have \r\na hand in covering him carefully, that he might not catch cold. \r\nWe now all lay down upon the grass, in the order of the night \r\nbefore, myself remaining last to fasten the sail-cloth in front \r\nof the tent; when heartily fatigued by the exertions of the day, \r\nI as well as the rest soon fell into a profound and refreshing \r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nBut I had not long enjoyed this pleasing state, when I was awakened \r\nby the motion of the fowls on the ridge of the tent, and by a \r\nviolent barking of our vigilant safeguards, the dogs. I rushed \r\nout instantly; my wife and Fritz, who had also been alarmed by \r\nthe noise, followed my example: we each took a gun, and sallied \r\nforth to their assistance. Shall you, my dearest, have the courage \r\nto fire, if it should be necessary? said I to my wife.\r\n\r\nMost certainly, said she, if, as you say, it should be necessary. \r\nI can depend upon myself for daring to do whatever can be the \r\nmeans of preservation to our dear children. At the same time \r\nit would perhaps be better that I should leave to you the task \r\nof firing, while I can undertake to load your guns, and to hand \r\nthem to you as fast as you may want them.\r\n\r\nBest of all, said I; so let us not lose a moment in examining \r\nwhat enemy it is we have to deal with. Our dogs continued barking \r\nwith the same violence, and at intervals even howled. We had not \r\nproceeded many steps from the tent, when, to our great astonishment, \r\nwe perceived by the light of the moon a terrible combat. At least \r\na dozen of jackalls had surrounded our brave dogs, who defended \r\nthemselves with an almost unexampled courage. Already the fierce \r\nchampions had laid three or four of their adversaries on the \r\nground, while those which remained began to make a timid kind \r\nof noise, as if imploring pity and forbearance. Meanwhile they \r\ndid not the less endeavour to entangle and surprise the dogs, when \r\nthrown off their guard, and thus secure themselves the advantage. \r\nBut our watchful combatants were not so easily to be deceived; \r\nthey took good care not to let the enemy approach them too nearly.\r\n\r\nI, for my part, apprehended something much worse than jackalls. \r\nWe shall soon manage to set these gentlemen at rest, said I. \r\nLet us fire both together, my boy; but let us take care how we \r\naim, for fear of killing the dogs; your mother shall give us \r\nthe word of command; mind how you fire, that you may not miss, \r\nand I shall do the same. We fired, and two of the intruders fell \r\ninstantly dead upon the sands. The others made their escape; \r\nbut we perceived it was with great difficulty, in consequence, \r\nno doubt, of being wounded. Turk and Ponto afterwards pursued \r\nthem, and put the finishing stroke to what we had begun; and \r\nthus the battle ended: but the dogs, true Caribees by nature, \r\nmade a hearty meal on the flesh of their fallen enemies. Their \r\ndoing this was a proof of the keen hunger they experienced; for \r\ndogs do not readily feed on foxes, and the jackall is a more \r\nfierce and mischievous species of the fox, than the animal known \r\nby that name in Europe. My wife, seeing that all was now quiet, \r\nentreated us to lie down again and finish our night’s sleep; \r\nbut Fritz asked my permission to let him first drag the jackall \r\nhe had killed, towards the tent, that he might be able to exhibit \r\nhim the next morning to his brothers. Having obtained my consent, \r\nhe ran to fetch him, and, with great difficulty, succeeded in \r\nhis plan, the animal being of the size of a large dog. I however \r\nobserved to Fritz, that if Turk and Ponto were still hungry, \r\nwe ought to give them this last jackall in addition, as a recompense \r\nfor their courageous behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe had now done with this affair. The body of the jackall was \r\nleft on the rock, by the side of the tent, in which were the \r\nlittle sleepers, who had not once awaked during the whole of \r\nthe scene which had been passing. Having therefore nothing further \r\nto prevent us, we lay down by their side till day began to break, \r\nand till the cocks, with their shrill morning salutation, awoke \r\nus both. The children being still asleep, afforded us an excellent \r\nopportunity to consult together respecting the plan we should \r\npursue for the ensuing day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. \r\n\r\n_Return to the wreck._\r\n\r\nI broke a silence of some moments, with observing to my wife, \r\nthat I could not conquer my alarm at the view of so many cares \r\nand such a variety of exertions to be made! In the first place, \r\na journey to the vessel. This is of absolute necessity; at least, \r\nif we would not be deprived of the cattle and various other useful \r\nthings, all of which from moment to moment we ran the risk of \r\nlosing, by the first approach of a heavy sea. On the other hand, \r\nthere are so many things to think of, and so much exertion is \r\nto be made, for the comfort of all in this desert spot! What \r\nought we to resolve upon? For example,—is it not, above all, \r\nnecessary to contrive a better kind of habitation, and also the \r\nmeans of procuring a more secure retreat from wild beasts, for \r\nourselves, and some separate place of accommodation for our \r\nprovisions? I own I am at a loss what to begin upon first.\r\n\r\nAll will fall into the right order by degrees, observed my wife; \r\npatience and regularity in our plans will go as far as actual \r\nlabour. I cannot, I confess, help shuddering at the thought of \r\nthis voyage to the vessel; but if you judge it to be of absolute \r\nnecessity, it appears to me that it cannot be undertaken too \r\nsoon. In the mean while, nothing that is immediately under my \r\nown care shall stand still, I promise you. Let us not be over \r\nanxious about the morrow; sufficient unto the day is the evil \r\nthereof. These were the words of the great and true friend of \r\nmankind, and let us use so wise a counsel for our own benefit.\r\n\r\nI will follow your advice, said I, and without further loss of \r\ntime. You shall stay here with the three youngest boys; and Fritz, \r\nbeing so much stronger and more intelligent than the others, \r\nshall accompany me in the undertaking.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I started from my bed, crying out loudly and briskly: \r\nGet up, children, get up; it is almost light, and we have some \r\nimportant projects for today; it would be a shame to suffer the \r\nsun to find us still sleeping, we who are to be the founders \r\nof a new colony!\r\n\r\nAt these words Fritz sprang nimbly out of the tent, while his \r\nlittle brothers began to gape and rub their eyes, to get rid \r\nof their sleepiness. Fritz ran to visit his jackall, which during \r\nthe night had become cold and perfectly stiff. He fixed him upon \r\nhis legs, and placed him to look like a sentinel at the entrance \r\nof the tent, joyously expecting the wonder and exclamations of \r\nhis little brothers at so singular and unexpected an appearance. \r\nBut no sooner had the dogs caught a sight of him, than they began \r\na horrible barking, and set themselves in motion to fall upon \r\nhim instantly, thinking he was alive. Fritz had enough to do \r\nto restrain them, and succeeded only by dint of coaxing and \r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, their barking had awaked the younger boys, \r\nand they all ran out of the tent, curious to know what could \r\nbe the occasion. Jack was the first who appeared, with the young \r\nmonkey on his shoulders; but when the little creature perceived \r\nthe jackall, he sprang away in terror, and hid himself at the \r\nfurthest extremity of the grass which composed our bed; with \r\nwhich he covered himself so completely, that scarcely could the \r\ntip of his nose be seen.\r\n\r\nThe children were much surprised at the sight of a yellow-coloured \r\nanimal standing without motion at the entrance of the tent. O \r\nheavens! exclaimed Francis, and stepping back a few paces for \r\nfear; it is a wolf! No, no, said Jack, going near the jackall \r\nand taking one of his paws; it is a yellow dog, and he is dead; \r\nhe does not move at all. It is neither a dog nor a wolf, interrupted \r\nErnest in a consequential tone; do you not see that it is a _golden_ \r\nfox? Best of all, most learned professor! now exclaimed Fritz. \r\nSo you can tell an agouti, when you see him, but you cannot tell \r\na jackall; for jackall is the creature you see before you, and \r\nI killed him myself in the night!\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—In the night, you say, Fritz! In your sleep, I \r\nsuppose . . . . .\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—No, Mr. Ernest; not in my sleep, as you so good-naturedly \r\nsuppose, but broad awake, and on the watch to protect you from \r\nwild beasts! But I cannot wonder at this mistake in one who does \r\nnot know the difference between a jackall and a _golden_ fox!\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—You would not have known it either, if papa had not \r\ntold you . . . . .\r\n\r\nCome, come, my lads, I will have no disputes, said I. Fritz, \r\nyou are to blame in ridiculing your brother for the mistake he \r\nmade. Ernest, you are also to blame for indulging that little \r\npeevishness of yours. But as to the animal, you all are right \r\nand all are wrong; for he partakes at once of the nature of the \r\ndog, the wolf, and the fox; and for his skin, it is really of \r\na golden tint! The boys in an instant became friends; and then \r\nfollowed questions, answers, and wonder in abundance.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my boys, let me remind you, that he who begins the day \r\nwithout first addressing the Almighty, ought to expect neither \r\nsuccess nor safety in his undertakings. Let us therefore acquit \r\nourselves of this duty before we engage in any other occupation. \r\nHaving finished our prayers, the next thing thought of was breakfast; \r\nfor the appetites of young boys open with their eyes. Today their \r\nmother had nothing to give them for their morning meal but some \r\nbiscuit, which was so hard and dry, that it was with difficulty \r\nwe could swallow it. Fritz asked for a piece of cheese to eat \r\nwith it, and Ernest spied about the second cask we had drawn \r\nout of the sea, and which was standing in our kitchen, to discover \r\nwhether, as we had all imagined, it also contained some Dutch \r\ncheeses. In a minute or two he came up to us, joy sparkling in \r\nhis eyes. Papa, said he, if we had but a little butter spread \r\nupon our biscuit, do you not think it would improve it?\r\n\r\nThat indeed it would; but—_if_,—_if_; these never-ending _ifs_ \r\nare but a poor dependence. For my part, I had rather eat a bit \r\nof cheese with my biscuit at once, than think of _ifs_, which \r\nbring us so meagre a harvest.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Perhaps though, the _ifs_ may be found to be worth \r\nsomething, if we were to knock out the head of this cask.\r\n\r\n_Father._—What cask, my boy? and what are you talking of?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I am talking of this cask, which is filled with excellent \r\nsalt butter. I made a little opening in it with a knife; and \r\nsee, I got out enough of it to spread nicely upon this piece \r\nof biscuit.\r\n\r\nThat glutton instinct of yours for once is of some general use, \r\nanswered I; and justice requires that I should also commend, \r\nwith moderation, the excellence of your nose. But now let us \r\nprofit by the event. Who will have some butter on their biscuits? \r\nThe boys surrounded the cask in a moment, while I was in some \r\nperplexity as to the safest and most speedy method of getting \r\nout its contents. Fritz proposed taking off the topmost hoop, \r\nby which means one of the ends could be got out. But this I objected \r\nto, observing, that we should be careful not to loosen the staves, \r\nas the great heat of the sun would not fail to melt the butter, \r\nwhich would run out, and thus be wasted. The idea occurred to \r\nme, that I would make a hole in the bottom of the cask, sufficiently \r\nlarge to take out a small quantity of butter at a time; and I \r\nimmediately set about manufacturing a little wooden shovel, to \r\nuse it for the purpose. All this succeeded vastly well, and we \r\nsat down to breakfast, some biscuits and a cocoa-nut shell full \r\nof salt butter being placed upon the ground, round which we all \r\nassembled, and none of us failing from time to time to wish for \r\na fairy’s wand, to have enabled us to add a little milk from \r\nthe cow, or from some cocoa-nuts, to quench our thirst. We however \r\ntoasted our biscuit, and while it was hot applied the butter, \r\nand contrived, without the fairy’s wand, to make a hearty breakfast.\r\n\r\nOur dogs allowed us to finish our meal in tranquillity. They \r\nwere sleeping by our side; but I did not fail to remark, that \r\ntheir late encounter with the jackalls had not concluded without \r\ntheir receiving several wounds, which I now, for the first time, \r\nobserved in various parts of their body, and principally round \r\ntheir necks. Fearing that the heat might bring on inflammation, \r\nI desired Jack, the valiant, to wash a small quantity of the \r\nbutter thoroughly in fresh water, and then to anoint the wounds \r\nwith it while they continued sleeping. This he effected with \r\nmuch skill and tenderness. The dogs awoke, but did not attempt \r\nthe least resistance, seeming to be sensible of the benefit he \r\nwas conferring on them; they themselves assisted the cure, by \r\nfrequently licking the parts; so that in a few days they were \r\nas well as before.\r\n\r\nOne of the things we must not forget to look for in the vessel, \r\nsaid Fritz, is a spiked collar or two for our dogs, as a protection \r\nto them, should they again be called upon to defend themselves \r\nfrom wild beasts, which I fear it is too probable will be the \r\ncase.\r\n\r\nOh! says Jack, I can make some spiked collars, if mamma will \r\ngive me a little help.\r\n\r\nThat I will most readily, my boy; for I should like to see what \r\nnew fancy has come into your head, cried mamma.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, pursued I, as many new inventions as you please; you \r\ncannot better employ your time; and if you produce something \r\nuseful, you will be rewarded with the honour of our commendations. \r\nBut now we must think of setting ourselves to some occupation. \r\nYou, Mr. Fritz, who, from your superior age and discretion, enjoy \r\nthe high honour of being my privy counsellor, must make haste \r\nand get yourself ready, and we will undertake today our voyage \r\nto the vessel, to save and bring away whatever may be possible. \r\nYou younger boys will remain here, under the wing of your kind \r\nmother; I hope I need not mention that I rely on your perfect \r\nobedience to her will, and general good behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhile Fritz was getting the boat ready, I looked about for a \r\npole, and put a piece of white linen to the end of it; this I \r\ndrove into the ground, in a place where it would be visible from \r\nthe vessel; and I concerted with my wife, that in case of any \r\naccident that should require my immediate presence, they should \r\ntake down the pole and fire a gun three times as a signal of \r\ndistress, in consequence of which I would immediately return. \r\nBut I gave her notice, that there being so many things to accomplish \r\non board the vessel, it was very probable that we should not \r\nbe able to return the same day; in which case I, on my part, \r\nalso promised to make them signals. My wife had the courage and \r\nthe good sense to consent to my plan. Though she was well aware \r\nthat it could not but be dangerous to pass a night alone with \r\nthe children, without my protection, she yet preferred the risk, \r\nto that of my returning late from the vessel. She, however, extorted \r\nfrom me a promise that we should pass the night in our tubs, \r\nand not on board the ship. We took nothing with us but our guns \r\nand a recruit of powder and shot, relying that we should find \r\nplenty of provisions on board; yet I did not refuse to indulge \r\nFritz in the wish he expressed to let him take the young monkey, \r\nhe feeling the most eager impatience to see how the young creature \r\nwould like some milk from the cow or from a goat.\r\n\r\nWe embarked in silence, casting our anxious looks on the beloved \r\nobjects we were quitting. Fritz rowed steadily, and I did my \r\nbest to second his endeavours, by rowing from time to time, on \r\nmy part, with the oar which served me for a rudder. When we had \r\nreached to a considerable distance, I remarked, that beside the \r\nopening by which we had the first time made land, there was another \r\nthat formed the mouth of the river, running not far from that \r\nspot, and the current of which was visible a good way into the \r\nsea.\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of this current, and to husband our strength \r\nby means of it, was my first thought and my first care. Little \r\nas I knew of the management of sea affairs, I however succeeded \r\nin keeping our boat in the direction in which it ran, by which \r\nmeans we were drawn gently on, till it had conducted us to within \r\na short distance of the vessel, without our having any other \r\ntrouble than that of keeping in the same line: at length, in \r\nconsequence of the gradual diminution of its force, we were again \r\nobliged to have recourse to our oars; but our arms having now \r\nrested for some time, we were ready for new exertions. A little \r\nafterwards we found ourselves safely arrived at the cleft of \r\nthe vessel, and fastened our boat securely to one of its timbers.\r\n\r\nScarcely had we got out of the boat than Fritz proceeded with \r\nhis young monkey on his arm to the main deck, where he found \r\nall the animals we had left on board assembled. I followed him \r\nwith great readiness, well pleased to observe the generous impatience \r\nhe betrayed, to relieve the wants of the poor abandoned creatures, \r\nwho, one and all, now saluted us by the cry or the sounds natural \r\nto its species! It was not so much the want of food, as the desire \r\nof seeing once more their accustomed human companions, which \r\noccasioned them to manifest their joy in this manner, for they had \r\na portion of the food and water we had left them, still remaining. \r\nThe first thing we did was to put the young monkey to one of \r\nthe goats, that he might suck; and this he did with such evident \r\npleasure, and such odd grimaces, that he afforded us much amusement.\r\n—We next examined the food and water of the other animals, taking \r\naway what was half spoiled, and adding a fresh supply, that no \r\nanxiety on their account might afterwards interrupt our enterprise. \r\nNor did we neglect the care of renewing our own strength by a \r\nplentiful repast.\r\n\r\nWhile we were seated, and appeasing the calls of hunger, Fritz \r\nand I consulted what should be our first occupation; when, to \r\nmy great surprise, the advice he gave was, that we should immediately \r\ncontrive a sail for our boat. In the name of Heaven, cried I, \r\nwhat makes you think of such a thing at so critical a moment, \r\nand when we have so many other things of indispensable necessity \r\nto arrange? We will think of a sail when we have leisure, with \r\nall my heart, for it is an affair which will take a considerable \r\ntime to accomplish. In reality, I experienced great uneasiness \r\nat the thought of passing the night at a distance from my family.\r\n\r\nAll you say is very true, father, said Fritz; but let me confess \r\nthe truth, which is, that I found it very difficult to perform \r\nthe task of rowing for so long a time, though I assure you I \r\ndid my best, and did not spare my strength. I observed that, \r\nthough the wind blew strong in my face, the current nevertheless \r\ncarried us on. Now, as we cannot be benefited on our return by \r\nthe current, I was thinking that we might make the wind supply \r\nits place. Our boat will be very heavy when we have loaded it \r\nwith all the useful things we mean to take away, and I am afraid \r\nI shall not be strong enough to row to land. Now do you not think \r\nthat a sail would be of great assistance?\r\n\r\nAh ha, Mr. Fritz! So you wish to spare yourself a little trouble, \r\ndo you? But to speak seriously, I perceive a great deal of good \r\nsense in your argument, and think myself much obliged to my privy \r\ncounsellor for his good advice. The best thing we can do is, \r\nto take care and not overload the boat, and thus avoid the danger of \r\nsinking, or of being obliged to throw some of our stores over-board. \r\nCome then, let us set to work upon your sail, which, if it saves \r\nyour labour in rowing, will be at least a little troublesome \r\nat present. Come along, and let us look about for what we want.\r\n\r\nI assisted Fritz to carry a pole strong enough to serve for a \r\nmast, and another not so thick for a sail-yard. I directed him \r\nto make a hole in a plank with a chisel, large enough for the \r\nmast to stand upright in it.\r\n\r\nI then went to the sail-chamber, and cut off from an ample piece \r\nof sail-cloth enough to make a triangular sail: in the edges \r\nI made holes, and passed cords through them. I then sought for \r\na pulley, that I might fasten it to the top of the mast, and \r\nthus be enabled to raise and lower my sail at pleasure. Thus \r\nprepared, I hastened to join Fritz, who was earnestly working \r\nat the mast. As soon as he had done, we placed the plank that \r\nhe had perforated, upon the fourth of our tubs, and made it fast. \r\nThe pulley was suspended from a ring at the top of the mast, \r\nand the cord, attached to the sharpest angle of the sail, was \r\npassed through it. The sail formed a right-angle triangle, one \r\nside of which touched the mast, and was fastened to it. The shortest \r\nside was also fastened with cords to a pole, stretching from \r\nthe mast beyond the circumference of our bark, and of which one \r\nend was fastened to the mast, and the other, by means of a cord, \r\nto the helm, in such a manner that I could, from my position, \r\neither weather the sail, or let it go altogether. In the foremost \r\nand hindmost bench of our little bark, we made holes with a piercer, \r\nand passed cords through them, by means of which we could pass \r\nthe sail from the right to the left side of us, and back again, \r\nwithout being obliged to turn the boat entirely round. \r\n\r\nWhile I was thus occupied, Fritz had been taking observations \r\nthrough a telescope of what was passing on land, and which we \r\nhad already done several times. He imparted the agreeable tidings \r\nthat all was still well with our dear family. He had distinguished \r\nhis mother walking tranquilly along the shore. He soon after \r\nbrought me a small streamer, which he had cut from a piece of \r\nlinen, and which he entreated me to tie to the extremity of the \r\nmast, and he appeared as much delighted with the streamer as \r\nwith the sail itself. He gave to our machine the name of _The \r\nDeliverance_; and in speaking of it, instead of calling it a \r\n_boat_, it was now always denominated _the little vessel_. I \r\ncould not withhold a smile at vanity like this, in such a situation \r\nas ours; it gave me too an opportunity of observing the operation \r\nof this prominent feature of human nature, in a lad of fourteen \r\nyears of age. I myself took great pleasure in seeing the little \r\nstreamer floating in the air, and in the respectable appearance \r\nof our machine altogether.\r\n\r\nBut now, father, said Fritz, looking kindly on me as he spoke, \r\nas you have eased me of the labour of rowing, it is my turn to \r\ntake care of you. I am thinking about making you a better-contrived \r\nrudder; one that would enable you to steer the boat both with \r\ngreater ease and greater safety. Your thought would be a very \r\ngood one, said I, but that I am unwilling to lose the advantage \r\nof being able to proceed this way and that, without being obliged \r\nto veer. I shall therefore fix our oars in such a manner as to \r\nenable me to steer the raft from either end. Accordingly, I fixed \r\nbits of wood to the stem and stern of the vessel, in the nature \r\nof grooves, which were calculated to spare us a great deal of \r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nDuring these exertions the day became far advanced, and I perceived \r\nthat we should be obliged to pass the night in our tubs, not \r\nhaving as yet entered upon our task of emptying the vessel. We \r\nhad promised our family to hoist a flag as a signal of our intention \r\nto pass the night from home, and we decided that our streamer \r\nwas precisely the thing we wanted for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWe employed the rest of the day in emptying the tubs of the useless \r\nballast of stone, and putting in their place what would be of \r\nservice, such as nails, pieces of cloth, and different kinds \r\nof utensils, &c. &c. The Vandals themselves could not have made \r\na more complete pillage than we had done. The prospect we seemed \r\nto have of an entire solitude, made us devote our principal attention \r\nto the securing as much powder and shot as might fall in our \r\nway, that we might thus secure the means of catching animals \r\nfor food, and of defending ourselves against wild beasts to the \r\nlatest moment possible. Utensils also for every kind of workmanship, \r\nof which there was a large provision in the ship, were also objects \r\nof incalculable value to us. The vessel, which was now a wreck, \r\nhad been sent out as a preparation for the establishment of a \r\ncolony in the South Seas, and for that reason had been provided \r\nwith a variety of stores not commonly included in the loading \r\nof a ship. Among the rest, care had been taken to have on board \r\nconsiderable numbers of European cattle; but so long a voyage \r\nhad proved unfavourable to the oxen and the horses, the greatest \r\npart of which had died, and the others were in so bad a condition \r\nthat it had been found necessary to destroy them. The quantity \r\nof useful things which presented themselves in the store-chambers, \r\nmade it difficult for me to select among them, and I much regretted \r\nthat circumstances compelled me to leave some of them behind. \r\nFritz, however, already meditated a second visit; but we took \r\ngood care not to lose the present occasion for securing knives \r\nand forks and spoons, and a complete assortment of kitchen utensils. \r\nIn the captain’s cabin we found some services of silver, dishes \r\nand plates of high-wrought metal, and a little chest filled with \r\nbottles of all sorts of excellent wine. Each of these articles \r\nwe put into our boat. We next descended to the kitchen, which \r\nwe stripped of gridirons, kettles, pots of all kinds, a small \r\nroasting-jack, &c. Our last prize was a chest of choice eatables, \r\nintended for the table of the officers, containing Westphalia \r\nhams, Bologna sausages, and other savoury food. I took good care \r\nnot to forget some little sacks of maize, of wheat, and other \r\ngrain, and some potatoes. We next added such implements for husbandry \r\nas we could find;—shovels, hoes, spades, rakes, harrows, &c. \r\n&c. Fritz reminded me that we had found sleeping on the ground \r\nboth cold and hard, and prevailed upon me to increase our cargo \r\nby some hammocks, and a certain number of blankets: and as guns \r\nhad hitherto been the source of his pleasures, he added such \r\nas he could find of a particular costliness or structure, together \r\nwith some sabres and clasp knives. The last articles we took, \r\nwere a barrel of sulphur, a quantity of ropes, some small string, \r\nand a large roll of sail-cloth. The vessel appeared to us to \r\nbe in so wretched a condition, that the coming on of the least \r\ntempest must make her go to pieces.\r\n\r\nIt was then quite uncertain whether we should be able to approach \r\nher any more.\r\n\r\nOur cargo was so considerable, that the tubs were filled to the \r\nvery brim, and no inch of the boat’s room was lost. The first \r\nand last of the tubs were reserved for Fritz and me to seat ourselves \r\nin and row the boat, which sunk so low in the water, that, if \r\nthe sea had been otherwise than quite calm, we should have been \r\nobliged to ease her of some of the loading: we, however, used \r\nthe precaution of putting on our swimming-jackets, for fear of \r\nany misfortune.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be imagined that every moment of the day had been \r\nlaboriously employed. Night suddenly surprised us, and it was \r\nno longer possible to form a hope of returning to our family \r\nthe same evening. A large blazing fire on the shore soon after \r\ngreeted our sight,—the signal we had agreed upon for assuring \r\nus that all was well, and to bid us close our eyes in peace. \r\nWe returned the compliment by tying four lanterns with lights \r\nin them to our mast-head. This was answered on their part, according \r\nto agreement, by the firing of two guns; so that both parties \r\nhad reason to be satisfied and easy.\r\n\r\nAfter offering up our earnest prayers for the safety and happiness \r\nof all, yet not without some apprehension for the night, we resigned \r\nourselves to sleep in our tubs, which, it must be confessed, \r\ndid not afford us a very enviable place of rest: they were, however, \r\nsafer than the vessel, and more convenient for guarding our heavily \r\nloaded machine. At the least cracking of the vessel, we might \r\ncut the rope in an instant, and get out to sea. Our night, thank \r\nGod, passed tranquilly enough: my boy Fritz slept as soundly \r\nas if he had been in a bed; while I, notwithstanding my fatigue, \r\ncould neither close my eyes, nor keep them from the direction \r\nof the shore, perpetually haunted by the recollection of the \r\nnocturnal visit of the jackalls, some of whose race I feared \r\nmight come and enter the tent. I had, however, great reliance \r\nthat my valiant dogs would do their duty, and was thankful to \r\nHeaven for having enabled us to preserve so good a protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. \r\n\r\n_A troop of animals in cork jackets._\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, though it was scarcely light enough to \r\ndistinguish the coast, I was already on the deck of the vessel, \r\nendeavouring to have a sight of the beloved inhabitants of the tent \r\nthrough a spying-glass. Fritz speedily prepared a good substantial \r\nbreakfast of biscuit and ham; but before we sat down to this \r\nrefreshment, we recollected that in the captain’s cabin we had \r\nseen a telescope of a much superior size and power, and we hastily \r\nconveyed it upon the deck. While this was doing, the brightness \r\nof the day had succeeded to the imperfect light of an earlier \r\nhour. I eagerly fixed my eye to the glass, and discovered my \r\nwife coming out of the tent and looking attentively towards the \r\nvessel, and we at the same moment perceived the motion of the \r\nflag upon the shore. A load of care and solicitude was thus taken \r\nfrom my heart; for now I had obtained the certainty that the \r\nbeloved beings I had left were all in good health, and had escaped \r\nthe dangers of the night. Fritz, said I to my boy, I thought \r\nthis morning that it would be impossible for me to remain another \r\nmoment on board the vessel, without returning to see what was \r\npassing in the island; but now that I have had a sight of your \r\nmother, and an assurance of their being well and safe, my compassion \r\nis awakened for the poor creatures on board, who are in so wretched \r\na condition, and every hour in danger of destruction: a great \r\nobject of my anxiety now, is to endeavour to save the lives of \r\nsome of them at least, and to take them with us to the shore.\r\n\r\nWould it be impossible to construct a raft, to get them all upon \r\nit, and in this way afford them a conveyance? said Fritz.\r\n\r\nBut recollect, my boy, what a difficulty we should find in completing \r\nsuch a raft, and that a greater still would be to induce a cow, \r\nan ass, and a sow, either to get upon a raft, or, when there, \r\nto remain motionless and quiet. The sheep and goats one might \r\nperhaps find means to remove, they being of a more accommodating \r\ntemper; but for the larger animals, I am quite at a loss how \r\nto proceed. Do you consider of it, and tell me what thoughts \r\noccur to your young and active imagination.\r\n\r\nMy advice, father, is, to tie a long rope round the sow’s neck, \r\nand throw her without ceremony into the sea: her immense weight \r\nwill be sure to sustain her above water; and we can easily get \r\nhold of the other end of the rope and draw her after the boat.\r\n\r\nYour idea is excellent, my boy: but unfortunately it cannot be \r\napplied to any of the animals except the pig; and I confess, \r\nshe is the one I care the least about preserving.\r\n\r\nThen here is another idea, father: let us tie a swimming-jacket \r\nround the body of each animal, and contrive to throw them into \r\nthe water; you will see that they will swim like fish, and we \r\ncan draw them after us in the same manner.\r\n\r\nRight, very right, my boy; your invention is admirable: let us \r\ntherefore not lose a moment in making the experiment.\r\n\r\nWe accordingly hastened to the execution of our design: we fixed \r\non a jacket to one of the lambs, and threw it into the sea; and \r\nfull of fear, of hope, and anxious curiosity, I followed the \r\npoor animal with my eyes. He sunk at first under water, and I \r\nthought he was drowned; but he soon re-appeared, shaking the \r\nwater from his head, and in a few seconds we perceived that he \r\nhad learned completely the art of swimming. After another interval, \r\nwe observed that he appeared fatigued, gave up his efforts, and \r\nsuffered himself without resistance to be borne along by the \r\ncourse of the water, which conducted and sustained him to our \r\ncomplete satisfaction. Victory! exclaimed I, hugging my boy with \r\ndelight: these useful animals are all our own; let us not lose \r\na moment in adopting the same measures with those that remain, \r\nbut take care not to lose our little lamb. Fritz now would have \r\njumped eagerly into the water to follow the poor creature, who \r\nwas still floating safely on the surface; but I stopped him till \r\nI had seen him tie on one of the swimming-jackets, and then I \r\nsuffered him to go. He took with him a rope, first making a slip \r\nknot in it, and, soon overtaking the lamb, threw it round his \r\nneck, and thus drew him to our boat; and then, to his great content, \r\ndrew him out of the water.\r\n\r\nWe then went and looked out four small casks, such as had been \r\nused for keeping the fresh water for the vessel. I first emptied \r\nthem of their contents, and then carefully closed them again; \r\nnext I bound them together with a large piece of sail-cloth, \r\nthe two ends of which I nailed to each. I strengthened this with \r\na second piece of sail-cloth, and this machine I destined to \r\nsupport the cow and the ass, two casks to each, the animal being \r\nplaced in the middle with a cask on either side. The weight of \r\nthe animal pressed down the sail-cloth, and would have brought \r\nthe casks into close contact on each side, but that I took care \r\nto insert a wisp of hay or straw, to prevent injurious friction \r\nor pressure. I added a thong of leather, stretching from the \r\ncasks across the breast and haunches of the animal, to make the \r\nwhole secure; and thus, in less than an hour, both my cow and \r\nmy ass were equipped for swimming.\r\n\r\nIt was next the turn of the smaller animals: of these, it was \r\nthe sow who gave us the most trouble; we were first obliged to \r\nput her on a muzzle to prevent her biting; and this being done, \r\nwe tied a large piece of cork under her body. The sheep and goats \r\nwere more docile, and we had soon accoutred them for the expedition. \r\nAnd now we had succeeded in assembling our whole company on the \r\ndeck, in readiness for the voyage: we tied a cord to either the \r\nhorns or the neck of each animal, and to the other end of the \r\ncord a piece of wood similar to the mode used for marking nets, \r\nthat it might be easy for us to take hold of the ropes, and so \r\ndraw the animal to us if it should be necessary. We struck away \r\nsome more of the shattered pieces of wood from the side of the \r\nvessel, which only served to encumber the cleft by which we had \r\nentered, and were again to pass to put out to sea, when we should \r\nhave completed our last work of throwing the animals into it. \r\nWe began our experiment with the ass, by conducting him as near \r\nas possible to the brink of the vessel, and then suddenly shoving \r\nhim off. He fell into the water, and for a moment disappeared; \r\nbut we soon saw him rise, and in the action of swimming between \r\nhis two barrels, with a grace which really merited our commendation. \r\n\r\nNext came the cow’s turn; and as she was infinitely more valuable \r\nthan the ass, my fears increased in due proportion. The ass had \r\nswum so courageously, that he was already at a considerable distance \r\nfrom the vessel, so that there was sufficient room for our experiment \r\non the cow. We had more difficulty in pushing her overboard, \r\nbut she reached the water in as much safety as the ass had done \r\nbefore; she did not sink so low in it, and was no less perfectly \r\nsustained by the empty barrels; and she made her way on the surface \r\nwith gravity, and, if I may so express it, a sort of dignified \r\ncomposure. According to this method we proceeded with our whole \r\ntroop, throwing them one by one into the water, where by and \r\nby they appeared in a group floating at their ease, and seemingly \r\nwell content, at a short distance from the vessel. The sow was the \r\nonly exception; she became quite furious, set up a loud squalling, \r\nand struggled with so much violence in the water, that she was \r\ncarried to a considerable distance, but fortunately in a direction \r\ntowards the landing-place we had in view for ourselves. We had now \r\nnot a moment to lose; our last act was to put on our cork-jackets; \r\nand then we descended without accident through the cleft, took \r\nour station in the boat, and were soon out to sea, surrounded \r\nby our troop of quadrupeds. We carefully took up from the water, \r\neach of the floating bits of wood which we had fastened to the \r\nropes round the animals, and thus drew them all after us by fastening \r\nthe bits of timber to the boat. When every thing was adjusted, \r\nand our company in order, we hoisted our sail, which soon filling \r\nwith a favourable wind conducted us and our escort safe to the \r\nland.\r\n\r\nWe now perceived how impossible it would have been for us to \r\nhave executed our enterprise without the assistance of the sail; \r\nfor the weight of so many animals sunk the boat so low in the \r\nwater, that all our exertions to row to such a distance would have \r\nbeen ineffectual; while by means of the sail, and the improvement \r\nI had invented for the steering, she proceeded completely to \r\nour satisfaction, bearing in her train our suite of animals; \r\nwhich produced altogether the most singular effect. Proud of \r\nthe success of so extraordinary an enterprise, we were in high \r\nspirits, and seated ourselves in the tubs, where we made an excellent \r\ndinner. Fritz amused himself with the monkey, while I was wholly \r\noccupied in thinking of those I had left on land, and of whom \r\nI now tried to take a view through my telescope. My last act \r\non board the vessel had been to take one look more at them, and \r\nI perceived my wife and the three boys all in motion, and seeming \r\nto be setting out on some excursion; but it was in vain that \r\nI endeavoured, by any thing I saw, to conjecture what their plan \r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nI therefore seized the first moment of quiet to make another \r\ntrial with my glass, when a sudden exclamation from Fritz filled \r\nme with alarm. O heavens! cried he, we are lost! a fish of an \r\nenormous size is coming up to the boat. And why lost? said I \r\nhalf angry, yet half partaking of his fright. Be ready with your \r\ngun in an instant, and the moment he is close upon us, let us \r\nboth fire upon him at the same instant. Our guns were each loaded \r\nwith two balls, and we got up from our tubs to give the intruder \r\na hearty reception. He had nearly reached the boat, and with \r\nthe rapidity of lightning had seized the foremost sheep: at this \r\ninstant Fritz aimed his fire so skilfully, that the balls were \r\nlodged in the head of the monster, which was an enormous shark. \r\nThe fish half turned himself round in the water and hurried off \r\nto sea, leaving us to observe the lustrous smoothness of his \r\nbelly, and that as he proceeded, he stained the water red, which \r\nconvinced us he had been severely wounded. I determined to have \r\nthe best of our guns at hand the rest of the way, lest we should \r\nbe again attacked by the same fish, or another of his species.\r\n\r\nFritz had great reason to be proud of the achievement of having \r\nforced the shark to retreat; whilst I on my part rather felt \r\nsurprise; for I had always understood that this kind of sea-monster \r\nwas not easily to be frightened from his purpose, and also that \r\nthe heaviest load of shot was rarely known to do him any injury, \r\nthe creature being extremely voracious of his prey, and his skin \r\nso hard, as to present an extraordinary degree of resistance \r\nto all attempts of this kind. For this time, however, the animal \r\nleft us in tranquillity; I resumed the rudder; and as the wind \r\ndrove us straight towards the bay, I took down the sail, and \r\ncontinued rowing till we reached a convenient spot for our cattle \r\nto land. I then untied the end of the cords, which had been fastened \r\nto the boat, and they stepped contentedly on shore. Our voyage \r\nthus happily concluded, we followed their example.\r\n\r\nI had already been surprised and uneasy at finding none of my \r\nfamily looking out for us on the shore, and was at a loss to \r\nconjecture in what they could be occupied to prevent them: we could \r\nnot, however, set out in search of them, till we had disencumbered \r\nour animals of their swimming apparatus. Scarcely had we entered upon \r\nthis employment, when I was agreeably relieved by the exclamations \r\nand joyful sounds which reached our ears, and filled our hearts \r\nwith rapture. It was my wife and the youngest boys who uttered \r\nthem, the latter of whom were soon close up to us, and their \r\nmother followed not many steps behind; each and all of them in \r\nexcellent health, and eager for our salutations. When the first \r\nburst of happiness at meeting had subsided, we all sat down on \r\nthe grass, and I began to give them an account of our occupations \r\nin the vessel, of our voyage, and of all our different plans, \r\nand their success, in the order in which they occurred. My wife \r\ncould find no words to express her surprise and satisfaction at \r\nseeing so many useful animals round us, and her language respecting \r\nthem had such a vein of affectionate simplicity, as greatly to \r\nincrease the gratification it could not otherwise but inspire. \r\nI had been ransacking my poor brains, said she, every moment \r\nof your absence, to conceive some means by which you might succeed \r\nin protecting the poor animals; but I could fix on none that \r\nseemed to promise the least success.\r\n\r\nYes, said Fritz a little consequentially, for this once the \r\nprivy-counsellor has tried his talents at invention.\r\n\r\nThis indeed is very true, replied I; in all humility have I to \r\nconfess, that to Fritz alone all praise belongs, and that to \r\nhis sagacity it is, that we are indebted for our success. His \r\nmother could not refrain from giving him a hearty kiss. Our gratitude \r\nis due to both, said she; for both have laboured to give us the \r\npossession of this troop of animals, an acquisition beyond any \r\nother, agreeable and serviceable to us, in the situation in which \r\nit has pleased Providence to place us.\r\n\r\nHa ha! cried little Francis, what is that I see in your boat? \r\nLook, mamma, there is a sail and a new flag floating about in \r\nthe air. How pretty they are! I like the sail and the flag much \r\nbetter than the ass and the cow.\r\n\r\nLittle blockhead! said his mother, you will change your mind \r\nwhen I give you every morning a cocoa-nut full of delicious milk.\r\n\r\nErnest and Jack now ran also to the boat, and bestowed no less \r\nadmiration than Francis had done upon the mast, the sail, and \r\nthe flag, desiring their brother to explain to them how all the \r\nthings they saw had been effected, and what he had himself done \r\ntowards them. In the mean time we began to unpack our cargo, \r\nwhich was by no means a trifling undertaking; while Jack, who \r\nhad no fancy for the occupation, stole aside and amused himself \r\nwith the animals, took off the jackets from the sheep and goats, \r\nbursting from time to time into shouts of laughter at the ridiculous \r\nfigure of the ass, who stood before them adorned with his two \r\ncasks and his swimming apparatus, and braying loud enough to \r\nmake us deaf. Jack tried a long time to disengage the ass from \r\nhis incumbrances, but constantly found difficulties he knew not \r\nhow to overcome; till at last, tired out with so many fruitless \r\nendeavours, and longing to be in some way a more effectual actor \r\nin the scene, he got upon the ass’s back between the casks, and \r\nkicked and stirred so violently against his sides, that he at \r\nlast succeeded in causing the animal to advance to the place \r\nwhere we were all assembled.\r\n\r\nWe were much amused, and laughed heartily at the sight of so \r\nsingular an equipage; when, as I was assisting him to get down \r\nfrom the ass’s back, I perceived, with surprise, that he had \r\nround his waist a belt of metal covered with yellow skin, in \r\nwhich were fixed a pair of pistols.\r\n\r\nIn the name of Heaven! exclaimed I, where did you procure this \r\ncurious costume, which gives you the look of a smuggler?\r\n\r\nFrom my own manufactory, replied he; and if you cast your eyes \r\nupon the dogs, you will see more of my specimens.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I looked at them, and perceived that each had on \r\na collar similar to the belt round Jack’s waist, with, however, \r\nthe exception of the collars being armed with a number of nails, \r\nthe points of which were outwards, and exhibited a most formidable \r\nappearance. And is it you, Mr. Jack, cried I, who have invented \r\nand executed these collars and your belt?\r\n\r\nYes, papa, they are indeed my invention, with a little of mamma’s \r\nassistance wherever it was necessary to use the needle.\r\n\r\nBut where did you get the leather and the thread and the needle?\r\n\r\nFritz’s jackall furnished the first, answered my wife; and as \r\nto the last, a good mother of a family is always provided with \r\nthem. You men think only of more serious concerns, while those \r\nof less importance fall to the care of a wife, and are frequently \r\nmore useful. Then have I not an enchanted bag, from which I draw \r\nout such articles as I stand in need of? So, if you have a particular \r\nfancy for any thing, you have only to acquaint me with it. I \r\ntenderly embraced my wife, to express my thanks for this effort \r\nto amuse by so agreeable a raillery, and Jack too came in for \r\nhis share, both of the caresses and our most hearty commendations. \r\nBut Fritz was somewhat angry and discontented on finding that \r\nJack had taken upon him to dispose of his jackall, and to cut \r\nhis beautiful skin into slices. He, however, concealed his ill-humour \r\nas well as he could; but, as he stood quite near to his brother, \r\nhe called out suddenly, holding his nose as he spoke: What a \r\nfilthy smell! it is enough to give me the plague! Does it perchance \r\nproceed from you, Mr. Currier? Is this the perfume we may expect \r\nfrom your manufactory? It is rather yours than mine, replied \r\nJack in a resentful tone; for it was your jackall which you hung \r\nup in the sun to dry.\r\n\r\nAnd which would have been dried in a whole skin, if it had not \r\npleased your sublime fancy to cut it to pieces, instead of leaving \r\nme the power to do what I pleased with my own booty.\r\n\r\nSon Fritz, said I in a somewhat angry tone, this is not generous \r\non your part. Of what importance is it, whether it was your brother \r\nor yourself who cut up the skin of the jackall, if by so doing \r\nit has contributed to our use? My dear children, we are here \r\nin this desert island, in just such a situation as that of our \r\nfirst parents when they were driven out of the garden of Eden; \r\nit was still in their power to enjoy happiness in the fertile \r\nland in which God permitted them to live; and this happiness \r\nwas to proceed from their obedience, from the work of their hands, \r\nand the sweat of their brow: a thousand and a thousand blessings \r\nwere granted for their use, but they suffered the passions of \r\njealousy, envy, and hatred to take root in their bosoms; Cain \r\nkilled his brother Abel, and thus plunged his unhappy parents \r\ninto the deepest affliction, so that he and his race were cursed \r\nby God. This is the horrid crime to which the habit of disputing \r\nmay conduct. Let us then avoid such an evil, let us share one \r\nwith the other in every benefit bestowed upon us, and from this \r\nmoment may the words _yours_ and _mine_ be banished from our \r\nhappy circle! What is discovered or procured by one of you, should \r\nbe equally for the service of all, and belong to all, without \r\ndistinction. It is quite certain, Jack, that the belt round your \r\nwaist, not being dry, has an offensive smell; the pleasure of \r\nwearing what you had ingeniously contrived, makes you willing \r\nto bear with the inconvenience: but we should never make our \r\nown pleasure the pain of another. I therefore desire that you \r\nwill take it off and place it in the sun to dry, and take care \r\nthat it does not shrink during the operation; and then you can \r\njoin your brothers, and assist them to throw the jackall into \r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nFritz’s ill-humour was already over; but Jack, whose temper was \r\nless docile, persisted in keeping on the belt, assuming an air \r\nof importance, which was meant to express that he was not disposed \r\nto yield. His brothers, however, continued their warfare, by \r\npretending to avoid him, and crying out—What a smell! What a \r\nsmell! till at length Jack, tired with the part he had been acting, \r\nsuddenly stripped off the belt, and ran to assist his brothers in \r\ndragging the dead jackall to the sea, where he no longer occasioned \r\nus any inconvenience.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that no preparations were making for supper, I ordered \r\nFritz to bring us the Westphalia ham, for that I was hungry. \r\nThe eyes of all were now fixed upon me with astonishment; for \r\nevery one believed that I could only be in jest; when Fritz returned, \r\njumping and displaying with exultation a large and excellent \r\nham, which we had begun to cut in the morning. A ham! cried one \r\nand all; a ham! and ready drest! What a nice supper we shall \r\nhave! said they, clapping their hands, to give a hearty welcome \r\nto the bearer of so fine a treat.—It comes quite in the nick \r\nof time too, interrupted I; for, to judge by appearances, a certain \r\ncareful steward I could name, seems to have intended to send \r\nus supperless to bed, little thinking, I suppose, that a long \r\nvoyage by water is apt to increase the appetite.\r\n\r\nI will tell you presently, replied my wife, what it was that \r\nprevented me from providing a supper for you all at an earlier \r\nhour: your ham, however, makes you ample amends; and I have something \r\nin my hand with which I shall make a pretty side dish; in the \r\ntwinkling of an eye you shall see it make its entrance. She now \r\nshowed us about a dozen of turtle’s eggs, and then hurried away \r\nto make an omelette of some of them.\r\n\r\nOh! look, papa, said Ernest, if they are not the very same sort \r\nwhich Robinson Crusoe found in his island! See, they are like \r\nwhite balls, covered with a skin like wetted parchment! We found \r\nthem upon the sands along the shore.\r\n\r\nYour account is perfectly just, my dear boy, said I: by what \r\nmeans did you make so useful a discovery? Oh, that is a part \r\nof our history, interrupted my wife; for I also have a history \r\nto relate, when you will be so good as to listen to it.\r\n\r\nHasten then, my love, and get your pretty side-dish ready, and \r\nwe will have the history for the dessert. In the mean while I \r\nwill relieve the cow and the ass from the encumbrance of their \r\nsea accoutrements, for I am sure they will be glad to get rid \r\nof them. Come along, boys, and give me your help. I got up, and \r\nthey all followed me gaily to the shore, where the animals had \r\nremained. We were not long in effecting our purpose with the \r\ncow and the ass, who were both animals of a quiet and kind temper; \r\nbut when it was the turn of the grunting sow, our success was \r\nneither so easy nor so certain; we had no sooner untied the rope \r\nthan she escaped from us, and with so much rapidity that none \r\nof us could get hold of her. The idea occurred to Ernest of sending \r\nthe two dogs after her, who caught her by the ears and brought \r\nher back, while we were half deafened with the hideous noise \r\nshe made; but at length she suffered us to take off her cork \r\njacket quietly enough. We now laid the swimming apparatus across \r\nthe ass’s back, and returned to the kitchen; our slothful Ernest \r\nbeing highly delighted at finding that he was likely in future \r\nto have our loads carried for us by a servant.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, my kind wife had prepared the omelette, and \r\nspread a tablecloth on the end of the cask of butter, upon which \r\nshe had placed some of the plates and silver spoons we had brought \r\nfrom the ship. The ham was in the middle, and the omelette and \r\nthe cheese opposite to each other; and all together made a figure \r\nnot to be despised by the inhabitants of a desert island. By \r\nand by the two dogs, the fowls, the pigeons, the sheep, and the \r\ngoats, had all assembled round us, which gave us something like \r\nthe air of sovereigns of the country. It did not please the geese and \r\nducks to add themselves to the number of these our curious-looking \r\nsubjects: they seemed to prefer their natural element, and confined \r\nthemselves to a marshy swamp, where they found a kind of little \r\ncrabs in great abundance: these animals furnished a delicious \r\nfood for them, and relieved us of the care of providing for their \r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished our repast, I bade Fritz present our company \r\nwith a bottle of Canary wine, which we had brought from the captain’s \r\ncabin, and I then desired my wife would indulge us with the promised \r\nhistory. I first requested her to taste our wine, and then she \r\nbegan her narrative, as will be seen in the ensuing volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by R. and A. Taylor, Shoe-lane, London._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \r\n\r\nFAMILY ROBINSON CRUSOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. \r\n\r\n_Second journey of discovery performed by the mother of the family._\r\n\r\nYou pretend, said my wife with a little malicious smile, to be \r\ncurious about my history, and for all that, you have not let \r\nme speak a single word in all this time; but the longer a torrent \r\nis pent up, and interrupted in its course, the longer it flows \r\nwhen once let loose. Now then, that you will have the condescension \r\nto attend, I shall give vent to a certain little movement of \r\nvanity, which is fluttering at my heart. Not, however, to intrude \r\ntoo long upon your patience, I will take a leap over the first \r\nday of your absence, in the course of which, nothing new took \r\nplace, except my anxiety on your account, which confined me for \r\nthe most part to the spot from whence you embarked, and from \r\nwhich I could see the vessel. But this morning, after the gratifying \r\nsight of the signal you had promised, and having set up mine \r\nin return, I looked about, before the boys were up, in hopes \r\nto find a shady place, in which I might sit down and rest myself: \r\nbut not an inch of ground appeared of this description, for there \r\nis not a single tree in any direction near us, and the only bit \r\nof shade which presented itself, was behind our tent. This occasioned \r\nme to reflect a little seriously on our situation. It will be \r\nimpossible, said I to myself, to remain in this place, scorched, \r\nduring the whole of the day, by the burning heat of the sun, \r\nwithout any other shelter than a miserable tent, under which \r\nthe heat is even more excessive than without. Courage then! said \r\nI, my husband and my eldest son are at this moment actively employed \r\nin the vessel for the general good; why then should not I, on \r\nmy part, be active and enterprising also? why not undertake, with \r\nmy youngest sons, to do something that shall add some one comfort \r\nto our existence? I will pass over with them to the other side \r\nof the river, and with my own eyes examine the country respecting \r\nwhich my husband and Fritz have related such wonders. I will \r\ntry to find out some well shaded agreeable spot, in which we \r\nmay all be settled. I now cast another look towards the vessel; \r\nbut perceiving no sign of your return, I determined to share \r\na slight dinner with the boys, and courageously to set out on \r\na journey of discovery for a habitation which might afford us \r\nmore convenience, and a better shelter from the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the morning, Jack had slipped away to the side \r\nof the tent where Fritz had hung his jackall, and with his knife, \r\nwhich he sharpened from time to time upon the rock, he cut some \r\nlong slips of skin, lengthways, from the back of the animal, \r\nand afterwards set about cleaning them with great attention. \r\nErnest discovered him employed in this uncleanly occupation; \r\nand as he is, as we all know, a little delicate, and afraid to \r\nsoil his fingers, he not only refused to give Jack any assistance, \r\nbut thought fit to sneer a little at the currier-like trade which \r\nhe had engaged in. Jack, who, as we also know, has not the most \r\npatient temper in the world, raised his hand to give him a little \r\ncuff. Ernest made his escape, more alarmed, I believe, by Jack’s \r\ndirty hands, than by the expected blow; while I, for my part, \r\nran to set them right, and to give a mother’s reproof to both. \r\nJack persisted that he had a justification full and undeniable, \r\nin the great usefulness of the said dirty work; for, said he, \r\nit is intended to make some collars, which I shall afterwards \r\narm with spikes, and the dogs will wear them for our defence. \r\nI saw in an instant that Ernest had been the aggressor, and on \r\nhim fell the reproof; I represented how little a squeamish delicacy \r\nlike his, suited with the difficulties of our situation, in which \r\none and all were called upon to assist, in any employment that \r\nshould promise to contribute to the general good.\r\n\r\nJack returned to his strips of skin, the cleaning of which he \r\ncompleted very cleverly. When he had finished this part of his \r\nundertaking, he looked out from the chest of nails, those that \r\nwere longest, and which had the largest and flattest heads: these \r\nhe stuck through the whole of the bit of skin intended for the \r\ncollar, at small distances. He next cut a strip of sail-cloth \r\nthe same breadth as the leather, and, laying it along on the \r\nheads of the nails, politely proposed to me the agreeable occupation \r\nof sewing them together, to prevent the heads of the nails from \r\ninjuring the dogs. I begged leave to be excused; but observing \r\nafterwards the good-humour with which he set about trying to \r\nsew them for himself, and that with all his good-will it was \r\ntoo difficult for a boy to execute, I conquered my repugnance to \r\nthe wild fetid smell of the leather, and rewarded him by completing \r\nthe job myself;—a mother seldom refuses the sacrifice of a little \r\npersonal convenience, if it can afford delight to a virtuous \r\nchild.\r\n\r\nBut now having yielded the first time, I found I had made myself \r\nliable to a further claim on my good-nature. The next thing was \r\na belt for himself, which he had manufactured of the same materials, \r\nand was impatient to see completed,—it being intended to contain \r\nhis two pistols. We shall see, said he, strutting about as he \r\nspoke, if the jackalls will dare to attack us now. But, my dear \r\nJack, said I, you do not foresee what will happen;—a piece of \r\nskin not entirely dry, is always liable to shrink when exposed \r\nto the heat. So, after all the disagreeable task you have imposed \r\nupon me, you will not be able to make use of it. My little workman, \r\nas I said this, struck his forehead, and betrayed other marks \r\nof impatience. What you say is true, said he, and I had not well \r\nconsidered; but I know of an effectual remedy. He then took a \r\nhammer and some nails, and stretched his strips of leather on a \r\nplank, which he then laid in the sun to dry quickly, thus preventing \r\nthe possibility of their shrinking. I applauded his invention, \r\nand promised him I would not fail to give you a full account \r\nof his proceedings.\r\n\r\nI next assembled them all three round me, and informed them of \r\nmy plans for an excursion, and you may believe I heard nothing \r\nlike a dissenting voice. They lost not a moment in preparing \r\nfor our departure; they examined their arms, their game-bags, \r\nlooked out the best clasp knives, and cheerfully undertook to \r\ncarry the provision-bags; while I, for my share, was loaded with \r\na large flask of water and hatchet, for which I thought it likely \r\nwe might find a use. I also took the light gun which belongs \r\nto Ernest, and gave him in return a carbine, which might be loaded \r\nwith several balls at once. We took some refreshment, and then \r\nsallied forth, attended by the two dogs for an escort. Turk, \r\nwho had already accompanied you in the direction I intended to \r\ntake, seemed well aware that he knew the way, and proceeded at \r\nthe head of the party in quality of a conductor. We arrived at \r\nthe place at which you had crossed the river, and succeeded in \r\npassing over as securely as you had done, not however without \r\nconsiderable difficulty.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced, I reflected that our safety depended in some \r\nmeasure on the two boys, because it was they only who knew how \r\nto use the guns. I now for the first time began to feel how fortunate \r\nit was, that you had accustomed them from infancy to face danger \r\nof every kind; in our own country I had sometimes blamed you \r\nfor allowing them the use of guns, and showing them how to fire. \r\nI was averse to their conceiving a partiality to field sports, \r\nand apprehended numberless accidents that might happen to them. \r\nBut at present I am convinced that every parent who adopts a \r\nhardy scheme of education acts the wisest part. Let me now resume \r\nthe passing of the river.\r\n\r\nErnest was first in reaching the other side, and met with no \r\naccident. The little Francis entreated me to carry him on my \r\nback, which appeared difficult enough, as I must have left the \r\nthings with which I was loaded, on the shore, and have returned \r\nto fetch them. At length we found means to manage pretty well, \r\nthanks to Jack, who relieved me of my gun and hatchet. But for \r\nhimself, finding he was scarcely able to stand under this added \r\nweight, he resolved to go straight into the water at once, rather \r\nthan run the risk of slipping, by stepping on the loose wet pieces \r\nof stone, when so heavily loaded. I myself had great difficulty \r\nto keep myself steady with the dear little burden at my back, \r\nwho joined his hands round my neck, and leaned with all his weight \r\nupon my shoulders. After having filled my flask with river water, \r\nwe proceeded on our way; and when we had reached to the top of \r\nthe ascent on the other side, which you described to us as so \r\nenchanting, I myself experienced the same effect from the delightful \r\nscenery around. I continued for some time to look and admire \r\nin silence; and for the first time since the event of our dreadful \r\naccident at sea, I felt my heart begin to open to a sense of \r\nenjoyment and of hope.\r\n\r\nIn casting my eyes over the vast extent before me, I had observed \r\na small wood of the most inviting aspect. I had so long sighed \r\nfor a little shade, that I resolved without hesitation to take \r\nour course towards it: for this, however, it was necessary to \r\ngo a long way through a strong kind of grass, which reached above \r\nthe heads of the little boys; an obstacle which, on trial, we \r\nfound too difficult to overcome. We therefore resolved to pursue \r\na direction along the river, till it was necessary to turn upon \r\nthe wood. We found traces of your footsteps, and took care to \r\nfollow them till we had come to a turn on the right, which seemed \r\nto lead directly to it; but here again we were interrupted by \r\nthe extraordinary height and thickness of the grass, which nothing \r\nbut the most indefatigable endeavours could have enabled us to \r\nget through. Jack was now loitering a little behind, and I frequently \r\nturned round to observe what he could be doing: at last I saw \r\nhim tearing off some handfulls of grass, and wiping his clothes \r\nwith it; and then I perceived him shake his pocket-handkerchief, \r\nwhich was wet, and lay it on his shoulders to dry. I hastened \r\nback to him, to inquire what had happened.\r\n\r\nOh, mother, said he, I believe all the water of the river we \r\nhave crossed, has got into my pockets: only see, every thing \r\nI had in them is wet, pistols, turfs, every thing.\r\n\r\nGood heavens! interrupted I in great alarm, had you put your \r\npistols in your pocket? They were not loaded, I hope?\r\n\r\nI am sure I do not know, mother; I only put them there while \r\nmy belt was drying, that I might always have them about me.\r\n\r\nThoughtless, yet fortunate boy! exclaimed I. Do you know what \r\nan escape you have had? If with the suddenness of your motions \r\nthe pistols had gone off, they would infallibly have killed you. \r\nTake care, I entreat you, not to commit such an imprudence in \r\nfuture. There is nothing, I believe, to fear, mother, for this \r\ntime, replied he, holding the pistols so as to let the water \r\nrun out of them. And in reality I perceived, by the condition \r\nthey were in, that there was little danger of their going off. \r\nWhile we were conversing about what had happened, our attention \r\nwas interrupted by a sudden noise, and looking about, we perceived \r\na large bird issuing from the thickest part of the grass, and \r\nmounting in the air. Each of the boys prepared to fire, but before \r\nthey could be ready, the bird was out of the reach of shot. Ernest \r\nwas bitterly disappointed, and instantly exchanged the gun for \r\nthe carbine I had given him, crying: What a pity! If I had but \r\nhad the lightest gun! if the bird had not got away so fast, I \r\nwould lay any wager I should have killed him.\r\n\r\nThe mischief was, no doubt, that you did not let him know beforehand \r\nthat it was your pleasure he should wait till you could be quite \r\nready, observed I, laughing.\r\n\r\nBut, mother, how could I possibly suppose that the bird could \r\nfly away in less than the twinkling of an eye? Ah, if one would \r\nbut come at this very moment!\r\n\r\nA good sportsman, Ernest, always holds himself in readiness, \r\nthis being, as I understand, the great art of a sportsman; for \r\nyou must know, that birds never send messages to give notice \r\nof their coming.\r\n\r\nI wish I could but know, said Jack, what bird it was; I never \r\nsaw any the least like it.\r\n\r\nI am sure it was an eagle, said the little Francis, for I have \r\nread in my book of fables that an eagle can carry off a sheep; \r\nand this bird was terribly large.\r\n\r\nO yes, said Ernest scoffingly, as if all large birds must be \r\neagles! Why, do you not know that there are some birds much larger \r\neven than eagles? the ostrich for example, which travellers sometimes \r\nname the Condor or the Candor. I must confess it would have afforded \r\nme the highest pleasure to have examined him minutely.\r\n\r\nIf you had had time to examine him, you would have had time to \r\nkill him, said I: but, as the opportunity is gone, let us look \r\nfor the place in the grass from which he mounted; we may judge \r\nat least of his size by the mark he will have left there. The \r\nboys now all scampered away to the place; when suddenly a second \r\nbird, exactly like the first, except that he was a little larger, \r\nrushed out with a great noise and mounted above their heads.\r\n\r\nThe boys remained stupid with astonishment, following him with \r\ntheir eyes and open mouths without speaking a word, while for \r\nmy own part I could not help laughing heartily. Oh! such fine \r\nsportsmen as we have here! cried I: they will never let us be \r\nin want of game, I plainly perceive. _Ah! if one would but come \r\nat this very moment!_ these were your own words, Ernest, and \r\nbehold one came, and you have let him escape: it is not of much \r\nuse, methinks, to load your guns. Ernest, always a little disposed \r\nto vent uneasiness by crying, now began to sob; but Jack, with \r\na curious mixture of a tragi-comic bravery upon his features, \r\ndarted his eager eyes upon the mountain traveller, and taking \r\noff his hat made a profound bow, roaring out, as if for the bird \r\nto hear: Have the goodness, Mr. Traveller, to indulge me once \r\nmore with a little visit, only for a single minute: you cannot \r\nimagine what good sort of people we are: I entreat that we may \r\nhave the pleasure of seeing you once again . . . . . \r\n\r\nWe now minutely examined the place from which the birds had mounted, \r\nand found a kind of large nest formed of dried plants, and the \r\nworkmanship of which was clumsy enough; the nest was empty, with \r\nthe exception of some broken shells of eggs. I inferred from \r\nthis, that their young had lately been hatched; and observing \r\nat this moment a rustling motion among some plants of shorter \r\ngrowth, at some distance from the spot on which we stood, I concluded \r\nthat the young covey were scampering away in that direction; \r\nbut as the motion soon ceased, we had no longer a guide to conduct \r\nus to their retreat. We had now then a moment for remark. Ernest, \r\nassuming his professor tone, began: You see clearly, I suppose, \r\nFrancis, that these large birds which we have met with, cannot \r\npossibly be eagles, for that species of birds was never known \r\nto make their nests in the grass; neither are their young ones \r\ncapable of taking care of themselves so soon after being hatched; \r\nthe only birds that can walk without help as soon as they come \r\nout of the shell, are partridges and quails.\r\n\r\nGive me leave, interrupted I, to add to your list, all birds \r\nof the gallinaceous kind, such as the turkey, the peacock, and \r\nthe Guinea fowl; and no doubt many other wild fowls have the \r\nsame feature in their description.\r\n\r\nBut, mother, replied he, birds of the gallinaceous kind have \r\nnot white feathers on the belly, and slate-coloured wings, like \r\nthose which have just escaped us. I, for my part, am of opinion, \r\nthat they were the great bustard; the second bird having a small \r\nmustacho on the side of the beak, which answers to the description \r\nI have seen of him in my engravings.\r\n\r\nWhat you have seen, Ernest, is always in engravings, said Jack. \r\nFor my part, I should like for once to see a real original that \r\nyou had had the skill to vanquish. If Fritz had been with us, \r\nI can tell you, the said birds would now be lying dead before \r\nus, and then you would have an opportunity of comparing them \r\nwith your engravings.\r\n\r\nI, for my part, observed I, most heartily rejoice that things \r\nhave happened as they did, and that those poor little birds which \r\nstand so much in need of their parents’ care, have not been deprived \r\nof them. What would be your own sensation, if a cruel savage \r\nof this country should attack your father or mother, with an \r\nintention to destroy them?\r\n\r\nI can more easily tell you, mother, what I would do, than what \r\nI should feel, said Jack, straightening his arm as he held the \r\npistol: young as I am, I think I can answer, that if such a bird \r\nas that should come in my way, he should meet with a reception \r\nthat would not much incline him to repeat his visit.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my good fellow: but this would not be so easy as \r\nyou imagine; for though you have arrived at the prodigious age \r\nof your tenth year, there would be some difficulty in conquering \r\none who would have twice your own strength. But now for a little \r\ngrave advice:—Take care, my excellent children, to guard against \r\nthe growth of the insensible and cruel disposition, which a passion \r\nfor field-sports is so apt to inspire; it is for this reason \r\nthat I have never wished my family to be fond of them. It has \r\nalways appeared to me that no animals ought to be destroyed, \r\nbut those who do injury to man, or are indispensably necessary \r\nfor his support.\r\n\r\nDiscoursing thus, we reached the little wood; and here our son \r\nErnest had an opportunity of recognising many of the originals \r\nof the engravings in his books of natural history, and of displaying \r\nhis knowledge, or his ignorance, to his heart’s content. A prodigious \r\nquantity of unknown birds were skipping and warbling on the branches \r\nof the trees, without betraying the least alarm at our vicinity. \r\nIn spite of the lesson in morality which I had so lately been \r\npronouncing, the desire of firing upon them again possessed their \r\nhearts; but this I absolutely forbade, and with the less scruple, \r\nas the trees were of so enormous a height as to be out of gun-shot \r\nreach.—No, my dear husband, you cannot possibly form an idea \r\nof the trees we now beheld! You must somehow have missed this \r\nwood; or so extraordinary a sight could not have escaped your \r\nobservation; in my whole life I have never seen a single tree \r\nof so immense a size. What appeared to us at a distance to be \r\na wood, was only a group of about fourteen of them, the trunks \r\nof which looked as if they were supported in their upright position, \r\nby so many arches on each side, the arches being formed by portions \r\nof the roots of the tree, of great thickness and extent. Meanwhile \r\nthe tree itself is further supported by a perpendicular root, \r\nplaced in the midst of the others, and of a smaller compass, \r\nwhile the projecting roots extend themselves on every side of \r\nthe tree, and double the circumference it would have.\r\n\r\nJack climbed with considerable trouble upon one of these arch-formed \r\nroots, and with a packthread in his hand measured the actual \r\ncircumference of the tree itself. He found that it measured more \r\nthan fifteen braches (the brache is equal to twenty-two inches \r\nand a half). I made thirty-two steps in going round one of those \r\ngiant trees at the roots; and its height from the ground to the \r\nplace where the branches begin to shoot, may be about thirty-six \r\nbraches. The twigs of this tree are strong and thick; its leaves \r\nmoderately large in size, and bearing some resemblance to the \r\nhazel tree of Europe; but I was unable to discover that it bore \r\nany fruit. The soil immediately round the tree and under its \r\nbranches, produced in great abundance a short thick kind of plant, \r\nunmixed with any of the thistle kind, and of a perfectly smooth \r\nsurface. Thus every circumstance seemed to concur in inviting \r\nus to use this spot as a place of repose; and my predilection \r\nfor it grew so strong that I resolved to go no further, but to \r\nenjoy its delicious coolness till it should be time to return. \r\nI sat down in this verdant elysium with my three sons around \r\nme. We took out our provision-bags; a charming stream, formed \r\nto increase the coolness and beauty of the scene, flowed at our \r\nfeet, and supplied us with a fresh and salutary beverage. Our \r\ndogs were not long in reaching us; they had remained behind, \r\nsauntering about the skirts of the wood. To my great surprise, \r\nthey did not ask for any thing to eat, but lay down quietly, \r\nand were soon asleep at our feet. For my own part, I felt that \r\nI could never tire of beholding and admiring this enchanting \r\nspot; it occurred to me, that if we could but contrive a kind \r\nof tent that could be fixed in one of the trees, we might safely \r\ncome and make our abode here. I had found nothing in any other \r\ndirection that suited us so well in every respect; and I resolved \r\nto look no further. When we had shared our dinner among us, and \r\nwell rested from our fatigue, we set out on our return, again \r\nkeeping close to the river, half expecting to see along the shore, \r\nsome of the pieces or other vestiges of the vessel, which the \r\nwaves might have washed on shore there.\r\n\r\nBut before we left our enchanting retreat, Jack entreated me \r\nto stay a little longer, and finish sewing the linen strips to \r\nhis leather belt. The little coxcomb had so great an ambition \r\nto strut about and exhibit himself in his belt, that he had taken \r\nthe trouble to carry the piece of wood on which he had nailed \r\nhis skin to dry, along with him, through the whole of our expedition. \r\nFinding that the skin was really dry, I granted his request, \r\npreferring, since it appeared that work I must, to do it now \r\nwhen I had the advantage of being in the shade, than after I \r\nshould be returned to the scorching of the sun outside our tent. \r\nWhen I had finished my task, he eagerly fastened the belt round \r\nhim, and placed his pistols in it; he set himself before us in \r\na marching step, with the knuckles of his hand turned back upon \r\nhis hip, leaving to Ernest the care of putting on the dogs’ collars; \r\nwhich he insisted should be done, for it would give them, he \r\nsaid, a martial air. The little hero was all impatience for you \r\nand Fritz to see him in his new accoutrement; so that I had enough \r\nto do to walk quick enough to keep sight of him; for, in a country \r\nwhere no track of the foot of man is to be found, we might easily \r\nlose each other. I became more tranquil respecting him when we \r\nhad got once more all together on the sea-shore; for, as I expected, \r\nwe found there pieces of timber, poles, large and small chests, \r\nand other articles which I knew had come from the vessel. None \r\nof us however were strong enough to bring them away; we therefore \r\ncontented ourselves with dragging all we could reach to the dry \r\nsands, beyond the reach of the waves at the highest state of \r\nthe tide. Our dogs, for their part, were fully employed in fishing \r\nfor crabs, which they drew with their paws to the shore, as the \r\nwaves washed them up, and on which they made an excellent repast. \r\nI now understood that it was this sort of prey which had appeased \r\ntheir hunger before they joined us at dinner. Heaven be praised, \r\ncried I, that our animals have found means to procure sustenance \r\nat so cheap a rate! for I really began to think that, with their \r\nenormous appetites, they might some day have taken it into their \r\nheads to eat their masters.\r\n\r\nEat us! exclaimed my brave son Jack, you surely forget; am I \r\nnot here to defend you with my pistols?\r\n\r\nSilly young pretender! they would swallow you if they had a mind, \r\nas easily as you would swallow a pill; but in reality they are \r\nkind excellent creatures, who love us, and will never do us any \r\nharm. By swallowing us, I meant that they would so considerably \r\ndiminish our provisions, that in this respect they would inflict \r\nupon us a serious misfortune.\r\n\r\nWe now suddenly cast our eyes on Ponto, whom we perceived employed \r\nin turning over a round substance he had found in the sands, \r\nsome pieces of which he swallowed from time to time. Ernest also \r\nperceived what he was about, and did us the favour, with his \r\nusual composure, to pronounce just these words:—They are turtles’ \r\neggs!\r\n\r\nRun, my children, cried I, and get as many of them as you can; \r\nthey are excellent, and I shall have the greatest pleasure in \r\nbeing able to regale our dear travellers on their return, with \r\nso new and delicious a dish. We found it a little difficult to \r\nmake Ponto come away from the eggs, to which he had taken a great \r\nfancy. At length, however, we succeeded in collecting near two \r\ndozen of them, which we secured in our provision-bags. When we \r\nhad concluded this affair, we by accident cast our eyes upon \r\nthe boundless ocean, and to our great astonishment we perceived \r\na sail, which seemed to be joyfully approaching towards the land. \r\nI knew not what to think; but Ernest, who always thinks he knows \r\nevery thing, or can guess at every thing, exclaimed that it was \r\nyou and Fritz; but little Francis was terribly afraid that it \r\nmust be the savages come to eat us up, like those described in \r\nRobinson Crusoe’s Island. We soon, however, had the happiness \r\nof being convinced that Ernest was right, and that it was indeed \r\nour well-beloved! We ran eagerly towards the river, which Jack \r\nand Ernest recrossed as before, by leaping from one great stone \r\nto another; while I also resumed my burden of little Francis at my \r\nback, and in this manner soon arrived at the place of your landing, \r\nwhen we had nothing further to do but to throw ourselves into \r\nyour arms! This, my dear husband, is a faithful and circumstantial \r\nnarration of our journey of discovery; and now, if you wish me \r\na great deal of happiness, you will not refuse to conduct me \r\nand your sons, with our whole train of animals, to the spot I \r\nhave described, where we cannot fail to find a more agreeable \r\nasylum than here, under these scorching rocks.\r\n\r\nAnd these giant trees are then the asylum you have chosen for \r\nour future abode! And you would have a tent set up in one of \r\nthem, at a distance of more than sixty-six feet from the ground, \r\nwhere we should be perched like parrots! And pray by what means \r\nare we to ascend this tree? for at present I have no clear view \r\nof this important part of the subject.\r\n\r\nAlas! my dear husband, I see the objections against my plan as \r\nplainly as you can do; but after all, we cannot but be considerable \r\ngainers by the change: for my part, I dared not venture further \r\nwithout having my dear protector at my side. Who knows, if we \r\nwere to set out together upon another expedition, if we should \r\nnot find a still more convenient spot, in which we could take \r\nup our abode?\r\n\r\nI perceived a tear stealing into my wife’s eyes, on finding that \r\nshe could not prevail upon me to think as favourably as she wished \r\nof her discovery, and that I treated the subject of her giant \r\ntrees with so little respect:\r\n\r\nI therefore endeavoured by every means to sooth and relieve her \r\nsomewhat wounded sensibility. I assured her how much I admired \r\nher courage, and that I considered her adventure as a proof that \r\nwomen possess that fine quality in as great perfection in their \r\nhearts, as some men exhibit instances of it in their conduct. \r\nDo not then distress yourself, my love, but tell me if I shall \r\nmake you a balloon of sail-cloth, to enable you to arrive at \r\nyour country seat amongst the branches.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, said she, laugh as much as you like, if it amuses you; \r\nbut I assure you my plan is not so silly as you imagine; one \r\nadvantage, at least, it is certain we should derive,—the being \r\nout of reach of jackalls and other wild beasts. Do you recollect \r\nthe large lime-tree in the public walk of the town we lived in, \r\nand the pretty little room which had been built among its branches, \r\nand the flight of stairs which led to it? What should hinder \r\nus from effecting such a contrivance in one of my giant trees, \r\nwhich afford even superior facilities in the enormous size and \r\nstrength of their branches, and the peculiar manner of their \r\ngrowth?\r\n\r\nWell, well, we shall see about it. In the mean while, my boys, \r\nlet us extract a little lesson in arithmetic, from the subject \r\nof these marvellous trees; for this, at least, will be deriving \r\na real benefit from them. Tell me, learned Mr. Ernest, how many \r\nfeet there are in thirty-six braches? for that, your mother assures \r\nus, is the height of the trees.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—To answer this question, I must know first how many \r\nfeet or inches the brache contains.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I thought you knew long ago as much as this; but, as \r\nusual in young heads, what goes in at one ear goes out at the \r\nother. I must then remind you, as you have forgot, that the brache, \r\nor half-ell, contains one foot ten inches, or twenty-two inches. \r\nNow then make your calculation.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I do not find it so easy as I thought. You must help \r\nme, Fritz, you are older than I am.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—With all my heart. First we take thirty-six braches; \r\nthen multiply 36 by 22, the number of inches each brach contains, \r\nand you have 792; divide this by 12, the number of inches in \r\na foot, and it will give us 66 for the number of feet. Is that \r\nright, father?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Yes, quite right. So, my dear wife, you will have every \r\nevening to climb sixty-six feet to get to bed, which, as we have \r\nno ladder, is not the easiest thing imaginable. Now then let \r\nus see how many feet the tree is in circumference, taking it \r\nround the roots. Your mother found that she walked round it in \r\nthirty-two steps. Now then, Ernest, how many feet do you think \r\nthese thirty-two steps would make?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—You always ask me the things that I know nothing at \r\nall about: you should tell me, at least, how many feet there \r\nare in a step.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Well, say two feet and a half to each step.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Twice 32 makes 64; the half of 32 is 16; which added \r\nto 64 makes 80 feet.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Very well. Tell me now, if you recollect the proper \r\nterm in geometry for the circumference of a circle, or say of \r\na tree, since we are talking of trees.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Oh, you may be sure that I could not forget that it \r\nis called the periphery.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Right. And what is the term for any line which may \r\nbe drawn from one point of the periphery to another, passing \r\nthrough the centre? Now, Jack, you may show us what a great \r\ngeometrician you intend to be.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I believe it is called the diameter.\r\n\r\n_Father._—So far right. Next, can you tell me what is the diameter \r\nof a periphery of eighty feet, and what distance there is between \r\nthe extremities of the roots of the giant tree and its trunk?\r\n\r\nThe boys all began to reckon, and soon one said one number, one \r\nsaid another,—at random; but Fritz called out louder than the \r\nrest, that the distance was twenty-six feet.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You are pretty near. Tell me, did you make a calculation, \r\nor was it a mere guess?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—No, father, not a guess; but I will tell you. In the \r\ntown in which we lived, I have often taken notice that the hatter, \r\nwhen he was about to bind the edge of a hat, always measured \r\nthree times the length of the diameter, and a trifle over, for \r\nthe quantity of ribbon he should use: thus I had no difficulty \r\nin finding that the third of eighty was about twenty-six; and \r\nadding a couple of feet for the over measure, we may call it \r\ntwenty-eight.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I am glad to see you did not lose such an opportunity \r\nfor calculation; but a great boy like you, who have advanced \r\nin your studies, ought not to be under obligations to the hatter \r\nfor the answer. But now let us go back to the measure of our \r\ntrees, which are really of a most extraordinary size. Height \r\nfrom the ground to the branches, sixty-six feet; thickness, eight \r\nfeet in diameter, and twenty-eight feet distance from the extremities \r\nof the roots to the trunk. They really, with propriety, may be \r\ncalled giant trees.\r\n\r\nHaving finished our conversation, we performed our devotions, \r\nand retired to rest, grateful and well satisfied to find ourselves \r\nonce more together, and in health. We soon closed our eyes, and \r\nenjoyed tranquil slumbers till break of day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. \r\n\r\n_Construction of a bridge._\r\n\r\nWhen my wife and I were awake next morning, we resumed the question \r\nof our change of abode. I observed to her, that it was a matter \r\nof great difficulty, and required mature consideration; otherwise \r\nwe might hereafter have reason to repent the useless labour and \r\ninconvenience we should have brought upon ourselves, by a fruitless \r\nremoval. My own opinion is, said I, that, upon the whole, we \r\nhad better remain here, where Providence seems to have conducted \r\nus; the situation of the place affords conveniences, both with \r\nrespect to our personal safety and being so near to the vessel, \r\nfrom which we may continue to enrich ourselves. See how completely \r\nwe are on all sides protected by the rocks; it is an asylum, \r\ninaccessible but by sea or by the passage of the river, which \r\nis not easily accomplished. Let us then have patience yet a little \r\nlonger, at least, till we have got all that can be removed, or \r\nthat would be useful to us, from the ship.\r\n\r\nNothing can be sounder than your reasons, my love, replied my \r\nwife; but indeed no patience can endure the intense heat of these \r\nsands, which is even increased by the vicinity of the rocks. \r\nIt is not easy for you to conceive how great my sufferings are \r\nfrom this cause; for you have generally been out on some voyage \r\nof discovery, and have been occasionally relieved by the shade \r\nof trees. Another consideration is, that by remaining here, we \r\nmust renounce all hope of procuring fruits of any kind, and must \r\nlive on oysters, to which we have all a great aversion, or on \r\nsuch wild birds as that which you found so unpalatable. And, \r\nfor the safety you boast of, the rocks did not prevent our receiving \r\na visit from the jackalls; nor is it improbable that tigers or \r\nother animals might follow their example. Lastly, in regard to \r\nthe treasures we might continue to draw from the vessel, I renounce \r\nthem with all my heart. We are already in possession of a great \r\nabundance of provisions and other useful things; and, for my part, \r\nmy heart is always filled with the most distressing apprehensions, \r\nwhenever you and Fritz are exposed to the danger of that perfidious \r\nelement the sea.\r\n\r\nUpon my word, my love, the shade of your giant trees has inspired \r\nyou with a most powerful eloquence; and I perceive that nothing \r\nso effectually animates the language of a female, as an ardent \r\ndesire and a fixed determination to carry a particular point; \r\nI see that the affair will end by my submitting to your will. \r\nYou are, as you ought to be, the director of our plans; but let \r\nus have a well-digested scheme of operation before we leave this \r\nspot for your favourite wood.—First, we must contrive a place \r\namong the rocks, where we can leave our provisions and other \r\nthings, which may serve both for a fortress and a storehouse, \r\nand to which, in case of any danger from invasion in the wood, \r\nwe can immediately retreat.—Come then, this agreed, the next \r\nthing is to throw a bridge across the river, if we are to pass \r\nit with all our family and baggage.\r\n\r\nA bridge! exclaimed my wife; can you possibly think of such a \r\nthing? If we stay while you build a bridge, we may consider ourselves \r\nas fixt here for life. What reason can there be, that we should \r\nnot cross the river as we did before? The ass and the cow will \r\ncarry all our goods upon their backs.\r\n\r\nBut do you recollect, that to preserve dry what they carry, they \r\nmust not perform their journey as they did from the vessel? For \r\nthis reason, then, if for no other, we must contrive a bridge. \r\nWe shall want also some sacks and baskets to contain our different \r\nmatters; you may therefore set about making these, and I will \r\nundertake the bridge, which the more I consider, the more I find \r\nto be of indispensable necessity; for the stream will, no doubt, \r\nat times increase, and the passage become impracticable in any other \r\nway. At this very time it would be found so for our shortest-legged \r\nanimals, and I am sure you would not wish to see them drowned. \r\nBut even our own boys, at least the youngest, will derive a means \r\nof safety from my bridge; for it is not quite certain that they \r\nwould always succeed so well as they did the first time, in their \r\njumping from stone to stone.\r\n\r\nWell, then, a bridge let there be, said my wife; I see I must \r\nconsent. But let us not allow ourselves a moment of leisure till \r\nwe have completed all that is necessary for our departure. You \r\nwill leave our stock of gunpowder here, I hope; for I am not \r\neasy with a large quantity of it so near us; a thunder-storm, \r\nor some thoughtless action of one of the boys, might expose us \r\nto serious danger.\r\n\r\nYou are right, my love; and I will carefully attend to your \r\nsuggestion. We will keep on hand only a sufficient quantity for daily \r\nuse; I will contrive a place in the rock for the rest, where it will \r\nbe safe from the chance of fire or dampness. It is an article \r\nwhich, according to the use which is made of it, may become on \r\nthe one hand, a most dangerous enemy, and, on the other, a most \r\nuseful friend.\r\n\r\nThus, then, we decided the important question of removing to \r\na new abode; after which we fixed in concert upon a plan of labour \r\nfor the day, and then awaked the boys. Their ecstasy on hearing \r\nof our project may easily be conceived; but they expressed their \r\nfear that it would be a long while before a bridge could be built; \r\na single hour appearing an age to them, with such a novelty in \r\nview as the prospect of removing to the wood, to live under the \r\ngiant trees. They, in the fullness of their joy, entreated that \r\nthe place might be called, _The promised Land_.\r\n\r\nWe now began to look about for breakfast; Fritz taking care not \r\nto neglect his monkey, who sucked one of the goats as quietly \r\nand as contentedly as if she had been his mother. My wife undertook \r\nto milk another, and then the cow, and afterwards gave some of \r\nthe milk to each of the children: with a part of what remained \r\nshe made a sort of soup with biscuits, and the rest she put into \r\none of the flasks, to accompany us in our expedition. During \r\nthis time, I was preparing the boat for another journey to the \r\nvessel, to bring away a sufficient quantity of planks and timbers \r\nfor the bridge. After breakfast we set out; and this time I took \r\nwith me Ernest as well as Fritz, that we might accomplish our \r\nobject in a shorter time. We rowed stoutly till we reached the \r\ncurrent, which soon drew us on beyond the bay; but scarcely had \r\nwe passed a little islet, lying to one side of us, than we perceived \r\na prodigious quantity of sea-gulls and other birds, whose various \r\nand discordant sounds so disagreeably assailed us, that we were \r\nobliged to stop our ears. Fritz would instantly have fired upon \r\nthem, if I had not prevented him. I had a great curiosity to \r\ndiscover what could possibly be the reason of so numerous an \r\nassembly of these creatures. I therefore steered to the spot; \r\nbut, finding that the boat made but little way, I hoisted my \r\nsail, that we might have the assistance of the wind.\r\n\r\nTo Ernest our expedition afforded the highest delight. He was \r\nin ecstasies at seeing the sail begin to swell, and the motion \r\nof the streamer in the air. Fritz, on his part, did not for a \r\nmoment take his eyes from the islet where the birds had assembled. \r\nPresently he suddenly exclaimed: I see what it is; the birds \r\nare all pecking, tooth and beak, at a monstrous fish, which lies \r\ndead upon the soil.\r\n\r\nTooth! brother Fritz, replied Ernest; it must be curious to see birds \r\nwith teeth. Fritz, however, was right; I approached, sufficiently \r\nnear to step upon the land, and after bringing the boat to an \r\nanchor with a heavy stone, we walked cautiously and gently up \r\nto the birds. We soon perceived that the object which attracted \r\nthem was in reality an enormous fish, which had been thrown by \r\nthe sea upon the islet, and whose dead body lay invitingly there \r\nfor all the birds which should pass that way. Indeed, so eagerly \r\nwere they occupied with the feast, that though we were within \r\nthe distance of half gun-shot, not one of them attempted to fly \r\noff. We observed with astonishment the extreme voracity of this \r\nplumed group; each bird was so intent upon its prey, that nothing \r\ncould have been more easy than to have killed great numbers of \r\nthem with our sticks alone: we did not, however, envy them their \r\nprize. Fritz did not cease to express his wonder at the monstrous \r\nsize of the animal, and asked me by what means he could have \r\ngot there.\r\n\r\nI believe, answered I, you were yourself the means; there is \r\nevery appearance that it is the very shark you so skilfully wounded \r\nyesterday. See, here are the two balls which you discharged at \r\nits head.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, it is the very same, said my young hero skipping about \r\nfor joy; I well remember I had two balls in my gun, and here \r\nthey are, lodged in his hideous head.\r\n\r\nI grant it is hideous enough, continued I; its aspect even when \r\ndead makes one shudder with disgust, particularly when I recollect \r\nhow easy it would have been for him to have devoured us. See \r\nwhat a horrible mouth he has, and what a singular kind of mustachio \r\nprojecting above! and what a rough and prickly skin! one might \r\nalmost use it for a file. Nor is he small of his species; for \r\nI would lay any wager that he measures more than twenty feet, \r\nfrom head to tail. We ought to be thankful to Providence, and \r\na little to our Fritz also, for having delivered us from such \r\na monster! But let us each take away with us a bit of his skin, \r\nfor I have an idea that it may in some way or other be useful \r\nto us. But how to drive away these eager intruders, so as to \r\nget at him, is the difficulty.\r\n\r\nErnest instantly drew out the iron ramrod from his gun, and in \r\na few moments killed several, by striking among them to right \r\nand left, while all the others took their flight. Fritz and I \r\nthen advanced and cut several long strips of the skin from the \r\nhead of the shark, with which we were proceeding to our boat, \r\nwhen I observed, lying on the ground, some planks and timbers \r\nwhich had recently been cast by the sea on this little island. \r\nI therefore made choice of such as seemed proper for my purpose; \r\nand, with the assistance of the crow and a lever which we had \r\nbrought with us, I found means to get them into the boat, and \r\nthus spare ourselves the trouble of proceeding further to the \r\nvessel. I bound the timbers together, with the planks upon them, \r\nin the manner of a raft, and tied them to the end of the boat; \r\nso that, in consequence of this adventure, we were ready to return \r\nin about four hours after our departure, and might with justice \r\nboast of having done a good day’s work. I accordingly pushed \r\nagain for the current, which soon drove us out to sea; then I \r\ntacked about, and resumed the direct route for the bay and for \r\nour place of embarkation, by this means avoiding the danger of \r\ntouching upon shallows. All this succeeded to my utmost wishes; \r\nI unfurled my sail, and a brisk wind soon conveyed us to our \r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nWhile we were sailing, Fritz, at my request, had nailed the strips \r\nof skin we cut from the shark, to the mast to dry. Ernest had \r\nbeen employed in examining the birds he had killed with his ramrod. \r\nI cannot imagine, father, said he, why you should think they \r\nare not good to eat. What is their name?\r\n\r\nI believe they are called sea-gulls, a bird that lives upon the \r\ncarcases of other animals, and whose flesh for that reason must \r\nhave contracted a bad flavour; there are many kinds of them, \r\nand all of so senseless a nature, as to fly down in flocks upon \r\ndead whales, even while the fishermen are round them cutting \r\nthem up; and the birds try to seize upon small pieces of the \r\nfat, as they hold them in their hands; and they suffer themselves \r\nto be killed, rather than let go their prize.\r\n\r\nThey must indeed be stupid creatures, said Fritz, to have let \r\nErnest kill them with the ramrod. But look here, father, you \r\nwere wrong in telling me to nail my skins to the mast; for they \r\nhave curled round in drying, and I cannot make them flat again.\r\n\r\nThat was precisely my intention, replied I, they will be much \r\nmore useful to us round than flat: besides, you have still some \r\nleft, which you may dry flat; and then we shall have a fine provision \r\nof shagreen, if we can find out a good method to rub off the \r\nsharp points, and afterwards to polish it.\r\n\r\nI thought, said Ernest, that shagreen was made of ass’s skin. \r\nAnd you were not mistaken, rejoined I; the best shagreen is made \r\nin Turkey, Persia, and Tartary, from skin taken from the back \r\nof the ass and of horses. While the skin is yet moist, it is \r\nstretched upon a kind of hard fat; they then beat the skin, by \r\nwhich means the fat is incorporated, and gives the surface the \r\nappearance of a kind of file: but very good shagreen is also \r\nmade from the skin of sea-fish, particularly in France.\r\n\r\nErnest asked his brother if he knew why the mouth of the shark \r\nis not, as in other animals, placed in the middle of the snout, \r\nbut directly under. Fritz confessed his inability to answer this \r\nquestion. And for my part, continued he a little consequentially, \r\nall I know is how to kill them when the occasion presents itself. \r\nSo pray, learned brother, be kind enough to let us share your \r\ninformation on the subject, for I take for granted, your question \r\nmeans that you can answer it yourself.\r\n\r\nI suppose, rejoined Ernest, that the mouth of the shark is thus \r\nplaced, with the intention of preventing him from depopulating \r\nthe sea and the land. With so excessive a voraciousness of appetite \r\nas he possesses, nothing would escape him, if he had the power \r\nto seize his prey without turning his body; but as it is, there \r\nis time enough for a smaller animal to make his escape.\r\n\r\nWell reasoned, my young philosopher, cried I; and though we should \r\nnot always be able to comprehend the intention of the Creator \r\nin the objects which surround us, at least the conjectures we \r\nare induced to form respecting them, cannot fail of being a useful \r\nexercise to the mind.\r\n\r\nI have already said we were once more landed safely on our shore, \r\nbut no one of our family appeared. We called out to them as loud \r\nas we could, which was answered by the same sounds in return, \r\nand in a few minutes my wife appeared between her two little \r\nboys returning from the river, a rising piece of ground having \r\nconcealed her from our sight: each carried a handkerchief in \r\nhand, which appeared filled with some new prize; and little Francis \r\nhad a small fishing-net formed like a bag and strung upon a stick, \r\nwhich he carried on his shoulder. No sooner did they hear our \r\nvoices, than they flew to meet us, astonished at our quick return. \r\nJack reached us before the rest; and his first act was to open \r\nthe handkerchief he held, and pour out a large number of lobsters \r\nat our feet: their mother and little Francis produced each as \r\nmany more, forming all together a prodigious heap, and all alive; \r\nso that we were sure of excellent dinners for some days at least. \r\nSome of the animals tried to escape in different directions; \r\nand the boys in following them, were kept in full chase, sometimes \r\npleased and sometimes angry; sometimes laughing, sometimes scolding \r\nat the bootless trouble they were engaged in; for no sooner had \r\nthey seized on one deserter, than ten more had followed his example.\r\n\r\nNow, have I not been very lucky, papa? said little Francis; for \r\nyou must know it was I who found them out! Look, there are more \r\nthan two hundred of them, and see how large they are, and what \r\nfine claws they have! I am sure they will be quite delicious!\r\n\r\n_Father._—Excellent indeed, my little fellow, and particularly \r\nif it was your industry that first discovered them.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Yes, father, it was Francis who saw them first; but it \r\nwas I who ran to tell mamma, and it was I who fetched the net \r\nand put it to rights, and it was I who went up to my knees in \r\nwater to catch them.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You make a charming story of it together, my boys; \r\nbut as it is an interesting subject, you may tell me as many \r\nparticulars as you please; it is indeed an event of some importance \r\nfor our kitchen, and I have great pleasure in looking forward \r\nto partaking of a dish of your providing.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Well, papa, I will tell you. As soon as you were gone, \r\nmamma sat down outside the tent and began to work, while Francis \r\nand I took a little walk towards the river, to find out a proper \r\nplace for you to begin the bridge.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Bravo! Mr. Architect, it is you then who will direct \r\nthe workmen; but joking apart, I am much gratified to find that \r\ncareless head of yours for once employed upon a useful subject. \r\nWell then, did you find a proper place for me to begin the bridge?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Yes, father, yes. But listen, and you will know all. \r\nWe were advancing towards the river, and Francis was amusing \r\nhimself with taking up some parti-coloured stones, calling out \r\nwhenever he found one that seemed extraordinary: Jack, Jack, \r\nlook what a beautiful stone I have found, all yellow! I am sure \r\nit must be gold, so I shall pound it, and make sand of it for \r\nmy writing. As we reached the river, he saw a stone of this kind \r\njust upon the brink, and kneeling down with his head out over \r\nto take it up, he all at once cried out: Jack, Jack, Fritz’s \r\njackall is covered all over with lobsters! Run as fast as you \r\ncan. I sprang to him in an instant, and I saw not only the jackall \r\ncovered with them, but legions more coming in with the stream. \r\nI ran to tell mamma, who immediately got the net which you brought \r\nfrom the vessel. Partly with this net, and partly with our hands, \r\nwe caught those you see in a very few minutes; and we should \r\nhave caught a much larger number if we had not heard you call, \r\nfor the river is quite full of them. You took quite enough for \r\nonce, my boy, said I: A little at a time is the maxim that suits \r\nus best, and I should even advise your taking the smallest of \r\nthem back to the river, where they will grow larger; we shall \r\nstill have sufficient for several magnificent repasts. This then, \r\nsaid I to myself, is a new source for our support: even here, \r\nin these arid regions, we find means to procure, not only the \r\nnecessaries of life, but luxuries in abundance. May we never \r\ncease to evince our gratitude to Providence, by the exercise \r\nof a more than ordinary care and industry!\r\n\r\nIt was now our turn to relate the events of our voyage on the \r\nwater. Ernest gave an account of his seagulls, but it did not \r\ninspire his mother with a desire for one of them for our next day’s \r\ndinner. We now put our remaining lobsters into the handkerchiefs \r\nand the net, and the boys took them to the place allotted for \r\nkeeping our provisions. My wife set about dressing some of them, \r\nand in the mean time Fritz and I employed ourselves in untying \r\nthe raft of timbers and planks, and in taking them out of the \r\nboat. I then imitated the example of the Laplanders, in harnessing \r\ntheir rein-deer for drawing their sledges. Instead of traces, \r\nhalters, &c., I put a piece of rope with a running knot at the \r\nend, round the neck of the ass, and passed the other end between \r\nits legs, to which I tied the piece of wood which I wished to \r\nbe removed. The cow was harnessed in the same manner, and we \r\nwere thus enabled to carry our materials, piece by piece, to \r\nthe spot which our architect Jack had chosen at the river, as \r\nthe most eligible for our bridge; and to say the truth, I thought \r\nhis judgement excellent; it was a place where the shore on each \r\nside was steep, and of equal height; there was even on our side, \r\nan old trunk of a tree lying on the ground, on which I rested \r\nmy principal timber.\r\n\r\nNow then, boys, said I, the first thing is to see if our timbers \r\nare long enough to reach to the other side: by my eye I should \r\nthink they are; but if I had a surveyor’s plane, we might be \r\nquite sure, instead of working at a venture.\r\n\r\nBut my mother has some balls of packthread with which she measured \r\nthe height of the giant tree, interrupted Ernest, and nothing \r\nwould be more easy than to tie a stone to the end of one of them, \r\nand throw it to the other side of the river; then we could draw \r\nit to the very brink, and thus obtain the exact length that would \r\nbe required for our timbers.\r\n\r\nYour idea is excellent, cried I; nothing gives me more pleasure \r\nthan to see you exercise your invention; run quickly and fetch \r\nthe packthread. He returned without loss of time; the stone was \r\ntied to its end, and thrown across as we had planned; we drew \r\nit gently back to the river edge, marking the place where the \r\nbridge was to rest; we next measured the string, and found that \r\nthe distance from one side to the other was eighteen feet. It \r\nappeared to me necessary, that to give a sufficient solidity \r\nto the timbers, I must allow three feet at each end of extra \r\nlength for fixing them, amounting therefore in all to twenty-four \r\nfeet; and I was fortunate enough to find that many of those we had \r\nbrought, did not fall short of this length. There now remained the \r\ndifficulty of conducting them across the stream; but we determined \r\nto discuss this part of the subject while we ate our dinner, \r\nwhich had been waiting for us more than an hour.\r\n\r\nWe all now proceeded homewards, and entering the kitchen, we \r\nfound our good steward had prepared a large dish of lobsters \r\nfor us; but before she would let us taste them, she insisted \r\nwe should see another useful labour she had been employed about; \r\nshe accordingly displayed two sacks intended for the ass, which \r\nshe had seamed with packthread; the work she assured us, had \r\nwith difficulty been accomplished, since for want of a needle \r\nlarge enough to carry packthread, she had been obliged to make \r\na hole with a nail for every stitch: we might therefore judge \r\nby her perseverance in such a task, or the ardour with which \r\nshe longed to see her plan of a removal executed. She received \r\non this occasion, as was well her due, abundance of compliments \r\nand thanks from her companions, and also a little good-humoured \r\nraillery. For this time, we hurried through our meal, all being \r\ndeeply interested in the work we were about to undertake, and \r\nconcerning which, each gave his advice without the least ceremony. \r\nThe impatience we all felt to begin, scarcely left us time to \r\nstrip the lobsters of their shells, each thinking only of the \r\npart which might be assigned him towards the execution of the \r\n_Nonpareil_; for this, for mutual encouragement, was the name \r\nwe gave our bridge, even before it was in existence.\r\n\r\nHaving consulted together as to the means of laying our timbers \r\nacross the river, the first thing I did, was to attach one of \r\nthem to the trunk of the tree of which I have already spoken, \r\nby a strong cord, long enough to turn freely round the trunk; \r\nI then fastened another cord to the other end of the beam; this \r\ncord I fastened round a stone, and then threw the stone across \r\nthe river. I next passed the river as I had done before, furnished \r\nwith a pulley, which I secured to a tree; I passed my second \r\ncord through the pulley, and recrossing the river with this cord \r\nin my hand, I contrived to harness the ass and the cow to the \r\nend of the cord. I next drove the animals from the bank of the \r\nriver; they resisted at first, but I made them go by force of \r\ndrawing. I first fixed one end of the beam firm to the trunk \r\nof the tree, and then they drew along the other end, so as gradually \r\nto advance over the river: presently, to my great joy, I saw \r\nit touch the other side, and at length become fixt and firm by \r\nits own weight. In a moment Fritz and Jack leaped upon the timber, \r\nand, in spite of my paternal fears, crossed the stream with a \r\njoyful step upon this narrow but effective bridge.\r\n\r\nThe first timber being thus laid, the difficulty of our undertaking \r\nwas considerably diminished; a second and a third were fixt in \r\nsuccession, and with the greatest ease. Fritz and I, standing \r\non opposite sides of the river, placed them at such distances from \r\neach other, as was necessary to form a broad and handsome bridge: \r\nwhat now remained to be done, was to lay some short planks across \r\nthem quite close to each other, which we executed so expeditiously, \r\nthat our whole undertaking was completed in a much shorter time \r\nthan I should have imagined possible. The reader should have \r\nseen our young workmen, to form the least conception of the delight \r\nthey felt: they jumped, and danced, and played a thousand antics, \r\nand uttered a thousand joyful sounds upon their bridge. For my \r\nown part, I could hardly restrain myself from joining in these \r\ndemonstrations of their perfect happiness; and my wife, who had \r\nbeen the mover of all our operations, was as little disposed \r\nto a silent calm enjoyment of our success, as any of the rest: \r\nshe ran to one, and then to another, embracing each in turn, \r\nand was never tired of passing and repassing on our piece of \r\nworkmanship, which was every where safe and even, and at least \r\nten feet in breadth. I had not fastened the cross planks to each \r\nother, for they appeared to be close and firm without it; and \r\nbesides, I recollected that in case of danger from any kind of \r\ninvasion, we could with the greater ease remove them, and thus \r\nrender the passage of the river more difficult. Our labour however \r\nhad occasioned us so much fatigue, that we found ourselves unable \r\nfor that day to enter upon new exertions; and the evening beginning \r\nto set in, we returned to our home, where we partook heartily \r\nof an excellent supper, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. \r\n\r\n_Change of abode._\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were all up and had breakfasted, the next morning, \r\nI assembled all the members of my family together, to take with \r\nthem a solemn farewell of this our first place of reception from \r\nthe horrible disaster of the shipwreck. I confess that for my \r\nown part I could not leave it without much regret; it was a place \r\nof greater safety than we were likely again to meet with; it \r\nwas also nearer to the vessel: but it was sufficient for me to \r\nknow that the kind and faithful companion of my misfortunes had \r\nconceived an unalterable distaste for it, to incline me to yield \r\nmy own opinion and my wishes. I should indeed consider myself \r\nunworthy of such a partner, if I could have felt hesitation in \r\na point of so much interest to her feelings. I thought it right \r\nto represent strongly to my sons, particularly to the youngest, \r\nthe danger of exposing themselves as they had done the evening \r\nbefore, along the river. We are now going, continued I, to inhabit \r\nan unknown country, which is not so well protected by nature \r\nas that we are leaving; we are unacquainted both with the soil \r\nand its inhabitants, whether human creatures or beasts; it is \r\ntherefore necessary to use the utmost caution, to make it a rule \r\nnever to remain separate from each other; particularly you young \r\nones must take care not to run on before, or stay too far behind. \r\nThis you must promise, my boys. Having unburdened my mind of \r\nthis necessary charge, we prepared for setting out. I directed \r\nmy sons to assemble our whole flock of animals, and to leave \r\nthe ass and the cow to me, that I might load them with the sacks \r\nas before concerted; I had filled these at the two ends, and \r\nmade a slit longways in the middle of each of them, and to each \r\nside of the slits I tied several long pieces of cord, which crossing \r\neach other and being again brought round and fastened, served \r\nto hold the sacks firmly on the back of the animal. We next began \r\nto put together all the things we should stand most in need of, for \r\nthe two or three first days, in our new abode; working implements, \r\nkitchen utensils, the captain’s service of plate, and a small \r\nprovision of butter, &c. &c. I put these articles into the two \r\nends of each sack, taking care that the sides should be equally \r\nheavy, and then fastened them on. I next added our hammocks and \r\nother coverings to complete the load, and we were about to begin \r\nour march when my wife stopped me. I cannot prevail upon myself, said \r\nshe, to leave our fowls behind us to pass the night by themselves; \r\nfor I fear they would infallibly become the prey of the jackalls. \r\nWe must, somehow or other, contrive a place for them among the \r\nluggage, and also one for our little Francis, who cannot walk \r\nso far, and on that account would not fail to interrupt our speed. \r\nThere is also my enchanted bag, which I recommend to your particular \r\ncare, said she, smiling, for who can tell what may yet pop out \r\nof it for your good pleasure!\r\n\r\nWomen, for their part, never fail to have more things to carry \r\nthan there are places to put them in, said I, also laughing: \r\nhowever, let us see how handsomely I shall be able to provide \r\nfor what belongs to you, my love. Fortunately, I had already \r\nthought of making the ass’s load as light as possible, foreseeing \r\nthat it would be necessary he should carry our little one a part \r\nof the way. I now accordingly placed the child upon his back, \r\nfixing the enchanted bag in such a way as to support him, and \r\nI tied them together upon the ass with so many cords, that the \r\nanimal might even have galloped without any danger of his falling \r\noff.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, the other boys had been running after the \r\ncocks and hens and the pigeons, but had not succeeded in catching \r\none of them; so they returned empty-handed and in ill-humour. \r\nLittle blockheads! said their mother, see how you have heated \r\nyourselves in running after these untractable creatures! I could \r\nhave put you in a way to catch them in a moment; come along with \r\nme, and see.—Yes, yes, you may think so, mother, said Jack, a \r\nlittle sulky, but I will give you leave to roast me in the place \r\nof the first fowl that you shall be able to catch. Poor Jack, \r\nsaid she laughing, you will then soon be on the spit, I can tell \r\nyou; which would really be a pity, considering what better things \r\nwe might do with you; though, to say the truth, you have not \r\nshown that you have more brains than a goose, in thinking to \r\ncatch the animals by running after them in this manner. She now \r\nstepped into the tent, and brought out two handfuls of peas and \r\noats, and by pronouncing a few words of invitation in the accustomed \r\ntone, the birds all flocked round her in a moment. She then walked \r\nslowly before them, dropping the grain all the way, till they \r\nhad followed her into the tent. When she perceived that they \r\nwere all in the inside, and busily employed in picking up the \r\ngrain, she shut the entrance, and caught one after the other \r\nwithout the smallest difficulty. The boys looked at each other \r\nhalf-ashamed, though much amused with the adventure. Grant me \r\na reprieve from the spit, mother, cried Jack, and I will do all \r\nI can to help you in securing your prisoners. Accordingly, he \r\nset himself to work, and had soon caught the whole. They were \r\nthen tied by the feet and wings, put into a basket covered with \r\na net, and placed in triumph on the top of our luggage. Ernest \r\nsuggested the placing two bent sticks arch-ways across the basket, \r\nand throwing a blanket over it, that the want of light might \r\nincline them to repose; for, with the clatter they made, it was \r\nimpossible to hear each other speak.\r\n\r\nWe packed up every thing we were obliged to leave, and placed \r\nit in the tent, which we carefully closed, and, for greater security, \r\nfastened down the ends of the sail-cloth at the entrance, by driving \r\nstakes through them into the ground. We ranged a number of vessels, \r\nboth full and empty, round the tent, to serve as a rampart, and \r\nthus we confided to the protection of heaven our remaining treasures. \r\nAt length we set ourselves in motion: each of us, great and small, \r\ncarried a gun upon his shoulder, and a game bag at his back. \r\nChildren are always fond of a change of place; ours were full \r\nof joy and good-humour; nor was their mother less affected with \r\nthe same cause; she walked before with her eldest son, the cow \r\nand the ass immediately behind them; the goat conducted by Jack \r\ncame next; the little monkey was seated on the back of his nurse, and \r\nmade a thousand grimaces. After the goats, came Ernest, conducting \r\nthe sheep, while I, in my capacity of general superintendant, \r\nfollowed behind and brought up the rear; the dogs for the most \r\npart paraded backwards and forwards, thus seeming to play the \r\npart of adjutants. Our march was slow, and there was something \r\nsolemn and patriarchal in the spectacle we exhibited; I fancied we \r\nmust resemble our forefathers journeying in the deserts, accompanied \r\nby their families and their possessions. Now then, Fritz, cried \r\nI, you have the specimen you wished for of the patriarchal mode \r\nof life; what do you think of it? I like it much, father, replied \r\nhe: I never read the Bible without wishing I had lived in those \r\ngood times.\r\n\r\nAnd I too, said Ernest, I am quite delighted with it, I cannot \r\nhelp fancying myself not merely a patriarch but a Tartar, or \r\nan Arab, and that we are about to discover I know not how many \r\nnew and extraordinary things. Is it not true, father, that the \r\nTartars and the Arabs pass their lives in journeying from one \r\nplace to another, and carrying all they have about them?\r\n\r\nIt is certainly for the most part true, Ernest, replied I, and \r\nthey are denominated wandering tribes; but they generally perform \r\ntheir journeys attended by horses and camels, by means of which \r\nthey can proceed a little faster, than if, like us, they had \r\nonly an ass and a cow. For my part, I should not be sorry if \r\nI were quite sure that the pilgrimage we are now making, would \r\nbe our last.\r\n\r\nAnd I too am of your way of thinking, cried my wife, and I hope \r\nthat in our new abode we shall be so well satisfied with the \r\nshade of such luxuriant trees, that we shall not be inclined \r\nto rove. Let us, however, think as little as possible of the \r\nfatigue which seems to be our lot today, since tomorrow you will \r\nall be ready to thank me for having been the occasion of it.\r\n\r\nBe assured, my dear, said I, that we have adopted your plans, \r\nand endure the fatigue they occasion, with cheerfulness, and \r\nthat one and all, are already grateful to you for their future \r\nhappiness; which happiness will be still increased by the reflection, \r\nthat to your kind and anxious exertions it has been that we are \r\nindebted for it.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached our bridge, and advanced half way across it, \r\nwhen the sow for the first time took the fancy of joining us, \r\nand, by the uncouth and listless figure she made, contributed \r\nto the pictorial effect of our procession. At the moment of our \r\ndeparture, she had shown herself so restive and indocile, that \r\nwe had been compelled to leave her behind us; but when she saw \r\nthat we had all left the place, she set out voluntarily to overtake \r\nus: but she took care to apprize us, by her continual grunting, \r\nthat she disapproved of our migration.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the river, we experienced an inconvenience \r\nwholly unexpected. The nutritious aspect of the grass, which \r\ngrew here in profusion, was too strong a temptation for our animals, \r\nwho, unable to resist, strayed from us in every direction to \r\nfeed voluptuously upon it; so that, without the assistance of \r\nour dogs, we should not have been able to bring them back to \r\nthe line of our procession. These active creatures were of great \r\nuse to us on this occasion, and when every thing was restored \r\nto proper order, we were able to continue our journey. For fear \r\nhowever of a similar occurrence, I directed our march to the \r\nleft, along the sea side, where there was not a sufficient quantity \r\nof grass to attract them.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had we advanced a few steps on the sands, when our \r\ntwo dogs, which had stayed behind among the grass, set up a loud \r\nbarking, mixt at intervals with howling, as if they had been \r\nwounded, or were engaged in an encounter with some formidable \r\nanimal. Fritz in an instant lifted his gun to his cheek, and \r\nwas ready to fire; Ernest, always somewhat timid, drew back to \r\nhis mother’s side; Jack ran bravely after Fritz with his gun \r\nupon his shoulder; while I, fearing the dogs might be attacked \r\nby some dangerous wild beast, prepared myself to run to their \r\nassistance. But youth is always full of ardour; and in spite \r\nof all my exhortations that they would advance with caution, \r\nmy boys, eager for the event, made but three jumps to the place \r\nfrom which the noise proceeded. In an instant Jack had turned \r\nto meet me, clapping his hands and calling out, Come quickly, \r\nfather, come quickly, here is a monstrous porcupine!\r\n\r\nI soon reached the spot, and perceived that it was really as \r\nthey said, bating a little exaggeration. The dogs were running \r\nto and fro with bloody noses, about the animal; and when they \r\napproached too near him, he made a frightful noise, and darted \r\nhis quills so suddenly at them, that a great number had penetrated \r\nthe skins of our valiant dogs, and remained sticking in them; \r\nand it was no doubt the pain they occasioned, which made them \r\nhowl so violently.\r\n\r\nWhile we were looking on, Jack determined on an attack, which \r\nsucceeded marvellously well. He took one of the pistols which \r\nhe carried in his belt, and aimed it so exactly at the head of \r\nthe porcupine, that he fell dead the instant he fired, and before \r\nwe had a notion of what he was about. This success raised Jack \r\nto the height of joy and vanity; while Fritz, on the other hand, \r\nfelt a sensation of jealousy almost to shedding tears. Is it \r\nright, Jack, said he, that such a little boy as you, should venture \r\nto fire off a pistol in this manner? How easily might you have \r\nwounded my father or me, or one of the dogs, by so rash an action! \r\nOh yes, to be sure, and what do you suppose hindered me from \r\nseeing that you were all behind me? Do you think I fired without \r\ntaking care of that? Do you take me for an idiot? The porcupine \r\ncould tell you about that, brother Fritz, if he could but speak. \r\nMy first fire—pop—dead as a herring! This is something like, \r\nbrother Fritz, and you would be glad enough to have had such \r\na chance yourself!\r\n\r\nFritz only replied by a motion of his head. He was out of humour, \r\nbecause his younger brother had deprived him of the honour of \r\nthe day; and he sought a subject of complaint against him, as \r\nthe wolf did with the poor little lamb. Come, come, boys, said \r\nI, let me hear no envious speeches and no reproaches; luck for \r\none to-day, for another to-morrow; but all for the common good. \r\nJack was, perhaps, a little imprudent, but you must allow that \r\nhe showed both skill and courage; let us not therefore tarnish \r\nthe glory of his action. We now all got round the extraordinary \r\nanimal, on whom nature has bestowed a strong defence, by arming \r\nhis body, all over, with long spears. The boys were absolutely \r\nat a loss what means to use for carrying away his carcase. They \r\nthought of dragging it along the ground; but as often as they \r\nattempted to take hold, there was nothing but squalling, and \r\nrunning to show the marks made by his quills on their hands. \r\nWe must leave him behind, said they; but it is a great pity.\r\n\r\nNot for an empire, cried Jack, shall he be left there, for my \r\nmother must have a sight of him. In saying this, he tied one \r\ncorner of his handkerchief round the neck of the animal, and \r\ndrew him by the other to the place where we had left his mother \r\nin care of our possessions, and who had been in great uneasiness \r\nat our long absence.\r\n\r\nHere is the monster, mother, said he, armed with his hundred \r\nthousand spears; but I was a match for him, and at one fire too! \r\nHis flesh is excellent food; at least papa says so.\r\n\r\nErnest began, with his usual coolness, to examine the animal \r\nminutely. After having looked at him a long while, he said, He \r\nis a most singular animal; his mouth contains the _dentes incisores_, \r\nand his ears and feet are much like those of a man.\r\n\r\nAh! said Jack, if you had seen how he darted out all his quills \r\nagainst the dogs, and the noise they made, rattling one against \r\nanother! He is a most terrible creature; but what of that? I \r\ndid not mind going up to him, and I dispatched two or three balls \r\nat his head, and it was over with him in an instant!\r\n\r\nHe cannot be so terrible an animal, said Ernest, if it was so \r\neasy for a mere child to destroy him. _A mere child!_ replied \r\nJack, much mortified, and drawing up his head. It was plain that \r\nhis conquest had added half a foot to his height, in his own \r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nWhile the boys were disputing, my wife and I had hastened to \r\nrelieve the dogs, by drawing out the quills and examining their \r\nwounds. Having done this, we joined the group which surrounded \r\nthe porcupine; Jack taking upon him to do the honours, as if \r\nhe was showing the animal at a fair. Observe, cried he, what \r\na terrible creature it is! how long and hard his quills are! \r\nand see what strange feet he has! I am sure he must have run \r\nlike a hare: but I killed him for all that! And what a singular \r\nsort of crest he has on his head! Upon my word, I like my day’s \r\nwork vastly.\r\n\r\nThat, said I, is the reason why naturalists call him the crested \r\nporcupine. But now tell me, my young hero, were you not afraid, \r\nin going so near him, that he would dart some of his quills at \r\nyou?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Oh no, papa, I knew that the stories about his quills, \r\nwere merely fabulous.\r\n\r\n_Father._—But you saw that many of them had stuck in the dogs, \r\nand this, surely, was no fable.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—That was because the dogs attacked the animal furiously \r\nfrom behind, thus putting themselves exactly in the way of his \r\nquills, so that it is not extraordinary that they should be wounded \r\nby them; but I took care to attack him in front, in which direction \r\nI knew he would not shoot them, so I had no reason to be afraid. \r\nIs it not also a fable, father, that when they escape the hunter, \r\nthey throw their quills as they run, and sometimes kill him with \r\nthem?\r\n\r\n_Father._—This account is, I believe, in a great measure untrue; \r\nbut it is not improbable that it was such an occurrence as we just \r\nnow met with, which first gave rise to the notion. An observation \r\nno less singular than true, has been made, that natural history, \r\nwhose basis ought to be the strictest truth, has given birth \r\nto more fables than mythology itself. In general, mankind are fond \r\nof the marvellous, and the composed march of nature is uninteresting \r\nto them, from its simple uniformity. They accordingly dress her with \r\nall the singularities and extravagancies of their own imaginations. \r\nBut tell me, Jack, what you mean to do with your prize? Are we \r\nto take it with us, or leave it here?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Oh, take it with us, take it with us, father, I entreat, \r\nfor you say its flesh is good to eat.\r\n\r\nI could not resist his pressing importunity, and I resolved to \r\nlay the porcupine on the back of the ass, behind little Francis, \r\nfirst having wrapped his bloody head in a quantity of grass, \r\nand then rolled him up in a blanket to protect my boy from his \r\nquills. We now resumed our journey, but had not proceeded far, \r\nwhen the ass began to kick furiously with his hind legs; tore \r\nhimself away from my wife, who was guiding him, and set off full \r\ngallop, braying so loud, as almost to deafen us, and scampering \r\nfrom side to side in so extraordinary a way, that the boys were \r\nthrown into fits of laughter; in which my wife and I should probably \r\nhave joined, if we had not conceived the idea, that the situation \r\nof our little Francis was not quite safe. A sign we made to the \r\ndogs, made them set off like lightning after the deserter, whom \r\nthey in a moment overtook, and stopped his way with a tremendous \r\nbarking. They would no doubt have attacked him violently, if \r\nwe had not ourselves run quickly to the spot, to intimidate them. \r\nWe took our boy from the ass’s back, delighted to find that (thanks \r\nto the care I had taken in tying him on securely) he had kept \r\nhis seat, and had scarcely even experienced any alarm. But tell \r\nme, Francis, said I jocosely, have you been clapping spurs to \r\nyour horse, or what have you done to make him set off on a gallop \r\nin this manner? I no sooner pronounced these words, than suddenly \r\nI recollected the porcupine. I immediately examined if the quills \r\nhad not penetrated through the covering in which I wrapped it: \r\nthis I found to be the very thing: though I had folded it three \r\ntimes double, the quills had pierced through all, and produced \r\nthe effect of the sharpest spur on the poor animal. I soon found \r\na remedy for this inconvenience, by placing my wife’s enchanted \r\nbag, which was filled with articles of a nature to be absolutely \r\nimpenetrable, between the ass’s back and the dead animal. I now \r\nrestored Francis to his place, exhorting him to keep in an upright \r\nposture, and we then resumed our journey.\r\n\r\nFritz had run on before with his gun, hoping he should meet with \r\nsome animal of prey. What he most desired, was to find one or \r\ntwo of those large bustards which his mother had described to \r\nhim. We followed him at our leisure, taking care not to expose \r\nour health by unnecessary fatigue; till at last, without further \r\naccident or adventure, we arrived at the place of the giant trees. \r\nSuch, indeed, we found them, and our astonishment exceeded all \r\ndescription. Good heavens! what trees! what a height! what trunks! \r\nI never heard of any so prodigious! exclaimed one and all. Nothing \r\ncan be more rational than your admiration, answered I, measuring \r\nthem with my eyes as I spoke. I must confess I had not myself \r\nformed an idea of the reality. To you be all the honour, my dear \r\nwife, for the discovery of this agreeable abode, in which we \r\nshall enjoy so many comforts and advantages. The great point \r\nwe have to gain, is the fixing a tent large enough to receive \r\nus all, in one of these trees, by which means we shall be perfectly \r\nsecure from the invasion of wild beasts. I defy even one of the \r\nbears, who are so famous for mounting trees, to climb up by a \r\ntrunk so immense, and so destitute of branches.\r\n\r\nWe began now to release our animals from their burdens, having \r\nfirst thrown our own on the grass. We next used the precaution \r\nof tying their two fore legs together with a cord, that they \r\nmight not go far away, or lose themselves. We restored the fowls \r\nto liberty; and then, seating ourselves upon the grass, we held \r\na family council on the subject of our future establishment. \r\nI was myself somewhat uneasy on the question of our safety during \r\nthe ensuing night; for I was ignorant of the nature of the extensive \r\ncountry I beheld around me, and of what chance there might be of \r\nour being attacked by different kinds of wild beasts. I accordingly \r\nobserved to my wife, that I would make an endeavour for us all \r\nto sleep in the tree that very night. While I was deliberating \r\nwith her on the subject, Fritz, who thought of nothing but his \r\nsporting, and of his desire to take his revenge of the porcupine \r\nadventure, had stolen away to a short distance, and we heard \r\nthe report of a gun. This would have alarmed me, if, at the same \r\nmoment, we had not recognised Fritz’s voice crying out, I touched \r\nhim! I touched him! and in a moment we saw him running towards \r\nus, holding a dead animal of uncommon beauty by the paws. Father, \r\nfather, look, here is a superb tiger cat, said he, proudly raising \r\nit in the air, to show it to the best advantage. Bravo! bravo! \r\ncried I; bravo, Nimrod the undaunted! Your achievement will call \r\nforth the unbounded gratitude of our cocks and hens and pigeons, \r\nfor you have rendered them what no doubt they will think an important \r\nservice. If you had not killed this animal, he would no doubt \r\nhave destroyed in the course of one night our whole stock of \r\npoultry. I charge you look about in every direction, and try \r\nto destroy as many of the species as fall in your way, for we \r\ncannot have more dangerous intruders.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I wish, father, you would be so good as to tell me \r\nwhy God created wild beasts, since man seems to be appointed \r\nto destroy them?\r\n\r\n_Father._—This indeed is a question I cannot answer, and we must \r\nbe contented with taking care to arm ourselves against them: \r\nneither can I explain to you, why many other things, which to \r\nus appear to have only injurious qualities, have been created. \r\nWith respect to beasts of prey, I am inclined to believe, that \r\none of the ends of Providence, in giving them existence, is their \r\nembellishing and varying the works of the creation; of maintaining \r\na necessary equilibrium among creatures endowed with life; and \r\nlastly, to furnish man, who comes naked into the world, with \r\nmaterials for protecting him from the cold, by the use of their \r\nskins, which become the means of exchange and commerce between \r\ndifferent nations. We may also add, that the care of protecting \r\nhimself from the attacks of ferocious animals, invigorates the \r\nphysical and moral powers of man, supports his activity, and \r\nrenders him inventive and courageous. The ancient Germans, for \r\nexample, were rendered robust and valiant warriors, through their \r\nhabitual exercises in the field, which enabled them, at a time \r\nof need, to defend their country and their liberty, with as little \r\ndifficulty, as they would have experienced in killing a wolf \r\nor a bear.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—But what do you say of the insects, which feed on living \r\nhuman flesh, and who neither contribute their skins for the wants \r\nof man, nor to his health by exciting him to pursue them in the \r\nfield? Of what use are such creatures as these?\r\n\r\n_Father._—They serve, my son, to exercise his patience, and to \r\ncompel him to a constant cleanliness, which contributes to a \r\nperfect state of health. But let us return to the animal Fritz \r\nhas killed. Tell me all the particulars of your adventure. How \r\ndid you kill him?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—With my pistol, father, as Jack killed the porcupine.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Was he on this tree, just by us?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Yes, father, I had been observing that something moved \r\namong the branches. I went softly as near as I could; and on \r\nseeing him, I knew him for a tiger cat. I immediately fired, \r\nwhen he fell at my feet wounded and furious; and then I fired \r\na second time, and killed him.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You were very fortunate in escaping thus, for he might \r\neasily have devoured you. You should always take care, in aiming \r\nat animals of this kind, to be at a greater distance.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Why so, father? I might have missed him if I had been \r\nfurther off. I, on the contrary, tried to be as near him as possible, \r\nand fired close to his ears.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This was acting in the same way as your brother Jack, \r\nwhom you so much derided for his want of care, and may serve \r\nyou as a lesson not to blame in your brothers, what you would \r\nyourself be perhaps obliged to do in the same situation; and \r\nnot to interrupt their joy with unkind reflections, but rather \r\nto partake with them the pleasure of their success.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Well, father; all I now ask of Jack is, that he will \r\nbe so good as not to spoil the beautiful skin of this animal, \r\nas he did that of the jackall. Only observe what beautiful figures \r\nit is marked with, and the fine effect of the black and yellow \r\nspots; the most richly manufactured stuff could not exceed it \r\nin magnificence. What is the exact name of the animal?\r\n\r\n_Father._—You may for the present give it the name of the tiger \r\ncat. I do not, however, think that it is the animal which is \r\nso denominated at the Cape of Good Hope; I rather think it is \r\nthe margay, a native of America, an animal of extremely vicious \r\ndispositions and singular voraciousness; he destroys all the \r\nbirds of the forest, and neither a man, a sheep, or goat, that \r\nshould fall in his way, could escape his rapacity. In the name \r\nof humanity, therefore, we ought to be thankful to you, for having \r\ndestroyed so formidable an enemy.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—All the recompense I ask, father, is, that you will \r\nlet me keep the skin; and I wish you would tell me what use I \r\ncan make of it.\r\n\r\n_Father._—One idea occurs to me, and it is this:—you must skin \r\nthe animal yourself, taking the greatest care not to injure it \r\nin the operation, particularly those parts which cover the fore \r\nlegs and the tail. If you will do this, you may make yourself \r\na belt with it, like your brother Jack’s, except that it will \r\nbe much more beautiful. The odd pieces will serve admirably to \r\nmake some cases to contain our utensils for the table, such as \r\nknives, forks, spoons; and as they will be light, we can easily \r\ncarry them about with us, should we make any further excursions. \r\nIt is not amiss, in such a situation as ours, to exercise ourselves \r\nin all kinds of trades and manual labour, and to do every thing \r\nwith the utmost care, and in the best manner possible. Man, the \r\nlord of the creation, should always aim at perfection. Go, then, \r\nboy, and put away its bloody head, and we will see how to set \r\nabout preparing the skin.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—And I too, father, will make some cases with the skin \r\nof my porcupine.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And why should you not, my boy? The skin of the tiger \r\ncat, can only furnish us with four, and we ought to have six \r\nat least, which will be one a-piece. So set to work, and show \r\nus quickly what you can perform. I should like for you to preserve \r\nsome of the quills of your porcupine for me; for I think I can \r\ncontrive to convert them into packing-needles, or into arrows; \r\nand what bits of skin are left, may serve to repair the dogs’ \r\ncollars when they begin to wear; or, which would be a masterpiece \r\nof invention, might be joined together and made into a sort of \r\ncoat of mail, as a protection to them when they have to encounter \r\nwild beasts.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Oh! yes, father, I will make the coat of mail, the coat \r\nof mail! Ernest, Fritz, did you hear what papa said? Why, our \r\ndogs will look like a couple of knights of chivalry. The idea \r\nis most excellent; how I shall like to see them with a coat of \r\nmail!\r\n\r\nThe boys left me no moment of repose till I had shown them how \r\nto take off the skins of the animals without tearing them. In \r\nthe mean while, Ernest looked about for a flat stone as a sort \r\nof foundation for a fire-place, and little Francis collected some \r\npieces of dry wood for his mother to light a fire. Ernest was \r\nnot long in finding what he wanted, and then he ran to join us \r\nand give us his assistance, or rather to reason right or wrong \r\non the subject of skinning animals; and then on that of trees; \r\nmaking various comments and inquiries, respecting the real name \r\nof those we intended to inhabit. It is my opinion, said he, that \r\nthey are really and simply, enormously large hazel trees; see \r\nif the leaf is not of exactly the same form. But that is no proof, \r\ninterrupted I; for many trees bear leaves of the same shape, \r\nbut nevertheless are of different kinds. Besides, it appears \r\nto me, that there is not so great a resemblance as you think, \r\nbetween the leaves of the trees which grow here, and those of \r\nthe hazel, the former being of a paler colour, and white underneath. \r\nI recollect too, that there is the wild mango and also the fig-tree, \r\nwhose roots grow in the same manner as our giant trees, forming \r\na beautiful arch, and sometimes reaching to an immeasurable height.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I thought, father, that the mango tree only grew on \r\nthe sea-shore, and in marshy soils?\r\n\r\n_Father._—You were not mistaken; it is the black mango tree which \r\nloves the water. But there is, besides, the red mango, which \r\nbears its fruit in bunches, something like our currant bushes. \r\nThis kind of the mango tree, is found at a considerable distance \r\nfrom the sea, and its wood is used for dyeing red. There is a \r\nthird sort, which is called the mountain mango, or yellow wood, \r\nand this is the kind, whose roots produce the beautiful arches \r\nyou now see around us.\r\n\r\nWe conversed thus as we proceeded with our work; for it was always \r\nmy endeavour to compensate to my children, as much as I was able, \r\nour want of books for their instruction. Little Francis presently \r\ncame running loaded with dry branches for his mother, with his \r\nmouth crammed full of something, and calling out, Mamma, mamma, \r\nI have found a nice fruit to eat, and I have brought you home \r\nsome of it!\r\n\r\nLittle glutton! replied his mother quite alarmed, what have you \r\ngot there? For Heaven’s sake, do not swallow, in this imprudent \r\nmanner, the first thing that falls in your way; for by this means \r\nyou may be poisoned, and then you would die. She made him open \r\nhis mouth, and took out with her finger, what he was eating with \r\nso keen a relish. With some difficulty she drew out the remains \r\nof a fig. A fig! exclaimed I: where did you find it? Thank God, \r\nthis is no poison! But nevertheless, remember, Francis, that \r\nyou are never to put any thing into your mouth, without first \r\nshowing it to your mother or to me. And now you may tell us where \r\nyou got this fig.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—I got it among the grass, papa; and there are a great \r\nmany more. I thought it must be good to eat, for the fowls and \r\nthe pigeons, and even the pig, came to the place and ate them \r\nin large quantities.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You see then, my dear, said I to my wife, that our \r\nbeautiful trees are fig-trees, at least the kind which are thus \r\nnamed at the Antilles; for they do not in the least resemble \r\nthe tree called by that name in Europe, except that they both \r\nbear a fruit having some little resemblance to each other. I \r\nnow recollect that the leaves of the mango tree are of a round \r\nform, and not oval like these. I took this occasion to give the \r\nboys another lesson, on the necessity of being cautious in an \r\nunknown country, and never to venture on tasting any thing they \r\nmet with, till they had seen it eaten by birds and monkeys. At \r\nthe word monkeys, they all ran to visit the little orphan, whom \r\nthey found seated on a root of a tree, and examining with the \r\noddest grimaces and the most singular expression of curiosity, \r\nthe half-skinned porcupine and the tiger cat, which lay near \r\nhim. Francis offered him a fig, which he first turned round and \r\nround, then smelled at it, and concluded by eating it voraciously. \r\nBravo, bravo! Mr. Monkey, exclaimed the boys, clapping their \r\nhands; so then these figs are good to eat! Thank you, Mr. Monkey; \r\nfor, after your wise decision, we shall make a charming feast \r\non them.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, my wife had been employed in making a fire, \r\nin putting on the pot, and preparing for our dinner. She had \r\nput a large piece of the porcupine into it, and the rest she \r\nhad laid in salt for another time. The tiger cat was bestowed \r\nupon the dogs, who waited impatiently to receive it. While our dinner \r\nwas dressing, I employed my time in making some packing-needles \r\nwith the quills of the porcupine. I put the point of a large \r\nnail into the fire till it was red hot; then taking hold of it \r\nwith some wet linen in my hand, by way of guard, I with great \r\nease perforated the thick end of the quills with it. I had soon \r\nthe pleasure of presenting my wife with a large packet of long, \r\nstout, needles, which were the more valuable in her estimation, \r\nas she had formed the intention of contriving some better harnessing \r\nfor our animals, and had been perplexed how to set about them \r\nwithout some larger needles. I, however, recommended to her to \r\nbe frugal in her use of the packthread, for which I should soon \r\nhave so urgent a need, in constructing a ladder for ascending \r\nthe tree we intended to inhabit. I had singled out the highest \r\nand thickest fig-tree; and while we were waiting for dinner, \r\nI made the boys try how high they could throw their sticks and \r\nstones in it. I also tried myself; but the very lowest branches \r\nwere so far from the ground, that none of us could touch them. \r\nI perceived, therefore, that we should be under the necessity \r\nof inventing some method to reach so far, as, otherwise, it would \r\nbe impossible to fasten the ends of my ladder to them. I allowed \r\na short pause to my imagination on the subject, during which \r\nI assisted Jack and Fritz in carrying the skins of the two animals \r\nto the adjacent stream, where we confined them under water with \r\nsome large stones. By this time we were called to dinner, and \r\nwe all partook with pleasure of our porcupine, which had produced \r\nan excellent soup, and had no fault but being a little hard. \r\nMy wife, however, could not prevail upon herself to eat of it; \r\nwhich occasioned Jack, who did the honours of the dish, a little \r\nmortification. My wife could not be brought to relent, but made \r\nher dinner on a slice of ham and some bread and cheese, under \r\nthe shade of the trees which she had so much desired, and where \r\nshe found the plainest repast delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. \r\n\r\n_Construction of a ladder._\r\n\r\nOur repast being ended, I observed to my wife, that I did not \r\nthink it would be possible for us to sleep that night in the \r\ntree, and that we should therefore be obliged to lie on the ground. \r\nI however desired her immediately to begin preparing the harness \r\nfor the animals, that they might go to the sea-shore and fetch \r\nthe pieces of wood, and such articles as I might find necessary \r\nfor enabling us to ascend the tree, if, contrary to my expectation, \r\nit should be found practicable. She lost not a moment in beginning \r\nher work; while I, in the mean time, set about suspending our \r\nhammocks to some of the arched roots of the trees, which I considered \r\nwould be more convenient for passing the night than on the ground. \r\nI next spread a piece of sail-cloth large enough to cover them, \r\nto preserve us from the dew and from the insects. Having thus \r\nmade the best provision I could for my family, I hastened with \r\nthe two eldest boys, to the sea-shore, to examine what pieces \r\nof wood might have been thrown up by the waves, and to choose \r\nout such as were most proper for the steps of my ladder. The \r\ndry branches of the fig-tree I would not use, for they appeared \r\nto me too fragile for the purpose; and I had not observed any \r\nother kind of wood growing near, that was sufficiently solid. \r\nThere were, no doubt, on the sands, numberless pieces, the quality \r\nof which was fit for my object; but, unfortunately, there was \r\nnone that would not require considerable labour to be adapted \r\nto my purpose; and thus my undertaking would have experienced \r\na considerable delay, if Ernest had not been lucky enough to \r\ndiscover a number of bamboo canes in a sort of bog, where they \r\nlay half covered with sand and mud. I took them out, and, with \r\nthe boys’ assistance, completely cleared them from the dirt; \r\nand stripping off their leaves to examine them, I found to my \r\ngreat joy that they were precisely what I wanted. I then instantly \r\nbegan to cut them, with my hatchet, in pieces of four or five \r\nfeet long; the boys bound them together in faggots proportioned \r\nto their strength for carrying them, and we prepared to return \r\nwith them to our place of abode. I next secured some of the straight \r\nand most slender of the stalks, to make some arrows with, of \r\nwhich I knew I should stand in need. At some distance from the \r\nplace where we stood, I perceived a sort of thicket, in which \r\nI hoped I might find some young twigs, which I thought might \r\nalso be useful to me; I determined, however, first to examine \r\nthem. We proceeded to the spot; but apprehending it might be \r\nthe retreat of some dangerous reptile, or animal, we held our \r\nguns in readiness. Ponto, who had accompanied us, went before. \r\nWe had hardly reached the thicket, when we observed him make \r\nseveral jumps, and throw himself furiously into the middle of \r\nthe bushes; when instantly a troop of large-sized flamingoes* \r\nsprang out, and with a loud rustling noise mounted into the air. \r\nFritz, always too ready with his gun, instantly fired, when two \r\nof the birds fell down among the bushes: one of them was quite \r\ndead, but the other was only slightly wounded in the wing: he \r\nsoon got upon his feet, and giving himself a shake, and finding \r\nthat he could not fly, he began to make use of his long legs, \r\nand to run so fast towards the water, that we were afraid he \r\nwould escape us. Fritz, in the joy of his heart, ran to pick up \r\nthe flamingo he had killed; he plunged up to his knees in the \r\nwater, and with great difficulty was able to get out again; while \r\nI, warned by his example, proceeded more cautiously in my pursuit \r\nof the wounded bird. Ponto came to my assistance, for without \r\nhim I should have lost all trace of the animal; but he ran on \r\nbefore, caught hold of the flamingo, and held him fast till I \r\nreached the spot, and took him into my protection. All this was \r\neffected with considerable trouble; for the bird made a stout \r\nresistance, flapping its wings with violence for some time. However, \r\nat last I succeeded in securing him.\r\n\r\n* Flamingo is a species of bird between the web-footed genus \r\nand the waders; it takes its name from the singular colour of \r\nits plumage, being of a bright flame-coloured red. This bird \r\nis to be found both in the old and the new continent; in the \r\nold continent, only in the southern climates; and in the new, \r\nno-where to the north of Carolina. The flamingo is a gregarious \r\nanimal, frequenting the sea-shore and the marshes occasionally \r\ncovered by the sea. When the flamingo sets out upon a fishing \r\nexpedition, the birds range themselves in file, so as, at a distance, \r\nto produce the appearance of an extended line of soldiers; nor \r\ndo they employ this arrangement only when they seek their prey, \r\nbut also in a state of repose. Sometimes, however, a flamingo \r\nmay be found alone, or with only a single companion, especially \r\nwhen at a distance from the sea. When drawn up in their military \r\narray, there are always sentinels fixed, who, in case of alarm, \r\nutter a loud cry capable of being heard at a great distance, \r\nand considerably resembling the sound of a trumpet: the sentinel \r\nthen takes wing, and all the others follow: but whenever it is \r\npossible to come upon a flock of flamingoes without being observed \r\nby the sentinel, it is easy to pounce upon them and kill a great \r\nnumber. The report of a musket never induces them to take wing, \r\nbut rather stupifies them; and they remain immovable, with their \r\neyes fixed on the sportsman. They avoid all inhabited places, \r\nand live on the small fry of fish, or shell-fish, and on insects \r\nthat they find in the mud, into which they plunge their long \r\nand singular beak. The flamingo builds its nest on the ground, \r\nand generally in marshes; they scrape the mud into a heap with \r\ntheir feet, so as to make little hillocks of a conical figure, \r\nand a foot and a half in height; the hillock is a little hollowed \r\nat the top; and in this hollow the female lays two or three eggs \r\nat most, upon which she sits; her legs, which are very long, \r\nresting upon the level ground, or plunged Into the water, while \r\nwith the back part of her body she keeps the eggs in a proper \r\nstate of warmth. The egg of the flamingo is white, and of the \r\nsize of a goose’s egg, but more elliptical. The young ones run \r\nwith inexpressible quickness in a few days after their birth, \r\nbut do not begin to fly till they have acquired their full size. \r\nTheir plumage is at first of a pale gray approaching to white; \r\nit grows redder as the young flamingo increases in age; but nearly \r\na year elapses before this bird reaches its full stature; at \r\nwhich time it first shews its robe of a brilliant flame colour. \r\nThe carnation hue first appears on the wing, which is always \r\nof the brightest tint; it then extends to the rump, and afterwards \r\nshows itself upon the back and breast, and as far as the neck, \r\nwhich is of a delicate rose colour. The flamingo is considered \r\nas a delicate morsel for the table, having some resemblance to \r\nthe partridge in flavour: the tongue, which is very large, is \r\nparticularly esteemed. They differ in stature, largeness, and \r\ncolour; but this difference depends upon the age of the animal: \r\nwhen in full growth, the flamingo is more than four feet long \r\nfrom the beak to the tail, and neatly six feet high to the extremity \r\nof the talons. The neck and legs are extremely long; the plumage \r\nvaries in colour on the different parts of the body, from a bright \r\nvermilion to a beautiful rose colour, and the legs and feet are \r\nof the same tint. There are however a few black feathers in each \r\nwing; the beak in some is red, and in others yellow; but the \r\nextremity in all is black. _Noueveau Dictionnaire d’Historie \r\nNaturelle._\r\n\r\nFritz was not long in extricating himself from the swamp; he \r\nnow appeared holding the dead flamingo by the feet: but I had \r\nmore trouble in the care of mine, as I had a great desire to \r\npreserve him alive. I had tied his feet and his wings with my \r\nhandkerchief; notwithstanding which, he still continued to flutter \r\nabout to a distressing degree, and tried to make his escape. \r\nI held the flamingo under my left arm, and my gun in my right \r\nhand. I made the best jumps I was able, to get to the boys, but \r\nat the risk of sinking every moment into the mud, which was extremely \r\ndeep, and from which it would have been difficult to have released \r\nme. Attracted by the love of sporting, I had made my way through \r\nthese dangerous places, scarcely observing their existence; but \r\nnow, on my return, I shuddered on perceiving the danger to which \r\nI had exposed myself.\r\n\r\nThe joy of the boys was excessive, when they saw that my flamingo \r\nwas alive. If we can but cure his wound and contrive to feed \r\nhim, what a happiness it will be! said they. Do you think that \r\nhe will like to be with the other fowls?\r\n\r\nI know, answered I, that he is a bird that may be easily tamed; \r\nand we will make our experiment upon him: but he will not thank \r\nyou for such food as we give our fowls; he will make his humble \r\npetition to you for some small fish, a few worms, or insects.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Our river will furnish him with all these; Jack and \r\nFrancis can catch as many as he will want; and very soon, with \r\nsuch long legs as he has, he may learn the way to the river and \r\nfind them for himself.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I hope you will take great care of him, for I have \r\na great desire to preserve him.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—How delightful it will be, if we can catch some other \r\nsorts of wild birds, and have a yard to keep them in! But look, \r\nfather, he is web-footed like aquatic birds, while his legs are \r\nlong like the stork: is not this rare and extraordinary?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Not at all: many other birds, as well as the flamingo, \r\npossess the double faculty of running and of swimming.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—But, father, are all flamingoes like this, of such \r\na beautiful red colour, and the wings so exquisitely tinted with \r\npurple? I think I have seen the flamingo in my Natural History, \r\nand the colours were not like these: so perhaps this is not a \r\nflamingo at last?\r\n\r\n_Father._—I believe it is a flamingo, Ernest, and that this \r\ndifference in the plumage denotes the age of the bird: when very \r\nyoung they are gray, at a more advanced age they are white; and it \r\nis only when they are full grown, that they are adorned with this \r\nbeautifully tinted plumage.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—This dead one, then, is an old fellow, and I am afraid \r\nby his colours that he will make but a tough dish: shall we not \r\ntake him home to mamma?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Yes, certainly. I leave to you the care of carrying \r\nhim, in the best manner you can: in the mean time, I shall repeat my \r\nvisit to the canes, for I have not done with them yet. I accordingly \r\nselected, now, some of the oldest of the stalks, and cut from \r\nthem their hard-pointed ends, which I had well considered would \r\nserve for the tips of my arrows, for which they are also used \r\nby the savages of the Antilles. Lastly, I looked for two of the \r\nlongest canes, which I cut, for the purpose of measuring the \r\nheight of our giant tree, about which I felt so deep an interest. \r\nWhen I told my sons the use I intended to make of the two longest \r\ncanes, they indulged themselves in a hearty laugh at me, and \r\nmaintained, that though I should lay ten such canes up the trunk \r\nof the tree, the last would not reach even the lowest branch. \r\nI requested they would oblige me by having a little patience; \r\nand I reminded them, that it was not long ago that they defied \r\ntheir mother to catch the fowls, because they themselves had \r\nnot known how to set about it.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done all I wanted, I began to think of returning. \r\nErnest took the charge of all the canes; Fritz carried the dead \r\nflamingo, and I took care of the living one. We had not gone \r\nfar, when Fritz, addressing himself to Ponto, said: Oho, lazy \r\nbones! so you think you are to be excused from any part of the \r\nburden; have the goodness to carry my flamingo on your back, \r\nwith the same politeness as your companion Turk observed, towards \r\nmy little monkey.\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he tied the dead bird upon his back, without \r\nthe least resistance from the patient animal.\r\n\r\nSo then, said I, Mr. Fritz intends to return quite at his ease, \r\nand without any part of our load, while his old father and his \r\nyoung brother carry each a heavy portion!\r\n\r\nYour reproach is very just, father, said the excellent lad; give \r\nme, I entreat you, your live bird, and I will take the greatest \r\ncare of him; only see if he does not already give me a kind look! \r\nand as for his long formidable beak, I am not the least afraid \r\nof it; he does not look as if he would bite me. That is the more \r\ngenerous on his part, replied I, for it was you who wounded him: \r\nbut it is a known fact, that animals are often of a less revengeful \r\nnature than man, and you will see that this bird will attach \r\nitself to you very strongly: saying this, I put the flamingo \r\ncarefully into his hands.\r\n\r\nWe were now returned to the spot where we had left the three \r\nbundles of bamboo-canes; and as my sons were sufficiently loaded, \r\nI took charge of them myself. Now you see, said I to Fritz, that in \r\nthis instance kindness is its own reward; if you had not undertaken \r\nthe care of the flamingo, you would have had to carry all these \r\nbundles, which are a much heavier load.\r\n\r\nWe were at length arrived once more at our giant trees, and were \r\nreceived with a thousand expressions of interest and kindness. \r\nWhy, what have you there, Ernest, that is so beautiful a red?—and, \r\nFritz, what is that in your handkerchief? All were delighted \r\nat the sight of our new conquests. My wife, with her accustomed \r\ndisposition to anxiety on our account, immediately asked where \r\nwe should get food enough for all the animals we brought home. \r\nYou should consider, said I, that some of them feed us, instead \r\nof being fed; and the one we have now brought you, need not give \r\nyou much uneasiness, if, as I hope, he proves able to find food \r\nfor himself without our interference. I now began to examine \r\nhis wound, and found that only one wing was injured by the ball, \r\nbut that the other had also been slightly wounded by the dog’s \r\nlaying hold of him. I anointed them both with an ointment I composed \r\nof a mixture of butter and wine for the purpose, and which seemed \r\nimmediately to ease the pain; I next tied him by one of his legs, \r\nwith a long string, to a stake I had driven into the ground, \r\nquite near to the stream, that he might go in and wash himself \r\nwhen he pleased.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, my little railers had tied the two longest \r\ncanes together, and were endeavouring to measure the tree with \r\nthem; but when they found that they reached no further than the \r\ntop of the arch formed by the roots, they all burst into immoderate \r\nfits of laughter, assuring me, that if I wished to measure the \r\ntree, I must think of some other means. I however sobered them \r\na little, by recalling to Fritz’s memory some lessons in geometry \r\nand land-surveying, which he had received in Europe, and that \r\nby means of these useful sciences, the measure of the highest \r\nmountains, and their distance from each other, may be ascertained \r\nby the application of triangles and supposed lines. I instantly \r\nproceeded to this kind of operation, fixing my canes in the ground, \r\nand making use of some string, which Fritz guided according to \r\nmy directions. I will not fatigue the reader with a minute account \r\nof the geometrical process I adopted, as a substitute for the \r\nproper instruments; it is sufficient to let him know, that the \r\nmeans I used, answered my purpose, and that I found that the \r\nheight of our tree was forty feet: this particular of its height \r\nI was obliged scrupulously to ascertain, before I could determine \r\nthe length of my ladder. I now set Fritz and Ernest to work, \r\nto measure our stock of thick ropes, of which I wanted no less \r\nthan eighty feet for the two sides of the ladder; the two youngest \r\nI employed in collecting all the small string we had used for \r\nmeasuring, and carrying it to their mother. For my own part, \r\nI sat down on the grass, and began to make some arrows with a \r\npiece of the bamboo, and the short sharp points of the canes \r\nI had taken such pains to secure. As the arrows were hollow, \r\nI filled them with moist sand, to give them a little weight; \r\nand lastly, I tipped them with a bit of feather from the flamingo, \r\nto make them fly straight. Scarcely had I finished my work, than \r\nthe boys came jumping round me, uttering a thousand demonstrations \r\nof joy: A bow, a bow, and some real arrows! cried they, addressing \r\neach other, and then running to me.—Tell us, father, continued \r\nthey, what you are going to do with them; do let me shoot one;—and \r\nme; and me too, cried one and all as fast as they could speak.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Have patience, boys; I say, have patience. This once \r\nI must claim the preference for myself, in order to make trial \r\nof my work, which I undertook rather for use than for amusement; \r\nso now I will try one of them. Have you, my dear, any strong \r\nthread? said I to my wife; I want some immediately. We shall \r\nsee, said she, what my enchanted bag, which has never yet refused \r\nits aid, can do for you. She then threw open its mouth. Come, \r\nsaid she, my pretty bag, give me what I ask you for; my husband \r\nwants some thread, and it must be very strong . . . . . See now, did \r\nI not promise you should have your wish? . . . . . See, here is a \r\nlarge ball of the very thread you want.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—But I do not see much magic, however, mother, in taking \r\nout of a bag, exactly what we had before put into it.\r\n\r\n_Father._—If we are to discuss the matter seriously, Ernest, \r\nI cannot but allow that your observation is a just one; but in \r\na moment of dreadful apprehension, such as we experienced on \r\nleaving the vessel, to think of a variety of little things that \r\nmight be useful to one or all of us, was an act that we may truly \r\ncall an enchantment; and it is a conduct, of which, only the \r\nbest of wives and the best of mothers could be capable: it is, \r\nthen, something like a truth, that your mother is a good fairy, \r\nwho constantly provides for all our wants: but you young giddy \r\nthings think little of the benefit you thus enjoy.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, Fritz joined us, having finished measuring \r\nthe string; he brought me the welcome tidings that our stock, \r\nin all, was about five hundred fathoms, which I knew to be more \r\nthan sufficient for my ladder. I now tied the end of the ball \r\nof strong thread to an arrow, and fixing it to the bow, I shot \r\nit off in such a direction, as to make the arrow pass under one \r\nof the largest branches of the tree, and fall again to the ground \r\nfrom the upper side of the same branch. By this method I lodged \r\nmy thread across the main branch, while I had the command of \r\nthe end and the ball below. It was now easy to tie a piece of \r\nrope to the end of the thread, and draw it upwards, till the \r\nknot should reach the same branch. We were thus enabled again \r\nto measure the height it was from the ground, and it again proved \r\nto be forty-feet, as had appeared by my former mode of measuring. \r\nHaving now made quite sure of being able to raise my ladder by \r\nmeans of the string already suspended, we all set to work with \r\nincreased zeal and confidence. The first thing I did was to cut \r\na length of about a hundred feet from my parcel of ropes, an \r\ninch thick; this I divided into two equal parts, which I stretched \r\nalong on the ground in two parallel lines, at the distance of \r\na foot from each other. I then directed Fritz to cut portions \r\nof sugar cane, each two feet in length. Ernest handed them to \r\nme, one after another; and as I received them, I inserted them \r\ninto my cords at the distance of twelve inches respectively; \r\nfixing them with knots in the cord, while Jack, by my order, \r\ndrove into each a long nail at the two extremities, to hinder \r\nthem from slipping out again. Thus in a very short time I had \r\nformed a ladder of forty rounds in length, and in point of execution \r\nfirm and compact, and which we all beheld with a sort of joyful \r\nastonishment. I now proceeded to fasten it firmly to one end \r\nof the rope, which hung from the tree, and pulled it by the other, \r\ntill one end of our ladder reached the branch, and seemed to \r\nrest so well upon it, that the joyous exclamations of the boys \r\nand my wife resounded from all sides. All the boys wished to \r\nbe the first to ascend upon it; but I decided that it should \r\nbe Jack, he being the nimblest and of the lightest figure among \r\nthem. Accordingly, I and his brothers held the end of the rope \r\nwith all our strength, while our young adventurer tripped up \r\nthe ladder with as much ease as if he were a cat, and presently \r\ntook his post upon the branch; but I observed that he had not \r\nstrength enough to tie the rope firmly to the tree. Fritz now \r\ninterfered, assuring me that he could ascend the ladder as safely \r\nas his brother: but, as he was much heavier, I was not altogether \r\nwithout apprehension. I gave him instructions how to step, in \r\nsuch a way as to divide his weight, by occupying four rounds \r\nof the ladder at the same time, with his feet and hands; I made \r\nhim take with him some large nails and a hammer, to nail the \r\nladder firmly to the branch. He set out courageously upon the \r\nundertaking, and was almost instantly side by side with Jack, \r\nforty-feet above our heads, and both saluting us with cries of \r\nexultation. Fritz immediately set to work to fasten the ladder, \r\nby passing the rope round and round the branch; and this he performed \r\nwith so much skill and intelligence, that I felt sufficient reliance \r\nto determine me to ascend myself, and well conclude the business \r\nhe had begun. But before I ascended, I tied a large pulley to \r\nthe end of the rope, and carried it with me. When I was at the \r\ntop, I fastened the pulley to a branch which was within my reach, \r\nthat by this means I might be able the next day to draw up the \r\nplanks and timbers I might want for building my aërial castle. I \r\nexecuted all this by the light of the moon, and felt the satisfaction \r\nof having done a good day’s work. I now gently descended my rope \r\nladder, and joined my wife and children.\r\n\r\nAs I found an inconvenience in being three of us together on the \r\nbranch, I had directed the boys to descend first. My astonishment, \r\ntherefore, on reaching the ground, and finding that neither Fritz \r\nnor Jack had made their appearance, it is easier to conceive than \r\nto describe; their mother, as she assured me, having seen nothing \r\nof them since they ascended the ladder. While I was endeavouring \r\nto conjecture where they could be, we suddenly heard the sound \r\nof voices which seemed to come from the clouds, and which chanted \r\nan evening hymn. I soon recognised the trick our young rogues \r\nhad played me; who seeing me busily employed in the tree, instead \r\nof descending as I had desired them, had climbed upwards from \r\nbranch to branch till they reached to the very top. My heart \r\nwas now lightened of my apprehensions for their safety, and I \r\ncalled out to them as loudly as I could, to take great care in \r\ncoming down. It was almost night, and the light of the moon scarcely \r\npenetrated the extreme thickness of the foliage. They presently \r\ndescended, and joined their anxious relations without any accident. \r\nI now directed them to assemble all our animals, and to get together \r\nwhat dry wood we should want for making fires, which I looked \r\nto as our defence against the attacks of wild beasts. I explained \r\nto them all my reasons for this, informing them that in Africa, \r\na country remarkable for its prodigious numbers of ferocious \r\nanimals, the natives secure themselves from their nocturnal visits, \r\nby lighting large fires, which all these creatures are known \r\nto dread and avoid.\r\n\r\nWhen these preparations were finished, my wife presented me with the \r\nday’s work she had performed; it was some traces and a breast-leather \r\neach for the cow and the ass. I promised her, as a reward for \r\nher zeal and exertion, that we should all be completely settled \r\nin the tree the following day. And now we began to think of our \r\nsupper, in which she and Ernest and little Francis had been busily \r\nand officiously engaged. Ernest had made two wooden forks, and \r\ndriven them into the ground to support a spit, upon which was \r\na large piece of the porcupine, which he kept turning at the \r\nfire. Another piece of the animal was boiling in the pot for \r\nsoup; and both together exhaled an odour which gave us an excellent \r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nAll our animals had now come round us, one after the other. My \r\nwife threw some grain to the fowls, to accustom them to assemble \r\nin a particular spot; and when they had eaten it, we had the \r\npleasure of seeing our pigeons take their flight to the top of \r\nthe giant tree, and the cocks and hens perching and settling \r\nthemselves, and cackling all the time, upon the rounds of the \r\nladder. The quadrupeds we tied to the arched roots of the tree, \r\nquite near to our hammocks, where they quietly lay down on the \r\ngrass to ruminate in tranquillity. Our beautiful flamingo was \r\nnot forgotten, Fritz having fed him with some crumbs of biscuit \r\nsoaked in milk, which he ate very heartily; and afterwards putting \r\nhis head under his right wing, and raising his left foot, he \r\nabandoned himself with confidence to sleep.\r\n\r\nAt last we had notice that our supper was served. We had laid \r\ntogether in different heaps, a quantity of dried branches and \r\npieces of wood, in readiness to light, when my wife summoned \r\nus to our meal, which we had waited for with impatience, and \r\nnow greedily devoured. My wife, still keeping her resolution \r\nof not tasting the porcupine, contented herself with the more \r\nsober fare of bread and cheese. The children brought us some \r\nfigs for the dessert, which they had picked up under the trees, \r\nand of which we all partook with pleasure. And now the gaping \r\nof one of the boys, and the out-stretched arms of another, gave \r\nus notice, that it was time for our young labourers to retire \r\nto rest. We performed our evening devotions. I set fire to several \r\nof the heaps, and then threw myself contentedly upon my hammock. \r\nMy young ones were already cased in theirs, and we were soon \r\ngreeted with their murmurs at being obliged to lie so close to \r\neach other, that they could not move their limbs. Ah, gentlemen, \r\ncried I, you must try to be contented; no sailor is ever better \r\naccommodated than you are now, and you must not expect beds to \r\ndrop from the clouds on your behalf! I then directed them how \r\nto put themselves in a more convenient posture, and to swing \r\ntheir hammock gently to and fro. And see, added I, if sleep will \r\nnot visit you as soon in a hammock, as on a bed of down. They \r\nprofited by my advice, and all, except myself, were soon asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. \r\n\r\n_The settling in the giant tree._\r\n\r\nI had thought it necessary to keep watch during this first night, \r\nfor the protection of my family. Every leaf that stirred, gave \r\nme the apprehension that it was the approach of a jackall or \r\na tiger, who might attack some member of my family. As soon as \r\none of the heaps was consumed, I lighted another; and at length, \r\nfinding that no animal appeared, I by degrees became assured, \r\nand at last fell into so sound a sleep, that I did not awake \r\nearly enough for the execution of my project for that day. The \r\nboys were all up and about me. We took our breakfast, and fell \r\nto our work. My wife, having finished her daily occupation of \r\nmilking the cow, and preparing the breakfast for the family, \r\nand for all the animals, set off with Ernest, Jack, and Francis, \r\nattended by the ass, to the sea-shore; they had no doubt of finding \r\nsome more pieces of wood, and they thought it would be prudent \r\nto replenish our exhausted store. In her absence, I ascended \r\nthe tree with Fritz, and made the necessary preparations for \r\nmy undertaking, for which I found it in every respect convenient; \r\nfor the branches grew extremely close to each other, and in an \r\nexactly horizontal direction. Such as grew in a manner to obstruct \r\nmy design, I cut off either with the saw or hatchet, leaving \r\nnone but what presented me with a sort of foundation for my work. \r\nI left those which spread themselves evenly upon the trunk, and \r\nhad the largest circuit, as a support for my floor. Above these, \r\nat the height of forty-six feet, I found others, upon which to \r\nsuspend our hammocks; and higher still, there was a further series \r\nof branches, destined to receive the roof of my tent, which for \r\nthe present was to be formed of nothing more than a large surface \r\nof sail-cloth.\r\n\r\nThe progress of these preparations was considerably slow. It \r\nwas necessary to raise certain beams to this height of forty \r\nfeet, that were too heavy for my wife and her little assistants \r\nto lift from the ground without great effort. I had, however, \r\nthe resource of my pulley, which served to excellent purpose. \r\nMy wife and her little boys fastened the beams to pieces of cord \r\nabove, while Fritz and I contrived to draw them up to the elevation \r\nof the tent one by one. When I had already placed two beams upon \r\nthe branches, I hastened to fix my planks upon them; and I made \r\nmy floor double, that it might have sufficient solidity if the \r\nbeams should be in any way warped from their places. I then formed \r\na wall something like a park-paling, all round, to prevent accidents \r\nto ourselves or children. This operation, and a third journey \r\nto the sea-shore to collect the timber necessary, filled our morning \r\nso completely, that not one of us had thought about dinner. For \r\nthis once it was requisite to be content with a simple provision \r\nof ham and milk. Dinner ended, we returned to work to finish \r\nour aërial palace, which now began to make an imposing appearance. \r\nWe unhooked our hammocks, &c. from the projecting roots from \r\nwhich they had at first been suspended; and, by means of my pulley, \r\ncontrived to hoist them up to our new habitation. The sail-cloth \r\nroof was supported by the thick branches above; and as it was \r\nof great compass, and hung down on every side, the idea occurred \r\nto me of nailing it to the paling on two sides, and thus getting \r\nnot only a roof, but two walls also; the immense trunk of the \r\ntree forming a third; while a fourth side contained the entrance \r\nof our apartment; and this I left entirely open, both as a means \r\nof seeing what passed without, and for admitting a current of \r\nair to cool us in this burning temperature. We also on this side \r\nenjoyed an extensive and uninterrupted view of the vast ocean, \r\nand its lengthening shore. The hammocks were soon suspended from \r\nthe branches above, and now every thing was ready for our reception \r\nthat very evening. Well satisfied with the execution of my plan, \r\nI descended with Fritz, who had assisted me throughout the whole; \r\nand as the day was not far advanced, and I observed we had still \r\nsome planks remaining, we set about contriving a large table to be \r\nplaced between the roots of the tree, and surrounded with benches; \r\nand this place, we said, should be called our dining-parlour. \r\nFor this time, we performed our task but slightly, for I confess \r\nI was much fatigued. The table, on the whole, however, was such as \r\nmight be well endured, and the view of it gave my wife considerable \r\nsatisfaction as she looked on, busied with preparations for our \r\nsupper. In the mean time, the three youngest boys collected all \r\nthe pieces of wood we had thrown down from the tree, and put \r\nthem together to dry in a heap, at a small distance from our \r\nfire-place. I also tied together a quantity of small wood which \r\nwe had collected, and which served to augment our store for making \r\nfires.\r\n\r\nEntirely exhausted by the fatigues of the day, I threw myself at \r\nfull length on a bank, saying to my wife, that as I had worked like \r\na galley-slave to-day, I should allow myself some rest to-morrow. \r\nMy wife answered, that not only I was entitled to a day of rest, \r\nbut that it was a duty incumbent on me to take it on the following \r\nday; for, said she, I have calculated that to-morrow is Sunday. \r\nUnfortunately we had already passed one sabbath-day without \r\nrecollecting that it was so.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I thank you, my dear, for making this discovery, and \r\nI promise you that the day shall be celebrated by us, as it ought \r\nto be. It was not unknown to me that we had passed over one Sunday \r\nwithout a due observance of the duties it imposes; but I confess \r\nit appeared to me, that being caused by the extraordinary exertions \r\nwe had to make for the preservation of our lives in a desert \r\nplace, to which it had pleased God to conduct us, it was a pardonable \r\nomission; but now that we seem to have surmounted many difficulties, \r\nand to have secured ourselves an habitation, we should indeed \r\nbe culpable not to celebrate in a solemn and particular manner, \r\nthe day he has consecrated to himself.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—Be assured, my dear, that I shall heartily join you \r\nin rendering thanks to God, who in so imminent a danger preserved \r\nall that was dear to me, and affords us here, in a strange and \r\ndesert land, not only the necessaries of life, but many of its \r\ncomforts also. I could no where have met with an habitation more \r\nto my fancy, than that you have effected for us in the tree. \r\nI will mount the ladder this evening with you, for I feel almost \r\na child’s joy at the idea of passing the night up in the air, \r\nas we may call it. Let us quickly eat our supper and go to bed, \r\nwithout dropping a word about its being Sunday to-morrow. It \r\nwill be a great pleasure to me to surprise the boys with the \r\nnews of a day of rest from labour, which they did not expect.\r\n\r\nAnd I, for my part, said I, am rejoiced to find you thus contented \r\nand resigned to your fate, and entertaining no contempt for our \r\nimperfect contrivances. But now let us see what you have prepared \r\nfor our reward; and let us call the children round us; I feel \r\nin want of such a restorative after my fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe little company was soon assembled round the table. Their \r\nmother followed, holding in her hand an earthen pot, which we \r\nhad before observed upon the fire, and the contents of which \r\nwe were all curious to be informed of. She took off the cover, \r\nand with a fork drew out of it the flamingo which Fritz had killed. \r\nShe informed us that she had preferred dressing it this way, \r\nto roasting, because Ernest had assured her that it was an old \r\nbird, which would prove hard and tough, and had advised her to \r\nimprove it by stewing. We rallied our glutton boy on this foible \r\nof his character, and his brothers gave him the name of the _cook_. \r\nWe, however, had soon reason to know, that he had conferred upon \r\nus an important obligation; for the bird, which roasted we perhaps \r\nshould not have been able to touch, now appeared excellent, and \r\nwas eaten up to the very bones.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus enjoying our repast, the live flamingo stalked \r\nup to the place where we were sitting, in the midst of our flock \r\nof fowls, to receive his part of the repast, little thinking \r\nthat it was his late companion that had furnished it. The live \r\nflamingo had now become so tame, that we had released him from \r\nthe stake. He took his walks gravely from place to place, and \r\nlooked perfectly contented with his company. His fine plumage \r\nwas a most pleasing sight; while, on the other hand, the sportive \r\ntricks and the grimaces of our little monkey, afforded the most \r\nagreeable spectacle imaginable. The little animal had become \r\nquite familiar with us; jumped from the shoulder of one to that \r\nof another; always caught adroitly the meat we threw him, and \r\nate it in so pleasant a way as to make us laugh heartily. To \r\nincrease our merriment, the old sow, which hitherto had shown \r\nan unconquerable aversion to our society, and which we had missed \r\nfor two whole days, was now seen advancing towards us, grunting \r\nat every step. For this time, however, her grunting indicated \r\nher joy at having found us once more: and the joy was mutual; \r\nof which my wife gave her a substantial proof, by serving her \r\ninstantly with what remained of our daily allowance of milk.\r\n\r\nI confess I thought her a little too generous, till she explained \r\nto me that it was necessary to contrive some utensils proper \r\nfor making butter and cheese, and that till this was done, it \r\nwas better to turn the milk to profit in this way, than, in so \r\nhot a climate, to let it be spoiled. And it was the more necessary, \r\nshe added, as our grain began to run short, and that, as pigs \r\nare very fond of milk, it might be a means of preventing her \r\nwandering from us again.\r\n\r\nI always find you right, my dear, said I. It shall not be long \r\nere we again undertake another visit to the vessel, to fetch \r\na new provision of grain for your poultry.\r\n\r\nAgain the subject of the vessel, said she, with a sort of reproachful \r\nregret; I shall never enjoy a moment’s happiness till it is gone \r\nto the bottom, and you shall have entirely banished it from your \r\nthoughts! You never make a voyage that does not leave me filled \r\nwith agonizing alarm for your safety.\r\n\r\nI cannot deny, replied I, that there may be some reason for this; \r\nbut I must remind you that we always choose a day of calm and \r\nsettled weather for our excursion; and in my opinion we should \r\nbe unpardonable, if we allowed ourselves to be so subdued by \r\ncauseless alarms, as to neglect the means of obtaining a variety \r\nof useful things, which Providence seems to have reserved for \r\nour use.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, the boys, by my direction, had lighted \r\none of the heaps of wood for the protection of our animals. This \r\nbeing done, we tied long ropes loosely round the necks of our \r\ndogs, purposing to mount to our tent with the ends in my hand, \r\nthat I might be able to let them loose upon the enemy at the \r\nfirst barking I should hear. Every one was now eager to retire \r\nto rest, and the signal for ascending the ladder, was given. \r\nThe three eldest boys were up in an instant; then came their \r\nmother’s turn, who proceeded slowly and cautiously, and arrived \r\nin perfect safety. My own ascension was the last, and the most \r\ndifficult; for I carried little Francis on my back, and the end \r\nof the ladder had been loosened at the bottom, that I might be \r\nable to draw it up in the tent during the night: every step, \r\ntherefore, was made with the greatest difficulty, in consequence \r\nof its swinging motion. At last, however, I got to the top, and, \r\nto the admiration of the boys, drew the ladder after me. It appeared \r\nto them that we were in one of the strong castles of the ancient \r\nchevaliers, in which, when the draw-bridge is raised, the inhabitants \r\nare secured from every attack of the enemy. Notwithstanding this \r\napparent safety, I kept our guns in readiness for whatever event \r\nmight require their use. We now abandoned ourselves to repose; \r\nour hearts experienced a full tranquillity; and the fatigue we \r\nhad all undergone, induced so sound a sleep, that day-light shone \r\nfull in the front of our habitation, before our eyes were opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. \r\n\r\n_The Sabbath and the parable._\r\n\r\nOn awaking in the morning, we were all sensible of an unusual \r\nrefreshment, and a new activity of mind. Well, young ones, cried \r\nI jocosely, you have learned, I see, how to sleep in a hammock, \r\nI heard not a single complaint all the night! no disputing about \r\nroom from any one of you; all was still and tranquil. Ah, answered \r\nthey, stretching and yawning as they spoke, we were so heartily \r\nfatigued yesterday, that it is no wonder we slept so soundly.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Here then, my children, is another advantage derived \r\nfrom labour; that of procuring a sweet and peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, father, that is very true, said they, so let us go \r\nto work again to-day: What is there to do? What will you give \r\neach of us to do?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Nothing at all; you will do no work with your hands \r\nfor the whole day.\r\n\r\n_The Boys._—Oh, father, you are joking now, I see you are; you \r\nare laughing at us because we slept a little too long.\r\n\r\n_Father._—No, my dear boys, I am not joking. This day is Sunday, \r\nand God said, _Six days shall thou labour, but the seventh is \r\nthe Sabbath of the Lord thy God;_ and we will therefore celebrate \r\nit as we ought.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Sunday! What, are there Sundays here? That is quite \r\ndelightful! Oh, I will go and shoot my arrows, and I will walk about \r\nand play, and I will do no work the whole day.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Do you think, then, that it was solely for the purpose \r\nthat people might amuse themselves, and indulge in idleness, \r\nthat God reserved Sunday to himself? You mistake; what he intended \r\nwas, that there should be a day set apart for worship and \r\nthanksgiving for all his goodness, and such an employment of our time \r\nought to be our greatest pleasure.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I thought, father, that the worship of God consisted \r\nin going to church to hear a sermon and sing hymns: we have no \r\nchurch here, how then can we properly observe Sundays?\r\n\r\n_Francis._—And we have no organ either, and I am very sorry, \r\nfor I like very much to hear it.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—You see then, papa, that it is not possible for us to \r\ncelebrate Sunday in the way you propose.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—How childishly you talk! Do you think that papa, who \r\nmade sermons for us in our own country, cannot make them here? \r\nIs not God in every place, as certainly as in a church? And what \r\nshould hinder us from singing without an organ? When there were \r\nsoldiers encamped near our town, they had neither church nor \r\norgan, and yet the service of the church was performed to them: \r\nwe have a good minister, and that is the principal thing.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Your brother is quite right, my boys; God is indeed \r\nevery where, and the best worship consists in thinking of him, \r\nand of his holy will, and resolving to fulfil it. In this sense, \r\nthere is no place in the world that may not serve for a church, \r\nbecause we may entertain pious sentiments every where; and this \r\nmajestic arch of heaven, the immediate work of the Almighty, \r\nought more effectually to raise the soul and touch the heart, \r\nthan an edifice of stone made by the hand of man! We will, therefore, \r\nperform divine service this morning; we shall have no sermon \r\nto-day, those I know by heart being beyond your comprehension: \r\nyoung persons should be addressed on the subject of the Supreme \r\nBeing, according to their feeble understanding, and not as we \r\nwould address an audience whose judgement and reason are matured. \r\nI will hereafter compose a sermon that shall be suitable for \r\nyou: today we will repeat the prayers, and sing one of those \r\naffecting hymns of adoration which your mother taught you. I \r\nwill then relate to you a parable of the Great King, which is \r\nwell adapted to awaken pious thoughts and sentiments in your \r\nminds.\r\n\r\n_The Boys._—A parable, a parable! What, like that of the Sower \r\nin the Testament. Ah, yes, do, papa; we will listen for ever \r\nto that; do begin directly.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Every thing in its turn, if you please: first, let \r\nus perform our usual morning devotions; then we will descend \r\nto breakfast, and take care of our animals, a work which God \r\npermits us to engage in even on Sundays: in the meanwhile, I \r\nwill reflect a little on the history I am to relate, and then \r\nI will call you round me.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after prayers, we descended the ladder, and breakfasted \r\non warm milk; we served the animals also with their meal, and \r\nthen we all sat down on the tender grass; the boys full of impatient \r\ncuriosity; their mother absorbed in silent reflection, her hands \r\njoined and her eyes sometimes turned towards the sky; while I \r\nwas penetrated with the most lively desire to impress upon the \r\nyoung minds of my children, a subject I considered of the highest \r\nimportance for their well-being, both in this world and in that \r\nwhich is to come.\r\n\r\nAll now standing up, I repeated aloud the church service, which \r\nI knew by heart, and we sung some verses from the hundred and \r\nnineteenth psalm, which the boys had before learned; after which \r\nwe sat down, and I began as follows:\r\n\r\n“My dear children, there was once a Great King, whose kingdom \r\nwas called The country of Light and Reality, because the purest \r\nand softest light of the sun reigned there continually, which \r\ncaused the inhabitants to be in a perpetual state of activity. \r\nOn the furthest borders of this kingdom, northward, there was \r\nanother country which also belonged to the Great King, and the \r\nimmense extent of which, was unknown to all but himself. From \r\ntime immemorial, a plan the most exact of this country, had been \r\npreserved in the royal archives. This second kingdom was called \r\nThe kingdom of Obscurity or of Night, because every thing in \r\nit was gloomy and inactive.\r\n\r\n“In the most fertile and agreeable part of his empire of Reality, \r\nthis Great King had a residence called the Heavenly City, in \r\nwhich he lived and kept his court, which was the most brilliant \r\nthat the imagination can form an idea of. Millions of guards, \r\nand servants high in dignity, remained for ever round him, and \r\na still larger number held themselves in readiness to receive \r\nhis commands. The first of these were clothed in robes of cloth \r\nthat was lighter than silk, and white as snow; for white, the \r\nimage of purity, was the favourite colour of the Great King. \r\nOthers of his attendants carried flaming swords in their hands, \r\nand their garments displayed the most brilliant colours of the \r\nrainbow; each of these stood in waiting to execute the will of \r\nthe King, with the rapidity of lightning, on receiving from him \r\nthe slightest sign. All were happy to be admitted into his presence; \r\ntheir faces shone with the mildest joy, and wore the impression \r\nof a calm serenity, and of the absence of all inquietude and \r\npain: there was but one heart, and one soul among them; the sentiment \r\nof paternal concord so united these beings, that no envy or jealousy \r\never arose among them. The common centre of all their thoughts, \r\nand all their sentiments, was devotion to their sovereign: it \r\nwould have been impossible either to see or converse with them, \r\nwithout passionately desiring, even at any sacrifice, to obtain \r\ntheir friendship, and to partake their lot. Among the rest of \r\nthe inhabitants of the Heavenly City, there were some less close \r\nin their attendance upon the Great King; but they were all virtuous, \r\nall happy, all had been enriched by the beneficence of the monarch, \r\nand, what is of still higher price, had received constant marks \r\nof his paternal care; for his subjects were all equal in his \r\neyes, and he loved them and treated them as if they had been \r\nhis children.\r\n\r\n“The Great King had, besides the two kingdoms I have been describing, \r\nan uninhabited island of considerable extent; it was his wish \r\nto people and cultivate this island, for all within it was a \r\nkind of chaos: he destined it to be for some years the abode \r\nof such future citizens as he intended to receive finally into \r\nhis residence, to which only such of his subjects were admitted, \r\nas had rendered themselves worthy by their conduct. This island \r\nwas called Earthly Abode; he who should have passed some time \r\nin it, and by his virtues, his application to labour, and the \r\ncultivation of the land, should have rendered himself worthy \r\nof reward, was afterwards to be received into the Heavenly City, \r\nand made one of its happy inhabitants.\r\n\r\n“To effect this end, the Great King caused a fleet to be equipped, \r\nwhich was to transport the new colonists to this island. These \r\nhe chose from the kingdom of Night, and for his first gift bestowed \r\nupon them the enjoyment of light, and the view of the lovely \r\nface of nature, of which they had been deprived in their gloomy \r\nand unknown abode. It will easily be imagined that they arrived \r\njoyful and happy, at least they became so, when they had been \r\nfor a short time accustomed to the multitude of new objects which \r\nstruck their feeble sight. The island was rich and fertile when \r\ncultivated. The beneficent King provided each individual who \r\nwas disembarked upon it, with all the things he could want in \r\nthe time he had fixed for their stay in it, and all the means \r\nfor obtaining the certainty of being admitted as citizens of \r\nhis magnificent abode, when they should leave the Earthly Island. \r\nAll that was required to entitle them to this benefit was, that \r\nthey should occupy themselves unceasingly in useful labour, and \r\nstrictly obey the commands of the Great King which he made known \r\nto them. He sent to them his only son, who addressed them from \r\nhis father in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“‘My dear children, I have called you from the kingdom of Night \r\nand Insensibility to render you happy by the gifts of life, of \r\nsentiment, and of activity. But your happiness for the most part \r\nwill depend upon yourselves. You will be happy if you wish to \r\nbe so. If such is your sincere desire, you must never forget \r\nthat I am your good king, your tender father; and you must faithfully \r\nfulfil my will in the cultivation of the country I have confided \r\nto your care. Each of you shall receive, on his arriving at the \r\nisland, the portion of land which is intended for him; and my \r\nfurther commands respecting your conduct, will be soon communicated \r\nto you. I shall send you wise and learned men, who will explain \r\nto you my commands; and that you may of yourselves seek after \r\nthe light necessary for your welfare, and remember my laws at \r\nevery instant of your lives, it is my will that each father of \r\na family, shall keep an exact copy of them in his house, and \r\nread them daily to all the persons who belong to him. Further, \r\neach first day of the week, I require to be devoted to my service. \r\nIn each colony, all the people shall assemble together as brothers \r\nin one place, where shall be read and explained to them, the \r\nlaws contained in my archives. The rest of this day shall be \r\nemployed in making serious reflections on the duties and destination \r\nof the colonists, and on the best means to fulfil the same: thus, \r\nit shall be possible to all, to receive instruction concerning \r\nthe best manner and most effectual means, of improving the land \r\nwhich has been confided to your care: thus, you will each day \r\nlearn to manure, to sow, to plant, to water, and cleanse the \r\nland from tares, and from all evil weeds that may choke the good \r\nseed. On this same day, each of you may present his supplications, \r\nmay tell me what he stands in need of, and what he desires to \r\nhave, to forward the perfection of his labour; all these requests \r\nwill appear before me, and I shall answer, by granting such as \r\nI shall think reasonable, and tending to a salutary end. If your \r\nheart tells you that the various benefits you enjoy, deserve \r\nyour gratitude, and if you will testify it by doubling your activity, \r\nand by consecrating to me the day I have chosen for myself, I \r\nwill take care that this day of rest, instead of being an injury \r\nto you, shall become a benefit, through the salutary repose of \r\nyour body, and that of the animals given you to assist your labours, \r\nand who, as well as yourself, should enjoy repose on that day \r\nto recruit their strength. Even the wild animals of the field, \r\nand of the forests, ought on that day to be protected from the \r\npursuit of the hunter.\r\n\r\n“‘He, who in his Earthly Abode shall most strictly have observed \r\nmy will, who shall have best fulfilled the duties of a brother \r\ntowards his fellow inhabitants, who shall have preserved his \r\nland in the best order, and shall show the largest produce from it, \r\nshall be recompensed for his deeds, and shall become an inhabitant \r\nof my magnificent residence in the Heavenly City. But the neglectful \r\nand the idle man, and the wicked man, who shall have spent their \r\ntime in interrupting the useful labours of others, shall be condemned \r\nto pass their lives in slavery, or, according to the degree of \r\ntheir wickedness, shall be condemned to live in subterraneous \r\nmines, in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\n“‘From time to time, I shall send ships to fetch certain individuals \r\nfrom the Earthly Island, to reward or punish them, according \r\nas they have done well or ill; and as none will be warned beforehand, \r\nof the time of the coming of my messenger, it will be well for \r\nyou to keep watch, that you may be ready to perform the voyage, \r\nand worthy to be received into the Heavenly City. It will not \r\nbe permitted for any one to pass by stealth on board the ship, \r\nand leave his abode without my orders; for such a one shall be \r\nseverely punished. I shall have the most certain knowledge of \r\nall that passes in the Earthly Island, and no one will be able \r\nto deceive me. A magical mirror will at all times show me the \r\nactions of each individual in the island, and you shall be judged \r\naccording to your most secret thoughts and acionst.’\r\n\r\n“All the colonists were well satisfied with the discourse of \r\nthe Great King, and made him the most sacred promises. After \r\na short time allowed for repose from the fatigue of the voyage, \r\na portion of land and the proper instruments for labour, were \r\ndistributed to each of the strangers. They received also seeds, \r\nand useful plants, and young trees for producing them refreshing \r\nfruits. Each was then left at liberty to act as he pleased, and \r\nincrease the value of what was confided to his care. But what \r\nhappened? After some time, each followed the suggestions of his \r\nfancy: one planted his land with arbours, flowery banks, and \r\nsweet-smelling shrubs; all pleasing to the sight, but which brought \r\nforth nothing. Another planted wild apple-trees, instead of the \r\ngood fruit as the Great King had commanded; contenting himself \r\nwith giving high-sounding names to the miserable fruit he had \r\ncaused to be brought forth. A third had indeed sown good grain; \r\nbut not knowing how to distinguish the tares that grew up along \r\nwith it, he pulled up the good plants before they were mature, \r\nand left only the tares in his ground. But the greater part let \r\ntheir land lie fallow, and bestowed no labour upon it, having \r\nspoiled their implements, or lost their seed, either from negligence \r\nor idleness, or liking better to amuse themselves than to labour; \r\nmany of them had wilfully misunderstood the instructions of the \r\nGreat King, and sought by subtleties to change their meaning.\r\n\r\n“Few, very few, worked with diligence and courage, and seeking \r\nto improve their land, according to the orders they had received. \r\nThe great fault of these was, that they would not believe what \r\nthe Great King had sent to tell them. All the fathers of families, \r\nhad indeed a copy of the laws of the Sovereign, but most of them \r\nomitted to read in the book: some saying that it was useless \r\nto read it, for they knew it by heart, while they never employed \r\ntheir thoughts upon it. Others pretended that these laws were \r\ngood for times past, but were no longer beneficial for the present \r\nstate of the country. Some had even the audacity to assert, that \r\nit contained many inexplicable contradictions; that the laws \r\nit prescribed were merely supposed or falsified, and that they \r\nhad therefore a right to deviate from them. Others among them \r\nmaintained, that the magical mirror was a mere fable; that the \r\nKing was of too merciful a nature to keep galleys; that there \r\nwas no such place as the subterranean mines; and that all would \r\nat last enter the Heavenly City. From habit they continued to \r\ncelebrate the first day of the week, but by far the smallest \r\npart of it was consecrated to the honour of the Great King. Great \r\nnumbers of them dispensed with going to the general assembly, \r\neither from idleness, or to employ themselves in occupations \r\nwhich had been expressly forbidden. By far the greater part of \r\nthe people considered this day of repose as intended for pleasure, \r\nand thought of nothing but adorning and amusing themselves as \r\nsoon as daylight appeared. There were only then a small number \r\nof persons who kept the day according to the decree; and even \r\nof those who frequented the assembly, many had their thoughts \r\nabsent, or were sleepy, or engaged in forming empty projects, \r\ninstead of listening to the words, which fell from the lips of \r\nthe minister of the sovereign. The Great King, however, observed \r\nunalterably the laws he had laid down and announced, respecting \r\nthem. From time to time, some frigates appeared on their coasts, \r\neach bearing the name of some disastrous malady; and these were \r\nfollowed by a large ship of the line, named the _Grave_, on board \r\nof which, the admiral, whose name was _Death_, caused his flag \r\nof two colours, green and black, to be constantly floating in \r\nthe air. He showed the colonists, according to the situation \r\nin which he found them, either the smiling colour of Hope, or \r\nthe gloomy colour of Despair.\r\n\r\n“This fleet always arrived without being announced, and seldom \r\ngave any pleasure to the inhabitants. The admiral sent the captains \r\nof his frigates, to seize the persons he was ordered to bring \r\nback with him. Many who had not the smallest inclination were \r\nsuddenly embarked, while others, who had prepared every thing \r\nfor the harvest, and whose land was in the best condition, were \r\nalso seized. But these last took their departure cheerfully, \r\nand without alarm; well knowing that nothing but happiness awaited \r\nthem. It was those who were conscious they had neglected to cultivate \r\ntheir land, who felt the most regret. It was even necessary to \r\nemploy force to bring them under subjection. When the fleet was \r\nready for departure, the admiral sailed for the port of the Royal \r\nResidence; and the Great King, who was present on their arrival, \r\nexecuted with strict justice both the rewards and punishments \r\nwhich had been promised to them. All the excuses alleged by those \r\nwho had been idle, were of no avail. They were sent to the mines \r\nand to the galleys, while those who had obeyed the Great King \r\nand well cultivated their land, were admitted into the Heavenly \r\nCity, clothed in robes of brilliant colours, one exceeding the \r\nother according to the degree of merit.”—Here, my dear children, \r\nends my parable. May you have thoroughly understood its meaning, \r\nand may you reap the advantage it is capable of affording you! \r\nMake it the subject of your reflections the whole of this day. \r\nYou, Fritz, I see, are thoughtful; tell me what struck you most \r\nin my narration.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—The goodness of the Great King, and the ingratitude \r\nof the colonists, father.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And you, Ernest, what is your thought?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—For my part, I think they were great fools to have \r\nmade so bad a calculation. What did they get by conducting themselves \r\nas they did? With a little pains they might have passed a very \r\nagreeable sort of life in the island, and would have been sure \r\nof going afterwards to the Heavenly City.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—To the mines, gentlemen, away with you! you have well \r\ndeserved it.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—For my part, I should have liked best to have lived \r\nwith the men who were drest in the colours of the rainbow. How \r\nbeautiful they must have looked!\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is well, my boys. I perceive that each of you, \r\naccording to his age and character, has seized the meaning of \r\nmy parable. I have by this image endeavoured to represent to \r\nyou the conduct of God towards man, and that of man towards God: \r\nlet us see now if you have completely seized the sense.—I then \r\nput different questions to them, and explained what they had \r\nnot perfectly comprehended; and after a short review of the principal \r\nparts of my discourse, I concluded it by a moral application.\r\n\r\n“Human creatures, said I, are the colonists of God; we are required \r\nto perform the business of probation for a certain period, and \r\nsooner or later are destined to be taken hence. Our final destination \r\nis Heaven, and a perfect happiness with the spirits of just men \r\nmade perfect, and in the presence of the bountiful Father of \r\nus all. The piece of land intrusted to each is the soul! and \r\naccording as he cultivates and ennobles it, or neglects or depraves \r\nit, will be his future reward or punishment. At present, dear \r\nchildren, that you know the true sense of my parable, each of you \r\nshould make the application of it according to his own consciousness. \r\nYou, Fritz, should think of the subjects who planted the wild \r\napples, and wished to make them pass for sweet savoury fruit \r\nof a superior kind. These represent persons who make a parade \r\nof the natural virtues belonging to their character, and which \r\nare consequently exercised without any trouble to themselves; such as \r\ncourage, strength, &c. who prefer them to more essential qualities \r\nacquired by others, with sacrifices and labour to themselves; \r\nand who, full of presumption and arrogance, consider themselves \r\nas irreproachable, because nature has given them personal courage, \r\nand bodily strength, and a certain skill in the use of these \r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n“You, Ernest, should think of the subjects of the Great King \r\nwho cultivated their land so as to produce arbours, flowery banks, \r\nand sweet-smelling shrubs, and such productions in general as \r\nwould please the eye, but which produced no fruit. These are \r\nthey, who give their whole attention to the acquiring unfruitful \r\nknowledge, sciences, &c., and consider with a sort of contempt \r\nthe things more immediately required for the conduct of life; \r\nwho exert themselves solely for the understanding, and neglect \r\nthe heart; whose principal aim it is, to obtain self-indulgences, \r\nand who neglect what is useful in society.\r\n\r\n“You, Jack, and you, Francis, should apply to yourselves the \r\ncase of those men who let their land lie fallow, or, in their \r\nthoughtlessness, mistook the grain, and sowed tares instead of \r\nwheat. These are the neglectful subjects, who neither think nor \r\nlearn, but give to the winds what is taught them, or entirely \r\nforget instruction; who reject virtuous sentiments, and let the \r\nbad ones grow in their hearts. But for ourselves, one and all, \r\nwe will adopt the model of the good and zealous labourers; and \r\nshould our exertions be a little painful, we shall think of the \r\nreward which awaits us, when we shall have adorned our souls \r\nwith all that is good, just, and praiseworthy. Thus, when death, \r\nwhich cannot fail to come at last, shall summon us, we may follow \r\nhim with joy to the throne of the Good and Great King, to hear \r\nhim pronounce these sweet and consoling words: O good and faithful \r\nservant! thou hast been tried, and found faithful in many things; \r\nenter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” With these words, and a \r\nshort prayer of benediction, I concluded the solemnity of our \r\nSunday; and I had the satisfaction of seeing, that my four sons \r\nhad not only listened attentively, but that they were struck \r\nwith the application I had made to each of them. They remained \r\nfor a short time reflecting in silence. Jack was the first to \r\nbreak it: You have explained to us every part of the parable, \r\nfather, except the copy of the laws of the Great King, which \r\nwas to be kept and read in every family: have you one of these \r\ncopies? for you never read it to us.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Alas! my children, I have never been without such a \r\ncopy; and not only one, but several, and we have read in it almost \r\nevery day. This copy is the Holy Bible, which contains all God’s \r\nlaws, and which we ought constantly to study carefully. I cannot \r\nforgive myself for not having thought of bringing it from the \r\nvessel. Should we not be able to go another voyage, we shall \r\nfor ever be deprived of this divine doctrine. I can hardly imagine \r\nhow it could be possible for me, a minister of the Holy Gospel, \r\nand the father of a family, to be so occupied about things for \r\nthe comfort of our poor mortal bodies, and forget what might \r\nconsole and sustain our immortal souls, and which was so necessary \r\nfor the conduct of my children!\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—Have you then forgot my enchanted bag, which I have \r\npromised shall furnish every thing you can desire? You wish for \r\na Bible. In a minute I will put one into your hands; and heartily \r\ndo I rejoice in having the power to bring you so great a satisfaction.\r\n\r\n_Father._—O best and most excellent of women! how ashamed I am \r\nof myself in the comparison! While, in the midst of confusion \r\nand horrors, you thought of so many little things conducive to \r\nour comfort, and which we as males disdained to be occupied about, \r\nhave you then also taken care of the most essential of all, the \r\nhealth of our souls? A thousand thanks are due to you! Give me \r\nthe inestimable book, these laws of the Great King, which I have \r\nmentioned in my parable, and which from this moment, we will \r\ntake for the rule of our lives. She opened her bag, and with joy \r\nI received from her the book of life. I opened it, and immediately \r\nread some passages from it to my family. In this solitude, in \r\nwhich for so long a time we had heard only our own thoughts expressed \r\nin an appropriate language, we were singularly affected with \r\nthe voice from heaven, which now seemed to address us: we felt \r\nforcibly that, notwithstanding our exile, we were still connected \r\nwith the community of mankind: by the invisible tie of the same \r\nreligion, and the same Father, we were for ever numbered among \r\nthe children of God, to whom he enjoins laws, and on whom he bestows \r\nhis care, no less in a desert, than in an immense capital; our \r\nisland, containing only our own family, was no doubt as interesting \r\nin his eyes, as whole nations of people. I explained with the \r\nutmost care what I read to them, and I gave the book in turn \r\nto each of the boys, that they might have the pleasure of reading \r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nI chose in preference, such passages as were applicable to our \r\ncircumstances. We then raised our hearts to God, to thank him \r\nfor so signal a benefit as the preservation of our Bible! My \r\nyoung folks still remained thoughtful and serious; but by and \r\nby the gaiety natural to their age, prevailed, and each slipped \r\naway to seek the recreation he liked best. But as it had been \r\nenjoined them not to undertake any kind of labour, they rambled \r\nabout from place to place, with more appearance of listlessness \r\nthan of reflection. This gave me an opportunity of observing, \r\nthat at their age, the soul is too feeble to sustain herself \r\nthrough the whole day without occupation. I recalled them, therefore, \r\nand observed that the Great and Good King did not require complete \r\ninaction from them, and that they might amuse and occupy themselves \r\nthe rest of the day, without giving him offence, provided they \r\nshould avoid unruly sports. Jack desired me to lend him my bow \r\nand arrows, as he wished to see how they would fly, now that \r\nthey had been completed from the quills of his porcupine. Fritz \r\nhad a great desire to be employed about the case he was to make \r\nof the skin of the tiger-cat, and asked my advice how to proceed. \r\nLittle Francis, also, laid my activity under contribution, by \r\nrequesting me to make him a bow and arrows, he being yet too \r\nyoung to be intrusted with a gun. I began with giving Jack the \r\nbow and arrows as he desired, and told him how to make the sand \r\nrun out, and to put on the sharp points at the end, and tie them \r\nsecurely round with packthread, and then to dip them into some \r\nglue.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, I understand, said Jack wagging his head knowingly; \r\nI know how to do it very well, father. But will you be kind enough \r\nto tell me where there is a glue-shop, that I may step and buy \r\nsome glue in a minute?\r\n\r\nI will show you where, said little Francis, laughing as he spoke: \r\nask mamma to give you one of her soup cakes, which are exactly \r\nlike good strong glue.\r\n\r\nLittle blockhead! replied Jack, you think then it is enough to \r\nbe like; what I want is glue, and not soup.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Not so much of a blockhead as you think, Jack, interrupted \r\nI. The truth often comes from the lips of children, and you will \r\ndo well to follow his advice. I am of opinion, that one of the \r\ncakes, dissolved in a little water, and afterwards thickened upon \r\nthe fire, would produce what would be an excellent substitute for \r\nglue; give yourself therefore the trouble of making the experiment. \r\nPut a soup cake over the fire in one of our cocoa-shells, and \r\nyou will soon know the event.\r\n\r\nWhile Jack was preparing his glue, and Francis, proud of being \r\nthe inventor, was busied in assisting his brother, blowing the \r\nfire &c., Fritz came to me for my advice about the making of \r\nhis case. Run, said I, and fetch your skin, and we will work \r\nat it together. I sat down on the grass, took out my knife, and \r\nwith the remains of a bamboo cane, began to make a bow for Francis. \r\nI was well satisfied to observe them one and all, take a fancy \r\nto shooting with an arrow, having been desirous to accustom them \r\nto this exercise, which constituted the principal defence of \r\nthe warriors of old, and might possibly become our only means \r\nof protection and subsistence: our provision of powder must at \r\nlast be exhausted; we might even, from moment to moment, be deprived \r\nof it by accident; it therefore was of the utmost importance \r\nto us, to acquire some other means of killing animals, or attacking \r\nour enemies. The Caribees, I recollected, were taught at a very \r\ntender age, to strike an object at the distance of thirty or \r\nforty steps; they hit the smallest birds perched on the top of \r\nthe tallest trees. Why then should it not be possible for my \r\nboys to learn to do the same? I will at least, said I, provide \r\nthem with bows and arrows, and try what can be done.\r\n\r\nWhile I was silently reflecting on the subject, employed in finishing \r\na bow for Francis, Ernest, who had been observing me for some \r\ntime, slipped suddenly away; and Fritz coming up at the same \r\nmoment, with the wetted skin of the tiger-cat in his hand, I \r\npaid no attention to the circumstance. I began my instructions \r\nto my eldest boy, respecting the trade of a tanner. I told him \r\nthe method of getting rid of the fat of the skin, by rubbing \r\nit over with sand, and placing it in running water till it had \r\nno longer any appearance of flesh, or any smell; next to rub \r\nit with soft butter, to make it supple, and then to stretch the \r\nskin in different directions; and also to make use of some eggs \r\nin the operation, if his mother could spare them. You will not \r\nat first produce such excellent workmanship as I have seen of \r\nthis kind from England; but with a little patience, regretting \r\nneither your time, nor your labour, you will have completed some \r\ndecent-looking cases, which will give you the more pleasure, \r\nfrom being made from an animal of your own taking, and by the \r\nwork of your own hands. When your skin shall have thus been prepared, \r\ncut certain small cylinders of wood of the size and length required; \r\nscoop these cylinders hollow, so as to form a convenient case \r\nfor a knife, a fork, or a spoon; then stretch your softened skin \r\nupon the surface of the cylinders, in such a manner, that the \r\nskin may stretch a little beyond the extremity of the wood, and \r\nclose at the top; you have then nothing more to do, than to let \r\nthe skin cling to, and dry upon these moulds. Your work will \r\nthen be finished, and will turn out a neat and masterly production.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I understand perfectly, and I hope I shall succeed; \r\nbut if I were to take some cork for my moulds, the cases would \r\nbe lighter, and more convenient for carrying.\r\n\r\n_Father._—No doubt they would, but where can you get any cork? \r\nand how would you be able to cut it and scoop it out? It is a \r\nwood singularly impracticable, and would resist the knife.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—If you would let me take one of the cork jackets we \r\nkeep for swimming, I could try, by means of heating it, to render \r\nit fit for my purpose.\r\n\r\n_Father._—To this I have no objection; I like to see you inventive, \r\nand casting about for the means of success. In reality, we have \r\na pretty considerable number of those jackets; and I am in hopes \r\nwe shall not want them any more. You may get one of them, but \r\ntake care not to hold it too long to the fire. What is the matter, \r\nwife, that you shake your head? You seem dissatisfied with your \r\nboy’s undertaking?\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—No, I am not dissatisfied with his work, provided \r\nhe can accomplish it, but with the use for which it is intended. \r\nDo you imagine that I shall let you have our silver table utensils \r\nto be dragged about, at the risk of losing them, in your expeditions? \r\nIn the first place, I do not consider them as our own; and what \r\naccount should we have to give the captain, should we ever meet \r\nagain?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Oh, we should have accounts enough for him. We would \r\ntell him, that but for the pains we took to preserve them, they \r\nwould all have gone to the bottom; that the last thing our friends \r\nthe sharks would have thought of, would be to restore his silver \r\nspoons; and that, as we had all the trouble, they ought to be \r\nconsidered of our own earning.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—So you have made a partnership with the sharks, my \r\nboy! I hope, however, that you entertain a higher idea than you \r\nprofess, of your own nature; and that upon more reflection you \r\nwill perceive, that in equity and justice, we ought to consider, \r\nnot only these utensils, but all the other things of value we \r\ntook from the vessel, as a trust committed to our care; and which \r\nwe ought to use our utmost endeavours to preserve. I am, however, \r\nof opinion, that having rescued them at the risk of our lives, \r\nwe have a right to use them for our own convenience, while we \r\nremain destitute of all human aid; but that, if we should ever \r\nfind the persons to whom they belong, it is a duty incumbent \r\non us to return them.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—And I, for my part, am of opinion, that the captain, \r\nhowever great a man he may be, will not be sorry to receive them \r\nin a magnificent case made from the skin of the tiger-cat, with \r\nwhich I shall present him, in return for the use of his utensils.\r\n\r\nI was laughing at the vanity of my young pretender, when suddenly, \r\nwe heard the firing of a gun, which proceeded from our tent in \r\nthe tree, and two birds at the same time fell dead at our feet. \r\nWe were at once surprised and alarmed, and all eyes were turned \r\nupwards to the place. There we saw Ernest standing outside the \r\ntent, a gun in his hand, and heard him triumphantly exclaiming, \r\nCatch them! catch them there! I have hit them; and you see I \r\ndid not run away for nothing. He descended the ladder joyfully \r\nand precipitately, and ran with Francis to take up the two birds; \r\nwhile Fritz and Jack mounted to our castle in the tree, hoping \r\nto meet with the same luck. I observed them when they were got \r\nnear the top, and called after them,—What are you going about? \r\nHave you already forgot the Great King, who commands that the \r\nbirds of the air and the beasts of the field should rest on the \r\nday he has consecrated to himself?\r\n\r\nThese words suddenly interrupted the zeal of the young sportsmen, \r\nand diminished the pleasure of Ernest. He blushed, and cast his \r\neyes on the ground, without attempting an excuse; while his brothers \r\nquietly descended the ladder, and began to examine the birds \r\nwhich had fallen from the tree. One of the dead birds proved \r\nto be a sort of thrush, and the other was a very small kind of \r\npigeon, which in the Antilles is called an ortolan: they are \r\nvery fat, and of a delicious taste. We now observed, for the \r\nfirst time, on looking about, that the wild figs began to ripen, \r\nand that they attracted a great number of these birds. I foresaw, \r\nin consequence, that we were about to have our larder well stored, \r\nand our table furnished with a dish which even a nobleman might \r\nenvy us. I consoled the boys for the reproach I had made them, \r\nby giving them permission to kill as many of these birds, in \r\nfuture, as they liked. I knew that, half roasted and put into \r\nbarrels with melted butter thrown over them, it was a food that \r\nwould keep a long time, and might prove an excellent resource \r\nin time of need. My wife set about stripping off the feathers \r\nof the birds Ernest had killed, to dress them for our supper. \r\nI seated myself by her side, and proceeded in my work of arrow-making \r\nfor Francis; and observed to my wife, that she would find an \r\nexcellent substitute in the figs, for the grain we should want \r\nto feed our fowls, who no doubt would be found to have as high \r\na relish for them, as was evinced by the ortolans.\r\n\r\nThus finished our day of rest. The birds proved excellent; but \r\nin point of quantity, we ran no risk of indigestion. Supper ended, \r\nand prayers said, we ascended the ladder in procession; and each \r\nwithdrew to his hammock to taste the sweets of a tranquil sleep, \r\nthough unprompted by such fatigue as we had experienced the preceding \r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. \r\n\r\n_Conversation, a walk, and important discoveries._\r\n\r\nJack had finished the trial of his arrows: they flew to admiration; \r\nand he practised his new art incessantly. Little Francis waited \r\nwith impatience for the moment when he should do the same, and \r\nfollowed with his eyes every stroke I made. But when I had finished \r\nmy bow, and prepared some little arrows for him, I must next \r\nundertake to make him a quiver; for, said he, an archer can no \r\nmore be without a quiver, than a sportsman without a game-bag. \r\nI found I must submit. I took some bark from the branch of a \r\ntree, which came off in a round form; and folding the edges over \r\neach other, I stuck them together with some glue produced from \r\nthe soup cakes, and which answered the purpose extremely well. \r\nI next stuck on a round piece to serve for the bottom; and then \r\ntied to it a loop of string, which I hung round his neck. He \r\nput his arrows into it; and, happy as a chevalier in full armour, \r\nhe took his bow in his hand, and ran to try his skill by the \r\nside of his brother. Fritz had also cleaned and prepared his \r\nmaterials for the cases, when his mother summoned us to dinner. \r\nWe cheerfully placed ourselves under the shade of our tree, round \r\nthe table I had manufactured. At the end of the repast, I made \r\nthe following proposition to the boys, which I was sure would \r\ngive them pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhat think you, my good friends, said I, of giving a name to \r\nthe place of our abode, and to the different parts of the country \r\nwhich are known to us? I do not mean a general name to the whole \r\nisland, for who knows, but that some illustrious European traveller \r\nmay have already bestowed on it the name either of a great navigator, \r\nor of some saint; and that our island may not already make a \r\nfigure in certain maps of geography? But this need not prevent \r\nus from also giving names to the objects we are concerned with, \r\nand which will make us better understand each other, when we \r\nare conversing about them: this ceremony will also present to \r\nus the soothing illusion, of inhabiting a country already known \r\nand peopled.\r\n\r\nThey all exclaimed, joyfully, that the idea was excellent.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Oh! pray, papa, let us invent some very long names, and \r\nthat are very difficult to be pronounced. I should be glad that \r\nthose who shall read about us, should be a little puzzled to \r\nremember the names of the places and things that belonged to \r\nus. What pains has it not cost me to remember their _Monomolapa_, \r\ntheir _Zanguebar_, their _Coromandel_, and many other still more \r\ndifficult appellations! Ah! now we shall take our revenge of \r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This would all be very well, if it were probable that \r\nour history in this country, and the names we shall have bestowed, \r\nwere likely to be objects of public curiosity; but in the mean \r\nwhile, you forget that our own organs will be fatigued, by frequently \r\npronouncing such barbarous names as you propose.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—How shall we manage then? What pretty names can we find?\r\n\r\n_Father._—We will do as all sorts of nations have done before \r\nus. We will name the places by different words from our own language, \r\nthat shall express some particular circumstance with which we \r\nhave been concerned.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Well, so we will; I shall like this still better. Where \r\nshall we begin?\r\n\r\n_Father._—We shall naturally begin with the bay by which we entered \r\nthis country. What shall we call it? What say you, Fritz? You \r\nmust speak first, for you are the eldest.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Let us call it _Oyster Bay_: you remember what quantities \r\nof oysters we found in it.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Oh, no! let it rather be called _Lobster Bay_; for you \r\ncannot have forgot what a large one it was that caught hold of \r\nmy leg, and which I carried home to you.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Why then we may as well call it the _Bay of Tears_, \r\nfor you must remember that you roared loud enough for all of \r\nus to hear you.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—My advice would be that, out of gratitude to God, \r\nwho conducted us hither in safety, we ought to call it _Providence \r\nBay_, or the _Bay of Safety_.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This name is both appropriate and sonorous, and pleases \r\nme extremely. But what name shall we give to the spot where we \r\nfirst set up our tent?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Let us call it simply _Tent House_.\r\n\r\n_Father._—That name will do very well. And the little islet at \r\nthe entrance of _Providence Bay_, in which we found so many planks \r\nand beams that enabled us to make our bridge, how shall it be \r\nnamed?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—It may be called _Sea-Gull Island_, or _Shark Island_, \r\nfor it was here we saw both those animals.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I am for the last of these names, _Shark Island_; for \r\nit was the shark that was the cause of the sea-gulls being there; \r\nand it will also be a means of commemorating the courage and \r\nthe triumph of Fritz, who had killed the monster.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—For the same reason we will call the marsh, in which \r\nyou cut the canes for our arrows, _Flamingo Marsh_.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Quite right, I think; and the plain, through which we \r\npassed on our way to this place, _Porcupine Field_, in memory of your \r\nskilful encounter with him. But now comes the great question,—What \r\nname shall we give to our present abode?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—It ought to be called, simply, _Tree Castle_.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—No, no, that will not do at all; that is the same as \r\nif, when we wanted to name a town, we called it _The Town_. Let \r\nus invent a more noble name.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Yes, so we will. I say _Fig Town_.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Ha, ha, ha! a noble name, it must be confessed! Let \r\nus call it _The Eagle’s Nest_, which I am sure has a much better \r\nsound. Besides, our habitation in the tree, is really much more \r\nlike a nest, than a town, and the eagle cannot but ennoble it, \r\nsince he is the king of birds.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Will you let me decide the question for you? I think \r\nour abode should be called _The Falcon’s Nest_; for, my boys, \r\nyou are not yet arrived at the dignity of eagles, but are simply, \r\npoor birds of prey; and like the falcon, you also are, I trust, \r\nobedient, docile, active, and courageous. Ernest can have no \r\nobjection to this; for, as he knows, falcons make their nests \r\nin large trees. All exclaimed, clapping their hands, Yes, yes, \r\nwe will have it _The Falcon’s Nest!_ the sound is quite chivalrous; \r\nso, Health to _Falcon’s Nest Castle!_ cried they all, looking \r\nup to the tree, and making low bows. I poured out a small quantity \r\nof sweet wine, and presented it to each, to solemnize our baptism. \r\nAnd how, said I, shall we name the promontory, where Fritz and \r\nI in vain wearied our eyes, in search of our companions of the \r\nvessel? I think it may properly be called, _Cape Disappointment._\r\n\r\n_All._—Yes, this is excellent. And the river with the bridge——\r\n\r\n_Father._—If you wish to commemorate one of the greatest events \r\nof our history, it ought to be called _The Jackall’s River_; \r\nfor these animals crossed it when they came and attacked us, and \r\nit was there that one of them was killed. The bridge I should name \r\n_Family Bridge_, because we were all employed in its construction, \r\nand all crossed it together in our way to this place. It will \r\nbe quite a pleasure to converse about the country we inhabit, \r\nnow that we have instituted names as if every thing belonged \r\nto us.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—It will be just as if we had farms and country houses, \r\nall dependent upon our castle.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—It is the same as if we were kings.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—And the queen-mother is not without hope, that her little \r\nslips of majesty will conduct themselves mercifully towards their \r\nsubjects,—the birds, the agoutis, the geese, and the flamingoes; \r\nthe . . . . . What more shall I say? for I do not know the family \r\nname of all your vassals. Let me, therefore, end, by hoping that \r\nyou will not depopulate your kingdom.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—No, mother, we will take care of that. We will endeavour \r\nto extirpate, only those among our subjects, who are wicked.\r\n\r\nIn this pleasing kind of chat, the time of dinner passed agreeably \r\naway. We settled the basis of a geography of our own country; \r\nand amused ourselves with saying that it must go by the first \r\npost to Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Fritz again set to work upon his case; and, to \r\nmy great astonishment, he had possession of one of the cork-jackets, \r\nand was preparing to cut it to pieces, and use it as a lining \r\nto the cylinders. In the name of Heaven, cried I, where did you \r\nget the jacket? I was quite sure we had left them all at Tent \r\nHouse; and when I gave you leave this morning, to take one of \r\nthem, it was in the hope that, tired with waiting, you would \r\nuse some other wood, and that the jacket would escape. As it \r\nis, I must shut my eyes while you cut it, for I will not retract \r\nmy word. But tell me where you got it? It was I, said my wife, \r\nwho placed it as a saddle on the ass’s back, for little Francis \r\nto sit upon. You, it seems, did not observe it; but nothing escapes \r\nthat lynx-eyed boy of ours, called Fritz.\r\n\r\nWell, well, since it is thus, replied I, let him make use of \r\nit if he can; the cutting it will at least exercise his patience. \r\nI shall soon find how to manage it, said Fritz, by holding it \r\nnear the fire. We let him do as he liked, and I went out to look \r\nfor Jack, whom I met, dragging the skin of his porcupine with \r\ngreat difficulty along; for it was still armed with all the quills, \r\nwith the exception of about a dozen, which we had taken for the \r\narrows. He spread it at my feet, entreating me to assist him \r\nin making some coats of mail, or cuirasses, of it, for the dogs, \r\nas I had before recommended to him, and which he had taken care \r\nnot to forget. After making him clean the skin completely on \r\nthe inside, with some cinders and sand mixed together, I assisted \r\nhim in cutting it, and his mother helped him in the sewing. When \r\nthis was done, we put the first that was dried on the back of \r\nthe patient Turk, which gave him a respectable warlike sort of \r\nan appearance, and no one could doubt that he was sufficiently \r\nwell armed to encounter even an hyæna.\r\n\r\nHis companion, Ponto, had less reason to be pleased with this \r\nnew kind of spiked accoutrement. Turk, unconsious of one particular \r\nquality in his new dress, approached near to Ponto and lay down \r\nby his side, who sprang off in a fright, searching about, for some \r\nplace where he might be sheltered from the perforating familiarities \r\nof his companion. Jack’s concluding business, was, stripping \r\nthe skin from the head of the porcupine, and stretching it on \r\none of the roots of our trees to dry, intending to make a cap \r\nof it, like those worn by the savages, which, he said, would \r\nfrighten our enemies should they approach; while, in the mean \r\ntime, his friends, if they liked it, might set it on a pole and \r\nmake merry with it.\r\n\r\nDuring our employment, Ernest and Francis had been exercising \r\nthemselves in shooting their arrows: the evening was advancing, \r\nand the intense heat of the day began to diminish. I invited \r\nall my family to take a walk: Leave your work for this time, \r\nmy boys, said I, and let us make a short excursion; and, as a \r\nsuitable conclusion to the day, let us seek in the beautiful \r\nface of Nature, for traces of the wisdom and goodness of the \r\nCreator. Which way shall we direct our steps?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Let us go to Tent House, father; we are in want of powder \r\nand shot for the little consumers of our figs; nor must we miss \r\nour dinner for to-morrow, or forget that we are to secure a supply \r\nfor winter.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—I too vote for Tent House; my butter is nearly gone, \r\nfor Fritz took an unreasonable share for his new trade of tanning; \r\nalso, I have never failed to observe, that those who most zealously \r\npreach a life of frugality and œconomy, are at least as well \r\nsatisfied as the rest, when I take care to present them with \r\nan excellent and well dressed dinner.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—If we go to Tent House, let us try to bring away some \r\nof the geese and ducks with us: they will look very well swimming \r\nabout in our stream here, by Falcon’s Nest.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I will undertake to catch them, if any one will help \r\nto bring them home.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—And I will catch my handkerchief full of lobsters \r\nin the Jackall’s River, and we will put them into Falcon’s Stream, \r\nwhere, no doubt, they will thrive to admiration.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You really all of you assign such good reasons, that \r\nI see I must yield to them. To Tent House, then, we will go; \r\nbut we will not take our accustomed road along the sea-shore, \r\nbut rather vary our pleasure, by trying to explore some other \r\nway. We will keep along our own little stream as far as the wall \r\nof rocks, whose agreeable shade will accompany us almost as far \r\nas the cascade formed by Jackall’s River: it will, I hope, as \r\nwe have no burden to carry, be easy for us to cross it, by jumping \r\nfrom stone to stone, and so to get to Tent House: we will return \r\nwith our provisions by the road of Family Bridge, and along the \r\nsea-shore; the sun, if not gone down, will then be at our backs. \r\nThis new route may possibly furnish some additional discoveries.\r\n\r\nMy idea was highly applauded, and all was soon arranged for our \r\nsetting out. Fritz was adorned with his fine tiger-cat-made belt, \r\nbut he had not been able to finish his cases in time. Jack walked \r\ngravely on, his porcupine cap upon his head, and his jackall \r\nbelt, armed with his two pistols, round his waist. Each carried \r\na gun and a game-bag; even little Francis had his bow in his \r\nhand, and his quiver on his shoulder; and being both pretty and \r\nof a fair complexion, he resembled a little Cupid. Their mother \r\nwas the only person not burdened with a gun; but she carried \r\nher large butter-pot, to fill it at our store-house. Turk marched \r\nbefore us with his coat of mail studded with spikes, but it was \r\napparent that he felt intimidated and ill at ease; his step was \r\ntherefore slow and quiet. The monkey also, having a great desire \r\nto accompany us, leaped without ceremony on his accustomed seat, \r\nthe back of Turk. But when he perceived the formidable saddle \r\nand the projecting spikes, he sprang four times forward, making \r\nthe most comical grimaces imaginable. He was not long, however, \r\nin choosing what to do. Ponto, he saw, was without such a frightful \r\ninstrument; so he jumped upon him in a trice, and clung so closely \r\nto his back, that the dog could not shake him off: he therefore \r\ngave up the endeavour, and quietly submitted to carry him. Even \r\nour new friend, the flamingo, seemed to understand that some \r\nextraordinary movement was in agitation, and prepared to make \r\none of the party. The pretty kind-tempered animal had become \r\nevery day more tame, and attached himself to us with a confidence \r\nwhich increased our goodwill towards him. The boys, enchanted \r\nby the manner in which he placed himself in the ranks with us, \r\nall contended for being his companion; but the flamingo adopted \r\nthe prudent measure of coming up to me, and showing his reliance \r\non my protection, by walking gravely by my side.\r\n\r\nOur route along the stream, was at first extremely agreeable, \r\nbeing sheltered by the shade of large trees, while the ground \r\nunder our feet was a short and soft kind of grass. To prolong \r\nthe pleasure of our walk, we proceeded slowly, amusing ourselves \r\nwith looking about us to the right and left; the eldest boys \r\nmade frequent escapes on before, so that we sometimes lost sight \r\nof them. In this manner we reached the end of the wood; but the \r\ncountry now appearing to be less open, we thought it would be \r\nprudent to bring our whole company together. On looking forward, \r\nwe saw the boys approaching us full gallop, and this time, for \r\na wonder, the grave Ernest was first. He reached me panting for \r\nbreath, and so full of joy and eagerness, that he could not pronounce \r\na single word distinctly; but he held out his hand, which contained \r\nthree little balls of a light green colour.\r\n\r\nWe have found a prize indeed, father, cried he at last, when \r\nhe had recovered his voice; we have found some potatoe seed!\r\n\r\nWhat say you? potatoe seed? inquired I joyfully; have you really \r\nbeen so fortunate? Come near, every one of you, and let me look \r\nat your little balls; for I scarcely dared believe in so happy \r\nan event, as the discovery of a plant which would place us for \r\never beyond the reach of hunger, and even of apprehension. It \r\nwas you then, Ernest, who found the prize, and our grateful thanks \r\nare your due.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I do not see any great merit there was in the case. I \r\nshould have found them as soon as he, if I had been in the right \r\nplace. I see no great talent in what he has done.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—But, Jack, there is still less talent in your attempt \r\nto undervalue the useful discovery your brother has made, and \r\nin seeking to diminish the obligation, which we ought rather \r\nto feel a pleasure in acknowledging. This little movement of \r\nenvy in your bosom occasions me uneasiness; I must add, that \r\nit is by no means certain that, even if you had been in the same \r\nplace, you would have remarked the potatoes; that you, who are \r\nso thoughtless and unobserving, would have known the leaves for \r\nthose of the potatoe plant. Ernest gives more attention to what \r\nhe sees, and his discoveries are not merely the effect of hazard, \r\nbut of observation also. Perhaps, too, you do not know a potatoe \r\nwhen you see it; and it is even possible that we may ourselves \r\nmistake the plant, from our great eagerness to meet the confirmation \r\nof our wishes; for there are, no doubt, other plants which also \r\nproduce small green round balls upon their stalks.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—Why, do potatoe plants bear fruit on their branches \r\nas well as at the roots?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Little blockhead! do you think, then, that the roots \r\nbear blossoms? Do you not know that the vegetable called the \r\npotatoe, is only the root of the plant, or at least a part of the \r\nroot, and not a fruit? The fruit, in all plants, is the depository \r\nof the seed, which must ripen in the sun, and consequently above \r\nground: these little green balls, therefore, are the real fruit \r\nwhich succeed to the blossom, and contain the seed.\r\n\r\nI did not fail to applaud Ernest for this clear and sensible \r\nexplanation. We all hastened to the place where he had seen these \r\ntubercles, and, with extreme joy, we found there a large plantation \r\nof potatoe plants; a part of them were covered with their lilac \r\nand yellow blossoms, the sight of which conveyed more pleasure \r\nto our hearts than if they had been the most fragrant roses; \r\nanother portion of the plantation was in seed; and in several \r\nplaces, some younger plants were pushing through the earth. Our \r\npetulant Jack bawled out, jumping for joy, They are really potatoes! \r\nand though it was not I who discovered them, at least it shall \r\nbe I who will dig them up. Saying this, he knelt down and began \r\nto scratch up the earth with all ten fingers of his feeble hands. \r\nHe would not, however, have made much progress, if the monkey, \r\nexcited by his example, had not also set himself to work. He \r\ndug up several with great dexterity; and after smelling at them, \r\nhe was going to throw them to a distance: but Jack snatched them \r\neagerly out of his paws, and gave them to his mother; and afterwards \r\nthe monkey and he continued digging up the potatoes together, \r\nand soon obtained enough to serve up for a dinner. The rest of \r\nus, unwilling to be idle spectators, set to work also; with our \r\nknives and sticks we soon procured a sufficient number, to fill \r\nour bags and our pockets. When we were well loaded, we again \r\nbegan to think of our walk to Tent House. Some of our company raised \r\ntheir voices in favour of returning immediately to Falcon Stream, \r\nto unload our cargo, and prepare our booty for a delicious meal; \r\nbut so many pressing motives presented themselves for proceeding \r\nto our store-house, that it was decided we should continue our \r\nroute, which we accordingly resumed.\r\n\r\nMy children, said I, as we pursued our way, this discovery of \r\nthe potatoes is one of inestimable value; it reminds me of a passage \r\nin the Bible, which is strikingly applicable to our situation, and \r\nought to awaken a sentiment of the warmest gratitude in our hearts, \r\ntowards our heavenly Father: it is a part of the hundred-and-seventh \r\npsalm, and these are the words:\r\n\r\n“They wandered in the wilderness, in a solitary way; they found \r\nno city to dwell in: hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within \r\nthem: then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he \r\ndelivered them out of their distress: he led them forth by the \r\nright way, that they might go to the place of their habitation. \r\nHe satisfieth the longing spirit, and filleth the hungry soul \r\nwith his goodness.”\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—This is truly applicable to our situation, and we will \r\nall return thanks to God for so inestimable a gift.\r\n\r\n_Father._—There are, no doubt, different kinds of vegetables, \r\nmore succulent and more delicate than the potatoe; but it is \r\nprecisely this plain tasteless kind of sustenance, that can be \r\neaten for the longest time together, without satiety: accordingly, \r\nfood of this nature, such as bread, rice, potatoes, obtains, \r\non the whole, a preference over provisions possessing a higher \r\nflavour. Can you tell me, boys, the reason of this?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I know; it is because they are more wholesome.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—And because they occasion no disgust; could eat potatoes \r\nevery day of my life, without being tired of them.\r\n\r\n_Father._—All you say is true; in future they will serve us for \r\nbread, and often indeed for our whole dinner. But let us for \r\nthe present dismiss the subject of our unexpected good fortune, \r\nand resume our expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. \r\n\r\n_Continuation of the preceding chapter, and more discoveries._\r\n\r\nConversing on different subjects, we reached the long chain of \r\nrocks, over which our pretty Falcon Stream made its escape in \r\nthe form of a cascade, whose gentle murmurs delighted the ear, \r\nas much as its wild and various aspect gratified the eye. We \r\nkept along the chain of rocks which led to Jackall’s River, and \r\nfrom thence to Tent House, having first, with difficulty, pushed \r\nthrough the high grass which presented itself in our path. Our \r\nfatigue, however, was relieved by the uncommon beauty of the \r\nscenery around; on the right hand was a boundless sea; on the \r\nleft, the island, with the bay by which it was accessible, and \r\nthe chain of rocks, presenting altogether, an assemblage of the \r\npicturesque, equal to what the liveliest fancy could desire. \r\nThe view reminded me of the large flower-stands common in Europe; \r\nthe shelvings, the projections, the cornices of which, instead of \r\npots of flowers, were covered with plants most rare and contrasted, \r\nand in a vigorous state of vegetation. In the greatest number \r\nof these, were distinguishable the different families of grasses, \r\nmany of them of the thorn-leaved species, and more flourishing \r\nthan those which are cultivated in the green-houses of Europe. \r\nThere was also in abundance the Indian fig, with its large broad \r\nleaf; aloes of different forms and colours; the superb prickly \r\ncandle, or cactus, bearing straight stalks, taller than a man, \r\nand crowned with long straight branches, forming a sort of star. \r\nThe broad plantain spread along the rocks its innumerable boughs \r\ntwisted with each other, hanging down perpendicularly, and ornamented \r\nwith flowers, which grew in large tufts, and were of the brightest \r\nrose-colour; while that which pleased us best, and which was \r\nfound there in great abundance, was the king of fruits, both \r\nfor figure and relish, the crowned pine-apple. We immediately \r\nfell on this fruit with avidity, because we knew its value and \r\nits innocence, and because it was fit to be eaten without any \r\nfurther preparation than merely gathering it. The monkey was \r\nnot the last to seize one for himself; and as he could make higher \r\njumps than the boys, they formed the scheme of making him angry \r\nby little tricks, so as to induce him to fling pine-apples at \r\nthem. This game they continued so long, that I thought it prudent \r\nto interrupt them, fearing that the unripe state of the fruit \r\nmight affect their health. My wife and I ate one or two with \r\ngreat pleasure; and after bestowing the commendations so fine \r\na fruit deserved, we agreed that we would frequently return to \r\nthe place, and eat them as a dessert.\r\n\r\nSoon after, I was fortunate enough to discover, among the multitude \r\nof plants which grew either at the foot or in the clefts of the \r\nrock, the karata (the Bromelia Karata of Linnæus), many of which \r\nwere now in blossom, and of others the flowers had lately fallen \r\noff. They resembled young trees; and travellers have given so \r\nperfect a description of them in their books of natural history, \r\nthat it was impossible I should mistake them. But what further \r\nconfirmed their identity, was their straight slender stalk, crowned \r\nwith blossoms, and proceeding from a tuft of leaves like the \r\npine-apple, with its large foliage terminating in a sharp point, \r\nand forming altogether, a plant remarkably pleasing to the eye. \r\nI pointed out to the boys the immense size of these leaves, which \r\nwere hollowed in the middle like a saucer, in which the rain \r\nis for a long time preserved; and also its beautiful red flowers. \r\nAs I was acquainted with the properties of this useful plant, \r\nthe pith of which is used as tinder by the Negroes, who also \r\nmake a strong kind of thread from the fibres of its leaves, I \r\nwas not less satisfied with my discovery, than I had been with \r\nthat of the potatoes; and I did not hesitate to assure them, \r\nthat I preferred it to the pine-apples. All answered me, their \r\nmouths at the same time full of the fruit, that they would resign \r\nthese trees with all their flowers to me, if I would leave them \r\nthe pine-apples. The pine-apples are better than all the rest, \r\nsaid they, even than the potatoes. What is a handsome-looking \r\ntree worth, if it does not bear any fruit? Your most devoted \r\nhumble servant, Mr. Karata, but pine-apples for us!\r\n\r\nLittle gluttons! cried I, half angry, your preference is as senseless \r\nas that of a man who prefers a woman with a handsome face, to \r\none possessed of those valuable and lasting virtues which soothe \r\nthe cares of human life. The flavour of the pine-apple gratifies \r\nyour palate; but it is not of necessary use, and I will immediately \r\ngive you a proof that I am not wrong in my preference of the \r\nkarata. Ernest, take out my flint and steel, and strike me a \r\nlight.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—But, father, what am I to do for tinder? what can I \r\nput to receive the sparks?\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is precisely to the purpose. When the tinder which \r\nwe brought from the vessel is all consumed, how shall we be able \r\nto make a fire? and without a fire, how shall we dress a dinner, \r\nor prepare numberless other matters we have occasion for?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Oh, I should not be in the least at a loss. We would \r\ndo like the savages; rub two pieces of wood against each other, \r\ntill at length they catch fire.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Many thanks for your information: but for us who are \r\nnot savages, and not in the habit of such exercise, the expedient \r\nwould be somewhat inconvenient. I would lay a wager, that if \r\nyou were to rub two pieces of wood together for a whole day, \r\nyou would not produce a single spark; or if you did, you would \r\nwait so long for the end you had in view, as to make it almost \r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—If this is the case, we must endeavour to have patience \r\ntill we can find a tree that bears tinder, just as we found one \r\nthat bears gourds.\r\n\r\n_Father._—We might make tinder by burning some linen rag, and \r\nputting it in a close box: but we have, unfortunately, none to \r\nspare; and, therefore, the best thing for us would be to find \r\ntinder ready prepared in some plant; and in this we may succeed \r\nby examining our new prize, the karata tree.\r\n\r\nI then took a dried stalk of the tree, stripped off the bark, \r\nand there appeared a kind of dry and spungy substance, which \r\nI laid upon the flint; and then striking it with a steel, it \r\ninstantly caught fire. The boys looked on with astonishment, \r\nand then began to caper about, exclaiming: Long live the tinder \r\ntree!\r\n\r\nHere then, said I, we have an article of greater usefulness than \r\nif it served merely to gratify the appetite. Your mother will \r\nnext inform us, what materials she will use for sewing your clothes, \r\nwhen her provision of thread from the enchanted bag is exhausted.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—I have long been uneasy upon this very subject, and \r\nwould willingly give all the pine-apples in the world, in exchange \r\nfor some hemp or flax.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And your wish shall be accomplished, said I. For once I \r\nshall have the pleasure of presenting you with something you eagerly \r\ndesire to have. If you examine, you will find some excellent thread \r\nunder the leaves of this extraordinary plant, where all-provident \r\nnature has placed a store-house of this valuable article, though \r\nthe lengths of thread will be found not longer than the leaf. \r\nI accordingly examined one of the leaves, and drew out of it \r\na strong piece of thread of a red colour, which I gave to my \r\nwife. How fortunate it is for us, said she, that you have had \r\nthe habit of reading and of study! None of us would have had \r\na thought about this plant, or have conceived that it could be \r\nof any use; but will it not be a little difficult to draw out \r\nthe little lengths of thread through the prickles that surround \r\nthem?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Not in the least; we shall put the leaves to dry, either \r\nin the sun, or by a gentle fire. The useless part of the leaf \r\nwill then separate by being beaten, and the mass of thread will \r\nremain.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I see clearly, father, that we ought not to trust to \r\nappearances; it is the same with this tree as with mankind; the \r\nmost merit is often found in an individual that was least supposed \r\nto possess it: but I believe it would be difficult to find any \r\ngood qualities in the prickly plants which are growing here in \r\nall directions, and wounding the persons who go near them: of \r\nwhat use can they possibly be?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Again, my son, you form your judgement from appearances. \r\nThe greatest part of these plants possess medicinal virtues; \r\ngreat use is made in pharmacy of the aloe, which produces such \r\nabundance of beautiful flowers; in green-houses in Europe, some \r\nhave been seen to bear more than three thousand blossoms. At \r\nCarlsbad, upon the estates of Count de Limbourg, there was an \r\naloe tree twenty-six feet in height; it had twenty-eight branches, \r\nwhich branches bore more than three thousand blossoms in the \r\nspace of a month. At Paris, at Leyden, in Denmark, there have \r\nbeen also seen some exceedingly curious specimens of this tree; \r\nmany of them are full of a resinous sort of sap, of which valuable \r\ngums are made. But look, here, too, is the Indian fig or prickly \r\npear, a vegetable of no common interest; it grows in the poorest \r\nsoils, and, as you see, upon the rocks; the poorer the soil, \r\nthe more its leaves are thick and succulent; I should be tempted \r\nto believe that it was nourished by the air, rather than by the \r\nearth. It is also called the racket-tree, from the resemblance \r\nof its long, thick, flat leaves to that well-known instrument. \r\nThis plant bears a kind of fig, which is said to be sweet and \r\npalatable, when ripened in its native sun, and it is both a salutary \r\nand refreshing food. This, then, is another plant of great utility. \r\nScarcely had I pronounced these words, than our light-footed \r\nJack was on the rock, trying to gather some of the fruit; but \r\nthis time he had reason to repent his precipitation; for the \r\nfruit of this tree is covered with fine prickles, which assail \r\nthe skin of the bold hand that dares to gather them. Poor Jack \r\nsoon came down again, crying heartily, striking his feet upon the \r\nground, and shaking his hand with the pain the prickles occasioned. \r\nI had not the courage to make this the moment for a lesson of \r\nmorality founded upon the effects of his gluttony, for which \r\nhe was sufficiently punished; and I reproved his brothers, who \r\nstood by laughing while I was drawing out the thorns. I then \r\ninstructed them how to gather this fruit without incurring the \r\nsame inconvenience. I threw up a stone, and brought down a fig, \r\nwhich I caught upon my hat; I cut off its two ends, and was thus \r\nenabled to hold it without injury, while I peeled off the skin. \r\nI then resigned it to the curiosity of my young companions.\r\n\r\nThe novelty, rather than the taste, of the fruit, made them think \r\nit excellent: they all found means to gather some of the figs, \r\nand each was busied in inventing the best method of taking off \r\nthe skins: but that of Fritz had the best success; he gathered \r\nhis figs, by plunging the sharp point of his stick into them, \r\nand then pulling the stick a little sideways to bring them down: \r\nhe peeled them quite neatly while they were still on the stick, \r\nand presented several to his mother, who partook of them with \r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I perceived Ernest holding a fig upon the end \r\nof his knife, turning it about in all directions, and bringing \r\nit close to his eye with a look of curious inquiry. I wish I \r\ncould know, said at length our young observer, what little animals \r\nthese are in the fig, which feed so eagerly upon it, and are \r\nas red as scarlet.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Ha, ha! this too will perhaps turn out a new discovery, \r\nand an additional source of usefulness, which this plant possesses. \r\nLet me look at your fig; I will lay a wager that it is the insect \r\ncalled the cochineal.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—The cochineal! what a droll name! What is the cochineal, \r\nfather?\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is an insect of the kind called _suckers_, or _kermes_; \r\nhe feeds upon the Indian fig, which, no doubt, is the cause of his \r\nbeautiful colour, which forms an object of considerable importance \r\nin the trade of a dyer; for nothing else produces so fine a scarlet. \r\nIn America, they stretch pieces of linen under the branches, \r\nand then shake the tree; and when the insects have fallen in \r\ngreat numbers, the ends of the linen are folded together to inclose \r\nthem; the insects are sprinkled with vinegar or cold water, and \r\nthen dried, and sent to Europe, for the use of dyers, who pay \r\na high price for the commodity.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I now perfectly agree with you, that this plant is \r\nof ten times more use than the finest pine-apple: the latter, \r\nhowever, has also its merit, and we are not obliged to reject \r\nthe one, if we choose the other: yet, as we have not any occasion \r\nfor a scarlet dye, and that the fruit of the fig-tree is certainly \r\ninferior to the pine-apple, so I think it is but reasonable to \r\nprefer the last.\r\n\r\n_Father._—In this you are to blame; I have not yet mentioned \r\na still superior usefulness peculiar to the Indian fig-tree; \r\nit serves as a protection to man.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—As a protection to man! Why, how can that be, father?\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is used for making hedges round the habitations \r\nof man, its prickly surface effectually preventing the approach \r\nof animals; for you see, that besides the prickles which took \r\nsuch a fancy to Jack’s hand, there is a large thorn at each of \r\nthe knots, which appear in the plant.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—The largest serve very well for pins, and even for \r\nnails; see how they keep my gown well fastened.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This, then, you see is a third usefulness the Indian \r\nfig-tree can boast, and of which I was not at first aware. You \r\nmust perceive of what importance these inclosures are; and the \r\nrather, as they are made with so little trouble; for, if you \r\nplant only one of its leaves in the ground, it immediately takes \r\nroot, and grows with astonishing rapidity: it is therefore not \r\nonly a defence against wild beasts, but against enemies in general; \r\nfor they could not get over it without cutting through the hedge; \r\nand during such an operation, which also would be attended with \r\nsome danger, the persons within, gain time to escape, or to prepare \r\nan effectual defence.\r\n\r\nJack, the king of the thoughtless race, asserted that this plant \r\nwas extremely soft, and yielding in its nature; and that with \r\nthe assistance of a knife, or even a stick, it would be easy \r\nto get over such a hedge: to prove his assertion, he began to \r\ncut down, with his clasp knife, a pretty large plant, striking \r\nevery where to right and left with all his might, till at length \r\none of the divided leaves fell with such violence on his leg, \r\nthat the thorns struck into the flesh, and Jack roared out piteously, \r\nand quickly seated himself upon a stone to disengage it as quickly \r\nas possible. I could not now, as I assisted him to draw out the \r\nthorns, refrain from laughing a little at this second attack \r\nof the figs, which was caused solely by his obstinacy and his \r\nimprudence; I observed to him, how difficult it must be, for \r\nsavages, who wear no clothes, to force such a barrier as they \r\nformed, and for this once, I had the pleasure of convincing him.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Ah, papa, do let us make such a hedge round our tree; \r\nwe shall then have no further occasion to light fires to preserve \r\nus from wild beasts, or even from the savages, who from one day \r\nto another may arrive in their canoes, as they did on Robinson \r\nCrusoe’s Island.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—And we could, then, easily gather the cochineal, and \r\ntry to make the same beautiful scarlet colour.\r\n\r\n_Father._—We shall have time enough for many things, my dear \r\nchildren; but for the present, it is sufficient to prove to you, \r\nthat God has not made any thing to be wholly useless; and that \r\nit is the duty of men, on whom he has bestowed the gifts of wisdom \r\nand intelligence, to employ those faculties, in discovering the \r\nutility of the different productions he has allowed to exist.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—For my part, I have done with the Indian fig-tree, its \r\nfruit, its cochineal, and its ugly thorns, and I will never go \r\nnear it again.\r\n\r\n_Father._—If the plant could speak, it would most likely say: \r\nThat little boy shall not come near me any more. Without any \r\nreason, or any necessity, but purely out of contradiction to \r\nhis father, he attacks and destroys me; me, who would have done \r\nhim service, if he would but have treated me with kindness, and \r\nhave been careful in coming near me. And now, Jack, if your leg is \r\nstill painful, apply a leaf of the karata to it, for I recollect that \r\nthe plant possesses the property of curing wounds. He accordingly \r\ntook my advice, and in a few minutes was able to join us on our \r\nroad to Tent House.\r\n\r\nNow then, said Ernest, I have had an opportunity of learning \r\nthe valuable properties of the karata tree, and of the Indian \r\nfig-tree; but I wish I could also be informed respecting those \r\ntall plants which look like sticks covered with thorns, that \r\nI perceive every where about us; I see neither fruits nor insects \r\non them: of what use then, father, do you think they can be?\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is not in my power, my dear boy, to explain to you \r\nthe uses of all the plants in the world; I presume that many \r\nexist which have no other use than contributing to the sustenance \r\nof different kinds of animals; and, as I have already told you, \r\nit is for man, by his superior intelligence, to discover those \r\nthat can be applied to his own use. Many possess medicinal qualities \r\nof which I am ignorant, and which will become better known as \r\nthe world advances in age. It occurred to me that one of the \r\nplants we saw today, named the prickly candle, is of the kind \r\nwhich Bruce describes in his _Travels to Abyssinia_, and of which \r\nhe gives a drawing; the only difference that I perceive, being \r\nthe size. They serve, says he, for food to the elephant and the \r\nrhinoceros; the first with his strong teeth, or his trunk, and \r\nthe latter with his horn, lay hold of this seeming stick, and \r\nrip it up from one end to the other; they then devour the pith, \r\nand sometimes the rind.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—The palate of these animals must surely be made of \r\niron, to be able to chew such a thorny substance without injury.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Why so? Camels and asses are very fond of thistles, \r\nand appear to digest them extremely well. It is probable, therefore, \r\nthat the stomach of these animals is so formed, that these prickly \r\nsubstances occasion in it only an agreeable excitation, favourable \r\nto their appetite and their digestion.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Your idea is not a bad one; and if it be not true, \r\nit is at least probable.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Will you tell me, father, the precise difference between \r\n_true_ and _probable_?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Your question is one of those which have occupied the \r\nattention of philosophers for two thousand years. It would therefore \r\nbe too tedious to discuss at this moment; I will, however, endeavour \r\nto make my answer such, as to be of use to you, in the science of \r\nlogic, or the art of reasoning. Let us see, if you will understand it. \r\nWhat we call _true_, is that which cannot in any way be contradicted, \r\nand which exactly agrees, in every point, with the idea we conceive \r\nof a certain object, or as it really exists before our eyes: \r\nfor example, when I make an impression with my seal on some warm \r\nwax, it is absolutely _true_ that the figure impressed on the \r\nwax, is the same as that on the seal. A thing is _probable_, \r\nwhen we have a variety of motives for believing it true, without, \r\nhowever, being able to bring any proof. Again, we call _false_, \r\nthat which is in positive contradiction to all our notions, our \r\nreason, and our experience. Is it _true_, _probable_, or _false_, \r\nthat a man can fly up into the air?\r\n\r\n_All._—It is false, absolutely false.\r\n\r\n_Father._—How so?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Because the thing is impossible.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Very well, my young philosopher, and why is the thing \r\nimpossible?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Because it is not possible.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Ha, ha, ha! here is a pretty round of _possible_ and \r\n_impossible_. _It is false, because no such thing can be done, \r\nand no such thing can be done, because it is not possible._ Presently \r\nyou will tell me that it is impossible because it is false. Try \r\nagain, my lads, we must have some better reasons. What say you, \r\nErnest?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I say, that the thing cannot be done, because it is \r\nnot in the nature of man to fly; that, having no wings, he is \r\nnot formed for flying.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Well, but if some one should assert, that a man is \r\nable to make a machine, by the assistance of which he can raise \r\nand support himself in the air without wings, and without the \r\nmachine’s resting upon any thing; would this be _probable_ or \r\n_improbable_? What think you, Fritz?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I think I should have said _improbable_, if I had not \r\nknown that people have accomplished what you describe by the \r\ninvention of balloons.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And why should you have thought it _improbable_?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Because man is, in his nature, heavier than the air; \r\nand I should have supposed, that a machine of whatever kind, \r\ninstead of diminishing, would only add to his weight.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Very well reasoned. But you would be told that this \r\nmachine is of large dimensions, and composed of a close, light \r\nkind of silk, and that it is filled with air chemically prepared, \r\nwhich being much lighter than atmospheric air, tends perpetually \r\nto ascend, and supports the man in the air, as bladders support \r\nyou upon the water. Do you understand all this, my boy? and what \r\nhave you to say in answer?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Yes, father, I understand it; and I perceive how it \r\nmight be probable, that since man has discovered a means to be \r\nsustained upon water, he might also find the means to raise and \r\nsustain himself in the air.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And when a multitude of persons of veracity, and of \r\ndifferent ages, shall declare, that with their own eyes they \r\nsaw a balloon, to which a parachute was fastened filled with \r\nmen, and that all mounted in the air together, and disappeared \r\nabove the clouds; should you still maintain that it is false \r\nthat a man can fly?\r\n\r\n_All._—No, to be sure, we should say that it is quite true that \r\nhe can fly.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And yet you all said but a minute ago, that it was \r\nabsolutely false.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Ah! but we said that, father, of a man by himself, \r\nindependently of any machine he might construct; for though nature \r\nhas refused him wings, she has not failed to bestow on him an \r\ninventive mind, which more than compensates for that deficiency.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Your observation is perfectly just, and I hope you \r\nwill not fail to profit by it. With the aid of his intelligence, \r\nand his reason, there is scarcely any thing which man cannot \r\nattain to. But to return to our example: you will find in it \r\nthe definition of the words which you ask me about: it is _false_, \r\nthat man of himself can fly; it is _probable_, that by the aid \r\nof a machine of his own invention, he may be enabled to mount \r\nand sustain himself in the air; and it is _absolutely true_, \r\nthat this has been effected by man, though without his having \r\nyet found a certain means of guiding these factitious wings; \r\na defect, which in a great measure renders his discovery useless.\r\n\r\n_My Wife._—Well, now we have had a long lesson upon the subject, \r\nduring which I have not been able to put in one single little \r\nword; I am afraid you will make your boys so learned, that I \r\nshall not know on what subjects to converse with them.\r\n\r\n_Father._—There is no fear of that, my dear; for even should \r\nI teach them all I know myself, they would not be very learned. \r\nA man should always endeavour to acquire knowledge: if he lives \r\nin the world, he is in consequence the more esteemed, the more \r\nrespected, and knows the better how to manage his affairs: if, \r\nas will most likely be the case with our sons, their lot is to \r\nlive in a kind of solitude, it will be less tiresome to them, \r\nif they have cultivated the habit of thinking and reflecting; \r\nso that even the little information in my power to give them, \r\nmay be of use. I have never had occasion to regret that I knew \r\nso much, but often that I knew too little, particularly in our \r\npresent situation, where no other master can be obtained for \r\nthem than myself and nature. If the boys could conceive what \r\nadvantages they would derive from study, they would impose upon \r\nthemselves the strictest application, while at the age when learning \r\nis so easy. Conversing thus, we reached Jackall’s River, which \r\nwe crossed, stepping with great care from stone to stone, and \r\nvery shortly arrived at our old habitation, where we found every \r\nthing in perfect order as we had left it; and we immediately \r\ndispersed, each in pursuit of what he intended to take away. \r\nFritz loaded himself with powder and shot; I and my wife and \r\nFrancis employed ourselves in filling our pot with butter, the \r\ncarrying of which on our return it was agreed was to fall on \r\nme. Ernest and Jack looked about for the geese and ducks; but \r\nas they were become somewhat savage, the boys could not succeed \r\nin catching one of them. The idea then occurred to Ernest, of \r\ntaking a small bit of cheese, and tying it to the end of a piece \r\nof string, and holding it to float in the water. The voracious \r\nanimals hastened eagerly to seize it. In this way, Ernest drew \r\nthem towards him, one by one, with the cheese in its mouth, till \r\nhe had caught the whole: he put them in their pocket handkerchiefs, \r\nleaving only their heads at liberty; and then we fastened them \r\nas a parcel to our game-bags, so that each had his share in carrying \r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe had thought of taking back with us a provision of salt; but \r\nwe could not carry so much as we wished, the sacks being occupied \r\nwith potatoes. I, however, thought of throwing in a certain quantity \r\nloose into one of them, to fill up the space between the potatoes: \r\nin this way we secured a tolerable supply; but it made the sack \r\nso heavy, that no one was willing to be incumbered with it. Fritz \r\nproposed that our faithful Turk should carry it; and accordingly \r\nwe took off his superb coat of mail, and left it at Tent House, \r\nand the sack was tied on the back of the quiet, kind-tempered \r\nanimal. Ponto was to carry the monkey as before.\r\n\r\nWe set out on our return, loaded with treasures, and the appearance \r\nof our caravan was even more amusing than it had been before: \r\nthe ducks and geese, with their heads and necks stretching out \r\nat our shoulders, cackling with all their might, gave us a truly \r\nsingular and ludicrous appearance: we could not help laughing \r\nimmoderately as we passed the bridge, one after the other, loaded \r\nin so strange a fashion. Our mutual jokes, and the general good \r\nhumour which prevailed, served to shorten the length of the walk, \r\nand we none of us were sensible of fatigue, till we were seated \r\nunder our tree at Falcon’s Stream. My wife now prepared to console \r\nus, by putting some of the potatoes which we so eagerly desired \r\nto taste, immediately on the fire. She next milked the cow and \r\nthe goat, and refreshed us with a draught of their warm milk, \r\ngiving us a proof how the natural strength may be increased, \r\nby the feelings of conjugal and maternal love. The kind-hearted \r\nwoman was at least as much fatigued as any of us; yet she made \r\nno attempt to rest herself, till she had provided us with all \r\nshe had to give for our refreshment. At length, after dining heartily \r\non our potatoes, on which we bestowed abundance of commendation, \r\nwe concluded the day with evening-prayers, and then joyfully \r\nclimbed our ladder to seek the blessing of repose in our aërial \r\ncastle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. \r\n\r\n_The imaginary bear—The sledge—A lesson in natural philosophy._\r\n\r\nI had remarked the evening before, on our return to the sea-shore, \r\na quantity of wood, of which I thought I could make a kind of \r\nconveyance for our cask of butter and other provisions from Tent \r\nHouse to Falcon’s Stream. I had secretly determined to go early \r\nthe next morning, before my family should be awake, to the spot. \r\nI had fixed upon Ernest for my assistant, thinking that his indolent \r\ntemper required to be stimulated to exertion. I made him feel \r\nas a great favour the preference I gave him, and he promised \r\nto be ready at a very early hour. I was also desirous to leave \r\nFritz with the family, as, being the tallest and strongest, he \r\nwas more able to protect the rest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I perceived the first dawn of morning, I quietly awoke \r\nErnest. He raised himself, stretching and gaping in his hammock. \r\nWe descended the ladder without being perceived by the rest of \r\nthe family, who continued to sleep soundly. The first thing we \r\nhad to do, was to awake the ass, who was to be of our party; \r\nand that he might not go without a load, I made him draw a very \r\nlarge branch of a tree, which I wanted for my undertaking. As \r\nwe walked along, I asked Ernest if he was not a little out of \r\nhumour at being obliged to get up so early, to set about a laborious \r\noccupation, instead of remaining with his brothers, to shoot \r\nat the thrushes and the pigeons on the fig tree?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Not in the least, father: now I am once up and dressed, \r\nI do not mind it at all; I like being with you, and assisting \r\nyou, very much. My brothers will leave plenty of birds for me \r\nto shoot; for I will lay any wager, that their first fire at \r\nleast will miss.\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think so, my boy?\r\n\r\nBecause they will all forget to take the balls out of the guns, \r\nand to put in shot in their place: besides, I am sure that they \r\nwill all fire from under the tree, and it is so high, that their \r\nshot cannot possibly reach it. I, for my part, have always fired \r\nfrom Tree Castle, which was the only way to succeed.\r\n\r\nYou may be right in your suspicions, answered I, but I have two \r\nremarks to make. The first is, that it would have been kinder and \r\nmore generous in you, to have told your brothers these particulars, \r\nthan to triumph in their ignorance; thus exposing them to spend \r\ntheir powder, which is so valuable an article, to no effect. \r\nThe second is, that though it gives me pleasure to see you act \r\nwith coolness and reflection, yet I am somewhat apprehensive \r\nof your falling into the habit of a certain slowness of decision, \r\nwhich may frequently prove injurious; there are occasions which \r\nrequire instant resolution, and cannot admit of a moment for \r\nreflection. He who, in a moment of alarm, of danger, or distress, \r\npreserves his presence of mind and decides instantly, has a great \r\nadvantage over him who waits to calculate every possibility before \r\nhe begins to act. This presence of mind, joined to great wisdom, \r\nis a quality of inestimable value, and it may be acquired by \r\ncultivating a habit of cool reflection and inquiry, as to how \r\nwe should act under such or such a circumstance. If we do not \r\nacquire this habit, we suffer ourselves to be under the dominion \r\nof fear at the time of danger, and are consequently defeated. \r\nLet us see, for example, what you would do if we were suddenly \r\nsurprised by a bear.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I almost believe I should run away as fast as I could.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And I believe so too; at least, you frankly assure \r\nme that it would be so. But if you were to reflect, you would \r\nconclude, that the bear having four legs and you only two, he \r\nwould run much faster and for a much longer time than you, and \r\nwould therefore soon overtake you.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Then I would fire upon him, if I had my gun; and now \r\nthat I reflect upon it, I will not go out any more without it.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This would still be acting without reflection; for \r\nyour gun might easily miss fire, or you might only slightly wound \r\nthe animal, and then you would have every thing to fear from \r\nhis rage.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Well, then, I would wait with coolness till he should \r\nbe only three steps from me; I would then fire my gun at his \r\nhead, which would for ever cure him of the inclination to attack \r\nme.\r\n\r\n_Father._—It would cure either you or him, to a certainty; for \r\nyou would run the risk of your gun’s missing fire, and it would \r\nthen be too late to try any other expedient; for you would be \r\ntorn to pieces in a moment.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Well, then, I would try another way. I would lie down \r\non the ground, hold my breath, and make believe I was dead, and \r\nthe bear would turn me over and over; for it is said they will \r\nnot touch a dead body.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is a great mistake; I would advise you not to \r\ntrust to it. Bears are often known to devour dead animals, and \r\nthat they are even a powerful attraction to them.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Oh, but I would be prepared with my clasp knife, with \r\nwhich I would settle him in a trice, or I would knock him on \r\nthe head with the end of my gun.\r\n\r\n_Father._—All ineffectual means, I assure you. Do you think you \r\nwould have strength enough to destroy so formidable a creature? \r\nor that you could penetrate so thick a hide with your clasp knife? \r\nNor would you have the resource of climbing up a tree, for bears \r\nclimb also. The only means you could use, and I confess it would \r\nbe most cruel, would be to give up the ass to him, by keeping \r\nhim before you in readiness. When the bear should begin the attack, \r\nyou might try to shoot him with your pistol, or to plunge your \r\nknife into his throat. But I trust we shall have no such animal \r\nto encounter; for I should be sorry to sacrifice our poor ass, \r\neven in defence of our own lives.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—And I too, father; but if there were no other means?\r\n\r\n_Father._—In such a case it is permitted to use the remedy, inhuman \r\nas it seems; while at the same time we should form a hope that \r\nit might be possible to save the ass also.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of conversation we reached the sea-shore, well content \r\nto have met with no bear, and at finding pieces of wood in great \r\nabundance, and to obtain which was the object of our walk. I \r\ndetermined to cut such pieces as I wanted, of the proper length, \r\nand to lay them cross-ways on the branches which the ass had \r\ndrawn to the place, and by this means to make them serve as a \r\nkind of sledge. We lost no time in setting to work, and we added \r\nto the load a little chest, which we found half buried in the \r\nsands, quite close to the waves. We also provided ourselves with \r\nsome poles which lay there, that we might use them as rollers, \r\nshould we stand in need of them for passing difficult places, \r\nand then we set out on our return to Falcon’s Stream. When we \r\nwere within a certain distance of our abode, we heard a loud \r\nfiring, which informed us that the attack upon the ortolans was \r\nin good train; but on seeing us approach, the cries of joy which \r\nwere uttered, resounded in every direction, and all ran eagerly \r\nto meet us. The chest we had brought was soon opened by a strong \r\nhatchet, for all were eager to see what was within. It contained \r\nonly some sailor’s dresses and some linen, which was quite wet \r\nwith the sea.\r\n\r\nI had to account to my wife for having absented myself with one \r\nof the boys, without giving her notice, or bidding her adieu. \r\nShe had been uneasy, and I confessed I had been to blame. In \r\nsuch a situation as ours, so many unforeseen and painful events \r\nmight happen! She had discovered, however, that we had taken \r\nthe ass with us, and this circumstance had consoled her. The \r\nsight of so many useful pieces of wood, and the promise of a \r\nsledge for better security in conveying her provisions for the \r\ntable, soon appeased her discontent, and we sat down tranquilly \r\nto breakfast.\r\n\r\nI next inspected the booty of the three sportsmen, who had shot, \r\nin all, no less than fifty ortolans and thrushes. As Ernest had \r\nforetold, their first fire missed; afterwards they had had various \r\nluck, now missing and now hitting, and had used so large a quantity \r\nof powder and shot, that when, by their brother’s advice, they \r\nwere about to get up the tree and fire from thence, my wife and \r\nI stopped them, recommending a more frugal use of those materials, \r\nas they were our only means of defence, or of procuring food \r\nin future, or at least till we could make another visit to the \r\nvessel. I taught them how to make some snares to be suspended \r\nfrom the branches of the fig-tree, and advised them to use the \r\nthread of the karata, which is as strong as horse-hair, for the \r\npurpose. What is new always amuses young persons, and the boys \r\naccordingly took a great fancy to this mode of sporting. Jack \r\nsucceeded in his very first attempt; I left Francis to assist \r\nhim, and took Fritz and Ernest to help me in making the sledge. \r\nAs we were all hard at work, for my wife had joined the youngest \r\nboys, we suddenly heard a prodigious clatter among the fowls; \r\nthe cock crowed louder than all the rest together, and the hens \r\nran to and fro, as if they were pursued by a fox. I wonder what \r\nis the matter with the creatures, said my wife, rising; every \r\nday I hear the hens clucking as if they had been laying eggs. \r\nAt this moment Ernest happened to look at the monkey, and remarked \r\nthat he fixed his piercing eyes on the hens; and when he saw \r\nmy wife approaching, driving the hens before her, he jumped quickly \r\ninto a hollow place, under one of the roots of the tree, and \r\nhid himself. Ernest ran to the place as soon as he, and was fortunate \r\nenough to seize him, seeing that he held a new-laid egg in his \r\npaw, which he was going to conceal in this place for a future \r\nregale. The monkey sprang immediately to such another hole, and \r\nErnest followed; here also he found some eggs, and brought them \r\nin his hat to his mother, who received them with great pleasure. \r\nThe monkey was so greedy of this food, that he was sure to seize \r\nthe eggs as soon as the hens had laid them. We inflicted no other \r\npunishment upon him for this little piece of knavery, than that \r\nof tying him up when the hens were about to lay. By this means, \r\nmy wife soon collected a considerable number of eggs, and we \r\nwaited with impatience for the time when the hens would sit, \r\nin the hope of seeing their species multiplied.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, Jack had got up into the tree, and had suspended \r\nsome of the snares to the branches, to catch the little devourers of \r\nour figs; he came down again to bring us the acceptable intelligence, \r\nthat our pigeons, which we brought from the vessel, had made \r\na sort of nest there of some dry grass, and that it already contained \r\nseveral eggs. I therefore forbade the boys from firing any more \r\nin the tree, for fear of alarming or wounding these gentle creatures. \r\nI also directed, that the snares should be frequently examined, \r\nto see that the pigeons were not caught in them, as they might \r\nbe strangled in their efforts to get loose. I should now even \r\nhave forbidden the use of the snares, if I had not myself made \r\nthem known to the boys, and that so very lately. It is imprudent \r\nat all times, for a tutor to contradict himself, and thus prove \r\nto his pupils that he was wrong in issuing such or such a command; \r\na single word revoked on the part of the tutor, will occasion \r\nten to be revoked by the pupil. We should always duly reflect \r\nbefore we lay a command on a child; but when once the word is \r\npronounced, it should never be recalled, whether from caprice, \r\nfrom a disposition to indulge the child, or even from conviction. \r\nMy sons had all murmured at my prohibition, in regard to the \r\ngunpowder; and little Francis with his innocent face came running \r\nto tell me, that we need only to sow some of it, and that he \r\nand his brothers were ready to bestow any labour, to have a large \r\nquantity of it at their own disposal. We all laughed heartily \r\nat the idea, and Professor Ernest did not overlook the advantage \r\nof the occasion, to display his science. My little sprig of wisdom, \r\ncried he, we may judge how much you know of what you are talking \r\nabout; your field of gunpowder indeed! Do you think then, that \r\ngunpowder comes from seeds, like oats?\r\n\r\n_Father._—How else, then, is it produced, Mr. Professor? At least, \r\nyou might be so good as to inform your little brother what you \r\nyourself know of its nature, since you laugh at his great ignorance \r\non the subject.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I know that it is produced by art, but of the manner \r\nin which it is made, I confess I am myself ignorant. I imagine \r\nthat it is prepared from charcoal, since it is so black, and \r\nthat sulphur, of which it smells so strong, is mixed with it.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Add some saltpetre, and your answer will not be amiss; \r\nthe saltpetre is in reality the principal ingredient; mixed with \r\ncharcoal, it easily takes fire, and rarefies or expands the air \r\nthat is mixed with it, by means of its elastic force. Touched \r\nwith a spark of fire, it acts with extraordinary vehemence, and \r\ndrives forward with astonishing force, whatever resists its action. \r\nSo that balls or shot, impelled by this irresistible force, strike \r\nthe object against which they impinge, so as to take away life: \r\nas you and I, and Fritz and Jack, see happen to us every day \r\nin letting off our guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boys now had a thousand questions to propose, which brought \r\non a sort of lesson in natural philosophy, as well as I could \r\nmake it such, with the degree of information I possessed, and \r\nwithout instruments for experiments. The eldest boys understood \r\nthe lesson pretty well, having previously some notion of the \r\nsubjects; but little Francis, on hearing me say that the heat \r\ncontained in bodies was brought out by motion or friction, asked, \r\nludicrously enough, whether, in running very fast, he should \r\nnot be in danger of being set on fire and burnt?\r\n\r\nYour ideas run too fast, my little fellow, said I; but this I \r\ncan tell you, that when a young boy like you, uses violent exercise, \r\nhe runs at least the risk of inflaming his blood, and getting \r\ninto a fever, or some other dangerous disease; and there results \r\nsomething like the burning you talk of, that may prove no less \r\ndangerous. But my remark is almost equally applicable to a person \r\nwho takes too little exercise, and abandons himself to idleness; \r\nfor such habits tend to vitiate the humours, and to corrupt the \r\nblood. Thus, my dear children, in this, as in every thing else, \r\nit is advisable to observe a just medium.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, I was busily employed upon my sledge, \r\nwhich was soon completed; and I found that necessity had converted \r\na preacher of moderate talents into a tolerably good carpenter. \r\nTwo bent pieces of wood, the segments of a circle, formed the \r\noutline of my machine, which I fixed in their places, by a straight \r\npiece of wood, placed across, and firmly fixed to the bent pieces \r\nin the middle, and at the rear. I then fastened two ropes to \r\nthe front of my work, and my sledge was finished. As I had not \r\nraised my eyes from my work, I did not know what my wife and \r\nthe two youngest boys had been about. On looking up, I perceived \r\nthat they had been stripping off the feathers from a quantity \r\nof birds, which the boys had killed, and that they afterwards \r\nspitted them on an officer’s sword, which my wife had turned \r\ninto this useful kitchen utensil. I approved of the idea; but \r\nI blamed her profusion of dressing more birds at once than we \r\ncould eat. She reminded me, that I had myself advised her to half \r\nroast the birds before putting into the butter, to be preserved for \r\nfuture use. She was in hopes, she said, that as I had now a sledge, \r\nI should not fail of going to Tent House after dinner, to fetch \r\nthe cask of butter, and in the mean while, she was endeavouring to \r\nbe ready with the birds. I had no objection to this, and immediately \r\ndetermined on going to Tent House the same day, and requested \r\nmy wife to hasten the dinner for that purpose. She replied that \r\nthis was already her intention, as she also had a little project \r\nin her head, which I should be informed of, at my return. I, \r\nfor my part, had one too, which was to take a bathe in the sea, \r\nand thus refresh myself from the heat and fatigue of my laborious \r\noccupations. I wished that Ernest, who was to accompany me, should \r\nbathe also; while Fritz was to remain at home for the protection \r\nof the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. \r\n\r\n_A bathing, a fishing, the jumping hare, and a masquerade._\r\n\r\nAs soon as Ernest and I had dined, we prepared for our departure. \r\nFritz presented each with one of the best cases of his own \r\nworkmanship, which we stuck through our belts, and which, in \r\nreality, were ingeniously contrived for holding spoons and knives and \r\nforks, while room was left in the middle for a little hatchet. I \r\npraised Fritz for having thus brought his idea to perfection, and for \r\ncontriving to make two cases with his skin instead of one. He \r\nhad used the skin of the two fore-legs of the animal for one, \r\nand of the two hind legs for the other, and reserved the place \r\nin the middle, for the hatchet. Ernest showed a warmth of gratitude \r\nfor his share in the benefit, of which I had not thought him \r\ncapable.\r\n\r\nWe now set about harnessing the ass and cow to our sledge; each \r\ntook a piece of bamboo-cane in hand, to serve as a whip; and \r\nresting our guns upon our shoulders, we began our journey. Ponto \r\nwas to accompany us, and Turk to remain behind. We bade adieu \r\nto our companions, and put our animals in motion. We took the \r\nroad by the sea-shore, where the sands afforded better travelling \r\nfor our vehicle, than the thick wild grass. We reached Family \r\nBridge, on Jackall’s River, and arrived at Tent House, without \r\neither obstacle or adventure. We immediately unharnessed the \r\nanimals to let them graze, while we set to work to load the sledge, \r\nwith the cask of butter, the cask of cheese, a small barrel of \r\ngunpowder, different instruments, some ball, some shot, and Turk’s \r\ncoat of mail. These exertions had so occupied our thoughts, that \r\nit was late when we first observed that our animals, attracted \r\nby the excellent quality of the grass on the other side of the \r\nriver, had repassed the bridge, and wandered so far as to be \r\nout of sight. I was in hopes they would be easily found, and \r\nI directed Ernest to go with Ponto and bring them back, intending \r\nin the mean time to look for a convenient place, on the other \r\nside of Tent House, to bathe in. In a short time I found myself \r\nat the extremity of Providence Bay, and which ended, as I now \r\nperceived, in a marsh, producing the finest bulrushes it was \r\npossible to imagine; and further on, a chain of steep rocks, \r\nadvancing somewhat into the sea, and forming a kind of creek, \r\nas if expressly contrived for bathing. The juttings of the rock \r\neven seemed like little separate cabinets, where one might be \r\nconcealed from one’s companions. Enchanted with this discovery, \r\nI called out to Ernest to come and join me, and in the mean time, \r\nI amused myself with cutting some of the rushes, and imagining \r\nwhat use I could apply them to. Ernest neither replied nor came: \r\nso, after waiting a little, I resolved to go in pursuit of him, \r\nfor I was unable to refrain from some uneasy sensations at his \r\nabsence. Looking about in all directions, I at length discovered \r\nhim at a distance, extended at his length on the ground, in the \r\nshade produced by Tent House. I approached him with a beating \r\nheart, fearing he might have been attacked by some wild beast; \r\nand was agreeably surprised at finding him in a sound and quiet \r\nsleep, while the ass and the cow were eating the grass close \r\nto the place where he lay.\r\n\r\nCome, come, young traveller, you must awake, cried I, shaking \r\nhim: while you are sleeping here, your animals may once more \r\nmake their escape. He instantly awoke starting, and was soon \r\non his feet. Oh! but I defy them to escape across the bridge, \r\nsaid he, rubbing his eyes; for I have taken away some of the \r\nplanks, and left a space which they will have no great inclination \r\nto jump over.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Since your idle fit has rendered you inventive, I forgive \r\nit with all my heart; but is it not a pity to lose in sleeping \r\nthe opportunity of doing something useful? Did you not promise \r\nyour mother to carry her some salt? Slothfulness is always a \r\nfault, where labour is a necessity.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—But, father, my head was not idle, I assure you. I \r\nwas planning something all the time.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Really, Ernest! Why, this is quite a novelty, for a \r\nboy of your age. Pray tell me what important and profound study \r\nit was, which made you go to sleep.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I will tell you. I was thinking, deeply, how difficult \r\nit would be to bring away from the vessel every thing which it \r\ncontains.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And did you hit upon some method for removing the \r\ndifficulty?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—No, father, no great things; I fell asleep in the middle \r\nof my reflections.\r\n\r\n_Father._—So, this is the hard work your poor head was engaged \r\nin!—Discovering a difficulty, and finding no means for conquering \r\nit!\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—At this very moment an idea strikes me.—We ought to \r\nhave a large raft; but the beams of the ship are too heavy for \r\nthe purpose: I think it would be better to take a number of the \r\nempty casks, and nail some planks upon them to keep them all \r\ntogether. I have read that the savages of America fill the skins \r\nof goats with air, tie them to each other, and are thus enabled \r\nto use them as rafts upon the largest rivers.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is a sound idea, and one day or other we may perhaps \r\nderive advantage from it: but for the present, my boy, we must \r\nmake up for lost time: run, therefore, and fill this little bag \r\nwith salt, which you will then empty into the large one that \r\nthe ass is to carry; and which you will take care to fill equally \r\non each side. During this time, I will take the refreshment of \r\nbathing; and then it will be your turn to bathe, and mine to \r\ntake care of the animals. I returned to the rocks, and was not \r\ndisappointed in my expectation of an enjoyment the most delicious; \r\nbut I did not stay long, fearing my boy might be impatient for \r\nhis share of so new a pleasure. When I had dressed myself, I \r\nreturned to the place, to see if his work had advanced; but he \r\nwas not there, and I supposed that he had again fallen asleep \r\nin some corner. Presently, however, I heard his voice calling \r\nout, father, father, a fish! a fish of monstrous size! Run quickly, \r\nfather, I can hardly hold him! he is eating up the string of \r\nmy line! I ran to the place from which the voice proceeded, and \r\nfound Ernest lying along the ground on his face, upon the extremity \r\nof a point of land, and pulling in his line, to which a large \r\nfish was hanging, and beating about with all his strength. I \r\nran hastily and snatched the rod out of his hand, for I had some \r\napprehension that the weight and activity of the fish, would \r\npull him into the water. I gave a certain liberty to the line, \r\nto calm the fish, and then contrived to draw him gently along, \r\ntill I had got him safely into a shallow, from which he could \r\nno longer escape, and thus the animal was effectually secured. \r\nWe next examined him thoroughly, and it appeared to me that it \r\ncould not weigh less than fifteen pounds; so that our capture \r\nwas magnificent, and would afford the greatest pleasure to our \r\ngood steward of provisions at Falcon’s Stream. You have now really \r\nlaboured, said I to Ernest, not only with your head, but with \r\nyour whole body; and I would advise you to wipe the perspiration \r\nfrom your face, and keep a little quiet before you venture into \r\nthe water. You have procured us a dish of great excellence, which \r\nwill last for several days, and have conducted yourself like \r\na true chevalier, without fear and without reproach.\r\n\r\nIt was at least fortunate, observed he in a modest tone, that \r\nI thought of bringing my fishing-rod.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Certainly it was. But tell me how you came to see this \r\nlarge fish, and what made you think you could catch it?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I used to remark when we lived at Tent House, that \r\nthere were innumerable quantities of fish in the water, just \r\nhereabout; the recollection of this circumstance made me determine \r\nto bring my fishing-tackle with me. In my way to the place where \r\nwe keep the salt, I perceived a great number of little crabs, \r\nupon which fishes feed, near the water’s brink; I thought I would \r\ntry to bait my hook with one of them; so I hurried my task of \r\nfetching the salt, and came to this spot, where at first I caught \r\nonly about a dozen little fish, which are there in my handkerchief; \r\nbut at the same time I remarked, that they were chased in the \r\nwater by fishes of larger size. This gave me the idea of baiting \r\nmy hook with one of the small ones; but the hook was too small, \r\nand my rod too weak. I then took one of the finest of the bulrushes \r\nyou had just gathered, and put a larger hook to my line, and \r\nin a short time the large fish you see there seized upon the \r\nbait, and paid his life for his voracity. However, I must confess, \r\nthat if you had not come to my assistance, I must either have \r\nlet go my line, or have been dragged into the water; for the \r\nfish was stronger than I.\r\n\r\nWe now examined the smaller fishes he had caught, which for the \r\nmost part, appeared to me to consist of trout and herrings, while \r\nI felt certain that the large one was a salmon. I immediately \r\ncut them all open, and rubbed them in the inside with salt, that \r\nthey might not be injured by the heat. While I was employed in \r\nthis occupation, Ernest went to the rocks and bathed, and I had \r\ntime to fill some more bags with salt, before his return. We \r\nthen set about harnessing and loading our animals; after which \r\nwe restored the planks which had been taken from the bridge, \r\nand then resumed the road to Falcon’s Stream.\r\n\r\nWhen we had proceeded about half way, Ponto, who had been walking \r\nquietly on before us, suddenly escaped, and by his barking gave \r\nus notice that he scented some game. We soon after saw him pursuing \r\nan animal, which seemed endeavouring to escape, and made the \r\nmost extraordinary jumps imaginable. The dog continuing to follow, \r\nthe creature in trying to avoid him, passed within gun-shot of \r\nthe place where I stood. I fired, but its flight was so rapid, \r\nthat I did not hit. Ernest, who was at a small distance behind, \r\nhearing the report of my gun, prepared his own, and fired it \r\noff at the instant the singular animal was passing near him, \r\nin pursuit of a hiding-place among the tall herbage just by: \r\nhe had fired so skilfully, that the animal fell dead at the same \r\ninstant. I ran hastily, and with extreme curiosity, to ascertain \r\nwhat kind of quadruped it might be. We found it, in form and \r\ngeneral appearance, the most remarkable possible to conceive. \r\nIt was of the size of a sheep, with a tail resembling that of \r\na tiger; both its snout and hair were like those of a mouse, \r\nand its teeth were like a hare’s, but much larger; the fore legs \r\nresembled those of the squirrel, and were extremely short; but \r\nto make up of this, its hind legs were as long as a pair of stilts, \r\nand of a form strikingly singular. We examined the creature for \r\na long time in silence; I could not be sure that I had ever seen \r\nan engraving of it in any Natural History, or a description of \r\nit in any book of Travels. Ernest, after a long and close examination, \r\ninterrupted our silence by an exclamation of joy: And have I \r\nreally killed this extraordinary animal? said he, clapping his \r\nhands together. What will my mother and my brothers say? How \r\nastonished they will be! and how fortunate I am in securing so \r\nfine a prize! What do you think is its name, father? I would \r\ngive all the world to know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shooting the Kangaroo]\r\n\r\n_Father._—And so would I, my boy; but I am as ignorant as you. \r\nOne thing, however, is certain, that this is your lucky day; \r\nfor you have already performed two wonderful feats, by destroying \r\ntwo monsters, in the course of it; so that I shall be tempted \r\nto give you the name of my little Hercules. You also sometimes \r\ndeserve that of my little Solomon. So let us both examine this \r\ninteresting stranger with attention, that we may be certain to \r\nwhat family of quadrupeds it belongs: this will perhaps throw \r\na light upon its name.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I think it can hardly be named a quadruped; for the \r\nlittle fore legs look much more like hands, as is the case with \r\nmonkeys.\r\n\r\n_Father._—They are notwithstanding legs, I can assure you. Let \r\nus look for its name among the animals who give suck; on this \r\npoint we cannot be mistaken. Now let us examine its teeth.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Here are the four incisory teeth, like the squirrel——.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Thus we see that it belongs to the order of Nibblers. \r\nNow let us look for some names of animals of this kind.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Besides the squirrels, I recollect only the mice, the \r\nmarmots, the hares, the beavers, the porcupines, and the jumpers.\r\n\r\n_Father._—The jumpers! That word furnishes the necessary clue; \r\nthe animal is completely formed like the gerboa or jumping hare, \r\nexcept that it is twice the size of those of which I have read \r\na description . . . . . . Wait a moment, an idea strikes me. I will lay a \r\nwager that our animal is one of the large jumpers, called kangaroo; \r\nit belongs properly to the genus _Didelphis_ or _Philander_; \r\nbecause the female, who never bears more than one young one, \r\ncarries it in a kind of purse placed between her hind legs. To \r\nthe best of my knowledge, this animal has never been seen but \r\non the coast of New Holland, where it was first observed by the \r\ncelebrated navigator Captain Cook. You may then be highly flattered \r\nwith your adventure, in killing an animal at once so rare and \r\nso remarkable.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—You had very nearly, however, deprived me of the honour. \r\nHow happened it, father, that you missed him? you, who are so \r\nmuch better a shot than I! I confess I should have been much \r\nmortified in your place.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I, on the contrary, rejoice in the circumstance.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Well, that is droll enough; and I cannot understand \r\nhow any one can rejoice at having missed an animal in firing. \r\nWill you explain it to me?\r\n\r\n_Father._—I rejoice, because I love my son better than myself, \r\nand take a more lively interest in his pleasure, and in any little \r\ncause of exultation he may have, than if the occasion were more \r\nimmediately connected with myself.—Ernest, affected by my remark, \r\nran to embrace me. How truly I recognise in this assurance the \r\nkind temper of my ever indulgent father! cried he.—Your gratitude \r\nbut increases my satisfaction, added I, embracing him in my turn; \r\nbut now let us see if we shall be able to drag the animal to \r\nthe sledge. Ernest requested that I would rather assist him to \r\ncarry it, as he was afraid of spoiling its beautiful mouse-coloured \r\nskin, by dragging it on the ground. I therefore tied the fore \r\nlegs of the kangaroo together; and by means of two canes, we \r\nwith considerable trouble contrived to carry it to the sledge, \r\nupon which it was securely fastened.\r\n\r\nPonto, who first discovered the kangaroo, had lost the scent, \r\nand was scampering about in the tall grass, no doubt with the \r\nhope of recovering his prey. We called him to us, and loaded \r\nhim with caresses and applauses: but he seemed indifferent to \r\nour most flattering addresses; he kept close to the kangaroo, \r\nand licked its wound, which was still bleeding. Having now nothing \r\nmore to detain us, we continued our road towards Falcon’s Stream. \r\nAs we walked along, we conversed on the subject of natural history, \r\nand on the necessity of studying it in our youth, that we might \r\nlearn to class plants and animals according to their characteristic \r\nmarks; and we observed, that to such a knowledge as this it was \r\nowing, that we had recognised the kangaroo. Ernest entreated \r\nme to tell him all I knew about the animal. It is, said I, a \r\nmost singular kind of creature; and having hitherto been little \r\nobserved, it furnishes but few particulars for narration. Its \r\nfore legs, as you see, have scarcely the third part of the length \r\nof the hind ones, and the most it can do, is to make them serve the \r\npurpose of walking; but the hind legs enable it to make prodigious \r\njumps, the same as in the flea and the grasshopper. The food \r\nof the kangaroo consists of herbs and roots, which they dig up \r\nvery skilfully with their fore legs. They place themselves upon \r\ntheir hind legs, which are doubled under them, as if on a chair, \r\nand by this means are able to look above even the tall kinds \r\nof grass; they rest too upon their tail, which is exceedingly \r\nstrong, and is also of great use to them in jumping, by assisting \r\nthe spring from the ground. It is said that the kangaroo, if \r\ndeprived of its tail, would scarcely be able to jump at all.\r\n\r\nWe at length arrived happily, though somewhat late, at Falcon’s \r\nStream, having heard from a great distance the kind welcome of \r\nthe salutations of our family. Our companions all ran to meet \r\nus: but it was now, on seeing the ludicrous style of the dress \r\nof the three boys, our turn for immoderate fits of laughter: \r\none had on a sailor’s shirt, which trained round him like the \r\nrobe of a spectre; another was buried in a pair of pantaloons, \r\nwhich were fastened round his neck and reached to the ground; \r\nand the third had a long waistcoat which came down to the instep, \r\nand gave him the exact form of a travelling portmanteau. They \r\nall tried to jump about; but finding this impossible from the \r\nlength of their garments, they next resolved to carry off the \r\nwhole with an air, by strutting slowly to and fro in the manner \r\nof a great personage in a theatre. After some hearty laughing, \r\nI inquired of my wife what could be the cause of this masquerade, \r\nand whether she had assisted them in attempting to act a comedy \r\nfor our amusement. She disclosed the mystery by informing me, \r\nthat her three boys had also been into the water, to bathe, and \r\nthat while they were thus engaged, she had washed all their clothes; \r\nbut as they had not dried so soon as she expected, her little \r\nrioters had become impatient, and had fallen on the chest of \r\nsailor’s clothes, and each had taken from it what article he \r\npleased. I preferred, said she, that you should see them in this \r\nodd sort of a disguise rather than quite naked, like little savages; \r\nin which opinion, I assured her that I heartily joined.\r\n\r\nIt was now our turn to give an account of our journey: in proportion \r\nas we advanced in our narrative, we presented, one after another, \r\ncasks, bulrushes, salt, fish, and lastly, with infinite triumph, \r\nour beautiful kangaroo. In a trice it was surrounded, examined, \r\nand admired by all, and such a variety of questions asked, that \r\nErnest and I scarcely knew which to answer first. Fritz was the \r\nonly one who was a little silent. I saw plainly by his countenance, \r\nwhat was passing in his mind. He was jealous of the good fortune of \r\nhis brother Ernest; but I also saw, that he was struggling manfully \r\nagainst the ascendancy of so mean a passion, and was resolving \r\nto conquer it. In a short time, he had succeeded so completely, \r\nthat he joined frankly and unaffectedly in our conversation \r\nand merriment, and I am persuaded, no one but myself perceived \r\nwhat was passing in his mind. He came near the kangaroo, and \r\nexamined it with great attention; then turning to his brother, \r\nhe observed to him in a kind tone, that he had had good luck, \r\nand that he must be a good shot to have killed the kangaroo with \r\nso little difficulty. But, father, said he, when you go again \r\nto Tent House, or on any other excursion, will it not be my turn \r\nto go with you? For here at Falcon’s Stream there is nothing \r\nnew to amuse us; a few thrushes, and some pigeons; this is all \r\nwe have from day to day, and I find it very tiresome.\r\n\r\nI will promise you with all my heart what you desire, my dear \r\nboy, said I, for you have valiantly combated the ill humour and \r\nthe jealousy which assailed your temper, on witnessing your brother’s \r\nsuccess with the kangaroo. I therefore promise, that you shall \r\naccompany me in my very next excursion, which will probably take \r\nplace at no greater distance of time than tomorrow; and it will be \r\nanother journey to the vessel. But in the mean time, let me observe \r\nto you, my dear Fritz, that you ought to be more flattered with \r\nthe high opinion I must entertain of your prudence and judgement, \r\nin leaving you here, in charge of your mother and your brothers, \r\nthan with the applause due to the event of killing a kangaroo. \r\nYou have accomplished an important duty, in keeping near them \r\nall the time, and not suffering yourself to be allured by such \r\namusements as presented themselves to your fancy; and this conduct \r\nhas increased my affection and respect for you. Some praise is \r\nalso due to Ernest, for the moderation with which he has felt \r\nhis triumph, in so extraordinary an occurrence; for he has not \r\neven told you of my humiliating failure in attempting to shoot \r\nthe kangaroo. To triumph over our passions, and to have on all \r\noccasions a perfect government of our temper, is an acquisition \r\nof infinitely more value, than the showing a certain skill in \r\nfiring off a gun, and killing an innocent animal. We happen, \r\nin our situation, to be forced upon the cultivation of such arts \r\nas these; but though we may practise them as necessary for our \r\nexistence, we have no reason to be proud of them.\r\n\r\nWe concluded the day with our ordinary occupations; I gave some \r\nsalt to each of our animals, to whom it was an acceptable treat. \r\nWe next skinned our kangaroo, and put it carefully aside till \r\nthe next day, when we intended to cut it to pieces, and lay such \r\nparts in salt, as we could not immediately consume. We made an \r\nexcellent supper on our little fish, to which we added some potatoes, \r\nnor were our faithful companions Turk and Ponto neglected. The \r\nlabours of the day had more than usually disposed us all to seek \r\nrepose; we therefore said our prayers at an early hour, mounted \r\nour ladder, and were soon asleep.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF PART I.\r\n\r\n_Printed by Richard and Arthur Taylor, Shoe-Lane, London._\r\n\r\n_The Editor of this work promises, in a note annexed to the \r\nConclusion, that the Continuation of the story shall be given to the \r\npublic in the following season.

Our dogs were so well satisfied the preceding evening with \r\ntheir meal on the entrails of the animal, that they became partial \r\nto it, and had just sprung up in the design of making a complete \r\nbreakfast of the whole carcase. Before I was at the bottom of \r\nthe ladder, they had torn off the head of the kangaroo, which \r\nI had suspended at some height by the hind feet, and, half friends \r\nhalf foes, they were going to divide it amongst them, when my \r\npresence opportunely prevented the partition. It occurred to \r\nme, that as I had neither cellar nor safe to keep my provisions \r\nin, it behoved me to give them a slight correction: growling and \r\nbarking, they took refuge under the roots, and the half-suppressed \r\nkind of howling they continued to make, awoke my wife, who, on \r\nmissing me, came down alarmed to know what was the matter. For \r\nthe love of God, exclaimed she, what has happened? Are the dogs \r\nrun mad, or have you lost your senses?—Nothing of the kind, I \r\nanswered; I was only giving our dogs a short sermon on temperance \r\nand the necessity of self-control.—Then better it would be to \r\nenforce your precepts by example, to begin by subduing anger, \r\nand not by exercising your vengeance on poor faithful animals, \r\nwho are innocent, and unconscious of the mischief they are doing.\r\n\r\nKind-hearted creature, said I: it is well known to me how glad \r\nyou would be if there were no sticks in the world! But I assure \r\nyou I did not beat Turk and Ponto through anger or revenge, but \r\nfrom prudence and precaution; and be persuaded I have not hurt \r\nthem much: they modestly intended only to eat up our kangaroo, \r\nwhich you promised yourself such pleasure in cooking; and unable \r\nas I was to acquaint them in the canine tongue, that it was not \r\nplaced there for their use, it was proper to let them know this \r\nin such a way as to deter them in future; otherwise, as they \r\nare strongest, they would end by devouring all our stock.\r\n\r\nMy wife owned I was in the right: but I observed her from a corner of \r\nmy eye hovering about the roots, and patting the dogs to console them. \r\nAs to myself, I set about stripping my kangaroo, and endeavoured \r\nto remove the skin entirely without injuring it; but this gave \r\nme so much trouble, and I advanced so slowly in the business, \r\nthat all my little family were assembled about me and their mother, \r\nand calling out, Famine, before I had finished my work. Having \r\ncompleted it, I went to the stream to wash myself thoroughly, \r\nand then to the sailor’s chest to change my coat, that I might \r\nmake a decent appearance at breakfast, and give my sons an example \r\nof that cleanliness which their mother was at all times eager \r\nto inculcate. Breakfast over, I ordered Fritz to prepare everything \r\nto go to Tent-House, and prepare our boat, that we might proceed \r\nto the vessel. At the moment of departure, wishing to take leave \r\nof all my family, I found that Ernest and Jack were wanting: \r\ntheir mother knew no more than myself what was become of them, \r\nbut she thought they were gone to get some potatoes, which we \r\nwanted. I charged her to reprove them a little for this, to prevent \r\ntheir accustoming themselves to stray from home alone and without \r\nleave, in an unknown country; but they had taken Turk along with \r\nthem this time, and I was therefore the less uneasy.\r\n\r\nWe began our journey after having taken an affectionate leave \r\nof my wife and of my little Francis. I left Ponto with her, and \r\nI entreated her not to be uneasy, and to commit herself to the \r\ncare of the kind Providence who had till then so graciously watched \r\nover us, and who would again bring us back to her safe and sound, \r\nenriched with many things conducive to our welfare. But to bring \r\nher to reason on the subject of these trips to the vessel, was \r\nimpracticable: I left her bathed in tears, and praying God that \r\nthis might be the last.\r\n\r\nWe separated with mutual emotion, hastening our steps to make \r\nour stay the shorter, and we soon reached and crossed the bridge: \r\nat this moment, to our astonishment, we heard the shrill sounds \r\nof human voices, and almost at the same time we saw Ernest and \r\nmaster Jack come forth from a bush, delighted to have half alarmed \r\nus.—Ah! did not you think we were savages? said Jack;—or some \r\nof the vessel’s company? continued Ernest.\r\n\r\n——Or rather, said I, two little thoughtless rogues whom I soon \r\nknew, and am much inclined to chide as they deserve, not for \r\ntheir little artifice, but for having left their home without \r\npermission.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Oh! father, we have such a desire to go with you to \r\nthe vessel, and we were afraid you would refuse us if we asked \r\nyou; but we thought that when you saw us so near to the place, \r\nyou would consent to our accompanying you.\r\n\r\nVery badly argued, my young gentleman, replied I. At Falcon’s \r\nStream I might perhaps have consented, although I have so many \r\nthings to take, that it would be wrong to let you occupy a place \r\nin the boat; but as it is, I would on no account leave your poor \r\nmother in anxiety the whole day as to what is become of you, \r\nand you cannot yourselves desire it: besides, I have a commission \r\nto give you for her that I have much at heart. I then requested \r\nthem to tell her that it was probable we should be forced to \r\npass the night on board the vessel, and not return to her till the \r\nevening of the following day. I knew that was what she most feared, \r\nand I had wanted resolution to apprise her of this possibility: \r\nI was to blame for this weakness, for not to see us return at \r\nthe expected time was still more painful; yet it was of essential \r\nconsequence to get out of the vessel, if it yet remained afloat, all \r\nthat could be saved, as every moment might complete its destruction, \r\nand all our future hopes be swallowed up with it. With this view \r\nI told my sons what they should say to their mother; I exhorted \r\nthem to obey and to assist her; and that their excursion might \r\nnot be useless, I made them collect some salt, and I enjoined \r\nthem to be at Falcon’s Stream before noon. I suffered in knowing \r\nthe double anguish of my poor wife, resulting from our departure \r\nand the prolonged absence of two of her sons. To be sure of the \r\nfulfilment of this order, I requested Fritz to lend Ernest his \r\nsilver watch, and told him he would find a gold one in the vessel, \r\nin which case he would allow his brother to keep the one he lent \r\nhim, and that we might perhaps get another for Jack. This hope \r\nfilled them with joy, and consoled them for not going on with \r\nus.\r\n\r\nAfter having bid adieu to our dear boys, we got into the boat, \r\nand we left the shore to gain the current of the stream: thus \r\nwe quickly cleared Safety Bay, and reached the vessel, whose \r\nopen side offered us an ample space to get up it. As soon as \r\nwe had got on board and our boat was securely fastened, our first \r\ncare was to look out for fit materials to construct a raft. I \r\nwished to begin by executing an excellent idea suggested by my \r\nson Ernest. Our boat being built of staves had neither room nor \r\nsolidity enough to carry a considerable burthen; we therefore \r\nlooked about, and soon found a sufficient number of water-casks \r\nwhich appeared to me very proper for my intended new enterprise. \r\nWe immediately emptied them, then replaced the bungs carefully, \r\nand threw the casks overboard, after securing them by means of \r\nropes and cramps, so as to keep them together at the vessel’s \r\nside: this completed, we placed a sufficient number of planks \r\nupon them to form a firm and commodious platform or deck, to \r\nwhich we added a gunwale of a foot in depth all round, to secure \r\nthe lading. Thus we contrived to possess a very handsome raft, \r\nin which we could stow thrice as much as in our boat. This laborious \r\ntask had taken up the whole day; we scarcely allowed ourselves \r\na minute to eat a mouthful of cold meat we had provided for the \r\nexpedition, that we might not lose any time in looking for the \r\nprovisions on board the vessel. In the evening, Fritz and I were \r\nso weary, that it would have been impossible for us to row back \r\nto land, even if our business had not detained us; we therefore \r\ncame to the necessary resolution of passing the night on board; \r\nand having taken all due precautions in case of a storm, we reposed \r\nourselves in the captain’s cabin, on a good elastic mattress \r\nessentially different from our hammocks: in fact, it so lulled \r\nus to rest, and induced such sound repose, that our prudent design \r\nto watch in turn for fear of accident, quite escaped us, and \r\nwe both slept heavily, side by side, till broad day-light opened \r\nour eyes, when we awoke with lively gratitude to that Providence \r\nto whom we were indebted for the quiet and comfortable night \r\nwe had passed. We rose, and actively set to work to load our \r\nraft.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we completely stripped the cabin which had \r\nbeen occupied by my family on board the vessel, removing every \r\nthing it contained which belonged to us previous to the fatal \r\nevent of the wreck: from it we proceeded to the one in which \r\nwe had slept so well, and carried off the very doors and windows, \r\nwith their appendages; some valuable chests of the officers were \r\nthere: but this discovery and the rich lace clothes which seemed \r\nto court our grasp, were less acceptable to us than the carpenter’s \r\nand gunner’s chests, containing all their tools and implements: \r\nthose we could remove with levers and rollers, were put entire \r\nupon the raft; and we took out of the others what rendered them \r\ntoo heavy. One of the captain’s chests was filled with a number \r\nof costly articles, which no doubt he meant to dispose of to \r\nthe opulent planters of Port Jackson, or among the savages. In \r\nthe collection were several gold and silver watches, snuff-boxes \r\nof all descriptions, buckles, shirt-buttons, necklaces, rings, \r\nin short an abundance of all the trifles of European luxury; \r\nthere was also a strong box full of louis d’or and dollars, which \r\nattracted our notice less than another containing a very pretty \r\ntable-service of fine steel, which we had substituted for the \r\ncaptain’s that were silver, and for which my wife had shown no \r\nsmall regard: but the discovery that delighted me most, and for \r\nwhich I would readily have given the box with the louis, &c. \r\nwas a chest containing some dozens of young plants of every species \r\nof European fruits, which had been carefully packed in moss for \r\ntransportation. I perceived pear, plum, almond, peach, apple, \r\napricot, chesnut trees, and vine shoots. I beheld with a feeling \r\nI cannot describe, those productions of my dear country, which \r\nonce so agreeably embellished my rural dwelling, and which, if \r\nGod vouchsafed to bless them, would thrive in a foreign soil. \r\nWe discovered a number of bars of iron and large pigs of lead, \r\ngrinding-stones, cart-wheels ready for mounting, a complete set \r\nof farrier’s instruments, tongs, shovels, ploughshares, rolls \r\nof iron and copper wire, sacks full of maize, pease, oats, vetches, \r\nand even a little hand-mill. The vessel had been freighted with \r\nevery thing likely to be useful in an infant colony so distant; \r\nnothing had been forgotten. We found a saw-mill, in a separated \r\nstate, but each piece numbered, and so accurately fitted, that \r\nnothing was easier than to put it together for use.\r\n\r\nI had now to consider what of all these treasures I should take \r\nor leave. It was impossible to carry with us in one trip such \r\na quantity of goods; and to leave them in the vessel, ready to \r\nfall to pieces and threatened every moment with complete destruction, \r\nwas exposing ourselves to be wholly deprived of them, while every \r\narticle so lost would be a subject of regret to us.\r\n\r\nAh! said Fritz, let us leave, in the first place, this useless \r\nmoney and the chest of trinkets; except the watches we promised \r\nmy brothers: all the rest can be of no service to us.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure, my boy, to hear you speak thus of gold, \r\nthat idol so universally adored: we will do, then, as you wish, \r\nand determine upon taking with us what is really useful, such \r\nas the powder, lead, iron, the corn and the fruit-trees, implements \r\nfor gardening and agriculture; let us take as many as possible \r\nof these: if we should have any room left, we can then select \r\na few of the objects of luxury: however, begin by taking from \r\nthe chest the two watches I have promised, and keep the best \r\nof them for yourself.\r\n\r\nWe then loaded our raft, not without difficulty and hard labour; \r\nwe moreover stowed away for use in a chest, a large and handsome \r\nfishing-net, quite new, and the vessel’s great compass. With \r\nthe net, Fritz found luckily two harpoons and a rope windlass, \r\nsuch as they use in the whale fishery. Fritz asked me to let \r\nhim place the windlass, with the harpoons attached to the end \r\nof the rope, over the bow of our tub-boat, and thus hold all \r\nin readiness in case of seeing any large fish; and as I thought \r\nit was unusual to meet with these so near the shore, I indulged \r\nhim in his innocent fancy.\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon before we had finished our lading; for not only \r\nour raft was as full as it could hold, but our boat likewise.\r\n\r\nHaving well and completely executed our undertaking, both as \r\nto construction and lading, we stepped into the tub-boat, and \r\nwith some small difficulty, which a little reflection and a few \r\nexperiments soon enabled us to overcome, we pushed out for the \r\ncurrent, drawing our raft triumphantly after us with a stout \r\nrope, which we had been careful to fasten securely at its head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. \r\n\r\n_The tortoise harnessed._ \r\n\r\nThe wind was in a humour favourable to our undertaking, and briskly \r\nswelled our sail; the sea was calm, and we advanced without fear \r\nat a considerable rate. Fritz had been looking steadfastly for \r\nsome time at something of a large size which was floating at \r\nsome distance on the water, and he now desired me to take the \r\nglass and see what it could be. I soon perceived distinctly that \r\nit was a tortoise, which, agreeably to the habits of its singular \r\nspecies, had fallen asleep in the sun on the surface of the water, \r\nand we observed that it did not in the least appear sensible \r\nof our approach. No sooner had Fritz gained this information, \r\nthan he earnestly entreated me to steer softly within view of \r\nso extraordinary a creature, that he might examine it at his \r\nease. I readily consented; but as his back was towards me, and \r\nthe sail was between us, I did not observe what he was about, \r\ntill a violent jerk of the boat, a sudden turning of the windlass, \r\nand then a second jerk, accompanied by a rapid motion of the \r\nboat, gave me the necessary explanation. For Heaven’s sake what \r\nare you about, Fritz? exclaimed I. Have you a mind to destroy \r\nus with your thoughtlessness, which has put it out of my power \r\nto govern the boat?\r\n\r\n——I have caught him,—I touched him, cried Fritz, without hearing \r\none word I had been saying.—The tortoise is ours, it cannot escape, \r\nfather! Is not this then a valuable prize, for it will furnish \r\ndinners for us all for many weeks!\r\n\r\nI soon admitted the idea that in reality the harpoon had secured \r\nthe animal, which, feeling itself wounded, thus agitated the \r\nvessel in its endeavours to be disengaged, for the rope of the \r\nharpoon was necessarily fastened at the other end to the windlass. \r\nI quickly pulled down the sail, and seizing a hatchet, sprung \r\nto the boat’s head to cut the rope, and let the harpoon and the \r\ntortoise go; but Fritz caught hold of my arm, conjuring me to \r\nwait a moment, there being no immediate cause for alarm, and \r\nnot so hastily bring upon him the mortification of losing, at \r\none stroke, the harpoon, the rope, and the tortoise; he proposed \r\nwatching himself, with the hatchet in his hand to cut the rope \r\nsuddenly should any sign of danger appear. I yielded to his \r\nentreaties, after a due exhortation to him to take good care not \r\nto upset the boat, or run her upon the rocks.\r\n\r\nThus then, drawn along by the tortoise, we proceeded with a hazardous \r\nrapidity, and having no small difficulty to keep the rudder in \r\na straight direction, and so to steady the boat, as to prevent \r\nher yielding to the irregular motions of so singular a conductor. \r\nIn a little time I observed that the creature was making for \r\nthe sea; I therefore again hoisted the sail; and as the wind \r\nwas to the land, and very brisk, the tortoise found resistance \r\nof no avail: he accordingly fell into the track we desired to \r\ntake, and we soon gained the current which had always received \r\nus in our visits to and from the wreck: he drew us straight towards \r\nour usual place of landing, and by good fortune without striking \r\nupon any of the rocks which so much abound in that spot. We, \r\nhowever, did not disembark without encountering one difficult \r\nadventure. I perceived that the state of the tide was such, that \r\nwe should be thrown upon one of the sand-banks, and this accordingly \r\ntook place: we were at this time within a gun-shot of the shore; \r\nthe boat, though driven with violence, remained perfectly upright \r\nin the sand. I stepped into the water, which did not reach far \r\nabove my knees, for the purpose of conferring upon our conductor \r\nhis just reward for the alarm he had caused us, when he suddenly \r\ngave a plunge, and I saw him no more; following the rope, I however \r\nsoon found the tortoise stretched at length at the bottom of \r\nthe water, where it was so shallow that I was not long in finding \r\nmeans to put an end to his pain by cutting off his head with \r\nthe hatchet; when he soon bled to death. Being now near Tent-House, \r\nFritz gave a halloo, and fired a gun, to apprise our relatives \r\nthat we were not only arrived, but arrived in triumph. This soon \r\nproduced the desired effect: the good mother and her three young \r\nones soon appeared, running towards us; upon which Fritz jumped \r\nout of the boat, placed the head of our sea-prize on the muzzle \r\nof his gun, and walked to shore, which I reached at the same \r\nmoment; and all were once more received with the kindest salutations, \r\nand such questions as kindness best knows how to propose.\r\n\r\nAfter some gentle reproaches from my wife, for leaving her and \r\nthe boys for so long a time, the history of the tortoise was \r\nrelated in due form, and excited due interest and much merriment \r\nin our auditors. The tender-hearted mother, after heaving a sigh \r\nfor the hard fate of the creature, began to shudder at the thought \r\nof the danger we had been exposed to, and the escape we had effected. \r\nWe all now fell to a new examination of the adventure, and were \r\nstruck with surprise that Fritz should so exactly have hit the \r\nvulnerable part of the animal, at the first plunge of the harpoon: \r\nnext that the tortoise should have gone to sleep, and left this \r\nvery part exposed, contrary to his usual habit of drawing the \r\nneck within his shell; and lastly, that with the harpoon stuck \r\nin his flesh, and sunk still deeper by the act of drawing in \r\nhis head to save himself, he should yet have been able to pull \r\na heavy laden boat and a raft tied to it, along, with even an \r\nalarming degree of rapidity.\r\n\r\nOur conversation being ended, I requested my wife to go with \r\ntwo of the younger boys to Falcon’s Stream, and fetch the sledge \r\nand the beasts of burden, that we might not fail of seeing at \r\nleast a part of our booty from the ship put safely under shelter \r\nthe same evening. A tempest, or even the tide, might sweep away \r\nthe whole during the night! We took every precaution in our power \r\nagainst the latter danger, by fixing the boat and the raft, now, \r\nat the time of its reflux, as securely as we could without an \r\nanchor. I rolled two prodigious masses of lead, with the assistance \r\nof levers, from the raft upon the shore, and then tied a rope \r\nto each, the other ends of which were fastened, one to the raft, \r\nand the other to the boat, and thus satisfied myself that they \r\ncould not easily be forced away.\r\n\r\nWhile we were employed on this scheme, the sledge arrived, and \r\nwe immediately placed the tortoise upon it, and also some other \r\narticles of light weight, such as mattresses, pieces of linen, \r\n&c.; for I reckoned that the animal itself weighed at least three \r\nquintals, the strength of our whole party was found necessary \r\nto move it from the raft to the sledge: we therefore all set \r\nout together to unload it again at Falcon’s Stream. We pursued \r\nour way thither with the utmost gaiety of heart, and found the \r\ntime pass both agreeably and quickly, in answering the numerous \r\nquestions with which the three youngest boys assailed us, as \r\nto the nature and amount of the treasures we had brought from \r\nthe vessel. The chest containing the articles in silver, and \r\nanother filled with trinkets and utensils made of different kinds \r\nof metals, the most powerfully excited their interest; for Fritz \r\nhad dropped a hint of what was in them, and nothing could exceed \r\nthe measure of their curiosity.—Are they left on the raft or \r\nin the boat? asked Ernest. We will open them to-morrow, and I \r\nshall have my watch.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I assure you, I shall not be content with only a watch; \r\nI must have, since I hear there are so many, a snuff-box also.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—And I shall ask for a pretty purse filled with louis.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Vastly well imagined, my young ones.—Jack intends then, \r\nI presume, to take now and then a pinch of the snuff he has not \r\ngot, and Francis perhaps means to sow his louis that they may \r\nproduce him a crop.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Now, father, you are for this once mistaken; I have no \r\nliking for snuff, and know very well we have not any: what I \r\nwant the box for is, to preserve in it the seeds I mean to collect \r\nfrom all the charming plants that we see around us, as, should \r\nwe ever return to Europe, I could then have them in our garden. \r\nI have also found some chaffers, and different kinds of flies, \r\nwhich I should also be glad to keep.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—And I should keep my money to buy some of the nice \r\ncakes mamma used to give us. If we stay here long, I dare say \r\nthere will be a fair; and then I will buy as many as will last \r\nus all a very long time, for I like sweet cakes better than the \r\nhard biscuits mamma gives us now.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You will wait for a fair long enough to tire the patience \r\nof a little boy like you, Francis; but if you are so fond of \r\nsweet cakes, I should advise you to make them yourself, with \r\nsome of the honey you get so cleverly.—The poor child blushed \r\nlike scarlet; he, a few days before, had discovered a swarm of \r\nbees and some fine honey-combs in a tree, and had attempted to \r\nbeat down a little of them with a stick:—the whole swarm rushed \r\nout enraged, and lighted on him, so that his face and hands were \r\nseverely stung: he thus paid dear for his discovery, which might, \r\nhowever, at some time or other, prove a useful acquisition to \r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn this trifling kind of prate we beguiled the time, till we \r\nreached the foot of our castle. Our first concern, now, was the \r\ntortoise, which we immediately turned on his back, that we might \r\nstrip off the shell, and make use of some of the flesh while \r\nit was fresh. My wife expressed her fear that we should fail \r\nin our attempt; but taking my hatchet, I separated the upper \r\nand under shell all round, which were joined together by cartilages. \r\nThe upper shell of the tortoise is extremely convex; the under, \r\non the contrary, is nearly flat. Having succeeded in dividing \r\nthem, I cut away as much of the flesh of the animal as was sufficient \r\nfor a meal, and then laid the remaining mass carefully and neatly \r\non the under shell, which served as a dish, recommending to my \r\nwife to cook what I had cut off, on the other shell, with no \r\nother seasoning than a little salt, and pledged myself that she \r\nwould by this means produce a most luxurious food.\r\n\r\nMy wife asked leave, however, to take away the _green_-coloured \r\npart of the flesh, which she said she could not even look at \r\nwithout distaste.—I answered that she was wrong in this; that \r\nit was not unusual, for a thing that displeased the eye, to be \r\nagreeable to the taste: I informed her that the green was the \r\nfat of the animal, and would add to the fine flavour and general \r\nmoisture of the dish: but, added I, if you think it is too abundant, \r\nyou can take a part and preserve it, by melting, for future use. We \r\nwill then, said I, put what we mean to keep in salt, and distribute \r\nthe head, the entrails, and the feet to the dogs; for all, you \r\nknow, must live.\r\n\r\nOh dear papa, cried Francis, do give me the shell, it will be \r\nsuch a pretty plaything!\r\n\r\nNo, no, bawled out another: and one and all contended for the \r\npreference. I imposed silence, declaring that the right was entirely \r\nin Fritz, since it was he who had harpooned the animal, who, \r\nbut for his dexterity and skill, would be at this moment existing \r\nin the sea.—But, continued I, it may be well to ask what each \r\nof you thought of doing with the shell, if he had obtained it?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I should turn it into a shield to defend myself with, \r\nif the savages should come upon us.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Ah, there is my egotist again; this is as I expected; \r\nbut let us see in what way you would use it? You would fling \r\nit across your shoulders no doubt, and take to your heels manfully.—I \r\nfancy I have guessed right, my poor Ernest, have I not?—And you, \r\nJack, what have you to say?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I should make a nice little boat of it, which would help \r\nto amuse us all. I was thinking how cleverly we could fill it \r\nwith potatoes, or the other things we want to take from Tent-House \r\nto Falcon’s Nest; it would glide along so nicely with the stream, \r\nand we should be saved all the fatigue we now have in carrying \r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Your scheme, I grant, is not ill-imagined; but a small \r\nraft or an old chest would do just as well for your purpose.—And \r\nnow for my little Francis; I wonder what pretty plan he had thought \r\nof?\r\n\r\n_Francis._—I thought I should build a little house, papa, and \r\nthe shell would make such a nice roof to it!\r\n\r\n_Father._—Vastly well, my lads, if we had only our amusement \r\nor our ease to think of; but I want you all to form the habit \r\nof thinking and acting for the general good, rather than of what \r\nwill most gratify or accommodate his single self.—Now, then, \r\nlet me ask to what use Fritz, the only rightful claimant to the \r\nshell, had intended to apply it?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I thought, father, of cleaning it thoroughly, and fixing \r\nit by the side of our river, and keeping it always full of pure \r\nwater for my mother’s use, when she has to wash the linen or \r\ncook our victuals.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Excellent, excellent, my boy! all honour to the founder \r\nof the _pure water-tub!_ This is what I call _thinking for the \r\ngeneral good._ And we will take care to execute the idea as soon \r\nas we can prepare some clay, as a solid foundation for its bottom.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Hah, hah! Now then it is my turn; for I have got some \r\nclay, which I have put by to keep for use, behind those old roots \r\nyonder.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And where did you get it, boy?\r\n\r\n_Mother._—Oh, you may apply to me for this part of the information; \r\nto my cost I know where the clay was got.—This morning early, \r\nmy young hero falls to digging and scrambling on the hill you \r\nsee to the right, and home he comes with the news that he has \r\nfound a bed of clay; but in so dirty a condition himself, that \r\nwe were obliged to think next of the washing-tub.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—And if I had minded a little dirt, mother, I should not \r\nhave discovered this bed of clay, which you will see will be \r\nof great use to us. As I was returning from looking for potatoes, \r\nI thought I would take the high path along the river, just to \r\nsee how rapidly it runs and forms those nice cascades: by and \r\nby I came to a large slope, watered by the river; it was so slippery \r\nthat I could not keep upon my legs: so I fell, and dirtied myself \r\nall over: on looking, I saw that the ground was all of clay, \r\nand almost liquid, so I made some of it into balls, and brought \r\nthem home.\r\n\r\n_Mother._—And boasted of your discovery as if you had made it \r\nin consequence of the most earnest desire to be of use, while \r\nthe benefit was the result of chance alone. But I will not put \r\nyou further to the blush, my boy; you at last confess the truth, \r\nand for this deserve our praise.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—When the water-tub is complete, I will put the roots \r\nI have found to soak a little in it, for they are now extremely \r\ndry. I do not exactly know what they are; they look something \r\nlike the radish or horseradish, but the plant from which I took \r\nthem was almost the size of a bush: being ignorant, however, \r\nof its name or nature, I have not yet ventured to taste the roots, \r\nthough I saw our sow eat heartily of them.\r\n\r\n_Father._—It was quite right to be cautious my son: but let me \r\nlook at these roots. I am always glad to hear that you observe \r\nand reflect upon all the objects which fall in your way. How \r\ndid you first discover them?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I was rambling about, father, and met with the sow, \r\nwho with her snout was turning up the earth under the plant I \r\nhave been speaking of, and stopped only to chew and swallow greedily \r\nsomething she seemed to find there. I drove her away; and on \r\nlooking into the place, I found a knot of roots, which I tore \r\nout and brought home.\r\n\r\n_Father._—If my suspicion is right, you have made a beneficial \r\ndiscovery, which with the assistance of our potatoes may furnish \r\nus the means of existence as long as we may remain in this island! \r\nI am tolerably certain that these roots are _manioc_, of which \r\nthe natives of the West Indies make a sort of bread or cake which \r\nthey call _cassave_. But if we would make this use of it, we \r\nmust first carry it through a certain preparation, without which \r\nthese roots possess pernicious properties. If you are sure of \r\nfinding the same place, or we can collect enough in any other, we \r\nwill secure a sufficiently large quantity for our first experiment, \r\nwhich I have great confidence will succeed.\r\n\r\nBy the time of ending this discourse, we had also finished unloading \r\nthe sledge, and I bade the three eldest boys accompany me to \r\nfetch another load before it should be dark. We left Francis \r\nand his mother busy in preparing what we indeed stood much in \r\nneed of after a day of such fatigue, a refreshing meal for supper, \r\nthe tortoise having presented itself most opportunely for this \r\neffect. I promise you, cried my wife, as we were moving off, \r\nyou shall not at your return find reason to complain.\r\n\r\nAs we walked along, Fritz asked me if this handsome shell was \r\nof the kind so much valued in Europe for making into boxes, combs, \r\n&c.? and if it was not a pity to use it for a water-tub?\r\n\r\nI replied, that in our deserted situation the utility of a thing \r\nformed its greatest, and indeed only value. According to this way \r\nof reasoning then, were your water-tub of diamonds, it would be of no \r\nmore worth to us than the rudest stone, if in such a form as to be \r\nable to contain water. However, dear boy, I shall inform you, for \r\nyour consolation, that our tortoise, which makes such excellent food, \r\nis not of the species, the shells of which are so much esteemed for \r\nthe uses you have mentioned. This latter kind, which is called \r\n_caret_, does not furnish a wholesome food, its flesh being no less \r\nremarkable for its bad and unpalatable properties, than those \r\nof our tortoise for savouriness and nourishment. The shell of \r\nthe caret tortoise is prepared for use by the action of \r\nheat, which separates the layer that from its colour and transparency \r\nis so attractive, from the inferior and useless parts. It is \r\nusual to preserve even the clippings of the real tortoise shell \r\nand unite them by heat for making articles of small price; but \r\nthese are much more liable to break than the former, and of course \r\npossess very little of their beauty.\r\n\r\nWe now reached the raft, and took from it as many effects as \r\nthe sledge could hold, or the animals draw along. The first object \r\nof my attention was to secure two chests which contained the \r\nclothes of my family, which I well knew would afford the highest \r\ngratification to my exemplary wife, who had frequently lamented \r\nthat they were all compelled to wear clothes that were not their \r\nown; reminding her at every moment, she said, how much they might \r\nbe wanted by their proper claimants. I reckoned also on finding \r\nin one of the chests some books on interesting subjects, and \r\nprincipally a large handsomely printed Bible. I added to these, \r\nfour cart-wheels and a hand-mill for grinding; which, now that \r\nwe had discovered the manioc, I considered of signal importance. \r\nThese and a few other articles completed our present load.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Falcon’s Nest, we found my wife looking anxiously \r\nfor our arrival, and ready with the welcome she had promised, \r\nof an ample and agreeable repast; nor was her kind humour diminished \r\nby the view of the acquisitions we now added to her store of \r\nnecessaries. Before she had well examined them, she drew me, \r\nwith one of her sweetest smiles, by the arm,—Step this way, said \r\nshe, and I too will produce something that will both refresh \r\nand please you. And leading to the shade of a tree,—This, continued \r\nshe, is the work I performed in your absence, pointing to a cask \r\nof tolerable size, half-sunk into the ground, and the rest covered \r\nover with branches of trees. She then applied a small cork-screw \r\nto the side, and filling the shell of a cocoa-nut with the contents, \r\npresented it to me. I found the liquor equal to the best canary \r\nI had ever tasted.—How then, said I, have you performed this \r\nnew miracle? I cannot believe the enchanted bag produced it.—Not \r\nexactly, replied she; for this time it was an obliging white \r\nwave which threw on shore the agreeable liquid with which I have \r\nnow the pleasure to regale you. I took a little ramble in your \r\nabsence yesterday, to see what I could find, and behold how well \r\nmy trouble was rewarded! The boys ran for the sledge, and had \r\nbut little difficulty in getting it to Falcon’s Stream, where \r\nour next care was to dig a place in the earth, to receive and \r\nkeep it cool. We guessed it must contain some sort of wine; but \r\nto be quite sure, Ernest and Jack bored a small hole in the side, \r\nand inserting a hollow reed, they contrived to taste it, and \r\nassured me the cask was filled with a most delicious beverage. \r\nI now thought it was high time to forbid their proceeding any \r\nfurther with the _tasting_, fearing for the effect on their poor \r\nheads; and I closed up the hole with a small piece of wood. I \r\nhave nothing more to relate, but that the boys kept the secret, \r\nas I desired them.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I agreed that we would now recompense them, by giving \r\neach a small glass of the precious liquor; but the young creatures \r\ntook such a fancy to it, that they obtained again and again a \r\nlittle more, till at last we perceived their spirits so much \r\nraised, that we were obliged to refuse their further entreaties \r\nwith gravity and firmness; observing to them, that man is required \r\nto restrain his appetite, and not to abuse, by excesses, the \r\ngood things a bountiful Providence allows us for the purpose \r\nof rejoicing our hearts and strengthening our bodies when used \r\nwith moderation.\r\n\r\nBy means of this little lecture I succeeded in appeasing their \r\nturbulence, and in drawing them from the dangerous vicinity of \r\nthe cask. For my own part, the generous character of the wine \r\nhad so invigorated me, that I found myself able to complete my \r\nday’s work, by drawing up the mattresses we had brought from \r\nthe ship, to our chamber in the tree, by means of a pulley. When \r\nI had laid them along to advantage, they looked so inviting, \r\nthat I could scarcely resist my desire of at once committing \r\nmyself to the kind relief they seemed to offer to my exhausted \r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nBut now the tortoise, through the voice of my wife, laid claim \r\nto my attention. The savoury smell ascended to our castle; I \r\nhastened down, and we all partook heartily of the luxurious treat. \r\nWe returned thanks to God, and speedily retired to taste the \r\nblessing of sweet and sound repose upon our mattresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. \r\n\r\n_Another trip to the wreck._ \r\n\r\nI rose before day to go to the sea-side and inspect our two vessels. \r\nMy family did not hear me depart, and I was unwilling to disturb \r\ntheir balmy sleep, that sweet restorative of strength, so requisite \r\nfor children. I therefore gently descended the ladder. Above, \r\nthe scene was all repose; below, I found every thing in life \r\nand motion. The dogs jumped about me for joy, perceiving I was \r\ngoing out; the cock and the hens flapped their wings and chuckled, \r\nand our goats shook their long beards as they browsed; but the \r\nass, the only creature amongst them I was likely to want at that \r\ntime, still lay stretched at full length on the grass, and discovered \r\nno inclination for the morning jaunt I designed for him. Taking \r\nless of the creature’s feelings into the account than my own \r\noccasion for his services, I quickly roused and harnessed him \r\nsingly for the sledge, not wishing to yoke the cow to it before \r\nshe had been milked. It was unnecessary to call the dogs after \r\nme. As I walked towards the shore, animated at different moments \r\nby hope and fear, with pleasure I saw there, that, with the help \r\nof my lead and iron bars used as anchors, the boat and raft had \r\nresisted the tide, though it had partially heaved them up. I \r\ngot quickly on the raft, where I took a small loading, and returned \r\nto Falcon’s Stream in time for breakfast. Judge of my surprise \r\nwhen arrived, that I neither saw nor heard a single creature \r\nof its inhabitants, though the sun had climbed high above the \r\nhorizon.—Thinking it time for our fellow-labourers to be stirring, \r\nI gave a shout as loud as a war-whoop. My wife awoke first, and \r\nwondered to see the day so far advanced. Really, my dear, said \r\nshe, I think it must be the magic charm of the good mattress \r\nyou brought home yesterday that has lulled me into such a long \r\nsound sleep, and that appears to be still exerting its influence \r\nupon our boys. In fact, though they rubbed their eyes, they could \r\nscarcely keep them open: they yawned, stretched, turned round, \r\nand turned back again. Come come, up, my lads, exclaimed I, once \r\nagain; the more we venture to parley with sloth, the longer she \r\nholds us in her chains; brave youths like you, ought to awake \r\nat the first call, and leap quick and gaily out of bed. Fritz, \r\nashamed to have slept so long, was dressed first; Jack soon after \r\nhim, and Francis next; the ever-slothful Ernest was the last.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, dear boy, said I to him, that at your age you \r\nallow even little Francis to get the start of you?\r\n\r\nOh! father, answered he, it is so delightful to lose oneself \r\nagain after having been awakened! one feels sleep come on afresh \r\nso gently, ideas vanish so agreeably! I should be glad to be \r\nawakened thus every morning, that I might have the pleasure of \r\nfalling into a new slumber.\r\n\r\nI answer, Ernest, that this is a refinement in slothfulness I \r\nnever heard of till now! It is my duty to tell you, and that \r\ngravely, if you acquire this habit, you will become an effeminate \r\nuseless character. A man, though not like us, in a desert, is \r\nbound to provide for his existence, and avoid being a burthen \r\nto society; he should do what is right with courage and promptness, \r\nwithout consulting convenience or pleasure. He who indulges himself \r\nin all that flatters his senses, will end by falling a victim \r\nto them. Nature produces, too, certain poisons, which are grateful \r\nto the palate; yet the persons who unguardedly taste them, fail \r\nnot to suffer the death they conceal.\r\n\r\nAfter this short admonition, we all came down; and prayers and \r\nbreakfast being over, we returned to the sea-side to complete \r\nthe unloading of the raft, that it might be ready for sea on the \r\nebbing of the tide. I was not long, with the additional assistance \r\nI had, in taking two cargoes to Falcon’s Stream. At our last \r\ntrip the tide was nearly up to our craft. I immediately sent \r\nback my wife and three children, and remained with Fritz waiting \r\ntill we were quite afloat; when observing Jack hovering round \r\nus and dilatory in following his mother, I perceived his wish \r\nand assented to his embarking with us. Shortly after, the tide \r\nwas high enough for us to row off. Instead of steering for Safety \r\nBay to moor our vessels there securely, I was tempted by the \r\nfineness of the weather to go out again to the wreck, which it \r\nwas with considerable difficulty we got up to, though aided by \r\na very fresh sea breeze. On our getting along-side, it was too \r\nlate to undertake much, and I was unwilling to cause my dear \r\npartner uneasiness by passing another night on-board; I therefore \r\ndetermined to bring away only what could be obtained with ease \r\nand speed: in this resolution we searched hastily through the \r\nship for any trifling articles that might be readily removed. \r\nJack was up and down, every where, at a loss what to select; \r\nand when I saw him again, he drew a wheel-barrow after him, shouting \r\nand rejoicing at having found such a vehicle for the convenient \r\ncarriage of our potatoes. But Fritz next disclosed still better news, \r\nwhich was that he had discovered behind the bulk-head amid-ship, \r\na pinnace (_i. e._ a small craft, the forepart of which is square) \r\ntaken to pieces, with all its appurtenances, and even two small \r\nguns for its defence. This intelligence so delighted me, that \r\nI quitted every thing else to run to the bulk-head, when I was \r\nconvinced of the truth of the lad’s assertion: but I instantly \r\nperceived, that to put it together and launch it into the sea, \r\nwould be an Herculean task, which I relinquished for the present. \r\nI then collected some house utensils and whatever else I thought \r\nmost useful; such as a large copper boiler, some plates of iron, \r\ntobacco graters, two grinding-stones, a small barrel of gun-powder, \r\nand another full of flints, which I much valued. Jack’s barrow \r\nwas not forgotten; two more were afterwards found and added, \r\nwith straps belonging to them. All these articles were hurried \r\ninto the boat, without our stopping to eat, or in any manner \r\nrefresh ourselves, and we re-embarked with speed, to avoid meeting \r\nthe land wind that invariably rises in the evening. As we were \r\nsafely and happily drawing near to shore, we were struck with \r\nthe appearance of an assemblage of small figures ranged in a long \r\nline on the strand, and that seemed to be viewing us attentively: \r\nthey were dressed in black, and all uniform, with white waistcoats \r\nand full cravats: the arms of these beings hung down carelessly; \r\nnow and then, however, they seemed to extend them tenderly, as \r\nif they wished to embrace or offer us a token of friendship.\r\n\r\nI really think, said I to the boys, who were steadfastly gazing \r\nat so novel a spectacle, that we are in the country of the pygmies, \r\nand that, having discovered us, they wish to form a friendly \r\nalliance.\r\n\r\n_Jack._ Oh, no! father, they are certainly Lilliputians, though \r\nsomewhat bigger than those of whom I read the description in \r\nGulliver’s Travels.\r\n\r\nYou, then, child, said I, consider those travels as true; that \r\nthere is an island of Lilliput, and inhabited by dwarfs?\r\n\r\n_Jack._ Gulliver says so. He met also with men of an immense \r\nstature, besides an island inhabited by horses . . . . .\r\n\r\nAnd yet I must tell you that the only reality in all his discoveries \r\nis the rich imagination of the author, whose taste and feeling \r\nled him to resort to allegory for the purpose of revealing grand \r\ntruths. Do you know, Jack, what an allegory is?\r\n\r\nIt somewhat resembles a parable, I presume.\r\n\r\nRight, one is very similar to the other.\r\n\r\n_Jack._ And the pygmies you mentioned, are any to be found?\r\n\r\nNo more than there are Lilliputians; they exist only in poetical \r\nfiction, or in the erroneous account of some ancient navigator, \r\nin which a group of monkeys has been fallaciously described as \r\ndiminutive men.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._ Such probably are the mannikins that we see now stretching \r\nout their arms towards us. Ah, now I begin to perceive that they \r\nhave beaks, and that their arms are short drooping wings;—what \r\nstrange birds!\r\n\r\nYou are right, son, they are penguins or ruffs[1]. They are of \r\nthe _stupid_ species; Ernest killed one soon after our arrival. \r\nThey are excellent swimmers, but cannot fly; and so confused \r\nare they when on land, that they run in the silliest way into \r\ndanger; catching such birds as these, is a fit sport for none \r\nbut the indolent.\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking I steered gently towards shore, to enjoy \r\nthe uncommon sight the longer; but the very moment we got into \r\nshallow water, my giddy boy Jack leaped out of his cask up to \r\nhis waist into it, and was quickly on land battering with his \r\nstick among the penguins before they were aware of his approach, \r\nso that half a dozen of them were immediately laid flat; they \r\nwere not dead, but only stunned: the remainder, seeing they were \r\nso roughly accosted, plunged into the sea, dived, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nFritz murmured audibly at his brother for having frightened them \r\naway before he could fire. I could not help laughing at this \r\nperpetual shooter of guns, who was so disposed to waste his powder \r\non animals which were to be taken with the hand without resistance: \r\nI also taunted Jack a little for having jumped into the water \r\nat the risk of being drowned. While I was making these observations, \r\nthe birds, that had been merely stunned, gradually recovered, \r\nrose upon their legs and began a tottering sort of march with \r\na gravity which irresistibly excited our laughter. I did not \r\nallow Jack’s game to escape; I took hold of them, tied their \r\nlegs together with reeds, without hurting them, and laid them \r\non the beach while we were landing our treasures. But as the \r\nsun declined, and we despaired of finishing before night set \r\nin, each of us filled a barrow in order to take home something. \r\nI requested that the tobacco-graters and iron plates might be \r\nin the first load; to these we added the penguins living and \r\ndead, and then set out. As we drew near Falcon’s Stream I heard with \r\npleasure the watchful dogs proclaim our approach with loud barking: \r\nthey no sooner saw us than they ran up with lively demonstrations \r\nof joy, and in the midst of their rough greetings completely \r\noverset poor Jack, who was wheeling along his barrow with difficulty \r\nand some ill-humour, and to this he gave vent by two or three \r\nlusty cuffs of his fist, which were divided between his friends \r\nTurk and Ponto, who so little thought of resenting them, that \r\nthey sprang upon him as often as he took his barrow, and thus \r\nrenewed the contest to the no small amusement of his brothers, \r\nwho ran up to disengage him. My wife was highly pleased with \r\nthe wheel-barrows and for the most part with their contents, but \r\nshe had no partiality for the tobacco-graters.—In the name of \r\nHeaven, said she, what is the use of these graters? Are our four \r\nsons to become snuff-takers? Luckily for my fears, said she, \r\nthe article is not to be obtained in our island.\r\n\r\nNo, dear wife, I replied; and pray do not be uneasy about them; \r\nthese graters are not for the gratification of our noses; I am \r\ntoo happy in having myself abandoned the bad and filthy habit \r\nof snuff-taking, to permit my sons to use it. Come, children, \r\nsaid I, pointing to the penguins, look after the new-comers to \r\nthe poultry-yard. I then directed them to fasten the birds one \r\nby one to a goose or a duck, as a means of taming and inuring \r\nthem to the society of their companions. This essay, however, \r\nwas tedious and inconvenient to our feathered animals, who were \r\nbut slowly reconciled to their singular companions. My wife now \r\nshowed me a good store of potatoes which she had got in during \r\nour absence, and a quantity of the roots I had taken for manioc, \r\nand in which I was not mistaken: I much applauded her diligence \r\nand foresight, and gave Ernest and little Francis their share \r\nof approbation.\r\n\r\nPapa, we have worked very hard indeed, said the latter; what \r\nwill you say when we have a fine crop of maize, melons, dates, \r\nand gourds? Mamma has planted all these in the potatoe holes.\r\n\r\nI must tell you, master Francis, exclaimed his mother, you are \r\na little thoughtless babbler. Why did you tell my secret? you \r\nhave spoiled all the pleasure I promised myself in surprising \r\nyour father with my new plantation.\r\n\r\n_Father._ I am sorry for this, my dear; but be assured I am not \r\nthe less gratified for hearing of your kindness in this unexpected \r\nmanner. But tell me, I beseech you, where did you procure all \r\nthese seeds and grains, and how came you to think of so extraordinary \r\na plan?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ I took the grain and seeds from the bottom of my enchanted \r\nbag, and your thirst after fresh booty and your endless trips \r\nto the wreck are the sources of the resolution I formed to increase \r\nthe number of your comforts at home, and thus render them the \r\nless necessary. I determined then during the fine season to fit \r\nup a kitchen-garden, and to sow as much of it with seed as I \r\nwas able to dig and put in order; at the same time taking particular \r\ncare to leave all the smallest-sized potatoes in the ground, \r\nthat they might produce us a full and abundant crop.\r\n\r\n_Father._ This was well thought, my love; but we must not despise \r\nthe trips to the vessel neither; this very day we unexpectedly \r\ndiscovered in her a new and handsome little pinnace, which at \r\nsome time or other may be of the greatest service to us.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ I cannot say that this discovery gives me very much \r\npleasure; I have no desire to trust myself again on the sea; \r\nbut should it at any time be absolutely necessary, I must confess \r\nI should prefer a well made solid vessel to our miserable raft \r\ncomposed of tubs.\r\n\r\n_Father._ Well, this you shall possess, if you will consent to \r\nmy returning once more to the wreck; in the mean while, let us \r\nhave some supper, and then we will retire to rest; and if my \r\nlittle workmen should be industriously inclined to-morrow, I \r\nshall reward them with what to children is always a source of \r\npleasure—the novelty of a new trade to be learnt. This did not \r\nfail to excite the curiosity of all; but I kept my word, and \r\nmade them wait till the following day for the explanation I had \r\nto give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. \r\n\r\n_The bake-house._ \r\n\r\nI waked the boys very early, reminding them that I had promised \r\nto teach them a new trade. What is it? What is it? exclaimed \r\nthey all at once, springing suddenly out of bed and hurrying \r\non their clothes.\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is the art of baking, my boys, which at present \r\nI am no more acquainted with than yourselves; but we will learn \r\nit together, and I am much mistaken if we shall not be able to \r\nproduce an excellent batch of bread, which will be the greater \r\nluxury, from our having been altogether deprived of it during \r\nour residence in this island. Hand me those iron plates that \r\nwe brought yesterday from the vessel, and the tobacco-graters \r\nalso.\r\n\r\n_Mother._—I really cannot understand what tobacco-graters and \r\niron plates can have to do with making bread; a good oven would \r\nafford me much better hopes, and this, unfortunately, we do not \r\npossess.\r\n\r\n_Father._—These very iron plates, the same you looked so disdainfully \r\nupon no longer since than yesterday, will serve the purpose of the \r\nthings you are now wishing to have.—I cannot, it is true, promise, \r\nin this early attempt, to produce you light and handsome-looking \r\nbread; but I can answer that you shall have some excellent-tasted \r\ncakes, though they should be a little flat and heavy;—we will \r\nimmediately make our experiment. Ernest, bring hither the roots \r\nfound underground: but first, my dear, I must request you to \r\nmake me a small bag of a piece of the strongest wrapper linen.\r\n\r\nMy wife set instantly to work to oblige me; but having no great \r\nconfidence in my talents for making cakes, she first filled with \r\npotatoes the large copper boiler we had brought from the ship, \r\nand put it on the fire, that we might not find ourselves without \r\nsomething to eat at the time of dinner: in the meanwhile I spread \r\na large piece of coarse linen on the ground, and assembled my \r\nyoung ones round me to begin our undertaking; I gave each of \r\nthe boys a grater, and showed him at the same time how to rest \r\nit on the linen, and then to grate the roots of manioc; so that \r\nin a short time each had produced a considerable heap of a substance \r\nsomewhat resembling pollard. The occupation, as is always the \r\ncase with novelties, proved infinitely amusing to them all, and \r\nthey looked no further into the matter; one showed the other \r\nhis heap, saying in a bantering tone: Will you eat a bit of nice \r\ncake made of grated radishes?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Make as merry as you please, young gentlemen, on the \r\nsubject of this excellent production of nature, which ere long \r\nyou will acknowledge to have yielded you a most palatable kind \r\nof food; a food which is known to be the principal sustenance \r\nof whole nations of the continent of America, and which the Europeans \r\nwho inhabit those countries even prefer to our wheaten bread. \r\nI must tell you, there are many kinds of manioc; one of these \r\nshoots rapidly, and its roots become mature in a short time; \r\na second sort is of more tardy growth; and there is another, \r\nthe roots of which require the space of two years to be fit for \r\nuse. The first two kinds have pernicious or unwholesome qualities \r\nwhen eaten raw, but the third may be eaten without fear: for \r\nall this, the two first are generally preferred, as being more \r\nproductive, and requiring a shorter time for being fit for use.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—One would think only madmen could prefer those that are \r\npernicious: we cannot to be sure but be overwhelmed with gratitude \r\nfor some cake that is to kill us (and the young rogue threw his \r\ngrater from him as he spoke)! who shall tell us that our fine \r\nroots here are not of the same pernicious kind?\r\n\r\n_Father._—At all events we shall not eat them raw; as nearly \r\nas I recollect, the tardy kind, like these we have procured, \r\ngrow in the form of a bush; while the other two are creeping \r\nplants. However, to be quite sure, the first thing we will do, \r\nshall be to press the pollard.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—For what end, father, shall we press it?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Because, even in the pernicious kind it is only the \r\nsap which is hurtful; the more substantial part being when dried \r\nextremely wholesome and even nourishing. But that we may act \r\nwith the greatest possible prudence, we will give some of our \r\ncakes to the fowls and to the monkey, before we venture to eat \r\nof them ourselves; if they do them no harm, we may then proceed \r\nto feast on them with safety.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Thank you, father; but I have no fancy to let my monkey \r\nbe poisoned.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You may be perfectly easy, Jack, for the preservative \r\ninstinct of your monkey is such, that he would not touch it if \r\nit were poisonous; animals are in this respect better treated \r\nthan man, who is called upon to use his reason in supplying the \r\ndeficiency: at all events, however, we will give him so little \r\nthat no harm can possibly ensue.\r\n\r\nUpon this Jack picked up his grater, and with the others began \r\nto grate the roots with new alertness: dread of the poison had \r\nfor an instant palsied every arm; but a very short time was now \r\nsufficient for producing a considerable quantity of ground manioc. \r\nBy this time my wife had completed the bag. I had it well filled \r\nwith what we called our pollard, and she closed it effectually \r\nby sewing up the end. I was now to contrive a kind of press: \r\nI cut a long, straight, well-formed branch, of considerable strength, \r\nfrom a neighbouring tree, and stripped it of the bark; I then \r\nplaced a plank across the table we had fixed between the arched \r\nroots of our tree, and which was exactly the right height for \r\nmy purpose, and on this I laid the bag; I put other planks again \r\nupon the bag, and then covered all with the large branch, the \r\nthickest extremity of which I inserted under an arch, while to \r\nthe other, which projected beyond the planks, I suspended all \r\nsorts of heavy substances, such as lead, our largest hammers \r\nand bars of iron, which, acting with great force as a press on \r\nthe bag of manioc, caused the sap it contained to issue in streams, \r\nwhich flowed plentifully on the ground.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—This machine of yours, father, though simple, is as \r\neffectual as can be desired.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Certainly. It is the simplest lever that the art of \r\nmechanism can furnish, and may be made extremely useful.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I thought that levers were never used but for raising \r\nheavy masses, such as blocks of stone, and things of that degree \r\nof weight; I had no notion that they were ever used for pressing.\r\n\r\n_Father._—But, my dear boy, you see that the point at which the \r\nlever rests on the planks, must always be the point of rest or \r\ncompression; the point at which its extremity touches the roots \r\nof the tree would no doubt be that of the raising power, if the \r\nroot was not too strong to yield to the point of the lever; but \r\nthen the resistance at the point of compression or rest is still \r\nstronger, and presses effectually, as you see, the contents of \r\nthe bag. The Negroes, however, have another manner of proceeding; \r\nbut it would have been much too tedious in the process for us \r\nto imitate. They make tresses of the bark of a tree, and with \r\nit form a kind of basket of tolerable size; they fill it with \r\nmanioc, and press it so tightly that the baskets become shorter, \r\nand increase in breadth; they then hang the baskets to the strongest \r\nbranches of trees, and fasten large stones to them, which draw \r\nthe baskets again lengthways; by which action upon the manioc, \r\nthe sap runs out at the openings left by the tresses.\r\n\r\n_Mother._—Can one make no use of this sap?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Certainly, we may: the same Negroes use it as food, \r\nafter mixing with it a considerable quantity of pepper; and, \r\nwhen they can procure them, some sea crabs. The Europeans, on \r\nthe other hand, leave it to settle in vessels till it has formed \r\na sediment; they then pour off the liquid part, wash the sediment \r\nwith fresh water, and place it to dry in the sun: in this manner \r\nthey obtain from it an excellent sort of starch, which is used \r\nfor clearing linen. I must tell you that the potatoe also contains \r\nthe same sort of substance, which may be put to the same use: \r\nfor the rest, the latter is less nourishing than the manioc.\r\n\r\n_Mother._—But pray tell me, are we to prepare the whole of this \r\nmanioc at once? If so, we have at least a whole day’s work, and \r\na great part must be spoiled at last.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Not so, my dear; when the pollard is perfectly dry, \r\nit may be placed in casks, and being shut closely down, it will \r\nkeep for years; but you will see that the whole of this large \r\nheap will be so reduced in quantity by the operation we are going \r\nto apply of baking, that there will be no cause for your apprehension.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Father, it no longer runs a single drop; may we not \r\nnow set about making the dough?\r\n\r\n_Father._—I have no objection; but it would be more prudent to \r\nmake only a small cake, at first, by way of experiment, which \r\nas I said before we will give to the monkey and the fowls, and \r\nwait to see the effect, instead of exhausting our whole store \r\nat once.\r\n\r\nWe now opened the bag, and took out a small quantity of the pollard, \r\nwhich already was sufficiently dry; we stirred the rest about \r\nwith a stick, and then replaced it under the press. The next \r\nthing was to fix one of our iron plates, which was of a round \r\nform, and rather convex, so as to rest upon two blocks of stone \r\nat a distance from each other; under this we lighted a large \r\nfire, and when the iron plate was completely heated, we placed \r\na portion of the dough upon it with a wooden spade. As soon as \r\nthe cake began to be brown underneath, it was turned, that the \r\nother side might be baked also.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—O how nicely it smells! what a pity that we may not \r\neat some of it immediately!\r\n\r\n_Jack._—And why not? I would eat some without the least fear; \r\nand would not you, Francis?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Hah, hah! What is then become of our terrible fear \r\nof being poisoned, which made you even throw your grater from \r\nyou? Ah, I see how it is; the passion of gluttony is stronger \r\nthan your fear.—However, I certainly believe that in this case \r\nit might be gratified without doing you an injury; nevertheless \r\nit is better perhaps to wait till the evening, and not run a \r\ngreater risk than the loss of one or two of our fowls and of \r\nthe monkey; and we may say this trial of the cake will be the \r\nfirst service he has rendered us.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cake was cold, we broke some of it into crumbs, \r\nand gave it to two of the fowls, and a larger piece to the monkey, \r\nwho nibbled it with a perfect relish, making all the time a thousand \r\ngrimaces to testify his content, while the boys stood by envying \r\nthe preference he enjoyed.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Now tell me, father, how the savages manage to grate \r\ntheir manioc, for surely they have not, like us, an instrument \r\nfitted for the operation:—and tell me also, if they call their \r\ncomposition by the name of cake or bread, as we do?\r\n\r\n_Father._—The savages having no such article as bread in their \r\nbill of fare, have consequently no word in their language to \r\nexpress it. At the Antilles, the bread from the manioc is called \r\n_cassave_; the savages make a kind of grater with sharp stones, \r\nor shells; or when they can get nails, on which they set a high \r\nvalue, they drive them into the end of a plank, and rub the manioc \r\nupon it. But now, I pray you, good wife, give us quickly some \r\ndinner, and we will afterwards resume the baking trade, provided \r\nour tasters show no signs of the colic or swimming in the head.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Are these, then, the only effects of poison, father?\r\n\r\n_Father._—At least they are the most ordinary ones: there are \r\npoisons which paralyse and induce a heavy sleep; such are opium, \r\nif taken in too large a quantity; hemlock, &c. &c. Others are \r\nsharp and corrosive, attacking the stomach and intestines: of \r\nthis class are arsenic, sublimate, and the pernicious sorts of \r\nmushrooms. If, when either of these has been swallowed, there \r\nbe not immediate assistance procured, the human machine stops, \r\nbecomes disorganized, and the patient dies.—I will take this \r\noccasion, my dear children, to caution you against a kind of \r\nfruit extremely dangerous in its nature, and the more so from \r\nthe remarkable attraction of its external appearance. This fruit \r\nis frequently found in America on the banks of rivers or in marshes, \r\nand you may perhaps meet with it in this island. Its aspect is \r\nagreeable to the eye, resembling a handsome kind of yellow apple \r\nwith red spots. It is, however, one of the strongest poisons \r\nin the world: it is even said to be dangerous to sleep under \r\nthe shade of the tree which produces it. Be very careful, therefore, \r\nshould you happen to meet with it: it is known by the name of \r\n_mancenilla_. Indeed I cannot too seriously exhort you not to \r\nventure on eating any thing you may find, however alluring in \r\nappearance, till you have first consulted me. Promise me this, \r\nchildren, one and all of you.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I promise you heartily, father; and still further, I \r\nwill keep my word more faithfully than Adam did towards God, \r\nwho had forbidden him to eat of a certain apple.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You will do well in this; but do not so presumptuously and \r\nso readily blame that in another which under the same circumstances \r\nyou would have done yourself; I would lay a wager that you would \r\nbe the first to be led away by any worthless knave who should \r\ncome and tell you that I had been laughing at you all the while, \r\nthat the mancenilla is the finest apple in the world, and that \r\nby eating it you would be rendered as strong as a lion; that \r\nready appetite of yours, and that little vanity we now and then \r\ndiscover in you, would make you, I fear, forget my advice, and \r\ngreedily devour the apple.—But this is enough on the subject; \r\ninstead of thinking more of poisons, let us resort with confidence \r\nto our plentiful dish of boiled potatoes; perhaps, dear wife, \r\nyou have some little relish to add to them to day:—what, I pray \r\nyou, may there be in that boiling vessel yonder?\r\n\r\n_Mother._—It is the penguin that Jack killed and brought home.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, we did not take a fancy to the dish, the bird \r\nbeing of a strong and fishy flavour. Jack, however, was of a \r\ndifferent opinion, and he was left at full liberty to regale \r\nhimself to his appetite’s content.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we did after dinner was to visit our fowls. Those \r\namong them which had eaten the manioc, were in excellent condition, \r\nand no less so the monkey, who gave us sufficient proofs of life \r\nand health in the multitude of gambols and grimaces he exhibited. \r\nNow then to the bakehouse, young ones, said I—to the bakehouse \r\nas fast as you can scamper. The grated manioc was soon emptied out \r\nof the bag, a large fire was quickly lighted, and when sufficiently \r\nfervent, I placed the boys where a flat surface had been prepared \r\nfor them, and gave to each a plate of iron and the quantity of \r\na cocoa nut full for them to make a cake apiece, and they were \r\nto try who could succeed the best. They were ranged in a half \r\ncircle round the place, where I stood myself, that they might \r\nthe better be enabled to observe how I proceeded, and adopt the \r\nsame method for themselves. The result was not discouraging for \r\na first experiment, though it must be confessed we were now and \r\nthen so unlucky as to burn a cake; but there was not a greater \r\nnumber of these than served to feed the pigeons and the fowls, \r\nwhich hovered round us to claim their share of the treat. My \r\nlittle rogues could not resist the pleasure of frequently tasting \r\ntheir cake, a little bit at a time, as they went on. At length \r\nthe undertaking was complete; the cakes were put in a dish and \r\nserved in company with a handsome share of milk, to each person; \r\nand with this addition, they furnished us an excellent repast: \r\nwhat remained we distributed among our animals and fowls. I observed \r\nwith pleasure that the penguins which I had preserved alive, \r\naccommodated themselves perfectly to this kind of food, and that \r\ngenerally, they began to lose their former timid behaviour; I \r\ntherefore indulged my inclination to compassionate their captive \r\nstate, and ventured to disengage them from their comrades: this \r\nindulgence procured me the pleasure of seeing them seemingly \r\nin a state of newly acquired content.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was employed by the boys in making several turns \r\nwith their wheel-barrows, and by myself in different arrangements \r\nin which the ass and our raft had a principal share, both being \r\nemployed in drawing to Tent-House the remaining articles we had \r\nbrought from the ship. When all this was done we retired to rest, \r\nhaving first made another meal on our cakes, and concluded all \r\nwith pious thanks to God for the blessings his goodness thought \r\nfit to bestow upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. \r\n\r\n_The pinnace and the cracker._ \r\n\r\nFrom the time of discovering the pinnace, my desire of returning \r\nto the vessel grew every moment more and more irresistible: but \r\none thing I saw was absolutely necessary, which was to collect \r\nall my hands and go provided with sufficient strength to enable \r\nme to get her out from the situation where we had found her the \r\nday before. I therefore thought of taking with me the three boys: \r\nI even wished that my wife should accompany us; but she had been \r\nseized with such an horror of the perfidious element as she called \r\nit, the sea, that she assured me the very attempt would make \r\nher ill, and thus occasion her to be an additional trouble rather \r\nthan of use. I had some difficulty to prevail upon her to let \r\nso many as three of the children go: she made me promise to return \r\nthe same evening, and on no account to pass another night on-board \r\nthe wreck: and to this I was, though with regret, obliged to \r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast then, we prepared for setting out, but not without \r\nsome sighing and mournful looks from my amiable partner. The \r\nboys, on the contrary, were gay and on the alert, in the expectation \r\nof the pleasure that awaited them; particularly Ernest, who had \r\nnot yet made a single voyage with us to the vessel. We took with \r\nus an ample provision of boiled potatoes and cassave; and in \r\naddition, arms and weapons of every kind. We embarked and reached \r\nSafety Bay without the occurrence of any remarkable event: here \r\nwe thought it prudent to put on our cork jackets; we then scattered \r\nsome food for the geese and ducks which had taken up their abode \r\nthere, and soon after stepped gaily into our tub-raft, at the \r\nsame time fastening the new boat by a rope to her stern, so that \r\nshe could be drawn along. We put out for the current, though \r\nnot without considerable fear of finding that the wreck had entirely \r\ndisappeared. We soon, however, perceived that she still remained \r\nfirm between the rocks. Having got on-board, our first care was \r\nto load our craft with different stores, that we might not return \r\nwithout some acquisition of comfort for our establishment; and \r\nthen all on the wings of curiosity and ardour we repaired to \r\nthat part of the vessel called the bulk-head, which contained \r\nthe enviable prize, the pinnace. On further observation, it appeared \r\nto me that the plan we had formed was subject to at least two \r\nalarming and perhaps insurmountable difficulties: the one was \r\nthe situation of the pinnace in the ship; and the other was the \r\nsize and weight it would necessarily acquire when put together. \r\nThe inclosure in which she lay in pieces was far back in the \r\ninterior of the ship, and close upon the side which was in the \r\nwater, immediately under the officers’ cabin. Several inner timbers \r\nof prodigious bulk and weight separated this inclosure from the \r\nbreach at which only we had been able to get on-board, and in \r\nthis part of the deck there was not sufficient space for us to \r\nwork at putting the pinnace together, or to give her room should \r\nwe succeed in completing our business. The breach also was too \r\nnarrow and too irregular to admit of her being launched from \r\nthis place, as we had done with our tub-raft. In short, the separate \r\npieces of the pinnace were too heavy for the possibility of our \r\nremoving them even with the assistance of our united strength. \r\nWhat therefore was to be done? and how could we meet so formidable \r\na difficulty? I stood on the spot absorbed in deep reflection, \r\nwhile the boys were running from place to place, conveying every \r\nthing portable they could find, on-board the raft.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet which contained the pinnace was lighted by several \r\nsmall fissures in the timbers, which after standing in the place \r\na few minutes to accustom the eye, enabled one to see sufficiently \r\nto distinguish objects.\r\n\r\nI discovered with pleasure that all the pieces of which she was \r\ncomposed were so accurately arranged and numbered, that without \r\ntoo much presumption, I might flatter myself with the hope of \r\nbeing able effectually to collect and put them together, if I \r\ncould be allowed the necessary time, and could procure a convenient \r\nplace. I therefore, in spite of every disadvantage, decided on \r\nthe undertaking; and we immediately set about it. We proceeded, it \r\nmust be confessed, at first so slowly as to produce discouragement, \r\nif the desire of possessing so admirable a little vessel, quite \r\nnew, perfectly safe, easy to conduct, and which might at some \r\nfuture day be the means of our deliverance, had not at every \r\nmoment inspired us with new strength and ardour.\r\n\r\nEvening, however, was fast approaching, and we had made but small \r\nprogress; we were obliged to think of our promise to my wife; \r\nand though with reluctance, we left our occupation and re-embarked. \r\nOn reaching Safety Bay, we had the satisfaction of finding there \r\nour kind steward and little Francis; they had been, during the \r\nday, employed in some necessary arrangements for our living at \r\nTent-House as long as we should have occasion to continue the \r\nexcursions to the vessel: this she did to shorten the length \r\nof the voyage, and that we might be always in sight of each other. \r\nThis new proof of her kind attention affected me in a lively \r\nmanner, and I could not sufficiently express the gratitude which \r\nI felt, particularly as I knew the dislike she had conceived \r\nto living in this spot. I presented her with the valuable cargo \r\nwe brought, which I knew would give her pleasure, and regretted \r\nthat I had no better recompense to offer for the voluntary sacrifice \r\nshe had made to my accommodation. I made the best display I could \r\nof two casks of salted butter, three of flour, some small bags \r\nof millet-seed and of rice, and a multitude of other articles \r\nof utility and comfort for our establishment. My wife rewarded \r\nme by the expression of her perfect satisfaction, and the whole \r\nwas removed to our storehouse at the rocks.\r\n\r\nWe passed an entire week in this arduous undertaking of the pinnace. \r\nI embarked regularly every morning with my three sons, and returned \r\nevery evening, and never without some small addition to our stores. \r\nWe were now so accustomed to this manner of proceeding, that \r\nmy wife bade us good bye without concern, and we, on our parts, \r\nleft Tent-House without anxiety; she even had the courage to \r\ngo several times, with no companion but her little Francis, to \r\nFalcon’s Stream, to feed and take care of the poultry, and to \r\nbring back potatoes for our use. As night successively returned, \r\nwe had a thousand interesting things to tell each other, and \r\nthe pleasure of being together was much increased by these short \r\nseparations: we even enjoyed with a better appetite the excellent \r\nsupper our kind hostess at all times took care to prepare for \r\nus.\r\n\r\nAt length the pinnace was completed, and in a condition to be \r\nlaunched: the question now was, how to manage this remaining \r\ndifficulty. She was an elegant little vessel, perfect in every \r\npart: she had a small neat deck; and her mast and sails were \r\nno less exact and perfect than those of a little brig. It was \r\nprobable she would sail well, from the lightness of her construction, \r\nand in consequence, drawing but little water. We had pitched \r\nand towed all the seams, that nothing might be wanting for her \r\ncomplete appearance: we had even taken the superfluous pains \r\nof further embellishing by mounting her with two small cannon \r\nof about a pound weight; and, in imitation of larger vessels, \r\nhad fastened them to the deck with chains. But in spite of the \r\ndelight we felt in contemplating a commodious little vessel, \r\nformed for usefulness in all its parts, and the work, as it were, \r\nof our own industry, yet the great difficulty still remained: \r\nthe said commodious, charming little vessel still stood fast, \r\ninclosed within four walls; nor could I conceive of a means of \r\ngetting her out. To support the idea of so much time and labour \r\nbestowed for no end or advantage, was absolutely impossible; \r\nto effect a passage through the outer side of the vessel, by \r\nmeans of our united industry in the use of all the utensils we \r\nhad secured, seemed to present a prospect of exertions beyond \r\nthe reach of man, even if not attended with dangers the most \r\nthreatening and alarming. We now examined if it might be practicable \r\nto cut away all intervening timbers, to which, from the nature \r\nof the breach, we had easier access; but should we even succeed \r\nin this attempt, the upper timbers being, in consequence of the \r\ninclined position of the ship, on a level with the water, our \r\nlabour would be unavailing: besides, we had neither strength \r\nnor time for such a proceeding; from one moment to another, a \r\nstorm might arise and engulf the ship, timber, pinnace, ourselves, \r\nand all. Despairing, then, of being able to find a means consistent \r\nwith the sober rules of art, my impatient fancy inspired the \r\nthought of a project, which, if subjected to the experiment, \r\nmust necessarily be attended with hazards and dangers of a tremendous \r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI had found on-board, a strong iron mortar, such as is used in \r\nkitchens. I took a thick oak plank, and nailed to a certain part \r\nof it some large iron hooks: with a knife I cut a groove along \r\nthe middle of the plank. I sent the boys to fetch some match-wood \r\nfrom the hold, and I cut a piece sufficiently long to continue \r\nburning at least two hours. I placed this train in the groove \r\nof my plank: I filled the mortar with gun-powder, and then laid \r\nthe plank, thus furnished, upon it, having previously pitched \r\nthe mortar all round; and, lastly, I made the whole fast to the spot \r\nwith strong chains crossed by means of the hooks in every direction. \r\nThus I accomplished a sort of cracker, from which I expected \r\nto effect a happy conclusion. I hung this infernally-contrived \r\nmachine against the side of the bulk-head next the sea, having \r\ntaken previous care to choose a spot in which its action could \r\nnot affect the pinnace. When the whole was arranged, I set fire \r\nto the match, the end of which projected far enough beyond the \r\nplank to allow us sufficient time to escape. I now hurried on-board \r\nthe raft, into which I had previously sent the boys before applying \r\na light to the match; and who, though they had assisted in forming \r\nthe cracker, had no suspicion of the use for which it was intended, \r\nand believing all the while it concealed some subject of amusement \r\nfor their next trip to the vessel. I confess I had purposely \r\navoided giving them the true explanation, from the fear of the \r\nentire failure of my project, or that the vessel, pinnace, and \r\nall that it contained, might in consequence be blown up in a \r\nmoment. I had naturally, therefore, some reluctance to announce \r\nmyself before the time, as the author of so many disasters.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Tent-House, I immediately put the raft in a \r\ncertain order, that she might be in readiness to return speedily \r\nto the wreck, when the noise produced by the cracker should have \r\ninformed me that my scheme had taken effect. We set busily to \r\nwork in emptying her; and during the occupation, our ears were \r\nassailed with the noise of an explosion of such violence, that \r\nmy wife and the boys, who were ignorant of the cause, were so \r\ndreadfully alarmed as instantly to abandon their employment. \r\nWhat can it be?—what is the matter?—what can have happened? cried \r\nall at once. It must be cannon. It is perhaps the captain and \r\nthe ship’s company who have found their way hither! Or can it \r\nbe some vessel in distress? Can we go to its relief?\r\n\r\n_Mother._—The sound appeared to come in the direction of the \r\nwreck; perhaps she has blown up. Were you careful of not leaving \r\nany light which could communicate with gun-powder?—From the bottom \r\nof her heart she made this last suggestion, for she desired nothing \r\nmore earnestly than that the vessel should be annihilated, and \r\nthus an end be put to our repeated visits.\r\n\r\n_Father._—If this is the case, said I, we had better return \r\nimmediately, and convince ourselves of the fact.—Who will be \r\nof the party?\r\n\r\nI, I, I, cried the boys; and the three young rogues lost not \r\na moment in jumping into their tubs, whither I soon followed \r\nthem, after having whispered a few words to my wife, somewhat \r\ntending to explain, but still more to tranquillise her mind during \r\nthe trip we had now to engage in.\r\n\r\nWe rowed out of the bay with more rapidity than on any former \r\noccasion; curiosity gave strength to our arms. When the vessel \r\nwas in sight, I observed with pleasure that no change had taken \r\nplace in the part of her which faced Tent-House; and that no \r\nsign of smoke appeared: we advanced, therefore, in excellent \r\nspirits; but instead of rowing, as usual, straight to the breach, \r\nwe proceeded round to the side, on the inside of which we had \r\nplaced the cracker. The horrible scene of devastation we had \r\ncaused now broke upon our sight. The greater part of the ship’s \r\nside was shivered to pieces; innumerable splinters covered the \r\nsurface of the water; the whole exhibited a scene of terrible \r\ndestruction, in the midst of which presented itself our elegant \r\npinnace, entirely free from injury! I could not refrain from \r\nthe liveliest exclamations of joy, which excited the surprise \r\nof the boys, who had felt the disposition such a spectacle naturally \r\ninspired, of being dejected at the sight of so melancholy an event. \r\nThey fixed their eyes upon me with the utmost astonishment.—Now \r\nthen she is ours, cried I—the elegant little pinnace is ours! \r\nfor nothing is now more easy than to launch her. Come, boys, \r\njump upon her deck, and let us see how quickly we can get her \r\ndown upon the water.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Ah! now I understand you, father, you have yourself \r\nblown up the side of the ship with that machine you contrived \r\nin our last visit, that we might be able to get out the pinnace; \r\nbut how does it happen that so much of the ship is blown away?\r\n\r\n_Father._—I will explain all this to you when I have convinced \r\nmyself that the pinnace is not injured, and that there is no \r\ndanger of any of the fire remaining on-board: let us well examine. \r\nWe entered by the new breach, and had soon reason to be satisfied \r\nthat the pinnace had wholly escaped from injury, and that the \r\nfire was entirely extinguished. The mortar, however, and pieces \r\nof the chain, had been driven forcibly into the opposite side \r\nof the inclosure. Having now every reason to be satisfied and \r\ntranquil, I explained to the boys the nature of a cracker, the \r\nmanner of its operation, and the important service for which \r\nI was indebted to the old mortar.\r\n\r\nI now attentively examined the breach we had thus effected, and \r\nnext the pinnace. I perceived that it would be easy, with the \r\nhelp of the crow and the lever, to lower her into the water. \r\nIn putting her together, I had used the precaution of placing \r\nthe keel on rollers, that we might not experience the same difficulty \r\nas we had formerly done in launching our tub-raft. Before letting \r\nher go, however, I fastened the end of a long thick rope to her \r\nhead, and the other end to the most solid part of the wreck, \r\nfor fear of her being carried out too far. We put our whole ingenuity \r\nand strength to this undertaking, and soon enjoyed the pleasure \r\nof seeing our pretty pinnace descend gracefully into the sea; \r\nthe rope keeping her sufficiently near, and enabling us to draw \r\nher close to the spot where I was loading the tub-boat, and where \r\nfor that purpose I had lodged a pulley on a projecting beam, \r\nfrom which I was enabled also to advance with the completing \r\nof the necessary masts and sails for our new barge. I endeavoured \r\nto recollect minutely all the information I had ever possessed \r\non the art of equipping a vessel; and our pinnace was shortly \r\nin a condition to set sail.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion a spirit of military affairs was awakened in \r\nthe minds of my young flock, which was never after extinguished. \r\nWe were masters of a vessel mounted with two cannon, and furnished \r\namply with guns and pistols! This was at once to be invincible, \r\nand in a condition for resisting and destroying the largest fleet \r\nthe savages could bring upon us! In the height of exultation \r\nit was even almost wished they might assail us! For my own part, \r\nI answered their young enthusiasm with pious prayers that we \r\nmight ever escape such a calamity as the being compelled to use \r\nour fire arms. Night surprised us before we had finished our \r\nwork, and we accordingly prepared for our return to Tent-House, \r\nafter drawing the pinnace close under the vessel’s side. We arrived \r\nin safety, and took great care, as had been previously agreed \r\non, not to mention our new and invaluable booty to the good mother, \r\ntill we could surprise her with the sight of it in a state of \r\nentire completeness. In answer, therefore, to her inquiries as \r\nto the noise she heard, we told her that a barrel of gun-powder \r\nhad taken fire, and had shivered to pieces a small part of the \r\nship. We relied that no suspicion of the secret would occur to \r\nher mind, should she even have the fancy of looking at the vessel \r\nthrough the glass, as she sometimes did; for the pinnace lay \r\nso as to be concealed by the immense bulk of the ship’s body.\r\n\r\nTwo whole days more were spent in completely equipping and loading \r\nthe beautiful little barge we had now secured. When she was ready \r\nfor sailing, I found it impossible to resist the earnest importunity \r\nof the boys, who, as a recompense for the industry and discretion \r\nthey had employed, claimed my permission to salute their mother, \r\non their approach to Tent House, with two discharges of cannon. These \r\naccordingly were loaded, and the two youngest placed themselves, \r\nwith a lighted match in hand, close to the touch-holes, to be \r\nin readiness. Fritz stood at the mast to manage the ropes and \r\ncables, while I took my station at the rudder. These matters \r\nbeing adjusted, we put off with sensations of lively joy, which \r\nwas demonstrated by loud huzzas and suitable gesticulation. The \r\nwind was favourable; and so brisk, that we glided with the rapidity \r\nof a bird along the mirror of the waters: and while my young \r\nones were transported with pleasure by the velocity of the motion, \r\nI could not myself refrain from shuddering at the thought of \r\nsome possible disaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fritz at the same time discharged his pistols \r\nand all joined instantly in three loud huzzas]\r\n\r\nOur old friend the tub-raft had been deeply loaded and fastened \r\nto the pinnace, and it now followed as an accompanying boat to \r\na superior vessel. We took down our large sail as soon as we \r\nfound ourselves at the entrance of the Bay of Safety, to have \r\nthe greater command in directing the barge; and soon, the smaller \r\nones were lowered one by one, that we might the more securely \r\navoid being thrown with violence upon the rocks so prevalent \r\nalong the coast: thus, proceeding at a slower rate, we had greater \r\nfacilities for managing the important affair of the discharge \r\nof the cannon. Arrived within a certain distance—“_Fire_”—cried \r\ncommander Fritz. The rocks behind Tent-House returned the sound.\r\n—“_Fire_”—said Fritz again.—Ernest and Jack obeyed, and the echoes \r\nagain majestically replied. Fritz at the same moment had discharged \r\nhis two pistols, and all joined instantly in three loud huzzas.\r\n\r\nWelcome! welcome! dear ones, was the answer from the anxious \r\nmother, almost breathless with astonishment and joy! Welcome, \r\ncried also little Francis with his feeble voice, as he stood \r\nclinging to her side, and not well knowing whether he was to \r\nbe sad or merry! We now tried to push to shore with our oars \r\nin a particular direction, that we might have the protection \r\nof a projecting mass of rocks, and my wife and little Francis \r\nhastened to the spot to receive us: Ah, dear deceitful ones! \r\ncried she, throwing herself upon my neck and heartily embracing \r\nme, what a fright have you, and your cannon, and your little \r\nship thrown me into! I saw it advancing rapidly towards us, and \r\nwas unable to conceive from whence it could come, or what it \r\nmight have on board: I stole with Francis behind the rocks, and \r\nwhen I heard the firing, I was near sinking to the ground with \r\nterror; if I had not the moment after heard your voices, God \r\nknows where we should have run to—but come, the cruel moment \r\nis now over, and thanks to Heaven I have you once again in safety! \r\nBut tell me where you got so unhoped-for a prize as this neat \r\ncharming little vessel? In good truth it would really almost \r\ntempt me to venture once more on a sea voyage, especially if \r\nshe would promise to convey us back to our dear country! I foresee \r\nof what use she will be to us, and for her sake I think that \r\nI must try to forgive the many sins of absence you have committed \r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\nFritz now invited his mother to get on-board, and gave her his \r\nassistance. When they had all stepped upon the deck, they entreated \r\nfor permission to salute, by again discharging the cannon, and \r\nat the same moment to confer on the pinnace the name of their \r\nmother—_The Elizabeth_.\r\n\r\nMy wife was particularly gratified by these our late adventures; \r\nshe applauded our skill and perseverance: but do not, said she, \r\nimagine that I bestow so much commendation without the hope of \r\nsome return in kind: on the contrary, it is now my turn to claim \r\nfrom you, for myself and little Francis, the same sort of agreeable \r\nrecompense; for we have not, I assure you, remained idle while \r\nthe rest were so actively employed for the common benefit.—No, \r\nnot so; little Francis and his mother found means to be doing \r\nsomething also, though not at this moment prepared to furnish \r\nsuch unquestionable proofs as you, by your salutations of cannon, \r\n&c.: but wait a little, good friends, and our proofs shall hereafter \r\nbe apparent in some dishes of excellent vegetables which we shall \r\nbe able to regale you with.—It depends, to say the truth, only \r\non yourselves, dear ones, to go with me and see what we have \r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWe did not hesitate to comply, and jumped briskly out of the \r\npinnace for the purpose. Taking her little coadjutor Francis \r\nby the hand, she led the way, and we followed in the gayest mood \r\nimaginable. She conducted us up an ascent of one of our rocks, \r\nand stopping at the spot where the cascade is formed from Jackal’s \r\nriver, she displayed to our astonished eyes a handsome and commodious \r\nkitchen garden, laid out properly in beds and walks, and, as \r\nshe told us, every where sowed with the seed of useful plants.\r\n\r\nThis, said she, is the pretty exploit we have been engaged in, \r\nif you will kindly think so of it. In this spot the earth is \r\nso light, being principally composed of decayed leaves, that \r\nFrancis and I had no difficulty in working it, and then dividing \r\nit into different compartments; one for potatoes, one for manioc, and \r\nother smaller shares for lettuces of various kinds, not forgetting \r\nto leave a due proportion to receive some plants of the sugar-cane. \r\nYou, dear husband, and Fritz, will easily find means to conduct \r\nsufficient water hither from the cascade, by means of pipes of \r\nbamboo, to keep the whole in health and vigour; and we shall \r\nhave a double source of pleasure from the general prosperity, \r\nfor both the eyes and the palate will be gratified. But you have not \r\nyet seen all: there, on the slope of the rock, I have transplanted \r\nsome plants of the ananas. Between these, I have sowed some melon \r\nseeds, which cannot fail to succeed, thus securely sheltered \r\nand in so warm a soil: here is a plot allotted to pease and beans, \r\nand this other for all sorts of cabbage. Round each bed or plot \r\nI have sowed seeds of maize, on account of its tall and bushy \r\nform, to serve as a border, which at the same time will protect \r\nmy young plants from the scorching heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nI stood transported in the midst of so perfect an exhibition \r\nof the kind zeal and persevering industry of this most amiable \r\nof women! I could only exclaim, that I should never have believed in \r\nthe possibility of such a labour in so short a time, and particularly \r\nwith so much privacy as to leave me wholly unsuspicious of the \r\nexistence of such a project.\r\n\r\n_Mother._—To confess the truth, I did not myself at first expect \r\nto succeed, for which reason I resolved to say nothing of the \r\nmatter to any one, that I might not be put to the blush for my \r\npresumption. But as I found my little calculations answer better \r\nthan I expected, I was encouraged, and the hope of surprising \r\nyou so agreeably, gave me new strength and activity. I, on my \r\npart, however, had my suspicions that your daily visits to the \r\nwreck were connected with some great mystery, which at a certain \r\ntime you would be prepared to unfold—So, mystery for mystery, \r\nthought I; and thus, my love, it has turned out. Though acting \r\nin different directions, one only object has been our mutual \r\naim—the substantial good of our beloved companions of the desert!\r\n\r\nAfter a few jocose remarks with which we closed this conversation, \r\nwe moved towards Tent-House. This was one of our happiest days, \r\nfor we were all satisfied with ourselves and with each other; \r\nwe had conferred and received benefits, and I led my children \r\nto observe the goodness of Providence, who renders even labour \r\na source of enjoyment, and makes our own happiness result from \r\nthat of the objects of our affection, and our pride to arise \r\nfrom the commendations of which those objects may be deserving.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgot though, said my wife, after a short pause, \r\none little reproach I had to make you: your trips to the vessel \r\nhave made you neglect the bundle of valuable fruit saplings we \r\nlaid together in mould at Falcon’s Stream; I fear they by this \r\ntime must be dying for want of being planted, though I took care \r\nto water and cover them with branches. Let us go, my love, and \r\nsee about them.\r\n\r\nI readily consented to so reasonable a proposal. I should have \r\nbeen no less grieved than my wife, to see this charming acquisition \r\nperish for want of care. We had reason on many accounts to return \r\nquickly to Falcon’s Stream, where different matters required \r\nour presence. We had now in possession the greater part of the \r\ncargo of the vessel; but almost the whole of these treasures \r\nwere at present in the open air, and liable to injury from both \r\nsun and rain.\r\n\r\nMy wife prepared with alertness for our walk; and the rather \r\nfrom the aversion she had ever entertained, on account of the \r\nintense heat, for Tent-House. We hastened to unload the boat, \r\nand to place the cargo safely under shelter along with our other \r\nstores.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace was anchored on the shore, and fastened with a rope, \r\nby her head, to a stake. When all our stores were thus disposed \r\nof, we began our journey to Falcon’s Stream, but not empty-handed; \r\nwe took with us every thing that seemed to be absolutely wanted \r\nfor comfort; and when brought together, it was really so much, \r\nthat both ourselves and our beasts of burthen had no easy task \r\nto perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. \r\n\r\n_Gymnastic exercises;—various discoveries; singular animals, \r\n&c._ \r\n\r\nNeither our voyages to the wreck, nor the laboriousness of our \r\noccupations at Tent House had made us forget the regular observance \r\nof our duties on the sabbath-day, which now again occurred the day \r\nafter our return to Falcon’s Stream; and we accordingly distinguished \r\nit by consecrating the forenoon to reading the church prayers, \r\nsome chapters in the Bible, singing psalms, and lastly, the recital \r\nof a new parable I had invented, and which I had named the _Arabian \r\nTravellers_. I reminded my children in it, by the help of imagery \r\nand fictitious names, of all the aid and all the benefits bestowed \r\nupon us by an all-beneficent Providence, from the moment of our \r\nbeing cast upon our present abode;—that it was his compassion \r\nfor our station which had endued us with sagacity and perseverance \r\nin the discovery of so many things necessary for our existence; \r\nand one treasure, valuable above all the rest—a talisman, bestowed \r\nby the good genius who watched over poor defenceless wanderers. \r\nThis talisman was such as to inspire them on every occasion with \r\nthe knowledge of what was best for their happiness, and that \r\nby listening to these inspirations, they might be sure of always \r\nkeeping in the right path, and finding every want supplied. I need \r\nnot explain that by the good genius I alluded to the ever-watchful \r\ncare of the exemplary wife and mother; and by the talisman, the \r\nsacred volume she had so miraculously preserved and concealed \r\nin her enchanted bag. I was well understood by my hearers; and \r\nas I finished my discourse, the children all ran spontaneously \r\nat once to embrace their mother, addressing her by the term _Good \r\nGenius_, and thanking her for having been the means of securing the \r\nBible, to which we might all resort for consolation and instruction.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I again addressed my family with a short moral \r\ndiscourse, and then allowed them to use whatever kind of recreation \r\nthey pleased; one feature of my system being, not to tire them with \r\nthe subjects I wished them to feel an attachment for. I recommended \r\nto them, for the sake of uniting usefulness with their amusement, \r\nto resume the exercise we began upon the first Sunday of our \r\nabode in these regions, the shooting of arrows; for I had an \r\nextreme solicitude about their preserving and increasing their \r\nbodily strength and agility, which in a situation like ours, \r\nmight prove of such critical importance. Nothing tends more to \r\nthe extinction of personal courage in a human being, than the \r\nconsciousness of wanting that strength of limb, or that address, \r\nwhich may be necessary to aid us in defending ourselves, or in \r\nescaping from dangers. On this occasion, I added the exercises \r\nof running, jumping, getting up trees, both by means of climbing \r\nby the trunk, or by a suspended rope, as sailors are obliged \r\nto do to get to the mast-head. We began at first by making knots \r\nin the rope at a foot distance from each other; then we reduced \r\nthe number of knots, and before we left off, we contrived to \r\nsucceed without any. I next taught them an exercise of a different \r\nnature, with which they were unacquainted, and which was to be \r\neffected by means of two balls made of lead, fastened one to \r\neach end of a string about a fathom in length. While I was preparing \r\nthis machinery, all eyes were fixed upon me.—What can it be intended \r\nfor? cried one: How can we use it? asked another: Will it soon \r\nbe ready? continued a third.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Have a little patience, boys, if it be not quite impossible \r\nfor you to practise this precious virtue; for though the thing \r\nI am endeavouring to make for you may turn out extremely useful, \r\nyet this said virtue of patience is much more likely to be a \r\nconstant, steady, and efficient friend.—But now for the object \r\nof your curiosity. It is nothing less than an imitation of the \r\narms used by a valiant nation remarkable for their skill in the \r\nchase, and whom you all must have heard of: I mean the Patagonians, \r\ninhabitants of the most southern point of America; but instead \r\nof balls, which they are not able to procure, they tie two heavy \r\nstones, one at each end of a cord, but considerably longer than \r\nthe one I am working with: every Patagonian is armed with this \r\nsimple instrument, which they use with singular dexterity. If \r\nthey desire to kill or wound an enemy or an animal, they fling \r\none of the ends of this cord at him, and begin instantly to draw \r\nit back by the other, which they keep carefully in their hand, \r\nto be ready for another throw if necessary: but if they wish \r\nto take an animal alive, and without hurting it, they possess \r\nthe singular art of throwing it in such a way as to make it run \r\nseveral times round the neck of the prey, occasioning a perplexing \r\ntightness; they then throw the second stone, and with so certain \r\nan aim, that they scarcely ever miss their object: the operation \r\nof the second is, the so twisting itself about the animal as \r\nto impede his progress, even though he were at a full gallop. \r\nThe stones continue turning, and carrying with them the cord: \r\nthe poor animal is at length so entangled, that he can neither \r\nadvance nor retire, and thus falls a prey to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis description of the field sports of the Patagonians was heard \r\nwith much interest by the boys, who now all entreated I would \r\nthat instant try the effect of my own instrument upon a small \r\ntrunk of a tree which we saw at a certain distance. My throws \r\nentirely succeeded; and the string with the balls at the ends \r\nso completely surrounded the tree that the skill of the Patagonian \r\nhuntsmen required no further illustration. Each of the boys must \r\nthen needs have a similar instrument; and in a short time Fritz \r\nbecame quite expert in the art, as indeed he was in every kind \r\nof exercise that required strength or address: he was not only \r\nthe most alert of my children, but being the eldest, his muscles \r\nwere more formed, and his intelligence was more developed, than \r\ncould yet be expected in the other three.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as I was dressing, I remarked from my window \r\nin the tree that the sea was violently agitated, and the waves \r\nswelled with the wind. I rejoiced to find myself in safety in \r\nmy home, and that the day had not been destined for out-of-door \r\noccupation. Though such a wind was in reality quite harmless \r\nfor skilful sailors, for us it might be truly dangerous, from \r\nour ignorance in these matters. I observed then to my wife that \r\nI should not leave her the whole day, and should therefore hold \r\nmyself ready to execute any little concerns she found wanting \r\nin our domestic arrangement. We now fell to a more minute examination \r\nthan I had hitherto had time for, of all our various possessions \r\nat Falcon’s Stream. She showed me many things she had herself \r\nfound means to add to them during my repeated absences from home: \r\namong these was a large barrel filled with small birds half-roasted \r\nand stowed away in butter to preserve them fresh: this she called \r\nher _game_, which she had found means to ensnare with birdlime \r\nin the branches of the neighbouring bushes. Next she showed me \r\na pair of young pigeons which had been lately hatched, and were \r\nalready beginning to try their wings, while their mother was \r\nagain sitting on her eggs. From these we passed to the fruit-trees \r\nwe had laid in earth to be planted, and which were in real need \r\nof our assistance, being almost in a decaying state. I immediately \r\nset myself to prevent so important an injury. I had promised \r\nthe boys the evening before, to go all together to the wood of \r\ngourds, for the purpose of providing ourselves with vessels of \r\ndifferent sizes to keep our provisions in: they were enchanted \r\nwith the idea, but I bargained that they must first assist me \r\nto plant all the young trees; which was no sooner said than executed, \r\nexcited as we were by our eager desire for the promised excursion.\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished, a little disappointment however occurred; \r\nthe evening, I thought, seemed too far advanced for so long a \r\nwalk, especially as my wife and little Francis were to be of \r\nthe party. By the time that all were ready, it was too late to think \r\nof setting out, and we accordingly postponed the expected pleasure \r\ntill the following day, when we made the necessary preparations \r\nfor leaving Falcon’s Stream very early in the morning. By sun-rise \r\nall were on foot; for nothing can exceed the alertness of young \r\npersons who act in expectation of a pleasurable change of scene. \r\nThe ass, harnessed to the sledge, played on this occasion the \r\nprincipal character; his office was to be the drawing home the \r\nempty gourds for the service of our kitchen and the table, and \r\nin addition, little Francis, if he should be tired: in the journey \r\nout, he carried our dinner, a bottle of the Canary wine, and \r\nsome powder and shot. Turk, according to custom, led the way \r\nas our advanced guard; next followed the three eldest boys, equipped \r\nfor sporting; after them, their amiable mother, leading the little \r\none; and Ponto brought up the rear with the monkey on his back, \r\nto which the boys had given the name of Knips. On this occasion \r\nI took with me a double-barreled gun, loaded on one side with \r\nshot for game, and on the other with ball, in case of meeting \r\nwith an enemy.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we set out, full of good humour and high spirits, \r\nfrom Falcon’s Stream. Turning round Flamingo Marsh, we soon reached \r\nthe pleasant spot which before had so delighted us. My wife, \r\nwho now beheld for the first time its various beauties, was never \r\ntired of praising and admiring it. Fritz, who longed to be engaged \r\nin some sporting adventure, took a direction a little further \r\nfrom the sea-shore; and sending Turk into the tall grass, he \r\nfollowed himself, and both disappeared. Soon, however, we heard \r\nTurk barking loud, a large bird sprang up, and almost at the \r\nsame moment a shot from Fritz brought it down: but the bird though \r\nwounded was not killed; it raised itself and got off with incredible \r\nswiftness, not by flying, but by running. Turk pursued with the \r\neagerness of an animal enraged; Fritz, bawling out like a mad \r\ncreature, followed; and Ponto, seeing what was going on, threw \r\nthe monkey off his back, and fell speedily into the same track. \r\nIt was Ponto that seized the bird, and held it fast till Fritz \r\ncame up. But now a different sort of scene succeeded from that \r\nwhich took place at the capture of the flamingo. The legs of \r\nthat bird are long and weak, and it was able to make but a poor \r\nresistance. The present captive was large in size, and \r\nproportionately strong; it struck the dogs, or whoever came near, \r\nwith its legs, with so much force, that Fritz, who had received a \r\nblow or two, retired from the field of battle, and dared not again \r\napproach this feathered antagonist. Turk, who had gallantly assailed \r\nthe bird, was also discouraged by some severities applied to his \r\nhead by the sturdy combatant, and yielded the contest. The brave \r\nPonto alone withstood the animal’s attacks; he seized one of \r\nits wings, and did not let it go till I reached the spot, which \r\nI was long in doing on account of the height of the grass and \r\nthe great weight of my gun; but when I was near enough to distinguish \r\nthe bird as it lay on the ground, I was overjoyed to see that \r\nit was a female bustard of the largest size[2]. I had long wished \r\nto possess and to tame a bird of this species for our poultry-yard, \r\nthough I foresaw that it would be somewhat difficult.\r\n\r\nTo effect the complete capture of the bird without injuring it, \r\nI took out my pocket-handkerchief, and seizing a favourable moment, \r\nI threw it over the head of the bustard; it could not disengage \r\nitself, and its efforts only served to entangle it the more. \r\nAs in this situation it could not see me, I got sufficiently \r\nnear to pass a string with a running knot over its legs, which, \r\nfor the present, I drew tight, to prevent further mischief from \r\nsuch powerful weapons. I gently released its wing, which was \r\nstill in the possession of Ponto, and tied that and its fellow \r\nclose to the bird’s body. In short, the bustard was at length \r\nvanquished, though not till each and all of us had felt the powerful \r\nblows it was capable of inflicting.—But it was our own, and that \r\nin a condition to promise its preservation when we should once \r\nhave conveyed it to Falcon’s Stream, and could administer abundance \r\nof care and kindness to compensate for the rough treatment it \r\nhad experienced at our hands.\r\n\r\nWithout further delay we removed the prisoner to the spot on \r\nthe shore where some of our companions had been waiting our return. \r\nOn seeing us, Ernest and Jack ran briskly forward, bawling out, \r\nOh what a handsome bird! And what a size! What beautiful feathers!—I \r\nwill lay a wager that it is a female bustard, said Ernest, the \r\ninstant he had cast his eyes upon it. And you would win, my boy, \r\nanswered I; it is a female bustard; its flesh is excellent, having \r\nsomewhat of the flavour of the turkey, to which it also in some \r\nother respects has a resemblance. The male spreads its tail in \r\nthe form of a wheel, as is said, to please its female. Let us \r\nendeavour to tame and preserve it by all means.\r\n\r\n_Mother._—If I had the choice, I would give it back its liberty: \r\nmost likely it has young ones which stand in need of its assistance.\r\n\r\n_Father._—For this once, my dear, the kindness of your heart \r\nmisleads you; the poor bird, being wounded, would perish if set \r\nat liberty, for want of care. If, when I have examined its wound, \r\nI find it too serious to admit of cure, I shall kill it, and \r\nthus secure an excellent dish. But if the wound is slight, we \r\nshall have gained for our poultry yard a bird of rare value on \r\naccount of its size, and which will, it may be hoped, attract \r\nits mate, and thus furnish us with a brood of its species: should \r\nit even happen that it has at this time a young brood, it is not \r\nimprobable that they will find the way to take care of themselves, \r\nfor no doubt, like chickens, they were able to run as soon as \r\nthey came out of the egg.\r\n\r\nWhile conversing on this subject I had been fixing the bustard \r\non the sledge, taking care to place it in such a posture as to \r\nbe the least painful, and to avoid exciting it to struggle against \r\nits fetters. We then pursued our way towards the wood where Fritz \r\nand I had seen such troops of monkeys, who in their spite thought \r\nto beat us from the field by assailing us with showers of cocoa-nuts. \r\nFritz now again repeated the adventure with much humour to his \r\nmother. During this recital, Ernest was employed in going a little \r\nfrom us in every direction, in admiration of the height and beauty \r\nof the trees: he stopped in ecstasy at the sight of one in particular \r\nwhich stood alone, gazing with rapturous wonder at the prodigious \r\ndistance from the root to the nearest bunches of cocoa-nuts, \r\nwhich he saw hanging in clusters under their crown of leaves, \r\nand which excited an eager desire to possess some of them. I \r\nglided behind him without his perceiving me, and was highly amused \r\nwith the expression of his features: at length he drew a deep \r\nsigh and uttered these words:—Heavens! What a height!\r\n\r\n_Father._—Yes, my Ernest, they are indeed at a most unaccommodating \r\nheight, and not a monkey in the way to throw them down to you! \r\nEven were I to set Knips at liberty, besides that he is not in \r\nthe habit of giving away what he might keep for himself, he would \r\nperhaps take it into his head to stay in the tree when once there, \r\nso fond is every creature that lives of liberty! It is really \r\na pity, and I am sure you are of my opinion, that those fine \r\ncocoa-nuts cannot find a way to drop down into your mouth.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—No indeed, father, this is not the case; I have no \r\ngreat mind to them, I assure you; they are too hard, and would \r\nfall from too great a height: I should expect to have a tooth \r\nor two knocked out at least.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he ended his sentence, when a nut of the very largest \r\nsize fell down. Ernest, alarmed, stepped aside, and looked up \r\nat the tree: another fell, and almost near enough to touch me; \r\nso that I was no less surprised than he, not being able to imagine \r\nthe cause of the phenomenon. Not the smallest sign of a living \r\ncreature appeared, and I was certain that cocoa-nuts never fall \r\nof themselves, but when in a state of over-ripeness, while those \r\nwere absolutely hard and immature.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—This is somewhat like the adventures of Fairy-land, \r\nfather, I think—No sooner do the personages form a wish, than \r\nit is granted.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I begin indeed to think so. However, it may be that \r\nthe magician who is so ready to oblige us, may lie concealed \r\nbehind some of the leaves in the tree in the form of a wicked \r\nlittle monkey, which all the time may not intend so much to do \r\nus a favour, as to drive us from the place.\r\n\r\nErnest now ventured to take up the nuts. We found them even too \r\nunripe to be made use of, and were more than ever at a loss to \r\naccount for their falling from the tree, round which we continually \r\npaced, endeavouring to explain the mystery. In vain, however, \r\nwe strained our eyes; we saw nothing, but now and then a slight \r\nmotion of the leaves: but neither bird nor beast appeared; and \r\nnot a breath of wind was stirring.\r\n\r\nFritz had by this time concluded his narration to his mother; \r\nand observing that Ernest and I seemed occupied by something \r\nof a perplexing kind, and looked up repeatedly at one tree, he \r\nsupposed we must have discovered some animal in it, and ran to \r\nhave his share of the adventure, bringing also his younger brothers. \r\nWe told him what had passed:—he shewed us that he had the eyes \r\nof a lynx. I shall soon, said he, see what it all means, raising \r\nhis face to gaze at the tree; if one would but fall at this moment, \r\nI would soon tell you who threw it.—At the very instant two nuts \r\nfell, and so near to the speaker as to bruise his lip and his \r\nchin. Ernest could not refrain from laughing heartily. The magician \r\nis at least polite, said he; he conducts his gifts to your very \r\nmouth; and it is no fault of his if the dimensions of yours are \r\nnot large enough to receive it:—but look, look, there are two \r\nmore falling close to our mother and Francis. How well-behaved \r\nthis magician shows himself;—In proportion as the guests increase, \r\nhe takes care to send one for each. Let us quickly open one of \r\nthem and refresh ourselves with the liquor it contains, in drinking \r\nto the health of our unknown friend. We did so; and each obtained \r\na small quantity of the milk, in the fragments of the shell; \r\nand all called out together as they drank it, looking up at the \r\ntree, Long life and thanks to the good magician!—Ah, ah, I see \r\nhim; there he is, exclaimed Jack. Oh, heavens! what a hideous \r\ncreature! what an ugly shape he has! he is as large as my hat, \r\nand has two monstrous pincer claws.\r\n\r\nWhere is he then? said I, for I do not see him.—There, that is \r\nhe, father, crawling slowly down the tree; do you see him now?—It \r\nwas a land crab, an animal that, to say the truth, deserved Jack’s \r\ndescription of him. The land crab resembles the sea crab, but \r\nis ten times more hideous: some kinds of them are excellent food, \r\nand are the principal subsistence of the natives where they are \r\nfound. The one we now met with was of the kind called cocoa crab, \r\non account of its fondness for that fruit. It crawls with great \r\ndifficulty and slowly, up the trunk of the tree; when it has \r\nreached the clumps of leaves, it conceals itself in them, and \r\nfalls to pinching off the bunches of cocoa-nuts at the stalks; \r\nhe separates and then throws them down one by one, which often \r\nbruises them considerably. The crab then descends, and finds \r\nbelow a plentiful regale. It is said by some that their claws \r\nare strong enough to break the shell of the nut; but for myself, \r\nI doubt this, having always believed rather that they suck the \r\nmilk by means of the small hole found in the fruit near the stalk. \r\nThe land crab is not dangerous unless you are within reach of \r\nits claws, or, which is rarely the case, when they are found \r\ntogether in great numbers. Little Francis on seeing the animal \r\nwas terribly frightened, and hid himself behind his mother; even \r\nErnest drew back, and looked for a place of refuge: Jack, with \r\na menacing air, raised the end of his gun; and we all cast some \r\nlooks of curiosity as the creature slowly descended the tree. \r\nThe moment he was on the ground, the intrepid Jack aimed a blow \r\nat him with his gun, which missed him. The crab, finding himself \r\nattacked, turned round and advanced with his claws stretched \r\nopen towards his enemy. My little ruffian defended himself valiantly; \r\nhe did not retreat a single step, but his attempts to strike, \r\nentirely failed, for the crab was perfect in the art of evading \r\nevery blow. I however determined not to interfere: I saw that \r\nthere could be no danger to the boy, and that the scene would \r\nconclude by his subduing the animal, if he conducted the affair \r\nwith prudence and address. I must observe that nothing could \r\nbe more amusing than this exhibition of a fight between a little \r\nboy and a crab.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, being tired out with so many fruitless attempts, \r\nand perhaps recollecting that the pinches he might get from the \r\nanimal’s claws would not be very agreeable, and finding himself \r\nlikely to be brought to close quarters with him, suddenly gave \r\nhim the slip and ran off. The other boys now burst into peals \r\nof laughter, bawling out: So the magician has conquered you! \r\nhe has made you run away! poor Jack! but why did you engage with \r\na magician, Jack? On this, the lad piqued by their jeers, stopped \r\nshort, threw his gun and his game-bag on the ground, stripped off \r\nhis coat, spread it before him, and made a stand at his adversary, \r\nwho was making up to him with his claws stretched out in a menacing \r\nsort of motion. Jack, without a moment’s hesitation, threw his \r\ncoat upon the creature, and wrapped him round in it; then tapping \r\non the outside upon his shell: Wicked magician, cried he, I have \r\nyou at last! I will teach you to brandish your horns another \r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI laughed so heartily at this scene, that I had not the power \r\nto give him any assistance. I saw by the motion under the coat \r\nthat the crab was still alert and angry. I therefore took my \r\nhatchet and applied two or three powerful blows with it on the \r\ncoat, which I took for granted would finish the affair at once. \r\nI lifted up the coat; and, as I expected, the terrible animal \r\nwas dead, but still preserved a menacing posture.\r\n\r\nWhat an ugly monster! cried Jack, as he stood over him: but far \r\nfrom being terrified by his ugliness, it only served to quicken \r\nmy ardour:—one must always be glad to deliver the earth of such \r\na monster.\r\n\r\nYou would have something to do, my young Hercules, said I, tapping \r\nhim on the shoulder; no animal is so common as the crab on the \r\nshores of the sea: they are of numerous kinds, and may be seen by \r\nmillions, all equally ugly. This, if I mistake not, is distinguished \r\nby the name of _the poet’s crab_. What say you, Jack, to a thought \r\njust come into my head, of creating an order of knighthood for \r\nyou, in which you shall be dubbed—_Sir Crab_? This is the second \r\ntime that you have engaged in combat with these pincer-clawed \r\nanimals. We will say nothing of the first, in which you got a \r\nbite by the leg; but this time you have evinced considerable \r\ncourage and presence of mind. The thought of throwing your coat \r\nover the creature was well imagined; I doubt if you would have \r\nsubdued him by any other means. It must be an animal of prodigious \r\nstrength for its size, to be able to open a cocoa-nut, so that \r\nit was no inconsiderable enemy you were engaged with: but human \r\nprudence and reason give man the advantage over even the most \r\nformidable of the brute creation.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—May we eat crabs, father?—they are so very ugly!\r\n\r\n_Father._—Use makes all things easy. Many ugly things find their \r\nway to the most delicately served tables. For our crab, it is the \r\nfavourite food of the negro slaves of the Antilles, and frequently \r\nof their masters also. I should think its flesh must be hard \r\nand indigestible; but we will make trial of it for dinner.\r\n\r\nI put the famous animal along with the cocoa nuts it had been \r\nthe means of procuring us, together on the sledge, and we resumed \r\nour march. As we advanced, the wood became thicker and more difficult \r\nto pass; I was frequently obliged to use the hatchet to make \r\na free passage for the ass. The heat also increased, and we were \r\nall complaining of thirst, when Ernest, whose discoveries were \r\ngenerally of a kind to be of use, made one at this moment of \r\na most agreeable nature. He has already been described as a great \r\nlover of natural history, and now he was continually gathering, \r\nas he proceeded, such plants as he met with, and examining them \r\nwith care, with the view of adding to his stock of knowledge. \r\nHe found a kind of hollow stalk of a tolerable height, which \r\ngrew at the foot of the trees, and frequently entangled our feet \r\nin walking. He cut some of the plants with his knife, and was \r\nmuch surprised in about a minute to see a drop of pure fresh \r\nwater issue from them at the place where the knife had been applied: \r\nhe showed it to us, put it to his lips, and found it perfectly \r\nagreeable, and felt much regret that there was no more. I then \r\nfell to examining the phenomenon myself, and soon perceived that \r\nthe want of air prevented a more considerable issue of water. \r\nI made some more incisions, and presently water flowed out as \r\nif from a small conduit. Ernest, and after him the other boys, \r\nrefreshed themselves and quenched their thirst at this new fountain, \r\nin the completest manner. For my own part, touched with deep \r\ngratitude for the goodness of God towards me and my beloved family, \r\nI raised my eyes to heaven: See, children, said I, what a blessing \r\nis sent us by Providence in these beneficial plants, the name \r\nof which I am much concerned to be unacquainted with. What would \r\nbecome of poor travellers in this burning climate, in crossing \r\nsuch immense forests far from the relief of water-springs! they \r\nmust inevitably perish with heat and thirst, if the Almighty \r\ndid not extend his goodness to the providing these necessary \r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nI tried the experiment of dividing the plants longways, and they \r\nsoon gave out water enough to supply even the ass, the monkey, \r\nand the wounded bustard. We were still compelled to fight our \r\nway through thick bushes, till at length we arrived at the wood \r\nof gourds, which was the object of our excursion, and we were \r\nnot long in finding the spot where Fritz and I had once before \r\nenjoyed so agreeable a repose. Our companions had not soon done \r\nadmiring and wondering at the magnificence of the trees they \r\nnow beheld, and the prodigious size of the fruit which grew in so \r\nsingular a manner upon the trunk. Fritz, who was already acquainted \r\nwith particulars respecting them, now performed the office of \r\nlecturer to the rest, as I before had done to him. I was glad \r\nto observe that he had not forgot any part of the detail he received \r\nfrom me during our first visit; and while he was talking, I strolled \r\nabout the wood, choosing among the numerous sizes of the gourds, \r\nsuch as were particularly suited for our necessities, and marking \r\nthe places in my mind’s eye. I sought also to discover whether the \r\nmalicious horde of monkeys were not still in the same neighbourhood, \r\nfor I a little apprehended being molested by them during our \r\noccupation. I, however, to my great satisfaction, discovered \r\nno trace of them, and I returned to my companions.\r\n\r\nI found Jack and Ernest actively employed in collecting dried \r\nbranches and flints, while their mother was occupied in attending \r\nto the poor bustard, which however she saw reason to believe \r\nwas not materially injured. She remarked to me that it was cruel \r\nto keep her any longer blinded and her legs tied together on \r\nthe sledge. To please her, I took off the covering and loosened \r\nthe string on the legs, but still left it so as to be a guard \r\nagainst its running away or inflicting blows on those who might \r\napproach. I contented myself with tying her by a long string \r\nto the trunk of a tree, that she might relieve herself by walking \r\nabout. She had by no means the savageness of manners I should \r\nhave expected, excepting when the dogs went near her. She did \r\nnot appear to have any dread of man; which confirmed my previous \r\nbelief, that the island in which we existed, had absolutely no \r\nhuman inhabitants but ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe boys now amused themselves with making a large fire, which \r\nthey joyously surrounded. I took the liberty to laugh at them, \r\nand asked if they had become salamanders, or inhabitants of the \r\nplanet Mercury, who, it is said, make fires to refresh themselves \r\nfrom the burning heat of the sun; the heat of our island could \r\nscarcely be less ardent, and this irony was therefore fair and \r\nadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe fire, father, is to enable us to cook the magician.—Ah, hah, \r\nthat is quite another thing, replied I. It was then for the same \r\npurpose, I suppose, that I saw you picking up some large shells: \r\nyou mean no doubt to use them in the cooking, instead of the \r\nrind of the gourds which would not bear sufficient heat.\r\n\r\nThey all agreed to my conclusion. Begin then, continued I, by \r\nmaking the dish you will want for dressing your crab, before \r\nyou make a large fire and get roasted yourself by its side.\r\n\r\nI require also, said my wife, that some vessels to contain milk, \r\nand a large flat spoon to cut out my butter by pieces, and next \r\nsome pretty plates for serving it at table, should be completed, \r\ngentlemen, among you all.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You are perfectly reasonable in your demand, dear wife, \r\nsaid I; and for me there must be manufactured some nests for \r\nthe pigeons, some baskets for eggs, and some hives for bees.\r\n\r\n_All._—Oh yes, these things must all be made, we will set earnestly \r\nto work.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—But first, father, let me make a dish for my crab; the \r\nexcessive heat would certainly make him unfit to be eaten by \r\nthe evening, and I should be sorry to be obliged to throw away \r\nwhat it cost me so much trouble to obtain: I should soon have \r\nfinished, if you will tell me how to divide one of the rinds \r\nwith a string.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Well, well, it is but fair to allow you to enjoy the \r\nfruit of your victory. As to the cutting with a string, it was \r\ngood for something when we had no saw. I will however show you, \r\nfor fear of the worst, how to do it, though I took care to bring \r\nhere the different instruments I thought we might want. Gather \r\nthen a sufficient quantity of the gourds, of different sizes, \r\nand you shall see how soon we will cut them.\r\n\r\nThey all began to gather or collect, and we were soon in possession \r\nof a sufficient number of this valuable commodity. We found a \r\ncertain quantity already dry upon the tree, and these we considered \r\nfit for immediate use: many also were so bruised or broken in \r\nfalling, and others so immature, that we threw them aside as \r\nuseless. We now began our work: some had to cut; others to saw, \r\nscoop out, and model into agreeable forms. It was a real pleasure \r\nto witness the activity exhibited in this manufacture of porcelain: \r\neach tried what specimens of imagination he could present for \r\nthe applause of his companions. For my own part, I made a pretty \r\nbasket, large enough to carry eggs, with one of the gourds, leaving \r\nan arch at the top to serve as a cover. I likewise accomplished \r\na certain number of vessels, also with covers, fit to hold our \r\nmilk, and then some spoons to skim the cream. My next attempt \r\nwas to execute some bottles large enough to contain a supply \r\nof fresh water, and these occasioned me more trouble than all \r\nthe rest. It was necessary to empty the gourd through the small \r\nopening of the size of one’s finger which I had cut in it; I \r\nwas obliged after loosening the contents by means of a stick, \r\nto get them out by the friction of shot and water well shaken \r\non the inside. Lastly, to please my wife I undertook the labour \r\nof a set of plates for her use. Fritz and Jack engaged to make \r\nthe hives for the bees, and nests for the pigeons and hens. For \r\nthis last object, they took the largest gourds, and cut a hole \r\nin front proportioned to the size of the animal for whose use \r\nit was intended: they had when finished so very pretty an appearance, \r\nthat little Francis was ready to cry that he was not quite small \r\nenough to get into and live in one of them. The pigeons’ nests \r\nwere intended to be tied to the branches of our tree; those for \r\nthe hens, the geese, and the ducks, were to be placed between \r\nits roots or on the sea-shore, and to represent a sort of hen-coop. \r\nWhen the most essential of the utensils were finished, I allowed \r\nthem, as they had requested, to add a dish to dress their crab \r\nin. This also was soon accomplished; but when the cooking was \r\ncompleted, they discovered that they had no water. We found nothing \r\non this spot like our providential _fountain_ plants, as we had \r\nnamed them. The boys entreated me to go about with them in different \r\ndirections, and try to find a small supply of this precious article, \r\nnot daring by themselves to venture further into the wood.\r\n\r\nI was therefore of necessity compelled to accompany them. Ernest \r\nwith great eagerness proposed relieving me of this trouble, and \r\nputting himself in my place. He had found it impossible to succeed \r\nin assisting to make the utensils; he broke more than half the pieces \r\nof gourd he took in hand, and to make amends for his awkwardness, \r\nhe exerted himself in every direction to discover a water-spring, \r\nor to do something else that might be useful. It was not long \r\nbefore we heard him calling loudly to us, and saw him returning \r\nin great alarm. Run quick, father, said he, here is an immense \r\nwild boar. Oh, how he frightened me! I heard him grunting quite \r\nclose to me, and then he scampered away to the wood, and I hear \r\nhim at this very moment.\r\n\r\nHere, here! I then called out to the boys: call the dogs quickly; \r\nhere is fine game for us, if we are so lucky as to catch it. \r\nHalloo, here, Turk, Ponto! The dogs arrived full gallop. Ernest \r\nwas our leader, and conducted us to the place where the boar \r\nhad approached him; but he was gone, and we saw nothing but a \r\nplot of potatoes which had the appearance of having been ransacked \r\nby the animal. The ardour for the chase had been somewhat checked \r\nin Jack and Ernest, when they considered for a moment that they \r\nhad so formidable a creature as a boar to encounter; they stopped \r\nshort, and began to dig potatoes, and left it to Fritz and me \r\nto follow the traces of the dogs. We soon heard the cry of the \r\nlatter; for they had overtaken the runaway, and soon after the \r\nmost hideous growling assailed our ears from the same quarter.\r\n\r\nWe advanced with caution to the spot, holding our guns before \r\nus in readiness to fire together, the instant the animal should \r\nshow itself within the proper distance. Presently the spectacle \r\nof the two brave creatures attacking him on the right and left \r\npresented itself; each held one of his ears between their teeth. \r\nBut the beast was not a boar, as the account of Ernest had made \r\nme suppose, but a pig of the true common breed, which on our \r\napproach, appeared rather to ask for our assistance, than to \r\nhave any inclination to attack us. Contrary to our expectation, \r\nFritz and myself also suddenly lost the relish for sporting against \r\nthis animal; for we immediately recognised in the supposed boar, \r\nour own sow which had run away and had so long been lost. After \r\nthe first surprise we could not resist a hearty laugh; and then \r\nwe hastened to disincumber our old friend of the teeth of her \r\ntwo adversaries. Her frightful squalling resounded through the \r\nwood and drew the attention of our companions, who now ran to \r\nthe place, when a warfare of banter and accusation went round \r\namong the parties:—Fritz knew certain persons whose passion for \r\nthe chase ended in digging potatoes! Jack and Ernest returned \r\nthe sally by complimenting Fritz on the fine martial appearance \r\nof the wild boar they had been so fortunate as to make captive!—Why, \r\nFritz, we knew in a moment, by the grunting, that it was only \r\nour old sow.—You however believed it to be a wild boar, Mr. Ernest, \r\nreturned Fritz, and even after you had seen it.\r\n\r\nI know not what Ernest would have answered; for the attention \r\nof all was attracted to a kind of small potatoe which we observed \r\nlying thick on the grass around us, and which had fallen from \r\nsome trees which appeared loaded with the same production: our \r\nsow devoured them greedily, thus consoling herself for the fright \r\nshe had been put into, and the pain the dogs had occasioned her.\r\n\r\nThe fruit was of different colours, and extremely pleasing to the \r\neye. Fritz expressed his apprehension that it was the pernicious kind \r\nof apple called the Mancenilla, against which I had so strenuously \r\ncautioned them; but the sow ate them with so much eagerness, and \r\nthe tree which bore them being neither so high, and having neither \r\nthe form nor foliage ascribed by naturalists to the Mancenilla, \r\nmade me doubt of the truth of his idea. I forbore from immediately \r\npronouncing its condemnation; but I desired my sons to put some \r\nof the fruit in their pockets, to make an experiment with them \r\nupon the monkey. I was shortly after nearly satisfied of their \r\nharmless quality, from seeing that the two dogs also fell upon \r\nthem with eagerness; but I persisted in forbidding the boys to \r\ntaste them till I had further examined into their nature and \r\nproperties; and they all of course obeyed me. We now again, from \r\nextreme thirst, began to recollect our want of water, and determined \r\nto seek for some in every direction. Jack sprang off and sought \r\namong the rocks, hoping, and with reason, that he should discover \r\nsome little stream: but scarcely had he left the wood, than he \r\nbawled to us that he had found a crocodile . . . . . \r\n\r\nA crocodile! cried I with a hearty laugh, you have a fine \r\nimagination, my boy! who ever saw a crocodile on such scorching \r\nrocks as these, and with not a drop of water near? Now, Jack, you \r\nare surely dreaming . . . . .\r\n\r\nNot so much of a dream as you may think, father, answered Jack, \r\ntrying to speak in a low voice;—fortunately he is asleep;—he \r\nlies here on a stone at his full length;—he is exactly like our \r\nmother.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is excellent, upon my word! So then your mother \r\nis like a crocodile?—This is really an indiscreet sort of a joke.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I meant, father, that the crocodile is about as long \r\nas the height of our mother; I had not, I assure you, the least \r\nidea of a joke; for it is certainly a crocodile, though perhaps \r\nonly a young one . . . . . Do, father, step here and look at it, it \r\ndoes not stir in the least.\r\n\r\nI knew not what to think: we stole softly to the place where \r\nthe animal lay; but instead of a crocodile I saw before me an \r\nindividual of a large sort of lizard, named by naturalists _Leguana_ \r\nor _Yguana_[3], and the flesh of which is considered in the West \r\nIndies as the greatest delicacy. I explained this to my sons, \r\nand tranquillised them as to the danger of approaching this animal, \r\nformed by nature of a mild character, and excellent as food. \r\nAll were then immediately seized with the hope of seizing the \r\nlizard and presenting so rare a prize to their mother. Fritz \r\nin a moment had his gun ready, and was taking his aim, but that \r\nI was in time to lay hold of his arm and prevent him: You are \r\nalways too quick, said I, in your determinations; your piece \r\nmight have missed, or you might have wounded him only slightly; \r\nfor this sort of animal is protected by a coat of scales as you \r\nsee, and it is extremely difficult to destroy him. I think too \r\nthat he is known to be extremely dangerous if approached when \r\nhe is angry. Let us try another sort of experiment; as he is \r\nasleep, we need not be in a hurry: only a little contrivance \r\nis necessary to have him safe in our power alive, and the process \r\nwill afford us all an amusing spectacle.\r\n\r\nI cut a stout stick from a bush, to the extremity of which I \r\ntied a string with a running knot. I guarded my other hand simply \r\nwith a little switch, and thus with cautious steps approached \r\nthe sleeping animal. When I was very near to him, I began to \r\nwhistle a lively air, taking care to make the sounds low at first, \r\nand to increase in loudness till the lizard was awaked[4]. The \r\ncreature appeared entranced with pleasure as the sounds fell upon \r\nhis ear; he raised his head to receive them still more distinctly, \r\nand looked round on all sides to discover from whence they came. \r\nI now advanced by a step at a time, without a moment’s interval \r\nin the music, which fixed him like a statue to the place. At \r\nlength I was near enough to reach him with my switch, with which \r\nI tickled him gently, still continuing to whistle, one after \r\nthe other, the different airs I could recollect. The lizard was \r\nbewildered by the charms of the music; the attitudes he threw \r\nhimself into were expressive of a delirious voluptuousness; he \r\nstretched himself at full length, made undulating motions with \r\nhis long tail, threw his head about, raised it up, and by this \r\nsort of action, disclosed the formidable range of his sharp-pointed \r\nteeth, which were capable of tearing us to pieces if we had excited \r\nhis hostility. I dexterously seized the moment of his raising \r\nhis head, to throw my noose over him. When this was accomplished, \r\nthe boys drew near also, and wanted instantly to draw it tight \r\nand strangle him at once; but this I positively forbad, being \r\nunwilling to cause the poor animal so unmerited a suffering. \r\nI had used the noose only to make sure of him in case it should \r\nhappen that a milder mode of killing him, which I intended to \r\ntry, failed of success, in which case I should have looked to \r\nthe noose for protection; but this was rendered unnecessary. \r\nContinuing to whistle my most affecting melodies, I seized a \r\nfavourable moment to plunge my switch into one of his nostrils; \r\nthe blood flowed in abundance, and soon deprived him of life, \r\nwithout his exhibiting the least appearance of being in pain; \r\non the contrary, to the last moment he seemed to be still listening \r\nto the music.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was dead I allowed the boys to come quite near \r\nand to tighten the noose, which we now found useful to draw him \r\nto the ground from the large stone on which he lay. My sons were \r\ndelighted with the means I had used for killing him without pain. \r\nBut little praise is due to me, I replied; for I have often in \r\nbooks of travels, read the description of the manner of deluding \r\nand destroying this animal, so well known in the West Indies. \r\nBut now let us consider of the best way for transporting to Falcon’s \r\nStream so large and valuable a booty. After a moment of reflection, \r\nI perceived that I had better come at once to the determination \r\nof carrying him across my shoulders: and the figure I made with \r\nso singular an animal on my back, with his tail dragging on the \r\nground, was not the least amusing circumstance of the adventure. \r\nFritz and Jack presented themselves as pages, contending which should \r\nsupport my train, as they called the tail, which, independently \r\nof the good-humour inspired amongst us, considerably eased me \r\nof the weight, and gave me the air of an old Chinese emperor \r\nhabited in a superb royal mantle of many colours, for those of \r\nthe lizard shone like precious stones in the eyes of the sun.\r\n\r\nWe were already far advanced in our return, when we distinguished the \r\nvoice of my wife calling upon my name in a tone which indicated great \r\nuneasiness; and in addition, we heard loud sobs from little Francis. \r\nOur long absence had excited painful apprehensions concerning \r\nus: we had forgot on this occasion to give them notice of our \r\napproach, by firing our gun, and they had imagined some terrible \r\ndisaster must have befallen us. No sooner, however, did our cheerful \r\nnotes in speaking reach their ear, than their fears and lamentations \r\nwere changed to joy, and we soon found ourselves assembled together, \r\nthe happiest of beings, under a large gourd-tree, where we related \r\nto our dear companions every particular of the excursion we had \r\nmade; not forgetting Jack’s singular fancy of finding a resemblance \r\nbetween his mother and the lizard, who now lay extended at her \r\nfeet. We had so many things to inform her of, that we lost sight \r\nof the principal object which caused our separation; and till \r\nshe reminded us with some regret at our ill success, we forgot \r\nto mention that we had failed of procuring any water. My sons \r\nhad taken out some of the unknown apples from their pockets, \r\nand they lay on the ground by our side. Knips soon scented them, \r\nand according to custom he came slily up and stole several, and \r\nfell to chewing them with great eagerness. I myself threw one \r\nor two to the bustard, who also ate them without hesitation. \r\nBeing now convinced that the apples were not of a poisonous nature, \r\nI announced to the boys, who had looked on with envy all the \r\ntime, that they also might now begin to eat them, and I myself \r\nset the example. We found them excellent in quality, and I began \r\nto suspect that they might be the sort of fruit called _guava_, \r\nwhich is much esteemed in such countries. The tree which bears \r\nthem is sometimes twenty feet in height; no doubt therefore, \r\nthose from which we procured the fruit, were too young to have \r\nattained their full stature. The tree itself is of so fertile \r\na nature, that in inhabited countries they are constantly obliged \r\nto be thinned and cut down, on account of the quantity of land \r\nthey would occupy.\r\n\r\nThis regale of the apples had in some measure relieved our thirst; \r\nbut on the other hand, they had increased our hunger; and as \r\nwe had not time for preparing a portion of the lizard, we were \r\nobliged to content ourselves with the cold provisions we had \r\nbrought with us. But we contrived to have an excellent dessert \r\nof potatoes, which the boys had had the foresight to lay under \r\nthe cinders of the fire they had made to cook their crab.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely finished taking this refreshment, before my wife \r\nearnestly entreated that we might immediately begin our journey \r\nhome, to be sure of arriving before dark. In fact, it appeared \r\nto me, as the evening was so far advanced, that it would be prudent \r\nto return this once without the sledge, which was heavy laden, \r\nand the ass would have drawn it but slowly: I was besides, inclined \r\nto take a shorter road by a narrow path that divided a plantation \r\nof thick bushes, which would have been too difficult a passage \r\nfor the ass burthened with the sledge. I therefore determined \r\nto leave it on the spot till the following day, when I could \r\nreturn and fetch it, contenting myself with loading the ass for \r\nthe present, with the bags which contained our new sets of porcelain; \r\nwith the lizard, which I feared might not keep fresh so long; \r\nand our little Francis, who began to complain of being tired. \r\nI took these arrangements upon myself, and left to my wife and \r\nFritz, the care of confining the bustard in such a manner that \r\nshe could walk before us without danger of escaping.\r\n\r\nWhen these preparations were complete, our little caravan was \r\nput in motion, taking the direction of a straight line to Falcon’s \r\nStream. On leaving the wood of gourds, we arrived at a spot where \r\nwe found more of the guava trees, and could not resist the temptation \r\nto stay a few moments and secure a new supply. The course of our \r\nroute lay next along a majestic wood of oaks, agreeably interspersed \r\nwith fig-trees of luxuriant growth, and of the same species as \r\nthose at Falcon’s Stream. The ground in this place was absolutely \r\ncovered with acorns. My young travellers, ever on the watch for \r\nsomething new and gratifying to the palate, could not refrain \r\nfrom tasting them: in form they exactly resembled the same fruit \r\nin Europe, though from the difference of climate, they would \r\nprobably not be the same in regard to quality and flavour. One \r\nof the boys bit an acorn in two; and finding it both sweet and \r\nmild to the taste, he told his brothers, who soon fell eagerly \r\nto filling their own pockets with them, as well as mine and those \r\nof their mother. I always hailed with satisfaction every occasion \r\nthat presented, of increasing the number of our resources for \r\nsupport: in the one that now presented itself, I perceived the \r\nhope that we might not only be ourselves nourished but our poultry \r\nalso: I more than ever admired the magnificence of the trees \r\nwhich at this moment covered us with their shade, and made us \r\na present of so inestimable a value: on considering, I recognised \r\nthat they were a kind of oak which remains always green, and \r\nare a common production of the woods in Florida, and that the \r\nIndians of North America extract from its fruit an excellent \r\nkind of sweet oil, which they use in cooking their rice. Numerous \r\nkinds of birds subsist upon these acorns. This we were led to \r\nremark, by the wild and discordant cries of several sorts of \r\njays and parrots, which were skipping merrily among the foliage \r\nand the branches. The boys would instantly have fired their guns; \r\nand I could only prevail upon them to desist, by observing how \r\nlate it was, and promising that we would return another time, \r\nand thus procure them an opportunity for their favourite amusement.\r\n\r\nWe arrived shortly, and sooner than we expected, at Falcon’s \r\nStream; the path we had taken had so considerably lessened the \r\ndistance, that we were in time to employ ourselves in some trifling \r\narrangements, before it was completely dark. My wife had great \r\npleasure in taking out her service of porcelain and using some \r\nof the articles that very evening; particularly the handsome \r\negg-basket and the vessels for the milk. Fritz was instructed \r\nto dig a place in the ground to serve for a kind of cooler, the \r\nbetter to preserve the milk; and we covered it with boards and \r\nput heavy stones to keep them down. Jack took the pigeons’ nests, \r\nand scampered up the tree, where he nailed them to the branches; \r\nhe next laid some dry moss within, and placed one of the female \r\npigeons we had contrived to tame, and which at the time was brooding, \r\nupon it; he put the eggs carefully under the mother, who seemed \r\nto accept his services, and to coo in return, with gratitude.\r\n\r\nErnest was occupied in distributing and fixing those intended \r\nfor the fowls among the roots of the trees: when he had finished, \r\nit was of importance to observe how well they would accustom \r\nthemselves to this their new abode; they were already on their \r\nperches, with their head under their wing and half asleep, and \r\ntook very much amiss the being thus disturbed; while Ernest, \r\nfor his part, was enraged at the little inclination they discovered \r\nto inhabit their new abode.\r\n\r\nMy own employment was to clean the inside of the lizard and prepare \r\na piece of it for our supper, my wife having expressed an extreme \r\nrepugnance to both the lizard and the crab; we therefore added \r\nsome potatoes and some acorns, and dressed them together, and \r\nthus suited every palate. Francis had the care of turning the \r\nspit, and liked his office all the better, for its allowing of \r\nhis being constantly near his mother. We all drew near a clear \r\nbrisk fire while the supper was in hand: a sea breeze had refreshed \r\nthe air, and after great fatigue, a good fire seldom fails to \r\noccasion agreeable sensations. This well-spent and useful day \r\nwas concluded by a refreshing repast, at which all but my wife \r\nbestowed encomiums on the palatable properties of the leguana. \r\nMy wife could not prevail upon herself even to taste it; she \r\ntherefore supped on the potatoes. The crab was found to have \r\nbut little flavour, and was put aside as useless. We concluded \r\nthe exertions of the day, by contriving a comfortable bed for \r\nthe bustard by the side of the flamingo, and then hastened to \r\nstretch our weary limbs upon the homely couch, but rendered by \r\nfatigue luxurious, that waited for us in the giant tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. \r\n\r\n_Excursion into unknown countries._\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to relate, that my first thought the \r\nnext morning, was to fetch the sledge from the wood. I had a \r\ndouble motive for leaving it there, which I had refrained from \r\nexplaining to my wife, to avoid giving her uneasiness. I had \r\nformed a wish to penetrate a little further into the soil, and \r\nascertain whether any thing useful would present itself beyond \r\nthe wall of rocks. I was, besides, desirous to be better acquainted \r\nwith the extent, the form, and general productions of our island: \r\nI wished Fritz only, who was stronger and more courageous than \r\nhis brothers, to accompany me; and accordingly left the three \r\nothers, and Ponto, to protect my wife. We allowed Turk to be \r\nour travelling companion, who did not fail to testify his joy \r\nby jumping about, and barking loud. We set out very early in \r\nthe morning, and drove the ass before us for the purpose of drawing \r\nhome the sledge.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the wood of ever-green oaks, we found the sow feeding \r\nvoluptuously upon the acorns under the trees. We wished her a \r\ngood appetite, and begged her to admit us to the honour of partaking \r\nher breakfast; and accordingly Fritz filled the pockets of his \r\nwaistcoat with some of them. We perceived with pleasure that \r\nthe lecture of the preceding day had rendered the animal more \r\ntractable: she did not now seek to avoid us; and we might even \r\nhave induced her to return home, if we had had time to take the \r\npains. As we were quietly picking up some of the acorns, we observed \r\nsome birds, which occupied the wood in every direction, advancing \r\ntowards us. Some of them were clothed with a plumage of exquisite \r\nbeauty; and for this once, I could not refuse Fritz the pleasure \r\nof firing upon them, that we might in consequence obtain a nearer \r\nview, and inform ourselves respecting their species. He brought \r\ndown three. I recognised one to be the great blue Virginia jay, \r\nand the other two were parrots. One of the two was a superb red \r\nparrot; the other was green and yellow.\r\n\r\nWhile Fritz was reloading his gun, we heard a singular sort of \r\nnoise which came from a distance: at one moment it resembled \r\na muffled drum, at another, the noise made in sharpening a saw. \r\nMy first idea was of music played by savages, and we retreated \r\nquickly to hide ourselves among the bushes to listen. By degrees \r\nwe advanced towards the place from whence the sound appeared \r\nto come; but perceiving nothing to alarm us, we separated some \r\nof the branches with our hands, and then discovered a handsome \r\nbird about the size of the English cock; and, like it too, adorned \r\nwith elegantly-formed smooth feathers round the neck, and a comb \r\nupon his head. The animal stood erect on a decayed trunk of a \r\ntree, which was lying on the ground, and at this moment exhibited \r\nsome singular gestures. His tail was spread in the form of a \r\nfan, similar to that of the turkey-cock, but shorter; the feathers \r\nround his neck and head were erect and bristling. He sometimes \r\nagitated them with so quick a motion, as to make them appear \r\nlike a vapour which suddenly inclosed him; sometimes he whirled \r\nhimself round and round on the trunk of the tree; at others he \r\nmoved his head and eyes in such a manner as to express a state \r\nof distraction, making at the same time, the singular kind of \r\nnoise with his voice, which had alarmed us, and which was preceded \r\nand followed by a sort of explosion. This last was caused by \r\na motion of his wing striking in a quick measure on the trunk, \r\nwhich was hollow and dry, and made the noise resemble a muffled \r\ndrum. All around him, there was assembled a great number of birds \r\nof the same species, but much smaller, and of a less beautiful \r\nform. One and all fixed their eyes upon him, and seemed delighted \r\nwith the pantomime. I contemplated this extraordinary spectacle, \r\nof which I had formerly read an account, with astonishment. The \r\nnumber of the spectators of the feathered actor, increased every \r\nmoment; and the performance increased in spirit also, in proportion, \r\npresenting the idea of a perfect intoxication or delirium of \r\nthe creature. At this moment, Fritz, who stood a little behind \r\nme, put an end to the scene by firing off his gun. The actor \r\nfell from the stage, and stretching himself on the sand, breathed \r\nhis last, and the spectators betook themselves suddenly to flight. \r\nI must confess, the interest I took in the scene was of so lively \r\na nature, that I could not refrain from reproaching Fritz in \r\nan angry tone. Why, said I, must we be always applying the means \r\nof death and annihilation to the creatures that fall in our way? \r\nIs not nature a thousand times more exhilarating in her animated \r\nmovements, which express life and enjoyment, than in the selfish \r\nscheme of destruction you seem so fond of? Some allowance should \r\nno doubt be made for the curiosity of youth, for necessities \r\ncaused by our situation, and even for the taste you have acquired \r\nfor sporting; I therefore, as you well know, do not object to \r\nyour killing now and then a little game, or some singular or \r\ndangerous kind of animal; but moderation is on all occasions \r\nuseful, and the spectacle of this bird, employed in such earnest \r\nendeavours to draw his females around him, was at least as amusing, \r\nas to see him stretched there at length, and lifeless, who but \r\ntwo minutes ago exhibited such rapid and lively motions! His \r\npretty hens too all dispersed in terror, and deprived of the \r\npossibility of ever more admiring him or being his companions.\r\n\r\nFritz looked down, ashamed and sorry. I observed to him that \r\nthe thing being done, there was now no remedy; that the tetrix[5] \r\nor heath-cock was much esteemed as game; and that as the mischief \r\nhad occurred, he had better take it from the ground and carry \r\nit to his mother.\r\n\r\nHe did as I desired; and in spite of my lecture I saw that he \r\nwas rejoiced to have acquired such a prize. Is it not a beautiful \r\ncreature, father? said he: but I am most curious to be informed \r\nwhat all his action was intended to represent.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I imagine his gestures and his cries were intended \r\nto assemble his females, of which he has a large number, similar \r\nto the common cock of Europe. I cannot help thinking, Fritz, \r\nhow cruel it was thus to interrupt the poor creature’s innocent \r\namusements.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I am now extremely sorry for it, father; particularly \r\nwhen I recollect that we might have caught him alive, and that \r\nit is so desirable to have possessed this kind of fowl at Falcon’s \r\nStream.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is precisely what I was going to observe; I am \r\nnot sure that it is now too late to effect such a plan;—when \r\nwe see either of the hens disposed to brood, we will bring the \r\nmonkey here to search about for the eggs of these animals; if \r\nwe should be so lucky as to find a nest, which I think probable, \r\nwe will take away the eggs, and put them under the brooding hen; \r\nby these means we shall procure some of this handsome race of \r\nfowls.\r\n\r\nWe now laid the dead cock upon the ass’s back, and proceeded \r\non our journey. We soon arrived at the guava trees, and a little \r\nafter at the spot where we had left the sledge in the wood of \r\ngourds, when we found our treasures in the best possible condition: \r\nbut as the morning was not far advanced, we entered upon our \r\nintended project of penetrating beyond the wall of rocks.\r\n\r\nWe pursued our way in a straight line at the foot of these massy \r\nand solid productions of nature, every moment expecting to reach \r\ntheir extremity, or to find some turn, or breach, or passage \r\nthrough them, that should conduct us into the interior of the \r\nisland, if, as I presumed, it was not terminated by these rocks. \r\nWe walked on, continually looking about, that nothing might escape \r\nus worthy of notice, or to be enabled to anticipate and avoid \r\nsuch dangers as should threaten. Turk with his usual bravery \r\ntook the lead, the ass followed with lazy steps shaking his long \r\nears, and Fritz and I brought up the rear. We met from time to \r\ntime with some small streams which afforded a most agreeable \r\nrefreshment; we passed a wood of guava trees and fields of potatoes \r\nand manioc, the stalks of which perplexed our way; but we were \r\nrecompensed for this inconvenience by the fine views which every \r\nwhere presented themselves, and which the low stature of the \r\nplants enabled us to see in perfection. To the right, on the \r\nhigh grounds, we saw hares and agoutis in considerable numbers, \r\namusing themselves on the grass in the morning sun. Fritz mistook \r\nthem for marmots, but not one of them made the whistling kind \r\nof sound which is customary with these animals when they see a \r\nstrange object. The idea of my son seemed therefore to be unfounded: \r\nagain he wished to be convinced by firing his gun; but fortunately, \r\nthe rock on which they were stationed, was at too great a distance \r\nfor it to take effect.\r\n\r\nWe next entered a pretty little grove, the trees of which were \r\nunknown to us; their branches were loaded with large quantities \r\nof berries of an extraordinary quality, being entirely covered \r\nwith a wax which stuck to our fingers as we attempted to gather \r\nthem[6]. I knew of a sort of bush producing wax that grows in \r\nAmerica, and named by botanists _Myrica cerifera_; I had no doubt \r\nthat this was the plant, and the discovery gave me great pleasure. \r\nLet us stop here, said I to Fritz, for we cannot do better than \r\ncollect a great quantity of these berries as a useful present \r\nto your mother.\r\n\r\nA short time after, another kind of object presented itself with \r\nequal claims to our attention; it was the singular modes of behaviour \r\nof a kind of bird scarcely larger than a chaffinch, and clothed \r\nin feathers of a common brown colour. These birds appeared to \r\nexist as a republic, there being among them one common nest, \r\ninhabited at pleasure by all their tribes. We saw one of these \r\nnests in a tree in a somewhat retired situation; it was formed \r\nwith considerable skill of platted straws and bulrushes intermixed; \r\nit appeared to us to inclose great numbers of inhabitants, and \r\nwas constructed in an irregular sort of form round the trunk \r\nof the tree where the branches sprout: it appeared to us to have \r\na kind of roof formed of roots and bulrushes, but more carefully \r\nknit together than the rest of the structure. In the sides, which \r\nwere unequally formed, we observed a quantity of small apertures \r\nseemingly intended as doors and windows to each particular cell \r\nof this general receptacle; from a few of these apertures, issued \r\nsome small branches, which served the birds as points of rest \r\nfor entering and returning: the external appearance of the whole, \r\nexcited the image of an immensely large, open, spunge. The birds \r\nwhich inhabited it were very numerous; they passed in and out \r\ncontinually, and I estimated that it might contain at least a \r\nmillion. The males were somewhat larger than the females, and \r\nthere was a trifling difference in their plumage: the number \r\nof the males was very small in proportion to the females; I do \r\nnot know whether this had been the cause of their thus assembling \r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWhile we were attentively examining this interesting little colony, \r\nwe perceived a very small kind of parrot, not much larger than \r\nthe birds themselves, hovering about the nest[7]. Their gilded \r\ngreen wings and the variety of their colours produced a beautiful \r\neffect; they seemed to be perpetually disputing with the colonists, \r\nand not unfrequently endeavoured to prevent their entrance into \r\nthe building; they attacked them fiercely, and even endeavoured \r\nto peck at us if we but advanced our hand to the structure. Fritz, \r\nwho was well trained in the art of climbing trees, was earnestly \r\ndesirous to take a nearer view of such extraordinary beings, \r\nand to secure, if possible, a few individuals. He threw his whole \r\nequipage to the ground, and climbed till he reached the nest; \r\nhe then tried to introduce his hand into one of the apertures, \r\nand to seize whatever living creature it should touch, in that \r\nparticular cell; what he most desired, was to find a female brooding, \r\nand to carry both her and the eggs away. Several of the cells \r\nwere empty, but by perseverance he found one in the situation \r\nhe wished. But he did not pursue his plan without meeting with \r\nthe full punishment of his curiosity and ungenerous behaviour. \r\nHe received so violent a stroke from the beak of an invisible \r\nbird, that his only care was now to withdraw his hand, which \r\nhe shook in the air to ease the pain, uttering all the time the \r\nmost dismal lamentations. But though punished, he was not cured \r\nof his fault: no sooner had the pain subsided, than he ventured \r\na second time to pass his hand into the nest, and succeeded in \r\nseizing his prey, which he laid hold of by the middle of the \r\nbody; and in spite of the bird’s resistance, its cries and wailings, \r\nhe drew it through the aperture and squeezed it into the pocket \r\nof his waistcoat; and buttoning it securely, he slided down the \r\ntree and reached the ground in safety. The signals of distress \r\nsent forth by the prisoner collected a multitude of birds from \r\ntheir cells, who all surrounded him, uttering the most hideous \r\ncries, and flying at him with their beaks, till he had made good \r\nhis retreat. The birds pursued him till he was quite close to my \r\nside, when by making a loud noise and waving my pocket-handkerchief, \r\nI succeeded in driving them away. He now released the prisoner, \r\nand we discovered him to be a beautiful little green parrot, \r\nwhich Fritz entreated he might be allowed to preserve, and make \r\na present of to his brothers, who would make a cage to keep him \r\nin, and would then tame him and teach him to speak. I did not \r\noppose his request; but thinking we had spent too much time upon \r\nthis singular phenomenon of the bird colony, I bade him prepare \r\nquickly for returning home. The birds were naturally the subject \r\nof our conversation on the road. It was the first time I had \r\never witnessed such a spectacle as a swarm of birds living together \r\nin a state of society in one nest; and I was surprised at it. \r\nFrom the circumstance of so young a bird being nestled within \r\nthe structure, it appeared probable that the true right of property \r\nwas in this species, and that the brown-coloured birds we at \r\nfirst observed, were intruders, endeavouring to deprive them \r\nof it. Thus we find, said I to Fritz, the existence of social \r\ndispositions in almost every class of the animal kingdom, which \r\nleads to the combining together for a common cause or benefit. \r\nI have not hitherto observed these dispositions among amphibious \r\nanimals, but it is not unlikely that instances will at some time \r\nor other present themselves. A multitude of causes may induce \r\nanimals to form a body or society, instead of living singly; \r\namong them may be supposed the deficiency of females or of males; \r\nthe charge of the young; providing them with food; or as a means \r\nfor their safety and protection. Who shall dare to fix limits \r\nto the instinct, or to the faculties of the animal creation?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I do not, however, recollect any kind of animals who \r\nlive thus together in society, except the bees.\r\n\r\n_Father._—What say you then, my boy, to wasps, drones, and different \r\nkinds of ants?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I did not indeed recollect the ants, though I have so \r\noften amused myself with looking at them: nothing can be more \r\ninteresting than the ingenious little houses they construct; \r\nobserving them attentively, we perceive their industry, their \r\neconomy, their care of their young;—in a word, all their \r\nundertakings, conducted on a plan of society and numbers.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Have you also observed with what a provident kind of \r\ninstinct they bring out their eggs to be warmed by the sun, and \r\nfor this end remove them from place to place till the time of \r\ntheir maturity?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Is it not probable, father, that what we take for eggs, \r\nare chrysales of ants, which, like many other insects, are thus \r\nshut up while the process of their taking wings is in the operation?\r\n\r\n_Father._—You may be right. Writers on natural history have \r\nconsidered the industry and frugality of these insects, as a subject \r\nnot unworthy of their close consideration[8]; but if the common ant \r\nof our own country excited so much of your admiration, in what \r\nwords will you express your astonishment at the almost incredible \r\nlabours which are performed by the ants of foreign countries! \r\nOf these there is a kind which build nests of four, six, and \r\neight feet in height, and large in proportion: the external walls \r\nof these structures are formed so thick and solid, that neither \r\nsun nor rain can penetrate them. These houses contain within, \r\nlittle streets, arched roofs, piazzas, colonnades, and particular \r\napartments for the offices of housewifery: and the whole of this \r\ncomplicated mass is put together with so much solidity of \r\nworkmanship, that if emptied and cleaned, it might serve for an oven. \r\nThe ant is for the most part an animal of pilfering propensities, \r\non the profits of which it principally lives; it is also remarkable \r\nfor constancy in its designs, and remaining ever in one place: \r\na species of them exists, however, in America, which is known \r\nby the name of the _cephalate_ or visiting ant; they make their \r\nappearance in numerous troops every two or three years, and disperse \r\nthemselves abundantly in every house: as soon as this visitation \r\nis observed, it is customary to open all the apartments, and \r\nevery receptacle for stores; they enter every where, and in a \r\nshort time it is found that they have exterminated as effectually \r\nthe rats, mice, bugs, kakerles (a sort of insect that gives great \r\nannoyance in hot countries);—in a word, all the different animals \r\noffensive or injurious to man, as if sent on a special mission \r\nto remedy the evils these occasion. They do no injury to man, \r\nunless they find in him an enemy, who pursues and disturbs their \r\nquiet; in which case they attack his shoes so violently, that \r\nthey are destroyed with incredible rapidity. On the other hand, \r\nthey cause terrible devastations in plantations of trees, of \r\nwhich they will entirely strip the leaves in a single night: \r\nsome of the ants crawl up and separate them from the tree, and \r\nthen throw them down to their fellow-labourers, who are in waiting \r\nto receive and carry the leaves to the ant house. This curious \r\nspecies does not build its house above ground, but they dig holes, \r\nsometimes not less than eight feet in depth, and plaster the walls \r\naccording to the rules of the art of masonry[9]. Some travellers \r\nassert that one of the islands of the South Sea is infested by \r\nthem to such a degree, that human beings cannot venture to disembark \r\nin it. The place is therefore, as it were, yielded to them, and \r\nis known to mariners by the name of Ant-island.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—And has no means been found to stop the progress of \r\ntheir devastations?\r\n\r\n_Father._—As to what in this respect relates to the ant-island, \r\nI am not able to answer your question. In Europe, fortunately \r\nfor the inhabitants, they are not so formidable: they however \r\noccasion sufficient inconvenience to make us study by what means \r\nwe can best destroy them; and the surest methods are found to \r\nbe fire and boiling-water. They have, besides, numerous enemies among \r\ninsects and birds: the most terrible of all is the _myrmecophage_, \r\nor great ant-eater. Nature, who no doubt intended in this animal \r\nto produce a counterpoise against the abundant increase of ants, \r\nfurnished it with a long gluey tongue, which it drops into the \r\nholes of the ant-house: the ants crawl upon it, and remain fixed. \r\nWhen the tongue is sufficiently covered with them, the ant-eater \r\ndraws it back, swallows its mouthful greedily, and drops it again \r\nwith the same success. It is pretended, that two ant-eaters hostilely \r\nengaged against an ant-house, will destroy every inhabitant in \r\na short time. They raise small channels of light sand in the \r\nants’ road, which the creatures in passing, fall entirely through, \r\nand are received by the enemy, who swallows them in an instant. \r\nDifferent savage nations, the Hottentots in particular, also \r\ndevour ants by handfuls.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—What a frightful idea! I can scarcely believe the account, \r\nfather: but this is enough on the chapter of ants. You mentioned \r\njust now, that in each class of the animal creation there were \r\nsome individuals to be found which formed themselves into societies; \r\npray tell me which they are.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I know of no instance among birds, but that we have \r\njust been witnessing; but among quadrupeds there is at least \r\none striking example of the social principle:—try to recollect \r\nit yourself.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—It is perhaps the elephant or the sea-otter?\r\n\r\n_Father._—You have not guessed the one I thought of: in reality, \r\nhowever, the animals you have named discover also a strong \r\ndisposition to live in society with their species, but they build \r\nnothing like a common house of reception:—try again; when you \r\nmentioned the sea-otter, you were not far from the right creature.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Ah, now I have found it: is it not the beaver, father? \r\nThese animals are said to possess so much intelligence, that \r\nthey are able to contrive and place dams to such streams or rivers \r\nas obstruct their design of building entire villages: by this \r\noperation they are furnished with a sort of ditch, which they \r\nuse for their purpose.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is well observed; and, strictly speaking, the \r\nmarmoset also may be included in the number of sociable quadrupeds: \r\nbut these latter cannot be said to build, in the literal sense \r\nof the word; they dig themselves a common place of abode, a sort \r\nof cavern, in the mountains, and in these whole families of them \r\npass the winter comfortably, in a continual sleep. It would have \r\nbeen more blameable in us to have forgotten them, as they are \r\nnatives of our country; for it is principally in the highest \r\nAlps of Switzerland that the animal is found.\r\n\r\nWe had proceeded a considerable way in this kind of conversation, \r\nand had reached a wood, the trees of which were unknown to us: \r\nthey in a small degree resembled the wild fig-tree; at least \r\nthe fruit they bore, like the fig, was round in form, and contained \r\na soft juicy substance full of small grains: there was, however, \r\na sharpness and sourness in the taste. We took a nearer view \r\nof these trees, so remarkable for their height, which was from \r\nforty to sixty feet: the bark of the trunk was prickly or scaly, \r\nlike the pine-apple, and wholly bare of branches, except at the \r\nvery top, where they are loaded with them; some growing straight, \r\nand others bent in different directions. The leaves of these trees, \r\nat the extremity of the branches, are very thick; in substance, \r\ntough, like leather; and their upper and under surfaces presented \r\ndifferent tints. But what surprised us the most, was a kind of \r\ngum, or bituminous matter, which appeared by some accidental \r\nmeans to issue in a liquid state from the trunk of the tree, \r\nand to become immediately hardened by the air. This discovery \r\nawakened Fritz’s whole attention: in Europe he had often made \r\nuse of the gum produced by cherry-trees, either as a cement or \r\nvarnish in the process of some of his youthful occupations; and \r\nthe thought struck him, that he could do the same with what he \r\nnow saw. He accordingly collected with his knife a certain quantity.\r\n\r\nAs we continued walking, he looked frequently at his gum, which \r\nhe tried to soften with his breath, or with the heat of his hand, \r\nas he had been accustomed to do with that from the cherry-trees; \r\nbut he found he could not succeed. On the other hand, his endeavours \r\nrevealed a still more singular property in the substance, that \r\nof stretching considerably on being pulled by the two hands at \r\nits extremities; and, on letting go, of reducing itself instantly, \r\nby the power of an elastic principle. He was struck with surprise \r\nat this phenomenon, and sprang towards me, repeating the experiment \r\nbefore my eyes, and exclaiming, Look, father! if this is not \r\nthe very kind of Indian rubber we formerly used, to rub out the \r\nbad strokes in our drawings: see! I can stretch it, and it instantly \r\nshrinks back when I let go.\r\n\r\nAh! what do you tell me? cried I with joy: such a discovery would \r\nbe an invaluable benefit. The best thanks of all will be due \r\nto you, if you have discovered the true _caoutchouc_ tree which \r\nyields the Indian rubber. Quick, hand it here, that I may examine \r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Look, father, how it will stretch! But I do not however \r\nunderstand how it can be so immensely valuable to us: can it \r\nbe made to serve any other purpose than rubbing out a pencil \r\nmark? Nor am I quite sure that it is the very same ingredient. \r\nWhy is it not black, like that we used in Europe?\r\n\r\n_Father._—How many questions you ask at once! But give me time \r\nto breathe, and I will answer them. Caoutchouc is a kind of milky \r\nsap, which runs from certain trees, and no doubt from these before \r\nus, in consequence of incisions made in the bark. This liquor \r\nis received in vessels placed expressly for the purpose: it is \r\nafterwards made to take the form of dark-coloured bottles of \r\ndifferent sizes, such as we have seen them, in the following \r\nmanner. Before the liquor which runs out has time to coagulate, \r\nsome small earthen bottles are dipped into it a sufficient number \r\nof times to form the thickness required. These vessels are then \r\nhung over smoke, which completely dries them, and gives the dark \r\ncolour you allude to. Before they are entirely dry, a knife is \r\ndrawn across them, which produces the lines or figures with which \r\nyou have seen them marked. The concluding part of the operation \r\nis to break the bottle, which has served for a mould, and to \r\nget out the pieces by the passage of the neck, when the ingredient \r\nremains in the complete form of a bottle; soft to the touch, \r\nfirm in substance, yet flexible and convenient to carry about, \r\nfrom being not subject to break; and may be even used as a vessel \r\nto contain liquor if necessary. In later times it has been discovered \r\nthat this remarkable substance would extract the mark of black \r\nlead from paper; and it is common for artists to cut them into \r\npieces, and to be generally provided with one of them.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—The fabrication of this article seems simple enough; \r\ntherefore let us try to make some bottles of it, father, which \r\nwill be convenient for carrying something for us to drink, when \r\nwe go a long way in pursuit of game. But still I do not perceive \r\nhow the discovery is, as you say, of so much value to us?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Not by this use of it alone, certainly; but its quality \r\nis admirable for being made into shoes and boots without seams, \r\nif we can add the assistance of earthen moulds of the size of \r\nthe leg or foot to be fitted. Now then I suppose you can understand \r\nmy reason for the joy I expressed at the sight of so unexpected \r\na benefit. We must consider of some means of restoring masses \r\nof the caoutchouc to its liquid form, for spreading upon the \r\nmoulds; and if we should not succeed, we must endeavour to draw \r\nit in sufficient quantities, when wanted for use and in its liquid \r\nstate, from the trees themselves. There is besides another use \r\nfor which this substance is both fit and excellent;—that of rendering \r\nwater-proof any kind of linen or woollen production to which \r\nit may be applied.\r\n\r\nWell satisfied with the discovery we had made, and our fancy \r\nalready heated by the image of our fine India rubber boots and \r\nshoes[10], we continued our way, endeavouring still further to \r\nexplore the wood, which stretched before us to a considerable \r\ndistance. After passing through it, we reached another called \r\nCœos, with a small part of the skirts of which we were already \r\nacquainted, it being the same which stretches from the sea shore \r\nto the top of the rocks. There we rested ourselves with great \r\npleasure for a few minutes, and were regaled with two cocoa-nuts, \r\nwhich Turk had forced from two little monkeys which were playing \r\non the ground like children. Upon the loss of their food they \r\nleft him and scampered to the top of the trees, while we on our \r\nparts devoured the booty. After this refreshment, we once more \r\nresumed our route; we were determined to reach the furthest outlet \r\nof this great wood of cocoa-trees, to examine the dimensions and \r\nlimits of our empire: in a short time we had taken some observations \r\nthat enabled us to ascertain this point; and looking attentively, \r\nwe recognised the great bay on the right, and on the left Cape \r\nDisappointment, which latter had been the furthest point of our \r\nearliest excursion.\r\n\r\nIn this spot alone, and mixed with a quantity of cocoa-trees, \r\nI discovered a sort of tree of smaller growth which I presumed \r\nmust be the sago palm: one of these had been thrown down by the \r\nwind, so that I was able to examine it thoroughly. I perceived \r\nthat the trunk of it contained a considerable quantity of a mealy \r\nsubstance; I therefore, with my hatchet laid it open long-ways, \r\nand cleared it of the whole contents; and on tasting the ingredient, \r\nI found it was exactly like the sago I had often eaten in Europe[11]. \r\nThe operation of cutting the trunk had disclosed also a new treasure, \r\nand one which confirmed my belief of having found the real sago \r\npalm-tree; it was the perceiving in the powder, the particular \r\nkind of larva which lives entirely on sago, and is considered \r\nthe greatest delicacy of the West Indies for the palate. The \r\ninterest I felt on the subject, made me eager for an experiment \r\nwhich would immediately determine my conclusion. I directed Fritz \r\nto get some dry branches and make a fire; I ran a sharp stick \r\nthrough half a dozen of the larvae, and toasted them on the flame; \r\nthe agreeable odour which exhaled from them, and is peculiar \r\nto the species, made me certain I was not mistaken: I soon ate \r\none or two of them with a potatoe, which served for bread, and \r\nI may venture to assure the epicures of Europe, that if they \r\ndesire to obtain a delicious morsel, this alone is worth the \r\npains of a sea-voyage for the purpose. Fritz, who from the first \r\nhad taken the liberty to smile at my fancy, and to assure me \r\nthat nothing in the world should induce him to partake of my \r\ndish, attracted by the delicious smell and good appearance of \r\nthe food, had no longer the power to desist: he asked me to give \r\nhim a small share, and joined me in a chorus of the highest praise. \r\nIt was now his turn to search for more, and to use the same ceremony \r\nin dressing them.\r\n\r\nAfter our repast, we got up and began to consider how much further \r\nwe would go: the thick bushes of bamboo, through which it was \r\nimpossible to pass, seemed to furnish a natural conclusion to \r\nour journey. We were therefore unable to ascertain whether we \r\nshould or should not have found a passage beyond the wall of \r\nrocks: we perceived then no better resource than to turn to the \r\nleft towards Cape Disappointment, where the luxurious plantations \r\nof sugar-canes we had discovered on our first visit, now again \r\ndrew our attention. That we might not return empty-handed to \r\nFalcon’s Stream, and might deserve forgiveness for so long an \r\nabsence, we each took the pains to cut a large bundle of the \r\ncanes, which we threw across the ass’s back, not forgetting the \r\nceremony of reserving one apiece to refresh ourselves with along \r\nthe road. We soon arrived on the well-known shore of the sea, \r\nwhich at length afforded us an open and shorter path; we next, \r\nand not long after, reached the wood of gourds, where we found \r\nour sledge loaded as we had left it the night before: we took \r\nthe sugar-canes from the ass, and fastened them to the sledge, \r\nand then we harnessed the ass, and the patient animal began to \r\ndraw towards home.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Falcon’s Stream without any further adventure, \r\nand rather early in the evening. We received at first some kind \r\nreproofs; we were next questioned, and lastly thanked, as we \r\ndisplayed our various treasures, but particularly the sugar-canes: \r\neach of the boys seized one and began to suck it, as did their \r\nmother also. Nothing could be more amusing than to hear Fritz \r\nrelate, with unaffected interest, the recent discoveries we had \r\nmade, and imitate the gestures of the heath-cock as he held it \r\nup for them to examine:—the whole company continued to shout \r\nwith laughter for many minutes. Then came the history of the \r\ncolony of birds and their singular habitation, and of the green \r\nparrot, all of which was listened to with the delight excited \r\nby a fairy tale. Fritz showed them the handsome red parrot dead, \r\nalso the great blue jay, both of which they did not cease to \r\nadmire; but when Fritz took out of his waistcoat pocket the little \r\nparrot all alive, there was no bounds to their ecstasy: they \r\njumped about like mad things, and I was obliged to interpose \r\nmy authority to prevent their tearing him to pieces, in the struggle \r\nwho should have him first. Francis asked his eldest brother if \r\nhe had not already taught him some words in their way home? I \r\nintended the office of preceptor for you, said Fritz, who are \r\nsuch a little prate-apace that the parrot would not be long in \r\nlearning. Francis nearly devoured the little animal with kisses, \r\nrepeating a thousand times _pretty little parrot!_ At length \r\nthe bird was fastened by the leg to one of the roots of the trees, \r\ntill a cage could be made for him; and was fed with acorns, which \r\nhe appeared exceedingly to relish. We next gave an account of \r\nthe excellent dinner we had made on the larvæ found in the sago-meal, \r\nwhich excited the envy of all but my wife, who was never partial \r\nto new kinds of food. I therefore promised her for her share \r\nof so many dainties, some real mushrooms which grew spontaneously \r\nfrom the powder of the sago. She was delighted with the prospect \r\nof the candles I assured her I was now able to furnish, and also \r\nof the boots and shoes. Fritz took a bit of the rubber from his \r\npocket and drew it to its full length, and then let it suddenly \r\ngo, to the great amusement of little Francis.\r\n\r\nSoon after night fall, being much fatigued, and after partaking \r\nof a hearty supper, we all mounted the ladder; and having carefully \r\ndrawn it up, we fell exhausted, into sound and peaceful slumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. \r\n\r\n_Useful occupations and labours.—Embellishments; a painful but \r\nnatural sentiment._\r\n\r\nOn the following day, neither my wife nor the boys left me a \r\nmoment’s tranquillity till I had put my manufactory of candles \r\nin some forwardness: I therefore set myself to recollect all \r\nI had read on the subject. I soon perceived that I should be \r\nat a loss for a little suet or mutton fat to mix with the wax \r\nI had procured from the berries, for making the light burn clearer; \r\nbut as I had neither of these articles, I was compelled to proceed \r\nwithout them. I put as many berries into a vessel as it would \r\ncontain, and set it on a moderate fire; my wife in the mean time \r\nemployed herself in making some wicks with the threads of sail-cloth. \r\nWhen we saw an oily matter of a pleasing smell and light green \r\ncolour, rise to the top of the liquid the berries had yielded, \r\nwe carefully skimmed it off and put it into a separate vessel, \r\ntaking care to keep it warm. We continued this process till the \r\nberries were exhausted and had produced a considerable quantity \r\nof wax; we next dipped the wicks one by one into it, while it \r\nremained liquid, and then hung them on the bushes to harden: \r\nin a short time, we dipped them again, and continued repeating \r\nthe operation, till the candles were increased to the proper \r\nsize, and they were then put in a place and kept, till sufficiently \r\nhardened for use. We, however, were all eager to judge of our \r\nsuccess that very evening, by burning one of the candles, with \r\nwhich we were all well satisfied. In consequence of this new \r\ntreasure, we should now be able to sit up later, and consequently \r\nspend less of our time in sleep; but independently of this advantage, \r\nthe mere sight of a candle, which for so long a time we had been \r\ndeprived of, caused ecstasies of joy to all.\r\n\r\nOur success in this last enterprise, encouraged us to think of \r\nanother, the idea of which had long been cherished by our kind \r\nsteward of provisions: it was, to make fresh butter of the cream \r\nwe every day skimmed from the milk, and which was frequently, \r\nto her great vexation, spoiled, and given to the animals for \r\nwant of such a process. The utensil we stood in need of, was \r\na churn, to turn the cream in. Having earnestly applied my thoughts, \r\nas to the most effectual manner of conquering the difficulty, \r\nI suddenly recollected what I had read in a book of travels, \r\nof the method used by the Hottentots for making butter; but in \r\nadopting it, I determined to introduce one feature of proceeding, \r\nfor which, apparently, they have not a partiality; and this was, \r\nthe utmost attention to cleanliness. Instead of a sheep-skin \r\nsewed together at its extremities, I emptied a large gourd of \r\nits natural contents, and filled it again with cream, and stopped \r\nit quite close with the piece I had cut from the top. I placed \r\nmy vase of cream on a piece of coarse linen cloth with four corners, \r\nwhich last I tied to four stakes; I placed one boy midway between \r\neach stake, and directed them to shake the linen briskly, but \r\nwith a steady measure, for a certain time. This exercise, which \r\nseemed like children’s play, pleased them mightily, and they \r\ncalled it rocking the cradle. They performed their office singing \r\nand laughing all the time, and in an hour, on taking off the \r\ncover, we had the satisfaction of seeing some excellent butter. \r\nWe heartily congratulated each other, and praised the workmen, \r\nwho by their constancy of labour, had thus produced one of the \r\nfirst conveniences in the list of articles for food.\r\n\r\nThe employments we had thus been engaged in, were little different \r\nfrom play; but now a question occurred of one that would require \r\nour most serious attention:—it was the constructing a cart, in \r\nall its forms, for the better conveyance of our effects from \r\nplace to place, instead of the sledge which caused us so much \r\nfatigue to load and draw. Many reasons induced me to confine \r\nmy attempt in the first instance to a two-wheel cart, and to \r\nobserve the result before I ventured on one with four wheels.\r\n\r\nI will not fatigue the reader with the detail of my undertaking: \r\nI tried earnestly and long to accomplish my machine; but it did \r\nnot entirely succeed to my wishes, and I wasted in the attempt \r\nboth time and timber. I however produced what from courtesy we \r\ncalled a cart; but I would not advise my readers to take it for \r\na model, though, to say the truth, to us it answered the purpose \r\nfor which it was designed.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus laboriously engaged, the boys and their mother \r\nwere no less busy in matters of use or convenience; and I now \r\nand then left my cart to assist them with my advice, though, \r\nto do them justice, I must say, they seldom stood in need of \r\nit. They undertook to transplant the greatest part of the European \r\nfruit-trees, to place them where they would be in a better situation \r\nfor growth, according to the properties of each. They planted \r\nvine shoots round the roots of the magnificent tree we inhabited, \r\nand round the trunks of some other kinds of trees which grew \r\nnear; and we watched them in the fond anticipation that they \r\nwould in time ascend to a height capable of being formed into \r\na sort of trellis, and help to cool us by their shade. In the \r\nclimate we inhabited, the vine requires the protection of the \r\nlarger trees against the scorching rays of the sun. Lastly, we \r\nplanted two parallel lines of saplings, consisting of chesnut, \r\ncherry, and the common nut-trees, to form an avenue from Family \r\nBridge to Falcon’s Stream, which would hereafter afford us a \r\ncool shade in our walks to Tent House. This last undertaking \r\nwas not to be effected without a degree of labour and fatigue \r\nthe most discouraging:—the ground was to be cleared of every \r\nthing it had produced, and a certain breadth covered with sand, \r\nleft higher in the middle than on the sides, for the sake of \r\nbeing always dry. The boys fetched the sand from the sea-side \r\nin their wheel-barrows, and I also nailed together a few pieces \r\nof wood, in the form of a tub, which could be harnessed to the \r\nass to ease in some measure their fatigue.\r\n\r\nOur next concern was to introduce, if possible, some shade and \r\nother improvements on the barren site of Tent House, and to render \r\nour occasional abode or visits there more secure. We began by \r\nplanting in a quincunx all those sorts of trees that thrive best in \r\nthe sun, such as lemon, pistachio, almond, mulberry, and lime-trees; \r\nlastly, some of a kind of orange-tree which attains to a prodigious \r\nsize, and bears a fruit as large as the head of a child[12], \r\nand weighs not less than twelve or fourteen pounds. The commoner \r\nsorts of nut-trees we placed along the shore in the most favourable \r\nsituations. The better to conceal and fortify our tent, which \r\ninclosed all our stores, we formed on the accessible side, a \r\nhedge of wild orange and lemon-trees, which produce an abundant \r\nprickly foliage; and to add to the agreeableness of their appearance, \r\nwe introduced here and there the pomegranate; nor did I omit \r\nto make a little arbour of the guava shrub, which is easily raised \r\nfrom slips, and bears a small fruit rather pleasant to the taste. \r\nWe also took care to introduce at proper places a certain number \r\nof the largest sorts of trees, which in time would serve the \r\ndouble purpose of shading annual plants, and, with benches placed \r\nunder them, of a kind of private cabinet. Should any accident \r\nor alarm compel us to retire to the fortress of Tent-House, a \r\nthing of the first importance would be to find there sufficient \r\nfood for our cattle. For the greater security, I formed a plantation \r\nof the thorny fig-tree, of sufficient breadth to occupy the space \r\nbetween our fortress and the river, thus rendering it difficult \r\nfor an enemy to approach.\r\n\r\nThe curving form of the river having left some partial elevations \r\nof the soil within the inclosure, I found means to work them \r\ninto slopes and angles so as to serve as bastions to our two \r\ncannon from the pinnace and our other fire-arms, should we ever \r\nbe attacked by savages. When this was all complete, we perceived \r\nthat one thing more was wanting, which was to make such alterations \r\nin Family Bridge as would enable us to use it as a drawbridge \r\nor to take it away entirely, this being the only point at which \r\nthe passage of the river could be easily effected. But as we \r\ncould not do all at once, we contented ourselves, for present \r\nsafety, with taking away the first planks of the bridge at each \r\nend every time we passed it. My concluding labour was to plant \r\nsome cedars along the usual landing-places, to which we might \r\nfasten our vessels.\r\n\r\nWe employed six whole weeks in effecting what for the present \r\nit was possible to effect, of these laborious arrangements; but \r\nthe continual exercise of mind and body they imposed, visibly \r\ncontributed to the physical and moral health of the boys, and \r\nto the support of cheerfulness and serenity in ourselves. The \r\nmore we embellished our abode by the work of our own hands, the \r\nmore it became dear to our hearts. The constant and strict observance \r\nof the sabbath-day afforded such an interval of rest, as could \r\nnot fail to restore our strength; and inspire us with the desire \r\nof new exertions. The sentiment of gratitude which filled our \r\nminds towards the Supreme Being, who had saved us from destruction \r\nand supplied us with all things needful, demanded utterance, \r\nand on Sundays we might allow ourselves the indulgence of pouring \r\nout our hearts in thankfulness. Thus our religious exercises, \r\nsucceeded by gymnastic recreations, and these again by pleasing \r\nrambles near Falcon’s Stream, during which I did not fail to \r\ninculcate some moral truth, served to increase at once, our \r\nusefulness and our happiness. It was deserving of remark, that though \r\nthe boys had been employed in severe labour through the week, yet \r\nthey were ever ready to encounter the climbing of trees, running \r\nraces, swimming, shooting with the bow and arrow, when Sunday \r\ncame; a proof that it is not so much inaction which renews the \r\nstrength, as a change of occupations.\r\n\r\nBut the repetition of these exercises wore out our clothes so \r\nfast, that another trip to the vessel was absolutely necessary. \r\nWe had nearly exhausted the stock we had already brought away; \r\nwe were now absolutely in rags, and we feared we saw the time \r\nwhen we should be compelled to renounce the European modes of \r\ndress. I had also another reason; the cart I had just completed, \r\nand with which at first I was quite enchanted on further acquaintance \r\ndisclosed a defect which it was scarcely possible to endure; \r\nit was a violent creaking of the wheels at every turn, and in \r\naddition the wheels moved so imperfectly round the axle-tree, \r\nthat the united strength of the ass and the cow could scarcely \r\ndrag the machine along. It was in vain that, in spite of my wife’s \r\nreproofs, I applied a little butter now and then; in an hour \r\nor two the butter was dried, and the wheels remained the same.\r\n\r\nThese two circumstances compelled us then once more to have recourse \r\nto the vessel, which heaven and the waves had still preserved. \r\nWe knew there remained on board five or six chests containing \r\napparel, and we suspected there were also some tubs of pitch \r\nand grease for wheels in her hold, which we should thus obtain. \r\nTo these motives were added, that of an earnest desire to take \r\nanother look at her, and, if practicable, to bring away a few \r\npieces of cannon which might be fixed on the new bastions at \r\nTent House, and thus we should be prepared for the worst.\r\n\r\nThe first fine day I assembled my three eldest sons, and put \r\nmy design into execution. We reached the wreck without any striking \r\nadventure, and found her still fixed between the rocks, but somewhat \r\nmore shattered than when we had last seen her. We did not lose \r\na moment in searching for the tubs of pitch, which, with the \r\nhelp of the pulley, we soon conveyed into the pinnace; we next \r\nsecured the chests of clothes, and whatever remained of ammunition \r\nstores; powder, shot, and even such pieces of cannon as we could \r\nremove, while those that were too heavy, we stripped of their \r\nwheels, which might be extremely useful.\r\n\r\nBut to effect our purpose, it was necessary to spend several \r\ndays in visits to the vessel, returning constantly in the evening, \r\nenriched with every thing of a portable nature which the wreck \r\ncontained; doors, windows, locks, bolts, nothing escaped our \r\ngrasp: so that the ship was now entirely emptied, with the exception \r\nof the heavy cannon and three or four immense copper caldrons, \r\nwhich were too heavy to be got into the boat. We by degrees contrived \r\nto tie these heavy articles to two or three empty casks well \r\npitched, which would effectually sustain themselves and the cannon \r\nabove water. When these measures were taken, I came to the resolution \r\nof blowing up the wreck by a process similar to that with which \r\nI had so well succeeded with the pinnace. I directed my views \r\nto that part of the vessel which had been entirely stripped of \r\nevery thing; I supposed that the wind and tide would convey the \r\nbeams and timbers ashore, and thus with little pains we should \r\nbe possessed of a sufficient quantity of materials for erecting \r\na building at some future time.\r\n\r\nWe accordingly prepared a cask of gunpowder, which we left on \r\nboard for the purpose: we rolled it to the place most favourable \r\nfor our views: we made a small opening in its side, and at the \r\nmoment of quitting the vessel, we inserted a piece of match-wood \r\nwhich we lighted at the last moment, as before. We then sailed \r\nwith all possible expedition for Safety Bay, where we arrived \r\nin a short time. We could not, however, withdraw our thoughts \r\nfrom the wreck and from the expected explosion for a single moment. \r\nI had cut the match a sufficient length for us to hope that she \r\nwould not go to pieces before dark. I proposed to my wife to \r\nhave our supper carried to a little point of land from whence \r\nwe had a view of her, and here we waited for the moment of her \r\ndestruction with lively impatience.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of night-fall, a majestic rolling sound like thunder, \r\naccompanied by a column of fire and smoke, announced that the \r\nship, so awfully concerned with our peculiar destiny, which had \r\nbrought us to our present abode in a desert, and furnished us \r\nthere with such vast supplies for general comfort, was that instant \r\nannihilated, and withdrawn for ever from the face of man!—At \r\nthis moment, love for the country that gave us birth, that most \r\npowerful sentiment of the human heart, sunk with a new force \r\ninto ours. The ship had disappeared for ever! Could we then form \r\na hope ever to behold that country more! We had made a sort of \r\njubilee of witnessing the spectacle; the boys had clapped their \r\nhands and skipped about in joyful expectation; but the noise \r\nwas heard;—the smoke and sparks were seen while the sudden change \r\nwhich took place in our minds could be compared only to the rapidity \r\nof these effects of our concerted scheme against the vessel. \r\nWe all observed a mournful silence, and all rose, as it were, \r\nby an impulse of mutual condemnation, and with our heads sinking \r\non our bosoms, and our eyes cast upon the ground, we took the \r\nroad to Tent House.\r\n\r\nMy wife was the only person who was sensible of motives for consolation \r\nin the distressing scene which had been passing; she was now \r\nrelieved from all the cruel fears for our safety in our visits \r\nto a shattered wreck, that was liable to fall to pieces during \r\nthe time we were on board. From this moment she conceived a stronger \r\npartiality for our island, and the modes of life we had adopted. \r\nA night’s repose had in some measure relieved the melancholy \r\nof the preceding evening, and I went rather early in the morning \r\nwith the boys, to make further observations as to the effects \r\nof this remarkable event. We perceived in the water, and along \r\nthe shore, abundant vestiges of the departed wreck, and among \r\nthe rest, at a certain distance, the empty casks, caldrons, and \r\ncannon, all tied together, and floating in a large mass upon \r\nthe water. We jumped instantly into the pinnace, with the tub-boat \r\nfastened to it, and made a way towards them through the numberless \r\npieces of timber, &c., that intervened, and in a little time \r\nreached the object of our search, which from its great weight \r\nmoved slowly upon the waves. Fritz with his accustomed readiness \r\nflung some rope round two four-pounders, and contrived to fasten \r\nthem to our barge, after which he secured also an enormous quantity \r\nof poles, laths, and other useful articles. With this rich booty \r\nwe returned to land.\r\n\r\nWe performed three more trips for the purpose of bringing away \r\nmore cannon, caldrons, fragments of masts, &c., all of which \r\nwe deposited for present convenience in Safety Bay: and now began \r\nour most fatiguing operations, the removing such numerous and \r\nheavy stores from the boats to Tent House. We separated the cannon \r\nand the caldrons from the tub-raft, and from each other, and \r\nleft them in a place which was accessible for the sledge and \r\nthe beasts of burden. With the help of the crow we succeeded \r\nin getting the caldrons upon the sledge, and in replacing the \r\nfour wheels we had before taken from the cannon; and now found \r\nit easy to make the cow and the ass draw them. We in the same \r\nmanner conveyed away all the pieces of wood we wished to preserve \r\ndry, and what stores remained, we tied with cords to stakes along \r\nthe shore, to protect them from the tide.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the boilers or copper caldrons, which had been \r\nintended as principal utensils for a proposed manufactory of \r\nsugar, we now found of the most essential use. We brought out \r\nall our barrels of gunpowder, and placed them on their ends in \r\nthree separate groups, at a short distance from our tent; we \r\ndug a little ditch round the whole, to draw off the moisture \r\nfrom the ground, and then put one of the caldrons turned upside down \r\nupon each, which completely answered the purpose of an out-house. \r\nThe cannon were covered with sail-cloth, and upon this we laid \r\nheavy branches of trees; the larger casks of gunpowder we prudently \r\nremoved under a projecting piece of rock, where, should they \r\neven blow up, no mischief could arise to the inhabitants of Tent \r\nHouse: these we covered with planks, till we should have leisure \r\nfor executing the plan of an ammunition storehouse, about which \r\nwe had all become extremely earnest.\r\n\r\nMy wife, in taking a survey of these our labours, made the agreeable \r\ndiscovery that two of our ducks and one of the geese had been \r\nbrooding under a large bush, and at the time were conducting \r\ntheir little families to the water. The news produced general \r\nrejoicings; Fritz and Ernest looked forward to some luxurious \r\nSunday-dinners, and Jack and Francis wondered what the young \r\nbirds could think, when they first saw any human creatures! We in \r\na short time found means to tame them, by throwing them occasionally \r\nsome crumbs of manioc. This last employment, together with the \r\ngambols of the little creatures, so forcibly carried our thoughts \r\nto Falcon’s Stream, that we all conceived the ardent desire of \r\nreturning to the society of the numerous old friends we had left \r\nthere. One sighed for his monkey, another for his flamingo; Francis \r\nfor his parrot, and his mother for her poultry-yard, her various \r\nhousewifery accommodations, and her comfortable bed. We therefore \r\nfixed the next day for our departure, and set about the necessary \r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. \r\n\r\n_A new excursion.—Palm-tree wine._\r\n\r\nOn entering our new plantation of fruit-trees forming the avenue \r\nto Falcon’s Stream, we observed that they had not a vigorous \r\nappearance, and that they inclined to curve a little in the stalk: \r\nwe therefore immediately resolved to support them with sticks, \r\nand I proposed a walk to the vicinity of Cape Disappointment, \r\nfor the purpose of cutting some bamboos. I had no sooner pronounced \r\nthe words, than the three eldest boys and their mother exclaimed \r\nat once that they would accompany me. Their curiosity had been \r\nexcited by the accounts Fritz and I had given of the variety \r\nof amusing objects we had met with in our visit to the spot: \r\neach found a sound and special reason why he must not fail to \r\nbe of the party:—one of the hens was observed to be brooding, \r\nand some of the eggs of the heath-fowl were to be fetched and \r\nlaid under her;—our provision of candles was nearly exhausted, \r\nand a new stock of berries must therefore be procured, for my \r\nwife now repaired our clothes by candle-light, while I employed \r\nmyself in composing a journal of the events of every day:—Then, \r\nthe sow had again deserted us, and nothing could be so probable \r\nas that we should find her in the acorn wood:—Jack would fain \r\ngather some guavas for himself, and Francis must needs see the \r\nsugar-canes he sucked with so keen a relish. In short, all would \r\nvisit this land of Canaan.\r\n\r\nWe accordingly fixed the following morning, and set out in full \r\nprocession. For myself, I had a great desire to explore with \r\nmore attention this part of our island, and to reap some more \r\nsubstantial advantages from its produce. I therefore made some \r\npreparations for sleeping, should we find the day too short for \r\nall we might have to accomplish: I took the cart instead of the \r\nsledge, having fixed some planks across it for Francis and his \r\nmother to sit upon when they should be tired; I was careful to \r\nbe provided with the different implements we might want, some \r\nrope machinery I had contrived for rendering the climbing of \r\ntrees more easy, since we could not always expect to meet with \r\na crab who should obligingly give us his assistance; and lastly, \r\nsome provisions, consisting of a piece of the salted tortoise, \r\nsome water in a gourd-flask, and one bottle of wine from the \r\ncaptain’s store. When all was placed in the cart, I for this \r\ntime harnessed to it both the ass and the cow, as I expected \r\nthe load would be increased on our return; and we set out, taking \r\nthe road of the potatoe and manioc plantations. Our first halt \r\nwas at the tree of the colony of birds; close upon the same spot \r\nwere also the trees whose berries produced the wax for candles, \r\nand intermixed with these some of the guava kind. On this second \r\noccasion of seeing the birds, I recollected to what species they \r\nbelonged, which by naturalists is named _Loxia gregaria_ (Sociable \r\nGrossbeak).\r\n\r\nIt was not without much difficulty that we conducted the cart \r\nthrough the thick entangled bushes, the most intricate of which \r\nI every where cut down, and we helped to push it along with all \r\nour strength. We succeeded tolerably well at last; and that the \r\npoor animals might have time to rest, we determined to pass several \r\nhours in this place which furnished such a variety of agreeable \r\nand useful objects. We began by gathering a bag full of the guavas; \r\nand after regaling ourselves plentifully upon them, we put the \r\nremainder into the cart. We next examined anew, and with close \r\nattention, the interesting structure of the nest inhabited by \r\nthe colony of birds, and concluded, contrary to the opinion I \r\nhad formerly entertained, that the little green parrot was an \r\ninvader who had seized upon an empty place, and fixed himself \r\nin it; for numerous flocks of the brown-coloured birds now passed \r\nin and out, rested upon the bushes which produced the wax, and \r\ndevoured large quantities of the berries, which explained the \r\nreason of their building their singularly-contrived abode in \r\nthis particular spot. We claimed the same privilege as the birds, \r\nand had soon filled another bag with the berries we found means \r\nto beat down from the bushes. Seeing them so greedily consumed \r\nby those little animals, the boys desired to follow their example, \r\nand accordingly tasted them, but found them too insipid for their \r\npalate.\r\n\r\nWe had brought the monkey with us to search out the nests of \r\nthe heath-fowl, that we might seize upon the eggs; but we postponed \r\nthe setting him on this employment till we should again reach \r\nthe place on our way back, for fear of breaking the eggs in carrying. \r\nWe continued our way, and soon arrived at the caoutchouc, or \r\ngum-elastic trees: I thought we could not do better than to make \r\na halt here, and endeavour to collect a sufficient quantity of the \r\nsap, to make the different kinds of utensils, and the impenetrable \r\nboots and shoes, as I had before proposed. It was with this design \r\nthat I had taken care to bring with me several of the most capacious \r\nof the gourd rinds. I made deep incisions in the trunks, and \r\nfixed some large leaves of trees partly doubled together lengthways, \r\nto the place, to serve as a sort of channel to conduct the sap \r\nto the vessels I had kept in readiness to receive it. We had \r\nnot long begun this process before we perceived the sap begin \r\nto run out as white as milk, and in large drops, so that we were \r\nnot without hopes by the time of our return to find the vessels \r\nfull, and thus to have obtained a sufficient quantity of the \r\ningredient for a first experiment.\r\n\r\nWe left the sap running, and pursued our way, which led us to \r\nthe wood of cocoa-trees; from thence we passed to the left, and \r\nstopped half way between the bamboos and the sugar canes, intending \r\nto furnish ourselves with a provision of each. We aimed our course \r\nso judiciously, that on clearing the skirts of the wood we found \r\nourselves in an open plain, with the sugar-cane plantations on \r\nour left, and on our right those of bamboo interspersed with \r\nvarious kinds of palm-trees, and in front the magnificent bay \r\nformed by Cape Disappointment, which stretched far out into the \r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe prospect that now presented itself to our view was of such \r\nexquisite beauty, that we determined to choose it for our \r\nresting-place, and to make it the central point of every excursion we \r\nshould in future make: we were even more than half disposed to desert \r\nour pretty Falcon’s Stream, and transport our possessions hither: \r\na moment’s reflection, however, betrayed the folly of quitting \r\nthe thousand comforts we had there with almost incredible industry \r\nassembled: and we dismissed the thought with promising ourselves \r\nto include this ravishing spot ever more in our projects for \r\nexcursions. We disengaged the animals, that they might graze \r\nand refresh themselves under the shade of the palm-trees, and \r\nsat down to enjoy our own repast, and to converse on the beauty \r\nof the scene.\r\n\r\nOur next proceeding was to divide amongst us the different \r\noccupations which were the objects of our walk. Some scampered away \r\nto the right to cut bamboos; others to the left, to secure the \r\nsugar-canes, of both which a large bundle was collected, tied \r\ntogether, and put into the cart. The bodily exertions made by the \r\nboys again excited their desire to eat; they sucked some of the \r\ncanes, but their hunger was not appeased. Their mother, however, \r\nrefused to let them have the remainder of the provisions, and they \r\ntherefore cast a longing eye to the tops of the trees, where they saw \r\na great number of cocoa-nuts suspended. After a short deliberation, \r\nit was determined that two of them should venture on climbing \r\nto the top, a height of from sixty to eighty feet, and with the \r\nhatchet which would be fastened to his waist, should beat them \r\ndown. Fritz and Jack had no hesitation; they selected the trees \r\nwhich had most fruit for their attempt, and with my assistance \r\nthey proceeded a considerable way; but when left to themselves, \r\ntheir legs and arms were too short to embrace the trunk of the \r\ntree, and having no place of rest for either, they scampered \r\ndown again much quicker than they had ascended, chagrined and \r\nout of countenance. It was now my part to interfere: I wished, \r\nsaid I, to let you try for yourselves first; but though it may \r\nbe well to be possessed of personal courage, yet at your age, \r\nmy boys, it is advisable to distrust your own suggestions and \r\nto ask advice from persons of experience: had you applied for \r\nmine, I should have told you how impossible it would be for you \r\nto mount such a tree as this without assistance. It is true, \r\nvery young sailor-boys mount to the heads of masts, which are \r\nnearly as high; but then the mast is of small circumference, \r\nand the boys have, besides, the aid of ropes. I have something \r\nhere which may answer the same purpose;—here are some pieces \r\nof prepared shagreen, which must be tied round your legs; then \r\nwith this cord I shall fasten you by the body to the trunk of \r\nthe tree, but so loosely that it will move up and down when you \r\ndo; by sitting occasionally on this cord, you will be enabled \r\nto rest when necessary, and so push on by little and little. \r\nThis manner of climbing trees is practised by savages and by negro \r\nslaves with success. At first you will make but slow progress, but \r\nafter two or three experiments you will find no further difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe boys had listened with entire attention: excited by the \r\ndescription I had made, they eagerly demanded to be equipped for the \r\nexperiment, and their success exceeded our expectation; they with \r\ntolerable ease reached the top of the tree, where the thick tufted \r\nfoliage furnished a commodious seat, and from whence they sent forth \r\nexulting salutations. They now took their hatchets and set to \r\nwork, when presently a shower of cocoa-nuts descended, from which \r\nthe persons below had barely time to escape by running to a distance. \r\nThe monkey having observed what was going on, took the fancy \r\nof imitating his young masters, and springing from the ground \r\ninto one of the trees, he with his teeth and his paws sent down \r\nas many nuts as the hatchet: he then came down with equal swiftness, \r\nand seating himself on the ground began to crack one of the nuts, \r\nmaking all the time such strange grimaces as to occasion us all \r\nmuch merriment. The two boys had descended with more caution than \r\nthe monkey, and with perfect safety: they received our compliments \r\non the skill and address they had evinced in so promptly making \r\nthemselves masters of so valuable an art.\r\n\r\nErnest was the only person who took no part in this animated \r\nscene: his brothers began to banter him a little on the old subject \r\nof his indolence; they approached him gravely, and offered him \r\nsome cocoa-nut, _to refresh him after so much fatigue;_ he made \r\nno reply, and pushed the offering aside. He then rose from his \r\nseat, and began to examine the trees one by one with deep attention; \r\nhe requested me to saw off the top of a cocoa-nut for him, which \r\nhe emptied, and fastened round it cross-ways a string with a \r\nloop to hang it to the button of his waistcoat. Not one of us \r\ncould imagine what he was going to do; he placed a small hatchet \r\nin his girdle, and then advancing a few paces out of the group \r\nwe formed, he in a graceful manner pronounced the following little \r\naddress:\r\n\r\n“I am sensible, my dear parents, that in our republic, or rather \r\nin our kingdom, (for our father is to us as a beloved sovereign, \r\nand our mother as a much cherished queen,) I am I say sensible, \r\nthat here, as in Europe, he who has sufficient talent to raise \r\nhimself above the rest, is held in high consideration and esteem. \r\nFor my own part, I must confess I had more pleasure in remaining \r\nin tranquillity without endeavours to obtain distinction. I have \r\nbut little ambition, and am fond of quiet, and therefore the \r\ngreater will be my desert, if I, like the rest, resolve to contribute \r\nto the general good of this our country, by executing, as the \r\nother subjects have done, the task of climbing trees; well satisfied \r\nif, like them, I should obtain the applauses of my king and of my \r\nfellow-citizens!—To the tree then, since climbing is the question,” \r\nsaid he, saluting us with his hand as he sprang away to a high \r\npalm-tree of the cabbage species[13].\r\n\r\nI looked with extreme curiosity; but when I saw him courageously \r\ngrasp the trunk with his legs and arms, and proceed to climb \r\nwithout assistance, I approached the tree and offered him the \r\nshagreen and the cord; he accepted the first, but refused the \r\ncord. I am naturally somewhat awkward, observed he, and to have \r\nto draw a cord after me would only add to my difficulty; besides, \r\nI think I have no occasion for it. In fact, he employed so much \r\nearnest desire in the undertaking, and exerted his limbs with \r\nso much spirit, that I was astonished at the rapidity of his \r\nascent, and conceived at every remove the most terrible alarm, \r\nsince the further from the ground, the more danger would attend \r\nhim, should any slip or other accident occasion him to fall. \r\nI kept my station near the foot of the tree, continually encouraging \r\nhim by calling out: Bravo, bravo, boy Ernest, though last in \r\nattempt, yet it is you who have shown the greatest courage, for \r\nyou have not, like your brothers, had assistance from the cord. \r\nFritz and Jack, who were spectators also, now, instead of seeming \r\nhumbled by my repeated commendation of Ernest, to my great surprise, \r\nwere observed whispering each other with an air of self-satisfaction; \r\nI could not for my own part conceive what could be the subject \r\nof their seeming exultation, but I soon learnt the truth. When \r\nErnest now showed himself at the very top of the tree, Fritz \r\nand Jack burst into an immoderate fit of laughter:—Pains enough \r\nfor nothing, master Ernest, bawled they as loud as they could: \r\nin your sublime wisdom, master Ernest, you have chosen a tree \r\nwhich has no fruit upon it. Not a single cocoa-nut will you bring \r\ndown, your most devoted fellow-subjects can truly assure you!\r\n\r\nNot a cocoa-nut, certainly, replied Ernest in his loudest voice; \r\nbut, brothers, you shall receive a crown instead, and at the \r\nsame instant he with his hatchet cut off the tufted summit of \r\nthe palm-tree, and a large mass of tender leaves fell at our \r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nMischievous boy! cried his mother: disappointed of his cocoa-nuts, \r\nsee if he has not cut off the head of this magnificent palm-tree, \r\nand it will perish in consequence! Ah! Ernest, what do you not \r\ndeserve for thus giving way to anger!\r\n\r\nI am happy, mother, to be able to correct your mistake, cried \r\nErnest from his stately column, where he stood erect, and looked \r\nexactly like a statue. What I have done was not from anger, but \r\nfrom a desire to procure you one of the finest kinds of food \r\nthis country affords; the tree is the cabbage palm-tree, and \r\nbelieve me you will find it a more valuable acquisition than \r\neven our highly prized cocoa-nuts!—A cabbage! exclaimed Fritz: \r\nAh, ah! Master Ernest, so you would make us believe that cabbages \r\ngrow on palm-trees, and that we are in a land of wonders!\r\n\r\nIn a land of wonders, my son, we can never fail to be, in whatever \r\nplace we may abide, for the whole scheme of nature is a perpetual \r\ntissue of wonders proceeding from the hand of a beneficent Creator; \r\nand those we now behold appear to us extraordinary, only because \r\nwe view them for the first time. Examine this production, to \r\nwhich the name of palm-cabbage has been given by naturalists; \r\nit has not the shape of our European cabbage; but, as Ernest \r\ntells you, it is a most delicious and refreshing food: he has \r\nalso had the merit of distinguishing this tree from others: and \r\nlet me seize the present occasion, young ones, to reprove you for \r\nthe taunting spirit in which you viewed your brother’s proceedings, \r\nwho, though less enterprising and less alert than you, so far \r\nsurpasses any one of you in observation and reflection. To him \r\nwe are indebted for the most useful of the discoveries which \r\nhave been made—the potatoes and the manioc: if, instead of envying \r\neach other, you were to unite your various endowments, what happiness \r\nand what success might be the result! Ernest would think for \r\nyou, you would execute for him; thus, all would share in the \r\nadvantages which would result from this spirit of concord, so \r\nnecessary among mankind, but particularly among brothers. Let \r\nme also recommend to you to accustom yourselves to suspend your \r\njudgement on the actions of another, till those actions are complete \r\nand you are quite sure both of their object and effect. Even \r\nyou, well-beloved of my heart, were not on this occasion free \r\nfrom blame towards your boy! Try then to make him such reparation \r\nas your kind maternal heart shall dictate!\r\n\r\nMost willingly, cried she, her eyes filling with tears of tenderness; \r\nand she looked up to invite him to come down: mine and the boys’ \r\nfollowed in the same direction; when we beheld Ernest in a fixed \r\nerect position in the very centre of the palm-tree, which he \r\nhad stripped of its crown, as motionless as if he had become \r\na cabbage. The whole effect of this spectacle was irresistibly \r\nludicrous; and accordingly the boys, in spite of the lecture \r\nI had that moment concluded, burst into an immoderate fit of \r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nI now called out to Ernest: Do you mean, said I, to stay all \r\nnight in your tree, or are you afraid to trust yourself with \r\ncoming down?\r\n\r\nFar from it, father, answered he; but I am engaged in preparing \r\nyou here some good sauce for the cabbage, and the operation takes \r\na longer time than I imagined: but have a little patience, and \r\nI will bring down something for you to drink to my health.\r\n\r\nWhat can he mean? asked little Francis; I dare say he has found \r\na fountain in the tree; do you know, papa, I have been thinking \r\nthat this must be an enchanted forest, like those I have read \r\nabout in my little books; perhaps some of those trees are all \r\nthe time princes and princesses:—do you not think it very likely, \r\nbrother Fritz? said the young innocent with so real and fearful \r\na persuasion, that we all laughed heartily as we answered his \r\nquestion. His mother took him on her knee and explained to him the \r\nnature of a fairy-tale, while the scene for my own part strengthened \r\nme in the opinion that children should be told nothing but the \r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nBy this time Ernest had finished his work, and was descending \r\ncautiously from the tree. When he reached the ground, he released \r\nthe cocoa-shell from his button, held it delicately in one hand, \r\nwhile with the other he drew from his pocket a small bottle, \r\nand pulling out the cork he emptied the contents into the shell, \r\nand presented it to me, saying: Most gracious sovereign, permit \r\nyour devoted cup-bearer to present you with a specimen of a new \r\nand choice beverage he has been so fortunate as to procure for you: \r\nmay it be pleasing to your royal taste: it is called palmist-wine, \r\nand your faithful slave waits but your commands to obtain a larger \r\nsupply! . . . . .  \r\n\r\nMy wife and the other boys looked on in astonishment. I was myself \r\nless surprised, having read accounts of this production in different \r\nbooks. I was, however, much gratified to owe the acquisition \r\nto the study and reflection of my young philosopher, as I now \r\ncalled Ernest. It is excellent, my boy, said I, and we shall \r\nunite in drinking it to your health, with sensations of gratitude \r\nand affection. This was accordingly done.\r\n\r\nI then made some inquiries of Ernest, as to his previous knowledge \r\nof the tree and its properties; and he answered, that if he had \r\nbeen quite sure of these being the kind producing cabbage, he \r\nshould sooner have ascended. I knew, continued he, that there \r\nwas a sort of palm which bore a cabbage at the top; and while \r\nmy brothers were getting up for the cocoa-nuts, I was looking \r\nabout in hopes to find it, and presently I thought that the tree \r\nwhich had no cocoa-nuts was most likely to be the sort; and you \r\nsee I was lucky, in my guess. He then related his expectation \r\nof finding some of our famous palm-wine also. When I had cut \r\noff the cabbage, said he, a quantity of juice issued from the \r\nplace, which I tasted and found delicious: you know the rest, \r\nfather, added he; and I have only to regret that I had not a \r\nlarger bottle to receive it; but now that we know the means, \r\nwe can obtain the liquor when we please.\r\n\r\nA small quantity at a time, observed I, will always be best; \r\nfor the juice, though so like to Champaign in flavour, and which \r\nwould perhaps affect our heads as soon if we were to use it freely, \r\nwould by to-morrow, like the cocoa-milk, be quite sour: as there \r\nare abundance of the trees, we can, as you say, procure the liquor \r\nat pleasure, only taking care to be moderate; for it is affirmed \r\nby writers on natural history, that if the cabbage at the top \r\nis cut off, the tree dies, and we should therefore in time destroy \r\nthe species. There are other sorts of palm-trees besides those \r\nwe have noticed; one in particular, which yields a kind of oil \r\nwhich burns whatever it is applied to; we shall perhaps meet \r\nwith it. In the mean time, let us render thanks to Providence \r\nfor the benefits he has bestowed.\r\n\r\nIt was now past noon; and as we had determined to pass the night \r\nin this enchanting spot, we began to think of forming some large \r\nbranches of trees into a sort of hut, as is practised by the \r\nhunters in America, to shelter us from the dew and the coolness \r\nof the air, for we had dismissed our fears of the approach of \r\nwild-beasts, not having in so long a time been visited by any. \r\nI accordingly set to work; I had brought a piece of sail-cloth \r\nwith me from Falcon’s Stream, and I drove some stakes into the \r\nground, and covered them with it, filling the opening in the \r\nfront with some branches I had cut for the purpose. While we \r\nwere engaged in our work, which was nearly completed, we were \r\nsuddenly roused by the loud braying of the ass, which we had \r\nleft to graze at a distance but a short time before. As we approached \r\nnearer to the place, we saw him throwing his head in the air, \r\nand kicking and prancing about in a most extraordinary manner; \r\nand while we were thinking what could be the matter, he set off \r\non a full gallop, leaving us in a state of astonishment at all \r\nwe saw. Unfortunately, Turk and Porto, whom we sent after him, \r\ntook the fancy of entering the plantation of the sugar-canes, \r\nwhile the ass had preferred the direction of the bamboos on the \r\nright. We began to fear the approach of some wild beast might \r\nhave frightened the creature, and to think of assembling our \r\nfire-arms. In a little time the dogs returned, and showed no \r\nsigns, by scenting the ground or otherwise, of any pursuit. I \r\nmade a turn round the hut to see that all was well, and then \r\nsallied forth with Fritz and the two dogs in the direction the \r\nass had taken, hoping the latter might be enabled to trace him \r\nby the scent; but the familiar creatures could not be made to \r\nunderstand our meaning; they lived habitually with the ass, and \r\nhad no notion of the new reason for following him; so that they \r\ndid no more than run from place to place for their amusement; \r\nand as night was coming on, I prudently gave up the pursuit and \r\nreturned to my companions.\r\n\r\nFatigued, and vexed with the loss of the ass, which was so eminently \r\nuseful to us, I entered the hut, which I found complete and provided \r\nwith the necessary branches strewed on the ground for sleeping, \r\nand with some reeds for making a fire, which the freshness of \r\nthe evening air rendered agreeable to all: it served us also \r\nfor cooking our supper; and after it had been partaken by us \r\nall, we were glad to lie down upon the branches and enjoy the \r\nblessing of sleep. When all was safe, I watched and replenished \r\nthe fire till midnight, rather from habit than the fear of wild \r\nbeasts, and then took possession of the little corner assigned \r\nme near my slumbering companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. \r\n\r\n_A new country discovered.—The troop of buffalos; a precious \r\nacquisition._\r\n\r\nThe following morning found us all in good health, and thankful \r\nfor the Divine protection we had enjoyed. We breakfasted on some \r\nmilk from the cow, some boiled potatoes, and a small portion \r\nof Dutch cheese, and formed during our meal the plan of the business \r\nfor the day: we had in vain hoped that night and our bright fire \r\nwould bring back the fugitive; we had therefore no resource but to \r\ndepend upon our own exertions for recovering him. It was accordingly \r\ndecided that one of the boys and myself, attended by the two dogs, \r\nshould seek him in every direction through the bamboo plantation; \r\nand if we should not succeed in finding him, I was to return \r\nto the hut, where I knew my wife and the other boys would have \r\nbeen employed in cutting sugar-canes and collecting a provision \r\nof the different articles we had met with, preparatory to our \r\nreturn the following day to Falcon’s Stream. As I was to take \r\nboth the dogs, it seemed but reasonable that I should leave the \r\ntwo eldest boys to protect little Francis and his mother, and \r\nto take for my own escort the agile Jack, who was almost beside \r\nhimself with joy at this determination.\r\n\r\nWe took then our hatchets, our fire-arms, a little saw for the \r\ncocoa-nuts we might happen to find, and began our course with \r\nthe first dawn of the morning. We soon reached the bamboo plantation, \r\nwhich we entered, preceded by the dogs, and found means, though \r\nnot without difficulty, to force ourselves along its intricate \r\nentanglements. After the most exhausting fatigue, and when we \r\nwere on the point of relinquishing all further hope, we discovered \r\nthe print of the ass’s hoofs on the soil, which inspired us with \r\nnew ardour in the pursuit. After spending a whole hour in further \r\nendeavours, we at length, on reaching the skirts of the plantation, \r\nperceived the sea in the distance, and soon after found ourselves \r\nin an open space which bounded the great bay. A considerable \r\nriver flowed into the bay at this place, and we perceived that \r\nthe ridge of rocks which we had invariably observed to the right, \r\nextended to the shore, terminating in a perpendicular precipice, \r\nleaving only a narrow passage between the rocks and the river, \r\nwhich during every flux of the tide must necessarily be under \r\nwater, but which at that moment was dry and passable. The probability \r\nthat the ass would prefer passing by this narrow way, to the \r\nhazard of the water, determined us to follow in the same path: \r\nwe had also some curiosity to ascertain what might be found on \r\nthe other side of the rocks, for as yet we were ignorant whether \r\nthey formed a boundary to our island, or divided it into two \r\nportions; whether we should see there, land, or water. We continued \r\nto advance, and at length reached a stream which issued foaming \r\nfrom a large mass of rock and fell in a cascade into the river; \r\nthe bed of this stream was so deep, and its course so rapid, \r\nthat we were a long time finding a part where it might be most \r\npracticable for us to cross. When we had got to the other side, \r\nwe found the soil again sandy and mixed with a fertile kind of \r\nearth: in this place we no longer saw naked rock; and here we \r\nagain discovered the print of the ass’s hoofs.\r\n\r\nBy observing with attention, we beheld with astonishment that \r\nthere were the prints of the feet of other animals also, that \r\nthey were somewhat different from those of the ass, and much \r\nlarger. Our curiosity was so strongly excited by this appearance, \r\nthat we resolved to follow the traces; and they conducted us \r\nto a plain at a great distance, which presented to our wondering \r\neyes the exhilarating image of a terrestrial paradise. We ascended \r\na hill which partly concealed from our view this delicious scene, \r\nand then with the assistance of the glass we looked down upon \r\na range of country exhibiting every rural beauty that the mind \r\ncould conceive, and where a profound tranquillity had seemed \r\nto take up its abode. To our right appeared the majestic wall \r\nof rocks which divided the island, some of which appeared to \r\ntouch the heavens, others seemed to imprint the clouds with wild \r\nfantastic forms, while mists broken into pieces partially concealed \r\ntheir tops. To the left, a chain of gently rising hills, the \r\nlong green verdure of which was tinged with blue, stretched as \r\nfar as the eye could discern, and were interspersed at agreeable \r\ndistances with little woods of palm-trees of every kind. The \r\nriver we had crossed flowed in a serpentine course through this \r\nexquisite valley, presenting the idea of a broad floating silver \r\nribbon, while its banks were adorned with reeds and various aquatic \r\nplants. I could with difficulty take my eyes from this enchanting \r\nspectacle, and I seated myself on the ground to contemplate and \r\nenjoy it at my leisure. Neither the plain nor on the hills was \r\nthere the smallest trace of the abode of man, or of any kind \r\nof cultivation; it was every where a virgin soil in all its original \r\npurity; nothing endowed with life appeared to view, excepting \r\na few birds which flew fearlessly around us, and a quantity of \r\nbrilliantly coloured butterflies, which the eye frequently confounded \r\nwith the different sorts of unknown flowers, which here and there \r\ndiversified the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nBy straining our eyes, however, as far as we could see, we thought \r\nwe perceived at a great distance some specks upon the land, that \r\nseemed to be in motion. We hastened towards the spot; and as \r\nwe drew nearer, to our inexpressible surprise discovered a group \r\nof animals, which in the assemblage presented something like \r\nthe outline of a troop of horses or of cows; I observed them \r\nsometimes run up to each other, and then suddenly stoop to graze. \r\nThough we had not lately met with further traces of the ass, \r\nI was not entirely without hope of finding him among this group \r\nof animals. We accordingly drew near by a path we found in a \r\nplantation of reeds, that we might not give notice of our approach, \r\nbeing ignorant of the kind of animal we were about to meet. We \r\nhad not gone far when the soil became so marshy, and the reeds \r\nentangled to such a degree, that we were obliged to get out of \r\nthe plantation and wind along on the outside. We were soon near \r\nthe animals, which we perceived consisted of rather a numerous \r\ntroop of wild buffalos[14]. This animal is formed at first sight to \r\ninspire the beholder with terror; it is endowed with an extraordinary \r\ndegree of strength, and two or three of them were capable of \r\ndestroying us in a moment, should they feel the desire of attacking \r\nus. My alarm was so great, that I remained for a few moments \r\nfixed to the spot like a statue. By good luck the dogs were far \r\nbehind us, and the buffalos having never beheld the face of man, \r\ngave no sign of fear or of displeasure at our approach; they \r\nstood perfectly still, with their large round eyes fixed upon \r\nus in astonishment; those which were lying down got up slowly, \r\nbut not one among them seemed to have any hostile disposition towards \r\nus. The circumstance of the dogs’ absence was most likely, on this \r\noccasion, the means of our safety, for on the least demonstration \r\nfrom these, no doubt the fierce animals would instantly have \r\nfallen upon us. As it was, we had time to draw back quietly and \r\nprepare our fire-arms. It was not, however, my intention to make \r\nuse of them in any way but for defence, being sensible that we \r\nwere not strong enough for the encounter, and recollecting also \r\nto have read that the sound of a gun drives the buffalo to a \r\nstate of desperation. I therefore thought only of retreating; \r\nand with my poor Jack, for whom I was more alarmed than for myself, \r\nwas proceeding in this way, when unfortunately Turk and Ponto \r\nran up to us, and we could see were noticed by the buffalos. \r\nThe animals instantly, and altogether, set up such a roar, as \r\nto make our nerves tremble with the shock of so terrible a noise; \r\nthey struck their horns and their hoofs upon the ground, which \r\nthey tore up by pieces and scattered in the air. I with horror \r\nforesaw the moment when confounding us with the dogs, which no \r\ndoubt they mistook for jackals, they would seize upon and tear \r\nus to pieces. Our brave Turk and Ponto, fearless of danger, ran \r\namong the troop in spite of all our efforts to detain them, and \r\naccording to their manner of attacking, laid hold of the ears \r\nof a young buffalo which happened to be standing a few paces nearer \r\nto us than the rest; and though the creature began a tremendous \r\nroar and motion with his hoofs, they held him fast, and were \r\ndragging him towards us. Thus hostilities had commenced; and unless \r\nwe could resolve to abandon the cause of our valiant defenders, \r\nwe were now forced upon the measure of open war, which, considering \r\nthe strength and number of the enemy, wore a face of the most \r\npressing and inevitable danger. Our every hope seemed now to \r\nbe in the chance of the terror the buffalos would feel at the \r\nnoise of our musketry, which for the first time would assail \r\ntheir organs, and perhaps excite them to flight. With, I must \r\nconfess, a palpitating heart and trembling hands, we fired both \r\nat the same moment: the buffalos, terrified by the sound and \r\nby the smoke, remained for an instant motionless, as if struck \r\nby a thunderbolt, and then one and all betook themselves to flight \r\nwith such incredible rapidity that they were soon beyond the \r\nreach of our sight. We heard their loud roaring from a considerable \r\ndistance, which by degrees subsided into silence, and we were \r\nleft with only one of their terrific species near us; this one, \r\na female, was no doubt the mother of the young buffalo which \r\nthe dogs had seized and still kept a prisoner; she had drawn \r\nnear on hearing its cries, and had been wounded by our guns, \r\nbut not killed; the creature was in a furious state: after a \r\nmoment’s pause, she took aim at the dogs, and with her head on \r\nthe ground, as if to guide her by the scent, was advancing in \r\nher rage, and would have torn them to pieces, if I had not prevented \r\nher by firing upon her with my double-barrelled gun, and thus \r\nputting an end to her existence.\r\n\r\nIt was only now that we began to breathe. A few moments before, \r\ndeath, in the most horrible and inevitable form, seemed to stare \r\nus in the face! But now we might hope that every danger was over! \r\nI was enchanted with the behaviour of my boy, who, instead of \r\ngiving way to fears and lamentations, as other lads of his age \r\nwould probably have done, had stood all the time in a firm posture \r\nby my side, and had fired with a steady aim in silence. I bestowed \r\nfreely on him the commendation he had so well deserved, and made \r\nhim sensible how necessary it is in times of danger to preserve \r\na presence of mind, which in many cases is of itself sufficient \r\nto effect the sought-for deliverance. But I had not time for \r\na long discourse. The young buffalo still remained a prisoner \r\nwith his ears in the mouths of the dogs, and the pain occasioned \r\nhim to be so furious that I was fearful he might do them some \r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nI therefore determined to advance and give them what assistance \r\nI might find practicable. To say the truth, I scarcely knew in \r\nwhat way to effect this. The buffalo, though young, was strong \r\nenough to revenge himself, if I were to give the dogs a sign \r\nto let go his ears. I had the power of killing him with a pistol \r\nat a stroke; but I had a great desire to preserve him alive, \r\nand to tame him, that he might be a substitute for the ass, which \r\nwe now had no hope of recovering.\r\n\r\nI found myself altogether in a perplexing state of indecision, \r\nwhen Jack suddenly and unexpectedly interposed a most effective \r\nmeans for accomplishing my wishes. He had his string with balls \r\nin his pocket; he drew it out hastily, and making a few steps \r\nbackward, he threw it so skilfully as to entangle the buffalo \r\ncompletely, and throw him down. As I could then approach him \r\nsafely, I tied his legs by two and two together with a very strong \r\ncord; the dogs released his ears, and from this moment we considered \r\nthe buffalo as our own. Jack was almost mad with joy. What a \r\nmagnificent creature! How much better than the ass he will look, \r\nharnessed to the cart! How my mother and the boys will be surprised \r\nand stare at him as we draw near! repeated he many and many times.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Ah hah! What, you already fancy him exactly to your \r\nwishes, Jack; already you have harnessed him to the loaded cart, \r\nwhile for my part I have not yet been able to conceive a means \r\nfor even removing him from this place! Will you carry him upon \r\nyour back?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—If I were Sampson or Hercules I would most willingly; \r\nbut, father, he will be able to walk if we untie his legs.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And if we bid him do so, you think he will implicitly \r\nobey us?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—The dogs would make him get on.\r\n\r\n_Father._—And the buffalo might kill the dogs, Jack, and then \r\nturn back at a full gallop:—on reflection, the best way I think \r\nwill be to tie his two fore-legs together, so tight that he cannot \r\nrun, and loose enough for him to walk, as they do to mischievous \r\nhorses: I will assist the scheme by trying a method which is \r\npractised in Italy for subduing the buffalo; you will think it \r\nsomewhat cruel, but the success will be certain; it shall afterwards \r\nbe our study to make him amends by the kindest care and treatment. \r\nHold you the cord which confines his legs with all your strength, \r\nthat he may not be able to move:—I then called Turk and Ponto, \r\nand made each again take hold of the ears of the animal, who \r\nwas now keeping his head quite still; I took from my pocket a \r\nsharp and pointed knife, and held a piece of string in my hand \r\nin readiness; I placed myself before the buffalo, and taking \r\nhold of his snout, I made a hole in his nostril, into which I \r\nquickly inserted the string, which I immediately tied so closely \r\nto a tree, that the animal was prevented from the least motion \r\nof the head which might have inflamed the wound and increased \r\nhis pain. I drew off the dogs the moment the operation was performed. \r\nThe creature, thus rendered furious, would have run away, but \r\nthe stricture of the legs and the pain in the nostril prevented \r\nit. The first attempt I made to pull the cord, found him docile \r\nand ready to accommodate his motions to our designs, and I perceived \r\nthat we might now begin our march. I left him for a short time \r\nto make some other preparations.\r\n\r\nI was unwilling to leave so fine a prey as the dead buffalo behind \r\nus: I therefore, after considering what was to be done, began \r\nby cutting out the tongue, which I sprinkled with some of the \r\nsalt we had in our provision-bag: I next took off the skin from \r\nthe four feet, taking care not to tear it in the operation. I \r\nremembered that the Americans use these skins, which are of a \r\nsoft and flexible quality, as boots and shoes, and I considered \r\nthem as precious articles. I lastly cut some of the flesh of \r\nthe animal with the skin on, and salted it, and abandoned the \r\nrest to the dogs, as a recompense for the valour of their behaviour, \r\nand I then repaired to the river to wash myself after the performance \r\nof these butcher-like employments.\r\n\r\nWe now seated ourselves under the shade of a large tree; and \r\nas we ate the remaining portion of our provisions, amused ourselves \r\nwith an animated review of the scene which had been passing. \r\nOur dogs were no less busily employed in greedily devouring the \r\nflesh of the buffalo.\r\n\r\nAs we were not disposed to leave the spot in a hurry, I desired \r\nJack to take the saw and cut down a small quantity of the reeds, \r\nwhich from their enormous size might hereafter be of use to us. \r\nWe set to work, but I observed that he took pains to choose the \r\nsmallest.—What shall we do, said I, with these small-sized reeds? \r\nYou are thinking, I presume, of nothing better than providing \r\na bag-pipe to announce a triumphal arrival to our companions! \r\nYou are mistaken, father, answered Jack; I am thinking rather \r\nof some candlesticks to present to my mother, who will set so \r\nhigh a value on them!\r\n\r\nThis is a good thought, my boy, said I, tapping him on the shoulder, \r\nI am well pleased both with the kindness and the readiness of \r\nyour invention, and I will give you my assistance in trying to \r\nempty the reeds without breaking them; if we should not succeed, \r\nat least we know where to provide ourselves with more. I now \r\nhelped him to choose some reeds, and soon after we set out on \r\nour return home.\r\n\r\nWe had so many and such heavy articles to remove, that I did not \r\nhesitate to dismiss, for that day, all thoughts of looking further \r\nfor the ass, that we might return the sooner to our companions \r\nto relieve any uneasiness they might have felt at our long stay, \r\nand also to be myself satisfied respecting their safety during \r\nour absence. I began now to think of untying the young buffalo; \r\nand on approaching him, perceived with pleasure that he was asleep, \r\nwhich afforded me a proof that his wound was not extremely painful. \r\nWhen I awaked him he gave a start as I began to pull him gently \r\nwith the string; but he afterwards seemed to forget his pain, \r\nand followed me without resistance. I fastened another string \r\nto his horns, and led him on by drawing both together; and he \r\nperformed the journey with little inconvenience, and with so \r\nunexpected a docility, that to ease ourselves of a part of the \r\nheavy burdens we had to carry, we even ventured on the measure \r\nof fastening the bundles of reeds upon his back, and upon these \r\nwe laid the salted pieces of the buffalo. The creature did not \r\nseem aware that he was carrying a load; he followed in our path, \r\nas before, and thus on the first day of our acquaintance he rendered \r\nus an essential service.\r\n\r\nIn a short time we found ourselves once more at the narrow passage \r\nbetween the torrent and the precipice of the rocks, which I have \r\nalready mentioned. Near this spot, we met with a large jackal, \r\nwho on perceiving us, slunk away, but was stoutly pursued by \r\nour brave dogs, who overtook him at the entrance of a cavern, \r\nand forced him to give them battle. The fight, however, was unequal; \r\nthe dogs were two to one, besides being protected by their pointed \r\ncollars, which enabled them to resist the most skilful attacks \r\nof the enemy. When we got up to them, the jackal was already \r\nkilled. On examining our prey, we found it was a female, which \r\nfrom appearances had lately brought forth young, and we therefore \r\nconcluded that she was going to suckle them in the cavern, where \r\nno doubt they lay concealed. Jack would instantly have entered \r\nto search for them; but I prevented him, from the apprehension \r\nthat the male might also be there for the purpose of guarding \r\nthem. I accordingly used the precaution of shooting off my piece \r\ninto the dark profundity which presented itself, when finding \r\nall quiet, I gave him leave to enter, being myself both proud \r\nand gratified by every proof he gave of personal courage.\r\n\r\nFor some moments after entering the cavern, the complete darkness \r\nwhich prevailed prevented him from seeing any thing around him; \r\nbut when his eyes had become accustomed to it, he discerned in \r\na corner a litter of young jackals: the dogs who accompanied \r\nhad before discovered them by the smell; they flew upon the creatures \r\nwithout mercy, and with the exception of one, which Jack found \r\nmeans to preserve, put an end to their existence. He came out \r\nof the cavern with the young jackal in his arms, asking if he \r\nmight have leave to rear it as Fritz had done his monkey; and \r\nto this I made no objection, being unwilling to refuse to one \r\nof my children what I had granted to another; besides that it \r\nappeared to me that nothing could be so cruel as to kill the \r\ninnocent little being in cold blood, or to leave it there to \r\nperish. I also felt the inclination to make an experiment on \r\nthe effects and power of education, and to observe if it should \r\nbe possible to succeed in taming him in such a degree as to obtain \r\nin consequence a race of good running dogs; at all events it \r\nseemed worth while to convince ourselves by the experiment. Jack \r\ntherefore obtained leave to keep him, and could scarcely express \r\nthe joy he felt: he pressed the animal to his bosom and devoured \r\nit with kisses, and promised to bestow upon him so faultless \r\nan education, that he should become the gentlest and most engaging \r\nlittle creature in the world.\r\n\r\nWe now left the cavern. I had fastened the young buffalo to a \r\ntree near the cascade without remarking of what species it might \r\nbe; when I went to release him, I saw that it was a kind of small \r\npalm-tree, and on looking about me I observed also some other \r\nkinds of the palm which I had not before met with[15]. One of \r\nthe kinds I now remarked was from ten to twelve feet in height; \r\nits leaves were armed with thorns, and it bore a fruit resembling \r\na small cucumber in form, but which at this time was immature, \r\nso that we could not taste it. The second, which was smaller, \r\nwas also thorny; it was now in blossom, and had no fruit. I suspected \r\nthat the first of these was the _little royal palm_, sometimes \r\ncalled _awiva_, or _Adam’s needle_; and the other, the _dwarf \r\npalm_. I resolved to avail myself of both for further fortifying \r\nmy enclosure at Tent-House, and also to protect the outer side \r\nof the narrow pass immediately over the torrent of the cascade. \r\nI determined to return and plant a line of them there, as close \r\nto each other as the consideration of their growth would allow; \r\nfor my intention, of course, was to effect this by means of the \r\nyoung shoots which presented themselves in great abundance; we \r\nalso hoped by that time to find their fruit ripe, and to ascertain \r\ntheir kind.\r\n\r\nWe repassed the river in safety, and accompanied by the agreeable \r\nnoise of its foaming cascades, we regained the hazardous and \r\nnarrow pass at the turn of the rocks. We however proceeded with \r\ncaution, and finding ourselves safe on the other side, we thought of \r\nquickening our pace to arrive the sooner at the hut: we accordingly \r\nhad the happiness to rejoin our friends before the close of the \r\nevening; and though we were somewhat fatigued, yet in other respects \r\nwe were well and satisfied with the success of our various \r\nundertakings. We were received with the liveliest demonstrations of \r\njoy, and, as usual, a thousand questions asked at once. Where, how \r\nand where did we procure such interesting creatures as the buffalo \r\nand the golden fox? Shall we see the precipice and the cascade \r\nat the end of the wall of rocks?—Questions were so rapidly proposed \r\nto us, that we were obliged to demand on our parts the necessary \r\ntime for answering them. This being granted, the story of our \r\ndifferent adventures served for the amusement of the evening: \r\nconversing happily together concerning them, we enjoyed the sober \r\nmeal which had been prepared for us; and having warmed ourselves \r\nby the fire, we retired in thankfulness to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. \r\n\r\n_The Malabar eagle, and sago manufactory._\r\n\r\nMy wife the next morning began the conversation. She told me \r\nthe children had been good and diligent, that all of them had \r\nascended Cape Disappointment together, that they had gathered \r\nwood and made some torches for the night; and, what I could scarcely \r\nthink possible, they had ventured to fell an immense palm-tree, \r\nto the top of which Ernest had again climbed for amusement; and \r\nafterwards they undertook the laborious and perilous work of \r\nbringing it down, which they also happily executed. This monarch \r\nof the forests lay prostrate on the ground, and covered a space \r\nof at least seventy feet in length. To effect their purpose, \r\nErnest had got up the tree a second time, with a long rope which \r\nhe fastened tight to the top of it. As soon as he had come down \r\nagain, he and Fritz worked with the axe and saw, to cut it through. \r\nWhen it was nearly divided, they cautiously managed its fall \r\nwith the rope, and in this manner they succeeded. But during \r\ntheir excursion and labours, a somewhat unfortunate visit took \r\nplace. A numerous group of monkeys had found their way to the hut: \r\nevery drop of the palm-wine we had preserved in our gourd-shells, \r\nthese intrusive gentry contrived to swallow; they had upset and \r\nthrown about all the potatoes, stolen the cocoa-nuts, and disturbed, \r\nnay even almost wholly demolished, the order of the branches \r\nand other contrivances we had recourse to for our hut; so that \r\nmy children on their return were employed a full hour in repairing \r\nthe damage effected by those mischievous creatures. Fritz was \r\nin high spirits with the luck he had met with and secured; he \r\nbrought me on his wrist a young bird of prey, of the most beauteous \r\nplumage; he had taken it from a nest in one of the rocks near \r\nthe hill at Cape Disappointment. Very young as the bird was, \r\nit had already all its feathers, though they had not yet received \r\ntheir full colouring; but it was evidently not an European eagle, \r\nand I supposed it to be the beautiful eagle of Malabar[16]. I \r\nviewed it with the admiration it was entitled to:—meeting with \r\none of these birds is thought a lucky omen; and as this species \r\nof eagle is neither large nor expensive in its food, I was desirous \r\nto train it like a falcon to pursue smaller birds. Fritz had \r\nalready covered its eyes and fastened the foot with packthread; \r\nI advised him to hold it often, and for a length of time, on \r\nhis hand, and to tame it with hunger as falconers do.\r\n\r\nWhen we had all finished our narratives, my wife began her usual \r\nlamentations upon the subject of so many living and devouring \r\nanimals being brought to her, and which she said must in no long \r\ntime, from the food they required, become burthensome to us. \r\nI consoled her with some difficulty, by observing that the buffalo \r\nwould be a good substitute for the ass; and I established as \r\nan invariable law, that he who wished to have a useful animal \r\nin his service, should also have the care of keeping it. It is \r\na cruelty, said I, to deprive a feeling creature of its liberty, \r\nfor a transient pleasure or amusement to ourselves, and to make \r\nit suffer; we ought, on the contrary, to recompense it for the \r\nprivation it would have to endure, by kind treatment and feeding \r\nit well. I declare then, that he who neglects the animals committed \r\nto his charge shall no longer be thought worthy of having so \r\nimportant a care intrusted to him. This warning intimidated my \r\nhearers; for man is a creature so formed for society, and so \r\ndependent upon it for his comforts and content, that, when by \r\naccidents deprived of intercourse with his own species, he attaches \r\nhimself to the brute creation with even warm affection. This \r\nsatisfied the kind temper of my wife; and as she was herself \r\nvery partial to animals, she promised her sons to take the charge \r\nof one and all of the animals upon herself whenever their absence \r\nfrom home should render this necessary. We communicated to each \r\nother our hopes that such attentions would form them to more \r\nactive, regular, and constant habits of affection and mildness \r\ntowards us. I have said, I frequently noticed that treating animals \r\nwith kindness tends to produce the benign effects I have been \r\nspeaking of.\r\n\r\nI next ordered a fire to be lighted and a quantity of green wood \r\nto be put on it, for the purpose of raising a thick smoke, over \r\nwhich I meant to hang the buffalo meat I had salted, to dry and \r\npreserve it for our future use; and this was done accordingly. \r\nWe fixed pieces of it on long forked poles. I cut away what appeared \r\nnot quite fresh, and saw our little eagle feast upon it voraciously. \r\nThe young buffalo was beginning to browse, but the cow’s milk \r\nwas still given it; and Jack succeeded in making his little jackal \r\ndrink some occasionally, likewise. We added to the buffalo’s \r\nmeal, whose appetite we found to be enormous, a heap of sliced \r\npotatoes, the whole of which he greedily devoured; and this led \r\nus to conclude that the pain from the wound in his nose was subsided, \r\nand that he would soon become tame.\r\n\r\nSupper-time was now arrived, and we did not fail to acquit ourselves \r\nat it, as well, to say the least, as our cattle, seasoning our \r\nrepast with lively anecdotes and affectionate conversation. The \r\ncombat with the buffalos excited much raillery; but we saw that \r\nit was no less intended for compliment also, nor was our design \r\nto make boots and shoes of their hoofs passed over in silence; \r\nthe candle-moulds too came in for a share in these their playful \r\nattacks upon what they called the wonderful feats we had performed. \r\nJack persisted in defending himself, and this he did so cleverly \r\nas to point the laughter at the adversary. The arrangements for \r\nthis night were much the same as for the preceding. We left our \r\nmeat suspended over the smoke of our fires during our sleep; \r\nwe tied the young buffalo by the side of the cow, and were pleased \r\nto see them agree and bid fair to live in peace together. The \r\ndogs were set upon the watch. Fritz resolved to go to bed with \r\nhis eaglet fastened on his wrist, and its eyes still bound: it \r\nremained in this state throughout the night without disturbing \r\nits master. The time of repose elapsed so calmly that none of \r\nus awoke to keep in the torchlights, which now for the first \r\ntime the industry of the boys had supplied us with, and we did \r\nnot get up till after sun-rise. Directly after a moderate breakfast \r\nI chaunted the accustomed summons for our setting out; but my \r\nyoung ones had some projects in their heads, and neither they \r\nnor their mother were just then in the humour to obey me.\r\n\r\nLet us reflect a little first, said my wife: as we had so much \r\ndifficulty in felling the palm-tree, would it not be a pity to \r\nlose our labour by leaving it in this place? It is the one from \r\nwhich Ernest cut out the famous cabbage: as it was thus deprived \r\nof future growth and bearing fruit, we wished to reap benefit \r\nfrom it in another way; Ernest assures me it is a sago-tree; \r\nif so, the pith would be an excellent ingredient for our soups. \r\nI request you will examine it, and let us see if in any way we \r\ncan turn it to account.\r\n\r\nI found she was in the right: but in that case it was necessary \r\nto employ a day in the business, since to open from one end to \r\nthe other the trunk of a tree sixty feet long was not a trivial \r\ntask. I assented however with some readiness, as, independent \r\nof the use of the farinaceous pith, I could, by emptying it, \r\nobtain two handsome and large troughs for the conveyance of water \r\nfrom Jackal’s river to my wife’s kitchen garden at Tent House, \r\nand thence to my new plantations of trees.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—One of the halves, father, will answer that purpose, \r\nand the other will serve as a conduit for our little stream from \r\nFalcon’s Nest into my pretty bason lined with tortoise-shell; \r\nwe then shall be constantly regaled with the agreeable view of \r\na fountain close to our dwelling:—I fancy it now before my eyes \r\nand that I see its course. And I, for my part, said Ernest, long \r\nfor a sight of the sago formed into small grains as I have seen it \r\nin Europe. Can you, father, make it up into that sort of composition?\r\n\r\nWith your help I think I could. Come, let us set up a famous \r\nmanufactory of vermicelli and macaroni! and what other delicacy \r\nshall I say?\r\n\r\n_Francis._—Oh! yes, papa, I intreat you, macaroni! it is so nice, \r\nI will assist in making that.\r\n\r\nLittle glutton! answered I, you would, I imagine, rather assist \r\nin eating up all we can make. I do not however promise that our \r\nmanufactory will produce such good and well made articles as \r\nthose of Genoa and Naples; but let us first make the sago-paste, \r\nand afterwards work it up for such purposes of magnificence as \r\nin our profound wisdom we may afterwards be led to desire. Have \r\nwe not one of our manioc graters here at hand?\r\n\r\nYes certainly, replied Ernest. We were even thinking of making \r\nsome of them here for our amusement, but we found we were not \r\nlikely to want employment: and he accordingly scampered away \r\nto fetch it me, while the rest crowded round me. Patience, children, \r\npatience, exclaimed I; we are not yet in readiness to use it, \r\nmany other matters are previously requisite: in the first place \r\nyou must assist me to raise this palm-tree from the ground, and \r\nit must be done by fixing at each end two small cross pieces \r\nor props to support it; to split it open as it lies, would be \r\na work of too much labour: this done, I shall want several wooden \r\nwedges to keep the cleft open while I am sawing it, and afterwards \r\na sufficient quantity of water. There is the difficulty, said \r\nmy wife; our Falcon’s Stream is too far off, and we have not \r\nyet discovered any spring in the neighbourhood of this place.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—That is of no consequence, mother; I have seen hereabouts \r\nso great an abundance of the plants which contain water, that \r\nwe need not be at a loss; for they will fully supply us, if I \r\ncould only contrive to get vessels enough to hold it.\r\n\r\nWe now produced the enormous reeds we had brought home, which \r\nbeing hollow would answer the purpose of vessels: and as some \r\ntime was required to draw off the water from such small tubes, \r\nhe and Francis at once set to work; they cut a number of the \r\nplants, which they placed slantingly over the brim of a vessel, \r\nand whilst that was filling they were preparing another. The \r\nrest of us got round the tree, and with our united strength we \r\nsoon succeeded in raising the heavy trunk, and the top of it \r\nwas then sawed off. We next began to split it through the whole \r\nlength, and this the softness of the wood enabled us to effect \r\nwith little trouble. We soon reached the pith or marrow that \r\nfills up the middle of the trunk the whole of its length. When \r\ndivided, we laid one half on the ground, and we pressed the pith \r\ntogether with our hands so as to make temporary room for the \r\npith of the other half of the trunk, which rested still on the \r\nprops. We wished to empty it entirely, that we might employ it \r\nas a kneading-trough, leaving merely enough of the pith at both \r\nends to prevent a running out, and then we proceeded to form \r\nour paste. We had fastened the grater at one end, for the purpose \r\nof squeezing the paste through the small holes as soon as it \r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nMy young manufacturers with stripped arms joyfully fell to work, \r\nand really surpassed my expectation; they brought water in succession \r\nand poured it gradually into the trough, whilst we mixed it with \r\nthe flour. In a short time the paste appeared sufficiently fermented; \r\nI then made an aperture at the bottom of the grater on its outside, \r\nand pressed the paste strongly with my hand; the farinaceous \r\nparts passed with ease through the small holes of the grater, \r\nand the ligneous parts blended with particles of wood, which did \r\nnot pass, were thrown aside in a heap, in the hope that mushrooms, \r\n&c. might spring from them. My boys were in readiness to receive \r\nin the reed vessels, what fell from the grater, and conveyed \r\nit directly to their mother, whose business was to spread out \r\nthe small grains in the sun upon sail cloth for the purpose of \r\ndrying them. The subsequent process was the making of vermicelli, \r\nby working up the paste into a thicker consistence and pressing \r\nit more forcibly against the perforations of the grater; they \r\npassed through in slender rolls of different lengths, which were \r\nquickly dried by means of a gentle fire. To remunerate our toil my \r\nwife promised to dress us an excellent dish of this new manufacture, \r\nwith some Dutch cheese, similar to Italian macaroni. Thus we \r\nprocured a good supply of a wholesome and pleasant food; and \r\nshould have had a larger stock of it, had we not been restricted \r\nas to time; but the privilege of renewing the process at pleasure, \r\nby felling a sago-tree, added to some impatience to take home \r\nour two pretty conduits and employ them as proposed, prompted \r\nus to expedite the business. The paste which remained was thrown \r\nupon the mushroom-bed, and watered well to promote a fermentation.\r\n\r\nWe employed ourselves the remainder of the evening in loading \r\nthe cart with our tools and the two halves of the tree. Night \r\ncoming on, we retired to our hut, where we enjoyed our usual \r\nrepose, and early next morning were ready to return to Falcon’s \r\nStream. Our buffalo now commenced his service, yoked with the \r\ncow; he supplied the want of the ass, and was very tractable: \r\nit is true I led him by the cord which passed through his nose, \r\nand thus I restrained him within the bounds of his duty whenever \r\nhe was disposed to deviate.\r\n\r\nWe returned the same way as we came, in order to load the cart \r\nwith a provision of berries, wax, and elastic gum. I gave up \r\nlooking for eggs this day, as I was very desirous to get back \r\nas soon as possible to Falcon’s Stream, to look after the beasts \r\nwe had left there. I sent forward Fritz and Jack as a van-guard, \r\nwith one of the dogs; they were to cut a commodious and secure \r\nroad through the bushes for our cart. The two water conductors, \r\nwhich were very long, produced numerous difficulties and somewhat \r\nimpeded our progress. My sons well performed their task, and \r\nwe reached with tolerable speed and without any accident the \r\nwax and gum trees, where we halted to place our sacks filled \r\nwith berries in the cart. The elastic gum had not yielded as \r\nmuch as I expected, from the too rapid thickening caused by an \r\nardent sun, and an incrustation formed over the incision: we \r\nobtained however about a quart, which sufficed for the experiment \r\nof the impenetrable boots I had so long desired.\r\n\r\nWe set out again, still preceded by our pioneers, who cleared \r\nthe way for us through the little wood of guavas. Suddenly we \r\nheard a dreadful noise which came from our van-guard, and beheld \r\nFritz and Jack hastening towards us. I began now to fear a tiger \r\nor panther was near at hand, or had perhaps attacked them. Turk \r\nbegan to bark so frightfully, and Ponto running up to him joined \r\nin so hideous a yell, that I prepared myself, not without terror, \r\nfor a bloody conflict. I advanced at the head of my troop, who \r\nexpressed their determination to follow me to the assistance \r\nof those I thought in danger, and my high-mettled dogs ran furiously \r\nup to a thicket, where they stopped, and with their noses to \r\nthe ground and almost breathless strove to enter it: I had no \r\ndoubt some terrible animal was lurking there; and Fritz, who \r\nhad seen it through the leaves, confirmed my suspicion; he said \r\nit was about the size of the young buffalo, and that its hair \r\nwas black and shaggy. I was going to fire at it promiscuously \r\nin the thicket, when Jack, who had thrown himself on his face \r\non the ground to have a better view of the animal, got up in \r\na fit of laughter—It is only, exclaimed he, dame pig, that has \r\nplayed us another trick—our old sow, who is never tired of playing \r\noff her tricks upon us. He had hardly spoken, when the grunting \r\nof the concealed monster justified the assertion made by Jack. \r\nHalf vexed, half laughing, we broke into the midst of the thicket, \r\nwhere in reality we found our sow stretched supinely on the earth, \r\nbut by no means in a state of dreary solitude; the good matron \r\nhad round her seven little creatures, which had been littered \r\na few days, and were sprawling about contending with each other \r\nfor the best place near their mother for a hearty meal. This \r\ndiscovery gave us considerable satisfaction, and we all greeted \r\nthe corpulent creature, who seemed to recollect and welcome us \r\nwith a sociable kind of grunting, while she licked her young \r\nwithout any ceremony or show of fear. We rewarded her docility \r\nwith potatoes, sweet acorns, and manioc bread; for the boys one and \r\nall readily consented to go without themselves for her accommodation: \r\nthey felt obliged to her for the new family she had given them, \r\nand anticipated ideally the pleasure of beholding a nice crisp \r\nsuckling pig before the fire. But their mother censured their \r\ngreedy impatience and cruelty, in already thinking about roasting \r\nthe poor animals on their very entrance into life. A general \r\nconsultation took place—should this swinish family be left where \r\nwe found it, or conveyed to Falcon’s Stream? Fritz voted for \r\ntheir being all left to run at large like the wild boars in Europe, \r\nthat he might have the sport of hunting them. My wife, like a \r\ngood housewife, proposed that two of them at least should be \r\ndomesticated for breeding; and as to the old sow, as she was \r\nalways running away, it would be better to kill her when done \r\nsuckling, and she would afford a large provision of salt meat;—and \r\nher opinion was adopted. For the moment they were suffered to \r\nkeep quiet possession of their retreat; we resolved to rear three \r\nof them, and allow the other four to take to the woods, where \r\nthey might be hunted if they injured our plantations.\r\n\r\nWe then, so many adventures ended, pursued our road to Falcon’s \r\nStream, and arrived there in safety and content;—so true it is, \r\nthat home is always dear and sacred to the heart, and anticipated \r\nwith delight. All was in due order, and our domestic animals \r\nwelcomed our return in their own jargon and manner, but which \r\ndid not fail to be expressive of their satisfaction in seeing \r\nus again. We threw them some of the food we knew them to be the \r\nmost partial to, which they greedily accepted, and then voluntarily \r\nwent back to their usual stand. It was necessary to practise \r\na measure dictated by prudence, which was to tie up again the \r\nbuffalo and jackal, to inure them by degrees to confinement; \r\nand the handsome Malabar eagle shared the same fate: Fritz deemed \r\nhimself remarkably clever in placing it near the parrot on the \r\nroot of a tree; he fastened it with a piece of packthread of \r\nsufficient length to allow it free motion, and uncovered its \r\neyes: till then the bird had been tolerably quiet; but the instant \r\nit was restored to light, it fell into a species of rage that \r\nsurprised us; it proudly raised its head; its feathers became \r\nruffled, and its eye-balls seemed to whirl in their orbits and \r\ndart out vivid lightnings. All the poultry was terrified and \r\nfled; but the poor luckless parrot was too near the sanguinary \r\ncreature to escape. Before we were aware of the danger, it was \r\nseized and mangled by the formidable hooked beak of the eagle \r\nin an almost inconceivably short space of time. Fritz vented \r\nhis anger in loud, severe, and passionate reproaches: he would \r\nhave killed the murderer on the spot, had not Ernest run up and \r\nentreated him to spare its life: Parrots, said he, we shall find \r\nin plenty, but never perhaps so beauteous, so magnificent a bird \r\nas this eagle, which, as father observes, we may train for hawking. \r\nYou may too blame only yourself, continued Ernest, for the parrot’s \r\ndeath;—why did you uncover the eagle’s eyes? If you had consulted \r\nme, I could have told you that falconers keep them covered six \r\nweeks, till they are completely tamed. But now, brother, let \r\nme for a certain time have the care of him, let me manage the \r\nunruly fellow; he shall soon, in consequence of the methods I \r\nshall use, be as tractable and submissive as a new-born puppy; \r\nsay then that you consent, I will pledge myself you shall not \r\nbe disappointed.\r\n\r\nYes, forsooth, said Fritz, but I shall not give you my eagle \r\nneither; it is mine, and I will not part with it to anyone; I \r\ncan bring it up myself, only tell me how; it will be very unkind \r\nnot to teach me the way—Father, is not Ernest very ungenerous \r\nto keep his management of eagles a secret, and wanting to bring \r\nit up himself?—Ernest, by the by, had signified his refusal by \r\na shake of the head.\r\n\r\nGently, gently, children, said I: Fritz, listen to a little moral \r\nfable. “A dog placed himself on a truss of straw, which he considered \r\nas his property. An ass and an ox extremely hungry entreated \r\npermission to eat some of it, as it could not serve him for food; \r\nbut the surly selfish cur would not even suffer them to approach \r\nit. Envious animal, said the ox, _eat thy straw, or permit it \r\nto be eaten by another;_ but the dog was deaf to their entreaties, \r\nand dismissed them with snarling selfishness.” Now tell me, boy, \r\nis not your conduct on this occasion similar to the selfish dog’s? \r\nYou know not how to tame your eagle, you a few minutes ago would \r\neven have inflicted death upon it, and now you refuse to give \r\nit to Ernest, who promises to bring it up, because you are envious \r\nof his knowing more than you do: as he has reflected more than \r\nyou on what he has read, it is but just he should wish to derive \r\nsome advantage from his reading and knowledge; you cannot do \r\nless than make him a civil offer of something for his secret, \r\nif you persist in not resigning your eagle. Should Ernest after \r\nthis, have the generosity to impart it without the reward, the \r\ngreater will be his merit, and I shall be pleased with you both.\r\n\r\nRight, father, replied Fritz briskly; well, I will give him my \r\nmonkey if he chooses to have it.—An eagle is a more noble and \r\nheroical animal; as I found it, I mean to keep it; but you will \r\nteach me to tame it? What say you, Ernest? Do you accept my offer?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—With all my heart; but I value the heroism you talk \r\nof, very little: I for my part prefer being learned; you shall be \r\nknight of the eagle if you think proper, and I your historiographer \r\nand poet. I will write a grand epic poem to record the splendid \r\ndeeds of the knight and his eagle.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Poor jeering this, master Ernest! but, no matter; take \r\nthe monkey, and teach me to tame my eagle: How shall I render \r\nit more docile and quiet?\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I have read somewhere that the Caribs puff tobacco-smoke \r\ninto the nostrils of the birds of prey and of the parrots they \r\ncatch, until they are giddy and almost senseless;—this stupefaction \r\nover, they are no longer wild and untractable.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—And this is the great witchcraft! Tobacco-smoke! it \r\nwas worth puffing off to be sure! Your secret is not equivalent \r\nto the property of my monkey, is it, Father?\r\n\r\nWhy not? If the bargain is fair, as I think it is, it should \r\nby all means hold good; if not, Ernest will not require any thing \r\nfor useless counsel; but I have reason to think well of the method, \r\nand therefore approve of it. Bees may be stupefied in the same \r\nmanner, so as to take them without resistance, or how could the \r\nhoney-comb be obtained? The notion I assure you, boys, is far \r\nfrom bad.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—Oh! then there is a way to hinder the naughty bees \r\nfrom stinging poor little boys who want just to taste their honey? \r\nGood papa, pray go and smoke awhile opposite that hole in the \r\ntree, and make these stinging gentry sleep long enough for us \r\nto take away at least half of their honey without being devoured \r\nby them.\r\n\r\nFritz having consented to the experiment, took some tobacco and \r\na pipe, of which we had found plenty in the sailors’ chests, \r\nand began to smoke, at the same time gradually approaching the \r\nunruly bird. As soon as it was somewhat composed, he replaced \r\nthe fillet over the eyes, and smoked close to its beak and nostrils \r\nso effectually, that it became motionless on the spot, and had \r\nthe exact air of a stuffed bird. Fritz thought it dead, and was \r\ninclined to be angry with his brother; but I told him it would \r\nnot hold on the perch if it were lifeless, and that its head \r\nalone was affected,—and so it proved. The favourite came to itself \r\nby degrees, and made no noise when its eyes were unbound; it \r\nlooked at us with an air of surprise, but void of fury, and grew \r\ntamer and calmer every day. The monkey was adjudged unanimously \r\nto Ernest, who took possession of it the same evening, and made \r\nit lie down near him. We all passed an excellent night in our \r\ngreen castle, and in our good beds, which we returned to with \r\nabundant satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. \r\n\r\n_Origin of some European fruit-trees.—Bees._\r\n\r\nWe commenced early the next day a business which we had long \r\ndetermined to engage in: it was to plant bamboos close to all \r\nthe young trees, to support them effectually in their growth. \r\nWe quitted our tree with great alertness, having our cart loaded \r\nwith canes and a large pointed iron to dig holes in the ground. \r\nWe left my wife this time with only her dear little Francis, \r\nrequesting them to prepare us a plentiful dinner, and to include \r\nthe palm-tree cabbage and the sago-macaroni mixed with some Dutch \r\ncheese; in addition to these performances, they volunteered the \r\nmelting some of the wax berries for our store of candles.\r\n\r\nWe did not take the buffalo with us, as I wished to give it a \r\nday’s rest for its nose to heal up; the cow was sufficient for \r\ndrawing the load of light bamboo canes. Before setting out, we \r\ngave the buffalo a few handfuls of salt, to ingratiate ourselves \r\nwith our horned companion; and this treat pleased him so highly, \r\nthat he showed by many signs his inclination of accompanying \r\nus; and to prevent this, we were compelled to fasten him securely \r\ntill we were out of sight.\r\n\r\nWe began our work at the entrance of the avenue which we had \r\nformed, and nearest to Falcon’s Stream. The walnut, chesnut, \r\nand cherry-trees we had planted in a regular line and at equal \r\ndistances, we found disposed to bend considerably to one side, \r\nseemingly as they had been directed by the wind. Being the strongest, \r\nI took the task of making holes with the implement, upon myself, \r\nwhich, as the soil was light, I easily performed, taking care \r\nto go deep enough to fix the stake firmly. In the mean time the \r\nboys selected the bamboos, cut them of equal lengths, and pointed \r\nthe ends to go into the ground. When they were well fixed, we \r\nthrew up the earth compactly about them, and fastened the saplings \r\nby the branches to them with some long, straight tendrils of a \r\nplant which we found near the spot. In the midst of our exertions we \r\nentered with much detail into a conversation respecting the culture \r\nof trees. Till then my boys had only thought of eating fruits, \r\nwithout giving themselves much trouble about their production; \r\nbut now their curiosity was excited, and they questioned me so \r\nclosely on the subject, that I was somewhat at a loss in answering \r\nthem. I communicated however, with pleasure, all within my knowledge: \r\nI perceived that the occasion was particularly favourable for \r\nrendering my lessons instructive and truly profitable, as the \r\noccupation we were engaged in gave me an opportunity to illustrate \r\nthe lesson by means of the objects before our eyes. I shall briefly \r\nrelate the summary of our discourse, which may be of use to young \r\npersons designed for an agricultural life.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Are the young trees that we have recently planted, and \r\njust propped up, wild or cultivated?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—A pretty question indeed! Do you imagine that trees are \r\ntamed like buffalos and eagles? You would perhaps teach them \r\nto stoop politely when we come to gather their fruit, to avoid \r\ngiving us the trouble of reaching to their branches.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—You suppose, friend Jack, that your speech is very witty, \r\nwhile in reality it is only nonsense. Do you think then that \r\nall created beings are brought up alike? If so, papa should punish \r\nthe first occurrence of ill behaviour in you, by passing a cord \r\nthrough your nose, like the buffalo, to render you more considerate \r\nand compliant.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—We should soon, if this plan were adopted, see brother \r\nJack with a bridle round his neck.\r\n\r\n_Father._—All of you, children, would be exposed to such discipline \r\nas this, if there were no other means: but the observation of \r\nFritz is perfectly just; men are not brought up like brutes, \r\nnor are brutes trained like plants, though the education of all \r\never tends to the same end—that of subjecting the will to the \r\nyoke of necessity and duty, and to make them walk upright: for \r\ndid not these trees bend to every wind till we raised and supported \r\nthem. Every creature is capable of improvement, if not susceptible \r\nof perfection, that is to say, with care and cultivation, every \r\nbeing may become better, and acquire virtues and qualities which, \r\nleft to himself and nature, he would be destitute of; thus I \r\nrender our buffalo, and you your jackal, tame and manageable, \r\nby making them feel the power of man over brutes; thus I strive, \r\nmy dear children, to lead you on towards perfection, by cultivating \r\nyour understanding, giving you, as far as I am able, good lessons \r\nand good examples; so these trees, which at first were mere wild \r\nstocks, produced from kernels or seeds, and bearing only small \r\nimperfect fruits, have been made to produce those of an excellent \r\nquality by grafting on them a superior species. Come here, examine \r\nthis branch; it is easy to see it has been inserted into this other \r\nbranch; all the rest were lopped away, and this alone preserved; \r\nthe whole of the sap or nutritious juice flowed then to this \r\npoint, and thence diffused itself; and thus the wild sapling \r\nis become a fine fruitful tree, producing as good fruit as that \r\nfrom which the graft was taken.—Such is the process of ingrafting.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—There are many things in it I do not yet understand; \r\nI have often heard of the inoculation of trees—is that the same \r\nas ingrafting them?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Nearly so; to _inoculate_ is, I believe, the appropriate \r\nterm for the operation, and _graft_ that for the branch, or part \r\ninserted. According to the different species of trees, different \r\nmethods and seasons are chosen; different terms are also adopted; \r\nand when the first insertion fails, a second, and even a third \r\nattempt is made.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Can good fruits be grafted on every kind of tree, such \r\nas firs, or oaks?\r\n\r\n_Father._—No, my son; trees of an homogeneous kind must be selected.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Ah! now that’s a fruit I am a stranger to; _homogeneous_—is \r\nit very good? are they to be found here? I long to taste them.\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is not a fruit, my dear child: it is, I confess, rather \r\ntoo learned a word, which I was wrong to use without explanation. \r\nIt is derived or comes from the Greek, and signifies _of the \r\nsame nature, or bearing great similitude;_ thus an apple, a pear, \r\na quince-tree, may be ingrafted on each other, because their \r\nwood and their seeds are homogeneous or resemble each other. \r\nIt is the same with a variety of fruits having stones and kernels; \r\nthe cherry, plum, peach, and almond-tree: to attempt to graft \r\nany of these on a pine or oak, would be useless; so with the \r\nbest education every man is not constituted to be learned, to \r\nform an artist or a general.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—You said, father, that the wild stocks or trees, produced \r\nonly from seed, bear but indifferent fruits; how is it, then, \r\nwith all those in our island—our good cocoas and guavas were \r\nnot grafted, as no gardeners or other persons were here to perform \r\nthe operation?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Your remark is just; but I spoke only of our fruit-trees \r\nin Europe, where, almost without exception, the fruits require \r\nto be meliorated by a better soil, ingrafting, and culture. No \r\ndoubt kind Providence has meant to indemnify these burning climes \r\nfor many inconveniences, in bestowing on them palm-trees and \r\nother agreeable fruits that grow spontaneously and without trouble \r\nor labour on the soil.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I comprehend all this: yet one thing puzzles me; how \r\nwere the scions and grafts of the best kinds first procured in \r\nEurope?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—What a question! From those who had them, certainly.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—And what a reply! I answer. And where did those from \r\nwhom they were obtained get them? I wish to know where the first \r\nbranches of the best species were had, before any persons had \r\nundertaken the husbandry of trees, or thought of ingrafting them. \r\nAll trees, I presume, were wild originally . . . . .  \r\n\r\n_Jack._—Indeed! . . . . . . What think you then of the terrestrial \r\nparadise? Do you not believe that excellent fruits of all kinds \r\nwere there? And might not the scions and grafts you are so puzzled \r\nabout, have been taken there to any number?\r\n\r\n_Father._—My dear young pupil, if you had read the Bible with \r\nattention, you would have seen that our father Adam was driven \r\nout of the terrestrial paradise for having eaten of one of those \r\ngoodly fruits, contrary to the positive prohibition of God; and \r\nas he and his wife Eve were then alone on the earth, none could \r\ngo and take grafts in that beautiful garden, which moreover was \r\nnot in Europe; therefore the inquiry of Ernest is just and sensible. \r\nGood fruit-trees are doubtless natives of some part of the earth, \r\nwhere they bear spontaneously, in their natural climate, as good \r\nfruits as those we raise in ours with care and art. Such trees \r\nwere torn from their native soil when young, and transplanted \r\ninto Europe, where, by the assiduous attentions of the gardener, \r\nthey prospered, and furnished grafts for their multiplication; for \r\nthe European climate is so little fitted to the natural production \r\nof good fruits, that the best tree, propagated from mere seed, \r\nsoon resumes the wild state, and requires to be grafted. Gardeners \r\nusually collect a number of tender shoots or saplings in an \r\ninclosure, which they first raise by seed and afterwards ingraft; \r\nthese inclosures are called nurseries, where such plants are \r\npurchased, and where all these shipped for our use were procured.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Do you know, father, the native country of all these \r\ntrees?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Of most of them, I think. The vine I have ventured \r\nto plant near our tree at Falcon’s Stream, grows only in the \r\ntemperate zone; it neither thrives in very cold countries nor \r\nunder the torrid zone, though it generally prefers the south \r\nto the north. The vine is of antient date; for we find in the \r\nBible that Noah was acquainted with the use of it. It seems then \r\nthat the vine is a native of Asia Minor and Armenia; and it appears \r\nto have been brought at a very remote period into Egypt, Greece, \r\nand most parts of Europe. The fabulous accounts in mythology \r\nof Bacchus, relate, no doubt, to the propagation of the vine. \r\nItaly probably received it from the emigrant Greeks and from \r\nthe Romans, who became masters of the known world; thence it \r\nwas carried into Gaul, Spain, Germany, and those parts of Switzerland \r\nin which it promised to thrive: perhaps the Phoenicians too had \r\npreviously transported it to some of the above mentioned countries.\r\n\r\n_The boys speaking together._—And the apple, pear, chesnut, walnut, \r\nalmond, peach, and mulberry-trees?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Patience, patience, prattlers! Can I tell you every thing \r\nin a breath? And pray speak one after the other, gentlemen.—Fruits \r\nwith shells or pods, such as the nut, almond, and chesnut, generally \r\ncalled _glands_ or _kernels_ by the Romans, come from the East; \r\nbut that is too general a term,—for the East being the quarter \r\nin which the sun rises, includes too many regions. Chesnuts were \r\ncalled by the antients _glandes Sardes_, from Syria, a province \r\nof Asia Minor, and they received their present name from a Grecian \r\ntown, near which they were cultivated in abundance. As to walnuts, \r\nthey were formerly named _glandes Jovis_, (_Jupiter’s acorns_ \r\nor _kernels_) by the Romans; they are originally from Persia, \r\nand were spread through Europe by the Roman conquests. The great \r\nfilberd-tree, bearing the Portugal nut or filberd, is originally \r\nfrom Pontus, a country of Asia Minor, and has been transplanted \r\nin the same way as the preceding. The origin of the almond-tree \r\nis uncertain; it is found wild in Asia and Africa: its fruit \r\nbore the name of _thalos_ in Greece, because it had been first \r\ntransplanted from an island of that name in the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—And cherries, papa,—cherries I like so much? Such quantities \r\nof them are in Switzerland, on the high roads and every where, \r\nthat I think them natives of my country.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Not so, my friend; but of all exotic fruits it is certainly \r\nthe one that thrives the most with us. They derived their name \r\nfrom _Cerasus_, another town of the Pontus already mentioned \r\nto you, and if I recollect right, the place is called _Chirisarda_. \r\nThe celebrated Roman general Lucullus, after his victory over \r\nMithridates king of Pontus, was the first who transported them \r\ninto Europe, seventy years before the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I have not read any thing about cherries in Eutropius, \r\nwhere I should have been glad to find some account of them.\r\n\r\n_Father._—I am of your opinion, Ernest, that historians would \r\nhave done as well to give the names of those who procured an \r\nagreeable fruit, as in recording the destroyers of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of instructive conversation we had got to the end of \r\nour alley of trees, which looked all the better for the uprightness \r\nwe had restored them to. This accomplished, we crossed Family \r\nBridge on our way to the southern plantation of trees, in order \r\nto raise and prop them also. We were delighted with the view \r\nof beautiful orange, citron, and pomegranate trees, that had \r\nall taken root and were thriving to our satisfaction, as well \r\nas the pistachio and mulberry trees. Some of these were in blossom, \r\nand inspired us with the most pleasing hope. We quickly set to \r\nwork, and my sons with increased curiosity renewed their inquiries \r\nconcerning the origin of these delicious fruits.\r\n\r\nAh! how charming the country must be where such fruits as these \r\ngrow spontaneously! exclaimed Fritz.\r\n\r\nConsidered as confined to this question only, said I, this country, \r\nno doubt, may be termed propitious; but in some other respects \r\nit has likewise its unfavourable side. All the fruits abounding \r\nwith acid and refreshing juices, are natives of the torrid or \r\nburning zone, or of parts of the temperate zone most adjacent \r\nto it; they seem to have been designed to cool the mass of blood, \r\nand keep off the inflammatory diseases so frequent in these climates. \r\nOrange and lemon trees are certainly, as I think, from Medea \r\nand Assyria; the Romans called them _mala Medica_, or Medean \r\napples; they were brought by the Persians to Albina, and thence \r\ninto Sicily and the island of Malta, where the best species of \r\norange trees is still found; they were afterwards transplanted to \r\nItaly, and in succession to many other parts of Europe. Pomegranates \r\nwere named _mala Punicea_, (_Punic apples_,) and doubtless were \r\nbrought by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians into the southern \r\nprovinces of Europe. I have no positive knowledge of the original \r\ngrowth of pistachios. You are now, children, tolerably well informed \r\non the subject of fruit trees.\r\n\r\n_All._—No no, dear father, since you have gone so far, and are \r\nso kind as not to be tired of instructing us, pray tell us the \r\nprimitive country of all the trees we have to straighten and \r\nprop; the description amuses us exceedingly.\r\n\r\nI am glad of it, and all I know is entirely at your service; \r\nbut hearing in this sudden and rapid succession, the species, \r\nqualities, and countries of such a variety of fruits, you will, \r\nI fear, overload your memory and forget the whole.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Pardon me, father, every one will recollect perfectly \r\nwhat relates to his favourite fruit, and we shall often talk \r\non the subject in our walks under the shade of the very trees \r\nso principally concerned.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Well, be it so! Thus it is in fact with all the sciences; \r\nwe do not easily forget what we wish to know, what is connected \r\nwith our desires and hopes;—propose your questions then, and \r\nI will answer you as fully as I am able.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Well then, father, from what part do olives come originally?\r\n\r\n_Father._—From Armenia and Palestine: Authors of antiquity say \r\nthat Hercules brought the first into Europe, and planted them \r\non Mount Olympus; they were gradually cultivated throughout Greece, \r\nand especially in the territory of Athens, whence they came into \r\nItaly, and from thence were spread over the south of France, \r\nand in Spain, where they are cultivated with the greatest care, \r\non account of the excellent oil which is extracted from them. \r\nFigs belong to the same native soil; they were brought from Lydia \r\nand the isle of Chios into the Archipelago, in the time of Cato \r\nthe Elder: they were transplanted into Gaul a long while after \r\nby the emperor Julian, who was previously prefect or governor \r\nof that Roman province. Peaches are from Persia, and were first \r\nnamed _mala Persica_ (_Persian apples_). In Pliny’s time, who \r\nlived under the emperor Vespasian, they were still a novelty \r\nin Italy: the family of apricots from Armenia came amongst the \r\nRomans about the same time.\r\n\r\nBut now let us go on to plums, your favourite fruit:—Whence do \r\nthey originate? Some of the inferior kinds are probably European; \r\nbut those of the finest qualities are from other parts: they \r\nhave reached us from Damascus, a town of Syria, from which their \r\nname is borrowed. In course of time the crusaders brought several \r\nspecies of them into Europe, and prunes most likely were among \r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYour favourite apples and pears now claim, I think, a few \r\nobservations. We find them first noticed in Greek authors, under the \r\ndenomination of _Peloponnesian fruits_; they were obtained from that \r\ncountry by the Romans; they found also several kinds of them in Syria \r\nand Alexandria. These two fruits, of all others offer the greatest \r\nvarieties, and no doubt several of them are the result of culture, \r\nor of the influence of soil and climate. It is in general a law \r\nof nature, that care and attentive management produce in the \r\nsame species a more considerable number of shades and varieties, \r\nthan is met with in the wild uncultivated state, in which much \r\nsameness prevails throughout. Man in the rude state of nature \r\nis nearly alike every where, and is destitute of those diversities \r\nof character that naturally unfold themselves in his civilized \r\ncondition. Every class of animals and plants, which man renders \r\nsubservient to his use by cultivation and due care, exhibits \r\nbeyond comparison greater differences in the same species, more \r\nvarieties, more families, than those which remain in their native \r\nstate, remote from and unaided by his fostering care:—it would \r\nappear as if Providence had thus meant to encourage and reward \r\nactivity and labour.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—But, father, you left off with the apples too soon; do \r\npray resume their history: I wish you may tell us they are of \r\nSwiss or German origin; they are so useful as a fruit, keep so \r\nwell through the winter, and may be eaten raw as well as dressed.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This refreshing fruit, my apple-eating boy, is not \r\na native of Switzerland or Germany, as you desire it should be, \r\nbut comes to us from more favoured climates; at least this is \r\nthe case with the best sorts of them. We have a number of wild pear \r\nand apple trees, the fruit of which is crabbed, harsh, and scarcely \r\neatable; whether they were so originally, or have degenerated, \r\nremains to be determined. As I have said, none of these valuable \r\nfruits are indigenous or native in the colder parts of Europe: \r\nyet this ungrateful and rough climate it is that operates on \r\nthe European so as to distinguish him from the inhabitants of \r\nthe other parts of the world, by his intelligence, his fitness \r\nfor toil, and his skill in agriculture. There exist abundant \r\nmeans and facilities for rendering man effeminate and indolent, but \r\nnecessity and want stimulate him to industry and useful inventions; \r\nand by these blessings the inconveniences of climate are amply \r\ncompensated.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—I dare say you are quite right, father;—but tell me where \r\nthen do apples come from?\r\n\r\n_Father._—From the eastern countries, my son; and it is to the \r\nvictories of the Romans we are indebted for some of the best \r\nkinds, which have been diversified by experiments, ingrafting, \r\nor in other words the influence of soil and labour and intelligence.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Quince and mulberry-trees are the last we have to inquire \r\nabout; and then, father, we will cease our importunities for \r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is almost time, I must confess. Mulberry-trees are \r\nin general from Asia; they have, I presume, been cultivated more \r\nfor the sake of their leaves, on which silkworms feed, than for \r\ntheir fruit: however, it cannot be denied that the juicy berry \r\nof the dark-coloured mulberry-tree merits to be held in some \r\nestimation, and the white-coloured, whose fruit is small and \r\nindifferent, contributes to the production of the finest silk. \r\nThe quince-tribe must have taken its name from the town of Cydonia \r\nin the isle of Crete; the Romans called them _pyrus Cydonæ_. \r\nOn the quince-tree may be most successfully grafted pear-trees \r\ndesigned to be afterwards planted as espaliers.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—But why is it thought right to stunt the growth of a \r\nfine tree, and force it to remain diminutive?\r\n\r\n_Father._—This, in several respects, is useful; wall-trees, being \r\nsheltered on one side, bear earlier and more choice fruits; it \r\nis easier to defend them from insects; their fruits are more \r\nconveniently gathered. The tree, giving less shade, is not so \r\ninjurious to the culinary plants that are near it.—Are not these \r\nsubstantial reasons?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Then I must ask, why are not all trees set in this way?\r\n\r\nThat would not be a judicious plan by any means; an espalier \r\ntakes up too much ground; besides, trees with high stems produce \r\nmore fruit, they form orchards; a crop of hay too may be raised under \r\nthem, whereas espaliers serve in general as fences or boundaries \r\nin gardens.\r\n\r\nThis is a compendium of our morning’s conversation, in the course \r\nof which we finished our work in the completest manner. Towards \r\nnoon, a keen appetite hastened our return to Falcon’s Stream, \r\nwhere we found an excellent and plentiful dinner prepared by \r\nour good and patient steward, of which the palm-tree cabbage \r\nwas the chief dish. We all agreed that to eat of a better or \r\nmore delicate food was impossible; and Ernest, who had procured \r\nit, received the thanks of all the board.\r\n\r\nWhen the sharpness of hunger was appeased, a new subject was \r\nintroduced which I and my wife had been seriously revolving for \r\nsome time; she found it difficult and even dangerous to ascend \r\nand descend our tree with a rope ladder: we never went there \r\nbut on going to-bed, and each time felt an apprehension that \r\none of the children, who scrambled up like cats, might make a \r\nfalse step and perhaps be lamed for ever. Bad weather might come \r\non and compel us for a long time together to seek an asylum in \r\nour aërial apartment, and consequently to ascend and descend \r\noftener.\r\n\r\nMy wife addressed me constantly on the subject, incessantly asking \r\nwhether my inventive genius could not suggest some easier and \r\nless perilous mode of getting to our dwelling. I smiled at her \r\nimplicit confidence that I could accomplish wonders: I assured \r\nher that if I were an enchanter or magician no desire of hers \r\nshould remain ungratified, and that with a single touch of my \r\nwand I would instantly produce for her a commodious firm stair-case \r\nof perfect workmanship; but that not being the case, I acknowledged \r\nmyself at a loss for the means to effect such an accommodation \r\nfor her: still her reiterated appeals and my own anxiety had \r\noften made me reflect if the thing were really possible? A stair-case \r\non the outside was not to be thought of, the considerable height \r\nof the tree rendered that impracticable, as I had nothing to \r\nrest it on, and should be at a loss to find beams to sustain \r\nit; but I had for some time formed the idea of constructing winding \r\nstairs within the immense trunk of the tree, if it should happen \r\nto be hollow, or I could contrive to make it so: Francis had \r\nexcited this idea in speaking of the bees.\r\n\r\nDid you not tell me, dear wife, said I, that there is a hole \r\nin the trunk of this enormous tree of ours, in which a swarm \r\nof bees is lodged?\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, answered she; it was there little Francis was \r\nso severely stung in attempting to thrust in a stick; look at \r\nit yourself, you will see the bees go in and come out in throngs.\r\n\r\nThen, replied I, we have only to examine how far this excavation \r\ngoes, whether it extends to the roots, and what the circumference \r\nof it is; this done, we shall have gained the first difficult \r\nstep in favour of our stair-case.\r\n\r\nAll my children seized the idea with ardour; they sprang up, and \r\nprepared themselves to climb the tops of the roots like squirrels, \r\nto succeed in striking at the trunk with axes, and to judge from \r\nthe sound how far it was hollow; but they soon paid dearly for \r\ntheir attempt: the whole swarm of bees, alarmed at the noise \r\nmade against their dwelling, issued forth, buzzing with fury, \r\nattacked the little disturbers, began to sting them, stuck to \r\ntheir hair and clothes, and soon put them to flight, bearing \r\nalong with them their enemies, and uttering lamentable cries. \r\nMy wife and I had some trouble to stop the course of this uproar, \r\nand cover their little wounds with fresh earth to allay the smart. \r\nJack, whose temper was on all occasions rash, had struck exactly \r\nupon the bees’ nest, and was more severely attacked by them than \r\nthe rest; it was necessary, so serious was the injury, to cover \r\nthe whole of his face with linen. The less active Ernest got up \r\nthe last, and was the first to run off when he saw the consequences, \r\nand thus avoided any further injury than a sting or two; but \r\nsome hours elapsed before the other boys could open their eyes \r\nor be in the least relieved from the acute pain that had been \r\ninflicted. When they grew a little better, the desire of being \r\navenged of the insects that had so roughly used them had the \r\nascendant in their minds: they teased me to hasten the measures \r\nfor getting every thing in readiness for obtaining possession \r\nof their honey. The bees in the mean time were still buzzing \r\nfuriously round the tree. I prepared tobacco, a pipe, some clay, \r\nchisels, hammers, &c. I took the large gourd long intended for \r\na hive, and I fitted a place for it by nailing a piece of board \r\non a branch of the tree; I made a straw roof for the top to screen \r\nit from the sun and rain; and as all this took up more time than \r\nI was aware of, we deferred the attack of the fortress to the \r\nfollowing day, and got ready for a sound sleep, which completed \r\nthe cure of my little wounded patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. \r\n\r\n_Victory over the bees;—winding stair-case; training of various \r\nanimals; divers manufactures; fountain, &c._\r\n\r\nNext morning almost before dawn all were up and in motion; the \r\nbees had returned to their cells, and I stopped the passages \r\nwith clay, leaving only a sufficient aperture for the tube of \r\nmy pipe. I then smoked as much as was requisite to stupefy without \r\nkilling the little warlike creatures. Not having a cap with a \r\nmask, such as bee-catchers usually wear, nor even gloves, this \r\nprecaution was necessary. At first a humming was heard in the \r\nhollow of the tree, and a noise like a gathering tempest, which \r\ndied away by degrees. All was become calm, and I withdrew my \r\ntube without the appearance of a single bee. Fritz had got up \r\nby me: we then began with a chisel and a small axe to cut out \r\nof the tree, under the bees’ hole of entrance, a piece three \r\nfeet square. Before it was entirely separated, I repeated the \r\nfumigation, lest the stupefaction produced by the first smoking \r\nshould have ceased, or the noise we had been just making revived \r\nthe bees. As soon as I supposed them quite lulled again, I separated \r\nfrom the trunk the piece I had cut out, producing as it were \r\nthe aspect of a window, through which the inside of the tree \r\nwas laid entirely open to view; and we were filled at once with \r\njoy and astonishment on beholding the immense and wonderful work \r\nof this colony of insects. There was such a stock of wax and \r\nhoney, that we feared our vessels would be insufficient to contain \r\nit. The whole interior of the tree was lined with fine honey-combs: \r\nI cut them off with care, and put them in the gourds the boys \r\nconstantly supplied me with. When I had somewhat cleared the \r\ncavity, I put the upper combs, in which the bees had assembled \r\nin clusters and swarms, into the gourd which was to serve as \r\na hive, and placed it on the plank I had purposely raised. I \r\ncame down, bringing with me the rest of the honey-combs, with \r\nwhich I filled a small cask, previously well washed in the stream. \r\nSome I kept out for a treat at dinner; and had the barrel carefully \r\ncovered with cloths and planks, that the bees, when attracted \r\nby the smell, might be unable to get at it. We then sat round \r\nthe table, and regaled ourselves plentifully with the delicious \r\nand odoriferous treat of the honey. Having finished our meal, \r\nmy wife put by the remainder; and I proposed to my sons to go \r\nback to the tree, in order to prevent the bees from swarming \r\nagain there on being roused from their stupor, as they would \r\nnot have failed to do, but for the precaution I took of passing \r\na board at the aperture, and burning a few handfuls of tobacco \r\non it, the smell and smoke of which drove them back from their \r\nold abode, whenever they attempted to return to it. At length \r\nthey desisted from approaching it, and became gradually reconciled \r\nto their new residence, where their queen no doubt had settled \r\nherself. I took this opportunity to relate to my children all \r\nI had read in the interesting work by Mr. Huber of Geneva[17] \r\nof the queen-bee, this beloved and respected mother of her subjects, \r\nwho are all her children, and who take care of and guard her, \r\nwork for her, nourish the rising swarms, make the cells in which \r\nthey are to lodge, prepare others of a different structure, as \r\nwell as nutriment for the young queens destined to lead forth the \r\nfresh colonies: and I entered into all those details which celebrated \r\nobservers, and particularly the one we have just mentioned, \r\nhave described so interestingly. These accounts highly entertained \r\nmy youthful auditory, who almost regretted having molested by \r\ntheir depredation the repose of a fine peaceable kingdom that \r\nhad flourished so long without interruption in the huge trunk. \r\nAs to me, it so well suited my intended stair-case, that I readily \r\nadopted the prevailing moral amongst conquerors, who dispense \r\nwith scruples when the seizing a country is convenient to their \r\npolicy, and I resolved to take full possession next day. In the \r\nmean time I advised all to watch during the night, over the whole \r\nprovision of honey obtained while the bees were torpid, who when \r\nrecovered would not fail to be troublesome, and come in legions \r\nto get back to their property. That we might not be ourselves \r\ninjured by so much fatigue, we went and threw ourselves on our \r\nbeds, and in our clothes, to take a short doze before the hour \r\nof retreat; we were lulled to sleep with their buzzing, which \r\nhad quite ceased when we awoke at the coming on of night; they \r\nhad remained quiet in the gourd or suspended in clusters from \r\nsome branches: without concerning ourselves about them, we went \r\npromptly to business; the cask of honey was emptied into a kettle, \r\nexcept a few prime combs which we kept for daily consumption; \r\nthe remainder mixed with a little water was set over a gentle \r\nfire and reduced to a liquid consistence, strained and squeezed \r\nthrough a bag, and afterwards poured back into the cask, which \r\nwas left upright and uncovered all night to cool. In the morning \r\nthe wax was entirely separated, and had risen to the surface \r\nin a compact and solid cake that was easily removed; beneath \r\nwas the purest, most beautiful and delicate honey that could \r\nbe seen: the cask was then carefully headed again, and put into \r\ncool ground near our wine vessels; and now we promised ourselves \r\nan abundant supply of an agreeable article for desserts. This \r\ntask accomplished, I mounted to revisit the hive, and found every \r\nthing in order; the bees going forth in swarms and returning \r\nloaded with wax, from which I judged they were forming fresh \r\nedifices in their new dwelling place. I was surprised to see \r\nthe numbers that had occupied the trunk of the tree find room \r\nin the gourd; but on looking round me, I perceived a part of \r\nthem collected in a cluster upon a branch, and I thence concluded \r\na young queen was amongst them.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving this, I procured another gourd, into which I shook \r\nthem and placed it by the former: thus I had the satisfaction \r\nof obtaining at an easy rate two fine hives of bees in activity.\r\n\r\nWe soon after these operations proceeded to examine the inside \r\nof the tree. I sounded it with a pole from the opening I had \r\nmade towards the top; and a stone fastened to a string served \r\nus to sound the bottom, and thus to ascertain the height and \r\ndepth of the cavity. To my great surprise the pole penetrated \r\nwithout any resistance to the branches on which our dwelling \r\nrested, and the stone descended to the roots. The trunk, it appeared, \r\nhad wholly lost its pith, and most of its wood internally; nothing \r\ntherefore was more practicable than to fix winding stairs in \r\nthis capacious hollow, that should reach from top to bottom. \r\nIt seems that this species of tree, like the willow in our climates, \r\nreceives nourishment through the bark; for it did not look decayed, \r\nand its far-extended branches were luxuriant and beautiful in \r\nthe extreme. I determined to begin our construction that very \r\nday. The undertaking appeared at first beyond our powers; but \r\nintelligence, patience, time, and a firm resolution vanquished \r\nall obstacles. We were not disposed to relax in any of these \r\nrequisites; and I was pleased to find opportunities to keep my \r\nsons in continual action, and their minds and bodies were all \r\nthe better for exertion. They grew tall, strong, and were too \r\nmuch engaged to regret, in ignoble leisure, any of their past \r\nenjoyments in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe began to cut into the side of the tree, towards the sea, a \r\ndoor-way equal in dimensions to the door of the captain’s cabin, \r\nwhich we had removed with all its frame-work and windows; by \r\nmeans of which we should at once be guarded against every attack \r\non that side. We next cleared away from the cavity all the rotten \r\nwood, and rendered the interior even and smooth, leaving sufficient \r\nthickness for cutting out resting-places for the winding stairs, \r\nwithout injuring the bark. I then fixed in the centre, the trunk \r\nof a tree ten or twelve feet high and a foot thick, completely \r\nstripped of its branches, in order to carry my winding staircase \r\nround it: on the outside of this trunk, and the inside of the \r\ncavity of our own tree, we formed grooves, so calculated as to \r\ncorrespond with the distances at which the boards were to be \r\nplaced to form the stairs. These were continued till I had got \r\nto the height of the trunk round which they turned. The window \r\nI had opened at the top to take out the honey gave light enough. \r\nI made a second aperture below, and a third above it, and thus \r\ncompletely lighted the whole ascent. I also effected an opening \r\nnear our room, that I might more conveniently finish the upper \r\npart of the stair-case. A second trunk was fixed upon the first, \r\nand firmly sustained with screws and transverse beams. It was \r\nsurrounded like the other with stairs cut slopingly; and thus \r\nwe happily effected the stupendous undertaking of conducting \r\nit to the level of our bed-chamber. Here I made another door \r\ndirectly into it; and I then found I could add nothing further \r\nto my design. If my staircase was not in strict conformity to \r\nthe rules of architecture, it at least answered the purpose it \r\nwas built for, that of conducting us with safety and shelter \r\nto our nocturnal residence. To render it more solid and agreeable, \r\nI closed the spaces between the stairs with plank. I then fastened \r\ntwo strong ropes, the one descending the length of the little \r\ntree, the other along the side of the large one, to assist in \r\ncase of slipping. I fixed the sash-windows taken from the captain’s \r\ncabin in the apertures we had made to give light to the stairs; \r\nand when the whole was complete, it was so pretty, solid, and \r\nconvenient, that we were never tired of going up and coming down \r\nit; and I fear I must add, for the sake of truth, with no small \r\nadmiration of our united talents. I must, however, candidly own, \r\nthat we succeeded in this arduous attempt by mere dint of efforts, \r\npatience, industry, and time; for it occupied us for several \r\nweeks together with no intermission. It more than once reminded \r\nme of the wise system of education of the philosopher of Geneva, \r\nJ. J. Rousseau; and particularly where he recommends that boys \r\nof all classes in society should learn a trade, and especially that \r\nof a carpenter. How happy should I have been in our circumstances \r\nto have known this trade myself, and to have taught it to my \r\neldest son! I cannot too earnestly exhort all fathers to put \r\ntheir sons in early possession of a resource which, though it \r\nmay not become of the first necessity, has, at all events, the \r\nadvantage of making a young man stronger, and more dexterous; \r\nof filling up many of the dangerous idle hours of ardent youth; \r\nand of being able, in maturer age, if it be unnecessary to work \r\nourselves, at least to overlook the workmen we employ. I am not \r\nan enthusiast for the system of Rousseau, though I admire his \r\nstyle and genius; yet if humanity were indebted to him for no \r\nmore than this sagacious counsel, and the felicity conferred \r\nby his maxims on early childhood, it would still suffice to make \r\nus love and consider him as a benefactor.\r\n\r\nBut our new acquisition of a handsome staircase did not exclusively \r\noccupy the whole of our time; as in our solitude we had nothing \r\nto consider but our own pleasure or convenience, and our daily \r\nwants were not subject to the occurrence of other social duties, \r\nwe saw no occasion for tormenting ourselves with a greater degree \r\nof labour in every day than was wholesome for our bodily health. \r\nWe had no harsh surveyor, no inquisitive examiners; no troublesome \r\nneighbours nor counsellors. If we occasionally regretted not \r\nbeing members of a large society under just laws and agreements \r\nestablished between societies of men, we more frequently complimented \r\nourselves on not being subjected to this restraint and the \r\ninconveniences that arise from it. If we happened now and then to \r\nfeel the want of some of the high-wrought pleasures of social \r\nexistence, we were speedily solaced by reflecting that we did not \r\nstand in need of money; that we had no uneasy care about the \r\nacquisition of it; that we excited neither envy, pity, nor censure; \r\nwhile the imperfection of our achievements, and the trouble they cost \r\nus, were richly compensated by the freedom and cheerfulness with \r\nwhich they were executed, ever without altercation, and with \r\nunited hearts and souls.\r\n\r\nI will briefly narrate the few remarkable occurrences that took \r\nplace during the construction of our staircase.\r\n\r\nA few days after the commencement of our stair-case, the two \r\nshe-goats gave us two kids, and our ewes five lambs; so that \r\nwe now saw ourselves in possession of a pretty flock: but lest \r\nthe domestic animals should follow the example of the ass, and \r\nrun away from us, I tied a bell to the neck of each. We had found \r\na sufficient number of bells in the vessel, which had been shipped \r\nfor trading with the savages; it being one of the articles they \r\nmost value. We could now immediately trace a deserter by the \r\nsound, and bring it back to the fold.\r\n\r\nNext to the winding stairs, my chief occupation was the management \r\nof the young buffalo, whose wound in the nose was quite healed, \r\nso that I could lead it at will with a cord or stick passed through \r\nthe orifice, as the Caffrarians do. I preferred the latter, which \r\nanswered the purpose of a bit; and I resolved to break-in this \r\nspirited beast for riding as well as drawing. It was already \r\nused to the shafts, and very tractable in them; but I had more \r\ntrouble in inuring him to the rider, and to wear a girth, having \r\nmade one out of the old buffalo’s hide. I formed a sort of saddle \r\nwith sail-cloth, and tacked it to the girth. Upon this I fixed \r\na burthen, which I increased progressively. I was indefatigable \r\nin the training of the animal, and soon brought it to carry, \r\nwithout fear or repugnance, large bags full of potatoes, salt, \r\nand other articles, such as the ass had patiently borne to be \r\nloaded with. The monkey was his first rider, who stuck so close \r\nto the saddle, that in spite of the plunging and kicking of the \r\nbuffalo, it was not thrown. Francis was then tried, as the lightest \r\nof the family; but throughout his excursion I led the beast with \r\na halter, that it might not throw the child off. Jack now showed \r\nsome impatience to mount the animal in his turn. Some restraint \r\nwas requisite:—I passed the appropriate piece of wood through \r\nthe buffalo’s nose, and tied strong packthread at each end of \r\nthe stick, bringing them together over the neck of the animal; \r\nand I then put this new-fashioned bridle into the hands of the \r\nyoung rider, directing him how to use it. For a time the lad \r\nkept his saddle, notwithstanding the repeated jumps of the horned \r\nsteed; at length a side jolt threw him on the sand, without his \r\nreceiving much injury. Ernest, Fritz, and lastly myself, got \r\non successively, with more or less effect. His trotting shook \r\nus to the very centre, the rapidity of his gallop turned us giddy, \r\nand our lessons in horsemanship were reiterated many days before \r\nthe animal was tamed, and could be rode with either safety or \r\npleasure. At last, however, we succeeded without any serious \r\naccident; and the strength and swiftness of our saddled buffalo \r\nwere prodigious. It seemed to sport with the heaviest loads. \r\nMy three eldest boys mounted it together now and then, and it ran \r\nwith them with the swiftness of lightning. By continued attentions \r\nit at length became extremely docile: it was not in the least \r\napt to start; and I really felt satisfaction in being thus enabled \r\nto make my sons expert riders, so that if they should ever have \r\nhorses, they might get on the most restive and fiery without \r\nany fear:—none could be compared to our young buffalo; and the ass \r\nwhich I had intended to employ in the same way was far surpassed by \r\nthis new member of our family. Fritz and Jack, with my instructions, \r\namused themselves in training the animal as horses are exercised \r\nin a riding-house; and by means of the little stick through the \r\nnose, they were able to do what they pleased with him.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this Fritz did not neglect his eagle; he \r\ndaily shot some small birds which he gave it to eat, placing \r\nthem sometimes betwixt the buffalo’s horns, sometimes on the \r\nback of one of the hens, or of a flamingo, or on a shelf, or \r\nat the end of a stick, in order to teach it to pounce like a \r\nfalcon upon other birds. He taught it to perch on his wrist whenever \r\nhe called or whistled to it; but some time elapsed before he \r\ncould trust it to soar without securing its return by a long \r\nstring, apprehending its bold and wild nature would prompt it \r\nto take a distant and farewell flight from us.\r\n\r\nOur whole company, including even the inert Ernest, was infected \r\nwith the passion of becoming instructors. Ernest tried his talents \r\nin this way with his monkey; who, it must be confessed, seldom \r\nfailed to furnish him with work. It was no poor specimen of the \r\nludicrous to see the lad; he whose movements were habitually \r\nslow and studied, now constrained to skip, and jump, and play \r\na thousand antics with his pupil during training hours, and all \r\nthe time deeply interested in carrying forward the lesson the \r\ngrotesque mimic was condemned to learn, of carrying small loads, \r\nclimbing the cocoa-trees, and to fetch and bring the nuts. He \r\nand Jack made a little hamper of rushes, very light: they put \r\nthree straps to it, two of which passed under the fore, and one \r\nbetween the hind legs of the animal, and were then fastened to \r\na belt in front, to keep the hamper steady on the back of the \r\nmischievous urchin. This apparatus was at first intolerable to \r\npoor Knips: he gnashed his teeth, rolled on the ground, jumping \r\nlike a mad creature, and did every thing to get rid of it; but \r\nall in vain, for education was the standing order, and he soon \r\nfound he must submit. The hamper was left on day and night; its \r\nsole food was what was thrown into it; and in a short time pug \r\nwas so much accustomed to the burden, that he began to spit and \r\ngrowl whenever we attempted to take it off, and every thing given \r\nto the creature to hold was instantly thrown into it. Knips became \r\nat length a useful member of our society; but he would only obey \r\nErnest, whom he at once loved and feared, thus affording a proof \r\nof at least one of the great ends of all instruction. Jack was \r\nless successful with his little jackal, which he had named _Hunter_, \r\nhoping that its qualities would justify the name. He made continual \r\nattempts to induce the animal to go after game; but for the first \r\nsix months he advanced no further in the lesson than teaching \r\nhim to bring what was thrown to it: and when it was dead game, \r\nHunter was sure to devour it on the way, and to bring home the \r\nskin alone: but it was nevertheless so pretty and tractable a \r\ncreature, that I intreated the boy not to relinquish a task that \r\nwould prove so beneficial to us; and he persevered with considerable \r\nzeal.\r\n\r\nThese different occupations filled up several hours of the day; \r\nwhen, after working at our stairs, we assembled in the evening \r\nround our never-failing constant friend, the good mother, to \r\nrest ourselves: and forming a little circle, every individual \r\nof which was affectionate and cheerful, it was her turn to give \r\nus some agreeable and less fatiguing occupation in the domestic \r\nconcerns of Falcon Stream: such, for example, as endeavouring \r\nto improve our candle-manufactory, by blending the berry and \r\nthe bees-wax, and employing the reed-moulds invented by Jack: \r\nbut having found some difficulty in taking out the candles when \r\ncold, I adopted the plan of dividing the moulds, cleaning the \r\ninside, and rubbing it over with a little butter, to prevent \r\nthe wax from adhering to it; then to rejoin both halves with a \r\nband that could be loosened at pleasure, to facilitate the extraction \r\nof the tapers. The wicks gave us most trouble, as we had no cotton. \r\nWe tried with moderate success the fibrous threads of the karatta, \r\nand those of the algava or flame-wood; but each had the inconvenience \r\nof becoming a sort of coal or cinder. The production which gave \r\nus the most satisfaction was the pith of a species of elder; \r\nbut it did not, however, lessen our desire to discover the only \r\nappropriate ingredient, the cotton-tree. I likewise contrived \r\na method of rendering our candles even and shining, by rolling \r\nthem between two boards; they now were only distinguishable from \r\nthose of Europe by a greenish hue. On my observing to my sons \r\nthat wax was bleached like linen, by spreading it on cloths, \r\nand exposing it to the dew and sun, they wished to try the process; \r\nbut as our green tapers burned remarkably well, bleaching the \r\nwax would have been a useless luxury and loss of time, which \r\nI could turn to more account in manufacturing our impenetrable \r\nboots without seams, of the caoutchouc or elastic gum.\r\n\r\nI began with a pair for myself; and I encouraged my children \r\nto afford a specimen of their industry, by trying to form some \r\nflasks and cups that could not break. They commenced by making \r\nsome clay moulds, which they covered with layers of gum, agreeably \r\nto the instructions I had given them.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile I compactly filled a pair of stockings with \r\nsand, and covered them with a layer of clay, which I first dried \r\nin the shade, and afterwards in the sun. I then took a sole of \r\nbuffalo-leather, well beaten, and studded round with tacks, which \r\nserved me to fix it under the foot of the stocking; and after \r\nthis I poured the liquid gum into all the interstices, which \r\non drying produced a close adhesion between the leather and stocking \r\nsole. I next proceeded to smear the whole with a coat of resin \r\nof a tolerable thickness; and as soon as this layer was dried \r\non, I put on another, and so on till I had spread on a sufficiency \r\nwith my brush. After which I emptied the sand, drew out the stocking, \r\nremoved the hardened clay, shook off the dust, and thus obtained \r\na pair of seamless boots, as finished as if made by the best \r\nEnglish workman; being pliant, warm, soft, smooth, and completely \r\nwater-proof.\r\n\r\nI hung them up directly, that they might dry without shrinking. \r\nThey fitted uncommonly well; and my four lads were so highly \r\npleased with their appearance, that they skipped about with joy \r\nin requesting me to make each of them a pair. I refrained from \r\nany promise, because I wished to ascertain their strength previously, \r\nand to compare them with boots made out of mere buffalo-leather. \r\nOf these I at once began a pair for Fritz, with a piece of the \r\nslaughtered buffalo’s skin. They gave far more trouble than those \r\nmanufactured with the caoutchouc, which I used to cover the seams \r\nand render them less pervious to water. The work turned out very \r\nimperfect, and so inferior to my incomparable boots, that Fritz \r\nwore them reluctantly; and the more so, as his brothers shouted \r\nwith laughter at the difficulty he had to run in them. My boys \r\nhad succeeded tolerably well with their new ware, though still \r\nimperfect; but as a first essay performed by tyro artists, I \r\nwas satisfied with their productions.\r\n\r\nWe had also been engaged in the construction of our fountain, \r\nwhich afforded a perpetual source of pleasure to my wife, and \r\nindeed to all of us. In the upper part of the stream we built with \r\nstakes and stones a kind of dam, that raised the water sufficiently \r\nto convey it into the palm-tree troughs; and afterwards, by means \r\nof a gentle slope, to glide on contiguous to our habitation, \r\nwhere it fell into the tortoise-shell bason, which we had elevated \r\non stones to a certain height for our convenience; and it was \r\nso contrived that the redundant water passed off through a cane \r\npipe fitted to it. I placed two sticks athwart each other for \r\nthe gourds, that served as pails, to rest on; and we thus produced, \r\nclose to our abode, an agreeable fountain, delighting with its \r\nrill, and supplying us with a pure crystal fluid, and such as \r\nwe frequently could not get when we drew our water from the bed \r\nof the river, which was often blended with the leaves and earth \r\nfallen into it, or rendered turbid by our water-fowls. The only \r\ninconvenience was, that the water flowing in this open state \r\nthrough narrow channels in a slender stream, was heated, and \r\nnot refreshing when it reached us. I resolved to obviate this \r\ninconvenience at my future leisure, by employing, instead of \r\nthe uncovered conduits, large bamboo-canes fixed deep enough \r\nin the ground to keep the water cool. In waiting the execution \r\nof this design, we felt pleasure in the new acquisition; and \r\nFritz, who had suggested the notion, received his tribute of \r\npraise from all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. \r\n\r\n_The wild ass;—difficulty in breaking it;—the heath-fowl’s nest._\r\n\r\nWe were scarcely up one morning, and had got to work in putting \r\nthe last hand to our winding stair-case, when we heard at a distance \r\ntwo strange peculiar kind of voices, that resembled the howlings \r\nof wild beasts, mixed with hissings and sounds of some creature \r\nat its last gasp, which I was at a loss to explain, and I was \r\nnot without uneasiness; our dogs too pricked up their ears, and \r\nseemed to whet their teeth for a sanguinary combat with a dangerous \r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nFrom their looks we judged it prudent to put ourselves in a state \r\nof defence; we loaded our guns and pistols, placed them together \r\nwithin our castle in the tree, and prepared to repel vigourously \r\nany hostile attack from that quarter. The howlings having ceased \r\nan instant, I descended from our citadel, well armed, and put \r\non our two faithful guardians their spiked collars and side-guards: \r\nI assembled our cattle about the tree to have them in sight, \r\nand I reascended to look around for the enemy’s approach. Jack \r\nwished they might be lions—I should like, said he, to have a \r\nnear view of the king of beasts, and should not be in the least \r\nafraid of him, for lions are deemed generous!\r\n\r\nI do not advise you, answered I, to trust the report, though \r\nyou may not fear a lion when elevated as you are forty feet above \r\nthem: but these are not lions; their roarings are more lengthened, \r\nmajestic, and fill all other animals that hear them with fear \r\nand trembling; I do not observe this effect amongst ours.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—I rather surmise they are a troop of jackals, disposed \r\nto avenge the death of their comrades.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—It is not the jackal’s cry: I am more inclined to fear \r\nthey are hyenas, whose howling must, one would think, be as frightful \r\nas their looks.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—Now I think they are savages come to eat their prisoners \r\non our island; I wish we could save them, and get a good _Man \r\nFriday_ as Robinson Crusoe did.\r\n\r\nWhatever it is, children, let us not yield to fear or imagination; \r\nwe are in safety here . . .\r\n\r\nAt this very instant the howlings were renewed and quite close \r\nto us. Fritz got as near the spot as he could, listened attentively \r\nand with eager looks, then threw down his gun and burst into \r\na loud laughter, exclaiming: Father, it is our ass—the deserter \r\ncomes back to us, chanting the hymn of return: listen! do you \r\nnot hear his melodious brayings in all the varieties of the gamut?—We \r\nlent an ear; our doubts ceased, and we felt somewhat mortified \r\nat our premature alarms and preparations of defence against such \r\nan ignoble foe.\r\n\r\nI on my part, however, was soon reconciled to the offence against \r\nour pride, since it also insured our safety: and a fresh roar, \r\nin sounds unquestionable, raised loud peals of laughter among \r\nus; and then followed the usual train of jests and mutual banter \r\nat the alarm we had one and all betrayed. Shortly after, we had \r\nthe satisfaction of seeing among the trees our old friend Grizzle, \r\nmoving towards us leisurely, and stopping now and then to browse; \r\nbut to our great joy we perceived in his train one of the same \r\nspecies of very superior beauty, and when it was nearer I knew \r\nit to be a fine onagra[18] or wild ass, which I conceived a strong \r\ndesire to possess, though at the same time aware of the extreme \r\ndifficulty there would be in taming and rendering him subject \r\nto the use of man. Some writers who have described it under the \r\nname of the _Œigitai_, (or long-eared horse,) given it by the \r\nTartars, affirm that the taming it has been ever found absolutely \r\nimpracticable; but my mind furnished an idea on the subject which \r\nI was resolved to act on, if I got possession of the handsome \r\ncreature. Without delay I descended the ladder with Fritz, desiring \r\nhis brothers to keep still; and I consulted my privy-counsellor \r\non the means of surprising and taking the stranger captive. I \r\ngot ready, as soon as possible, a long cord with a running knot, \r\none end of which I tied fast to the root of a tree; the noose \r\nwas kept open with a little stick slightly fixed in the opening \r\nso as to fall of itself on the cord being thrown round the neck \r\nof the animal, whose efforts to escape would draw the knot closer. \r\nI also prepared a piece of bamboo about two feet long, which \r\nI split at the bottom, and tied fast at top, to serve as nippers. \r\nFritz attentively examined my contrivance, without seeing the use \r\nof it. Prompted by the impatience of youth, he took the ball-sling \r\nand proposed aiming at the wild ass with it, which he said was \r\nthe shortest way of proceeding. I declined adopting this Patagonian \r\nmethod, fearing the attempt might fail, and the beautiful creature \r\navail itself of its natural velocity to evade us beyond recovery: \r\nI therefore told him my project of catching it in the noose, \r\nwhich I gave him to manage, as being nimbler and more expert \r\nthan myself. The two asses drew nearer and nearer to us. Fritz, \r\nholding in his hand the open noose, moved softly on from behind \r\nthe tree where we were concealed, and advanced as far as the \r\nlength of the rope allowed him: the onagra was extremely startled \r\non perceiving a human figure; it sprung some paces backward, \r\nthen stopped as if to examine the unknown form; but as Fritz \r\nnow remained quite still, the animal resumed its composure and \r\ncontinued to browse. Soon after he approached the old ass, hoping \r\nthat the confidence that would be shown by it, would raise a \r\nsimilar feeling in the stranger: he held out a handful of oats \r\nmixed with salt; our ass instantly ran up to take its favourite \r\nfood, and greedily devoured it; this was quickly perceived by \r\nthe other. It drew near, raised its head, breathed strongly and \r\ncame up so close, that Fritz, seizing the opportunity, succeeded \r\nin throwing the rope round its neck; but the motion and stroke \r\nso affrighted the beast that it instantly sprang off; it was \r\nsoon checked by the cord, which in compressing the neck almost \r\nstopped its breath: it could go no further, and after many exhausting \r\nefforts, it sunk panting for breath upon the ground. I hastened \r\nto loosen the cord and prevent its being strangled. I then quickly \r\nthrew our ass’s halter over its head; I fixed the nose in my \r\nsplit cane, which I secured at the bottom with packthread. Thus \r\nI succeeded in subduing the first alarm of this wild animal, \r\nas farriers shoe a horse for the first time. I wholly removed \r\nthe noose that seemed to bring the creature into a dangerous \r\nsituation; I fastened the halter with two long ropes to two roots \r\nnear us, on the right and left, and let the animal recover itself, \r\nnoticing its actions, and devising the best way to tame it in \r\nthe completest manner.\r\n\r\nThe rest of my family had by this time come down from the tree \r\nand beheld the fine creature with admiration, its graceful shape \r\nand well-turned limbs, which placed it so much above the ass, \r\nand nearly raised it to the noble structure of the horse! In \r\na few moments the onagra got up again, struck furiously with \r\nits foot, and seemed resolved to free itself from all bonds: \r\nbut the pain of its nose, which was grasped and violently squeezed \r\nin the bamboo, forced it to lie down again. My eldest son and \r\nI now gently undid the cords, and half led, half dragged it between \r\ntwo roots closely connected, to which we fastened it afresh so \r\nas to give the least scope for motion, and thus, render its escape \r\nimpracticable, whilst it enabled us to approach securely and \r\nexamine the valuable capture we had made. We also guarded against \r\nmaster Grizzle playing truant again, and tied him fast with a \r\nnew halter, confining its fore legs with a rope. I then fastened \r\nit and the wild ass side by side, and put before both plenty \r\nof good provender to solace their impatience of captivity.\r\n\r\nWe had now the additional occupation of training the onagra for \r\nour service or our pleasure as might turn out to be most practicable: \r\nmy boys exulted in the idea of riding it, and we repeatedly \r\ncongratulated each other on the good fortune which had thus resulted \r\nfrom the flight of our ass. Yet I did not conceal that we should have \r\nmany difficulties to encounter in taming it, though it seemed \r\nvery young and not even to have reached its full growth. But \r\nI was inclined to think proper means had not been hitherto adopted, \r\nand that the hunters, almost as savage as the animals themselves, \r\nhad not employed sufficient art and patience, being probably \r\nunconscious of the advantages of either. I therefore determined \r\nto resort to all possible measures: I let the nippers remain \r\non its nose, which appeared to distress him greatly, though we \r\ncould plainly perceive their good effect in subduing the creature, \r\nfor without them no one could have ventured to approach him; \r\nI took them off however at times when I gave it food, to render \r\neating easier, and I began, as with the buffalo, by placing a bundle \r\nof sail-cloth on its back to inure it to carry. When accustomed \r\nto the load, I strove to render the beast still by degrees more \r\ndocile, by hunger and thirst; and I observed with pleasure that \r\nwhen it had fasted a little and I supplied it with food, its \r\nlook and actions were less wild. I also compelled the animal \r\nto keep erect on its four legs, by drawing the cords closer that \r\nfastened it to the roots, in order to subdue gradually by fatigue \r\nits natural ferocity. The children came in turns to play with \r\nit and scratch its ears gently, which were remarkably tender; \r\nand it was on these I resolved to make my last trial if all other \r\nendeavours failed. For a long time we despaired of success; the \r\nonagra made furious starts and leaps when any of us went near \r\nit, kicked with its hind feet, and even attempted to bite those \r\nwho touched it. This obliged me to have recourse to a muzzle, \r\nwhich I managed with rushes, and put on when it was not feeding. \r\nTo avoid being struck by its hind feet, I partially confined \r\nthem by fastening them to the fore feet with cords, which however \r\nI left moderately loose, that we might not encroach too much upon \r\nthe motion necessary for its health. It was at length familiarized \r\nto this discipline, and was no longer in a rage when we approached, \r\nbut grew less impatient daily, and bore to be handled and stroked.\r\n\r\nAt last we ventured to free it by degrees from its restraints \r\nand to ride it as we had done with the buffalo, still keeping \r\nthe fore feet tied; but notwithstanding this precaution and every \r\npreceding means, it proved as fierce and unruly as ever for the \r\nmoment. The monkey, who was first put on its back, held on pretty \r\nwell by clinging to its mane, from which it was suspended as \r\noften as the onagra furiously reared and plunged; it was therefore \r\nfor the present impracticable for either of my sons to get upon \r\nit. The perverse beast baffled all our efforts, and the perilous \r\ntask of breaking it was still to be persevered in with terror \r\nand apprehension. In the stable it seemed tolerably quiet and \r\ngentle; but the moment it was in any degree unshackled, it became \r\nwholly ferocious and unmanageable.\r\n\r\nI was at length reduced to my last expedient, but not without \r\nmuch regret, as I resolved, if it did not answer, to restore \r\nthe animal to full liberty. I tried to mount the onagra, and \r\njust as in the act of rearing up violently to prevent me, I seized \r\nwith my teeth one of the long ears of the enraged creature, and \r\nbit it till it bled; instantly it stood almost erect on its hind \r\nfeet, motionless, and as stiff as a stake; it soon lowered itself \r\nby degrees, while I still held its ear between my teeth. Fritz \r\nseized the moment and sprung on its back; Jack, with the help \r\nof his mother, did the same, holding by his brother, who, on \r\nhis part, clung to the girth. When both assured me they were \r\nfirmly seated, I let go the ear: the onagra made a few springs \r\nless violent than the former, and checked by the cords on its \r\nfeet, it gradually submitted, began to trot up and down more \r\nquietly, and ultimately grew so tractable that riding it became \r\none of our chief pleasures. My lads were soon expert horsemen; \r\nand their horse, though rather long-eared, was very handsome \r\nand well broken in. Thus patience on our parts conquered a serious \r\ndifficulty, and gained for us a proud advantage.\r\n\r\nIn the name of goodness, said my wife to me one evening, after one of \r\nour first essays, where did you learn this strange notion of biting \r\nthe animal’s ear? I learned it, replied I, from a horse-breaker \r\nwhom I fell in with by chance: he had lived long in America and \r\ncarried on the skin-trade with the savages, to whom he took in \r\nexchange various European goods. He employed in these journeys, \r\nhalf-tamed horses of the southern provinces of that country, \r\nwhich are caught in snares or with nooses. They are at first \r\nunruly and resist burthens, but as soon as the hunter bites one \r\nof their ears they become mild and submissive; and they become \r\nso docile, that any thing may be done with them. The journey \r\nis continued through forests and over heaths to the dwellings \r\nof the savages; skins are given in barter for the goods brought \r\nthem, with which the horses are re-loaded. They set out again \r\non their return, and are directed by the compass and stars to \r\nthe European settlements, where they profitably dispose of their \r\nskins and horses.—Till now I thought this singular mode of taming \r\na wild beast fabulous, but the young onagra convinces me of the \r\ntruth of the accounts I heard. In a few weeks the onagra was \r\nso effectually tamed, that we all could mount it without fear: \r\nI still however kept his two fore legs confined together with \r\nthe cord, to moderate the extreme swiftness of its running. In \r\nthe room of a bit, I contrived a curb, and with this and a good \r\nbite applied, as wanted, to the ear, it went to right or left \r\nat the will of the rider. Now and then I mounted it myself, and \r\nnot without an emotion of pride at my success in subduing an \r\nanimal that had been considered by travellers and naturalists \r\nas absolutely beyond the power of man to tame. But how superior \r\nwas my gratification in seeing Fritz spring at any time on the \r\ncreature’s back and do what he pleased with it, drive along our \r\navenue like lightning, in depicting to my fond imagination that \r\neven on a desert unknown island, I could qualify my dear children \r\nto re-enter society and become in such respects its ornament! \r\nin beholding their physical strength and native graces unfold \r\nthemselves, and these keeping pace with the improvement of their \r\nintelligence and their judgement; and in anticipating that, buried \r\nas they were in a distant retreat, far from the tumult of the \r\nworld, and all that excites the passions, their sentiments would \r\nbe formed in exact conformity to the paternal feelings of my \r\nheart! I had not lost hope that we should one day return to Europe \r\nin some vessel chance might throw on our coast, or even with \r\nthe aid of our pinnace; but I felt at the same time, and my wife \r\nstill more, that we should not leave the island without a lively \r\nregret, and I determined to pursue my arrangements as if we were \r\nto close existence on a spot where all around us prospered.\r\n\r\nDuring the training of our horse, which we named _Light-foot_, \r\na triple brood of our hens had given us a crowd of little feathered \r\nbeings; forty of these, at least, were chirping and hopping about \r\nus, to the great satisfaction of my wife, whose zealous care \r\nof them sometimes made me smile. Most women’s hearts are so imbued \r\nwith maternal love as to excite in them a fondness for whatever \r\nbears a similitude to infancy. Thus, my admirable partner, far \r\nfrom complaining of the trouble such a number of young chickens \r\ngave her, took delight in it, and was constantly admiring them; \r\nyet her care and admiration did not prevent her appropriating \r\na part of them to the table, and sending the remainder in small \r\ncolonies to feed and breed in the desert, where we could find \r\nthem as they were wanted for our use.\r\n\r\nHere, she said, are animals of real utility in a family, far \r\nbeyond your monkeys, jackals, and eagles, that do nothing but \r\neat, and are unfit to be eaten. The buffalo was not found fault \r\nwith, because it brought her the provisions, nor the onagra, \r\non which she liked to see her sons gallop. From the time we had \r\ntrained it to this, the rough-paced buffalo that shook us to \r\npieces was no longer used for riding, but kept entirely for drawing.\r\n\r\nThis increase of our poultry reminded us of the necessity of \r\nan undertaking we had long thought of, and was not in prudence \r\nto be deferred any longer; this was the building between the \r\nroots of our great tree, covered sheds for all our bipeds and \r\nquadrupeds. The rainy season, which is the winter of these countries, \r\nwas drawing near, and to avoid losing most of our stock it was \r\nrequisite to shelter it.\r\n\r\nWe began by forming a kind of roof above the arched roots of \r\nour tree, and employed bamboo canes for the purpose; the longest \r\nand strongest supported the roofing in the place of columns, \r\nthe smaller more closely united and composed the roof itself. \r\nI filled up the interstices with moss and clay, and I spread \r\nover the whole a thick coat of tar. By these means I formed a \r\ncompact and solid covering, capable of bearing pressure. I then \r\nmade a railing round it, which gave the appearance of a pretty \r\nbalcony, under which, between the roots, were various stalls \r\nsheltered from rain and sun, that could be easily shut and separated \r\nfrom each other by means of planks nailed upon the roots; part \r\nof them were calculated to serve as a stable and yard, part as \r\nan eating-room, a store-room, &c., and as a hay-loft to keep \r\nour hay and provisions dry in.\r\n\r\nThis work was soon completed; but afterwards it was necessary \r\nto fill these places with stores of every kind for our supply \r\nthroughout the wet season. In this task we engaged diligently, \r\nand went daily here and there with our cart to collect every \r\nthing useful, and that might give us employment whilst the weather \r\nconfined us to the house.\r\n\r\nOne evening on our return from digging up potatoes, as our cart \r\nloaded with bags, drawn by the buffalo, ass and cow, was gently \r\nrolling along, seeing still a vacant place in the vehicle, I \r\nadvised my wife to go home with the two youngest boys whilst \r\nI went round by the wood of oaks with Ernest and Fritz to gather \r\nas many sweet acorns as we could find room for. We had still \r\nsome empty sacks. Ernest was accompanied by his monkey, who seldom \r\nleft him; and Fritz, horseman like, was on his dear onagra, which \r\nhe had appropriated to himself, inasmuch as he had helped to \r\ntake and tame it, and indeed because he knew how to manage it \r\nbetter than his brothers. Ernest was too lazy, and preferred \r\nwalking at ease with the monkey on his shoulder, and the more \r\nso because it spared him the trouble of gathering fruit. Jack \r\nwas too giddy to be trusted alone on the horse, though he often \r\ngot up behind his brother, and Francis still too little to attempt \r\nmounting it. Notwithstanding the onagra was so well broken in \r\nfor riding, it continued to be very mettlesome and restive in \r\nthe shafts, to which we could not inure it; but occasionally \r\nit submitted to our putting a loaded sack or two on its back; \r\nbut we could seldom prevail even in this, without Fritz being \r\nseated in front; he would then take them to the house, and thus \r\nwas rendered of some general use.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the oaks Lightfoot was tied to a bush, and we \r\nset actively to work to gather the acorns that had dropped from \r\nthe trees. While all were busily employed, the monkey quitted \r\nits master’s shoulder and skipped unperceived into an adjoining \r\nbush. It had been there some time when we heard on that side \r\nthe loud cries of birds and flapping of wings, and this assured \r\nus a sharp conflict was going on betwixt master Knips and the \r\ninhabitants of the bushes. I dispatched Ernest to reconnoitre. \r\nHe went stoutly towards the place, and in an instant we heard \r\nhim exclaim, Come quickly, father! a fine heath-fowl’s nest full \r\nof eggs; Mr. Knips, as usual, wished to make a meal of them; \r\nthe hen and he are fighting for it: come quick, Fritz, and take \r\nher; I am holding greedy-chops as well as I can.\r\n\r\nFritz ran up directly, and in a few moments brought out alive \r\nthe male and female heath-fowl, both very beautiful; the cock \r\nfinely collar’d, similar to one he had killed on a former occasion, \r\nnot without much regret on my part. I was rejoiced at this discovery, \r\nand helped my son to prevent their escape by tying their wings \r\nand feet, and holding them while he returned to the bush for \r\nthe eggs. And now Ernest came forward driving the monkey before \r\nhim, and carrying his hat with the utmost care: he had stuck \r\nhis girdle full of narrow sharp-pointed leaves, in shape like \r\na knife-blade, which reminded me of the production named sword-grass; \r\nbut I did not pay much attention, as I was too busily engaged \r\nin our egg-hunt, and considered his decoration as childishness. \r\nOn coming up to me he uncovered his hat, and gave it to me in \r\na transport of joy, crying out, Here, dear father, here are some \r\nheath-fowl’s eggs; I found them in a nest so well concealed under \r\nthese long leaves that I should not have observed them had not \r\nthe hen, in defending herself against the monkey, scattered them \r\nabout. I am going to take them home, they will please my mother; \r\nand these leaves will so amuse Francis, they are like swords, \r\nand will be the very thing he will like for a play-thing. I applauded \r\nErnest’s attention to both, and I encouraged him and Fritz to \r\nbe thus ever considerate for the absent, so as to prove they \r\ncould never be forgotten. The kindnesses conferred on those who \r\nare separated from us have in themselves more merit, and are \r\nmore valued, than those which are personally received. It was \r\nnow time to think of moving homeward: my two sons filled the \r\nbags with acorns and put them on Lightfoot; Fritz mounted, Ernest \r\ncarried the eggs, I took charge of the hen, and we proceeded \r\nto Falcon’s Stream followed by our train-waggon. Our good cattle \r\nwere in such complete subjection that it was only necessary to \r\nspeak to them. I remarked Ernest often applying his ear to the \r\nhat which held the eggs, as if he thought the little ones were \r\nnear coming forth; I listened also, and observed some shells \r\nalready broken and the young protruding: we were overjoyed at \r\nour good luck, and Fritz could not refrain from trotting on briskly \r\nto bear the tidings to his dear mother: but he went rather faster \r\nthan he intended on setting out: he had taken a handful of the \r\npointed leaves with him, which he whisked before the ears and \r\neyes of the onagra, till the animal was frightened, lost all \r\nrestraint, and darted forward with him like a shot, hurrying \r\naway bags and rider at such a rate that we soon lost sight of \r\nthem. Anxious for his safety, we followed as fast as possible, \r\nthough out of sight of him all the way; but on our arrival at \r\nFalcon’s Stream we had the satisfaction of finding him there \r\nin perfect safety. His mother, indeed, had been somewhat alarmed \r\nin seeing him dash in like a thunderbolt, but firmly seated betwixt \r\nthe bags on master Lightfoot, who well deserved his name on this \r\noccasion, and who stopped short with wonderful precision at his \r\nstable door. Our first care was to examine the eggs: the female \r\nbird was too frightened and wild to sit upon them: fortunately \r\nwe had a hen that was hatching; her eggs were immediately removed, \r\nand the new ones put in their place: the female heath-fowl was \r\nput into the parrot’s cage, and hung up in the room to accustom \r\nit to our society. In less than three days all the chickens were \r\nhatched, they kept close to their foster-mother, and ate greedily \r\na mixture of sweet acorns bruised in milk, such as we gave our \r\ntame poultry: as they grew up I plucked out the large feathers \r\nof their wings, lest they should naturally take flight; but they \r\nand their real parent gradually became so domesticated, that \r\nthey daily accompanied our feathered stock in search of food, \r\nand regularly came back at night to the roost I had prepared \r\nfor them, and in which this little new colony of feathered beings \r\nseemed to delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. \r\n\r\n_Flax, and the rainy season._\r\n\r\nFrancis for a short time was highly amused with his sword-leaves, \r\nand then like all children, who are soon tired of their toys, \r\nhe grew weary of them, and they were thrown aside. Fritz picked \r\nup some of them that were quite soft and withered; he held up \r\none which was pliable as a ribband in the hand: My little fellow, \r\nsaid he to his brother, you can make whips of your sword-grass, \r\ntake up the leaves and keep them for this purpose, they will \r\nbe of use in driving your goats and sheep. It had been lately \r\ndecided that it should be the business of Francis to lead these \r\nto pasture.\r\n\r\nWell then, help me to make them, said the child. They sat down \r\ntogether. Francis divided the leaves into long narrow slips, \r\nand Fritz ingeniously platted them into whip-cords. As they were \r\nworking, I saw with pleasure the flexibility and strength of \r\nthe bands; I examined them more closely, and found they were \r\ncomposed of long fibres or filaments; and this discovery led \r\nme to surmise that this supposed sword-grass might be a very \r\ndifferent thing, and not improbably the flax-plant of New Zealand, \r\ncalled by naturalists _Chlomidia_, and by others _Phormion_[19]. \r\nThis was a valuable discovery in our situation: I knew how much \r\nmy wife wished for the production, and that it was the article \r\nshe felt most the want of; I therefore hastened to communicate \r\nthe intelligence to her, upon hearing which she expressed the \r\nliveliest joy: This, said she, is the most useful thing you have \r\nfound; I entreat you, lose not a moment in searching for more \r\nof these leaves, and bring me the most you can of them; I will \r\nmake you stockings, shirts, clothes, thread, ropes . . . . .\r\n\r\nIn short, give me flax, looms, and frames, and I shall be at \r\nno loss in the employment of it. I could not help smiling at \r\nthe scope she gave to her imagination, on the bare mention of \r\nflax, though so much was to be done between the gathering the \r\nleaves and having the cloth she was already sewing in idea. Fritz \r\nwhispered a word in Jack’s ear; both went to the stable, and \r\nwithout asking my leave, one mounted Lightfoot, the other the \r\nbuffalo, and galloped off towards the wood so fast that I had \r\nno time to call them back; they were already out of sight: their \r\neagerness to oblige their mother in this instance pleaded their \r\nforgiveness, and I suffered them to go on without following them, \r\npurposing to proceed and bring them back if they did not soon \r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nIn waiting for them I conversed with my wife, who pointed out \r\nto me with all the animation and spirit of useful enterprise \r\nso natural to her character, the various machinery I must contrive \r\nfor spinning and weaving her flax for the manufactory of cloths, \r\nwith which she said she should be able to equip us from head \r\nto foot; in speaking of which, her eyes sparkled with the love \r\nof doing good, the purest kind of joy, and I promised her all \r\nshe desired of me.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour our deserters came back on a full trot, \r\nand I was pleased to see them again; like true hussars, they \r\nhad foraged the woods, and heavily loaded their cattle with the \r\nprecious plant, which they threw at their mother’s feet with \r\njoyful shouts. We could not blame their abrupt departure. Jack \r\nmade us laugh in recounting with his accustomed vivacity and \r\ndrollery at what a rate he had trotted his buffalo to keep up \r\nwith Lightfoot, and how his great horned horse had thrown him \r\nby a side leap; yet that notwithstanding these, he and his buffalo, \r\nas in duty and allegiance bound, were, as ever, at the entire \r\ncommand of their acknowledged queen. Well, said I, you shall \r\nthen all assist her with consummate diligence in preparations \r\nfor the work she is about to engage in, and previously in steeping \r\nthe flax.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—How is flax prepared, father, and what is meant by steeping \r\nit?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Steeping flax, or hemp, is exposing it in the open \r\nair, by spreading it on the ground to receive the rain, the wind, \r\nand the dew, in order in a certain degree to liquefy the plant; \r\nby this means the ligneous or cortical parts of the flax are \r\nseparated with more ease from the fibrous; a kind of vegetable \r\nglue that binds them is dissolved, and it can then be perfectly \r\ncleaned with great facility, and the parts selected which are \r\nfit for spinning.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—But may not the natural texture of this part be destroyed \r\nby exposing it so long to wet?\r\n\r\n_Father._—That certainly may happen when the process is managed \r\ninjudiciously, and the flax not duly turned; the risk, however, \r\nis not great, the fibrous part has a peculiar tenacity, which \r\nenables it to resist longer the action of humidity; flax may \r\nbe even steeped altogether in water without injury. Many think \r\nthis the best and quickest method, and I am of their opinion.\r\n\r\nMy wife coincided with me, especially in the sultry climate we \r\ninhabited: she therefore proposed to soak the flax in Flamingo \r\nMarsh, and to begin by making up the leaves in bundles, as they \r\ndo hemp in Europe. We agreed to her proposal, and joined in this \r\nprevious and necessary preparation of the flax during the rest \r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nNext morning the ass was put to the small light car, loaded with \r\nbundles of leaves; Francis and the monkey sat on them, and the \r\nremainder of the family gaily followed with shovels and pickaxes. \r\nWe stopped at the marsh, divided our large bundles into smaller, \r\nwhich we placed in the water, pressing them down with stones \r\nand leaving them in this state till our sovereign should direct \r\nus to remove and set them in the sun to dry, and thus render \r\nthe stems soft and easy to peel. In the course of this work we \r\nnoticed with admiration the instinct of the flamingoes in building \r\ntheir cone-shaped nests above the level of the marsh, each nest \r\nhaving a recess in the upper part, in which the eggs are securely \r\ndeposited, while the contrivance enables the female to sit with \r\nher legs in the water: the nest is of clay closely cemented, \r\nso as to resist all danger from the element till the young can \r\nswim.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after, my wife told us the flax was sufficiently \r\nsteeped. We then took it out of the water, and spread it on the \r\ngrass in the sun, where it dried so well and rapidly that we \r\nwere able to load it on our cart the same evening, and carry \r\nit to Falcon’s Stream, where it was put by till we had time to \r\nattend further to it, and make beetles, wheels, reels, carding-combs, \r\n&c., as required by our expert and skilful flax-manufacturer. \r\nIt was thought best to reserve this task for the rainy season, \r\nand to get ready what would be then necessary during our confinement \r\nwithin doors. Uninformed as we were as to the duration of this \r\nseason, it was highly important to lay in a competent stock of \r\nprovisions for ourselves and for all the animals. Occasional \r\nslight showers, the harbingers of winter, had already come on; \r\nthe temperature, which hitherto had been warm and serene, became \r\ngloomy and variable; the sky was often darkened with clouds, \r\nthe stormy winds were heard, and warned us to avail ourselves \r\nof the favourable moment to collect every thing that would be \r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nOur first care was to dig up a full supply of potatoes and yams \r\nfor bread, with plenty of cocoa-nuts, and some bags of sweet \r\nacorns. It occurred to us while digging, that the ground being \r\nthus opened and manured with the leaves of plants, we might sow in \r\nit to advantage the remainder of our European corn. Notwithstanding \r\nall the delicacies this stranger land afforded us, the force \r\nof habit still caused us to long for the bread we had been fed \r\nwith from childhood: we had not yet laid ourselves out for regular \r\ntillage, and I was inclined to attempt the construction of a \r\nplough of some sort as soon as we had a sufficient stock of corn \r\nfor sowing. For this time, therefore, we committed it to the \r\nearth with little preparation: the season, however, was proper \r\nfor sowing and planting, as the ensuing rain would moisten and \r\nswell the embryo grain, which otherwise would perish in an arid \r\nburning soil. We accordingly expedited the planting of the various \r\npalm trees we had discovered in our excursions, at Tent House, \r\ncarefully selecting the smallest and the youngest. In the environs \r\nwas formed a large handsome plantation of sugar canes, so as \r\nto have hereafter every thing useful and agreeable around us, \r\nand thus be dispensed from the usual toil and loss of time in \r\nprocuring them.\r\n\r\nThese different occupations kept us several weeks in unremitted \r\nactivity of mind and body; our cart was incessantly in motion, \r\nconveying home our winter stock; time was so precious that we \r\ncould not even make regular meals, and limited ourselves to bread, \r\ncheese, and fruits, in order to shorten them, to return quickly \r\nto our work, and dispatch it before the bad season should set \r\nin.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the weather changed sooner than we had expected, \r\nand than, with all our care, we could be prepared for; before \r\nwe had completed our winter establishment, the rain fell in such \r\nheavy torrents that little Francis, trembling, asked me whether \r\nfather Noah’s deluge was coming on again; and I could not myself \r\nrefrain from painful apprehension in surmising how we should \r\nresist such a body of water, that seemed to change the whole \r\nface of the country into a perfect lake.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done, and which gave us all sensations \r\nof deep concern, was to remove without delay our aërial abode, \r\nand to fix our residence at the bottom of the tree, between the \r\nroots and under the tarred roof I had erected; for it was no \r\nlonger possible to remain above, on account of the furious winds \r\nthat threatened to bear us away, and deluged our beds with rain \r\nthrough the large opening in front, our only protection here \r\nbeing a piece of sail-cloth, which was soon dripping wet and \r\nrent to pieces. In this condition we were forced to take down \r\nour hammocks, mattresses, and every article that could be injured \r\nby the rain; and most fortunate did we deem ourselves in having \r\nmade the winding stairs, which sheltered us during the operation of \r\nthe removal. The stairs served afterwards for a kind of lumber-room; \r\nwe kept all in it we could dispense with, and most of our culinary \r\nvessels, which my wife fetched as she happened to want them. \r\nOur little sheds between the roots, constructed for the poultry \r\nand the cattle, could scarcely contain us all; and the first \r\ndays we passed in this manner were painfully embarrassing, crowded \r\nall together, and hardly able to move in these almost dark recesses, \r\nwhich the fœtid smell from the close-adjoining animals rendered \r\nalmost insupportable: in addition, we were half stifled with \r\nsmoke whenever we kindled a fire, and drenched with rain when \r\nwe opened the doors. For the first time, since our disaster, \r\nwe sighed for the comfortable houses of our dear country:—but \r\nwhat was to be done! we were not there, and losing our courage \r\nand our temper would only increase the evil. I strove to raise \r\nthe spirits of my companions, and obviate some of the inconveniences. \r\nThe now doubly-precious winding stair was, as I have said, every \r\nway useful to us; the upper part of it was filled with numerous \r\narticles that gave us room below; and as it was lighted and sheltered \r\nby windows, my wife often worked there, seated on a stair, with \r\nher little Francis at her feet. We confined our live-stock to \r\na smaller number, and gave them a freer current of air, dismissing \r\nfrom the stalls those animals that from their properties, and \r\nbeing natives of the country, would be at no loss in providing \r\nfor themselves. That we might not lose them altogether, we tied \r\nbells round their necks; Fritz and I sought and drove them in \r\nevery evening that they did not spontaneously return. We generally \r\ngot wet to the skin and chilled with cold, during the employment, \r\nwhich induced my wife to contrive for us a kind of clothing more \r\nsuitable to the occasion; she took two seamen’s shirts from the \r\nchest we had recovered from the wreck; and then, with some pieces \r\nof old coats, she made us a kind of cloth hoods joined together \r\nat the back, and well formed for covering the head entirely: \r\nwe melted some elastic gum, which we spread over the shirts and \r\nhoods; and the articles thus prepared answered every purpose \r\nof water-proof overalls, that were of essential use and comfort \r\nto us. Our young rogues were ready with their derision the first \r\ntime they saw us in them; but afterwards they would have been \r\nrejoiced to have had the same: this, however, the reduced state \r\nof our gum did not allow, and we contented ourselves with wearing \r\nthem in turn, when compelled to work in the rain, from the bad \r\neffects of which they effectually preserved us.\r\n\r\nAs to the smoke, our only remedy was to open the door when we \r\nmade a fire; and we did without as much as we could, living on \r\nmilk and cheese, and never making a fire but to bake our cakes: \r\nwe then availed ourselves of the opportunity to boil a quantity \r\nof potatoes and salt meat enough to last us a number of days. \r\nOur dry wood was also nearly expended, and we thanked Heaven \r\nthe weather was not very cold; for had this been the case our \r\nother trials would have much increased. A more serious concern \r\nwas our not having provided sufficient hay and leaves for our \r\nEuropean cattle, which we necessarily kept housed to avoid losing \r\nthem; the cow, the ass, the sheep, and the goats, the two last \r\nof which were increased in number, required a large quantity \r\nof provender, so that we were ere long forced to give them our \r\npotatoes and sweet acorns, which by the by they found very palatable, \r\nand we remarked that they imparted a delicate flavour to their \r\nmilk;—the cow, the goats, and even the sheep, amply supplied \r\nus with that precious article: milking, cleaning the animals \r\nand preparing their food, occupied us most of the morning, after \r\nwhich we were usually employed in making flour of the manioc \r\nroot, with which we filled the large gourds, which were previously \r\nplaced in rows. The gloom of the atmosphere and our low windowless \r\nhabitation sensibly abridged our daylight; fortunately, we had \r\nlaid in a huge store of candles, and felt no want of that article: \r\nwhen darkness obliged us to light up, we got round the table, \r\nwhen a large taper fixed on a gourd gave us an excellent light, \r\nwhich enabled my wife to pursue her occupation with the needle, \r\nwhile I, on my part, was forming a journal and recording what \r\nthe reader has perused of the narrative of our shipwreck and \r\nresidence in this island, assisted from time to time by my sons \r\nand their admirable mother, who did not cease to remind me of \r\nvarious incidents belonging to the story. To Ernest, who wrote \r\na fine hand, was intrusted the care of writing off my pages in \r\na clear legible character; Fritz and Jack amused themselves by \r\ndrawing from memory the plants and animals which had most struck \r\ntheir observation; while one and all contributed to teach little \r\nFrancis to read and write: we concluded the day with a devotional \r\nreading in the Holy Bible, performed by each in turn, and we \r\nthen retired to rest, happy in ourselves, and in the innocent \r\nand peaceful course of our existence. Our kind and faithful steward \r\noften surprised us agreeably on our return from looking after \r\nthe cattle, by lighting up a faggot of dried bamboo, and quickly \r\nroasting by the clear and fervent heat it produced, a chicken, \r\npigeon, duck, or penguin from our poultry-yard, or some of the \r\nthrushes we had preserved in butter, which were excellent, and \r\nwelcomed as a treat to reward extraordinary toil. Every four \r\nor five days the kind creature made us new fresh butter in the \r\ngourd-churn; and this with some deliciously fragrant honey spread \r\non our manioc cakes, formed a collation that would have raised \r\nthe envy of European epicures. These unexpected regales represented \r\nto our grateful hearts so many little festivals, the generous \r\nintention of which made us forget our bad accommodations and \r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of our meals belonged in right to our domestic \r\nanimals, as part of the family. We had now four dogs, the young \r\njackal, the eagle, and the monkey, to feed; they relied with \r\njust confidence on the kindness of their respective masters, \r\nwho certainly would have deprived themselves to supply the wants \r\nof their helpless dependents. Francis had taken under his mighty \r\nprotection the two little bull-dogs; my wife Ponto, and I the \r\nbrave Turk:—thus each had his attendant, of which he took care, and \r\nno one was dispensed from the offices of tenderness and vigilance. \r\nIf the buffalo, the onagra, and pig had not found sustenance \r\nabroad, they must have been killed or starved, and that would \r\nhave given us much pain. In the course of these discomforts it \r\nwas unanimously resolved on, that we would not pass another rainy \r\nseason exposed to the same evils; even my beloved consort, who \r\nfelt such a predilection for the abode at Falcon’s Stream, was \r\nfrequently a little ruffled and out of temper with our inconvenient \r\nsituation, and insisted more than any of us on the propriety \r\nof building elsewhere a more spacious winter residence: she wished, \r\nhowever, to return to our castle in the tree every summer, and \r\nwe all joined with her in that desire. The choice of a fresh \r\nabode now engrossed our attention, and Fritz in the midst of \r\nconsultation came forward triumphantly with a book he had found \r\nin the bottom of our clothes’ chest. Here, said he, is our best \r\ncounsellor and model, _Robinson Crusoe_; since Heaven has destined \r\nus to a similar fate, whom better can we consult? as far as I \r\nremember, he cut himself an habitation out of the solid rock: \r\nlet us see how he proceeded; we will do the same and with greater \r\nease, for he was alone; we are six in number, and four of us \r\nable to work. Well spoken, son, said I: this activity and courage \r\ngive me pleasure; let us then strive to be as ingenious as Robinson \r\nCrusoe.\r\n\r\nAnd why not? observed Jack—Have we not an island, rocks, and \r\ntools from abroad as good as he had, and, as brother Fritz says, \r\nmore hands to use them?\r\n\r\nWe assembled, and read the famous history with an ardent interest; \r\nit seemed though so familiar, quite new to us: we entered earnestly \r\ninto every detail and derived considerable information from it, \r\nand never failed to feel lively gratitude towards God who had \r\nrescued us all together, and not permitted one only of us to \r\nbe cast a solitary being on the island. The occurrence of this \r\nthought produced an overwhelming sense of affection among us, \r\nand we could not refrain from throwing ourselves into each others \r\narms, embracing repeatedly, and the pathetic scene ended in mutual \r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\nFrancis repeated his wish to have a Man Friday; Fritz thought \r\nit better to be without such a companion, and to have no savages \r\nto contend with. Jack was for the savages, warfare and encounters. \r\nThe final result of our deliberations was to go and survey the \r\nrocks round Tent-House, and to examine whether any of them could \r\nbe excavated for our purpose.\r\n\r\nOur last job for the winter, undertaken at my wife’s solicitation, \r\nwas a beetle for her flax and some carding-combs. I filed large \r\nnails till they were even, round, and pointed; I fixed them at \r\nequal distances in a sheet of tin, and raised the sides of it \r\nlike a box; I then poured melted lead between the nails and the \r\nsides, to give firmness to their points, which came out four \r\ninches. I nailed this tin on a board, and the machine was fit for \r\nwork. My wife was impatient to use it; and the drying, peeling, and \r\nspinning her flax, became from this time a source of inexhaustible \r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. \r\n\r\n_Spring;—spinning;—salt mine._\r\n\r\nI can hardly describe our joy when, after many tedious and gloomy \r\nweeks of rain, the sky began to brighten, the sun to dart its \r\nbenign rays on the humid earth, the winds to be lulled, and the \r\nstate of the air became mild and serene. We issued from our dreary \r\nhovels with joyful shouts, and walked round our habitation breathing \r\nthe enlivening balmy ether, while our eyes were regaled with \r\nthe beauteous verdure beginning to shoot forth on every side. \r\nReviving nature opened her arms, every creature seemed reanimated, \r\nand we felt the genial influence of that glorious luminary which \r\nhad been so long concealed from our sight, now returned like \r\na friend who has been absent, to bring us back blessings and \r\ndelight. We rapidly forgot in new sensations the embarrasments \r\nand weary hours of the wet season, and with jocund, hopeful hearts, \r\nlooked forward to the toils of summer as enviable amusements.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of our plantation of trees was rapidly advancing; \r\nthe seed we had thrown into the ground was sprouting in slender \r\nblades that waved luxuriantly; a pleasing tender foliage adorned \r\nthe trees; the earth was enamelled with an infinite variety of \r\nflowers, whose agreeable tints diversified the verdure of the \r\nmeadows. Odorous exhalations were diffused through the atmosphere; \r\nthe song of birds was heard around; they were seen between the \r\nleaves joyfully fluttering from branch to branch; their various \r\nforms and brilliant plumage heightened this delightful picture \r\nof the most beautiful spring, and we were at once struck with \r\nwonder and penetrated with gratitude towards the Creator of so \r\nmany beauties. Under these impressions we celebrated the ensuing \r\nSunday in the open air, and with stronger emotions of piety than \r\nwe had hitherto felt on the fertile shores upon which we had \r\nbeen so miraculously saved and fostered. The blessings which \r\nsurrounded us were ample compensation for some uneasy moments \r\nwhich had occasionally intervened, and our hearts, filled with \r\nfresh zeal, were resolved to be resigned, if it should be the \r\nwill of God, to pass the residue of our days in this solitude \r\nwith serenity of soul and every due exertion. The force of paternal \r\nfeelings, no doubt, made me sometimes form other wishes for my \r\nchildren; but these I buried in my own breast, for fear of disturbing \r\ntheir tranquillity: but if I secretly indulged a desire for some \r\nevent that might prolong and even increase their happiness, I \r\nnevertheless wholly submitted all to the Divine will, the \r\nmanifestation of which I awaited in becoming thankfulness and \r\npatience.\r\n\r\nOur summer occupations commenced by arranging and thoroughly \r\ncleaning Falcon’s Nest, the order and neatness of which the rain \r\nand dead leaves blown by the wind had disturbed: in other respects, \r\nhowever, it was not injured, and in a few days we rendered it \r\ncompletely fit for our reception; the stairs were cleared, the \r\nrooms between the roots re-occupied, and we were left with leisure \r\nto proceed to other employments. My wife lost not a moment in \r\nresuming the process of her flax concern. Our sons hastened to \r\nlead the cattle to the fresh pastures, already dried by the sun; \r\nwhilst it was my task to carry the bundles of flax into the open \r\nair, whereby heaping stones together I contrived an oven sufficiently \r\ncommodious to dry it well. The same evening we all set to work \r\nto peel, and afterwards to beat it and strip off the bark, and \r\nlastly to comb it with my carding machine, which fully answered \r\nthe purpose. I took this somewhat laborious task on myself, and \r\ndrew out such distaffs full of long soft flax ready for spinning, \r\nthat my enraptured wife ran to embrace me, to express her heartfelt \r\nacknowledgement, requesting me to make her a wheel without delay, \r\nthat she might enter upon her favourite work.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier period of my life I had practised turnery for my \r\namusement; now, however, I was unfortunately destitute of the \r\nrequisite utensils; but as I had not forgotten the arrangement \r\nand component parts of a spinning-wheel and reel, I by repeated \r\nendeavours found means to accomplish those two machines to her \r\nsatisfaction; and she fell so eagerly to spinning, as to allow \r\nherself no leisure even for a walk, and scarcely time to dress \r\nour dinners: nothing so much delighted her as to be left with \r\nher little boy, whom she employed to reel as fast as she could \r\nspin, and sometimes the other three were also engaged in turns \r\nat the wheel, to forward her business whilst she was occupied \r\nin culinary offices; but not one of them was found so tractable \r\nas the cool-tempered quiet Ernest, who preferred this to more \r\nlaborous exertions, though such was our want of linen and clothes, \r\nthat we ought all readily and even eagerly to have joined in \r\nprocuring them; but our excursions, and the necessary liberty \r\nthey involved, were more agreeable to us than this female occupation. \r\nOur first visit was to Tent-House, as we were anxious to ascertain \r\nthe ravages of winter there, and we found them much more considerable \r\nthan at Falcon’s Stream, and even dreadful: the tempest and rain \r\nhad beaten down the tent, carried away a part of the sail-cloth, \r\nand made such havoc amongst our provisions, that by far the largest \r\nportion of them was spotted with mildew, and the remainder could \r\nbe only saved by drying them instantly. Luckily, our handsome \r\npinnace had been for the most part spared; it was still at anchor, \r\nready to serve us in case of need; but our tub-boat was in too \r\nshattered a state to be of any further service.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the stores we were grieved to find the gunpowder \r\nmost damaged, of which I had left three barrels in the tent instead \r\nof placing them in a more sheltered situation in the cavity of \r\nthe rock. The contents of two were rendered wholly useless. I \r\nthought myself fortunate on finding the remaining one in tolerable \r\ncondition, and derived from this great and irreparable loss a \r\ncogent motive to fix upon winter quarters where our stores and \r\nwealth would not be exposed to such cruel dilapidations.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the gigantic plan suggested by the enterprising \r\ncharacters of Fritz and Jack, I had little hope of being able \r\nto effect the excavation of a dwelling in the side of the rock. \r\nRobinson Crusoe is supposed to have found a spacious cavern that \r\nmerely required arrangement; no such cavity was apparent in our \r\nrock, which bore the aspect of primitive existence, and was of \r\nextreme hardness; so that with our limited powers, three or four \r\nsummers would scarcely suffice to execute the design. Still, \r\nthe earnest desire of a more substantial habitation to defend \r\nus from the elements, perplexed me incessantly, and I resolved \r\nto make at least the attempt of cutting out a recess that should \r\ncontain the gunpowder, the most valuable of all our treasures; by \r\nwhich means it would be secured against injury from the vicissitudes \r\nof the weather. With this resolution I set off one day, accompanied \r\nby my two valiant workmen Fritz and Jack, leaving their mother \r\nat her spinning with her assistants Ernest and Francis. We took \r\nwith us pickaxes, chisels, hammers, and iron levers, to try \r\nwhat impression we could make on the rock. I chose a part nearly \r\nperpendicular, and much better situated than our tent: the view \r\nfrom it was enchanting; for it embraced the whole range of Safety \r\nBay, the banks of Jackal’s Stream and Family Bridge, and many \r\nof the picturesque projections of the rocks. I marked out with \r\ncharcoal the circumference of the opening we wished to make, \r\nand we began the heavy toil of piercing the quarry. We made so \r\nlittle progress the first day, that in spite of all our courage \r\nwe were tempted to relinquish the undertaking; we persevered \r\nhowever, and my hope was somewhat revived as I perceived the \r\nstone was of a softer texture as we penetrated deeper: we concluded \r\nfrom this, that the ardent rays of the sun striking upon the \r\nrock had hardened the external layer, and that the stone within \r\nwould increase in softness as we advanced, and we admitted a \r\nray of hope that the substance would prove to be a species of \r\ncalcareous stone. When I had cut about a foot in depth, we could \r\nloosen it with the spade like dried mud; this determined me to \r\nproceed with double ardour, and my boys assisted me in the task \r\nwith a zeal beyond their years.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of assiduous labour we measured the opening, \r\nand found we had already advanced seven feet into the rock. Fritz \r\nremoved the fragments in a barrow, and discharged them in a line \r\nbefore the place to form a sort of terrace; I applied my own \r\nlabour to the upper part to enlarge the aperture; Jack, the smallest \r\nof the three, was able to get in and cut away below. He had with \r\nhim a long iron bar sharpened at the end, which he drove in with \r\na hammer to loosen a large piece; suddenly he bawled out: It \r\nis pierced through, father! Fritz, I have pierced it through!\r\n\r\nHah, hah, master Jack at his jokes again!—But let us hear, what \r\nhave you pierced? Is it the mountain? Not peradventure your hand \r\nor foot, Jack? cried I:\r\n\r\n_Jack._—No, no, it is the mountain; (the rocks resounding with \r\nhis usual shout of joy) huzza, huzza, I have pierced the mountain!\r\n\r\nFritz now ran to him. Come, let us see then; it is no doubt the \r\nglobe at least you have pierced, said he, in a bantering tone: \r\nyou should have pushed on your tool boldly, till you reached \r\nEurope, which they say is under our feet; I should have been \r\nglad to peep into that hole.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Well, then, peep you may, I can assure you, but I hardly \r\nknow what you will see; now come and look how far the iron is \r\ngone in, and tell me if it is all my boasting;—if there were \r\nnot a hollow space behind, how could it penetrate the rock so \r\neasily?\r\n\r\nCome hither, father, said Fritz, this is really extraordinary; \r\nhis iron bar seems to have got to a hollow place; see, it can \r\nbe moved in every direction. I approached, thinking the incident \r\nworth attention: I took hold of the bar, which was still in the \r\nrock, and pressing it forcibly from one side to another, I made \r\na sufficient aperture for one of my sons to pass, and I observed \r\nthat in reality the rubbish fell within the cavity, the extent \r\nof which I could not ascertain, but I judged from the falling \r\nof the stones that it was not much deeper than the part we stood \r\non. My two lads offered to go in together and examine it: this, \r\nhowever, I firmly opposed: I even made them remove from the opening, \r\nas I smelled the mephitic air that issued abundantly from it, \r\nand began myself to feel giddiness in consequence of having gone \r\ntoo near; so that I was compelled to withdraw quickly, and inhale \r\na purer air. Beware, my dear children, said I in terror, of entering \r\nsuch a perilous cavern; life might be suddenly extinguished there.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—What, lose our lives, father! do you think then it contains \r\nlions or tigers? Only give me a gun, and let me speak a word \r\nto them.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—How can you think such animals could live there? Father \r\nmay indeed fear that it is inhabited by serpents or vipers.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—And what should hinder us, pray, from killing serpents \r\nand vipers?\r\n\r\nI admire, said I, your courage, my brave Jack, but it shall not \r\nbe tried on this occasion. Neither lions, serpents, nor men are \r\nthere, yet the danger still exists: how would my young hero acquit \r\nhimself, when on entering the aperture he should feel his respiration \r\ntotally cease?\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Not be able to breathe! and why not?\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Because the air is mephitic, that is, foul, and therefore \r\nunfit for breathing in, and those who are exposed to it must \r\nof course be suffocated. But in what manner, father, is this \r\nair corrupted?\r\n\r\n_Father._—In different ways: for example, when it is replete \r\nwith noxious vapours, or when it contains too many igneous or \r\ninflammable particles, or when it is too heavy or dense, as fixed \r\nair is; but in general, when it merely loses its elasticity, \r\nit no longer passes freely into the lungs; respiration is then \r\nstopped, and suffocation speedily ensues, because air is \r\nindispensable to life and the circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Then all to be done is to be off quickly when one feels \r\na stoppage of breath.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is certainly the natural course when it can be \r\ntaken; but the attack usually begins by a vertigo or dizziness \r\nof the head, so violent as to intercept motion, which is followed \r\nby an insurmountable oppression; efforts are made to breathe, \r\nfainting follows, and without speedy help, a sudden death takes \r\nplace.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—What assistance can be administered?\r\n\r\n_Father._—The first thing to be done is to remove the person \r\nso affected to pure fresh air, and to throw cold water over his \r\nbody; he must then be well dried, and afterwards rubbed with \r\nwarm cloths; vital air must be infused, or tobacco-smoke thrown \r\nup; in short, he must be treated like a drowned person till signs \r\nof re-animation appear, which is not always the result.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—But why do you think, father, the air in this cavern \r\nis mephitic, as you term it, or dangerous to breathe in?\r\n\r\n_Father._—All air confined and wholly separated from that of \r\nthe atmosphere, gradually loses its elasticity, and can no longer \r\npass through the lungs: in this state it generates injurious \r\nqualities that interrupt the process of respiration. It is in \r\nthis act that the atmospheric air diffused around us, unites \r\nintimately with the blood, to which it communicates one of its \r\nmost essential parts, called vital air, for without it life cannot \r\nbe supported. This air failing, respiration ceases, and death \r\nsucceeds in a few minutes: the consequence is similar when this \r\nair is impregnated too abundantly with injurious parts.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—And by what is good air known? How judge that one may \r\nrespire freely at a few paces from this mephitic cave?\r\n\r\n_Father._—This becomes evident when inspiration and expiration \r\nare performed with ease; besides, there is an infallible test: fire \r\ndoes not burn in foul air, yet it is made the means of correcting \r\nit. We must light a fire of sufficient strength in this hole \r\nto purify the air within, and render it friendly to respiration: \r\nat first the bad air will extinguish the fire, but by degrees \r\nthe fire in its turn will expel the bad air and burn freely.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—Oh! if that is all, it is an easy matter. As soon as \r\nthe foul air is out, we can make a huge opening, and walk about \r\nin the whole interior as if it were a level plain. The boys now \r\nhastened to gather some dry grass, which they made into bundles; \r\nthey then struck a light, and set fire to them, and threw the \r\nmoss blazing into the opening; but, as I had described, the fire \r\nwas extinguished at the very entrance, thus proving that the \r\nair within was highly mephitic. I now saw that it was to be rarefied \r\nby another and more effectual method; I recollected opportunely, \r\nthat we had brought from the vessel a chest which had belonged \r\nto the artificer, and had put it by in the tent, and that it \r\nwas full of granadoes and rockets, of which and other fire-works \r\na number had been shipped for the purpose of making signals as \r\nwell as for amusement. I sought this chest hastily, and took \r\nout of it some of the most requisite materials, and an iron mortar \r\nfor the purpose of throwing them into the hollow: with these \r\nI speedily returned to attack with my artillery the aërial demons: \r\nI threw the whole in, with a train that extended to where we \r\nstood, and thus ignited the space. A general explosion took place, \r\nand an awful report reverberated through the dark recess; the \r\ngranadoes flew about on all sides like brilliant meteors; we \r\nhurled them back to the extremity of the cavern, they rebounded \r\nand burst with a terrific sound. We then sent in the rockets, \r\nwhich had also a full effect; they hissed in the cavity like \r\nflying dragons, disclosing to our astonished view its vast extent. \r\nWe beheld too, as we thought, numerous dazzling bodies that sparkled \r\nsuddenly, as if by magic, and disappeared with the rapidity of \r\nlightning, leaving the place wrapped in the most profound obscurity. \r\nA squib bursting in the form of a star presented a spectacle \r\nwe wished to be prolonged. On its separating, a crowd of little \r\nwinged genii came forth, each holding a small lighted lamp, and \r\nthe whole fluttering in every direction with a thousand varied \r\nreverberations: every thing in the cavern shone brilliantly, \r\nand offered instantly a truly enchanting sight; but they dropped \r\nin succession, fell to the ground without noise, and vanished \r\nlike æthereal spirits.\r\n\r\nAfter having played off our fire-works, I tried lighted straw: \r\nto our great satisfaction, the bundles thrown in were entirely \r\nconsumed; we could then reasonably hope nothing was to be feared \r\nfrom the air; but there still remained the danger of plunging \r\ninto some abyss, or of meeting with a body of water: from these \r\nconsiderations I deemed it more prudent to defer our entrance \r\ninto this unknown recess till we had lights to guide us through \r\nit. I dispatched Jack on the buffalo to Falcon’s Stream, to impart \r\nour discovery to his mother and two brothers, directing him to \r\nreturn with them, and bring all the tapers that were left: my \r\nintention was to fasten them together on a stick, and form therewith \r\na large torch, and thus illuminated, proceed with our whole troop \r\nto examine the interior of this grotto. I had not sent Jack on \r\nhis embassy without a meaning; the boy possessed from nature \r\na lively and poetical imagination: I knew he would tell his mother \r\nsuch wonders of the enchanted grotto, of the fire-works, and \r\nall they had brought to our view, that in spite of the charms \r\nof her spinning-wheel he would induce her to accompany him without \r\ndelay, and bring us lights to penetrate the obscure sanctuary.\r\n\r\nOverjoyed at his commission, Jack sprang on the buffalo, which \r\nhe had nearly appropriated to himself, gaily smacked his whip, \r\nand set off so boldly that I almost trembled for his safety. \r\nThe rash intrepid boy was unincumbered by fear, and made a complete \r\nrace-horse of his horned Bucephalus.\r\n\r\nIn waiting his coming back, I proposed to Fritz to widen the \r\nentrance to the subterraneous grotto, to remove the rubbish, \r\nand make a way for his mother to pass in easily. After labouring \r\nthree or four hours we saw them coming up in our car of state,—the \r\none I had equipped for the potatoes,—and which was now drawn \r\nby the cow and the ass, and conducted by Ernest. Francis too \r\nplayed his part in the cavalcade, and contended with his brother \r\nfor the ropes that served as reins. Jack, mounted on his buffalo, \r\ncame prancing before them, blew through his closed hand in imitation \r\nof a French horn, and now and then whipped the ass and cow to \r\nquicken their motion. When they had crossed Family Bridge, he \r\ncame forward on the gallop; and when he got up to us, jumped \r\noff the beast, shook himself, took a spring or two from the ground, \r\nand thus refreshed, ran up to the car to hand his mother out \r\nlike a true and gallant knight.\r\n\r\nI immediately lighted my torches; but instead of tying them together \r\nas I had intended, I preferred each taking one in his right hand, \r\nan implement in his left in case of accident, a taper in his \r\npocket, flint and steel; and thus we entered the rock in solemn \r\nprocession. I took the lead, my sons followed me, and their beloved \r\nmother with the youngest brought up the rear, her interest and \r\ncuriosity not unalloyed with tender apprehensions; and indeed \r\nI felt myself that sort of fear which an unknown object is apt \r\nto excite: even our dogs that accompanied us betrayed some timidity, \r\nand did not run before as usual; but we had scarcely advanced \r\nfour paces within the grotto, when all was changed to more than \r\nadmiration and surprise. The most beautiful and magnificent spectacle \r\npresented itself. The sides of the cavern sparkled like diamonds, \r\nthe light from our six tapers was reflected from all parts, and \r\nhad the effect of a grand illumination. Innumerable crystals of every \r\nlength and shape hung from the top of the vault, which, uniting \r\nwith those of the sides, formed pillars, altars, entablatures, \r\nand a variety of other figures, constituting the most splendid \r\nmasses. We might have fancied ourselves in the palace of a fairy, \r\nor in an illumined temple. In some places all the colours of \r\nthe prism were emitted from the angles of the crystals, and gave \r\nthem the appearance of the finest precious stones. The waving \r\nof the lights, their bright coruscations, dark points here and \r\nthere occurring, the dazzling lustre of others—the whole, in \r\nshort, delighted and enchanted the sight and the fancy.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of my family was so great as to be almost ludicrous; \r\nthey were all in a kind of dumb stupor, half imagining it was \r\na dream: I had seen stalactites and read the description of the \r\nfamous grotto of Antiparos, far more considerable than this, \r\nwhich, however, gave an idea of it. The bottom was level, covered \r\nwith a white and very fine sand, as if purposely strewed, and \r\nso dry that I could not see the least mark of humidity anywhere. \r\nAll this led me to hope the spot would be healthy, convenient, \r\nand eligible for our proposed residence.\r\n\r\nI now formed a particular conjecture as to the nature of the \r\ncrystallizations shooting out on all sides, and especially from \r\nthe arch roof; they could scarcely be of that species of rock \r\ncrystals produced by the slow filtering of water falling in drops \r\nand coagulating in succession, and seldom found in excavations \r\nexhibiting so dry a nature, nor ever with so many of the crystals \r\nperpendicular and perfectly smooth. I was impatient to evince \r\nthe truth or falsehood of my opinion by an experiment, and discovered \r\nwith great joy, on breaking a portion of one of them, that I \r\nwas in a grotto of sal gem, that is, fossil or rock salt[20], \r\nfound in the earth in solid crystallized masses, generally above \r\na bed of spar or gypsum, and surrounded by layers of fossils \r\nor rock. The discovery of this fact, which no longer admitted \r\na doubt, pleased us all exceedingly. The shape of the crystals, \r\ntheir little solidity, and finally their saline taste, were decisive \r\nevidences.\r\n\r\nHow highly advantageous to us and our cattle was this superabundance \r\nof salt, pure and ready to be shovelled out for use, and preferable \r\nin all respects to what we collected on the shore, which required \r\nto be refined!\r\n\r\nMy wife was charmed with my good fortune in having cut through \r\nthe rock at this spot. I observed, that in all probability the \r\nmine extended a long way, and that I should have discovered salt \r\nhad I opened at any other part, though such a wonderful grotto \r\nmight not have been found every where.\r\n\r\nLittle Francis said to his brothers in a whisper, that it was \r\ncertainly the palace of some good fairy, who would come with \r\nher wand and grant them every thing they wished for, if they \r\nwere good. Well then, said Jack, I ask her to make you a little \r\nwiser and less credulous; don’t you hear father say all these \r\ndiamonds are only salt? and how often has he told you that God \r\nalone does wonders? The dear child said no more, but shook his \r\npretty fair locks as if he gave up his enchanted palace with \r\nsome reluctance; and to say the truth, his notion did not surprise \r\nme. As we advanced in the grotto, remarkable figures formed by \r\nthe saline matter every where presented themselves; columns reaching \r\nfrom the bottom to the top of the vault appeared to sustain it, \r\nand some even had cornices and capitals: here and there undulating \r\nmasses which at certain distances resembled the sea. From the \r\nvariegated and whimsical forms we beheld, fancy might make a \r\nthousand creations at its pleasure; windows, large open cupboards, \r\nbenches, church ornaments, grotesque figures of men and animals; \r\nsome like polished crystals or diamonds, others like blocks of \r\nalabaster.\r\n\r\nWe viewed with unwearied curiosity this repository of wonders, \r\nand we had all lighted our second taper, when I observed on the \r\nground in some places a number of crystal fragments that seemed \r\nto have fallen off from the upper part. Such a separation might \r\nrecur and expose us to danger; a piece falling on any of our \r\nheads might prove instantly fatal: but on closer inspection I \r\nwas convinced they had not dropped of themselves spontaneously; \r\nthe whole mass was too solid for fragments of that size to have \r\nbeen so detached from it; and had dampness loosened them they \r\nwould have dissolved gradually: I rationally concluded they were \r\nbroken off by the explosion of our artillery and fire-works, \r\nthat had caused a violent concussion in this subterraneous palace. \r\nHowever, I thought it prudent to retire, as other loosened pieces \r\nmight unexpectedly fall on us. I directed my wife and three of \r\nthe children to place themselves in the entrance, while Fritz \r\nand I carefully examined every part that threatened danger. We \r\nloaded our guns with ball and fired them in the centre of the \r\ncavern, to be more fully assured of what produced the separation \r\nof the former pieces; one or two more fell, the rest remained \r\nimmovable, though we went round with long poles and struck all \r\nwe could reach. We at length felt confident that in point of \r\nsolidity there was nothing to fear, and that we might proceed \r\nto fit up our new habitation without dread of accident. Our joy \r\non this important discovery did not fully declare itself till \r\nafter these trials. Loud exclamations, mixed with numerously \r\nvaried questions, projects, consultations, now succeeded to our \r\nmute astonishment! Many schemes were formed for converting this \r\nbeautiful grotto into a convenient and agreeable mansion for \r\nour abode. All the force of our imagination was centred in that \r\npoint: the greatest difficulty was removed; we had possession \r\nof the most eligible premises; the sole business now was to turn \r\nthem to the best account, and how to effect this was our unceasing \r\ntheme: some voted for our immediate establishment there, but \r\nthey were opposed by more sagacious counsel, and it was resolved \r\nthat Falcon’s Stream should continue to be our head quarters \r\ntill the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. \r\n\r\n_House in the salt-rock;—herring fishery._\r\n\r\nThe lucky discovery of a previously-existing cavern in the rock, had, \r\nas must be supposed, considerably lessened our labour: excavation \r\nwas no longer requisite: I had more room than was wanted for \r\nthe construction of our dwelling; to render it habitable was \r\nthe present object, and to do this did not seem a difficult task. \r\nThe upper bed of the rock in front of the cavern, through which \r\nmy little Jack had dug so easily, was of a soft nature, and to \r\nbe worked with moderate effort. I hoped also that, being now \r\nexposed to the air and heat of the sun, it would become by degrees \r\nas hard and compact as the first layer that had given me so much \r\ntrouble. From this consideration I began, while it retained its \r\nsoft state, to make openings for the door and windows of the \r\nfront. This I regulated by the measurement of those I had fixed \r\nin my winding stair-case, which I had removed for the purpose \r\nof placing them in our winter tenement. Intending Falcon’s Nest \r\nin future as a rural retreat for the hottest days of summer, \r\nthe windows of the stair-case became unnecessary; and as to the \r\ndoor, I preferred making one of bark similar to that of the tree \r\nitself, as it would conceal our abode the better, should we at \r\nany time experience invasion from savages or other enemies: the \r\ndoors and windows were therefore taken to Tent-house, and afterwards \r\nproperly fixed in the rock. I had previously marked out the openings \r\nto be cut for the frames, which were received into grooves for \r\ngreater convenience and solidity. I took care not to break the \r\nstone taken from the apertures, or at least to preserve it in \r\nlarge pieces, and these I cut with the saw and chisel into oblongs \r\nan inch and half in thickness, to serve as tiles. I laid them \r\nin the sun, and was gratified in seeing they hardened quickly; \r\nI then removed them, and my sons placed them in order against the \r\nside of the rock till they were wanted for our internal arrangements.\r\n\r\nWhen I could enter the cavern freely through a good door-way, \r\nand it was sufficiently lighted by the windows, I erected a partition \r\nfor the distribution of our apartments and other conveniences. \r\nThe extent of the place afforded ample room for my design, and \r\neven allowed me to leave several spaces in which salt and other \r\narticles could be stored. At the request of my children, I was \r\ncautious to injure as little as possible the natural embellishments \r\nof this new family mansion; but with all my care, I could not avoid \r\ndemolishing them in the division allotted to the stables:—cattle \r\nare fond of salt, and would not have failed to eat away these \r\nornaments, and perhaps in a prejudicial quantity: however, to \r\ngratify and reward my obedient children, I preserved the finest \r\nof the pillars and the most beautiful pieces to decorate our \r\nsaloon. The large ones served us for chairs and tables, and the \r\nbrilliant pilasters at once enlivened and adorned the apartment, \r\nand at night multiplied the reflection of the lights. I laid \r\nout the interior in the following manner:—A very considerable \r\nspace was first partitioned off in two divisions; the one on \r\nthe right was appropriated to our residence; that on the left \r\nwas to contain the kitchen, stables, and work-room. At the end \r\nof the second division, where windows could not be placed, the \r\ncellar and store-room were to be formed; the whole separated \r\nby partition boards, with doors of communication, so as to give \r\nus a pleasant and comfortable abode. Favoured so unexpectedly \r\nby what nature had already effected of the necessary labour, \r\nwe were far from repining ungratefully at what remained to be \r\ndone, and entertained full hope of completing the undertaking, \r\nor at least the chief parts, before winter.\r\n\r\nThe side we designed to lodge in, was divided into three chambers; \r\nthe first, next the door, was the bed-room for my wife and me, \r\nthe second a dining-parlour, and the last a bed-chamber for the \r\nboys. As we had only three windows, we put one in each sleeping-room; \r\nthe third was fixed in the kitchen, where my wife would often \r\nbe. A grating for the present fell to the lot of our dining-room, \r\nwhich, when too cold, was to be exchanged for one of the other \r\napartments. I contrived a good fire-place in the kitchen near \r\nthe window; I pierced the rock a little above, and four planks \r\nnailed together and passed through this opening answered the \r\npurpose of a chimney. We made the work-room near the kitchen, \r\nof sufficient dimensions for the performance of undertakings \r\nof some magnitude; it served also to keep our cart and sledge \r\nin: lastly, the stables, which were formed into four compartments \r\nto separate the different species of animals, occupied all the \r\nbottom of the cavern on this side; on the other were the cellar \r\nand magazine.\r\n\r\nIt is readily imagined that a plan of this extent was not to \r\nbe executed as if by enchantment, and that we satisfied ourselves \r\nin the first instance with doing what was most urgent, reserving \r\nthe residue of our arrangements for winter; yet every day forwarded \r\nthe business more than we had been aware of. On every excursion, \r\nwe brought something from Falcon’s Stream, that found its place \r\nin the new house, where we deposited likewise in safety the remaining \r\nprovisions from the tent.\r\n\r\nThe long stay we made at Tent-House during these employments, \r\nfurnished us an opportunity of perceiving several advantages \r\nwe had not reckoned upon, and which we did not defer availing \r\nourselves of. Immense turtles were very often seen on the shore, \r\nwhere they deposited their eggs in the sand, and they regaled \r\nus with a rich treat; but, extending our wishes, we thought of \r\ngetting possession of the turtles themselves for live stock, \r\nand of feasting on them whenever we pleased. As soon as we saw \r\none on the sands, one of my boys was dispatched to cut off its \r\nretreat; meanwhile we approached the animal, quickly and quietly \r\nwithout doing it any injury turned it on its back, passed a long \r\ncord through the shell and tied the end of it to a stake, which \r\nwe fixed close to the edge of the water. This done, we set the \r\nprisoner on his legs again; it hastened into the sea, but could \r\nnot go beyond the length of the cord: apparently it was all the \r\nhappier, finding food with more facility along shore than out \r\nat sea; and we enjoyed the idea of being able to take it when \r\nwanted. I say nothing of sea-lobsters, oysters, and many other \r\nsmall fishes which we could catch in any number. We at length \r\ngot used to and to like oysters, and occasionally had a treat \r\nof them. The large lobsters, whose flesh was tough and coarse, \r\nwere given to the dogs, who preferred them to potatoes; but we \r\nshortly after became possessors of another excellent winter provision \r\nwhich chance unexpectedly procured us.\r\n\r\nWe left Falcon’s Stream very early one morning; when near Safety \r\nBay we observed at some distance in the sea, a singular sort \r\nof spectacle which we had not before witnessed, though we had \r\ngone that way so many times. An extensive surface of the water \r\nseemed in a state of ebullition as if heated by a subterraneous \r\nfire; it swelled, subsided, foaming like boiling water: a large \r\nnumber of aquatic birds hovered over it, gulls, man of war birds, \r\nboobies, albatrosses, and a crowd of others we were strangers \r\nto, whose shrill cries pierced our ears; the feathered throng \r\nwere in motion: sometimes they darted along the surface of the \r\nwater, sometimes rose in the air, flying in a circle, pursuing \r\neach other in every direction; we were at a loss to judge whether \r\nsportiveness, pleasure or warfare produced their varied flights. \r\nThe space too of seemingly boiling surface exhibited a peculiar \r\naspect; small lights issued from it on all sides like flames \r\ndisappearing and rekindling every moment. We perceived also that \r\nthe motion of this part was from the main sea towards the land, \r\nand particularly Safety Bay, whither we hastened to examine this \r\nphenomenon. On our way we formed a thousand conjectures about \r\nit: my wife had accompanied us for the purpose of arranging the \r\nprovisions in the new magazines; she supposed it to be merely \r\na large sand bank, to which the tide gave the semblance of motion, \r\nand which by reflecting the beauteous tints of aurora, imparted \r\na flame colour to the waves and caused an optical deception. \r\nThis was too simple a solution for the vivid imagination of Fritz, \r\nwho maintained that something extraordinary was operating at \r\nthe bottom of the deep; some secret fire seeking a vent, or perhaps \r\nan earthquake; possibly the approaching irruption of a fresh \r\nvolcano somewhere. Ernest strongly controverted this idea: The \r\nbirds, said he, would instinctively fly from the spot, instead \r\nof collecting in heaps over it and gaily fluttering, so as to \r\nexcite the surmise of there being another body in the air as \r\nlarge and as agitated as that in the sea: see how they plunge \r\ninto it, said he; were the water hot, as Fritz thinks, they would \r\nscald their feet and beaks. The latter had little to say in reply; \r\nWell then, said he, tell us, Mr. Professor, what it is, instead \r\nof what it is not.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—I am much disposed to think it is some huge sea-monster, \r\na grampus or a whale that raises up its back sometimes like an \r\nisle, on which are a quantity of small fishes that offer an easy \r\nprey to the birds; on this account they follow the monster, striving \r\ngreedily to seize all they can in darting on it: those that succeed, \r\nfly off with their prey, and the rest pursue to snatch it from \r\nthem. I feel assured that this is the case, and that if we look \r\nclosely we shall observe this aquatic giant stretch out its immense \r\nfins, and when sufficiently warmed by the sun and it has inhaled \r\na fresh supply of air, it will dive into the ocean, and form \r\na vortex capable of sinking a large ship, if near it.\r\n\r\n_Jack._—Yes, father, Ernest is quite right. At the very edge \r\nof the bank, and in proportion to its approach, I distinctly \r\nsee something fall and rise again; one of its monstrous fins \r\nno doubt; I perceive its enormous claws too, certainly. If this \r\ngreat creature leaped out of the water, should we not all be \r\nin imminent danger?\r\n\r\n_Father._—Yes, yes, it might perhaps swallow my son Jack as people \r\nswallow a pill. But, boys, these suppositions are at best but \r\nflimsy fancies, and it is a pity that the pains you take should \r\nnot produce the least semblance of truth; and I am really surprised \r\nto find you so ready to believe in the existence of a monster \r\nequal in length to this moving bank.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—Upon my word, father, I have read of whales upsetting \r\nthe largest ships by getting under them, and that sailors have \r\noften mistaken them for islands, got on them, sunk, and been \r\ndevoured by the monster.\r\n\r\n_Father._—You must allow, Ernest, for a good deal of exaggeration \r\nin such accounts, if they be not altogether fabulous. It is possible \r\na marine animal of huge dimensions may have upset a small vessel, \r\nthough I presume that would be difficult; I likewise believe \r\nit possible for a whale’s back to have been taken at some distance \r\nfor a diminutive island; but when near, its shape and motions \r\nwould soon destroy the illusion. It is certain that the whale-fishers \r\nget on the back of the animal to harpoon it; and this I believe \r\nis the foundation of these wonderful narratives. As to the moveable \r\nbank before us, I will now, on the observation I have taken, \r\nventure to inform you that it is neither more nor less than a \r\nshoal of herrings about to enter Safety Bay and fall into our \r\nhands; they will be well received by me, I assure you; and it \r\nis worth our while to get on speedily, that we may be sure of \r\nsecuring so valuable a booty.\r\n\r\n_Francis._—But, dear father, what is a herring-shoal?\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is an immense number of small fishes called herrings, \r\nwhich you ought to know, having often eaten of them in Europe. \r\nThey swim so close together and occupy such a space, that they \r\nappear like a bank or island of sand several leagues in breadth, \r\nsome fathoms deep, and sometimes above a hundred thousand long, \r\nat the moment of leaving the frozen sea together in a heap: they \r\nafterwards divide into bodies which cross the ocean on all sides, \r\ndirecting their course to the coasts and bays, where they spawn, \r\nthat is, leave their eggs among the stones and sea plants, and \r\nto these spots fishermen from all parts go to catch them. The \r\nshoal is invariably followed by a legion of the largest fishes, \r\nsuch as bonittas, dories, sturgeons, dolphins, sea-dogs, &c. \r\nwhich are very fond of them. These are not their only enemies; \r\nthey also draw after them, as you see, flocks of voracious birds, \r\nthat rush like banditti along the surface of the water and seize \r\nall they can. The herrings appear eager to reach those parts \r\nwhere the tide is lowest, to escape from the voracity of the \r\nsea monsters, by getting into shallow water; but in doing this \r\nthey become an easier prey to the birds and to man. Exposed to \r\ndestruction in so many ways, one might wonder the species is \r\nnot extinct, if nature had not provided against these accidents \r\nby their astonishing fecundity; 68,656 eggs have been found in a \r\nmoderate-sized female: thus they continue undiminished \r\nnotwithstanding the vast numbers which are destroyed; in some seasons \r\nand latitudes they appear in such numerous and compact bodies that \r\nthe fishery is relinquished. What Jack took for arms or fins, is, I \r\nimagine, the water spouted in the air by the dolphins, which keenly \r\npursue the herrings. The whale and the grampus join in the chase, and \r\nfrom their size must commit enormous devastations.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—It is well they have left us a few; see how the shoal \r\nenters the bay. And in reality the entrance of it was entirely \r\nfilled with them: they made a loud rustling noise in the water, \r\nleaping over each other, and displaying their scales of silver \r\nhue. This accounted for the luminous sparks we had seen emitted \r\nfrom the sea, and which we could not previously explain. We had \r\nno time for further contemplation, but hastened to unharness \r\nour team and supply the want of nets with our hands in catching \r\nthe herrings: the boys used the largest gourds in lieu of pails, \r\nwhich were no sooner dipped in than filled; and we should have \r\nbeen at a loss where to stow them, had I not thought of employing \r\nthe condemned boat of tubs. No sooner thought than accomplished; \r\nI had it immediately drawn to the water’s edge by the buffalo, \r\nand placed it on rollers; my wife and the two youngest lads cleaned \r\nit, whilst the other two went to the cavern for salt, and I quickly \r\nfitted up a sort of tent of sail-cloth on the strand, so as to \r\nkeep off the rays of the sun while we were busied in salting. \r\nWe then all engaged in the task, and I allotted to each a share \r\nadequate to his strength and skill. Fritz took his station in \r\nthe water to bring us the herrings as fast as caught; Ernest \r\nand Jack cleaned them with knives; their mother pounded the salt; \r\nFrancis helped all, and I placed them in the tubs as I had seen \r\ndone in Europe. A joyous shout declared the general activity, though \r\nwe did not get at once into a regular train with our proceedings; \r\none of us was occasionally disengaged whilst the others were \r\noverborne with labour: this however was speedily arranged, and \r\nthe business so well managed, that it was performed with speed \r\nand pleasure. I put a layer of salt at the bottom of the barrel, \r\nthen of fish, the heads towards the staves, proceeding thus till \r\nmy tubs were nearly full: I spread over the last layer of salt, \r\nlarge palm-tree leaves, on these a piece of sail cloth, and fitted \r\nin two half-rounded planks for a heading, which I pressed down \r\nwith stones. This effected, I put the buffalo and the ass to \r\nthe cart again, and conveyed it to our cool cellar in the rock. \r\nIn a few days, when the herrings were sunk, I closed the barrels \r\nmore accurately by means of a coating of clay and flax over the \r\ncloth, which kept out air and moisture completely, and secured \r\nus an excellent food for winter.\r\n\r\nThis work, in which we were engaged several days, kept us at \r\nTent-House the whole week. Working from morning till night, we \r\ncould only prepare and salt two large casks of them, and we wished \r\nto have at least eight. During this time fresh herrings were \r\nour chief aliment, and we from the novelty relished them exceedingly.\r\n\r\nScarcely had we finished our salting when another business arising \r\nout of it occurred; a number of sea dogs came into the bay and \r\nriver[21], that had followed the herrings with the utmost greediness, \r\nsporting in the water along shore, without evincing any fear of \r\nus. This fish, which is scarcely eatable, offered little attraction \r\nto our palate and table, but in a different point of view the \r\npossession of it would be very beneficial; its skin tanned and \r\ndressed, makes excellent leather. I was in great need of it for \r\nstraps and harness, to make saddles for Fritz and Jack to ride \r\nthe onagra and buffalo, and in short for our own use to cut up \r\ninto soles, belts, and pantaloons, of which articles we much \r\nwanted a fresh supply: besides, I knew the fat yielded good lamp \r\noil, that might be substituted for tapers in the long evenings \r\nof winter; and that it would be further useful in tanning and \r\nrendering the leather pliant.\r\n\r\nI directed my three eldest boys to kill a dozen of these large \r\nfishes with sticks and pickaxes instead of using powder, and \r\nthey promptly began the attack. It is remarkable that boys in \r\ngeneral have a disposition for the destruction of animals, which \r\nby degrees leads them to view their sufferings with indifference. \r\nI felt regret in being urged occasionally by circumstances to \r\nencourage this propensity; it therefore gave me pleasure to see \r\nthem return in a few minutes and entreat me to allow them a little \r\npowder and some bullets, that they might dispatch the poor harmless \r\ncreatures at once without much pain. I acquiesced of course in \r\ntheir entreaty and commended the humane idea, which I thought \r\nwell worth the ammunition expended in the execution of it. It \r\nwas in our peculiar situation impracticable for us to yield to \r\nthat morbid sensibility which shudders at inflicting the smallest \r\nsuffering upon an animal; nor can I help thinking such exhibitions \r\nsomewhat absurd, since those very persons do not scruple to have \r\non their table a nice chicken, a large fish, lobsters, and many \r\nother animals that have as valid a right to live as those we \r\nwere necessitated to kill: however, I represented constantly \r\nto my children that cruelty and the passion of immolating without \r\nnecessity, any of the brute creation, degrade man, and may lead \r\non to the worst of crimes. On this occasion I was gratified in \r\nseeing they had surpassed me in consideration and humanity. In \r\na very short time, after a few firings, the number of fishes \r\nwas completed; we skinned them while fresh with little trouble, \r\nwell rubbed them with salt on both sides, and hung them to dry \r\nin the sun, to be afterwards dressed in our grotto. Curiosity \r\ninduced my wife to cook a piece of one of them, but it proved \r\nso bad that we threw it to our dogs, the eagle, and jackal, who \r\nmade a hearty meal of it. The fat we preserved carefully, of \r\nwhich we collected a quantity; it was first put into a copper, \r\nmelted and cleansed properly, then poured into casks and kept \r\nfor the tan-house and lamp. When time should allow, I purposed \r\nmaking soap with it, and this design excited my wife’s zeal in \r\nthe unpleasant though ultimately useful task we were engaged \r\nin. We also took care of the bladders, which are very large, \r\nfor the purpose of holding liquids; the remaining parts that \r\ncould be turned to no account were thrown into the adjoining \r\nstream; and this last act most unexpectedly procured us a regular \r\nsupply of a far more palatable food—a number of fine fresh-water \r\nlobsters which came to feed on these offals. We bored through \r\nthe sides of some empty chests, which we placed and kept down \r\nin the water with stones, and thus caught and preserved as in \r\na reservoir as many lobsters as we wanted. A similar contrivance \r\nwas fixed in Safety-Bay, which first became filled with live \r\nherrings, and subsequently with various kinds of small fishes \r\nthat were caught with ease.\r\n\r\nAt this time I likewise made some improvements in our sledge, \r\nto facilitate the carrying of our stores from Falcon’s Stream \r\nto our dwelling in the rock at Tent House. I raised it on two \r\nbeams, or axle-trees, at the extremities of which I put on the \r\nfour gun-carriage wheels I had taken off the cannon from the \r\nvessel; by this alteration I obtained a light and very convenient \r\nvehicle, of moderate height, on which boxes and casks could be \r\nplaced with little difficulty. Pleased with the operations of \r\nthe week, we set out all together with cheerful hearts for Falcon’s \r\nStream to pass our Sunday there, and once more offer our pious \r\nthanks to the Almighty for all the benefits he had bestowed upon \r\nhis defenceless creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. \r\n\r\n_New fishery;—New experiments and chase;—New discoveries and \r\nhouse._\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of our grotto went on, sometimes as a principal, \r\nsometimes as an intermediate occupation, according to the greater \r\nor less importance of other concerns: but though we advanced \r\nthus with moderate rapidity, the progress was notwithstanding \r\nsuch as to afford the hope of our being securely established \r\nwithin it by the time of the rainy season.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment I discovered gypsum to be the basis of the crystal \r\nsalt[22] in our grotto, I foresaw the great advantages I should \r\nderive from it for our undertaking; but being unwilling to enlarge \r\nthe dimensions of our dwelling by digging further, I tried to \r\nfind a place in the continuation of the rock, which I might be \r\nable to blow up: I had soon the good fortune to meet with a narrow \r\nslip between the projections of the rocks which I could easily, \r\nby the means I proposed, convert into a passage that should terminate \r\nin our work-room. I found also on the ground a quantity of fragments \r\nof gypsum, and removed a great number of them to the kitchen, \r\nwhere we did not fail to bake a few of the pieces at a time when \r\nwe made a fire for cooking, which, thus calcined, rubbed into \r\na powder when cold: we obtained a considerable quantity of it, \r\nwhich I put carefully into casks for use when the time should \r\ncome for finishing the interior of our dwelling. My notion was, \r\nto form the walls for separating the apartments of the squares \r\nof stone I had already provided, and to unite them together with \r\na cement of this new ingredient, which would be the means both \r\nof sparing the timber, and increasing the beauty and solidity \r\nof the work.\r\n\r\nIt is almost incredible the immense quantity of plaster we had \r\nin a short time amassed; the boys were in a constant state of \r\nwonder as they looked at the heap, and protested they believed \r\nthat I staid up at night to work. I seized the opportunity of \r\nimprinting on their minds the value of a firm and steady perseverance \r\nin an object once engaged in, the reward of which they now so \r\nagreeably experienced: When we first cast our eyes, continued \r\nI, on this rock, how little did we conceive it possible to transform \r\nit into a comfortable dwelling-place; yet we have not only in \r\nour own persons sufficed for carpenters and masons, but even \r\nplasterers too, and so effectually, that if we had it much at \r\nheart, we might adorn our walls with stucco as is the mode in \r\nEurope; we possess both the materials and intelligence, and with \r\nthe addition of patience and industry, there is scarcely any \r\nthing, even what at first should seem impossible, too difficult \r\nfor our performance.\r\n\r\nThe first use I made of the plaster was to complete some covers \r\nI had begun with other materials for my herring tubs, four of \r\nwhich I stopped down to render them impenetrable to the air; \r\nthe rest of the herrings we intended to dry and smoke. For this \r\npurpose we erected a little sort of hut of reeds and branches, \r\nas is practised in Holland and America by the fishermen; we placed \r\nrows of sticks reaching from side to side across the hut, and \r\nlaid the herrings upon them, and then lighted a heap composed \r\nof moss and fresh cut branches of trees, to produce a stronger \r\nand more effective vapour for the purpose: we made the door tight, \r\nand had soon the pleasure of adding a large stock of exquisitely \r\nflavoured dried herrings to our former store for the ensuing \r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nAbout a month after the singular visit of the herrings, which \r\nhad now entirely left our shores, we received another and not \r\na less profitable one from a fish of a different species: we \r\nobserved Safety Bay to be filled with large fishes which seemed \r\neager to push to the shore for the purpose of depositing their \r\neggs among the stones in fresh water. Jack was the first to discover \r\nthis circumstance: he told me he had seen a great number of whales \r\nswimming about in Jackal’s River, and supposed they were come \r\nin pursuit of the herrings, and that he was glad the greedy creatures \r\nwould be disappointed. I replied that there must be some delusion \r\nin what he had seen, as I could not conceive of a regiment of \r\nwhales arriving in our diminutive rivulet. Pray come with me, \r\nfather, answered he, and look at them; some of them are as large \r\nas you, and if they are not whales, I will lay a wager that neither \r\nare they herrings. Hah, hah, master Jack, you are on the retreat \r\nthen, I see; but between the whale and the herring there are \r\nmany kinds and sizes, so I will e’en take side with you and wager \r\nthat they are not herrings.\r\n\r\nIt however appeared to me worth while to go and convince myself \r\non the spot, respecting these new-comers. Jack and I walked to \r\nthe mouth of Jackal’s River, and immediately perceived immense \r\nquantities of a large fish moving slowly towards the banks, and \r\nsome of them from four to eight feet in length. By the pointed \r\nsnout I supposed the largest to be sturgeons, while the smallest \r\nI pronounced to be salmon. Jack now strutted and exulted as if \r\nhe had gained the command of a regiment of soldiers:—What say \r\nyou, now, father? said he, this is nothing like your little paltry \r\nherrings! A single fish of this troop would fill a tub!—No doubt, \r\nanswered I: and with great gravity I added,—Pr’ythee, Jack, step \r\ninto the river, and fling them to me one by one, that I may take \r\nthem home to salt and dry.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a moment with a sort of vacant doubt if I \r\ncould possibly be in earnest; then seizing suddenly a new idea—Wait \r\na moment, father, cried he, and I will do so: and he sprung off \r\nlike lightning towards the cavern, from whence he soon returned \r\nloaded with a bow and arrows, the bladders of the sea-dogs, and \r\na ball of string to catch, as he assured me, every one of the \r\nfishes. I looked on with interest and curiosity to mark what was next \r\nto happen, while the animation of his countenance, the promptitude \r\nand gracefulness of his motions, and the firm determination \r\nof his manner, afforded me the highest amusement. He tied the \r\nbladders round at certain distances with a long piece of string, \r\nto the end of which he fastened an arrow and a small iron hook; \r\nhe placed the large ball of string in a hole in the ground, at \r\na sufficient distance from the water’s edge, and then he shot \r\noff his arrow, which the next instant stuck in one of the largest \r\nfishes. My young sportsman uttered a shout of joy. At the same \r\nmoment Fritz joined us, and witnessed this unexpected feat without \r\nthe least symptom of jealousy. Well done, brother Jack, cried \r\nhe, but let me too have my turn.—Saying this he ran back and \r\nfetched the harpoon and the windlass, and returned to us accompanied \r\nby Ernest, who also desired to show his prowess in a contest \r\nwith our newly discovered mariners. We were well pleased with \r\ntheir opportune arrival, for the salmon Jack had pierced struggled \r\nso fiercely, that all our endeavours to hold the string were \r\ninsufficient, and we dreaded at every throw to see it break and \r\nthe animal make good its escape. By degrees, however, its strength \r\nwas exhausted, and aided by Fritz and Ernest, we succeeded in \r\ndrawing it to a bank, where I put an end to its existence.\r\n\r\nThis fortunate beginning of a plan for a fishery inspired us \r\nall with hope and emulation. Fritz eagerly seized his harpoon \r\nand windlass; I, for my part, like Neptune, wielded a trident; \r\nErnest prepared the large fishing rod, and Jack his arrow with \r\nthe same apparatus as before, not forgetting the bladders which \r\nwere so effectual in preventing the fish from sinking when struck. \r\nWe were now more than ever sensible of our loss in the destruction \r\nof the tub-boat, with which we could have pursued the creature \r\nin the water, and have been spared much pains and difficulty; \r\nbut on the other hand, such numbers of fishes presented themselves \r\nat the mouth of the river, that we had only to choose among them; \r\nand accordingly we were soon loaded with them to our heart’s \r\ncontent. Jack’s arrow after missing twice, struck the third time \r\na large sturgeon, which was so untractable that we had great \r\ndifficulty in securing him. I too had caught two of the same \r\nfish, and had been obliged to go up to the middle in the water \r\nto manage my booty. Ernest, with his rod and line and a hook, \r\nhad also taken two smaller ones. Fritz with his harpoon had struck \r\na sturgeon at least eight feet in length, and the skill and strength \r\nof our whole company were found necessary to conduct him safe \r\nto shore, where we harnessed the buffalo to him with strong cords \r\nto draw him to Tent House.\r\n\r\nOur first concern was to clean our fish thoroughly inside to \r\npreserve them fresh the longer. I separated the eggs I found \r\nin them, and which could not be less than thirty pounds, and \r\nput them aside to make a dish called caviar, greatly relished \r\nby the Russians and the Dutch. I took care also of the bladders, \r\nthinking it might be possible to make a glue from them which \r\nwould be useful for so many purposes. I advised my wife to boil \r\nsome individuals of the salmon in oil, similar to the manner \r\nof preparing tunny-fish in the Mediterranean: and while she was \r\nengaged in this process, I was at work upon the caviar and the \r\nglue. For the first, I washed the berries in several waters, \r\nand then pressed them closely in gourd-rinds in which a certain \r\nnumber of holes had been bored. When the water had run off, the \r\nberries were taken out in a substance like cheese, which was \r\nthen conveyed to the hut to be dried and smoked. For the second, \r\nwe cut the bladders into strips, which we fastened firmly by \r\none end to a stake, and taking hold of the other with a pair \r\nof pincers, we turned them round and round till the strip was \r\nreduced to a kind of knot, and these were then placed in the \r\nsun to harden; this being the simple and only preparation necessary \r\nfor obtaining glue from the ingredient. When thoroughly dry, \r\na small quantity is put on a slow fire to melt. We succeeded \r\nso well, and our glue was of so transparent a quality, that I \r\ncould not help feeling the desire to manufacture some pieces \r\nlarge enough, for panes to a window frame.\r\n\r\nWhen these various concerns were complete, we began to meditate \r\na plan for constructing a small boat as a substitute for the \r\ntub raft, to come close into shore. I had a great desire to make \r\nit, as the savages do, of the rind of a tree; but the difficulty \r\nwas to fix on one of sufficient bulk for my purpose; for though \r\nmany were to be found in our vicinity, yet each was on some account \r\nor other of too much value to be spared. We therefore resolved \r\nto make a little excursion in pursuit of a tree of capacious \r\ndimensions, and in a situation where it was not likely to yield \r\nus fruit, to refresh us with its shade, or to adorn the landscape \r\nround our dwelling.\r\n\r\nIn this expedition we as usual aimed at more than one object: \r\neager as we were for new discoveries, we yet allowed ourselves \r\nthe time to visit our different plantations and stores at Falcon’s \r\nStream. We were also desirous to secure a new supply of the wax berry, \r\nof gourds, and of elastic gum. Our kitchen garden at Tent-House \r\nwas in a flourishing condition; nothing could exceed the luxuriance \r\nof the vegetation, and almost without the trouble of cultivation \r\nwe had excellent roots and plants in abundance, which came in \r\nsuccession, and promised a rich supply of peas, beans of all \r\nsorts, lettuces, &c.; our principal labour was to give them water \r\nfreely, that they might be fresh and succulent for use. We had \r\nbesides, melons and cucumbers in great plenty, which during the \r\nhottest weather we valued more than all the rest. We reaped a \r\nconsiderable quantity of Turkey wheat from the seed we had sown, \r\nand some of the ears were a foot in length. Our sugar-canes were \r\nalso in the most prosperous condition, and one plantation of \r\npine-apples on the high ground was also in progress to reward \r\nour labour with abundance of that delicious fruit.\r\n\r\nThis state of general prosperity at Tent House gave us the most \r\nflattering expectations from our nurseries at Falcon’s Stream. \r\nFull of these hopes, we one day set out all together for our \r\nnow somewhat neglected former abode.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Falcon’s Stream, where we intended to pass the \r\nnight. We visited the ground my wife had so plentifully sowed \r\nwith grain, which had sprung up with an almost incredible rapidity \r\nand luxuriance, and was now nearly ready for reaping. We cut \r\ndown what was fairly ripe, bound it together in bundles, and \r\nconveyed it to a place where it would be secure from the attacks \r\nof more expert grain consumers than ourselves, of which thousands \r\nhovered round the booty. We reaped barley, wheat, rye, oats, \r\npeas, millet, lentils,—only a small quantity of each, it is true, \r\nbut sufficient to enable us to sow again plentifully at the proper \r\nseason. The plant that had yielded the most was maize, a proof \r\nthat it best loved the soil. It had already shown itself in abundance \r\nin our garden at Tent House; but here there was a surface of \r\nland, the size of an ordinary field, entirely covered with its \r\nsplendid golden ears, which still more than the other plants \r\nattracted the voracity of the feathered race. The moment we drew \r\nnear, a dozen at least of large bustards sprang up with a loud \r\nrustling noise which awakened the attention of the dogs; they \r\nplunged into the thickest parts, and routed numerous flocks of \r\nbirds of all kinds and sizes, who all took hastily to flight; \r\namong the fugitives were some quails who escaped by running, \r\nand lastly some kangaroos, whose prodigious leaps enabled them \r\nto elude the pursuit of the dogs.\r\n\r\nWe were so overcome by the surprise such an assemblage of living \r\ncreatures occasioned, as to forget the resource we had in our \r\nguns; we stood as it were stupid with amazement during the first \r\nmoments, and before we came to ourselves the prey was beyond \r\nour reach, and for the most part out of sight. Fritz was the \r\nfirst to perceive and to feel with indignation the silly part \r\nwe had been playing, and to consider in what way we could repair \r\nthe mischief. Without further loss of time, he took the bandage \r\nfrom his eagle’s eyes, (for the bird always accompanied him perched \r\nupon his-game bag,) and showed him with his hand the bustards \r\nstill flying, and at no great distance. The eagle took a rapid \r\nflight. Fritz jumped like lightning on the back of his onagra \r\nand galloped over every thing that intervened in the direction \r\nthe bird had taken, and we soon lost sight of him.\r\n\r\nWe now beheld a spectacle which in the highest degree excited \r\nour curiosity and interest: the eagle had soon his prey in view; \r\nhe mounted above the bustard in a direct line, without losing \r\nsight of it for an instant, and then darted suddenly down; the \r\nbustards flew about in utter confusion, now seeking shelter in \r\nthe bushes, then crossing each other in every direction, in the \r\nattempt to evade the common enemy; but the eagle remained steady \r\nin the pursuit of the bird he had fixed upon for his prey, and \r\ndisregarded all the rest: he alighted on the unlucky bustard, \r\nfixed his claws and his beak in its back, till Fritz arriving \r\nfull gallop, got down from the onagra, replaced the bandage on \r\nthe eagle’s eyes, seated him once more upon the game-bag, and \r\nhaving relieved the poor bustard from his persecutor, he shouted \r\nto us to come and witness his triumph! We ran speedily to the \r\nplace. Jack alone remained in the maize plantation, meditating \r\nalso the giving us a specimen of the happy effects of the education \r\nhe had bestowed on the young jackal, who had slipped slily away \r\nafter the birds we supposed were quails, and who on their parts \r\nwere using every effort to escape; the jackal however soon overtook \r\nthem, seized one of them by the wing and brought it to his master; \r\nin the same manner he had carried him at least a dozen more by \r\nthe time we reached the spot: and now nothing was heard but the \r\nexclamations of Fritz and Jack, who had not words to express \r\ntheir self-congratulations for the good effects of their mode \r\nof training their respective animals, who, to say the truth, \r\ndeserved the wonder and the praise of all. A large fat quail \r\nwas immediately given to each as a token of approbation.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this adventure we hastened forward to arrive \r\nthe soonest possible at Falcon’s Stream, and pay the earliest \r\nattention to the wounds the bustard had received from the eagle. \r\nWe perceived with pleasure that it was a male, and foresaw the \r\nadvantage of giving him for a companion to our solitary female \r\nof the same species, who was completely tamed. I threw a few \r\nmore bundles of maize into the cart, and without further delay \r\nwe arrived at our tree, one and all sinking with faintness from \r\nhunger, thirst, and fatigue. It was on such occasions that my \r\nexemplary partner evinced the superior fortitude and generosity \r\nof her temper: though more a sufferer than either of us, her \r\nfirst thought was what she could administer to relieve us in \r\nthe shortest time, for we had consumed our little store of wine, \r\nand could not soon and easily procure milk from the cow: she \r\ncontrived to bruise some of the maize between two large stones, \r\nand then put it in a linen cloth, and with all her strength squeezed \r\nout the sap; she then added some juice from the sugar-canes, \r\nand in a few minutes presented us with a draught of a cool refreshing \r\nliquid, beautifully white in appearance and agreeable to the \r\ntaste, and which we received at her hands with feelings of grateful \r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nI applied myself without loss of time to the cure of the bustard’s \r\nwounds, which I washed carefully with a lotion composed of water, \r\nwine, and butter, which was our constant remedy; I then tied \r\nhim by the leg close to the female in the yard. Jack had been \r\nable to preserve alive only two of the quails, which he now brought \r\nme, and I treated them in the same manner: all the others that \r\nthe jackal had killed were plucked and put on the spit for supper. \r\nThe rest of the day was employed in picking the grains of the \r\ndifferent sorts of corn from the stalks: we put what we wished \r\nto keep for sowing into some gourd-shells, and the Turkey wheat \r\nwas laid carefully aside in sheaves till we should have time \r\nto beat and separate it. Fritz observed that we should also want \r\nto grind it, and I reminded him of the hand-mill we had secured \r\nfrom our departed ally, the wrecked vessel.\r\n\r\n_Fritz._—But, father, the hand-mill is so small, and so subject \r\nto be put out of order:—Why should we not contrive a water-mill, \r\nas they do in Europe? We have surely rapid streams of water in \r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n_Father._—This is true, but such a mechanism is more difficult than \r\nyou imagine; the wheel alone, I conceive, would be an undertaking \r\nfar beyond our strength or our capacity. I am, however, well \r\npleased with the activity and zeal which prompted your idea; \r\nand though I dare not bid you trust in a successful result, yet \r\nwe may consider whether it may be worth while to bestow upon \r\nit further attention; we have abundance of time before us, for \r\nwe shall not want a water-mill till our harvests are such as \r\nto produce plentiful crops of corn. In the mean time let us be \r\nthinking, boy, of our proposed excursion for to-morrow, for we \r\nshould set out, at latest, by sun-rise.\r\n\r\nWe began our preparations accordingly: my wife chose some hens \r\nand two fine cocks, with the intention of taking them with us \r\nand leaving them at large to produce a colony of their species \r\nat a considerable distance from our dwelling-places: I with the \r\nsame view visited our stable, and selected four young pigs, four \r\nsheep, two kids, and one male of each species, our numbers having so \r\nmuch increased that we could well afford to spare these individuals \r\nfor the experiment: if we succeeded in thus accustoming them \r\nto the natural temperature and productions of our island, we \r\nshould have eased ourselves of the burden of their support, and \r\nshould always be able to find them at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after loading the cart with all things necessary, \r\nnot forgetting the rope ladder and the portable tent, we quitted \r\nFalcon’s Stream. The animals with their legs tied, were all stationed \r\nin the vehicle. We left abundance of food for those that remained \r\nbehind; the cow, the ass, and the buffalo were harnessed to the \r\ncart; and Fritz mounted on his favourite, the onagra, pranced \r\nalong before us to ascertain the best and smoothest path for \r\nthe cavalcade.\r\n\r\nWe took this time a new direction, which was straight forward \r\nbetween the rocks and the shore, that we might make ourselves \r\nacquainted with every thing contained in the island we seemed \r\ndestined for ever to inhabit.\r\n\r\nIn effect, the line proceeding from Falcon’s Stream to the Great \r\nBay, might be said to be the extent of our dominions; for though \r\nFritz and I had discovered the adjacent exquisite country of \r\nthe buffalos, yet the passage to it by the end of the rocks was \r\nso dangerous, and at so great a distance, that we could not hope \r\nto domiciliate ourselves upon its soil, as we had done on our \r\nside of the rocks. We found, as usual, much difficulty in pushing \r\nthrough the tall tough grass and alternately through the thick \r\nprickly bushes which every where obtruded themselves. We were \r\noften obliged to turn aside while I cut a passage with my hatchet; \r\nbut these accidents seldom failed to reward my toil by the discovery \r\nof different small additions to our general comfort among others, \r\nsome roots of trees curved by nature to serve both for saddles \r\nand yokes for our beasts of burden. I took care to secure several, \r\nand put them in the cart.\r\n\r\nWhen we had spent about an hour in getting forward, we found \r\nourselves at the extremity of the wood, and a most singular \r\nphenomenon presented itself to our view: a small plain, or rather a \r\ngrove of low bushes, to appearance almost covered with flakes of \r\nsnow, lay extended before us. Little Francis was the first to call \r\nour attention to it, he being seated in the cart:—Look, father, \r\ncried he, here is a place quite full of snow; let me get down \r\nand make some snow-balls: Oh, how glad I am that we shall now \r\nhave snow instead of the ugly rain which made us all so uncomfortable!\r\n\r\nI could not resist a hearty laugh; and though sure what we saw \r\ncould not in the midst of such scorching heat be snow, yet I \r\nwas completely at a loss to explain the nature of what in colour \r\nand appearance bore so near a resemblance to it. Suddenly, however, \r\na suspicion crossed my mind, and was soon confirmed by Fritz, \r\nwho had darted forward on his onagra, and now returned with one \r\nhand filled with tufts of a most excellent species of cotton, \r\nso that the whole surface of low bushes was in reality a plantation \r\nof that valuable article. This most useful of almost the whole \r\nrange of vegetable productions bestowed by Providence on man, \r\nwhich with the cost of only a little labour supplies him with \r\napparel and commodious beds for the repose of his limbs, is found \r\nin such abundance in islands, that I had been surprised at not \r\nmeeting with any before. The pods had burst from ripeness, and \r\nthe winds had scattered around their flaky contents; the ground \r\nwas strewed with them, they had gathered in tufts on the bushes, \r\nand they floated gently in the air.\r\n\r\nThe joy of this discovery was almost too great for utterance, \r\nand was shared by all but Francis, who was sorry to lose his \r\npretty snow-balls; and his mother, to soothe his regret, made \r\nthe cotton into balls for him to play with, and promised him \r\nsome new shirts and dresses: then turning to me, she poured out \r\nher kind heart in descriptions of all the comfortable things \r\nshe should make for us, could I construct a spinning-wheel, and \r\nthen a loom for weaving.\r\n\r\nWe collected as much cotton as our bags would hold, and my wife \r\nfilled her pockets with the seed to raise it in our garden at \r\nTent-House.\r\n\r\nIt was now time to proceed; and we took a direction towards a \r\npoint of land which skirted the wood of gourds, and being high \r\ncommanded a view of the adjacent country. I conceived a wish \r\nto remove our establishment to the vicinity of the cotton plantation \r\nand the gourd wood, which furnished so many of the utensils for \r\ndaily use throughout the family. I pleased myself in idea with \r\nthe view of the different colonies of animals I had imagined, \r\nboth winged and quadruped, and in this elevation of my fancy \r\nI even thought it might be practicable to erect a sort of farm-house \r\non the soil, which we might visit occasionally, and be welcomed \r\nby the agreeable sounds of the cackling of our feathered subjects, \r\nwhich would so forcibly remind us of the customs of our forsaken \r\nbut ever cherished country.\r\n\r\nWe accordingly soon reached the high ground, which I found in \r\nall respects favourable to my design; behind, a thick forest \r\ngradually rose above us, which sheltered us from the north wind, \r\nand insensibly declined towards the south, ending in a plain \r\nclothed luxuriantly with grass, shrubs, and plants, and watered \r\nby a refreshing rivulet, which was an incalculable advantage \r\nfor our animals of every kind as well as for ourselves.\r\n\r\nMy plan for a building was approved by all, and we lost no time \r\nin pitching our tent and forming temporary accommodations for \r\ncooking our victuals. When we had refreshed ourselves with a \r\nmeal, we each took up some useful occupation; my wife and the \r\nboys went to work with the cotton, which they thoroughly cleaned \r\nand cleared from bits of the pods or other foreign substance, \r\nand which was then put into the bags and served commodiously \r\nat night for bolsters and mattresses. I for my part resolved \r\nto look about in all directions, that I might completely understand \r\nwhat we should have to depend upon in this place in point of \r\nsafety, salubrity, and general accommodation. I had also to find \r\na tree that would suit for the proposed construction of a boat; \r\nand lastly, to meet if possible with a group of trees at such \r\nfit distances from each other as would assist me in my plan of \r\nerecting my farm. I was fortunate enough in no long time to find \r\nin this last respect exactly what I wanted, and quite near to \r\nthe spot we on many accounts had felt to be so enviable: but \r\nI was not equally successful for my boat, the trees in the vicinity \r\nbeing of too small a bulk to supply the depth necessary for keeping \r\non the surface of the water. I returned to my companions, whom \r\nI found busily employed in preparing excellent beds of the cotton, \r\nupon which at an earlier hour than usual we all retired to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. \r\n\r\n_Completion of two farm-houses;—a lake;—the beast with a bill._\r\n\r\nThe trees that I had chosen for the construction of my farm were \r\nfor the most part one foot in diameter; their growth was tolerably \r\nregular in the form of a parallelogram with its longest side \r\nto the sea, the length being twenty four feet, and the breadth \r\nsixteen. I cut little hollow places or mortices in the trunks, \r\nat the distance of ten feet one above the other, to form two \r\nstories; the upper one I made a few inches shorter before than \r\nbehind, that the roof might be in some degree shelving: I then \r\ninserted beams five inches in diameter respectively in the mortices, \r\nand thus formed the skeleton of my building. We next nailed some \r\nlaths from tree to tree, at equal distances from each other, \r\nto form the roof, and placed on them, in mathematical order, \r\na covering composed of pieces of the bark of trees cut into the \r\nshape of tiles, and in a sloping position for the rain to run \r\noff in the wet season. As we had no great provision of iron nails, \r\nwe used for the purpose the strong pointed thorn of the acacia, \r\nwhich we had discovered the day before. This tree, which bears \r\nan elegant flower, is known by the name of _Acacia with three \r\nthorns_, and it in reality exhibits, growing all together, three \r\nstrong sharp-pointed thorns, which might easily be used as weapons \r\nof defence. We cut down a quantity of them and laid them in the \r\nsun to dry, when they became as hard as iron, and were of essential \r\nservice to our undertaking. We found great difficulty in peeling \r\noff a sufficient quantity of bark from trees to cover our roof. \r\nI began with cutting the bark entirely round at distances of \r\nabout two feet all the length of the trunk; I next divided the \r\nintervals perpendicularly into two parts, which I separated from \r\nthe tree by sliding a wedge under the corners to raise the bark \r\nby degrees; I next placed the pieces on the ground, with stones \r\nlaid on them to prevent their curving, to dry in the sun; and \r\nlastly, I nailed them on the roof, where they had the appearance \r\nof the scales of fishes,—an effect that was not only pleasing \r\nto the eye, but reminded us of the roofs of our native land.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we made another agreeable discovery: my wife \r\ntook up the remaining chips of the bark for lighting a fire, \r\nsupposing they would burn easily; we were surprised by a delicious \r\naromatic odour which perfumed the air. On examining the half-consumed \r\nsubstance, we found some of the pieces to contain turpentine, \r\nand others gum-mastich, so that we might rely on a supply of \r\nthese ingredients from the trees which had furnished the bark. \r\nIt was less with a view to the gratifying our sense of smelling, \r\nthan with the hope of being able to secure these valuable drugs \r\nfor making a sort of pitch to complete our meditated boat, that \r\nwe indulged our earnestness in the pursuit. The instinct of our \r\ngoats, or the acuteness of their smell, discovered for us another \r\nacquisition of a no less pleasing quality; we observed with surprise \r\nthat they ran from a considerable distance to throw themselves \r\nabout on some particular chips of bark which lay on the ground, \r\nand which they began to chew and eat greedily. Jack seized a \r\npiece also, to find out, as he said, what could be the reason \r\nof so marked a preference as the goats had shown. Oh, it is indeed \r\nexcellent, exclaimed he; and I perceive that goats are animals \r\nof taste! Only try this little bit, brother Fritz, and tell us \r\nif it is not exactly like cinnamon? Fritz did as he was desired, \r\nand was of Jack’s opinion. My wife and I then followed their \r\nexample, and were convinced that it was cinnamon, though not \r\nso fine a sort as that from the isle of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThis new commodity was certainly of no great importance to us; \r\nbut we nevertheless regarded it with pleasure, as an article \r\nthat would serve to distinguish some day of particular rejoicing. \r\nErnest and Francis asked to taste it also, and agreed with us \r\nthat the occasional use of it would be agreeable. The tree from \r\nwhich we had taken our bark was old, and the cinnamon was no \r\ndoubt the coarser flavoured on this account: I remembered to \r\nhave read, that young trees produce this spice in much greater \r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nDuring our next meal we amused ourselves with a retrospect of \r\nthe different discoveries we had made that day. I had to relate \r\nto my wife what I knew on the subject of the nature of these \r\nnew productions; the turpentine, the mastich, and the cinnamon. \r\nI informed her that the two first had been discovered by the \r\nVenetians, who had gone so far as the islands of ancient Greece \r\nin search of them, and that they had afterwards become articles \r\nof commerce. And of what use is turpentine? asked Francis.\r\n\r\n_Father._—It is used in medicine; also for varnishes, and in \r\nthe composition of resin; by putting it over the fire and mixing \r\na little oil with it, it makes an excellent kind of pitch, and \r\nin this last form it will be of essential service to me for the \r\nouter coat of my new boat. It is also useful, applied to the \r\nwheels of any sort of carriages.\r\n\r\n_Ernest._—And the mastich, father?\r\n\r\n_Father._—This production comes from a tree of the same name; \r\nit oozes out in drops and hardens in the sun, something like \r\namber. It is used in perfumes, and as a varnish for porcelain, \r\nbeing soluble in spirits of wine. As to cinnamon, I can only \r\ntell you that the best sort is a production of the island of \r\nCeylon; it is gathered from young plants; the outside covering \r\nbeing first taken away, the next coat is the perfect cinnamon, \r\nand its smell is quite delicious; it is put to dry in the sun, \r\nand it rolls of itself into the shapes in which you must have \r\nseen it; they are afterwards tied in small parcels and sewed \r\ninto cotton bags, which are again inclosed in reed matting; lastly, \r\nthe parcels are put into buffalos’ skins, which are as hard and as \r\nimpenetrable as horn. By this process the cinnamon is so effectually \r\npreserved, that it may be safely transported to any distance. \r\nIt is used in Europe for imparting a delicious flavour to the \r\nmore delicate kinds of liqueurs and sweetmeats.\r\n\r\nWhen our meal and the lecture were both ended, we resumed with \r\nardour our undertaking of the farm, which we continued without \r\ninterruption for several days.\r\n\r\nWe formed the walls of our building with matted reeds interwoven \r\nwith pliant laths to the height of six feet; the remaining space \r\nto the roof was inclosed with only a simple grating, that the \r\nair and light might be admitted. A door was placed in the middle \r\nof the front. We next arranged the interior, with as much convenience \r\nas the shortness of the time and our reluctance to use all our \r\ntimber would allow; we divided it half way up by a partition \r\nwall, into two unequal parts; the largest was intended for the \r\nsheep and goats, and the smallest for ourselves, when we should \r\nwish to pass a few days here. At the further end of the stable \r\nwe fixed a house for the fowls, and above it a sort of hay-loft \r\nfor the forage. Before the door of entrance we placed two benches, \r\ncontrived as well as we could of laths and odd pieces of wood, \r\nthat we might rest ourselves under the shade of the trees, and \r\nenjoy the exquisite prospect which presented itself on all sides. \r\nOur own apartment was provided with a couple of the best bedsteads \r\nwe could make of twigs of trees, raised upon four legs two feet \r\nfrom the ground, and these were destined to receive our cotton \r\nmattresses. Our aim was to content ourselves for the present \r\nwith these slight hints of a dwelling, and to consider hereafter \r\nwhat additions either of convenience or ornament could be made, \r\nsuch as plastering, &c. &c. All we were now anxious about, was \r\nto provide a shelter for our animal colonists, which should encourage \r\nand fix them in the habit of assembling every evening in one \r\nplace. For several days, at first, we took care to fill their \r\ntroughs with their favourite food mixed with salt, and we agreed \r\nthat we would return frequently to repeat this indirect mode \r\nof invitation for their society, till they should be entirely \r\nfixed in their expectation of finding it.\r\n\r\nI had imagined we could accomplish what we wished at the farm \r\nin three or four days; but we found in the experiment that a \r\nwhole week was necessary, and our victuals fell short before \r\nour work was done. We began to consider what remedy we could \r\napply to so embarrassing a circumstance; I could not prevail \r\nupon myself to return to Falcon’s Stream before I had completed \r\nmy intentions at the farm, and the other objects of my journey. \r\nI had even come to the determination of erecting another building \r\nupon the site of Cape Disappointment; I therefore decided that \r\non this trying occasion I would invest Fritz and Jack with the \r\nimportant mission. They were accordingly dispatched to Falcon’s \r\nStream and to Tent-House, to fetch new supplies of cheese, ham, \r\npotatoes, dried fish, manioc bread, for our subsistence, and \r\nalso to distribute fresh food to the numerous animals we had \r\nleft there. I directed one to mount the onagra, and the other \r\nthe buffalo. My two knight-errants, proud of their embassy, set \r\noff with a brisk trot; they at my desire took with them the old \r\nass to bring the load of provisions. Fritz was to lead him with \r\na bridle, while Jack smacked a whip near his ears to quicken \r\nhis motions; and certainly, whether from the influence of climate \r\nor the example of his companion the onagra, he had lost much \r\nof his accustomed inactivity: and this was the more important, \r\nas I intended to make a saddle for my wife to get on his back \r\nand relieve herself occasionally from the fatigue of walking.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of our purveyors, I rambled with Ernest about \r\nthe neighbouring soil, to make what new discoveries I could, \r\nand to procure if possible some cocoa-nuts or other valuable \r\naddition to our store of provisions.\r\n\r\nWe followed the winding of a river we had remarked, and which \r\nconducted towards the centre of the wall of rocks; our course \r\nwas here interrupted by an extensive marsh which bordered a small \r\nlake, the aspect of which was enchantingly picturesque. I perceived \r\nwith joyful surprise that the whole surface of this swampy soil \r\nwas covered with a kind of wild rice, ripe on the stalk, and \r\nwhich attracted the voracity of large flocks of birds. As we \r\napproached, a loud rustling was heard, and we distinguished on \r\nthe wing bustards, Canada heath-fowl in abundance, and great numbers \r\nof smaller birds, with the names of which we were unacquainted. \r\nWe succeeded in bringing down five or six of them, and I was \r\npleased to remark in Ernest a justness of aim that promised well \r\nfor the future. The habits of his mind discovered themselves \r\non this as on many previous occasions; he betrayed no ardour, \r\nhe did every thing with a slowness that seemed to imply dislike; \r\nyet the cool deliberation and constancy he applied to every attempt \r\nhe had to engage in, so effectually assisted his judgement, that \r\nhe was sure to arrive at a more perfect execution than the other \r\nboys. He had practised but little in the study of how to fire \r\na gun to the best advantage; but Ernest was a silent inquirer \r\nand observer, and accordingly his first essays were generally \r\ncrowned with success. In this affair, however, of the birds, \r\nhis skill would have proved fruitless, if Jack’s young jackal, \r\nwhich had followed us in our walk, had not plunged courageously \r\ninto the swamp and brought out the birds as they fell.\r\n\r\nAt a small distance was also master Knips, who had taken his \r\npost on Ponto’s back. Presently we saw him jump off and smell \r\nearnestly along the ground among some thick-growing plants, then \r\npluck off something with his two paws and eat of it voraciously. \r\nWe ran to the spot to see what it could be, when, to the infinite \r\nrelief of our parched palates, we found he had discovered there \r\nthe largest and finest kind of strawberry, which is called in \r\nEurope the _Chili_ or _pine strawberry_.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the proud creature, man, generously condescended \r\nto be the imitator of a monkey: we threw ourselves upon the ground, \r\nas near to Knips as we could creep, and devoured as fast as we \r\ncould swallow, till we felt sufficiently refreshed. Many of these \r\nstrawberries were of an enormous size, and Ernest with his usual \r\ncoolness, and I must needs confess there was no want of his constancy \r\neither, devoured an immense quantity: he however recollected \r\nhis absent friends, and filled a small gourd-shell we had brought \r\nwith us with the finest fruit, and then covered them with leaves \r\nand tied them down with a tendril from a neighbouring plant, \r\nthat he might present them in perfection to his mother. I, on \r\nmy part, gathered a specimen of the rice to offer, that she might \r\ninform us if it was fit for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter pursuing our way a little further along the marsh, we reached \r\nthe lake, which we had descried with so much pleasure from a \r\ndistance, and whose banks being overgrown with thick underwood, \r\nwere necessarily concealed from the momentary view we had leisure \r\nto take of surrounding objects, particularly as the lake was \r\nsituated in a deep and abrupt valley. No traveller who is not \r\na native of Switzerland can conceive the emotion which trembled \r\nat my heart, as I contemplated this limpid, azure, undulating, \r\nbody of water, the faithful miniature of so many grand originals, \r\nwhich I had probably lost sight of for ever! My eyes swam with \r\ntears!—How glad I am to see a lake! I could almost think myself \r\nin Switzerland, father, said Ernest.\r\n\r\nAlas, a single glance upon the surrounding pictures, the different \r\ncharacters of the trees, the vast ocean in the distance, destroyed \r\nthe momentary illusion, and brought back our ideas to the painful \r\nreality that we were strangers in a desert island!\r\n\r\nAnother sort of object now presented itself to confirm the certainty \r\nthat we were no longer inhabitants of Europe; it was the appearance \r\nof a quantity of swans which glided over the surface of the lake; \r\nbut their colour, instead of white, like those of our country, \r\nwas a jetty black[23]; and their plumage had so high a gloss \r\nas to produce, reflected in the water, the most astonishing effect. \r\nThe six large feathers of the wing of this bird are white, exhibiting \r\na singular contrast to the rest of the body; in other respects \r\nthese creatures were remarkable, like those of Europe, for the \r\nhaughty gracefulness of their motions, and the voluptuousness \r\nof their nature. We remained a long time in silent admiration \r\nof the scene; some of the swans pursued their course magnificently \r\non the bosom of the blue water; others stopped and seemed to \r\nhold deliberations with their companions, or to admire themselves, \r\nor caress each other; many young ones followed in the train of \r\nthe parent bird, who frequently turned half round in execution \r\nof her watchful and matronly office. This was a spectacle which \r\nI could not allow to be interrupted by bloodshed, though Ernest, \r\nrendered a little vain by his success and my encomiums, would \r\nhave been ready to fire upon the swans, if I had not absolutely \r\nforbidden the attempt; at the same time I consoled him with the \r\npromise that we would endeavour to obtain a pair of the interesting \r\ncreatures for our establishment at Falcon’s Stream.\r\n\r\nPonto just at this moment dragged out of the water a bird he \r\nhad seized; we ran to examine it, and our surprise was extreme \r\non remarking the singularity of its appearance. It was somewhat in \r\nshape like an otter, and, like the tribe of water-birds, web-footed: \r\nits tail was long and erect, and covered with a soft kind of \r\nhair; the head was very small, and the ears and eyes were almost \r\ninvisible; to these more ordinary characters was added, a long \r\nflat bill, like that of a duck, which protruded from its snout, \r\nand produced so ludicrous an effect that we could not resist \r\na hearty laugh. All the science of the learned Ernest, joined \r\nwith my own, was insufficient to ascertain the name and nature \r\nof this animal. We had no resource but to remain ignorant; in \r\nthe mean time we christened it by the name of _Beast with a bill_, \r\nand decided that it should be carefully stuffed and preserved.\r\n\r\nWe now began to look for the shortest path for rejoining our \r\ncompanions at the farm, which we reached at the same time with \r\nFritz and Jack, who had well performed the object of their journey, \r\nand were received by all with satisfaction. We, on our parts, \r\nproduced our offering of strawberries and our specimen of rice, \r\nwhich were welcomed with shouts of pleasure and surprise.\r\n\r\nThe beast with a bill was next examined with eager curiosity[24], \r\nand then laid aside for the plan I had formed. My wife proceeded \r\nto pluck and salt the birds we had killed, reserving one fresh \r\nfor our supper, which we partook of together upon the benches \r\nbefore the door of our new habitation. We filled the stable with \r\nforage, laid a large provision of grain for the fowls within \r\ntheir house, and began arrangements for our departure.\r\n\r\nThe following day we took a silent leave of our animals and directed \r\nour course towards Cape Disappointment. On entering Monkey Wood, \r\ninnumerable animals of the species from which it derives its \r\nname began to scamper away, grinding their teeth in sign of anger \r\nat our approach. We pursued our way, and arrived shortly after \r\nat the eminence we were in pursuit of in the vicinity of Cape \r\nDisappointment; we ascended it, and found it in every respect \r\nadapted to our wishes. From this eminence we had a view over \r\nthe country which surrounded Falcon’s Stream in one direction, and \r\nin others of a richly diversified extent of landscape comprehending \r\nsea, land, and rocks. When we had paused for a short time upon \r\nthe exhaustless beauties of the scene, we agreed with one voice \r\nthat it should be on this spot we would build our second cottage. \r\nA spring of the clearest water issued from the soil near the \r\nsummit, and flowed over its sloping side, forming, in its rapid \r\ncourse, agreeable cascades: in short, every feature of the picture \r\ncontributed to form a landscape worthy the homage of a taste \r\nthe most delicate and refined. I presented my children with an \r\nappropriate word.—Let us build here, exclaimed I, and call the \r\nspot—Arcadia[25]; to which my wife and all agreed.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in again setting to work upon this additional \r\narduous undertaking; our experience at the farm enabled us to \r\nproceed in it with incredible rapidity, and our success was in \r\nevery respect more complete. The building contained a dining-room, \r\ntwo bed-chambers, two stables, and a store-room for preserving \r\nall kinds of provisions for man and beast. We formed the roof \r\nsquare, with four sloping sides, and the whole had really the \r\nappearance of a European cottage, and was finished in the short \r\nspace of six days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. \r\n\r\n_The boat;—progress in the abode of rocks._ \r\n\r\nOur Arcadia being entirely completed, what remained to be done \r\nwas to fix on a tree fit for my project of a boat. After much \r\nsearch, I at length found one of prodigious size, and in most \r\nrespects suitable to my views.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, no very encouraging prospect I had before me, \r\nbeing nothing less than the stripping off a piece of the bark \r\nthat should be eighteen feet in length and five in diameter; \r\nand now I found my rope ladder of signal service; we fastened \r\nit by one end to the nearest branches, and it enabled us to work \r\nwith the saw, as might be necessary, at any height from the ground. \r\nAccordingly, we cut quite round the trunk in two places, and \r\nthen took a perpendicular slip from the whole length between \r\nthe circles; by this means we could introduce the proper utensils \r\nfor raising the rest by degrees, till it was entirely separated. \r\nWe toiled with increasing anxiety, at every moment dreading that \r\nwe should not be able to preserve it from breaking, or uninjured \r\nby our tools. When we had loosened about half, we supported it \r\nby means of cords and pulleys; and when all was at length detached, \r\nwe let it down gently, and with joy beheld it lying safe on the \r\ngrass. Our business was next to mould it to our purpose, while \r\nthe substance continued moist and flexible.\r\n\r\nThe boys observed that we had now nothing more to do, than to \r\nnail a plank at each end, and our boat would be as complete as \r\nthose used by the savages; but, for my own part, I could not \r\nbe contented with a mere roll of bark for a boat; and when I \r\nreminded them of the paltry figure it would make following the \r\npinnace, I heard not another word about the further pains and \r\ntrouble, and they asked eagerly for my instructions. I made them \r\nassist me to saw the bark in the middle, the length of several \r\nfeet from the ends; these two parts I folded over till they ended \r\nin a point, naturally raised; I kept them in this form by the \r\nhelp of the strong glue I had before made from fish-bladders, \r\nand pieces of wood nailed fast over the whole: this operation \r\ntended to widen the boat in the middle, and thus render it of \r\ntoo flat a form; but this we counteracted by straining a cord \r\nall round, which again reduced it to the due proportion, and \r\nin this state we put it in the sun, to harden and fix. Many things \r\nwere still wanting to the completion of my undertaking, but I \r\nhad not with me proper utensils: I therefore dispatched the boys \r\nto Tent-House, to fetch the sledge, and convey it there for our \r\nbetter convenience in finishing.\r\n\r\nBefore our departure for Tent-House we collected several new \r\nplants for the kitchen-garden; and lastly, we made another trip \r\nto the narrow strait at the end of the wall of rocks, resolved, \r\nas I before mentioned, to plant there a sort of fortification \r\nof trees, which should produce the double effect of discouraging \r\nthe invasion of savages, and of allowing us to keep our pigs \r\non the other side, and thus secure our different plantations \r\nfrom the chance of injury. We accomplished all these intentions \r\nto our entire satisfaction, and in addition we placed a slight \r\ndraw-bridge across the river beyond the narrow pass, which we \r\ncould let down or take up at pleasure on our side. We now hastened \r\nour return to Arcadia, and after a night’s repose we loaded the \r\nsledge with the boat and other matters, and returned to Tent-House.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had dispatched some necessary affairs, we resumed \r\nthe completion of the boat: in two days she had received the \r\naddition of a keel, a neat lining of wood, a small flat floor, \r\nbenches, a small mast and triangular sail, a rudder, and a thick \r\ncoat of pitch on the outside, so that the first time we saw her \r\nin the water, we were all in ecstasies at the charming appearance \r\nshe made.\r\n\r\nOur cow in the mean time had brought forth a young calf, a male; \r\nI pierced its nostril, as I had so successfully practised with \r\nthe buffalo, and it gave promise of future docility and strength.\r\n\r\nWe had still two months in prospect before the rainy season, \r\nand we employed them for completing our abode in the grotto, \r\nwith the exception of such ornaments as we might have time to \r\nthink of during the long days of winter. We made the internal \r\ndivisions of planks, and that which separated us from the stables, \r\nof stone, to protect us from the offensive smell occasioned by \r\nthe animals. Our task was difficult, but from habit it became \r\neasier every day. We took care to collect or manufacture a sufficient \r\nquantity of all sorts of materials, such as beams and planks, \r\nreeds and twigs for matting, pieces of gypsum for plaster, &c. \r\n&c. At length the time of the rainy season was near at hand, \r\nand this once we thought of it with pleasure, as the period that \r\nwould put us in possession of the enjoyments we had procured \r\nby such unremitting industry and fatigue. We had an inexpressible \r\nlonging to find ourselves domiciliated and at leisure to converse \r\ntogether on the subject of all the wondrous benefits bestowed \r\nupon us by an ever-watchful and beneficent Providence!\r\n\r\nWe plastered over the walls of the principal apartments on each \r\nside with the greatest care, finishing them by pressure with \r\na flat smooth board, and lastly a wash of size, in the manner \r\nof the plasterers in Europe. This ornamental portion of our work \r\namused us all so much, that we began to think we might venture \r\na step further in the question of European luxury, and we agreed \r\nthat we would attempt to make some carpets with the hair of our \r\ngoats. To this effect, we smoothed the ground in the rooms we \r\nintended to distinguish, with great care; then spread over it \r\nsome sail cloth, which my wife had joined in breadths, and fitted \r\nexactly; we next strewed the goats’ hair, mixed with wool obtained \r\nfrom the sheep, over the whole; on this surface we threw some \r\nhot water, in which a strong cement had been dissolved; the whole \r\nwas then rolled up, and was beaten for a considerable time with \r\nhard sticks; the sail cloth was now unrolled, and the inside \r\nagain sprinkled, rolled, and beaten as before; and this process \r\nwas continued till the substance had become a sort of felt, which \r\ncould be separated from the sail-cloth, and was lastly put in \r\nthe sun to harden. We thus produced a very tolerable substitute \r\nfor that enviable article of European comfort, a carpet: of these \r\nwe completed two; one for our parlour, and the other for our \r\ndrawing-room, as we jocosely named them, both of which were \r\ncompletely fit for our reception by the time the rains had set in.\r\n\r\nAll we had suffered during this season in the preceding year \r\ndoubled the value of the comforts and conveniences with which \r\nwe were now surrounded. We were never tired of admiring our warm \r\nand well-arranged apartments, lighted with windows, and well \r\nsecured with doors from wind and rain, and our granary filled \r\nwith more than a sufficient winter supply of food for ourselves \r\nand for our cattle. In the morning, our first care was to feed \r\nand give them drink; and both these were now constantly at hand, \r\nwithout the pains of fetching or preparing: after this we assembled \r\nin the parlour, where prayers were read, and breakfast immediately \r\nserved: we then adjourned to the common room, where all sorts \r\nof industry went forward, and which contained the spinning-wheel \r\nand loom I had, though with indifferent success, constructed \r\nto gratify my wife. Here all united in the business of producing \r\ndifferent kinds of substances, which she afterwards made into \r\napparel. I had also contrived to construct a turning machine, \r\nhaving used for the purpose one of the small cannon wheels, with \r\nthe help of which the boys and I managed to produce some neat \r\nutensils for general use. After dinner, our work was resumed \r\ntill night, when we lighted candles; and as they cost no more \r\nthan our own trouble in collecting and manufacturing the materials, \r\nwe did not refuse ourselves the pleasure of using many at a time, \r\nto admire their lights splendidly reflected by the crystals every \r\nwhere pendent. We had formed a convenient portion of our dwelling \r\ninto a small chapel, in which we left the crystals as produced \r\nby nature; and they exhibited a wondrous assemblage of colonnades, \r\nporticos, altars, which, when the place was lighted to supply \r\nthe want of a window, presented a truly enchanting spectacle. \r\nDivine service was performed in it regularly every Sunday: I \r\nhad raised a sort of pulpit, from which I pronounced such discourses \r\nas I had framed for the instruction of my affectionate group \r\nof auditors. The remainder of this day of rest was employed as \r\nbefore, in such recreations as tended to sustain cheerfulness, \r\nand fortify the bodily health of all. Jack and Francis had a \r\nnatural inclination for music. I did the most I could in making \r\na flageolet apiece for them of two reeds, on which they so frequently \r\npractised as to attain a tolerable proficiency; they accompanied \r\ntheir mother, who had a sweet-toned voice, the volume of which \r\nwas doubled by the echoes of the grottos, and they produced together \r\na very pleasing little concert.\r\n\r\nThus, as will be perceived, we had made the first steps towards \r\na condition of civilization: separated from society, condemned \r\nperhaps to pass the remainder of life in this desert island, \r\nwe yet possessed the means of happiness; we had abundance of \r\nall the necessaries, and many of the comforts desired by human \r\nbeings! We had fixed habits of activity and industry; we were \r\nin ourselves serene and contented; our bodily health and strength \r\nincreased from day to day; the sentiment of tender attachment \r\nwas perfect in every heart: we every day acquired some new and \r\nstill improving channel for the exertion of our physical and \r\nmoral faculties; we everywhere beheld, and at all times acknowledged, \r\nmarks of the divine wisdom and goodness; our minds were penetrated \r\nwith love, gratitude, and veneration for the celestial Providence \r\nwho had so miraculously rescued and preserved us, and conducted \r\nus to the true destination of man—to provide for the wants of \r\nhis offspring by the labour of his hands: I trusted in the same \r\ngoodness for restoring us once more to the society of our fellow-men, \r\nor for bestowing upon us the means of founding in this desert \r\na happy and flourishing colony of human beings, and waiting in \r\nsilence for the further manifestation of his holy will, we passed \r\nour days in a course of industry, innocent pleasures, and reciprocal \r\naffection. Nearly two years have elapsed without our perceiving \r\nthe smallest trace of civilised or savage man; without the appearance \r\nof a single vessel or canoe upon the vast sea, by which we are \r\nsurrounded. Ought we then to indulge a hope that we shall once \r\nagain behold the face of a fellow-creature?—We encourage serenity \r\nand thankfulness in each other, and wait with resignation the \r\nevent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostscript by the Editor. \r\n\r\nI have presented the public, and in particular the sons of families, \r\nwith the part I had in my possession of the journal of the Swiss \r\npastor, who, with his family, were shipwrecked on a desert island. \r\nIt cannot escape the observation of the parents who will read \r\nthe work, that it exhibits a lively picture of the happiness which \r\ndoes not fail to result from the practice of moral virtues:—thus, \r\nin a situation that seemed calculated to produce despair, we see piety, \r\naffection, industry, and a generous concern for fellow-sufferings, \r\ncapable of forming the basis of an unexpected state of serenity \r\nand happiness. We also see the advantage of including in the \r\neducation of boys, such a knowledge of the natural productions \r\nof the earth, of the various combinations by which they may be \r\nrendered serviceable, and of the use of tools of every kind, \r\nas may qualify them to assist others, or preserve themselves \r\nunder every possible occurrence of adversity or danger. It now \r\nremains for me to inform the reader by what means the journal \r\nof the Swiss pastor came into my possession.\r\n\r\nThree or four years subsequent to the occurrence of the shipwreck \r\nof the pastor and his family, an English transport was driven \r\nby the violence of a tempest upon the same shore. The name of \r\nthe vessel was the _Adventurer, Captain Johnson_: it was on a \r\nvoyage from New Zealand to the eastern coast of North America, \r\nby Otaheita, in the South Seas to fetch a cargo of skins and \r\nfurs for China, and to proceed from Canton to England. A violent \r\ntempest of several days’ duration drove it from its track. The \r\nvessel beat about in unknown seas for many days, and was now \r\nso injured by the weather, that the best hope of the captain \r\nand his company was to get into some port where they might refit. \r\nThey at length discovered a rocky coast; and as the wind had \r\nsomewhat abated, they made with all speed for the shore; when \r\nwithin a short distance, they cast their anchor, and put out \r\na boat containing some of the officers, to examine the coast \r\nand find a place for landing: they rowed backward and forward \r\nfor some time without success, from the rocky nature of the soil; \r\nat length they turned a promontory, and perceived a bay whose \r\ncalm waters seemed to invite their approach; this was the _Safety \r\nBay_ of the wrecked islanders; the boat put on shore, and the \r\nofficers with astonishment beheld the traces of the abode of \r\nman. A handsome well-conditioned pinnace and a small boat were \r\nthere at anchor: near the strand, under a rock was a tent, and \r\nfurther on, in the rock, a house-door and windows announced European \r\ncomforts and workmanship. The officers advanced towards the spot, \r\nand were met half-way by a man of middle age, dressed like a \r\nEuropean and armed with a gun; the stranger accosted them with \r\nfriendly tones and gestures; he spoke first German, and then \r\nsome words in English. Lieutenant Bell, one of the English officers, \r\nwho spoke the German language, answered. A mutual confidence \r\nimmediately ensued. We need not add, that the stranger was the \r\nFamily Robinson, whose wife and children happened at the moment \r\nto be at Falcon’s Stream:—he had discovered the English ship \r\nin the morning with his glass; and unwilling to alarm his family, \r\nhe had come, perceiving she bore that way, alone to the coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The officers advanced towards the spot, and were \r\nmet halfway by the Pastor]\r\n\r\nAfter an interchange of cordial feelings, and a hospitable reception \r\nof the officers at the grotto, the Swiss pastor put his journal \r\ninto the hands of Lieutenant Bell, to be conveyed to Captain \r\nJohnson, that he also might become acquainted with the story \r\nof the solitary islanders. After an hour’s conversation the newly \r\nfound friends separated, in the pleasing expectation of meeting \r\nagain on the following day.—But Heaven had otherwise ordained.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the tempest revived with new terrors. The Adventurer \r\ncould not be held at anchor, but was obliged to steer for safety \r\nto the bosom of the ocean. As there was no favourable change \r\nof weather for several days, the vessel was driven so far from \r\nthe coast of Safety Bay, as to leave no possibility of returning, \r\nand Captain Johnson was compelled to renounce the gratification \r\nof seeing this extraordinary family, or of proposing to convey \r\nthem all to Europe.\r\n\r\nCaptain Johnson brought the journal of the Swiss pastor to England, \r\nfrom whence it was transmitted to a friend in Switzerland, who \r\nhas deemed its contents an instructive lesson to the world. There \r\nwas found attached to the journal a rough sketch of the features \r\nof the island, which Lieutenant Bell thinks the Swiss pastor \r\ninformed him was executed by his son Fritz.—The editor subjoins \r\nit, supposing it will be considered an object worthy of the interest \r\nof his young readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES. \r\n\r\n[1] _Penguin_; a bird of the goose kind, found near the Straits \r\nof Magellan. It is about the size of the Indian cock; the feathers \r\non the back are black, and on the belly white. It has a large \r\nneck, circled round with a white collar. Properly speaking, it \r\nhas no wings, but two pinions hang like two little arms from \r\nits sides, having no feathers beyond the joint. These pinions \r\nserve the purpose of fins in enabling the penguin to swim with \r\nease, but it cannot fly. The tail is short, the feet black; the \r\nbeak narrow, and rather larger than that of the raven. The bird \r\ncarries its head erect in walking, and the pinions fall at its \r\nside; so that when many of them are seen in a line along the \r\nshore, where they are accustomed to assemble in large numbers, \r\nthey may from a distance be mistaken for little men. Their flesh \r\nis well-tasted, but their skin is so tough that, but for the \r\nextreme stupidity of their nature, it would be difficult to destroy \r\nthem.—See _Valmont de Bromare_.\r\n\r\n[2] _Great bustard_; of the gallinaceous order. This is the largest \r\nbird of European climates, the male being four feet in length \r\nfrom the beak to the tail, seven in breadth with the wings extended, \r\nand weighing about thirty-five pounds. The females are commonly \r\na third less in every respect. Though the wings of the bustard \r\nare small in proportion to the body, yet the bird can raise and \r\nsustain itself in the air, but, cannot proceed out of a straight \r\ndirection. It loves open, spacious plains, and avoids the water. \r\nThe bustard is timid and difficult of approach; it however defends \r\nitself furiously when attempted to be caught, by beating the \r\nenemy with its legs. If taken when young, it is easily tamed, \r\nand brought to feed with other poultry. The most common colour \r\nof this bird is black, slightly tinged with red on the back, \r\nand the under parts white mixed with fawn-colour; a down of bright \r\npink appears at the roots of the feathers. There are many kinds \r\nof this animal, both indigenous and exotic: the African; the \r\ntufted; the blue; the white bustard, &c.—See _New Dictionary \r\nof Natural History_.\r\n\r\n[3] _Yguana_; a reptile of the family of lizards; it is found \r\nin South America and its islands. The animal is from four to \r\nsix feet in length, of which the tail makes at least half. The \r\nhead is small, flattened at the sides, covered with scales, and \r\nprovided with large jaws and sharp-pointed teeth. A protuberance \r\nlike a wen appears in the front of the neck. The body is every \r\nwhere clothed with hard scales. The colour of this creature is \r\nvariable; its most common hue is green tinged with yellow; sometimes \r\nit exhibits gray or blue tints, and at others a mixture of all \r\nthese colours together, like the cameleon, which the yguana greatly \r\nresembles.—See _New Dictionary of Natural History_.\r\n\r\n[4] _Lizards_; The whole family are found to love music passionately; \r\na sure means of attracting them is by musical sounds or whistling; in \r\nthis manner the yguana is subdued. When the musician is sufficiently \r\nnear, he plunges the end of a switch into the nostril of the \r\nanimal, who dies instantly without pain.—_Dictionary of Natural \r\nHistory_.\r\n\r\n[5] _Tetrix. (Canadian Heath Cock.)_ This bird is found also \r\nin Maryland, Pennsylvania, and adjacent parts. Its modes of life \r\nare similar to the heath-cock of Europe, and is called by some \r\nauthors simply the _crested heath-cock_. The head and neck are \r\nof a deep glossy black, which in all other parts is tinctured \r\nwith green. The bill is covered with a yellow skin, except at \r\nthe extremity, where it is bare and black; the eyes are also \r\nencircled with a skin of the same colour. On the top of its head \r\nthere is a crest formed of several handsome feathers two inches \r\nand a half in length. The feathers on the neck, which are also \r\nof a beautiful fibre form, fall gracefully down; but when the \r\ncreature is agitated, they as well as those on the head become \r\nerect. When he wishes to call his females round him, the feathers \r\nassume this state; he trains his wings on the ground and spreads \r\nhis tail into the form of a wheel, and in the velocity of his \r\nmotions makes a singular kind of noise like distant thunder or \r\na muffled drum.—_New Dictionary of Natural History._\r\n\r\n[6] _Myrica cerifera_, or _Waxtree_; it grows in Louisiana, and \r\na smaller kind in Carolina. It is a pretty aquatic shrub and \r\nbears whitish-coloured flowers, the fruit of which hangs in small \r\nclusters. It is about the height of a very small cherry-tree, \r\nand in the form and smell of the leaves resembles the myrtle. The \r\nberries are of a gray colour, contain kernels which are covered with \r\na kind of wax, of which the natives make good candles. Naturalists \r\nare of opinion that it might be easily made to flourish in other \r\nclimates.—See _Valmont de Bromare_, and _Dictionary of Natural \r\nHistory_.\r\n\r\n[7] _Tuiete_. This is the smallest kind of Brazilian parrot. \r\nThere is an infinite variety in their plumage.\r\n\r\n[8] Among others, M. Huber of Geneva: he has published a volume \r\nof his observations upon ants, no less agreeable than instructive \r\nin the perusal.\r\n\r\n[9] See _History of the Insects of America_. By Mademoiselle \r\nMerian.\r\n\r\n[10] _Caoutchouc_; The tree which furnishes _elastic gum_; it \r\nis called by the natives of Brazil, where it is produced, _Hhevé_.\r\n\r\n[11] Of all the palm-trees which are natives of Asia, the _sago-palmist_ \r\nis one of the most useful and interesting: a liquor runs from \r\nincisions made in its trunk, which readily ferments, and is Both \r\nsalutary and agreeable for drinking. The marrow or pith of the \r\ntree, after undergoing a slight preparation, is the substance \r\nknown by the name of sago in Europe, and so eminently useful in \r\nthe list of nutritious food for the sick. The trunk and large leaves \r\nof the palmist-sago are a powerful resource in the construction \r\nof buildings; the first furnishes planks for the carpenter, and \r\nthe second a covering for the roof. From the last are also made \r\ncord, matting, and other articles of domestic use.\r\n\r\n[12] This species of the _orange_, or rather of the _citron-tree_, \r\noriginally a native of Medea and Assyria, reaches in those countries \r\nto the astonishing height of sixty feet.—Dictionary of Natural \r\nHistory.\r\n\r\n[13] _Cabbage palmist_.—Palmist is the generical and vulgar name \r\nfor all palm-trees which bear at their tops a vegetable production \r\nwhich may be eaten before it has arrived at a state of maturity. \r\nWhat is called cabbage, is the closely-folded leaves, which assume \r\nthe form of that plant, at the summit of the tree, which attains to \r\na prodigious height in the Society Islands. This cabbage substance, \r\nwhen young, has a delicate flavour not unlike an artichoke, and \r\nis excellent fried; but the tree dies when the cabbage is cut \r\noff. This kind of palm, and indeed all others, has numerous uses. \r\nOn cutting the cabbage, the tree yields some pints of a liquor \r\nsimilar to champaign, and which by the process of fermentation \r\nwill afterwards produce good vinegar; and by distillation, a \r\nstrong alcohol or brandy. Its seed or kernel furnishes a thick \r\nsweet oil or vegetable butter. The covering of the kernels is \r\nmade into vessels and cups of all sorts, and is as strong as \r\nporcelain. The leaves are used as tiles on the roofs of houses, \r\nfor parasols and coverings for the head, and may be written upon, \r\nlike paper. Its ligneous stalk produces large threads for sewing, \r\nand for string. Some of the palms, the cocoa-palmist in particular, \r\nyields cool sweet liquid which by evaporation leaves a sugar \r\nof a tolerably good quality. In a word, the palm is a far-extended \r\ngood, an inestimable treasure bestowed by a bountiful Providence \r\non the inhabitants of the soil which produces it.\r\n\r\n[14] _Buffalo_; a ruminating quadruped of the ox species, which \r\nit nearly resembles in form and stature; the head is larger, \r\nthe snout longer, and its horns, which almost touch at the root, \r\nspread to a distance of five feet at their extremities: its ears \r\nare also larger and pointed. The whole form of the buffalo, and \r\nno less its motions, announce amazing vigour and strength; but \r\nthe enormous size of the head, the singular curvatures of its \r\nlong horns, under which appears a large tuft of bristly hair \r\nof a yellowish white colour, give a terrific ferocity and wildness \r\nto its physiognomy. The animal inhabits hot countries. It is \r\nused in Italy as a domestic beast for tillage and drawing. The \r\nmethod adopted for taming the buffalo is by fixing a ring in \r\nthe nostril when about three years old. The operator contrives \r\nto entangle the legs with a string, and the animal falls to the \r\nground; several men fall upon it and confine the legs, while \r\nothers make the wound and pass the ring; it is then left: it \r\nruns furiously from place to place, and endeavours to get rid \r\nof the ring; in a short time it begins to be accustomed to its \r\nfate, and by degrees to learn obedience. A cord is fastened to \r\nthe ring to lead the buffalo; if it resists, it suffers pain; \r\nit therefore prefers to yield, and thus is brought to follow \r\na conductor willingly. After a certain time, the ring falls off, \r\nbut the creature has, ere this, become attached, and will follow \r\nits master. Nothing is more common than to see a buffalo return \r\nfrom a distance of forty miles to seek him. Their young keepers \r\ngive them a name, which they never fail to answer to, and on \r\nhearing it pronounced they stop short in the midst of a company \r\nof their species. Troops of buffaloes are found together in the \r\nplains of America and Asia that are washed by rivers; they do \r\nnot attack men unless provoked; but the report of a gun renders \r\nthem furious, and extremely dangerous: they run straight to the \r\nenemy, throw him down with their horns, and do not desist till \r\nhe is crushed to death in the struggle. A red colour irritates \r\nthem, and they are hunted with infinite care and precaution. \r\n—_Dictionary of Natural History_.\r\n\r\n[15] _Prickly palm_, or _Adam’s needle_.—The leaves of this tree \r\nare sometimes ten feet in length; they are winged in form, and \r\nthe petals are furnished with long sharp thorns, which stay on \r\nthe trunk even when the leaves are decayed, and form, from their \r\nnumbers and strength, a sure defence against being approached. \r\nThe fruit of this tree is larger than a pigeon’s egg, of an oblong \r\nshape, of a yellow colour, and like velvet to the touch. A yellow \r\noily substance is found in the covering of the fruit, which is \r\ngreedily eaten by monkeys, cows, and other animals. An oil for \r\ncooking or for the lamp is also extracted from it.\r\n\r\n_Dwarf palm_.—The fruit is yellow, and contains grains inclosed \r\nin a cuticle, somewhat sour to the taste. Savages make an agreeable \r\nkind of beverage from them. The leaf, like the former, is thorny. \r\n—_Dictionary of Natural History_.\r\n\r\n[16] _Malabar_ or _Indian Eagle_, is small; not above the size \r\nof a large pigeon; but in the smallness of its volume elegance \r\nof symmetry and beauty of plumage are united; the animation of \r\nits eyes, its lively movements, the boldness of its look and \r\nattitudes, give to its whole physiognomy the appearance of pride \r\nand courage. The Malayese have made it one of their idols, and \r\noffer it a kind of worship. A tuft of large feathers of a dazzling \r\nwhite, the lower part of which is of a deep shining black, covers \r\nthe head, the neck, and all the breast of this handsome bird; \r\nthe rest of the plumage is of a very bright chesnut-colour, with \r\nthe exception of the tip of the six first feathers of each wing, \r\nwhich is black. The beak is ash-coloured, and of a yellowish \r\ngreen at the point; its membrane is blue, feet yellow, talons \r\nblack. This species is found in Malabar, Visapour, the Mogul \r\nEmpire, &c. In voracity it does not fall short of any other. \r\n—_Dictionary of Natural History_.\r\n\r\n[17] Mr. Huber Lullin, of Geneva, has published an excellent \r\ntreatise on the economy of _bees_ he has given the most singular \r\nand best-attested circumstances of the queen bee; but what more \r\nastonishes is, that he, who has thrown such lights on this attractive \r\nobject of natural history, is blind.\r\n\r\n[18] _Onagra_, _Œigitai_ and _Koulan_;—apparently different names \r\nfor the same animal, varying according to the countries where, \r\nit is found and authors who have spoken of it: in shape and structure \r\nit holds the midway betwixt the horse and ass; its head is strong \r\nand erect in the state of rest; it proudly snuffs the air in \r\nits course, which is more fleet than the swiftest horse. Its \r\nneck finely turned, chest full and open, back long, spine concave \r\nand rough, haunches taper, hoofs like the ass, mane short and \r\nthick, the jaw containing thirty-four teeth, tail two feet long, \r\nand exactly like a cow’s, shoulders narrow and bare of flesh: \r\nit has great suppleness in all its members and motions. The hair \r\nis mostly of a yellowish brown; a reddish yellow covers the fore-part \r\nof the head, and between the legs; the mane and tail are black. \r\nAlong the back is a dark-brown stripe, that grows broader from \r\nthe loins upwards, and becomes narrower towards the tail. In \r\nwinter its hair is long, curled, waving; in summer short and \r\nglossy. These animals stray in numbers over the vast deserts \r\nand open plains abounding with saline herbage: they never approach \r\nthe woods or mountains. They have the senses of hearing and smelling \r\nin perfection. Their neighing, somewhat peculiar, is much louder \r\nthan that of the horse. They are timid and wild, and their chief \r\ndefence is in their speed; yet they are of a peaceful, social \r\nnature. They commonly troop together from twenty to thirty, sometimes \r\na hundred: each troop has its leader that watches over its safety, \r\nconducts it, and gives the signal of flight when danger is near. \r\nThe token of alarm is bounding thrice round the object of their fear. \r\nIf their leader is killed, (and he frequently is, by approaching \r\ncloser to the hunters than the rest,) the troop disperses, and \r\nit is easy to kill and take them. The Mongou Tartars highly prize \r\nthe flesh, which they find delicious; but the œigitai has not \r\nyet been tamed, even when taken young. Could it be domesticated, \r\nit would doubtless be a prime beast for the saddle, but it is \r\nof an untameable disposition; when the utmost attempts have been \r\nmade to subdue them, they have died in breaking rather than submit to \r\nthe restraint. If our Swiss Robinson succeeded by the extraordinary \r\nmeans he specifies, it was a complete triumph. The name of œigitai, \r\napplied to the onagra or wild ass in the countries where it is \r\nmost common, comes from the word _dshiggetei_, which in the Tartar \r\nlanguage means _long ears_ in fact its ears are very long, but \r\nmore erect, and better shaped, than those of the ass.\r\n\r\n[19] _Phormion_, or _Flax-plant_;—a plant of New Zealand made \r\nknown by Cook. The inhabitants of that island get from its leaves \r\na very strong flax, with which they make stuffs, nets, ropes, \r\n&c. They are two or three feet long, two inches broad, shaped \r\nlike a sword. Steeped in water, they produce fibres longer and \r\nstronger than those of flax, and which are equal in fineness. \r\nThe climate where this useful plant is found, inclines one to \r\nthink it might be cultivated with success in Europe, and turned \r\nto considerable account. When these leaves are opened upon the \r\nplant, an inodorous gum issues from them, which is transparent, \r\nof a straw-colour, and in every respect similar to gum arabic.\r\n\r\n[20] _Sal-gem_;—a name given to a kind of salt harder than common \r\nsalt, and which sometimes has the transparency and colour of \r\nprecious stones. It is found invariably in the same soil as gypsum, \r\nin the neighbourhood of which constant observation has proved \r\nit to be never wanting; and even the strata of salt and gypsum \r\nfrequently alternate. The sal-gem forms itself sometimes into \r\nlarge undivided beds, sometimes it runs in large detached cubes, \r\nbehind beds of clay and rock. The mines (I may say the quarries) \r\nof sal-gem are found at every height, and now and then on a level \r\nwith the plains. In all parts of the known world no production \r\nof nature is more abundant than salt. Most of the sal-gem mines \r\nin Spain and England are of several hundred feet extent. The \r\ntown of Cardona in Spain is situated at the foot of a rock of \r\nsolid salt, rising almost perpendicular to the height of four \r\nor five hundred feet, without interstice, fissure, or separate \r\nlayer. This immense mass of salt is about a league in circuit: \r\nits depth, and consequently the bed on which it rests, is unknown. \r\nFrom top to bottom the salt is of the purest white, or of a light \r\ntransparent blue. This prodigious mountain of salt, quite free \r\nfrom gypsum and other extraneous matter, is the only one of the \r\nkind in Europe. In the county of Chester in England, near the \r\nIrish sea, is a very extensive mine of sal-gem behind a ledge \r\nof rock; and after having worked through twenty-five feet of \r\nsalt, in several places of a fine deep red, from twelve to fifteen \r\nfeet of rock again appeared, and salt under that; a fact which \r\ndestroys the hypothesis of sal-gem being produced from saline \r\nlakes dried up.—_Dictionary of Natural History_.\r\n\r\n[21] _Sea Dog_; a sea fish; partakes in some respects of the \r\nnature of the shark.—See _Dictionary of Natural History._\r\n\r\n[22] _Gypsum_.—A mineral substance composed of chalk and sulphurous \r\nacid: in strictness it may be considered as a neutral salt; but \r\nbeing soluble only in a small degree, and having the external \r\ncharacter of stone, mineralogists class it as a stony substance. \r\nIt has abundance of varieties.\r\n\r\n[23] _Black Swan_;—Discovered by M. de la Billardiere on a lake \r\nof New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[24] _Beast with a bill_.—This singular creature was, like the \r\nlast, discovered in a lake of New Zealand; a particular account \r\nof it may be found in Blumenbach’s Natural History, published \r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\n[25] _Arcadia_, according to the poets was the most beautiful \r\nand the happiest of all countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END. \r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by Richard and Arthur Taylor, Shoe-Lane, London._\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA. \r\n\r\nThe following obvious typographical errors have been corrected: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I, Volume I\r\n\r\nOn page 9: Changed “asistance” to “assistance”.\r\n\r\nOn page 39: Changed “said my father” to “said I”.\r\n\r\nOn page 47: Added missing “Chapter III” header.\r\n\r\nOn page 94: Added missing “to” in “Fritz whispered to me”.\r\n\r\nOn page 95: Removed errant comma from “sharpened, at one end”.\r\n\r\nOn page 138: Changed “the metal and the thread” to “the leather \r\nand the thread”.\r\n\r\nOn page 139: Changed “permittted” to “permitted”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I, Volume II\r\n\r\nOn page 4: Changed “sowing” and “sow” to “sewing” and “sew”.\r\n\r\nOn page 13: Added comma in “such as the turkey, the peacock”.\r\n\r\nOn page 61: Changed “betwen” to “between”.\r\n\r\nOn page 62: Changed “tress” to “trees”.\r\n\r\nOn page 69: Changed “of my wood” to “of dry wood”.\r\n\r\nOn page 78: Changed “durnig” to “during”.\r\n\r\nOn page 102: Changed “ourseves” to “ourselves”.\r\n\r\nOn page 113: Added missing quotation mark in “‘He, who in his \r\nEarthly Abode”.\r\n\r\nOn page 114: Changed “acionst” to “actions”.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nOn page 15: Changed “meriment” to “merriment”.\r\n\r\nOn page 69: Changed “acccompanying” to “accompanying”.\r\n\r\nOn page 120: Changed “fetras” to “tetrix” (per an original Erratum \r\neditor’s note, which has been removed).\r\n\r\nOn page 204: Changed “Falcoln’s Stream” to “Falcon’s Stream”.\r\n\r\nOn page 247: Deleted repeated word in “whom he at at once loved”.\r\n\r\nOn page 269: Added “to” in “gave it to me”.\r\n\r\nOn page 312: Changed “albatrossas” to “albatrosses”.\r\n\r\nOn page 336: Deleted repeated word in “with a draught of of a \r\ncool refreshing liquid”.\r\n\r\nOn page 351: Changed “soeffe ctually” to “so effectually”.\r\n\r\nOn page 354: Changed “exmine” to “examine”.",
