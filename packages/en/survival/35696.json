Summing up                                308\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMen have written wisely and usefully, in illustration and aid of\r\nAgriculture, from the platform of pure science. Acquainted with the laws\r\nof vegetable growth and life, they so expounded and elucidated those\r\nlaws that farmers apprehended and profitably obeyed them. Others have\r\nwritten, to equally good purpose, who knew little of science, but were\r\nadepts in practical agriculture, according to the maxims and usages of\r\nthose who have successfully followed and dignified the farmer's calling.\r\nI rank with neither of these honored classes. My practical knowledge of\r\nagriculture is meager, and mainly acquired in a childhood long bygone;\r\nwhile, of science, I have but a smattering, if even that. They are\r\nright, therefore, who urge that my qualifications for writing on\r\nagriculture are slender indeed.\r\n\r\nI only lay claim to an invincible willingness to be made wiser to-day\r\nthan I was yesterday, and a lively faith in the possibility--nay, the\r\nfeasibility, the urgent necessity, the imminence--of very great\r\nimprovements in our ordinary dealings with the soil. I know that a\r\nmajority of those who would live by its tillage feed it too sparingly\r\nand stir it too slightly and grudgingly. I know that we do too little\r\nfor it, and expect it, thereupon, to do too much for us. I know that, in\r\nother pursuits, it is only work thoroughly well done that is liberally\r\ncompensated; and I see no reason why farming should prove an exception\r\nto this stern but salutary law. I may be, indeed, deficient in knowledge\r\nof what constitutes good farming, but not in faith that the very best\r\nfarming is that which is morally sure of the largest and most certain\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nI hope to be generally accorded the merit of having set forth the little\r\nI pretend to know in language that few can fail to understand. I have\r\navoided, so far as I could, the use of terms and distinctions unfamiliar\r\nto the general ear. The little I know of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,\r\n&c., I have kept to myself; since whatever I might say of them would be\r\nuseless to those already acquainted with the elementary truths of\r\nChemistry, and only perplexing to others. If there is a paragraph in the\r\nfollowing pages which will not be readily and fully understood by an\r\naverage school-boy of fifteen years, then I have failed to make that\r\nparagraph as simple and lucid as I intended.\r\n\r\nMany farmers are dissuaded from following the suggestions of writers on\r\nagriculture by the consideration of expense. They urge that, though men\r\nof large wealth may (perhaps) profitably do what is recommended, their\r\nmeans are utterly inadequate: they might as well be urged to work their\r\noxen in a silver yoke with gold bows. I have aimed to commend mainly, if\r\nnot uniformly, such improvements only on our grandfathers' husbandry as\r\na farmer worth $1,000, or over, may adopt--not all at once, but\r\ngradually, and from year to year. I hope I shall thus convince some\r\nfarmers that draining, irrigation, deep plowing, heavy fertilizing, &c.,\r\nare not beyond their power, as so many have too readily presumed and\r\npronounced them.\r\n\r\nThat I should say very little, and that little vaguely, of the breeding\r\nand raising of animals, the proper time to sow or plant, &c., &c., can\r\nneed no explanation. By far the larger number of those whose days have\r\nmainly been given to farming, know more than I do of these details, and\r\nare better authority than I am with regard to them. On the other hand, I\r\nhave traveled extensively, and not heedlessly, and have seen and\r\npondered certain broader features of the earth's improvement and tillage\r\nwhich many stay-at-home cultivators have had little or no opportunity to\r\nstudy or even observe. By restricting the topics with which I deal, the\r\nprobability of treating some of them to the average farmer's profit is\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAnd, whatever may be his judgment on this slight work, I _know_ that, if\r\nI could have perused one of like tenor half a century ago, when I was a\r\npatient worker and an eager reader in my father's humble home, my\r\nsubsequent career would have been less anxious and my labors less\r\nexhausting than they have been. Could I then have caught but a glimpse\r\nof the beneficent possibilities of a farmer's life--could I have\r\nrealized that he is habitually (even though blindly) dealing with\r\nproblems which require and reward the amplest knowledge of Nature's\r\nlaws, the fullest command of science, the noblest efforts of the human\r\nintellect, I should have since pursued the peaceful, unobtrusive round\r\nof an enthusiastic and devoted, even though not an eminent or fortunate,\r\ntiller of the soil. Even the little that is unfolded in the ensuing\r\npages would have sufficed to give me a far larger, truer, nobler\r\nconception of what the farmer of moderate means might and should be,\r\nthan I then attained. I needed to realize that observation and\r\nreflection, study and mental acquisition, are as essential and as\r\nserviceable in his pursuit as in others, and that no man can have\r\nacquired so much general knowledge that a farmer's exigencies will not\r\nafford scope and use for it all. I abandoned the farm, because I fancied\r\nthat I had already perceived, if I had not as yet clearly comprehended,\r\nall there was in the farmer's calling; whereas, I had not really learned\r\nmuch more of it than a good plow-horse ought to understand. And, though\r\ngreat progress has been made since then, there are still thousands of\r\nboys, in this enlightened age and conceited generation, who have\r\nscarcely a more adequate and just conception of agriculture than I then\r\nhad. If I could hope to reach even one in every hundred of this class,\r\nand induce him to ponder, impartially, the contents of this slight\r\nvolume, I know that I shall not have written it in vain.\r\n\r\nWe need to mingle more thought with our work. Some think till their\r\nheads ache intensely; others work till their backs are crooked to the\r\nsemblance of half an iron hoop; but the workers and the thinkers are apt\r\nto be distinct classes; whereas, they should be the same. Admit that it\r\nhas always been thus, it by no means follows that it always should or\r\nshall be. In an age when every laborer's son may be fairly educated if\r\nhe will, there should be more fruit gathered from the tree of knowledge\r\nto justify the magnificent promise of its foliage and its bloom. I\r\nrejoice in the belief that the graduates of our common schools are\r\nbetter ditch-diggers, when they can no otherwise employ themselves to\r\nbetter advantage, than though they knew not how to read; but that is not\r\nenough. If the untaught peasantry of Russia or Hungary grow more wheat\r\nper acre than the comparatively educated farmers of the United States,\r\nour education is found wanting. That is a vicious and defective if not\r\nradically false mental training which leaves its subject no better\r\nqualified for any useful calling than though he were unlettered. But I\r\nforbear to pursue this ever-fruitful theme.\r\n\r\nI look back, on this day completing my sixtieth year, over a life, which\r\nmust now be near its close, of constant effort to achieve ends whereof\r\nmany seem in the long retrospect to have been transitory and\r\nunimportant, however they may have loomed upon my vision when in their\r\nimmediate presence. One achievement only of our age and country--the\r\nbanishment of human chattelhood from our soil--seems now to have been\r\nworth all the requisite efforts, the agony and bloody sweat, through\r\nwhich it was accomplished. But another reform, not so palpably demanded\r\nby justice and humanity, yet equally conducive to the well-being of our\r\nrace, presses hard on its heels, and insists that we shall accord it\r\ninstant and earnest consideration. It is the elevation of Labor from the\r\nplane of drudgery and servility to one of self-respect, self-guidance,\r\nand genuine independence, so as to render the human worker no mere cog\r\nin a vast, revolving wheel, whose motion he can neither modify nor\r\narrest, but a partner in the enterprise which his toil is freely\r\ncontributed to promote, a sharer in the outlay, the risk, the loss and\r\ngain, which it involves. This end can be attained through the training\r\nof the generation who are to succeed us to observe and reflect, to live\r\nfor other and higher ends than those of present sensual gratification,\r\nand to feel that no achievement is beyond the reach of their wisely\r\ncombined and ably self-directed efforts. To that part of the generation\r\nof farmers just coming upon the stage of responsible action, who have\r\nintelligently resolved that the future of American agriculture shall\r\nevince decided and continuous improvement on its past, this little book\r\nis respectfully commended.\r\n\r\n  H. G.\r\n\r\n  _New York, Feb. 3, 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT I KNOW OF FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWILL FARMING PAY?\r\n\r\n\r\nI commence my essays with this question, because, when I urge the\r\nsuperior advantages of a rural life, I am often met by the objection\r\nthat _Farming doesn't pay_. That, if true, is a serious matter. Let us\r\nconsider:\r\n\r\nI do not understand it to be urged that the farmer who owns a large,\r\nfertile estate, well-fenced, well-stocked, with good store of effective\r\nimplements, cannot live and thrive by farming. What is meant is, that he\r\nwho has little but two brown hands to depend upon cannot make money, or\r\ncan make very little, by farming.\r\n\r\nI think those who urge this point have a very inadequate conception of\r\nthe difficulty encountered by every poor young man in securing a good\r\nstart in life, no matter in what pursuit. I came to New-York when not\r\nquite of age, with a good constitution, a fair common-school education,\r\ngood health, good habits, and a pretty fair trade--(that of printer.) I\r\nthink my outfit for a campaign against adverse fortune was decidedly\r\nbetter than the average; yet ten long years elapsed before it was\r\nsettled that I could remain here and make any decided headway. Meantime,\r\nI drank no liquors, used no tobacco, attended no balls or other\r\nexpensive entertainments, worked hard and long whenever I could find\r\nwork to do, lost less than a month altogether by sickness, and did very\r\nlittle in the way of helping others. I judge that quite as many did\r\nworse than I as did better; and that, of the young lawyers and doctors\r\nwho try to establish themselves here in their professions, quite as many\r\nearn less as earn more than their bare board during the first ten years\r\nof their struggle.\r\n\r\nJohn Jacob Astor, near the close of a long, diligent, prosperous career,\r\nwherein he amassed a large fortune, is said to have remarked that, if he\r\nwere to begin life again, and had to choose between making his first\r\nthousand dollars with nothing to start on, or with that thousand making\r\nall that he had actually accumulated, he would deem the latter the\r\neasier task. Depend upon it, young men, it is and must be hard work to\r\nearn honestly your first thousand dollars. The burglar, the forger, the\r\nblackleg (whether he play with cards, with dice, or with stocks), may\r\nseem to have a quick and easy way of making a thousand dollars; but\r\nwhoever makes that sum honestly, with nothing but his own capacities and\r\nenergies as capital, does a very good five-years' work, and may deem\r\nhimself fortunate if he finishes it so soon.\r\n\r\nI _have_ known men do better, even at farming. I recollect one who, with\r\nno capital but a good wife and four or five hundred dollars, bought\r\n(near Boston) a farm of two hundred mainly rough acres, for $2,500, and\r\npaid for it out of its products within the next five years, during which\r\nhe had nearly doubled its value. I lost sight of him then; but I have\r\nnot a doubt that, if he lived fifteen years longer and had no very bad\r\nluck, he was worth, as the net result of twenty years' effort, at least\r\n$100,000. But this man would rise at four o'clock of a winter morning,\r\nharness his span of horses and hitch them to his large market-wagon\r\n(loaded over night), drive ten miles into Boston, unload and load back\r\nagain, be home at fair breakfast-time, and, hastily swallowing his meal,\r\nbe fresh as a daisy for his day's work, in which he would lead his hired\r\nmen, keeping them clear of the least danger of falling asleep. Such men\r\nare rare, but they still exist, proving scarcely anything impossible to\r\nan indomitable will. I would not advise any to work so unmercifully; I\r\nseek only to enforce the truth that great achievements are within the\r\nreach of whoever will pay their price.\r\n\r\nAn energetic farmer bought, some twenty-five years ago, a large grazing\r\nfarm in Northern Vermont, consisting of some 150 acres, and costing him\r\nabout $3,000. He had a small stock of cattle, which was all his land\r\nwould carry; but he resolved to increase that stock by at least ten per\r\ncent. per annum, and to so improve his land by cultivation, fertilizing,\r\nclover, &c., that it would amply carry that increase. Fifteen years\r\nlater, he sold out farm and stock for $45,000, and migrated to the West.\r\nI did not understand that he was a specially hard worker, but only a\r\ngood manager, who kept his eyes wide open, let nothing go to waste, and\r\nsteadily devoted his energies and means to the improvement of his stock\r\nand his farm.\r\n\r\nWalking one day over the farm of the late Prof. Mapes, he showed me a\r\nfield of rather less than ten acres, and said, \"I bought that field for\r\n$2,400, a year ago last September. There was then a light crop of corn\r\non it, which the seller reserved and took away. I underdrained the field\r\nthat Fall, plowed and sub-soiled it, fertilized it liberally, and\r\nplanted it with cabbage; and, when these matured, I sold them for enough\r\nto pay for land, labor, and fertilizers, altogether.\" The field was now\r\nworth far more than when he bought it, and he had cleared it within\r\nfifteen months from the date of its purchase. I consider that a good\r\noperation. Another year, the crop might have been poor, or might have\r\nsold much lower, so as hardly to pay for the labor; but there are risks\r\nin other pursuits as well as in farming.\r\n\r\nA fruit-farmer, on the Hudson above Newburg, showed me, three years\r\nsince, a field of eight or ten acres which he had nicely set with\r\nGrapes, in rows ten feet apart, with beds of Strawberries between the\r\nrows, from which he assured me that his sales per acre exceeded $700 per\r\nannum. I presume his outlay for labor, including picking, was less than\r\n$300 per annum; but it had cost something, to make this field what it\r\nthen was. Say that he had spent $1,000 per acre in underdraining,\r\nenriching and tilling this field, to bring it to this condition,\r\nincluding the cost of his plants, and still there must have been a clear\r\nprofit here of at least $300 per acre.\r\n\r\nI might multiply illustrations; but let the foregoing suffice. I readily\r\nadmit that shiftless farming doesn't pay--that poor crops don't pay--that\r\nit is hard work to make money by farming without some capital--that\r\nfrost, or hail, or drouth, or floods, or insects, may blast the farmer's\r\nhopes, after he has done his best to deserve and achieve success; but I\r\ninsist that, as a general proposition, GOOD _Farming_ DOES _pay_--that\r\nfew pursuits afford as good a prospect, as full an assurance, of reward\r\nfor intelligent, energetic, persistent effort, as this does.\r\n\r\nI am not arguing that every man should be a farmer. Other vocations are\r\nuseful and necessary, and many pursue them with advantage to themselves\r\nand to others. But those pursuits are apt to be modified by time, and\r\nsome of them may yet be entirely dispensed with, which Farming never can\r\nbe. It is the first and most essential of human pursuits; it is every\r\none's interest that this calling should be honored and prosperous. If\r\nnot adequately recompensed, I judge that is because it is not wisely and\r\nenergetically followed. My aim is to show how it may be pursued with\r\nsatisfaction and profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nGOOD AND BAD HUSBANDRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessity is the master of us all. A farmer may be as strenuous for deep\r\nplowing as I am--may firmly believe that the soil should be thoroughly\r\nbroken up and pulverized to a depth of fifteen to thirty inches,\r\naccording to the crop; but, if all the team he can muster is a yoke of\r\nthin, light steers, or a span of old, spavined horses, which have not\r\neven a speaking acquaintance with grain, what shall he do? So he may\r\nheartily wish he had a thousand loads of barn-yard manure, and know how\r\nto make a good use of every ounce of it; but, if he has it not, and is\r\nnot able to buy it, he can't always afford to forbear sowing and\r\nplanting, and so, because he cannot secure great crops, do without any\r\ncrops at all. If he does the best he can, what better _can_ he do?\r\n\r\nAgain: Many farmers have fields that must await the pleasure of Nature\r\nto fit them for thorough cultivation. Here is a field--sometimes a whole\r\nfarm--which, if partially divested of the primitive forest, is still\r\nthickly dotted with obstinate stumps and filled with green, tenacious\r\nroots, which could only be removed at a heavy, perhaps ruinous, cost. A\r\nrich man might order them all dug out in a month, and see his order\r\nfully obeyed; but, except to clear a spot for a garden or under very\r\npeculiar circumstances, it would not pay; and a poor man cannot afford\r\nto incur a heavy expense merely for appearance's sake, or to make a\r\ntheatrical display of energy. In the great majority of cases, he who\r\nfarms for a living can't afford to pull green stumps, but must put his\r\nnewly-cleared land into grass at the earliest day, mow the smoother,\r\npasture the rougher portions of it, and wait for rain and drouth, heat\r\nand frost, to rot his stumps until they can easily be pulled or burned\r\nout as they stand.\r\n\r\nSo with regard to a process I detest, known as Pasturing. I do firmly\r\nbelieve that the time is at hand when nearly all the food of cattle\r\nwill, in our Eastern and Middle States, be cut and fed to them--that we\r\ncan't afford much longer, even if we can at present, to let than roam at\r\nwill over hill and dale, through meadow and forest, biting off the\r\nbetter plants and letting the worse go to seed; often poaching up the\r\nsoft, wet soil, especially in Spring, so that their hoofs destroy as\r\nmuch as they eat; nipping and often killing in their infancy the finest\r\ntrees, such as the Sugar Maple, and leaving only such as Hemlock, Red\r\nOak, Beech, &c., to attain maturity. Our race generally emerged from\r\nsavageism and squalor into industry, comfort and thrift, through the\r\nPastoral condition--the herding, taming, rearing and training of\r\nanimals being that department of husbandry to which barbarians are most\r\neasily attracted: hence, we cling to Pasturing long after the reason for\r\nit has vanished. The radical, incurable vice of Pasturing--that of\r\ndevouring the better plants and leaving the worse to ripen and diffuse\r\nseed--can never be wholly obviated; and I deem it safe to estimate that\r\nalmost any farm will carry twice as much stock if their food be mainly\r\ncut and fed to them as it will if they are required to pick it up where\r\nand as it grows or grew. I am sure that the general adoption of Soiling\r\ninstead of Pasturing will add immensely to the annual product, to the\r\nwealth, and to the population, of our older States. And yet, I know\r\nright well that many farms are now so rough and otherwise so unsuited to\r\nSoiling as to preclude its adoption thereon for many years to come.\r\n\r\nLet me indicate what I mean by Good Farming, through an illustration\r\ndrawn from the Great West:\r\n\r\nAll over the settled portions of the Valley of the Upper Mississippi and\r\nthe Missouri, there are large and small herds of cattle that are\r\nprovided with little or no shelter. The lee of a fence or stack, the\r\npartial protection of a young and leafless wood, they may chance to\r\nenjoy; but that it is a ruinous waste to leave than a prey to biting\r\nfrosts and piercing north-westers, their owners seem not to comprehend.\r\nMany farmers far above want will this Winter feed out fields of Corn and\r\nstacks of Hay to herds of cattle that will not be one pound heavier on\r\nthe 1st of next May than they were on the 1st of last December--who\r\nwill have required that fodder merely to preserve their vitality and\r\nescape freezing to death. It has mainly been employed as fuel rather\r\nthan as nourishment, and has served, not to put on flesh, but to keep\r\nout frost.\r\n\r\nNow I am familiar with the excuses for this waste; but they do not\r\nsatisfy me. The poorest pioneer might have built for his one cow a rude\r\nshelter of stakes, and poles, and straw or prairie-grass, if he had\r\nrealized its importance, simply in the light of economy. He who has many\r\ncattle is rarely without both straw and timber, and might shelter his\r\nstock abundantly if he only would. Nay, he could not have neglected or\r\nomitted it if he had clearly understood that his beasts must somehow be\r\nsupplied with heat, and that he can far cheaper warm them from without\r\nthan from within.\r\n\r\nThe broad, general, unquestionable truths, on which I insist in behalf\r\nof Good Farming are these; and I do not admit that they are subject to\r\nexception:\r\n\r\nI. It is very rarely impracticable to grow good crops, if you are\r\nwilling to work for them. If your land is too poor to grow Wheat or\r\nCorn, and you are not yet able to enrich it, sow Rye or Buckwheat; if\r\nyou cannot coax it to grow a good crop of anything, let it alone; and,\r\nif you cannot run away from it, work out by the day or month for your\r\nmore fortunate neighbors. The time and means squandered in trying to\r\ngrow crops, where only half or quarter crops can be made, constitute\r\nthe heaviest item on the wrong side of our farmers' balance-sheets;\r\ntaxing them more than their National, State, and local governments\r\ntogether do.\r\n\r\nII. Good crops rarely fail to yield a profit to the grower. I know there\r\nare exceptions, but they are very few. Keep your eye on the farmer who\r\nalmost uniformly has great Grass, good Wheat, heavy Corn, &c., and,\r\nunless he drinks, or has some other bad habit, you will find him growing\r\nrich. I am confident that white blackbirds are nearly as abundant as\r\nfarmers who have become poor while usually growing good crops.\r\n\r\nIII. The fairest single test of good farming is the increasing\r\nproductiveness of the soil. That farm which averaged twenty bushels of\r\ngrain to the acre twenty years ago, twenty-five bushels ten years ago,\r\nand will measure up thirty bushels to the acre from this year's crop,\r\nhas been and is in good hands. I know no other touchstone of Farming so\r\nunerring as that of the increase or decrease from year to year of its\r\naggregate product. If you would convince me that X. is a good farmer, do\r\nnot tell me of some great crop he has just grown, but show me that his\r\ncrop has regularly increased from year to year, and I am satisfied.\r\n\r\n--I shall have more to say on these points as I proceed. It suffices for\r\nthe present if I have clearly indicated what I mean by Good and what by\r\nBad Farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWHERE TO FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my father was over sixty years old, and had lived some twenty years\r\nin Erie County, Pennsylvania, he said to me: \"I have several times\r\nremoved, and always toward the West; I shall never remove again; but,\r\nwere I to do so, it would be toward the East. Experience has taught me\r\nthat the advantages of every section are counterbalanced by\r\ndisadvantages, and that, where any crop is easily produced, there it\r\nsells low, and sometimes cannot be sold at all. I shall live and die\r\nright here; but, were I to remove again, it would not be toward the\r\nWest.\"\r\n\r\nThis is but one side of a truth, and I give it for whatever it may be\r\nworth. Had my father plunged into the primitive forest in his\r\ntwenty-fifth rather than his forty-fifth year, he would doubtless have\r\nbecome more reconciled to pioneer life than he ever did. I would advise\r\nno one over forty years of age to undertake, with scanty means, to dig a\r\nfarm out of the dense forest, where great trees must be cut down and cut\r\nup, rolled into log-heaps, and hurried to ashes where they grew. Where\r\nhalf the timber can be sold for enough to pay the cost of cutting, the\r\ncase is different; but I know right well that digging a farm out of the\r\nhigh woods is, to any but a man of wealth, a slow, hard task. Making one\r\nout of naked prairie, five to ten miles from timber, is less difficult,\r\nbut not much. He who can locate where he has good timber on one side and\r\nrich prairie on the other is fortunate, and may hope, if his health be\r\nspared, to surround himself with every needed comfort within ten years.\r\nStill, the pioneer's life is a rugged one, especially for women and\r\nchildren; and I should advise any man who is worth $2,000 and has a\r\nfamily, to buy out an \"improvement\" (which, in most cases, badly needs\r\nimproving) on the outskirt of civilization, rather than plunge into the\r\npathless forest or push out upon the unbroken prairie. I rejoice that\r\nour Public Lands are free to actual settlers; I believe that many are\r\nthereby enabled to make for themselves homes who otherwise would have\r\nnothing to leave their children; yet I much prefer a home within the\r\nboundaries of civilization to one clearly beyond them. There is a class\r\nof drinking, hunting, frolicking, rarely working, frontiersmen, who seem\r\nto have been created on purpose to erect log cabins and break paths in\r\nadvance of a different class of settlers, who regularly come in to buy\r\nthem out and start them along after a few years. I should here prefer to\r\nfollow rather than lead. If Co-operation shall ever be successfully\r\napplied to the improvement of wild lands, I trust it may be otherwise.\r\n\r\nHe who has a farm already, and is content with it, has no reason to ask,\r\n\"Whither shall I go?\" and he may rest assured that thoroughly good\r\nfarming will pay as well in New England as in Kansas or in Minnesota. I\r\nadvise no man who has a good farm anywhere, and is able to keep it, to\r\nsell and migrate. I know men who make money by growing food within\r\ntwenty miles of this city quite as fast as they could in the West. If\r\nyou have money to buy and work it, and know how to make the most of it,\r\nI believe you may find land really as cheap, all things considered, in\r\nVermont as in Wisconsin or Arkansas.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I believe in migration--believe that there are thousands in the\r\nEastern and the Middle States who would improve their circumstances and\r\nprospects by migrating to the cheaper lands and broader opportunities of\r\nthe West and South. For, in the first place, most men are by migration\r\nrendered more energetic and aspiring; thrown among strangers, they feel\r\nthe necessity of exertion as they never felt it before. Needing almost\r\neverything, and obliged to rely wholly on themselves, they work in their\r\nnew homes as they never did in their old; and the consequences are soon\r\nvisible all around them.\r\n\r\n\"A stern chase is a long chase,\" say the sailors; and he who buys a farm\r\nmainly on credit, intending to pay for it out of its proceeds, finds\r\ninterest, taxes, sickness, bad seasons, hail, frost, drouth, tornadoes,\r\nfloods, &c., &c., deranging his calculations and impeding his progress,\r\nuntil he is often impelled to give up in despair. There are men who can\r\nsurmount every obstacle and defy discouragement--these need no advice;\r\nbut there are thousands who, having little means and large families, can\r\ngrow into a good farm more easily and far more surely than they can pay\r\nfor it; and these may wisely seek homes where population is yet sparse\r\nand land is consequently cheap. Doubtless, some migrate who might better\r\nhave forborne; yet the instinct which draws our race toward sunset is\r\nnevertheless a true one. The East will not be depopulated; but the West\r\nwill grow more rapidly in the course of the next twenty years than ever\r\nin the past. The Railroads which have brought Kansas and Minnesota\r\nwithin three days, and California within a week of us, have rendered\r\nthis inevitable.\r\n\r\nBut the South also invites immigration as she never did till now. Her\r\nlands are still very cheap; she is better timbered, in the average, than\r\nthe West; her climate attracts; her unopened mines and unused\r\nwater-power call loudly for enterprise, labor and skill. It is absurd to\r\ninsist that her soil is exhausted when not one-third of it has ever yet\r\nbeen plowed. I do not advise solitary migration to the South, because\r\nshe needs schools, mills, roads, bridges, churches, &c., &c., which the\r\nsolitary immigrant can neither provide nor well do without: and I have\r\nno assurance that he, if obliged to work out for present bread, would\r\nfind those ready to employ and willing to pay him; but let a hundred\r\nNorthern farmers and mechanics worth $1,000 to $3,000 each combine to\r\nselect (through chosen agents) and buy ten or twenty thousand acres in\r\nsome Southern State, embracing hill and vale, timber and tillage,\r\nwater-power and minerals, and divide it equitably among themselves,\r\nafter laying it out with roads, a park, a village-plat, sites for\r\nchurches, schools, &c., and I am confident that they can thus make\r\npleasant homes more cheaply and speedily there than almost anywhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nGood farming land, improved or unimproved, is this day cheaper in the\r\nUnited States, all things considered, than in any other country--cheaper\r\nthan it can long remain. So many are intent on short cuts to riches that\r\nthe soil is generally neglected, and may be bought amazingly cheap in\r\nparts of Connecticut as well as in Iowa or Nebraska. When I was last in\r\nIllinois, I rode for some hours beside a gray-coated farmer of some\r\nsixty years, who told me this: \"I came here thirty years ago, and took\r\nup, at $1-1/4 per acre, a good tract of land, mainly in timber. I am now\r\nselling off the timber at $100 per acre, reserving the land.\" That seems\r\nto me a good operation--not so quick as a corner in the stock-market,\r\nbut far safer. And, while I would advise no man to incur debt, I say\r\nmost earnestly to all who have means, \"Look out the place where you\r\nwould prefer to live and die; take time to suit yourself thoroughly;\r\nchoose it with reference to your means, your calling, your expectations,\r\nand, if you can pay for it, _buy_ it. Do not imagine that land is cheap\r\nin the West or the South only; it is to be found cheap in _every_ State\r\nby those who are able to own and who know how to use it.\"\r\n\r\nI earnestly trust that the obvious advantages of settling in colonies\r\nare to be widely and rapidly improved by our people, nearly as follows:\r\nOne thousand heads of families unite to form a colony, contribute $100\r\nto $500 each to defray the cost of seeking out and securing a suitable\r\nlocation, and send out two or three of the most capable and trustworthy\r\nof their number to find and purchase it; and now let their lands be\r\nsurveyed and divided into village or city lots at or near the center,\r\nlarger allotments (for mechanics' and merchants' homes) surrounding that\r\ncenter, and far larger (for farms) outside of these; and let each\r\nmember, on or soon after his arrival, select a village-lot, out-lot,\r\nfarm, or one of each if he chooses and can pay for them. Let ample\r\nreservations of the best sites for churches, school-houses, a town hall,\r\npublic park, etc., be made in laying out the village, and let each\r\npurchaser of a lot or farm be required to plant shade-trees along the\r\nhighways which skirt or traverse it. If irrigation by common effort be\r\ndeemed necessary, let provision be made for that. Run up a large, roomy\r\nstructure for a family hotel or boarding-house; and now invite each\r\nstockholder to come on, select his land, pay for it, and get up some\r\nsort of a dwelling, leaving his family to follow when this shall have\r\nbeen rendered habitable; but, if they insist on coming on with him and\r\ntaking their chances, so be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nPREPARING TO FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI write mainly for beginners--for young persons, and some not so young,\r\nwho are looking to farming as the vocation to which their future years\r\nare to be given, by which their living is to be gained. In this chapter,\r\nI would counsel young men, who, not having been reared in personal\r\ncontact with the daily and yearly round of a farmer's cares and duties,\r\npurpose henceforth to live by farming.\r\n\r\nTo these I would earnestly say, \"No haste!\" Our boys are in too great a\r\nhurry to be men. They want to be bosses before they have qualified\r\nthemselves to be efficient journeymen. I have personally known several\r\ninstances of young men, fresh from school or from some city vocation,\r\nbuying or hiring a farm and undertaking to work it; and I cannot now\r\nrecall a single instance in which the attempt has succeeded; while\r\nspeedy failure has been the usual result. The assumption that farming is\r\na rude, simple matter, requiring little intellect and less experience,\r\nhas buried many a well-meaning youth under debts which the best efforts\r\nof many subsequent years will barely enable him to pay off. In my\r\nopinion, half our farmers now living would say, if questioned, that they\r\nmight better have waited longer before buying or hiring a farm.\r\n\r\nWhen I was ten years old, my father took a job of clearing off the\r\nmainly fallen and partially rotten timber--largely White Pine and Black\r\nAsh--from fifty acres of level and then swampy land; and he and his two\r\nboys gave most of the two ensuing years (1821-2) to the rugged task.\r\nWhen it was finished, I--a boy of twelve years--could have taken just\r\nsuch a tract of half-burned primitive forest as that was when we took\r\nhold of it, and cleared it by an expenditure of seventy to eighty per\r\ncent. of the labor we actually bestowed upon that. I had learned, in\r\nclearing this, how to economize labor in any future undertaking of the\r\nkind; and so every one learns by experience who steadily observes and\r\nreflects. He must have been a very good farmer at the start, or a very\r\npoor one afterward, who cannot grow a thousand bushels of grain much\r\ncheaper at thirty years of age than he could at twenty.\r\n\r\nTo every young man who has had no farming experience, or very little,\r\nyet who means to make farming his vocation, I say, Hire out, for the\r\ncoming year, to the very best farmer who will give you anything like the\r\nvalue of your labor. Buy a very few choice books, (if you have them not\r\nalready,) which treat of Geology, Chemistry, Botany, and the application\r\nof their truths in Practical Agriculture; give to these the close and\r\nthoughtful attention of your few leisure hours; keep your eyes wide\r\nopen, and set down in a note-book or pocket-diary each night a minute of\r\nwhatever has been done on the farm that day, making a note of each\r\nstorm, shower, frost, hail, etc., and also of the date at which each\r\nplanted crop requires tillage or is ripe enough to harvest, and\r\nascertaining, so far as possible, what each crop produced on the farm\r\nhas cost, and which of them all are produced at a profit and which at a\r\nloss. At the year's end, hire again to the same or another good farmer\r\nand pursue the same course; and so do till you shall be twenty-four or\r\ntwenty-five years of age, which is young enough to marry, and quite\r\nyoung enough to undertake the management of a farm. By this time, if you\r\nhave carefully saved and wisely invested your earnings, you will have\r\nseveral hundred dollars; and, if you do not choose to migrate to some\r\nregion where land is very cheap, you will have found some one willing to\r\nsell you a small farm on credit, taking a long mortgage as security.\r\nYour money--assuming that you have only what you will have earned--will\r\nall be wanted to fix up your building, buy a team and cow, with the few\r\nimplements needed, and supply you with provisions till you can grow\r\nsome. If you can start thus experienced and full-handed, you may, by\r\ndiligence, combined with good fortune, begin to make payments on your\r\nmortgage at the close of your second year.\r\n\r\nI hate debt as profoundly as any one can, but I do not consider this\r\nreally running into debt. One has more land than he needs, and does not\r\nneed his pay for it forthwith; another wants land, but lacks the means\r\nof present payment. They two enter into an agreement mutually\r\nadvantageous, whereby the poorer has the present use and ultimate\r\nfee-simple of the farm in question, in consideration of the payment of\r\ncertain sums as duly stipulated. Technically, the buyer becomes a\r\ndebtor; practically, I do not regard him as such, until payments fall\r\ndue which he is unable promptly to meet. Let him rigorously avoid all\r\nother debt, and he need not shrink from nor be ashamed of this.\r\n\r\nI have a high regard for scientific attainments; I wish every young man\r\nwere thoroughly instructed in the sciences which underlie the art of\r\nfarming. But all the learning on earth, though it may powerfully help to\r\nmake a good farmer, would not of itself make one. When a young man has\r\nlearned all that seminaries and lectures, books and cabinets, can teach\r\nhim, he still needs practice and experience to make him a good farmer.\r\n\r\n--\"But wouldn't you have a young man study in order that he may become a\r\ngood farmer?\"\r\n\r\n--If he has money, Yes. I believe a youth worth four or five thousand\r\ndollars may wisely spend a tenth of his means in attending lectures, and\r\neven courses of study, at any good seminary where Natural Science is\r\ntaught and applied to Agriculture. But life is short at best; and he who\r\nhas no means, or very little, cannot really afford to attend even an\r\nAgricultural College. He can acquire so much of Science as is\r\nindispensable in the cheaper way I have indicated. He cannot wisely\r\nconsent to spend the best years of his life in getting ready to live.\r\n\r\nHe who has already mastered the art of farming, and has adequate means,\r\nmay of course buy a farm to-morrow, though he be barely or not quite of\r\nage. He has little to learn from me. Yet I think even such have often\r\nconcluded, in after years, that they were too hasty in buying land--that\r\nthey might profitably have waited, and deliberated, and garnered the\r\ntreasures of experience, before they took the grave step of buying their\r\nfuture home; with regard to which I shall make some suggestions in my\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\nBut I protest against a young man's declining or postponing the purchase\r\nof a farm merely because he is not able to buy a great one. Twenty acres\r\nof arable soil near a city or manufacturing village, forty acres in a\r\nrural district of any old State, or eighty acres in a region just\r\nbeginning to be peopled by White men, is an ample area for any one who\r\nis worth less than $2,000. If he understands his business, he will find\r\nprofitable employment hereon for every working hour: if he does not\r\nunderstand farming, he will buy his experience dear enough on this, yet\r\nmore cheaply than he would on a wider area. Until he shall have more\r\nmoney than he needs, let him beware of buying more land than he\r\nabsolutely wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nBUYING A FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one need be told at this day that good land is cheaper than\r\npoor--that the former may be bought at less cost than it can be made.\r\nYet this, like most truths, may be given undue emphasis. It should be\r\nconsidered in the light of the less obvious truth that _Every farmer may\r\nmake advantageous use of_ SOME _poor land_. The smallest farm\r\nshould have its strip or belt of forest; the larger should have an\r\nabundance and variety of trees; and sterile, stony land grows many if\r\nnot most trees thriftily: Even at the risk of arousing Western\r\nprejudice, I maintain that New-England, and all broken, hilly, rocky\r\ncountries, have a decided advantage (abundantly counterbalanced, no\r\ndoubt) over regions of great fertility and nearly uniform facility, in\r\nthat human stupidity and mole-eyed greed can never wholly divest them of\r\nforests--that their sterile crags and steep acclivities must mainly be\r\nleft to wood forever. Avarice may strip them of their covering of\r\nto-day; but, defying the plow and the spade, they cannot be so denuded\r\nthat they will not be speedily reclothed with trees and foliage.\r\n\r\nI am not a believer that \"Five Acres\" or \"Ten Acres\" suffice for a farm.\r\nI know where money is made on even fewer than five acres; but they who\r\ndo it are few, and men of exceptional capacity and diligence. Their\r\nachievements are necessarily confined to the vicinage of cities or\r\nmanufacturing villages. The great majority of all who live by\r\nAgriculture want room to turn upon--want to grow grass and keep\r\nstock--and, for such, no mere garden or potato-patch will answer. They\r\nwant genuine farms.\r\n\r\nYet, go where you may in this country, you will hear a farmer saying of\r\nhis neighbor, \"He has too much land,\" even where the criticism might\r\njustly be reciprocated. We cannot all be mistaken on this head.\r\n\r\nThere are men who can each manage thousands of acres of tillage, just as\r\nthere are those who can skillfully wield an army of a hundred thousand\r\nmen. Napoleon said there were two of this class in the Europe of his\r\nday. There are others who cannot handle a hundred acres so that nothing\r\nis lost through neglect or oversight. Rules must be adapted to average\r\ncapacities and circumstances. He who expects to live by cattle-rearing\r\nneeds many more acres than he who is intent on grain-growing; while he\r\nwho contemplates vegetable, root, and fruit culture, needs fewer acres\r\nstill. As to the direction of his efforts, each one will be a law unto\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked, by a young man intent on farming, to indicate the\r\nproper area for him, I would say, _Buy just so large a farm as half\r\nyour means will pay for_. In other words, \"If you are worth $20,000,\r\ninvest half of it in land, the residue in stock, tools, etc.; and\r\nobserve the same rule of proportion, whether you be worth $1,000,000 or\r\nonly $1,000. If you are worth just nothing at all, I would invest in\r\nland the half of that, and no more. In other words, I would either wait\r\nto earn $500 or over, or push Westward till I found land that costs\r\npractically nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then, I take to be the gist of the popular criticism on our\r\nfarmers as having unduly enlarged their borders: _They have more land\r\nthan they have capital to stock and till to the best advantage._ He who\r\nhas but fifty acre has too much if he lets part of his land lie idle and\r\nunproductive for lack of team or hands to till it efficiently; while he\r\nwho has a thousand acres has none too much if he has the means and\r\ntalents wherewith to make the best of it all.\r\n\r\nI have said that I consider the soil of New England as cheap, all things\r\nconsidered, for him who is able to buy and work it, as that of Minnesota\r\nor Arkansas--that I urge migration to the West only upon those who\r\ncannot pay for farms in the old States. I doubt whether the farmers of\r\nany other section have, in the average, done better, throughout the last\r\nten years, than the butter-makers of Vermont, the cheese-dairymen of\r\nthis State. And yet there is, in the ridgy, rocky, _patchy_ character of\r\nmost of our Eastern farms, an insuperable barrier to the most economic,\r\neffective cultivation. If the ridges were further apart--if each rocky\r\nor gravelly knoll were not in close proximity to a strip of bog or\r\nmorass--it would be different. But the genius of our age points\r\nunmistakably to cultivation by steam or some other mechanical\r\napplication of power; and this requires spacious fields, with few or no\r\nobstacles to the equable progress of the plow. I apprehend that, for\r\nthis reason, the growth of bread-corn eastward of the Hudson can never\r\nmore be considerably extended, so long as the boundless, fertile\r\nprairies can so easily pour their exhaustless supplies upon us. Fruits,\r\nVegetables, Roots and Grass, we must continue to grow, probably in\r\never-increasing abundance; but we of the East will buy our bread-corn\r\nlargely if not mainly from the West.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, who bays land in the Eastern States should regard\r\nprimarily its capacity to produce those crops in which the East can\r\nnever be supplanted--Grass, Fruits, Vegetables, Timber. If a farm will\r\nalso produce good Corn or Wheat, that is a recommendation; but let him\r\nplace a higher value on those capacities which will be more generally\r\nrequired and drawn upon.\r\n\r\nIn the West, the case is different; for, though Wheat-culture still\r\nrecedes before the footsteps of advancing population, and Minnesota may\r\nsoon cease to grow for others, as Western New-York, Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nNorthern Illinois, have already done, yet Indian Corn, being the basis\r\nof both Beef and Pork, will long hold its own in the Valley of the Ohio\r\nand in that of the Upper Mississippi. As it recedes slowly Westward,\r\nClover and Timothy, Butter and Cheese, will press closely on its\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nGood neighbors, good roads, good schools, good mechanics at hand, and a\r\ngood church within reach, will always be valued and sought: few farmers\r\nare likely to disregard them. Let whoever buys a farm whereon to live,\r\nresolve to buy once for all, and let him not forget that health is not\r\nonly wealth but happiness--that an eligible location and a beautiful\r\nprospect are elements of enjoyment not only for ourselves but our\r\nfriends; let him not fancy that all the land will soon be gobbled up and\r\nheld at exorbitant prices, but believe that money will almost always\r\ncommand money's worth of whatever may be needed, so that he need not\r\nembarrass himself to-day through fear that he may not be able to find\r\nsellers to-morrow, and he can hardly fail to buy judiciously, and thus\r\nescape that worst species of home-sickness--sickness of home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nLAYING OFF A FARM--PASTURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever finds himself the newly installed owner and occupant of a farm,\r\nshould, before doing much beyond growing a crop in the ordinary way,\r\nstudy well its character, determine its capacities, make himself well\r\nacquainted with its peculiarities of soil and surface, with intent to\r\nmake the most of it in his future operations. I would devote at least a\r\nyear to this thoughtful observation and study.\r\n\r\nTo one reared amid the rugged scenery of New-England; or on either slope\r\nof the Allegheny ridge, all prairie farms look alike, just as a European\r\nsupposes this to be the case with all negroes. A better acquaintance\r\nwill show the average prairie quarter-section by no means an unbroken\r\nmeadow, \"level as a house-floor,\" but diversified by water-courses,\r\n\"sloughs,\" and gentle acclivities--sometimes by considerable ravines and\r\n\"barrens\" or elevated \"swales,\" thinly covered with timber, or brush, or\r\nboth. But I will contemplate more especially a Northern farm, made up of\r\nhill and vale or glade, rocky ridge and skirting bog or other low land,\r\nwith a wood-lot on the rear or not far distant, and clumps or belts of\r\ntimber irregularly lining brook and ravine, or lurking in the angles and\r\nsinuosities of walls and wooden fences, and a ragged, mossy orchard\r\nsheltered in some quiet nook, or sprawling over some gravelly hill-side.\r\nA brook, nearly dry in August, gurgles down the hill-side or winds\r\nthrough the swamp; while fields, moderately sloping here and nearly\r\nlevel there, interposed as they can be, have severally been devoted, for\r\na generation or more, alternately to Grain and Grass--the latter largely\r\npreponderating. We will suppose this farm to measure from 50 to 150\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nNow, the young man who has bought or inherited this farm may be wholly\r\nand consciously unable to enter upon any expensive system of improvement\r\nfor the next ten years--may fully realize that four or five days of each\r\nweek must meantime be given to the growing or earning of present\r\nbread--yet he should none the less study well the capacities and\r\nadaptations of each acre, and mature a comprehensive plan for the\r\nultimate bringing of each field into the best and most useful condition\r\nwhereof it is susceptible, before he cuts a living tree or digs a\r\nsolitary drain. He is morally certain of doing something--perhaps many\r\nthings--that he will sadly wish undone, if he fails to study\r\npeculiarities and mature a plan before he begins to improve or to fit\r\nhis several fields for profitable cultivation.\r\n\r\nAnd the first selection to be made is that of a pasture, since I am\r\ncompelled to use an old, familiar name for what should be essentially a\r\nnew thing. This pasture should be as near the center of the farm as may\r\nbe, and convenient to the barns and barn-yard that are to be. It should\r\nhave some shade, but no very young trees; should be dry and rolling,\r\nwith an abundance of the purest living water. The smaller this\r\npasture-lot may be, the better I shall like it, provided you fence it\r\nvery stoutly, connect it with the barn-yard by a lane if they are not in\r\nclose proximity, and firmly resolve that, outside of this lot, this\r\nlane, this yard and the adjacent stable, your cattle shall never be\r\nseen, unless on the road to market. Very possibly, the day may come\r\nwherein you will decide to dispense with pasturing altogether; but that\r\nis, for the present, improbable. _One_ pasture you will have; if you\r\nlive in the broad West, and purpose to graze extensively, it will\r\ndoubtless be a large one; but permitting your stock to ramble in Spring\r\nand Fall all over your own fields--(and perhaps your neighbors'\r\nalso)--in quest of their needful food, biting off the tops of the finer\r\nyoung trees, trampling down or breaking off some that are older, rubbing\r\nthe bark off of your growing fruit-trees, and doing damage that years\r\nwill be required to repair, I most vehemently protest against.\r\n\r\nThe one great error that misleads and corrupts mankind is the\r\npresumption that _something may be had for nothing_. The average farmer\r\nimagines that whatever of flesh or of milk may accrue to him from the\r\nfood his cattle obtain by browsing over his fields or through his\r\nwoods, is so much clear gain--that they do the needful work, while he\r\npockets the net proceeds. But the universe was framed on a plan which\r\nrequires so much for so much; and this law will not submit to defiance\r\nor evasion. Under the unnatural, exceptional conditions which environ\r\nthe lone squatter on a vast prairie, something may be made by turning\r\ncattle loose and letting them shift for themselves; but this is at best\r\ntransitory, and at war with the exigencies of civilization. Whoever\r\nlives within sight of a school-house, or within hearing of a\r\nchurch-bell, is under the dominion of a law alike inexorable and\r\nbeneficent--the law that requires each to pay for all he gets, and reap\r\nonly where he has sown.\r\n\r\nYou can hardly have a pasture so small that it will not afford\r\nhospitality to weeds and prove a source of multiform infestations. The\r\nplants that should mature and be diffused will be kept down to the\r\nearth; those which should be warred upon and eradicated will flourish\r\nuntouched, ripen their seed, and diffuse it far and wide. Thistles,\r\nWhite Daisy, and every plant that impedes tillage and diminishes crops,\r\nare nourished and diffused by means of pastures.\r\n\r\nI hold, therefore, that the good farmer will run a mowing-machine over\r\nhis pasture twice each Summer--say early in June, and then late in\r\nJuly--or, if his lot be too rough for this, will have it clipped at\r\nleast once with a scythe. Cutting all manner of worthless if not noxious\r\nplants in the blossom, will benefit the soil which their seeding would\r\ntax; it will render the eradication of weeds from your tillage a far\r\neasier task; and it will prevent your being a nuisance to your\r\nneighbors. I am confident that no one who has formed the habit of\r\nkeeping down the weeds in his pasture will ever abandon it.\r\n\r\nI think each pasture should have (though mine, as yet, has not) a rude\r\nshed or other shelter whereto the cattle may resort in case of storm or\r\nother inclemency. How much they shrink as well as suffer from one cold,\r\npelting rain, few fully realize; but I am sure that \"the merciful man\"\r\nwho (as the Scripture says) \"is merciful to his beast,\" finds his\r\nhumanity a good paying investment. I doubt that the rule would fail,\r\neven in Texas; but I am contemplating civilized husbandry, not the rude\r\nconditions of tropical semi-barbarism. If only by means of stakes and\r\nstraw, give cattle a chance to keep dry and warm when they must\r\notherwise shiver through a rainy, windy day and night on the cold, wet\r\nground, and I am sure they will pay for it.\r\n\r\nIn confining a herd of cattle to such narrow limits, I do not intend\r\nthat they shall be stinted to what grows there. On the contrary, I\r\nexpect them to be fed on Winter Rye, on Cut Grass, on Sowed Corn,\r\nSorghum, Stalks, Roots, etc., etc., as each shall be in season. With a\r\ngood mower, it is a light hour's work before breakfast to cut and cart\r\nto a dozen or twenty head as much grass or corn as they will eat during\r\nthe day. But let that point stand over for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nTREES--WOODLAND--FORESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not at all sentimental--much less mawkish--regarding the\r\ndestruction of trees. Descended from several generations of\r\ntimber-cutters (for my paternal ancestors came to America in 1640), and\r\nmyself engaged for three years in land-clearing, I realize that trees\r\nexist for use rather than for ornament, and have no more scruple as to\r\ncutting timber in a forest than as to cutting grass in a meadow. Utility\r\nis the reason and end of all vegetable growth--of a hickory's no less\r\nthan a corn-stalk's. I have always considered \"Woodman, spare that\r\ntree,\" just about the most mawkish bit of badly versified prose in our\r\nlanguage, and never could guess how it should touch the sensibilities of\r\nany one. Understand, then, that I urge the planting of trees mainly\r\nbecause I believe it will _pay_, and the preservation, improvement, and\r\nextension, of forests, for precisely that reason.\r\n\r\nYet I am not insensible to the beauty and grace lent by woods, and\r\ngroves, and clumps or rows of trees, to the landscape they diversify. I\r\nfeel the force of Emerson's averment, that \"Beauty is its own excuse\r\nfor being,\" and know that a homestead embowered in, belted by, stately,\r\ngraceful elms, maples, and evergreens, is really _worth_ more, and will\r\nsell for more, than if it were naked field and meadow. I consider it one\r\npositive advantage (to balance many disadvantages) of our rocky, hilly,\r\nrugged Eastern country, that it will never, in all probability, be so\r\ndenuded of forests as the rich, facile prairies and swales of the Great\r\nValley may be. Our winds are less piercing, our tornadoes less\r\ndestructive, than those of the Great West. I doubt whether there is\r\nanother equal area of the earth's surface whereon so many kinds of\r\nvaluable trees grow spontaneously and rapidly, defying eradication, as\r\nthroughout New England and on either slope of the Alleghenies; and this\r\nprofusion of timber and foliage may well atone for, or may be fairly\r\nweighed against, many deficiencies and drawbacks. The Yankee, who has\r\nbeen accustomed to see trees spring up spontaneously wherever they were\r\nnot kept down by ax, or plow, or scythe, and to cross running water\r\nevery half mile of a Summer day's journey, may well be made homesick, by\r\ntwo thousand miles of naked, dusty, wind-swept Plains, whereon he finds\r\nno water for fifty to a hundred miles, and knows it impossible to cut an\r\nax-helve, much more an axle-tree, in the course of a wearying journey.\r\nNo Eastern farmer ever realized the blessedness of abundant and\r\nexcellent wood and water until he had wandered far from his boyhood's\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nNo one may yet be able fully to explain the inter-dependence of these\r\ntwo blessings; but the fact remains. All over \"the Plains,\" there is\r\nevidence that trees grew and flourished where none are now found, and\r\nthat springs and streams were then frequent and abiding where none now\r\nexist. A prominent citizen of Nevada, who explored southward from Austin\r\nto the Colorado, assured me that his party traveled for days in the bed\r\nof what had once been a considerable river, but in which it was evident\r\nthat no water had flowed for years. And I have heard that since the\r\nMormons have planted trees over considerable sections of Utah, rains in\r\nSummer are no longer rare, and Salt Lake evinces, by a constant though\r\nmoderate increase of her volume of waters, that the equilibrium of\r\nrain-fall with evaporation in the Great Basin has been fully\r\nrestored--or rather, that the rain-fall is now taking the lead.\r\n\r\nI have a firm faith that all the great deserts of the Temperate and\r\nTorrid Zones will yet be reclaimed by irrigation and tree-planting. The\r\nbill which Congress did not pass, nor really consider, whereby it was\r\nproposed, some years since, to give a section of the woodless Public\r\nLands remote from settlement to every one who, in a separate township,\r\nwould plant and cherish a quarter-section of choice forest-trees, ought\r\nto have been passed--with modifications, perhaps, but preserving the\r\ncentral idea. Had ten thousand quarter-sections, in so many different\r\ntownships of the Plains, been thus planted to timber ten to twenty\r\nyears ago, and protected from fire and devastation till now, the value\r\nof those Plains for settlement would have been nearly or quite doubled.\r\n\r\nA capital mistake, it seems to me, is being made by some of the dairy\r\nfarmers of our own State. One who has a hundred acres of good soil,\r\nwhereof twenty or thirty are wooded, cuts off his timber entirely,\r\ncalculating that the additional grass that he may grow in its stead will\r\npay for all the coal he needs for fuel, so that he will make a net gain\r\nof the time he has hitherto devoted each Winter to cutting and hauling\r\nwood. He does not consider how much his soil will lose in Summer\r\nmoisture, how his springs and runnels will be dried up, nor how the\r\nsweep of harsh winds will be intensified, by baring his hill-tops and\r\nravines to sun and breeze so utterly. In my deliberate judgment, a farm\r\nof one hundred acres will yield _more_ feed, with far greater uniformity\r\nof product from year to year, if twenty acres of its ridge-crests,\r\nravine-sides, and rocky places, are thickly covered with timber, than if\r\nit be swept clean of trees and all devoted to grass. Hence, I insist\r\nthat the farmer who sweeps off his wood and resolves to depend on coal\r\nfor fuel, hoping to increase permanently the product of his dairy, makes\r\na sad miscalculation.\r\n\r\nSpain, Italy, and portions of France, are now suffering from the\r\nimprovidence that devoured their forests, leaving the future to take\r\ncare of itself. I presume the great empires of antiquity suffered from\r\nthe same folly, though to a much greater extent. The remains of now\r\nextinct races who formerly peopled and tilled the central valleys of\r\nthis continent, and especially the Territory of Arizona, probably bear\r\nwitness to a similar recklessness, which is paralleled by our fathers'\r\nand our own extermination of the magnificent forests of White Pine\r\nwhich, barely a century ago, covered so large a portion of the soil of\r\nour Northern States. Vermont sold White Pine abundantly to England\r\nthrough Canada within my day: she is now supplying her own wants from\r\nCanada at a cost of not less than five times the price she sold for; and\r\nshe will be paying still higher rates before the close of this century.\r\nI entreat our farmers not to preserve every tree, good, bad, or\r\nindifferent, that may happen to be growing on their lands--but, outside\r\nof the limited districts wherein the primitive forest must still be cut\r\naway in order that land may be obtained for cultivation, to _plant and\r\nrear at least two better trees for every one they may be impelled to cut\r\ndown_. How this may, in the average, be most judiciously done, I will\r\ntry to indicate in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nGROWING TIMBER--TREE-PLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, the proportion of a small farm that should be constantly\r\ndevoted to trees (other than fruit) is not less than one-fourth; while,\r\nof farms exceeding one hundred acres in area, that proportion should be\r\nnot less than one-third, and may often be profitably increased to\r\none-half. I am thinking of such as are in good part superficially rugged\r\nand rocky, or sandy and sterile, such as New-England, eastern New-York,\r\nnorthern New-Jersey, with both slopes of the Alleghenies, as well as the\r\nwestern third of our continent, abound in. It may be that it is\r\nadvisable to be content with a smaller proportion of timber in the\r\nPrairie States and the broad, fertile intervales which embosom most of\r\nour great rivers for at least a part of their course; but I doubt it.\r\nAnd there is scarcely a farm in the whole country, outside of the great\r\nprimitive forests in which openings have but recently been made, in\r\nwhich _some_ tree-planting is not urgently required.\r\n\r\n\"Too much land,\" you will hear assigned on every side as a reason for\r\npoor farming and meager crops. Ask an average farmer in New-England, in\r\nVirginia, in Kentucky, or in Alabama, why the crops of his section are\r\nin the average no better, and the answer, three times in four, will be,\r\n\"Our farmers have too much land\"--that is, not too much absolutely, but\r\ntoo much relatively to their capital, stock, and general ability to till\r\neffectively. The habitual grower of poor crops will proffer this\r\nexplanation quite as freely and frequently as his more thrifty neighbor.\r\nAnd what every one asserts must have a basis of truth.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not mean to quarrel with the instinct which prompts my\r\ncountrymen to buy and hold too much land. They feel, as I do, that land\r\nis still cheap almost anywhere in this country--cheap, if not in view of\r\nthe income now derived from it, certainly in contemplation of the price\r\nit must soon command and the income it might, under better management,\r\nbe made to yield. Under this conviction--or, if you please,\r\nimpression--every one is intent on holding on to more land than he can\r\nprofitably till, if not more than he can promptly pay for.\r\n\r\nWhat I _do_ object to is simply this--that thousands, who have more land\r\nthan they have capital to work profitably, will persist in half-tilling\r\nmany acres, instead of thoroughly farming one-half or one third so many,\r\nand getting the rest into wood so fast as may be. I am confident that\r\ntwo-thirds of all our farmers would improve their circumstances and\r\nincrease their incomes by concentrating their efforts, their means,\r\ntheir fertilizers, upon half to two-thirds of the area they now skim and\r\nskin, and giving the residue back to timber-growing.\r\n\r\nIn my own hilly, rocky, often boggy, Westchester--probably within six of\r\nbeing the oldest Agricultural County in the Union--I am confident that\r\nten thousand acres might to-morrow be given back to forest with profit\r\nto the owners and advantage to all its inhabitants. It is a\r\nfruit-growing, milk-producing, truck-farming county, closely adjoining\r\nthe greatest city of the New World; hence, one wherein land can be\r\ncultivated as profitably as almost anywhere else--yet I am satisfied\r\nthat half its surface may be more advantageously devoted to timber than\r\nto grass or tillage. Nay; I doubt that one acre in a hundred of rocky\r\nland--that is, land ribbed or dotted with rocks that the bar or the\r\nrock-hook cannot lift from their beds, and which it will not as yet pay\r\nto blast--is now tilled to profit, or ever will be until it shall be\r\nfound advisable to clear them utterly of stone breaking through or\r\nrising within two feet of the surface. The time will doubtless arrive in\r\nwhich many fields will pay for clearing of stone that would not to-day;\r\nthese, I urge, should be given up to wood now, and kept wooded until the\r\nhour shall have struck for ridding them of every impediment to the\r\nsteady progress of both the surface and the subsoil plow.\r\n\r\nWere all the rocky crests and rugged acclivities of this County\r\nbounteously wooded once more, and kept so for a generation, our floods\r\nwould be less injurious, our springs unfailing, and our streams more\r\nconstant and equable; our blasts would be less bitter, and our gales\r\nless destructive to fruit; we should have vastly more birds to delight\r\nus by their melody and aid us in our not very successful war with\r\ndevouring insects; we should grow peaches, cherries, and other delicate\r\nfruits, which the violent caprices of our seasons, the remorseless\r\ndevastations of our visible and invisible insect enemies, have all but\r\nannihilated; and we should keep more cows and make more milk on\r\ntwo-thirds of the land now devoted to grass than we actually do from the\r\nwhole of it. And what is true of Westchester is measurably true of every\r\nrural county in the Union.\r\n\r\nI have said that I believe in cutting trees as well as in growing them;\r\nI have not said, and do not mean to say, that I believe in cutting\r\neverything clean as you go. That was once proper in Westchester; it is\r\nstill advisable in forest-covered regions, where the sun must be let in\r\nbefore crops can be grown; but, in nine cases out of ten, timber should\r\nbe thinned or culled out rather than cut off; and, for every tree taken\r\naway, at least two should be planted or set out.\r\n\r\nWe have pretty well outgrown the folly of letting every apple-tree bear\r\nsuch fruit as it will; though in the orchard of my father's little farm\r\nin Amherst, N. H., whereon I was born, no tree had ever been grafted\r\nwhen I bade adieu to it in 1820; and I presume none has been to this\r\nday. By this time, almost every farmer realizes that he _can't afford_\r\nto grow little, gnarly, villainously sour or detestably bitter-sweet\r\napples, when, by duly setting a graft at a cost of two dimes, he may\r\nmake that identical tree yield Greenings or Pippins at least as\r\nbounteously. I presume the cumulative experience of fifty or sixty\r\ngenerations of apple-growers has ripened this conclusion. Why do they\r\nnot infer readily and generally that growing indifferent timber where\r\nthe best and most valued would grow as rapidly, is a stupid, costly\r\nblunder? It seems to me that whoever has attained the conviction that\r\napple-trees should be grafted ought to know that it is wasteful to grow\r\nRed Oak, Beech, White Maple, and Alder, where White Oak, Hickory,\r\nLocust, and White Pine, might be grown with equal facility, in equal\r\nluxuriance, provided the right seeds were planted, and a little pains\r\ntaken to keep down, for a year or two, the shoots spontaneously sent up\r\nby the wrong ones.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Potomac, and east of the Ohio, and (I presume) in limited\r\ndistricts elsewhere, rocky, sterile woodlands, costing $2 to $50 per\r\nacre according to location, etc., are to-day the cheapest property to be\r\nbought in the United States. Even though nothing were done with them but\r\nkeep out fire and cattle, and let the young trees grow as they will,\r\nmoney can be more profitably and safely invested in lands covered by\r\nyoung timber than in anything else. The parent, who would invest a few\r\nthousands for the benefit of children or grandchildren still young, may\r\nbuy woodlands which will be worth twenty times their present cost within\r\nthe next twenty years. But better even than this would it be to buy up\r\nrocky, craggy, naked hill-sides and eminences which have been pastured\r\nto death, and, shutting out cattle inflexibly, scratch these over with\r\nplow, mattock, hoe, or pick, as circumstances shall dictate, plant them\r\nthickly with Chestnut, Walnut, Hickory, White Oak, and the seeds of\r\nLocust and White Pine. I say Locust, though not yet certain that this\r\ntree must not be started in garden or nursery-beds and transplanted when\r\ntwo or three years old, so puny and feeble is it at the outset, and so\r\nlikely to be smothered under leaves or killed out by its more favored\r\nneighbors. I have experiments in progress not yet matured, which may\r\nshed light on this point before I finish these essays.\r\n\r\n_Plant thickly_, and of diverse kinds, so as to cover the ground\r\npromptly and choke out weeds and shrubs, with full purpose to thin and\r\nprune as circumstances shall dictate.\r\n\r\nMany farmers are averse to planting timber, because (they think) nothing\r\ncan be realized therefrom for the next twenty or thirty years, which is\r\nas long as they expect to live. But this is a grave miscalculation. Let\r\nus suppose a rocky, hilly pasture-lot of ten or twenty acres rudely\r\nscratched over as I have suggested, and thickly seeded with hickory nuts\r\nand white oak acorns only: within five years, it will yield abundantly\r\nof hoop poles, though the better, more promising half be left to\r\nmature, as they should be; two years later, another and larger crop of\r\nhoop-poles may be cut, still sparing the best; and thenceforth a\r\nvaluable crop of timber may be taken from that land; for, if cut at the\r\nproper season, at least two thrifty sprouts will start from every stump;\r\nand so that wood will yield a clear income each year while its best\r\ntrees are steadily growing and maturing. I do not advise restriction to\r\nthose two species of timber; but I insist that a young plantation of\r\nforest-trees may and should yield a clear income in every year after its\r\nfourth.\r\n\r\nAs to the Far West--the Plains, the Parks, and the Great Basin--there is\r\nmore money to be made by dotting them with groves of choice timber than\r\nby working the richest veins of the adjacent mountains. Whoever will\r\npromptly start, near a present or prospective railroad, forty acres of\r\nchoice trees--Hickory, White Oak, Locust, Chestnut, and White\r\nPine--within a circuit of three hundred miles from Denver, on land which\r\nhe has made or is making provision to irrigate--may begin to sell trees\r\ntherefrom two years hence, and persist in selling annually henceforth\r\nfor a century--at first, for transplanting; very soon, for a variety of\r\nuses in addition to that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n--But this paper grows too long, and I must postpone to the next my more\r\nespecial suggestions to young farmers with regard to tree-planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nPLANTING AND GROWING TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever has recently bought, inherited, or otherwise become the owner of\r\na farm, has usually found some part or parts of it devoted to wood; and\r\nthis, if not in excess, he will mainly preserve, while he studies and\r\nplans with a view to the ultimate devotion to timber of just those\r\nportions of his land that are best adapted to that use. In locating that\r\ntimber, I would have him consider these suggestions:\r\n\r\nI. Land wisely planted with trees, and fenced so far as need be to keep\r\nout cattle, costs nothing. Whatever else you grow involves labor and\r\nexpenditure; trees grow of their own accord. You may neglect them\r\nutterly--may wander over the earth and be absent for ten or twenty\r\nyears, while your fences decay and your fields are overcropped to\r\nexhaustion; even your meadows may be run out by late mowing and close\r\nfeeding at both ends of the season, till a dozen acres will hardly\r\nsubsist a span of horses and a cow; but your woods need only to be let\r\nalone to insure that their value shall have decidedly increased during\r\nyour absence. They will richly reward labor and care in thinning,\r\ntrimming, and transplanting--you may profitably employ in them any time\r\nthat you can spare them--but they will do very well if simply let alone.\r\nAnd, unlike any other product with which I am acquainted, you may take\r\ncrop after crop of wood from the same lot, and the soil will be richer\r\nand more productive after the last than it was before the first. Whether\r\nwholly because their roots permeate and break up the soil during their\r\nlife and enrich it in their decay, or for diverse reasons, it is\r\ncertainly true that land--and especially _poor_ land--is enriched by\r\ngrowing upon it a crop of almost any timber, the evergreens possibly\r\nexcepted. So, should you ever have land that you cannot till to profit,\r\nwhether because it is too poor, or because you have a sufficiency that\r\nis better, you should at once devote it to wood.\r\n\r\nII. Your springs and streams will be rendered more equable and enduring\r\nby increasing the area and the luxuriance of your timber. They may have\r\nbecome scanty and capricious under a policy of reckless, wholesale\r\ndestruction of trees; they will be reenforced and reinvigorated by\r\ndoubling the area of your woods, while quadrupling the number, and\r\nincreasing the average size, of your trees.\r\n\r\nIII. All ravines and steep hill-sides should be devoted to trees. Every\r\nacre too rocky to be thoroughly cleared of stone and plowed should be\r\nset apart for tree-growing. Wherever the soil will be gullied or washed\r\naway by violent rains if under tillage, it should be excluded from\r\ncultivation and given up to trees. Men often doubt the profit of heavy\r\nmanuring; and well they may, if three-fourths of the fertilizers applied\r\nare soaked out and swept away by flooding rains or sudden thaws and\r\nfloated off to some distant sea or bay; but let all that is applied to\r\nthe soil only remain there till it is carted away in crops, and it will\r\nhardly be possible to manure too highly for profit.\r\n\r\nIV. Trees, especially evergreens, may be so disposed as to modify\r\nagreeably the average temperature of your farm, or at least of the most\r\nimportant parts of it. When I bought my place--or rather the first\r\ninstallment of it--the best spot I could select for a garden lay at the\r\nfoot of a hill which half surrounded it on the south and east, leaving\r\nit exposed to the full sweep of north and north-west winds; so that,\r\nthough the soil was gravelly and warm, my garden was likely to be cold\r\nand backward. To remedy this, I planted four rows of evergreens (Balsam\r\nFir, Pine, Red Cedar, and Hemlock), along a low ridge bounding it on the\r\nnorth, following an inward curve of the ridge at its west end; and those\r\nevergreens have in sixteen years grown into very considerable trees,\r\nforming a shady, cleanly, inviting bower, or sylvan retreat, daintily\r\ncarpeted with the fallen leaves of the overhanging firs. I judge that\r\nthe average temperature of the soil for some yards southward of this\r\nwind-break is at least five degrees higher, throughout the growing\r\nseason, than it formerly was or would now be if these evergreens were\r\nswept away; while the aspect of the place is agreeably diversified, and\r\neven beautified, by their appearance. I believe it would sell for some\r\nhundreds of dollars more with than without that thrifty, growing clump\r\nof evergreens.\r\n\r\nV. I have already urged, though not strongly enough, that crops, as well\r\nas springs, will be improved by keeping the crests of ridges thickly\r\nwooded, thus depositing moisture in Winter and Spring, to be slowly\r\nyielded to the adjacent slopes during the heat and drouth of Summer. I\r\nfirmly believe that the slopes of a hill whose crest is heavily wooded\r\nwill yield larger average crops than slope and crest together would do\r\nif both were bare of trees.\r\n\r\nVI. The banks of considerable streams, ponds, etc., may often be so\r\nplanted with trees that these will shade more water than land, to the\r\ncomfort and satisfaction of the fish, and the protection of those banks\r\nfrom abrasion by floods and rapid currents. Sycamore, Elm, and Willow,\r\ndo well here; if choice Grape-Vines are set beside and allowed to run\r\nover some of them, the effect is good, and the grapes acceptable to man\r\nand bird.\r\n\r\nVII. Never forget that a good tree grows as thriftily and surely as a\r\npoor one. Many a farmer has to-day ten to forty acres of indifferent\r\ncord-wood where he might, at a very slight cost, have had instead an\r\nequal quantity of choice timber, worth ten times as much. Hickory,\r\nChestnut, and Walnut, while they yield nuts that can be eaten or sold,\r\nare worth far more as timber than an equal bulk of Beech, Birch,\r\nHemlock, or Red Oak. Chestnut has more than doubled in value within the\r\nlast few years, mainly because it has been found excellent for the\r\ninside wood-work of dwellings. Locust also seems to be increasing in\r\nvalue. Ten acres of large, thrifty Locust near this City would now buy a\r\npretty good farm; as I presume it would, if located near any of our\r\ngreat cities.\r\n\r\nVIII. Where several good varieties of Timber are grown together, some\r\ninsect or atmospheric trouble may blast one of them, yet leave the\r\nresidue alive and hearty. And, if all continue thrifty, some may be cut\r\nout and sold, leaving others more room to grow and rapidly attain a\r\nvigorous maturity.\r\n\r\nIX. Wherever timber has become scarce and valuable, a wood-lot should be\r\nthinned out, nevermore cleared off, unless it is to be devoted to a\r\ndifferent use. It seems to me that destroying a forest because we want\r\ntimber is like smothering a hive of bees because we want honey.\r\n\r\nX. Timber should be cut with intelligent reference to the future. Locust\r\nand other valuable trees that it is desirable should throw up shoots\r\nfrom the stump, and rapidly reproduce their kind, should be cut in March\r\nor April; while trees that you want to exterminate should be cut in\r\nAugust, so that they may _not_ sprout. There may be exceptions to this\r\nrule; but I do not happen to recollect any. Evergreens do not sprout;\r\nand I think these should be cut in Winter--at all events, not in Spring,\r\nwhen full of sap and thus prone to rapid decay.\r\n\r\nXI. Your plantation will furnish pleasant and profitable employment at\r\nalmost any season. I doubt that any one in this country has ever yet\r\nbestowed so much labor and care on a young forest as it will amply\r\nreward. Sow your seeds thickly; begin to thin the young trees when they\r\nare a foot high, and to trim them so soon as they are three feet, and\r\nyou may have thousands thriving on a fertile acre, and pushing their\r\ngrowth upward with a rapidity and to an altitude outrunning all\r\npreconception.\r\n\r\nXII. Springs and streams will soon appear where none have appeared and\r\nendured for generations, when we shall have reclothed the nakedness of\r\nthe Plains with adequate forests. Rains will become moderately frequent\r\nwhere they are now rare, and confined to the season when they are of\r\nleast use to the husbandman.\r\n\r\nI may have more to say of trees by-and-by, but rest here for the\r\npresent. The importance of the topic can hardly be overrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nDRAINING--MY OWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy farm is in the township of Newcastle, Westchester County, N. Y., 35\r\nmiles from our City Hall, and a little eastward of the hamlet known as\r\nChappaqua, called into existence by a station on the Harlem Railroad. It\r\nembraces the south-easterly half of the marsh which the railroad here\r\ntraverses from south to north--my part measuring some fifteen acres,\r\nwith five acres more of slightly elevated dry land between it and the\r\nfoot of the rather rugged hill which rises thence on the east and on the\r\nsouth, and of which I now own some fifty acres, lying wholly eastward of\r\nmy low land, and in good part covered with forest. Of this, I bought\r\nmore than half in 1853, and the residue in bits from time to time as I\r\ncould afford it. The average cost was between $130 and $140 per acre:\r\none small and poor old cottage being the only building I found on the\r\ntract, which consisted of the ragged edges of two adjacent farms,\r\nbetween the western portions of which mine is now interposed, while they\r\nstill adjoin each other beyond the north and south road, half a mile\r\nfrom the railroad, on which their buildings are located and which forms\r\nmy eastern boundary. My stony, gravelly upland mainly slopes to the\r\nwest; but two acres on my east line incline toward the road which bounds\r\nme in that direction, while two more on my south-east corner descend to\r\nthe little brook which, entering at that corner, keeps irregularly near\r\nmy south line, until it emerges, swelled by a smaller runnel that enters\r\nmy lowland from the north and traverses it to meet and pass off with the\r\nlarger brooklet aforesaid. I have done some draining, to no great\r\npurpose, on the more level portions of my upland; but my lowland has\r\nchallenged my best efforts in this line, and I shall here explain them,\r\nfor the encouragement and possible guidance of novices in draining. Let\r\nme speak first of\r\n\r\n_My Difficulties._--This marsh or bog consisted, when I first grappled\r\nwith it, of some thirty acres, whereof I then owned less than a third.\r\nTo drain it to advantage, one person should own it all, or the different\r\nowners should cooperate; but I had to go it alone, with no other aid\r\nthan a freely accorded privilege of straightening as well as deepening\r\nthe brook which wound its way through the dryer meadow just below me,\r\nforming here the boundary of two adjacent farms. I spent $100 on this\r\njob, which is still imperfect; but the first decided fall in the stream\r\noccurs nearly a mile below me; and you tire easily of doing at your own\r\ncost work which benefits several others as much as yourself. My\r\ndrainage will never be perfect till this brook, with that far larger\r\none in which it is merged sixty rods below me, shall have been sunk\r\nthree or four feet, at a further expense of at least $500.\r\n\r\nThis bog or swamp, when I first bought into it, was mainly dedicated to\r\nthe use of frogs, muskrats and snapping-turtles. A few small water-elms\r\nand soft maples grew upon it, with swamp alder partly fringing the\r\nwestern base of the hill east of it, where the rocks which had, through\r\nthousands of years, rolled from the hill, thickly covered the surface,\r\nwith springs bubbling up around and among them. Decaying stumps and\r\nimbedded fragments of trees argued that timber formerly covered this\r\nmarsh as well as the encircling hills. A tall, dense growth of\r\nblackberry briers, thoroughwort, and all manner of marsh-weeds and\r\ngrasses, covered the center of the swamp each Summer; but my original\r\nportion of it, being too wet for these, was mainly addicted to hassocks\r\nor tussocks of wiry, worthless grass; their matted roots rising in hard\r\nbunches a few inches above the soft, bare, encircling mud. The bog\r\nranged in depth from a few inches to five or six feet, and was composed\r\nof black, peaty, vegetable mold, diversified by occasional streaks of\r\nclay or sand, all resting on a substratum of hard, coarse gravel, out of\r\nwhich two or three springs bubbled up, in addition to the half a dozen\r\nwhich poured in from the east, and a tiny rivulet which (except in a\r\nvery dry, hot time) added the tribute of three or four more, which\r\nsprang from the base of a higher shelf of the hill near the middle of\r\nwhat is now my farm. Add to these that the brook which brawled and\r\nfoamed down my hill-side near my south line as aforesaid, had brought\r\nalong an immensity of pebbles and gravel of which it had mainly formed\r\nmy five acres of dryer lowland, had thus built up a pretty swale,\r\nwhereon it had the bad habit of filling up one channel, and then cutting\r\nanother, more devious and eccentric, if possible, than any of its\r\npredecessors--and you have some idea of the obstacles I encountered and\r\nresolved to overcome. One of my first substantial improvements was the\r\ncutting of a straight channel for this current and, by walling it with\r\nlarge stones, compelling the brook to respect necessary limitations. It\r\nwas not my fault that some of those stones were set nearly upright, so\r\nas to veneer the brook rather than thoroughly constrain it: hence, some\r\nof the stones, undermined by strong currents, were pitched forward into\r\nthe brook by high Spring freshets, so as to require resetting more\r\ncarefully. This was a mistake, but, not one of\r\n\r\n_My Blunders._--These, the natural results of inexperience and haste,\r\nwere very grave. Not only had I had no real experience in draining when\r\nI began, but I could hire no foreman who know much more of it than I\r\ndid. I ought to have begun by securing an ample and sure fall where the\r\nwater left my land, and next cut down the brooklet or open ditch into\r\nwhich I intended to drain to the lowest practicable point--so low, at\r\nleast, that no drain running into it should ever be troubled with\r\nback-water. Nothing can be more useless than a drain in which water\r\nstagnates, choking it with mud. Then I should have bought hundreds of\r\nHemlock or other cheap boards, slit them to a width of four or five\r\ninches, and, having opened the needed drains, laid these in the bottom\r\nand the tile thereupon, taking care to _break joint_, by covering the\r\nmeeting ends of two boards with the middle of a tile. Laying tile in the\r\nsoft mud of a bog, with nothing beneath to prevent their sinking, is\r\nsimply throwing away labor and money. I cannot wonder that tile-draining\r\nseems to many a humbug, seeing that so many tile are laid so that they\r\ncan never do any good.\r\n\r\nHaving, by successive purchases, become owner of fully half of this\r\nswamp, and by repeated blunders discovered that making stone drains in a\r\nbog, while it is a capital mode of getting rid of the stone, is no way\r\nat all to dry the soil, I closed my series of experiments two years\r\nsince by carefully relaying my generally useless tile on good strips of\r\nboard, sinking them just as deep as I could persuade the water to run\r\noff freely, and, instead of allowing them to discharge into a brooklet\r\nor open ditch, connecting each with a covered main of four to six-inch\r\ntile; these mains discharging into the running brook which drains all my\r\nfarm and three or four of those above it just where it runs swiftly off\r\nfrom my land. If a thaw or heavy rain swells the brook (as it sometimes\r\nwill) so that it rises above my outlet aforesaid, the strong current\r\nformed by the concentration of the clear contents of so many drains will\r\nnot allow the muddy water of the brook to back into it so many as three\r\nfeet at most; and any mud or sediment that may be deposited there will\r\nbe swept out clean whenever the brook shall have fallen to the drainage\r\nlevel. For this and similar excellent devices, I am indebted to the\r\ncapital engineering and thorough execution of Messrs. Chickering & Gall,\r\nwhose work on my place has seldom required mending, and never called for\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n_My Success._--I judge that there are not many tracts more difficult to\r\ndrain than mine was, considering all the circumstances, except those\r\nwhich are frequently flowed by tides or the waters of some lake, or\r\nriver. Had I owned the entire swamp, or had there been a fall in the\r\nbrook just below me, had I had any prior experience in draining, or had\r\nothers equally interested cooperated in the good work, my task would\r\nhave been comparatively light. As it was, I made mistakes which\r\nincreased the cost and postponed the success of my efforts; but this is\r\nat length complete. I had seven acres of Indian Corn, one of Corn\r\nFodder, two of Oats, and seven or eight acres of Grass, on my lowland in\r\n1869; and, though the Spring months were quite rainy, and the latter\r\npart of Summer rather dry, my crops were all good. I did not see better\r\nin Westchester County; and I shall be quite content with as good\r\nhereafter. Of my seven hundred bushels of Corn (ears,) I judge that\r\ntwo-thirds would be accounted fit for seed anywhere; my Grass was cut\r\ntwice, and yielded one large crop and another heavier than the average\r\nfirst crop throughout our State. My drainage will require some care\r\nhenceforth; but the fifteen acres I have reclaimed from utter\r\nuselessness and obstructions are decidedly the best part of my farm,\r\nUplands may be exhausted; these never can be.\r\n\r\nThe experience of another season (1870) of protracted drouth has fully\r\njustified my most sanguine expectations. I had this year four acres of\r\nCorn, and as many of Oats, on my swamp, with the residue in Grass; and\r\nthey were all good. I estimate my first Hay-crop at over two and a half\r\ntuns per acre, while the rowen or aftermath barely exceeded half a tun\r\nper acre, because of the severity of the drouth, which began in July and\r\nlasted till October. My Oats were good, but not remarkably so; and I had\r\n810 bushels of ears of sound, ripe Corn from four acres of drained swamp\r\nand two and a half of upland. I estimate my upland Corn at seventy\r\n(shelled) bushels, and my lowland at fifty-five (shelled) bushels per\r\nacre. Others, doubtless, had more, despite the unpropitious season; but\r\nmy crop was a fair one, and I am content with it. My upland Corn was\r\nheavily manured; my lowland but moderately. There are many to tell you\r\nhow much I lose by my farming; I only say that, as yet, no one else has\r\nlost a farthing by it, and I do not complain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nDRAINING GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving narrated my own experience in draining with entire unreserve, I\r\nhere submit the general conclusions to which it has led me:\r\n\r\nI. While I doubt that there is _any_ land above water that would not be\r\nimproved by a good system of underdrains, I am sure that there is a\r\ngreat deal that could not at present be drained to profit. Forests,\r\nhill-side pastures, and most dry gravelly or sandy tracts, I place in\r\nthis category. Perhaps one-third of New-England, half of the Middle\r\nStates, and three-fourths of the Mississippi Valley, may ultimately be\r\ndrained with profit.\r\n\r\nII. _All_ swamp lands without exception, nearly all clay soils, and a\r\nmajority of the flat or gently rolling lands of this country, must\r\neventually be drained, if they are to be tilled with the best results. I\r\ndoubt that there is a garden on earth that would not be (unless it\r\nalready had been) improved by thorough underdraining.\r\n\r\nIII. The uses of underdrains are many and diverse. To carry off surplus\r\nwater, though the most obvious, stands by no means alone. 1.\r\nUnderdrained land may be plowed and sowed considerably earlier in Spring\r\nthan undrained soil of like quality. 2. Drained fields lose far less\r\nthan others of their fertility by washing. 3. They are not so liable to\r\nbe gullied by sudden thaws or flooding rains. 4. Where a field has been\r\ndeeply subsoiled, I am confident that it will remain mellow and\r\npermeable by roots longer than if undrained. 5. Less water being\r\nevaporated from drained than from undrained land, the soil will be\r\nwarmer throughout the growing season; hence, the crop will be heavier,\r\nand will mature earlier. 6. Being more porous and less compact, I think\r\nthe soil of a drained field retains more moisture in a season of drouth,\r\nand its growing plants suffer less therefrom, than if it were undrained.\r\nIn short, I thoroughly believe in underdraining.\r\n\r\nIV. Yet I advise no man to run into debt for draining, as I can imagine\r\na mortgage on a farm so heavy and pressing as to be even a greater\r\nnuisance than stagnant water in its soil. Labor and tile are dear with\r\nus; I do not expect that either will ever be so cheap here as in England\r\nor Belgium. What I _would_ have each farmer in moderate circumstances do\r\nis to _drain his wettest field_ next Fall--that is, after finishing his\r\nhaying and before cutting up his corn--taking care to secure abundant\r\nfall to carry off the water in time of flood, and doing his work\r\nthoroughly. Having done this, let him subsoil deeply, fertilize amply,\r\ntill carefully, and watch the result. I think it will soon satisfy him\r\nthat such draining pays.\r\n\r\nV. I do not insist on tile as making the only good drain; but I have had\r\nno success with any other. The use of stone, in my opinion, is only\r\njustified where the field to be drained abounds in them and no other use\r\ncan be made of them. To make a good drain with ordinary boulders or\r\ncobble-stones requires twice the excavation and involves twice the labor\r\nnecessarily expended on tile-draining; and it is neither so effective\r\nnor so durable. Earth will be carried by water into a stone drain; rats\r\nand other vermin will burrow in it and dig (or enlarge) holes thence to\r\nthe surface; in short, it is not the thing. Better drain with stone\r\nwhere they are a nuisance than not at all; but I predict that you will\r\ndig them up after giving them a fair trial and replace them with tile.\r\nIn a wooded country, where tile were scarce and dear, I should try\r\ndraining with slabs or cheap boards dressed to a uniform width of six or\r\neight inches, and laid in a ditch dug with banks inclined or sloped to\r\nthe bottom, so as to form a sort of V; the lower edge of the two\r\nside-slabs coming together at the bottom, and a third being laid widely\r\nacross their upper edges, so as to form a perfect cap or cover. In firm,\r\nhard soil, this would prove an efficient drain, and, if well made, would\r\nlast twenty years. Uniformity of temperature and of moisture would keep\r\nthe slabs tolerably sound for at least so long; and, if the top of this\r\ndrain were two feet below the surface, no plowing or trampling over it\r\nwould harm it.\r\n\r\nVI. As to draining by what is called a Mole Plow, which simply makes a\r\nwaterway through the subsoil at a depth of three feet or thereabout, I\r\nhave no acquaintance with it but by hearsay. It seems to me morally\r\nimpossible that drains so made should not be lower at some points than\r\nat others, so as to retain their fill of water instead of carrying it\r\nrapidly off; and I am sure that plowing, or even carting heavy loads\r\nover them, must gradually choke and destroy them. Yet this kind of\r\ndraining is comparatively so cheap, and may, with a strong team, be\r\neffected so rapidly, that I can account for its popularity, especially\r\nin prairie regions. Where the subsoil is rocky, it is impracticable;\r\nwhere it is hard-pan, it must be very difficult; where it is loose sand,\r\nit cannot endure; but in clays or heavy loams, it may, for a few years,\r\nrender excellent service. I wish the heavy clays of Vermont, more\r\nespecially of the Champlain basin, were well furrowed or pierced by even\r\nsuch drains; for I am confident that they would temporarily improve both\r\nsoil and crop; and, if they soon gave out, they would probably be\r\nreplaced by others more durable.\r\n\r\n--I shall not attempt to give instructions in drain-making; but I urge\r\nevery novice in the art to procure Waring's or some other work on the\r\nsubject and study it carefully: then, if he can obtain at a fair price\r\nthe services of an experienced drainer, hire him to supervise the work.\r\nOne point only do I insist on--that is, draining into a main rather than\r\nan open ditch or brook; for it is difficult in this or any harsher\r\nclimate to prevent the crumbling of your outlet tile by frost. Below the\r\nPotomac or the Arkansas, this may not be apprehended; and there it may\r\nbe best to have your drains separately discharge from a road-side bank\r\nor into an open ditch, as they will thus inhale more air, and so help\r\n(in Summer) to warm and moisten the soil above them; but in our climate\r\nI believe it better to let your drains discharge into a covered main or\r\nmains as aforesaid, than into an open ditch or brook.\r\n\r\nTile and labor are dear with us; I presume labor will remain so. But, in\r\nour old States, there are often laborers lacking employment in November\r\nand the Winter months; and it is the wisest and truest charity to\r\nproffer them pay for work. Some will reject it unless the price be\r\nexorbitant; but there are scores of the deserving poor in almost every\r\nrural county, who would rather earn a dollar per day than hang around\r\nthe grog-shops waiting for Spring. Get your tiles when you can, or do\r\nnot get them at all, but let it be widely known that you have work for\r\nthose who will do it for the wages you can afford, and you will soon\r\nhave somebody to earn your money. Having staked out your drains, set\r\nthese to work at digging them, even though you should not be able to\r\ntile them for a year. Cut your outlet deep, and your land will profit by\r\na year of open drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION--MEANS AND ENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile few can have failed to realize the important part played by Water\r\nin the economy of vegetation, I judge that the question--\"How can I\r\nsecure to my growing plants a sufficiency of moisture at all\r\ntimes?\"--has not always presented itself to the farmer's mind as\r\ndemanding of him a practical solution. To rid his soil and keep it free\r\nof superfluous, but especially of stagnant water, he may or may not\r\naccept as a necessity; but that, having provided for draining away\r\nwhatever is excessive, he should turn a short corner and begin at once\r\nto provide that water shall be supplied to his fields and plants\r\nwhenever they may need it, he is often slow to apprehend. Yet this\r\nprovision is but the counterpart and complement of the other.\r\n\r\nI had sped across Europe to Venice, and noted with interest the\r\nadmirable, effective irrigation of the great plain of Lombardy, before I\r\ncould call any land my own. I saw there a region perhaps thirty miles\r\nwide by one hundred and fifty along the east bank of the Po, rising very\r\ngently thence to the foot of the Austrian Alps, which Providence seems\r\nto have specially adapted to be improved by irrigation. The torrents of\r\nmelted snow which in Spring leap and foam adown the southern face of the\r\nAlps, bringing with them the finer particles of soil, are suddenly\r\narrested and form lakes (Garda, Maggiore, Como, etc.) just as they\r\nemerge upon the plain. These lakes, slowly rising, often overflow their\r\nbanks, with those of the small rivers that bear their waters westward to\r\nthe Po; and this overflow was a natural source of abiding fertility. To\r\ndam these outlets, and thus control their currents, was a very simple\r\nand obvious device of long ago, and was probably begun by a very few\r\nindividuals (if by more than one), whose success incited emulation,\r\nuntil the present extensive and costly system of irrigating dams and\r\ncanals was gradually developed. When I traversed Lombardy in July, 1851,\r\nthe beds of streams naturally as large as the Pemigewasset, Battenkill,\r\nCanada Creek, or Humboldt, were utterly dry; the water which would\r\nnaturally have flowed therein being wholly transferred to an irrigating\r\ncanal (or to canals) often two or three miles distant. The reservoirs\r\nthus created were filled in Spring, when the streams were fullest and\r\ntheir water richest, and gradually drawn upon throughout the later\r\ngrowing season to cover the carefully leveled and graded fields on\r\neither side to the depth of an inch or two at a time. If any failed to\r\nbe soon absorbed by the soil, it was drawn off as here superfluous, and\r\nadded to the current employed to moisten and fertilize the field next\r\nbelow it; and so field after field was refreshed and enriched, to the\r\nhusbandman's satisfaction and profit. It may be that the rich glades of\r\nEnglish Lancashire bear heavier average crops; but those of Lombardy are\r\nrarely excelled on the globe.\r\n\r\nWhy should not our Atlantic slope have its Lombardy? Utah, Nevada, and\r\nCalifornia, exhibit raw, crude suggestions of such a system; but why\r\nshould the irrigation of the New World be confined to regions where it\r\nis indispensable, when that of the Old is not? I know no good reason\r\nwhatever for leaving an American field unirrigated where water to flow\r\nit at will can be had at a moderate cost.\r\n\r\nWhen I first bought land (in 1853) I fully purposed to provide for\r\nirrigating my nearly level acres at will, and I constructed two dams\r\nacross my upland stream with that view; but they were so badly planned\r\nthat they went off in the flood caused by a tremendous rain the next\r\nSpring; and, though I rebuilt one of them, I submitted to a\r\nmiscalculation which provided for taking the water, by means of a\r\nsyphon, out of the pond at the top and over the bank that rose fifteen\r\nor twenty feet above the surface of the water. Of course, air would work\r\ninto the pipe after it had carried a stream unexceptionably for two or\r\nthree days, and then the water would run no longer. Had I taken it from\r\nthe bottom of the pond through my dam, it would have run forever, (or so\r\nlong as there was water covering its inlet in the pond;) but bad\r\nengineering flung me; and I have never since had the heart (or the\r\nmeans) to revise and correct its errors.\r\n\r\nMy next attempt was on a much humbler scale, and I engineered it myself.\r\nToward the north end of my farm, the hill-side which rises east of my\r\nlowland is broken by a swale or terrace, which gives me three or four\r\nacres of tolerably level upland, along the upper edge of which five or\r\nsix springs, which never wholly fail, burst from the rocks above and\r\nunite to form a petty runnel, which dries up in very hot or dry weather,\r\nbut which usually preserved a tiny stream to be lost in the swamp below.\r\nNorth of the gully cut down the lower hill-side by this streamlet, the\r\nhill-side of some three acres is quite steep, still partially wooded,\r\nand wholly devoted to pasturage. Making a petty dam across this runnel\r\nat the top of the lower acclivity, I turned the stream aside, so that it\r\nshould henceforth run along the crest of this lower hill, falling off\r\ngradually so as to secure a free current, and losing its contents at\r\nintervals through variable depressions in its lower bank. Dam and\r\nartificial water-course together cost me $90, which was about twice what\r\nit should have been. That rude and petty contrivance has now been ten\r\nyears in operation, and may have cost $5 per annum for oversight and\r\nrepairs. Its effect has been to double the grass grown on the two acres\r\nit constantly irrigates, for which I paid $280, or more than thrice the\r\ncost of my irrigation. But more: my hill-side, while it was well\r\ngrassed in Spring, always gave out directly after the first dry, or hot\r\nweek; so that, when I most needed feed, it afforded none; its herbage\r\nbeing parched up and dead, and thus remaining till refreshed by generous\r\nrains. I judge, therefore, that my irrigation has _more_ than doubled\r\nthe product of those two acres, and that these are likely to lose\r\nnothing in yield or value so long as that petty irrigating ditch shall\r\nbe maintained.\r\n\r\nI know this is small business. But suppose each of the hundred thousand\r\nNew-England farms, whereof five to ten acres might be thus irrigated at\r\na cost not exceeding $100 per farm, had been similarly prepared to flow\r\nthose acres last Spring and early Summer, with an average increase\r\ntherefrom of barely one tun of Hay (or its equivalent in pasturage) per\r\nacre. The 500,000 tuns of Hay thus realized would have saved 200,000\r\nhead of cattle from being sent to the butcher while too thin for good\r\nbeef, while every one of them was required for further use, and will\r\nhave to be replaced at a heavy cost. Shall not these things be\r\nconsidered? Shall not all who can do so at moderate cost resolve to test\r\non their own farms the advantages and benefits that may be secured by\r\nIrrigation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBILITIES OF IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given an account of my poor, little experiment in Irrigation,\r\nbecause it is one which almost every farmer can imitate and improve\r\nupon, however narrow his domain and slender his fortune. I presume there\r\nare Half a Million homesteads in the United States which have natural\r\nfacilities for Irrigation at least equal to mine; many of them far\r\ngreater. Along either slope of the Alleghenies, throughout a district at\r\nleast a thousand miles long by three hundred wide, nearly every farm\r\nmight be at least partially irrigated by means of a dam costing from\r\ntwenty-five to one hundred dollars; so might at least half the farms in\r\nNew-England and our own State. On the prairies, the plans must be\r\ndifferent, and the expense probably greater, but the results obtained\r\nwould bounteously reward the outlay. I shall not see the day, but there\r\nare those now living who _will_ see it, when Artesian wells will be dug\r\nat points where many acres may be flowed from a gentle swell in the\r\nmidst of a vast plain, or at the head of a fertile valley, expressly, or\r\nat least mainly, that its waters may be led across that plain, adown\r\nthat valley, in irrigating streams and ditches, until they have been\r\nwholly drank up by the soil. I have seen single wells in California that\r\nmight be made to irrigate sufficiently hundreds of acres, by the aid of\r\na reservoir into which their waters could be discharged when the soil\r\ndid not require them, and there retained until the thirsty earth\r\ndemanded them.\r\n\r\nAn old and successful farmer in my neighborhood affirms that Water is\r\nthe cheapest and best fertilizer ever applied to the soil. If this were\r\nunderstood to mean that no other is needed or can be profitably applied,\r\nit would be erroneous. Still, I think it clearly true that the annual\r\nproduct of most farms can be increased, and the danger of failure\r\naverted, more cheaply by the skillful application of water than by that\r\nof any other fertilizer whatever, Plaster (Gypsum) possibly excepted.\r\n\r\nI took a run through Virginia last Summer, not far from the 1st of\r\nAugust. That State was then suffering intensely from drouth, as she\r\ncontinued to do for some weeks thereafter. I am quite sure that I saw on\r\nher thirsty plains and hillsides not less than three hundred thousand\r\nacres planted with Indian Corn, whereof the average product could not\r\nexceed ten bushels per acre, while most of it would fall far below that\r\nyield, and there were thousands of acres that would not produce one\r\nsound ear! Every one deplored the failure, correctly attributing it to\r\nthe prevailing drouth. And yet, I passed hundreds if not thousands of\r\nplaces where a very moderate outlay would have sufficed to dam a stream\r\nor brooklet issuing from between two spurs of the Blue Ridge, or the\r\nAlleghenies, so that a refreshing current of the copious and fertilizing\r\nfloods of Winter and Spring, warmed by the fervid suns of June and July,\r\ncould have been led over broad fields lying below, so as to vanquish\r\ndrouth and insure generous harvests. Nay; I feel confident that I could\r\nin many places have constructed rude works in a week, after that drouth\r\nbegan to be felt, that would have saved and made the Corn on at least a\r\nportion of the planted acres through which the now shrunken brooks\r\ndanced and laughed idly down to the larger streams in the wider and\r\nequally thirsty valleys. Of course, I know that this would have been\r\nimperfect irrigation--a mere stop-gap--that the cold spring-water of a\r\nparched Summer cannot fertilize as the hill-wash of Winter and Spring,\r\nif thriftily garnered and warmed through and through for sultry weeks,\r\nwould do; yet I believe that very many farmers might, even then, have\r\nsecured partial crops by such irrigation as was still possible, had\r\nthey, even at the eleventh hour, done their best to retrieve the errors\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nFor the present, I would only counsel every farmer to give his land a\r\ncareful scrutiny with a view to irrigation in the future. No one is\r\nobliged to do any faster than his means will justify; and yet it may be\r\nwell to have a clear comprehension of all that may ultimately be done to\r\nprofit, even though much of it must long remain unattempted. In many\r\ncases, a stream may be dammed for the power which it will afford for two\r\nor three months of each year, if it shall appear that this use is quite\r\nconsistent with its employment to irrigation, when the former alone\r\nwould not justify the requisite outlay. It is by thus making one expense\r\nsubserve two quite independent but not inconsistent purposes that\r\nsuccess is attained in other pursuits; and so it may be in farming.\r\n\r\nAs yet, each farmer must study his own resources with intent to make the\r\nmost of them. If a manageable stream crosses or issues from his land, he\r\nmust measure its fall thereon, study the lay of the land, and determine\r\nwhether he can or cannot, at a tolerable cost, make that stream\r\navailable in the irrigation of at least a portion of his growing crops\r\nwhen they shall need water and the skies decline to supply it. On many,\r\nI think on most, farms situated among hills, or upon the slopes of\r\nmountains, something may be done in this way--done at once, and with\r\nimmediate profit. But this is rudimentary, partial, fragmentary, when\r\ncompared with the irrigation which yet shall be. I am confident that\r\nthere are points on the Carson, the Humboldt, the Weber, the South\r\nPlatte, the Cache-le-Poudre, and many less noted streams which thrid the\r\ncentral plateau of our continent, where an expenditure of $10,000 to\r\n$50,000 may be judiciously made in a dam, locks and canals, for the\r\npurposes of irrigation and milling combined, with a moral certainty of\r\nrealizing fifty per cent. annually on the outlay, with a steady\r\nincrease in the value of the property. If my eye did not deceive me,\r\nthere is one point on the Carson where a dam that need not cost $50,000\r\nwould irrigate one hundred square miles of rich plain which, when I saw\r\nit eleven years ago, grew nought but the worthless shrubs of the desert,\r\nsimply because nothing else could endure the intense, abiding drouth of\r\neach Nevada Summer. Such palpable invitations to thrift cannot remain\r\nforever unimproved.\r\n\r\nIn regions like this, where Summer rains are the rule rather than the\r\nexception, the need of irrigation is not so palpable, since we do or may\r\nsecure decent average crops in its absence. Yet there is no farm in our\r\ncountry that would not yield considerably more grain and more grass,\r\nmore fruit and more vegetables, if its owner had water at command which\r\nhe could apply at pleasure and to any extent he should deem requisite.\r\nMost men, thus empowered, would at first irrigate too often and too\r\ncopiously; but experience would soon temper their zeal, and teach them\r\n\r\n  \"The precious art of Not too much;\"\r\n\r\nand they would thenceforth be careful to give their soil drink yet, not\r\ndrown it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhoever lives beyond the close of this century, and shall then traverse\r\nour prairie States, will see them whitened at intervals by the broad\r\nsails of windmills erected over wells, whence every gale or breeze will\r\nbe employed in pumping water into the ponds or reservoirs so located\r\nthat water may be drawn therefrom at will and diffused in gentle\r\nstreamlets over the surrounding fields to invigorate and impel their\r\ngrowing crops. And, when all has been done that this paper faintly\r\nforeshadows, our people will have barely indicated, not by any means\r\nexhausted, the beneficent possibilities of irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is in making a beginning. Too many farmers would fain\r\nconceal a poverty of thought behind an affectation of dislike or\r\ncontempt for novelties. \"Humbug!\" is their stereotyped comment on every\r\nsuggestion that they might wisely and profitably do something otherwise\r\nthan as their grandfathers did. They assume that those respected\r\nancestors did very well without Irrigation; wherefore, it cannot now be\r\nessential. But the circumstances have materially changed. The\r\ndisappearance of the dense, high woods that formerly almost or quite\r\nsurrounded each farm has given a sweep to the heated, parching winds of\r\nSummer, to which our ancestors were strangers. Our springs, our streams,\r\ndo not hold out as they once did. Our Summer drouths are longer and\r\nfiercer. Even though our grandfathers did not, we _do_ need and may\r\nprofit by Irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nPLOWING--DEEP OR SHALLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules absolutely without exception are rare; and they who imagine that I\r\ninsist on plowing all lands deeply are wrong for I hold that much land\r\nshould never be plowed at all. In fact, I have seen in my life nearly as\r\nlarge an area that ought not as I have that ought to be plowed, by which\r\nI mean that half the land I have seen may serve mankind better if\r\ndevoted to timber than if subjected to tillage. I personally know\r\nfarmers who would thrive far better if they tilled but half the area\r\nthey do, bestowing on this all the labor and fertilizers they spread\r\nover the whole, even though they threw the residue into common and left\r\nit there. I judge that a majority of our farmers could increase the\r\nrecompense of their toil by cultivating fewer acres than they now do.\r\n\r\nNor do I deny that there are soils which it is not advisable to plow\r\ndeeply. Prof. Mapes told me he had seen a tract in West Jersey whereof\r\nthe soil was but eight inches deep, resting on a stratum of copperas\r\n(sulphate of iron,) which, being upturned by the plow and mingled with\r\nthe soil, poisoned the crops planted thereon. And I saw, last Summer,\r\non the intervale of New River, in the western part of Old Virginia, many\r\nacres of Corn which were thrifty and luxuriant in spite of shallow\r\nplowing and intense drouth, because the rich, black loam which had there\r\nbeen deposited by semi-annual inundations, until its depth ranged from\r\ntwo to twenty feet, was so inviting and permeable that the corn-roots\r\nran _below_ the bottom of the furrow about as readily as above that\r\nline. I do not doubt that there are many millions of acres of such land\r\nthat would produce tolerably, and sometimes bounteously, though simply\r\nscratched over by a brush harrow and never plowed at all. In the infancy\r\nof our race, when there were few mouths to fill and when farming\r\nimplements were very rude and ineffective, cultivation was all but\r\nconfined to these facile strips and patches, so that the utility, the\r\nneed, of deep tillage was not apparent. And yet, we know the crops often\r\nfailed utterly in those days, plunging whole nations into the miseries\r\nof famine.\r\n\r\nThe primitive plow was a forked stick or tree-top, whereof one prong\r\nformed the coulter, the other and longer the beam; and he who first\r\nsharpened the coulter-prong with a stone hatchet was the Whitney or\r\nMcCormick of his day. The plow in common use to-day in Spain or Turkey\r\nis an improvement on this, for it has an iron point; still, it is a\r\nmiserable tool. When, at five years old, I first rode the horse which\r\ndrew my father's plow in furrowing for or cultivating his corn, it had\r\nan iron coulter and an iron share; but it was mainly composed of wood.\r\nIn the hard, rocky soil of New-Hampshire, as full of bowlders and\r\npebbles as a Christmas pudding is of plums, plowing with such an\r\nimplement was a sorry business at best. My father hitched eight oxen and\r\na horse to his plow when he broke up pebbly green-sward, and found an\r\nacre of it a very long day's work. I hardly need add that subsoiling was\r\nout of the question, and that six inches was the average depth of his\r\nfurrow.\r\n\r\nI judge that the best Steel Plows now in use do twice the execution that\r\nhis did with a like expenditure of power--that we can, with equal power,\r\nplow twelve inches as easily and rapidly as he plowed six. Ought we to\r\ndo it? Will it pay?\r\n\r\nI first farmed for myself in 1845 on a plat of eight acres, in what was\r\nthen the open country skirting the East River nearly abreast the lower\r\npoint of Blackwell's Island, near Fiftieth-st., on a little indentation\r\nof the shore known as Turtle Bay. None of the Avenues east of Third was\r\nthen opened above Thirtieth-st.; and the neighborhood, though now\r\nperforated by streets and covered with houses, was as rural and secluded\r\nas heart could wish. One fine Spring morning, a neighbor called and\r\noffered to plow for $5 my acre of tillage not cut up by rows of box and\r\nother shrubs; and I told him to go ahead. I came home next evening, just\r\nas he was finishing the job, which I contemplated most ruefully. His\r\nplow was a pocket edition; his team a single horse; his furrows at most\r\nfive inches deep. I paid him, but told him plainly that I would have\r\npreferred to give the money for nothing. He insisted that he had plowed\r\nfor me as he plowed for others all around me. \"I will tell you,\" I\r\nrejoined, \"exactly how this will work. Throughout the Spring and early\r\nSummer, we shall have frequent rains and moderate heat: thus far, my\r\ncrops will do well. But then will come hot weeks, with little or no\r\nrain; and they will dry up this shallow soil and every thing planted\r\nthereon.\"\r\n\r\nThe result signally justified my prediction. We had frequent rains and\r\ncloudy, mild weather, till the 1st of July, when the clouds vanished,\r\nthe sun came out intensely hot, and we had scarcely a sprinkle till the\r\n1st of September, by which time my Corn and Potatoes had about given up\r\nthe ghost. Like the seed which fell on stony ground in the Parable of\r\nthe Sower, that which I had planted had withered away \"because there was\r\nno root;\" and my prospect for a harvest was utterly blighted, where,\r\nwith twelve inches of loose, fertile, well pulverized earth at their\r\nroots, my crops would have been at least respectable. When I became once\r\nmore a farmer in a small way on my present place, I had not forgotten\r\nthe lesson, and I tried to have plowed deeply and thoroughly so much\r\nland as I had plowed at all. My first Summer here (1853) was a very dry\r\none, and crops failed in consequence around me and all over the country;\r\nyet mine were at least fair; and I was largely indebted for them to\r\nrelatively deep plowing. I have since suffered from frost (on my low\r\nland), from the rotting of seed in the ground, from the ravages of\r\ninsects, etc.; but never by drouth; and I am entirely confident that\r\nDeep Plowing has done me excellent service. My only trouble has been to\r\nget it done; for there are apt to be reasons?--(haste, lateness in the\r\nseason, etc.)--for plowing shallowly for \"just this time,\" with full\r\nintent to do henceforth better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI close this paper with a statement made to me by an intelligent British\r\nfarmer living at Maidstone, south of England. He said:\r\n\r\n\"A few years ago there came into my hands a field of twelve acres, which\r\nhad been an orchard; but the trees were hopelessly in their dotage. They\r\nmust be cut down; then their roots must be grubbed out; so I resolved to\r\nmake a clean job of it, and give the field a thorough trenching.\r\nChoosing a time in Autumn or early Winter when labor was abundant and\r\ncheap, I had it turned over three spits (27 inches) deep; the lowest\r\nbeing merely reversed; the next reversed and placed at the top; the\r\nsurface being reversed and placed below the second. The soil was strong\r\nand deep, as that of an orchard should be; I planted the field to Garden\r\nPeas, and my first picking was very abundant. About the time that peas\r\nusually begin to wither and die, the roots of mine struck the rich soil\r\nwhich had been the first stratum, but was now the second, and at once\r\nthe stalks evinced a new life--threw out new blossoms, which were\r\nfollowed by pods; and so kept on blossoming and forming peas for weeks,\r\nuntil this first crop far more than paid the cost of trenching and\r\ncultivation.\"\r\n\r\nThus far my English friend. Who will this year try a patch of Peas on a\r\nplat made rich and mellow for a depth of at least two feet, and\r\nfrequently moistened in Summer by some rude kind of irrigation?\r\n\r\nThe fierceness of our Summer suns, when not counteracted by frequent\r\nshowers, shortens deplorably the productiveness of many Vegetables and\r\nBerries. Our Strawberries bear well, but too briefly; our Peas wither up\r\nand cease to blossom after they have been two or three weeks plump\r\nenough to pick. Our Raspberries, Blackberries, etc., fruit well, but are\r\nout of bearing too soon after they begin to yield their treasures. I am\r\nconfident that this need not be. With a deep, rich soil, kept moistened\r\nby a periodical flow of water, there need not and should not be any such\r\nhaste to give over blooming and bearing. The fruit is Nature's\r\nattestation of the geniality of the season, the richness and abundance\r\nof the elements inhering in the soil or supplied to it by the water.\r\nDouble the supply of these, and sterility should be postponed to a far\r\nlater day than that in which it is now inaugurated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nPLOWING--GOOD AND BAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many wrong ways to do a thing to but one right one that\r\nthere is no reason in the impatience too often evinced with those who\r\ncontrive to swallow the truth wrong end foremost, and thereupon insist\r\nthat it won't do. For instance: A farmer hears something said of deep\r\nplowing, and, without any clear understanding of or firm faith in it,\r\nresolves to give it a trial. So he buys a great plow, makes up a strong\r\nteam, and proceeds to turn up a field hitherto plowed but six inches to\r\na depth of a foot: in other words, to bury its soil under six inches of\r\ncold, sterile clay, sand, or gravel. On this, he plants or sows grain,\r\nand is lucky indeed if he realizes half a crop. Hereupon, he reports to\r\nhis neighbors that Deep Plowing is a humbug, as he suspected all along;\r\nbut now he knows, for he has tried it. There are several other wrong\r\nways, which I will hurry over, in order to set forth that which I regard\r\nas the right one.\r\n\r\nHere is a middling farmer of the old school, who walks carefully in the\r\nfootsteps of his respected grandfather, but with inferior success,\r\nbecause sixty annual harvests, though not particularly luxuriant, have\r\npartially exhausted the productive capacity of the acres he inherited.\r\nHe now garners from fifteen to thirty bushels per acre of Corn, from ten\r\nto twenty of Wheat, from fifteen to twenty of Rye, from twenty to thirty\r\nof Oats, and from a tun to a tun and a half of Hay, as the season proves\r\nmore or less propitious, and just contrives to draw from his sixty to\r\none hundred acres a decent subsistence for his family; plowing, as his\r\nfather and grandfather did, to a depth of five to seven inches: What can\r\nDeep Plowing do for _him_?\r\n\r\nI answer--By itself, nothing whatever. If in every other respect he is\r\nto persist in doing just as his father and his grandfather did, I doubt\r\nthe expediency of doubling the depth of his furrows. True, the worst\r\neffects of the change would be realized at the outset, and I feel\r\nconfident that his six inches of subsoil, having been made to change\r\nplaces with that which formerly rested upon it, must gradually be\r\nwrought upon by air, and rain, and frost, until converted into a\r\ntolerably productive soil, through which the roots of most plants would\r\neasily and speedily make their way down to the richer stratum which,\r\noriginally surface, has been transposed into subsoil. But this exchange\r\nof positions between the original surface and subsoil is not what I mean\r\nby Deep Plowing, nor anything like it. What I _do_ mean is this:\r\n\r\nHaving thoroughly underdrained a field, so that water will not stand\r\nupon any part of its surface, no matter how much may there be deposited,\r\nthe next step in order is to increase the depth of the soil. To this\r\nend, procure a regular sub-soil plow of the most approved pattern,\r\nattach to it a strong team, and let it follow the breaking-plow in its\r\nfurrow, lifting and pulverizing the sub-soil to a depth of not less than\r\nsix inches, but leaving it in position exactly where it was. The\r\nsurface-plow turns the next furrow upon this loosened sub-soil, and so\r\non till the whole field is thus pulverized to a depth of not less than\r\ntwelve inches, or, better still, fifteen. Now, please remember that you\r\nhave twice as much soil per acre to fertilize as there was before;\r\nhence, that it consequently requires twice as much manure, and you will\r\nhave laid a good foundation for increased crops. I do not say that all\r\nthe additional outlay will be returned to you in the increase of your\r\nnext crop, for I do not believe anything of the sort; but I _do_ believe\r\nthat this crop will be considerably larger for this generous treatment,\r\nespecially if the season prove remarkably dry or uncommonly wet; and\r\nthat you will have insured better crops in the years to come, including\r\nheavier grass, after that field shall once more be laid down; and that,\r\nin case of the planting of that field to fruit or other trees, they will\r\ngrow faster, resist disease better, and thrive longer, than if the soil\r\nwere still plowed as of old. (I shall insist hereafter on the advantage\r\nand importance of subsoiling orchards.)\r\n\r\nTake another aspect--that of subsoiling hill-sides to prevent their\r\nabrasion by water:\r\n\r\nI have two bits of warm, gravelly hill-side, which bountifully yield\r\nCorn, Wheat and Oats, but which are addicted to washing. I presume one\r\nof these bits, at the south-east corner of my farm, has been plowed and\r\nplanted not less than one hundred times, and that at least half the\r\nfertilizers applied to it have been washed into the brook, and hence\r\ninto the Hudson. To say that $1,000 have thus been squandered on that\r\npatch of ground, would be to keep far within the truth. And, along with\r\nthe fertilizers, a large portion of the finer and better elements of the\r\noriginal soil have thus been swept into the brook, and so lavished upon\r\nthe waters of our bay. But, since I had those lots thoroughly subsoiled,\r\nall the water that falls upon them when in tillage sinks into the soil,\r\nand remains there until drained away by filtration or evaporation; and I\r\nnever saw a particle of soil washed from either save once, when a thaw\r\nof one or two inches on the surface, leaving the ground solidly frozen\r\nbeneath, being quickly followed by a pouring rain, washed away a few\r\nbushels of the loosened and sodden surface, proving that the law by\r\nvirtue of which these fields were formerly denuded while in cultivation\r\nis still active, and that Deep Plowing is an effective and all but\r\nunfailing antidote for the evil it tends to incite.\r\n\r\nWe plow too many acres annually, and do not plow them so thoroughly as\r\nwe ought. In the good time coming, when Steam shall have been so\r\nharnessed to a gang of six to twelve plows that, with one man guiding\r\nand firing, it will move as fast as a man ought to walk, steaming on and\r\nthoroughly pulverizing from twelve to twenty-five acres per day, I\r\nbelieve we shall plow at least two feet deep, and plow not less than\r\ntwice before putting in any crop whatever. Then we may lay down a field\r\nin the confident trust that it will yield from two and a half to three\r\ntuns of good hay per annum for the next ten or twelve years; while, by\r\nthe help of irrigation and occasional top-dressing, it may be made to\r\naverage at least three tuns for a life-time, if not forever.\r\n\r\nWhen my Grass-land requires breaking up--as it sometimes does--I\r\nunderstand that it was not properly laid down, or has not been well\r\ntreated since. A good grazing farmer once insisted in my hearing that\r\ngrass-land should _never_ be plowed--that the vegetable mold forming the\r\nsurface, when the timber was first cut off; should remain on the surface\r\nforever. Considering how uneven the stumps and roots and cradle-knolls\r\nof a primitive forest are apt to leave the ground, I judge that this is\r\nan extreme statement. But land once thoroughly plowed and subsoiled\r\nought thereafter to be kept in grass by liberal applications of Gypsum,\r\nwell-cured Muck, and barn-yard Manure to its surface, without needing to\r\nbe plowed again and reseeded. Put back in Manure what is taken of in\r\nHay, and the Grass should hold its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nTHOROUGH TILLAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy little, hilly, rocky farm teaches lessons of thoroughness which I\r\nwould gladly impart to the boys of to-day who are destined to be the\r\nfarmers of the last quarter of this century. I am sure they will find\r\nprofit in farming better than their grandfathers did, and especially in\r\nputting their land into the best possible condition for effective\r\ntillage. There were stones in my fields varying in size from that of a\r\nbrass kettle up to that of a hay-cock--some of them raising their heads\r\nabove the surface, others burrowing just below it--which had been plowed\r\naround and over perhaps a hundred times, till I went at them with team\r\nand bar, or (where necessary) with drill and blast, turned or blew them\r\nout, and hauled them away, so that they will interfere with cultivation\r\nnevermore. I insist that this is a profitable operation--that a field\r\nwhich will not pay for such clearing should be planted with trees and\r\nthrown out of cultivation conclusively. Dodging and skulking from rock\r\nto rock is hard upon team, plow, and plowman; and it can rarely pay.\r\nLand ribbed and spotted with fast rocks will pay if judiciously planted\r\nwith Timber--possibly if well set in Fruit--but tilling it from year to\r\nyear is a thankless task; and its owner may better work by the day for\r\nhis neighbors than try to make his bread by such tillage.\r\n\r\nSo with fields soaked by springs or sodden with stagnant water. If you\r\nsay you cannot afford to drain your wet land, I respond that you can\r\nstill less afford to till it without draining. If you really cannot\r\nafford to fit it for cultivation, your next best course is to let it\r\nseverely alone.\r\n\r\nA poor man who has a rough, rugged, sterile farm, which he is unable to\r\nbring to its best possible condition at once, yet which he clings to and\r\nmust live from, should resolve that, if life and health be spared him,\r\nhe will reclaim one field each year until all that is not devoted to\r\ntimber shall have been brought into high condition. When his Summer\r\nharvest is over, and his Fall crops have received their last\r\ncultivation, there will generally be from one to two Autumn months which\r\nhe can devote mainly to this work. Let him take hold of it with resolute\r\npurpose to improve every available hour, not by running over the largest\r\npossible area, but by dealing with one field so thoroughly that it will\r\nneed no more during a long life-time. If it has stone that the plow will\r\nreach, dig them out; if it needs draining, drain it so thoroughly that\r\nit may hereafter be plowed in Spring so soon as the frost leaves it; and\r\nnow let soil and subsoil be so loosened and pulverized that roots may\r\nfreely penetrate them to a depth of fifteen to twenty inches, finding\r\nnourishment all the way, with incitement to go further if ever failing\r\nmoisture shall render this necessary. Drouth habitually shortens our\r\nFall crops from ten to fifty per cent.; it is sure to injure us more\r\ngravely as our forests are swept away by ax and fire; and, while much\r\nmay be done to mitigate its ravages by enriching the soil so as to give\r\nyour crops an early start, and a rank, luxuriant growth, the farmer's\r\nchief reliance must still be a depth of soil adequate to withstand weeks\r\nof the fiercest sunshine.\r\n\r\nI have considered what is urged as to the choice of roots to run just\r\nbeneath the surface, and it does not signify. Roots seek at once heat\r\nand moisture; if the moisture awaits them close to the surface, of\r\ncourse they mainly run there, because the heat is there greatest. If\r\nmoisture fails there, they must descend to seek it, even at the cost of\r\nfinding the heat inadequate--though heat increases and descends under\r\nthe fervid suns which rob the surface of moisture. Make the soil rich\r\nand mellow ever so far down, and you need not fear that the roots will\r\ndescend an inch lower than they should. _They_ understand their\r\nbusiness; it is _your_ sagacity that may possibly prove deficient.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the average farmer does far too little plowing--by which\r\nI mean, not that he plows too few acres, for he often plows too many,\r\nbut that he should plow oftener as well as deeper and more thoroughly.\r\nI spent three or four of my boyish Summers planting and tilling Corn and\r\nPotatoes on fields broken up just before they were planted, never\r\ncross-plowed, and of course tough and intractable throughout the season.\r\nThe yield of Corn was middling, considering the season; that of Potatoes\r\nmore than middling; yet, if those fields had been well plowed in the\r\nprevious Autumn, cross-plowed early in the Spring; and thoroughly\r\nharrowed just before planting-time, I am confident that the yield would\r\nhave been far greater, and the labor (save in harvesting) rather\r\nless--the cost of the Fall plowing being over-balanced by the saving of\r\nhalf the time necessarily given to the planting and hoeing.\r\n\r\nFall Plowing has this recommendation--it lightens labor at the busier\r\nseason, by transferring it to one of comparative dullness. I may have\r\nsaid that I consider him a good farmer who knows how to make a rainy day\r\nequally effective with one that is dry and fair; and, in the same\r\nspirit, I count him my master in this art who can make a day's work in\r\nAutumn or Winter save a day's work in Spring or Summer. Show me a farmer\r\nwho has no land plowed when May opens, and is just waking up to a\r\nconsciousness that his fences need mending and his trees want trimming,\r\nand I will guess that the sheriff will be after him before May comes\r\nround again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no superstition in the belief that land is (or may be) enriched\r\nby Fall Plowing. The Autumn gales are freighted with the more volatile\r\nelements of decaying vegetation. These, taken up wherever they are given\r\nof in excess, are wafted to and deposited in the soils best fitted for\r\ntheir reception. Regarded simply as a method of fertilizing, I do not\r\nsay that Fall Plowing is the cheapest; I _do_ say that any poor field,\r\nif well plowed in the Fall, will be in better heart the next Spring, for\r\nwhat wind and rain will meantime have deposited thereon. Frost, too, in\r\nany region where the ground freezes, and especially where it freezes and\r\nthaws repeatedly, plays an important and beneficial part in aerating and\r\npulverizing a freshly plowed soil, especially one thrown up into ridges,\r\nso as to be most thoroughly exposed to the action of the more volatile\r\nelements. The farmer who has a good team may profitably keep the plow\r\nrunning in Autumn until every rood that he means to till next season has\r\nbeen thoroughly pulverized.\r\n\r\nIn this section, our minute chequer-work of fences operates to obstruct\r\nand impede Plowing. Our predecessors wished to clear their fields, at\r\nleast superficially, of the loose, troublesome bowlders of granite\r\nwherewith they were so thickly sown; they mistakenly fancied that they\r\ncould lighten their own toil by sending their cattle to graze, browse,\r\nand gnaw, wherever a crop was not actually on the ground; so they fenced\r\ntheir farms into patches of two or ten acres, and thought they had\r\nthereby increased their value! That was a sad miscalculation. Weeds,\r\nbriars and bushes were sheltered, and nourished by these walls;\r\nweasels, rats and other destructive animals, found protection and\r\nimpunity therein; a wide belt on either side was made useless or worse;\r\nwhile Plowing was rendered laborious, difficult, and inefficient, by the\r\nnecessity of turning after every few hundred steps. We are growing\r\nslowly wiser, and burying a part of these walls, or building them into\r\nconcrete barns or other useful structures; but they are still far too\r\nplentiful, and need to be dealt with more sternly. O squatter on a wide\r\nprairie, on the bleak Plains, or in a broad Pacific valley, where wood\r\nmust be hauled for miles and loose stone are rarely visible, thank God\r\nfor the benignant dispensation which has precluded you from half\r\nspoiling your farm by a multiplicity of obstructing, deforming, fences,\r\nand so left its soil free and open to be everywhere pervaded, loosened,\r\npermeated, by the renovating Plow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS--GYPSUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrices vary so widely in different localities that no fertilizer can be\r\npronounced everywhere cheapest or best worth buying; and yet I doubt\r\nthat there is a rood of our country's surface in fit condition to be\r\ncultivated to which Gypsum (Plaster of Paris) might not be applied with\r\nprofit. Where it costs $10 or over per tun, I would apply it\r\nsparingly--say, one bushel per acre--while I judge three bushels per\r\nacre none too much in regions where it may be bought much cheaper. Even\r\nthe poor man who has but one cow, should buy a barrel of it, and dust\r\nhis stable therewith after cleaning it each day. He who has a stock of\r\ncattle should never be without it, and should freely use it, alike in\r\nstable and yard, to keep down the noisome odors, and thus retain the\r\nvolatile elements of the manure. Every meadow, every pasture, should be\r\nsown with it at least triennially; where it is abundant and cheap, as in\r\nCentral New-York, I would apply it each year, unless careful observation\r\nshould satisfy me that it no longer subserved a good purpose.\r\n\r\nAs to the _time_ of application, while I judge any season will do, my\r\npresent impression is that it will do most good if applied when the\r\nSummer is hottest and the ground driest. If, for instance, you close\r\nyour haying in mid-Summer, having been hurried by the rapid ripening of\r\nthe grass, and find your meadows baked and cracked by the intense heat,\r\nI reckon that you may proceed to dust those meadows with Gypsum with a\r\nmoral certainty that none of it will be wasted. So if your Corn and\r\nother Fall crops are suffering from and likely to be stunted by drouth,\r\nI advise the application of Gypsum broadcast, as evenly as may be and as\r\nbounteously as its price and your means will allow. I do not believe it\r\nso well to apply it specially to the growing stalks, a spoon-full or so\r\nper hill; and I doubt that it is ever judicious to plant it _in_ the\r\nhill with the seed. The readiest and quickest mode of application is\r\nalso, I believe, the best.\r\n\r\n_How_ Gypsum impels and invigorates vegetable growth, I do not pretend\r\nto know; but that it _does_ so was demonstrated by Nature long before\r\nMan took the hint that she freely gave. The city of Paris and a\r\nconsiderable adjacent district rest on a bed of Gypsum, ranging from\r\nfive to twenty feet below the surface, and considerably decomposed in\r\nits upper portion by the action of water. This region produces Wheat\r\nmost luxuriantly, and I presume has done so from time immemorial. At\r\nlength it crawled through the hair of the tillers of this soil that the\r\nsubstance which did so much good fortuitously, and (as it were) because\r\nit could not do otherwise, might do still more if applied to the soil,\r\nwith deliberate intent to test its value as a fertilizer. The result we\r\nall understand.\r\n\r\nGypsum is a chemical compound of Sulphur and Lime--so much is agreed;\r\nand the theory of chemists has been that; as the winds pass over a\r\nsurface sown with it, the Ammonia which has been exhaled by a thousand\r\nbarn-yards, bogs, &c., having a stronger affinity for Sulphur than Lime\r\nhas, dissolves the Gypsum, combines with the Sulphur, forming a Sulphate\r\nof Ammonia, and leaves the Lime to get on as it may. I accept this\r\ntheory, having no reason to distrust it; and, knowing that Sulphate of\r\nAmmonia is a powerful stimulant of vegetable growth (as any one may be\r\nassured by buying a little of it from some druggist and making the\r\nnecessary application), I can readily see how the desired result _might_\r\nin this way be produced. For our purpose, however, let it suffice that\r\n_it is_ produced, of which almost any one may be convinced by sowing\r\nwith Gypsum and passing by alternate strips or belts of the same clover\r\nfield. I suspect that not many fertilizers repay their cost out of the\r\nfirst crop; but I account Gypsum one of them; and I submit that no\r\nfarmer can afford not to try it. That its good effect is diminished by\r\nmany and frequent applications, is highly probable; but there is no hill\r\nor slope to which Gypsum has never yet been applied which ought not to\r\nmake its acquaintance this very year. I am confident that there are\r\npastures which might be made to increase their yield of Grass one-third\r\nby a moderate dressing of it.\r\n\r\nI have heard Andrew B. Dickinson, late of Steuben County, and one of the\r\nbest unscientific, unlearned farmers ever produced by our State,\r\nmaintain that he can not only enrich his own farm but impoverish his\r\nneighbors' by the free use of Gypsum on his woodless hills. The\r\nchemist's explanation of this effect is above indicated. The plastered\r\nland attracts and absorbs not only its own fair proportion of the\r\nbreeze-borne Ammonia, but much that, if the equilibrium had not been\r\ndisturbed by such application, would have been deposited on the adjacent\r\nhills. As Mr. D. makes not the smallest pretensions to science, the\r\ncoincidence between his dictum and the chemist's theory is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nNow that our country is completely gridironed with Canals and Railroads,\r\nbringing whatever has a mercantile value very near every one's door, I\r\nsuggest that no township should go without Gypsum. Five dollars will buy\r\nat least two barrels of it almost anywhere; and two barrels may be sown\r\nover five or six acres. Let it be sown so that its effect (or\r\nnon-effect) may be palpable; give it a fair, careful trial, and await\r\nthe result. If it seem to subserve no good purpose, be not too swift to\r\nenter up judgment; but buy two barrels more, vary your time and method\r\nof application, and try again. If the result be still null, let it be\r\ngiven up that Gypsum is not the fertilizer needed just there--that some\r\nill-understood peculiarity of soil or climate renders it there\r\nineffective. Then let its use be there abandoned; but it will still\r\nremain true that, in many localities and in countless instances, Gypsum\r\nhas been fully proved one of the best and cheapest commercial\r\nfertilizers known to mankind.\r\n\r\nI never tried, but on the strength of others' testimony believe in the\r\nimprovement of soils by means of calcined clay or earth. Mr. Andrew B.\r\nDickinson showed me where he had, during a dry Autumn plowed up the\r\nroad-sides through his farm, started fires with a few roots or sticks,\r\nand then piled on sods of the upturned clay and grass-roots till the\r\nfire was nearly smothered, when each heap smoked and smouldered like a\r\nlittle coal-pit till all of it that was combustible was reduced to\r\nashes, when ashes and burned clay were shoveled into a cart and strewn\r\nover his fields, to the decided improvement of their crops. Whoever has\r\na clay sod to plow up, and is deficient in manure, may repeat this\r\nexperiment with a moral certainty of liberal returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nALKALIS ... SALT--ASHES--LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know a rood of our country's surface so rich in _all_ the\r\nmaterials which enter into the production of the Grains, Grasses,\r\nFruits, and Vegetables, which are the objects and rewards of\r\ncultivation, that it could not be improved by the application of\r\nfertilizers; if there be such, I heartily congratulate the owners, and\r\nadvise them not to sell. Nor do I believe that there are many acres so\r\nfertile that they would not produce more Indian Corn, more Hemp, more\r\nCotton, and more of whatever may be their appropriate staple, if\r\njudiciously fertilized. If there be farms or fields originally so good\r\nthat manure would not increase their yield, I am confident that the\r\nfirst half-dozen crops will have taken that conceit out of them.\r\nPrairies and river-bottoms may yield ever so bounteously; but that very\r\nluxuriance of growth insures their gradual exhaustion of certain\r\nelements of crops, which must needs be replaced or their product will\r\ndwindle. Whoever has sold a thousand bushels of grain, or its equivalent\r\nin meat, from his farm, has thereby impoverished that farm, unless he\r\nhas applied something that balances its loss. \"I perceive that virtue\r\nhas gone out of me,\" observed the Saviour, because the hem of his\r\ngarment had been touched; and every field that had been cropped might\r\nmake a similar report whenever its annual loss by abstraction has not\r\nbeen balanced by some kind of fertilizer. The farmer who grows the\r\nlargest crops is the most merciless exhauster of the soil, unless he\r\nbalances his annual drafts (as good farmers rarely fail to do) by at\r\nleast equal reenforcements of the productive capacity of his fields.\r\n\r\nThe good farmer begins by inquiring, \"Wherein was my soil originally\r\ndeficient? and of what has it been exhausted by subsequent crops?\" I\r\njudge that my gravelly hill-sides would reward the application of two\r\nhundred loads (or tuns) of pure clay per acre, as I think the clay flats\r\nwhich border Lake Champlain would pay for a like application of sand or\r\nfine gravel where that material is found in convenient proximity; and\r\nyet, I know very well that, on at least three-fourths of our country's\r\narea, such application would cost far more than it would be worth. Every\r\nfarmer must act on his knowledge of his soil and its peculiar needs, and\r\nnot blindly follow the dictum of another. Yet I know few farms which,\r\nwere they mine, I would not consider enhanced in value by a vigorous\r\napplication of _some_ alkaline substance--Lime, Salt, Ashes, or some of\r\nthe cheaper Nitrates. I should be very glad to apply one thousand\r\nbushels of good house-made, hard-wood Ashes to my twenty acres of\r\narable upland, if I could buy them, delivered, at twenty five cents per\r\nbushel; but they are not to be had. I doubt that there are a hundred\r\nacres of warm, dry, gravelly or sandy soil east of the Alleghanies that\r\nwould not amply reward a similar application. But Ashes in quantity are\r\nunattainable, since no good farmer sells them, and Coal is the chief\r\nfuel of cities and villages. The Marls of New-Jersey I judge fully equal\r\nin average value to Ashes which have been nearly deprived of their\r\npotash by leaching, but not quite half equal, bushel for bushel, to\r\n_un_leached Ashes. I judge that average Marl is worth 10 cents per\r\nbushel where Ashes may be had for 25. But Marl is found only in a few\r\nlocalities, and a material worth but 10 cents per bushel will not bear\r\ntransportation beyond 40 miles by wagon or 200 by water. Salt is only\r\nfound or made at a few points, and is too dear for general use as a\r\nfertilizer. Where the refuse product of Salt-Works can be cheaply\r\nbought, good farmers will eagerly compete for it, if their lands at all\r\nresemble mine. I judge the tun of Potash I ordered fifteen years ago\r\nfrom Syracuse, paying $50 and transportation, was the cheapest\r\nfertilizer I ever bought. It was so impregnated with Salt (from the\r\nboiling over of the salt-kettles into the ashes) as to be worthless for\r\nother than agricultural purposes; but I mixed it with a large pile of\r\nMuck that I had recently dug, and, six or eight months thereafter,\r\napplied the product to a very poor, gravelly hill-side which I had just\r\nbroken up; and the immediate result was a noble crop of Corn. That\r\nhill-side has not yet forgotten the application.\r\n\r\n--If I should try to explain just how and why Lime is a fertilizer, I\r\nshould probably fail; and I am well assured that liming has in some\r\ncases been overdone; yet I think most observers will concur in my\r\nstatement that _any region which has been limed year after year produces\r\ncrops of noticeable excellence_. I cite as examples Chester and\r\nLancaster Counties, Pennsylvania, with Stark and adjacent counties of\r\nOhio. Possibly, results equally gratifying might be secured by applying\r\nsome other substance; I only _know_ that frequently limed lands are\r\ngenerally good lands, as their crops do testify. I heartily wish that\r\nthe flat clay intervales of Western Vermont could have a fair trial of\r\nthe virtues of liming. I should expect to see them thereby rendered\r\nfriable and arable; no longer changing speedily from the semblance of\r\ntar to that of brick, but readily plowed and tilled, and yielding\r\nliberally of Grain as well as Grass. I am confident that most farms in\r\nour country will pay for liming to the extent of fifty bushels per acre\r\nwhere the cost of quick-lime does not exceed ten cents per bushel; and\r\nmost farmers, by taking, hot from the kiln, the refuse lime that is\r\ndeemed unfit for building purposes, can obtain it cheaper than that.\r\n\r\nI wish some farmer who gives constant personal attention to his work--as\r\nI cannot--would make some careful tests of the practical value of\r\nalkalis. For instance: the abundance and tenacity of our common sorrel\r\nis supposed to indicate an acid condition of the soil; and all who have\r\ntried it know that sorrel is hard to kill by cultivation. I suggest that\r\nwhoever is troubled with it should cover two square rods with one bushel\r\nof quick-lime just after plowing and harrowing this Spring; then apply\r\nanother bushel to _four_ square rods adjacent; then make similar\r\napplications of ashes to two and four square rods respectively, taking\r\ncareful note of the boundaries of each patch, and leaving the rest of\r\nthe field destitute of either application. I will not anticipate the\r\nresult: more than one year may be required to evolve it; but I am\r\nconfident that a few such experiments would supply data whereof I am in\r\nneed; and there are doubtless others whose ignorance is nearly equal to\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nMany have applied Lime to their fields without realizing any advantage\r\ntherefrom. In some cases, there was already a sufficiency of this\r\ningredient in the soil, and the application of more was one of those\r\nmany wasteful blunders induced by our ignorance of Chemistry. But much\r\nLime is naturally adulterated with other minerals, especially with\r\nManganese, so that its application to most if not to all soils subserves\r\nno good end. In the absence of exact, scientific knowledge, I would buy\r\nfifty bushels of quick-lime, apply them to one acre running through a\r\nfield, and watch the effect. If it doesn't pay, you have a bad article,\r\nor your soil is not deficient in Lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nSOILS AND FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA farmer is a manufacturer of articles wherefrom mankind are fed and\r\nclad; his raw materials are the soil and the various substances he\r\nmingles therewith or adds thereto in order to increase its productive\r\ncapacity. His art consists in transforming by cultivation crude,\r\ncomparatively worthless, and even noxious, offensive materials into\r\nsubstances grateful to the senses, nourishing to the body, and sometimes\r\ninvigorating, even strengthening, to the mind.\r\n\r\nI have heard of lands that were naturally rich enough; I never was so\r\nlucky or perchance so discerning as to find them. Yet I have seen\r\nIllinois bottoms whereof I was assured that the soil was fully sixteen\r\nfeet deep, and a rich, black alluvium from top to bottom; and I do not\r\nquestion the statements made to me from personal observation that\r\nportions of the strongly alkaline plain or swale on which Salt Lake City\r\nis built, being for the first time plowed, irrigated, and sown to Wheat,\r\nyielded ninety bushels of good grain per acre. I never saw, yet on\r\nevidence believe, that pioneer settlers of the Miami Valley, wishing,\r\nsome years after settling there, to sell their farms, advertised them as\r\npeculiarly desirable in that the barns stood over a creek or \"branch,\"\r\nwhich swept away the manure each Winter or Spring without trouble to the\r\nowner; and I have myself grown both Wheat and Oats that were very rank\r\nand heavy in straw, yet which fell so flat and lay so dead that the\r\nheads scarcely bore a kernel. Had I been a wiser, better farmer, I\r\nshould have known how to stiffen the straw and make it do its office, in\r\nspite of wind and storm.\r\n\r\n[And let me here say, lest I forget it in its appropriate place, that I\r\nam confident that most farmers sow grain too thickly for any but very\r\npoor land. If one thinks it necessary to scatter three bushels of Oats\r\nper acre, I tell him that he should apply more manure and less\r\nseed--that land which requires three bushels of seed is not rich enough\r\nto bear Oats. He might better concentrate his manure on half so much\r\nland, and save two-thirds of his seed.]\r\n\r\nI do not hold that the remarkably rich soils I have instanced needed\r\nfertilizing when first plowed; I will presume that they did not. Yet,\r\nhaving never yet succeeded in manuring a corn-field so high that a few\r\nloads more would not (I judge) have increased the crop, I doubt whether\r\neven the richest Illinois bottoms would not yield more Corn, year by\r\nyear, if reenforced with the contents of a good barn-yard. And, when the\r\nfirst heavy crop of Corn has been taken from a field, that field--no\r\nmatter how deep and fertile its soil--is less rich in corn-forming\r\nelements than it was before. Just so sure as that there is no depletion\r\nor shrinkage when nothing is taken from nothing, so sure is it that\r\nsomething cannot be taken from something without diminishing its\r\ncapacity to yield something at the next call. Rotation of crops is an\r\nexcellent plan; for one may flourish on that which another has rejected;\r\nbut this does not overbear Nature's inflexible exaction of so much for\r\nso much. Hence, if there ever was a field so rich that nothing could be\r\nadded that would increase its productive capacity, the first exacting\r\ncrop thereafter taken from it diminished that capacity, and rendered a\r\nfresh application of some fertilizer desirable.\r\n\r\nYears ago, a Western man exhibited at our Farmers' Club a specimen of\r\nthe soil of his region which was justly deemed very rich, taken from a\r\nfield whereon Corn had been repeatedly grown without apparent\r\nexhaustion. A chemical analysis had been made of it, which was submitted\r\nwith the soil. It was claimed that nothing could improve its capacity\r\nfor producing the great Illinois staple. Prof. Mapes dissented from this\r\nconclusion. \"This soil,\" said he, \"while very rich in nearly every\r\nelement which enters into the composition of Corn, gives barely a trace\r\nof Chlorine, the base of Salt. Hence, if five bushels per acre of Salt\r\nbe applied to that field, and it does not thereupon yield five bushels\r\nmore per annum of Corn, I will agree to eat the field.\"\r\n\r\nMany men fertilize their poor lands only, supposing that the better can\r\ndo without. I judge that to be a mistake. My rule would be to plant the\r\npoorest with such choice trees as thrive without manure, and pile the\r\nfertilizers upon the better. It seems to me plain that of two fields,\r\none of which has a soil containing nine-tenths of the elements of the\r\ndesired crop, while the other shows but one to three-tenths, it is a\r\nmore hopeful and less thankless task to enrich the former than the\r\nlatter. If you are required to supply to a field nearly everything that\r\nyour proposed crop will withdraw from it, I do not see where the profit\r\ncomes in; but if you are required to supply but a tenth, because the\r\nsoil as you found it stood ready to contribute the remaining\r\nnine-tenths, it seems to me that the margin for profit is here decidedly\r\nthe greater.\r\n\r\nHow many tuns of earth ought a farmer to be obliged to turn over and\r\nover in order to obtain therefrom a hundred bushels of Corn? Two\r\nhundred? Five hundred? A thousand? _Five_ thousand? Other things being\r\nequal, no one will doubt that, if he can make the Corn from one hundred\r\ntuns of soil, it were better to do so than to employ five hundred or\r\nfive thousand. It seems clear to my mind that, though other conditions\r\nbe unequal, it is generally well to endeavor to produce the required\r\nquantity from the smaller rather than the larger area.\r\n\r\nI fully share the average farmer's partiality for barn-yard manure in\r\npreference to most, if not all, commercial fertilizers. In my judgment,\r\nalmost any farmer who has cattle, with fit shelter and Winter fodder,\r\ncan make fertilizers far cheaper than he can buy them. I judge that\r\nalmost every farmer who has paid $100 or over for Guano (for instance),\r\nmight have more considerably enriched his farm by drawing muck from some\r\nconvenient bog or pond into his barn-yard in August or September and\r\ncarting it thence to his fields the next Fall. If he can get no muck\r\nwithin a mile, let him cut, when they are in blossom, all the weeds that\r\ngrow near him, especially by the road-side, cart them at once into his\r\nbarn-yard, and there convert them into fertilizers. In Autumn, replace\r\nthe hay-rack on the wagon or cart, and pile load after load of\r\nfreshly-fallen leaves into your yard; taking them, if you may, from the\r\nsides of roads and fences, and from any place where they may have been\r\nlodged or heaped by the winds, your own wood-lot excepted. Plow the turf\r\noff of any scurvy lot or road-side, and pile it into the barn-yard; nay,\r\ndig a hundred loads of pure clay, and place it there, if you can get it\r\nat a small expense, and your average soil is gravelly or sandy. The\r\nfarmer who is unable or reluctant to buy commercial fertilizers should\r\napply his whole force every Autumn to replenishing his barn-yard with\r\nthat material which he can obtain most easily which the trampling of his\r\ncattle may readily convert into manure. A month is too little, two\r\nmonths would not be too much, to devote to this good work. Some may seem\r\nobliged to postpone it to Winter; but that is to run the risk of\r\nembarrassment by frost or snow, and encounter the certainty that your\r\nmaterial will be inferior in quality, or not so well fitted to apply to\r\ngrain-crops the ensuing Fall.\r\n\r\n--All this, you may say, is not instruction. We ought to know exactly\r\nwhat lands are enriched by Gypsum, and what, if any, are not; why these\r\nare fertilized, why those are not, by a common application; how great is\r\nthe profit of such application in any case; and what substitute can most\r\nnearly subserve the same ends where Gypsum is not to be had. I admit all\r\nyou claim, and do not doubt that there shall yet be a Scientific\r\nAgriculture that will fully answer your requirements. As yet, however,\r\nit exists but in suggestions and fragments; and attempts to complete it\r\nby naked assertions and sweeping generalizations tend rather to mislead\r\nand disgust the young farmer than really to enlighten and guide him. At\r\nall events, I shall aim to set forth as true no more than I know, or\r\nwith good reason confidently believe.\r\n\r\nI close by reiterating my belief that no farmer ever yet impoverished\r\nhimself by making too much manure or by applying too much of his own\r\nmanufacture. I cannot speak so confidently of _buying_ commercial\r\nfertilizers; but these I will discuss in my next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nBONES--PHOSPHATES--GUANO.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hate to check improvement or chill the glow of Faith; yet I do so\r\nkeenly apprehend that many of our people, especially among the Southern\r\ncotton-growers, are squandering money on Commercial Fertilizers, that I\r\nam bound to utter my note of warning, even though it should pass wholly\r\nunheeded. Let me make my position as clear as I can.\r\n\r\nI live in a section which has been cultivated for more than two\r\ncenturies, while its proximity to a great city has tempted to crop it\r\nincessantly, exhaustively. Wheat while its original surface soil of six\r\nto twelve inches of vegetable mold (mainly composed of decayed\r\nforest-leaves) remained; then Corn and Oats; at length, Milk, Beef, and\r\nApples--have exhausted the hill-sides and gentler slopes of Westchester\r\nCounty, except where they have been kept in heart by judicious culture\r\nand liberal fertilizing; and, even here, that subtle element,\r\nPhosphorus, which enters minutely but necessarily into the composition\r\nof every animal and nearly every vegetable structure has been gradually\r\ndrawn away in Grain, in Milk, in Bones, and not restored to the soil by\r\nthe application of ordinary manures. I am convinced that a field may be\r\nso manured as to give three tuns of Hay per acre, yet so destitute of\r\nPhosphorus that a sound, healthy animal cannot be grown therefrom. For\r\ntwo centuries, the tillers of Westchester County knew nothing of\r\nChemistry or Phosphorus, and allowed the unvalued bones of their animals\r\nto be exported to fatten British meadows, without an effort to retain\r\nthem. Hence, it has become absolutely essential that we buy and apply\r\nPhosphates, even though the price be high; for our land can no longer do\r\nwithout them. Wherever a steer or heifer can occasionally be caught\r\ngnawing or mumbling over an old bone, there Phosphates are\r\nindispensable, no matter at what cost. Better pay $100 per tun for a\r\ndressing of one hundred pounds of Bone per acre than try to do without.\r\n\r\nBut no lands recently brought into cultivation--no lands where the bones\r\nof the animals fed thereon have been allowed, for unnumbered years past,\r\nto mingle with the soil--can be equally hungry for Phosphates; and I\r\ndoubt that any cotton-field in the South will ever return an outlay of\r\neven $50 per tun for any Phosphatic fertilizer whatever. That _any_\r\npreparation of Bone, or whereof Bone is a principal element, will\r\nincrease the succeeding crops, is undoubted; but that it will ever\r\nreturn its cost and a decent margin of profit, is yet to be demonstrated\r\nto my satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, there are special cases in which the application even of\r\nPeruvian Guano at $90 per tun is advisable. A compost of Muck, Lime,\r\n&c., equally efficient, might be far cheaper; but months would be\r\nrequired to prepare and perfect it, and meantime the farmer would lose\r\nhis crop, or fail to make one. If a tun of Guano, or of some expensive\r\nPhosphate, will give him six or eight acres of Clover where he would\r\notherwise have little or none, and he needs that Clover to feed the team\r\nwherewith he is breaking up and fitting his farm to grow a good crop\r\nnext year, he may wisely make the purchase and application, even though\r\nhe may be able to compost for next year's use twice the value of\r\nfertilizers for the precise cost of this. But I am so thorough in my\r\ndevotion to \"home industry,\" that I hold him an unskillful farmer who\r\ncannot, nine times in ten, make, mainly from materials to be found on or\r\nnear his farm, a pile of compost for $100 that will add more to the\r\nenduring fertility of his farm than anything he can bring from a\r\ndistance at a cost of $150.\r\n\r\nUnderstand that this is a general rule, and subject, like all general\r\nrules, to exceptions. Gypsum, I think every farmer should buy; Lime\r\nalso, if his soil needs it; Phosphates in some shape, if past ignorance\r\nor folly has allowed that soil to be despoiled of them; Wood Ashes, if\r\nany one can be found so brainless as to sell them; Marl, of course,\r\nwhere it is found within ten miles; Guano very rarely, and mainly when\r\nsomething is needed to make a crop before coarser and colder\r\nfertilizers can be brought into a condition of fitness for use; but the\r\ngeneral rule I insist on is this: A good farmer will, in the course of\r\ntwenty or thirty years, make at least $10 worth of fertilizers for every\r\ndollar's worth he buys from any dealer, unless it be the sweepings or\r\nother excretions of some not distant city.\r\n\r\nI have used Guano frequently, and, though it has generally made its\r\nmark, I never yet felt sure that it returned me a profit over its cost.\r\nPhosphates have done better, especially where applied to Corn in the\r\nhill, either at the time of planting or later; yet my strong impression\r\nis that Flour of Bone, applied broadcast and freely, especially when\r\nWheat or Oats are sown on a field that is to be laid down to Grass, pays\r\nbetter and more surely than anything else I order from the City, Gypsum,\r\nand possibly Oyster-Shell Lime, excepted.\r\n\r\nMy experience can be no safe guide for others, since it is not proved\r\nthat the anterior condition and needs of their soils are precisely like\r\nthose of mine. I apprehend that Guano has not had a fair trial on my\r\nplace--that carelessness in pulverizing or in application has caused it\r\nto \"waste its sweetness on the desert air,\" or that a drouth following\r\nits application has prevented the due development of its virtues. And\r\nstill my impression that Guano is the brandy of vegetation, supplying to\r\nplants stimulus rather than nutrition, is so clear and strong that it\r\nmay not easily be effaced. It seems to me plainly absurd to send ten\r\nthousand miles for this stimulant, when this or any other great city\r\nannually poisons its own atmosphere and the adjacent waters with\r\nexcretions which are of very similar character and value, and which\r\nScience and Capital might combine to utilize at less than half the cost\r\nof like elements in the form of Guano.\r\n\r\nMy object in this paper is to incite experiment and careful observation.\r\nNo farmer should absolutely trust aught but his own senses. A Rhode\r\nIslander once assured me that he applied to four acres of thin, slaty\r\ngravel one hundred pounds per acre of Nitrate of Soda which cost him $4\r\nper hundred, and obtained therefrom four additional tuns of good Hay,\r\nworth $15 per tun: Net profit (after allowing for the cost of making the\r\nHay), say $30. He might not be so fortunate on a second trial, and there\r\nmay not be another four acres of the earth's surface where Nitrate of\r\nSoda would do so well; but, should I ever have a fair opportunity, I\r\nmean to see what a little of that Nitrate will do for _me_. And I hope\r\nfarmers may more and more be induced to conform in practice to the\r\nApostolic precept, \"Prove all things: Hold fast that which is good.\" No\r\none's success or failure in a particular instance should be conclusive\r\nwith others, because of the infinite diversity of antecedent and\r\nattendant circumstances; but if every thrifty farmer would give to each\r\nof the commercial fertilizers--Lime, Gypsum, Guano, Raw Bone,\r\nPhosphates, Ashes, Salt, Marl, etc.--such a careful trial as he might,\r\nobserving closely and recording carefully the results, we should soon\r\nhave a mass of facts and results, wherefrom deductions might be drawn of\r\nsignal practical value to the present and to future generations.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that great results of signal beneficence are to be\r\nslowly but surely achieved by means of the household convenience known\r\nas the Earth-Closet, and by kindred devices for rendering inoffensive\r\nand utilizing the most powerful fertilizer produced on every farm and in\r\nevery household. That is a vulgar squeamishness which leaves it to\r\npoison the atmosphere and offend the senses on the assumption that it is\r\ntoo noisome to be dealt with or utilized. A true refinement counsels\r\nthat it be daily covered, and its odor absorbed or suppressed by earth,\r\nor muck, or ashes, and thus prepared for removal to and incorporation\r\nwith the soil. It is far within the truth to estimate our National loss\r\nby the waste of this material at $1 per head, or $40,000,000 in all per\r\nannum: a waste which is steadily diminishing the productive capacity of\r\nour soil. This cannot, must not, be allowed to continue. We must devise\r\nor adopt _some_ mode of securing and applying this powerful fertilizer;\r\nand I defer to that which is already in extensive and daily expanding\r\nuse. Let whoever can do better; but meantime let us welcome and diffuse\r\nthe Earth Closet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nMUCK--HOW TO UTILIZE IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time will be, I cannot doubt, when chemists can tell us the exact\r\npositive or relative value of a cord of Muck--how this swamp or that\r\npond affords a choice article, while the product of another will hardly\r\npay for digging. There may be chemists whose judgment on these points is\r\nnow worth far more than mine, since mine is worth exactly nothing. I\r\n_do_ know, however, that Muck is a valuable fertilizer, and that digging\r\nand composting it _does pay_. I judge that I have transferred at least\r\nthree thousand loads of it from my swamp to my upland; and the effect\r\nhad been all that I expected. Let me speak of Muck generally, in the\r\nlight, of my own experience.\r\n\r\nWherever rocks in ridges come to the surface of a valley, plain, or\r\ngentle slope, water is apt to be collected or retained by them, forming\r\nponds or shallower pools, which may or may not dry up in Summer, but\r\nwhich are seldom dry late in Autumn, when plants are dying and leaves\r\nare falling. The latter, caught in their descent by the harsh winds of\r\nthe season, are swept along the bare, dry ground, till they strike the\r\nwater, which arrests their progress and soon engulfs them. Thus an acre\r\nof watery surface will often collect, and retain the dead foliage of\r\nfive to ten acres of forest; and next Fall will render its kindred\r\ntribute, and the next, and the next, for ever. There cannot be less than\r\nfifty millions of acres of Swamps in our old States (including Maine);\r\nwhereof I presume the larger area was covered with water until the slow\r\ncontributions of leaves and weeds filled them above the level at which\r\nwater is no longer retained on the surface. And still, they are so moist\r\nand boggy, and their rank vegetation is so retentive, that the leaves\r\nswept in from the adjacent hills and glades are firmly retained and aid\r\nto increase the depth of their vegetable mold, which varies from a few\r\ninches to twenty and even thirty feet. In my old County of Westchester,\r\nI roughly estimate that there are at least five thousand acres of bog,\r\nwhereof but a very few hundreds have yet been subdued to the uses of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nWhoever digs a quantity of Swamp Muck and applies it _directly_ to his\r\nfields or garden, will derive little or no immediate benefit therefrom.\r\nIt is green, sour, cold, and more likely to cover his farm thickly and\r\npersistently with Sorrel, Eye-smart, Rag-weed, Parsley, and other\r\ninfestations, than to add a bushel per acre to his crop of Grain or\r\nRoots. And thus many have tried Muck, and, on trial, pronounced it a\r\npestilent humbug.\r\n\r\nBut let any farmer turn his whole force into a bog or marsh directly\r\nafter finishing his Summer harvest (when it is apt to be driest and\r\nwarmest), and, having freed it of water to the best of his ability, dig\r\nand draw out one hundred cords of its black, oozy substance, and he will\r\nknow better than to unite in that hasty judgment. If the bog be near his\r\nfarm-yard, let the Muck be shoveled at once into a cart and drawn\r\nthither; but, if not, let it be simply brought out in wheel-barrows and\r\ndeposited, not more than two feet deep, on the most convenient bank that\r\nis well drained and perfectly dry. Here let it dry and drain till after\r\nFall harvest, and then begin to draw it gradually into the yards, and\r\nespecially where it may be worked over by swine and scratched over for\r\nseeds and insects by fowls. Assuming that the farm-yard is lowest in the\r\ncentre and allows no liquid to escape save by evaporation, the Muck may\r\nwell be dumped on the drier sides; thence, after being worked over and\r\ntrampled through and through, to be shoveled into the centre and\r\nreplaced by fresh arrivals. A hundred cords may thus be so mixed and\r\nripened as to be fit to draw out next May and used as a fertilizer for\r\nGrain or Roots, though, if not so treated, it should lie exposed to sun\r\nand wind a full year; being applied in the Fall to crops of Winter grain\r\nor spread upon the fields to be planted or sowed next Spring. All the\r\nmanure made during the Winter should be spread over that which lies in\r\nthe yard at least monthly; and then new Muck drawn in, to be rooted or\r\nscratched over, trampled into the underlying strata, and overspread in\r\nits turn. Thus treated, I am confident that each hundred cords of Muck\r\nwill be equal in value to an equal quantity of manure, though it may not\r\ngive up its fertilizing properties so freely to the first crop that\r\nfollows its application. I have land that did not yield (in pasture) the\r\nequivalent of half a tun of hay pet annum when I bought it, that now\r\nyields at least three tuns of good hay per annum; and its renovation is\r\nmainly due to a free application of Swamp Muck.\r\n\r\nTo those who have a good stock of animals, with Muck convenient to their\r\nyards, I would not recommend any other treatment than the foregoing; but\r\nthere are many who keep few animals, or whose muck-beds lie at the back\r\nof their farms, two or three hundred rods from their barns; while they\r\nwish to fertilize the fields in this quarter, which have been slighted\r\nin former applications, because of the distance over which manure had to\r\nbe hauled. If these possess or can buy good hard-wood, house-made Ashes\r\nat twenty-five cents or less per bushel, I would say, Mix these well, at\r\nthe rate of two or three bushels to the card, with your Muck as you dig\r\nit; work it over the next Spring, and apply it the ensuing Fall, so as\r\nto give it a full year to ripen and sweeten, and it will be all right.\r\nBut, if you have not and cannot get the Ashes, and _can_ procure dirty,\r\nrefuse Salt from some meat-packer or wholesale grocer, apply this as you\r\nwould have applied the Ashes, but in rather larger quantity; and, if\r\nyou can get neither Ashes nor Salt, use quick Lime, as fresh and hot\r\nfrom the kiln as you can apply it. The best Lime is that from burned\r\nOyster-Shells; I consider this, if nowise slaked, nearly equal to refuse\r\nSalt; but Oyster-Shell Lime is too dear at most inland points; and here\r\nthe refuse of the kilns--that which is not good enough for\r\nmason-work--must be used. Usually, the lime-burner has a load or more of\r\nthis at the clearing out of every kiln, which he will sell quite cheap\r\nif it be taken out of his way at once; and this should be looked for and\r\nsecured. Being inferior in quality (often because imperfectly burned),\r\nit should be applied in larger quantity--not less than four bushels to\r\neach cord of Muck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will not here describe the process of mixing Salt with Lime commended\r\nby Prof. Mapes, because it is not easy to bring these two ingredients\r\ntogether so as to mix them with the Muck as it is dug: and, though I\r\nhave used them after Prof. Mapes's recipe, and purpose to do so\r\nhereafter, I do not feel certain that any positive advantage results\r\nfrom their blended application as a Chloride of Lime. If I should gain\r\nfurther light on this point before completing this series, I shall not\r\nfail to impart it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nINSECTS--BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were to estimate the average absolute loss of the farmers of this\r\ncountry from Insects at $100,000,000 per annum, I should doubtless be\r\nfar below the mark. The loss of fruit alone by the devastations of\r\ninsects, within a radius of fifty miles from this City, must amount in\r\nvalue to Millions. In my neighborhood, the Peach once flourished, but\r\nflourishes no more, and Cherries have been all but annihilated. Apples\r\nwere till lately our most profitable and perhaps our most important\r\nproduct; but the worms take half our average crop and sadly damage what\r\nthey do not utterly destroy. Plums we have ceased to grow or expect; our\r\nPears are generally stung and often blighted; even the Currant has at\r\nlast its fruit-destroying worm. We must fight our paltry adversaries\r\nmore efficiently, or allow them to drive us wholly from the field.\r\n\r\nNow, I have no doubt that our best allies in this inglorious warfare are\r\nthe Birds. They would save us, if we did not destroy them. The British\r\nplowman, turning his sod with a myriad of crows, blackbirds, etc.,\r\nchasing his steps and all but getting under his feet in their eager\r\nquest of grubs, bugs, etc., is a spectacle to be devoutly thankful for.\r\nWhenever clouds of birds shall habitually darken our fields in May and\r\n(less notably) throughout the Summer months, we may reasonably hope to\r\ngrow fair crops of our favorite Fruits from year to year, and realize\r\nthat we owe them to the constant, and zealous, though not quite\r\ndisinterested, efforts of our friends, the Birds.\r\n\r\nBut I do not regard the ravages of Insects as entirely due to the\r\nreckless destruction and consequent scarcity of our Birds. I hold that\r\ntheir multiplication and their devastations are largely incited by the\r\ndegeneracy of our plants caused by the badness of our culture. On this\r\npoint, consider a statement made to me, some fifteen or twenty years\r\nago, by the late Gov. William F. Packer, of Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n\"I know (said Gov. P.) the narrow valley of a stream that runs into the\r\nwest branch of the Susquehanna, which was cleared of the primitive\r\nforest some forty or fifty years since, and has ever since been\r\nalternately in tillage and grass. A road ran through the middle of it,\r\ndividing it into two narrow fields. A few years ago, this road was\r\nabandoned, and the whole of this little valley, including the road-way,\r\nthrown into a single field, which was thereupon sown to Wheat. At\r\nharvest-time, this remarkable phenomenon was presented: A good crop of\r\nsound grain on the strip four or fire rods wide formerly covered by the\r\nroad; while nearly every berry on either side of it was destroyed by the\r\nweevil or midge.\"\r\n\r\nNow I do not infer from this fact that insect ravages are _wholly_ due\r\nto our abuse and exhaustion of the soil. I presume that Wheat and other\r\ncrops would be devastated by insects if there were no slovenly, niggard,\r\nexhausting tillage. But I do firmly hold that at least half our losses\r\nby insects would be precluded if our fields were habitually kept in\r\nbetter heart by deep culture, liberal fertilizing, and a judicious\r\nrotation of crops. I heard little of insect ravages in the wheat-fields\r\nof Western New-York throughout the first thirty years of this century;\r\nbut, when crop after crop of Wheat had been taken from the same fields\r\nuntil they had been well nigh exhausted of their Wheat-forming elements,\r\nwe began to hear of the desolation wrought by insects; and those ravages\r\nincreased in magnitude until Wheat-culture had to be abandoned for\r\nyears. I believe that we should have heard little of insects had Wheat\r\nbeen grown on those fields but one year in three since their redemption\r\nfrom the primal forest.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever might once have been, the Philistines are upon us. We are\r\ndoomed, for at least a generation, to wage a relentless war against\r\ninsects multiplied beyond reason by the neglect and short-comings of our\r\npredecessors. We are in like condition with the inhabitants of the\r\nBritish isles a thousand years ago, whose forefathers had so long\r\nendured and so unskillfully resisted invasion and spoliation by the\r\nNorthmen that they had come to be regarded as the sea-kings' natural\r\nprey. For generations, it has been customary hereabout to slaughter\r\nwithout remorse the birds, and let caterpillars, worms, grasshoppers,\r\netc., multiply and ravage unresisted. We must pay for past errors by\r\npresent loss and years of extra effort. And, precisely because the task\r\nis so arduous, we ought to lose no time in addressing ourselves to its\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe first step to be taken is very simple. Let every farmer who realizes\r\nthe importance and beneficence of Birds teach his own children and\r\nhirelings that, except the Hawk, they are to be spared, protected,\r\nkindly treated, and (when necessary) fed. They are to be valued and\r\ncherished as the voluntary police of our fields and gardens, constantly\r\nemployed in fighting our battles against our ruthless foes. The boy who\r\nrobs a bird's nest is robbing the farmer of a part of his crops. He who\r\ntraverses a farm shooting and mangling its feathered sentinels\r\ndiminishes its future product of Grain and nearly destroys that of\r\nFruit. The farmer might as well consent that any strolling ruffian\r\nshould shoot his Horses or Cattle as his Birds. Begin at home to make\r\nthis truth felt and respected, and it will be the easier to impress it\r\nalso on your neighbors.\r\n\r\nNext, there should be neighborhood or township associations for the\r\nprotection of insect-eating birds. We must not merely agree to let them\r\nlive--we must cherish and protect them. I believe that very simple cups\r\nor bowls of cast-iron, having each a hole in its centre of suitable\r\nsize, that need not cost sixpence each, and could be fastened to the\r\nside of a tree with one nail lightly driven, would in time be adopted by\r\nmany birds as nesting strongholds, whence they might laugh to scorn\r\ntheir predacious enemies. If every harmless bird could build its nest\r\namong us in a place where its eggs would be safe from hawks, crows,\r\ncats, boys, and other robbers, the number of such birds would quickly be\r\ndoubled and quadrupled.\r\n\r\nAnd we must summon the law to our aid. Though law can do little or\r\nnothing against stealthy, skulking nest-plunderers, it can help us\r\nmaterially in our warfare with the cowardly vagabonds who traverse our\r\nfields with musket or rifle, blazing away at every unsuspecting robin or\r\nthrush that they can discover. Make it trespass, punishable with fine\r\nand imprisonment, to shoot on another's land without his express\r\npermission, and the cowardly massacre of the farmers' humble allies\r\nwould be checked at once, and, when public sentiment had been properly\r\nenlightened, might, in civilized regions, be arrested altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nABOUT TREE-PLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have had so little experience in Tree-Planting that I should have\r\npreferred to say no more about it; but letters that have reached me\r\nimply that the ignorance of others is even denser than mine. For the\r\nsake of those only who are conscious that they know nothing, yet are not\r\nunwilling to learn, I venture a few timid suggestions with regard to\r\nTree-Planting.\r\n\r\nI. Ten or twelve years ago, I bought a pound or more of Locust seed\r\nrather late in the Spring, scalded it by plunging for a moment the\r\nlittle cotton bag which held it into a pot of boiling water, and letting\r\nthe seed steep and steam in the bag till next morning, when the seed was\r\nplanted in rows in a newly broken bit of poor old pasture-land. This was\r\na mistake; I should have given that seed the richest available spot in\r\nmy garden, to say nothing of planting it as early as April 20th. My\r\nlocusts came up slowly and grew feebly that year, not to speak of the\r\nmany seeds that did not sprout at all. Still many came up and survived,\r\nand my place is this day the richer for them. It might have been still\r\nricher had I seasonably known more.\r\n\r\nII. What I would now advise as to Locust and most other trees is that\r\nthe best seed be procured in the Fall, or so soon as it drops from the\r\ntrees; that part of it be sown in drills, two feet apart, with two\r\ninches between seeds in the drills, and that the richest of dry, warm\r\ngarden-soil be devoted to this purpose. Fill a large box with rich loam,\r\nstir four ounces of seed into this, and set the box in a cool cellar\r\nwhere frost does not enter, and here let it remain till April; then take\r\nout the seed and earth together, and sow in drills as above. If some one\r\nwho cuts Locust during the Winter or Spring will allow you to trace the\r\nsmaller surface-roots from the new-made stumps and cut or dig them up,\r\ncut fifty or a hundred pieces of root the size of your finger each two\r\nfeet long, and plant these, about May 1, in the places where you want\r\nLocusts to come forward most rapidly. Some of them may not grow, but I\r\nthink many will; and, from all these sources, I judge that you will\r\nobtain a good supply of young trees. Let those you start from the seed\r\nget two years' growth before you take them up and set them where you\r\nwant trees, whether in your present woods, in rugged, rocky pastures, on\r\nthe sides of steep ravines, or around your buildings. You cannot fail to\r\nobtain _some_ trees if you follow these directions.\r\n\r\nIII. Begin early this Fall to gather Chestnuts, Hickory Nuts, Walnuts,\r\nWhite Oak, Acorns, etc., to plant. Select the largest and finest nuts,\r\ngiving the preference to those which ripen and fall earliest. Keep them\r\nin cool, damp earth in some barn or cellar where rats and mice cannot\r\nreach them, and persist in collecting till December. Then plant a part\r\nin your garden or in any rich ground where they are not likely to be\r\ndisturbed; letting the residue remain in the boxes of moist earth where\r\nyou first placed them till early Spring; then plant these, like the\r\nformer, in rows two feet apart, with six inches between seed and seed in\r\neach row, and give the rows careful culture for two years; after which,\r\nset them where you wish them to grow.\r\n\r\nI venture to suggest that he who has a ragged, stony hill or other lot\r\nwhich he wishes to surrender to forest should plow it, if it can be\r\nplowed, next September or October; if too rocky to be even imperfectly\r\nplowed, dig up the earth with pick and spade, and sow it thickly with\r\nhickory nuts, walnuts, chestnuts, locust and other tree-seeds, expecting\r\nthat some will be dug up and carried off by squirrels, etc., and that\r\nothers will fail to germinate. Go over it with hoes the ensuing June or\r\nJuly, killing all weeds and other infestations; and, nearly a year\r\nlater, repeat the operation, taking up young trees from your garden or\r\nnursery, and filling them in wherever there is room. Plant thickly in\r\norder to force an upward rather than a scraggy growth; and so that you\r\nmay begin to cut out the superfluous saplings for bean-poles,\r\nhoop-poles, etc., three or four years thereafter. Cut late in Winter or\r\nearly in Spring, so that the stumps will each throw up two or more\r\nshoots or sprouts, which usually grow much faster than the original tree\r\ndid. And the process of thinning may thus be continued indefinitely,\r\nwhile the choicer trees are allowed to attain their stateliest\r\nproportions. And thus a rocky, sterile hill-side or knoll may be made to\r\nyield a crop annually after the first two or three years from planting,\r\nwhile growing trees of decided value. I judge that almost any land\r\nwithin fifty miles of a great city and not more than two miles from a\r\nrailroad depot or from navigable water may thus be made to earn a good\r\ninterest on $100 per acre, after meeting all the cost of breaking up and\r\nplanting. I confidently assert that many thousands of sterile, rocky\r\nacres, which now yield less than $5 per acre annually in pasturage,\r\nwould net at least double that sum to the owner if wisely devoted to\r\nforest-trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have a hearty love of forests. They proffer gentle companionship to\r\nthe thoughtful and rest to the overworked, fevered brain. Our streams\r\nwill be fuller and less capricious, our gales less destructive, our\r\nclimate more equable, when we shall have reclothed our rugged slopes and\r\nrocky crests with trees. Timber grows yearly scarcer and dearer, when it\r\nought to be becoming more plentiful and accessible, and _would_ be if we\r\ndevoted to trees all the land which we cultivate at a loss or fail to\r\ncultivate at all. Let our boys be incited to gather seeds and plant\r\nnurseries; let young trees be bought by the thousand where they now are\r\nby the dozen, and let us all cooperate in covering our unsightly rocks\r\nand making glad our waste places by a superabundance of choice, thrifty,\r\nhealthy trees.\r\n\r\nMany of our young men have a taste for adventure and excitement which\r\nleads them to the ocean, the mines, to Australia or some other far-off\r\nland recently and scantily peopled by civilized beings. I will not\r\nquarrel with their taste; but I judge that there are openings for their\r\nenterprise and daring within the area of our own country. Let one\r\nthousand of them resolve to devote the next five years to planting\r\nforests on the treeless plains and virtual deserts of the Great Basin\r\nand on either side of it; let them select locations where some acres may\r\ncheaply and surely be irrigated, and, having carefully provided\r\nthemselves with an abundance of the best seeds, let them start patches\r\nof woodland at points the most remote from present timber, until a\r\nthousand different forests--one to each of the associates--shall have\r\nbeen started and guarded till their roots have taken firm hold of the\r\nearth. I presume Congress would grant them preemptions to each section\r\non which they thus planted at least forty acres of forest, and that most\r\nof these preemption rights could, within ten years, be sold to settlers\r\nfor many times their original cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nFRUIT-TREES--THE APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were asked to say what single aspect of our economic condition most\r\nstrikingly and favorably distinguished the people of our Northern States\r\nfrom these of most if not all other countries which I have traversed, I\r\nwould point at once to the fruit-trees which so generally diversify\r\nevery little as well as larger farm throughout these States, and are\r\nquite commonly found even on the petty holdings of the poorer mechanics\r\nand workmen in every village and in the suburbs and outskirts of every\r\ncity. I can recall nothing like it abroad, save in two or three of the\r\nleast mountainous and most fertile districts of northern Switzerland.\r\nItaly has some approach to it in the venerable olive-trees which\r\nsurround or flank many, perhaps most, of her farm-houses, upholding\r\ngrape-vines as ancient and nearly as large as themselves; but the\r\naverage New-England or Middle State homestead, with its ample\r\nApple-orchard and its cluster of Pear, Cherry and Plum-trees surrounding\r\nits house and dotting or belting its garden, has an air of comfort and\r\nmodest thrift, which I have nowhere else seen fairly equaled. Upland\r\nVirginia and the mountainous portion of the States southward of her may\r\nin time surpass the most favored regions of the North in the abundance,\r\nvariety and excellence of their fruits; for the Peach and the Grape find\r\nhere a congenial climate, while they are grown with difficulty, where\r\nthey can be grown at all, in the North; but, up to this hour, I judge\r\nthat our country north of the Potomac is better supplied with wholesome\r\nand palatable tree-fruits than any other portion of the earth's surface\r\nof equal or nearly equal area.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I deem it a misfortune that our Northern States were so\r\nadmirably adapted to the Apple and kindred fruit-trees that our pioneer\r\nforefathers had little more to do than bury the seeds in the ground and\r\nwait a few years for the resulting fruit. The soil, formed of decayed\r\ntrees and their foliage, thickly covered with the ashes of the primitive\r\nforest, was as genial as soil could be; while the remaining woods, which\r\nstill covered seven-eighths of the country, shut out or softened the\r\ncold winds of Winter and Spring, rendering it less difficult, a century\r\nago, to grow fine peaches in southern New-Hampshire than it now is in\r\nsouthern New-York. Devastating insects were precluded by those great,\r\ndense woods from diffusing themselves from orchard to orchard as they\r\nnow do. Snows fell more heavily and lay longer then than now, protecting\r\nthe roots from heavy frosts, and keeping back buds and blossoms in\r\nSpring, to the signal advantage of the husbandman. I estimate that my\r\napple-trees would bear at least one-third more fruit if I could retard\r\ntheir blossoming a fortnight, so as to avoid the cold rains and cutting\r\nwinds, often succeeded by frosts, which are apt to pay their unwelcome\r\nfarewell visits just when my trees are in bloom or when the fruit is\r\nforming directly thereafter. Hence, I say to every one who shall\r\nhereafter set an orchard, Give it the northward slope of a hill if that\r\nbe possible. Other things being equal, the orchard which blossoms latest\r\nwill, in a series of years, yield most fruit, and will be most likely to\r\nbear when the Apple-crop of your vicinity proves a failure. I do not\r\nrecommend storing ice to plant or bury under the trees in April, for\r\nthat involves too much labor and expense; yet I have no doubt that even\r\nthat has been and sometimes might be done with profit. In the average,\r\nhowever, I judge that it would not pay.\r\n\r\nIn locating and setting an orchard, the very first consideration is\r\nthorough drainage. Nothing short of a destructive fire can be more\r\ninjurious to an apple-tree than compelling it to stand throughout Winter\r\nand Spring in sour, stagnant water. Barrenness, dead branches, and\r\npremature general decay, are the natural and righteous consequences of\r\nsuch crying abuse. There are many reasons for choosing sloping or broken\r\nground for an apple-orchard, whereof comparative exemption from frost\r\nand natural facility of drainage are the most obvious. A level field,\r\nthoroughly undrained to-day, may, through neglect and the mischiefs\r\nwrought by burrowing animals, have become little better than a morass\r\nthirty years hence; but an orchard set on a tolerably steep hillside is\r\nreasonably secure against wet feet to the close of its natural life.\r\n\r\nA gravelly or sandy loam is generally preferred for orchards; yet I have\r\nknown them to flourish and bear generously on heavy clay. Whoever has a\r\ngravelly field will wisely prefer this for Apples, not merely to clay\r\nbut to sand as well.\r\n\r\nAnd, while many young orchards have doubtless been injured by immoderate\r\napplications of rank, green manures, I doubt that any man has ever yet\r\nbestowed too much care and expense on the preparation of his ground for\r\nfruit-trees. Where ridges or plateaus of fast stone do not forbid, I\r\nwould say, Turn over the soil to a depth of at least fifteen inches with\r\na large plow and a strong team; then lift and pulverize the subsoil to a\r\ndepth of not less than nine inches; apply all the Wood-ashes you can\r\nget, with one thousand bushels of Marl if you are in a Marl region; if\r\nnot, use instead from thirty to fifty bushels of quick Lime\r\n(oyster-shell if that is to be had) with one hundred loads per acre of\r\nSwamp Muck which has lain a year on dry upland, baking in the sun and\r\nwind; and now you may think of setting your trees. If your soil was rich\r\nWestern prairie or Middle-State garden to begin with, you can dispense\r\nwith all these fertilizers; yet I doubt that there is an acre of Western\r\nprairie that would not be improved by the Lime or (perhaps better\r\nstill) a smaller quantity of refuse Salt from a packing-house or meat\r\nretailing grocery. There are not many farms that would not repay the\r\napplication of five bushels per acre of refuse Salt at twenty-five cents\r\nper bushel.\r\n\r\nYour trees once set--(and he who sets twenty trees per day as they\r\nshould be set, with each root in its natural position, and the earth\r\npressed firmly around its trunk, but no higher than as it originally\r\ngrew, is a faithful, efficient worker), I would cultivate the land, (for\r\nthe trees' sake), growing crops successively of Ruta Bagas, Carrots,\r\nBeets, and early Potatoes, but no grain whatever, for six or seven\r\nyears, disturbing the roots of the trees as little as may be, and\r\nguarding their trunks from tug, or trace, or whiffle-tree, by three\r\nstakes set firmly in the ground about each tree, not so near it as to\r\npreclude constant cultivation with the hoe inside as well as outside of\r\nthe stakes, so as to let no weed mature in the field. Apply from year to\r\nyear well-rotted compost to the field in quantity sufficient fully to\r\ncounterbalance the annual abstraction by your crops. Make it a law\r\ninflexible and relentless that no animal shall be let into this orchard\r\nto forage, or for any purpose whatever but to draw on manures, to till\r\nthe soil, and to draw away the crops. Thus until the first blossoms\r\nbegin to appear on the trees; then lay down to grass _without_ grain,\r\nunless it be a crop of Rye or Oats to be cut and carried off for feed\r\nwhen not more than half grown, leaving the ground to the young grass.\r\nLet the grass be mowed for the next two or three years, and\r\nthenceforward devote it to the pasturage of Swine, running over it with\r\na scythe once or twice each Summer to clear it of weeds, and taking out\r\nthe Swine a few days before beginning to gather the Apples, but putting\r\nthem back again the day after the harvest is completed. Let the Swine be\r\nsufficiently numerous and hungry to eat every apple that falls within a\r\nfew hours after it is dropped, and to insure their rooting out every\r\ngrub or worm that burrows in the earth beneath the trees, ready to\r\nspring up and apply himself to mischief at the very season when you\r\ncould best excuse his absence. I do not commend this as all, or nearly\r\nall, that should be done in resistance to the pest of insect ravage; but\r\nI begin with the Hog as the orchardist's readiest, cheapest, most\r\neffective ally or servitor in the warfare he is doomed unceasingly to\r\nwage against the spoilers of his heritage. I will indicate some further\r\ndefensive enginery in my next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT APPLE-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Apple-trees, in most orchards, are planted too far apart\r\nand allowed to grow taller and spread their limbs more widely than is\r\nprofitable. I judge that a pruner or picker should be able to reach the\r\ntopmost twig of any tree with a ten-foot pole, and that no limb should\r\nbe allowed to extend more than eight feet from the trunk whence it\r\nsprings. Our Autumnal Equinox occurs before our Apples are generally\r\nripe for harvest, and, finding our best trees bending under a heavy\r\nburden of fruit, its fierce gales are apt to make bad work with trees as\r\nwell as apples. The best tree I had, with several others, was thus\r\nruined by an equinoctial tempest a few years since. Barren trees escape\r\nunharmed, while those heavily laden with large fruit are wrenched and\r\ntwisted into fragments. And, even apart from this peril, a hundred\r\nweight of fruit at or near the extremity of limbs which extend ten or\r\ntwelve feet horizontally from the trunk, tax and strain a tree more than\r\nfour times that weight growing within four or five feet of the trunk,\r\nand on limbs that maintain a semi-erect position. I diffidently\r\nsuggest, therefore, that no apple-tree be allowed to exceed fifteen\r\nfeet in height, nor to send a limb more than eight feet from its trunk,\r\nand that trees be set (diamond-fashion) twenty-four feet apart each way,\r\ninstead of thirty-two, as some of mine were. I judge that the larger\r\nnumber of trees (72 per acre) will produce more fruit in the average\r\nthan the larger but fewer trees grown on squares of two by two rods to\r\neach, that they will thrive and bear longer, and that not one will be\r\ndestroyed or seriously harmed by winds where a dozen would if allowed to\r\ngrow as high and spread as far as they could.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery apple-tree should be pruned each year of its life: that is, it\r\nshould be carefully examined with intent to prune if that be found\r\nnecessary. It should be pruned with a careful eye to giving it the\r\nproper shape, which, from the point where it first forks upward, should\r\nbe that of a tea-cup, very nearly. I have seen young trees so malformed\r\nthat they could rarely, if ever, bear fruit enough to render them\r\nprofitable. And the pruning should be so carefully, judiciously done\r\nfrom the outset that no wood two years old should ever be cut away. With\r\nold, malformed, diseased, worm-eaten, decaying trees, the best must be\r\ndone that can be; but he who, pruning a tree that he set and has\r\nhitherto cared for, finds himself obliged to cut off a limb thicker than\r\nhis thumb, may justly suspect himself of lacking a mastery of the art of\r\nfruit-growing.\r\n\r\nSprouts from the root of an apple-tree remind me of children who\r\nhabitually play truant or are kept out of school. They not merely can\r\nnever come to good, but they are a nuisance to the neighborhood and\r\nbring reproach on the community.\r\n\r\nThe apple-grower should never forget that every producer needs to be fed\r\nin proportion to his product. If a cow gives twenty quarts of milk per\r\nday, she needs more grass or other food than if she gave but two quarts;\r\nand an acre of orchard that yields a hundred barrels of Apples per annum\r\nneeds something given to the soil to balance the draft made upon it.\r\nNature offers us good bargains; but she does not trust and will not be\r\ncheated. When she offers a bushel of Corn for a bushel of dirty Salt,\r\nShell Lime, or Wood-Ashes, a load of Hay for a load of Muck, we ought\r\nnot to stint the measure, but pay her demand ungrudgingly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now a last word on Insects.\r\n\r\nMy township (Newcastle) is said to have formerly grown more Apples per\r\nannum than any other township in the United States; its apple-trees are\r\nstill as numerous as ever, but their product has fallen off deplorably.\r\nI estimate the average yield of the last three years at less than a\r\nbushel per annum for each full-grown tree; I think a majority of the\r\ntrees have not borne a bushel each in all these three years.\r\nUnseasonable frosts, storms, etc., have borne the blame of this\r\nbarrenness--perhaps justly, if we consider only immediate causes--but\r\nthe caterpillar and other vermin are, in my view, our more potent,\r\nthough remoter, afflictions. Not less than four times within the last\r\nsixteen years have our trees been covered with nests and worms; and I\r\nhave seen whole orchards stripped of nearly every leaf till they were as\r\nbare (of every thing but caterpillars) in July as they should have been\r\nin December. After the scourge had passed, the trees reclad themselves\r\nwith leaves; but they grew old under that visitation faster in one year\r\nthan they would have done in ten of healthful fruit-bearing; and they\r\nare now prematurely gray and moss-covered because of the terrible\r\ninfliction.\r\n\r\nI lay down the general proposition that no man who harbors caterpillars\r\nhas any moral right to Apples--that each grower should be required to\r\nmake his choice between them. Slovenly farmers say, \"O there are so many\r\nof them that I cannot kill half so fast as they multiply.\" Then I say,\r\ncut down and burn up the trees you can best spare, until you have no\r\nmore left than you can keep clear of worms.\r\n\r\nIf it were the law of the land that whoever allowed caterpillars to nest\r\nand breed in his fruit-trees should pay a heavy fine for each nest, we\r\nshould soon be comparatively clear of the scourges. In the absence of\r\nsuch salutary regulation, one man fights them with persistent\r\nresolution, only to see his orchard again and again invaded and ravaged\r\nby the pests hatched and harbored by his careless neighbors. He thus\r\npays and repays the penalty of others' negligence and misdoing until,\r\ndiscouraged and demoralized, he abandons the hopeless struggle, and\r\nthenceforth repels the enemy from a few favorite trees around his\r\ndwelling, and surrenders his orchard to its fate. Thus bad laws (or no\r\nlaws) are constantly making bad farmers. The birds that would help us to\r\nmake head against our insect foes are slaughtered by reckless boys--many\r\nof them big enough to know better--and our perils and losses from\r\nenemies who would be contemptible if their numbers did not render them\r\nformidable increase from year to year. We must change all this; and the\r\nfirst requisite of our situation is a firm alliance of the entire\r\nfarming and fruit-growing interest defensive as to birds, offensive\r\ntoward their destroyers, and toward the vermin multiplied and shielded\r\nby the ruthless massacre of our feathered friends.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was written we have had (in 1870) the greatest\r\nApple-crop throughout our section that mine eyes did ever yet behold. It\r\nwas so abundant that I could not sell all my cider-apples to the\r\nvinegar-makers, even at fitly cents per barrel. This establishes the\r\ncontinued capacity of our region to bear Apples, and should invite to\r\nthe planting of new orchards and the fertilization and renovation of old\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\nHAY AND HAY-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grass-crop of this, as of many, if not most, other countries, is\r\nundoubtedly the most important of its annual products; requiring by far\r\nthe largest area of its soil, and furnishing the principal food of its\r\nCattle, and thus contributing essentially to the subsistence of its\r\nworking animals and to the production of those Meats which form a large\r\nand constantly increasing proportion of the food of every civilized\r\npeople. But I propose to speak in this essay of that proportion of the\r\nGrass-crop--say 25 to 35 per cent. of the whole--which is cut, cured and\r\nhoused (or stacked) for Hay, and which is mainly fed out to animals in\r\nWinter and Spring, when frost and snow have divested the earth of\r\nherbage or rendered it inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Census (1850) returned the Hay-crop of the preceding year at\r\n13,838,642 tuns, which the Eighth Census increased to 19,129,128 tuns as\r\nthe product of 1859. Confident that most farmers underestimate their\r\nHay-crops, and that hundreds of thousands who do not consider themselves\r\nfarmers, but who own or rent little homesteads of two to ten acres\r\neach, keeping thereon a cow or two and often a horse, fail to make\r\nreturns of the two to five tuns of Hay they annually produce,\r\nconsidering them too trivial, I estimate the actual Hay-crop of all our\r\nStates and Territories for the current year at 40,000,000 tuns, or about\r\na tun to each inhabitant, although I do not expect the new Census to\r\nplace it much, if any, above 25,000,000 tuns. The estimated average\r\nvalue of this crop is $10 (gold) per tun, making its aggregate value, at\r\nmy estimate of its amount, $400,000,000--and the quantity is constantly\r\nand rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nThat quantity should be larger from the area devoted to meadows, and the\r\nquality a great deal better. I estimate that 30,000,000 acres are\r\nannually mowed to obtain these 40,000,000 tuns of Hay, giving an average\r\nyield of 1-1/3 tuns per acre, while the average should certainly not\r\nfall below two tuns per acre. My upland has a gravelly, rocky soil, not\r\nnatural to grass, and had been pastured to death for at least a century\r\nbefore I bought it; yet it has yielded me an average of not less than\r\n2-1/2 tuns to the acre for the last sixteen years, and will not yield\r\nless while I am allowed to farm it. My lowland (bog when I bought it) is\r\nbound henceforth to yield more; but, while imperfectly or not at all\r\ndrained, it was of course a poor reliance--yielding bounteously in\r\nspots, in others, little or nothing.\r\n\r\nIn nothing else is shiftless, slovenly farming so apt to betray itself\r\nas in the culture of Grass and the management of grass lands. Pastures\r\novergrown with bushes and chequered by quaking, miry bogs; meadows foul\r\nwith every weed, from white daisy up to the rankest brakes, with\r\nhill-sides that may once have been productive, but from which crop after\r\ncrop has been taken and nothing returned to them, until their yield has\r\nshrunk to half or three-fourths of a tun of poor hay, these are the\r\naverage indications of a farm nearly run out by the poorest sort of\r\nfarming. Such farms were common in the New England of my boyhood; I\r\ntrust they are less so to-day; yet I seldom travel ten miles in any\r\nregion north or east of the Delaware without seeing one or more of them.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, I judge that the greater part of the hay made in\r\nNew-England was cut from sour, boggy land, that was devoted to grass\r\nsimply because nothing else could be done with it. I have helped to\r\ncarry the crop off on poles from considerable tracts on which oxen could\r\nnot venture without miring. It were superfluous to add that no well-bred\r\nanimal would eat such stuff, unless the choice were between it and\r\nabsolute starvation. In many cases, a very little work done in opening\r\nthe rudest surface-drains would have transformed these bogs into decent\r\nmeadows, and the product, by the help of plowing or seeding, into\r\nunexceptionable hay.\r\n\r\nThere are not many farmers, apart from our wise and skillful dairymen,\r\nwho use half enough grass-seed; men otherwise thrifty often fail in this\r\nrespect. If half our ordinary farmers would thoroughly seed down a full\r\nthird of the area they usually cultivate, and devote to the residue the\r\ntime and efforts they now give to the whole, they would grow more grain\r\nand vegetables, while the additional grass would be so much clear again.\r\n\r\nWe sow almost exclusively Timothy and Clover, when there are at least 20\r\ndifferent grasses required by our great diversity of soils, and of these\r\nthree or four might often be sown together with profit; especially in\r\nseeding down fields intended for pasture, we might advantageously use a\r\ngreater variety and abundance of seed. I believe that there are grasses\r\nnot yet adopted and hardly recognized by the great body of our\r\nfarmers--the buffalo-grass of the prairies for one--that will yet be\r\ngrown and prized over a great part of our country.\r\n\r\nAs for Hay-Making, my conviction is strong that our grass is cut in the\r\naverage from two to three weeks too late, and that not only is our hay\r\ngreatly damaged thereby, but our meadows needlessly impoverished and\r\nexhausted. The formation and perfection of seed always draw heavily upon\r\nthe soil. A crop of grass cut when the earliest blossoms begin to\r\ndrop--which, in my judgment, is the only right time--will not impoverish\r\nthe soil half so much as will the same crop cut three weeks later; while\r\nthe roots of the earlier cut grass will retain their vitality at least\r\nthrice as long as though half the seed had ripened before the crop was\r\nharvested. Grass that was fully ripe when cut has lost at least half its\r\nnutriment, which no chemistry can ever restore. Hay alone is dry fodder\r\nfor a long Winter, especially for young stock; but hay cut after it was\r\ndead ripe, is proper nutriment for no animal whatever--not even for old\r\nhorses, who are popularly supposed to like and thrive upon it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that our farmers are too generally short-handed throughout the\r\nseason of the Summer harvest, while it seems to explain the error I\r\ncombat, renders it none the less disastrous and deplorable. I estimate\r\nthe depreciation in the value of our hay-crop, by reason of late\r\ncutting, as not less than one-fifth; and, when we consider that a full\r\nhalf of our farmers turn out their cattle to ravage and poach up their\r\nfields in quest of fodder a full month earlier than they should, because\r\ntheir hay is nearly or quite exhausted, the consequences of this error\r\nare seen to diffuse themselves over the whole economy of the farm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the hour in which grass falls under the Mower, it ought to be kept\r\nin motion until laid at rest in the stack or the barn; keep stirring it\r\nwith the tedder until it is ready to be raked into light winrows, and\r\nturn these over and over until they will answer to go upon the cart. In\r\nany bright, hot day, the grass mowed in the morning should be stacked\r\nbefore the dew falls at night; while, if any is mowed after noon, it\r\nshould be cocked and capped by sunset, even though it be necessary to\r\nopen it out the next fair morning.\r\n\r\nI have a dream of hay-making, especially with regard to clover, without\r\nallowing it to be scalded by fierce sunshine. In my dream, the grass is\r\nraked and loaded nearly as fast as cut, drawn to the barn-yard, and\r\nthere pitched upon an endless apron, on which it is carried slowly\r\nthrough a drying-house, heated to some 200 deg. Fahrenheit by steam or by\r\ncharcoal in a furnace below, somewhat after the manner of a hop-kiln.\r\nWhile passing slowly through this heated atmosphere, the grass is\r\ncontinually forked up and shaken so as to expose every lock of it to the\r\ndrying heat, until it passes off thereby deprived of its moisture and is\r\nprecipitated into a mow or upon a stack-bottom at the opposite side;\r\nload after load being pitched upon the apron continuously, and the\r\ndrying process going steadily forward by night as well as by day, and\r\nwithout regard to the weather outside. I do not assert that this vision\r\nwill ever be realized; but I have known dreams as wild as this\r\ntransformed by time and thought into beneficent realities.\r\n\r\nI ask no one to share my dreams or sympathise with their drift and\r\npurpose. I only insist that Hay-making, as it is managed all around me,\r\nis ruder in its processes and more uncertain in its results than it\r\nshould or need be. We cut our grass rapidly and well; we gather and\r\nhouse it with tolerable efficiency; but we cure much of it imperfectly\r\nand wastefully. The fact that most of it is over-ripe when cut\r\naggravates the pernicious effects of its subsequent exposure to dew and\r\nrain; and the net result is damaged fodder which is at once unpalatable\r\nand innutritious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\nPEACHES--PEARS--CHERRIES--GRAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur harsh, capricious climate north of the latitudes of Philadelphia,\r\nCincinnati, and St. Louis--so much severer than that of corresponding\r\nlatitudes in Europe--is unfavorable, or at least very trying, to all the\r\nmore delicate and luscious Fruits, berries excepted. Except on our\r\nPacific coast, of which the Winter temperature is at least ten degrees\r\nmilder than that of the Atlantic, the finer Peaches and Grapes are grown\r\nwith difficulty north of the fortieth degree of latitude, save in a few\r\nspecially favored localities, whereof the southern shore of Lake Erie is\r\nmost noted, though part of that of Lake Ontario and of the west coast of\r\nLake Michigan are likewise well adapted to the Peach.\r\n\r\nIt is not the mere fact that the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer\r\nsometimes ranges below zero, and the earth is deeply frozen, but the\r\nsuddenness wherewith such rigor succeeds and is succeeded by a\r\ntemperature above the freezing point, that proves so inhospitable to the\r\nmost valued Tree-Fruits. And, as the dense forests which formerly\r\nclothed the Alleghenies and the Atlantic slope, are year by year swept\r\naway, the severity of our \"cold snaps,\" and the celerity with which they\r\nappear and disappear, are constantly aggravated. A change of 60 deg., or\r\nfrom 50 deg. above to 10 deg. below zero, between morning and the following\r\nmidnight, soon followed by an equally rapid return to an average\r\nNovember temperature, often proves fatal even to hardy forest-trees. I\r\nhave had the Red Cedar in my woods killed by scores during an open,\r\ncapricious Winter; and my observation indicates the warmest spots in a\r\nforest as those where trees are most likely to be thus destroyed. After\r\nan Arctic night, in which they are frozen solid, a bright sun sends its\r\nrays into the warmest nooks, whence the wind is excluded, and wholly or\r\npartially thaws out the smaller trees; which are suddenly frozen solid\r\nagain so soon as the sunshine is withdrawn; and this partly explains to\r\nmy mind the fact that peach-buds are often killed in lower and level\r\nportions of an orchard, while they retain their vitality on the\r\nhill-side and at its crest, not 80 rods distant from those destroyed.\r\nThe fact that the colder air descends into and remains in the valleys of\r\na rolling district contributes also to the correct explanation of a\r\nphenomenon which has puzzled some observers.\r\n\r\nUnless in a favored locality, it seems to the unadvisable for a farmer\r\nwho expects to thrive mainly by the production of Grain and Cattle, to\r\nattempt the growing of the finer Fruits, except for the use of his own\r\nfamily. In a majority of cases, a multiplicity of cares and labors\r\nprecludes his giving to his Peaches and Grapes, his Plums and Quinces,\r\nthe seasonable and persistent attention which they absolutely require.\r\nQuite commonly, a farmer visits a grand nursery, sees with admiration\r\nits trees and vines loaded with the most luscious Fruits, and rashly\r\ninfers that he has only to buy a good stock of like Trees and Vines to\r\ninsure himself an abundance of delicious fruit. So he buys and sets; but\r\nwith no such preparation of the soil, and no such care to keep it mellow\r\nand free from weeds, or to baffle and destroy predatory insects, as the\r\nnurseryman employs. Hence the utter disappointment of his hopes; borers,\r\nslugs, caterpillars, and every known or unknown species of insect\r\nenemies, prey upon his neglected favorites. At intervals, some domestic\r\nanimal or animals get among them, and break down a dozen in an hour. So,\r\nthe far greater number come to grief, without having had one fair chance\r\nto show what they could do, and the farmer jumps to the conclusion that\r\nthe nurseryman was a swindler, and the trees he sells scarcely related\r\nto those whose abundant and excellent fruits tempted him to buy. I\r\ncounsel every farmer to consider thoughtfully the treatment absolutely\r\nrequired for the production of the finer Fruits before he allows a\r\nnurseryman to make a bill against him, and not expect to grow Duchesse\r\nPears as easily as Blackberries, or Ionas and Catawbas as readily as he\r\ndoes Fox-grapes on the willows which overhang his brook; for if he does\r\nhe will surely be disappointed.\r\n\r\nSome of our hardier and coarser Grapes--the Concord preeminent among\r\nthem--are grown with considerable facility over a wide extent of our\r\ncountry; and many farmers, having planted them in congenial soil, and\r\ntended them well throughout their infancy, are rewarded by a bounteous\r\nproduct for two or three years. Believing their success assured, they\r\nimagine that their vines may henceforth be neglected, and in the course\r\nof two or three more years they are often utterly ruined. I know that\r\nthere are wild grapes of some value, in the absence of better, which\r\nthrive and bear without attention; but I do not believe that any grape\r\nwhich will sell in a market where good fruit was ever seen, can be grown\r\nnorth of Philadelphia but by constant care and labor, or at a cost of\r\nless than five cents per pound, under the most judicious and skillful\r\ntreatment. In California, and I presume in most of our States south of\r\nthe Potomac and Ohio, choice grapes may be grown more abundantly and\r\nmore cheaply. Yet I think the localities are few and far between in\r\nwhich a tun of good grapes can be grown as cheaply as a tun of wheat,\r\nunder the most judicious cultivation in either case.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to discourage grape-growing; on the contrary, I would have\r\nevery farmer, even so far north as Vermont and Wisconsin, experiment\r\ncautiously with a dozen of the most promising varieties, including\r\nalways the more hardy, in the hope of finding some one or more adapted\r\nto his soil, and capable of enduring his climate. Even in France, the\r\nland of the vine, one farm will produce a grape which the very next will\r\nnot: no man can satisfactorily say why. The farmer, who has tried half a\r\ndozen grapes and failed with all, should not be deterred from further\r\nexperiments, for the very next may prove a success. I would only say, Be\r\nmoderate in your expectations and careful in your experiments; and never\r\nrisk even $100 on a vineyard, till you have ascertained, at a cost of $5\r\nor under, whether the species you are testing will thrive and bear on\r\nyour soil.\r\n\r\nIn my own case, my upland mainly sloping to the west, with a hill rising\r\ndirectly south of it, I have had no luck with Grapes, and I have wasted\r\nlittle time or means upon them. I have done enough to show that they can\r\nbe grown, even in such a locality, but not to profit or satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI would advise the farmer who proposes to grow Pear, Peaches, and\r\nQuinces, for home use only or mainly, to select a piece of dry, gravelly\r\nor sandy loam, underdrain it thoroughly, plow or trench it very deeply,\r\nand fertilize it generously, in good part with ashes and with leaf-mold\r\nfrom his woods. Locate the pig-pen on one side of it, fence it strongly,\r\nand let the pigs have the run of it for a good portion of each year. In\r\nthis plat or yard, plant half a dozen Cherry and as many Pear trees of\r\nchoice varieties, the Bartlett foremost among them; keep clear of all\r\ndwarfs, and let your choicest trees have a chance to run under the\r\npig-pen if they will. Plant here also, if your climate does not forbid,\r\na dozen well-chosen Peach-trees, and two each year thereafter to replace\r\nthose that will soon be dying out; and give half a dozen Quinces moist\r\nand rich locations by the side of your fences; surrounding each tree\r\nwith stakes or pickets that will preclude too great familiarity on the\r\npart of the swine, and will not prevent a sharp scrutiny for borers in\r\ntheir season. Do not forget that a fruit-tree is like a cow tied to an\r\nimmovable stake, from which you cannot continue to draw a pail of milk\r\nper day unless you carry her a liberal supply of food; and every Fall\r\ncart in half a dozen loads of muck from some convenient swamp or pond\r\nfor your pigs to turn over: Should they leave any weeds, cut them with a\r\nscythe as often as they seem to need it; never allowing one to ripen\r\nseed. There may be easier and surer ways to obtain choice fruits; but\r\nthis one commends itself to my judgment as not surpassed by any other. I\r\nthink few have grown fruits to profit but those who make this a\r\nspecialty; and I feel that disappointment in fruit-culture is by no\r\nmeans near the end. You _can_ grow Plums, or Grapes, or Peaches, outside\r\nof the climate most congenial to them, but this is a work wherein\r\nsuccess is likely to cost more than its worth. Try it first on a small\r\nscale, if you will try it; and be sure you do it thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\nGRAIN-GROWING--EAST AND WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nI disclaim all pretensions to ability to teach Western farmers how to\r\ngrow Indian Corn abundantly and profitably, while I cheerfully admit\r\nthat they have taught _me_ somewhat thoroughly worth knowing. In my\r\nboyhood, I hoed Corn diligently for weeks at a time, drawing the earth\r\nfrom between the rows up about the stalks to a depth of three or four\r\ninches; thus forming hills which the West has since taught me to be of\r\nno use, but rather a detriment, embarrassing the efforts of the growing,\r\nhungry plants to throw out their roots extensively in every direction,\r\nand subjecting them to needless injury from drouth. I am thoroughly\r\nconvinced that Corn, properly planted, will, like Wheat and all other\r\ngrains, root itself just deep enough in the ground, and that to keep\r\ndown all weeds and leave the surface of the corn-field open, mellow and\r\nperfectly flat, is the best as well as the cheapest way to cultivate\r\nCorn. And I do not believe that so much human food, with so little\r\nlabor, is produced elsewhere on earth as in the spacious fields of\r\nWheat and Corn in our grand Mississippi valley.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I have seen in that valley many ample stretches covered with\r\nCorn, whereof the tillage seemed susceptible of improvement. Riding\r\nbetween these great corn-fields in October, after everything standing\r\nthereon had been killed by frost, it seemed to my observation that,\r\nwhile the corn-crop was fair, the weed-crop was far more luxuriant; so\r\nthat, if everything had been cut clean from the ground, and the corn and\r\nthe weeds placed in opposite scales, the latter would have weighed down\r\nthe former. I cannot doubt that the cultivation, or lack of cultivation,\r\nwhich produces or permits such results, is not merely slovenly, but\r\nunthrifty.\r\n\r\nThe West is for the present, as for a generation she has been, the\r\ngranary of the East. In my judgment, she will not long be content to\r\nremain so. Fifty years ago, the Genesee valley supplied most of the\r\nwheat and flour imported into New-England; ten years later, Northern\r\nOhio was our principal resource; ten years later still, Michigan,\r\nIndiana, northern Illinois, and eastern Wisconsin, had been added to our\r\ngrain-growing territory. Another decade, and our flour manufacturers had\r\ncrossed the Mississippi, laying Iowa and Minnesota under liberal\r\ncontributions, while western New-York had ceased to grow even her own\r\nbreadstuffs, and Ohio to produce one bushel more than she needed for\r\nhome consumption. Can we doubt that this steady recession of our Egypt,\r\nour Hungary, is destined to continue? Twenty-three years ago, when I\r\nfirst rode out from the then rising village of Chicago to see the\r\nIllinois prairies, nearly every wagon I met was loaded with wheat, going\r\ninto Chicago, to be sold for about fifty cents per bushel, and the\r\nproceeds loaded back in the form of lumber, groceries, and almost\r\neverything else, grain excepted, needed by the pioneers, then dotting,\r\nthinly and irregularly, that whole region with their cabins. Now, I\r\npresume the district I then traversed produces hardly more grain than it\r\nconsumes; taking Illinois altogether, I doubt that she will grow her own\r\nbreadstuffs after 1880; not that she will be unable to produce a large\r\nsurplus, but that her farmers will have decided that they can use their\r\nlands otherwise to greater advantage. Iowa and Minnesota will continue\r\nto export grain for perhaps twenty years longer; but even their time\r\nwill come for saying, \"New-York and New-England (not to speak of _Old_\r\nEngland) are too far away to furnish profitable markets for such bulky\r\nproducts; the cost of transportation absorbs the larger part of the\r\ncargo. We must export instead Wool, Meat, Lard, Butter, Cheese, Hops,\r\nand various Manufactures, whereof the freight will range from 2 up to\r\nnot more than 25 per cent. of the value.\" They thus save their soil from\r\nthe tremendous exaction made by taking grain-crop after grain-crop\r\npersistently, which long ago exhausted most of New-England and eastern\r\nNew-York of wheat-forming material, and has since wrought the same\r\ndeplorable result in our rich Genesee valley; while eastern\r\nPennsylvania, though settled nearly two centuries ago, having pursued a\r\nmore rational and provident system of husbandry, grows excellent\r\nwheat-crops to this day.\r\n\r\nI insist that the States this side of the Delaware; though they will\r\ndraw much grain from the Canadas after the political change that cannot\r\nbe far distant, will be compelled to grow a very considerable share of\r\ntheir own breadstuff; that the West will cease to supply them unless at\r\nprices which they will deem exorbitant; and that grain-growing eastward\r\nof a line drawn from Baltimore this north to the Lakes will have to be\r\nvery considerably extended. Let us see, then, whether this might not be\r\ndone with profit even now, and whether the East is not unwise in having\r\nso generally abandoned grain-growing.\r\n\r\nI leave out of the account most of New-England, as well as of Eastern\r\nNew-York, and the more rugged portions of New-Jersey and Pennsylvania,\r\nwhere the rocky, hilly, swampy face of the country seems to forbid any\r\nbut that _patchy_ cultivation, wherein machinery and mechanical power\r\ncan scarcely be made available, and which seem, therefore, permanently\r\nfated to persevere in a system of agriculture and horticulture not\r\nessentially unlike that they now exhibit. In the valleys of the\r\nPenobscot, the Kennebec, the Hudson, and of our smaller rivers, there\r\nare considerable tracts absolutely free from these natural impediments,\r\nwhereon a larger and more efficient husbandry is perfectly practicable,\r\neven now; but these intervales are generally the property of many\r\nowners; are cut up by roads and fences; and are held at high prices: so\r\nthat I will simply pass them by, and take for illustration the \"Pine\r\nBarrens\" of Southern New-Jersey, merely observing that what I say of\r\nthem is equally applicable, with slight modifications, to large portions\r\nof Long Island, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pine Barrens\" of New-Jersey are a marine deposit of several hundred\r\nfeet in depth, mainly sand, with which more or less clay is generally\r\nintermingled, while there are beds and even broader stretches of this\r\nmaterial nearly or quite pure; the clay sometimes underlying the sand at\r\na depth of 10 to 30 or 40 inches. Vast deposits of muck or leaf-mold,\r\noften of many acres in extent and from two to twenty feet in depth, are\r\nvery common; so that hardly any portion of the dry or sandy land is two\r\nmiles distant from one or more of them, while some is usually much\r\nnearer; and half the entire region is underlaid by at least one stratum\r\nof the famous marl (formed of the decomposed bones of gigantic marine\r\nmonsters long ago extinct) which has already played so important and\r\nbeneficent a part in the renovation and fertilization of large districts\r\nin Monmouth, Burlington, Salem, and other counties.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose now that a farmer of ample means and generous capacity\r\nshould purchase four hundred acres of these \"barrens,\" with intent to\r\nproduce therefrom, not sweet potatoes, melons, and the \"truck\" to which\r\nSouthern Jersey is so largely devoted, but substantial Grain and Meat;\r\nand let us see whether the enterprise would probably pay.\r\n\r\nLet us not stint the outlay, but, presuming the tract to be eligibly\r\nlocated on a railroad not too distant from some good marl-bed, estimate\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Purchase-money of 400 acres at $25 per acre                   $10,000\r\n\r\n  Clearing, grubbing, fencing and breaking up ditto at $20\r\n  per acre, over and above the proceeds of the wood               8,000\r\n\r\n  One thousand bushels of best Marl per acre, at 6 cents per\r\n  bushel delivered                                               24,000\r\n\r\n  One hundred loads of Swamp Muck, per acre, at 50 cents\r\n  per load                                                       20,000\r\n\r\n  Fifty bushels (unslaked) of Oyster-shell Lime (to compost\r\n  with the Muck), per acre, at 25 cents per bushel, delivered     5,000\r\n\r\n  One hundred tuns of Bone Flour at $50 per tun                   5,000\r\n                                                                -------\r\n  [Net cost, $180 per acre.]            Total                   $72,000\r\n\r\nI believe that this tract, divided by light fences into four fields of\r\n100 acres each, and seeded in rotation to Corn, Wheat, Clover and other\r\ngrasses, would produce fully 60 bushels of Corn and 30 of Wheat per\r\nacre, with not less than 3 tuns of good Hay; and that by cutting,\r\nsteaming, and feeding the stalks and straw on the place, not pasturing,\r\nbut keeping up the stock, and feeding them, as indicated in a former\r\nchapter of these essays, and selling their product in the form of Milk,\r\nButter, Cheese and Meat, a greater profit would be realized than could\r\nbe from a like investment in Iowa or Kansas. The soil is warm, readily\r\nfrees itself, or is freed, from surplus water; is not addicted to weeds;\r\nmay be plowed at least 200 days in a year; may be sowed or planted in\r\nthe Spring, when Minnesota is yet solidly frozen; while the crop, early\r\nmatured, is on hand to take advantage of any sudden advance in the\r\nEuropean or our own seaboard markets. Labor, also, is cheaper and more\r\nrapidly procured in the neighborhood of this great focus of immigration\r\nthan it is or can be in the West; and our capable farmers may take their\r\npick of the workers thronging hither from Europe, at the moment of their\r\nlanding on our shore. Of course, the owner of such an estate as I have\r\nroughly outlined, would be likely to keep a part of his purchase in\r\ntimber, proving the quality thereof by cutting out the less desirable\r\ntrees, trimming up the rest, and planting new ones among them; and he\r\nwould be almost certain to devote some part of his farm annually to the\r\ngrowth of Roots, Vegetables, and Fruits. But I have aimed to show only\r\nthat he would grow grain here at a profit, and I think I have succeeded.\r\nHis 60 bushels of corn (shelled) per acre could be sold at his crib, one\r\nyear with another, for 60 silver dollars; and he need seldom wait a\r\nmonth after husking it for customers who would gladly take his grain and\r\npay the money for it. This would be just about double what the Iowa or\r\nMissouri farmer can expect to average for _his_ Corn. The abundant\r\nfodder would also be worth in New-Jersey at least double its value in\r\nIowa; and I judge that the farmer able to buy, prepare, fertilize, and\r\ncultivate 1,200 acres of the Jersey \"barrens,\" could make more than\r\nthrice the profit to be realized by the owner of 400 acres. He would\r\nplow and seed as well as thrash, shell, cut stalks and straw, and\r\nprepare the food of his animals, wholly by steam-power, and would soon\r\nlearn to cultivate a square mile at no greater expense than is now\r\ninvolved in the as perfect tillage of 200 acres.\r\n\r\nThis essay is not intended to prove that Grain is not or may not be\r\nprofitably cultivated at the West, nor that it is unadvisable for\r\nEastern farmers to migrate thither in order so to cultivate it. What I\r\nmaintain is, that Wheat, Indian Corn, and nearly all our great food\r\nstaples, may also be profitably produced on the seaboard, and that\r\nthousands of square miles, now nearly or quite unproductive, may be\r\nwisely and profitably devoted to such production. Let us regard,\r\ntherefore, without alarm, the prospect of such a development and\r\ndiversification of Western Industry as will render necessary a large and\r\npermanent extension (or rather revival) of Eastern grain-growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\nESCULENT ROOTS--POTATOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no other form can so large an amount and value of human food be\r\nobtained from an acre of ground as in that of edible roots or tubers;\r\nand of these the Potato is by far the most acceptable, and in most\r\ngeneral use. Our ancestors, it is settled, were destitute and ignorant\r\nof the Potato prior to the discovery of America, though Europe would now\r\nfind it difficult to subsist her teeming millions without it. In\r\ntravelling pretty widely over that continent, I cannot remember that I\r\nfound, any considerable district in which the Potato was not cultivated,\r\nthough Ireland, western England, and northern Switzerland, with a small\r\nportion of northern Italy, are impressed on my mind as the most addicted\r\nto the growth of this esculent. Other roots are eaten occasionally, by\r\nway of variety, or as giving a relish to ordinary food; but the Potato\r\nalone forms part of the every day diet alike of prince and peasant. It\r\nis an almost indispensable ingredient of the feasts of Dives, while it\r\nis the cheapest and commonest resort for satiating or moderating the\r\nhunger of Lazarus. I recollect hearing my parents, fifty years ago,\r\nrelate how, in their childhood and youth, the poor of New-England, when\r\nthe grain-crop of that region was cut short, as it often was, were\r\nobliged to subsist through the following Winter mainly on Potatoes and\r\nMilk; and I then accorded to those unfortunates of the preceding\r\ngeneration a sympathy which I should now considerably abate, provided\r\nthe Potatoes were of good quality. Roasted Potatoes, seasoned with salt\r\nand butter and washed down with bounteous draughts of fresh buttermilk,\r\nused in those days to be the regular supper served up in farmers' homes\r\nafter a churning of cream into butter; and I have since eaten costly\r\nsuppers that were not half so good.\r\n\r\nThe Potato, say some accredited accounts, was first brought to Europe\r\nfrom Virginia, by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1586 or 1587; but I do not\r\nbelieve the story. Authentic tradition affirms that the Potato was\r\nutterly unknown in New-England, or at all events east of the\r\nConnecticut, when the Scotch-Irish who first settled Londonderry, N. H.,\r\ncame over from _old_ Londonderry, Ireland, bringing the Potato with\r\nthem. They spent the Winter of 1719 in different parts of Massachusetts\r\nand Maine--quite a number of them at Haverhill, Mass., where they gave\r\naway a few Potatoes for seed, on leaving for their own chosen location\r\nin the Spring; and they afterward learned that the English colonists,\r\nwho received them, tried hard to find or make the seed-balls edible the\r\nnext Fall but were obliged to give it up as a bad job; leaving the\r\ntubers untouched and unsuspected in the ground.\r\n\r\nI doubt that the Potato was found growing by Europeans in any part of\r\nthis country, unless it be in that we have acquired from Mexico. It is\r\nessentially a child of the mountains, and I presume it grew wild nowhere\r\nelse than on the sides of the great chain which traversed Spanish\r\nAmerica, at a height of from 5,000 to 8,000 feet above the surface of\r\nthe ocean. Here it found a climate cooled by the elevation and moistened\r\nby melting snows from above and by frequent showers, yet one which\r\nseldom allowed the ground to be frozen to any considerable depth, while\r\nthe pure and bracing atmosphere was congenial to its nature and\r\nrequirements. In this country, the Potato is hardiest and thriftiest\r\namong the White Mountains of New-Hampshire, the Green Mountains of\r\nVermont, on the Catskills and kindred elevations in our own State, and\r\nin similar regions of Pennsylvania and the States further South and\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nMy own place is at least 15 miles from, and 500 feet above, Long Island\r\nSound; yet I cannot make the Potato, by the most generous treatment, so\r\nprolific as it was in New-Hampshire in my boyhood, where I dug a bushel\r\nfrom 14 hills, grown on rough, hard ground, but which, having just been\r\ncleared of a thick growth of bushes and briars, was probably better\r\nadapted to this crop than though it had been covered an inch deep with\r\nbarn-yard manure.\r\n\r\nHe who has a tolerably dry, warm sandy soil, covered two or three\r\ninches deep with decayed or decaying leaves and brush, may count with\r\nconfidence on raising from it a good crop of Potatoes, provided his seed\r\nbe sound and healthy. On the other hand, all authorities agree that\r\nanimal manures, unless very thoroughly rotted and intimately mixed with\r\nthe soil, are injurious to the quality of Potatoes grown thereon,\r\nstimulating any tendency to disease, if they do not originally produce\r\nsuch disease. I believe that Swamp Muck, dug in Summer or Autumn,\r\ndeposited on a dry bank or glade, and cured of its acidity by an\r\nadmixture of Wood-Ashes, of Lime, or of Salt (better still, of Lime and\r\nSalt chemically compounded by dissolving the Salt in the least possible\r\nquantity of Water, and slaking the lime with that Water), forms an\r\nexcellent fertilizer for Potatoes, if administered with a liberal hand.\r\nA bushel of either of these alkalies to a cord of muck is too little;\r\nthe dose should be doubled if possible; but, if the quantity be small,\r\nmix it more carefully, and give it all the time you can wherein to\r\noperate upon the muck before applying the mixture to your fields.\r\n\r\nWhere the muck is not easily to be had, yet the soil is thin and poor, I\r\nwould place considerable reliance on deep plowing and subsoiling in the\r\nFall, and cross-plowing just before planting in the Spring. Give a good\r\ndressing of Plaster, not less than 200 lbs. to the acre, directly after\r\nthe Fall plowing; if you have Ashes, scatter them liberally in the drill\r\nor hill as you plant; and, if you have them not, supply their place\r\nwith Superphosphate or Bone-dust. I think many farmers will be agreeably\r\nsurprised by the additional yield which will accrue from this treatment\r\nof their soil.\r\n\r\nThose who have no swamp muck, and feel that they can afford the outlay,\r\nmay, by plowing or subsoiling early in the Fall, seeding heavily with\r\nrye, and turning this under when the time comes for planting in the\r\nSpring, improve both crop and soil materially. But even to these I would\r\nsay: Apply the Gypsum in the Fall, and the Ashes or Lime and Salt\r\nmixture in the Spring; and now, with good seed and good luck, you will\r\nbe reasonably sure of a bounteous harvest. If a farmer, having a poor\r\nworn-out field of sandy loam, wants to do his very best by it, let him\r\nplow, subsoil, sow rye and plaster in the Fall, as above indicated, turn\r\nthis under, and sow buckwheat late in the next Spring; plow this under\r\nin turn when it has attained its growth, and sow to clover; turn this\r\ndown the following Spring, and Plant to late potatoes, and he will not\r\nmerely obtain a large crop, but have his land in admirable condition for\r\nwhatever way follow.\r\n\r\nI am quite well aware that such an outlay of labor and seed, with an\r\nentire loss of crop for one season, will seem to many too costly. I do\r\nnot advise it except under peculiar circumstances; and yet I am\r\nconfident that there are many fields that would be doubled in value by\r\nsuch treatment, which would richly repay all its cost. That most\r\nfarmers could not afford thus to treat their entire farms at once, is\r\nvery true; yet it does not follow that they might not deal with field\r\nafter field thus thoroughly, living on the products of 40 or 50 acres,\r\nwhile they devoted five or six annually to the work of thorough\r\nrenovation.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, we were threatened with a complete\r\nextinction of the Potato, as an article of food: the stalks, when\r\napproaching or just attaining maturity, were suddenly smitten with fatal\r\ndisease--usually, after a warm rain followed by scalding sunshine--the\r\ngrowing tubers were speedily affected; they rotted in the ground, and\r\nthey rotted nearly as badly if dug; and whole townships could hardly\r\nshow a bushel of sound Potatoes.\r\n\r\nA desolating famine in Ireland, which swept away or drove into exile\r\nnearly two millions of her people, was the most striking and memorable\r\nresult of this wide-spread disaster. For several succeeding seasons, the\r\nPotato was similarly, though not so extensively, affected; and the fears\r\nwidely expressed that the day of its usefulness was over, seemed to have\r\nample justification. Speaking generally, the Potato has never since been\r\nso hardy or prolific as it was half a century ago; it has gradually\r\nrecovered, however, from its low estate, and, though the malady still\r\nlingers, and from time to time renews its ravages in different\r\nlocalities, the farmer now plants judiciously and on fit ground, with a\r\nreasonable hope that his labor will be duly rewarded.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be generally agreed that clayey soils are not adapted to its\r\ngrowth; that, if the quantity of the crop be not stinted, its quality is\r\npretty sure to be inferior; and I can personally testify that the\r\nplanting of Potatoes on wet soil--that is, on swampy or spongy land\r\nwhich has not been thoroughly drained and sweetened--is a hopeless,\r\nthriftless labor--that the crop will seldom be worth the seed.\r\n\r\nAs to the ten or a dozen different insects to which the Potato-rot has\r\nbeen attributed, I regard them all as consequences, not causes;\r\nattracted to prey on the plant by its sickly, weakly condition, and not\r\nreally responsible for that condition. If any care for my reasons, let\r\nhim refer to what I have said of the Wheat-plant and its insect\r\nenemies.[1]\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to the kind of seed to be planted; and\r\nI think the result has been a pretty general conviction that it is\r\nbetter to cut the tuber into pieces having two or three eyes each, than\r\nto plant it whole, since the whole Potato sends up a superfluity of\r\nstalks, with a like effect on the crop to that of putting six or eight\r\nkernels of corn in each hill.\r\n\r\nSmall Potatoes are immature, unripe, and of course should never be\r\nplanted, since their progeny will be feeble and sickly. Select for seed\r\nnone but thoroughly ripe Potatoes, and the larger the better.\r\n\r\nMy own judgment favors planting in drills rather than hills, with ample\r\nspace for working between them; not less than 30 inches: the seed being\r\ndropped about 6 inches apart in the drill. The soil must be deep and\r\nmellow, for the Potato suffers from drouth much sooner than Indian Corn\r\nor almost any other crop usually grown among us. I believe in covering\r\nthe seed from 2 to 2-1/2 inches; and I hold to flat or level culture for\r\nthis as for everything else. Planting on a ridge made by turning two\r\nfurrows together may be advisable where the land is wet; but then wet\r\nland never can be made fit for cultivation, except by underdraining. And\r\nI insist upon setting the rows or drills well apart, because I hold that\r\nthe soil should often be loosened and stirred to a good depth with the\r\nsubsoil plow; and that this process should be persevered in till the\r\nplant is in blossom. Hardly any plant will pay better for persistent\r\ncultivation than the Potato.\r\n\r\nAs to varieties, I will only say that planting the tubers for seed is an\r\nunnatural process, which tends and must tend to degeneracy. The new\r\nvarieties now most prized will certainly run out in the course of twenty\r\nor thirty years at furthest, and must be replaced from time to time by\r\nstill newer, grown from the seed. This creation of new species is, and\r\nmust be, a slow, expensive process; since not one in a hundred of these\r\nvarieties possess any value. I don't quite believe in selling--I mean in\r\nbuying--Potatoes at $1 per pound; but he who originates a really\r\nvaluable new Potato deserves a recompense for his industry, patience,\r\nand good fortune; and I shall be glad to learn that he receives it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Chapter XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\nROOTS--TURNIPS--BEETS--CARROTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there be any who still hold that this country must ultimately rival\r\nthat magnificent Turnip-culture which has so largely transformed the\r\nagricultural industry of England and Scotland, while signally and\r\nbeneficently increasing its annual product, I judge that time will prove\r\nthem mistaken. The striking diversity of climate between the opposite\r\ncoasts of the Atlantic forbids the realization of their hopes. The\r\nBritish Isles, with a considerable portion of the adjacent coast of\r\nContinental Europe, have a climate so modified by the Gulf Stream and\r\nthe ocean that their Summers are usually moist and cool, their Autumns\r\nstill more so, and their Winters rarely so cold as to freeze the earth\r\nconsiderably; while our Summers and Autumns, are comparatively hot and\r\ndry; our Winters in part intensely cold, so as to freeze the earth solid\r\nfor a foot or more. Hence, every variety of turnip is exposed here in\r\nits tenderer stages to the ravages of every devouring insect; while the\r\n1st of December often finds the soil of all but our Southern and Pacific\r\nStates so frozen that cannon-wheels would hardly track it, and roots\r\nnot previously dug up must remain fast in the earth for weeks and often\r\nfor months. Hence, the turnip can never grow so luxuriantly, nor be\r\ncounted on with such certainty, here as in Great Britain; nor can\r\nanimals be fed on it in Winter, except at the heavy cost of pulling or\r\ndigging, cutting off the tops and carefully housing in Autumn, and then\r\nslicing and feeding out in Winter. It is manifest that turnips thus\r\nhandled, however economically, cannot compete with hay and corn-fodder\r\nin our Eastern and Middle States; nor with these and the cheaper species\r\nof grain in the West, as the daily Winter food of cattle.\r\n\r\nStill, I hold that our stock-growing farmers profitably may, and\r\nultimately will, grow _some_ turnips to be fed out to their growing and\r\nworking animals. A good meal of turnips given twice a week, if not\r\noftener, to these, will agreeably and usefully break the monotony of\r\nliving exclusively on dry fodder, and will give a relish to their hay or\r\ncut stalks and straw, which cannot fail to tell upon their appetite,\r\ngrowth and thrift. Let our cattle-breeders begin with growing an acre or\r\ntwo each of Swedes per annum, so as to give their stock a good feed of\r\nthem, sliced thin in an effective machine, at least once in each week,\r\nand I feel confident that they will continue to grow turnips, and will\r\ngrow more and more of them throughout future years.\r\n\r\nThe Beet seems to me better adapted to our climate, especially south of\r\nthe fortieth degree of north latitude, than any variety of the Turnip\r\nwith which I am acquainted, and destined, in the good time coming, when\r\nwe shall have at least doubled the average depth of our soil, to very\r\nextensive cultivation among us. I am not regarding either of these roots\r\nwith reference to its use as human food, since our farmers generally\r\nunderstand that use at least as well as I do; nor will I here consider\r\nat length the use of the Beet in the production of Sugar. I value that\r\nuse highly, believing that millions of the poorer classes throughout\r\nEurope have been enabled to enjoy Sugar through its manufacture from the\r\nBeet who would rarely or never have tasted that luxury in the absence of\r\nthis manufacture. The people of Europe thus made familiar with Sugar can\r\nhardly be fewer than 100,000,000; and the number is annually increasing.\r\nThe cost of Sugar to these is considerably less in money, while\r\nimmeasurably less in labor, than it would or could have been had the\r\ntropical Cane been still regarded as the only plant available for the\r\nproduction of Sugar.\r\n\r\nBut the West Indies, wherein the Cane flourishes luxuriantly and renews\r\nitself perennially, lie at our doors. They look to us for most of their\r\ndaily bread, and for many other necessaries of life; while several, if\r\nnot all of them, are manifestly destined, in the natural progress of\r\nevents, to invoke the protection of our flag. I do not, therefore, feel\r\nconfident that Beet Sugar now promises to become an important staple\r\ndestined to take a high rank among the products of our national\r\nindustry. With cheap labor, I believe it might to-day he manufactured\r\nwith profit in the rich, deep valleys of California, and perhaps in\r\nthose of Utah and Colorado as well. On the whole, however, I cannot deem\r\nthe prospect encouraging for the American promoters of the manufacture\r\nof Beet Sugar.\r\n\r\nBut when we shall have deepened essentially the soil of our arable\r\nacres, fertilized it abundantly, and cured it by faithful cultivation of\r\nits vicious addiction to weed-growing, I believe we shall devote\r\nmillions of those acres to the growth of Beets for cattle-food, and,\r\nhaving learned how to harvest as well as till them mainly by machinery,\r\nwith little help from hand labor, we shall produce them with eminent\r\nprofit and satisfaction to the grower. On soil fully two feet deep,\r\nthoroughly underdrained and amply fertilized, I believe we shall often\r\nproduce one thousand bushels of Beets to the acre; and so much\r\nacceptable and valuable food for cattle can hardly be obtained from an\r\nacre in any other form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo with regard to Carrots. I have never achieved eminent success in\r\ngrowing these, nor Beets; mainly because the soil on which I attempted\r\nto grow them was not adapted to, or rather not yet in condition for,\r\nsuch culture. But, should I live a few years longer, until my reclaimed\r\nswamp shall have become thoroughly sweetened and civilized, I mean to\r\ngrow on some part thereof 1,000 bushels of Carrots per acre, and a\r\nstill larger product of Beets; and the Carrot, in my judgment, ought now\r\nto be extensively grown in the South and West, as well as in this\r\nsection, for feeding to horses. I hold that 60 bushels of Carrots and 50\r\nof Oats, fed in alternate meals, are of at least equal value as\r\nhorse-feed with 100 bushels of Oats alone, while more easily grown in\r\nthis climate. The Oat-crop makes heavy drafts upon the soil, while our\r\nhot Summers are not congenial to its thrift or perfection. Since we must\r\ngrow Oats, we must be content to import new seed every 10 or 15 years\r\nfrom Scotland, Norway, and other countries which have cooler, moister\r\nSummers than our own; for the Oat will inevitably degenerate under such\r\nsuns as blazed through the latter half of our recent June. Believing\r\nthat the Carrot may profitably replace at least half the Oats now grown\r\nin this country, I look forward with confidence to its more and more\r\nextensive cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of feeding Roots to stock is not to be measured and\r\nbounded by their essential value. Beasts, like men, require a variety of\r\nfood, and thrive best upon a regimen which involves a change of diet.\r\nAdmit that hay is their cheapest Winter food; still, an occasional meal\r\nof something more succulent will prove beneficial, and this is best\r\nafforded by Roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER'S CALLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one fancies that he ever heard _me_ flattering farmers as a\r\nclass, or saying anything which implied that they were more virtuous,\r\nupright, unselfish, or deserving, than other people, I am sure he must\r\nhave misunderstood or that he now misrecollects me. I do not even join\r\nin the cant, which speaks of farmers as supporting everybody else--of\r\nfarming as the only indispensable vocation. You may say if you will that\r\nmankind could not subsist if there were no tillers of the soil; but the\r\nsame is true of house-builders, and of some other classes. A thoroughly\r\ngood farmer is a useful, valuable citizen: so is a good merchant,\r\ndoctor, or lawyer. It is not essential to the true nobility and genuine\r\nworth of the farmer's calling that any other should be assailed or\r\ndisparaged.\r\n\r\nStill, if one of my three sons had been spared to attain manhood, I\r\nshould have advised him to try to make himself a good farmer; and this\r\nwithout any romantic or poetic notions of Agriculture as a pursuit. I\r\nknow well, from personal though youthful experience, that the farmer's\r\nlife is one of labor, anxiety, and care; that hail, and flood, and\r\nhurricane, and untimely frosts, over which he can exert no control, will\r\noften destroy in an hour the net results of months of his persistent,\r\nwell-directed toil; that disease will sometimes sweep away his animals,\r\nin spite of the most judicious treatment, the most thoughtful\r\nprovidence, on his part; and that insects, blight, and rust, will often\r\nblast his well-grounded hopes of a generous harvest, when they seem on\r\nthe very point of realization. I know that he is necessarily exposed,\r\nmore than most other men, to the caprices and inclemencies of weather\r\nand climate; and that, if he begins responsible life without other means\r\nthan those he finds in his own clear head and strong arms, with those of\r\nhis helpmeet, he must expect to struggle through years of poverty,\r\nfrugality, and resolute, persistent, industry, before he can reasonably\r\nhope to attain a position of independence, comfort, and comparative\r\nleisure. I know that much of his work is rugged, and some of it\r\nabsolutely repulsive; I know that he will seem, even with unbroken good\r\nfortune, to be making money much more slowly than his neighbor, the\r\nmerchant, the broker, or eloquent lawyer, who fills the general eye\r\nwhile he prospers, and, when he fails, sinks out of sight and is soon\r\nforgotten; and yet, I should have advised my sons to choose farming as\r\ntheir vocation, for these among other reasons:\r\n\r\nI. There is no other business in which success is so nearly certain as\r\nin this. Of one hundred men who embark in trade, a careful observer\r\nreports that ninety-five fail; and, while I think this proportion too\r\nlarge, I am sure that a large majority do, and must fail, because\r\ncompetition is so eager and traffic so enormously overdone. If ten men\r\nendeavor to support their families by merchandise in a township which\r\naffords adequate business for but three, it is certain that a majority\r\nmust fail; no matter how judicious their management or how frugal their\r\nliving. But you may double the number of farmers in any agricultural\r\ncounty I ever traversed, without necessarily dooming one to failure, or\r\neven abridging his gains. If half the traders and professional men in\r\nthis country were to betake themselves to farming to-morrow, they would\r\nnot render that pursuit one whit less profitable, while they would\r\nlargely increase the comfort and wealth of the entire community; and,\r\nwhile a good merchant, lawyer, or doctor, may be starved out of any\r\ntownship, simply because the work he could do well is already confided\r\nto others, I never yet heard of a temperate, industrious, intelligent,\r\nfrugal, and energetic farmer who failed to make a living, or who, unless\r\nprostrated by disease or disabled by casualty, was precluded from\r\nsecuring a modest independence before age and decrepitude divested him\r\nof the ability to labor.\r\n\r\nII. I regard farming as that vocation which conduces most directly and\r\npalpably to a reverence for Honesty and Truth. The young lawyer is often\r\nconstrained, or at least tempted, by his necessities, to do the dirty\r\nprofessional work of a rascal intent on cheating his neighbor out of his\r\nrighteous dues. The young doctor may be likewise incited to resort to a\r\nquackery he despises in order to secure instant bread; the unknown\r\nauthor is often impelled to write what will sell rather than what the\r\npublic ought to buy; but the young farmer, acting _as_ a farmer, must\r\nrealize that his success depends upon his absolute verity and integrity.\r\nHe deals directly with Nature, which never was and never will be\r\ncheated. He has no temptation to sow beach sand for plaster, dock-seed\r\nfor clover, or stoop to any trick or juggle whatever. \"Whatsoever a man\r\nsoweth that shall he also reap,\" while true, in the long run, of all\r\nmen, is instantly and palpably true as to him. When he, having grown his\r\ncrop, shall attempt to sell it--in other words, when he ceases to be a\r\nfarmer and becomes a trader--he may possibly be tempted into one of the\r\nmany devious ways of rascality; but, so long as he is acting simply as a\r\nfarmer, he can hardly be lured from the broad, straight highway of\r\nintegrity and righteousness.\r\n\r\nIII. The farmer's calling seems to me that most conducive to thorough\r\nmanliness of character. Nobody expects him to cringe, or smirk, or curry\r\nfavor, is order to sell his produce. No merchant refuses to buy it\r\nbecause his politics are detested or his religious opinions heterodox.\r\nHe may be a Mormon, a Rebel, a Millerite, or a Communist, yet his Grain\r\nor his Pork will sell for exactly what it is worth--not a fraction less\r\nor more than the price commanded by the kindred product of like quality\r\nand intrinsic value of his neighbor, whose opinions on all points are\r\nfaultlessly orthodox and popular. On the other hand, the merchant, the\r\nlawyer, the doctor, especially if young and still struggling dubiously\r\nfor a position, are continually tempted to sacrifice or suppress their\r\nprofoundest convictions in deference to the vehement and often\r\nirrational prepossessions of the community, whose favor is to them the\r\nbreath of life. \"She will find that _that_ won't go down here,\" was the\r\ncomment of an old woman on a Mississippi steamboat, when told that the\r\nplain, deaf stranger, who seemed the focus of general interest, was Miss\r\nMartineau, the celebrated Unitarian; and in so saying she gave\r\nexpression to a feeling which pervades and governs many if not most\r\ncommunities. I doubt whether the social intolerance of adverse opinions\r\nis more vehement anywhere else than throughout the larger portion of our\r\nown country. I have repeatedly been stung by the receipt of letters\r\ngravely informing me that my course and views on a current topic were\r\nadverse to public opinion: the writers evidently assuming, as a matter\r\nof course, that I was a mere jumping-jack, who only needed to know what\r\nother people thought to insure my instant and abject conformity to their\r\nprejudices. Very often, in other days, I was favored with letters from\r\nindignant subscribers, who, dissenting from my views on some question,\r\ntook this method of informing me that they should no longer take my\r\njournal--a superfluous trouble, which could only have meant dictation or\r\ninsult, since they had only to refrain from renewing their\r\nsubscriptions, and their _Tribune_ would stop coming, whenever they\r\nshould have received what we owed them; and it would in no case stop\r\ntill then. That a journalist was in any sense a public teacher--that he\r\nnecessarily had convictions, and was not likely to suppress them because\r\nthey were not shared by others--in short, that his calling was other and\r\nhigher than that of a waiter at a restaurant, expected to furnish\r\nwhatever was called for, so long as the pay was forthcoming--these\r\nex-subscribers had evidently not for one moment suspected. That such\r\npersons have little or no capacity to insult, is very true; and yet, a\r\nman is somewhat degraded in his own regard by learning that his vocation\r\nis held in such low esteem by others. The true farmer is proudly aware\r\nthat it is quite otherwise with _his_ pursuit--that no one expects him\r\nto swallow any creed, support any party, or defer to any prejudice, as a\r\ncondition precedent to the sale of his products. Hence, I feel that it\r\nis easier and more natural in his pursuit than in any other for a man to\r\nwork for a living, and aspire to success and consideration, without\r\nsacrificing self-respect, compromising integrity, or ceasing to be\r\nessentially and thoroughly a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.\r\n\r\nA LESSON OF TO-DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current season is quite commonly characterized as the coldest, the\r\nhottest, the wettest, or the dryest, that was ever known. Men\r\nundoubtingly assert that they never knew a Summer so hot, or a Winter so\r\ncold, when in fact several such have occurred within the cycle of their\r\nexperience. Hardly anything else is so easily or so speedily forgotten\r\nas extremes of temperature or inclemencies of weather, after they have\r\npassed away. I presume there have been six to ten Summers, since the\r\nbeginning of this century, as hot and as dry as that of 1870; yet the\r\nfact remains that, throughout the Eastern section of our country, to say\r\nnothing of the rest, the heat and drouth of the current Summer have been\r\nquite remarkable. For two months past, counting from the 10th of June,\r\nnearly every day has been a hot one, with blazing sunshine throughout,\r\nrarely interrupted and slightly modified by infrequent and inadequate\r\nshowers; and, as a general result of this tropical fervor, the earth is\r\nparched and baked from ten to forty inches from the surface; streams\r\nand ponds are dried up or shrunk to their lowest dimensions; forests are\r\noften ravaged and desolated by fires; our pastures are dry and brown;\r\nwhile crops of Hay, Oats, Potatoes, Buckwheat, etc., either have proved,\r\nor certainly must prove, a disappointment to the hopes of the growers. I\r\nestimate the average product for 1870 of the farms of New-England,\r\neastern New-York and New-Jersey, as not more than two-thirds of a full\r\nharvest; while the earth remains at this moment so baked and incrusted\r\nthat several days' rain is needed to fit it for Fall plowing and the\r\nsowing of Winter grain.\r\n\r\nSuch seasons must not be regarded as extraordinary. The Summer of 1854\r\nwas nearly or quite as dry as this; and I presume one or two such have\r\nintervened since that time. The heat of 1870 is remarkable for its\r\npersistence rather than its intensity. Every Summer has its heated term;\r\nthat of 1870 has been longer in this region than any before it that I\r\ncan remember, though doubtless the recollection of others might supply\r\nits perfect counterpart. Nearly every Summer has its drouth; the present\r\nis peculiar rather for its early commencement than its extreme duration.\r\nAs our country is more and more denuded of its primitive forests,\r\ndrouths longer and severer even than this may naturally be expected.\r\nWhat our farmers have to do is, to prepare for and provide against them.\r\n\r\nSuch seasons are disastrous to those only who farm as if none such were\r\nto be expected. Those who plow deeply, fertilize bountifully, and\r\ncultivate thoroughly, need not fear them, as fields of Hay and Oats\r\nalready harvested, and of Corn and Potatoes now hastening to maturity in\r\nalmost every township of the suffering region, abundantly attest. I\r\ndoubt that more luxuriant crops of Corn, Tobacco, or Onions, were ever\r\ngrown on the bottom-lands of the Connecticut Valley than may be seen\r\nthere to-day, with failures all about them, and under drouth so fierce\r\nthat Blackberries and Whortleberries are withered when half grown; even\r\nthe bushes in some cases perishing for lack of moisture.\r\n\r\nMy last trip took me along the banks of the upper Hudson, through the\r\nrugged county of Warren, N. Y. The narrow, irregular intervale of this\r\nmountain stream appear to have been cultivated for the last fifty or\r\nsixty years by a hardy race, who look mainly to the timber of the wild\r\nregion north of them for a subsistence. In such a district, whatever\r\nministers to the sustenance of man or beast bears a high price; and\r\nCorn, Rye, Oats, Buckwheat, Apples and Grass, are grown wherever the\r\nsoil is not too rugged or too sterile for culture. I presume half a crop\r\nof Hay has been secured throughout this valley, with perhaps a full crop\r\nof Rye where Rye was sown; but of Oats the yield will be considerably\r\nless than that, while of Corn and Buckwheat it will range from ten\r\nbushels per acre down to nothing. When I, last Summer, passed through\r\nspacious field after field of Corn in Virginia that would not mature a\r\nsingle ear, I spoke of it as something unknown at the North; but there\r\nare fields planted to Corn, in the upper valley of the Hudson, that will\r\nnot produce a single sound ear, nor one bushel even of the shortest and\r\npoorest \"nubbins;\" and alongside of these are acres of Buckwheat,\r\nblossoming at an average hight of four inches, and not likely to get two\r\ninches higher.\r\n\r\nNow, if this land were so poor or so rocky that good crops could not be\r\nextracted from it, far be it from me to disparage the agriculture\r\nwhereof the results are so meagre; but I am speaking of a river\r\nintervale of considerable natural fertility, from which deep and\r\nthorough cultivation would insure ample harvests, subject only to the\r\ncontingency of early frosts in Autumn. Were these lands fertilized and\r\ncultivated as they might be, and as mine are, they would yield 30\r\nbushels of Rye or 60 of Indian Corn per acre, and would richly repay the\r\nhusbandman's outlay and efforts. Now, I venture to say that all the\r\ngrain I saw growing in the valley of the Hudson through Warren County\r\nwill not return the farmer 75 cents for each day's labor expended\r\nthereon, allowing nothing for the use of the land.\r\n\r\n\"But how shall we obtain fertilizers?\" I am often asked. \"We are poor;\r\nwe can afford to keep but few cattle; Guano, Phosphate, Bones, Lime,\r\netc., are beyond our means. Even if we could pay for them, the cost of\r\ntransportation to our out-of-the-way nooks would be heavy. We cannot\r\ndeal with our lands so bountifully as you do, but must be content to do\r\nas we can.\"\r\n\r\nTo all which I make answer: No man ever lacked fertilizers who kept his\r\neyes wide open and devoted two months of each Fall and Winter to\r\ncollecting and preparing them. Wherever swamp muck may be had, wherever\r\nbogs exist or flags or rushes grow, there are materials which, carted\r\ninto the barn-yard in Autumn or Winter, may be drawn out fertilizers in\r\nseason for Corn-planting next Spring. Wherever a pond or slough dries up\r\nin Summer or Autumn, there is material that may be profitably\r\ntransformed into next year's grass or grain. In the absence of all\r\nthese--and they are seldom very far from one who knows how to look for\r\nthem--rank weeds of all sorts, if cut while green and tender, or forest\r\nleaves, gathered in the Fall, used for litter in the stable, and thence\r\nthrown into the yard, will serve an excellent purpose. Nay, more: I am\r\nconfident that the farmer who lacks these, but has access to a bed or\r\nbank of simple clay, may cart 200 loads of it in November into an\r\nordinary farm-yard, have it trampled into and mixed with his manure in\r\nthe Winter, and draw it out in the Spring, excellently fitted to enrich\r\nhis sandy or gravelly land, and insure him, in connection with deep and\r\nthorough culture, a generous yield of Corn, even in such a season as the\r\npresent. Dr. George B. Loring, the most successful farmer in\r\nMassachusetts, uses naked beach sand in abundance as litter for his 80\r\ncows, mixes it with his manure throughout the Winter, and draws out the\r\ncompound to fertilize his clay meadows in the Spring, with most\r\nsatisfactory results. Depend on it, no man need lack fertilizers who\r\nbegins in season and is willing to work for them.\r\n\r\nAnd yet once more:\r\n\r\nFrom the hills which inclose this valley of the upper Hudson (and from\r\never so many other valleys as well), brooks and rivulets, copious in\r\nSpring, when their waters are surcharged and discolored by the richest\r\njuices of the uplands, pour down in frequent cascades and dance across\r\nthe intervale to be lost in the river. There is scarcely an acre of that\r\nintervale which might not be irrigated from these streams at a very\r\nmoderate outlay of work at the season when work is least pressing: the\r\nwater thus held back by dams being allowed to flow thence gently and\r\nequably across the intervale, conveying not moisture only, but fertility\r\nalso, to every plant growing thereon. I am confident that I passed many\r\nplaces on the upper Hudson, as well as on the Connecticut and\r\nAmmonoosuc, where 100 faithful days' work providing for irrigation would\r\nhave given 100 bushels of grain, or 10 tuns of hay additional this year,\r\nand as much per annum henceforth, at a cost of not more than two days'\r\nwork in each year hereafter.\r\n\r\nFarmers, but above all farmers' sons, think of these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.\r\n\r\nINTELLECT IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a man whose capital consists of the clothes on his back, $5 in his\r\npocket, and an ax over his right shoulder, undertakes to hew for himself\r\na farm out of the primitive forest, he must of course devote some years\r\nto rugged manual labor, or he will fail of success. It is indeed\r\npossible that he should find others, even on the rude outposts of\r\ncivilization, who will hire them to teach school, or serve as county\r\nclerk, or survey lands, or do something else of like nature: thus\r\nenabling him to do his chopping trees, and rolling logs, and breaking up\r\nhis stumpy acres, by proxy; but the fair presumption is that he will\r\nhave to chop and log, and burn off and fence, and break up, by the use\r\nof his own proper muscle; and he must be energetic and frugal, as well\r\nas fortunate, if he gets a comfortable house over his head, with forty\r\narable acres about him, at the end of fifteen years' hard work. If he\r\nhas brains, and has been well educated, he may possibly shorten this\r\nordeal to ten years; but, should he begin by fancying hard work beneath\r\nhim, or his abilities too great to be squandered in bushwhacking, he is\r\nvery likely to come out at the little end of the horn, and, straggling\r\nback to some populous settlement, more needy and seedy than when he set\r\nforth to wrest a farm from the wilderness, declare the pioneer's life\r\none of such dreary, hopeless privation that no one who can read or\r\ncypher ought ever to attempt it.\r\n\r\nA poor man, who undertakes to live by his wits on a farm that he has\r\nbought on credit, is not likely to achieve a brilliant success; but the\r\nfarmer whose hand and brain work in concert will never find nor fancy\r\nhis intellect or his education too good for his calling. He may very\r\noften discover that he wasted months of his school-days on what was\r\nill-adapted to his needs, and of little use in fighting the actual\r\nbattle of life; but he will at the same time have ample reason to lament\r\nthe meagerness and the deficiency of his knowledge.\r\n\r\nI hold our average Common Schools defective, in that they fail to teach\r\nGeology and Chemistry, which in my view are the natural bases of a\r\nsound, practical knowledge of things--knowledge which the farmer, of all\r\nmen, can least afford to miss. However it may be with others, he vitally\r\nneeds to understand the character and constitution of the soil he must\r\ncultivate, the elements of which it is composed, and the laws which\r\ngovern their relations to each other. Instruct him in the higher\r\nmathematics if you will, in logic, in meteorology, in ever so many\r\nlanguages; but not till he shall have been thoroughly grounded in the\r\nsciences which unlock for him the arcana of Nature; for these are\r\nintimately related to all he must do, and devise, and direct, throughout\r\nthe whole course of his active career. Whatever he may learn or dispense\r\nwith, a knowledge of these sciences is among the most urgent of his\r\nlife-long needs.\r\n\r\nHence, I would suggest that a simple, lucid, lively, accurate digest of\r\nthe leading principles and facts in Geology and Chemistry, and their\r\napplication to the practical management of a farm, ought to constitute\r\nthe Reader of the highest class in every Common School, especially in\r\nrural districts. Leave out details and recipes, with directions when to\r\nplant or sow, etc.; for these must vary with climates, circumstances,\r\nand the progress of knowledge; but let the body and bones, so to speak,\r\nof a primary agricultural education be taught in every school, in such\r\nterms and with such clearness as to commend them to the understanding of\r\nevery pupil. I never yet visited a school in which something was not\r\ntaught which might be omitted or postponed in favor of this.\r\n\r\nOut of school and after school, let the young farmer delight in the\r\nliterature illustrative of his calling--I mean the very best of it. Let\r\nhim have few agricultural books; but let these treat of principles and\r\nlaws rather than of methods and applications. Let him learn from these\r\nhow to ascertain by experiment what are the actual and pressing needs of\r\nhis soil, and he will readily determine by reflection and inquiry how\r\nthose needs may be most readily and cheaply satisfied.\r\n\r\nAll the books in the world never of themselves made one good farmer;\r\nbut, on the other hand, no man in this age can be a thoroughly good\r\nfarmer without the knowledge which is more easily and rapidly acquired\r\nfrom books than otherwise. Books are no substitute for open-eyed\r\nobservation and practical experience; but they enable one familiar with\r\ntheir contents to observe with an accuracy, and experiment with an\r\nintelligence, that are unattainable without them. The very farmer who\r\ntells you that he never opened a book which treats of Agriculture, and\r\nnever wants to see one, will ask his neighbor how to grow or cure\r\ntobacco, or hops, or sorgho, or any crop with which he is yet\r\nunacquainted, when the chances are a hundred to one that this particular\r\nneighbor cannot advise him so well as the volume which embodies the\r\nexperience of a thousand cultivators of this very plant instead of\r\nbarely one. A good book treating practically of Agriculture, or of some\r\ndepartment therein, is simply a compendium of the experience of past\r\nages combined with such knowledge as the present generation have been\r\nenabled to add thereto. It may be faulty or defective on some points; it\r\nis not to be blindly confided in, nor slavishly followed--it is to be\r\nmastered, discussed, criticised, and followed so far as its teachings\r\ncoincide with the dictates of science, experience, and common sense. Its\r\ntrue office is suggestion; the good farmer will lean upon and trust it\r\nas an oracle only where his own proper knowledge proves entirely\r\ndeficient.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, it will be generally realized that few men live or have lived\r\nwho cannot find scope and profitable employment for all their intellect\r\non a two-hundred-acre farm. And then the farmer will select the\r\nbrightest of his sons to follow him in the management and cultivation of\r\nthe paternal acres, leaving those of inferior ability to seek fortune in\r\npursuits for which a limited and special capacity will serve, if not\r\nsuffice. And then we shall have an Agriculture worthy of our country and\r\nthe age.\r\n\r\nMeantime, let us make the most of what we have, by diffusing, studying,\r\ndiscussing, criticizing, Liebig's Agricultural Chemistry, Dana's Muck\r\nManual, Waring's Elements, and the books that each treat more especially\r\nof some department of the farmer's art, and so making ourselves\r\nfamiliar, first, with the principles, then with the methods, of\r\nscientific, efficient, successful husbandry. Let us, who love it, treat\r\nAgriculture as the elevated, ennobling pursuit it might and should be,\r\nand thus exalt it in the estimation of the entire community.\r\n\r\nWe may, at all events, be sure of this: Just so fast and so far as\r\nfarming is rendered an intellectual pursuit, it will attract and retain\r\nthe strongest minds, the best abilities, of the human race. It has been\r\nwidely shunned and escaped from, mainly because it has seemed a calling\r\nin which only inferior capacities were required or would be rewarded.\r\nLet this error give place to the truth, and Agriculture will win\r\nvotaries from among the brightest intellects of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.\r\n\r\nSHEEP AND WOOL-GROWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOurs is eminently an agricultural country. We produce most of our Food,\r\nand export much more than we import of both Grain and Meat. Of Cotton,\r\nwe grow some Three Millions of bales annually, whereof we export fully\r\ntwo-thirds. But of this we reimport a portion in the shape of Fabrics\r\nand of Thread; and yet, while we are largely clothed in Woolens, and\r\nextensive sections of our country are admirably adapted to the rearing\r\nof Sheep and the production of Wool, we not only import a considerable\r\nshare of the Woolens in which we are clad, but we also import a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the Wool wherefrom we manufacture the Woolens\r\nfabricated on our own soil. In other words: while we are a nation of\r\nfarmers and herdsmen, we fail to grow so much Wool as is needed to\r\nshield us against the caprices and inclemencies of our diverse but\r\ngenerally fitful climates.\r\n\r\nThere is a seeming excuse for this in the fact that extensive regions in\r\nSouth America and Australia, are devoted to Sheep-growing where animals\r\nare neither housed nor herded, and where they are exclusively fed, at\r\nall seasons, on those native grasses which are the spontaneous products\r\nof the soil. I presume Wool is in those regions produced cheaper than it\r\ncan permanently be on any considerable area of our own soil; and yet I\r\nbelieve that the United States should, and profitably might, grow as\r\nmuch Wool as is needed for their own large annual consumption. Here are\r\nmy reasons:\r\n\r\nI. When the predominant interest of British Manufactures constrained the\r\nentire repeal of the duties on imported Wool, whereby Sheep-growing had\r\npreviously been protected, the farmers apprehended that they must\r\nabandon that department of their industry; but the event proved this\r\ncalculation a mistake. They grow more Sheep and at better profit to-day\r\nthan they did when their Wool brought a higher price under the influence\r\nof Protective duties, because the largely increased price of their\r\nMutton more than makes up to them their loss by the reduced prices of\r\ntheir Wool. So, while I do not expect that American Wool will ever again\r\ncommand such high prices as it has done at some periods in the past, I\r\nam confident that the general appreciation in the prices of Meat, which\r\nhas occurred within the last ten or fifteen years, and which seems\r\nlikely to be enduring, will render Sheep-growing more profitable in the\r\nfuture than it has been in the past. At all events, while our farmers\r\nare generally obliged to sell their Grain and Meat at prices somewhat\r\nbelow the range of the British markets, it is hardly conceivable that\r\nthey should not afford to grow Wool, for which they receive higher\r\naverage prices than the British farmers do, who feed their Sheep on the\r\nproduce of lands worth from $300 to $500 (gold) per acre.\r\n\r\nII. Interest being relatively high in this country, and Capital with\r\nmost farmers deficient, it is a serious objection to cattle-growing that\r\nthe farmer must wait three or four years before receiving a return for\r\nhis outlay. If he begins poor, with but a few cows and a team, he\r\nnaturally wants to rear and keep all his calves for several years in\r\norder to adequately stock his farm, so that little or no income is\r\nmeantime realized from his herd; whereas a flock of Sheep yields a\r\nfleece per head each year, though not even a lamb is sold, while its\r\nincrease in numbers is far more rapid than that of a herd of cattle.\r\n\r\nIII. Almost every farmer, at least in the old States, finds some part of\r\nhis land infested with bushes and briers, which seem to flourish by\r\ncutting, if he finds time to cut them, and which the ruggedness of his\r\nsoil precludes his exterminating by the plow. In every such case, Sheep\r\nare his natural allies--his unpaid police--his vigilant and\r\nthorough-going assistants. Give them an even start in Spring with the\r\nbushes and briers; let their number be sufficient; and they are very\r\nsure to come out ahead in the Fall.\r\n\r\nIV. Our farmers in the average are too much confined in Summer and\r\nAutumn to salt meats, and especially to Pork. However excellent in\r\nquality these may be, their exclusive use is neither healthful nor\r\npalatable. With a good flock of Sheep, the most secluded farmer may have\r\nfresh meat every week in haying and harvest-time if he chooses; and he\r\nwill find this better for his family, and more satisfactory to his\r\nworkmen, than a diet wherefrom fresh meat is excluded.\r\n\r\nV. Now, I do not insist that every farmer should grow Sheep, for I know\r\nthat many are so situated that they cannot. In stony regions, where\r\nwalls are very generally relied on for fences, I am aware that Sheep are\r\nwith difficulty kept within bounds; and this is a serious objection. In\r\nthe neighborhood of cities and large villages, where Fresh Meat may be\r\nbought from day to day, one valid reason for keeping them has no\r\napplication; yet I hold that twice as many of our farmers as now have\r\nflocks ought to have them, and would thereby increase their profits as\r\nwell as the comfort of their families.\r\n\r\nThe most serious obstacle to Sheep husbandry in this country is the\r\nabundance and depredations of dogs. Farmers by tens of thousands have\r\nsold off, or killed off, their flocks, mainly because they could not\r\notherwise protect themselves against their frequent decimation by\r\nprowling curs, which were not worth the powder required to shoot them.\r\nIt seems to me that a farmer thus despoiled is perfectly justifiable in\r\nplacing poisoned food where these cut-throats will be apt to find it\r\nwhile making their next raid on his Sheep. I should have no scruple in\r\nso doing, provided I could guard effectually against the poisoning of\r\nany other than the culprits.\r\n\r\nIn a well-settled, thrifty region, where ample barns are provided, I\r\njudge that the losses of Sheep by dogs may be reduced to a minimum by\r\nproper precautions. Elsewhere than in wild, new frontier settlements,\r\nevery flock of Sheep should have a place of refuge beneath the hay-floor\r\nof a good barn, and be trained to spend every night there, as well as to\r\nseek this shelter against every pelting storm. Even if sent some\r\ndistance to pasture, an unbarred lane should connect such pasture with\r\ntheir fold; and they should be driven home for a few nights, if\r\nnecessary, until they had acquired the habit of coming home at\r\nnightfall; and I am assured that Sheep thus lodged will very rarely be\r\nattacked by dogs or wolves.\r\n\r\nAs yet, our farmers have not generally realized that enhancement of the\r\nvalue of Mutton, whereby their British rivals have profited so largely.\r\nTheir fathers began to breed Sheep when a fleece sold for much more than\r\na carcase, and when fineness and abundance of Wool were the main\r\nconsideration. But such is no longer the fact, at least in the Eastern\r\nand Middle States. To-day, large and long-wooled Sheep of the Cotswold\r\nand similar breeds are grown with far greater profit in this section\r\nthan the fine-wooled Merino and Saxony, except where choice specimens of\r\nthe latter can be sold at high prices for removal to Texas and the Far\r\nWest. The growing of these high-priced animals must necessarily be\r\nconfined to few hands. The average farmer cannot expect to sell bucks at\r\n$1,000, and even at $5,000, as some have been sold, or at least\r\nreported. He must calculate that his Sheep are to be sold, when sold at\r\nall, at prices ranging from $10 down to $5, if not lower, so that\r\nmechanics and merchants may buy and eat them without absolute ruin; and\r\nhe must realize that 100 pounds of Mutton at 10 cents, with 6 pounds of\r\nWool at 30 cents, amount to more than 60 pounds of Mutton at 8 cents,\r\nand 10 pounds of Wool at 60 cents. Farmers who grow Sheep for Mutton in\r\nthis vicinity, and manage to have lambs of good size for sale in June or\r\nJuly, assure me that their profit on these is greater than on almost\r\nanything else their farms will produce; and they say what they know.\r\n\r\nThe satisfactory experience of this class may be repeated to-day in the\r\nneighborhood of any considerable city in the Union. Sheep-growing is no\r\nexperiment; it is an assured and gratifying success with all who\r\nunderstand and are fitly placed for its prosecution. Wool may never\r\nagain be so high as we have known it, since the Far West and Texas can\r\ngrow it very cheaply, while its transportation costs less than five per\r\ncent. of its value, where that of Grain would be 75 per cent.; but\r\nMutton is a wholesome and generally acceptable meat, whereof the use and\r\npopularity, are daily increasing; so that its market value will\r\ndoubtless be greater in the future than it has been in the past. I would\r\ngladly incite the farmers of our country to comprehend this fact, and\r\nact so as to profit by it.\r\n\r\nBut the new region opened to Sheep-growing by the pioneers of Colorado,\r\nand other Territories, is destined to play a great part in the\r\nsatisfaction of our need of Wool. The elevated Plains and Valleys which\r\nenfold and embrace the Rocky Mountains are exceedingly favorable to the\r\ncheap production of Wool. Their pure, dry, bracing atmosphere; the\r\nrarity of their drenching storms; the fact that their soil is seldom or\r\nnever sodden with water; and the excellence of their short, thin\r\ngrasses, even in Winter, render them admirably adapted to the wants of\r\nthe shepherd and his flocks. I do not believe in the wisdom or humanity,\r\nwhile I admit the possibility, of keeping Sheep without cured fodder on\r\nthe Plains or elsewhere; on the contrary, I would have ample and\r\neffective shelter against cold and wet provided for every flock, with\r\nHay, or Grain, or Roots, or somewhat of each of them, for at least two\r\nmonths of each year; but, even thus, I judge that fine Wool can be grown\r\nin Colorado or Wyoming far cheaper than in New England or even\r\nMinnesota, and of better quality than in Texas or South America. And I\r\nam grievously mistaken if Sheep husbandry is not about to be developed\r\non the Plains with a rapidity and success which have no American\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV.\r\n\r\nACCOUNTS IN FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers, it is urged, sometimes fail; and this is unfortunately true of\r\nthem, as of all others. Some fail in integrity; others in sobriety; many\r\nin capacity; most in diligence; but not a few in method or system. Quite\r\na number fail because they undertake too much at the outset; that is,\r\nthey run into debt for more land than they have capital to stock or\r\nmeans to fertilize, and are forced into bankruptcy by the interest\r\never-accruing upon land which they are unable to cultivate. If they\r\nshould get ahead a little by active exertion throughout the day, the\r\ninterest would overtake and pass them during the ensuing night.\r\n\r\nFew of the unsuccessful realize the extent to which their ill fortune is\r\nfairly attributable to their own waste of time. Men not naturally lazy\r\nsquander hours weekly in the village, or at the railroad station,\r\nwithout a suspicion that they are thus destroying their chances of\r\nsuccess in life. To-day is given up to a monkey-show; half of to-morrow\r\nis lost in attendance on an auction; part of next day is spent at a\r\ncaucus or a jury trial; and so on until one-third of the year is\r\nvirtually wasted.\r\n\r\nNow, the men who have achieved eminent success, within my observation,\r\nhave all been rigid economists of time. They managed to transact their\r\nbusiness at the county-seat while serving there as grand or petit\r\njurors, or detained under subpoena as witnesses; they never attended\r\nan auction unless they really needed something which was there to be\r\nsold, and then they began their day's work earlier and ended it later in\r\norder to redeem the time which they borrowed for the sale. I do not\r\nbelieve that any American farmer who could count up three hundred full\r\ndays' work in every year between his twenty-first and his thirtieth ever\r\nyet failed, except as a result of speculation, or endorsing, or\r\ninordinate running into debt.\r\n\r\nI would, therefore, urge every farmer to keep a rigid account current of\r\nthe disposal of his time, so as to be able to see at the year's end\r\nexactly how many days thereof he had given to productive labor; how many\r\nto such abiding improvements as fencing and draining; and how many to\r\nobjects which neither increased his crop nor improved his farm. I am\r\nsure many would be amazed at the extent of this last category.\r\n\r\nIf every youth who expects to live by farming would buy a cheap\r\npocket-book or wallet which contains a diary wherein a page is allotted\r\nto each day of the year, and would, at the close of that day, or at\r\nleast while its incidents were still fresh in his mind, set down under\r\nits proper head whatever incidents were most noteworthy--as, for\r\ninstance, a soaking rain; a light or heavy shower; a slight or killing\r\nfrost; a fall of snow; a hurricane; a hail-storm; a gale; a decidedly\r\nhot or notably cold temperature; the turning out of cattle to pasture or\r\nsheltering them against the severity of Winter; also the planting or\r\nsowing of each crop or field, and whether harm was done to it by frost\r\nin its infancy or when it approached maturity--he would thus provide\r\nhimself with annual volumes of fact which would prove instructive and\r\nvaluable throughout his maturer years.\r\n\r\nThe good farmer will of course keep accounts with such of his neighbors\r\nas he sees fit to deal with; and he ought to charge a lent or credit a\r\nborrowed plow, harrow, reaper, log-chain, or other implement, precisely\r\nas though it were meal or meat of an equal value. I judge that borrowed\r\nimplements, if regularly charged at cost, and credited at their actual\r\nvalue when returned, would generally come home sooner and in better\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nBut the farmer, like every one else, should be most careful to keep debt\r\nand credit with himself and his farm. If a dollar is spent or lent, his\r\nbooks should show it; and let items and sum total stare him in the face\r\nwhen he strikes a balance at the close of the year. If there has been no\r\nleakage either of dimes or of hours, he will seldom be poorer on the\r\n31st of December than he was on the 1st of the preceding January.\r\n\r\nMost farmers fail to keep accounts with their several fields and crops;\r\nyet what could be more instructive than these? Here are ten acres of\r\nCorn, with a yield of 20 to 40 bushels per acre--a like area and like\r\nyield of Oats; a smaller or larger of Rye, Buckwheat, or Beans, as the\r\ncase may be. If the produce is sold, most farmers know how much it\r\nbrings; but how many know how much it cost? Say the Corn brings 75 cents\r\nper bushel, and the Oats 50 cents: was either or both produced at a\r\nprofit? If so, at what profit? Here is a farmer who has grown from 100\r\nto 800 bushels of Corn per annum for the last 20 years; ought he not to\r\nknow by this time what Corn costs him in the average, and whether it\r\ncould or could not with profit give place to something else? Most\r\nfarmers grow some crops at a profit, others at a loss; ought they not to\r\nknow, after an experience of five or ten years, what crops have put\r\nmoney into their pockets, and what have made them poorer for the\r\ngrowing?\r\n\r\nOf course, there is complication and some degree of uncertainty in all\r\nsuch account-keeping; for every one is aware that some crops take more\r\nfrom the soil than others, and so leave it in a worse condition for\r\nthose that are to follow, and that some exact large reenforcements of\r\nfertilizers, whereof a part only is fairly chargeable to the first\r\nensuing product, while a large share inures to the subsequent harvests.\r\nEach must judge for himself how much is to be credited for such\r\nimprovement, and how much charged against other crops for\r\ndeterioration. He, for example, whose meadows will cut from two to three\r\ntuns per acre of good English Hay may generally sell that Hay for twice\r\nif not thrice the immediate cost of its production, and so seem to be\r\nrealizing a large profit; but, if he gives nothing to the soil in return\r\nfor the heavy draft thus made upon it, his crop will dwindle year by\r\nyear, until it will hardly pay for cutting; and the diminution in value\r\nof his meadows will nearly or quite balance the seeming profit accruing\r\nfrom his Hay. But account-keeping in every business involves essentially\r\nidentical calculations; and the merchant who this year makes no net\r\nprofit on his goods, but doubles the number of his customers and the\r\nextent of his trade, has thriven precisely as has the farmer whose\r\nprofit on his crops has all been invested in drains permeating his bogs,\r\nand in Lime, Plaster, and other fertilizers, applied to and permanently\r\nenriching his dryer fields.\r\n\r\n\"To make each day a critic on the last,\" was the aspiration of a wise\r\nman, if not a great poet. So the farmer who will keep careful and candid\r\naccounts With himself, annually correcting his estimates by the light of\r\nexperience, will soon learn what crops he may reasonably expect to grow\r\nat a profit, and to reject such as are likely to involve him in loss;\r\nand he who, having done this, shall blend common sense with industry,\r\nwill have no reason to complain thereafter that there is no profit in\r\nfarming, and no chance of achieving wealth by pursuing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI.\r\n\r\nSTONE ON A FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis earth, geologists say, was once an immense expanse of heated vapor,\r\nwhich, gradually cooling at its surface, as it whirled and sped through\r\nspace, contracted and formed a crust, which we know as Rock or Stone.\r\nThis crust has since been broken through, and tilted up into ranges of\r\nmountains and hills, by the action of internal fires, by the\r\ntransmutation of solid bodies into more expansive gases; and the\r\nfragments torn away from the sharper edges of upheaved masses of\r\ngranite, quartz, or sandstone, having been frozen into iceberg,\r\nfloating, or soon to be so, have been carried all over the surface of\r\nour planet, and dropped upon the greater part, as those icebergs were\r\nultimately resolved, by a milder temperature, into flowing water. When\r\nthe seas were afterward reduced nearly or quite to their present limits,\r\nand the icebergs restricted to the frigid zones and their vicinity,\r\nstreams had to make their way down the sides of the mountains and hills\r\nto the subjacent valleys and plains, sweeping along not merely sand and\r\ngravel, but bowlders also, of every size and form, and sometimes great\r\nrocks as well, by the force of their impetuous currents. And, as a very\r\nlarge, if not the larger portion of our earth's surface bears testimony\r\nto the existence and powerful action through ages, of larger and smaller\r\nwater-courses, a wide and general diffusion of stones, not in place, but\r\nmore or less triturated, smoothed, and rounded, by the action of water,\r\nwas among the inevitable results.\r\n\r\nThese stones are sometimes a facility, but oftener an impediment, to\r\nefficiency in agriculture. When heated by fervid sunshine throughout the\r\nday, they retain a portion of that heat through a part of the succeeding\r\nnight, thereby raising the temperature of the soil, and increasing the\r\ndeposit of dew on the plants there growing. When generally broken so\r\nfinely as to offer no impediment to cultivation, they not merely absorb\r\nheat by day, to be given off by night, but, by rendering the soil open\r\nand porous, secure a much more extensive diffusion of air through it\r\nthan would otherwise be possible. Thus do slaty soils achieve and\r\nmaintain a warmth unique in their respective latitudes, so as to ripen\r\ngrapes further North, and at higher elevations, than would otherwise be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe great Prairies of the West, with a considerable portion of the\r\nvalleys and plains of the Atlantic slope, expose no rock at their\r\nsurfaces, and little beneath them, until the soil has been traversed,\r\nand the vicinity of the underlying rock in place fairly attained. To\r\nfarmers inured to the perpetual stone-picking of New-England, and other\r\nhilly regions, this is a most welcome change; but when the pioneer comes\r\nto look about him for stone to wall his cellar and his well, to underpin\r\nhis barn, and form the foundations of his dwelling, he realizes that the\r\nbowlders he had exulted in leaving behind him were not wholly and\r\nabsolutely a nuisance; glad as he was to be rid of them forever, he\r\nwould like now to call some of them back again.\r\n\r\nYet, the Eastern farmer of to-day has fewer uses for stone than his\r\ngrandfather had. He does not want his farm cut up into two or three-acre\r\npatches, by broad-based, unsightly walls, which frost is apt to heave\r\nyear after year into greater deformity and less efficiency; nor does he\r\ncare longer to use them in draining, since he must excavate and replace\r\nthrice as much earth in making a stone as in making a tile drain; while\r\nthe former affords shelter and impunity to rats, mice, and other\r\nmischievous, predatory animals, whose burrowing therein tends constantly\r\nto stimulate its natural tendency to become choked with sand and earth.\r\nOf the stone drains, constructed through parts of my farm by foremen\r\nwhose wills proved stronger than my own, but two remain in partial\r\noperation, and I shall rejoice when these shall have filled themselves\r\nup and been counted out evermore. Happily, they were sunk so low that\r\nthe subsoil plow will never disturb them.\r\n\r\nStill, my confidence that nothing was made in vain is scarcely shaken by\r\nthe prevalence and abundance of stone on our Eastern farms. We may not\r\nhave present use for them all; but our grandsons will be wiser than we,\r\nand have uses for them which we hardly suspect. I reinsist that land\r\nwhich is very stony was mainly created with an eye to timber-growing,\r\nand that millions of acres of such ought forthwith to be planted with\r\nHickory, White Oak, Locust, Chestnut, White Pine, and other valuable\r\nforest-trees. Every acre of thoroughly dry land, lying near a railroad,\r\nin the Eastern or Middle States, may be made to pay a good interest on\r\nfrom $50 up to $100, provided there be soil enough above its rocks to\r\nafford a decent foothold for trees; and how little will answer this\r\npurpose none can imagine who have not seen the experiment tried. Sow\r\nthickly, that you may begin to cut out poles six to ten feet long within\r\nthree or four years, and _keep_ cutting out (but never cutting off)\r\nthenceforward, until time shall be no more, and your rocky crests, steep\r\nhillsides and ravines, will take rank with the most productive portions\r\nof your farm.\r\n\r\nIn the edges of these woods, you may deposit the surplus stones of the\r\nadjacent cultivated fields, in full assurance that moth and rust will\r\nnot corrupt nor thieves break through and steal, but that you and your\r\nsons and grandsons will find them there whenever they shall be needed,\r\nas well as those you found there when you came into possession of the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nI am further confident that we shall build more and more with rough,\r\nunshapen stone, as we grow older and wiser. In our harsh, capricious\r\nclimate, walls of stone-concrete afford the cheapest and best protection\r\nalike against heat and frost, for our animals certainly, and, I think,\r\nalso for ourselves. Let the farmer begin his barn by making of stone,\r\nlaid in thin mortar, a substantial basement story; let into a hillside,\r\nfor his manure and his root-cellar; let him build upon this a second\r\nstory of like materials for the stalls of his cattle; and now he may add\r\na third story and roof of wood for his bay and grain, if he sees fit.\r\nHis son or grandson will, probably, take this off, and replace it with\r\nconcrete walls and a slate roof; or this may be postponed until the\r\noriginal wooden structure has rotted off; but I feel sure that,\r\nultimately, the dwellings as well as barns of thrifty farmers, in stony\r\ndistricts, will mainly be built of rough stone, thrown into a box and\r\nfirmly cemented by a thin mortar composed of much sand and little lime;\r\nand that thus at least ten thousand tuns of stone to each farm will be\r\ndisposed of. It may be somewhat later still before our barn-yards, fowl\r\ninclosures, gardens, pig-pens, etc., will be shut in by cemented walls;\r\nbut the other sort affords such ample and perpetual lurking places for\r\nrats, minks, weasels, and all manner of destructive vermin, that they\r\nare certain to go out of fashion before the close of the next century.\r\n\r\nAs to blasting out Stone, too large or too firmly fixed to be otherwise\r\nhandled, I would solve the problem by asking, \"Do you mean to keep this\r\nlot in cultivation?\" If you do, clear it of stone from the surface\r\nupward, and for at least two feet downward, though they be as large as\r\nhaycocks, and as fixed as the everlasting hills. Clear your field of\r\nevery stone bigger than a goose egg, that the Plow or the Mower may\r\nstrike in doing its work, or give it up to timber, plant it thoroughly,\r\nand leave its stones unmolested until you or your descendants shall have\r\na paying use for them.\r\n\r\nA friend deeply engaged in lumbering gives me a hint, which I think some\r\nowners of stony farms will find useful. He is obliged to run his logs\r\ndown shallow, stony creeks, from the bottom of which large rocks often\r\nprotrude, arresting the downward progress of his lumber. When the beds\r\nof these creeks are nearly dry in Summer, he goes in, with two or three\r\nstout, strong assistants, armed with crowbars and levers, and rolls the\r\nstones to this side and that, so as to leave a clear passage for his\r\nlogs. Occasionally, he is confronted by a big fellow, which defies his\r\nutmost force; when, instead of drilling and blasting, he gathers dead\r\ntree-tops, and other dry wood of no value, from the banks, and builds a\r\nhot fire on the top of each giant bowlder. When the fire has burned out,\r\nand the rock has cooled, he finds it softened, and, as it were, rotten,\r\non the top, often split, and every way so demoralized that he can deal\r\nwith it as though it were chalk or cheese. He estimates his saving by\r\nthis process, as compared with drilling and blasting as much more than\r\nfifty per cent. I trust farmers with whom wood is abundant, and big\r\nstones superabundant, will give this simple device a trial. Powder and\r\ndrilling cost money, part of which may be saved by this expedient.\r\n\r\nI have built some stone walls--at first, not very well; but for the last\r\nten years my rule has been: Very little fence on a farm, but that little\r\nof a kind that asks no forbearance of the wildest bull that ever wore a\r\nhorn. The last wall I built cost me at least $5 per rod; and it is worth\r\nthe money. Beginning by plowing its bed and turning the two furrows\r\ntogether, so as to raise the ground a foot, and make a shallow ditch on\r\neither side, I built a wall thereon which will outlast my younger child.\r\nAn ordinary wall dividing a wood on the north from an open field of\r\nsunny, gravelly loam on the south, would have been partly thrown down\r\nand wholly twisted out of shape in a few years, by the thawing of the\r\nearth under its sunny side, while it remained firm as a rock on the\r\nnorth; but the ground is always dry under my entire wall; so nothing\r\nfreezes there, and there is consequently nothing to thaw and let down my\r\nwall. I shall be sorely disappointed if that wall does not outlast my\r\nmemory, and be known as a thorough barrier to roving cattle long after\r\nthe name of its original owner shall have been forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.\r\n\r\nFENCES AND FENCING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough I have already indicated, incidentally, my decided objections to\r\nour prevalent system of Fencing, I deem the subject of such importance\r\nthat I choose to discuss it directly. Excessive Fencing is peculiarly an\r\nAmerican abuse, which urgently cries for reform.\r\n\r\nSolon Robinson says the fence-tax is the heaviest of our farmer's taxes.\r\nI add, that it is the most needless and indefensible.\r\n\r\nHighways we must have, and people must traverse them; but this gives\r\nthem no right to trample down or otherwise injure the crops growing on\r\neither side. In France, and other parts of Europe, you see grass and\r\ngrain growing luxuriantly up to the very edge of the beaten tracks, with\r\nnothing like a fence between them. Yet those crops are nowise injured or\r\ndisturbed by wayfarers. Whoever chooses to impel animals along these\r\nroads must take care to have them completely under subjection, and must\r\nsee that they do no harm to whatever grows by the wayside.\r\n\r\nIn this country, cattle-driving, except on a small scale, and for short\r\ndistances, has nearly been superceded by railroads. The great droves\r\nformerly reaching the Atlantic seaboard on foot, from Ohio or further\r\nWest, are now huddled into cars and hurried through in far less time,\r\nand with less waste of flesh; but they reach us fevered, bruised, and\r\nevery way unwholesome. Every animal should be turned out to grass, after\r\na railroad journey of more than twelve hours, and left there a full\r\nmonth before he is taken to the slaughter-pen. We must have many more\r\ndeaths per annum in this city than if the animals on which we subsist\r\nwere killed in a condition which rendered them fit for human food.\r\n\r\nUltimately, our fresh Beef, Mutton and Pork, will come to us from the\r\nPrairies in refrigerating cars: each animal having been killed while in\r\nperfect health, unfevered and untortured by days of cramped, galled, and\r\nthirsty suffering, on the cars. This will leave their offal, including a\r\nlarge portion of their bones, to enrich the fields whence their\r\nsustenance was drawn and from which they should never be taken. The cost\r\nof transporting the meat, hides, and tallow, in such cars, would be less\r\nthan that of bringing through the animals on their legs; while the\r\ndanger of putrefaction might be utterly precluded.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Fencing:\r\n\r\nOur growing plants must be preserved from animal ravage; but it is most\r\nunjust to impose the cost of this protection on the growers. Whoever\r\nchooses to rear or buy animals must take care that they do not infest\r\nand despoil his neighbors. Whoever sees fit to turn animals into the\r\nstreet, should send some one with them who will be sure to keep them out\r\nof mischief, which browsing young trees in a forest clearly is.\r\n\r\nIf the inhabitants of a settlement or village surrounded by open\r\nprairie, see fit to pasture their cattle thereon, they should send them\r\nout each morning in the charge of a well-mounted herdsmen, whose duty\r\nshould be summed up in keeping them from evildoing by day and bringing\r\nthem safely back to their yard or yards at nightfall.\r\n\r\nFencing bears with special severity on the pioneer class, who are least\r\nable to afford the outlay. The \"clearing\" of the pioneer's first year in\r\nthe wilderness, being enlarged by ax and fire, needs a new and far\r\nlonger environment next year; and so through subsequent years until\r\nclearing is at an end. Many a pioneer is thus impelled to devote a large\r\nshare of his time to Fencing; and yet his crops often come to grief\r\nthrough the depredations of his own or his neighbor's breachy cattle.\r\n\r\nFences produce nothing but unwelcome bushes, briers and weeds. So far as\r\nthey may be necessary, they are a deplorable necessity. When constructed\r\nwhere they are not really needed, they evince costly folly. I think I\r\ncould point out farms which would not sell to-day for the cost of\r\nrebuilding their present fences.\r\n\r\nWe cannot make open drains or ditches serve for fences in this country,\r\nas they sometimes do in milder and more equable climates, because our\r\nsevere frosts would heave and crumble their banks if nearly\r\nperpendicular, sloping them at length in places so that animals might\r\ncross them at leisure. Nor have we, so far north as this city, had much\r\nsuccess with hedges, for a like reason. There is scarcely a hedge-plant\r\nat once efficient in stopping animals and so hardy as to defy the\r\nseverity, or rather the caprice, of our Winters. I scarcely know a hedge\r\nwhich is not either inefficient or too costly for the average farmer;\r\nand then a hedge is a fixture; whereas we often need to move or demolish\r\nour fences.\r\n\r\nWire Fences are least obnoxious to this objection; they are very easily\r\nremoved; but a careless teamster, a stupid animal, or a clumsy friend,\r\neasily makes a breach in one, which is not so easily repaired. Of the\r\nfew Wire Fences within my knowledge, hardly one has remained entire and\r\nefficient after standing two or three years.\r\n\r\nStone Walls, well built, on raised foundations of dry earth, are\r\nenduring and quite effective, but very costly. My best have cost me at\r\nleast $5 per rod, though the raw material was abundant and accessible. I\r\ndoubt that any good wall is built, with labor at present prices, for\r\nless than $5 per rod. Perhaps I should account this costliness a merit,\r\nsince it must impel farmers to study how to make few fences serve their\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nRail Fences will be constructed only where timber is very abundant, of\r\nlittle value, and easily split. Whenever the burning of timber to be\r\nrid of it has ceased, there the making of rail fences must be near its\r\nend.\r\n\r\nWhere fences must still be maintained, I apprehend that posts and boards\r\nare the cheapest material. Though Pine lumber grows dear, Hemlock still\r\nabounds; and the rapid destruction of trees for their bark to be used in\r\ntanning must give us cheap hemlock boards throughout many ensuing years.\r\nSpruce, Tamarack, and other evergreens from our Northern swamps, will\r\ncome into play after Hemlock shall have been exhausted.\r\n\r\nAs for posts, Red Cedar is a general favorite; and this tree seems to be\r\nrapidly multiplying hereabout. I judge that farmers who have it not,\r\nmight wisely order it from a nursery and give it an experimental trial.\r\nIt is hardy; it is clean; it makes but little shade; and it seems to\r\nfear no insect whatever. It flourishes on rocky, thin soils; and a grove\r\nof it is pleasant to the sight--at least, to mine.\r\n\r\nLocust is more widely known and esteemed; but the borer has proved\r\ndestructive to it on very many farms, though not on mine. I like it\r\nwell, and mean to multiply it extensively by drilling the seed in rich\r\ngarden soil and transplanting to rocky woodland when two years old.\r\nSowing the seed among rocks and bushes I have tried rather extensively,\r\nwith poor success. If it germinates at all, the young tree is so tiny\r\nand feeble that bushes, weeds, and grass, overtop and smother it.\r\n\r\nThat a post set top-end down will last many years longer than if set as\r\nit grew, I do firmly believe, though I cannot attest it from personal\r\nobservation. I understand the reason to be this: Trees absorb or suck up\r\nmoisture from the earth; and the particles which compose them are so\r\ncombined and adjusted as to facilitate this operation. Plant a post\r\ndeeply and firmly in the ground, butt-end downward, and it will continue\r\nto absorb moisture from the earth as it did when alive; and the post,\r\nthus moistened to-day and dried by wind and sun to-morrow, is thereby\r\nsubjected to more rapid disintegration and decay than when reversed.\r\n\r\nMy general conclusion is, that the good farmer will have fewer and\r\nbetter fences than his thriftless neighbor, and that he will study and\r\nplan to make fewer and fewer rods of fence serve his needs, taking care\r\nthat all he retains shall be perfect and conclusive. Breachy cattle are\r\na sad affliction alike to their owner and his neighbor; and shaky,\r\nrotting, tumble-down fences, are justly responsible for their perverse\r\neducation. Let us each resolve to take good care that his own cattle\r\nshall in no case afflict his neighbors, and we shall all need fewer\r\nfences henceforth and evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL EXHIBITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must have attended not less than fifty State or County Fairs for the\r\nexhibition (mainly) of Agricultural Machines and Products. From all\r\nthese, I _should_ have learned something, and presume I did; but I\r\ncannot now say what. Hence, I conclude that these Fairs are not what\r\nthey might and should be. In other words, they should be improved. But\r\nhow?\r\n\r\nAs the people compose much the largest and best part of these shows, the\r\nreform must begin with them. Two-thirds of them go to a Fair with no\r\ndesire to learn therefrom--no belief that they can there be taught\r\nanything. Of course, not seeking, they do not find. If they could but\r\nrealize that a Farmer's Fair might and should teach farmers somewhat\r\nthat would serve them in their vocation, a great point would be gained.\r\nBut they go in quest of entertainment, and find this mainly in\r\nhorse-racing.\r\n\r\nOf all human opportunities for instruction in humility and\r\nself-depreciation, the average public speaker's is the best. He hurries\r\nto a place where he has been told that his presence and utterance are\r\nearnestly and generally desired--perhaps to find that his invitation\r\ncame from an insignificant and odious handful, who had some private ax\r\nto grind so repugnant to the great majority that they refuse to\r\ncountenance the procedure, no matter how great the temptation. Even\r\nwhere there is no such feud, many, having satiated their curiosity by a\r\nlong stare at him, walk whistling off, without waiting or wishing to\r\nhear him. But the speaker at a Fair must compete with a thousand\r\ncounter-attractions, the least of them far more popular and winning than\r\n_he_ can hope to be. He is heard, so far as he is heard at all, in\r\npresence of and competition with all the bellowing bulls, braying,\r\njacks, and squealing stallions, in the county; if he holds,\r\nnevertheless, a quarter of the crowd, he does well: but let two jockeys\r\nstart a buggy-race around the convenient track, and the last auditor\r\nshuts his ears and runs off to enjoy the spectacle. Decidedly, I insist\r\nthat a Fair-ground is poorly adapted to the diffusion of Agricultural\r\nknowledge--that the people present acquire very little information\r\nthere, even when they get all they want.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed to render our annual Fairs useful and instructive far\r\nbeyond precedent, I sum up as follows:\r\n\r\nI. Each farmer in the county or township should hold himself bound to\r\nmake _some_ contribution thereto. If only a good hill of Corn, a peck of\r\nPotatoes, a bunch of Grapes, a Squash, a Melon, let him send that. If he\r\ncan send all of these, so much the better. There is very rarely a\r\nthrifty farmer who could not add to the attractions and merits of a Fair\r\nif he would try. If he could send a coop of superior Fowls, a likely\r\nCalf, or a first-rate Cow, better yet; but nine-tenths of our farmers\r\nregard a Fair as something wherewith they have nothing to do, except as\r\nspectators. When it is half over, they lounge into it with hands in\r\ntheir pockets, stare about for an hour, and go home protesting that they\r\ncould beat nearly everything they saw there. Then why did they not try?\r\nHow can we have good Fairs, if those who might make the best display of\r\nproducts save themselves the trouble by not making any? The average\r\nmeagerness of our Fairs, so generally and justly complained of, is not\r\nthe fault of those who sent what they had, but of those who, having\r\nbetter, were too lazy to send anything. Until this is radically changed,\r\nand the blame fastened on those who might have contributed, but did not,\r\nour Fairs cannot help being generally meager and poor.\r\n\r\nII. It seems to me that there is great need of an interesting and\r\nfaithful running commentary on the various articles exhibited. A\r\ncompetent person should be employed to give an hour's off-hand talk on\r\nthe cattle and horses on hand, explaining the diverse merits and faults\r\nof the several breeds there exhibited, and of the representatives of\r\nthose breeds then present. If any are peculiarly adapted to the\r\nlocality, let that fact be duly set forth, with the simple object of\r\nenabling farmers to breed more intelligently, and more profitably. Then\r\nlet the implements and machinery on exhibition be likewise explained and\r\ndiscussed, and let their superiority in whatever respect to those they\r\nhave superseded or are designed to supersede be clearly pointed out. So,\r\nif there be any new Grain, Vegetable, or Fruit, on the tables, let it be\r\nmade the subject of capable and thoroughly impartial discussion, before\r\nsuch only as choose to listen, and without putting the mere sightseers\r\nto grave inconvenience. A lecture-room should always be attached to a\r\nFair-ground, yet so secluded as to shut out the noise inseparable from a\r\ncrowded exhibition. Here, meetings should be held each evening, for\r\ngeneral discussion; every one being encouraged to state concisely the\r\nimpressions made on him, and the improvements suggested to him, by what\r\nhe had seen. Do let us try to reflect and consider more at these\r\ngatherings, even though at the cost of seeing less.\r\n\r\nIII. The well supported Agricultural Society of a rich and populous\r\ncounty must be able, or should be able, to give two or three liberal\r\npremiums for general proficiency in farming. If $100 could be proffered\r\nto the owner or manager of the best tilled farm in the county, $50 to\r\nthe owner of the best orchard, and $50 to the boy under 18 years of age\r\nwho grew the best acre of Corn or Roots that year, I am confident that\r\nan impulse would thereby be given to agricultural progress. Our premiums\r\nare too numerous and too petty, because so few, are willing to\r\ncontribute with no expectation of personal benefit or distinction. If\r\nwe had but the right spirit aroused, we might dispense with most of our\r\npetty premiums, or replace them by medals of no great cost, and devote\r\nthe money thus saved to higher and nobler ends.\r\n\r\nIV. Much of the speaking at Fairs seems to me insulting to the\r\nintelligence of the Farmers present, who are grossly flattered and\r\neulogized, when they often need to be admonished and incited to mend\r\ntheir ways. What use or sense can there be in a lawyer, doctor, broker,\r\nor editor, talking to a crowd of farmers as if they were the most\r\nfavored of mortals and their life the noblest and happiest known to\r\nmankind? Whatever it might be, and may yet become, we all know that the\r\naverage farmer's life is not what it is thus represented: for, if it\r\nwere, thousands would be rushing into it where barely hundreds left it:\r\nwhereas we all see that the fact is quite otherwise. No good can result\r\nfrom such insincere and extravagant praises of a calling which so few\r\nfreely choose, and so many gladly shun. Grant that the farmer's _ought_\r\nto be the most enviable and envied vocation, we know that in fact it\r\n_is_ not and, agreeing that it should be, the business in hand is to\r\nmake it so. There must be obstacles to surmount, mistakes to set right,\r\nimpediments to overcome, before farming can be in all respects the\r\nidolized pursuit which poets are so ready to proclaim it and orators so\r\ndelight to represent it. Let us struggle to make it all that fancy has\r\never painted it; but, so long as it is not, let us respect undeniable\r\nfacts, and characterize it exactly as it is.\r\n\r\nV. If our counties were thoroughly canvassed by township committees, and\r\neach tiller of the soil asked to pledge himself in writing to exhibit\r\nsomething at the next County Fair, we should soon witness a decided\r\nimprovement. Many would be incited to attend who now stay away; while\r\nthe very general complaint that there is nothing worth coming to see\r\nwould be heard no more. As yet, a majority of farmers regard the Fair\r\nmuch as they do a circus or traveling menagerie, taking no interest in\r\nit except as it may afford them entertainment for the passing hour. We\r\nmust change this essentially; and the first step is to induce, by\r\nconcerted solicitation, at least half the farmers in the county to\r\npledge themselves each to exhibit something at the next annual Fair, or\r\npay $5 toward increasing its premiums.\r\n\r\nVI. In short, we must all realize that the County or Township Fair is\r\n_our_ Fair--not got up by others to invite our patronage or criticism,\r\nbut something whereto it is incumbent on us to contribute, and which\r\nmust be better or worse as we choose to make it. Realizing this, let us\r\nstop carping and give a shoulder to the wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not a scientific farmer; it is not probable that I ever shall be. I\r\nhave no such knowledge of Chemistry and Geology as any man needs to make\r\nhim a thoroughly good farmer. I am quite aware that men have raised good\r\ncrops--a good many of them--who knew nothing of science, and did not\r\nconsider any acquaintance with it conducive to efficiency or success in\r\ntheir vocation. I have no doubt that men will continue to grow such\r\ncrops, and to make money by agriculture, who hardly know what is meant\r\nby Chemistry or Geology; and yet I feel sure that, as the years roll by,\r\nScience will more and more be recognized and accepted as the true,\r\nsubstantial base of efficient and profitable cultivation. Let me here\r\ngive briefly the grounds of this conviction:\r\n\r\nEvery plant is composed of elements whereof a very small portion is\r\ndrawn from the soil, while the ampler residue, so long as the plant\r\ncontinues green and growing, is mainly water, though a variable and\r\noften considerable proportion is imbibed or absorbed from the\r\natmosphere, which is understood to yield freely nearly all the elements\r\nrequired of it, provided the plants are otherwise in healthful and\r\nthrifty condition. Water is supplied from the sky, or from springs and\r\nstreams; and little more than the most ordinary capacity for observation\r\nis required to determine when it is present in sufficient quantity, when\r\nin baleful excess. But who, unaided by Science, can decide whether the\r\nsoil does or does not contain the elements requisite for the luxuriant\r\ngrowth and perfect development of Wheat, or Fruit, or Grass, or Beets,\r\nor Apples? Who knows, save as he blindly infers from results, what\r\nmineral ingredients of this or that crop are deficient in given field,\r\nand what are present in excess? And how shall any one be enlightened and\r\nassured on the point, unless by the aid of Science?\r\n\r\nI have bought and applied to my farm some two thousand bushels of Lime,\r\nand ten or a dozen tuns of Plaster; and I infer, from what seemed to be\r\nresults, that each of these minerals has been applied with profit; but I\r\ndo not _know_ it. The increased product which I have attributed to one\r\nor both of these elements may have had a very different origin and\r\nimpulse. I only grope my way in darkness when I should clearly and\r\nsurely see.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural essayist in Maine has recently put forth a canon which,\r\nif well grounded, is of great value to farmers. He asserts that the\r\ngrowth of acid plants like Sorrel, Dock, etc., in a field, results from\r\nsourness in the soil, and that, where this exists, Lime--that is, the\r\nordinary Carbonate of Lime--is urgently required; whereas the\r\napplication of Plaster or Gypsum (Sulphate of Lime) to that field must\r\nbe useless and wasteful. If such be the truth, a knowledge of it would\r\nbe worth millions of dollars to our farmers. But I lack the scientific\r\nattainment needed to qualify me for passing judgment thereon.\r\n\r\nThere is great diversity of opinion among farmers with regard to the\r\nvalue of Swamp Muck. One has applied it to his land to good purpose; so\r\nhe holds Muck, if convenient, the cheapest and best fertilizer a farmer\r\ncan add to his ordinary barn-yard manure; another has applied cords upon\r\ncords of Muck, and says he has derived therefrom no benefit whatever.\r\nNow, this contrariety of conclusion may result from imperfect judgment\r\non one side or the other, or from the condition precedent of the diverse\r\nsoils: one of them requiring what Muck could supply, while the other\r\nrequired something very different from that; or it may be accounted for\r\nby the fact that the Muck applied in one case was of superior quality,\r\nand in the other good for nothing. Where Muck is composed almost wholly\r\nof the leaves of forest-trees which, through thousands of years, have\r\nbeen blown into a bog, or shallow pond, and there been gradually\r\ntransformed into a fine, black dust or earth, I do not see how it can\r\npossibly be applied to an upland, especially a sandy or gravelly soil,\r\nwithout conducing to the subsequent production of bounteous crops. True,\r\nit may be sour when first drawn from the stagnant pool or bog in which\r\nit has lain so long, and may need to be mixed with Lime, or Salt, or\r\nAshes, and subjected to the action of sun and frost, to ripen and\r\nsweeten it. But it seems to me impossible that such Muck should be\r\napplied to almost any reasonably dry land, without improving its\r\nconsistency and increasing its fertility. But all Muck is not the\r\nproduct of decayed forest-leaves; and that which was formed of coarse,\r\nrank weeds and brakes, of rotten wood and flags, or skunk cabbage, may\r\nbe of very inferior quality, so as hardly to repay the cost of digging\r\nand applying it. Science will yet enable us to fix, at least\r\napproximately, the value of each deposit of Muck, and so give a\r\npreference to the best.\r\n\r\nThe Analysis of Soils, whereof much was heard and whence much was hoped\r\na few years since, seems to have fallen into utter discredit, so that\r\nevery would-be popular writer gives it a passing fling or kick. That any\r\nanalysis yet made was and is worthless, I can readily concede, without\r\nshaking in the least my conviction that soils will yet be analyzed,\r\nunder the guidance of a truer, profounder Science, to the signal\r\nenlightenment and profit of their cultivators. Here is a retired\r\nmerchant, banker, doctor, or lawyer, who has bought a spacious and\r\nnaturally fertile but worn-out, run-down farm, on which he proposes to\r\nspend the remainder of his days. Of course, he must improve and enrich\r\nit; but with what? and how? All the manure he finds, or, for the\r\npresent, can make on it, will hardly put the first acre in high\r\ncondition, while he grows old and is unwilling to wait forever. He is\r\nable and ready to buy fertilizers, and does buy right and left, without\r\nknowing whether his land needs Lime, or Phosphate, or Potash, or\r\nsomething very different from either. Say he purchases $2,000 worth Of\r\none or more of these fertilizers: it is highly probable that $1,500\r\nmight have served him better if invested in due proportion in just what\r\nhis land most urgently needs; and I unflinchingly believe that we shall\r\nyet have an analysis of soils that will tell him just what fertilizers\r\nhe ought to apply, and what quantity of each of them.\r\n\r\nScience has already taught us that every load of Hay or Grain drawn from\r\na field abstracts therefrom a considerable quantity of certain\r\nminerals--say Potash, Lime, Soda, Magnesia, Chlorine, Silica,\r\nPhosphorus--and that the soil is thereby impoverished until they be\r\nreplaced, in some form or other. As no deposit in a bank was ever so\r\nlarge that continual drafts would not ultimately exhaust it, so no soil\r\nwas ever so rich that taking crop after crop from it annually, yet\r\ngiving nothing back, would not render it sterile or worthless. Sun and\r\nrain and wind will do their part in the work of renovation; but all of\r\nthem together cannot restore to the soil the mineral elements whereof\r\neach crop takes a portion, and which, being once completely exhausted,\r\ncan only be replaced at a heavy cost. Science teaches us to foresee and\r\nprevent such exhaustion--in part, by a rotation of crops, and in part by\r\na constant replacement of the minerals annually borne away: the\r\nsubtraction being greater in proportion as the crop is more exacting and\r\nluxuriant.\r\n\r\nWhat I know of Science applicable to Farming is little indeed; but I\r\nknow that there _is_ such Science, and that each succeeding year\r\nenlarges, improves, and perfects it. I know that I should thus far have\r\nfarmed to far better purpose, if I had been master even of so much\r\nScience as already exists.\r\n\r\nUnderstand that I am not a teacher of this Science--I stand very low in\r\nthe class of learners. I began to learn too late in life, and have been\r\ntoo incessantly harassed by a multiplicity of cares, to make any\r\nsatisfactory progress. Any tolerably educated boy of fifteen may know\r\nfar more of Agricultural Science by the time he has passed his\r\neighteenth birthday than I do. What I know in this respect can help him\r\nvery little; my faith that there is much to be known, and that he may\r\nmaster it if he will, is all that is of much importance. If I can\r\nconvince a considerable number of our youth that they may surely acquire\r\na competence by the time they shall have passed their fortieth year,\r\nwithout excessive labor or penurious frugality, by means of that\r\nknowledge of principles and laws subservient to Agriculture which their\r\nfathers could not, but which they easily may attain, I shall have\r\nrendered a substantial service alike to them and to our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL.\r\n\r\nFARM IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good workman, it is said, does not quarrel with his tools--which, if\r\ntrue, I judge is due to the fact that he generally manages to have good\r\nones. To work hard throughout a long day under a burning sun, is\r\nsufficiently trying, without rendering the labor doubly repugnant by the\r\nuse of ill-contrived, imperfect, inefficient implements.\r\n\r\nThe half-century which nearly bounds my recollection has witnessed great\r\nimprovements in this respect. The Plow, mainly of wood, wherewith my\r\nfather broke up his stony, hide-bound acres of New-Hampshire pebbles and\r\ngravel, in my early boyhood, would now be spurned if offered as a gift\r\nto the poorest and most thriftless farmer among us; and the Hoes which\r\nwere allotted to us boys in those days, after the newer and better had\r\nbeen assigned to the men, would be rejected with disdain by the\r\nstupidest negro in Virginia. Though there is still room for improvement,\r\nwe use far better implements than our grandfathers did, with a\r\ncorresponding increase in the efficiency of our labor; but the\r\ncultivators of Spain, Portugal, and the greater part of Europe, still\r\nlinger in the dark ages in this respect. Their plows are little better\r\nthan the forked sticks which served their barbarian ancestors, and their\r\nimplements generally are beneath contempt. With such implements, deep\r\nand thorough culture is simply impossible, unless by the use of the\r\nspade; and he must be a hard worker who produces a peck of Wheat or half\r\na bushel of Indian Corn per day by the exclusive use of this tool. The\r\nsoil of France is so cut up and subdivided into little strips of two or\r\nthree roods up to as many acres each--each strip forming the entire\r\npatrimony of a family--that agricultural advancement or efficiency is,\r\nwith the great mass of French cultivators, out of the question. Hence, I\r\njudge that, outside of Great Britain and Australia, there is no country\r\nwherein an average year's work produces half so much grain as in our\r\nown, in spite of our slovenly tillage, our neglect and waste of\r\nfertilizers, and the frequent failures of our harvests. Belgium,\r\nHolland, and northern France, can teach us neatness and thoroughness of\r\ncultivation; the British isles may fairly boast of larger and surer\r\ncrops of Wheat, Oats, Potatoes, and Grass, than we are accustomed to\r\nsecure; but, in the selection of implements, and in the average\r\nefficiency of labor, our best farmers are ahead of then all.\r\n\r\nBear with me, then, while I interpose a timid plea for our inventors and\r\npatentees of implements, whose solicitations that a trial, or at least\r\nan inspection, be accorded to their several contrivances, are too often\r\nrepelled with churlish rudeness. I realize that our thriving farmers\r\nare generally absorbed in their own plans and efforts, and that the\r\nagent or salesman who insists on an examination of his new harrow, or\r\npitchfork, or potato-digger, is often extravagant in his assumptions,\r\nand sometimes a bore. Still, when I recollect how tedious and how\r\nback-breaking were the methods of mowing Grass and reaping Grain with\r\nthe Scythe and Sickle, which held unchallenged sway in my early boyhood,\r\nI entreat the farmer who is petitioned to accord ten or fifteen minutes\r\nto the setting forth, by some errant stranger, of the merits of his new\r\nhorse-hoe or tedder, to give the time, if he can; and that without sour\r\nlooks or a mien of stolid incredulity. The Biblical monition that, in\r\nevincing a generous hospitality, we may sometimes entertain angels\r\nunawares, seems to me in point. A new implement may be defective and\r\nworthless, and yet contain the germ or suggest the form of a thoroughly\r\ngood one. Give the inventor or his representative a courteous hearing if\r\nyou can, even though this should constrain you to make up the time so\r\nlost after the day's work would otherwise have ended.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the average farmer of our completely rural districts\r\nwould be surprised, if not instructed, by a day's careful scrutiny of\r\nthe contents of one of our great implement warehouses. So many and such\r\nvarious and ingenious devices for pulverizing the earth applying\r\nfertilizers to the soil, planting or sowing rapidly, eradicating weeds,\r\neconomizing labor in harvesting, etc., will probably transcend not\r\nmerely his experience, but his imagination; and every one of these\r\nmyriad implements is useful in its place, though no single farmer can\r\nafford to buy all or half of them. It will yet, I think, be found\r\nnecessary by the farmers of a school-district, if not of a township, to\r\nmeet and agree among themselves that one will buy this implement,\r\nanother that, and so on, until twenty or thirty such devices as a Stump\r\nor Rock-Puller, a Clod-Crusher, Thrashing-Machine, Fanning-Mill, etc.,\r\nshall be owned in the neighborhood--each by a separate farmer, willing\r\nto live and let live--with an understanding that each shall be used in\r\nturn by him who needs it; and so every one shall be nearly as well\r\naccommodated as though he owned them all.\r\n\r\nFor the number and variety of useful implements increase so rapidly,\r\nwhile their usefulness is so palpable, that, though it is difficult to\r\nfarm efficiently without many if not most of them, it is impossible that\r\nthe young farmer of moderate means should buy and keep them all. True,\r\nhe might hire when he needed, if what he wanted were always at hand; but\r\nthis can only be assured by some such arrangement as I have suggested,\r\nwherein each undertakes to provide and keep that which he will most\r\nneed; agreeing to lend it whenever it can be spared to any other member\r\nof the combination, who undertakes to minister in like manner to _his_\r\nneed in return.\r\n\r\nI think few will doubt that the inventions in aid of Agriculture during\r\nthe last forty years will be far surpassed by those of the forty years\r\njust before us. The magnificent fortunes which, it is currently\r\nunderstood, have rewarded the inventors of the more popular Mowers,\r\nReapers, etc., of our day, are sure to stimulate alike the ingenuity and\r\nthe avarice of clever men throughout the coming years, and to call into\r\nexistence ten thousand patents, whereof a hundred will be valuable, and\r\nten or twelve eminently useful. Plowing land free from stumps and stones\r\ncannot long be the tedious, patience-trying process we have known it.\r\nThe machinery which will at once pulverize the soil to a depth of two\r\nfeet, fertilize and seed it, not requiring it to be trampled by the\r\nhoofs of animals employed in subsoiling and harrowing, will soon be in\r\ngeneral use, especially on the spacious, deep, inviting prairies of the\r\nGreat West.--But I must defer what I have to say of Steam and its uses\r\nin Agriculture to another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI.\r\n\r\nSTEAM IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs yet, the great body of our farmers have been slow in availing\r\nthemselves of the natural forces in operation around them. Vainly for\r\nthem does the wind blow across their fields and over their hill-tops.\r\nIt neither thrashes nor grinds their grain; it has ceased even to\r\nseparate it from the chaff. The brook brawls and foams idly adown the\r\nprecipice or hillside: the farmer grinds his grain, churns his cream,\r\nand turns his grindstone, just as though falling water did not embody\r\npower. He draws his Logs to one mill, and his Wheat, Corn, or Rye to\r\nanother, and returns in due season with his boards or his meal; but the\r\nlesson which the mill so plainly teaches remains, by him unread. Where\r\nrunning or leaping water is not, there brisk breezes and fiercer gales\r\nare apt to be. But the average farmer ignores the mechanical use of\r\nstream and breeze alike, taxing his own muscle to achieve that which the\r\nblind forces of Nature stand ready to do at his command. It may not, and\r\nI think it will not, be always thus.\r\n\r\nSteam, as a cheap source of practically limitless power, is hardly a\r\ncentury old; yet it has already revolutionized the mechanical and\r\nmanufacturing industry of Christendom. It weaves the far greater part of\r\nall the Textile Fabrics that clothe and shelter and beautify the human\r\nfamily. It fashions every bar and every rail of Iron or of Steel; it\r\nimpels the machinery of nearly every manufactory of wares or of\r\nimplements; and it is very rapidly supplanting wind in the propulsion of\r\nvessels on the high seas, as it has already done on rivers and on most\r\ninland waters.\r\n\r\nWater is, however, still employed as a power in certain cases, but\r\nmainly because its adaptation to this end has cost many thousands of\r\ndollars which its disuse would render worthless.\r\n\r\nI am quite within bounds in estimating that nine-tenths of all the\r\nmaterial force employed by man in Manufactures, Mechanics, and\r\nNavigation, is supplied by Steam, and that this disproportion will be\r\nincreased to ninety-nine hundredths before the close of this century.\r\n\r\nFor Agriculture, Steam has done very much, in the transportation of\r\ncrops and of fertilizers, but very little in the preparation or\r\ncultivation of the soil. Of steam-wagons for roads or fields,\r\nsteam-plows for pulverizing and deepening the soil, and\r\nsteam-cultivators for keeping weeds down and rendering tillage more\r\nefficient, we have had many heralded in sanguine bulletins throughout\r\nthe last forty years, but I am not aware that one of them has fulfilled\r\nthe sanguine hopes of its author. Though a dozen Steam-Plows have been\r\ninvented in this country, and several imported from Europe, I doubt that\r\na single square mile of our country's surface has been plowed wholly by\r\nsteam down to this hour. If it has, Louisiana--a State which one would\r\nnot naturally expect to find in the van of industrial progress--has\r\nenjoyed the benefit and earned the credit of the achievement.\r\n\r\nOf what Steam has yet accomplished in direct aid of Agriculture, I have\r\nlittle to say, though in Great Britain quite a number of steam-plows are\r\nactually at work in the fields, and (I am assured), with fair success.\r\nUntil something breaks or gives out, one of these plows does its\r\nappointed work better and cheaper than such work is or can be done by\r\nanimal power; but all the steam-plows whereof I have any knowledge seem\r\ntoo bulky, too complicated, too costly, ever to win their way into\r\ngeneral use. I value them only as hints and incitements toward something\r\nbetter suited to the purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat our farmers need is not a steam-plow as a specialty, but a\r\nlocomotive that can travel with facility, not only on common\r\nwagon-roads, but across even freshly-plowed fields, without\r\nembarrassment, and prove as docile to its manager's touch as an average\r\nspan of horses. Such a locomotive should not cost more then $500, nor\r\nweigh more than a tun when laden with fuel and water for a half-hour's\r\nsteady work. It should be so contrived that it may be hitched in a\r\nminute to a plow, a harrow, a wagon, or cart, a saw or grist-mill, a\r\nmower or reaper, a thresher or stalk-cutter, a stump or rock-puller, and\r\nmade useful in pumping and draining operations, digging a cellar or\r\nlaying up a wall, as also in ditching or trenching. We may have to wait\r\nsome years yet for a servant so dexterous and docile, yet I feel\r\nconfident that our children will enjoy and appreciate his handiwork.\r\n\r\nThe farmer often needs far more power at one season than at another, and\r\nis compelled to retain and subsist working animals at high cost through\r\nmonths in which he has no use for them, because he must have them when\r\nthose months have transpired. If he could replace those animals by a\r\nmachine which, when its season of usefulness was over, could be cleaned,\r\noiled, and put away under a tight roof until next seeding-time, the\r\nsaving alike of cost and trouble would be very considerable.\r\n\r\nWhen our American reapers first challenged attention in Great Britain,\r\nthe general skepticism as to their efficiency was counteracted by the\r\nsuggestion that, even though reaping by machinery should prove more\r\nexpensive than reaping by hand, the ability to cut and save the\r\ngrain-crop more rapidly than hitherto would over-balance that\r\nenhancement of cost. In the British Isles, day after day of chilling\r\nwind and rain is often encountered in harvest-time: the standing Wheat\r\nor Oats or Barley becoming draggled, or lodged, or beaten out, while the\r\nowner impatiently awaits the recurrence of sunny days. When these at\r\nlength arrive, he is anxious to harvest many acres at once, since his\r\nGrain is wasting and he knows not how soon cloud and tempest may again\r\nbe his portion. But all his neighbors are in like predicament with\r\nhimself, and all equally intent on hurrying the harvest; so that little\r\nextra help is attainable. If now the aid of a machine may be commanded,\r\nwhich will cut 15 or 20 acres per day, he cares less how much that work\r\nwill cost than how soon it can be effected. Hence, even though cutting\r\nby horse-power had proved more costly than cutting by hand, it would\r\nstill have been welcome.\r\n\r\nSo it is with Plowing, here and almost everywhere. Our farmers have this\r\nyear been unable to begin Plowing for Winter Grain so early as they\r\ndesired, by reason of the intense heat and drouth, whereby their fields\r\nwere baked to the consistency of half-burned brick. Much seed will in\r\nconsequence have been sown too late, while much seeding will have been\r\nprecluded altogether, by inability to prepare the ground in due season.\r\nIf a machine had been at hand whereby 15 or 20 acres per day could have\r\nbeen plowed and harrowed, thousands would have invoked its aid to enable\r\nthem to sow their Grain in tolerable season, even though the cost had\r\nbeen essentially heavier than that of old-fashioned plowing. I traversed\r\nIllinois on the 13th and 14th of May, 1859, when its entire soil seemed\r\nsoaked and sodden with incessant rains, which had not yet ceased\r\npouring. Inevitably, there had been little or no plowing yet for the\r\nvast Corn-crop of that State; yet barely two weeks would intervene\r\nbefore the close of the proper season for Corn-planting. Even if these\r\nshould be wholly favorable, the plowing could not be effected in season,\r\nand much ground must be planted too late or not planted at all. In every\r\nsuch case, a machine that would plow six or eight furrows as fast as a\r\nman ought to walk, would add immensely to the year's harvest, and be\r\nhailed as a general blessing.\r\n\r\nI recollect that a German observer of Western cultivation--a man of\r\ndecided perspicacity and wide observation--recommended that each farmer\r\nwho had not the requisite time or team for getting in his Corn-crop in\r\ndue season should plow single furrows through his field at intervals of\r\n3 to 3-1/2 feet, plant his Corn on the earth thus turned, and proceed,\r\nso soon as his planting was finished, to plow out the spaces as yet\r\nundisturbed between the springing rows of Corn. I do not know that this\r\nrecommendation was ever widely followed; but I judge that, under certain\r\ncircumstances, it might be, to decided advantage and profit.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to indicate all the benefits which Steam is to\r\nconfer directly on Agriculture, within the next half-century. That\r\nIrrigation must become general, I confidently believe; and I anticipate\r\na very extensive sinking of wells, at favorable points, in order that\r\nwater shall be drawn therefrom by wind or steam to moisten and enrich\r\nthe slopes and plains around them. Such a locomotive as I have\r\nforeshadowed might be taken from well to well, pumping from each in an\r\nhour or two sufficient water to irrigate several of the adjacent acres;\r\nthus starting a second crop of Hay on fields whence the first had been\r\ntaken, and renewing verdure and growth where we now see vegetation\r\nsuspended for weeks, if not months. I feel sure that the mass of our\r\nfarmers have not yet realized the importance and beneficence of\r\nIrrigation, nor the facility wherewith its advantages may be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII.\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION IN FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word of hope and cheer for Labor in our days is COOPERATION--that\r\nis, the combination by many of their means and efforts to achieve\r\nresults beneficial to them all. It differs radically from Communism,\r\nwhich proposes that each should receive from the aggregate product of\r\nhuman labor enough to satisfy his wants, or at least his needs, whether\r\nhe shall have contributed to that aggregate much, or little, or nothing\r\nat all. Cooperation insists that each shall receive from the joint\r\nproduct in proportion to his contributions thereto, whether in capital,\r\nskill, or labor. If one associate has ten children and another none,\r\nCommunism would apportion to each according to the size of his family\r\nalone; while Cooperation would give to each what he had earned,\r\nregardless of the number dependent upon him. Thus the two systems are\r\nradical antagonists, and only the grossly ignorant or willfully blind\r\nwill confound them.\r\n\r\nA young farmer, whose total estate is less than $500, not counting a\r\npriceless wife and child, resolves to migrate from one of the old\r\nStates to Kansas, Minnesota, or one of the Territories: he has heard\r\nthat he will there find public land whereon he may make a home of a\r\nquarter-section, paying therefor $20 or less for the cost of survey and\r\nof the necessary papers. So he may: but, on reaching the Land of\r\nPromise, whether with or without his family, he finds a very large belt\r\nof still vacant land beyond the settlements already transformed into\r\nprivate property, and either not for sale at all or held on speculation,\r\nquite out of his reach. The public land which he may take under the\r\nHomestead law lies a full day's journey beyond the border settlements,\r\nto which he must look for Mills, Stores, Schools, and even Highways. If\r\nhe persists in squatting, with intent to earn his quarter-section by\r\nsettlement and cultivation, he must take a long day's journey across\r\nunbridged streams and sloughs, over unmade roads, to find boards, or\r\nbrick, or meal, or glass, or groceries; while he must postpone the\r\neducation of his children to an indefinite future day. Gradually, the\r\nregion will be settled, and the conveniences of civilization will find\r\ntheir way to his door, but not till after he will have suffered through\r\nseveral years for want of them; often compelled to make a journey to get\r\na plow or yoke mended, a grist of grain ground, or to minister to some\r\nother trivial but inexorable want. He who thus acquires his\r\nquarter-section must fairly earn it, and may be thankful if his children\r\ndo not grow up rude, coarse, and illiterate.\r\n\r\nBut suppose one thousand just such young farmers as he is, with no more\r\nmeans and no greater efficiency than his, were to set forth together,\r\nresolved to find a suitable location whereon they might all settle on\r\nadjoining quarter-sections, thus appropriating the soil of five or six\r\nembryo townships: who can fail to see that three-fourths of the\r\nobstacles and discouragements which confront the solitary pioneer would\r\nvanish at the outset? Roads, Bridges, Mills,--nay, even Schools and\r\nChurches--would be theirs almost immediately; while mechanics,\r\nmerchants, doctors, etc., would fairly overrun their settlement and\r\nsolicit their patronage at every road-crossing. Within a year after the\r\nlocation of their several claims, they would have achieved more progress\r\nand more comfort than in five years under the system of straggling and\r\nisolated settlement which has hitherto prevailed. The change I here\r\nindicate appeals to the common sense and daily experience of our whole\r\npeople. It is not necessary, however desirable, that the pioneers should\r\nbe giants in wisdom, in integrity, or in piety, to secure its benefits.\r\nA knave or a fool may be deemed an undesirable neighbor; but a dozen\r\nsuch in the township would not preclude, and could hardly diminish, the\r\nadvantages naturally resulting from settlement by Cooperation.\r\n\r\nNor are these confined to pioneers transcending the boundaries of\r\ncivilization. I wish I could induce a thousand of our colored men now\r\nprecariously subsisting by servile labor in the cities, to strike out\r\nboldly for homes of their own, and for liberty to direct their own\r\nlabor, whether they should settle on the frontier in the manner just\r\noutlined, or should buy a tract of cheap land on Long Island, in\r\nNew-Jersey, Maryland, or some State further South. I cannot doubt that\r\nthe majority of them would work their way up to independence; and this\r\nvery much sooner, and after undergoing far less privation, than almost\r\nevery pioneer who has plunged alone into the primitive forest or struck\r\nout upon the broad prairie and there made himself a farm.\r\n\r\nThe insatiable demand for fencing is one of the pioneer's many trials.\r\nThough he has cleared off but three acres of forest during his first\r\nFall and Winter, he must surround those acres with a stout fence, or all\r\nhe grows will be devoured by hungry cattle--his own, if no others.\r\nWhether he adds two or ten acres to his clearing during the next year,\r\nthey must in turn be surrounded by a fence; and nothing short of a very\r\nstout one will answer: so he goes on clearing and fencing, usually\r\nburning up a part of his fence whenever he burns over his new clearing;\r\nthen building a new one around this, which will have to be sacrificed in\r\nits turn. I believe that many pioneers have devoted as much time to\r\nfencing their fields as to tilling them throughout their first six or\r\neight years.\r\n\r\nIt is different with those who settle on broad prairies, but not\r\nessentially better. Each pioneer must fence his patch of tillage with\r\nmaterial which costs him more, and is procured with greater difficulty,\r\nthan though he were cutting a hole in the forest. Often, when he thinks\r\nhe has fenced sufficiently, the hungry, breachy cattle, who roam the\r\nopen prairies around him, judge his handiwork less favorably; and he\r\nwakes some August morning, when feed is poorest outside and most\r\nluxuriant within his inclosure, to find that twenty or thirty cattle\r\nhave broken through his defenses and half destroyed his growing crop.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of this wasteful lack of system, a thousand or even a\r\nhundred farmers would combine to fence several square miles into one\r\ngrand inclosure for cultivation, erecting their several habitations\r\nwithin or without its limits, as to each should be convenient--\r\napportioning it for cultivation, or owning it in severalty, as they\r\nshould see fit--an immense economy would be secured, just when, because\r\nof their poverty, saving is most important. Their stock might range the\r\nopen prairie unwatched; and they might all sleep at night in serene\r\nconfidence that their corn and cabbages were not in danger of ruthless\r\ndestruction. Among the settlers in our great primitive forests, the\r\nsystem of Cooperative Farming would have to be modified in details,\r\nwhile it would be in essence the same.\r\n\r\nAnd, once adopted with regard to fencing, other adaptations as obvious\r\nand beneficent would from day to day suggest themselves. Each pioneer\r\nwould learn how to advance his own prosperity by combining his efforts\r\nwith those of his neighbors. He would perceive that the common wants of\r\na hundred may be supplied by a combined effort at less than half the\r\ncost of satisfying them when each is provided for alone. He would grow\r\nyear by year into a clearer and firmer conviction that short-sighted\r\nselfishness is the germ of half the evils that afflict the human race,\r\nand that the true and sure way to a bounteous satisfaction of the wants\r\nof each is a generous and thoughtful consideration for the needs of all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd here let me pay my earnest and thankful tribute to Mr. E. V. de\r\nBoissiere, a philanthropic Frenchman, who has purchased 3,300 acres of\r\nmainly rolling prairie-land in Kansas, near Princeton, Franklin County,\r\nand is carefully, cautiously, laying thereon the foundations of a great\r\ncooperative farm, where, in addition to the usual crops, it is expected\r\nthat Silk and other exotics will in due time be extensively grown and\r\ntransformed into fabrics, and that various manufactures will vie with\r\nAgriculture in affording attractive and profitable employment to a\r\nconsiderable population. I have not been accustomed to look with favor\r\non our new States and unpeopled Territories as an arena for such\r\nexperiments, since so many of their early settlers are intent on getting\r\nrich by land-speculation--at all events, through the exercise of some\r\nothers' muscles than their own--while the opportunities for and\r\nincitements to migration and relocation are so multiform and powerful.\r\nDoubtless, M. de Boissiere will be often tried by stampedes of his\r\nvolunteer associates, who, after the novelty of cooperative effort has\r\nworn off, will find life on his domain too tame and humdrum for their\r\nexcitable and high-strung natures. I trust, however, that he will\r\npersevere through every discouragement, and triumph over every obstacle;\r\nthat the right men for associates will gradually gather about him; that\r\nhis enterprise and devotion will at length be crowned by a signal and\r\ninspiring success; and that thousands will be awakened by it to a larger\r\nand nobler conception of the mission of Industry, and the possibilities\r\nof achievement which stud the path of simple, honest, faithful,\r\npersistent Work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII.\r\n\r\nFARMERS' CLUBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers, like other men, divide naturally into two classes--those who do\r\ntoo much work, and those who do too little. I know men who are no\r\nfarmers at all, only by virtue of the fact that each of them inherited,\r\nor somehow acquired, a farm, and have since lived upon and out of it, in\r\ngood part upon that which it could not help producing--they not doing so\r\nmuch as one hundred fair days' work each per annum. One of this class\r\nnever takes a periodical devoted to farming; evinces no interest in\r\ncounty fairs or township clubs, save as they may afford him an excuse\r\nfor greater idleness; and insists that there is no profit in farming. As\r\nland steadily depreciates in quality under his management, he is apt to\r\nsell out whenever the increase of population or progress of improvement\r\nhas given additional value to his farm, and move off in quest of that\r\nundiscovered country where idleness is compatible with thrift, profits\r\nare realized from light crops, and men grow rich by doing nothing.\r\n\r\nThe opposite class of wanderers from the golden mean is hardly so\r\nnumerous as the idlers, yet it is quite a large one. Its leading\r\nembodiment, to my mind, is one whom I knew from childhood, who, born\r\npoor and nowise favored by fortune, was rated as a tireless worker from\r\nearly boyhood, and who achieved an independence before he was forty\r\nyears old in a rural New-England township, simply by rugged, persistent\r\nlabor--in youth on the farms of other men; in manhood, on one of his\r\nown. This man was older at forty than his father, then seventy, and died\r\nat fifty, worn out with excessive and unintermitted labor, leaving a\r\nwidow who greatly preferred him to all his ample wealth, and an only son\r\nwho, so soon as he can get hold of it, will squander the property much\r\nfaster, and even more unwisely, than his father acquired it.\r\n\r\nTo the class of which this man was a fair representative, Farmers' Clubs\r\nmust prove of signal value. Though there should be nothing else than a\r\nFarmers' Club in his neighborhood, it can hardly fail in time to make\r\nsuch a one realize that life need not and should not be all drudgery;\r\nthat there are other things worth living for beside accumulating wealth.\r\nLet his wife and his neighbor succeed in drawing such a one into two or\r\nthree successive meetings, and he can hardly fail to perceive that\r\nthrift is a product of brain as well as of muscle; that he may grow rich\r\nby learning and knowing as well as by delving, and that, even though he\r\nshould not, there are many things desirable and laudable beside the\r\naccumulation of wealth.\r\n\r\nA true Farmers' Club should consist of all the families residing in a\r\nsmall township, so far as they can be induced to attend it, even though\r\nonly half their members should be present at any one meeting. It should\r\nlimit speeches to ten minutes, excepting only those addresses or essays\r\nwhich eminently qualified persons are requested to specially prepare and\r\nread. It should have a president, ready and able to repress all\r\nill-natured personalities, all irrelevant talk, and especially all\r\nstraying into the forbidden regions of political or theological\r\ndisputation. At each meeting, the subject should be chosen for the next,\r\nand not less than four members pledged to make some observations\r\nthereon, with liberty to read them if unused to speaking in public.\r\nThose having been heard, the topic should be open to discussion by all\r\npresent: the humblest and youngest being specially encouraged to state\r\nany facts within their knowledge which they deem pertinent and cogent.\r\nLet every person attending be thus incited to say something calculated\r\nto shed light on the subject, to say this in the fewest words possible,\r\nand with the utmost care not to annoy or offend others, and it is hardly\r\npossible that one evening per week devoted to these meetings should not\r\nbe spent with equal pleasure and profit.\r\n\r\nThe chief end to be achieved through such meetings is a development of\r\nthe faculty of observation and the habit of reflection. Too many of us\r\npass through life essentially blind and deaf to the wonders and glories\r\nmanifest to clearer eyes all around us. The magnificent phenomena of the\r\nSeasons, even the awakening of Nature from death to life in Spring-time,\r\nmake little impression on their senses, still less on their\r\nunderstandings. There are men who have passed forty times through a\r\nforest, and yet could not name, within half a dozen, the various species\r\nof trees which compose it; and so with everything else to which they are\r\naccustomed. They need even more than knowledge an intellectual\r\nawakening; and this they could hardly fail to receive from the\r\ndiscussions of an intelligent and earnest Farmers' Club.\r\n\r\nA genuine and lively interest in their vocation is needed by many\r\nfarmers, and by most farmers' sons. Too many of these regard their\r\nhomesteads as a prison, in which they must remain until some avenue of\r\nescape into the great world shall open before them. The farm to such is\r\nbut the hollow log into which a bear crawls to wear out the rigors of\r\nWinter and await the advent of Spring. Too many of our boys fancy that\r\nthey know too much for farmers, when in fact they know far too little. A\r\ngood Farmers' Club, faithfully attended, would take this conceit out of\r\nthem, imbuing them instead with a realizing sense of their ignorance and\r\nincompetency, and a hearty desire for practical wisdom.\r\n\r\nA recording secretary, able to state in the fewest words each important\r\nsuggestion or fact elicited in the course of an evening's discussion,\r\nwould be hardly less valuable or less honored than a capable president.\r\nA single page would often suffice for all that deserves such record out\r\nof an evening's discussion; and this, being transferred to a book and\r\npreserved, might be consulted with interest and profit throughout many\r\nsucceeding years. No other duty should be required of the member who\r\nrendered this service, the correspondence of the Club being devolved\r\nupon another secretary. The habit of bringing grafts, or plants, or\r\nseeds, to Club meetings, for gratuitous distribution, has been found to\r\nincrease the interest, and enlarge the attendance of those formerly\r\nindifferent. Almost every good farmer or gardener will sometimes have\r\nchoice seeds or grafts to spare, which he does not care or cannot expect\r\nto sell, and these being distributed to the Club will not only increase\r\nits popularity, but give him a right to share when another's surplus is\r\nin like manner distributed. If one has choice fruits to give away, the\r\nClub will afford him an excellent opportunity; but I would rather not\r\nattract persons to its meetings by a prospect of having their appetites\r\nthus gratified at others' expense. A Flower-Show once in each year, and\r\nan Exhibition of Fruits and other choice products at an evening meeting\r\nin September or October, should suffice for festivals. Let each member\r\nconsider himself pledged to bring to the Exhibition the best material\r\nresult of his year's efforts, and the aggregate will be satisfactory and\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nThe organization of a Farmers' Club is its chief difficulty. The larger\r\nnumber of those who ought to participate usually prefer to stand back,\r\nnot committing themselves to the effort until after its success has been\r\nassured. To obviate this embarrassment, let a paper be circulated for\r\nsignatures, pledging each signer to attend the introductory meeting and\r\nbring at least a part of his family. When forty have signed such a call,\r\nsuccess will be well-nigh assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV.\r\n\r\nWESTERN IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already set forth my belief that Irrigation is everywhere\r\npracticable, is destined to be generally adopted, and to prove signally\r\nbeneficent. I do not mean that every acre of the States this side of the\r\nMissouri will ever be thus supplied with water, but that _some_ acres of\r\nevery township, and of nearly every farm, should and will be. I propose\r\nherein to speak with direct reference to that large portion of our\r\ncountry which cannot be cultivated to any purpose without Irrigation.\r\nThis region, which is practically rainless in Summer, may be roughly\r\nindicated as extending from the forks of the Platte westward, and as\r\nincluding all our present Territories, a portion of Western Texas, the\r\nentire State of Nevada, and at least nine-tenths of California. On this\r\nvast area, no rain of consequence falls between April and November,\r\nwhile its soil, parched by fervid, cloudless suns, and swept by\r\nintensely dry winds, is utterly divested of moisture to a depth of three\r\nor four feet; and I have seen the tree known as Buckeye growing in it,\r\nat least six inches in diameter, whereon every leaf was withered and\r\nutterly dead before the end of August, though the tree still lived, and\r\nwould renew its foliage next Spring.\r\n\r\nMost of this broad area is usually spoken of as desert, because\r\ntreeless, except on the slopes of its mountains, where certain\r\nevergreens would seem to dispense with moisture, and on the brink of\r\ninfrequent and scanty streams, where the all but worthless Cotton-wood\r\nis often found growing luxuriantly. A very little low Gamma Grass on the\r\nPlains, some straggling Bunch-grass on the mountains, with an endless\r\nprofusion of two poor shrubs, popularly known as Sage-brush and\r\nGrease-wood, compose the vegetation of nearly or quite a million square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nI will confine myself in this essay to the readiest means of irrigating\r\nthe Plains, by which I mean the all but treeless plateau that stretches\r\nfrom the base of the Rocky Mountains, 300 to 400 miles eastward, sloping\r\nimperceptibly toward the Missouri, and drained by the affluents of the\r\nPlatte, the Kansas, and the Arkansas rivers.\r\n\r\nThe North Platte has its sources in the western, as the South Platte has\r\nin the eastern, slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Each of them pursues a\r\ngenerally north-east course for some 300 miles, and then turns sharply\r\nto the eastward, uniting some 300 miles eastward of the mountains, where\r\nthe Plains melt into the Prairies. Between these two rivers and the\r\neastern base of the mountains lies an irregular delta or triangle, which\r\nseems susceptible of irrigation at a smaller cost than the residue. The\r\nlocation of Union Colony may be taken as a fair illustration of the\r\nprocess, and the facilities therefor afforded by nature.\r\n\r\nAmong the streams which, taking rise in the eastern gorges of the Rocky\r\nMountains, run into the South Platte, the most considerable has somehow\r\nacquired the French name of Cache la Poudre. It heads in and about\r\nLong's Peak, and, after emerging from the mountains, runs some 20 to 25\r\nmiles nearly due east, with a descent in that distance of about 100\r\nfeet. Its waters are very low in Autumn and Winter, and highest in May,\r\nJune and July, from the melting of snow and ice on the lofty mountains\r\nwhich feed it. Like all the streams of this region, it is broad and\r\nshallow, with its bed but three to four feet below the plains on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nGreeley, the nucleus of Union Colony, is located at the crossing of the\r\nCache la Poudre by the Denver-Pacific Railroad, about midway of its\r\ncourse from the Kansas Pacific at Denver northward to the Union Pacific\r\nat Cheyenne. Here a village of some 400 to 500 houses has suddenly grown\r\nup during the past Summer.\r\n\r\nThe first irrigating canal of Union Colony leaves the Cache la Poudre\r\nsix or eight miles above Greeley, on the south side, and is carried\r\ngradually further and further from the stream until it is fully a mile\r\ndistant at the village, whence it is continued to the Platte. Branches\r\nor ditches lead thence northward, conveying rills through the streets\r\nof the village, the gardens or plats of its inhabitants, and the public\r\nsquare, or plaza, which is designed to be its chief ornament. Other\r\nbranches lead to the farms and five-acre allotments whereby the village\r\nis surrounded; as still others will do in time to all the land between\r\nthe canal and the river. In due time, another canal will be taken out\r\nfrom a point further up the stream, and will irrigate the lands of the\r\ncolony lying south of the present canal, and which are meantime devoted\r\nto pasturage in common.\r\n\r\nTaking the water out of the river is here a very simple matter. At the\r\nhead of an island, a rude dam of brush and stones and earth is thrown\r\nacross the bed of the stream, so as to raise the surface two or three\r\nfeet when the water is lowest, and very much less when it is highest.\r\nThus deflected, a portion of the water flows easily into the canal.\r\n\r\nA very much larger and longer canal, leaving the Cache la Poudre close\r\nto the mountains, and gradually increasing its distance from that stream\r\nto four or five miles, is now in progress by sections, and is to be\r\ncompleted this Winter. Its length will be thirty miles, and it will\r\nirrigate, when the necessary sub-canals shall have been constructed, not\r\nless than 40,000 acres. But it may be ten years before all this work is\r\ncompleted or even required. The lands most easily watered from the main\r\ncanal will be first brought into cultivation; the sub-canals will be dug\r\nas they shall be wanted.\r\n\r\nAt first, members of the Colony arriving at its location, hesitated to\r\ntake farm allotments and build upon them, from distrust of the\r\ncapacities of the soil. They saw nothing of value growing upon it; the\r\nlittle grass found upon it was short, thin, and brown. It was not black,\r\nlike the prairies and bottoms of Illinois and Kansas, but of a light\r\nyellow snuff-color, and deemed sterile by many. But a few took hold, and\r\nplanted and sowed resolutely; and, though it was too late in the season\r\nfor most grains, the results were most satisfactory. Wheat sown in June\r\nproduced 30 bushels to the acre; Oats did as well; while Potatoes,\r\nBeets, Turnips, Squashes, Cabbages, etc., yielded bounteously; Tomatoes\r\ndid likewise, but the plants were obtained from Denver. Little was done\r\nwith Indian Corn, but that little turned out well, though I judge that\r\nthe Summer nights are too cold here to justify sanguine expectations of\r\na Corn-crop--the altitude being 5,000 feet above the sea, with\r\nsnow-covered mountains always visible in the west. For other Grains, and\r\nfor all Vegetables and Grasses, I believe there is no better soil in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTo many, the cost of Irrigation would seem so much added to the expense\r\nof cultivating without irrigation; but this is a mistake. Here is land\r\nentirely free from stump, or stick, or stone, which may easily and\r\nsurely be plowed or seeded in March or April, and which will produce\r\ngreat crops of nearly every grain, grass or vegetable, with a very\r\nmoderate outlay of labor to subdue and till it. The farmer need not\r\nlose three days per annum by rains in the growing season, and need not\r\nfear storm or shower when he seeks to harvest his grass or grain.\r\nNothing like ague or any malarious disease exhausts his vitality or\r\nparalyzes his strength. I saw men breaking up for the first time tracts\r\nwhich had received no water, using but a single span of horses as team;\r\nwhereas, breaking up in the Prairie States involves a much larger outlay\r\nof power. The advantage of early sowing is very great; that of a long\r\nplanting season hardly less so. I believe a farmer in this colony may\r\nkeep his plow running through October, November, and a good portion of\r\nDecember; start it again by the 1st of March, and commence seeding with\r\nWheat, Oats, and Barley, and keep seeding, including planting and\r\ngardening, until the first of June, which is soon enough to plant\r\npotatoes for Winter use. Thenceforth, he may keep the weeds out of his\r\nCorn, Roots, and Vegetables, for six Weeks or two months; and, as every\r\nday is a bright working-day, he can get on much faster than he could if\r\nliable to frequent interruptions by rains. I estimate the cost of\r\nbringing water to each farm at $5 per acre, and that of leading it about\r\nin sub-ditches, so that it shall be available and applicable on every\r\nacre of that farm, at somewhat less; but let us suppose that the first\r\ncost of having water everywhere and always at command is $10 per acre,\r\nand that it will cost thereafter $1 per acre to apply it, I maintain\r\nthat it is richly worth having, and that nearly every farm product can\r\nbe grown cheaper by its help than on lands where irrigation is presumed\r\nunnecessary. There are not many acres laid down to grass in New-England,\r\nwhether for hay or pasture, that would not have justified an outlay of\r\n$10 per acre to secure their thorough irrigation simply for this year\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV.\r\n\r\nSEWAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great empires of antiquity were doomed to certain decay and\r\ndissolution by a radical vice inherent in their political and social\r\nconstitution. Power rapidly built up a great capital, whereto population\r\nwas attracted from every quarter; and that capital became a focus of\r\nluxury and consumption. Grain, Meat, and Vegetables--the fat of the land\r\nand the spoils of the sea--were constantly absorbed by it in enormous\r\nquantities; while nothing, or, at best, very little, was returned\r\ntherefrom to the continually exhausted and impoverished soil. Thus, a\r\nfew ages, or at most a few centuries, sufficed to divest a vast\r\nsurrounding district, first, of its fertility, ultimately of its\r\ncapacity for production. And so Nineveh, Thebes, Babylon, successively\r\nceased to be capitals, and became ruins amid deserts. Rome impoverished\r\nItaly south of the Apennines; then Sicily; and, at last, Egypt: her\r\nsceptre finally departing, because her millions could no longer be fed\r\nwithout dispersion.\r\n\r\nThat some means must be devised whereby to return to the soil those\r\nelements which the removal of crop after crop inevitably exhausts, is a\r\ntruth which has but recently begun to be clearly understood. Unluckily,\r\nthe difficulty of such restoration is seriously augmented by the fact\r\nthat cities, and all considerable aggregations of human beings, tend\r\nstrongly in our day to locations by the sea-side, in valleys, and by the\r\nmargins of rivers. Anciently, cities and villages were often built on\r\nhill-tops, or at considerable elevations, because foes could be excluded\r\nor repelled from such locations more surely, and with smaller force,\r\nthan elsewhere. From such elevations, it need not have been difficult to\r\ndiffuse, by means of water, all that could be gladly spared which would\r\naid to fertilize the adjacent farms and gardens. A kindred distribution\r\nof the exuviae of our modern cities is a far more difficult and costly\r\nundertaking, and involves bold and skillful engineering.\r\n\r\nYet the problem, though difficult, must be solved, or our great cities\r\nwill be destroyed by their own physical impurities. The growth and\r\nexpansion of cities, throughout the present century, have been wholly\r\nbeyond precedent; and thus the difficulty of making a satisfactory\r\ndisposition of their offal has been fearfully augmented. The sewerage of\r\nour streets and houses modifies the problem, but does not solve it.\r\nDesolating epidemics, like the Plague, Yellow Fever, and the Cholera,\r\nwill often visit our great cities, and decimate their people, unless\r\nmeans can be found to cleanse them wholly and incessantly of whatever\r\ntends to pollute and render noisome their atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSEWAGE is the term used in England to designate water which,\r\nhaving been slightly impregnated with the feculence and ordure of a city\r\nor village, is diffused over a farm or farms adjacent, in order to\r\nimpart at once fertility and moisture to its soil. To secure an equable\r\nand thorough dissemination of Sewage, it is essential that the land to\r\nwhich it is applied, if not originally level or nearly so, shall be\r\nbrought into such condition that the impregnated water may be applied to\r\nits entire surface, and shall thence settle into, moisten, and\r\nfertilize, each cubic inch of the soil. This involves a very\r\nconsiderable initial outlay; but the luxuriance of the crops unfailingly\r\nproduced, under the influence of this vivifying irrigation, abundantly\r\njustifies and rewards that outlay.\r\n\r\nAs yet, the application of Sewage is in its infancy; since the perfect\r\nand total conversion of all that a great city excretes into the most\r\navailable food for plants, requires not only immense mains and\r\nreservoirs, with a costly network of distributing dykes or ditches, but\r\nnovel appliances in engineering, and a large investment of time as well\r\nas money. Years must yet elapse before all the excretions of a great\r\ncity like London or New-York can thus be transmuted into the means of\r\nfertilizing whole counties in their vicinity. But the work is already\r\nwell begun, and another generation will see it all but completed.\r\nMeantime, many smaller cities, more eligibly located for the purpose,\r\nare already enriching by their Sewage the rural districts adjacent,\r\nwhich they had previously tended strongly to impoverish. Edinburgh, the\r\ncapital of Scotland, is among them. The little village of Romford,\r\nEngland, is one of those which have recently been made to contribute by\r\nSewage to this beneficent end; and a visit of inspection paid to it, on\r\nthe 15th of October last, by the London Board of Works, elicited\r\naccounts of the process and its results, in the London journals, which\r\nafforded hints for and incitement to similar undertakings in this and\r\nother countries--undertakings which may be postponed, but the only\r\nquestion is one of time. _The Daily News_ of Oct. 17th, says:\r\n\r\n\"Breton's Farm consists of 121 acres of light and poor gravelly soil;\r\nand it now receives the whole available sewage of the town of\r\nRomford--that is, of about 7,000 persons. This is conveyed to the land\r\nby an iron pipe of 18 inches in diameter, which is laid under ground,\r\nand discharges its contents into an open tank. From this tank, the\r\nsewage is pumped to a height of 20 feet, and is then distributed over\r\nthe land by iron or concrete troughs, or 'carriers,' fitted with sluices\r\nand taps, so that the amount of sewage applied to any given portion of\r\nthe field can be regulated with the greatest facility and nicety. To\r\ninsure the regular and even flow of the sewage when discharged from the\r\ncarriers, it was necessary to lay out the land with mathematical\r\naccuracy; and it has been leveled and formed by the theodolite into\r\nrectilinear beds of uniform width of thirty feet, slightly inclining\r\nfrom the centres, along which the sewage is applied. The carriers or\r\nopen troughs, by which the sewage is conveyed, run along the top of each\r\nseries of these beds or strikes; and at the bottom there is in every\r\ncase a good road, by means of which free access is provided for a horse\r\nand cart, or for the steam plow--the use of which is in\r\ncontemplation--to every bed and crop. These arrangements--the carrying\r\nout of which involved the removal of six hundred trees and a great\r\nlength of heavy fences, the filling up of a number of ditches and no\r\nless than nine ponds, as well as the complete underdraining of the whole\r\nfarm--were mainly effected last year; but it was not until the middle of\r\nApril, 1870, that Mr. Hope received any of this sewage from the town of\r\nRomford, and not until the following month that he obtained both the day\r\nand night supply. Satisfactory, therefore, as have been the results of\r\nthe present season's operations, they have been obtained under\r\ndisadvantageous circumstances, and cannot be regarded as affording\r\ncomplete evidence of the benefits which may be derived from the\r\napplication of sewage to even a poor and thin soil, which had already\r\nruined more than one of those who had attempted to cultivate it. To\r\nmention only one drawback which arose from the lateness of the period at\r\nwhich the sewage was first received, Mr. Hope had not the advantage of\r\nbeing able to apply it to his seed-beds: and thus many, if not all his\r\nplants were not ready for setting out so early as they would be in a\r\nfuture year, and some of the crops have suffered in consequence--that is\r\nto say, have suffered in a comparative sense. Speaking positively, they\r\nhave in all instances been much larger, not only than any that could\r\nhave been grown upon the same land without the use of sewage, but than\r\nany which have been raised from much superior land in the immediate\r\nneighborhood. The crops which have been or are being raised on different\r\nparts of the firm, are of diverse character; but, with all, the method\r\nof cultivation adopted has been attended with almost equal success.\r\nItalian rye-grass, beans, peas, mangolds, carrots, broccoli, cabbages,\r\nsavoys, beet-root, Batavia yams, Jersey cabbages, and Indian corn, have\r\nall grown with wonderful rapidity and yielded abundant harvests under\r\nthe stimulating and nourishing influence of the Romford sewage. The\r\nvisitors of Saturday last, as they tramped over the farm under the\r\nguidance of its energetic proprietor, had an opportunity of witnessing\r\nthe abundance and excellence of many of these crops. Even where the\r\nmangolds, from being planted late, had not attained any extraordinary\r\nsize, it was noticeable that the plants were especially vigorous, and\r\nthat there was not a vacant space in any of the rows. All the plants\r\nwhich had been placed in the ground had thriven, and would give a good\r\nreturn. Where this crop had been specially treated with a view to\r\nforthcoming shows, the roots had attained an enormous size, and, like\r\nsome of the cabbages, had assumed almost gigantic proportions. The\r\ncarrots were very fine and well-grown, and the heads of the Walcheren\r\nbroccoli were as white, and firm, and crispy, as the finest\r\ncauliflowers; while the savoys, of unusual size and weight, were as\r\nround and hard as cannon balls; and some of the drumhead cabbages,\r\nalthough equally distinguished for closeness and firmness, were large\r\nenough in the heart to hold a good-sized child, and might, as was\r\nsuggested upon the ground, very well be introduced into some pantomimic\r\nscene representing the kingdom of Brobdingnag. The Indian corn had\r\nreached the respectable height of some eight feet, and, with few\r\nexceptions, each stalk carried a good-sized and well-filled cob or ear.\r\nThese, unless we should have another spell of exceptionally hot weather,\r\nwill not ripen; but in their green state they are readily eaten by\r\nhorses and cattle, and prove excellent fodder.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their peregrinations, Mr. Hope's guests of course paid\r\na visit to the tank in which the sewage is received before it is pumped\r\non the land. We need hardly say that the appearance of this miniature\r\nlake of nastiness was anything but agreeable; but its odor was by no\r\nmeans overpowering, nor, indeed, very offensive. The rill of bright,\r\nclear water which flowed in at one corner, and some of which was handed\r\nabout in tumblers, looking as pure as the limpid stream which flows from\r\nthe most effective filters that are to be seen in the windows of London\r\ndealers, had only a short time before flowed out of this hideous\r\nreservoir in a very different state. We had met it in the \"carriers\"\r\nflowing along in a dark, inky stream, not smelling much, but covered\r\nwith an ugly gray froth which reminded one of some of the most\r\ndisagreeable details in the manufacture of sugar and rum, or suggested\r\nthe idea that it had been used for a very foul wash indeed. With these\r\nreminiscences fresh in one's memory, it required some courage to comply\r\nwith the pressing invitations to taste this 'effluent water.' There\r\nwere, however, many of the party who braved the attempt; and, by all who\r\ntasted it, the water was pronounced to be destitute of any except a\r\nslightly mineral flavor. In dry weather, this effluent water, which has\r\npassed through the land and been collected by the drains, after mixing\r\nwith the sewage, is again pumped over the fields; in wet weather, it can\r\nbe turned into the brook which is dignified with the name of the river\r\nRom. * * * We have omitted to mention that the rent paid by Mr. Hope is\r\nL3 per acre, and the cost of the sewage (at 2s. per head) L6 more.\"\r\n\r\n--I think few thoughtful readers will doubt that here is the germ of a\r\ngreat movement in advance for the Agriculture of all old and densely\r\npeopled communities, and that our youngest cities and manufacturing\r\nvillages may wisely consider it deeply, with a view to its ultimate if\r\nnot early imitation. That we are not prepared to incur the inevitable\r\nexpense of a thorough system of sewerage with reference to the\r\napplication to the soil of all the fertilizing elements that a city\r\nwould gladly spare, by no means proves that we should not consider and\r\nplan with a view to the ultimate creation and utilization of Sewage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI.\r\n\r\nMORE OF IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thus far considered Irrigation with special reference to those\r\nlimited, yet very considerable districts, which are traversed or\r\nbordered by living streams, and, having a level or slightly rolling\r\nsurface, present obvious facilities for and incitements to the\r\noperation. Such are the valleys of the Platte, and of nearly or quite\r\nall its affluents after they leave the Rocky Mountains; such is the\r\nvalley of the upper Arkansas; such the valleys of the Smoky Hill and the\r\nRepublican, so far down as Irrigation may be considered necessary.\r\nIrrigation on all these seems to me inevitable, and certain to be\r\nspeedily, though capriciously, effected.\r\n\r\nI believe a dam across either fork of the Platte, at any favorable\r\npoint above their junction, raising the surface of the stream six feet,\r\nat a cost not exceeding $10,000, would suffice to irrigate completely\r\nnot less than fifty square miles of the valley below it, while serving\r\nat the same time to furnish power for mills and factories to a very\r\nconsiderable extent; for the need of Irrigation is not incessant, but\r\ngenerally confined to two or three months per annum, and all of the\r\nvolume of the stream not needed for Irrigation could be utilized as\r\npower. Thus the valleys of the few constant water-courses of the Plains\r\nmay come at an early day to employ and subsist a dense and energetic\r\npopulation, engaged in the successful prosecution alike of agriculture\r\nand manufactures, while belts, groves, and forests, of choice, luxuriant\r\ntimber, will diversify and embellish regions now bare of trees, and but\r\nthinly covered with dead herbage from June until the following April.\r\n\r\nBut, when we rise above the bluffs, and look off across the blank, bleak\r\nareas where no living water exists, the problem becomes more difficult,\r\nand its solution will doubtless be much longer postponed. To a stranger,\r\nthese bleak uplands seem sterile; and, though such is not generally the\r\nfact, the presumption will repel experiments which involve a large\r\ninitial outlay. The railroad companies, which now own large tracts of\r\nthese lands, will be obliged either to demonstrate their value, or to\r\nincite individuals and colonists to do it by liberal concessions. As the\r\ncase stands to-day, most of these lands, which would have been dear at\r\nfive cents per acre before the roads were built, could not be sold at\r\nany price to actual settlers, even with the railroad in plain sight,\r\nbecause of the dearth of fuel and timber, and because also the means of\r\nrendering them fruitful and their cultivation profitable are out of\r\nreach of the ordinary pioneer. Hence, so long as the valleys of the\r\nliving streams proffer such obvious invitations to settlement and\r\ntillage, by the aid of Irrigation, I judge that the higher and dryer\r\nplains will mainly be left to the half-savage herdsmen who rear cattle\r\nand sheep without feeding and sheltering them, by giving them the range\r\nof a quarter-section to each bullock, and submitting to the loss of a\r\nhundred head or so after each great and cold snow-storm, as an\r\nunavoidable dispensation of Providence.\r\n\r\nBut in process of time even the wild herdsmen will be softened into or\r\nreplaced by regular farmers, plowing and seeding for vegetables and\r\nsmall grains, sheltering their habitations with trees, and sending their\r\nchildren to school. This change involves Irrigation; and the following\r\nare among the ways in which it will be effected:\r\n\r\nThe Plains are nowhere absolutely flat (as I presume the \"desert\" of\r\nSahara is not), but diversified by slopes, and swells, and gentle ridges\r\nor divides, affording abundant facilities for the distribution of water.\r\nA well, sunk on the crest of one of these divides, will be filled with\r\nliving water at a depth ranging from 50 to 100 feet. A windmill of\r\nmodest dimensions placed over this well will be rarely stopped for want\r\nof impelling power: Wind being, next to space, the thing most abundant\r\non the Plains. A reservoir or pond covering three or four acres may be\r\nmade adjacent to the well at a small cost of labor, by excavating\r\nslightly and using the earth to form an embankment on the lower side.\r\nThe windmill, left alone, will fill the reservoir during the windy\r\nWinter and Spring months with water soon warmed in the sun, and ready to\r\nbe drawn off as wanted throughout the thirsty season of vegetable growth\r\nand maturity. Carefully saved, the product of one well will serve to\r\nmoisten and vivify a good many acres of grass or tillage.\r\n\r\nSuch is the retail plan applicable to the wants of solitary farmers; but\r\nI hope to see it supplemented and invigorated by the extensive\r\nintroduction of Artesian wells, whereof two, by way of experiment, are\r\nnow in progress at Denver and Kit Carson respectively.\r\n\r\nI need not here describe the Artesian well, farther than to say that it\r\nis made by boring to a depth ranging from 700 to more than a 1000 feet,\r\ntubing regularly from the top downward until a stream is reached which\r\nwill rise to and above the surface, flowing over the top of the tube in\r\na stream often as large as an average stove-pipe. Such a well, after\r\nsupplying a settlement or modest village with water, may be made to fill\r\na reservoir that will sufficiently irrigate a thousand cultivated acres.\r\nIts water will usually be warmer than though obtained from near the\r\nsurface, and hence better adapted to Irrigation.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Artesian well is costly, and will not soon be constructed\r\nfor uses purely agricultural; but the railroads traversing the Plains\r\nand the Great Basin will sometimes be compelled to resort to one without\r\nhaving use for a twentieth part of the water they thus entice from the\r\nbowels of the earth; and that which they cannot use they will be glad to\r\nsell for a moderate price, thus creating oases of verdure and bounteous\r\nproduction. The palpable interest of railroads in dotting their long\r\nlines of desolation with such cheering contrasts of field and meadow and\r\nwaving trees, render nowise doubtful their hearty cooperation with any\r\nenterprising pioneer who shall bring the requisite capital, energy,\r\nknowledge, and faith, to the prosecution of the work.\r\n\r\nThese are but hasty suggestions of methods which will doubtless be\r\nmultiplied, varied, and improved upon, in the light of future experience\r\nand study. And when the very best and most effective methods of subduing\r\nthe Plains to the uses of civilized man shall have been discovered and\r\nadopted, there will still remain vast areas as free commons for the\r\nherdsmen and sporting-grounds for the hunter of the Elk and the\r\nAntelope, after the Buffalo shall have utterly disappeared.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt the assertion of the plainsmen that rain increases as\r\nsettlements are multiplied. Crossing the Plains in 1859, I noted\r\nindications that timber had formerly abounded where none now grows; and\r\nI presume that, as young trees are multiplied in the wake of\r\ncivilization, finally thickening into clumps of timber and beginning a\r\nforest, more rain will fall, and the extension of woodlands become\r\ncomparatively easy. But, relatively to the country eastward of the\r\nMissouri, the Plains will always be arid and thirsty, with a pure,\r\nbracing atmosphere that will form a chief attraction to thousands\r\nsuffering from or threatened with pulmonary afflictions. A million of\r\nsquare miles, whereon is found no single swamp or bog, and not one lake\r\nthat withstands the drouth of Summer, can never have a moist climate,\r\nand never fail to realize the need of Irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe Plains will in time give lessons, which even the well-watered and\r\nverdurous East may read with profit. Such level and thirsty clays as\r\nlargely border Lake Champlain, for example, traversed by streams from\r\nmountain ranges on either hand, will not always be owned and cultivated\r\nby men insensible to the profit of Irrigation. Nor will such rich\r\nvalleys as those of the Connecticut, the Kennebec, the Susquehanna, be\r\nleft to suffer year after year from drouth, while the water which should\r\nrefresh them runs idly and uselessly by. Agriculture repels innovation,\r\nand loves the beaten track; but such lessons as New-England has received\r\nin the great drouth of 1870 will not always be given and endured in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII.\r\n\r\nUNDEVELOPED SOURCES OF POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more I consider the present state of our Agriculture, the more\r\nemphatic is my discontent with the farmer's present sources and command\r\nof power. The subjugation and tillage of a farm, like the running of a\r\nfactory or furnace, involves a continual use of Power; but the\r\nmanufacturer obtains his from sources which supply it cheaply and in\r\ngreat abundance, while the farmer has been content with an inferior\r\narticle, in limited supply, at a far heavier cost. Yet the stream which\r\nturns the factory's wheels and sets all its machinery in motion\r\ntraverses or skirts many farms as well, and, if properly harnessed, is\r\njust as ready to speed the plow as to impel the shuttles of a\r\nwoolen-mill, or revolve the cylinders of a calico-printery. Nature is\r\nimpartially kind to all her children; but some of them know how to\r\nprofit by her good-will far more than others. No doubt, we all have much\r\nyet to learn, and our grandchildren will marvel at the proofs of\r\nstupidity evinced in our highest achievements; but I am not mistaken in\r\nasserting that, as yet, the farmers' control of Nature's free gifts of\r\npower is very far inferior to that of nearly every other class of\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nI have been having much plowing done this Fall--in my orchards, for what\r\nI presume to be the good of the trees; on my drained swamp, because it\r\nis not yet fully subdued and sweetened, and I judge that the Winter's\r\nfreezing and thawing will aid to bring it into condition. And then my\r\nswamp lies so low and absolutely flat that the thaws and rains of Spring\r\nrender plowing it in season for Oats, or any other crop that requires\r\nearly seeding, a matter of doubt and difficulty. All the land I now\r\ncultivate, or seek to cultivate, has already been well plowed more than\r\nonce; no stump or stone impedes progress in the tracts I have plowed\r\nthis Fall; yet a good plow, drawn by two strong yoke of oxen, rarely\r\nbreaks up half an acre per day; and I estimate two acres per week about\r\nwhat has been averaged, at a cost of $18 for the plowman and driver;\r\noffsetting the oxen's labor against the work done by the men at the barn\r\nand elsewhere apart from plowing. In other words: I am confident that my\r\nplowing has cost me, from first to last, at least, $10 per acre, and\r\nwould have cost still more if it had been done as thoroughly as it\r\nought. I am quite aware that this is high--that sandy soils and dry\r\nloams are plowed much cheaper; and that farmers who plow wall (with whom\r\nI do not rank those who scratch the earth to a depth of four or five\r\ninches) do it at a much lower rate. Still, I estimate the average cost\r\nin this country of plowing land twelve inches deep at $5 per acre; and\r\nI am confident that it does not cost one cent less.\r\n\r\nNor is cost the only discouragement. There is not half so much nor so\r\nthorough plowing among us, especially in the Fall; as there should be.\r\nThe soil is, for a good part of the time, too dry or too wet; the\r\nweather is inclement, or the ground is frozen: so the plow must stand\r\nstill. At length, the signs are auspicious; the ground is in just the\r\nright condition; and we would gladly plow ten, twenty, fifty acres\r\nduring the brief period wherein it remains so; but this is impossible.\r\nOthers want to improve the opportunity as well as we; extra teams are\r\nrarely to be had at any price; and our own slow-moving oxen refuse to be\r\nhurried. Standing half a mile off, you can see them move; if your\r\neye-sight is keen, and you have some stationary object interposed\r\nwhereby to take an observation; but it is as much as ever. If your soil\r\nis such that you can use horses, you get on, of course, much faster; but\r\nall that you gain in breadth you are apt to lose in depth. There may be\r\nspans that will take the plow right along though you sink it to the\r\nbeam; but they are sure to be slow travelers. I never knew a span that\r\nwould plow an acre per day as I think it should be plowed; though, if\r\nyour only object be to get over as much ground as possible, you may\r\nafflict and titillate two acres, or as much more as you please.\r\n\r\nNow, I have before me a letter to _The Times_ (London) by Mr. William\r\nSmith, of Woolston, Bucks, who states that he has just harvested his\r\nfifteenth annual crop cultivated by steam-power, and has prepared his\r\nland for the sixteenth; and he gives details, showing that he breaks up\r\nand ridges heavy clay soils at the rate of six acres per day, and plows\r\nlands already in tillage at the rate of fully nine acres per day. He\r\ngives the total cost, (including wear and tear,) of breaking up a foot\r\ndeep and ridging 65 acres in September and October in this year, 1870,\r\nat L20 _6s. 6d._ or about $100 in gold: call it $112 in our greenbacks,\r\nand still it falls considerably below $2 (greenbacks) per acre. Say that\r\nlabor and fuel are twice as dear in this country as in England, and this\r\nwould make the cost of thoroughly pulverizing by steam-power a heavy\r\nclay soil to a depth of twelve inches less than $4 per acre here. I do\r\nnot believe this could be done by animal power at $10 per acre, not\r\nconsidering the difficulty of getting it thoroughly done at all. Mr.\r\nSmith pertinently says: \"Horse-power could not give at any cost such\r\nvaluable work as this steam-power ridging and subsoiling is.\" He tills\r\n166 acres in all, making the cost of steam-plowing his stubble-land _4s.\r\n8-1/2d._ per acre (say $1.30 greenback). And he gives this interesting\r\nitem:\r\n\r\n\"No. 5, light land, 12 acres, was ridge-plowed and subsoiled last year\r\nfor beans: that operation left the land, after the bean-crop came off,\r\nin so nice a state, that cultivating once over with horses, at a cost of\r\n_2s._ per acre, was all that was needed this Autumn for wheat next year.\r\nThe wheat was drilled four days back.\"\r\n\r\n--Now I am not commending Steam as the best source of power in aid of\r\nAgriculture. I hope we shall be able to do better ere long. I recognize\r\nthe enormous waste involved in the movement of an engine, boiler, etc.,\r\nweighing several tons, back and forth across our fields, and apprehend\r\nthat it must be difficult to avoid a compression of the soil therefrom.\r\nA stationary engine and boiler at either end of the field, hauling a\r\ngang of plows this way and that by means of ropes and pulleys, must\r\ninvolve a very heavy outlay for machinery and a considerable cost in its\r\nremoval from farm to farm, or even from field to field. Either of these\r\nmay be the best device yet perfected; but we are bound to do better in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPrecisely how and when the winds which sweep over our fields shall be\r\nemployed to pulverize and till the soil, are among the many things I do\r\nnot know; but, that the end will yet be achieved, I undoubtingly trust.\r\nI know somewhat--not much--of what has been done and is doing, both in\r\nEurope and America, to extend and diversify the utilization of wind as a\r\nsource of power, and to compress and retain it so that the gale which\r\nsweeps over a farm to-night may afford a reserve or fund of power for\r\nits cultivation on the morrow or thereafter. I know a little of what has\r\nbeen devised and done toward converting and transmitting, through the\r\nmedium of compressed air, the power generated by a waterfall--say\r\nNiagara or Minnehaha--so that it may be expended and utilized at a\r\ndistance of miles from its source, impelling machinery of all kinds at\r\nhalf the cost of steam. I know vaguely of what is being done with\r\nElectricity, with an eye to its employment in the production of power,\r\nby means of enginery not a tenth so weighty and cumbrous as that\r\nrequired for the generation and utilization of Steam, and by means of a\r\nconsumption (that is, transformation) of materials not a hundredth part\r\nso bulky and heavy as the water and steam which fill the boilers of our\r\nfactories and locomotives. I am no mechanician, and will not even guess\r\nfrom what source, through what agencies, the new power will be\r\nvouch-safed us which is in time to pulverize our fields to any required\r\ndepth with a rapidity, perfection, and economy, not now anticipated by\r\nthe great body of our farmers. But my faith in its achievement is\r\nundoubting; and, though I may not live to see it, I predict that there\r\nare readers of this essay who will find the forces abundantly generated\r\nall around us by the spontaneous movement of Wind, Water, and\r\nElectricity--one or more, and probably by all of them--so utilized and\r\nwielded as to lighten immensely the farmer's labor, while quadrupling\r\nits efficiency in producing all by which our Earth ministers to the\r\nsustenance and comfort of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII.\r\n\r\nRURAL DEPOPULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nComplaint is widely made of a decrease in the relative population of our\r\nrural districts; and not without reason, or, at least, plausibility. I\r\npresume the Census of 1870 will return no more farmers in the State of\r\nNew York, and probably some fewer in New England, than were shown by the\r\nCensus of 1860. The very considerable augmentation of the number of\r\ntheir people will be found living wholly in the cities and incorporated\r\nvillages. I doubt whether there are more farmers in the State of New\r\nYork to-day than there were in 1840, though the total population has\r\nmeantime doubled. Many farms have been transformed into country-seats\r\nfor city bankers, merchants, and lawyers; others have been consolidated,\r\nso that what were formerly two or three, now constitute but one; and,\r\nthough every body says, \"Our farms are too large for our capital,\" \"We\r\nrun over too much land,\" etc., etc., yet, I can hear of few farms that\r\nhave been, or are expected to be, divided, except into village or city\r\nlots; while the prevalent tendency is still the other way. An\r\ninefficient farmer dies heavily in debt, or is sold out by the sheriff:\r\nhis farm is rarely divided between two purchasers, while it is quite\r\noften absorbed into the estate of some thrifty neighbor; and thus small\r\nfarmers are selling out and moving westward much oftener than large\r\nones. Such are the obvious facts: now for some of the reasons:\r\n\r\nI. Our State, like New England, was originally all but covered by a\r\nheavy growth of forest. The removal of this timber involved very much\r\nhard work, most of which has been done in this century, and much of it\r\nby the present generation. When I first traversed Chautauqua County,\r\nforty-three years ago, from two-thirds to three-fourths of her acres\r\nmust have been still covered with the primeval forest--a tall, heavy\r\ngrowth of Beech, Maple, Hemlock, White Pine, etc., which yielded very\r\nslowly to the efforts of the average chopper. Many a pioneer gave half\r\nhis working hours for twenty years to the clearing off of Timber,\r\nFencing, cutting out roads, etc., and had not sixty acres in arable\r\ncondition at the last. Outside of the villages, the population of that\r\ncounty was probably as great in 1830 as it is to-day, though the annual\r\nproduction of her tillage was not half what it now is. Her farms are now\r\nmade; her remaining woodlands are worth about as much per acre as her\r\ntillage; there is now comparatively little timber-cutting, or\r\nland-clearing; and two-thirds of the pioneers, or their sons who\r\ninherited their farms, have sold out, or been sold out, and pushed\r\nfurther westward. Meantime, Grazing and Dairying have extensively\r\nsupplanted Grain-growing; and farmers who found more work than they\r\ncould do on 60 or 80 acres, now manage 160 to 320 acres with ease. I do\r\nnot say that they ought not to farm better; I only state the facts that\r\nthey thrive by this dairy-farming, and are not exhausting their lands.\r\nAnd what is true of Chautauqua is measurably true of half the rural\r\nCounties in our State.\r\n\r\nII. Formerly, Wood was the only fuel known to our farmers, while immense\r\nquantities of it were burned in our cities, at the salt-works, etc. At\r\npresent, wood is scarcely used for fuel, except as kindling, in any of\r\nour cities, villages, or manufactories, while the consumption of Coal by\r\nour farmers is already very large, and rapidly extending. All this\r\nreduces the demand for labor on our farms and in our forests, while\r\nincreasing the corresponding demand in the Coal Mines, and on the\r\nrailroads. Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, has doubled her population\r\nwithin the last twelve or fourteen years; and this at the expense of our\r\nrural districts.\r\n\r\nIII. Our agricultural implements and machinery grow annually more\r\neffective, and at the same time more costly. The outfit of a good farm\r\ncosts five-fold what it did forty years ago. The farmer makes and\r\nsecures his Hay far more rapidly and effectively than his father did,\r\nbut pays far more for Reapers, Mowers, Rakers, etc.; in other words, he\r\nmakes Winter work abridge that of Summer--makes a hundred days' work in\r\nsome village or city save thrice as many days' work on his farm. This\r\nenhances his profits, but swells our urban, while it diminishes our\r\nrural population.\r\n\r\nIV. Much has been said of the degeneracy and increasing sterility of the\r\nNew England Puritan stock. All this is shallow and absurd. There never\r\nbefore were so many people who proudly traced their origin to a New\r\nEngland ancestry as now. What is true in the premises is this: The New\r\nEngland stock is becoming very widely diffused, and is giving place, to\r\na considerable extent, to other elements in its original home. Forty\r\nyears ago, at least seven-eighths of the inhabitants of Boston were of\r\nNew England birth and lineage; now, hardly half are so. The descendants\r\nof the Pilgrims are scattered all over our wide country; while hundreds\r\nof thousands have flowed in from Ireland, from Germany, from Canada, to\r\nfill the places thus relinquished; and, since most of the immigrants,\r\nwhether into or out of New England, seek their future homes in the\r\nspring-time of life, their children are mainly born to them after rather\r\nthan before their migration. The Yankees have no fewer children than\r\nformerly; but they are now born in Minnesota, in Illinois, in Kansas;\r\nwhile those born in New England are, for identical reasons, in large\r\nproportion of Irish or of Canadian parentage. There are New England\r\ntownships, whereof most of the heads of families are long past the prime\r\nof life; their children having left them for more attractive\r\nlocalities, and the work on their farms being now done mainly by\r\nforeign-born employes. As a general rule, the boys first wandered off;\r\nleaving the girls only the alternative of following, or dying in\r\nmaidenhood. Marked diversities of race, of creed, and of education, have\r\nthus far prevented any considerable intermingling of the Yankee with the\r\nforeign element by marriage. And what is true of New England is\r\nmeasurably true of our own State.\r\n\r\nI have not intended by these observations to combat the assumption that\r\nour people too generally prefer other employments to farming. The\r\nobstacles to effective modern Agriculture--that is, to agriculture\r\nprosecuted by the help of efficient machinery--presented by that\r\nincessant alternation of rock and bog, which characterizes New England\r\nand some parts of New York, I have already noted; and they interpose a\r\nserious, discouraging impediment to agricultural progress. A farm\r\nintersected by two or three swamps and brooks, separated by steep,\r\nrocky, ridges, and dotted over with pebbly knolls, sometimes giving\r\nplace to a strip of sterile sand, is far more repulsive to the capable,\r\nintelligent farmer of to-day than it was to his grandfather. So far as\r\nmy observation extends, there are more New England farms on which you\r\ncannot, than on which you can, find ten acres in one unbroken area\r\nsuitable for planting to Corn, or sowing to Winter Grain. Hence,\r\nAgriculture in the East will always seem petty and irregular when\r\nbrought into contrast with the prairie cultivation of the West. Grain\r\ncan never be grown here so cheaply nor so abundantly as there; while the\r\ntendency of our pastures to cover themselves over with moss and\r\nworthless shrubs, unless frequently broken up and reseeded, makes even\r\ndairying more difficult and costly in New England and along its western\r\nborder than in almost any other part of our country.\r\n\r\nYet, these discouragements are balanced by compensations. Timber springs\r\nluxuriantly and grows rapidly throughout this region; while our harsh,\r\ncapricious climate gives to our Hickory, White Oak, White Ash, and other\r\nvarieties, qualities unknown to such grown elsewhere, while prized\r\neverywhere. Apples, and most fruits of the Temperate Zone, do well with\r\nus; while our cities and manufacturing villages proffer most capacious\r\nmarkets. Potatoes and other edible roots produce liberally, and\r\ngenerally command good prices. Hay sells for $12 to $30 per ton, is\r\neasily grown, and is in eager and increasing demand. We ought to produce\r\ntwice our present crop from the same area, and have need of every pound\r\nof it; for neither our cattle nor our sheep are nearly so numerous nor\r\nso well fed as they should be. In short, there is money to be made, by\r\nthose who have means and know how, by buying New England farms, tilling\r\nthem better, and growing much larger crops than their present occupants\r\nhave done. There are many who can do better in the West; but the right\r\nmen can still make money by farming this side of the Susquehanna and the\r\nGenesee; and I would gladly incite some thousands more of them to try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX.\r\n\r\nLARGE AND SMALL FARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is fascination for most minds in naked magnitude. The young\r\ncolonel, who can hardly handle a brigade effectively in battle, would\r\nlike of all things to command a great army; and the tiller of fifty\r\nrugged acres has his ravishing dreams of the delights inherent in a\r\ngreat Western farm, with its square miles of corn-fields, and its\r\nthousands of cattle. Each of them is partly right and partly wrong.\r\n\r\nThere are generals capable of commanding 100,000 men, Napoleon says\r\nthere were two such in his day--himself and another: and these generally\r\nfind the work they are fit for, without special effort or aspiration. So\r\nthere are men, each of whom can really farm a township, not merely let a\r\nherd of cattle roam over it unfed and unsheltered, living and dying as\r\nmay chance: the owners expecting to grow rich by their natural increase.\r\nThis _ranching_ is not properly farming at all, but a very different and\r\nfar ruder art. I judge that the farmers who can really till--or even\r\ngraze--several thousand acres of land, so as to realize a fair interest\r\non its value, are even scarcer than the farms so capacious.\r\n\r\nBut there is such a thing as farming on a large scale; and it is a good\r\nbusiness for those who understand it, and have all the means it\r\nrequires. The farmer who annually grows a thousand acres of good Grain,\r\nand takes reasonable care of a thousand head of Cattle, is to be held in\r\nall honor. He will usually grow both his Grain and his Beef cheaper than\r\na small farmer could do it, and will generally find a good balance on\r\nthe right side when he makes up and squares his accounts of a year's\r\noperations. I could recommend no man to run into debt for a great farm,\r\nexpecting that farm to work him out of it but he who inherited or has\r\nacquired a large farm, well stocked, and knows how to make it pay, may\r\nwell cling to it, and count himself fortunate in its possession. But the\r\ngreat farmer is already regarded with sufficient envy. Most boys would\r\ngladly be such as he is; the difficulty in the case is that they lack\r\nthe energy, persistency, resolution, and self-denial, requisite for its\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nWe will leave large farms and farming to recommend themselves, while we\r\nconsider more directly the opportunities and reasonable expectations of\r\nthe small farmer.\r\n\r\nThe impression widely current that money cannot be made on a small\r\nfarm--that, in farming, the great fish eat up the little ones--is\r\ndeduced from very imperfect data. I have admitted that Grain and Beef\r\ncan usually be produced at less cost on great than on small farms,\r\nthough the rule is not without exceptions. I only insist that there are\r\nroom and hope for the small farmer also, and that large farming can\r\nnever absorb nor enable us to dispense with small farms.\r\n\r\nI. And first with regard to Fruit. Some Tree-Fruits, as well as Grapes,\r\nare grown on a large scale in California--it is said, with profit. But\r\nnearly all our Pears, Apples, Cherries, Plums, etc., are grown by small\r\nfarmers or gardeners, and are not likely to be grown otherwise. All of\r\nthem need at particular seasons a personal attention and a vigilance\r\nwhich can seldom or never be accorded by the owners or renters of large\r\nfarms. Should small farms be generally absorbed into larger, our\r\nFruit-culture would thenceforth steadily decline.\r\n\r\nII. The same is even more true of the production of Eggs and the rearing\r\nof Fowls. I have had knowledge of several attempts at producing Eggs and\r\nFowls on a large scale in this country, but I have no trustworthy\r\naccount of a single decided success in such an enterprise. On the\r\ncontrary, many attempts to multiply Fowls by thousands have broken down,\r\njust when their success seemed secure. Some contagious disease, some\r\nunforeseen disaster, blasted the sanguine expectations of the\r\nexperimenter, and transmuted his gold into dross.\r\n\r\nYet, I judge that there is no industry more capable of indefinite\r\nextension, with fair returns, than Fowl-breeding on a moderate scale.\r\nEggs and Chickens are in universal demand. They are luxuries appreciated\r\nalike by rich and poor; and they might be doubled in quantity without\r\nmaterially depressing, the market. Our thronged and fashionable\r\nwatering-places are never adequately supplied with them; our cities\r\nhabitually take all they can get and look around for more. I believe\r\nthat twice the largest number of Chickens ever yet produced in one year\r\nmight be reared in 1871, with profit to the breeders. Even if others\r\nshould fail, the home market found in each family would prove signally\r\nelastic.\r\n\r\nThis industry should especially commend itself to poor widows,\r\nstruggling to retain and rear their children in frugal independence. A\r\nwidow who, in the neighborhood of a city or of a manufacturing village,\r\ncan rent a cottage with half an acre of southward-sloping, sunny land,\r\nwhich she may fence so tightly as to confine her Hens therein, whenever\r\ntheir roaming abroad would injure or annoy her neighbors, and who can\r\nincur the expense of constructing thereon a warm, commodious Hen-house,\r\nmay almost certainly make the production of Eggs and Fowls a source of\r\ncontinuous profit. If she can obtain cheaply the refuse of a\r\nslaughter-house for feed, giving with it meal or grain in moderate\r\nquantities, and according that constant, personal, intelligent\r\nsupervision, without which Fowl-breeding rarely prospers, she may\r\nreasonably expect it to pay, while affording her an occupation not\r\nsubject to the caprices of an employer, and not requiring her to spend\r\nher days away from home.\r\n\r\nIII. Though the ordinary Market Vegetables may be grown on large farms,\r\nthe fact that they seldom are is significant. Cabbages, Peas, Poled\r\nBeans, Tomatoes, and even Potatoes, are mainly grown on small farms, as\r\nthey always have been. There are sections wherein no cash market for\r\nVegetables exists or can be relied on; and here they will continue to be\r\ngrown to the extent only of the growers' respective needs; but wherever\r\nthe prevalence of manufactures or the neighborhood of a great city gives\r\nreasonable assurance of a market, they are grown at a profit per acre\r\nwhich is rarely realized from a Grain-crop. No less than $100 per acre\r\nis often, if not generally, achieved by the growers of Cabbage around\r\nthis city; and this not from rich, deep garden-mold, but from fair\r\nfarming land, underdrained, subsoiled, and liberally manured.\r\n\r\nThe careless, slipshod farmer may do better--that is, he will not fail\r\nso signally--in Grain cultivation; but there are few more decided or\r\nbrilliant successes than have been achieved within the last few years\r\nwithin sight of this City, and wholly in the tillage of small farms.\r\n\r\nI trust I have here said enough to show that there is a legitimate and\r\npromising field for agricultural enterprise and effort, other than that\r\nwhich contemplates the acquisition and rule of a township, and that,\r\nwhile farming on a large area is to many attractive and inspiring, there\r\nare scope and incitement also for tillage on a humbler scale--for\r\ntillage that permits no weed to ripen seed, and no nest of caterpillars\r\nto flourish a month undisturbed--for tillage that achieves large crops\r\nand profits from small areas, and rejoices in that neatness and\r\nperfection of culture attainable only in the management of small farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL.\r\n\r\nEXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machinery whereby the farmer of our day converts into cash or other\r\nvalues that portion of his products which is not consumed in his house\r\nor on his farm, seems to me lamentably imperfect. Let me illustrate my\r\nmeaning:\r\n\r\nAfter three all but fruitless years, we have this year a bountiful\r\nApple-crop, in this State and (I believe) throughout the North. Our old\r\norchards being still, for the most part, preserved and in bearing\r\ncondition, while a good many young ones, planted ten to twenty years\r\nago, begin to fruit considerably, we had, throughout the three Fall\r\nmonths, a superabundance of this homely, wholesome, palatable fruit. It\r\nshould have been cheap for the great body of our mechanics and laborers\r\nto provide their families with all the ripe, good Apples that they could\r\nconsume without injuring themselves by gluttony. Good Apples should have\r\nbeen constantly displayed on every workingman's table, to be eaten raw\r\nas a dessert, or baked and eaten with bread and milk for breakfast or\r\nsupper. Each provident housewife should now have her tub of applesauce,\r\nher barrel of dried apples, or both, for Winter use; while a dozen\r\nbushels of good keepers should be stored in every cellar, to be drawn\r\nupon from day to day during the next four or five months. In short,\r\nApples should have been and be, from last August to next May, as common\r\nas bread and potatoes, and should have been and be as freely eaten in\r\nevery household and by every fireside.\r\n\r\nHow nearly have we realized this?\r\n\r\nI will not guess how many millions of bushels have rotted under the\r\ntrees that bore them, been eaten by animals to little or no profit, or\r\nturned into cider that did not sell for so much as it cost, counting the\r\nApples of no value. Living immediately on a railroad that rims into this\r\nCity, wherefrom my place is 35 miles distant, I should be able to do\r\nbetter with Apples than most growers; and yet I judge that half my\r\nApples were of no use to me. Many of them sold in this City for $1 per\r\nbarrel, including the cask, which cost me 40 cents; and, when you have\r\nadded the cost of transportation, you can guess that I had no surplus,\r\nafter paying men $1.50 per day for picking and barreling them. I sold\r\nall I could to vinegar-makers at fifty cents per bushel for\r\ncider-apples--the casks being returned. But they could not take all I\r\nwished to sell them, there being so many sellers pressing to get rid of\r\ntheir windfalls before they rotted on their hands that even this market\r\nwas glutted. That it was much worse for the farmer a dozen miles from a\r\nrailroad and a hundred from the nearest city, none can doubt. I have\r\nheard that, in parts of Connecticut, cider was sold for fifty cents per\r\nbarrel to whoever would furnish casks, and that their size was hardly\r\nconsidered. Manifestly, this left nothing for the apples.\r\n\r\nIf Apples could have been daily supplied to our poorer citizens in such\r\nquantities as they could conveniently take, at from fifty to\r\nseventy-five cents per bushel, according to quality and comeliness, I am\r\nconfident that this City and its suburbs would have taken Two or Three\r\nMillions of bushels more than they have done; and the same is true of\r\nother cities. But the poor rarely buy a barrel of Apples at once; and\r\nthey have been required to pay as much for half a peck as I could get\r\nfor a bushel just like them. In other words: the hucksters and middlemen\r\nset so high a price on their respective services in dividing up a barrel\r\nof Apples and conveying them from the rural producer to the urban\r\nconsumer that a large portion of the farmer's apples must rot on his\r\nhands or be sold by him for less than the cost of harvesting, while the\r\npoor of the cities find them too dear to be freely eaten.\r\n\r\nNor are Apples singular in this respect. I would like to grow a thousand\r\nbushels of English (round) and French or Swede Turnips per annum if I\r\ncould be sure of getting $1 per barrel for them delivered at the\r\nrailroad. If the poor of this City could buy such Turnips throughout\r\ntheir season by the half peck at the rate of $2 per barrel, I believe\r\nthey would buy and eat many more than they do. But they are usually\r\nasked twenty-five cents per half peck, which is at the rate of $5 per\r\nbarrel; and at this rate they hold them too dear for every-day use. So\r\nthe Turnips are not grown, or the cattle are invited to clear them off\r\nbefore they rot and become worthless and nuisance.\r\n\r\nQuite often, a green youth undertakes to get rich by farming near some\r\ngreat city. He has heard and believes that Cabbages bring from $5 to $8\r\nand even $10 per hundred, Squashes from $10 to $25 per hundred,\r\nWatermelons from $20 to $50, and so on. He has made his calculations on\r\nthis basis, and sanguinely expects to make money rapidly. But his\r\nproducts, in the first place, fall short of his estimates; they are not\r\nready for market so soon as he expected they would be; and, when at\r\nlength they are ready, every one else seems to have rushed in ahead of\r\nhim. The market is glutted; no one seems to want his \"truck\" at any\r\nfigure; he sells it for a song, and quits farming disgusted and\r\nbankrupt. May be, his stuff would have sold much better next week or\r\nthe week after; but he could not afford to bring it to market and take\r\nit back day after day, on the chance that the demand for it would\r\nimprove by-and-by. I judge that more young men have on this account\r\nturned their backs on farming, after a brief trial, than on any other.\r\nThey might have borne up against the shortness of their crops, hoping\r\nfor better luck next time; but the necessity for selling them for a\r\nprice that would not have reimbursed their cost, had they been ever so\r\nluxuriant, utterly disheartens and alienates them.\r\n\r\nI preach no crusade against hucksters and middlemen. I hold them, in the\r\nactual state of things, benefactors to both producers and consumers. In\r\nso far as they deal honestly and meet promptly their obligations, they\r\ndeserve commendation rather than reproach. What I urge is, that more\r\neconomical and efficient machinery of exchange and distribution ought to\r\nbe devised and set at work--machinery that would do all that is required\r\nat a moderate, reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nI would like to see one of our solvent, well-managed Railroads advertise\r\nthat it would henceforth buy at any of its stations all the farmers'\r\nproduce that might be offered, and pay the highest prices that the state\r\nof the markets would justify. Let its agents purchase whatever came\r\nalong--a basket of eggs, a coop of chickens, a barrel of apples, a sack\r\nof beans, a pail of currants--anything that could be sold in the city to\r\nwhich it runs, and which would conduce to human sustenance or comfort.\r\nIts object should be Freight--the rapid and vast increase of its\r\ntransportations, not extra profit on the articles transported. But let\r\nits agents be ready to buy at fair prices whatever was offered, paying\r\ncash down, and pushing everything purchased directly into market, so as\r\nto have the money back to buy more with directly. The Railroad Company,\r\nthus owning nearly everything edible it brought into market, would buy\r\nand sell at uniform prices, and not bid against itself, as a crowd of\r\nhucksters and middlemen will often do. I am confident that a Railroad\r\nthat would inaugurate this system on a right basis, saying to every\r\nfarmer living near it, \"Grow whatever your soil is best adapted to, and\r\nbring it to our station: there, you shall have cash down for it, at the\r\nhighest price we can afford to give,\" would rapidly double and quadruple\r\nits freights, and would thus build up a business which has no parallel\r\nunder the present system.\r\n\r\nIt is urged, in opposition to this proposal, that a Railroad so managed\r\nwould monopolize markets, and deal on its own terms with the producer\r\nand consumer. If there were but one railroad entering a great city, and\r\nno other mode of reaching it, this objection would be plausible, but not\r\nin the actual case. Whoever chose would be at liberty to start an\r\nopposition, and to use the railroad or dispense with it as he found\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI.\r\n\r\nWINTER WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE dearth of employment in Winter for farm laborers is a great and\r\ngrowing evil. Thousands, being dismissed from work on the farms in\r\nNovember, drift away to some city, under a vague, mistaken impression\r\nthat there must be work at some rate where so much is being done and so\r\nmany require service, and squander their means and damage their morals\r\nin fruitless quest of what is not there to be had. When Spring at length\r\narrives, they sneak back to the rural districts, ragged, penniless,\r\ndebauched, often diseased, and every way deteriorated, by their Winter\r\nplunge. For their sakes not only, but for the sakes also of those who\r\nwill employ and those who must work with them hereafter, this drifting\r\nto the cities should be stopped.\r\n\r\nIn its present magnitude, it is a very modern evil. Far within my\r\nrecollection, there was timber to cut and haul to the saw-mill, wood to\r\ncut, draw, and prepare for the year's fuel, with forest-land to be\r\ncleared and fitted for future cultivation, even in New-England. Those\r\nwho chose to work with ax or team were seldom idle in Winter. Now, there\r\nis little timber to cut, little land to clear, and coal is rapidly\r\nsupplanting wood as fuel. So a larger and larger number of farm laborers\r\nis annually turned off when the ground freezes to live as they may for\r\nthe next three or four months.\r\n\r\nI recognize the right of the farmer, who has given twelve or more hours\r\nper day to the tillage of his acres and the saving of his crops\r\nthroughout the genial months, to take the world more easily in Winter.\r\nHe should now have leisure to return visits, to post and balance his\r\nbooks, and to improve his mind by study and reflection. Having worked\r\nhard when he must, he ought to rest and recuperate when he can. But he\r\ngravely errs who supposes that, the ground being frozen, there is no\r\nlonger work to be done on the farm until the ground is fit to plow\r\nagain. On the contrary, he who realizes that the farmer is a\r\nmanufacturer of food and fibrous substances from raw materials of far\r\ninferior value must see that, so soon as one harvest has been secured,\r\nthe cultivator should devote his attention to the collection and\r\nutilization of the elements wherefrom a larger crop may be obtained from\r\nthe same acres next season.\r\n\r\nAnd first as to Muck. No one who has not valued and sought it is likely\r\nto know how generally abundant and accessible this material is. I have\r\nfound it in inexhaustible supply on the land of a pretty good cultivator\r\nwho, after working a fair farm ten years, sold it because (as he\r\nsupposed) it was destitute of this basis of extensive fertilization.\r\n\"Seek, and ye shall find,\" implies that those who do not seek will\r\nrarely find; and such is the fact. Where rock abounds, Muck is rarely\r\nwanting. It covers many thousand acres of Jersey sands, where rock is\r\nunknown; but show me a region ridged or ribbed with rock, and I shall\r\nconfidently expect to find Muck on it, though none has been known or\r\nsupposed to exist there. And he who either has or can buy a bed of Muck\r\nwithin half a mile of his barn, his sty, his hen-house, may dig and draw\r\nfrom it all Winter with a moral certainty that it will generously reward\r\nhis outlay. Begin as soon after haying as you can spare the time, and\r\ncut an outlet so deep that you may thereafter work dryshod; thenceforth,\r\ndig and pile on the nearest accessible spot of dry ground, to be drawn\r\naway to the barn-yard and out-houses as opportunity presents itself.\r\nBut, even though you have done nothing till the ground freezes, do not\r\nsay it is now too late, but set to work. You can often team in Winter\r\nwhere you could not at any other season; and, in digging Muck from a\r\nswamp or bog well frozen over, you are not apt to be troubled with\r\nwater. Draw all you can; but dig much more; for no money at lawful\r\ninterest pays so well as Muck left to dry and cure for months before you\r\ndraw it. I think I do not over-estimate the average value of a cubic\r\nyard of Muck, well cured and mixed with warmer fertilizers before\r\napplication to the soil, at one dollar; and I think there are few\r\nfarmers in the Old Thirteen States who cannot obtain it for less than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWhere Muck is not to be had, I believe the tiller of a sandy or gravelly\r\nfarm who can get access to a bed or bank of clay may profitably dig and\r\ndraw this, to be used as he would use Muck if he had it, and even for\r\ndirect application to the soil. I do not think this method the most\r\nadvisable; yet I feel sure that clay spread over a sandy or gravelly\r\nfield that has been laid down to grass is worth fifty cents per cubic\r\nyard wherever Hay is worth $12 per tun; but I would wish to apply it not\r\nlater than December.\r\n\r\nHe who has fit places of deposit should draw all his Lime, Plaster, and\r\nother commercial fertilizers, in Winter, so as to be ready for use when\r\nrequired. Mix your Lime while fresh from the kiln with Muck, at the rate\r\nof a bushel of the former to a cubic yard of the latter, and the Muck\r\nwill be ready for use far sooner than it otherwise would be. Be careful\r\n_not_ to mix Lime with animal manures in any case, since it expels\r\nAmmonia, whereas the sulphur of Plaster combines with that volatile\r\nelement and fixes it. There are some farmers who do, but twenty times as\r\nmany who do not, use Plaster enough about their stables and pig-pens.\r\nThey ought to realize that a bad smell implies a waste of Ammonia, which\r\na farmer, unless very rich, can hardly afford.\r\n\r\nFences should all be scrutinized as Winter goes off, and put into\r\nthorough condition for next season's service.\r\n\r\nFruit-trees should be relieved of all dead or dying branches, all\r\nsuckers, and cut back where towering to high, or spreading too wide. It\r\nmay be better for the trees to do all pruning in May or June; but the\r\nfarmer who defers it to that season is very likely to be hurried into\r\npostponing it to another year--and another.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a forest of second or later growth which would not pay\r\nfor thinning and trimming, if well done. That which is out may be turned\r\nto good account as bean-poles, pea-brush, Summer fuel, etc., while that\r\nwhich is left will grow faster, taller, and more shapely, to reward you\r\ndoubly for your pains.\r\n\r\n--These are but suggestions. Any farmer can add to or improve upon them\r\nif he will give an hour's thought to the subject. The best laborers can\r\nbe hired for a full year at a price not very much exceeding that which\r\nwill secure their services for eight or nine months. In the interest\r\nalike of good crops and good morals, I urge every one who can to resolve\r\nthat he will henceforth hire by the year, or in some way manage to\r\nemploy his laborers in Winter as well as in Summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII.\r\n\r\nSUMMING UP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing essays, I have set forth, as clearly as I could, the\r\nfacts within my knowledge which seem calculated to cast light upon the\r\nfarmer's vocation, and the principles or rules of action which they have\r\nsuggested to my mind. I have been careful not to throw any false,\r\ndelusive halo over this indispensable calling, and by no means to induce\r\nthe belief that the farmer's lot is necessarily and uniformly a happy\r\none. I know that his is not the royal road to rapid acquisition, and\r\nthat few men are likely to amass great wealth by quietly tilling the\r\nsoil. I know, moreover, that what passes for farming among us is not so\r\nnoble, so intellectual, so attractive, a pursuit as it might and should\r\nbe--that most farmers might farm better and live to better purpose than\r\nthey do. Of all the false teaching, I most condemn that which flatters\r\nfarmers as though they were demigods and their calling the grandest and\r\nthe happiest ever followed by mortals, when the hearer, unless very\r\ngreen, must feel that the speaker doesn't believe one word of all be\r\nutters; for, if he did, he would be farming, instead of living by some\r\nprofession, and talking as though his auditors did not know wheat from\r\nchaff. I regard the Agriculture of this country as very far below the\r\nstandard which, it should ere this have reached: I hold that the great\r\nmass of our cultivators might and should farm better than they do, and\r\nthat better farming would render their sons better citizens and better\r\nmen. If a single line of this little work should seem calculated to\r\ncajole its readers into self-complacency rather than instruct them, I\r\nbeg them to believe that their impression wrongs my purpose.\r\n\r\nI am fully aware that others have treated my theme with fuller knowledge\r\nand far greater ability than I brought to its discussion. \"Then why not\r\nleave them the field?\" Simply because, when all have written who can\r\nelucidate my theme, at least three-fourths of those who ought to study\r\nand ponder it will not have read any treatise whatever upon\r\nAgriculture--will hardly have yet regarded it as a theme whereon books\r\nshould be written and read. And, since there may be some who will read\r\nthis treatise for its writer's sake--will read it when they could not be\r\npersuaded to do like honor to a more elaborate and erudite work--I have\r\nwritten in the hope of arousing in some breasts a spirit of inquiry with\r\nregard to Agriculture as an art based on Science--a spirit which, having\r\nbeen awakened, will not fall again into torpor, but which will lead on\r\nto the perusal and study of profounder and better books.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing essays, I have sought to establish the following\r\npropositions:\r\n\r\n1. That _good_ farming is and must ever be a paying business, subject,\r\nlike all others, to mischances and pull-backs, and to the general law\r\nthat the struggle up from nothing to something is ever an arduous and\r\nalmost always a slow process. In the few instances where wealth and\r\ndistinction have been swiftly won, they have rarely proved abiding.\r\nThere are pursuits wherein success is more envied and dazzling than in\r\nAgriculture; but there is none wherein efficiency and frugality are more\r\ncertain to secure comfort and competence.\r\n\r\n2. Though the poor man must often go slowly, where wealth may attain\r\nperfection at a bound, and though he may sometimes seem compelled to\r\ntill fields not half so amply fertilized as they should be, it is\r\nnevertheless inflexibly true that bounteous crops are grown at a profit,\r\nwhile half and quarter crops are produced at a loss. A rich man may\r\nafford to grow poor crops, because he can afford to lose by his year's\r\nfarming, while the poor man cannot. He ought, therefore, to till no more\r\nacres than he can bring into good condition--to sow no seed, plow no\r\nfield, where he is not justified in expecting a good crop. Better five\r\nacres amply fertilized and thoroughly tilled than twenty acres which can\r\nat best make but a meager return, and which a dry or a wet season must\r\ndoom to partial if not absolute failure.\r\n\r\n3. In choosing a location, the farmer should resolve to choose once for\r\nall. Roaming from State to State, from section to section, is a sad and\r\nfar too common mistake. Not merely is it true that \"The rolling stone\r\ngathers no moss,\" but the farmer who wanders from place to place never\r\nacquires that intimate knowledge of soil and climate which is essential\r\nto excellence in his vocation. He cannot read the clouds and learn when\r\nto expect rain, when he may look for days of sunshine, as he could if he\r\nhad lived twenty years on the same place. Choose your home in the East,\r\nthe South, the Center, the West, if you will (and each section has its\r\npeculiar advantages); but choose once for all, and, having chosen,\r\nregard that choice as final.\r\n\r\n4. Our young men are apt to plunge into responsibilities too hastily.\r\nThey buy farms while they lack at once experience and means, incur\r\nlosses and debts by consequent miscalculations, and drag through life a\r\nweary load, which sours them against their pursuit, when the fault is\r\nentirely their own. No youth should undertake to manage a farm until\r\nafter several years of training for that task under the eye of a capable\r\nmaster of the art of tilling the soil. If he has enjoyed the requisite\r\nadvantages on his father's homestead, he may possibly be qualified to\r\nmanage a farm at twenty-one; but there are few who might not profitably\r\nwait and learn, in the pay of some successful cultivator, for several\r\nyears longer; while I cannot recall an instance of a youth rushing out\r\nof school or a city counting-house to show old farmers how their work\r\nought to be done, that did not result in disaster. It is very well to\r\nknow what Science teaches with regard to farming; but no man was ever a\r\nthoroughly good farmer who had not spent some years in actual contact\r\nwith the soil.\r\n\r\n5. While every one says of his neighbor, \"He farms too much land,\" the\r\ngreed of acquisition does not seem at all chastened. Men stagger under\r\nloads of debt to-day, who might relieve themselves by selling off so\r\nmuch of their land as they cannot profitably use; but every one seems\r\nintent on holding all he can, as if in expectation of a great advance in\r\nits market value. And yet you can buy farms in every old State in the\r\nUnion as cheaply per acre as they could have been bought in like\r\ncondition sixty years ago; and I doubt their selling higher sixty years\r\nhence than they do now. No doubt, there _are_ lands, in the vicinage of\r\ngrowing cities or villages, that have greatly advanced in value; but\r\nthese are exceptions: and I counsel every young farmer, every poor\r\nfarmer, to buy no more land than he can cultivate thoroughly, save such\r\nas he needs for timber. Never fear that there will not be more land for\r\nsale when you shall have the money wherewith to buy it; but shun debt as\r\nyou would the plague, and prefer forty acres all your own to a square\r\nmile heavily mortgaged. I never lifted a mill-stone; but I have\r\nundertaken to carry debts, and they are fearfully heavy.\r\n\r\n6. I know that most American farms east of the Roanoke and the Wabash\r\nhave too many fields and fences, and that the too prevalent custom of\r\nallowing cattle to prowl over meadow, tillage and forest, from September\r\nto May, picking up a precarious and inadequate subsistence by browsing\r\nand foraging at large, is slovenly, unthrifty, and hardly consistent\r\nwith the requirements of good neighborhood. It is at best a miseducation\r\nof your cattle into lawless habits. I do not know just where and when\r\n_all_ pasturing becomes wasteful and improvident; but I do know that\r\npasturing fosters thistles, briers, and every noxious weed, and so is\r\ninconsistent with cleanly and thorough tillage. I know that the same\r\nacres will feed far more stock, and keep them in better condition, if\r\ntheir food be cut and fed to them, than if they are sent out to gather\r\nit for themselves. I know that the cost of cutting their grass and other\r\nfodder with modern machinery need not greatly exceed that of driving\r\nthem to remote pastures in the morning and hunting them up at nightfall.\r\nI know that penning them ten hours of each twenty-four in a filthy yard,\r\nwhere they have neither food nor drink, is unwise; and I feel confident\r\nthat it is already high time, wherever good grass-land is worth $100 per\r\nacre, to limit pasturage to one small field, as near the center of the\r\nfarm as may be, wherein shade and good water abound, into which green\r\nrye, clover, timothy, oats, sowed corn, stalks, etc., etc., may\r\nsuccessively be thrown from every side, and where shelter from a cold,\r\ndriving storm, is provided; and that, if cows could be milked here and\r\nleft through night as well as day, it would be found good economy.\r\n\r\n7. I know that most of us are slashing down our trees most\r\nimprovidently, and thus compelling our children to buy timber at thrice\r\nthe cost at which we might and should have grown it. I know that it is\r\nwasteful to let White Birch, Hemlock, Scrub Oak, Pitch Pine, Dogwood,\r\netc., start up and grow on lands which might be cheaply sown with the\r\nseeds of Locust, White Oak, Hickory, Sugar Maple, Chestnut, Black\r\nWalnut, and White Pine. I know that no farm in a settled region is so\r\nlarge that its owner can really afford to surrender a considerable\r\nportion of it to growing indifferent cord-wood when it would as freely\r\ngrow choice timber if seeded therefor; and I feel sure that there are\r\nfew farms so small that a portion of each might not be profitably\r\ndevoted to the growing of valuable trees. I know that the common\r\npresumption that land so devoted will yield no return for a life-time is\r\nwrong--know that, if thickly and properly seeded, it will begin to yield\r\nbean-poles, hoop-poles, etc., the fifth or sixth year from planting, and\r\nthenceforth will yield more and more abundantly forever. I know that\r\n_good_ timber, in any well-peopled region, should not be _cut off_, but\r\n_cut out_--thinned judiciously but moderately and trimmed up, so that it\r\nshall grow tall and run to trunk instead of branches; and I know that\r\nthere are all about us millions of acres of rocky crests and\r\nacclivities, steep ravines and sterile sands, that ought to be seeded to\r\ntimber forthwith, kept clear of cattle, and devoted to tree-growing\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\n8. I do not know that all lands may be profitably underdrained. Wooded\r\nuplands, I know, could not be. Fields which slope considerably, and so\r\nregularly that water never stagnates upon or near their surface, do very\r\nwell without. Light, leachy sands, like those of Long Island, Southern\r\nJersey, Eastern Maryland, and the Carolinas, seem to do fairly without.\r\nYet my conviction is strong that _nearly all land which is to be\r\npersistently cultivated will in time be underdrained_. I would urge no\r\nfarmer to plunge up to his neck into debt in order to underdrain his\r\nfarm. But I _would_ press every one who has no experience on this head\r\nto select his wettest field, or the wettest part of such field, and,\r\nhaving carefully read and digested Waring's, French's, or some other\r\napproved work on the subject, procure file and proceed next Fall to\r\ndrain that field or part of a field thoroughly, taking especial\r\nprecautions against back-water, and watch the effect until satisfied\r\nthat it will or will not pay to drain further. I think few, have drained\r\none acre thoroughly, and at no unnecessary cost, without being impelled\r\nby the result to drain more and faster until they had tiled at least\r\nhalf their respective farms.\r\n\r\n9. As to irrigation, I doubt that there is a farm in the United States\r\nwhere _something_ might not be profitably done forthwith to secure\r\nadvantage from the artificial retention and application of water.\r\nWherever a brook or runnel crosses or skirts a farm, the question--\"Can\r\nthe water here running uselessly by be retained, and in due season\r\nequably diffused over some portion of this land?\"--at once presents\r\nitself. One who has never looked with this now will be astonished at the\r\nfacility with which some acres of nearly every farm may be irrigated.\r\nOften, a dam that need not cost $20 will suffice to hold back ten\r\nthousand barrels of water, so that it may be led off along the upper\r\nedge of a slope or glade, falling off just enough to maintain a gentle,\r\nsteady current, and so providing for the application of two or three\r\ninches of water to several acres of tillage or grass just when the\r\nexigencies of crop and season most urgently require such irrigation. Any\r\nfarmer east of the Hudson can tell where such an application would have\r\ndoubled the crop of 1870, and precluded the hard necessity of selling or\r\nkilling cattle not easily replaced.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is but a rude beginning. In time, we shall dam very\r\nconsiderable streams mainly to this end, and irrigate hundreds and\r\nthousands of acres from a single pond or reservoir. Wells will be sunk\r\non plains and gentle swells now comparatively arid and sterile, and wind\r\nor steam employed to raise water into reservoirs whence wide areas of\r\nsurrounding or subjacent land will be refreshed at the critical moment,\r\nand thus rendered bounteously productive. On the vast, bleak, treeless\r\nPlains of the wild West, even Artesian wells will be sunk for this\r\npurpose; and the water thus obtained will prove a source of fertility\r\nas well as refreshment, enriching the soil by the minerals which it\r\nholds in solution, and insuring bounteous crops from wide stretches of\r\nnow barren and worthless desert. Immigration will yet thickly dot the\r\ngreat Sahara with oases of verdure and plenty; but it will, long ere\r\nthat, have covered the valleys of our Great Basin and those which skirt\r\nthe affluents of the savage and desolate Colorado with a beauty and\r\nthrift surpassing the dreams of poets. And yet, its easiest and readiest\r\ntriumphs are to be won right here--in the valleys of the Connecticut,\r\nthe Hudson, the Susquehanna, and the Potomac.\r\n\r\n10. As to Commercial Fertilizers, I think I have been well paid for the\r\napplication of Gypsum (Plaster of Paris) to my upland grass at the rate\r\nof one bushel per acre per annum, while my tillage has been supplied\r\nwith it by dusting my stables with it after each cleaning, and so\r\napplying it mingled with barn-yard manures. Lime (unslaked) from burned\r\noyster-shells, costing me from 25 to 30 cents per bushel delivered, I\r\nhave applied liberally, and I judge, with profit. Bones, ground, (the\r\nfiner the better) I have largely and I think advantageously used; but my\r\nland had been mainly pastured for nearly two centuries before I bought\r\nit, and thus continually drained of Phosphates, yet never replenished:\r\nso my experience does not prove that the farmers of newer lands ought to\r\nbuy bones, though I advise them to apply all they can save or pick up at\r\nsmall cost. Pound them very fine with a beetle or ax-head on a flat\r\nstone, and give them to your fowls: if they refuse a part of them, your\r\nsoil will prove less dainty. I am not sure that it pays to buy any\r\nmanufactured Phosphate when you can get Raw Bone; though I doubt not\r\nthat, for instant effect, the Phosphate is far superior. As to Guano, it\r\nhas not paid me; but that may be the fault of careless or unskillful\r\napplication. I judge that any one who has to deal with sterile sands\r\nthat will not bring Clover, may wisely apply 400 pounds of Guano per\r\nacre, provided he has nothing else that will answer the purpose. After\r\nhe has produced one good stand of Clover, I doubt that he can afford to\r\nbuy more Guano, unless he can apply it to better purpose than I have yet\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nI have a strong impression that most farmers can do better at making and\r\nsaving fertilizers than by buying them. Lime and Sulphur (Gypsum), if\r\nyour soil lacks them, you must buy; but a good farmer who keeps even a\r\nspan of horses, three or four cows, as many pigs, and a score of fowls,\r\ncan make for $100 fertilizers which I would rather have than two tuns of\r\nGuano, costing him $180 to $200. If he has a patch of bog or a miry pond\r\non his farm--any place where frogs will live--he can dig thence, in the\r\ndryest time next Fall, two or three hundred loads of Muck, which, having\r\nbeen left to dry on the nearest high ground till November or later, and\r\nthen drawn up and dumped into his barn-yard, pig-pen, and fowl-house,\r\nwill be ready to come out next Spring in season for corn-planting, and,\r\nbeing liberally applied, will do as much for his crop as two tons of\r\nGuano would, and will strengthen his land far more. If he has no Muck,\r\nand no neighbor who can spare it as well as not, let him at midsummer\r\ncut all the weeds growing on and around his farm, and in the Fall gather\r\nall the leaves that can be impounded, using these as litter for his\r\ncattle and beds for his pigs, and he will be agreeably surprised at the\r\nbulk of his heap next Spring.\r\n\r\nI am an intense believer in Home Production. We send ten thousand miles\r\nfor Guano, and suffer the equally valuable excretions of our cities to\r\nrun to waste in rivers and bays, poisoning or driving away the fish, and\r\nfilling the air with stench and pestilence. No farmer ever yet\r\nintelligently _tried_ to enrich his land and was defeated by lack of\r\nmaterial. He may not be able to do all he would like to at first; but\r\npersistent effort cannot be baffled.\r\n\r\n11. Shallow culture is the most crying defect of our average farming.\r\nPoverty may sometimes excuse it; but the excuse is stretched quite too\r\nfar. If a farmer has but a poor span of horses, or a light yoke of thin\r\nsteers, he cannot plow land as it should be plowed; but let him double\r\nteams with his neighbor, and plow alternate clays on either farm; or, if\r\nthis may not be, let him buy or borrow a sub-soil plow, and go once\r\naround with his surface plow, then hitch on to the sub-soil, and run\r\nanother furrow in the bottom of the former. There are a few intervales\r\nof rich, mellow soil, deposited by the inundations of countless ages,\r\nwhere shallow culture will answer, because the roots of the plants run\r\nfreely through fertile earth never yet disturbed by the plow; but these\r\nmarked and meagre exceptions do not invalidate the truth that\r\nnine-tenths of our tillage is neither so deep nor so thorough as it\r\nshould be. As a rule, the feeding-roots of plants do not run below the\r\nbottom of the furrows, though in some instances they do; and he who\r\nfancies that five or six inches of soil will, under our fervid suns,\r\nwith our Summers often rainless for weeks, produce as bounteous and as\r\nsure a crop as twelve to eighteen inches, is impervious to fact or\r\nreason. He might as sensibly maintain that you could draw as long and as\r\nheavily against a deposit in bank of $500 as against one of $1,500.\r\n\r\n12. Finally, and as the sum of my convictions, we need more thought,\r\nmore study, more intellect, infused into our Agriculture, with less\r\nblind devotion to a routine which, if ever judicious, has long since\r\nceased to be so. The tillage which a pioneer, fighting single-handed and\r\nall but empty-handed with a dense forest of giant trees, which he can do\r\nno better than to cut down and burn, found indispensable among their\r\nstumps and roots, is not adapted to the altered circumstances of his\r\ngrandchildren. If our most energetic farmers would abstract ten hours\r\neach per week from their incessant drudgery, and devote them to reading\r\nand reflection with regard to their noble calling, they would live\r\nlonger, live to better purpose, and bequeath a better example, with more\r\nproperty, to their children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy self-imposed task is done. I undertook to tell What I Know of Farming\r\nthrough one brief essay for each week in 1870; and, in the face of\r\nmultifarious and pressing duties, and in despite of a severe, protracted\r\nillness, the work has been prosecuted to completion. Had I not kept\r\nahead of it while in health, there were weeks when I must have left it\r\nunaccomplished, as I was too ill to write or even stand.\r\n\r\nI close with the avowal of my joyful trust that these essays, slight and\r\nimperfect as they are, will incite thousands of young farmers to feel a\r\nloftier pride in their calling and take a livelier interest in its\r\nimprovement, and that many will be induced by them to read abler and\r\nbetter works on Agriculture and the sciences which minister to its\r\nefficiency and impel its progress toward a perfection which few as yet\r\nhave even faintly foreseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACCOUNTS--ACCOUNTS IN FARMING, chap. xxxv, 207;\r\n    the causes of pecuniary failure, 207;\r\n    loss from waste of time, 207;\r\n    the author has found all successful farmers rigid economists of\r\n      time, 208;\r\n    farmers urged to keep a rigid account of how they dispose of their\r\n      time, 208;\r\n    keeping a diary recommended, 208;\r\n    what it should contain, 209;\r\n    accounts with neighbors, 209;\r\n    the farmer should keep an account of the expenses of his farm, and\r\n      the receipts therefrom, 209;\r\n    importance of keeping an account with the several fields and crops,\r\n      210;\r\n    complication and uncertainty in account-keeping considered, 210-211;\r\n    the advantage of keeping careful accounts, 211.\r\n\r\n  AGRICULTURE. _See_ FARMING: books on practical, referred to, 30.\r\n\r\n  ALABAMA, 50.\r\n\r\n  ALDER, 53.\r\n\r\n  ALKALIS, as fertilizers. _See_ FERTILIZERS, COMMERCIAL.\r\n\r\n  ALLEGHANY RIDGE, 39.\r\n\r\n  ALLEGHANIES, the, 45, 49, 79, 81, 156.\r\n\r\n  ALPS, 75.\r\n\r\n  ALPS, AUSTRIAN, 75.\r\n\r\n  AMERICA, 44, 170.\r\n\r\n  AMHERST.

The reception of that little\r\nannual was such as to justify its reproduction for each succeeding\r\nyear--that of 1842 only excepted--until the issue for 1868 completed a\r\nseries of _thirty_ Annual Registers of Election Returns, with other\r\nuseful political and statistical matter. This annual has been known\r\nsuccessively as The Politician's Register, Whig Almanac, and Tribune\r\nAlmanac, under which last name it has been issued for several years\r\npast. The stereotyped plates of the earlier issues having been consumed\r\nin the fire which destroyed the Tribune Building in 1845, it has for\r\nsome years past been impossible to procure full sets of the work at any\r\nrate, and the imperfect sets from time to time thrown upon the market\r\nhave commanded fabulous prices.\r\n\r\n=HORACE GREELEY.=\r\n\r\nThe complete sets of the Register and Almanac are comprised in two\r\nneatly-bound volumes, and are now ready.

DAILY, SEMI-WEEKLY AND WEEKLY. 1871.\r\n\r\n=THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE.=\r\n\r\n=The Paper of the People.=\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUNE aims to be pre-eminently a _News_-paper. Its\r\ncorrespondents traverse every State, are present on every important\r\nbattle-field, are early advised of every notable Cabinet decision,\r\nobserve the proceedings of Congress, of Legislatures, and of\r\nConventions, and report to us by telegraph all that seems of general\r\ninterest. We have paid for one day's momentous advices from Europe by\r\nCable far more that our entire receipts for the issue in which those\r\nadvises reached our readers. If lavish outlay, unsleeping vigilance, and\r\nunbounded faith in the liberality and discernment of the reading public,\r\nwill enable us to make a journal which has no superior in the accuracy,\r\nvariety, and freshness of its contents, THE TRIBUNE shall be\r\nsuch a journal.\r\n\r\nTo Agriculture and the subservient arts, we have devoted, and shall\r\npersistently devote, more means and space than any of our rivals. We aim\r\nto make THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE such a paper as no farmer can afford\r\nto do without, however widely his politics may differ from ours. Our\r\nreports of the Cattle, Horse, Produce, and General Markets, are so full\r\nand accurate, our essays in elucidation of the farmer's calling and our\r\nregular reports of the Farmers' Club and kindred gatherings, are so\r\ninteresting, that the poorest farmer will find therein a mine of\r\nsuggestion and Counsel, of which he cannot remain ignorant without\r\npositive and serious loss.\r\n\r\n=AS A FAMILY NEWSPAPER=, THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE is pre-eminent. In addition\r\nto Reviews, Notices of New Books, Poetry, &c., we publish Short Stories,\r\noriginal or selected, which will generally be concluded in a single\r\nissue, or at most in two or three. We intend that THE TRIBUNE shall keep\r\nin the advance in all that concerns the Agricultural, Manufacturing,\r\nMining, and other interests of the country; and that, for variety and\r\ncompleteness, it remain altogether the most valuable, interesting and\r\ninstructive NEWSPAPER published in the world.\r\n\r\nNo newspaper so large and complete as THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE was ever before\r\noffered at so low a price.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS OF THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE.\r\n\r\n_To Mail Subscribers._\r\n\r\nOne copy, one year, 52 issues, =$2=.\r\nFive copies                     =9=.\r\n\r\nTo ONE ADDRESS, all at one Post Office.\r\n\r\nTen Copies      =$1.50= each.\r\nTwenty Copies   =1.25=  \"\r\nFifty Copies    =1.00=  \"\r\n\r\nAnd One Extra Copy to each Club.\r\n\r\nTo NAMES OF SUBSCRIBERS, all at one Post Office.\r\n\r\nTen Copies     =$1.60= each.\r\nTwenty Copies  =1.35=  \"\r\nFifty Copies   =1.10=  \"\r\n\r\nAnd One Extra Copy to each Club.\r\n\r\nPersons entitled to an extra copy can, if preferred, have either of the\r\nfollowing books, postage prepaid: Political Economy, by Horace Greeley;\r\nPear Culture for Profit, by P.
