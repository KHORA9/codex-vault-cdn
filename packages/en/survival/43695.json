It has\r\nbeen estimated that from three to five thousand persons die and sixty\r\nto one hundred thousand cases of sickness occur annually in this city,\r\nfrom causes which are engendered during the months of June, July,\r\nAugust, and September. An examination of the records of the Health\r\nDepartment for any year reveals the important fact that certain\r\ndiseases are not only more frequent during the summer quarter than at\r\nany other time, but that they are far more fatal, especially in the\r\nmonths of July and August, than during any other period of the year.\r\nThese are the \"zymotic diseases,\" or those depending upon some form of\r\ngerm life. The following table illustrates the course of mortality\r\nfrom those diseases in one year:\r\n\r\n  Month.       Deaths.\r\n\r\n  January        541\r\n  February       475\r\n  March          476\r\n  April          554\r\n  May            584\r\n  June           798\r\n  July         1,433\r\n  August       1,126\r\n  September      791\r\n  October        522\r\n  November       460\r\n  December       504\r\n\r\nIt appears that during eight months of the year, excluding June, July,\r\nAugust, and September, the average monthly mortality from \"zymotic\r\ndiseases\" was 452. Had the same average continued during the remaining\r\nfour months the total mortality from those diseases for that year\r\nwould have been 4,424; but the actual mortality was 7,764, which\r\nproves that 3,340 persons were sacrificed during those four fatal\r\nmonths to conditions which exist in the city only at that period of\r\nthe year. Still more startling is the estimate of the sickness rate\r\ncaused by the unhealthful conditions created in the summer months in\r\nNew York city. If we estimate that there are twenty cases of sickness\r\nfor every death by a zymotic disease there were 66,800 more cases of\r\nsickness in the year above referred to than there would have been had\r\nthe sickness rate been the same in the summer as in the other months\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest features of this high sickness and death rate\r\nappears when we notice the ages of those who are especially the\r\nvictims of these fatal diseases. During the week ending July 9th last\r\nthere were 399 deaths from diarrhœal diseases, of which number 382\r\nwere children under five years of age. The following table taken from\r\nthe records of the Health Department show in a very striking manner\r\nhow fatal to child life are the conditions peculiar to our summer\r\nseason:\r\n\r\n  ----------+------------------------------------------------\r\n            |        DEATHS FROM DIARRHŒAL DISEASES.\r\n            |-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\r\n    MONTH.  | Under one | Under two | Under five |\r\n            |   year.   |   years.  |   years.   | All ages.\r\n  ----------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\r\n  January   |    50     |    55     |      58    |     82\r\n  February  |    47     |    51     |      58    |     75\r\n  March     |    75     |    80     |      83    |     96\r\n  April     |    82     |    91     |      97    |    108\r\n  May       |   101     |   117     |     121    |    104\r\n  June      |   387     |   430     |     436    |    467\r\n  July      |   809     |   990     |   1,020    |  1,100\r\n  August    |   464     |   565     |     697    |    762\r\n  September |   267     |   394     |     409    |    462\r\n  October   |   114     |   148     |     154    |    190\r\n  November  |    59     |    70     |      72    |     89\r\n  December  |    57     |    62     |      64    |     82\r\n  ----------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\r\n\r\nThese statistics demonstrate the extreme unhealthfulness of New York\r\nduring the summer, and the vast proportion of children who perish from\r\nthe fatal agencies which are then brought into activity. It is a\r\nmatter of great public concern to determine the nature of the\r\nunhygienic conditions on which this excessive mortality depends, and\r\nthus discover the proper remedial measures.\r\n\r\nAs high temperature is the distinguishing feature of the summer\r\nmonths, we very naturally conclude that excessive heat is a most\r\nimportant factor, if not the sole cause, of the diseases so fatal to\r\nhuman life at this period. A close comparison of the temperature and\r\nmortality records of any summer in this city demonstrates the direct\r\nrelation of the former to the latter. For illustration, we will take\r\nthe records of the Health Department during the past summer, selecting\r\ndiarrhœal diseases for comparison, as they prevail and are most fatal\r\nat that season of the year. The table gives the total mortality from\r\nthese diseases and the mortality from those diseases of children under\r\nfive years of age. To the four months, June, July, August, and\r\nSeptember, are added May and October, for the purpose of showing the\r\ngradual increase of the mortality from these diseases as the hot\r\nweather approaches and its decline as the hot weather abates.\r\n\r\n  Key:  TF. = Temperature (Fahrenheit)\r\n\r\n  --------------+------------+--------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                |   Total    |  Diarrhœal   |       |       |\r\n   WEEK ENDING  | diarrhœal  |diseases under| Mean  |Maximum|Minimum\r\n                |  diseases. |  five yrs.   |  TF.  |  TF.  |  TF.\r\n  --------------+------------+--------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  May 7th       |     10     |       8      | 52.4° |  72°  |  47°\r\n  May 14th      |     20     |      17      | 55.5° |  71°  |  40°\r\n  May 21st      |     14     |      12      | 63.3° |  86°  |  52°\r\n  May 28th      |     22     |      19      | 60.9° |  70°  |  56°\r\n  June 4th      |     18     |      16      | 65.8° |  76°  |  54°\r\n  June 11th     |     26     |      20      | 71.6° |  86°  |  58°\r\n  June 18th     |     36     |      32      | 73.0° |  89°  |  59°\r\n  June 25th     |     74     |      69      | 69.3° |  94°  |  54°\r\n  July 2d       |    170     |     164      | 78.6° |  94°  |  67°\r\n  July 9th      |    399     |     382      | 77.4° | 100°  |  61°\r\n  July 16th     |    330     |     321      | 71.1° |  91°  |  57°\r\n  July 23d      |    388     |     356      | 77.4° |  91°  |  67°\r\n  July 30th     |    380     |     353      | 78.5° |  95°  |  70°\r\n  August 6th    |    380     |     353      | 78.8° |  92°  |  67°\r\n  August 13th   |    342     |     306      | 73.9° |  90°  |  65°\r\n  August 20th   |    290     |     261      | 74.8° |  89°  |  64°\r\n  August 27th   |    268     |     246      | 76.6° |  93°  |  63°\r\n  September 3d  |    289     |     256      | 79.0° |  93°  |  59°\r\n  September 10th|    283     |     255      | 74.0° |  92°  |  58°\r\n  September 17th|    179     |     158      | 67.3° |  85°  |  52°\r\n  September 24th|    193     |     167      | 68.7° |  90°  |  52°\r\n  October 1st   |    132     |     117      | 66.5° |  80°  |  54°\r\n  October 8th   |     90     |      78      | 69.6° |  81°  |  53°\r\n  October 15th  |     71     |      58      | 60.1° |  74°  |  49°\r\n  October 22d   |     54     |      42      | 55.9° |  71°  |  44°\r\n  October 29th  |     39     |      32      | 53.9° |  67°  |  41°\r\n  --------------+------------+--------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nAgain, if we compare the temperature and mortality records for a\r\nseries of days instead of months, it will be noticed that the\r\nmortality record follows the fluctuations of the heat record with as\r\nmuch precision as effect follows cause. The summer heat generally\r\nbegins about the 20th of June and continues with varying intensity\r\nuntil the 15th of September. Within that period we can select many\r\nexamples which strikingly illustrate the relations of temperature to\r\nmortality. For example, the first heated term of the year before us\r\nbegan on the 19th of June and lasted until the 26th of that month. The\r\ntwo records are as follows:\r\n\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  DAY. |Temperature.|Mortality.\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  19th |    78°     |    83\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  20th |    80      |   100\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  21st |    82      |   122\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  22d  |    80      |   116\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  23d  |    77      |   104\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  24th |    68      |   119\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n  25th |    65      |    88\r\n  -----+------------+----------\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June a second heated term began, when the temperature\r\nrose to 80°, and continued above that figure until July 5th, a period\r\nof eight days. The following is the record, including the temperature\r\nin the sun:\r\n\r\n  ----------+------------------------------\r\n            |         TEMPERATURE\r\n     DAY.   +-----------+-------+----------\r\n            | In shade. |In sun.|Mortality.\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  June 28th |    80°    | 118°  |   118\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  June 29th |    84     | 120   |   163\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  June 30th |    85     | 124   |   191\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  July 1st  |    88     | 125   |   247\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  July 2d   |    87     | 128   |   351\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  July 3d   |    82     | 120   |   238\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  July 4th  |    84     | 122   |   227\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n  July 5th  |    80     | 121   |   184\r\n  ----------+-----------+-------+----------\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that during the last heated period there was a more\r\nprolonged high temperature than during the first, and that the\r\nmortality of the second was higher for the same temperature than that\r\nof the first. These facts are in accord with the history of our summer\r\nmonths. The range of temperature increases as the season advances, and\r\nthe rate of mortality rises, owing to the diminished resisting power\r\nto the effects of high heat on the part of the people, especially of\r\nthe children, the aged, and those already enfeebled by disease.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully understand the influence of heat and its effects\r\nupon the public health, we must first notice the conditions regulating\r\nthe temperature of the body in health and disease.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of animals in a state of health is not a fixed\r\nquantity, but has a limited range which depends upon internal and\r\nexternal conditions not incompatible with health. In man the range of\r\ntemperature in health is fixed at 97.25° F. to 99.5° F. Any\r\ntemperature above or below these extremes, unless explained by special\r\ncircumstances not affecting the normal condition of the person, is an\r\nindication of disease. This comparatively fixed temperature in health\r\nis a remarkable feature of the living animal. When subjected to a\r\ntemperature above or below the extremes here given it will still\r\nmaintain its equilibrium. This fixed temperature under varying\r\nconditions of heat and cold is due to a \"heat-regulating power,\"\r\ninherent in the constitution of every animal, by which it imparts heat\r\nwhen the temperature of the air is high and conserves heat when the\r\nlatter is low. The heat escapes from the body--1, by radiation from\r\nthe surface; 2, by transmission to other bodies; 3, by evaporation;\r\nand 4, by the conversion of heat into motion. The surface of the body\r\nfurnishes the principal medium for the loss of heat by the first three\r\nmethods--viz., radiation, transmission, and evaporation. It is\r\nestimated that 93.07 per cent of the heat produced escapes by the\r\nprocesses of radiation, evaporation, conduction, and mechanical work.\r\nThe remaining heat units are lost by warming inspired air and the\r\nfoods and drinks taken. There are apparently other subtile influences,\r\nso-called \"regulators of heat,\" at work to preserve an equilibrium of\r\ntemperature in the animal body, but they are not well known. The\r\nresult of the operation of these forces is this--viz., if, by any\r\nmeans, the heat of the body is increased, compensative losses of heat\r\nquickly occur, and the normal temperature is soon restored; and if, on\r\nthe contrary, the loss of heat is unusually increased, the\r\ncompensative production of heat of the body at once follows, and the\r\nequilibrium is at once restored. The important fact to remember is\r\nthis--viz., the production and loss of heat in the human organism when\r\nin health and not subjected to too violent disturbing causes are so\r\nnicely balanced that the temperature is always maintained at an\r\naverage of 98.6° F., the extremes being 97.25° F. and 99.5° F. \"So\r\nbeautifully is this balance preserved,\" Parkes remarks, \"that the\r\nstability of the animal temperature in all countries has always been a\r\nsubject of marvel.\" If, however, anything prevents the operation of\r\nthe processes of cooling--viz., radiation, evaporation, and\r\nconduction--the bodily temperature rises by the accumulation of heat,\r\nand death is the result from combustion. In experiments in ovens a man\r\nhas been able to bear a temperature of 260° F. for a short period,\r\nprovided the air was dry so that evaporation could be carried on\r\nrapidly. But if the air is very moist, and perspiration is impeded,\r\nthe temperature of the body rises rapidly, and the person soon\r\nsuccumbs to the excessive heat. Another important fact is this, viz.,\r\nthe normal temperature of the young and of the very old is higher\r\nthan the middle-aged. The infant at birth has a temperature of 99° F.\r\nto 100° F., and it maintains a temperature of 99° F. and upward for\r\nseveral days. The variations of temperature from other causes are much\r\ngreater in children than in adults, as also the normal daily\r\nvariations of temperature. About the sixtieth year the average\r\ntemperature of man begins to rise, and approximates that of the\r\ninfant. In the young and old the \"heat-regulating power\" is more\r\nreadily exhausted, and hence continued high temperature is far more\r\nfatal to these classes.\r\n\r\nThe first noticeable fact in regard to bodily temperature in disease\r\nis that there are daily fluctuations as in health, but much more\r\nextreme. In general, the remission of temperature in disease occurs in\r\nthe morning, and the exacerbation in the afternoon and evening; the\r\nminimum is reached between six and nine o'clock in the morning, and\r\nthe maximum between three and six o'clock in the evening. In many\r\ndiseases the minimum temperature is not below 100° F., and usually it\r\nis one or two degrees above that point, while the maximum has no\r\ndefinite limit and may reach the dangerous height of 107° F. It should\r\nbe noticed that the highest daily temperature in disease, as in\r\nhealth, occurs in the afternoon, when the temperature of the air in\r\nsummer is the greatest.\r\n\r\nThe conditions affecting the temperature of the body other than those\r\ndue to physiological conditions are very numerous. First and most\r\nobvious is the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. It is a\r\nwell-established fact that an average temperature of the air of 54° F.\r\nis best adapted to the public health, for at that temperature the\r\ndecomposition of animal and vegetable matter is slight, and normal\r\ntemperature is most easily maintained. Every degree of temperature\r\nabove or below that point requires a more or less effort of the\r\nheat-regulating power to maintain the proper equilibrium. Even more\r\npotent in elevating the bodily temperature is the introduction into\r\nthe blood, whether by respiration or by direct injection, of putrid\r\nfluids and the gases of decomposing matters. If this injection is\r\nrepeated at short intervals, death will occur with a high temperature.\r\nThe air of cities contains emanations, in hot weather, from a vast\r\nnumber of sources of animal and vegetable decomposition, and the\r\ninhalation of air so vitiated brings in contact with the blood these\r\ndeleterious products in a highly divided state which cause a fatal\r\nelevation of temperature in the young, old, and enfeebled. The same\r\neffect is produced by the air in close and heated places, as in\r\ntenement houses, workshops, schoolhouses, hospital wards, and other\r\nrooms where many persons congregate for hours. Air thus charged with\r\npoisonous gases becomes more dangerous if the temperature of the\r\nplace is raised, as happens almost daily in the summer months in\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding facts we may conclude that, as long as the body\r\ncontinues in health, the \"heat-regulating power,\" which constantly\r\ntends to preserve an equilibrium of temperature, is capable of\r\nresisting the ordinary agencies that, operating externally or\r\ninternally, exaggerate the heat-producing conditions, and thus destroy\r\nthe individual. But if the person is suffering from a disease which\r\nweakens the \"heat-regulating power\" these deleterious agencies, which\r\nthe healthy person may resist, will readily overpower the already\r\nquite exhausted heat-regulating forces, and he perishes by combustion.\r\nIt is very evident that in an organism having complicated functions,\r\nlike that of man, and subject to such a multitude of adverse\r\ninfluences, the balance between health and disease must be very nicely\r\nadjusted. Too great an elevation or too great a depression of\r\ntemperature may destroy the \"heat-regulating power,\" and disease or\r\ndeath will be the consequence. Or this \"heat-regulating power\" may be\r\nweakened or destroyed by causes generated within the body, or received\r\nfrom without, and the heat-producing agencies are then under\r\ninfluences which may prove to be powerfully destructive forces.\r\n\r\nIt will not now be difficult to understand in what manner high\r\ntemperature affects the public health of large cities. Evidently in\r\nthe _direct_ action of heat upon the human body we have the most\r\npowerful agency in the production of our great summer mortality. While\r\nsunstroke represents the maximum direct effect of solar heat upon the\r\nhuman subject, the large increase of deaths from wasting chronic\r\ndiseases and diarrhœal affections, of children under one year of age\r\nand persons upward of seventy years of age, shows the terrible effects\r\nof the prevailing intense heat of summer upon all who are debilitated\r\nby disease or age and thereby have their \"heat-regulating power\"\r\ndiminished. The fact has been established by repeated experiment that\r\nwhen solar or artificial heat is continually applied to the animal the\r\ntemperature of its body will gradually rise until all of the\r\ncompensating or heat-regulating agencies fail to preserve the\r\nequilibrium, and the temperature reaches a point at which death takes\r\nplace from actual combustion. In general, a temperature of 107° F. in\r\nman would be regarded as indicating an unfavorable termination of any\r\ndisease. In persons suffering from sunstroke the temperature often\r\nranges from 106° F. to 110° F., the higher temperature appearing just\r\nbefore a fatal termination.\r\n\r\nThe _indirect_ effects of heat appear in the production of poisonous\r\ngases which vitiate the air and render it more or less prejudicial to\r\nhealth. Decomposition of all forms of refuse animal and vegetable\r\nmatter proceeds with far greater rapidity during the summer quarter\r\nthan during other months of the year. Among the early results of\r\nsummer heat is the damage to food. Milk retailed through the city, the\r\nsole or chief diet of thousands of hand-fed infants, undergoes such\r\nchanges as to render it not only less nutritious but also hurtful to\r\nthe digestive organs. The vegetables and fruits in the markets rapidly\r\ndeteriorate and become unfit for food. Meats and fish quickly take on\r\nputrefactive changes which render them more or less indigestible. The\r\neffect of this increase of temperature upon the refuse and filth of\r\nthe streets, courts, and alleys, upon the air in close places, in the\r\ntenement houses, and upon the tenants themselves is soon perceptible.\r\nThe foul gases of decomposition fill the atmosphere of the city and\r\nrender the air of close and unventilated places stifling; while\r\nlanguor, depression, and debility fall upon the population like a\r\nwidespread epidemic. The physician now recognizes the fact that a new\r\nelement has entered into the medical constitution of the season. The\r\nsickly young, the enfeebled old, those exhausted from wasting\r\ndiseases, whose native energies were just sufficient to maintain their\r\ntenure of life, are the first to succumb to this pressure upon their\r\nvital resources. Diarrhœal diseases of every form next appear and\r\nassume a fatal intensity, and finally the occurrence of sunstroke (or\r\nheat-stroke) determines the maximum effects of heat upon the public\r\nhealth. The sickness records of dispensaries and the mortality records\r\nof the Health Department show that a new and most destructive force is\r\nnow operating, not only in the diseases above mentioned, but in nearly\r\nall of the diseases of the period. Fevers, inflammatory diseases, and\r\nothers of a similar nature run a more rapid course, and are far less\r\namenable to treatment. This is due, in the opinion of eminent medical\r\nauthority, to the addition of the heat of the air to the heat of the\r\nbody. Indeed, the only safety is in flight from the city to the\r\ncountry and to cool localities, as the seashore or the mountains. The\r\nimmediate improvement of those suffering from affections of the city\r\nwhen transferred to the country is often marvelous, and shows\r\nconclusively how fatal is the element of heat in its direct and\r\nindirect effects upon the residents of the city.\r\n\r\nLet us next consider the causes of high temperature in the city of New\r\nYork. It is a well-established fact that the temperature of large and\r\ndensely populated towns is far higher than the surrounding country.\r\nThis is due to a variety of causes, the chief of which are the absence\r\nof vegetation; the drainage and hence the dryness of the soil; the\r\ncovering of the earth with stone, bricks, and mortar; the aggregation\r\nof population to surface area; the massing together of buildings; and\r\nthe artificial heat of workshops and manufactories. The difference\r\nbetween the mean temperature of the city at Cooper Institute and at\r\nthe Arsenal, Central Park, for a single month, illustrates this fact.\r\nAnother striking difference between the temperature of these two\r\npoints of observation is that the range is much greater at Central\r\nPark than at Cooper Institute, the temperature falling at night more\r\nat the former than at the latter place. The effect of vegetation is to\r\nlower the temperature at night, while brick and stone retain the heat\r\nand prevent any considerable fall of temperature during the\r\ntwenty-four hours. It may be said of New York that it has all the\r\nconditions of increased temperature above given in an intensified\r\nform. It has a southern exposure; all of its broad avenues run north\r\nand south; the surface is covered with stone, brick, and asphalt; it\r\nis destitute of vegetation except in its parks, which have a very\r\nlimited area compared with the needs of the city; its buildings are\r\nirregularly arranged and crowded together so as to give the largest\r\namount of elevation with the least superficial area; ventilation of\r\ncourts, areas, and living rooms is sacrificed; its ill-constructed and\r\novercrowded tenement houses, especially of certain districts, have the\r\nlargest population to surface area of any city in the civilized world.\r\nTo these natural and structural unfavorable sanitary conditions must\r\nbe added the enormous production of artificial heat in dwellings. When\r\nthe summer temperature begins to rise the solar heat is constantly\r\nadded to the artificial heat already existing. The temperature of the\r\nwhole vast mass of stones, bricks, mortar, and asphalt gradually\r\nincreases, with no other mitigation or modification than that caused\r\nby the inconstant winds and occasional rainstorms. And the evils of\r\nhigh temperature are yearly increasing as the area of brick, stone,\r\nand asphalt extends. The records of sunstroke during the past few\r\nyears is appalling, both on account of the number of cases and their\r\ncomparative increase. If no adequate remedy is discovered and applied,\r\nthe day would not seem to be distant when the resident, especially if\r\nhe is a laborer, will remain in the city and pursue his work during\r\nthe summer at the constant risk of his life.\r\n\r\nTurning now to consider the question of the measures which are best\r\nadapted to protect the present and future population of New York from\r\nthe effects of high summer temperatures, we are met by many\r\nsuggestions of more or less value. The more important methods proposed\r\nare: a large supply of public baths; the daily flushing of the streets\r\nwith an immense volume of river water; recreation piers; excursions to\r\nthe seashore; temporary residence in the country, etc. But these are\r\nfor the most part temporary expedients, applicable to individuals, and\r\nare but accessory to some more radical measure which aims to so change\r\nthe atmospheric conditions that excessive heat can not occur. The\r\nreal problem to be solved may be thus stated: How can the temperature\r\nof the city of New York be so modified during the summer months as to\r\nprevent that extreme degree of heat on which the enormous sickness and\r\ndeath rate of the people depend? Discussing the subject broadly from\r\nthis standpoint, it becomes at once evident that we must employ those\r\nagencies which in the wide field of Nature are designed to mitigate\r\nheat and purify the air and thus create permanent climatic conditions\r\nfavorable for the habitation of man.\r\n\r\nIt requires but little knowledge of the physical forces which modify\r\nthe climate of large areas of the earth's surface to recognize the\r\nfact that vegetation plays a most important part. And of the different\r\nforms of vegetation, trees, as compared with shrubs, plants, vines,\r\nand grasses, are undoubtedly the most efficient. This is due to the\r\nvast area of surface which their leaves present to the air on a very\r\nlimited ground space. The sanitary value of trees has hitherto been\r\npractically unrecognized by man. With the most ruthless hand he has\r\neverywhere and at all times sacrificed this most important factor in\r\nthe conservation of a healthful and temperate climate. He has found,\r\ntoo late, however, that by this waste of the forests he has by no\r\nmeans improved his own condition. The winters have become colder, the\r\nsummers hotter; the living springs have ceased to flow perpetually;\r\nthe fertilizing streams have disappeared; the earth is deeply frozen\r\nin winter and parched in summer; and, finally, new and grave diseases\r\nhave appeared where formerly they were unknown.\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that the temperature in a forest, a grove, or\r\neven a clump of trees, is cooler in summer and warmer in winter than\r\nthe surrounding country. Man and animals alike seek the shade of\r\ngroves and trees during the heat of the day, and are greatly refreshed\r\nand revived by the cool atmosphere. The difference between the\r\ntemperature of the air under and among the branches of a single tree,\r\ndensely leaved, and the surrounding air, on a hot day, is instantly\r\nrealized by the laborer or traveler who seeks the shade. The\r\nthermometer in the sun and shade shows a difference of twenty, thirty,\r\nand forty degrees, and in the soil a difference of ten to eleven\r\ndegrees. The reverse is true in winter. The laborer and traveler\r\nexposed to the cold of the open country find in the forest a degree of\r\nwarmth quite as great as in a building but imperfectly inclosed.\r\nRailroad engineers inform us that they have occasion to use far less\r\nfuel in passing through forests in winter than in traversing the same\r\ndistance in the open country. When the ground in the fields is frozen\r\ntwo or three feet deep, its temperature in the forest is found above\r\nthe freezing point.\r\n\r\nForests and even single trees have, therefore, a marked influence upon\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere, especially during the summer, and they\r\nevidently tend to equalize temperature, preventing extremes both in\r\nsummer and winter. Hence they become of immense value as sanitary\r\nagencies in preserving equality of climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by some vegetable physiologists that trees exert this\r\npower through their own inherent warmth, which always remains at a\r\nfixed standard both in summer and winter. \"Observation shows,\" says\r\nMeguscher,[2] \"that the wood of a living tree maintains a temperature\r\nof from 54° to 56° F., when the temperature stands from 37° to 47° F.\r\nabove zero, and that the internal warmth does not rise and fall in\r\nproportion to that of the atmosphere. So long as the latter is below\r\n67° F., that of the tree is always highest; but, if the temperature of\r\nthe air rises to 67° F., that of the vegetable growth is the lowest.\"\r\nSince, then, trees maintain at all seasons a constant mean temperature\r\nof 54° F., it is easy to see why the air in contact with the forest\r\nmust be warmer in winter and cooler in summer than in situations where\r\nit is deprived of that influence.[3]\r\n\r\nAgain, the shade of trees protects the earth from the direct rays of\r\nthe sun, and prevents solar irradiation from the earth. This effect is\r\nof immense importance in cities where the paved streets become\r\nexcessively heated, and radiation creates one of the most dangerous\r\nsources of heat. Whoever has walked in the streets of New York, on a\r\nhot summer's day, protected from the direct rays of a midday sun by\r\nhis umbrella, has found the reflected heat of the pavement\r\nintolerable. If for a moment he passed into the dense shade of a tree,\r\nhe at once experienced a marked sense of relief. This relief is not\r\ndue so much to the shade as to the cooling effect of the vaporization\r\nfrom the leaves of the tree.\r\n\r\nTrees also have a cutaneous transpiration by their leaves. And\r\nalthough they absorb largely the vapor of the surrounding air, and\r\nalso the water of the soil, they nevertheless exhale constantly large\r\nvolumes into the air. This vaporization of liquids is a frigorific or\r\ncooling process, and when most rapid the frigorific effect reaches its\r\nmaximum. The amount of fluid exhaled by vegetation has been, at\r\nvarious times, estimated with more or less accuracy. Hales[4] states\r\nthat a sunflower, with a surface of 5.616 square inches, throws off at\r\nthe rate of twenty to twenty-four ounces avoirdupois every twelve\r\nhours; a vine, with twelve square feet of foliage, exhales at the rate\r\nof five or six ounces daily. Bishop Watson, in his experiments on\r\ngrasses, estimated that an acre of grass emits into the atmosphere\r\n6.400 quarts of water in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that vegetation tends powerfully to cool the\r\natmosphere during a summer day, and this effect increases in\r\nproportion to the increase of the temperature. The influence of trees\r\nheavily leaved, in a district where there is no other vegetation, in\r\nmoderating and equalizing the temperature, can not be overestimated.\r\nThe amount of superficial surface exposed by the foliage of a single\r\ntree is immense. For example, \"the Washington elm, of Cambridge,\r\nMass., a tree of moderate size, was estimated several years since to\r\nproduce a crop of seven million leaves, exposing a surface of two\r\nhundred thousand square feet, or about five acres of foliage.\"\r\n\r\nTrees regulate the humidity of the air by the process of absorption\r\nand transpiration. They absorb the moisture contained in the air, and\r\nagain return to the air, in the form of vapor, the water which they\r\nhave absorbed from the earth and the air. The flow of sap in trees for\r\nthe most part ceases at night, the stimulus of light and heat being\r\nnecessary to the function of absorption and evaporation. During the\r\nheated portions of the day, therefore, when there is the most need of\r\nagencies to equalize both temperature and humidity, trees perform\r\ntheir peculiar functions most actively. Moisture is rapidly absorbed\r\nfrom the air by the leaves, and from the earth by the roots, and is\r\nagain all returned to the air and earth by transpiration or exudation.\r\nThe effect of this process upon temperature and humidity is thus\r\nstated by Marsh: \"The evaporation of the juices of the plant by\r\nwhatever process effected, takes up atmospheric heat and produces\r\nrefrigeration. This effect is not less real, though much less sensible\r\nin the forest than in meadow and pasture land, and it can not be\r\ndoubted that the local temperature is considerably affected by it. But\r\nthe evaporation that cools the air diffuses through it, at the same\r\ntime, a medium which powerfully resists the escape of heat from the\r\nearth by radiation. Visible vapor or clouds, it is well known, prevent\r\nfrosts by obstructing radiation, or rather by reflecting back again\r\nthe heat radiated by the earth, just as any mechanical screen would\r\ndo. On the other hand, clouds intercept the rays of the sun also, and\r\nhinder its heat from reaching the earth.\" Again, he says, upon the\r\nwhole, their general effect \"seems to be to mitigate extremes of\r\natmospheric heat and cold, moisture and drought. They serve as\r\nequalizers of temperature and humidity.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, let us notice the effects of trees upon malarial emanations.\r\nThe power of trees, when in leaf, to render harmless the poisonous\r\nemanations from the earth has long been an established fact. Man may\r\nlive in close proximity to marshes from which arise the most\r\ndangerous malaria with the utmost impunity, provided a grove intervene\r\nbetween his home and the marsh. This function of trees was known to\r\nthe Romans, who enacted laws requiring the planting of trees in places\r\nmade uninhabitable by the diffusion of malaria, and placed groves\r\nserving such purposes under the protection of some divinity to insure\r\ntheir protection. It is a rule of the British army in India to select\r\nan encampment having a grove between the camp and any low, wet soil.\r\n\r\nFinally, trees purify the atmosphere. The process of vegetable\r\nnutrition consists in the appropriation by the plant or tree of\r\ncarbon. This element it receives from the air in the form principally\r\nof carbonic acid, and in the process of digestion the oxygen is\r\nliberated and again restored to the air, while the carbon becomes\r\nfixed as an element of the woody fiber. Man and animals, on the\r\ncontrary, require oxygen for their nutrition, and the supply is in the\r\nair they breathe. Carbon is a waste product of the animal system, and,\r\nuniting with the oxygen, is expired as carbonic acid, a powerful\r\nanimal poison. A slight increase of the normal quantity of carbonic\r\nacid in the air renders it poisonous to man, and continued respiration\r\nof such air, or a considerable increase of the carbonic acid, will\r\nprove fatal. The animal and vegetable world, therefore, complement\r\neach other, and the one furnishes the conditions and forces by which\r\nthe other maintains life and health. \"Plants,\" says Schacht, \"imbibe\r\nfrom the air carbonic acid and other gaseous or volatile products\r\nexhaled by animals, developed by the natural phenomena of\r\ndecomposition. On the other hand, the vegetable pours into the\r\natmosphere oxygen, which is taken up by animals and appropriated by\r\nthem. The tree, by means of its leaves and its young herbaceous twigs,\r\npresents a considerable surface for absorption and evaporation; it\r\nabstracts the carbon of carbonic acid, and solidifies it in wood\r\nfecula, and a multitude of other compounds. The result is that a\r\nforest withdraws from the air, by its great absorbent surface, much\r\nmore gas than meadows or cultivated fields, and exhales proportionally\r\na considerably greater quantity of oxygen. The influence of the\r\nforests on the chemical composition of the atmosphere is, in a word,\r\nof the highest importance.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIn large cities, where animal and vegetable decomposition goes on\r\nrapidly during the summer, the atmosphere is, as already stated, at\r\ntimes saturated with deleterious gases. At the period of the day when\r\nmalaria and mephitic gases are emitted in the greatest quantity and\r\nactivity, this function of absorption by vegetation is most active and\r\npowerful. Carbonic acid, ammoniacal compounds, and other gases,\r\nproducts of putrefaction, so actively poisonous to man, are absorbed,\r\nand in the process of vegetable digestion the deleterious portion is\r\nseparated and appropriated by the plant, while oxygen, the element\r\nessential to animal life, is returned to the air. Trees, therefore, in\r\ncities, are of immense value, owing to their power to destroy or\r\nneutralize malaria, and to absorb the poisonous elements of gaseous\r\ncompounds, while they render the air more respirable by emitting\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion from the foregoing facts is inevitable that one of the\r\ngreat and pressing sanitary wants of New York city is an ample supply\r\nof trees. It is, in effect, destitute of trees; for the unsightly\r\nshrubs which are planted by citizens are, in no proper sense, adequate\r\nto the purpose which we contemplate. Its long avenues, running north\r\nand south, without a shade tree, and exposed to the full effect of the\r\nsun, are all but impassable at noonday in the summer months. The\r\npedestrian who ventures out at such an hour finds no protection from\r\nan umbrella, on account of the radiation of the intense heat from the\r\npaved surface. Animals and man alike suffer from exposure in the\r\nglowing heat. Nothing mitigates its intensity but the winds or an\r\noccasional rainstorm. And when evening comes on, the cooling of the\r\natmosphere produced by vegetation does not occur, and unless partially\r\nrelieved by favoring winds or a shower the heat continues, but little\r\nabated, and the atmosphere remains charged with noxious and\r\nirrespirable gases. It is evident that shade trees, of proper kinds,\r\nand suitably arranged, supply the conditions necessary to counteract\r\nthe evils of excessive heat. They protect the paved streets and the\r\nbuildings largely from the direct rays of the sun; they cool the lower\r\nstratum of air by evaporation from their immense surfaces of leaves;\r\nthey absorb at once the malarious emanations and gases of\r\ndecomposition, and abstract their poisonous properties for their own\r\nconsumption; they withdraw from the air the carbonic acid thrown off\r\nfrom the animal system as a poison, and decomposing it, appropriate\r\nthe element dangerous to man, and give back to the atmosphere the\r\nelement essential to his health and even life.[6]\r\n\r\nAnd we may add that cultivated shade trees in New York would be an\r\nartistic and attractive feature of the streets. Every citizen enjoys\r\ntrees, as is evident from the efforts made to cultivate them\r\nthroughout the city.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently alleged that trees can not be successfully cultivated\r\nin cities on account of the gases in the soil. There are ample proofs\r\nto the contrary. The city of Paris strikingly illustrates the\r\npossibility of cultivating a large variety of trees in the streets and\r\npublic places of large cities when the planting and cultivation is\r\nplaced under competent authority. In our own country the cities of New\r\nHaven and Washington are examples of the successful cultivation of\r\ntrees to an extent sufficient to greatly modify the summer\r\ntemperature. Authorities on landscape gardening and forestry sustain\r\nthe view that under proper supervision by competent and skilled\r\npersons a great variety of trees, shrubs, plants, and vines can be\r\ncultivated in the streets and public places of this city. Mr.\r\nFrederick Law Olmstead, to whom the city is so much indebted for his\r\nintelligent supervision of Central Park in its early period, warmly\r\nsupported a movement to cultivate trees, shrubs, plants, and vines in\r\nthe streets of New York. Dr. J.T. Rothrock, the very able and\r\nexperienced Commissioner of Forestry of Pennsylvania, under date of\r\nOctober 10, 1898, speaking of the proposed plan of securing the\r\ncultivating trees in the streets of this city, remarks: \"I think it an\r\nexcellent measure, and I am sure that during the torrid season the\r\nmore tree shade you have the fewer will be your cases of heat\r\nexhaustion. It is idle to say, as is often said in this country, that\r\ntrees can not be made to grow in our cities. Under existing conditions\r\nthe wonder is, not that trees look unhealthy in most cities, but that\r\nany of them manage to live at all. It is perfectly well known that the\r\ncity of Paris has thousands of trees growing vigorously under such\r\nsurroundings as the American gardener would think impossible. Two\r\nthings are necessary to success--viz., first, the kinds of trees to\r\nendure city life must be found; and, second, select from among them\r\nsuch as are adapted by their size and shape to each special place.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gifford Pinchot, of the Division of Forestry, Department of\r\nAgriculture, Washington, writes under date of December 2, 1898:\r\n\"Street trees are successfully planted in great numbers in all of the\r\nmost beautiful cities of the world. Washington and Paris are\r\nconspicuous examples. That such trees succeed is largely due to the\r\ngreat care taken in setting them out. The attractiveness of cities has\r\ncome to be reckoned among their business advantages, and nothing adds\r\nto it more than well-selected, well-planted, and well-cared-for trees.\r\nOn the score of public health trees in the streets of cities are\r\nequally desirable. They become objectionable only when badly selected\r\nand badly maintained.\"\r\n\r\nIn a recent paper on Tree Planting in the Streets of Washington, Mr.\r\nW.P. Richards, surveyor of the District of Columbia, remarks that,\r\nunder the plan adopted, \"tree planting has never been at an\r\nexperimental stage\" in that city. \"Washington was a city of young\r\ntrees during the seventies, and in the spring of 1875 more than six\r\nthousand trees were planted, consisting of silver maples, Norway\r\nmaples, American elms, American and European lindens, sugar maples,\r\ntulip trees, American white ash, scarlet maples, various poplars, and\r\nash-leaved maples.... A careful count was made of the trees in 1887,\r\nand by comparing this with the number of trees since planted and those\r\nremoved, there is found to be more than seventy-eight thousand trees,\r\nwhich if placed thirty feet apart would line both sides of a boulevard\r\nbetween Washington and New York. These consist of more than thirty\r\nvarieties.\" Mr. Richards adds: \"The planting and care of trees in\r\nWashington grows from year to year, and the future will probably\r\ndemand more skill and judgment than in years past. About twenty\r\nthousand dollars is spent annually, most of it in the care of old\r\ntrees. From one to three thousand young trees are planted during the\r\nspring and fall of each year. The nursery has several thousand of the\r\nbest varieties ready for planting.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinions of these authorities and the success of the work in\r\nWashington, now extending over a quarter of a century, determine\r\nbeyond all question the feasibility and practicability of successfully\r\ncultivating trees in the streets of cities. And if any one doubts the\r\npower of trees cultivated in the streets to change the temperature of\r\na city let him calculate the amount of foliage which the seventy-eight\r\nthousand trees, when full-grown, will furnish the city of Washington,\r\ntaking as his basis the fact that a single tree, the Washington elm,\r\nat Cambridge, Massachusetts, when in full leafage, equals five acres\r\nof foliage, and that one acre of grass emits into the atmosphere 6.400\r\nquarts of water in twenty-four hours, a powerfully cooling process.\r\n\r\nWe have, finally, to consider through what agency the proposed\r\ncultivation of trees in the city of New York can be accomplished most\r\nrapidly and successfully. Three methods may be suggested, viz.: 1.\r\nEncourage citizens each to plant and cultivate trees on his own\r\npremises. 2. Organize voluntary \"tree-planting associations,\" which\r\nshall aid citizens or undertake to do the work at a minimum cost. 3.\r\nPlace the work under the entire supervision and jurisdiction of public\r\nauthority. The first method has been on trial from the foundation of\r\nthe city, and its results are a few stunted apologies for trees which\r\nare useless for sanitary purposes and unsightly for ornamentation. The\r\naverage citizen is entirely incompetent either to select the proper\r\ntree or to cultivate it when planted. Tree-planting associations have\r\nproved useful agencies in exciting a popular interest in the subject,\r\nand in aiding citizens in the selection of suitable trees and in\r\ncultivating them. The Tree-Planting and Fountain Society of Brooklyn,\r\nunder the very able management of its accomplished secretary, Prof.\r\nLewis Collins, is a model organization of the kind, and has\r\naccomplished a vast amount of good in this field in that city. But it\r\nmay well be questioned if we have not reached a period of sanitary\r\nreform in cities when a work of the kind we contemplate in New York\r\nshould not be undertaken by the strong arm of the city government, as\r\na matter of public policy, and carried steadily forward to its\r\ncompletion. The growth of the greater city is far too rapid in every\r\ndirection to await the slow movements of the people under the pressure\r\nof voluntary organizations. The best work can be done in those\r\noutlying districts where the streets are as yet but sparsely built\r\nupon, and the soil has been undisturbed. Again, it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that a work of this kind, which will largely prove one of\r\ncity ornamentation, should be under the exclusive direction of a\r\nskilled central authority having ample power and means to harmonize\r\nevery feature of the work from the center of the city to its remotest\r\nlimits. Finally, the successful cultivation of trees and other\r\nvegetation in our streets can be successfully carried on only by\r\nexperts in the art of tree culture, who devote their entire time and\r\nenergies to these duties, and are sustained by the power of the city\r\ngovernment. Mr. Frederick Law Olmstead remarks, \"Not one in a hundred\r\nof all that may have been planted in the streets of our American\r\ncities in the last fifty years has had such treatment that its species\r\nwould come to be if properly planted and cared for.\" Mr. Richards, in\r\nthe paper referred to on Tree Planting in the Streets of Washington,\r\nmakes the following statement: \"The selection, planting, and care of\r\nall trees in the streets of Washington are under the direction of the\r\nDistrict authorities; individual preferences and private enterprises\r\nare not allowed to regulate this improvement, as is generally done in\r\nother cities. Moreover, the city has its own nursery, where seeds\r\nplanted from its own trees grow and supply all the needed varieties.\"\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that to accomplish such a work as we propose the\r\nundertaking must be placed under the jurisdiction of a department of\r\nthe city government, skilled in the performance of such duties, fully\r\nequipped with all needful appliances, and clothed with ample power and\r\nsupplied with the financial resources necessary to overcome every\r\nobstacle. Fortunately, we have in our Department of Parks an organized\r\nbranch of the city administration endowed with every qualification for\r\nthe performance of these duties. The charter provides as follows: \"It\r\nshall be the duty of each commissioner ... to maintain the beauty and\r\nutility of all such parks, squares, and public places as are situated\r\nwithin his jurisdiction, and to institute and execute all measures for\r\nthe improvement thereof for ornamental purposes and for the beneficial\r\nuses of the people of the city, ... and he shall have power to plant\r\ntrees and to construct, erect, and establish seats, drinking\r\nfountains, statues, and works of art, when he may deem it tasteful or\r\nappropriate so to do.\" At the head of this service is \"a landscape\r\narchitect, skilled and expert, whose assent shall be requisite to all\r\nplans and works or changes thereof respecting the conformation,\r\ndevelopment, or ornamentation of any of the parks, squares, or public\r\nplaces of the city, to the end that the same may be uniform and\r\nsymmetrical at all times.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion seems inevitable that public policy requires that, in\r\nthe interests of the health of the people and the comfort and\r\nwell-being of that large class of the poor who can not escape the\r\nsummer heat by leaving the city, the jurisdiction of the Park\r\nDepartment should be extended to all trees, shrubs, plants, and vines\r\nnow and hereafter planted and growing in the streets of New York, and\r\nthat said department should be required to plant such additional\r\ntrees, shrubs, etc., as it may from time to time deem necessary and\r\nexpedient for the purpose of carrying out the intent and purpose of\r\nsuch act which should be declared to be to improve the public health,\r\nto render the city comfortable to its summer residents, and for\r\nornamentation.\r\n\r\n      \"He who plants a tree, he plants love;\r\n      Tents of coolness, spreading out above\r\n      Wayfarers, he may not live to see.\r\n          Gifts that grow are best,\r\n          Hands that bless are blest.\r\n          Plant. Life does the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In 1872, while a Commissioner of Health, I had occasion to examine\r\nand report on the causes of the high death rate during the summer\r\nmonths in the city of New York. The chief cause was determined to be\r\nthe excessive heat which characterizes those months. It was\r\nrecommended in the report to the Board of Health that legislation be\r\nsecured empowering and requiring the Department of Parks to plant and\r\ncultivate trees, shrubs, plants, and vines in all the streets,\r\navenues, and public places in the city. A bill was drafted and\r\nintroduced into the Legislature, but it did not become a law, and no\r\nfurther effort has been made to secure such legislation. Meantime, two\r\ntree-planting societies have been established, one in the Borough of\r\nBrooklyn and the other in the Borough of Manhattan, which are\r\nendeavoring to awaken public interest to the importance of planting a\r\nsuitable number and variety of trees in the streets for purposes of\r\nornamentation. The aim of this paper, which is largely based on the\r\nreport of 1872, is to revive the project of giving the Department of\r\nParks jurisdiction over the trees in the streets, and require it to\r\nplant and cultivate additional trees, shrubs, plants, and other forms\r\nof vegetation for the improvement of the public health and for the\r\npurpose of ornamentation.\r\n\r\n[2] Man and Nature.

WILLIAM KEITH BROOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf books like this by Professor Mivart, who holds that \"the groundwork\r\nof science must be sought in the human mind,\" help to teach that the\r\ngreatest service of science to mankind is not \"practical,\" but\r\nintellectual, they are worthy the consideration of the thoughtful,\r\neven if this consideration should lead some of the thoughtful to\r\ndistrust Mivart's groundwork, or to doubt whether it is firm enough\r\nfor any superstructure.\r\n\r\nMany, no doubt, think the desire to know a sufficient groundwork for\r\nscience, believing that they wish to know in order that they may\r\nrightly order their lives; but the school to which Mivart belongs\r\ntells them all this is mere vulgar ignorance, since the groundwork of\r\nscience is, and must be, something known, rather than a humble wish to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mivart, the groundwork of science consists of truths\r\nwhich can not be obtained by reasoning, and can not depend for their\r\ncertainty on any experiments or observations alone, since whatever\r\ntruths depend upon reasoning can not be ultimate, but must be\r\nposterior to, and depend upon, the principles, observations, or\r\nexperiments which show that it is indeed true, and upon which its\r\nacceptance thus depends. The groundwork of science must therefore be\r\ncomposed, he says, of truths which are self-evident; and he assures us\r\nthat, if this were not the case, natural knowledge would be mere\r\n\"mental paralysis and self-stultification.\"\r\n\r\nHe would tell the wayfarer who, having been lost among the mountains,\r\ncomes at last upon a broad highway winding around the foothills and\r\nstretching down over the plain to the horizon, that an attempt to go\r\nanywhere upon this road is \"mere paralysis,\" unless he knows where it\r\nbegins and where it ends. He would have told the ancient dwellers upon\r\nthe shores of the Nile that their belief that they owed to the river\r\ntheir agriculture, their commerce, their art and science, and all\r\ntheir civilization, was mere self-stultification, because they knew\r\nnothing of its sources in the central table-land.\r\n\r\nMay not one believe, with Mivart, that the scientific knowledge which\r\narises in the mind by means of the senses through contact with the\r\nworld of Nature, thus arises by virtue of our innate reason, and yet\r\nfind good ground for asking whether physical science may not have\r\nsomething useful and important to tell us about the mechanism and\r\nhistory of this innate reason itself? Is proof that our reason is\r\ninnate, or born with us, proof that it is ultimate or necessary or\r\nbeyond the reach of improvement and development by the application of\r\nnatural knowledge? May not this reason itself prove, perhaps, to be a\r\nmechanical _phenomenon_ of matter and motion, and a part of the\r\ndiscoverable order of physical causation; and may not science some\r\ntime tell us how it became innate, and what it is worth?\r\n\r\nQuestions of this sort are easy to ask but hard to answer; for many\r\nhold our only way to reach an answer to be _to find out_ by scientific\r\nresearch and discovery. While this method may be too slow for _a\r\npriori_ philosophers, may it not be wise for those who, being no\r\nphilosophers, know of no short cut to natural knowledge, to admit\r\nthat, while they would like to know more, they have not yet learned\r\nall there is to learn? If this suspension of judgment is indeed\r\nself-stultification, the case of many students is hard, though they\r\nmay not really find themselves so helpless as they are told that they\r\nmust be; for he who is told by the learned faculty that he is\r\nparalyzed need not be greatly troubled if he finds his powers for\r\nwork as much at his command as they were before.\r\n\r\nThe modern student has heard so many versions of the story of the\r\ntwo-faced shield that he is much disposed to suspect that many of the\r\nquestions which have so long divided \"philosophers\" may be only new\r\nillustrations of the old fable, and he asks whether there need be any\r\nreal antagonism between those who attribute knowledge to experience\r\nand those who attribute it to our innate reason.\r\n\r\nThere are men of science who, seeing no good reason to challenge\r\nPlato's belief that experience, creating nothing, only calls forth the\r\n\"ideas\" which were already dormant or latent in the mind, do\r\nnevertheless find reason to ask whether exhaustive knowledge of our\r\nphysical history may not some time show how these dormant \"ideas\" came\r\nto be what they are. They ask whether errors may not be judgments\r\nwhich lead us into danger and tend to our physical destruction, and\r\nwhether it may not be because a judgment has, in the long run, proved\r\npreservative in the struggle for existence that we call it true. May\r\nnot, for example, the difference between the error that the stick half\r\nin water is bent and the truth that the stick in air is straight, some\r\ntime prove to be that the savage who has rectified his judgment has\r\nspeared his fish, while he who has not has lost his dinner?\r\n\r\nSo long as we can ask such questions as this, how can we be sure that\r\nbecause a judgment is no more than might have been expected from us,\r\nas Nature has made us, at our present intellectual level, it is either\r\nnecessary or ultimate or universal? Things that are innate or natural\r\nare not always necessary or universal, for while reason is natural to\r\nthe mind of man, some men are unreasonable, and a few have been even\r\nknown to be illogical.\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems clear that another view of the groundwork of\r\nscience than that set forth by Professor Mivart is possible, for many\r\nbelieve that this groundwork is to be found in our desire to know what\r\nwe do not yet know, rather than in things known; and they believe they\r\nwish to know in order that they may learn to distinguish truth from\r\nerror, and walk with sure feet where the ignorant grope and stumble.\r\n\r\nMany books are profitable and instructive even if they fail to\r\nconvince; and the question which a prospective student of Mivart's\r\nbook is likely to ask is whether it is consistent with itself; for if\r\nthe author has not so far made himself master of his subject as to\r\nstate his case without palpable contradiction, no one will expect much\r\nhelp from him. It is a remark of Aristotle, in the Introduction to the\r\nParts of Animals, that while one may need special training to tell\r\nwhether an author has proved his point, all may judge whether he is\r\nconsistent with himself, and the attempt to learn whether Mivart's\r\nbook is consistent may not greatly tax our minds.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that many men of science are \"idealists\"; and he says that\r\nidealism, being mere self-stultifying skepticism, must be refuted and\r\ndemolished before we can begin our search for the groundwork of\r\nscience or be sure that we know anything. It would have surprised\r\nBerkeley not a little to be told that his notions are the very essence\r\nof skepticism, for the good bishop tells us again and again that his\r\nonly motive in writing is to make an end of idle skepticism, once for\r\nall, that they who are no philosophers, but simple, honest folks, may\r\ncome by their own and live at ease.\r\n\r\nThere is little ease, and less justice, even at this late day, for the\r\nman of science who insists that he is neither an idealist nor a\r\nmaterialist nor a monist, but a naturalist; and that it will be time\r\nenough to have an opinion as to the relation between mind and matter\r\nwhen we find out; but many will, no doubt, be pleased to hear that the\r\ncrime of which they are now suspected is no longer \"materialism,\" but\r\n\"idealism,\" for the public attaches no odium to the idealist, whatever\r\nmay be Professor Mivart's verdict. Still all must feel an interest in\r\nthe exposure of the weakness of idealism, since we have been told, by\r\nmany shrewd thinkers, that Berkeley's statement of the case, while\r\ninconclusive, is unanswerable; although they hold that it is lack of\r\nexperimental evidence which stands in the way of either its acceptance\r\nor its refutation.\r\n\r\nMivart begins his treatment of idealism by a simple and satisfactory\r\nsummary, pages 36-38, of Berkeley's Principles, but he forgets it on\r\nthe next page, for it is no exaggeration to assert that the \"idealism\"\r\nwhich he refutes is a mere parody on that which he has just given his\r\nreaders, and something that no sane man would dream of holding.\r\n\r\nFor example, he admits, on page 38, that nothing \"can be more absurd\r\nthan the criticism of those persons who say that idealists, to be\r\nconsistent, ought to run up against lamp-posts, fall into ditches, and\r\ncommit other like absurdities.\" On page 47 he undertakes to show, \"by\r\nthe natural spontaneous judgment of mankind,\" that external material\r\nbodies exist \"of themselves, and have a substantial reality in\r\naddition to that of the qualities we perceive; because the spontaneous\r\njudgment of mankind accords with what even animals learn through their\r\nsenses. A wide river is an objective obstacle to the progress of a\r\nman's dog, as well as to that of the dog's owner.\"\r\n\r\nOne who compares the extract from page 38 with this from page 47 can,\r\nso far as I can see, reconcile them only by one of these hypotheses:\r\n1, that Mivart holds a wide river to afford proof of reality which is\r\nnot afforded by a ditch; or, 2, that the dog which does not run\r\nagainst lamp-posts affords evidence of the reality of Nature which is\r\nnot afforded by a man in the same circumstances; or, 3, that \"nothing\r\ncan be more absurd than the criticism of these persons\" who reason\r\nlike Professor Mivart.\r\n\r\nWhile sometimes right and sometimes wrong, like the rest of us, the\r\napostle of tar water was no fool, although the groundwork of Mivart's\r\nscience, in the book before us, is the assertion that idealists\r\nidiotically deny everything which they have not perceived, and hold\r\nthat the external world has no existence.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to see how words could be clearer than those in which\r\nBerkeley repudiates all nonsense of this sort. \"I do not argue,\" says\r\nhe, \"against the existence of any one thing that we apprehend, _either\r\nby sense or by reflection_. That the things I see with my eyes and\r\ntouch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least\r\nquestion. I am of a vulgar cast, simple enough to believe my own\r\nsenses, and to take things as I find them. To be plain, it is my\r\nopinion that the real things are the very things that I see and feel,\r\nand perceive by my senses. I can not for my life help thinking that\r\nsnow is white and fire hot. And as I am no skeptic with regard to the\r\nnature of things, so neither am I as to their existence. That a thing\r\nshould be really perceived by my senses, and at the same time not\r\nreally exist, is to me a plain contradiction. Wood, stone, fire,\r\nwater, flesh, iron, and the like things, which I name and discourse\r\nof, are things I know. Away, then, with all that skepticism, all those\r\nridiculous philosophical doubts! I might as well doubt of my own being\r\nas of the being of those things I actually see and feel.\"\r\n\r\nMivart lays great stress upon the opinion of men in general as a\r\nrefutation of idealism; and as Berkeley also says he is content to\r\nappeal to the common sense of the world, it may be well to ask what\r\nthe verdict of \"plain, untutored men\" is, even if we doubt whether\r\nsuch a jury is the highest tribunal.\r\n\r\n\"Ask the gardener,\" says Berkeley, \"why he thinks yonder cherry tree\r\nexists in the garden, and he shall tell you, because he sees it and\r\nfeels it.\"\r\n\r\nMivart holds it one thing to see, and quite another matter to know\r\nthat we see, for he says that while we see and feel the \"qualities\" of\r\nthings by those \"lower faculties\" which we share with the \"brutes,\" we\r\nperceive the \"substance\" in which these qualities inhere, by certain\r\n\"higher faculties,\" which, whether represented in the brutes by latent\r\npotencies or not, have been \"given\" to man in their completeness, and\r\nnot slowly and gradually built up from low and simple beginnings in\r\nthe brutes.\r\n\r\nThe question we are to ask the gardener is, therefore, something to\r\nthis effect: Whether he thinks the cherry tree exists because he sees\r\nit and feels it, or because, when he sees it and feels it, he knows\r\nthat he does so?\r\n\r\nIf he weighs his words will he not ask how he can know that he does\r\nsee it and feel it unless he knows that he does so? I, myself, am no\r\nphilosopher; but, to my untutored mind, Mivart's distinction between\r\nthings perceived by _sense_, and things _perceived_ by sense, seems a\r\nmere verbal difference of accent and emphasis, rather than a\r\nfundamental distinction.\r\n\r\nAs most men use the word, \"mind\" implies consciousness of that sort\r\nwhich Mivart calls self-consciousness, and while there is no reason\r\nwhy those who choose should not so use the word as to include\r\nunconscious or \"subconscious\" or \"conscientious\" cerebration, most\r\nplain, untutored men prefer to use words as their neighbors do.\r\n\r\nIf long waiting on Nature has given to the old gardener more\r\nshrewdness than we commonly find in those whose pursuits are less\r\nleisurely, he may say that, while he knows the tree is there because\r\nhe has planted it and tended it and watched it grow, it now falls on\r\nhis eyes day after day, without attracting his notice, unless\r\nsomething about it which calls for his skill _catches_ his eye, and\r\n_commands_ his _attention_.\r\n\r\nIf we see reason to believe that this difference is a matter of words\r\nand definitions, rather than a real difference in kind; if we fail to\r\nfind any sharp dividing line between unperceived cerebration and\r\n\"mind,\" is not this, in itself, enough to lead even Macaulay's\r\nschoolboy to ask whether mind may not be a slow and gradual growth\r\nfrom small beginnings, and a co-ordinated whole, to the common\r\nfunction of which all its parts contribute, rather than a \"gift\" of\r\n\"lower faculties\" and \"higher faculties\"?\r\n\r\nWe must ask, however, whether mechanical explanations of mind are in\r\nany way antagonistic to the conviction that it is a gift. May not one\r\nstudy the history of the mechanism of mind, and the way this mechanism\r\nworks, in a spirit of profound and humble gratitude to the Giver of\r\nall good gifts?\r\n\r\nIs the lamentable prevalence, among plain untutored men, of the notion\r\nthat mechanical explanations of Nature are inconsistent with belief\r\nthat all Nature is a gift, to be laid to the charge of the men of\r\nscience?\r\n\r\nIs it not rather the poisonous fruit of the ill-advised attempts of\r\n\"philosophers\" like Professor Mivart to teach that a gift can not be a\r\ngift at all unless it is an arbitrary interruption to the law and\r\norder of physical Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] The Groundwork of Science. A Study of Epistemology. By St. George\r\nMivart, M.D., Ph.D., F.R.S. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENCE OF OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES LIVY WHITTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an era of observation; in many fields and in divers countries\r\nthe study of Nature from a strictly scientific standpoint is being\r\nprosecuted with results which are rapidly increasing our knowledge of\r\nthe universe. This modern growth has come about as the natural rebound\r\nof the suppressed energy that has been held forcibly under subjugation\r\nduring the last two thousand years, at a time when the closing echoes\r\nof the warfare between the literal interpretation of the Scriptures\r\nand science have ceased.\r\n\r\nA review of this long battle with the forces of the Catholic and\r\nProtestant churches on the one hand, arrayed against a relatively few\r\ninvestigators, scattered through the last ten centuries, on the other\r\nhand, shows a record on which none can look without regret. As far as\r\nwe are able to learn, there was little opposition to the study of\r\nscience before the collection and translation of the old manuscripts\r\nnow constituting the Alexandrian version of the Bible and the\r\nconsequent upbuilding of the Jewish church. The remains of ancient\r\nEgyptian civilization show that science prior to that period, as\r\nmeasured by the discoveries in physics and astronomy, had attained no\r\ninconsiderable prominence; and had this people endured until the\r\npresent time, uninfluenced by the strife that for many centuries\r\nracked the inhabitants of the eastern hemisphere, we should to-day be\r\nfar more advanced in our understanding of the universe.\r\n\r\nIn the more progressive countries, at least, the breaking of the\r\nshackles in which the investigating mind had been imprisoned for so\r\nlong has led not only to a greater number of scientific workers, but\r\nalso to an increase in the fields of observation. The methods of\r\ninvestigation have likewise undergone a transformation. In place of\r\ndeductive reasoning, even as late as a few decades in the past,\r\nconclusions and generalizations are now founded on lines of thought\r\nmore largely inductive. Men of middle age are able to recall the time\r\nwhen even our leading institutions of learning required instruction in\r\nseveral branches of science to be given by one teacher. It was\r\npossible twenty-five years ago for a man of great ability to master\r\nthe essentials of the leading sciences and to teach them, but under\r\nthe present stimulus for investigation no one can hope to excel in\r\nmore than one subject. It has thus come about that in place of the\r\nmany-sided teacher of science we now have in our larger universities\r\nspecialists in every subject. As the work of research progresses, the\r\nspecialist--for example, in geology--is compelled by the increased\r\nscope of the information on his subject to select one branch of\r\ngeology of which he shall be master. The chair of geology is now split\r\nup into economic, glacial, and mining geology, paleontology, etc., and\r\nspecialists are required in each division. This breaking up is true of\r\nmost other sciences. In this labyrinth of specialized subjects, and\r\nthe maze of technical terms rendered necessary thereby, the people as\r\na whole can only grope in darkness; but out of this bewildering\r\ncondition of affairs, from the mass of facts collected, and the\r\nresulting generalizations and theories, there may be culled the kernel\r\nof one important principle by means of which these facts are\r\nascertained and the generalizations made. The growth of science and\r\nits ever-ramifying divisions, and the gradual establishment of new\r\nmethods of investigation, have brought forth what may be termed the\r\nscience of observation; and it is through an application of the above\r\nprinciple that the people may be taught correctly to interpret Nature,\r\nand, by their new habit of thought, to free the brain from the tangle\r\nof superstition which is still present with most of us.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of how to observe natural phenomena and to draw correct\r\ninferences therefrom has been the product of slow growth, while\r\nthrough long custom, in matters closely pertaining to our daily life,\r\nthere has been observation on strictly scientific principles for\r\ncenturies. Stated succinctly, natural phenomena are due to causes, one\r\nor more, simple or complex. These causes are the laws of the universe,\r\nand to arrive at an understanding of them we must free our minds of\r\nany bias and study phenomena experimentally in the laboratory, or in\r\nour daily contact with Nature. In this way a mass of facts will be\r\ngathered by the systematic observer which will be found to fall into\r\nnatural groups, and by inductive reasoning the laws governing each\r\ngroup may be learned. It is not possible for mankind as a whole to\r\ninvestigate in this exhaustive manner; but it is important that the\r\nmethod of arriving at the laws of Nature be understood. Many and, in\r\nfact, most phenomena met with in some of the sciences, particularly\r\nthose having to deal with the earth, are susceptible of correct\r\ninterpretation without attempting broad generalizations, if the\r\nprinciples of scientific observation are brought to bear upon their\r\nsolution, and it is our purpose to show by practical examples drawn\r\nfrom Nature how elementary students may attack and solve some of the\r\nsimple problems met with on every side. It is proposed to use for\r\nillustration simple phenomena pertaining to the earth, drawn from\r\ngeology and its newly constituted sister science, physical geography.\r\nThese two sciences perhaps afford the greatest range of phenomena,\r\nwhich are accessible to every one, in whatsoever part of the earth he\r\nmay reside. No part of the land surface is wanting in problems which\r\ndemand explanation, and which may be attacked from the standpoint of\r\nthe geologist or physical geographer, or both.\r\n\r\nOne of the most pronounced departures taking place in\r\npreparatory-school education at the present time is to be found in the\r\nprominence given to these subjects, not only in the schoolroom, but by\r\npractical experience in the laboratory of Nature, among the hills and\r\nmountains, as well. The object of this departure is twofold: the first\r\nand most important is to train the young early to observe phenomena\r\nand to interpret them; the second, in a narrower sense, is purely\r\neducational. The one inculcates a habit of thought that will be of\r\ninestimable advantage in pursuing future study; the other, without\r\ntaking into consideration the element of mental training, constitutes\r\ninstruction in concrete things that are matters of general education.\r\n\r\nBefore the student in the introductory schools is brought in contact\r\nwith problems in the field, it is essential that he receive text-book\r\nor oral instruction in some of the geological processes giving rise to\r\nthe phenomena to be studied later out of doors. In practical teaching\r\nthe student is taken on excursions into the region not far removed\r\nfrom the school. At first some simple geological facts are shown him,\r\noften on a very small scale, but embodying principles which, when\r\nunderstood, lead to a ready interpretation of larger problems. Step by\r\nstep the first principles are amplified by a larger and more varied\r\nclass of examples, until the student is able logically to apply the\r\nreasoning in explanation of simple problems to the solution of the\r\ngreater problems in physical geography and geology. In the absence of\r\nsuch excursions, I shall introduce a series of photographs carefully\r\narranged to lead the reader along the same line of reasoning up to\r\nsimilar broad conclusions--a method which, if not so satisfactory and\r\ninstructive, will at least have an educative value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--QUARRY SHOWING FRESH AND WEATHERED ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nOur first excursion will be to a locality where an open cut has been\r\nmade for the purpose of carrying on quarrying operations. The\r\naccompanying photograph has been so taken as to include both the top\r\nand the bottom of the quarry (Fig. 1). Let us first inspect the rock\r\nin the lower part of the quarry. The existence of planes of fracture,\r\nor joints, crossing the rock in various directions, dividing it into\r\nblocks, early attracts our attention. The stone appears dark-colored,\r\ntough, and is seen to be made up of two or three different minerals:\r\none is black, cleaves readily into thin plates of a translucent\r\nnature, and we easily recognize it as an iron-bearing mica, or\r\nisinglass. Another is white, and cleaves or breaks in two directions,\r\nmaking angles of about ninety degrees; this we know as common\r\nfeldspar. The third is less easily recognized as pyroxene, another of\r\nthe many minerals containing iron. Having tested our knowledge of\r\nmineralogy, we will look about and see if all the rock exposed is\r\nlike that at the bottom of the quarry. As we ascend from the point\r\nindicated by the lower hammer, we notice that the dark blue rock\r\ngradually takes on a rusty hue, and its toughness has become less.\r\nGoing still higher, the rusty character increases, and along joints\r\nthe rock is so lacking in coherency as to fall to pieces when struck a\r\nlight blow with a hammer. The central portions of the blocks, however,\r\nafter we have removed the outer shell of rusty material, are seen to\r\nbe like the lower rock. In the middle foreground of the picture there\r\nare shown several bowlders derived from above, which are merely these\r\nresidual cores, and are known as bowlders of disintegration. These are\r\nalso shown in place near the top of the picture at the extreme left.\r\nNear the top of the quarry, at a point marked by the upper hammer, the\r\nsolid rock gives place to a rusty mass of loose material, traversing\r\nwhich the cracks may still be seen, and in which there are few\r\nindications of the solid rock[8] (see Fig. 2). This loose material\r\nwhen carefully examined is found to be made up of exactly the same\r\nminerals as the dense rock below, but we notice that the mica and\r\npyroxene are rusty and that the feldspar is stained yellowish brown.\r\nThe pyroxene in particular is very much changed, and quickly crumbles\r\naway in the hand. It is clear that there is every stage between the\r\nsolid rock and the incoherent powder at the surface of the ground. The\r\njoint planes crossing the solid rock below may still be observed\r\ntraversing the decayed portion, and also many rounded areas of rock,\r\nwhich are seen to be identical with the stone at the bottom of the\r\nquarry.[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--DETAILED VIEW OF A PORTION OF QUARRY SHOWING\r\nWEATHERED ROCK.]\r\n\r\nHow shall the facts before us be explained? It has been shown that the\r\ndense rock and the loose material are the same mineralogically, and\r\ngrade from one into the other, and it is certainly rational to suppose\r\nthat the latter is merely a changed form of the first. Some force must\r\nhave been at work on the solid rock, destroying its coherency and\r\nconverting it into loose sand. If we inspect the powdered rock, it\r\nwill become apparent that this change has been brought about mainly by\r\nthe process of weathering: surface water, with its ever-present acid\r\nimpurities, has brought about the partial decay of the pyroxene and\r\nmica and caused the disintegration of the upper part of the rock.\r\nWater has not only attacked the rock from the upper surface, but has\r\npenetrated to considerable depths along the joint planes, working\r\ninward toward the center of each block until the mass becomes\r\ncompletely disintegrated. This process explains the concentric shells\r\nabout cores of unaltered rock, each representing original joint\r\nblocks, which are seen in the second photograph. All our excursions\r\ninto the field will show that this is not an isolated case, for\r\nwherever a ledge is exposed to our view there will be found a zone of\r\nweathered rock, varying in thickness from mere films to many feet.\r\n\r\nBy this process the greatest part of the materials constituting soils\r\nis formed, and the flora and fauna of the earth are rendered possible.\r\nUpon such products of decay the food supply of running water\r\nmanifestly depends in a large measure, as will be pointed out on our\r\nnext excursion; and were the scope of this article somewhat larger, it\r\nwould be easy to show that the rock decay seen in our photograph has\r\ntaken place in a length of time measured by something like ten\r\nthousand years. If all rock decayed as easily, and if the rate of\r\ndecomposition, as determined here, held good for great distances from\r\nthe surface, mountains two miles in height would become a prey to the\r\nforce of chemical action in six and a half million years. We can not,\r\nhowever, give a time equivalent for the destruction of a mountain\r\nrange, since decay, and consequent disintegration, is only one of the\r\nmany forces acting to sap the strength of solid rocks and to tear them\r\nasunder. The above figures are given merely to make plain that the\r\ntime necessary to accomplish the leveling of a mountain chain is but a\r\nsmall part of the earth's existence as such, great as this period may\r\nseem from the standpoint of human history.\r\n\r\nWe shall, if possible, time the second excursion immediately after a\r\nheavy rain, and we shall select for our objective point a place where\r\nthe rain water, in its efforts to reach a stream, is forced to run\r\ndown some steep declivity. Under such circumstances, the carrying\r\npower of the water will be very great, and we shall hope to find\r\nevidence of its work in transporting the products of rock weathering\r\nand other material broken up by the action of frost. A little\r\ndiligence will soon reward us with the evidence which we seek. A local\r\ninequality of the ground, perhaps only a few feet across, is found\r\nfilled with water--a minute, temporary lake caused by the recent heavy\r\nrainfall. Such little water bodies are extremely common, but the\r\naccompanying geological phenomena are, notwithstanding, none the less\r\ninteresting, and the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence thus\r\npresented are none the less valuable.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the pool critically, it will be noticed that its shore\r\nline is cut by a little channel along which the overflow makes its\r\nescape. Further investigation will show that at another point along\r\nthe shore, especially if we are fortunate enough to visit the locality\r\nvery soon after a rain, there is a small rivulet entering the pool;\r\nand also that the entering stream is discolored with mud and carries\r\nmore or less sand, while the escaping stream is nearly clear, and is\r\nfree from all traces of coarse, sandy material. It is therefore\r\nevident that the sediment brought in by the stream has been left\r\nbehind in the pool, and of course will be found deposited at its\r\nbottom, and it will appear that the only explanation of the inability\r\nof the water further to transport its burden is to be found in the\r\nfact that water loses nearly all its motion, and therefore its\r\ntransporting power, on entering a stagnant pool. These are elementary\r\ntruths, but an amplification of such simple phenomena is often fully\r\ncapable of accounting for the most stupendous results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--TEMPORARY WET-WEATHER DELTA.]\r\n\r\nHaving made these observations, let us look at the form assumed by the\r\nsediment when it is forced to fall to the bottom. At the point where\r\nthe stream enters the pool there is seen an accumulation of material\r\nhaving a nearly level upper surface, presenting a scalloped or\r\nlobe-shaped outer margin, upon which the stream may be seen flowing\r\nand entering the water at one of the lobes. Other channels, though\r\nunoccupied by water, also lead to similar lobes. If we watch closely,\r\nwe may be able to witness the growth of this body of sand, called a\r\ndelta, as the falling sediment rapidly increases the size of the lobe;\r\nand also to perceive that as soon as the lobe is built out\r\nconsiderably in advance of the main body of sand, it will be easier\r\nfor the stream to enter the water on one side of the scallop, thus\r\nabandoning its old mouth. In this manner the stream moves from one\r\nplace to another, successively building the little scallops and\r\ncontinually carving new channels for itself. Fig. 3 is a photograph of\r\nsuch a delta, some three feet across, taken after the water had been\r\ndrained away, and reveals its form in a characteristic manner. As we\r\nwatch its growth, it will become evident that only the coarsest\r\nmaterial transported by the stream goes to make up the delta, and that\r\nthe clay and finest sand are deposited farther away, where the water\r\nis more quiet, or else pass out in the stream draining the pool. Let\r\nus look about a little. Not far from our miniature lake there are\r\nseveral others. In some the size of the delta is much larger in\r\nproportion to the area of the pool than is the case with the one first\r\nstudied. We find in some cases that the stream has progressively built\r\nits delta completely across the old water surface. Taking a thin piece\r\nof board or a large knife, we can easily cut vertically through this\r\nsand deposit, thus exposing what is called a geological section. The\r\nsand grains of which the deposit is largely composed are seen to be\r\narranged in layers nearly horizontal, and these layers are found to be\r\ndue to alternations of sediment varying in fineness. This phenomenon\r\nis called stratification, and is what we should expect of the action\r\nof gravity operating on material of different sizes and densities\r\nsuspended in a body of water. It has been found inexpedient to attempt\r\nto show a photograph of this section, owing to the smallness of the\r\nsubject, but the same phenomena may be observed on a much larger scale\r\nin Fig. 5, which will be described below.\r\n\r\nA few rods away the stream that feeds the pool has its origin. The\r\nsediment carried by the water and going to build up its delta has its\r\nsource in part in a neighboring bank made up of material derived from\r\nsolid rock by weathering, similar to that shown on our first\r\nexcursion, and partly from older water deposits. Steep channels exist\r\nin the disintegrated rock, which represent the material removed by the\r\nfast-flowing rain water.\r\n\r\nNow what geological phenomena have we observed at this locality? In\r\nthe first place, it has become clear that running water possesses the\r\npower of transporting sediment. In the second place, this sediment has\r\nbeen deposited wherever the velocity of the water has been materially\r\nchecked. The sediment has been laid down in horizontal layers under\r\nthe influence of gravity. Furthermore, the material of which the delta\r\nis composed has been shown, in part at least, to have been derived\r\nfrom a solid rock such as forms our mountains. In our first excursion\r\nwe saw that chemical change promoted disintegration; in our second,\r\nrunning water is observed seizing upon these products of decay,\r\ntransporting them and building them into stratified deposits in the\r\nfirst convenient pool. A level-topped delta is first formed, which may\r\nor may not grow to fill the pool in which it is born. Some of the\r\npools have become filled, while the delta as such has disappeared; it\r\nhas grown into a tiny sand plain.\r\n\r\nLet us see if the work performed by these temporary rivulets is\r\ntypical of running water in general. For this purpose we shall visit a\r\nspot where a river enters some considerable body of water such as a\r\nlake. Let us inspect the river. Its water is sluggish, discolored by\r\norganic matter derived from decaying vegetation, and for some distance\r\nup stream from its mouth it meanders slowly across a flat, marshy area\r\nor meadow. If we also visit the spot at a time when the river is\r\nswollen by heavy rains or melting snows, the presence of this organic\r\nmatter will be masked by the turbidity of the water; we shall learn\r\nthat only in the freshet seasons does the water attain sufficient\r\nvelocity to carry any visible load of sand and clay. The upper end of\r\nthe lake will be found to be shallow, muddy, and water lilies will\r\nhave discovered congenial surroundings. At another part of the lake\r\nthe outflowing water appears clear as crystal; the sediment brought in\r\nby the river has manifestly been deposited in the lake, as was the\r\ncase in our little pool. The marsh at the upper end, of course, is\r\nmerely another delta, slow growing in this instance, grass-covered,\r\nbut as surely encroaching on the water area as in the earlier\r\nexamples. When an entering stream is normally of great transporting\r\npower, owing to steep slopes down which it rushes, the form of its\r\ndelta is not unlike the one first described.\r\n\r\nWith the data already gathered, we can not escape from the conclusion\r\nthat the growth going on at the head of the lake will in time, if\r\npresent conditions continue to exist, push its way forward until it\r\nhas occupied the whole water area. The sediment which is now deposited\r\ntherein will then be transported across the plain, and will be carried\r\nalong until another body of water is reached. Further search will\r\nbring to light the fact that there are plenty of examples showing all\r\nstages between the simple delta and the completely filled lake. The\r\ninnumerable marshes and meadows which characterize the northern part\r\nof the United States are fine examples of lakes which have perished in\r\nthis manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--A COMMON FORM OF LARGE DELTA.]\r\n\r\nOur next excursion will be made to the locality shown in Fig. 4, which\r\nis a sketch of a large delta occurring at a considerable height above\r\nthe general level of the country, although at the present time the\r\ndelta is not in vicinity of water.[10] It will be evident to the\r\nreader that it differs in no important particular, excepting size,\r\nfrom our little type specimen formed in a pool. Its level top and\r\nfrontal lobes are to-day nearly as strongly marked as at the time it\r\nwas made. The reader will have little difficulty in picturing the\r\noriginal conditions of its formation in some ancient lake. This old\r\nlake did not endure until the inflowing streams had filled it to a\r\nlevel plain, but for some reason, which it is unnecessary for us to\r\nconsider, the water was permitted to escape, leaving the delta perched\r\non the valley side. Such deltas are very common, and we find them in\r\nall stages, from simple beginnings, as above, to the completed sand\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--GEOLOGICAL CROSS-SECTION OF A DELTA.]\r\n\r\nThe sand of which our first delta was composed has already been\r\nreferred to as arranged in horizontal layers. In order to verify our\r\nconclusions regarding the origin of this delta, let us seek for an\r\nopportunity to observe its internal structure, and to compare it with\r\nthat observed in the first example. It may happen that the opportunity\r\ndoes not exist at this immediate locality, but a little way off a\r\nsimilar deposit occurs, and a beautiful section has been uncovered by\r\nthe vigorous attacks of a steam shovel. This section has already been\r\nreferred to on page 464, as illustrating the structure of the sand\r\nlayers making up the tiny delta, as well as water deposits in general,\r\nand is reproduced here as Fig. 5. The reader will observe in this\r\npicture many familiar features common to railroad excavations. The\r\nupper part of the geological section thus exposed is somewhat masked\r\nby a downfall of sand and loam, and the lower part is also hidden by\r\nthe same materials. Along the central part, however, the sand and\r\ngravel may be seen arranged in horizontal layers of a varying\r\nthickness. A close inspection of the uppermost layers will detect a\r\nvariation in coarseness among the different strata. Such alternations\r\nof layers of coarse and fine material are due to differences in the\r\ntransporting power of the running water that brought the sand and\r\npebbles to their present resting place; the coarse gravel and pebbles\r\nwere carried by fast-flowing rivers, and the fine sand by streams of\r\nless rapidity and consequently less transporting power. Beds of this\r\ncharacter ordinarily correspond closely in time with alternating\r\nperiods of great rainfall or snow melting and the summer seasons. The\r\npebbles of which the coarse layers are composed, as we should expect,\r\nare far from spherical, and the operation of gravity on such bodies,\r\nas they fall to the floor of a lake or ocean, is to cause them to\r\narrange themselves with their flat surfaces horizontal and parallel to\r\none another. In the example before us this fact is apparent, and\r\naffords the basis for another line of reasoning by which all such\r\nstratified deposits, however great their magnitude, are to be referred\r\nto the same source--namely, stream-transported materials derived from\r\na decaying and wasting land surface, laid down in water under the\r\ninfluence of gravity.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at a most important and far-reaching\r\ngeneralization so far as the work performed by running water is\r\nconcerned, and its action in filling our lakes and ponds; and we have\r\nlearned by observation on a small scale the means by which such\r\ndeposits may be recognized. Let us apply these means of recognition to\r\nthe phenomena shown by our large rivers and the more enduring oceans\r\ninto which they drain. In the same manner that we have studied the\r\nlittle pool and larger lake, we will look into the work done by the\r\ngreat waterways of our continents, selecting as a type of such streams\r\nthe mighty Mississippi. Careful measurement has shown that this river\r\nannually transports two hundred million tons of sediment mechanically\r\nsuspended. What becomes of this enormous quantity of sand and clay,\r\nequal to a cubic mile in a little over a century, as it is swept into\r\nthe waters of the Gulf of Mexico? For this purpose we have only to\r\nvisit the region about its mouth to become acquainted with the almost\r\nimpotent struggles that have been made by our Government during the\r\nlast fifty years in an effort to keep the river below New Orleans, in\r\npart at least, confined to its present channels; and to study the\r\nchart of that portion of the Gulf coast prepared by the United States\r\nCoast and Geodetic Survey (see Fig. 6). We have not forgotten the\r\nlittle lobes; their method of growth, and the general form of our\r\nfirst-seen delta, shown in Fig. 3. In viewing the phenomena at the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi, it is no longer necessary for our present\r\npurposes to make a detailed study, since it will become apparent at\r\nonce that the river is doing the work on a larger scale typified by\r\nthe performance of the tiny stream flowing into its temporary pool. In\r\nplace of the little delta with its still smaller lobes, the\r\nMississippi has deposited at its mouth an enormous delta, thousands of\r\nsquare miles in area, and its bifurcating arms may be seen building\r\nout several scallops for miles into the waters of the gulf. For\r\ncenturies these long lobes have been building in advance of the delta\r\nfront. The arms gradually become clogged with sediment, a new passage\r\nto the ocean is opened on the sides, where deposition will begin at a\r\nnew point, producing a lobe as before. Situated many miles up the\r\nriver, it is to-day the great fear of New Orleans that its only\r\nnavigable arm to the sea will thus be closed to that commerce upon\r\nwhich the life of the city depends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--THE DELTA OF THE MISSISSIPPI.]\r\n\r\nOnly a portion of the sediment brought in by the river goes to form\r\nits delta; a large part of the finest material, such as clay, is\r\ntransported by temporary and permanent currents thousands of miles\r\naway, where it is deposited in the more quiet waters of the ocean. In\r\nthis manner the Mississippi has been shown to deposit a cubic mile of\r\nmechanically transported material in a little over a century. What\r\nshall we say of the effects produced on the continents and oceans by\r\nthousands of rivers, each doing its proportionate share of work and\r\nacting through millions of years? Two main results must follow, unless\r\ninterruptions occur: the lower elevations and the magnificent mountain\r\nranges, which rear their lofty heads above the permanent snow line,\r\nwill be divided into minor peaks; valleys will be carved out; the\r\nwhole land surface will slowly waste away, at first rapidly, at last\r\nslowly, and be transported to the oceans, where it will form great\r\nhorizontal beds differing in no essential particular, excepting size,\r\nfrom those shown in Fig. 5--great deposits that are merely deltas on a\r\nlarge scale. The geologist, however, finds no evidence to indicate\r\nthat at any time in the earth's history have these theoretical results\r\ntaken place. Land masses, of continental dimensions, have not been\r\nallowed thus to waste entirely away to a general flatness on account\r\nof the interruptions caused by elevation--the bodily lifting of great\r\nareas of rock, even out of the ocean floor, to become mountains or\r\nplateaus, in some cases higher than any point in this country. If our\r\nobservations thus far and those yet to be made serve to make this\r\nclear, one of the objects of this article will have been\r\naccomplished. It is to be hoped that our observations have made plain\r\nthe processes of rock disintegration and water transportation; that in\r\nthe oceans all these materials are eventually deposited in beds\r\nhorizontally arranged, composed of such products of decay in the\r\ncondition of sand and mud. We have only to point out the proof that\r\ngreat land masses, composed of water-deposited materials, have been\r\nlifted from the ocean to become continents and mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nAs the ocean deposits slowly accumulate in layers to beds of many\r\nthousands of feet in thickness, the lower parts are gradually\r\nsubjected to greatly increased pressure produced by the overlying\r\nbeds. During this time waters of a varying temperature, carrying,\r\nchemically dissolved, great quantities of lime, silica, and iron\r\noxide, are allowed free circulation through them. These conditions\r\npromote chemical change: much silica (the mineral quartz), lesser\r\namounts of carbonate of lime (the mineral calcite), and iron oxide are\r\nprecipitated about the loose sand grains, firmly cementing them\r\ntogether into a solid rock. A cycle has thus been completed; the dense\r\nrocks composing a continent have passed by the process of weathering\r\ninto incoherent sand and clay, which, when transported to the ocean\r\nfloor, become again converted into solid rock.\r\n\r\nHistorical records prove that during the last three thousand years\r\nthere have taken place many changes in the ocean's level. Old islands\r\nhave disappeared; new ones have emerged above the surface of the\r\nwater. Great stretches of seacoast exist at the present time which\r\nwithin the historical period have been covered by the ocean. Even at\r\nthe present writing we are witnessing the gradual submergence of some\r\nparts of the earth and the rising of others; terraces on the northern\r\nAtlantic coast may be seen along the hillsides many feet above the\r\npresent level of the ocean--all of which go to show that the\r\nrelationship of the land to the water is an unstable one. These are\r\nthe evidences of continental growth and depressions from the\r\nhistorical standpoint, and the validity of the data upon which the\r\nbelief is founded can not be shaken. The evidence from the geological\r\nside is overwhelming, but before we speak of this it will be well once\r\nmore to say a word as to the causes of continental uplift.\r\n\r\nFrom an original fluid globe possessing a high temperature, the earth\r\nhas now cooled down to a degree sufficiently low to permit the\r\nformation of a thick rock crust. Underneath this crust an approach to\r\nthe old surface temperatures is still maintained, and the existence of\r\na certain degree of fluidity is demonstrated to us from time to time\r\nby the phenomenon of volcanism. Successive zones of cooling took\r\nplace. The outer part could only conform to a shrinking interior by\r\nwrinkling, folding, or bodily lifting considerable areas above the\r\ngeneral level. An adjustment of strains thus set up would take place\r\neither with or without folding of the strata. These initial wrinkles\r\ngave rise to our first mountains, and the continuation of these\r\nconditions at the present time is as surely nourishing mountain growth\r\nas at any time in the past. In this way the fluctuations of the\r\nocean's level, above referred to, alone are to be explained, and such\r\nform but temporary rises and falls in the history of a continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--MOUNTAIN SHOWING ROCK FOLDING.]\r\n\r\nThe rate at which an ocean bed is raised to form a mountain range is,\r\nno doubt, a variable one; always slow, often interrupted, but seldom\r\nor never violent. During this time the strata usually undergo crushing\r\nand folding; stretching takes place, and displacements of the rocks,\r\nor faulting, are not uncommon. As an example of the wrinkling that the\r\nstrata may suffer under these conditions, the reader is referred to\r\nthe beautiful symmetrical fold shown on the side of a mountain in the\r\nAppalachians (Fig. 7). Similar folding is the rule, but often immense\r\nareas are raised to great heights above the ocean without disturbing\r\nthe horizontal position of the beds (see Fig. 8). Coincident with the\r\nemergence of the rocks from beneath the water, there begin the\r\nattacks of the forces operating to destroy them. Hand in hand there go\r\non growth and destruction. The two may keep an even pace; either may\r\nobtain the mastery. In the one case, lack of considerable elevation\r\nand flatness result; in the other, great altitudes may be attained.\r\nThe rivers may cut their valleys downward as fast as the land rises,\r\nor the down-cutting may be relatively slower. In any case, after a\r\ngiven land mass has attained its greatest height above the sea, the\r\nlarger rivers soon cut their channels down as far as river cutting is\r\npossible--namely, to within a few feet of sea level. With relatively\r\nrapid elevation, soft rocks, and large rivers, the resultant valley\r\ntakes the form of a cañon, examples of which are found along the\r\ncourses of the Colorado and the Yellowstone Rivers (see Fig. 8).[11]\r\nValleys of this nature soon lose their steep sides by the action of\r\nweathering and all that this implies, and pass into a more open state,\r\nlike that shown in Fig. 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--HORIZONTAL ROCKS, GRAND CAÑON OF THE\r\nCOLORADO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--MOUNT STEPHEN, SHOWING ITS HORIZONTAL ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nThese views have been selected in order that a comparison of this type\r\nof mountain structure may be made with that shown in Fig. 6. The\r\npoints of resemblance between the two sections exposed, one by a steam\r\nshovel, the other by river action, are the horizontal position of the\r\nstrata and the alternations of beds of unlike character. The\r\ndifferences are mainly that the beds making up the mountain show that\r\nthey are built up of alternating layers of sand (now converted into a\r\nsandstone) and clay (now in the condition of a slate). Are not these\r\nthe products of a decayed continent? Is their position to be explained\r\notherwise than along the lines already stated? Our only difficulty in\r\nreadily accepting this conclusion is founded on a hereditary belief,\r\nborn in ignorance and nourished to maturity by superstition, that the\r\nearth came into existence as we see it to-day, the surface dissected\r\nby valleys in which the rivers find established courses to the sea;\r\npossessing a multiplicity of highland and lowland, granite mountains\r\nand marble hills, as a result of some plan carried into effect as a\r\ncreative act. Science has revealed the impossibility of this\r\ninterpretation. Considered in the light of evolution, acting through\r\nan immense period of time, by means of the processes already\r\nenumerated, the diversity of land form is made plain to us, and the\r\never-varying characters of rock structure and composition are in the\r\nmain made easy of comprehension. Viewed in the light of the foregoing\r\npages, and illustrating as they do land form and the greater part of\r\nthe earth's crust, the rock structures revealed on the sides of the\r\nmountains and cañons, as well as the broader valley itself, take on a\r\nnew and more intelligent interest. High and enduring as the mountains\r\nmay appear, resistant as their solid rocks may seem, they are doomed\r\nas mountains to the same fate that their own structure and composition\r\nprove to have overtaken earlier mountains before them.\r\n\r\nThe earth has known no cessation in this cycle of decay, deposition,\r\nand elevation; again and again have continental masses been raised\r\nfrom the ocean floor only to become a prey to the forces that destroy\r\nthem. These cycles will continue--mountain ranges will fade away and\r\nnew ones will be born. A more permanent relationship between the\r\nlowland, the upland, and the ocean level will never be attained until\r\nthe forces that warp and wrinkle the earth's crust shall have ceased\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The position of the solid rock is shown by the hammer at the\r\nextreme right, standing vertically.\r\n\r\n[9] This photograph represents a more detailed view of the quarry wall\r\nseen in Fig. 1. The relation of the two views will be understood by\r\nobserving the positions of the hammers, which are in the same place in\r\nboth photographs. These photographs, as well as some of the others\r\nthat follow, were taken by Mr. John L. Gardner, 2d, for the purpose of\r\nillustrating these pages.\r\n\r\n[10] In order to obtain this sketch, a survey was made of the delta,\r\nand from the information thus gathered a model was constructed out of\r\nclay. The dimensions of the delta are about one thousand by seven\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\n[11] The bottom of the cañon at this point is between four and five\r\nthousand feet below the flat surfaces in the foreground--a sheer\r\ndescent of nearly a mile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     M.

JAGGAR, JR., PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCases of asphyxiation by gas have been very frequently reported of\r\nlate years, and we commonly associate with such reports the idea of a\r\nsecond-rate hotel and an unsophisticated countryman who blows out the\r\ngas. Such incidents we connect with the supercivilization of the\r\nnineteenth century, but it is none the less true that Nature furnishes\r\nsimilar accidents, and that in regions far remote from the haunts of\r\nmen. In the heart of the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming, unknown to either\r\nthe tourist or the trapper, there is a natural hostelry for the wild\r\ninhabitants of the forest, where, with food, drink, and shelter all in\r\nsight, the poor creatures are tempted one after another into a bath of\r\ninvisible poisonous vapor, where they sink down to add their bones to\r\nthe fossil records of an interminable list of similar tragedies,\r\ndating back to a period long preceding the records of human history.\r\n\r\nIt was the writer's privilege, as a member of the expedition of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey of the Yellowstone Park, under the\r\ndirection of Mr. Arnold Hague, to visit and for the first time to\r\nphotograph this remarkable locality. A similar visit was last made by\r\nmembers of the survey in the summer of 1888, and an account of the\r\ndiscovery of Death Gulch was published in Science (February 15, 1889)\r\nunder the title A Deadly Gas Spring in the Yellowstone Park, by Mr.\r\nWalter Harvey Weed. The following extracts from Mr. Weed's paper\r\nindicate concisely the general character of the gulch, and the\r\ndescription of the death-trap as it then appeared offers interesting\r\nmaterial for comparison with its condition as observed in the summer\r\nof 1897.\r\n\r\nDeath Gulch is a small and gloomy ravine in the northeast corner of\r\nthe Yellowstone National Park. \"In this region the lavas which fill\r\nthe ancient basin of the park rest upon the flanks of mountains formed\r\nof fragmentary volcanic ejecta, ... while the hydrothermal forces of\r\nthe central portion of the park show but feeble manifestations of\r\ntheir energy in the almost extinct hot-spring areas of Soda Butte,\r\nLamar River, Cache Creek, and Miller Creek.\" Although hot water no\r\nlonger flows from these vents, \"gaseous emanations are now given off\r\nin considerable volume.\" On Cache Creek, about two miles above its\r\nconfluence with Lamar River, are deposits of altered and crystalline\r\ntravertine, with pools in the creek violently effervescing locally.\r\nThis is due to the copious emission of gas. Above these deposits \"the\r\ncreek cuts into a bank of sulphur and gravel cemented by this\r\nmaterial, and a few yards beyond is the _débouchure_ of a small\r\nlateral gully coming down from the mountainside. In its bottom is a\r\nsmall stream of clear and cold water, sour with sulphuric acid, and\r\nflowing down a narrow and steep channel cut in beds of dark-gray\r\nvolcanic tuff. Ascending this gulch, the sides, closing together,\r\nbecome very steep slopes of white, decomposed rock.... The only\r\nsprings now flowing are small oozes of water issuing from the base of\r\nthese slopes, or from the channel bed, forming a thick, creamy, white\r\ndeposit about the vents, and covering the stream bed. This deposit\r\nconsists largely of sulphate of alumina.... About one hundred and\r\nfifty feet above the main stream these oozing springs of acid water\r\ncease, but the character of the gulch remains the same. The odor of\r\nsulphur now becomes stronger, though producing no other effect than a\r\nslight irritation of the lungs.\r\n\r\n\"The gulch ends, or rather begins, in a scoop or basin about two\r\nhundred and fifty feet above Cache Creek, and just below this was\r\nfound the fresh body of a large bear, a silver-tip grizzly, with the\r\nremains of a companion in an advanced stage of decomposition above\r\nhim. Near by were the skeletons of four more bears, with the bones of\r\nan elk a yard or two above, while in the bottom of the pocket were the\r\nfresh remains of several squirrels, rock hares, and other small\r\nanimals, besides numerous dead butterflies and insects. The body of\r\nthe grizzly was carefully examined for bullet holes or other marks of\r\ninjury, but showed no traces of violence, the only indication being a\r\nfew drops of blood under the nose. It was evident that he had met his\r\ndeath but a short time before, as the carcass was still perfectly\r\nfresh, though offensive enough at the time of a later visit. The\r\nremains of a cinnamon bear just above and alongside of this were in an\r\nadvanced state of decomposition, while the other skeletons were almost\r\ndenuded of flesh, though the claws and much of the hair remained. It\r\nwas apparent that these animals, as well as the squirrels and insects,\r\nhad not met their death by violence, but had been asphyxiated by the\r\nirrespirable gas given off in the gulch. The hollows were tested for\r\ncarbonic-acid gas with lighted tapers without proving its presence,\r\nbut the strong smell of sulphur, and a choking sensation of the lungs,\r\nindicated the presence of noxious gases, while the strong wind\r\nprevailing at the time, together with the open nature of the ravine,\r\nmust have caused a rapid diffusion of the vapors.\r\n\r\n\"This place differs, therefore, very materially from the famous Death\r\nValley of Java and similar places, in being simply a V-shaped trench,\r\nnot over seventy-five feet deep, cut in the mountain slope, and not a\r\nhollow or cave. That the gas at times accumulates in the pocket at the\r\nhead of the gulch is, however, proved by the dead squirrels, etc.,\r\nfound on its bottom. It is not probable, however, that the gas ever\r\naccumulates here to a considerable depth, owing to the open nature of\r\nthe place, and the fact that the gulch draining it would carry off the\r\ngas, which would, from its density, tend to flow down the ravine. This\r\noffers an explanation of the death of the bears, whose remains occur\r\nnot in this basin, but where it narrows to form the ravine, for it is\r\nhere that the layer of gas would be deepest, and has proved sufficient\r\nto suffocate the first bear, who was probably attracted by the remains\r\nof the elk, or perhaps of the smaller victims of the invisible gas;\r\nand he, in turn, has doubtless served as bait for others who have in\r\nturn succumbed. Though the gulch has doubtless served as a death-trap\r\nfor a very long period of time, these skeletons and bodies must be the\r\nremains of only the most recent victims, for the ravine is so narrow\r\nand the fall so great that the channel must be cleared out every few\r\nyears, if not annually. The change wrought by the water during a\r\nsingle rainstorm, which occurred in the interval between Mr. Weed's\r\nfirst and second visits, was so considerable that it seems probable\r\nthat the floods of early spring, when the snows are melting under the\r\nhot sun of this region, must be powerful enough to wash everything\r\ndown to the cone of _débris_ at the mouth of the gulch.\" Mr. Arnold\r\nHague, on the occasion of his visit, was more successful in obtaining\r\nevidence of the presence of carbonic-dioxide gas. He writes: \"The day\r\nI went up the ravine I was able in two places to extinguish a long\r\nbrown paper taper. The day I was there it was very calm, and where I\r\nmade the test the water was trickling down a narrow gorge shut in by\r\nshelving rocks above.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at noon on the 22d of July in the summer of 1897 that we made\r\ncamp near the mouth of Cache Creek, about three miles southeast of the\r\nmilitary post and mail station of Soda Butte. In company with Dr.\r\nFrancis P. King I at once started up the creek, keeping the left bank,\r\nthat we might not miss the gulch, which joins the valley of Cache\r\nCreek from the southern side. We had a toilsome climb through timber\r\nand over steep embankments, cut by the creek in a loose conglomerate,\r\nand after going about a mile and a half we noticed that some of these\r\nbanks were stained with whitish and yellow deposits of alum and\r\nsulphur, indicating that we were nearing the old hot-spring district.\r\nSoon a caved-in cone of travertine was seen, with crystalline calcite\r\nand sulphur in the cavities, and the bed of the creek was more or less\r\ncompletely whitened by these deposits, while here and there could be\r\nseen along the banks oozing \"paint-pots\" of calcareous mud, in one\r\ncase inky black, with deposits of varicolored salts about its rim, and\r\na steady ebullition of gas bubbles rising from the bottom. In other\r\ncases these pools were crystal clear, and always cold. The vegetation,\r\nwhich below had been dense close to the creek's bank, here became more\r\nscanty, especially on the southern side, where the bare rock was\r\nexposed and seen to be a volcanic breccia, much decomposed and stained\r\nwith solfataric deposits. A mound of coarse _débris_ seen just above\r\non this side indicated the presence of a lateral ravine, which from\r\nits situation and character we decided was probably the gulch sought\r\nfor. A strong odor of sulphureted hydrogen had been perceptible for\r\nsome time, and when we entered the gully the fumes became oppressive,\r\ncausing a heavy burning sensation in the throat and lungs. The ravine\r\nproved to be as described, a V-shaped trench cut in the volcanic rock,\r\nabout fifty feet in depth, with very steep bare whitish slopes,\r\nnarrowing to a stony rill bed that ascended steeply back into the\r\nmountain side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW, LOOKING DOWNSTREAM, OF LOWER PART OF\r\nDEATH GULCH.]\r\n\r\nClimbing through this trough, a frightfully weird and dismal place,\r\nutterly without life, and occupied by only a tiny streamlet and an\r\nappalling odor, we at length discovered some brown furry masses lying\r\nscattered about the floor of the ravine about a quarter of a mile from\r\nthe point where we had left Cache Creek. Approaching cautiously, it\r\nbecame quickly evident that we had before us a large group of huge\r\nrecumbent bears; the one nearest to us was lying with his nose between\r\nhis paws, facing us, and so exactly like a huge dog asleep that it did\r\nnot seem possible that it was the sleep of death. To make sure, I\r\nthrew a pebble at the animal, striking him on the flank; the distended\r\nskin resounded like a drumhead, and the only response was a belch of\r\npoisonous gas that almost overwhelmed us. Closer examination showed\r\nthat the animal was a young silver-tip grizzly (_Ursus horribilis_); a\r\nfew drops of thick, dark-red blood stained his nostrils and the ground\r\nbeneath. There proved to be five other carcasses, all bears, in\r\nvarious stages of decay; careful search revealed oval areas of hair\r\nand bones that represented two other bears, making a total of eight\r\ncarcasses in all. Seven were grizzlies, one was a cinnamon bear\r\n(_Ursus americanus_). One huge grizzly was so recent a victim that\r\nhis tracks were still visible in the white, earthy slopes, leading\r\ndown to the spot where he had met his death. In no case were any marks\r\nof violence seen, and there can be no question that death was\r\noccasioned by the gas. The wind was blowing directly up the ravine\r\nduring our visit, and we failed to get any test for carbonic acid,\r\nthough we exhausted all our matches in the effort, plunging the flames\r\ninto hollows of the rill bed in various parts of its course; they\r\ninvariably burned brightly, and showed not the slightest tendency to\r\nextinguish. The dilution of the gas in such a breeze would be\r\ninevitable, however; that the gas was present was attested by the\r\npeculiar oppression on the lungs that was felt during the entire\r\nperiod that we were in the gulch, and which only wore off gradually on\r\nour return to camp. I suffered from a slight headache in consequence\r\nfor several hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING DOWN THE GULCH--THE LATEST VICTIM, A LARGE\r\nSILVER-TIP GRIZZLY.]\r\n\r\nThere was no difference in the appearance of the portion of the gulch\r\nwhere the eight bears had met their end and the region above and\r\nbelow. A hundred yards or more up stream the solfataric deposits\r\nbecome less abundant, and the timber grows close to the brook; a short\r\ndistance beyond this the gulch ends. No bodies were found above, and\r\nonly bears were found in the locality described. It will be observed\r\nthat Weed's experience differs in this respect from ours, and the\r\nappearance of the place was somewhat different: he found elk and small\r\nanimals in addition to the bears, and describes the death-trap as\r\noccupying the mouth of the basin at the head of the gulch, above the\r\npoint where the last springs of acid water cease. The rill observed by\r\nus has its source far above the animals; indeed, it trickles directly\r\nthrough the worm-eaten carcass of the cinnamon bear--a thought by no\r\nmeans comforting when we realized that the water supply for our camp\r\nwas drawn from the creek only a short distance down the valley.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that there may be two or three of these gullies\r\nhaving similar properties. That we should have found only bears may\r\nperhaps be accounted for on the ground that the first victim for this\r\nseason was a bear, and his carcass frightened away all animals except\r\nthose of his own family. For an illustration of a process of\r\naccumulation of the bones of large vertebrates, with all the\r\nconditions present necessary for fossilization, no finer example can\r\nbe found in the world than Death Gulch; year after year the snow\r\nslides and spring floods wash down this fresh supply of entrapped\r\ncarcasses to be buried in the waste cones and alluvial bottoms of\r\nCache Creek and Lamar River. Probably the stream-formed conglomerate\r\nthat we noted as we ascended the creek is locally filled with these\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nThe gas is probably generated by the action of the acid water on the\r\nancient limestones that here underlie the lavas at no great depth;\r\noutcrops of these limestones occur only a few miles away at the mouth\r\nof Soda Butte Creek. This gas must emanate from fissures in the rock\r\njust above the bears, and on still nights it may accumulate to a depth\r\nof two or three feet in the ravine, settling in a heavy, wavy stratum,\r\nand probably rolling slowly down the bed of the rill into the valley\r\nbelow. The accompanying photographs were made during our visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR PROBLEM IN THE TROPICS.\r\n\r\nBY W. ALLEYNE IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great deal of space has been devoted in American magazines and\r\nnewspapers recently to the question of how this country has become a\r\ncolonial power. Destiny and duty, strength and weakness, accident and\r\ndesign, honesty and corruption have been called on by writers, singly\r\nand in various combinations, to bear the responsibility of the new\r\ndeparture in the national policy.\r\n\r\nWhatever interest such speculations may possess for the student who\r\nseeks to discover in the events of history some indication of the\r\nevolution of national character, there can be little doubt that the\r\neyes of the people at large are turned in another direction.\r\n\r\nWhat are our new possessions worth? is the question which intelligent\r\nmen of all classes are beginning to ask; and it is not surprising, in\r\nview of the comparative isolation of this country in the past, that\r\nthere are few who have sufficient confidence in their own opinion to\r\nanswer the query.\r\n\r\nIn England, whose colonial and Indian empire embraces nearly one\r\nfourth of the population of the globe, there is an astounding lack of\r\nknowledge in relation to colonial affairs; and those who follow the\r\ndebates in the House of Commons will have noticed that when the\r\ncolonies are the subject under discussion the few members who remain\r\nin their seats seldom fail to exhibit a degree of ignorance which must\r\nbe most disheartening to the able and learned Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, then, that in the United States, where\r\nthe people have been too much occupied with the problems continually\r\narising at home to pay any attention to affairs which, until very\r\nrecently, have appeared entirely outside the range of practical\r\npolitics, there should be few men who have given their time to that\r\ncareful study of tropical colonization which alone can impart any\r\nvalue to opinions in regard to the practical issues involved in the\r\ncolonial expansion of this country. Discussion of the subject has\r\nbeen almost entirely along the line of the possible effects of the new\r\npolicy on the political institutions and popular ideals of the United\r\nStates, and little has been written which may be said to throw any\r\nlight on the problem of tropical colonization _per se_.\r\n\r\nA residence of ten years in the tropical colonies of France, Spain,\r\nHolland, and Great Britain--a period during which I devoted much time\r\nto the study of colonial affairs--leaves me of opinion that there are\r\ntwo points in regard to which discussion is peculiarly opportune: 1.\r\nThe value of the Philippines and Puerto Rico as a field for the\r\ncultivation of those tropical products which are consumed in the\r\ntemperate zones. 2. The value of the islands as a market for products\r\nand manufactures of the temperate zones.\r\n\r\nIt will at once be seen that only in so far as the islands are\r\nvaluable in the former respect can they be important in the latter,\r\nfor in the absence of production there can not be any considerable\r\nconsumption of commodities.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be considered, and it is the one to which I shall\r\nconfine myself in the present article, is by what means the productive\r\npossibilities of Puerto Rico and the Philippines can be developed.\r\n\r\nBasing my calculation on official reports covering a number of years,\r\nI find that the average value _per capita_ of the annual exports of\r\nnative products from a number of tropical colonies selected by me for\r\nthe purpose of this inquiry is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Trinidad          $26.48\r\n  British Guiana     34.26\r\n  Martinique         23.48\r\n  Mauritius          20.28\r\n  Dominica            7.28\r\n  St. Vincent         7.68\r\n  Ceylon              7.24\r\n  Montserrat          7.89\r\n\r\nAn examination of these figures will serve to show that the value of\r\nthe colonies in the first column, measured by the standard of their\r\nproductiveness, is three times that of the colonies in the second\r\ncolumn. Reference to the population returns of the colonies named\r\ndiscloses the fact that in the colonies in the first column the\r\npopulation contains a very large proportion of imported contract\r\nlaborers and their descendants, while in the other colonies\r\npractically the whole population is home-born for at least two\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nA moment's reflection will show the importance of the comparison\r\ninstituted above, and if the space at my command permitted a more\r\nextensive analysis of the trade of tropical colonies, it could be\r\ndemonstrated that the theory holds good, almost without exception,\r\nthat of tropical countries those only are commercially valuable in\r\nwhich a system of imported contract labor is in force.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two colonies (Barbados is the most striking example)\r\nin which the pressure of population is so great that the labor supply\r\nsuffices for the utmost development of which the country is capable;\r\nbut such instances are rare.\r\n\r\nThe experience of England in governing tropical colonies is frequently\r\ncited by those who favor the so-called imperial policy for the United\r\nStates as a proof that tropical colonization in itself presents no\r\ndifficulties which can not be overcome by enlightened administration.\r\nIt would be difficult to point out in just what manner Great Britain\r\nderives any benefit from her tropical possessions, but her experience\r\nconfirms the theory I have stated above--that the commercial\r\ndevelopment of tropical colonies is possible only where there is an\r\nextraordinary density of population or where a system of imported\r\ncontract labor is in force.\r\n\r\nA glance through the list of Great Britain's tropical colonies will\r\nserve to prove the correctness of this theory. Imported contract labor\r\nis used in British Guiana, Trinidad, Jamaica, Queensland, the Fiji\r\nIslands, the Straits Settlements, and Mauritius; while the pressure of\r\npopulation is extreme in Lagos and Barbados, which support\r\nrespectively 1,333 and 1,120 persons to the square mile.\r\n\r\nThe remaining tropical colonies of Great Britain--using the term\r\n\"tropical colony\" in its strictest sense--are the Gold Coast, Sierra\r\nLeone, Gambia, Hongkong, St. Helena, British Honduras, Grenada, St.\r\nVincent, St. Lucia, Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis, Dominica, Montserrat,\r\nand a few islands in the Pacific which are insignificant commercially.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the British trade returns shows that the\r\ntotal export and import trade between the United Kingdom and all the\r\nBritish tropical colonies in 1896 reached a value of $146,000,000, and\r\nthat of this sum $121,000,000 represented trade with the tropical\r\ncolonies which employ imported contract labor and with Lagos and\r\nBarbados. In other words, the trade between the United Kingdom and\r\nthose British tropical colonies where free labor is used and where\r\nthere is no great pressure of population made up less than eighteen\r\nper cent of the total trade with the British tropical colonies.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the facts I have given that the commercial\r\ndevelopment of those parts of the tropics where the population is\r\nsparse will be dependent on the importation of labor from more densely\r\npeopled areas.\r\n\r\nIf the question is approached from an entirely different standpoint\r\nthe necessity of contract labor in the tropics becomes more strikingly\r\napparent. The development of the tropics will be in the direction of\r\nagriculture rather than manufacturing, and the requirements of\r\ntropical agriculture in respect of labor are most arbitrary. It is not\r\nsufficient that the labor supply is ample, in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe word; it must be at all times immediately available.\r\n\r\nThus, a mine owner whose men go out on strike is, briefly, placed in\r\nthis position: He will lose a sum of money somewhat larger than the\r\namount of profit he could have made during the period of the strike\r\nhad it not occurred. His coal, however, is still there, and is not\r\nless valuable--indeed, in the case of a prolonged strike, may actually\r\nbe more valuable--when the strike is over; work can easily be resumed\r\nwhere it was dropped, and during the idle days the ordinary running\r\nexpenses of the mine cease. The greater part of the loss sustained in\r\nthe instance I have supposed is not out-of-pocket loss, but merely the\r\nfailure to realize prospective profits.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a sugar estate in the tropics spends about eight\r\nmonths out of the twelve in cultivating the crop, and the remaining\r\nfour in reaping and boiling operations. By the time the crop is ready\r\nto reap many thousands of dollars have been expended on it by way of\r\nplanting, weeding, draining, and the application of nitrogenous\r\nmanures. If from any cause the labor supply fails when the cutting of\r\nthe canes is about to commence, every cent expended on the crop is\r\nwasted; and if for want of labor the canes which are cut are not\r\ntransported within a few hours to the mills, they turn sour and can\r\nnot be made into sugar. It will thus be seen that in the case of\r\nsugar-growing a perfectly reliable labor supply is the first\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\nThe same might be said of the cultivation of tea, coffee, cocoa,\r\nspices, and tropical fruits.\r\n\r\nThis problem--the securing of a reliable labor supply--has been solved\r\nin the case of several of the tropical possessions of England by the\r\nimportation of East Indian laborers under contract to serve for a\r\nfixed period on the plantations.\r\n\r\nAs, in my opinion, the East Indian contract laborer will play an\r\nimportant part in the development of the tropics, I describe in detail\r\nthe most perfect system of contract labor with which I am acquainted,\r\nthat existing at the present time in the colony of British Guiana. The\r\nsystem of imported indentured labor which is in force in many of the\r\nBritish colonies has been referred to frequently, both in this country\r\nand in England, as \"slavery,\" \"semislavery,\" \"the new slavery.\" The\r\nuse of such terms to describe such a system indicates a complete\r\nignorance of the facts. As some of the best-informed journals in this\r\ncountry, in noticing my writings on tropical subjects, have fallen\r\ninto this error, I hope that the description I give here, which is\r\nbased on several years' experience of the actual working of the\r\nsystem, will serve to convince the readers of this article that the\r\nindenture of the East Indian coolie in the British colonies is no more\r\na form of slavery than is any contract entered into between an\r\nemployer and an employee in this country.\r\n\r\nWhen the British Guiana planter was informed by the home Government\r\nin 1834 that four years later slavery would be entirely abolished\r\nthroughout the British Empire, he foresaw at once that unless a new\r\nsource of labor was thrown open a very short time would elapse before\r\nthe cane fields would fall out of cultivation. He listened, not\r\nwithout some irritation, to the assurances of the agents of the\r\nAntislavery Society that as soon as the slaves were freed they would\r\nwork with redoubled energy, and that the labor supply, instead of\r\ndeteriorating, would, in fact, improve. The planters knew better, and\r\nbegan at once to arrange for the importation of contract labor. With\r\nthe year 1834 began the period of apprenticeship for the slaves, prior\r\nto their complete emancipation four years later.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, and before the imported labor sufficed for the needs\r\nof the plantations, several estates were ruined and fell out of\r\ncultivation because the apprenticed laborers would not work.\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 1838, the governor of the colony, Henry Light, Esquire,\r\nissued a proclamation to the freed slaves. The proclamation stated\r\nthat the governor had learned with regret that the labor of the freed\r\nslaves was irregular; that their masters could not depend on them;\r\nthat they worked one day and idled the next; that when they had earned\r\nenough to fill their bellies they lay down to sleep or idled away\r\ntheir time; that they left their tasks unfinished, and then expected\r\nto be paid in full for them.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the planters imported labor from the West Indian\r\nIslands, Malta, Madeira, China, and Germany; and eventually the system\r\nof immigration from India was organized.\r\n\r\nThe system is under the control of the Indian Council in Calcutta on\r\nthe one hand and the British Guiana Government and the Colonial Office\r\non the other. In Georgetown, the capital of the colony, is the\r\nimmigration department, under the management of the immigration agent\r\ngeneral, who has under him a staff of inspectors, subagents, clerks,\r\nand interpreters, all of whom must speak at least one Indian dialect.\r\nIn Calcutta resides the emigration agent general, also an official of\r\nthe British Guiana Government, who has under him a staff of medical\r\nofficers, recruiting agents, and clerks.\r\n\r\nEach year the planters of British Guiana send in requisitions to the\r\nimmigration department stating the number of immigrants required for\r\nthe following year. These requisitions are examined by the agent\r\ngeneral, and if, in his opinion, any estate demands more coolies than\r\nthe extent of its cultivation justifies, the number is reduced. As\r\nsoon as the full number is decided on, the agent in Calcutta is\r\ninformed, and the process of recruiting commences. The laborers are\r\nsecured entirely by voluntary enlistment. The recruiting agents go\r\nabout the country and explain the terms offered by the British Guiana\r\nplanters, and those men and women who express their willingness to\r\nenter into a contract are sent down to Calcutta at the expense of the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nOn arrival in Calcutta they are provided with free food and quarters\r\nat the emigration depot until such time as a sufficient number are\r\nassembled to form a full passenger list for a transport. During the\r\nperiod of waiting, which may extend to several weeks, a careful\r\nmedical inspection of the laborers is made, and all those who may be\r\ndeemed unfit for the work of the estates are sent back to their homes\r\nat the expense of the colony. Prior to embarkation the coolies are\r\ncalled up in batches of fifteen or twenty, and the emigration agent or\r\na local magistrate reads over to them in their own language the terms\r\nof the indenture. Each one is then given an indenture ticket on which\r\nthe terms of indenture are printed in three dialects. The agent\r\ngeneral affixes his signature to each ticket; and a special provision\r\nin the laws of British Guiana makes his signature binding on the\r\nplanters who employ the coolies. The ticket thus constitutes a\r\ncontract valid as against either party in the courts of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe coolies have the right to carry with them any children they may\r\nwish, and those under twelve years of age are exempt from indenture.\r\nThe transportation is effected in sailing vessels, which are for the\r\ntime being Government transports. The reason why steamers are not\r\nemployed is that sailing vessels are found to be much healthier, and\r\nthat the long sea voyage has an excellent effect on the immigrants.\r\nThe regulations governing the voyage are very strict. As far as the\r\ncoolies are concerned, the ship is in charge of a medical officer. The\r\ncaptain of the ship, the officers, and the crew are all under the\r\ncommand of the doctor, except in so far as the actual sailing of the\r\nvessel is in question. The vessel has ample hospital accommodation, a\r\ncomplete dispensary in charge of a qualified dispenser, and all the\r\narrangements must be passed by a Government inspector before the ship\r\nis given her clearance. The food to be furnished during the voyage is\r\nspecified by law. The bill of fare consists chiefly of bread, butter,\r\nrice, curry, sago, condensed milk, and fresh mutton, a number of sheep\r\nbeing carried on the ship.\r\n\r\nEvery morning and evening the doctor makes an inspection of the\r\nvessel, and enters in his log-book all essential details, such as\r\nbirths, deaths, cases treated in the hospital, and so forth.\r\n\r\nOn arrival in the colony the coolies are allotted to the different\r\nestates. The coolie is bound to remain for five years on the\r\nplantation to which he is allotted, and to work during that time five\r\ndays a week, the day's work being seven hours. In return for this the\r\nplanter must furnish him with a house free of rent, and built in such\r\na way as to meet the requirements of the inspector of immigrants'\r\ndwellings in regard to ventilation, size, and water supply; and no\r\nimmigrants are sent to any estate until these houses have been\r\ninspected and passed as satisfactory. The planter must also furnish on\r\nthe estate free hospital accommodation and medical attendance, and in\r\naddition provide free education for the children of indentured\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nThe medical officers are Government servants, and the colony is\r\ndivided into districts, each of which has its own doctor, who is\r\ncompelled by law to visit each estate in his district at least once in\r\nforty-eight hours and examine and prescribe for all immigrants\r\npresenting themselves at the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe planter is further bound to pay a minimum daily wage of\r\ntwenty-four cents to each man and sixteen cents to each woman. This\r\nappears at first sight a very small sum, but when it is taken into\r\naccount that a coolie can live well on eight cents a day it will be\r\nseen that the wage is three times the living expense, a rate very\r\nrarely paid to agricultural laborers in any part of the world.\r\n\r\nThat the coolies do, in fact, save considerable sums of money will be\r\nseen when the statistics of the immigration department are examined.\r\nThese records show that during the years 1870 to 1896 38,793\r\nimmigrants returned to India after completing their terms of\r\nindenture, and that they carried back with them to their native land\r\nover $2,800,000. At the end of 1896 there were over five thousand East\r\nIndian depositors in the British Guiana Government Savings Bank and\r\nthe Post-Office Savings Bank, with a total sum of more than $450,000\r\nto their credit.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five years the indentured coolie becomes absolutely\r\nfree. He may cease work, or, if he prefer it, remain on the estates as\r\na free laborer. The whole colony is open to him, and he may engage in\r\nany trade or profession for which he may be fitted. If he remains for\r\nfive years longer in the colony, even though he be idle during the\r\nwhole of that time, he becomes entitled to a grant of land from the\r\nGovernment. The law in this respect has been recently changed. All\r\ncoolies who came to the colony prior to 1898 have the choice at the\r\nend of ten years of a free grant of land or an assisted passage back\r\nto their native place.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected by those persons who are unacquainted with the\r\nsystem that all this sounds very well on paper, but that the\r\nopportunities for fraud and oppression must be very frequent, and,\r\nhuman nature being what it is, very frequently taken advantage of, to\r\nthe injury of the coolies' interests. Such charges have, in fact, been\r\nmade from time to time, but they have, on investigation, proved to be\r\nunfounded, or, at the worst, highly exaggerated. The treatment of the\r\nindentured immigrants in British Guiana was the subject of a Royal\r\ncommission of inquiry in 1870. The appointment of the commission\r\nfollowed a series of charges made by a certain Mr. Des Voeux, a\r\nmagistrate in the colony, in a letter to Earl Granville, at that time\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies.\r\n\r\nThe commission visited the colony and conducted a most searching\r\ninquiry. Hundreds of witnesses were examined, and the commissioners\r\nvisited several estates, without giving any warning of their\r\nintentions, and questioned many of the coolies as to their treatment.\r\nMr. Des Voeux entirely failed to substantiate his charges; and Sir\r\nClinton Murdoch, the chairman of the emigration board--a permanent\r\ndepartment of the Colonial Office--in referring to the report of the\r\ncommission in a blue book issued in 1872, said: \"It may, I think, be\r\nconsidered that the report of the commissioners is generally\r\nsatisfactory, both as regards the magistracy, the planters, and the\r\nimmigrants. Many defects in the system and mode of working it are no\r\ndoubt pointed out, but they are defects caused by errors of judgment,\r\nby insufficiency of the law, or by want of foresight, not by\r\nintentional neglect or indifference to the well-being of the people,\r\nstill less by oppression or cruelty. The vindication of the magistracy\r\nand of the medical officers appears to be complete, and the fair\r\ndealing and kindness of the managers toward the immigrants is\r\nacknowledged.\"\r\n\r\nThe laws have been amended, the Government inspection has been made\r\nmore complete, and to-day it is impossible that any abuse of power on\r\nthe part of the planters can pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nTo give an instance of the effectiveness of the Government\r\nsupervision--each estate is compelled by law to keep pay lists\r\naccording to a form specified by the immigration department, in which\r\nthe name of each indentured immigrant must be entered with a record of\r\neach separate day's work during the five years of the indenture. Thus,\r\nif the pay list shows that in a certain week a man worked only two\r\ndays out of the legal five, it must also show the reason why he did\r\nnot work on the other three days. It may have been that the man was in\r\nthe hospital, in which case the letter \"H\" must appear opposite his\r\nname for those days; or he may have been granted leave of absence,\r\nwhen the letter \"L\" would account for him. These pay lists are\r\ninspected by a Government officer twice a month, and any faults\r\ndisclosed by the examination become the subject of a severe reprimand\r\nfrom the agent general, followed in the case of persistent neglect by\r\nthe cutting off of the supply of coolies.\r\n\r\nSo minute are the records of the immigration department that were an\r\napplication made to the agent general for information regarding some\r\nparticular indentured coolie, that official could without difficulty\r\nsupply the name of the man's father and mother, his caste, age,\r\nnative place, with the same information in regard to the man's wife.\r\nHe could also make out an account showing every day the man had worked\r\nduring the term of his indenture, and the reasons why he had not\r\nworked on the other days, with the exact amount earned on each working\r\nday. In addition to this he could state how many days the man had\r\nspent in the estate's hospital and what was the matter with him on\r\nthose occasions, besides furnishing a copy of every prescription made\r\nup for the man in the estate's dispensary.\r\n\r\nA striking evidence of the desire of the Government to protect the\r\ncoolies from ill treatment of any kind is afforded by the rule of the\r\nimmigration department that, if any overseer on an estate is convicted\r\nof an offense against an indentured immigrant, the dismissal of the\r\noffender is demanded, and each estate in the colony is warned that if\r\nit employ the man the supply of immigrants will be cut off.\r\n\r\nThe coolies are given every facility to complain of ill-treatment or\r\nbreach of contract on the part of the planters, for, in addition to\r\nthe opportunity afforded by the regular visits of the subagents, the\r\nright is secured to them by law of leaving any estate without\r\npermission in order to visit the agent general or the nearest\r\nmagistrate; and either of these officials has the power to issue all\r\nprocess of law free of cost to any coolie who satisfies him that there\r\nis a _prima facie_ cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, are the features of the East Indian immigration system\r\nof British Guiana.[12]\r\n\r\nThose who approach the question of the labor supply for the American\r\ncolonies with an unprejudiced mind will see that there is nothing in\r\nthe system I have described which is at variance with the principles\r\nof the American people.\r\n\r\nAll that is required to make such a system a boon both to the employer\r\nand to the laborer is that the officials charged with the inspection\r\nof the system and the protection of the immigrants' interests should\r\nbe intelligent, honest, and fearless in the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[12] To those who are interested in the subject of indentured labor in\r\nthe tropics, the following statistics, compiled by me from official\r\nsources, may be of interest.

DAVID A. WELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--THE LAW OF THE DIFFUSION OF TAXES.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nAttention is next asked to an analysis of the incidence of taxation,\r\nwhat is mainly direct, on processes and products, and on the machinery\r\nby which one is effected and the other distributed, and at the outset\r\nthe following propositions in the nature of economic axioms are\r\nsubmitted, which it is believed will serve as stepping stones to the\r\nattainment of broad generalizations.\r\n\r\nThus, property is solely produced to supply human wants and desires;\r\nand taxes form an important part of the cost of all production,\r\ndistribution, and consumption, and represent the labor performed in\r\nguarding and protecting property at the expense of the State, in all\r\nthe processes of development and transformation. The State is thus an\r\nactive and important partner in all production. Without its assistance\r\nand protection, production would be impeded or wholly arrested. The\r\nsoldier or policeman guards, while the citizen performs his labor in\r\nsafety. As a partner in all the forms of production and business, the\r\nState must pay its expenses--i.e., its agents, for their services; and\r\nits only means of paying are through its receipts from taxation.\r\nTaxes, then, are clearly items of expense in all business, the same as\r\nrent, fuel, cost of material, light, labor, waste, insurance, clerical\r\nservice, advertising, expressage, freight, and the like, and on\r\nbusiness principles they find their place on the pages of profit and\r\nloss; and, like all other expenses which enter into the cost of\r\nproduction, must finally be sustained by those who gratify their wants\r\nor desires by consumption. Production is only a means, and consumption\r\nis the end, and the consumer must pay in the end all the expenses of\r\nproduction. Every dealer in domestic or imported merchandise keeps on\r\nhand, at all times, upon his shelves, a stock of different and\r\naccumulated taxes--customs, internal revenue, State, school, and\r\nmunicipal--with his goods; and when we buy and carry away from any\r\nstore or shop an article, we buy and carry away with it the\r\naccompanying and inherential taxes.\r\n\r\nAny primary taxpayer, who does not ultimately consume the thing taxed,\r\nand who does not include the tax in the price of the taxed property or\r\nits products, must literally throw away his money and must soon become\r\nbankrupt and disappear as a competitor; and accordingly the tax\r\nadvancer will add the tax in his prices if he understands simple\r\naddition. How rapidly bankruptcy would befall dealers in imported\r\ngoods, wares, and merchandise in the United States who did not\r\nstrictly observe this rule will be realized when one remembers that\r\nthe average tax imposed by its Government (in 1896) on all dutiable\r\nimports is in excess of fifty per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Franklin was asked by a committee of the English House of\r\nCommons, prior to the American Revolution, if the province of\r\nPennsylvania did not practically relieve farmers and other landowners\r\nfrom taxation, and at the same time impose a heavy tax on merchants,\r\nto the injury of British trade, he answered that \"if such special tax\r\nwas imposed, the merchants were experts with their pens, and added the\r\ntax to the price of their goods, and thus made the farmers and all\r\nlandowners pay their part of the tax as consumers.\"\r\n\r\nTaxes uniformly levied on all the subjects of taxation, and which are\r\nnot so excessive as to become a prohibition on the use of the thing\r\ntaxed, become, therefore, a part of the cost of all production,\r\ndistribution, and consumption, and diffuse and equate themselves by\r\nnatural laws in the same manner and in the same minute degree as all\r\nother elements that constitute the expenses of production. We produce\r\nto consume and consume to produce, and the cost of consumption,\r\nincluding taxes, enters into the cost of production, and the cost of\r\nproduction, including taxes, enters into the cost of consumption, and\r\nthus taxes levied uniformly on things of the same class, by the laws\r\nof competition, supply, and demand, and the all-pervading mediums of\r\nlabor, will be distributed, percussed, and repercussed to a remote\r\ndegree, until they finally fall upon every person, not in proportion\r\nto his consumption of a given article, but in the proportion his\r\nconsumption bears to the aggregate consumption of the taxed community.\r\n\r\nA great capitalist, like Mr. Astor, bears no greater burden of\r\ntaxation (and can not be made to bear more by any laws that can be\r\nproperly termed tax laws) than the proportion which his aggregate\r\nindividual consumption bears to the aggregate individual consumption\r\nof all others in his circuit of immediate competition; and as to his\r\nother taxes, he is a mere tax collector, or conduit, conducting taxes\r\nfrom his tenants or borrowers to the State or city treasury. A whisky\r\ndistiller is a tax conduit, or tax collector, and sells more taxes\r\nthan the original cost of whisky, as finds proof and illustration in\r\nthe fact that the United States imposes a tax of one dollar and ten\r\ncents per gallon on proof whisky which its manufacturer would be very\r\nglad to sell free of tax for an average of thirteen cents per gallon.\r\nThe tax, furthermore, is required to be laid before the whisky can be\r\nremoved from the distillery or bonded warehouse and allowed to become\r\nan article of merchandise. Tobacco in like manner can not go into\r\nconsumption till the tax is paid. In Great Britain, where all tobacco\r\nconsumed is imported, for every 3_d._ paid by the consumer, 2.5_d._\r\nrepresents customs duties or taxes. In Russia it is estimated that the\r\nGovernment annually requires of its peasant producers one third the\r\nmarket value of their entire crop of cereals in payment of their\r\ntaxes, and fixes the time of collecting the same in the autumn, when\r\nthe peasant sells sufficient of his grain (mainly for exportation),\r\nand with the purchase money meets the demands of the tax collector.\r\nCan it be doubted that the sums thus extorted enter into and form an\r\nessential part of the cost of the entire crop or product of the land?\r\nIt is, therefore, immaterial where the process of manufacture takes\r\nplace; the citizens of a State pay in proportion to the quantity which\r\nthey consume. The traveler who stops at one of the great city hotels\r\ncan not avoid reimbursing the owner for the tax he primarily pays on\r\nthe property; and the owner, in respect to the taxation of his hotel\r\nproperty, is but a great and effective real-estate and diffused tax\r\ncollector. Again, the farmer charges taxes in the price of his\r\nproducts; the laborer, in his wages; the clergyman, in his salary; the\r\nlender, in the interest he receives; the lawyer, in his fees; and the\r\nmanufacturer, in his goods.\r\n\r\nThe American Bible Society is always in part loaded with the whisky\r\nand tobacco taxes paid by the printers, paper-makers, and\r\nbook-binders, or by the producers of articles consumed by these\r\nmechanics, and reflected and embodied in their wages and the products\r\nof their labor according to the degree of absence of competition from\r\nfellow-mechanics who abstain from the use of these and other taxed\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions respecting the diffusion of taxes may be said to be\r\nuniversally accepted by economists so far as they relate to the\r\nresults of production before they reach the hands of the final\r\nconsumers; but they are not accepted by many, as Mr. Henry George has\r\nrecently expressed it, in respect to taxes on special profits or\r\nadvantages on things of which the supply is strictly limited, or of\r\nwealth in the hands of final consumers, or in the course of\r\ndistribution by gift, and finally in respect to taxes on land. But a\r\nlittle examination would seem to show that all of these exceptions are\r\nof the kind that are said to prove the rule. _Special profits_ and\r\nadvantages in this age of quick diffusion of knowledge and intense\r\ncompetition are exceedingly ephemeral, and are mainly confined to\r\nresults which the State with a view of encouraging removes for a\r\nlimited time from the natural laws of competition by granting patents,\r\ncopyrights, and franchises. Of things which are strictly limited in\r\nrespect to supply, what and where are they? Only a very few can be\r\nspecified: ivory, Peruvian guano, whalebone, ambergris, and the pelts\r\nof the fur seal. Of wealth in the process of transmission, or in the\r\nhands of final consumers, it is not _tangible_ wealth unless it is\r\n_tangible_ property, which conforms under any correct system of\r\ntaxation to the principles of taxation; and if any one advocates the\r\ntaxation of the right to receive property which has already been\r\ntaxed, he in effect advocates a double exaction of one and the same\r\nthing. If it be asked, Will an income tax on a person retired from\r\nbusiness be diffused? the answer, beyond question, must be in the\r\naffirmative, if the tax is uniform on all persons and on all amounts,\r\nand is absolutely collected in minute sums. Would any one pay the same\r\nprice for a railroad bond which is subject to an income tax as he\r\nwould for it if it was free from tax? If one's land is taxed, either\r\nin the form of rent or income, will not the tenant have the burden\r\nprimarily thrown upon him? And, finally, will not the consumer of the\r\ntenant's goods pay through or by reason of such consumption?\r\n\r\nRespecting the incidence of the tax on mortgages, it does not make any\r\ndifference how mortgages are taxed--no earthly power can make the\r\nlender pay it. If the borrower would not agree to pay the tax, the\r\nlender would not loan him money, and whenever possible loans would be\r\nforeclosed and payment insisted upon if the borrower should refuse to\r\npay the tax.\r\n\r\nLet us next subject to analysis the incidence of the so-called\r\ntaxation of land. Considered _per se_ (or in itself), land, in common\r\nwith unappropriated air and water, has no value; and it can not in any\r\nstrict sense be affirmed that we tax land; and when such affirmation\r\nis made, its only legitimate and justifiable meaning is that we tax\r\nthe value of land; which value is due entirely to the amount of\r\npersonal property (in the sense of embodied labor) expended upon it,\r\nand the pressure or demand of such property or labor to use, possess,\r\nand occupy it.\r\n\r\nVattel, in his Law of Nations, enunciates as a self-evident and\r\nirrefutable proposition that \"Nature has not herself established\r\nproperty, and in particular with regard to lands. She only approves\r\nthis introduction for the advantage of the human race.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking examples of evidence in illustration and\r\nproof of this proposition is to be found in an incident, which has\r\nheretofore escaped attention, which occurred during a debate in the\r\nSenate of the United States in 1890 on a bill for revision of duties\r\non imports, in respect to the article borax (borate of soda). Formerly\r\nthe world's supply of this mineral substance, which enters largely\r\ninto industrial processes and medicine, was limited, and mainly\r\nderived from certain hot springs in Tuscany, Italy; but within a\r\ncomparatively recent period it has been found that it exists in such\r\nabundance in certain of the desert regions of California, Nevada, and\r\nArizona, that it can be gathered with the minimum of labor from the\r\nvery surface of the ground. Were a single acre of similar desert to be\r\nfound in any section of a country enjoying the most ordinary\r\nprivileges in respect to transportation and water supply, it would be\r\na source of wealth to its proprietor. But under existing\r\ncircumstances, although thousands and thousands of acres of this land\r\ncan be bought with certain title from its owner--the Federal\r\nGovernment--for two dollars and twenty-five cents an acre, no one\r\nwants it at any price; and the prospective demand for it has not yet\r\nbeen sufficient to warrant the Government in instituting even a survey\r\nas a preliminary to effecting a sale. In the Senate debate above\r\nalluded to it was proposed to increase the duty on imported borax,\r\nwith the expectation that a consequent increase in its domestic price\r\nwould afford sufficient profit to induce such construction of roads\r\nand such a supply of water and labor on the borax tracts of the\r\ndeserts as to enable them to become property.[13]\r\n\r\nIn the oases of the deserts of North Africa and Egypt the value of a\r\ntract of land depends very little upon its size or location, but\r\nalmost exclusively upon the number of the date-bearing palms, the\r\nresult of labor, growing upon it, and the quality of their fruit. John\r\nBright on one occasion stated that if the land of Ireland were\r\nstripped of the improvements made upon it by the labor of the\r\noccupier, the face of the country would be \"as bare and naked as an\r\nAmerican prairie.\"\r\n\r\nAn exact parallel to this state of things is afforded in the case of\r\nlands of no value reclaimed from the sea and made valuable, as has\r\nbeen often done in England, Holland, and other countries, by embodying\r\nlabor upon them in the shape of restraining embankments and the\r\ntransportation and use of filling material. Again, the value of\r\nsprings or running streams of water is generally limited and of little\r\naccount. But when, through direct labor, or the results of labor, the\r\nwater is collected in reservoirs and made the instrumentality of\r\nimparting power to machinery, or conducted through conduits to centers\r\nof population which otherwise could not obtain it, it becomes\r\nextremely valuable, and capable of being sold in large or small\r\nquantities. Another similar illustration is to be found in the case of\r\natmospheric air, which in its natural and ordinary state has no\r\nmarketable value, but when compressed by labor embodied in the form of\r\nmachinery and made capable of transmitting force, it at once becomes\r\nendowed with value and can be sold at a high price.\r\n\r\nAn opinion entertained and strongly advocated by not a few economic\r\nwriters and teachers of repute (more especially in Europe, but not in\r\nthe United States)[14] is, that taxes on land do not diffuse\r\nthemselves, but fall wholly on the landowner, and that there is no way\r\nin which he can throw it off and cause any considerable part of them\r\nto be paid by anybody else. The concrete argument in support of this\r\nopinion has been thus stated: \"When land is taxed, the owner can not,\r\nas a general rule, escape the tax, for the reason that, to get rid of\r\nthe tax, the price of the land or of the rent must be raised the full\r\namount of the tax, and the only way in which this can be done is by\r\nreducing the supply or quantity offered in market, or else by\r\nincreasing the demand. The supply of land can not be reduced, and the\r\ndemand being created by capital and population, both of which are\r\nbeyond the control of the landowner, he can do nothing to raise the\r\nprice of land, and hence can not get rid of the tax. It may be stated,\r\nthen, as a general rule, that a tax on land, or on any commodity the\r\nsupply of which is limited absolutely, must be paid by the owner. It\r\nis possible to suggest cases in which, through combination of owners\r\nand the necessities of consumers, a demand may be created strong\r\nenough to raise the price to the full amount of such tax, but it is\r\ndoubted if such cases ever really occur.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe source of the contention on this important economic and social\r\nquestion, and the difficulty in the way of the attainment of\r\nharmonious conclusions, is due to a nonrecognition of the fact that\r\nland is taxed under two conditions, and can not be taxed otherwise.\r\nThus, if a person holds land for his exclusive use or enjoyment, and\r\nconsumes all of its product, a tax on such land, which has been\r\ncharacterized by some economists as its \"pure rent,\" will not diffuse\r\nitself, because it is a tax on personal enjoyment or final\r\nconsumption. The same is the case when a portion of a river or lake or\r\nits shore is rented for fishing for the purposes of sport. A like\r\nresult will also follow, in a greater or less degree, from the\r\ninability or unwillingness of tenants, as has been often the case in\r\nIreland, to pay rent sufficient to reimburse the landowner for\r\ninterest on his investment of capital and cost of repairs. But if one\r\nemploys land as an instrumentality for acquiring gain through its\r\nuses, the taxation of land must include the taxation of its uses--its\r\ncontents, all that rests upon it, all that is produced, sold,\r\nexpended, manufactured, or transported on it--and all such taxes will\r\ndiffuse themselves. On the other hand, if the taxation of land under\r\nsuch circumstances and conditions does not diffuse itself, then the\r\ntaking is simply a process of confiscation, which if continued will\r\nultimately rob the owner of his property, and is not governed by any\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed difficult to see how a theory so wholly inapplicable to\r\nfact and experience as that of the nondiffusion of taxes on\r\nland--which makes property in land an exception to the rule\r\nacknowledged to be applicable to all other property--could originate\r\nand be strenuously maintained to the extent even of stigmatizing any\r\nopposite view \"as so very superficial as scarcely to deserve a\r\nrefutation.\"[16] No little of confusion and controversy on this\r\nsubject has arisen from the assumption that land specifically, and the\r\nrent of land, constitute two distinct and legitimate subjects for\r\ntaxation, when the fact is just the contrary. The rent of land is in\r\nthe nature of an income to its owner; and it is an economic axiom that\r\nwhen a government taxes the income of property it in reality taxes the\r\nproperty itself. In England and on the continent of Europe land is\r\ngenerally taxed on its yearly income or income value, and these taxes\r\nare always considered as land taxes. Alexander Hamilton, in discussing\r\nthe taxation of incomes derived directly from property, used this\r\nlanguage: \"What, in fact, is property but a fiction, without the\r\nbeneficial use of it? In many instances, indeed, the income is the\r\nproperty itself.\" The United States Supreme Court, in its recent\r\ndecision of the income tax (1895), also practically indorsed this\r\nconclusion. To levy taxes on the rent of land and also upon the land\r\nitself is, therefore, double taxation on one and the same property,\r\nwhich in common with all other unequal and unjust taxes can not be\r\ndiffused; and for this reason should be regarded as in the nature of\r\nexactions or confiscation, concerning the incidence of which nothing\r\ncan be safely predicated. In short, this whole discussion, and the\r\nunwarranted assumption involved in it and largely accepted, is an\r\nillustration of what may be regarded as a maxim, that the greatest\r\nerrors in political economy have arisen from overlooking the most\r\nobvious facts or deductions from experience.\r\n\r\nWith a purpose of further elucidating this problem, attention is asked\r\nfirst to its consideration from an \"abstract,\" and next from a\r\npractical standpoint of view. Let us endeavor to clearly understand\r\nthe common meaning of the word \"_rent_.\" It is derived from the Latin\r\n_reddita_, \"things given back or paid,\" and in plain English is a word\r\nfor price or hire. It may be the hire of anything. It is the price we\r\npay for the right of exclusive use over something which is not our\r\nown. Thus we speak of the rent of land, of buildings and apartments,\r\nof a fishery, of boats, of water, of an opera box, of a piano, sewing\r\nmachines, furniture, vehicles, and the like. In Scotland at the\r\npresent time farmers hire cows to dairymen, who pay an agreed-upon\r\nprice by the year or for a term of years for each cow, and reimburse\r\nthemselves for such payment and make a profit on the transaction by\r\nthe sale of the products of the animal. This hire is called a rent,\r\nand is clearly the same in kind as the rent of land. We do not apply\r\nthe word \"hire\" to the employment of men, because we have a separate\r\nword--\"wages\"--for that particular case of hire. Neither do we apply\r\nthe word \"rent\" in English to the hire of money, because we have\r\nanother separate word--\"interest\"--which has come into special use for\r\nthe price paid for the loan or hire of money. But in the French\r\nlanguage the word _rent_ is habitually and specially used to signify\r\nthe price of the hire money, and that of \"_rentes_\" to investments of\r\nmoney paying interest; the French national debt being always spoken of\r\nas \"_les rentes_\"; while the men who live on the lending of money, or\r\ncapital in any form, are called \"_rentiers_.\"\r\n\r\nThe question next naturally arises, Why is it necessary to set up any\r\nspecial theory at all about the natural disposition of the price which\r\nwe pay for the hire of land, any more than about the price we pay for\r\nthe hire of a house, of furniture, of a boat, of an opera box, or of a\r\ncow? The particular kind of use to which we put each of these various\r\nthings is no doubt very different from the kind of use to which we put\r\neach or all the others. But all of these uses resolve themselves into\r\nthe desire we have to derive some pleasure or some profit by the\r\npossession for a time of the right of exclusive use of something which\r\nis not our own, and for which we must pay the price, not of purchase,\r\nbut of hire.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this curious economic phenomenon is to be found in\r\nthe assumption and positive assertion on the part of not a few\r\ndistinguished economists that the truly scientific and only correct\r\nuse of the term \"rent\" is its application to the \"income derived from\r\nthings of all kinds of which the supply is limited, and can not be\r\nincreased by man's action.\"[17] As a rule, economists who accept this\r\ndefinition confine its application to the hire of land alone, although\r\nit professes to include other things, \"of all kinds,\" to which the\r\nsame description applies--namely, that they can not be increased in\r\nquantity by any human action. There are, however, no such other things\r\nspecified, and in any literal sense there are no such other things\r\nexisting, unless water and the atmosphere be intended.\r\n\r\nNow, although it is indisputably true that man by his action can not\r\nincrease the absolute or total quantity of land, any more than of\r\nwater and air, appertaining to the whole globe on which we live, there\r\nis practically no limitation to the degree of value which man's action\r\ncan impart to land, and which is the only thing for which land is\r\nwanted, bought, or sold, and which, as already shown, can be truly\r\nmade the subject of taxation. The tracts of land on the earth's\r\nsurface which are of no present marketable value are its deserts, its\r\nwildernesses, the sides and summits of its mountains, and its\r\ncontinually frozen zones, where no results of labor are embodied in or\r\nreflected upon it; while, on the other hand, its tracts of greatest\r\nvalue are in the large cities and marts of trade and commerce, as in\r\nthe vicinity of the Bank of England, or in Wall Street, where the\r\nresults of labor are so concentrated and reflected upon land that it\r\nis necessary to cover it with gold in order to acquire by purchase a\r\ntitle to it and a right to its exclusive use. The difference between\r\nland at twenty-five dollars an acre and twenty-five dollars a square\r\nfoot is simply that the latter is or may be in the near future covered\r\nor surrounded by capital and business, while the former is remote from\r\nthese sources of value. One of the greatest possible, perhaps\r\nprobable, outcomes of the modern progress of chemistry is that through\r\nthe utilization of microbic organizations the value of land as an\r\ninstrumentality for the production of food may be increased to an\r\nextent that at the present time is hardly possible of conception.\r\nAgain, in the case of air and water, although their total absolute\r\nquantity can not be increased, their available and useful quantity in\r\nany place, as before shown, can be by the agency of man, and their use\r\nmade subject to hire or rent.\r\n\r\nConsideration is next asked to the question at issue from what may be\r\ntermed its practical standpoint. We have first a proposition in the\r\nnature of an economic axiom, that the price of everything necessary\r\nfor production, or the hire of anything--land, money, and the\r\nlike--without which the product could not arise, is, and must be,\r\nwithout exception, a part of the cost of that product; second, that\r\nall levies of the State which are worthy of being designated as taxes\r\nconstitute an essential element of the cost of all products. The rent\r\nof an opera box, given to obtain a mere pleasure, constitutes a part\r\nof the fund out of which the musicians are paid, and if they are not\r\nso paid they will not play or sing. The rent given for the right to\r\nfish on a certain part of a river or its shores is a part of the cost\r\nof producing the fish as a marketable commodity. If a house is hired\r\nfor the purpose of conducting any business in it, the price of that\r\nhire does most certainly enter into the cost of that business,\r\nwhatever it may be, assuming that the use of the house is a necessity\r\nfor carrying it on. As no man will produce a commodity by which he is\r\nsure to lose money, or fail to obtain the ordinary rate of profit, the\r\ntax must be added to the price, or the production will cease. If a\r\nuniform tax is imposed on all land occupied, it will be paid by the\r\noccupier, because occupation (house-building) will cease until the\r\nrent rises sufficiently to cover the tax. The landlord assesses upon\r\nhis tenants the tax he has paid upon his real estate; each tenant\r\nassesses his share upon each of his customers; and so perfect is this\r\ndiffusion of land taxation that every traveler from a distant part of\r\nthe country who remains for even a single day at a hotel pays, without\r\nstopping to think about it, a portion of the taxes on the building,\r\nfirst paid by the owner, then assessed upon the lessees, and next cut\r\nup by them minutely in the _per diem_ charge. But of course neither\r\nthe owner nor lessee really escapes taxation, because a portion of\r\nsomebody else's tax is thrown back upon them.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to believe that in a city like New York, where less\r\nthan four per cent of its population pay any direct tax on real\r\nestate, or in a city like Montreal, where the expenses of the city are\r\nmainly derived from taxes on land and the building occupancy of land,\r\nthe great majority of the inhabitants of those cities are exempt from\r\nall land taxation? In China, where, as before shown, the title or\r\nownership of all land vests in the emperor, and the revenue of the\r\nGovernment is almost exclusively derived from taxation of land in the\r\nform of rent, does the burden of tax remain upon the owner of the\r\nland? If the tax in the form of rent is paid in the products of the\r\nland, as undoubtedly it is in part, will not the cost of the\r\npercentage of the whole product of the land that is thus taken\r\nincrease to the renter the cost of the percentage that is left to him;\r\nor, if the product is sold for money with which to pay the tax rent,\r\nwill not its selling price embody the cost of the tax, as it will the\r\ncost of every other thing necessary for production? To affirm to the\r\ncontrary is to say that the price which the Chinese farmer pays for\r\nthe right of the exclusive use of his land is no part of the crops he\r\nmay raise upon it.\r\n\r\nConsider next the assertion of those who maintain the nondiffusion\r\ntheory that taxes on land are paid by the owners because the supply\r\nof land can neither be increased nor diminished. In answer to it we\r\nhave the indisputable fact that the owners of land, whenever taxes are\r\nincreased, attempt to obtain an increased rental for it if the\r\ncircumstances will permit it. And the very attempt tends to increase\r\nthe rent. Nothing but adverse circumstances, such as diminishing\r\npopulation or commercial and industrial distress, can prevent a rise\r\nin the rental of land on which the taxes are increased; and in the\r\ncase of dwellings and warehouses the rise is almost always very\r\nprompt, because no man will erect new dwellings or warehouses unless\r\ntheir rent compensate fully the increase of taxation. And in any\r\nprosperous community, in which population increases in the natural\r\nratio, there must be a constant increase of dwellings and warehouses\r\nto prevent a rise of rent, independent of higher wages and higher\r\ntaxation. In no other occupation is capital surer of obtaining the\r\naverage net remuneration than in the erection of dwellings and\r\nwarehouses, and nothing but lack of general prosperity and diminishing\r\npopulation can throw the burden of taxation on real estate or its\r\nowners, without the slightest attempt at combination on their part. If\r\nthe owners of land are not reimbursed for its taxation by its\r\noccupants, new houses \"would not be erected, the old ones would wear\r\nout, and after a time the supply would be so small that the demand\r\nwould raise rents, and house building begin again, the tax having been\r\ntransferred to the occupier.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pertinent at this point to notice the averment that is\r\nfrequently made, that cultivators of the soil can not incorporate\r\ntaxes on the land in the price of their products, because the price of\r\ntheir whole crop is fixed by the price at which any portion of it can\r\nbe sold in foreign markets. In answer to this we have first the fact\r\nthat, to give the population of the world an adequate supply of food\r\nand other agricultural products, it is not only necessary that all the\r\nland at present under cultivation shall continue to be so employed,\r\nbut further that new lands shall each year be brought under\r\ncultivation, or else the land already cultivated shall be made more\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nThe population of the world steadily increases, notwithstanding wars,\r\nepidemics, and all the evils which are consequences of man's ignorance\r\nand of his improper use of things, his own faculties included. Hence,\r\nin case of increased taxation on land, the cultivator of the soil is\r\ngenerally enabled to transfer easily and promptly the burden of the\r\ntax to the purchasers of the products he raises, without abandoning\r\nthe cultivation even of the least productive soil.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the exports of many agricultural products are due not to\r\nthe cheapness of their cost of production, but to the variations which\r\noccur in the productiveness of the crops of other countries. M.\r\nRouher, a French economist, and for a period a minister of commerce,\r\nthoroughly investigated this matter, and proved by incontestable data\r\nthat almost invariably when the yield of breadstuffs in Europe was\r\nlarge in the country drained by the Black and Baltic Seas, it was\r\nsmall in the countries drained by the Atlantic. This variation in the\r\nyield of agricultural crops forces the countries where crops are\r\ndeficient to purchase from those where they are abundant, or who have\r\na surplus on hand from previous abundant harvests. In the United\r\nStates, when the harvests are abundant, the American farmers, rather\r\nthan sell below a certain price, keep a portion of their crops on hand\r\nuntil bad crops in Europe produce a foreign demand, which has to be\r\nsupplied at once. Under such circumstances those who hold the surplus\r\nstock of breadstuffs, or any other product, would control the price,\r\nand not the foreigners who stand in need of it. The only check, then,\r\nto the cupidity of the holders of breadstuffs is the competition\r\nbetween themselves, which invariably suffices to prevent any undue\r\nadvantage being taken of the necessities of the countries whose\r\nharvests are deficient. These bad crops occur frequently enough to\r\nconsume all the surplus of the countries that produce in excess of\r\ntheir own wants. In fact, this transient, irregular demand is counted\r\nupon and provided for by producers just as much so as the regular home\r\ndemand--hence is one of the elements that regulate production and\r\ncontrol prices.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the discussion it is desirable to obtain a clear and\r\ntrue idea of the meaning or definition of the phrase \"diffusion of\r\ntaxes.\" As sometimes used in popular and superficial discussions, it\r\nis held to imply that every tax imposed by law distributes itself\r\nequitably over the whole surface of society. Such implication would,\r\nhowever, be even more fallacious than an assumption that every\r\nexpenditure made by an individual distributes itself in such a way\r\nthat it becomes equally an expenditure by every other individual. On\r\nthe other hand, a fair consideration of the foregoing summary of facts\r\nand deductions would seem to compel every mind not previously warped\r\nby prejudice to accept and indorse the following as great fundamental\r\nprinciples in taxation: _First_, that in order to burden equitably and\r\nuniformly all persons and property, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nrevenue for public purposes, it is not necessary to tax primarily and\r\nuniformly all persons and property within the taxing district.\r\n_Second_, equality of taxation consists in a uniform assessment of the\r\nsame articles or class of property that is subject to taxation.\r\n_Third_, taxes under such a system equate and diffuse themselves; and\r\nif levied with certainty and uniformity upon tangible property and\r\nfixed signs of property, they will, by a diffusion and repercussion,\r\nreach and burden all visible property, and also all of the so-called\r\n\"invisible and intangible\" property, with unerring certainty and\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nAll taxation ultimately and necessarily falls on consumption; and the\r\nburden of every man, under any equitable system of taxation, and which\r\nno effort will enable him to avoid, will be in the exact proportion or\r\nratio which his aggregate consumption maintains to the aggregate\r\nconsumption of the taxing district, State, or community of which he is\r\na member.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, contended that unequal taxation on competitors of\r\nthe same class, persons, or things diffuses itself whether such\r\ninequality be the result of intention or of defective laws, and their\r\nmore defective administration. And doubtless one prime reason why\r\neconomists and others interested have not accepted the law of\r\ndiffusion of taxes as here given is that they see, as the practical\r\nworkings of the tax systems they live under, or have become\r\npractically familiar with, that taxes in many instances do seem to\r\nremain on the person who immediately pays them; and fail to see that\r\nsuch result is due--as in the case of the taxation of large classes of\r\nthe so-called personal property--to the adoption of a system which\r\ndoes not permit of equality in assessment, and therefore can not be\r\nfollowed by anything of equality in diffusion. Such persons may not\r\nunfairly be compared to physicists, who, constantly working with\r\nimperfect instruments, and constantly obtaining, in consequence,\r\ndefective results, come at last to regard their errors as in the\r\nnature of established truths.[18]\r\n\r\nAccording to these conclusions, the greatest consumers must be the\r\ngreatest taxpayers. The man also who evades a tax clearly robs his\r\nneighbors. The thief also pays taxes indirectly, for he is a consumer,\r\nand must pay the advanced price caused by his own roguery for all he\r\nconsumes, although he does steal the money to pay with. Idlers and\r\neven tramps pay taxes, but the amount that they indirectly pay into\r\nthe fund is much less than they take out of it. People are sometimes\r\nreferred to or characterized as non-taxpayers, and in political\r\nharangues and socialistic essays measures or policies are recommended\r\nby which certain persons or classes, by reason of their extreme\r\npoverty, shall be entirely exempt from all incidence or burden of\r\ntaxation. Such a person does not, however, exist in any civilized\r\ncommunity. If one could be found he would be a greater curiosity than\r\nexists in any museum. To avoid taxation a man must go into an\r\nunsettled wilderness where he has no neighbors, for as soon as he has\r\na companion, if that companion be only a dog, which he in part or all\r\nsupports, taxation begins, and the more companions he has, the greater\r\nimprovements he makes, and the higher civilization he enjoys, the\r\nheavier will be the taxes he must pay.\r\n\r\nTaxes _legitimately_ levied, then, are a part of the cost of all\r\nproduction, and there can be no more tendency for taxes to remain upon\r\nthe persons who immediately pay them than there is for rents, the cost\r\nof insurance, water supply, and fuel to follow the same law. The\r\nperson who wishes to use or destroy the utility of property by\r\nconsumption to gratify his desires, or satisfy his wants, can not\r\nobtain it from the owners or producers with their consent, except by\r\ngift, without giving pay or services for it; and the average price of\r\nall property is coincident with the cost of production, including the\r\ntaxes advanced upon it, which are a part of its cost in the hands of\r\nthe seller. Again, no person who produces any form of property or\r\nutility, for the purpose of sale or rent, sustains any burden of\r\nlegitimate taxation, although he may be a tax advancer; for, as a tax\r\nadvancer, he is the agent of the State, and a tax collector from the\r\nconsumer. But he who produces or buys, and does not sell or rent, but\r\nconsumes, is the taxpayer, and sustains a tax in his aggregate\r\nconsumption, where all taxation must ultimately rest. In short, no\r\nperson bears the burden of taxation, under an equitable, legitimate\r\nsystem, except upon the property which he applies to his own exclusive\r\nuse in ultimate consumption. The great consumer is the only great\r\ntaxpayer.\r\n\r\nFinally, a great economic law pointed out by Adam Smith, which has an\r\nimportant and almost conclusive bearing upon this vexed problem of the\r\ndiffusion of taxes, should not be overlooked--namely, his statement in\r\nThe Wealth of Nations that \"_no tax can ever reduce for any\r\nconsiderable time the rate of profit in any particular trade, which\r\nmust always keep its level with other trades in the neighborhood_.\" In\r\nother words, taxes and profits, by the operation of the laws of human\r\nnature, constantly tend to equate themselves. Man is always prompted\r\nto engage in the most profitable occupation and to make the most\r\nprofitable investment. And since the emancipation from feudalism with\r\nits sumptuary laws, legal regulations of the price of labor and\r\nmerchandise, and other arbitrary governmental invasions of private\r\nrights, individual judgment and self-interest have been recognized as\r\nthe best tests or arbiters of the profitableness of a given investment\r\nor occupation. The average profits, therefore, of one form of\r\ninvestment, or of one occupation (as originally shown by Adam Smith),\r\nmust for any long period equal the average profits of other\r\ninvestments and occupations, whether taxed or untaxed, skill, risk,\r\nand agreeableness of occupation being taken into consideration.[19]\r\nNatural laws will, accordingly, always produce an equilibrium of\r\nburden between taxed and untaxed things and persons. There is a level\r\nof profit and a level of taxation by natural laws, as there is a level\r\nof the ocean by natural laws. In fact, all proportional contributions\r\nto the State from direct competitors are diffused upon persons and\r\nthings in the taxing jurisdiction by a uniformity as manifest as is\r\nthe pressure upon water, which is known to be equal in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nA word here in reference to the popular idea that the exemption of any\r\nform of property is to grant a favor to those who possess such\r\nproperty. This idea has, however, no warrant for its acceptance. Thus,\r\nan exemption is freedom from a burden or service to which others are\r\nliable; but in case of the exclusion of an entire class of property\r\nfrom primary taxation, no person is liable, and therefore there is no\r\nexemption. An exclusion of all milk from taxation, while whisky is\r\ntaxed, is not an exemption, for the two are not competing articles, or\r\narticles of the same class. It is true that highly excessive taxation\r\nof a given article may cause another and similar article, in some\r\ninstances, to become a substitute or competing article; and hence the\r\nnecessity of care and moderation in establishing the rate of taxation.\r\nWe do not consider that putting a given article into the free list,\r\nunder the tariff, is an exemption to any particular individual; but if\r\nwe make the rate higher on one taxpayer or on one importer of the same\r\narticle than on another taxpayer or importer, we grant an exemption.\r\nWe use the word \"exemption,\" therefore, imperfectly, when we speak of\r\n\"the exemption of an entire class of property,\" as, for example, upon\r\nall personal property; for if the removal of the burden operates\r\nuniformly on all interested, or owning such property, then there can\r\nbe no primary exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] \"Senator Paddock: I should like to ask the Senator from Nevada\r\nif, in the region of country where borax is found, by reason of\r\nfinding it the land in the particular State or Territory is\r\nappreciated in value on account of its existence.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Stewart: Not at all.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Paddock: The value then given to it is all in\r\nlabor.\"--_Congressional Record, July, 1890._\r\n\r\n[14] \"In America, where there has been but little serious study of\r\ntaxation, the few writers of prominence are, remarkable to relate,\r\nalmost all abject followers of Thiers,\" the French economist and\r\nstatesman, who claimed to have invented the term \"diffusion\" of taxes.\r\n\r\n[15] \"Our conclusion is, that under actual conditions in America\r\nto-day the landowner may virtually be declared to pay in the last\r\ninstance the taxes that are imposed on his land, and that at all\r\nevents it is absolutely erroneous to assume any general shifting to\r\nthe consumer. In so far as our land tax is a part of a general\r\nproperty tax, it can not possibly be shifted; in so far as it is more\r\nor less an exclusive tax, it is even then apt to remain where it is\r\nfirst put--on the landowner.\"--_Seligman: Incidence of Taxation, p.\r\n99._\r\n\r\n[16] Seligman. Shifting and Incidence of Taxation.\r\n\r\n[17] Professor Marshall.\r\n\r\n[18] In a like experience the Duke of Argyll, in his work The Unseen\r\nFoundations of Society, finds an explanation of the so-called theory\r\nof Ricardo, that the rent which a farmer of agricultural land pays as\r\nthe price of its hire--that is to say, the price which he pays for the\r\nexclusive use of it--is no part of the cost of the crops he may raise\r\nupon it; a conclusion that can not be possibly true, unless it be also\r\ntrue that rent is paid for something that is not an indispensable\r\ncondition of agricultural production. \"Thus rights are in their very\r\nnature impalpable and invisible. They are not material things, but\r\nrelations between many material things and the human mind and will.\r\nThe right of exclusive use over land is a thing invisible and\r\nimmaterial, as other rights are, and, although it is, and has been\r\nsince the world began, the basis of all agricultural industry, it is a\r\nbasis impalpable and invisible, whereas the material visible\r\nimplements and tools, whose work depends upon it, are all visible and\r\npalpable enough, and all of which would never be were we to see them\r\nwithout the invisible rights upon which they depend. All of the\r\nformer, in their place and order, are instruments of production; all\r\nof them catch the eye, and may easily engross the attention. On the\r\nother hand, if we are induced to forget those other elements, which\r\nare equally essential instruments of production, merely because they\r\nare out of sight, then our deception may be complete, and fallacies\r\nwhich become glaring when memory and attention are awakened may find\r\nin our half-vacant minds an easy and even a cordial reception.\"\r\n\r\nAdam Smith may be fairly considered as having fully committed himself\r\nbeyond all controversy in his great work, The Wealth of Nations, to\r\nthe principle that taxes, with a degree of infallibility, diffuse\r\nthemselves when they are levied uniformly on the same article; and he\r\neven goes so far as to admit that a tax upon labor, if it could be\r\nuniformly levied and collected, would be diffused, and that the\r\nlaborer would be the mere conduit through which the tax would pass to\r\nthe public treasury. Thus he says, \"While the demand for labor and the\r\nprice of provisions, therefore, remain the same, a direct tax upon\r\nwages can have no other effect than to raise them somewhat higher than\r\nthe tax.\"\r\n\r\nThe German economist Bluntschli, who has carefully studied this\r\nquestion of the final incidence of all just and equitable taxes, is in\r\nsubstantial agreement with the above conclusions, but prefers to use a\r\ndifferent term for characterizing such finality than consumption, and\r\nexpresses himself as follows: \"In the end taxes fall on _enjoyments_.\r\nHence the amount of each man's enjoyments and not his income is the\r\njustest measure of taxation.\" (Bluntschli, vol. x, p. 146.)\r\n\r\nM. Thiers, the French statesman and economist, was also a believer and\r\nearnest advocate of the theory of the diffusion of taxes, and lays\r\ndown his principles in the following words: \"Taxes are shifted\r\nindefinitely, and tend to become a part of the price of commodities,\r\nto such an extent that every one bears his share, not in proportion to\r\nwhat he pays the state, but in proportion to what he consumes.\" And in\r\nhis book Rights to Property he thus illustrates the method in which\r\ntaxation diffuses itself: \"In the same manner as our senses, deceived\r\nby appearances, tell us that it is the sun which moves and not the\r\nearth, so a particular tax appears to fall upon one class, and another\r\ntax upon another class, when in reality it is not so. The tax really\r\nbest suited to the poorest member of society is that which is best\r\nsuited to the general fortune of the state; a fortune which is much\r\nmore for the possession and enjoyment of the poor man than it is for\r\nthe rich; a fact of which we are never sufficiently convinced. But of\r\nthe manner, nevertheless, in which taxes are divided among the\r\ndifferent classes of the state, the most certain thing we can say is:\r\nThat they are divided in proportion to what each man consumes, and for\r\na reason not generally recognized or understood, namely, that taxes\r\nare reflected, as it were, to infinity, and from reflection to\r\nreflection become eventually an integral part of the prices of things.\r\nHence the greatest purchasers and consumers are everywhere the\r\ngreatest taxpayers. This is what I call '_diffusion of taxation_,' to\r\nborrow a term from physical science, which applies the expression\r\n'diffusion of light' to those numberless reflections, in consequence\r\nof which the light which has penetrated the slightest aperture spreads\r\nitself around in every direction, and in such a manner as to reach all\r\nthe objects which it renders visible. So a tax which at first sight\r\nappears to be paid directly, in reality is only advanced by the\r\nindividual who is first called upon to pay it.\"\r\n\r\n[19] As applied to the wages of labor, the truth of this principle is\r\nequally incontestable. \"The sewing girl performing her toilsome work\r\nby the needle at one dollar a day, the street sweeper working the mud\r\nwith his broom at a dollar and a half, the skilled laborer at two and\r\nthree dollars, the professor at five, the editor at five or ten, the\r\nartist and the songstress at ten or five hundred dollars a day are all\r\nmembers of the working classes, though working at different rates. And\r\nit is only the difference in their effectiveness that causes the\r\ndifference in their earnings. Bring them all to the same point of\r\nefficiency, and their earnings also will be the same.\"--_W. Jungst,\r\nCincinnati._\r\n\r\nJohn Locke, in his treatise On the Standard of Value, treats of\r\ntaxation, and shows conclusively that if all lands were nominally free\r\nfrom taxation, the owners of lands would proportionally pay more taxes\r\nthan now, because the same amount of money must continue to be\r\ncollected in some form, and the average profits of lands would only be\r\nequal to the average profits of other investments; and further, that\r\nthe expense and annoyance (another form of expense) would be increased\r\nif the tax were exclusively levied in the first instance upon personal\r\nproperty; and hence the landowner would be burdened with his\r\nproportion of the unnecessary expense and annoyance. He also shows\r\nthat you may change the form of a uniform tax, but that you can not\r\nchange the burden; and that the change will increase the burden, if\r\nthe new system is more expensive and annoying than the old. Locke\r\nwrote nearly a century before Adam Smith published his Wealth of\r\nNations, and it would seem probable that Smith acquired his ideas\r\nrelative to the average profits of investments from Locke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BOMBARDMENT.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES F. HOLDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA thin stratum of air, an invisible armor of great tenuity, lies\r\nbetween man and the menace of possible annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe regions of space beyond our planet are filled with flying\r\nfragments. Some meet the earth in its onward rush; others, having\r\nattained inconceivable velocity, overtake and crash into the whirling\r\nsphere with loud detonation and ominous glare, finding destruction in\r\nits molecular armor, or perhaps ricocheting from it again into the\r\nunknown. Some come singly, vagrant fragments from the infinity of\r\nspace; others fall in showers like golden rain; all constituting a\r\nbombardment appalling in its magnitude. It has been estimated that\r\nevery twenty-four hours the earth or its atmosphere is struck by _four\r\nhundred million_ missiles of iron or stone, ranging from an ounce up\r\nto tons in weight. Every month there rushes upon the flying globe at\r\nleast twelve billion iron and stone fragments, which, with lurid\r\naccompaniment, crash into the circumambient atmosphere. Owing to the\r\nresistance offered by the air, few of these solid shots strike the\r\nearth. They move out of space with a possible velocity of thirty or\r\nforty miles per second, and, like moths, plunge into the revolving\r\nglobe, lured to their destruction by its fatal attraction. The moment\r\nthey enter our atmosphere they ignite; the air is piled up and\r\ncompressed ahead of them with inconceivable force, the resultant\r\nfriction producing an immediate rise in temperature, and the shooting\r\nstar, the meteor of popular parlance, is the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IDEAL VIEW OF THE EARTH AS IT IS BOMBARDED BY THE\r\nESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION METEORITES EVERY TWENTY-FOUR\r\nHOURS.[20]]\r\n\r\nA simple experiment, made by Joule and Thomson, well illustrates the\r\npossibility of this rise in temperature by atmospheric friction. If a\r\nwire is whirled through the air at a rate of one hundred and\r\nseventy-five feet per second, a rise of one degree, centigrade, will\r\nbe noticed. If the revolutions are increased to three hundred and\r\nseventy-two feet per second, the elevation will be 5.3° C. If the\r\ntemperature increases as the square of the velocity, a rate of speed\r\nof twenty miles per second would develop a temperature not far from\r\n360,000° C., which is probably far less than that at the surface of\r\nthe ordinary meteor as it is seen blazing through our atmosphere. If\r\nthe meteor is small it is often consumed by the intense heat\r\ngenerated; but larger fragments, owing to their velocity and the fact\r\nthat they are poor conductors of heat and burn slowly, reach the\r\nsurface and bury themselves in the sea or earth. But few escape the\r\ninevitable consequences of the contact, and of the untold millions\r\nwhich have struck the earth within the memory of man but five hundred\r\nand thirty have been seen to fall. The phenomena associated with the\r\nplunging meteor is most interesting. A blaze of light, as the\r\nterrific heat ignites the iron, announces its entrance into our\r\natmosphere. It may be red, yellow, white, green, or blue, all these\r\nhues having been observed. Then follows the explosion, caused by the\r\ncontact with the air piled up ahead, and in certain instances a loud\r\ndetonation or a series of noises is heard, which may be repeated\r\nindefinitely until the meteoric mass is completely destroyed, and\r\ndrops, a shower of disintegrated particles, which fall rattling to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe blaze of light does not continue to the earth, nor does the\r\nmeteor, should it survive, strike the ground with the velocity with\r\nwhich it entered the atmosphere, as the latter often arrests its\r\nmotion so completely that it drops upon the earth by its own weight,\r\nwell illustrated by the meteorites of the Hesslefall, which dropped\r\nupon ice but a few inches thick, rebounding as they fell. Thus the\r\natmosphere protects the inhabitants of the globe from a terrific\r\nbombardment by destroying many of the largest meteorites, reducing the\r\nsize of others before they reach the surface and arresting the\r\nvelocity so that few bury themselves deeply in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe writer observed a remarkable meteor in 1894. It entered our\r\natmosphere, apparently, over the Mojave Desert, in California, and\r\nexploded over the San Gabriel Valley, though without any appreciable\r\nsound, and after the first flash disappeared, leaving in the air a\r\nlarge balloon-shaped object of yellow light which lasted some moments,\r\npresenting a remarkable spectacle. In this instance the meteor had\r\nprobably exploded or been consumed, leaving only the light to tell the\r\nstory, the atmospheric armor of the earth having successfully warded\r\noff the blow.\r\n\r\nViewing the facts as they exist, the earth, a seeming fugitive mass\r\nflying through space, vainly endeavoring to break the bonds which bind\r\nit to the sun, hunted, bombarded with strange missiles hurled from\r\nunseen hands or forces from the infinity of space, it is little wonder\r\nthat the ancients and some savage races of later times invested the\r\nphenomena with strange meanings. It requires but little imagination to\r\nsee in the flying earth a living monster followed by shadowy furies\r\nwhich hurl themselves upon it, now vainly attempting to reach the\r\nair-protected body or again striking it with terrific force, lodging\r\ndeep in its sides amid loud reverberation and dazzling blaze of light.\r\n\r\nMeteorites have been known from the very earliest times, and have\r\noften been regarded as miraculous creatures to be worshiped and handed\r\ndown from family to family. The famous meteorite which fell in\r\nPhrygia, centuries ago, was worshiped as Cybele, \"the mother of the\r\ngods,\" and about the year 204 B.C. was carried to Rome with much\r\ndisplay and ceremony, when people of all classes fell down before it,\r\ndeeming it a messenger from the gods. Diana of Ephesus and the famous\r\nCyprian Venus were, in all probability, meteoric stones which were\r\nseen to fall, and were worshiped for the same reason as above. Livy\r\ndescribes a shower of meteorites which fell about the Alban Mount 652\r\nB.C. The senate was demoralized, and certain prophets announced it a\r\nwarning from heaven, so impressing the lawmakers that they declared a\r\nnine-days' festival with which to propitiate the gods. The visitor to\r\nMecca will find enshrined in a place of honor a meteorite which can be\r\ntraced back beyond 600 A.D., and which is worshiped by pilgrims. The\r\nTartars pointed out a meteorite to Pallas, in 1772, which had fallen\r\nat Krasnojarsk, and which they considered a holy messenger from\r\nheaven. A large body of meteoric iron found in Wichita County, Texas,\r\nwas regarded by the Indians as a fetich. They told strangers that it\r\ncame from the sky as a messenger from the Great Spirit. This meteorite\r\nwas stationed at a point where two Indian trails met, and was observed\r\nand worshiped as a shrine.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have records of meteors which fell 644 B.C. The oldest\r\nauthentic fall in which the stone is preserved is that of Ensisheim,\r\nElsass, Germany, in 1492. The stone, which weighed two hundred and\r\nsixty pounds, fell with a loud roar, much to the dismay of the\r\npeasantry, penetrating the ground to a depth of five feet. It was\r\nsecured by King Maximilian, who, after presenting the Duke Sigismund\r\nwith a section, hung the remainder in the parish church as a holy\r\nrelic, where, it is said, it may still be seen.\r\n\r\nMeteorites vary in size from minute objects not larger than a pea to\r\nmasses of iron of enormous size. The Chupaderos meteorite, which fell\r\nin Chihuahua, Mexico, weighs twenty-five tons. Another, which fell in\r\nKansas, broke into myriads of pieces, the sections found weighing\r\nthirteen hundred pounds. A meteorite in the Vienna Museum, which fell\r\nin Hungary, weighs six hundred and forty-seven pounds, while the\r\nCranbourne meteorite in the British Museum weighs four tons. The Red\r\nRiver meteorite in the Yale Museum weighs sixteen hundred and thirty\r\npounds. The largest meteorite known was discovered within the Arctic\r\nCircle by Lieutenant Peary. The Eskimos had known of it for\r\ngenerations as a source of supply for iron. It was found by Lieutenant\r\nPeary in May, 1894, but, owing to its enormous weight, could not be\r\nremoved until the summer of 1897, when, after much labor, it was\r\nexcavated and hoisted into the hold of the steam whaling bark Hope and\r\ncarried to New York, where it has found a resting place in the cabinet\r\nof the American Museum of Natural History. It is believed to weigh one\r\nhundred tons.\r\n\r\nUp to 1772 the stories of bodies falling from space were not\r\nentertained seriously by scientific men. So eminent a scientist as\r\nLavoisier, after thoroughly investigating a case, decided that it was\r\nmerely a stone which had been struck by lightning. Falls finally\r\noccurred which demonstrated beyond dispute that the missiles came from\r\nspace, and science recognized the fact that the earth was literally\r\nbeing bombarded, and that human safety was due to the atmospheric\r\narmor, scarcely one hundred miles thick, that enveloped the earth.\r\nInstances of the destruction of human life from this cause are very\r\nrare. Some years ago a meteorite crushed into the home of an Italian\r\npeasant, killing the occupant; and cattle have been known to be\r\ndestroyed by them; but such instances are exceptional. In 1660 a\r\nmeteorite fell at Milan, on the authority of the Italian physicist\r\nPaolo Maria Tezzayo, killing a Franciscan monk. Humboldt is authority\r\nfor the statement that a monk was struck dead by a meteorite at Crema,\r\nSeptember 4, 1511; and in 1674, on the same authority, a meteorite\r\nstruck a ship at sea and killed two Swedish sailors.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1795, at Wold Cottage, in Yorkshire, England, a stone\r\nweighing fifty pounds dashed through the air with a loud roar,\r\nalarming people in the vicinity, and burying itself in the ground not\r\nthirty feet from a laborer. This mass, though undoubtedly traveling,\r\nwhen it struck our atmosphere, at a rate of at least thirty miles a\r\nsecond, was checked so completely that it sank but twelve inches into\r\nthe soft chalk. Great as is the heat generated during the passage of a\r\nmeteorite through the air, it does not always permeate the entire\r\nbody. This was well illustrated in the case of the meteorite which\r\nfell at Dhurmsala, Kangra, Punjaub, India, in 1860, fragments of which\r\ncan be seen in the Field Museum in Chicago. Of it Dr. Oliver C.\r\nFarington says: \"The fragments were so cold as to benumb the fingers\r\nof those who collected them. This is perhaps the only instance known\r\nin which the cold of space has become perceptible to human senses.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the individual falls during recent years have attracted\r\nwidespread attention. One of the most remarkable is known as the Great\r\nKansas Meteor. It was evidently of large size, flashing into sight\r\neighty or ninety miles from the earth, on the 20th of June, 1876, over\r\nthe State of Kansas. To the first observers it appeared to come from\r\nthe vicinity of the moon, and resembled a small moon or a gigantic\r\nfire ball, blazing brightly, and creating terror and amazement among\r\nthousands of spectators who witnessed its flight. It passed to the\r\neast, disappearing near the horizon in a blaze of light. The entire\r\npassage occupied nearly fifty seconds, being visible to the\r\ninhabitants of Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.\r\n\r\nThis visitor created the greatest alarm and apprehension along its\r\npath, the blaze of light being accompanied by repeated explosions and\r\ndetonations which sounded like the rumble and roar of cannonading. To\r\nsome it appeared like the rattling of heavy teams over a rough, rocky\r\nroad; others believed subterranean explosions accompanied the fall.\r\nHorses ran away, stock hurried bellowing to cover, and men, women, and\r\nchildren crouched in fear or fled before the fiery visitor whose roar\r\nwas distinctly heard several minutes after it had disappeared. As the\r\nmeteor crossed the Mississippi River the noise of the explosions\r\nincreased in severity, and were distinctly heard sixty or seventy\r\nmiles from its path, or a distance of one hundred and forty miles\r\napart. The great ball of flame remained intact as it crossed five or\r\nsix States, but as it passed over central Illinois loud detonations\r\nwere heard and the light spread out like an exploding rocket with\r\nflashing points. This was the death and destruction of the monster,\r\nand from here it dashed on, a stream or shower of countless meteors\r\ninstead of a solid body, forming over Indiana and Ohio a cluster over\r\nforty miles long and five in breadth, showing that while the meteor\r\nhad broken up it was still moving with great velocity. How far it\r\ntraveled is not known, as it was not seen to strike. Observers in\r\nPennsylvania saw it rushing in the direction of New York, and people\r\nin that State, where the day was cloudy, heard strange rumblings and\r\ndetonations. Houses rattled, and the inhabitants along the line the\r\nmeteor was supposed to have passed accredited the phenomena to an\r\nearthquake. Somewhere, perhaps in the forest region of the\r\nAdirondacks, or in the Atlantic, lies the wreck of this meteor. But\r\none fragment was found. A farmer in Indiana, while watching its\r\npassage heard the thud of a falling object, and going to the spot the\r\nfollowing morning found a small meteorite weighing two thirds of a\r\npound.\r\n\r\nThis marvelous body was first observed in all probability in the\r\nnorthwestern corner of the Indian Territory, possibly sixty or seventy\r\nmiles above the earth, and from here it dashed along with repeated\r\nexplosions, almost parallel to the earth's surface, disappearing over\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable meteor fell into the Atlantic Ocean far out at sea,\r\nJuly 20, 1860. It resembled the one mentioned above in that it was\r\naccompanied by a marvelous pyrotechnic display. It first appeared in\r\nthe vicinity of Michigan, blazing out with a fiery glow that filled\r\nthe heavens with light. Cocks crowed, oxen lowed, and people rushed\r\nfrom their homes along its course over the States of New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and New Jersey. When last seen, over the Atlantic, it\r\nhad separated into three parts, which followed each other as separate\r\nfire bodies, without the noise which was the accompanying feature of\r\nthe Kansas meteor.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the majority of meteors plunge into the ocean, and in modern\r\ntimes several large meteoric bodies have narrowly escaped passing\r\nvessels. On December 1, 1896, the officers of the ship Walkomming,\r\nbound from New York to Bremen, noticed a large and brilliant meteor\r\nflashing down upon them. Its direction was from southeast to\r\nnorthwest, and it plunged into the sea ahead of the vessel with a loud\r\nroar and hissing sound; a few minutes later an immense tidal wave,\r\npresumably caused by the fall, struck the ship, doing no little\r\ndamage. Even more remarkable was the escape of the British ship\r\nCawdor, which was given up by the underwriters, but which reached San\r\nFrancisco November 20, 1897. During a heavy storm, August 20th, a\r\nlarge meteor flashed from the sky and passed between the main and\r\nmizzen masts, crashing into the sea with a blinding flash and\r\ndeafening detonation. For a moment it was thought the ship was on\r\nfire, and the air was filled with sulphurous fumes.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a meteor dashed into the atmosphere of the earth and made a\r\nbrilliant display over southern California. It appeared between\r\ntwelve and one o'clock in the morning, and shot across the heavens, a\r\nfiery red mass--not like the ordinary meteor, but writhing and\r\ntwisting in a manner peculiarly its own, resembling a huge serpent.\r\nWhen it had passed nearly across the sky it apparently stopped and\r\ndoubled in the form of a horseshoe, according to the informant of the\r\nwriter, as large as a half-mile race track. The horseshoe remained\r\nvisible several minutes, gradually disappearing. The brilliancy of\r\nthis meteor can be imagined when it is known that the entire San\r\nGabriel Valley was illumined as though an electric light of great\r\npower had suddenly been flashed upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COON BUTTE, ON SLOPE OF WHICH TEN TONS OF METEORIC IRON\r\nHAS BEEN FOUND, AND WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY A METEOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF INTERIOR OF COON BUTTE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF COON BUTTE.]\r\n\r\nSome time in past ages a meteorite weighing at least ten tons shot\r\ninto our atmosphere and struck the earth near the famous Cañon Diablo\r\nin Arizona, the mysterious gulch crossed by the Atchison, Topeka and\r\nSanta Fé Railroad. The discovery was made several years ago by a sheep\r\nherder, named Armijo. Finding a piece of iron with a peculiar lustrous\r\nsurface which he believed to be silver, he carried it to one of the\r\ntowns, where it finally fell into the hands of a geologist, who\r\npronounced it a meteorite. The discovery was followed up, and on the\r\ncrest and in the vicinity of a singular cone about four thousand feet\r\nin diameter pieces of a meteorite were found on the surface, which\r\ngave a combined weight of ten tons, in all probability but a fraction\r\nof the real monster. The iron masses were widely scattered over the\r\nslope and the adjacent _mesa_, and it was assumed that a gigantic\r\nmeteorite or star had fallen and produced the cone, another striking\r\nthe earth and forming what is now known as the Cañon Diablo. A large\r\npiece of meteoric iron was found twenty miles from the cone; another\r\neight miles east of it; two thousand pieces weighing not over a few\r\npounds or ounces were taken from the slopes; two exceeding a thousand\r\npounds were found within a half mile, while forty or fifty weighing\r\nabout one hundred pounds were discovered within a radius of half a\r\nmile. Here not only a meteor, but a large-sized meteoric shower, had\r\nsucceeded in penetrating the armor of the earth, leaving many\r\nevidences of the extraordinary occurrence which may have been\r\nwitnessed by the early man of what is now known as Arizona. From the\r\npeculiar and interesting evidence a geologist deduced the hypothesis\r\nthat the crater known as Coon Butte could have been produced by a\r\nmeteor with a diameter of fifteen hundred feet, and a careful\r\nexamination with a view of discovering it was made with nicely\r\nadjusted magnetic instruments; but in no instance did they indicate\r\nthe presence of a vast body of metal buried in the earth, and it was\r\nassumed that the striking of the crater by the colossal meteorite was\r\na chance blow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRATER OF COON BUTTE NEAR CAÑON DIABLO, near which\r\nthe fragments of a meteorite have been found, and which was supposed\r\nat one time to have been made by the meteorite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-ONE POUND METEORITE. A part of\r\nthe ten-ton meteorite which fell at Coon Butte, near Cañon Diablo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-ONE AND A HALF POUND METEORITE\r\nFOUND NEAR CRATER OF COON BUTTE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSES SHOW LARGE PIECES OF THE METEORITE FOUND AT\r\nCOON BUTTE. (Seven miles in diameter.)]\r\n\r\nThe meteorites or foreign bodies which bombard the earth may be\r\nincluded in three classes--meteoric irons or aërosiderites, meteoric\r\niron stones or aërosiderolites, and meteoric stones, aërolites--all\r\ncontaining elements, about twenty-five in number, which have been\r\nfound upon the earth. The most conspicuous and important are silicon,\r\niron, nickel, magnesium, sulphur, carbon, and phosphorus, while the\r\nothers are aluminum, antimony, arsenic, calcium, chlorine, chromium,\r\ncobalt, copper, hydrogen, lithium, manganese, oxygen, potassium,\r\nsodium, tin, and titanium. Hydrogen and the diamond have also been\r\nobserved. A number of interesting chemical compounds are found in\r\nmeteorites not known on the earth, and a study of their character\r\nshows that the conditions under which the meteors were formed were\r\nentirely different from those which saw the beginning of things\r\nterrestrial. In brief, where meteors were born there was an absence of\r\nair and water. On the other hand, there was at some stage in the\r\nhistory of meteorites an abundance of hydrogen. The meteoric irons are\r\nmade up principally of iron with an alloy of nickel, and show a rich\r\ncrystalline structure, the various angles producing a variety of\r\nforms known as _Widmanstatten_ figures which a few years ago formed\r\nthe basis of a singular sensation. The figures were supposed to be\r\nfossil shells and various animals of a diminutive size which once\r\npopulated the wrecked world of which the meteor was assumed to be a\r\npart. These meteoric animals from space were named and classified by\r\nseveral observers, who were finally forced to acknowledge that their\r\ncreations were the fanciful markings of crystallization.\r\n\r\nAnother class of meteorites (meteoric iron stones) may be described as\r\nspongy masses of nickeliferous iron in whose pores are found grains of\r\nchryosite and other silicates. A type of these bodies is the meteor of\r\nPallas, which was discovered by him in 1772. The third class of\r\nmeteoric stones are those in which the stony or silicous predominates.\r\nAs a rule they contain scattered metallic grains, but certain ones, as\r\nthe aërolite which fell at Gara, France, in 1806, contain metallic\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nThe aërolites present an attractive appearance when made into\r\nsections, showing crystals and splinterlike fragments, and under the\r\nglass seem to be made up of many minute spheres ranging from those the\r\nsize of a cherry down to others invisible to the naked eye. The\r\nminerals prominent in their composition are chrysolite, bronzite,\r\naugite, enstatite, feldspar, chronite, etc., showing a marked\r\nsimilarity to the eruptive rocks so well known on the earth. The\r\ncollections of famous meteorites in the various museums of the world\r\nhave constantly been examined and studied with a view to determine\r\ntheir origin, the question being a fascinating one to layman and\r\nscientist. Astronomers in the past have variously answered the\r\nquestion. The flying fragments were believed by some to be the\r\nwreckage of other worlds. Planets had perhaps collided and been rent\r\nasunder in former ages, and space filled with the flying fragments.\r\nOthers thought that meteors were molten matter thrown from the earth\r\nor moon. All these theories have been relinquished in view of evidence\r\nof a more or less convincing character pointing to the conclusion that\r\nthe bombardment of the earth is one of the results of the\r\ndisintegration of comets. In other words, cometary matter flying not\r\nalways blindly through space, but in the orbit of the comet of which\r\nit originally formed a part, constituting the missiles.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the meteors were formed in a region where air and\r\nwater were absent. It is equally evident that life was not a factor in\r\nthe past history of the bodies, though it must be acknowledged that\r\nthe hydrocarbons resembling terrestrial bitumens which are found in\r\nsome meteorites suggest the possibility of vegetable life. These\r\ncomets, the mysterious bodies which seem to be roving through space,\r\nmisconceived planets, as it were, forced into the world half made up,\r\noffer the best known solution, as they are literally worlds without\r\nair or water, enveloped in a strange and ever-changing substitute for\r\natmosphere; ghostly worlds, which seem to be drawn to the sun, then\r\nthrown out into space again to repeat the act until the mighty change\r\nfrom close contact with the fiery mass to the intense cold of distant\r\nrealms wrecks them, scatters their fragments through the infinity of\r\nspace where they form gigantic rings or clusters of meteoric matter,\r\nraining down upon the sun and planets and all heavenly bodies which\r\nmeet them, adding fuel to the former, material substance to the\r\nlatter, and in the case of the moon pitilessly bombarding her\r\ncrust--illustrating the effect of the bombardment of the earth were it\r\ndeprived of its atmospheric armor.\r\n\r\nThe evidence which enabled astronomers to definitely associate comets\r\nwith meteoric showers and falling stars leads one into a world of\r\nromance. Schiaparelli, the distinguished Italian astronomer, made the\r\ndiscovery that meteors had a cometic origin. He had been calculating\r\nthe orbit and motion of the meteorites which produce the August\r\nshowers, when it occurred to him that they corresponded with those of\r\na certain comet. By following up this clew it was discovered that the\r\norbit of Tempel's comet corresponded with that of the meteors of the\r\nNovember star shower. The most remarkable evidence was that produced\r\nby Biela's comet, discovered in 1826. It had a revolution about the\r\nsun of six years and eight months. It was seen in 1772, 1805, 1832,\r\n1845, and 1852. The vast mass, which appeared to be rushing around the\r\nsun with remarkable velocity, became separated in 1846, dividing into\r\ntwo parts, one hundred and fifty thousand or two hundred thousand\r\nmiles from each other. In six years the separation had increased to\r\nabout one and a half million miles. What mighty cataclysm in infinite\r\nspace caused this rupture the mind of man can not conceive, but\r\nsomething occurred which rent the aërial giant asunder, and so far as\r\nknown completed its wreck, as from that time Biela's comet has not\r\nbeen seen. In 1872 the comet was looked for, and astronomers predicted\r\nthat if it did not appear a shower of stars or meteors would be\r\nvisible--the remains of the lost traveler through space--and that they\r\nwould diverge from a point in Andromeda.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable prediction was verified in every particular. When the\r\nmoment for the appearance of the comet arrived, November 27, 1872,\r\nthere burst upon the heavens, not Biela's comet, but a marvelous\r\nshower of shooting stars, which dashed down from the constellation of\r\nAndromeda as predicted. In 1885 this was duplicated, and the\r\natmosphere was apparently filled with shooting stars. Biela's comet\r\nhad met disaster in infinite space, and the earth was being bombarded\r\nwith the wreckage.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to comprehend the vastness of these clusters of\r\nmeteors which constitute the wreck of comets and the source of the\r\nprincipal bombardments. Thus the August stream, which gives us the\r\nbrilliant displays of summer nights, is supposed to be ten million\r\nmiles in thickness, as the earth dashing through at a rate of two\r\nmillion miles a day is several days in passing it. We cross the\r\nNovember stream of meteors in a few hours, suggesting a width of forty\r\nthousand or fifty thousand miles. This stream of metallic bodies is\r\nhundreds of millions of miles in length, and contains myriads of\r\nprojectiles which may yet be hurled upon the earth or some of the\r\nplanets of the solar system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NOVEMBER SHOWER OF METEORS AT SEA FROM SANDY\r\nHOOK.]\r\n\r\nBut one piece of Biela's comet, so far as known, was found--a fragment\r\nweighing eight pounds falling at Mazapil, Mexico, where it remains one\r\nof the most inspiring and interesting of inanimate objects. For years\r\nthe vast metallic mass, of which this piece formed a part, rushed\r\nthrough space, covering millions of miles; now near the burning\r\nsurface of the sun, now in regions of space where its heat was\r\nscarcely perceptible. For over a century this monster was observed by\r\nthe inhabitants of the earth, and finally a portion fell and human\r\nbeings handled and examined it.\r\n\r\nThe fiery messengers which dash down singly upon the earth, the\r\nshowers of meteoric stones which flash through our atmosphere with\r\nephemeral gleams, are, then, the remains of gigantic comets which have\r\nbeen seen rushing with apparent erratic course through space, and\r\nwhich by unknown causes have been destroyed and now as meteoric\r\nclusters, one of which is estimated to be one billion miles in length\r\nand one hundred thousand miles in thickness, and to contain one\r\nhundred thousand million meteors, are swinging through space, with\r\nmany erratic and wandering forms, pouring upon the earth and all the\r\nplanets of the solar system a mighty and continuous bombardment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[20] The meteors shown in the two ideal pictures are, of course,\r\nentirely disproportionate in size to the earth and stars. If seen by\r\nan observer above the earth, we might imagine an envelope of light\r\naround the globe from the continuous ignition of the 150,000,000,000\r\nor more meteors which it is estimated strike the earth every year; in\r\nwhich case, the striking meteors would be represented in the\r\nillustrations as a thin light line surrounding the atmospheric\r\nenvelope of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF CONQUEST.\r\n\r\nBY J. NOVICOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spirit of conquest produces a gigantic aggregation of calamities\r\nand sufferings. A large number of persons still regard conquests with\r\na favoring eye. Now, what does a conquest signify? It is the arming of\r\na band of soldiers and going and taking possession of a territory.\r\nAlthough such expeditions may appear useful, lucrative, legitimate,\r\nand even glorious, little regard is paid, in conducting them, to the\r\ngood of societies; for, in spite of all euphemisms, such military\r\nenterprises are robbery, and nothing else, all the time.\r\n\r\nGenerous spirits who talk about suppressing war do great injury to\r\nmankind. Setting themselves in pursuit of a chimera, they abandon the\r\nroad that leads to concrete and positive results. Realists treat the\r\npartisans of perpetual peace as Utopian dreamers, and refuse to follow\r\nthem. The noblest and most generous efforts are thus wholly lost. The\r\ndirection of public opinion is left to empirics and retrogrades, to\r\nnarrow-minded people, who are satisfied with living from day to day\r\nand have not the courage to look the social problems of the time in\r\nthe face. War will never be abolished any more than murder. The\r\npropaganda should not be directed on that side. The spirit of conquest\r\nis the thing to combat. And this colossal error must be fought not in\r\nthe name of a vague and intangible fraternity, but by appealing to the\r\negoistic interest of every one. There will always be wars, because man\r\nwill never be absolutely sound-minded. At times passion and folly will\r\nprevail over reason. But the idea that conquest is the quickest means\r\nof increasing prosperity will not be everlasting, because it is\r\nutterly false.\r\n\r\nMan acts conformably to what seems to be his interest. The idea he has\r\nof this depends on his judgment, which varies every day, as do also\r\nhis desires. There is only one efficacious method of effecting social\r\nchanges: it is, to modify the desires of men, to bring them to seek\r\nnew objects, different from the old ones.\r\n\r\nA great many Germans are saying now, \"We would give up the last drop\r\nof our blood rather than surrender Alsace-Lorraine.\" Why do they say\r\nthat? Because the possession of the provinces annexed in 1871 procures\r\nthem some sort of real or imaginary satisfaction. But if, on the other\r\nhand, this annexation caused them extreme sufferings, the Germans\r\nwould say, \"We would give up the last drop of our blood to get rid of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine.\" Now, if the Germans (or any other people) could\r\ncomprehend how largely the spirit of conquest diminishes the sum of\r\ntheir enjoyment, they would certainly express themselves in language\r\nof the latter sort. The apostles of perpetual peace have therefore\r\ntaken the wrong road. Their efforts should bear upon the single object\r\nof showing that the appropriation of a neighbor's territories in no\r\nway increases the welfare of men. The pessimists answer us that it\r\nwill take many years for the uselessness of conquests to be accepted.\r\nWell, then, man shall have to continue many years in suffering; that\r\nis all there is of it.\r\n\r\nWhen will the day come that we shall find out that it is no longer\r\nadvantageous to seize a neighbor's territory? We do not know. The only\r\nthing we can affirm with absolute certainty is, that when it arrives\r\nour prosperity will be increased five or ten fold.[21]\r\n\r\nThis ctesohedonic error (lust for possession) has produced\r\nconsequences of which we proceed to speak. Just as individuals fancy\r\nthat they will be better off with larger possessions, so peoples\r\nimagine that their prosperity and happiness will be in direct\r\nproportion to the territorial extent of their country. Hence one of\r\nthe silliest aberrations of the human mind--the fatuous idolatry of\r\nsquare miles. A great many Germans still figure it out that they will\r\nhave a larger sum of happiness if their country contains 208,670\r\nsquare miles instead of 203,070.[22] Few errors are more evident.\r\nThere are thousands of examples to prove that the welfare of citizens\r\nis in no way a function of the extent of the state. If it were so,\r\nRussia would be the richest country in Europe, while everybody knows\r\nit is exactly the contrary. Taxation in that country is pushed to\r\nlimits that might almost be called absurd, and for that reason the\r\nextent of the nation is one of the greatest obstacles to its\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nAs an example to illustrate the absurdity of the idolatry of square\r\nmiles, take California, which now has 158,360 square miles,[23] and\r\n1,200,000 inhabitants. If in another century the population should\r\nrise to forty millions, it might be expedient for the good government\r\nof these men to divide the State into several. If the conservatives of\r\nthat period should declare that they would give the last drop of their\r\nblood to preserve the unity of their Commonwealth, they would be\r\nafflicted with the square-mile craze, and as foolish as the Europeans.\r\nTerritorial divisions are made for men, not men for territorial\r\ndivisions. The object enlightened patriots should pursue is not that a\r\ncertain geographical extent should be included under one name or many,\r\nbut that the divisions should conform to the aspirations and desires\r\nof the citizens. They should impose as little restraint as possible\r\nupon the economical and intellectual progress of societies.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the province of Rio Grande recently wanted to\r\nsecede from Brazil. The Government at Rio Janeiro, afflicted like\r\nother governments by the square-mile craze, would not consent to it,\r\nand hostilities broke out. Suppose the Rio Grandians had been\r\nvictorious in this war; what would have been the result? There would\r\nhave been eleven states in South America instead of ten. No modern\r\npolitical theorist would see the presage of an extraordinary calamity\r\nin such an event as that. The new state would have been recognized by\r\nthe other powers, and things would have gone on as before. But if the\r\ncentral Government, respecting the wishes of the Rio Grandians, had\r\nconsented to the secession, the empirical politicians of our time\r\nwould have affirmed that the world had been unbalanced. Yet the\r\nsituation would have been exactly the same in point of territorial\r\ndivisions--eleven independent states instead of ten. We have then to\r\nthink that, in the eyes of modern politicians, the avoidance of a war,\r\nthe fact of sparing hundreds of millions of money and thousands of\r\nhuman lives, diminishes wealth, while the waste of capital and\r\nmassacres should increase it! It would be hard to be less logical or\r\nmore absurd.\r\n\r\nThe great North American federation is composed of forty-four States,\r\nof from 1,250 square miles (the size of Rhode Island) to 265,780\r\nsquare miles (the size of Texas). If one hundred States should be\r\nestablished to-morrow of about 30,000 square miles each, there would\r\nnot necessarily follow either an increase or a diminution of the\r\nwelfare of the population. The Americans can make equally rapid\r\nprogress whether divided into forty republics or one hundred, and as\r\nslow under one division as under the other. Wealth is not a function\r\nof political divisions. So Europe is now divided into twenty-four\r\nindependent states, having from 8 to 2,100,000 square miles of\r\nterritory. If it were divided to-morrow into one hundred independent\r\nstates of 35,000 square miles each, it would as easily be poorer as\r\nricher. All would depend upon the interior organization of each of\r\nthese states, and on the relations which they might establish with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nVery few persons understand this truth. When we see the most civilized\r\nnations of Europe imagining that their welfare depends on 5,000 or\r\n6,000 square miles more or less, we stand really stupefied before the\r\npersistence of the ancient routines. The simple disarmament of three\r\nmilitary corps would procure ten times as many benefits for the German\r\npeople as the possession of Alsace-Lorraine. In short, as long as the\r\nfalse association between the territorial extent of a state and its\r\nwealth persists its progress in real wealth will be very slow.\r\n\r\nTo return to the spirit of conquest. A great many things, as we have\r\nshown in another place, are not appropriable. Foreign territories are\r\nnot so for entire nations. A military chief with his staff may be\r\nbetter off through the conquest of a country, but a nation never.\r\n\r\nWhen William of Normandy seized England he committed an act that was\r\nnot according to his interest as properly understood. He destroyed by\r\nwar a considerable quantity of wealth, and he and his barons in turn\r\nsuffered by the general diminution of welfare. These sufferings were,\r\nhowever, infinitesimal and very hard to appreciate. True views of the\r\nnature of wealth were, moreover, not accessible to the brains of men\r\nof the eleventh century. Certainly, when William and his army had\r\npossessed themselves of England they experienced an increase of wealth\r\nthat was very evident to them. The king had more revenue; every Norman\r\nsoldier got land or a reward in money, and he became richer after\r\nHastings than he had ever been before.\r\n\r\nBut what did the Roman _people_, for example, gain by the conquest of\r\nthe basin of the Mediterranean? Four or five hundred grand personages\r\ndivided the provincial lands alienated by the state among themselves,\r\nbut what benefit did the masses derive from the bloody campaigns of\r\nthe republic? The distribution of the _annone_, 280 grammes of bread\r\neach a day, given to 200,000 persons out of the 1,500,000 inhabitants\r\nof the Eternal City! Surely the Romans would have gained a great deal\r\nmore by working themselves than by pillaging other nations!\r\n\r\nThings are exactly the same now. In 1871 twenty-eight persons received\r\nfrom the Emperor William donations forming a total of $3,000,000. But\r\nwhat benefit did the German _people_ derive from the conquest of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine? None. Dividing the 3,600,000 acres of that province\r\namong the 6,400,000 families that were living in Germany at the time\r\nof the Treaty of Frankfort would make two and a half acres each. This\r\nis not opulence. Of the 5,000,000,000 of francs extorted from France\r\nas damage for the expenses of the war there remained 3,896,250,000\r\nfrancs, which, divided among 6,400,000 families, represent a gain of\r\n609 francs, or about $121.80 per family--hardly enough to live\r\nscantily upon for four months; and this was the most lucrative war of\r\nwhich history makes mention! Consider, further, at what amount of\r\nsacrifice these $121.80 have been gained. In 1870 the military\r\nexpenses of the North German Confederation and the four southern\r\nstates amounted to 349,000,000 francs a year. They now exceed\r\n795,000,000, and in another year (from 1894) will exceed 870,000,000.\r\nHere, then, is an increase of 521,000,000 francs, or a charge of 60\r\nfrancs per family. As 609 francs, even at five per cent, will only\r\nreturn 30 francs, we have here a clear loss of 30 francs (or $6) a\r\nfamily per year. It thus appears that the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine\r\nwould have been a bad speculation, even if the French indemnity had\r\nbeen distributed in equal parts among all the German families. But, in\r\nfact, it has not been so; so that the 60 francs of supplementary\r\nexpenditure are paid without any compensation.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine was not dictated\r\nsolely by sordid economical considerations. Other interests, purer and\r\nmore elevated, stir the hearts of modern nations. But we ask, Is it\r\ngrand, noble, and generous to hold unwilling populations under the\r\nyoke? On the contrary, it is most base, vile, and degrading. It is\r\ndifficult to comprehend how brutal conquest can still arouse\r\nenthusiasm. Ancient survivals and routines must for a time have\r\nsuppressed all our reflective faculties.\r\n\r\nSuppose, again, 3,000,000 German soldiers should penetrate into Russia\r\nand should gain a complete victory: how would they apportion the\r\nterritory? The parts here would indeed be larger--Russia contains\r\n5,471,500,000 acres. But a third of this territory, at least, is\r\ndesert; subtracting this, there remain about 3,600,000,000 acres,\r\nwhich, divided among the German families, would give about 5-1/2 acres\r\nto each. It may be asked, How will the conquerors take possession of\r\nthese lands? If each family delegated only one of its members, that\r\nwould suppose an exodus of 6,400,000 men, going to scatter themselves\r\nfrom the Vistula to the Amoor. What a disturbance so great an\r\nemigration would make in the economical condition of Germany!\r\nMoreover, would every German colonist be willing to leave his home,\r\nhis family, his business, and all his cherished associations, to\r\ninstall himself on the banks of the Volga, in Siberia, the Caucasus,\r\nor Central Asia? He would acquire 5-1/2 acres, more or less, it is\r\ntrue, but is it certain that that would bring him more than it would\r\ntake from him? On the other hand, if the Germans should have their\r\nshares administered by agents chosen from among the natives, what\r\ncomplications, what annoyances would arise! The Germans might perhaps\r\nget rid of these difficulties by selling their lands. But what price\r\ncould they command, with 3,600,000,000 acres all put into the market\r\nat once? Who would buy it? It is only necessary to look at the facts\r\nat close range (besides a mass of difficulties we have not spoken of)\r\nto comprehend that the direct appropriation of the territory of one\r\ngreat modern nation by individuals of another does not enter into the\r\ndomain of realizable things.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of the landed properties is therefore chimerical.\r\nThe confiscation of personal goods to the profit of the conquerors\r\nalso offers insurmountable difficulties. There remain the public\r\nriches. Few countries could pay indemnities of 5,000,000,000 francs.\r\nBut even that colossal sum becomes absurdly insufficient when it is\r\nequally divided among millions of takers.\r\n\r\nAll this is most plainly evident, and yet the spirit of conquest and\r\nthe fatuous idolatry of square miles are more active than ever in the\r\nold world of Europe.\r\n\r\nLet us see now what this mad aberration costs. We will begin with the\r\ndirect losses.\r\n\r\nA whole continent of our globe, twice as large as the European\r\ncontinent, having 8,000,000 square miles and 80,000,000\r\ninhabitants--North America--is divided into three political dominions:\r\nCanada, the United States, and Mexico. As none of these countries\r\ncovets the territory of the other, there are on this vast continent\r\nonly 114,453 soldiers and marines, one military man for 700\r\ninhabitants, while in Europe there is one for 108. The American\r\nproportion would give 514,286 men for all the European armies. As\r\nthere are no savage elements in Europe to be restrained by arms, half\r\nof the North American contingent ought to be enough to maintain\r\ninternal order there. Europe needs only 300,000 soldiers at most; all\r\nthe others are supported in deference to the idolatry for square\r\nmiles. This additional military force exceeds 3,300,000 men, and costs\r\n4,508,000,000 francs ($901,600,000) a year. And this is the direct\r\nloss entailed by the spirit of conquest; and yet it is trifling as\r\ncompared with the indirect losses.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are 3,300,000 men under the flags. If they were not\r\nsoldiers, and were following lucrative occupations and earning only\r\n1,000 francs ($200) a head, they might produce $760,000,000. The\r\n$900,000,000 absorbed now by military expenditures would bring five\r\nper cent if invested in agricultural and industrial enterprises. This\r\nwould make another $45,000,000. The twenty-eight days of the reserves\r\nare worth at least $40,000,000. Here, then, is an absolutely palpable\r\nsum of $845,000,000. But what a number of colossal losses escape all\r\nvaluation! Capital produces capital. If $1,800,000,000 were saved\r\nevery year from military expenses and poured into industrial\r\nenterprises, they would produce benefits beyond our power to estimate.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a correct appreciation of the evils derived from the spirit\r\nof conquest, we must take a glance at the past. We need not go back of\r\nthe middle ages, from which we shall only take a few examples. The\r\ndestruction of wealth wrought by war has been nowhere so frightful as\r\nin Spain. In 1073 the Castilians tried to capture Toledo from the\r\nMoors. With the military engines of the time it was impossible to\r\naccomplish the purpose by a direct attack on a place so admirably\r\nfortified by Nature and man; so the King of Castile, Alfonso VI,\r\nravaged the country for three successive years, destroyed the crops,\r\nharassed the people and the cattle, and, in short, made a desert\r\naround the old capital of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\nFrom 1110 till 1815--seven hundred and five years--there were two\r\nhundred and seventy-two years of war between France and England. Now\r\nthe two nations have lived in peace for eighty years, and it has not\r\nprevented them from prospering. What better proof could we have that\r\nall the previous wars were useless?\r\n\r\nWe need not speak of the massacres of the Thirty Years' War, by which\r\na third of the population of Germany perished, or of the frightful\r\nhecatombs of Napoleon I, for these facts are in everybody's memory. We\r\nshall confine our attention to the losses caused by the spirit of\r\nconquest, at least since the Thirty Years' War. Here, again, we shall\r\nproceed by analogies. From 1700 to 1815 England expended 175,000,000\r\nfrancs ($35,000,000) a year for war. Suppose that the expenditures of\r\nthe other great powers--Germany (including Prussia), Austria, Spain,\r\nFrance, and Russia--were similar. This would make, without counting\r\nthe smaller states, 1,050,000,000 francs ($210,000,000) for all\r\nEurope. Still, as war was not so costly to Russia or Prussia as to\r\nEngland, we will reduce this figure one fourth. We shall then have,\r\nbetween 1700 and 1815, an annual expenditure of 787,500,000 francs\r\n($157,500,000).[24] Let us estimate the cost of the wars of the\r\nseventeenth century at a slightly lower sum, putting it at only\r\n500,000,000 francs (or $100,000,000) a year for all Europe. That would\r\nmake 41,000,000,000 francs ($8,200,000,000), or for the entire period\r\nfrom 1618 to 1815, 131,562,500,000 francs ($26,312,500,000).\r\n\r\nWe have more certain data for the nineteenth century. The Crimean,\r\nItalian, Schleswig-Holstein, and American Wars, and the war of 1866,\r\ncost 46,830,000,000 francs ($9,366,000,000).[25] The war of France\r\ncost 15,000,000,000 francs ($3,000,000,000) at the lowest; that of\r\n1877 at least 4,000,000,000 francs ($800,000,000). Add for the war of\r\nGreek independence, the French and Austrian expeditions to Spain and\r\nNaples, the Polish war of 1830, the Turco-Russian war of 1828-'29, and\r\nthe wars of 1848, 3,000,000,000 francs ($600,000,000) more--a very\r\nmoderate estimate; we reach a total sum of 68,830,000,000 francs\r\n($13,766,000,000). None of the extra-European conflicts are comprised\r\nin this figure; neither the war between Russia and Persia in 1827,\r\nthat of Mehemet Ali against the Turks, the struggle against the\r\nmountaineers of the Caucasus and against the Arabs in Algeria, or the\r\nEnglish campaign in Afghanistan--concerning all of which we have no\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nCounting only the figures we have been able to obtain, we have for the\r\nperiod from 1618 till our own days 200,392,000,000 francs\r\n($50,078,500,000) as the bare direct losses by war, which have had to\r\nbe defrayed by the budgets of the different European states. How shall\r\nwe calculate the indirect losses? Between 1618 and 1648 Germany lost\r\n6,000,000 inhabitants. The destruction of property was prodigious, the\r\nravages were frightful. How can we represent them in money? It is\r\nabsolutely impossible. There are, too, some expenses arising from the\r\nspirit of conquest that almost wholly escape observation. We shall\r\ngive only two examples of them.\r\n\r\nThe ctesohedonic fallacy (lust for possession) raged in the middle\r\nages between the nearest neighbors. No city could offer any security\r\nunless it was surrounded by strong walls. Since these required great\r\nexpenditures, they could not be rebuilt every few days. For this\r\nreason space was greatly economized in the cities, and their streets\r\nwere very narrow. At a later period, when security had become\r\nestablished, the walls were demolished. In our own time the needs of\r\nhygiene and luxury have urged the opening of broad ways in the ancient\r\nEuropean cities. It has been necessary to buy houses and demolish them\r\nin order to create the grand modern avenues. There would have been no\r\nwalls in the middle ages except for the spirit of conquest, and the\r\nbroad streets would have been established then, as has been done in\r\nthe new cities of Russia and America. To pierce these new avenues,\r\nParis, for example, has had to contract debts, the annual interest on\r\nwhich amounts to at least 50,000,000 or 60,000,000 francs ($10,000,000\r\nto $12,000,000). This expense should be charged to the account of the\r\nspirit of conquest. But nobody has ever thought of attributing these\r\n50,000,000 or 60,000,000 of the city budget to military waste. And how\r\nmany other cities are in the same situation? Another example: during\r\nsix centuries France and England were trying to take provinces from\r\none another. Hence a permanent hostility existed between the two\r\nnations. Later on the circumstances changed, but by virtue of the\r\nroutine inherent in the human mind the old resentments remained,\r\nthough the motive for them had gone. To thwart the progress of France\r\nwas considered a patriotic duty by such English ministers as Lord\r\nPalmerston. In 1855 M. de Lesseps formed a company to construct the\r\nSuez Canal. As M. de Lesseps was a Frenchman, Lord Palmerston and the\r\nBritish Cabinet thought themselves obligated to oppose his project,\r\nand their opposition cost about 200,000,000 francs ($40,000,000). The\r\ncanal might have been constructed then for that sum, but in\r\nconsequence of the machinations of the English it cost 400,000,000\r\nfrancs ($80,000,000). Who has ever thought of charging that loss to\r\nthe account of the spirit of conquest? Nevertheless, that is where it\r\nbelongs.[26]\r\n\r\nThe indirect losses of war defy valuation. But the matter may be\r\nlooked at from another point of view: that of the profits which they\r\nprevent being made. The American war against secession cost the\r\ntreasury of both combatants $7,000,000,000. Now, if, without speaking\r\nof the destruction of property,[27] we only consider the benefits\r\nnonrealized, the most moderate estimates make them $12,000,000,000\r\nfor the year 1890,[28] and the figure goes on every year increasing in\r\ngeometrical progression.\r\n\r\nFurther, the debts must be considered. The largest proportion of them\r\nare consequences of the idolatry for square miles. This entails an\r\nannual expenditure of $644,800,000 which we should not have to bear\r\nwere it not for the ctesohedonic fallacy.[29]\r\n\r\nYet another factor has so far not been mentioned: men. The wars of the\r\nlast three centuries have cost, at the lowest figure, 30,000,000 or\r\n40,000,000 victims. Some authors raise this very moderate estimate to\r\n20,000,000 per century. Without speaking of the frightful sufferings\r\nof these unfortunates, they represent an enormous capital.[30] Let us\r\nadd, further, that these men, if they had not been killed, might have\r\nhad children that now have no existence. Without the wars of Napoleon\r\nI and Napoleon III Europe would have had 45,000,000 more inhabitants\r\nthan it has, and they might have been producing $2,700,000 a year.[31]\r\n\r\nWe hope the reader will admit, after these considerations, that the\r\nindirect losses of war certainly exceed the direct ones. Still,\r\nadhering to our method of underrating rather than exaggerating, we\r\nwill regard them as equal. We may therefore affirm that the spirit of\r\nconquest has cost, since 1618, in the group of European nations alone,\r\nthe trifle of $80,156,800,000. Suppose we should go farther back--into\r\nantiquity even? Imagination refuses to set down the gigantic sums.\r\n\r\nThis is not all; the cost of civil wars has to be counted, for the\r\nconquest of power within the state is attended by massacres which are\r\noften not inferior to those of foreign ones. The chiefs of the Roman\r\nlegions contending for the empire carried on as bloody and costly\r\ncampaigns against their rivals as against the Parthians or the\r\nGermans. The war between Paris and Versailles in 1871 occasioned\r\nconsiderable expenditures, not to speak of the indirect losses, which\r\nwere immense. We are, unfortunately, absolutely without data\r\nconcerning the cost of civil wars, and shall have to satisfy ourselves\r\nwith what we have been able to obtain concerning foreign wars.\r\n$80,156,800,000 used up in two centuries! We need not go outside of\r\nthis for a solution of the social question. Without this unrestricted\r\nwaste the earth would now have ten times more wheat, sugar, linen,\r\ncotton, meat, wool, etc.; there would be ten times as many houses on\r\nthe globe, and they would be more spacious, better warmed, and better\r\nventilated; a network of roads, with frequent mails, would cover\r\nEurope, Asia, Africa, and America. In short, if conquest had been\r\nconsidered an evil, even during only two centuries, our wealth would\r\nhave been infinitely superior to what we now possess. But if the\r\nctesohedonic fallacy had been seen through by the civilized societies\r\nof the Roman period, the face of the earth would have been very\r\ndifferent from what it is. Our planet would have been completely\r\nappropriated to the satisfaction of our wants. Waste lands would have\r\nbeen tilled and swamps dried; everywhere that a drop of water could be\r\nmade to serve for irrigation it would have been applied to that use.\r\nMagnificent cities, inhabited by active and industrious populations,\r\nwould have arisen in numerous places where now are found only briers\r\nand stones. In short, we should have been able to see men now, in the\r\nyear of grace 1894, as we expect to see them in three or four thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe past can not be changed. We have laid bare the unhappy\r\nconsequences of our ancient errors simply in order to show how we can\r\nassure our welfare in the future. As long as the spirit of conquest\r\nrages among men, misery will be the lot of our species. Our savage and\r\nbarbarous ancestors did not know what we know. Attila, Tamerlane, and\r\neven Matabele, a chief of our own times, might be excused for fancying\r\nthat conquest increases the wealth of the conquerors; but a Moltke and\r\na Prince Bismarck can not. The masses are still too deeply imbued with\r\nmilitary vainglory. Happily, they are beginning to open their\r\neyes.--_Translated for the Popular Science Monthly from the book Les\r\nGaspillages des Sociétés Modernes_ (The Wastes of Modern Societies),\r\nParis, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] The pessimists are further mistaken. The idea that conquest is\r\ndisastrous, even to the conqueror, is much more widespread in modern\r\nsocieties than is generally thought. But social reflexes urge the\r\nmasses to obey their chief blindly. It requires only a Gothic\r\nspirit--like Bismarck, for example--to set a whole army in motion, and\r\nmake it do things which every officer and every soldier would condemn\r\nas a personal act.\r\n\r\n[22] The difference is the extent of Alsace-Lorraine.\r\n\r\n[23] About the extent of the British Isles, Belgium, Holland, and\r\nSwitzerland combined.\r\n\r\n[24] See Seeley's Expansion of England, p. 21. This figure is very\r\nmoderate. Between 1802 and 1813 France alone spent 498,000,000 francs\r\n($99,600,000) a year. See Laroque, La Guerre et les Armées\r\npermanentes, Paris, 1870, p. 203.\r\n\r\n[25] See P. Leroy-Beaulieu, Recherches économiques sur les Guerres\r\ncontemporaines, Paris, p. 181.\r\n\r\n[26] We may refer here to another loss which has never been thought of\r\ntill now. It was long fancied that wealth could be acquired more\r\nrapidly by war than by work; consequently, conquest seeming to be the\r\nmost rapid and therefore most efficacious way, was honored, and labor,\r\nappearing to be a slower process, was despised. In our days a large\r\nnumber of descendants of the knights of the middle ages retain the\r\nideas of their ancestors and look upon labor as degrading.\r\nHence thousands of aristocrats do nothing, but remain social\r\ngood-for-nothings, retarding the increase of wealth by their\r\ninactivity.\r\n\r\n[27] Sherman, in his march from Atlanta to Savannah alone, destroyed\r\nmore than $400,000,000. The cotton famine occasioned by this war cost\r\nGreat Britain a loss of $480,000,000. Who has ever thought of charging\r\nthis against militarism?\r\n\r\n[28] See E. Reclus, Nouvelle geographie universelle (French edition),\r\nvol. xvi, p. 810.\r\n\r\n[29] A justification of this figure may be found in my Luttes entre\r\nles sociétés humaines, p. 220.\r\n\r\n[30] A half million negroes are massacred every year in Africa in the\r\ntribal wars, which also are caused by the ctesohedonic fallacy.\r\nSuppose each one of them might have earned $20 a year. Capitalized at\r\nfour per cent, this sum would have amounted to $400,000,000.\r\n\r\n[31] See my Luttes, p. 228. Let us say, in passing, that we owe our\r\nexisting savagery partly to the ctesohedonic fallacy. When we think\r\nthat the most rapid way of enriching ourselves is by seizing our\r\nneighbor's territories, the fewer defenders that territory has, the\r\nbetter. So all pretended political geniuses glorify themselves on\r\nhaving killed the largest number of their fellow-men. Cæsar boasted of\r\nhaving killed a million and a half of Gauls. At the moment of writing\r\nthese lines a terrible accident has occurred at Santander. Hundreds of\r\npersons were killed by the explosion of a boat loaded with dynamite.\r\nGreat pity was expressed for the victims. Collections for their\r\nbenefit were taken in France. Suppose France and Spain were now at\r\nwar. If somebody had blown up some thousand Spaniards in a fortress,\r\nwe should have sung _Te Deums_. Oh, man's logic!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Until within a few years the field for the study of glaciers\r\n     and their action has been the Alps; but now, as Prof. H.L.\r\n     Fairchild said in his address as chairman of the Geological\r\n     Section of the American Association, the North American\r\n     continent is recognized as a field of the greatest activity,\r\n     both in the past and at the present time; and, moreover, it\r\n     presents types of glaciers not known in Europe. It must\r\n     therefore become the Mecca of foreign students of glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT HISTORY OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION.[32]\r\n\r\nBY J. NORMAN LOCKYER, K.C.B., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nI must come back from this excursion to call your attention to the\r\nyear 1845, in which one of the germs of our college first saw the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWhat was the condition of England in 1845? Her universities had\r\ndegenerated into _hauts lycées_. With regard to the university\r\nteaching, I may state that even as late as the late fifties a senior\r\nwrangler--I had the story from himself--came to London from Cambridge\r\nexpressly to walk about the streets to study crystals, prisms, and the\r\nlike in the optician's windows. Of laboratories in the universities\r\nthere were none; of science teaching in the schools there was none;\r\nthere was no organization for training science teachers.\r\n\r\nIf an artisan wished to improve his knowledge he had only the moribund\r\nMechanics' Institutes to fall back upon.\r\n\r\nThe nation which then was renowned for its utilization of waste\r\nmaterial products allowed its mental products to remain undeveloped.\r\n\r\nThere was no minister of instruction, no councilors with a knowledge\r\nof the national scientific needs, no organized secondary or primary\r\ninstruction. We lacked then everything that Germany had equipped\r\nherself with in the matter of scientific industries.\r\n\r\nDid this matter? Was it more than a mere abstract question of a want\r\nof perfection?\r\n\r\nIt mattered very much! From all quarters came the cry that the\r\nnational industries were being undermined in consequence of the more\r\ncomplete application of scientific methods to those of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe chemical industries were the first to feel this, and because\r\nEngland was then the seat of most of the large chemical works.[33]\r\n\r\nVery few chemists were employed in these chemical works. There were in\r\ncases some so-called chemists at about bricklayer's wages--not much of\r\nan inducement to study chemistry; even if there had been practical\r\nlaboratories, where it could have been properly learned. Hence, when\r\nefficient men were wanted they were got from abroad--i.e., from\r\nGermany, or the richer English had to go abroad themselves.\r\n\r\nAt this time we had, fortunately for us, in England, in very high\r\nplace, a German fully educated by all that could be learned at one of\r\nthe best-equipped modern German universities, where he studied both\r\nscience and the fine arts. I refer to the Prince Consort. From that\r\nyear to his death he was the fountain of our English educational\r\nrenaissance, drawing to himself men like Playfair, Clark, and De la\r\nBeche; knowing what we lacked, he threw himself into the breach. This\r\ncollege is one of the many things the nation owes to him. His service\r\nto his adopted country, and the value of the institutions he helped to\r\ninaugurate, are by no means even yet fully recognized, because those\r\nfrom whom national recognition full and ample should have come, were,\r\nand to a great extent still are, the products of the old system of\r\nmiddle-age scholasticism which his clear vision recognized was\r\nincapable by itself of coping with the conditions of modern civilized\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1845 that the influence of the Prince Consort began\r\nto be felt. Those who know most of the conditions of science and art\r\nthen and now, know best how beneficial that influence was in both\r\ndirections; my present purpose, however, has only reference to\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe College of Chemistry was founded in 1845, first as a private\r\ninstitution; the School of Mines was established by the Government in\r\n1851.\r\n\r\nIn the next year, in the speech from the throne at the opening of\r\nParliament, her Majesty spoke as follows: \"The advancement of the fine\r\narts and of practical science will be readily recognized by you as\r\nworthy the attention of a great and enlightened nation. I have\r\ndirected that a comprehensive scheme shall be laid before you having\r\nin view the promotion of these objects, toward which I invite your aid\r\nand co-operation.\"\r\n\r\nStrange words these from the lips of an English sovereign!\r\n\r\nThe Government of this country was made at last to recognize the great\r\nfactors of a peaceful nation's prosperity, and to reverse a policy\r\nwhich has been as disastrous to us as if they had insisted upon our\r\nnaval needs being supplied by local effort as they were in Queen\r\nElizabeth's time.\r\n\r\nEngland has practically lost a century; one need not be a prophet to\r\nforesee that in another century's time our education and our\r\nscientific establishments will be as strongly organized by the British\r\nGovernment as the navy itself.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the comprehensive scheme referred to by her Majesty, the\r\nDepartment of Science and Art was organized in 1853, and in the\r\namalgamation of the College of Chemistry and the School of Mines we\r\nhave the germ of our present institution.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only science school founded by the Government.\r\nThe Royal School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering was\r\nestablished by the department at the request of the Lords\r\nCommissioners of the Admiralty, \"with a view of providing especially\r\nfor the education of shipbuilding officers for her Majesty's service,\r\nand promoting the general study of the science of shipbuilding and\r\nnaval engineering.\" It was not limited to persons in the Queen's\r\nservice, and it was opened on November 1, 1864. The present Royal\r\nCollege of Science was built for it and the College of Chemistry. In\r\n1873 the school was transferred to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich,\r\nand this accident enabled the teaching from Jermyn Street to be\r\ntransferred and proper practical instruction to be given at South\r\nKensington. The Lords of the Admiralty expressed their entire\r\nsatisfaction with the manner in which the instruction had been carried\r\non at South Kensington; and well they might, for in a memorandum\r\nsubmitted to the Lord President in 1887, the president and council of\r\nthe Institute of Naval Architects state: \"When the department dealt\r\nwith the highest class of education in naval architecture by assisting\r\nin founding and by carrying on the School of Naval Architecture at\r\nSouth Kensington, the success which attended their efforts was\r\nphenomenal, the great majority of the rising men in the profession\r\nhaving been educated at that institution.\"\r\n\r\nHere I again point out, both with regard to the School of Mines, the\r\nSchool of Naval Architecture, and the later Normal School, that it was\r\nstern need that was in question, as in Egypt in old times.\r\n\r\nOf the early history of the college I need say nothing after the\r\naddresses of my colleagues, Professors Judd and Roberts-Austen, but I\r\nam anxious to refer to some parts of its present organization and\r\ntheir effect on our national educational growth in some directions.\r\n\r\nIt was after 1870 that our institution gradually began to take its\r\nplace as a normal school--that is, that the teaching of teachers\r\nformed an important part of its organization, because in that year the\r\nnewly established departments, having found that the great national\r\nwant then was teachers of science, began to take steps to secure them.\r\nExaminations had been inaugurated in 1859, but they were for\r\noutsiders, conferring certificates and a money reward on the most\r\ncompetent teachers tested in this way. These examinations were really\r\ncontrolled by our school, for Tyndall, Hofmann, Ramsay, Huxley, and\r\nWarington Smyth, the first professors, were also the first examiners.\r\n\r\nVery interesting is it to look back at that first year's work, the\r\nfirst cast of the new educational net. After what I have said about\r\nthe condition of chemistry and the establishment of the College of\r\nChemistry in 1845, you will not be surprised to hear that Dr. Hofmann\r\nwas the most favored--he had forty-four students.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley found one student to tackle his questions, and he\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nProfessors Ramsay and Warington Smyth had three each, but the two\r\nthrees only made five; for both lists were headed by the name of\r\n\r\n                          Judd, John W.,\r\n                                  Wesleyan Training College,\r\n                                                     Westminster.\r\n\r\nOur present dean was caught in the first haul.\r\n\r\nThese examinations were continued till 1866, and upward of six hundred\r\nteachers obtained certificates, some of them in several subjects.\r\n\r\nHaving secured the teachers, the next thing the department did was to\r\nutilize them. This was done in 1859 by the establishment of the\r\nscience classes throughout the country, which are, I think, the only\r\npart of our educational system which even the Germans envy us. The\r\nteaching might go on in schools, attics or cellars, there was neither\r\nage limit nor distinction of sex or creed.\r\n\r\nLet me insist upon the fact that from the outset practical work was\r\nencouraged by payments for apparatus, and that latterly the\r\nexaminations themselves, in some of the subjects, have been practical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe number of students under instruction in science classes under\r\nexamined in the first year in which local examinations were held was\r\n442; the number in 1897 was 202,496. The number of candidates examined\r\nin the first year in which local examinations were held was 650, who\r\nworked 1,000 papers; in 1897 the number was 106,185, who worked\r\n159,724 papers, chemistry alone sending in 28,891 papers, mathematics\r\n24,764, and physiography 16,879.\r\n\r\nThe total number of individual students under instruction in science\r\nclasses under the department from 1859 to 1897 inclusive has been,\r\napproximately, 2,000,000. Of these about 900,000 came forward for\r\nexamination, the total number of papers worked by them being\r\n3,195,170.\r\n\r\nNow why have I brought these statistics before you?\r\n\r\nBecause from 1861 onward the chief rewards of the successful students\r\nhave been scholarships and exhibitions held in this college; a system\r\nadopted in the hope that in this way the numbers of perfectly trained\r\nscience teachers might be increased, so that the science classes\r\nthroughout the country might go on from strength to strength.\r\n\r\nThe royal exhibitions date from 1863, the national scholars from 1884.\r\nThe free studentships were added later.\r\n\r\nThe strict connection between the science classes throughout the\r\ncountry and our college will be gathered from the following statement,\r\nwhich refers to the present time:\r\n\r\nTwenty-one royal exhibitions--seven open each year--four to the Royal\r\nCollege of Science, London, and three to the Royal College of Science,\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nSixty-six national scholarships--twenty-two open each year--tenable,\r\nat the option of the holder, at either the Royal College of Science,\r\nLondon, or the Royal College of Science, Dublin.\r\n\r\nEighteen free studentships--six open each year--to the Royal College\r\nof Science, London.\r\n\r\nA royal exhibition entitles the holder to free admission to lectures\r\nand laboratories, and to instruction during the course for the\r\nassociateship--about three years--in the Royal College of Science,\r\nLondon, or the Royal College of Science, Dublin, with maintenance and\r\ntraveling allowances.\r\n\r\nA national scholarship entitles the holder to free admission to\r\nlectures and laboratories and to instruction during the course of the\r\nassociateship--about three years--at either the Royal College of\r\nScience, London, or the Royal College of Science, Dublin, at the\r\noption of the holder, with maintenance and traveling allowances.\r\n\r\nA free studentship entitles the holder to free admission to the\r\nlectures and laboratories and to instruction during the course for the\r\nassociateship--about three years--in the Royal College of Science,\r\nLondon, but not to any maintenance or traveling allowance.\r\n\r\nBesides the above students who have been successful in the\r\nexaminations of the science classes, a limited number (usually about\r\nsixty) of teachers, and of students in science classes who intend to\r\nbecome science teachers, are admitted free for a term or session to\r\nthe courses of instruction. They may be called upon to pass an\r\nentrance examination. Of these, there are two categories--those who\r\ncome to learn and those who remain to teach; some of the latter may be\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nBesides all these, those holding Whitworth scholarships--the award of\r\nwhich is decided by the science examinations--can, and some do, spend\r\nthe year covered by the exhibition at the college.\r\n\r\nIn this way, then, is the _École Normale_ side of our institution\r\nbuilt up.\r\n\r\nThe number of Government students in the college in 1872 was 25; in\r\n1886 it was 113; and in 1897 it was 186.\r\n\r\nThe total number of students who passed through the college from\r\n1882-'83 to 1896-'97, inclusive, was 4,145. Of these, 1,966 were\r\nGovernment students. The number who obtained the associateship of the\r\nRoyal School of Mines from 1851 to 1881 was 198, of whom 39 were\r\nGovernment students, and of the Royal College of Science and Royal\r\nSchool of Mines from 1882 to 1897 the number was 525, of whom 323 were\r\nGovernment students. Of this total of 362 Government students 94 were\r\nscience teachers in training.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Whitworth scholarships, which, like the\r\nexhibitions, depend upon success at the yearly examinations throughout\r\nthe country, I may state that six have held their scholarships at the\r\ncollege for at least a part of the scholarship period, and three\r\nothers were already associates.\r\n\r\nSo much for the prizemen we have with us. I next come to the teachers\r\nin training who come to us. The number of teachers in training who\r\nhave passed through the college from 1872 to 1897, inclusive, is about\r\nsix hundred; on an average they attended about two years each. The\r\nnumber in the session 1872-'73, when they were first admitted, was\r\nsixteen, the number in 1885-'86 was fifty, and in 1896-'97 sixty.\r\nThese have not as a rule taught science classes previously, but before\r\nadmission they give an undertaking that they intend to teach. In the\r\nearlier years some did not carry out this undertaking, doubtless\r\nbecause of the small demand for teachers of science at that time. But\r\nwe have changed all that. With but very few exceptions, all the\r\nteachers so trained now at once begin teaching, and not necessarily in\r\nclasses under the department. It is worthy of note, too, that many\r\nroyal exhibitioners and national scholars, although under no\r\nobligation to do so, also take up science teaching. It is probable\r\nthat of all the Government students now who pass out of the college\r\neach year not less than three fourths become teachers. The total\r\nnumber of teachers of science engaged in classes under the department\r\nalone at the present time is about six thousand.\r\n\r\nI have not yet exhausted what our college does for the national\r\nefforts in aiding the teaching of science.\r\n\r\nWhen you, gentlemen, leave us about the end of June for your\r\nwell-earned holidays, a new task falls upon your professors in the\r\nshape of summer courses to teachers of science classes brought up by\r\nthe department from all parts of the four kingdoms to profit by the\r\nwealth of apparatus in the college and museum, and the practical work\r\nwhich it alone renders possible.\r\n\r\nThe number of science teachers who have thus attended the summer\r\ncourses reaches 6,200, but as many of these have attended more than\r\none course, the number of separate persons is not so large.\r\n\r\nRESEARCH.--From time to time balances arise in the scholarship fund\r\nowing to some of the national scholarships or royal exhibitions being\r\nvacated before the full time for which they are tenable has expired.\r\nScholarships are formed from these balances and awarded among those\r\nstudents who, having completed the full course of training for the\r\nassociateship, desire to study for another year at the college. _It is\r\nunderstood that the fourth year is to be employed in research in the\r\nsubject of the associateship._\r\n\r\nThe gaining of one of the Remanet scholarships, not more than two on\r\nthe average annually, referred to, furnishes really the only means by\r\nwhich deserving students are enabled to pursue research in the\r\ncollege; as, although a professor has the power to nominate a student\r\nto a free place in his laboratory, very few of the most deserving\r\nstudents are able to avail themselves of the privilege owing to want\r\nof means.\r\n\r\nThe department only very rarely sends students up as teachers in\r\ntraining for research work, but only those who intend making teaching\r\ntheir profession are eligible for these studentships.\r\n\r\nI trust that at some future day, when we get our new buildings--it is\r\nimpossible to do more than we do till we get them--more facilities for\r\nresearch may be provided, and even an extension of time allowed for it\r\nif necessary. I see no reason why some of the 1851 exhibition\r\nscholarships should not be awarded to students of this college, but to\r\nbe eligible they must have published a research. Research should\r\nnaturally form part of the work of the teachers in training who are\r\nnot brought up here merely to effect an economy in the teaching staff.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, in brief, are some of our normal-school attributes. I\r\nthink any one who knows the facts must acknowledge that the\r\norganization has justified itself not only by what it has done, but\r\nalso by the outside activities it has set in motion. It is true that\r\nwith regard to the system of examining school candidates by means of\r\npapers sent down from London, the department was anticipated by the\r\nCollege of Preceptors in 1853, and by Oxford and Cambridge in 1858;\r\nbut the action of 1861, when science classes open to everybody, was\r\ncopied by Oxford and Cambridge in 1869. The department's teachers got\r\nto work in 1860, but the so-called \"University Extension Movement\"\r\ndates only from 1873, and only quite recently have summer courses been\r\nstarted at Oxford and Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe chemical and physical laboratories, small though they were in the\r\ndepartment's schools, were in operation long before any practical work\r\nin these subjects was done either at Oxford or Cambridge. When the\r\ncollege laboratories began, about 1853, they existed practically\r\nalone. From one point of view we should rejoice that they are now\r\nthird rate. I think it would be wrong of me not to call your attention\r\nto the tenacity, the foresight, the skill, the unswerving patience,\r\nexhibited by those upon whom has fallen the duty of sailing the good\r\nship \"Scientific Instruction,\" launched, as I have stated, out upon a\r\nsea which was certain, from the history I have brought before you, to\r\nbe full of opposing currents.\r\n\r\nI have had a statement prepared showing what the most distinguished of\r\nour old students and of those who have succeeded in the department's\r\nexaminations are now doing. The statement shows that those who have\r\nbeen responsible for our share in the progress of scientific\r\ninstruction have no cause to be ashamed.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.--I have referred previously to the questions of secondary\r\neducation and of a true London University, soon, let us hope, to be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nOur college will be the first institution to gain from a proper system\r\nof secondary education, for the reason that scientific studies gain\r\nenormously by the results of literary culture, without which we can\r\nneither learn so thoroughly nor teach so effectively as one could\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nTo keep a proper mind-balance, engaged as we are here continuously in\r\nscientific thought, literature is essential, as essential as bodily\r\nexercise, and if I may be permitted to give you a little advice, I\r\nshould say organize your athletics as students of the college, and\r\norganize your literature as individuals. I do not think you will gain\r\nso much by studying scientific books when away from here as you will\r\nby reading English and foreign classics, including a large number of\r\nworks of imagination; and study French and German also in your\r\nholidays by taking short trips abroad.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the university. If it be properly organized, in the\r\nlight of the latest German experience, with complete science and\r\ntechnical faculties of the highest order, it should certainly insist\r\nupon annexing the School of Mines portion of our institution; the past\r\nhistory of the school is so creditable that the new university for its\r\nown sake should insist upon such a course. It would be absurd, in the\r\ncase of a nation which depends so much on mining and metallurgy, if\r\nthese subjects were not taught in the chief national university, as\r\nthe University of London must become.\r\n\r\nBut the London University, like the Paris University, if the little\r\nhistory of science teaching I have given you is of any value, must\r\nleave our normal college alone, at all events till we have more than\r\ntrebled our present supply of science teachers.\r\n\r\nBut while it would be madness to abolish such an institution as our\r\nnormal school, and undesirable if not impossible to graft it on the\r\nnew university, our school, like its elder sister in Paris, should be\r\nenabled to gain by each increase in the teaching power of the\r\nuniversity. The students on the scientific side of the Paris school,\r\nin spite of the fact that their studies and researches are looked\r\nafter by fourteen professors entitled Maîtres de Conférences, attend\r\ncertain of the courses at the Sorbonne and the Collége de France, and\r\nthis is one of the reasons why many of the men and researches which\r\nhave enriched French science hail from the _École Normale_.\r\n\r\nOne word more. As I have pointed out, the French _École Normale_ was\r\nthe result of a revolution; I may now add that France since Sedan has\r\nbeen doing, and in a tremendous fashion, what, as I have told you,\r\nPrussia did after Jena. Let us not wait for disastrous defeats, either\r\non the field of battle or of industry, to develop to the utmost our\r\nscientific establishments and so take our proper and complete place\r\namong the nations.--_Nature._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] An address delivered at the Royal College of Science on October\r\n6, 1898.\r\n\r\n[33] Perkin.

Does the child learn better from the mother or from the\r\ngrammarian? Without doubt, from the mother, according to the mother\r\nmethod. If this is so, must we use the example of the mother or of the\r\ngrammarian when we are to begin the teaching of a foreign language? Is\r\nthere any reason why a foreign tongue should be otherwise taught than\r\nthe mother tongue? Is it not at least worth the trouble to try the\r\nmethod of the mother, when it is every day demonstrated that pupils\r\nwho have had five, six, seven years of teaching are unable, on leaving\r\nschool, so much as to understand when the language they have been\r\nstudying is used in conversation?\r\n\r\nLet us attempt to obtain light on the differences between these two\r\nprincipal methods that exist for teaching a language. What is the\r\nmother's method? How does she teach the child to speak? First let us\r\nnotice that the mother follows the child: she allows him first to show\r\ninterest in something and then helps him to express _himself_. Here we\r\nmust pause to notice that what most interests the child is not a\r\nthing, an object for itself, but the capacity of the thing to do\r\nsomething, the possibilities of the thing for the performance of an\r\naction. A young child takes a thing in its hand and waves it, or\r\nstrikes it against something, or passes it from one hand to the other;\r\nwhen it is older, it asks invariably, \"What for?\" The mother names the\r\nthing to the child, and also the action that may be therewith\r\nperformed. The child begins to play. Here a specialty of the mother\r\nmethod comes into view. The mother tells the child that she is\r\n_pleased_ or _displeased_ with him, that it makes her _happy_ or\r\n_unhappy_ when the child does this or that, that she _thinks_ he is a\r\ngood or a naughty boy, etc.--all of which remarks express her\r\nfeelings, her thoughts, in contradistinction to the actions which have\r\noccasioned these feelings and thoughts; the realm of the mind as\r\nopposed to the world of activity. Let us here notice that the speech\r\nof every people contains these two classifications of words, the\r\nobjective and the subjective; and indeed it must be so, since we\r\nperform actions and we judge of our actions. By this method the child\r\nlearns in about a year from the time it begins to speak to express\r\nitself about what it does and what it thinks.\r\n\r\nNow what is the method of the grammarian? The child learns first the\r\nnames of things that do not appeal to his consciousness, for they do\r\nnot start from his point of view, but from that of the maker of a\r\nbook. He learns lists of words--that is, he learns to know the\r\n_symbol_, and not the _thing_; he translates. He learns about Cæsar's\r\nwars and the book of his father's uncle in what is called an exercise.\r\nFor both of these subjects he feels no interest, which is to be\r\nexpected, as they are abstract. He sees no action. Of the great part\r\nof language, which may be called the speech of feeling, he also learns\r\nonly in the abstract. He reads that Cæsar was glad or that his\r\nfather's uncle was angry, but the happiness and the anger are outside\r\nof his consciousness; they have been presented to him by symbols, that\r\nis, printed words. By this method the child learns in about four years\r\nto read fairly well; as a rule, speaking the language is entirely out\r\nof the question. The pupils can not talk of their actions and their\r\nfeelings, because these are represented to them by symbols, for such\r\nare printed words; they have not grasped them as actualities. If on\r\ngoing into a foreign country they are able to understand what is being\r\nsaid, the teacher may consider himself lucky. He has done his utmost\r\nwith the method he has chosen to employ. He has attained something. It\r\nremains true that the mother accomplishes more in a shorter time than\r\nthe grammarian.\r\n\r\nBut is it perhaps possible to put the two methods together, and thus\r\nto create a method which shall contain the good of both? We must not\r\ncontinue always to act as the mother does, to teach after her method,\r\nor our pupils will continue to talk like a child of two years, and be\r\nfurthermore unable to write at all. How shall we manage to melt the\r\ntwo into one compact, inseparable whole?\r\n\r\nLet us imagine a class is to take its first lesson in the foreign\r\ntongue. First, what shall be the matter of the lesson; then, how shall\r\nit be presented? We shall be careful to choose a subject that can be\r\ninteresting to the pupil, hence a subject containing activity. It is\r\nnot necessary that it should be anything astonishing or unusual. Let\r\nus consider with the pupils how one opens the classroom door. Let us\r\nask the pupil in his mother tongue how he does it, carefully drawing\r\nhis attention to the number of actions necessary to the accomplishment\r\nof our aim, such as walking, standing still, extending the arm,\r\ngrasping the knob, etc., together with the resulting actions on the\r\npart of the door, opening, swinging, etc. We will then draw his\r\nattention to the words of activity, the verbs, and tell him he is\r\ngoing to learn those words in the new language--say German. We will\r\nnow take the first verb necessary to the accomplishment of our aim,\r\nthat of walking. We will say, _while we walk_, such sentences as \"This\r\nis gehe,\" \"See how I gehe,\" \"My feet move when I gehe,\" etc. We do the\r\nsame with each verb, always with its accompanying action. We will take\r\nthe first four verbs of our subject, repeat them the first time with\r\nmany explanatory phrases, the second time with fewer, the third and\r\nlast time we shall simply repeat the verbs \"gehe,\" \"stehe still,\"\r\n\"strecke aus,\" \"fasse an,\" always with the actions. By this time the\r\npupils will know these, they having heard each one at least seven\r\ntimes. We can now allow them to recite, we still giving the clew by\r\nthe production of the appropriate action. Having taught these first\r\nfour verbs, we are now ready for the full sentence \"I walk toward the\r\ndoor,\" \"I stand still by the door,\" \"I reach out my arm,\" \"I take hold\r\nof the knob.\" We can teach the subject \"ich\" without difficulty, as it\r\nremains the same in all the sentences. Let us take the nouns and teach\r\nin this manner: \"Ich gehe\"--pointing--\"Thür,\" then a repetition of\r\n\"Thür\" contained in sentences describing it, with at least three\r\nrepetitions of the word. Then come the words showing direction and\r\nrelation. If you say \"Ich gehe\"--pointing--\"Thür,\" the pupil will know\r\nthat there is a word lacking, and he will be unsatisfied till he knows\r\nit. We now have a sentence, \"Ich gehe nach der Thür.\" We will teach\r\nthe other sentences in the same way; we will repeat each sentence at\r\nleast three times in its entirety, and we will allow the pupils to\r\nrecite. Here it is of interest to show the pupil that the sentence has\r\nsprung from the verb, that the verb is the germ of the sentence.\r\nWhether we do this with the words \"verb,\" \"sentence,\" \"germ,\" must\r\ndepend on the capacity of the class. It is not a question of words,\r\nbut of ideas. Let us present our subject as a living thing. To supply\r\nthe pupil with an old-fashioned grammar exercise is like inviting him\r\nto make a dinner off papier-maché joints and steaks.\r\n\r\nAll this time we have been considering the part of language which\r\ndeals with the _outside_ world. It is now time to consider how we\r\nshall present the part of language which deals with the inner life. We\r\nmust make the pupil capable of expressing his states of mind, his\r\nthoughts, because these thoughts are interesting to him. There is,\r\nbroadly speaking, only one situation in class about which his mind is\r\nworking: his own success or failure to recite. Hence, before each\r\nrecitation we shall speak a sentence of encouragement or command, such\r\nas \"Please begin,\" \"I think you are going to do well.\" After each\r\nrecitation we shall speak a sentence of praise or blame, such as \"Very\r\ngood,\" \"It might have been better.\" These, as they can not be\r\nexpressed by actions, may be translated when necessary into equivalent\r\nphrases in the mother tongue. We shall illustrate each phrase by\r\nstories, riddles, quotations, whatever you like. The pupil will be\r\ninterested, and hence will remember. It is not necessary to the\r\nacquisition of knowledge that the pupil should be thoroughly bored\r\nwhile trying to learn. After a sufficient number of repetitions of a\r\nphrase by the teacher, it will be handed over to the pupils, who will\r\nthen address to each other phrases of encouragement, command, praise,\r\nblame, etc. We have now enabled the pupil to express an action and his\r\nthought; the outside and the inside world are his; he needs only to\r\nadvance as he began. Each lesson proceeds in this wise:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\nPART I.--Teacher: \"We shall learn about opening the door.\" General\r\nsubjective phrase, \"Pay attention.\" Explanation of the phrase through\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nTeaching of _verbs_.\r\n\r\nFirst subjective phrase before recitation, \"Please begin.\" Explanation\r\nthrough stories.\r\n\r\nRecitation.\r\n\r\nFirst subjective phrase after recitation, \"Very good.\" Explanations\r\nthrough stories.\r\n\r\nAfter the teaching of the _sentences_, the subjective phrases are\r\nspoken by the pupils.\r\n\r\nIt lies in the intelligence of the teacher to recognize the moment for\r\nintroducing phrases.\r\n\r\nThe lesson then proceeds to the movements of the door as Part II, and\r\nto our leaving the door as Part III. The scheme is the same.\r\n\r\nAll this is a copy (systematized, of course) of the method employed by\r\nthe mother. Now, first, can the grammarian be useful to us? Let us\r\nremember that to begin with his method is to put the cart before the\r\nhorse. He must play the second but also an important part. The child\r\nlearns to speak first, but he also learns to read and to write. We\r\nwill give the same lesson to the pupil in printed form; he will be\r\nasked to read it, and then to copy it or write it from dictation. He\r\nwill receive the new speech through the sense of hearing; it will then\r\nbe communicated to the sight, and then to the touch. In this manner a\r\nclass of twenty girls of about thirteen years had been taught English.\r\nAfter about thirty printed lessons had been mastered with the\r\nanecdotes, riddles, etc., which had occupied about half a German\r\nschool year, they were not only able to read and write without many\r\nmistakes, but showed a strong desire to express themselves in the new\r\ntongue, and were, indeed, able to do so very satisfactorily, as\r\ncompared with the results obtained by the grammarian after a seven\r\nyears' course.\r\n\r\nWho first thought of combining the two original methods of language\r\nteaching in this way? A Frenchman, named François Gouin. He gave it\r\nthe name of the \"Series Method,\" because each lesson contains a series\r\nof actions. After the pupil has learned to express himself in regard\r\nto his immediate surroundings he continues to learn in series in\r\nregard to the lives of animals and of plants, the processes of\r\nhousekeeping, traveling, trade, etc. It is all presented simply, but\r\neach has its own appropriate words and expressions. As soon as the\r\npupil has mastered the rudiments he will also have the subjective\r\nmatter presented in a series; in one lesson the teacher will be\r\ninclined to mirth, in another to (mock) anger, in another to hope, in\r\nanother to (mock) despair.\r\n\r\nThe most important result of education being the evolution of the\r\ncharacter already present in the child, let us not consider him a\r\nlittle empty jug to be filled with knowledge; rather let us seek to\r\ndraw out the riches of his character. When he is able to _live_ in a\r\nnew language, he will be ever broadened, refreshed, and renewed.\r\n\r\nThis method, resting on a psychological basis, is, with modifications\r\nof manner, which it remains the duty of the teacher to recognize, just\r\nas good for an adult as for a child. Rules of grammar will be earlier\r\ngiven to the adult, because he will notice correspondences and\r\ndifferences sooner than the child. But no rule will ever be given to a\r\npupil of any age till he himself can appreciate its value, till he is\r\nmentally beginning to ask \"why?\" This questioning state of mind is one\r\nhighly to be desired, as it is a state of receptivity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The highest point yet reached by a kite was attained by the\r\n     leader of a tandem sent up from the Blue Hill Observatory by\r\n     Messrs. Clayton and Ferguson, August 26th, 12,124 feet above\r\n     the sea, 277 feet higher than had previously been reached by\r\n     any kite. The five miles of line weighed seventy-five\r\n     pounds, and the weight of the whole was one hundred and\r\n     twelve pounds. With a temperature of 75° and wind velocity\r\n     thirty-two miles an hour on the ground, the temperature was\r\n     38° and the wind velocity thirty-two miles an hour at the\r\n     highest point reached, while the highest wind velocity\r\n     recorded was forty miles an hour at 11,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIEST WRITING IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nBY M. GABRIEL DE MORTILLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient Celts and Gauls of France had no real letters. A few\r\nCeltiberian pieces of money bear characters belonging to the\r\nPhœnician and Carthaginian alphabets. In Cisalpine Gaul we find\r\nGallic written in ancient Italian characters. The Greeks, when they\r\nfounded Massilia and spread themselves along the Mediterranean coast\r\nof France, brought their language and writing into the country. The\r\nGauls took advantage of this, and many Gallic inscriptions in Greek\r\ncharacters occur scattered through the south of France, among much\r\nmore numerous inscriptions in the Greek language and character.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans came, the Latin alphabet rapidly took the place of the\r\nGreek, and the few Gauls that continued faithful to the old tongue\r\nused Latin characters in engraving the inscriptions they have left us.\r\nSimilar changes took place in Gallic pieces of money. Excepting the\r\nCeltiberian coins with their Semitic legends and characters, which are\r\nfound only in a very limited district in the southwest of France,\r\nGallic coins, when they have characters upon them, may be classified\r\nas those with Greek and those with Latin legends. The former are very\r\nabundant in the south of France, and extend, growing more rare, as we\r\ngo on into the center and north. Gallic coins with legends in Roman\r\ncharacters gradually become more numerous, and were general after the\r\nconquest of Gaul by Julius Cæsar, some of the Gallic populations\r\nhaving only begun to coin money during the earlier period of the Roman\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThere are some evidences of the use of a symbolical and hieroglyphical\r\nwriting before alphabetical writing. On some of the megalithic\r\nmonuments, principally in Morbihan, stones are found bearing incised\r\nengravings, and sometimes sculptures in relief. Are the engravings\r\nsimply ornamental motives, have they a symbolical meaning, or are they\r\nhieroglyphic emblems? Opinions are divided.\r\n\r\nThe supports of the large and handsome dolmen of the little island of\r\nGavrinis, Morbihan, are filled with engraved lines running into one\r\nanother and conforming to the shape of the stone or to its\r\ncomposition--all the siliceous and consequently very hard parts being\r\nfree from them. This indicates a simple ornamentation or decoration\r\nexecuted without any special plan made in advance, according to the\r\nnature and form of the stone worked upon. Yet, among the lines of the\r\napparently fanciful ornament a number of polished stone hatchets are\r\nvery distinctly represented. In all the other dolmens the carvings are\r\nmuch less numerous and not so close. Sometimes they are distributed\r\naround, and sometimes they are isolated. Among them we remark the\r\nfrequent repetition of some forms in groups or singly, which suggest\r\nthe thought of signs with a determined sense. Upon a large support of\r\nthe dolmen of the Petit-Mont at Arzan (Morbihan) there are at the\r\nlower left hand three crosses, a sign of frequent occurrence on the\r\nmegalithic carvings. Above these are two very wide open U's. Seidler\r\nsees in these signs letters of the Libyan alphabet, the cross\r\ncorresponding to C, and the other sign to M. Some persons have further\r\nthought they could distinguish an Egyptian letter in the cross. Taking\r\na more general view of the question, Letourneau[34] has tried to prove\r\nthat the sculptures on the megaliths are inscriptions, and the\r\nengraved signs correspond to letters of the ancient alphabets, most\r\nprobably Semitic. Adrien de Mortillet answered that the thought of\r\nwriting involved arrangement, and no arrangement could be predicated\r\nof the signs.\r\n\r\nA short time afterward, Adrien de Mortillet, in a paper on the Figures\r\nsculptured on the Megalithic Monuments of France, proved that the\r\nfigures are more or less rude designs representing a well-determined\r\nseries of objects. Thus the U's, with branches very widely separated,\r\nrepresent boats, and are emblems of migrations by sea; the crosses are\r\nshipmasters' staffs, or insignia of chiefs similar in character to\r\nbishops' crosses. The polished hatchet is frequently figured, and\r\noften with a handle, and is the emblem of labor, or, more probably, of\r\ncombat. The scutcheons, which are also frequent, are bucklers, or\r\nmilitary symbols. They are usually adorned on the inner side with a\r\nvariety of symbolical figures variously grouped, which evidently\r\nserved as the owner's coat of arms, and are the most ancient known\r\nspecimens of the kind, going back to the stone age, or at least to the\r\ntransition age from stone to bronze. After that time the custom of\r\nputting their owners' arms upon bucklers spread widely. It lasted till\r\nthe end of the middle ages. The painted vases of classical antiquity\r\nfurnish numerous and very curious examples of such marks. The\r\ninterpretation of the megalithic sculptures may furnish probable if\r\nnot certain details concerning an epoch which is very little known to\r\nus. Thus, the scutcheon of the dolmen _des Marchands_, containing four\r\nseries of crosses, one above the other, and each series divided into\r\ntwo parts, fifty-six crosses in all, may have been the arms of a chief\r\nof a powerful confederation having fifty-six less important chiefs\r\nunder his orders. The supposition is confirmed by the dimensions of\r\nthe monument and a large handled hatchet engraved under the tablet\r\nbetween two other crosses.\r\n\r\nNear the dolmen _des Marchands_, and not far from the sea, is the\r\nlarge tumulus of Marie-Hroeck, which includes a small dolmen\r\ncontaining rich funerary furnishings. In front of the entrance to the\r\ncavern is a rectangular slab that bears on its face a scutcheon\r\ncontaining two crosses, symbolical of power, and several very rudely\r\ndrawn representations of boats. The engravers of this period were not\r\nartists, but stone-cutters, working upon a very hard rock with very\r\npoor tools. Unable to figure distinctly what they wanted to, they did\r\nthe best they could. Handled hatchets were distributed irregularly all\r\nround the scutcheons. Does not this epitaph seem to mean that the tomb\r\nwas erected in memory of a powerful maritime chief by soldiers, his\r\ncompanions in arms?\r\n\r\nFrom these bucklers we pass to generalized feminine representations\r\ncharacterized by concentric necklaces and pairs of prominent globular\r\nbreasts. Such sculptures, which are repeated in various dolmens and\r\nartificial mortuary caves in the valley of the Seine, may be of\r\nreligious import. They seem to be replaced in the south of France by\r\nattempts at statues. Of such character are the two sculptures of the\r\ndolmen of Collorgues in Gard, which also have the symbolical cross on\r\ntheir breasts.\r\n\r\nWhatever they may be, the megalithic engravings are the earliest\r\ngraphic historical documents of the country. It is therefore important\r\nto collect and preserve them.\r\n\r\nThey may be divided into simple ornamental motives, which may further\r\nsuggest interesting resemblances; figurative engravings representing\r\nknown and definite objects and forming commemorative pictures capable\r\nof affording important historical or legendary hints--the most ancient\r\ndocuments in our archives; and symbolical engravings of more difficult\r\ndetermination, and independent of any alphabet.\r\n\r\nAmong the specimens of the last class, one sort, the cupule, is\r\nextremely widespread. It is a very regularly shaped hemispherical cup,\r\ngenerally represented by itself, but sometimes mingled with other\r\nfigures, most usually occurring in groups without arrangement, but\r\nvery rarely isolated. Entire surfaces are sometimes covered with this\r\ndesign. It is a very ancient design, as such cupules are found on the\r\ndolmens. In the dolmen of Kériaval, at Locmariquer, the lower side of\r\nthe horizontal slab is starred with numerous cupules, which antedate\r\nthe construction of the monument, for they appear on the parts that\r\nrest on the supports. There may also, however, be more recent cupules.\r\nWe are totally in the dark as to what they represent.\r\n\r\nCupules are sometimes cut on the surface of rocks in place. Engravings\r\nsimilarly cut have been designated sculptures on rocks, and are found\r\nalmost everywhere. Those which have been most studied and afford the\r\nmost features of interest for us are on the Scandinavian coasts, and\r\nthese have been largely utilized by Adrien de Mortillet for the\r\ndetermination of the figures of megaliths. We cite only one example\r\nfrom Gaul, the sculptures in the rocks of the Lago dei Maraviglie, in\r\na lateral valley on the left, going from San Dalmazo to Tende, in\r\nPiedmont. Some of the walls of the rock there and large surfaces of\r\ndetached blocks are covered with extremely rude figures formed by the\r\naccumulation of dints resulting from frequently repeated blows. Among\r\nthese figures, which are without order in the grouping, and in which\r\nno regard is paid to proportions, are stags, rams, human figurines,\r\nhatchets, pikes, baskets, and lance points. These sculptures have been\r\nascribed to the neolithic or the bronze age; but the existence of\r\nfigures of similar style on the walls of a lead mine near Valauri has\r\nsuggested that they may be more recent. Human figurines are numerous,\r\nbut heads of horned animals are more so. Some are perhaps stags and\r\nrams, while bulls and cows are abundant. The shepherds are accustomed\r\nto take their herds and keep them for two or three months every year\r\nin this valley, which is so lonely and melancholy in aspect that it\r\nhas been called Vallée d'Enfer, or Hell Valley. It would not be\r\nstrange if these herdsmen, for want of something better to do, should\r\nhave amused themselves delineating the things that were before their\r\neyes--the cattle, the miners, and things appertaining to the mine. As\r\nto special traits, the representations are so badly executed as to\r\nleave a wide range open for interpretation.--_Translated for the\r\nPopular Science Monthly from the Book Formation de la Nation\r\nfrançaise_ (Paris: Félix Alcan).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[34] Ch.

He began his studies\r\nwith the Jesuits at Chambéry, and continued them in Paris at the\r\nMuseum of Natural History and at the Conservatoire des Arts et\r\nMétiers. He was interested in the revolutionary movements of 1848; and\r\nin the insurrectionary demonstration of the 13th of June, 1849, which\r\nfollowed the presentation by Ledru Rollin, on the 11th, of a\r\nresolution of impeachment against President Louis Napoleon for\r\nrepressing the republican movement in Rome, it was with his help that\r\nthe eminent deputy was enabled to escape arrest. In the same year he\r\nwas condemned for a press offense and took refuge in Savoy. During his\r\nexile he classified the collections of the Natural History Museum in\r\nGeneva; had charge of the arrangement of the Museum at Annecy in 1854;\r\ndirected an exploitation of hydraulic lime in Italy; and served as\r\ngeological adviser in the construction of the northern railways of\r\nthat country. He was also associated with Agassiz in his studies of\r\nthe glaciers of Switzerland. He returned to Paris in 1864, and in 1867\r\nwas charged with the organization of the first hall or prehistoric\r\ndepartment of the History of Labor at the Universal Exposition of\r\n1867. In 1868 he was called to the Museum of National Antiquities at\r\nSaint-Germain-en-Laye, where he continued till 1885. It is specially\r\nmentioned that he carried this institution safely through the perils\r\nof the war of 1870-'71. While engaged in these museum tasks he was\r\nstruck with the insufficiency of the then universally accepted\r\npaleontological and prehistoric classifications, and his attention\r\nbecame fully absorbed in the subject. He held long consultations with\r\nEdouard Lartet, the eminent paleontologist and his learned friends\r\nconcerning it. As a result of these deliberations, after careful study\r\nof the formations and specimens, he proposed a scheme of\r\nclassification in 1869, which was completed at the congress held in\r\nBrussels in 1872, and has become generally accepted in its\r\nfundamentals, after having withstood the often-repeated attacks of\r\npersistent criticism, and has received confirmation after confirmation\r\nfrom innumerable discoveries made throughout the world. \"Had his\r\nactivity concerned only the classification of the different stone\r\nages,\" says Dr. Capitan, whose eulogy of M. de Mortillet we follow\r\nmost largely in our sketch, \"de Mortillet would for that work alone\r\nhave been by good right considered a great man of science. Actually to\r\nilluminate a number of dark points, to group a thousand scattered\r\nfacts in regular order, to synthesize numerous isolated researches, to\r\nconstitute a cohesive theory of them--that is what de Mortillet did.\r\nThus he became long ago the uncontested master, the leader of a\r\nschool, who was able to group and hold around him the scientific\r\nstudents and workers of the entire world.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Mortillet was in 1866 one of the founders of the International\r\nCongress of Prehistoric Archæology. He was one of the first professors\r\nin the École d'Anthropologie founded by Broca in 1875, the greatest\r\nachievement, as he writes in the preface to his _Formation de la\r\nNation française_, of the Association for the Teaching of\r\nAnthropological Sciences. The school was opened in November, 1875, in\r\na building gratuitously lent it by the École de Médecine, to give\r\ninstruction free of tuition charges, and was to be maintained by a\r\nfund subscribed by anthropological societies and private persons, a\r\ngift of fifteen hundred dollars a year by M. Wallon for laboratory\r\npurposes, and a grant of twenty-five hundred dollars from the\r\nMunicipal Council of Paris for the payment of professors' salaries.\r\nFive courses of lectures were to be delivered, to be increased as the\r\nresources of the association multiplied. The association and the\r\nschool were recognized as of public utility by a law of 1889; the\r\nschool being the first establishment of private instruction, Dr.\r\nCapitan said in his memorial address, \"and up to this time (1897) the\r\nonly one that has had that honor, an honor that creates duties for us.\r\nWe are under obligation to clarify and extend our teaching.\" De\r\nMortillet's work was so true to the sentiment expressed in this\r\nsentence that one of the characteristics attributed to him in the\r\nshort biography published in Vaporeau's _Dictionnaire Universel des\r\nContemporains_ is that he was one of the men who contributed most to\r\nthe popularizing of prehistoric studies in France. During the more\r\nthan twenty years of his professorship of prehistoric anthropology in\r\nthe École, de Mortillet \"gave precious instruction to numerous\r\nstudents, many of whom, foreigners, have in their turns become masters\r\nin their own countries.\" He was also president of the Society of\r\nAnthropology, subdirector of the École d'Anthropologie, president of\r\nthe Association for Teaching Anthropological Sciences, and president\r\nof the Commission on Megalithic Monuments--the various functions of\r\nwhich offices he filled with remarkable exactness and distinction.\r\n\"In all these important positions,\" says Dr. Capitan in his eulogy,\r\n\"de Mortillet unfailingly brought a uniform ardor to his work, a\r\nuniform activity, a clear and acute wit, and a remarkable precision.\r\nHe performed his numerous duties almost to the end of his life. Only\r\nlast month (July, 1898) he made another journey for the execution of a\r\nmission which the commission on megalithic monuments had intrusted to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with these multifarious labors, M. de Mortillet\r\npublished a considerable number of memoirs and of books of the highest\r\norder. He was a transformist from the very first, and performed all\r\nhis various researches in the spirit of an evolutionist. His first\r\npublications were on conchology, and numerous memoirs between 1851 and\r\n1862 related to subjects in that branch. During the same period he\r\ncontributed many important works on the geology and mineralogy of\r\nSavoy. Among these were the History of the Land and Fresh-water\r\nMollusks of Savoy and the Basin of Lake Leman, and a Guide to the\r\nTraveler in Savoy. His attention was afterward more entirely directed\r\nto prehistoric archæology and anthropology, and he published in 1866 a\r\ncurious Study on the Sign of the Cross previous to Christianity. Of\r\nthis period, too, are his Promenades, or Walks, in the Universal\r\nExposition of 1867, and his Walks in the Museum of Saint-Germain,\r\n1869. He founded, in 1864, the Recueil, or Collection of Materials for\r\nthe Positive History of Man, which was afterward continued at Toulouse\r\nby M.E. Cartailhac. In 1879 he published a work on pottery\r\nmarks--_Potiérs allobroges, ou les Sigles figulins étudiés par les\r\nMéthodes de l'Histoire naturelle_. In 1881, in co-operation with his\r\nson, Adrien de Mortillet, as artist, he published a magnificent\r\nillustrated work or album, _Le Musée Préhistorique_ (The Prehistoric\r\nMuseum); and in 1883, the volume _Le Préhistorique_ (Prehistoric\r\nArchæology); two books which have taken rank as master works. A second\r\nedition of the _Préhistorique_ appeared in 1885, and at the time of\r\nhis death he was preparing a third, in which he was taking great pains\r\nto bring the matter up to the present condition of the science.\r\nAnother important work was the _Origines de la Chasse et de la Pêche_\r\n(Origin of Hunting and Fishing). A considerable number of memoirs by\r\nM. de Mortillet appeared in various scientific journals, especially in\r\nthe two founded by him--_Les Matériaux pour l'Histoire primitive et\r\nnaturelle de l'Homme_, already mentioned, and _L'Homme_, which was\r\nestablished in 1884.\r\n\r\nAn epoch in M. de Mortillet's life was marked in 1873, when a\r\ndiscussion took place at the Anthropological Congress, in Lyons,\r\nbetween him and M. Abel Hovelacque concerning the precursors of man.\r\nThe researches of the two masters had already led them, by a series\r\nof observations and deductions, to regard as certain the geological\r\nexistence of a being intermediate between man and the monkey, which\r\nthey called the _Anthropopithecus_, and they were trying to indicate,\r\nhypothetically, its leading characteristics.\r\n\r\nM. de Mortillet's reasons for believing in the existence of this\r\nprecursor of man as a definite being were presented in the _Revue\r\nd'Anthropologie_, in an article which was translated and published in\r\nthe Popular Science Monthly for April, 1879. In this paper the author\r\nsummarized the evidence, already copious, in favor of the existence of\r\nQuaternary man, and then took up the question, \"Did there exist in the\r\nTertiary age beings sufficiently intelligent to perform a part of the\r\nacts which are characteristic of man?\" He then reviewed the researches\r\nof the Abbé Bourgeois at Thenay in the light of a collection of\r\nfire-marked flints which he had exhibited at the International\r\nCongress of Prehistoric Archæology and Anthropology held in Paris in\r\n1867, and deduced from the result that \"during the Middle Tertiary\r\nthere existed a creature, precursor of man, an anthropopithecus, which\r\nwas acquainted with fire, and could make use of it for splitting\r\nflints. It also was able to trim the flint flakes thus produced, and\r\nto convert them into tools. This curious and interesting discovery for\r\na long time stood alone, and arguments were even drawn from its\r\nisolated position to favor the rejection of it. Fortunately, another\r\nFrench observer, M.J.B. Rames, has found in the vicinity of Aurillac\r\n(Cantal), in the strata of the upper part of the Middle\r\nTertiary--here, too, in company with mastodons and dinotheriums,\r\nthough of more recent species than those of Thenay--flints which also\r\nhave been redressed intentionally. In this case, however, the flints\r\nare no longer split by fire, but by tapping. It is something more than\r\na continuation, it is a development. Among the few specimens exhibited\r\nby M. Rames, whose discoveries are quite recent, is one which, had it\r\nbeen found on the surface of the ground, would never have been called\r\nin question.\" The evidence afforded by these flints was confirmed by a\r\ncollection of flints from the Miocene and the Pliocene of the valley\r\nof the Tagus shown by Señor Ribeiro in the same exhibition, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of which bore evidence of intentional\r\nchipping.\r\n\r\nBearing upon this point was a chart of the Palæolithic Age in Gaul,\r\ndrawn up by M. de Mortillet in 1871, and published in the _Bulletin de\r\nla Société d'Anthropologie de Paris_--\"the only work of the kind\r\nextant\"--in which were recorded five localities in which occurred\r\nsupposed traces of man in the Tertiary, forty-one alluvial deposits in\r\nthe Quaternary yielding human bones and industrial remains, and two\r\nhundred and seventy-eight caverns containing Quaternary fauna with\r\ntraces of prehistoric man.\r\n\r\nM. de Mortillet gave in another form his view of the sort of creature\r\nthe hypothetical anthropopithecus should be in a paper on Tertiary\r\nMan, read before the Anthropological Section of the French Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Science in 1885, when he said the question was\r\nnot to find whether man already existed in the Tertiary epoch as he\r\nexists at the present day. Animals varied from one geological epoch to\r\nanother, and the higher the animals the greater was the variation. It\r\nwas to be inferred, therefore, that man would vary more rapidly than\r\nthe other mammals. The problem was to discover in the Tertiary period\r\nan ancestral form of man a predecessor of the man of historical times.\r\nThere were, he affirmed, unquestionably in the Tertiary strata objects\r\nwhich implied the existence of an intelligent being--animals less\r\nintelligent than existing man, but much more intelligent than existing\r\napes. While the skeleton of this ancestral form of man had not yet\r\nbeen discovered, he had made himself known to us in the clearest\r\nmanner by his works. The general opinion of the meeting after hearing\r\nM. de Mortillet's paper is said to have been that there could be no\r\nlonger any doubt of the existence of the supposed ancestral form of\r\nman in the Tertiary period.\r\n\r\nThe discovery in Java, announced by Dr. Dubois, in 1896, of fossil\r\nremains presenting structural characteristics between those of man and\r\nthose of the monkey, to which the name _Pithecanthropus erectus_ was\r\ngiven, were accepted with hardly a question by M. de Mortillet and his\r\ncolleagues as confirming his views.\r\n\r\nAt a banquet given to M. de Mortillet, May 1, 1884, by a number of\r\nanthropologists, when his portrait was presented to him, the hall was\r\ndecorated for the occasion with a life-size picture of an ancient\r\nGaul, executed according to his latest researches. The man was\r\nrepresented as having no hair on his body; with very long arms and\r\nvery powerful muscles; his feet capable of being used in climbing\r\ntrees, but with toes not opposable; his jaw strongly prognathous, but\r\nnot at all equal to that of an anthropoid ape; his breadth strongly\r\ncompressed laterally and his abdomen prominent; the skin not negroid,\r\nbut of our present color; and the expression of his face was about as\r\nintelligent as that of an Australian.\r\n\r\nIn his _Le Préhistorique_ M. de Mortillet attempted to determine how\r\nfar distant was the epoch when _Homo sapiens_ first appeared on the\r\nearth, by estimating the rate of progression of blocks which were\r\ncarried by former ice fields, as he had observed them in Switzerland\r\nwith Agassiz. His conclusion was that more than two hundred thousand\r\nyears had elapsed since that event.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 M. de Mortillet proposed in the Société d'Anthropologie an\r\nimportant reform in chronology. Pointing out the inconvenience of\r\nusing several different eras, such as the Foundation of Rome, the\r\nFlight of Mohammed, and the Proclamation of the French Republic, he\r\nsuggested that ten thousand years before the Christian era be adopted\r\nas a general starting point. This would include all Egyptian\r\nchronology as known at the present day, and would leave five thousand\r\nyears at the disposal of future discoverers.\r\n\r\n\"A spirit always youthful, a man of progress,\" says Dr. Capitan in his\r\neulogy, \"our dear master kept himself fully in the current with all\r\nwork relating to prehistoric archæology. He knew how to profit by\r\nwhatever would contribute to perfect his own work. He therefore, on\r\ndifferent occasions, modified his classification so as to keep it up\r\nto date, realizing that a classification is an admirable instrument of\r\nstudy, which ought to go through the same evolution as the science to\r\nwhich it is applied.\" This high quality of his mind appears clearly in\r\nhis last book, published in 1897--_Formation de la Nation française_\r\n(Formation of the French Nation). This book comprised the substance of\r\nhis lectures of the term 1889-'90. In publishing it he disavowed all\r\nintention of producing a new history of France. There were enough of\r\nthese in all shapes and sizes, written in the most varied styles, with\r\ndiverse tendencies, and from the most different points of view, and\r\nthere were some most excellent works among them, particularly that of\r\nM. Henri Martin, which seemed to him to contain all the historical\r\ninformation known. But all these histories, even that of Henri Martin,\r\nalthough he had been president of the Anthropological Society of\r\nParis, appeared to M. de Mortillet to be at fault in their starting\r\npoint. They gave too much place in their beginnings to the legendary\r\nand the imaginary, and not enough to natural history and\r\npalæethnology. It was M. de Mortillet's purpose to follow an inverse\r\nmethod--to regard direct observation alone; and he would rest only on\r\nthe impartial and precise discussion of texts and facts. \"Texts,\r\ndocuments, and facts,\" he said, \"become more and more rare as we go\r\nback in time. I shall collect and examine them with the greatest care\r\nin order to make our origins as clear as possible, and to enlarge the\r\nscale of our history. I shall appeal in succession to all the sciences\r\nof observation, and when I have recourse to the texts, I shall subject\r\nthem to the closest criticism and the most complete analysis.\" The\r\ntexts on which historians had so far relied did not go back far\r\nenough. They told of events three thousand or, including the Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphic texts, seven thousand years old, but what was this\r\ncompared with the immense lapse of time during which man has lived,\r\ngoing back into the Quaternary epoch? On this vast period the texts\r\nfurnish no information. They were, besides, inaccurate, tinged with\r\nfable and poetry, with local and personal prejudice and ignorance,\r\neven as to the times to which they relate after history is supposed\r\nto have come in. If we want light upon this unrecorded past, we must\r\nseek it by the aid of palæethnological data; and anthropology may be\r\nvery advantageously united with palæethnology to furnish valuable\r\ninstruction concerning the autochthonic race of France, its\r\ndevelopment, transformations, customs, and migrations, and the\r\ninvasions it suffered in the most remote antiquity. \"With the aid of\r\nthese two sciences, both of wholly new origin, we are able to trace\r\nthe earliest pages of the history of France.\" The book begins with a\r\nreview of what the texts afford regarding the earlier peoples of\r\nFrance; then brings forward the evidence yielded by language and the\r\nstudy of the evolution of writing; next presents the results of\r\nresearch respecting the precursors of man, the rise and development of\r\nindustries, societies, and civilization; and studies the primitive\r\nraces of perhaps two hundred and thirty thousand or two hundred and\r\nforty thousand years ago; their mixture with the other races that came\r\nin from abroad and possessed the country; and, finally, the formation\r\nof the French population as we now find it.\r\n\r\nM. de Mortillet's relations with his pupils and with his country, and\r\nhis private character, are spoken of in the highest terms. For more\r\nthan twenty years his lectures at the École d'Anthropologie, treating\r\nthe most various questions respecting prehistoric times, attracted\r\nlarge and attentive audiences, often including students from abroad,\r\nwho afterward became masters of the science in their own countries.\r\n\"He was always ready to receive workers in the science, even the least\r\nand humblest, to bestow advice and encouragement upon them, and to\r\ngive them the benefit of his experience and extensive erudition, and\r\nfor this his pupils and friends lament him.\" Against his integrity no\r\nsuspicion was ever breathed.\r\n\r\nIn political faith he was always advanced, and ever true to his\r\nconvictions. He was _maire_ of Saint-Germain from 1882 to 1888, and\r\ndeputy from the department of Seine-et-Oise from 1885 to 1889.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In the observations of the meteoric shower of November 13,\r\n     1897, at Harvard College Observatory, one of the meteors\r\n     appeared, according to the calculations, at the height of\r\n     406 miles, and disappeared at the height of 43 miles, and at\r\n     a distance of 196 miles. Another appeared at a height of 182\r\n     miles and disappeared at a height of 48 miles, and a\r\n     distance of 74 miles. The first meteor was red or orange,\r\n     or, to Prof. W.H. Pickering, the color of a sodium flame,\r\n     and the other white. Both penetrated the atmosphere to about\r\n     the same depth, and both were clearly Leonids. These facts\r\n     go to show, Professor Pickering thinks, that the difference\r\n     in color noted is not due to a mere grazing of our\r\n     atmosphere in some cases, and a correspondingly low\r\n     temperature, but to an actual difference in the chemical\r\n     composition of the individual meteors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATION OF SOCIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n  _Editor Popular Science Monthly_:\r\n\r\nSIR: May I be permitted a word of comment upon your editorial entitled\r\nA Borrowed Foundation, published in the December number of the Popular\r\nScience Monthly? Whatever my readers and reviewers may have claimed\r\nfor me, I myself have never claimed to be the discoverer of \"the\r\nconsciousness of kind.\" Not only Mr. Spencer, as he and you have\r\nshown; not only Hegel, as Professor Caldwell has shown; but also\r\nnearly every philosophical writer and psychologist from Plato and\r\nAristotle down to the present time has more or less clearly recognized\r\nthe phenomenon of \"the consciousness of kind,\" although I do not know\r\nthat any one but myself has called it by just this phrase. The only\r\nclaim, then, that I put forward for my own work is that, in a somewhat\r\nsystematic way, I have attempted to use the consciousness of kind as\r\nthe postulate of sociology and to interpret more special social\r\nphenomena by means of it. In other words, I have used it as a\r\n\"foundation\"; and I am not aware that any other writer on sociology\r\nhas ever done so. Mr. Spencer, I feel quite sure, makes no such claim\r\nfor himself. The passage which he and you have quoted is taken from\r\nthe Principles of Psychology; it is not repeated in the Principles of\r\nSociology, where, if it had been regarded by Mr. Spencer as a\r\n\"foundation,\" it should have been put forward as the major premise of\r\nsocial theory. Passing over the consciousness of kind, Mr. Spencer has\r\nchosen to build his system of sociology in part upon other\r\npsychological inductions, in part upon a biological analogy. The\r\ntables of the Descriptive Sociology are arranged in accordance with\r\nthe organic conception, and nine and one half chapters of the\r\nInductions of Sociology in the first volume of the Principles of\r\nSociology are formulated in terms of it. Throughout the remaining\r\nparts of the Principles, however, sociological phenomena are explained\r\nin terms of two closely correlated generalizations that are\r\npsychological in character--namely, first, the generalization that\r\n\"while the fear of the living becomes the root of the political\r\ncontrol, the fear of the dead becomes the root of religious control\";\r\nand second, the generalization that militancy and industrialism\r\nproduce opposite effects on mind and character, and, through them, on\r\nevery form of social organization. The work that Mr. Spencer has done\r\nin elaborating these explanations is of inestimable value, but surely\r\nit is not an interpretation of society in terms of the consciousness\r\nof kind. Is it then quite fair to suggest that the use made of the\r\nconsciousness of kind in my own work is a borrowed \"foundation\"?\r\n\r\nHowever you and Mr. Spencer and my own readers may answer this\r\nquestion, I can sincerely subscribe to your affirmation that there is\r\nmuch more in Mr. Spencer's writings than most even of his truest\r\nadmirers and most diligent readers have ever explored; and I should be\r\nsorry to be regarded as behind the foremost in appreciation of the\r\ngreat work which he has accomplished not only for philosophy in\r\ngeneral, but especially for that branch of knowledge which has engaged\r\nmy own interest.\r\n\r\n                                            FRANKLIN H. GIDDINGS.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK, _December 19, 1898_.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Giddings, in his Principles of Sociology, spoke of the\r\n\"consciousness of kind\" as the \"new datum which has been hitherto\r\nsought without success.\" Mr. Spencer, on the other hand, showed that\r\nthis was not a new datum, inasmuch as he had formulated it himself in\r\na work published many years previously. Professor Giddings says that\r\nthe passage to which Mr. Spencer referred occurred in his Principles\r\nof Psychology, and not in his Principles of Sociology, where, \"if it\r\nhad been regarded by Mr. Spencer as a foundation, it should have been\r\nput forward as the major premise of social theory.\" But Professor\r\nGiddings surely does not forget that Mr. Spencer, in laying out his\r\nsystem of synthetic philosophy, made the whole of psychology the basis\r\nof, and immediate preparation for, sociology. Quite naturally a writer\r\nwho is dealing with sociology separately, and not as part of a\r\nphilosophical system, will find it necessary in laying his foundations\r\nto fall back on data furnished by the immediately underlying science;\r\nand this explains why Professor Giddings makes use in his Principles\r\nof Sociology of a datum which, whether drawn from Mr. Spencer's\r\nPsychology or not, was at least to be found there very distinctly\r\nexpressed. Mr. Spencer himself says that he regarded it as a \"primary\r\ndatum,\" and calls attention to the fact that he devoted \"a dozen pages\r\nto tracing the development of sympathy as a result of gregariousness.\"\r\nWe are quite prepared to recognize the valuable use which Professor\r\nGiddings has made of the doctrine in question, and to admit that, by\r\nthe extensive development he has given to it, he has imparted a\r\nspecial character and a special interest both to his Principles of\r\nSociology and to his Elements of Sociology noticed elsewhere.--ED.\r\nP.S.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION AND EDUCATION AGAIN.\r\n\r\n  _Editor Popular Science Monthly_:\r\n\r\nSIR: I have not before this acknowledged your reference to me in a\r\nspirited and instructive editorial that appeared in the December\r\nnumber of your excellent magazine, because an immediate reply might\r\nhave been taken to indicate a desire, on my part, for a controversy,\r\nwhich I expressly disclaim; and besides, I have desired that the\r\npublic might read and consider your views dispassionately. I care but\r\nlittle for the effect upon myself, if the cause of truth shall be\r\nmaterially strengthened.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised that you refer to me as \"ignorant,\" \"negligible,\"\r\netc., because it has for a long time been painfully clear that the\r\n\"scientific mind\" is exceedingly sensitive, and while much given to\r\npraising forbearance and kindness, still resorts to language\r\nreasonably regarded as abusive. I have always found this to be true,\r\nand the present controversy is no exception to the rule. The \"broadly\r\nscientific mind\" is, alas! too often narrow and intolerant in treating\r\nopposing views. I do not wish, however, to find fault with the\r\nabuse--it may prove to be good discipline, and is, therefore,\r\nthankfully accepted; but I do very much desire to correct a mistaken\r\ninference that you drew from my reference to Herbert Spencer. There\r\nare some typographical errors in the quotations that you make, which,\r\nhowever, do not change the meaning. Allow me then to say that I have a\r\ngreat regard for Mr. Spencer; that I have read his writings with much\r\nprofit, and that I have never failed to accord him full credit for the\r\nwork he has accomplished. That I can not understand and accept all his\r\nteachings does not lessen my respect for him.\r\n\r\nAt the time that I made my informal talk to the teachers of this city,\r\nI had no thought that my remarks would be published or would excite\r\npublic criticism, or that I would be honored with so distinguished, so\r\ncritical an audience, or I should have been more careful in the use of\r\nterms; but it does seem to me that there is no excuse for the\r\ndistorted meaning that you and others have given to the quotations. I\r\nreferred to Mr. Spencer's age to show that we could hope for no change\r\nin his philosophy, and the criticism that follows, if it may be styled\r\na criticism at all, is that he has refused to recognize the Deity, and\r\nthereby fails to \"bless, cheer, and comfort suffering humanity.\" You\r\ndiscuss it as if I had said that he had not _bettered_ the condition\r\nof his fellows; but that idea is not in the statement that you quote\r\nat all. The word \"suffering\" was intended to apply to those who, by\r\nreason of the misfortunes of this life, are compelled to look beyond\r\nthemselves and their surroundings for comfort, and who in all ages and\r\namong all peoples have turned their thoughts toward a Divine Being for\r\ncomfort. I merely intended to say, in a very mild and harmless way,\r\nthat the consolations of a religion based upon a belief in a Divine\r\nProvidence are necessary for _suffering_ humanity, and my immediate\r\nreference to Cardinal Newman by way of contrast in almost the same\r\nlanguage clearly shows this to be the true meaning of my remarks. The\r\nemphasis was on the word \"suffering,\" which was not intended to\r\ninclude more than a fraction of mankind.\r\n\r\nI am obliged to you for your reference to Mr. Gladstone, who in his\r\nlast illness illustrated most fully what I had in my mind. However\r\ngreat his pain, or cheerless the outlook, he continually with serene\r\ncheerfulness murmured, \"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\" and \"Our\r\nFather,\" etc. It is perhaps unnecessary to add that I am sorry that\r\nany one has been led to believe that I underrate the value of the life\r\nand work of Herbert Spencer.\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to refer to the statement in your editorial, \"Again\r\ndealing with the modern scientific view, that in the development of\r\nthe human individual all antecedent stages of human development are\r\n_in a manner_ passed through,\" etc., in order that I may express my\r\nregret that you seem to vitiate the force of the statement altogether\r\nby the use of the unscientific phrase \"in a manner.\" The tremendous\r\nconsequences growing out of the view make serious and exact definition\r\nand treatment imperative, and I had hoped that I was entering upon a\r\nhelpful discussion of it, but was greatly disappointed. I am also\r\nunwilling to believe that students of Emerson will be easily convinced\r\nthat he looked at life \"from a stationary point of view,\" but I do not\r\nfeel that I can claim your valuable time for a discussion of this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMay I trust your forbearance in pointing out a manifest misconception\r\nin your statement, \"We are not imposed upon by childish imitations of\r\nmature virtues\"? The remark indicates that you have not been brought\r\ninto immediate association with school children in a schoolroom, at\r\nleast in recent years.\r\n\r\nI refer very reluctantly, but I trust without seeming egotism, to your\r\nremarks touching my election to the position which I hold. I am\r\ninnocent of all responsibility in the matter. I had no \"pull\" (is the\r\nterm scientific?). I wrote to the board declining to be a candidate. I\r\nrefused to allow my friends to speak to the members of the board in my\r\nbehalf; I preferred the position (Principal of the St. Paul High\r\nSchool) which I had held for years, and I accepted the office with\r\nmuch hesitation; but the intimation that our Board of School\r\nInspectors, composed of business men in every way highly esteemed by\r\nthe citizens of St. Paul, and deemed worthy of all confidence, had\r\nbeen actuated by unworthy motives, is entirely gratuitous and out of\r\nplace in a journal such as you would have us believe yours to be.\r\nCould there be offered better evidence of haste and unfairness than\r\nthis uncalled-for assault upon those of whom you know absolutely\r\nnothing, and does it not show the scientific inclination to have\r\ntheory with or without facts, but certainly theory?\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,                          A.J. SMITH,\r\n                                     _Superintendent of Schools_.\r\n\r\n  ST. PAUL, MINN., _January 4, 1899_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe took the report of Superintendent Smith's address which appeared in\r\nthe St. Paul papers. If there were any \"typographical errors\" in our\r\nquotations, they were not of our making; and Mr. Smith admits that,\r\nsuch as they were, they did not affect the sense. Well, then, we found\r\nMr. Smith using his position as Superintendent of Schools to disparage\r\na man whom the scientific world holds in the highest honor, and for\r\nwhom he now tells us he himself has \"a great regard\"--whose writings\r\nhe has \"read with much profit.\" We judged the speaker by his own\r\nwords, and certainly drew an unfavorable inference as to his knowledge\r\nand mental breadth. If Mr. Smith did injustice to himself by speaking\r\nin an unguarded way, or by not fully expressing his meaning, that was\r\nnot our fault; and we do not think we can properly be accused of\r\nhaving lapsed into abuse. The explanation he offers of his language\r\nregarding Mr. Spencer is wholly unsatisfactory. He gave his hearers to\r\nunderstand that there was an \"old man\" in London who had devoted all\r\nhis energies to creating a system of thought which should entirely\r\nignore the name of the Deity, and of whom, after his death, it would\r\nnot be remembered that he had \"ever performed an act or said a word\r\nthat blessed or comforted or relieved his suffering fellows.\" The\r\nstress, he now says, should be laid on the word \"suffering.\" He did\r\nnot wish to imply that Mr. Spencer had not bettered the condition of\r\nhis fellows generally; he only meant that he had done nothing for the\r\n_suffering_. On this we have two remarks to make: First, it is not\r\nusual, when a man is acknowledged to have given a long lifetime to\r\nuseful work, to hold him up to reprobation because he is not known to\r\nhave had a special mission to the \"suffering\"; and, second, that no\r\nman can be of service to mankind at large without being of benefit to\r\nthe suffering. It is mainly because Mr. Spencer believes so strongly\r\nin the broad virtues of justice and humanity, has so unbounded a faith\r\nin the efficacy of what may be called a sound social hygiene, that he\r\nhas had, comparatively, so little to say upon the topics which most\r\ninterest those who apply themselves specifically, but not always\r\nwisely, to alleviating the miseries and distresses of humanity.\r\n\r\nAs to the means by which Mr. Smith obtained his present position, we\r\nknow nothing beyond what he now tells us. We saw his appointment\r\ncriticised as an unsuitable one in the St. Paul papers; and his\r\npublished remarks seemed to justify the criticism. There are\r\n\"pulls\"--the word is \"scientific\" enough for our purpose--even in\r\nschool matters; and it seemed that this was just such a case as a\r\n\"pull\" would most naturally explain. We quite accept, however,\r\nSuperintendent Smith's statement as to the facts; and we sincerely\r\ntrust that the next address he delivers to his teachers will better\r\njustify his appointment than did the one on which we felt it a duty to\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERSON AND EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n  _Editor Popular Science Monthly_:\r\n\r\nSIR: The editorial in the December Popular Science Monthly on the\r\nrelations of Emerson to evolution must have surprised many of the\r\nstudents of Emerson. A little over two years ago Moncure D. Conway\r\npointed out (Open Court, 1896) that soon after his resignation from\r\nthe pulpit of the Unitarian Church with which he was last connected,\r\nEmerson taught zoölogy, botany, paleontology, and geology, and that he\r\nwas a pronounced evolutionist who used in his lectures the argument in\r\nfavor of evolution drawn from the practical identity of the\r\nextremities of the vertebrates. That Emerson was an evolutionist of\r\nthe Goethean type is clear from most of his essays. In an essay\r\nappearing before the Origin of Species, he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The electric word pronounced by John Hunter a hundred years ago,\r\n_arrested and progressive development_, indicating the way upward from\r\nthe invisible protoplasm to the highest organisms, gave the poetic key\r\nto Natural Science, of which the theories of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,\r\nof Oken, of Goethe, of Agassiz and Owen and Darwin in zoölogy and\r\nbotany are the fruits--a hint whose power is not exhausted, showing\r\nunity and perfect order in physics.\r\n\r\n\"The hardest chemist, the severest analyzer, scornful of all but the\r\ndriest fact, is forced to keep the poetic curve of Nature, and his\r\nresults are like a myth of Theocritus. All multiplicity rushes to be\r\nresolved into unity. Anatomy, osteology, exhibit arrested or\r\nprogressive ascent in each kind; the lower pointing to the higher\r\nforms, the higher to the highest, from the fluid in an elastic sac,\r\nfrom radiate, mollusk, articulate, vertebrate, up to man; as if the\r\nwhole animal world were only a Hunterian museum to exhibit the genesis\r\nof mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Darwin to whom reference is made in this essay is not Charles, but\r\nhis grandfather, one of the poets of evolution, Erasmus. The essay\r\nalso shows the belief in evolution held by both Owen and Louis Agassiz\r\nbefore theological timidity made them unprogressive. The names quoted\r\nillustrate further the factors which influenced Emerson's thought in\r\nregard to evolution. Saint-Hilaire gave the _coup de grâce_ to\r\nCuvier's fight against evolution. Oken is one of the great pioneers of\r\nevolution. Goethe shares with Empedocles, Lucretius, and Erasmus\r\nDarwin the great honor of being a poet of evolution. Of the four,\r\nGoethe was by all odds the greatest. To him, the doctrine of evolution\r\nwas of more importance than the downfall of a despot. The eve of the\r\nRevolution of 1830 found him watching over the dispute between Cuvier\r\nand Saint-Hilaire with an interest that obscured every other.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' remarked Goethe to Soret,\" (Conversations with Eckermann)\r\n\"'what do you think of this great event? The volcano has burst forth,\r\nall in flames, and there are no more negotiations behind closed\r\ndoors.' 'A dreadful affair,' I answered, 'but what else could be\r\nexpected under the circumstances, and with such a ministry, except\r\nthat it would end in the expulsion of the present royal family?' 'We\r\ndo not seem to understand each other, my dear friend,' replied Goethe.\r\n'I am not speaking of those people at all; I am interested in\r\nsomething very different. I mean the dispute between Cuvier and\r\nGeoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, which has broken out in the Academy, and\r\nwhich is of such great importance to science.' This remark of Goethe's\r\ncame upon me so unexpectedly that I did not know what to say, and my\r\nthoughts for some minutes seemed to have come to a complete\r\nstandstill. 'The affair is of the utmost importance,' he continued,\r\n'and you can not form any idea of what I felt on receiving the news of\r\nthe meeting on the 19th. In Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire we have now a\r\nmighty ally for a long time to come. But I see also how great the\r\nsympathy of the French scientific world must be in this affair, for,\r\nin spite of a terrible political excitement, the meeting on the 19th\r\nwas attended by a full house. The best of it is, however, that the\r\nsynthetic treatment of Nature introduced into France by Geoffroy\r\nSaint-Hilaire can now no longer be stopped. This matter has now become\r\npublic through the discussion in the Academy carried on in the\r\npresence of a large audience; it can no longer be referred to secret\r\ncommittees or be settled or suppressed behind closed doors.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious to any reader of Emerson's essays that Goethe exercised\r\nan enormous influence over him, and that Emerson was much more in\r\nsympathy with Goethe than was the fetichistic dualist Carlyle. This\r\ninfluence of Goethe over Emerson's views of evolution is clearly\r\nevident in the citation already made.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary views of Emerson appear so frequently in his essays\r\nthat it is astonishing that he should have been misunderstood. The\r\ncitation by the Minneapolis clergyman from the essay on Nature that\r\n\"man is fallen\" does not refer to the Adamic fall, but the\r\ndegenerating influence of cities. At the slightest glance, the\r\nevolutionary tendency of this essay on Nature is evident. In the\r\nparagraph immediately after that containing the reference to fallen\r\nman occurs the following:\r\n\r\n\"But taking timely warning and leaving many things unsaid on this\r\ntopic, let us not longer omit our homage to the efficient Nature,\r\n_natura naturans_, the quick cause before which all forms flee as the\r\ndriven snows, itself secret, its works driven before it in flocks and\r\nmultitudes (as the ancient represented Nature by Proteus, a shepherd),\r\nand in indescribable variety. It published itself in creatures\r\nreaching from particles and spicula through transformation on\r\ntransformation to the highest symmetries, arriving at consummate\r\nresults without a shock or a leap. A little heat, that is a little\r\nmotion, is all that differences the bald dazzling white and deadly\r\ncold poles of the earth from the prolific tropical climates. All\r\nchanges pass without violence by reason of the two cardinal conditions\r\nof boundless space and boundless time. Geology has initiated us into\r\nthe secularity of Nature and taught us to disuse our school-dame\r\nmeasure and exchange our Mosaic and Ptolemaic scheme for her large\r\nstyle. We knew nothing rightly for want of perspective. Now we learn\r\nwhat patient ages must round themselves before the rock is broken and\r\nthe first lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external plate\r\ninto soil and opened the door for the remote flora, fauna, Ceres and\r\nPomona to come in. How far off yet is the trilobite, how far the\r\nquadruped, how inconceivably remote is man! All duly arrive, and then\r\nrace after race of men. It is a long way from granite to the oyster;\r\nfarther yet to Plato and the preaching of the immortality of the soul.\r\nYet all must come, as surely as the first atom has two sides.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to multiply citations along this line to\r\ndemonstrate not only that Emerson was an evolutionist, but that his\r\nwhole philosophy was pervaded by the doctrine. It should be remembered\r\nthat, at the time Emerson wrote, evolution had won wide favor among\r\nthinkers and that the success of the Origin of Species was an\r\nevidence, not of the creation of the evolution sentiment by that work,\r\nbut of a pre-existing mental current in favor of evolution.\r\n\r\n                                      Very respectfully,\r\n                                          HARRIET C.B. ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n  CHICAGO, _December 20, 1898_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor's Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE NEW SUPERSTITION._\r\n\r\nThe death of a prominent man of letters in the hands of certain\r\nindividuals of the \"Christian Science\" persuasion has given rise to a\r\ngood deal of serious discussion as to the principles and practices of\r\nthat extraordinary sect. That a considerable number of persons should\r\nhave banded themselves together to ignore medical science, and apply\r\n\"thought\" as a remedy for all physical ills, has excited no little\r\nalarm and indignation in various quarters. Some of the severest\r\ncriticisms of this outbreak of irrationality have come from the\r\nreligious press, which takes the ground that, while the Bible\r\ndoubtless contains numerous accounts of miraculous healing, it\r\nnevertheless fully recognizes the efficacy of material remedies. A\r\n\"beloved physician\" is credited with the authorship of one of the\r\ngospels and of the book of Acts. An apostle recommends a friend to\r\n\"take a little wine for his stomach's sake and his often infirmities.\"\r\nThe man who was attacked by robbers had his wounds treated in the\r\nusual way. The soothing effect of ointments is recognized; and the\r\ndisturbing effects of undue indulgence in the wine cup are forcibly\r\ndescribed. The peculiar character of a miracle, it is contended, lies\r\nin the fact that it passes over natural agencies; but, because these\r\nmay be dispensed with by Divine Power, they are not the less\r\nspecifically efficacious in their own place.\r\n\r\nThese, and such as these, are the arguments which are urged by the\r\nrepresentatives of orthodox religion against the new heresy, or, as we\r\nhave called it, \"the new superstition.\" To argue against it on\r\nscientific grounds would be almost too ridiculous. When people make a\r\ndenial of the laws of matter the basis of their creed, we can only\r\nleave them to work it out with Nature. They will find that, like all\r\nthe world, they are subject to the law of gravitation and to the laws\r\nof chemistry and physics. If one of them happens to be run over by a\r\nrailway train the usual results will follow; and so of a multitude of\r\nconceivable accidents. A Christian Scientist who \"blows out the gas\"\r\nwill be asphyxiated just like anybody else; and if he walks off the\r\nwharf into the water he will require rescue or resuscitation just as\r\nif he were a plain \"Christian\" or a plain \"scientist.\" Like Shylock,\r\nhe is \"fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to\r\nthe same diseases\" as the rest of the community; and little by little\r\nthe eternal course of things will chastise his extravagant fancies\r\ninto reasonable accord with facts.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, we have not much apprehension that the health of\r\nthe community will suffer, or the death rate go up, as the result of\r\nthis new craze. On the contrary, we rather expect that any influence\r\nit may have in these respects will, on the whole, be for the better;\r\nand for a very simple reason: The laws of health are not so difficult\r\nto master, and, as every adherent of \"Christian Science\" will be\r\nanxious to reflect credit on it by the satisfactory condition of his\r\nor her personal health, we quite believe that in the new sect more\r\ndiseases will be avoided than incurred. Moreover, the elevated\r\ncondition of mind of these enthusiasts makes in itself for health, so\r\nlong as it does not turn to hysteria. We certainly can not refuse all\r\nsympathy to people who make it a principle to enjoy good health. Of\r\ncourse, if they were thoroughly consistent, they might do mischief in\r\ndirect proportion to their numbers. A \"Christian-Science\" school board\r\nwho did not believe in ventilating or adequately warming school rooms,\r\nholding that it made no difference whether the children breathed pure\r\nair or air laden with carbon dioxide and ptomaines, or whether or not\r\nthey were exposed to chills and draughts, would be about as\r\nmischievous a body of men as could well be imagined. If \"Christian\r\nScience\" in the house means an indifference to the ordinary physical\r\nsafeguards of health, it will quickly make a very evil repute for\r\nitself. But, as we have already said, we do not anticipate these\r\nresults. Having undertaken to avoid and to cure diseases by \"thinking\r\ntruth,\" we believe our friends of the new persuasion will think enough\r\ntruth to get what benefit is to be got from cleanliness, fresh air,\r\nand wholesome food,--and that will be quite a quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EMERSON._\r\n\r\nWe publish on another page a letter from a correspondent who thinks\r\nthat much injustice is done to Emerson in the remarks we quoted in our\r\nDecember number from Mr. J.J. Chapman's recent volume of essays. What\r\nMr. Chapman said was, in effect, that Emerson had not placed himself\r\nin line with the modern doctrine of evolution--that he was probably\r\n\"the last great writer to look at life from a stationary standpoint.\"\r\nMrs. Alexander says in reply that Emerson was an evolutionist before\r\nDarwin, having learned the doctrine from Goethe and made it a\r\nfundamental principle of his philosophy. No one who has read Mr.\r\nChapman's essay could think for a moment that there was any intention\r\non his part to deal ungenerously or unfairly with the great writer of\r\nwhom America is so justly proud; nor would many readers be disposed to\r\nquestion his competence to pronounce a sound judgment upon his\r\nsubject. There must, therefore, it seems to us, be some way of\r\nreconciling the verdict of Mr. Chapman with the claims set forth in\r\nour correspondent's letter.\r\n\r\nThe true statement of the case doubtless is that Emerson received the\r\ndoctrine of evolution--so far as he received it--as a poet. He\r\nwelcomed the conception of a gradual unfolding of the universe, and a\r\ngradually higher development of life; but it dwelt in his mind rather\r\nas a poetical imagination than as a scientific theory. The consequence\r\nwas that he was still able to speak in the old absolute manner of many\r\nthings which the man of science can only discuss from a relative\r\nstandpoint. When, for example, Emerson says, \"All goes to show that\r\nthe soul in man is not an organ, but animates and exercises all the\r\norgans; is not a function, like the power of memory, of calculation,\r\nof comparison, but uses these as hands and feet; is not a faculty, but\r\na light; is not the intellect or the will, but the master of the\r\nintellect and the will; is the background of our being in which they\r\nlie--an immensity not possessed and that can not be possessed\"--he may\r\nbe uttering the sentence of a divine philosophy, or the deep intuition\r\nof a poet; but he is not speaking the language of science, nor\r\nevincing any sense of the restrictions which science might place on\r\nsuch expressions of opinion. Certainly he is not at the standpoint of\r\nevolution; and it is very hard to believe that the views he announces\r\ncould in any way be harmonized with, say, Mr. Spencer's Principles of\r\nPsychology. Or take such a passage as the following: \"All the facts of\r\nthe animal economy--sex, nutriment, gestation, birth, growth--are\r\nsymbols of the passage of the world into the soul of man, to suffer\r\nthere a change and reappear a new and higher fact. He uses forms\r\naccording to the life, and not according to the form. This is true\r\nscience. The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation, and\r\nanimation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs them as\r\nsigns. He knows why the plain or meadow of space was strewn with those\r\nflowers we call suns and moons and stars; why the great deep is\r\nadorned with animals, with men, and gods; for in every word he speaks\r\nhe rides on them as the horses of thought.\" Now, we should be sorry to\r\ncrumple one leaf in the laurel wreath of the poet; but is there much\r\nsense in saying that he is our only astronomer, or that he could\r\ninform us why suns and planets were disposed through space so as to\r\nmake the forms we see? We do not think Goethe held these ideas; if he\r\ndid, they were certainly not part of his evolution philosophy. The\r\ndoctrine of evolution is not at war, we trust, with poetic\r\ninspiration; but if it teaches anything, it teaches that the world is\r\nfull of infinite detail, and that without a certain mastery of details\r\ngeneral views are apt to be more showy than solid. It also brings home\r\nto the mind very forcibly that one can only be sure of carefully\r\nverified facts, and, even of these, ought not to be too sure. It\r\nteaches that time and place and circumstance are, for all practical\r\npurposes, of the essence of the things we have to consider; that\r\nnothing is just what it would be if differently conditioned. There is\r\nnothing of which Emerson discourses with so much positiveness as the\r\nsoul, an entity of which the serious evolutionist can only speak with\r\nall possible reserve. The evolutionist labors to construct a\r\npsychology; but Emerson has a psychology ready-made, and scatters its\r\naffirmations with a liberal hand through every chapter of his\r\nwritings. That these are stimulating in a high degree to well-disposed\r\nminds we should be sorry to deny. They are a source, which for many\r\nlong years will not run dry, of high thoughts and noble aspirations.\r\nNo one has more worthily or loftily discoursed of the value of life\r\nthan has the New England philosopher; and for this the world owes him\r\na permanent debt of gratitude. But he was not an evolutionist in the\r\nmodern sense--that is, in the scientific sense. If, as Mr. Chapman\r\nsays, he was the last great writer to look at life from a stationary\r\nstandpoint, then we can only add that the old philosophy had a golden\r\nsunset in his pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL BOOKS.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many different ways of conceiving the science of\r\nsociety, and until the study of the subject is more advanced than it\r\nis as yet, it would be rash to set up any one method as superior to\r\nall others. All that can reasonably be asked is that the subject\r\nshould be approached with a competent knowledge of what has\r\npreviously been thought and written in regard to it, that the aspects\r\npresented should possess intrinsic importance, and that the treatment\r\nshould be scientific. The work which Professor _Giddings_ has\r\npublished under the title of _Elements of Sociology_[35] fulfills\r\nthese conditions entirely, and we consider it, after careful\r\nexamination, as admirably adapted to the purpose it is meant to\r\nserve--namely, as \"a text book for colleges and schools.\" For use in\r\nschools--that is to say, in secondary schools of the ordinary\r\nrange--the treatment may be a little too elaborate, but for college\r\nuse we should say that it is, so far as method is concerned, precisely\r\nwhat is wanted. We do not know any other work which gives in the same\r\ncompass so interesting and satisfactory an analysis of the\r\nconstitution and development of society, or so many suggestive views\r\nas to the springs of social action and the conditions of social\r\nwell-being. Professor Giddings writes in a clear and vigorous style,\r\nand the careful student will notice many passages marked by great\r\nfelicity of expression. In a text-book designed to attract the young\r\nto a subject calling for considerable concentration of attention, this\r\nis an advantage that can hardly be overestimated.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter the writer gives us his definition of society as\r\n\"any group or number of individuals who cultivate acquaintance and\r\nmental agreement--that is to say, like-mindedness.\" The unit of\r\ninvestigation in sociology is declared to be the individual member of\r\nsociety, or, as the writer calls him, in relation to the investigation\r\nin hand, the \"socius.\" Whether in strict logic the unit of\r\ninvestigation in _sociology_ can be the individual, even granting, as\r\nmust be done, that he is born social, is a point on which we are not\r\nfully satisfied. We should be disposed to think that the study of the\r\nindividual was rather what Mr. Spencer would call a \"preparation\" for\r\nsociology than an integral part of the science itself. From a\r\npractical point of view, however, it must be conceded that a treatise\r\non sociology would begin somewhat abruptly if it did not present in\r\nthe first place an adequate description of the \"socius,\" especially\r\nsetting forth those qualifications and tendencies which fit and impel\r\nhim to enter into relations with other members of the human race.\r\nChapter V of the present work deals with The Practical Activities of\r\nSocii, and shows in an interesting manner what may be called the lines\r\nof approach of individuals to one another in society. Sometimes the\r\napproach is by means of conflict, and the writer shows how this may be\r\na preparation for peaceful relations through the insight it gives into\r\nopposing points of view. He distinguishes between primary and\r\nsecondary conflict--the first being a struggle in which one individual\r\nviolently strives to suppress or subdue an opposing personality, the\r\nsecond a mere trial of differing opinions and tastes, leading often to\r\na profitable readjustment of individual standpoints.\r\n\r\nChapter X, entitled The Classes of Socii, is an excellent one. The\r\nauthor classifies socii with reference (1) to vitality, (2) to\r\npersonality--i.e. personal resource and capacity--and (3) to social\r\nfeeling. Under the third classification he distinguishes (1) the\r\nsocial class, (2) the non-social class, (3) the pseudo-social class,\r\nand (4) the anti-social class. The first of these, the \"social class,\"\r\nis well characterized as follows: \"Their distinguishing characteristic\r\nis a consciousness of kind that is wide in its scope and strong in\r\nits intensity. They are sympathetic, friendly, helpful, and always\r\ninterested in endeavoring to perfect social relations, to develop the\r\nmethods of co-operation, to add to the happiness of mankind by\r\nimproving the forms of social pleasure, to preserve the great social\r\ninstitutions of the family and the state. To this class the entire\r\npopulation turns for help, inspiration, and leadership, for unselfish\r\nloyalty and wise enterprise. It includes all who in the true sense of\r\nthe word are philanthropic, all whose self-sacrifice is directed by\r\nsound judgment, all true reformers whose zeal is tempered by common\r\nsense and sober patience, and all those who give expression to the\r\nideals and aspirations of the community for a larger and better life.\"\r\nThe Pre-eminent Social Class is further discussed in Chapter XII; and\r\nthe subsequent chapters, as far as, and including, XIX, describe the\r\nprocesses by which social results in the balancing of interests,\r\nestablishment of rights, assimilation of characters, and general\r\nimprovement of social conditions, are realized. The limits which\r\nexpediency sets to the pursuit of \"like-mindedness\" are well shown,\r\nand the advantage and necessity for social progress of free discussion\r\nand wide toleration of individual differences are strongly insisted\r\non. Chapter XX deals with The Early History of Society, and contains\r\nthe statement that \"from an apelike creature, no longer perfectly\r\nrepresented in any existing species, the human race is descended.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of Democracy is well treated in a special chapter (XXIV).\r\nThe author is of opinion that, if the natural leaders of society do\r\ntheir duty, they will wield a moral influence that will give a right\r\ndirection to public policy, and secure the continuous advance of the\r\ncommunity in prosperity and true civilization. The \"if\" is an\r\nimportant one, but the author has strong hope, in which all his\r\nreaders will certainly wish to share, that in the main everything will\r\nturn out well.\r\n\r\nThe remarks on the State in Chapter XXIII are, as far as they go,\r\njudicious; but we could have wished that the author, who we are sure\r\ndesires to make his treatise as practically useful as possible, had\r\ndwelt somewhat on the dangers of over-legislation, and had brought\r\ninto fuller relief than he has done the difference between state\r\naction and voluntary enterprise, arising from the fact that the former\r\nalways involves the element of _compulsion_. We pass a law when we can\r\nnot get our neighbor to co-operate or agree with us in something, and\r\nconsequently resolve to compel him. Surely this consideration should\r\nsuffice to make parsimony the first principle of legislation. We agree\r\nwith our author that it is not well to \"belittle\" the state (page\r\n214), but it is hardly belittling the state to wish to be very sparing\r\nin our appeals to it for the exercise of coercive power.\r\n\r\nWe miss also in the work before us such a treatment of the _family_ as\r\nmight have been introduced into it with advantage. The family\r\ncertainly has an important relation to the individual, and in all\r\ncivilized countries it is specially recognized by the state. Mr.\r\nSpencer, in the chapter of his Study of Sociology entitled Preparation\r\nin Psychology, has dwelt on the encroachments of the state on the\r\nfamily; and Mr. Pearson, in his National Life and Character, published\r\nhalf a dozen years ago, sounded a note of alarm on the same subject.\r\nWhat position Professor Giddings would have taken as to the importance\r\nof family life and the rights and duties of the family we do not, of\r\ncourse, know; but we are disposed to think he could have increased the\r\nusefulness and interest of his book by some discussion of these\r\npoints. We would only further say that, while the book is specially\r\nintended for scholastic use, it is well adapted for general reading,\r\nand that it could not be read carefully by any one without profit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProf. _Wesley Mills_ holds the opinion that in the present stage of\r\nthe study of animal life,[36] facts are much more desirable than\r\ntheories. Experiment and observation must go on for many years before\r\ngeneralizations will be worth the making. Putting this belief into\r\npractice, he has bred and reared a large number of animals, making\r\nmost careful notes on their physical and mental development, and\r\nfurnishes in his book, resulting from these studies, a contribution of\r\nunquestionable value to comparative psychology.\r\n\r\nIn his investigation of the habits of squirrels, he finds the red\r\nsquirrel, or chickaree, much more intelligent than the chipmunk. The\r\nlatter is easily trapped, but the former profits by experience and is\r\nrarely secured a second time. These little creatures are also adepts\r\nin feigning. Two examples are cited in which squirrels apparently ill\r\nrecovered rapidly when left alone and made their escape in vigorous\r\nfashion. Many instances of animals shamming death are judged to be\r\ncases of catalepsy induced by excessive fear. The chickaree is also\r\ncredited with some musical capacity, one being observed, when excited,\r\nto utter tones that were birdlike; whence it is concluded \"likely that\r\nthroughout the order _Rodentia_ a genuine musical appreciation exists,\r\nand considerable ability in expressing states of emotion by vocal\r\nforms.\"\r\n\r\nWhile experimenting with hibernating animals, Professor Mills kept a\r\nwoodchuck in confinement five years, and noted that it had a drowsy or\r\ntorpid period from November to April. Another specimen subjected to\r\nthe same conditions did not hibernate for an hour during the entire\r\nseason. Bats began to hibernate at 45° to 40° F., and were so affected\r\nby temperature that they could be worked like a machine by varying it.\r\nThe woodchuck, however, was comparatively independent of heat and\r\ncold, but very sensitive to storms. This is found to be true of many\r\nwild animals, that they \"have a delicate perception of meteorological\r\nconditions, making them wiser than they know, for they act reflexly.\"\r\n\r\nSome records are given of cases of lethargy among human beings, and in\r\nregard to these, as well as normal sleep and hibernation, it is\r\nsuggested that their conditioning and variability throw great light\r\nupon the evolution of function.\r\n\r\nIn order to observe closely the psychic development of young animals,\r\nProfessor Mills raised families of dogs, cats, chickens, rabbits,\r\nguinea-pigs, and pigeons. The data obtained by him, given in the form\r\nof diaries with comparisons and conclusions, constitute Part III, the\r\nlarger half of the book, unquestionably first in importance and\r\ninterest. It is scarcely possible to overvalue careful studies like\r\nthese, undertaken not to justify theories, but to bring to light\r\nwhatever truths may be apprehended of the nature of growth and\r\nconnection of mind and body.\r\n\r\nThe last division of the book contains the discussions on instinct by\r\nProfessors Mills, Lloyd Morgan, Baldwin, and others, first published\r\nin Science. The beginning of the volume, devoted to a general\r\nconsideration of the subject, consists of papers on methods of study\r\nand comparative psychology which have appeared in various scientific\r\nperiodicals, including this magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTICES.\r\n\r\nIn _Four-Footed Americans and their Kin_[37] a similar method is\r\napplied by _Mabel Osgood Wright_ to the study of animals to that which\r\nwas followed with reference to ornithology in Citizen Bird. The\r\nsubject is taught in the form of a story, with dramatic incident and\r\nadventure, and miniature exploration, and the animals are allowed\r\noccasionally to converse and express their opinions and feelings. The\r\nscene of the action is \"Orchard Farm and twenty miles around.\" Dr.\r\nHunter and his daughter and colored \"mammy\" have returned there to\r\ntheir home after several years of travel, with two city youths who\r\nhave been invited to spend the summer at the place and are told the\r\nstory of the birds. Another family have come to make an autumn visit,\r\nbut it is arranged that they should spend the winter at the farm.\r\n\"What they did, and how they became acquainted with the four-footed\r\nAmericans, is told in this story.\" Most of the common animals of the\r\nUnited States are met or described in the course of the party's\r\nwandering, as creatures of life rather than as in the cold and formal\r\nway of treating museum specimens, and a great deal of the lore of\r\nother branches of natural history is introduced, as it would naturally\r\ncome in in such excursions as were taken. The scientific accuracy of\r\nthe book is assured by the participation of Mr. Frank M. Chapman as\r\neditor. At the end a Ladder for climbing the Family Tree of the North\r\nAmerican Mammals is furnished in the shape of a table of\r\nclassification; and an index of English names is given. The\r\nillustrations, by Ernest Seton Thompson, give lifelike portraits and\r\nattitudes and are very attractive.\r\n\r\n_St. George Mivart_, whose enviable reputation as a specialist in\r\nnatural history has perhaps given some justification for his attempts\r\nat philosophy, has recently published a new philosophical work\r\nentitled _The Groundwork of Science_[38]. It is an effort to work out\r\nthe ultimate facts on which our knowledge, and hence all science, is\r\nbased. A short preface and introductory chapter are devoted to a\r\nstatement of the aims of the work and some general remarks regarding\r\nthe history of the scientific method. An enumeration of the sciences\r\nand an indication of some of their logical relations are next given.\r\nThe third chapter, entitled The Objects of Science, is given up\r\nchiefly to a refutation of idealism. The methods of science, its\r\nphysical, psychical, and intellectual antecedents, language and\r\nscience, causes of scientific knowledge, and the nature of the\r\ngroundwork of science are the special topics of the remaining\r\nchapters. The general scheme of the inquiry is based on the theory\r\nthat the groundwork of science consists of three divisions. \"The\r\nlaborers who work, the tools they must employ, and that which\r\nconstitutes the field of their labor.... Science is partly physical\r\nand partly psychical.... The tools are those first principles and\r\nuniversal, necessary, self-evident truths which lie so frequently\r\nunnoticed in the human intellect, and which are absolutely\r\nindispensable for valid reasoning.... The nature of the workers must\r\nalso be noticed as necessarily affecting the value of their work....\r\nAnd, last of all, a few words must be devoted to the question whether\r\nthere is any and, if any, what foundation underlying the whole\r\ngroundwork of science.\" The result at which the author arrives is\r\nstated as follows: \"The groundwork of science is the work of\r\nself-conscious material organisms making use of the marvelous first\r\nprinciples which they possess in exploring all the physical and\r\npsychical phenomena of the universe, which sense, intuition, and\r\nratiocination can anyhow reveal to them as real existences, whether\r\nactual or only possible.... The foundation of science can only be\r\nsought in that reason which evidently to us pervades the universe,\r\nand is that by which our intellect has been both produced and\r\nillumined.\"\r\n\r\nA large amount of information, mainly of a practical character, has\r\nbeen gathered by Mr. _William J. Clark_ in his book on _Commercial\r\nCuba_[39]--information, as Mr. Gould well says in the introduction he\r\nhas contributed to the work, covering almost the entire field of\r\ninquiry regarding Cuba and its resources. The data have been partly\r\ngained from the author's personal observation and during his travels\r\non the island, and partly through laborious and painstaking\r\nclassification of existing material, collected from many and diverse\r\nsources. The subject is systematically treated. The first chapter--How\r\nto Meet the Resident of Cuba--relates to the behavior of visitors to\r\nthe island, really a considerably more important matter than it would\r\nbe in this country, for the Spaniards are strict in their regard for\r\ncorrect etiquette. It is natural that a chapter on the population and\r\nits characteristics and occupations should follow this. Even more\r\nimportant than correct behavior--to any one at least but a\r\nSpaniard--is the subject of climate and the preservation of health;\r\nand whatever is of moment in relation to these subjects is given in\r\nthe chapter devoted to them. Next the geographical characteristics of\r\nCuba are described, and the facilities and methods of transportation\r\nand communication; also social and political matters, including\r\ngovernment, banking, and commercial finance, and legal and\r\nadministrative systems of the past and future. A chapter is given to\r\nAnimal and Vegetable Life, another to Sugar and Tobacco, and a third\r\nto Some General Statistics, after which the several provinces--Pinar\r\ndel Rio, the city and province of Havana (including the Isle of\r\nPines), and the provinces of Matanzas, Santa Clara, Puerto Principe,\r\nand Santiago--are described in detail, with their physical\r\ncharacteristics, their agricultural or mining resources, their various\r\ntowns, and whatever else in them is of interest to the student of\r\neconomics. A Cuban Business Directory is given in the appendix.\r\n\r\nA Collection of Essays is the modest designation which Professors\r\n_J.C. Arthur_ and _D.T. MacDougal_ give to the scientific papers\r\nincluded in their book on _Living Plants and their Properties_.[40]\r\nThe authors deserve all praise for having taken the pains without\r\nwhich no book composed of occasional pieces can be made complete and\r\nsymmetrical, to revise and rewrite the articles, omitting parts \"less\r\nrelevant in the present connection,\" and amplifying others \"to meet\r\nthe demands of continuity, clearness, and harmony with current\r\nbotanical thought.\" Of the twelve papers, those on the Special Senses\r\nof Plants, Wild Lettuce, Universality of Consciousness and Pain, Two\r\nOpposing Factors of Increase, The Right to Live, and Distinction\r\nbetween Plants and Animals, are by Professor Arthur; and those on The\r\nDevelopment of Irritability, Mimosa--a Typical Sensitive Plant, The\r\nEffect of Cold, Chlorophyll and Growth, Leaves in Spring, Summer, and\r\nAutumn, and the Significance of Color, are by Professor MacDougal.\r\nBased to a large extent on original investigations or careful studies,\r\nthey present many novel thoughts and aspects, and constitute an\r\nacceptable addition to popular botanical literature.\r\n\r\nHaving described the great and growing interest taken in child study,\r\nPresident _A.R. Taylor_ announces as the principal aim of his book,\r\n_The Study of the Child_,[41] to bring the subject within the average\r\ncomprehension of the teacher and parent. Besides avoiding as much as\r\npossible technical terms and scientific formulas, the author has made\r\nthe desire to announce new principles subservient to that of assisting\r\nhis fellow-workers to a closer relationship with the child. As\r\nteachers and parents generally think it extremely difficult to pursue\r\nthe study of the child without at least a fair understanding of the\r\nelements of psychology, the author intimates that they often forget\r\nthat the study will give them that very knowledge, and that, properly\r\npursued, it is the best possible introduction to psychology in\r\ngeneral. Every chapter in the present book, he says, is an attempt to\r\norganize the knowledge already possessed by those who know little or\r\nnothing of scientific psychology, and to assist them to inquiries\r\nwhich will give a clearer apprehension of the nature and possibilities\r\nof the child. The treatise begins with the wakening of the child to\r\nconscious life through the senses, the nature and workings of each of\r\nwhich are described. The bridge over from the physical to the mental\r\nis found in consciousness, which for the present purpose is defined as\r\nthe self knowing its own states or activities. The idea of identity\r\nand difference arises, symbols are invented or suggested, and language\r\nis made possible. The features of language peculiar to children are\r\nconsidered. Muscular or motor control, the feelings, and the will are\r\ntreated as phases or factors in development, and their functions are\r\ndefined. The intellect and its various functions are discussed with\r\nconsiderable fullness; and chapters on The Self, Habit, and Character;\r\nChildren's Instincts and Plays; Manners and Morals; Normals and\r\nAbnormals; and Stages of Growth, Fatigue Point, etc., follow. A very\r\nsatisfactory bibliography is appended.\r\n\r\n_The Discharge of Electricity through Gases_[42] is an expansion of\r\nfour lectures given by the author, Prof. _J.J. Thomson_, of the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, at Princeton University in October, 1896.\r\nSome results published between the delivery and printing of the\r\nlectures are added. The author begins by noticing the contrast between\r\nthe variety and complexity of electrical phenomena that occur when\r\nmatter is present in the field with their simplicity when the ether\r\nalone is involved; thus the idea of a charge of electricity, which is\r\nprobably in many classes of phenomena the most prominent idea of all,\r\nneed not arise, and in fact does not arise, so long as we deal with\r\nthe ether alone. The questions that occur when we consider the\r\nrelation between matter and the electrical charge carried by it--such\r\nas the state of the matter when carrying the charge, and the effect\r\nproduced on this state when the sign of the charge is changed--are\r\nregarded as among the most important in the whole range of physics.\r\nThe close connection that exists between chemical and electrical\r\nphenomena indicates that a knowledge of the relation between matter\r\nand electricity would lead to an increase of our knowledge of\r\nelectricity, and further of that of chemical action, and, indeed, to\r\nan extension of the domain of electricity over that of chemistry. For\r\nthe study of this relation the most promising course is to begin with\r\nthat between electricity and matter in the gaseous or simpler state;\r\nand that is what is undertaken in this book. The subject is presented\r\nunder the three general headings with numerous subheadings of The\r\nDischarge of Electricity through Gases, Photo Electric Effects, and\r\nCathode Rays.\r\n\r\nFor a clear and concise presentation of the framework of psychology\r\nand its basal truths, the _Story of the Mind_[43] may be commended.\r\nAlthough the space afforded is only that of a bird's-eye view, no\r\nskeleton bristling with technical terms confronts us, but an\r\nattractive and well-furnished structure with glimpses of various\r\ndivisions that tempt us to further examination. The text is simply and\r\ncharmingly written, and may induce many to search the recesses of\r\npsychology who, under a less skillful guide, would be frightened away.\r\nA bibliography at the end of the volume supplies what other direction\r\nmay be needed for more advanced study. Admirable in construction and\r\ntreatment as the book is, there are, however, paths in which we can\r\nnot follow where Professor Baldwin would lead, and in others that we\r\nundertake with him we do not recognize our surroundings as those he\r\ndescribes. This is especially the case with the environment of the\r\ngenius. We do not find that \"he and society agree in regard to the\r\nfitness of his thoughts,\" nor that \"for the most part his judgment is\r\n_at once_ also the social judgment.\" If such were the case, how would\r\nhe \"wait for recognition,\" or be \"muzzled\" for expressing his\r\nthoughts? In almost all cases it is the story of Galileo over again.\r\nIn art, science, and social reform he sees far beyond his fellows.\r\nSociety can not accept him because it has not the vision of a genius.\r\nHe contradicts its judgment and is fortunate when he escapes with the\r\nname of \"crank.\" The military hero does not enter into this category:\r\nhe glorifies the past rather than the future; he justifies the\r\nmultitude in a good opinion of itself and, is therefore always\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Professor _Bolton's Catalogue of Scientific and\r\nTechnical Periodicals_[44] was issued in 1885, and was intended to\r\nembrace the principal independent periodicals of every branch of pure\r\nand applied science, published in all countries from the rise of this\r\nliterature to the present time, with full titles, names of editors,\r\nsequence of series, and other bibliographical details, arranged on a\r\nsimple plan convenient for reference; omitting, with a few exceptions,\r\nserials constituting transactions of learned societies. In cases where\r\nthe scientific character of the journal or its right to be classed as\r\na periodical was doubtful, and in other debatable cases, the compiler\r\nfollowed Zuchold's maxim, that \"in a bibliography it is much better\r\nthat a book should be found which is not sought, than that one should\r\nbe sought for and not found.\" The new edition contains as Part I a\r\nreprint from the plates of the first edition, with such changes\r\nnecessary to bring the titles down to date as could be made without\r\noverrunning the plates; and in Part II additions to the titles of Part\r\nI that could not be inserted in the plates, together with about 3,600\r\nnew titles, bringing the whole number of titles up to 8,477, together\r\nwith addenda, raising this number to 8,603, minus the numbers 4,955 to\r\n5,000, which are skipped between the first and second parts.\r\nChronological tables give the dates of the publication of each volume\r\nof the periodicals entered. A library check list shows in what\r\nAmerican libraries the periodicals may be found. Cross-references are\r\nfreely introduced. The material for the work has been gathered from\r\nall available bibliographies, and by personal examination of the\r\nshelves and catalogues of many libraries in the United States and\r\nEurope, and from responses to circulars sent out by the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. The whole work is a monument of prodigious labor\r\nindustriously and faithfully performed.\r\n\r\nIn _Theories of the Will in the History of Philosophy_[45] a concise\r\naccount is given by _Archibald Alexander_ of the development of the\r\ntheory of the will from the early days of Greek thought down to about\r\nthe middle of the present century; including, however, only the\r\ntheories of the more important philosophers. In addition to\r\ncontributing something to the history of philosophy, it has been the\r\nauthor's purpose to introduce in this way a constructive explanation\r\nof voluntary action. The account closes with the theory of Lotze;\r\nsince the publication of which the methods of psychology have been\r\ngreatly modified, if not revolutionized, by the development of the\r\nevolutional and physiological systems of study. The particular\r\nsubjects considered are the theories of the will in the Socratic\r\nperiod, the Stoic and Epicurean theories; the theories in Christian\r\ntheology, in British philosophy from Bacon to Reid, Continental\r\ntheories from Descartes to Leibnitz, and theories in German philosophy\r\nfrom Kant to Lotze. The author has tried to avoid obtruding his own\r\nopinions, expressing an individual judgment only on matters of\r\ndoubtful interpretation; and he recognizes that speculation and the\r\nintrospective method of studying the will appear to have almost\r\nreached their limits.\r\n\r\nDr. _Frank Overton's_ text-book of _Applied Physiology_[46] makes a\r\nnew departure from the old methods of teaching physiology, in that it\r\nbegins with the cells as the units of life and shows their relations\r\nto all the elements of the body and all the processes of human action.\r\nThe fact of their fundamental nature and importance is emphasized\r\nthroughout. The relation of oxidation--oxidation within the cells--as\r\nthe essential act of respiration--to the disappearance of food, the\r\nproduction of waste matters, and the development of force, is dwelt\r\nupon. The influence of alcohol is discussed in all its aspects, not in\r\na separate chapter, but whenever it comes in place in connection with\r\nthe several topics and subjects treated. Other narcotics are dealt\r\nwith. A chapter on inflammation and taking cold is believed to be an\r\nentirely new feature in a school text book. Summaries and review\r\ntopics are arranged at the end of each chapter; subjects from original\r\ndemonstrations and the use of the microscope are listed; and many\r\nhygienic topics, such as air, ventilation, drinking water, clothing,\r\nbathing, bacteria, etc., are specially treated.\r\n\r\nThe prominent characteristic of Professors _F.P. Venable_ and _J.L.\r\nHowe's_ text-book on _Inorganic Chemistry according to the Periodic\r\nLaw_[47] is expressed in the title, and is the adoption of the\r\nperiodic law as the guiding principle of the treatment, and the\r\nkeeping of it in the foreground throughout. So far as the authors have\r\nnoticed, the complete introduction of this system has not been\r\nattempted before in any text book. They have made the experiment of\r\nfollowing it closely in their classes, and their success through\r\nseveral years has convinced them of its value. \"In no other way have\r\nwe been able to secure such thorough results, both as to thorough,\r\nsystematic instruction and economy of time. The task is rendered\r\neasier for both student and teacher.\" After the setting forth of\r\ndefinitions and general principles in the introduction, the elements\r\nare taken up and described according to their places and relations in\r\nthe periodic groups, and then their compounds are described\r\nsuccessively, with hydrogen, the halogens, oxygen, sulphur, and the\r\nnitrides, phosphides, carbides, silicides, and the alloys. The\r\ntreatment is systematic, condensed, and clear.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Mr. _John W. Troeger's_ series of Nature-Study Readers\r\nis declared by the editor to be to supply supplementary reading for\r\npupils who have been two years or more at school. They are composed,\r\nmoreover, with a view to facilitating the recognition in the printed\r\nform of words already familiar to the ear, and to making the child at\r\nhome with them. In carrying out this purpose the author takes\r\nadvantage of the child's fondness for making observations, especially\r\nwhen attended by his companions or elders. In doing this the aim has\r\nbeen kept in view not to weary the child with details, and yet to give\r\nsufficient information to lead to accurate and complete observations.\r\nMost of the chapters in the present volume, _Harold's Rambles_, the\r\nsecond of the series, contain the information gleaned during walks and\r\nshort excursions. Among the subjects concerned are birds, mammals,\r\ninsects, earthworms, snails, astronomy, minerals, plants, grasses,\r\nvegetables, physics, and features connected with the farm. These\r\nNature-study readers are published as a branch of Appletons'\r\nHome-Reading series. (New York: D. Appleton and Company. Price, 40\r\ncents.)\r\n\r\nAnother of Appletons' Home-Reading Books is _News from the Birds_,\r\nwhich the author, _Leander S. Keyser_, explains has been written with\r\ntwo purposes in mind: first, to furnish actual instruction, to tell\r\nsome new facts about bird life that have not yet been recited; and,\r\nsecond, to inspire in readers a taste for Nature study. It is by no\r\nmeans a key for the identification of the birds; but, instead of\r\ntelling all that is or may be known respecting a particular bird, the\r\nauthor has sought only to recite such incidents as will spur the\r\nreader to go out into the fields and woods and study the birds in\r\ntheir native haunts. For the most part the author has given a record\r\nof his own observations, and not a reiteration of what others have\r\nsaid. He has gone to the birds themselves for his facts, and has made\r\nvery little use of books.\r\n\r\nIt has been Mr. _Ernest A. Congdon's_ aim, in preparing his _Brief\r\nCourse in Qualitative Analysis_ (New York: Henry Holt; 60 cents), to\r\nrender it as concise as possible while making the least sacrifice of a\r\nstudy of reactions and solubilities of chemical importance. The manual\r\ncovers the points of preliminary reactions on bases and acids; schemes\r\nof analysis for bases and acids; explanatory notes on the analyses;\r\ntreatment of solid substances (powders, alloys, or metals); and\r\ntables of solubilities of salts of the bases studied. A comprehensive\r\nlist of questions, stimulative of thought, is appended. The book is\r\nintended merely as a laboratory guide, and should be supplemented by\r\nfrequent \"quiz classes\" and by constant personal attention. The course\r\nhas been satisfactorily given in the Drexel Institute within the\r\nallotted time of one laboratory period of four hours, and one hour for\r\na lecture or quiz per week, during the school year of thirty-two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n_Lest we Forget_ is the title which President _David Starr Jordan_ has\r\ngiven to his address before the graduating class of Leland Stanford\r\nJunior University, May 25, 1898--\"lest we forget\" the dangers and\r\nduties and responsibilities laid upon us by the war with Spain. Though\r\ndelivered before the \"policy of expansion\" was fully developed, the\r\naddress describes with prophetic accuracy the dream of imperialism\r\nwith which the minds even of men usually sane and honest have become\r\ninfected, and points out a few of the logical results to which they\r\nwould lead, and the dangers which will have to be incurred in\r\ngratifying them. We cite a few of the strong points made by the\r\nauthor: \"Our question is not what we shall do with Cuba, Porto Rico,\r\nand the Philippines; it is what these prizes will do to us.\" \"Shall\r\nthe war for Cuba Libre come to an inglorious end? If we make anything\r\nby it, it will be most inglorious.\" \"I believe that the movement\r\ntoward broad dominion, so eloquently outlined by Mr. Olney, would be a\r\nstep downward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\nAdams, Enos, 2072 Second Avenue, New York.

In 1837, Wheatstone and Cooke\r\nwere experimenting with land telegraphy, and were considering the\r\npossibility of laying an insulated wire under water. Morse's\r\nsuccessful experiments date from 1842, when he personally laid a cable\r\nbetween Castle Garden and Governor's Island and sent messages over it;\r\nthe next morning it was broken. With the introduction of gutta percha\r\nas an insulator in 1847, submarine telegraphy became practicable. The\r\nCentral Oceanic Telegraph Company had been registered by Jacob Brett\r\nin 1845, and a cable was laid under the English Channel by Brett and\r\nhis brother in 1850. Messages were sent through it, but, like Morse's\r\nearlier effort, it immediately became silent. Better success attended\r\nthe cable of the next year, which was sheathed with iron; and the\r\nfirst public submarine message was sent over it November 13, 1851.\r\nMorse wrote of the possibility of establishing electro-magnetic\r\ncommunication across the ocean as early as 1844. A syndicate was\r\nformed for this purpose in 1855, Cyrus W. Field being the most\r\nconspicuous figure in it. An understanding was reached with the Brett\r\ncompany, and the Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed. The first\r\neffort to lay the cable was made in 1857 by the United States frigate\r\nNiagara and H.M.S. Agamemnon, but the wires broke in deep water when\r\nabout a third of the work was done. A cable was successfully laid the\r\nnext year, but it died out in a month. Finally, electric communication\r\nwas permanently established across the Atlantic by the Telegraph\r\nConstruction and Maintenance Company, which, capturing a cable that\r\nhad been lost, soon had two. Transatlantic cables have now become so\r\nnumerous and so regular in their working that the danger of even a\r\ntemporary failure has become very remote.\r\n\r\n=The White Lady Mountain.=--Iztaccihuatl (pronounced Is-tak-see-watl)\r\nis about ten miles, measuring to its principal peak, north of\r\nPopocatepetl. In shape it consists of a long, narrow ridge cut into\r\nthree well-defined peaks about equally distant from one another, of\r\nwhich the central is the highest; and the snow-covered peak resembles\r\nthe figure of a woman lying on her back; whence the name of the\r\nmountain, which means _white woman_. According to the Aztecs, Dr.\r\nO.C. Farrington, of the Field Columbian Museum, tells us, this woman\r\nwas a goddess who for some crime had been struck dead and doomed to\r\nlie forever on this spot. Popocatepetl was her lover, and had stood by\r\nher. Tastes differ as to whether it or Popocatepetl presents a more\r\nstriking view, but either is a beautiful enough object to look upon.\r\nThe first authenticated record of an ascent to the summit of the\r\nmountain is that of Mr. H. Reniere Whitehouse, who reached the top\r\nNovember 9, 1889, and found there undoubted evidence that an ascent\r\nhad been made five days previously by Mr. James de Salis. Prof. Angelo\r\nHeilprin and Mr. F. C. Baker attempted an ascent in the following\r\nApril, but were turned back when about seventy-five yards below the\r\nsummit, at a height of 16,730 feet, by two impassable crevasses. \"The\r\nascent of Iztaccihuatl seems, therefore, pretty generally to have\r\nfoiled those who have attempted it. Dr. Farrington, who ascended to\r\nthe Porfirio Diaz Glacier in February, 1896, describes the route as\r\nsteeper than that which leads up to Popocatepetl.\" The brilliant and\r\nvaried flora, picturesque barrenness, and beautiful cascades lend\r\neverywhere a charm to the scene which contrasts favorably with the\r\nsomber monotony which characterizes the route by which Popocatepetl is\r\nascended. The slopes of the mountain are cultivated to a considerable\r\nheight--10,860 feet. The lower slopes are largely covered with soil,\r\nand the andesite rock, of gray and red colors, differs completely in\r\ncharacter from that of Popocatepetl. The aiguillelike character of\r\nmany of the spurs extending at right angles to the course of the\r\nmountain is a prominent feature. Many caves in the rock furnish\r\nshelter to cattle and persons attempting the ascent. Dr. Farrington\r\nexamined the Porfirio Diaz Glacier, and concluded that it formerly had\r\na much greater extent than now.\r\n\r\n=The Adulteration of Butter with Glucose.=--The following is from an\r\narticle by C.A. Crampton in the Journal of the American Chemical\r\nSociety: In domestic practice the addition of sugar to butter for\r\npurposes of preservation is doubtless almost as old as the art of\r\nbutter-making itself; salt, however, is the usually preferred\r\npreservative. Sugar appears in several of the various United States\r\npatents for so-called \"improving\" or renovating processes for butter,\r\nbeing added to it along with salt, saltpeter, and in some cases sodium\r\ncarbonate. Within the past few years glucose has been used in butter\r\nspecially prepared for export to tropical countries, as the West\r\nIndies or South America. It is usually put up in tins, and various\r\nmeans are resorted to for preventing the decomposition of their goods\r\nbefore they reach the consumer. Very large quantities of salt are used\r\nby the French exporters, as the following two analyses show:\r\n\r\n           Butter for Export.\r\n\r\n        To Brazil.  To Antilles.\r\n\r\n  Water   10.29       10.19\r\n  Curd     1.24        1.31\r\n  Ash     10.29       10.06\r\n  Fat     78.18       78.44\r\n         ------      ------\r\n         100.00      100.00\r\n\r\nChemical antiseptics, borax, salicylic acid, etc., are sometimes used,\r\nbut the method found most efficacious by exporters in this country\r\nseems to be the use of glucose in conjunction with moderately heavy\r\nsalting. The glucose used is a heavy, low-converted sirup, known as\r\nconfectioners' glucose. The detection of glucose in butter presents no\r\ndifficulty. The butter is thoroughly washed with hot water, which will\r\nreadily take up whatever glucose is present. This solution is then\r\ntested by means of Fehling's solution. The following is an analysis of\r\nthe so-called _beurre rouge_, or red butter, which is exported to\r\nGuadeloupe. It is a peculiar highly colored compound, containing large\r\nquantities of salt and glucose:\r\n\r\n  Water    21.60\r\n  Curd      0.81\r\n  Ash      16.42\r\n  Fat      51.15\r\n  Glucose  10.02\r\n          ------\r\n          100.00\r\n\r\n=Decorated Skulls and the Power ascribed to them.=--A collection of\r\nsixteen skulls--eight of men, seven of women, and one of a child--from\r\nNew Guinea, is described by George A. Dorsey in the publications of\r\nthe Field Columbian Museum, Chicago. They were received from a native\r\nchief, who used them for the adornment of his house, and is said to\r\nhave prized them as trophies of war. They are decorated in the frontal\r\nregion by engraved designs, and the parts are attached to one another\r\nby very skillfully adjusted cords. The ornamentation and the bindings\r\nare the subject of a special comment by William H. Holmes. Importance\r\nis attached by natives of New Guinea to the preservation of the skulls\r\nof friends as mementoes and of foes as trophies, and of both\r\ncategories on account of the virtue--the best qualities of the\r\nindividuals whose skulls they are--which they are supposed to impart\r\nin some mysterious way to their possessor. Hence special care is taken\r\nto have them preserved in detail, and that no part be lost. In the\r\npresent specimens the jaws were secured by fastenings at right and\r\nleft and in front. The teeth were carefully tied in, and when lost\r\nwere replaced by artificial teeth. A cord was fastened around the back\r\nmolar on one side, and carried along, inclosing each tooth in turn, in\r\na loop, so as to make a very effective fastening when the cord was\r\ntightly drawn and attached to the back molar on the other side. The\r\nlower jaw was very firmly fastened to the skull by closely wrapped\r\ncords tightened by binding the strands around the middle portion. In\r\nsome cases these fastenings are very elaborate and neat; in others,\r\nimperfect and slovenly. All the skulls in the collection are decorated\r\nwith designs engraved on the frontal bone, and in some cases the\r\nfigures run back. The execution of the work is not of a very high\r\norder, but is rather irregular and scratchy. Nearly all embody easily\r\ndistinguished animal forms, and the more formal or nearly geometric\r\nones are probably animal derivatives or representations of land,\r\nwater, or natural phenomena. They are possibly totemic or\r\nmythological.\r\n\r\n=Galax and its Affinities.=--One of the most interesting plants of the\r\nSouthern mountain region is the galax (_Galax aphylla_), which grows\r\nin the highlands more or less abundantly from Virginia southward. The\r\nslopes of Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina, are carpeted with it\r\nfor many square miles of almost uninterrupted extent. Besides being an\r\nattractive plant at home, its thick, leathery, rounded cordate leaves,\r\ndeep green or crimson or mixed, according to the season, make it much\r\nin demand for decoration, and tons of it in the aggregate are shipped,\r\nfrom places where it grows abundantly, for that purpose. Its\r\naffiliations with certain other Alpine and arctic plants are described\r\nin a carefully studied paper on the Order Diapensisceæ, published by\r\nMargaret Farsman Boynton in the Journal of the National Science Club,\r\nWashington. Linnæus found in Lapland a creeping evergreen herb,\r\nmatting the surface with its stiff, spatulate leaves, and described it\r\nin 1737 as _Diapensia lapponica_. Then galax was discovered by\r\nGronovius and given a place by Linnæus--because of its stamens rather\r\nthan of its natural affinities--along with Diapensia. Michaux, in the\r\nlast decade of the eighteenth century, found _Pyxidanthera barbulata_,\r\nresembling diapensia, in the pine barrens of New Jersey and North\r\nCarolina. More recently other species of diapensia and _Berneuxia_\r\nhave been found among the Himalayas, and _Schizocodon_ of several\r\nspecies in Japan. One of the most remarkable discoveries in the list\r\nwas that by Michaux in the mountains of North Carolina of a plant\r\nwhich was afterward called _Shortia galacifolia_, from the resemblance\r\nof its leaves to those of galax. This plant in a living state was then\r\nlost, and when Gray and Torrey looked for it in 1831 in vain, only one\r\npreserved specimen of it was known to be extant and that in fruit; and\r\nit was not till 1877 that it was collected, rediscovered, in fact, in\r\nflower, as Gray has said, \"by an herbalist almost absolutely ignorant\r\nof botany, who was only informed of his good fortune on sending to a\r\nbotanist one of the two specimens collected by him.\" The Shortia, so\r\nfar as is known, grows only in a very narrow district, and those who\r\nknow the place are careful not to direct the public to it. Specimens\r\nhave been collected by a few nurserymen, who cultivate it and have it\r\nfor sale. The plants of this list are variously classified as among\r\none another by botanists, but are regarded as belonging to a common\r\ngroup. \"The real story of their development,\" says the author of the\r\npaper, \"can be gathered only in hints from their present distribution,\r\nfor unfortunately they have neither gallery of ancestral portraits nor\r\nrecorded geological tree.\" But their ancestors are supposed to have\r\nbeen pushed down by the glaciers and left where the modern forms are\r\nfound. Almost anywhere in the boreal flora _Diapensia lapponica_ may\r\nbe found, whether in northern Asia, or Europe, or America, or even on\r\nthe mountains of Labrador and in the Pyrenees, the Scotch mountains,\r\nand our own White Mountains.\r\n\r\n=The Academy della Crusca.=--\"For three hundred years,\" says a\r\ncorrespondent of the London Athenæum, \"the learned body, the Academy\r\nof la Crusca (the bran), Florence, has been scrupulously sifting the\r\nItalian tongue and producing successive editions of its monumental\r\ndictionary. Its present seat is in the monastery of St.\r\nMark--Savonarola's cloister--where it occupies the hall behind the\r\ngreat library. When an associate is promoted to full membership, his\r\nofficial reception is still accompanied by the traditional rite.\r\nFirst, he is solemnly conducted to the Cruscan museum, and left to\r\nsolitary meditation among shovel-backed chairs surmounted by the\r\nsymbolical sieve and bookcases ingeniously fashioned in the likeness\r\nof corn sacks. The walls are covered with the names, crests, and\r\nmottoes of former members, who in past times usually assumed fantastic\r\ntitles descriptive of the academy's labors.\" Some of these printed\r\ninscriptions and comical devices are more or less quaint. Thus, Dr.\r\nGiulio Maxi in 1590 took the name of _Il Fiorito_, or the flowery one,\r\nwith the device of a basket of wheat in bloom and the motto from\r\nPetrarch (translation):\r\n\r\n      \"I enjoy the present and hope for better.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1641 the Senator Vieri appeared as _Le Svanito_, the evaporated,\r\nwith an uncorked wine flask, the stopper beside it, and the motto:\r\n\r\n      \"Oh, how I long for the medicine!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1660 the Marquis Malaskini adopted the title of _Il Preservato_,\r\nthe preserved, the device of olives packed in straw, and the motto\r\nfrom Petrarch:\r\n\r\n      \"Keep the prize green.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1764, the Abbot Giuseppe Pelli, surnamed _Il Megliorato_, the\r\nimproved, took the device of a newly invented sieve for the better\r\nsifting of grain, with the Petrarchian motto:\r\n\r\n      \"Follow the few, and not the throng.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1770, Signor Domenico Manni assumed the title of _Il Sofferente_,\r\nthe sufferer, with a straw chair as his device, and a motto from\r\nDante:\r\n\r\n      \"The master said that lying in a feather bed\r\n      One would not come to fame--nor under the plowshare.\"\r\n\r\nIn due time the new member is escorted to the hall where the academy\r\nis assembled, and the chief consul, head of the academy, greets him\r\nwith a speech, to which he has to make a fitting reply. Historical\r\nItalian families are numerously represented on the academy's rolls,\r\nand among the foreign members are the names of William Roscoe and Mr.\r\nGladstone.\r\n\r\n=Aboriginal Superstitions about Bones.=--A very interesting\r\narchaeological site in Mexico, visited by Carl Lumholtz and Aleš\r\nHedlička in the fall of 1896, is near Zacápu, in the State of\r\nMichoacan. The region is marked by many stone mounds on or near the\r\nedge of the old flow of lava, extending for several miles; and\r\ndirectly above the village stands a large stone fortress, called El\r\nPalacio. Excavating near this fortress, Mr. Lumholtz unearthed several\r\nskeletons, which had been buried without any order, and accompanied by\r\n\"remarkably few objects,\" but some of these were well worthy of study.\r\nThe most curious things found were some bones, strangely marked with\r\ngrooves across them, exhibiting a little variety in arrangement, but\r\nall similarly executed, and evidently after a carefully devised\r\nsystem. This feature is so far unique in archæology, and its purpose\r\ncan as yet be only a matter of conjecture. Two ways are proposed by\r\nthe author of explaining it. The marking may have been an operation\r\nundertaken for the purpose of dispatching the dead. Mr. Lumholtz is\r\nknowing to a belief among the tribes of Mexico that the dead are\r\ntroublesome to the survivors for at least one year, and certain\r\nceremonies and feasts in regard to them have to be observed in order\r\nto prevent them from doing harm, and to drive them away. The\r\nTarahumares guard their beer against them, and others provide a\r\nspecial altar with food for the dead on it at their rain-making\r\nfeasts, else the spirits would work some mischief. Among many tribes\r\nan offering is made to the dead, before drinking brandy, of a few\r\ndrops of the liquor. A relation is also supposed to exist between\r\ndisease and pain and the bones of the deceased person. A whole class\r\nof diseases are supposed to have their seat in the bones or the marrow\r\nof them. If the disease does not yield to the shaman's efforts, and\r\ncauses death, the Indians think that the pain will continue after\r\ndeath and vex the ghost, making him malignant and troublesome.\r\nTherefore the pain must be conquered, and driven away from the bones\r\nand the marrow. Hence the markings may have been made in order to\r\nsever all connection between the spirit and his former life, and from\r\nthe disease that caused his death. The other explanation is that the\r\nbones were taken from slain enemies for other purposes than as mere\r\ntrophies. Personal or bodily relics are supposed to possess some of\r\nthe qualities of the deceased, and to give power. This view is\r\nsupported by some observations of Mr. Cushing relative to Zuñi\r\ncustoms; and the author is inclined to favor it rather than the other.\r\n\r\n=Estrays from Civilization.=--A curious study of a community of\r\nestrays from civilization who are leading the life of savages is\r\npublished by M. Zaborowski in the _Revue de l'École d'Anthropologie_\r\nand _La Nature_. The settlement is about a mile from Ezy, on the\r\neastern edge of the plateau of Normandy, in a group of caves that were\r\nexcavated and used as wine cellars when, several hundred years ago,\r\nwine culture flourished in the now uncongenial region. Later the spot\r\nwas a resort for picnics till the old buildings fell into decay, and\r\nabout fifty years ago it was given up to wanderers. About eighty men,\r\nwomen, and children live there, the adults, though not perhaps really\r\ncriminals, having been lost to society on account of some offense\r\ncommitted against it. They have no regular means of subsistence, are\r\nbeneath the tramps in grade, and possess, with one or two exceptions,\r\nno articles of property other than what they pick up. Their beds are\r\nwooden bunks set upon stones, filled with leaves, and the coverings\r\nare wrapping canvas. A \"family\" of seven persons lived in one of the\r\ncellars with only a single bed of this kind. Their kitchen utensils\r\nare old tin cans picked out of rubbish heaps, and their stoves are\r\nobtained in the same way, or often consist of plates and pieces of\r\niron adjusted so as to make a sort of fireplace. They have a well from\r\nwhich they draw water with some old kettle suspended on a hooked\r\nstick, each \"family\" having its own hook. Their clothes are rags,\r\npartly covering portions of the body, and it is not considered\r\nnecessary that the younger ones should have even these. Their\r\nhousekeeping and their ideas of neatness are such as might correspond\r\nwith these conditions. One woman, mother of four children, and the\r\nonly one that was adequately dressed, was a native of a neighboring\r\nvillage, and had been brought to the cave by her mother when she was\r\neight years old. An old man had been a charge upon the town and was\r\nsent to the cave by the _maire_ to get rid of him. He had found a\r\nwoman there and had several children. A woman, still active, who had\r\nlived in the caves three years, had children living in Ezy. The\r\ncomplaint, so common in other parts of France, that the natural\r\nincrease of population has failed, does not apply to the caves. Five\r\nor six of the \"families\" have four or five children. On these\r\nchildren, of whom only the most vigorous survive, \"the influence of\r\ntheir debasing misery and of the vices of their parents impresses a\r\ncommon aspect. Their mental condition has fallen shockingly low, and,\r\ntheir physical needs satisfied, they seem to want nothing further. No\r\nattraction will induce them to attend school, which is like\r\nimprisonment to them. Their mode of life and the marks of degradation\r\nin their faces separate them from others. Earnest attempts to develop\r\ntheir intelligence and moral consciousness have been without result.\"\r\n\r\n=German School Journeys.=--It is very common in Germany, says Miss\r\nDodd, of Owens College, in one of the English educational reports, to\r\nfind definite teaching taking place outside the school walls--in the\r\ngardens attached to the schools, and in the neighboring forests, where\r\nthe children are instructed in observation of the local forms of plant\r\nand animal life. Further, they are often taken on longer expeditions\r\nto spend the whole day in the forest or on the mountain with their\r\nteachers, who direct them \"what to see, and how to see it.\" More\r\ndefinite and more ambitious than these minor excursions is the school\r\njourney, which may last from three days to three weeks. It is usually\r\ntaken on foot, and is as inexpensive as possible, with plain food and\r\nsimple accommodation. Each boy carries his own knapsack charged with a\r\nchange of underclothing, towels, soap, etc., and overcoat or umbrella;\r\nwhile for the common use of the party are distributed clothes brushes\r\nand shoe brushes, needles, thread, string, and pins, ointment for\r\nrubbing on the feet, a small medicine chest, a compass, a field glass,\r\na pocket microscope, a barometer, and a tape measure. The district\r\nvisited is chosen on account of its historical associations or the\r\ngeographical illustrations it furnishes, or the richness and variety\r\nof plant life to be studied. Constant pauses are made to afford\r\nopportunities for the examination of features inviting study; and the\r\nscenes visited are often closely connected with the subjects included\r\nin the year's work of the school. In a journey, of which Miss Dodd was\r\na member, preparations were begun three months beforehand, with the\r\ncollection of subscriptions, drawing of road maps, and special\r\nlessons. The fifty boys from ten to fifteen years old, marched off in\r\ngroups of four, assorting themselves according to their affinities for\r\ncompanionship, with advance and rear guards; the regions passed\r\nthrough were explored for what might be found in them; the roads were\r\nmarked and identified, mountains and rivers were named, and the\r\ncourses of streams determined; and at each place of considerable\r\ninterest its characteristic features and associations of Nature, art,\r\nand history were discussed and studied.\r\n\r\n=The Huichol Indians of Jalisco.=--The Huichol Indians of Mexico, the\r\nsubject of a study by Carl Lumholtz, four thousand people living in\r\nthe mountains of northern Jalisco, have a tradition that they\r\noriginated in the south, got lost underneath the earth, and came\r\nforward again in the east, in the country of the _Kikuli_, near San\r\nLuis Potosi. Franciscan missionaries converted them nominally to\r\nChristianity, but there are now no priests in their country, and there\r\nis probably no tribe in Mexico where the ancient beliefs have been so\r\nwell maintained as with them. Their exterior conditions have been\r\nsomewhat altered by the introduction of cattle and sheep, and cattle\r\nare now the favorite animals for sacrifice at the feasts for making\r\nrain during the dry season. The people are healthy, very emotional,\r\neasily moved to laughter or tears, imaginative and excitable. Young\r\npeople show affection in public, kissing or caressing one another.\r\nThey are kind-hearted and not inhospitable to those who can gain their\r\nconfidence, but have the reputation of being wanting in regard for\r\ntruth. They live mostly in circular houses made from loose stones, or\r\nstones and mud, and covered with thatched roofs. Their temples,\r\ndevoted to various gods, are of similar shape, but much larger, with\r\nthe entrances toward sunrise. Outside of the door is an open space\r\nsurrounded by small rectangular god-houses, with gabled and thatched\r\nroofs. The god-houses are also frequently found in the forests, and\r\nare sometimes circular. There are nineteen temples in the country\r\nwhich are frequented at the times of the feasts, when the officials\r\nand their families camp in the small god-houses. Idols are not kept in\r\nthe temples, but are hidden in caves or in special buildings. There\r\nare a great many sacred caves devoted to various gods, and generally\r\ncontaining some pool or spring that gives them sanctity, and the water\r\nof which is supposed to have salutary virtues. Much religious\r\nimportance is attached to the _Kikuli_ cactus, which produces an\r\nexhilarating effect on the system. Ceremonial arrows are inseparably\r\nconnected with their life, the arrow representing the Indian himself\r\nin his prayers to the gods. They have other interesting ceremonies and\r\nceremonial objects, and a curious system of distilling, which Mr.\r\nLumholtz describes at length.\r\n\r\n=Herrings at Dinner.=--The food of the herring consists of small\r\norganisms, often of microscopic dimensions. It is entirely animal, and\r\nin Europe, according to those who have investigated the matter, it\r\nconsists of copepods, schizopods (shrimplike forms), amphipods (sand\r\nfleas and their allies), the embryos of gasteropods and\r\nlamellibranchia, and young fishes, often of its own kind. In the\r\nexamination of about fifteen hundred specimens of herring at Eastport,\r\nMaine, and vicinity, in the summer and fall of 1893, Mr. H.F. Moore,\r\nof the Fish Commission, found only two kinds of food--copepods or \"red\r\nseed,\" which appeared to constitute the sole food of the small\r\nherrings, and shrimps the principal food of the larger ones. In many\r\ncases the stomachs of the fish were densely gorged with these shrimps,\r\nwhich are extremely abundant in the waters of the vicinity. Excepting\r\nthe eyes and phosphorescent spots beneath, which are bright red, the\r\nbodies of the crustaceans are almost transparent, yet such is the\r\ndensity of the schools in which they congregate that a distinctly\r\nreddish tinge is often imparted to the water. They are very active,\r\nand frequently avoid the rush of the fish by vigorous strokes of their\r\npowerful caudal paddles, which throw them several inches above the\r\nsurface. To capture them requires some address on the part of the\r\nherring, and the fish likewise frequently throw themselves almost\r\nclear of the surface. When feeding upon copepods the movements of the\r\nherrings are less impetuous. They swim open-mouthed, often with their\r\nsnouts at the surface, crossing and recrossing on their tracks, and\r\nevidently straining out the minute crustaceans by means of their\r\nbranchial sieves. After they have passed the stage known as \"brit,\"\r\nthe herrings appear to feed principally at night, or if they do so to\r\nany considerable extent during bright daylight it is at such a depth\r\nthat they escape observation. At night it is often possible to note\r\nthe movements of the fish at a depth of several fathoms, and at such\r\ntimes Mr. Moore has seen them swimming back and forth, \"apparently\r\nscreening the water, their every movement traced by a phosphorescent\r\ngleam, evoked perhaps from the very organisms which they were\r\nconsuming.\" The herrings evidently follow their prey by night, and the\r\nfact that the shrimps possess phosphorescent spots may explain the\r\napparent ability of the fish to catch them then.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nThe phosphorescence, which is so beautiful a characteristic of certain\r\nforms of animal life in the sea, has been the cause of much\r\nspeculation among the fishermen and scientists; none of the proposed\r\ntheories have been entirely satisfactory. It is now stated, however,\r\nthat an adequate and provable cause has been discovered in a so-called\r\nspecies of photo-bacteria; by means of this germ it is stated that sea\r\nwater, containing nutrient media, can be inoculated and rendered\r\nphosphorescent; that newly caught herrings with the sea water still\r\nfresh can be rendered phosphorescent by a treatment which favors the\r\ngrowth of the photo-bacteria. Oxygen is an essential to their growth.\r\n\r\nPersonal equation was defined by Prof. T.H. Safford, in a paper read\r\nat the American Association, as in reality the time it takes to think;\r\nand as that time is different in different persons, observations are\r\nliable to be affected by it unless correct allowance is made for it in\r\nthe case of each one. It has been a subject of discussion since the\r\nend of the last century. The Astronomer Royal of England discharged a\r\ngood assistant in 1795, because he was liable to observe stars more\r\nthan half a second too late. Bond, several years afterward, took the\r\nsubject up and found that astronomers were liable to vary a little in\r\ntheir observations; some to anticipate the time by a trifle, and\r\nothers falling a little behind. The subject has since been studied by\r\nProfessor Wundt. In the days when the eye-and-ear method of\r\nobservation prevailed, the astronomer had both to watch his object and\r\nto keep note of the time; with the introduction of the chronograph,\r\nthe errors resulting from this necessity are in part obviated. But\r\nerror enough still exists to be troublesome.\r\n\r\nThe Educational Extension Work in Agriculture of Cornell University\r\nExperiment Station is carried on by the publication and distribution\r\nof leaflets, visitation of teachers' institutes, and other means that\r\nmay bring the station in contact with the people. The results of the\r\nwork have been generally satisfactory. Eight leaflets, on such\r\nsubjects as How a Squash Plant gets out of the Seed, A Children's\r\nGarden, etc., were published last year in from two to six editions,\r\nand still meet a lively demand. Thirty thousand teachers were enrolled\r\non the lists as receiving leaflets, or as students of methods of\r\npresenting Nature study to their pupils, sixteen thousand school\r\nchildren were receiving leaflets suitable to them, and twenty-five\r\nhundred young farmers were enrolled in the Agricultural Reading\r\nCourse. Much interest seems to have been shown by farmers in\r\nsugar-beet culture, in investigations of which more than three hundred\r\nof them are cooperating with the station, and two hundred in\r\nexperiments with fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nAn important feature in the evolution of trade journalism is pointed\r\nout in the presidential address of E.C. Brown, of the American Trade\r\nPress Association, in the establishment of small trade journals,\r\ncovering limited fields. Such industries as brickmaking, stenography,\r\nadvertising, acetylene, hospital practice, etc., are ably represented\r\nby their respective trade journals; and this tendency is promoted by\r\nthe complementary one of the trades, in their centralization and\r\nconcentration, compelling even journals in the same business to make\r\ntheir field distinct and restricted. The public demands specific\r\ninformation, not for the purpose of catering to a passing interest,\r\nbut for its application directly in the conduct of business or the\r\nformation of a policy; and those trade journals succeed best which\r\nsupply accurate information of value to their readers.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of Mont Blanc was accomplished between June 21st and\r\nSeptember 16th by one hundred and nineteen persons, eleven of whom\r\nwere women. By nationality the climbers included forty-four Frenchmen\r\nand eleven Frenchwomen, fifteen Englishmen and one Englishwoman, and\r\nfifteen Swiss, with Germans, Americans, Belgians, Hollanders, Irish,\r\nand Russians. A Belgian lady and a Dutch lady were of this company. A\r\nFrenchwoman, seventy-five years old, was one of the party that reached\r\nthe summit on one of the last days in September.\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Brown, whose interesting researches on the enzymes have\r\nattracted much attention during the past few years, has recently\r\nannounced the results of some important experiments on the vitality of\r\nseeds. He found that certain seeds subjected to the very low\r\ntemperature of evaporating liquid air, about -192° C., for one hundred\r\nand ten consecutive hours, retained perfectly their power of\r\ngerminating.\r\n\r\nThe report made by Prof. W.A. Herdman to the British Association\r\nconcerning the liability to disease through oysters recognizes the\r\npossibility of contamination through the proximity of the beds to\r\nsewage water, and recommends steps to be taken, through either\r\nlegislative control or association, to induce the oyster trade to\r\nremove any possible suspicion of contamination of the beds; provision\r\nfor the inspection of foreign oysters or their subjection to a\r\nquarantine by deposition for a stated period in British waters, as\r\nalready takes place in many instances; and the periodical inspection\r\nof the grounds from which mussels, cockles, and periwinkles are\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\nAs the result of long-continued observations of annual temperatures\r\nthe appearance of the earliest leaves, and the return of birds of\r\npassage, M. Camille Flammarion has published the conclusions that the\r\nmaximum temperatures correspond with abundant sun spots and the least\r\nhumidity, and the minimum temperatures with scarcity of sun spots and\r\ngreat humidity; and that sparrows begin to sit when horse-chestnuts,\r\nlilacs, and peonies begin to bloom, and the young are hatched about\r\ntwo days after these plants are in full inflorescence. M. Flammarion\r\nalso believes that the temperatures of March and April indicate those\r\nof the entire year.\r\n\r\nLittle steel capsules containing a small quantity of liquefied\r\ncarbonic acid are made, _La Nature_ says, at Zurich, Switzerland. One\r\nof them is placed in the neck of a bottle of water which is provided\r\nwith a faucet and the capsule is pricked. The carbonic acid escapes\r\nand charges the water, and a bottle of soda water is the result. The\r\ncapsules are cheap and convenient, and are very popular in Switzerland\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to erect a memorial to James Clerk Maxwell in the\r\nparish church of Corsock, of which he was a trustee and elder.\r\nSubscriptions may be sent to the Rev.
