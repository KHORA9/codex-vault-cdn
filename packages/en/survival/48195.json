L. Belding. The able services of Prof. J. L. Kellogg of Williams\r\nCollege were early enlisted, and many valuable results which we are\r\nable to offer are the direct outcome of the practical application of\r\nthe minute details discovered by Professor Kellogg in his careful study\r\nand original investigations of the anatomy and life histories of the\r\nlamellibranch mollusks.\r\n\r\nOf the other workers who, under the direction of Mr. Belding, have\r\ncontributed directly, special mention should be made of Mr. J. R.\r\nStevenson of Williams College, W. G. Vinal of Harvard University, F. C.\r\nLane of Boston University, A. A. Perkins of Ipswich and C. L. Savery of\r\nMarion. Those who have for a briefer time been identified with the work\r\nare R. L. Buffum, W. H. Gates and K. B. Coulter of Williams College,\r\nand Anson Handy of Harvard University.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the results here given, much valuable knowledge has been\r\nacquired, particularly upon the life histories of the scallop and of\r\nthe quahaug, and the practical application of this knowledge to the\r\npursuit of sea farming. It is hoped that the commission will later be\r\nenabled to publish these results.\r\n\r\nThe present report is limited to a statement of the condition of\r\nthe shellfish in each section of our coast, and to consideration of\r\npractical methods for securing increased opportunities for food and\r\nlivelihood by better utilization of naturally productive lands under\r\nwater. Since the chief purpose of legislative action under which this\r\nwork was undertaken was to ascertain how the best economic results\r\ncould be secured, we have thought it wise to embody the results of our\r\ninvestigation in a plan which is suggested as a basis for appropriate\r\nlegislation for making possible a suitable system of shellfish\r\ncultivation similar to that which already exists in Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut and many other coast States, and which has been carried on\r\nfor more than two thousand years on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe following tentative outlines are offered, and it is intended to\r\nsubject each topic to an unprejudiced examination and discussion:--\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPOSED SYSTEM OF CULTURE FOR THE TIDAL FLATS AND WATERS OF\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n_The Purpose._--The proposed system of shellfish culture aims to\r\ndevelop the latent wealth of the tidal waters, to increase the output\r\nof tidal flats already productive, and to make possible the reclamation\r\nof large portions of the waste shore areas of our Commonwealth. It\r\nis further designed to foster dependent and allied industries; to\r\nextend the shellfish market, both wholesale and retail; to multiply\r\nopportunities for the transient visitors and shore cottagers to fish\r\nfor clams and quahaugs for family use, and to ensure fishermen a\r\nreliable source of bait supply; to increase the earnings of the shore\r\nfishermen, and to furnish work to thousands of unemployed; to increase\r\nthe value of shore property; to add to the taxable property of the\r\nshore towns and cities of the State; to secure to all the citizens of\r\nthe State a proper return from an unutilized State asset; to furnish\r\nthe consuming public with a greater quantity of sea food of guaranteed\r\npurity; and in every way, both in the utilization of present and in the\r\ncreation of new resources to build up and develop the fast-declining\r\nshellfish industries of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n_Private v. Public Ownership of Tidal Flats._--The first difficulty\r\nconfronting this proposed system is the too frequently accepted fallacy\r\nthat all lands between the tide marks now are and should be held in\r\ncommon by the inhabitants of the shore communities, to the exclusion\r\nof citizens from other sections of the State,--an assumption which is\r\ndirectly contrary to the more ancient law, supported by decisions of\r\nthe highest courts, that the right of taking shellfish is a public\r\nright, freely open to any inhabitant of the State. Such unwarranted\r\nassumption of exclusive rights in the shellfisheries by individuals,\r\ncorporations or towns sacrifices the rights of the majority. The\r\ndisastrous effect of this policy is plainly demonstrated in the history\r\nof the rise and decline of the shellfisheries of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this fallacious assumption is contrary to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of all economic doctrines. It may be safely affirmed that\r\nthe individual ownership of property has proved not only a success but\r\neven is a necessary condition of progress, and has in fact at length\r\nbecome the foundation of all society. It inevitably follows that if\r\nthe system is justifiable in the case of farm lands it is equally\r\njustifiable in the case of the tidal flats, for the same principle\r\nis involved in each. It is therefore fair to assume that if private\r\nownership of farm land has proved to be for the best interests of\r\nhuman progress, so private ownership of the tidal flats will also be a\r\nbenefit to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to discuss the underlying principle involved\r\nin private ownership of property,--it is simply our purpose to call\r\nattention to two facts: (1) if individual control of real estate is\r\njust, private ownership of tidal flats and waters is likewise just; (2)\r\nthat individual control of such areas is the only practical system yet\r\ndevised capable of checking the alarming decline in the shellfisheries\r\nand of developing them to a normal state of productiveness, and\r\nrendering unnecessary an annually increasing mass of restrictive\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n_The Present System._--The present system of controlling the\r\nshellfisheries is based on the communal ownership of the tidal flats.\r\nOwnership by the Commonwealth has degenerated into a system of town\r\ncontrol, whereby every coast community has entire jurisdiction over its\r\nshellfisheries, to the practical exclusion of citizens of all other\r\ntowns. Thus at the present time the mollusk fisheries of Massachusetts\r\nare divided into a number of separate and disorganized units, which are\r\nincapable of working together for the best interests of the towns or\r\nof the public. This communistic system is distinctly unsound, and is in\r\ndirect opposition to the principles of social and economic development.\r\nThe man who advocates keeping farm lands untilled and in common, for\r\nthe sake of the few wild blackberries they might produce, would be\r\nconsidered mentally unbalanced; but it is precisely this system which\r\nholds sway over our relatively richer sea gardens. With no thought of\r\nseed time, but only of harvest, the fertile tidal flats are yearly\r\ndivested of their fast-decreasing output by reckless and ruthless\r\nexploitation, and valuable territories when once exhausted are allowed\r\nto become barren. All hopes for the morrow are sacrificed to the\r\nclamorous demands of the present. The more the supply decreases, the\r\nmore insistent becomes the demand; and the greater the demand, the more\r\nrelentless grows the campaign of spoliation. The entire shore front\r\nof the Commonwealth is scoured and combed by irresponsible aliens and\r\nby exemplars of the \"submerged tenth\" who are now but despoilers, but\r\nwho if opportunity were present might become cultivators of the flats\r\nrather than devastators. The thoughtful fisherman, who would control\r\nthe industry in a measure, is under present conditions overruled by\r\nhis selfish or short-sighted fellow workers, and is of necessity\r\nforced to join their ranks by the clinching argument that if the\r\nshellfisheries are to be ruined anyway, he might as well have his share\r\nas long as they last. The theory of public ownership of shellfisheries\r\nhas been weighed in the balance and found wanting. The necessity for\r\nsome radical change in the present system is becoming more and more\r\napparent, and a system of private control, with certain modifications,\r\nis the logical result.\r\n\r\n_Need of Reform._--The shellfish supply of Massachusetts is steadily\r\ndeclining. So extensive is this decline that it is unnecessary to\r\nmention the abundant proofs of almost complete exhaustion in certain\r\nlocalities and of failing output in others. While the apparent cause\r\nof this decrease is overfishing and unsystematic digging, the real\r\ncause can be readily traced to the present defective system of town\r\ncontrol, which has made possible, through inefficiency and neglect, the\r\ndeplorable condition of this important industry. Unless the decline is\r\nat once checked, within a very few years our valuable shellfisheries\r\nwill be exhausted to the point of commercial extinction. The\r\nlegislation of former years, essentially restrictive and prohibitory\r\nin character, has unfortunately been constructed on a false economic\r\nbasis. Its aim has been to protect these industries by restricting\r\nthe demand rather than by increasing the supply. What the future\r\nrequires is not merely protective or restrictive legislation, but\r\nrather constructive laws for developing the shellfisheries. The system\r\nof shellfish culture here presented appears to be the only practical\r\nmethod for improving the condition of these industries in such a way as\r\nto protect all vested interests of both private and public rights, and\r\nat the same time to make possible adequate utilization of the natural\r\nproductive capacity.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the proposed system of shellfish culture is based upon a\r\nsystem of leases to individuals. These leases should be divided into\r\ntwo classes: (1) those covering the territory between the tide lines,\r\nand consisting of small areas, from 1 to 2 acres; (2) the territory\r\nbelow low-water mark, comprised of two classes of grants, which differ\r\nonly in size and distance from the shore,--the smaller (_a_), from 1 to\r\n5 acres, to include the shore waters, small bays and inlets, and the\r\nlarger (_b_), of unrestricted size, to be given in the deeper and more\r\nexposed waters. The owners of all grants shall be permitted to plant\r\nand grow all species of shellfish, and shall have exclusive control of\r\nthe fisheries area covered by such lease. The large and more exposed\r\ngrants, which cannot be economically worked without considerable\r\ncapital, should be available for companies; while the smaller holdings,\r\nfor which but small capital is required, are restricted to the use of\r\nthe individual shore fishermen. For the tidal flats and shore waters\r\nbut one-half of the whole territory in any one township shall be\r\nleased, the other half still remaining public property.\r\n\r\n_Success of this System._--The system of private control by leased\r\ngrants is by no means a new and untried theory. In actual operation for\r\nmany years in this and other States, in spite of lack of protection\r\nand other drawbacks which would be eliminated from a perfected system,\r\nit has proved an unqualified success. The rapid depletion and even\r\nextermination of the native oyster beds necessitated legislative\r\nconsideration, and for years the oyster industry above and below\r\nlow-water mark in this and other States has been dealt with by a\r\nsimilar system. The plan here suggested would be but a direct extension\r\nof a well-tested principle towards the cultivation of other species of\r\nmollusks. The financial value to the fishermen of such a step has been\r\nproved beyond all question in this State during the past three years\r\nby the demonstrations of the Massachusetts department of fisheries and\r\ngame. These experiments have proved that tidal flats, with small outlay\r\nof capital and labor, will yield, acre for acre, a far more valuable\r\nharvest than any upland garden.\r\n\r\nThis system has the further element of success by being based on\r\nindividual effort, in contrast to the present communal regulation\r\nof shellfisheries. In all business individual initiative and effort\r\nfurnish the keynote of success, and the future wellfare of the\r\nshellfisheries depends upon the application of this principle.\r\n\r\nNature cannot without the aid and co-operation of man repair the\r\nill-advised, untimely and exhaustive inroads made in her resources.\r\nThis is shown in the thousands of acres of good farm lands made\r\nunproductive by unwise treatment, and by the wasteful destruction\r\nof our forests. It is as strikingly shown in the decline of our\r\nshellfisheries. The fisherman exhausts the wealth of the flats by\r\ndestroying both young and adults, and returns nothing. The result is\r\ndecrease and ultimate extermination. The farmer prepares his land\r\ncarefully and intelligently, plants his seed and in due time reaps a\r\nharvest. If the fisherman could have similar rights over the tidal\r\nareas, he could with far less labor and capital and with far greater\r\ncertainty year by year reap a continuous harvest at all seasons. The\r\nsuccess of the leasing system in other States, notably Louisiana, Rhode\r\nIsland and others, is definite and conspicuous.\r\n\r\n_The Obstacles to this Proposed System._--Before the proposed system\r\nof titles to shellfish ground can be put in actual operation, it\r\nis absolutely necessary to have all rights and special privileges\r\npertaining to shore areas revested in State control by repeal of\r\ncertain laws. In this centralization of authority four main factors\r\nmust be carefully considered: (1) communal rights to fisheries in\r\ntidal areas, as in the colonial beach law of 1641-47; (2) the theory,\r\npractice and results of town supervision and control; (3) the rights\r\nof riparian owners; (4) the rights of the fishermen and of all other\r\ninhabitants of the State. So important are all four that it is\r\nnecessary to discuss each in turn.\r\n\r\n(1) _Communal Fishery Rights of the Public._--The fundamental principle\r\nupon which the shellfish laws of the State are founded is the so-called\r\nbeach or free fishing right of the public. While in other States shore\r\nproperty extends only to mean high water, in Massachusetts, Maine and\r\nVirginia, the earliest States to enact colonial laws, the riparian\r\nproperty holders own to mean low-water mark. But by specific exception\r\nand according to further provisions of this same ancient law the right\r\nof fishing (which includes the shellfisheries) below high-water mark is\r\nfree to any inhabitant of the Commonwealth. The act reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    SECTION 2. Every inhabitant who is an householder shall have\r\n    free fishing and fowling in any great ponds, bays, coves and\r\n    rivers, so far as the sea ebbs and flows within the precincts\r\n    of the town where they dwell, unless the freemen of the same\r\n    town or the General Court have otherwise appropriated them.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that some change be made in this law, which at present\r\noffers no protection to the planters. Its repeal is by no means\r\nnecessary, as the matter can be adjusted by merely adding \"except for\r\nthe taking of mollusks from the areas set apart and leased for the\r\ncultivation of mollusks.\"\r\n\r\n(2) _Results of Town Administration of Mollusk Fisheries._--All\r\nauthority to control mollusk privileges was originally vested in the\r\nState. The towns, as the ancient statutes will show, derived this\r\nauthority from the higher State authority, developed their systems\r\nof local regulations or by-laws only with the State permission, and\r\neven now they enjoy the fruits of these concessions solely with the\r\nactive consent of the Legislature. Thus the State has ever been, and\r\nis at present, the source of town control. The towns have no rights of\r\nsupervision and control over shellfisheries except as derived from the\r\nGeneral Court. The State gave them this authority in the beginning. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that the Legislature can withdraw this delegated\r\nauthority at any time when it is convinced that it is for the benefit\r\nof the State so to do. To those few who are directly profiting at the\r\nexpense of the many, this resumption of authority by the State may seem\r\nat first sight a high-handed proceeding, but a brief survey of the\r\nfacts will prove it to be justly warranted and eminently desirable. The\r\npresent system of town control has had a sufficient trial. It is in its\r\nvery essentials an un-business-like proceeding. A large number of towns\r\nacting in this matter as disorganized units working independently of\r\none another could not in the nature of things evolve any co-ordinated\r\nand unified system which would be to the advantage of all. The problems\r\ninvolved are too complicated, requiring both broad and special\r\nknowledge, which cannot be acquired in a short term of experience.\r\nLastly, the temptations of local politics have been found to be too\r\ninsistent to guarantee completely fair allotment of valuable privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature has not only acted unwisely in allowing the towns\r\nin this respect thus to mismanage their affairs, but it has not\r\nfulfilled its duty to the Commonwealth as a whole. The Legislature\r\nhas unwittingly delegated valuable sources of wealth and revenue, the\r\nfruits of which should have been enjoyed at least in some degree,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, by all citizens of the Commonwealth alike as\r\nwell as by those of the coast towns. Many of the coast cities and\r\ntowns have dealt with this opportunity very unwisely, and few have\r\ndeveloped or even maintained unimpaired this extremely valuable asset\r\nof the State. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that such important\r\nsources of wealth as the shellfisheries are not the property of the\r\ncoast towns alone; they are the property of the whole Commonwealth,\r\nand the whole Commonwealth should share in these benefits. In\r\nallowing these valuable resources to be mismanaged and dissipated by\r\nthe shore towns, the Legislature has done a great injury to all the\r\ninland communities, and, indeed, even to those very coast towns for\r\nwhose benefit such legislation was enacted. The Legislature was not\r\njustified, in the first place, in granting jurisdiction over these\r\nimportant industries belonging equally to the whole Commonwealth and\r\nto the coast towns. It was but an experiment. Inasmuch as these towns\r\nhave grossly mismanaged the trust placed in them, the Legislature is\r\ndoubly under the obligation to take advantage of the knowledge gained\r\nby this experimental delegation of the State authority to cities and\r\ntowns. The completely obvious obligation of the Legislature is to\r\nremove what is either tacitly or frankly acknowledged by many city and\r\ntown authorities to be an impossible burden upon the city or town, and\r\nto restore to State officers the general administrative control and\r\nsupervision of the public rights in the shellfisheries.\r\n\r\n(3) _Riparian Ownership does not include Exclusive Fishing\r\nRights._--The third objection is that in the assumption of State\r\ncontrol is involved the much-discussed and vaguely understood question\r\nof riparian ownership. To make plain the conditions relative to the\r\nfisheries, including the shellfisheries on the tidal flats, it should\r\nbe borne in mind that in only four States, Virginia and Maryland,\r\nMassachusetts and Maine, does the title of the riparian owner extend\r\nto low-water mark, but in these States the right of fishing, fowling\r\nand boating are specifically mentioned as not included in the title.\r\nUnder the existing laws owners of seashore property in Massachusetts\r\npossess certain rights (though perhaps not in all cases clearly\r\ndefined) over the tidal areas within 100 rods of the mean high-water\r\nmark. As the proposed system of shellfish grants deals with this\r\nterritory between high and low water marks, it is necessary to see in\r\nwhat manner, if any, the rights at present possessed by riparian owners\r\nwould be impaired by the leasing of certain rights of fishing. While\r\nthe riparian owner has in a measure authority over the territory which\r\nborders his upland, there are certain specific limitations to this\r\nauthority. He does not have exclusive rights of hunting, boating and\r\nfishing between the tide lines on his own property, but participates\r\nin these rights equally with every citizen of this Commonwealth. The\r\ncourts have distinctly held that shellfish are fish, and that a man may\r\nfish--_i.e._, dig clams--on the tidal flats adjoining the shore without\r\nthe consent of the riparian owner.\r\n\r\n(4) _Rights of the Fishermen and of All Citizens._--The fishermen as\r\na class are best located to benefit most from an opportunity to lease\r\nexclusive fishing rights, whether they chance to be riparian owners\r\nor not, though every other citizen of this Commonwealth who so desired\r\nwould not be excluded from an opportunity to secure a similar lease.\r\nThe personnel of the fisher class has vastly changed in the past\r\ndecade. There are to-day two distinct types: The permanent resident,\r\nusually native born, bound to a definite locality by ties of home and\r\nkin and of long association,--a most useful type of citizen. Contrasted\r\nwith this is the other, a more rapidly increasing class,--foreign born,\r\nunnaturalized, nomadic, a humble soldier of fortune, a hanger-on in\r\nthe outskirts of urban civilization, eking out an existence by selling\r\nor eating the shellfish from the public fishing grounds. Too ignorant\r\nto appreciate the importance of sanitary precaution, the alien clammer\r\nhaunts the proscribed territory polluted by sewage, and does much to\r\nkeep the dangerous typhoid germ in active circulation in the community.\r\n\r\nThe public mollusk fisheries only foster such types of non-producers,\r\nand prevent them from becoming desirable citizens. The best class\r\nof fishermen and citizens has no advantage over the worst, but is\r\npractically compelled to engage in the same sort of petty buccaneering\r\nand wilfully destructive digging, in order to prevent that portion\r\nand privilege of fishing which the law says shall belong to every\r\nhouseholder and freeman of the Commonwealth from being appropriated by\r\nthese humble freebooters, who are at once the annoyance, the terror and\r\nthe despair of cottagers and shore dwellers.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions would be almost completely corrected by the\r\nlease of the flats to individuals, thus removing from the fishermen\r\nstultifying competition and compelling these irresponsible wandering\r\naliens to acquire definite location. But most particularly a system of\r\nleasing would permit each person to profit according to his industry,\r\nperseverance, thrift and foresight.\r\n\r\n_The Grants._--As previously stated, the grants should be made into\r\ntwo divisions: (1) including suitable areas between the high and low\r\nwater marks; (2) territory below mean low-water mark. The privilege of\r\nplanting and growing all shellfish should be given for both classes\r\nof grants. Class 1 would be primarily for the planting of clams,\r\nwith additional rights over oysters and quahaugs; class 2 would be\r\nprimarily for the planting of quahaugs and oysters, with possible\r\nrights over clams and scallops.\r\n\r\nThe grants should be leased for a limited period of years, with the\r\nprivilege of renewal provided the owner had fulfilled the stipulated\r\nrequirements of the lease. In order, however, that these leases should\r\nnot degenerate into deeds, to be handed down from father to son, it\r\nmight be necessary to assign a maximum time limit during which a man\r\nmight remain in control of any particular lease. This would be merely\r\nfair play to all concerned, for it would not be just to allow one man\r\nto monopolize a particularly fine piece of property, while his equally\r\ndeserving neighbor had land of far less productive value. In connection\r\nwith this clause should follow some provisions for payment of the value\r\nof improvements. Should there be more than one claimant for lease of\r\nany particular area, some principle of selection, such as priority of\r\napplication, highest bid, etc., should be established.\r\n\r\nThat there may be no holding of grants for purposes other than those\r\nstipulated in the agreement, there should be a certain cultural\r\nstandard of excellence to be decided upon relative to the use made\r\nof the granted areas. A clause of this kind is necessary in order to\r\nkeep the system in a proper state of efficiency, and to insure the\r\ndevelopment of the shellfish industries.\r\n\r\nAll taxes on the capital invested in these grants and taxes upon the\r\nincome should go to the town in which the leasehold is situated. In\r\naddition, there should be a just and equable revenue assessed by\r\nthe State on every grant, as rent for the same. This rent should be\r\napportioned according to a fixed scale in determining the relative\r\nvalues of the grants, and should be paid annually, under penalty of\r\nforfeiture. The revenue might be divided into two parts: one part to\r\ngo to the State department having the control of the shellfisheries,\r\nfor the maintenance of a survey, control and protection of property\r\non leased areas, and other work; the second part to go to the town\r\ntreasury of the community in which the grant is located, to be expended\r\nunder the direction and control of responsible State officials in\r\nrestocking barren flats and otherwise developing the shellfish upon\r\nits unleased territory which is open for free public use.\r\n\r\n_Grants to be Nontransferable._--These grants, while designed for the\r\nuse of all citizens of the Commonwealth, should be made especially\r\navailable for the poor man with little capital. In order to assure\r\nthe poor man of the enjoyment of his privilege, it is necessary to\r\nguard against the possibility of undue monopolization. Leases must,\r\ntherefore, be strictly nontransferable. Neither should areas be rented\r\nto another individual under any consideration whatever. Every grant\r\nmust be for the benefit of its individual owner. He should be at\r\nliberty to hire laborers to assist him in working his grant, but not\r\nto transfer it in any way. Any attempt on his part to do so should not\r\nonly immediately result in the forfeiture of his grant, but should also\r\nsubject him to a heavy penalty.\r\n\r\n_Survey._--In order to guard against confusion and to maintain an\r\norderly system, an accurate survey of all granted areas should be made.\r\nThe ranges of every grant should be determined and recorded. The plots\r\nshould be numbered and properly staked or buoyed, and a record of the\r\nsame, giving the name of the owner, yearly rental and value, should\r\nbe kept on file at the proper town and State offices. The same system\r\nwhich is now in operation in the oyster industry of other States should\r\nbe applied to all the mollusk fisheries of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n_Administration._--The department of the State government under whose\r\njurisdiction this system of leases may come should be indued with full\r\nauthority, properly defined, to supervise the grants, furnish them with\r\nadequate protection by the employment of State or town police, oversee\r\nthe survey, allot the grants, and to exercise such other powers as may\r\nbe necessary to develop the system, remedy its defects and strengthen\r\nits efficiency.\r\n\r\n_Protection of Property and of the Rights granted by the Lease._--No\r\nsystem of shellfish grants is possible without absolute protection.\r\nThe lessee must be permitted to cultivate his grant free from outside\r\ninterference, and thus, with reasonably good fortune, he can enjoy the\r\nfruits of his labors. This protection, which is the greatest and most\r\nvital need of the entire system, and the foundation upon which depends\r\nits whole success, must be insured by proper legislation rigorously\r\nenforced, and accompanied by severe penalties.\r\n\r\n_Leasing of the Grants._--Every citizen of the Commonwealth is entitled\r\nto participate in this system, but for obvious reasons an inhabitant\r\nof any coast town should be given first choice of grants within the\r\nboundary of his particular town. The first grants might be given by\r\nallotment, but after the system had become well established, they could\r\nbe issued in the order of their application.\r\n\r\n_Water Pollution._--The sanitary condition of the marketed shellfish\r\ntaken from contaminated waters is not only at present to some extent\r\nendangering the public health, but is placing an undeserved stigma\r\nupon a most reputable and valuable source of food supply for the\r\npublic. The public should demand laws closing, after proper scientific\r\ninvestigation, these polluted areas, and conferring the power to\r\nthoroughly enforce such laws. The danger arising from contamination\r\nshould be reduced to a minimum by prescribing some definite regulations\r\nfor transferring shellfish from these polluted waters to places free\r\nfrom contamination, where the shellfish may in brief season be rendered\r\nfit for the market.\r\n\r\nIt should be unlawful to use any brand, label or other device for\r\ndesignation, intended to give the impression that certain oysters\r\noffered for sale were grown at specified places, _e.g._, Cotuit,\r\nWellfleet, Wareham, etc., unless such oysters were actually planted,\r\ngrown or cultivated within the towns or waters designated, for a period\r\nof at least three months immediately previous to the date of marketing.\r\nFurthermore, there should be appointed proper inspectors, whose duties\r\nwould be to guarantee by certificates, labels and stamps the purity\r\nof shellfish placed upon the market, and likewise have the power of\r\nenforcing severe penalties on violators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHELLFISHERIES OF MASSACHUSETTS: THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND EXTENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n               By D. L. BELDING, assisted by F. C. LANE.\r\n\r\n  DR. GEORGE W. FIELD, _Chairman, Commission on Fisheries and Game_.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I herewith submit the following report upon the present extent\r\nand condition of the shellfish industries of Massachusetts. The\r\nfollowing biological survey was made in connection with the work done\r\nunder chapters 49, 73, 78 and 93, Resolves of 1905, and chapter 74,\r\nResolves of 1906. The statistics and survey records which furnish the\r\nbasis of the report were obtained by D. L. Belding and F. C. Lane.\r\n\r\n                        Respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n                                                       DAVID L. BELDING,\r\n                                                            _Biologist_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nWhen money was first appropriated in 1905 for a three-year\r\ninvestigation of the life, habits and methods of culture of the clam,\r\nquahaug, oyster and scallop, provision was made for a survey of the\r\npresent productive and nonproductive areas suitable for the cultivation\r\nof these four shellfish. The following report embodies the results of\r\nthis survey.\r\n\r\n_A. Method of Work._--In making this survey two objects were in view,\r\nwhich permit the grouping of the work under two main heads:--\r\n\r\n(1) A survey of the productive and nonproductive shellfish areas of\r\nthe State was undertaken, showing by charts the location, extent and\r\nabundance of each of the four shellfish, as well as the biological\r\nconditions of the waters and soils of the areas along the entire coast\r\nwhich could be made more productive under proper cultural methods.\r\nWherever possible, information as to the production of certain areas\r\nwas obtained from the shellfishermen as a supplement to the survey work.\r\n\r\n(2) Statistical records of the four shellfish industries were\r\nformulated, showing their value and extent as regards (_a_) production,\r\n(_b_) capital invested, (_c_) men employed. Data for these records were\r\nobtained from town records, from market reports and from the dealers\r\nand shellfishermen, both by personal interviews and by tabulated forms\r\nof printed questions. Owing to the present chaotic condition of the\r\nshellfisheries, it has been impossible to obtain absolutely exact data.\r\nThe statistics that have been obtained are to all purposes correct, and\r\nare the most exact figures ever published on the subject.\r\n\r\n_B. Value of the Survey._--Before any reform measures of practical\r\nvalue can be advanced, accurate and comprehensive knowledge of the\r\npresent shellfish situation in Massachusetts is absolutely essential.\r\nUp to this time there have been only vague and inaccurate conjectures\r\nas to the value of the shellfisheries, and even the fisherman, outside\r\nhis own district, has little knowledge of their extent and their\r\neconomic possibilities. The consumer has far less knowledge. For\r\nthe first time this problem of the Massachusetts shellfisheries has\r\nbeen approached from the point of view of the economic biologist.\r\nThis survey is intended to present a concise yet detailed account of\r\nthe present status of the shellfisheries of Massachusetts, and is\r\ntherefore the first step towards the preservation of our shellfisheries\r\nby providing a workable basis for the restocking of the barren and\r\nunproductive areas. It is hoped that it will be of interest both to the\r\nfishermen and consumers.\r\n\r\n_C. Presentation of the Report._--The first part of the report presents\r\nthe general results of the survey, _i.e._, the present condition of\r\nthe shellfisheries, while the second part deals directly with details\r\nof the survey. The report is divided into four parts, each shellfish\r\nbeing considered separately. Under each is grouped (1) the industry as\r\na whole; (2) a statistical summary of the industry for the whole State;\r\n(3) the towns of the State and their individual industries. A series\r\nof charts showing the shellfish areas of the State makes clear the\r\ndescription of the survey.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Situation._--The peculiar geographical situation of\r\nMassachusetts renders possible the production of the four edible\r\nshellfish--clam, oyster, quahaug and scallop,--in great abundance.\r\nCape Cod forms the dividing line between the northern and the southern\r\nfauna, which furnish the coast of Massachusetts with a diversity of\r\nmolluscan life. Zoölogically, the Massachusetts coast is the point\r\nwhere the habitats of the northern (the soft clam, _Mya arenaria_)\r\nand the southern clam (the quahaug, hard clam or little neck, _Venus\r\nmercenaria_) overlap. Nature has favored Massachusetts with a coast\r\nindented with bays, estuaries and inlets which are especially adapted\r\nfor the growth of marine food mollusks.\r\n\r\n_Former Natural Abundance._--If we compare the natural shellfish areas\r\nof to-day with those of former years, we find a great change. All\r\nfour shellfish formerly throve in large numbers in the numerous bays\r\nand indentations of our coast line. The area between tide marks was\r\nformerly inhabited by quantities of soft clams, and the muddy patches\r\njust below low-water mark produced great numbers of quahaugs. In the\r\nestuaries were extensive natural oyster beds. On our shoals it was\r\npossible to gather many thousand bushels of scallops. Now thousands\r\nof acres once productive lie barren, and we have but a remnant of the\r\nformer abundant yield.\r\n\r\n_Historical Wastefulness._--History tells us that the Pilgrims at\r\nPlymouth \"sucked the abundance of the seas\" and found health and\r\nwealth. But between the lines of history we can read a tale of\r\nwastefulness and prodigality with hardly a parallel, and to-day we\r\nfind the natural heritage of the shellfisheries almost totally wasted\r\nthrough the careless indifference of our forefathers. Prof. James L.\r\nKellogg, in the introduction to his \"Notes on Marine Food Mollusks of\r\nLouisiana,\" gives the following excellent account of the exploiting of\r\nnatural resources:--\r\n\r\n    As one looks over the record of the settling of this country,\r\n    and notes how a continent was reclaimed from a state of\r\n    nature, he can hardly fail to be impressed with the reckless\r\n    wastefulness of his ancestors in their use of the treasures\r\n    which nature, through eons of time, had been collecting.\r\n    In thousands of cases, natural resources, which, carefully\r\n    conserved, would have provided comfort and even luxury for\r\n    generations of men, have been dissipated and destroyed\r\n    with no substantial benefit to any one. They scattered our\r\n    inheritance. Such knowledge dulls a feeling of gratitude that\r\n    may be due to them for their many beneficent acts,--though\r\n    the truth probably is that few of them ever had a thought of\r\n    their descendants. Men seldom seem to have a weighty sense of\r\n    responsibility toward others than those who immediately follow\r\n    them. The history of the prodigality of our ancestors since\r\n    their occupation of this great continent has not fully been\r\n    written,--and it should be, in such a way that the present\r\n    generation might know it; for sometimes it seems as if the\r\n    present generation were as criminally careless of the natural\r\n    resources that remain to it as were any of those that are gone.\r\n    Perhaps it is hardly that. We have learned some wisdom from the\r\n    past, because our attention has recently been drawn to the fact\r\n    of the annihilation of several former sources of subsistence.\r\n    Rapidly in America, in recent years, the struggle to obtain\r\n    support for a family has become more severe to the wage earner.\r\n    In thirty years the increasing fierceness of competition\r\n    has resulted in a revolution of business methods. In every\r\n    profession and in every line of business only the most capable\r\n    are able to obtain what the mediocre received for their honest\r\n    labor in the last generation.\r\n\r\n    But it is easier to condemn the past for its failures than\r\n    to recognize and condemn those of our own generation. The\r\n    average man really has a blind and unreasoning faith in his\r\n    own time, and to laud only its successes is to be applauded\r\n    as an optimist. In the present stage of our national life we\r\n    certainly have no room for the pessimist, who is merely a\r\n    dyspeptic faultfinder; nor for the optimist, who blinds his\r\n    eyes to our faults and mistakes, and so fails to read their\r\n    priceless lessons. Instead, our intelligence, as a race, has\r\n    reached that degree of development which should give it the\r\n    courage to consider \"things as they are.\"\r\n\r\n    Considering things as they are, we must admit that we are not\r\n    realizing our obligations to future generations in many of\r\n    the ways in which we are misusing our natural resources. This\r\n    waste is often deliberate, though usually due to the notion\r\n    that nature's supplies, especially of living organisms, are\r\n    limitless. The waste of 70 or 80 per cent, in lumbering the\r\n    Oregon \"big trees,\" and the clean sweep of the Louisiana pine,\r\n    now in progress, is deliberately calculated destruction for\r\n    present gain,--and the future may take care of itself. In\r\n    making millionaires of a very few men, most of whom are still\r\n    living, a large part of the lower peninsula of Michigan was\r\n    made a hopeless desert. To \"cut and come again\" is not a part\r\n    of the moral codes of such men. It seems to mean sacrifice; and\r\n    yet they are woefully mistaken, even in that.\r\n\r\n    But most often, no doubt, the extinction of useful animals and\r\n    plants, that we have so often witnessed, has been due to the\r\n    ignorant assumption that, under any circumstances, the supply\r\n    would last forever. This idea seems especially to prevail\r\n    concerning marine food animals. The fact that the sea is vast\r\n    might naturally give the impression that its inhabitants are\r\n    numberless.... But when a natural food supply nears complete\r\n    annihilation, men begin to think of the necessity of a method\r\n    of artificial culture.[1]\r\n\r\n_Present Unimproved Resources._--In spite of the wastefulness of former\r\ngenerations, many areas can again be made to produce the normal yield\r\nif proper and adequate measures are promptly taken to restore to the\r\nflats, estuaries and bays of Massachusetts their normal productive\r\ncapacity. In spite of the fact that some of the natural beds have\r\nentirely disappeared, either \"fished out\" or buried under the débris of\r\ncivilization, and others are in imminent danger of becoming exhausted,\r\nMassachusetts still possesses a sufficient natural supply to restock\r\nmost of these barren areas.\r\n\r\n_Possibilities of Development._--Opportunities for development are\r\nalluring. The shellfisheries could be increased, in these days of rapid\r\ntransit and marketing facilities, into industries which would furnish\r\nsteady employment for thousands of men and women, both directly and\r\nindirectly, resulting in a product valued at a minimum of $3,000,000\r\nannually, with possibilities of indefinite expansion. At present the\r\nidea of marine farming attracts popular attention. The conditions are\r\nparallel to agriculture, except that in the case of marine farming the\r\ncrops are more certain,--_i.e._, are not subject to so many fatalities.\r\nThe experiments of the Department of Fisheries and Game for the past\r\nthree years have proved that cultivation of shellfish offers great\r\ninducements and profit to both individuals and towns. When the present\r\nwaste areas are again made productive, the value of the annual catch\r\nshould be increased tenfold.\r\n\r\n         _Statistical Summary of the Shellfisheries for 1907._\r\n\r\n  =================+=====================++=========+===========+==========\r\n                   |     PRODUCTION.     ||         |           |\r\n  NAME OF MOLLUSK. +----------+----------++ Area in |  Capital  |    Men\r\n                   | Bushels. |  Value.  || Acres.  | invested. | employed.\r\n  -----------------+----------+----------++---------+-----------+----------\r\n  Clam,            |  153,865 | $150,440 ||   5,111 |  $18,142  |   1,361\r\n  Oyster,          |  161,182 |  176,142 ||   2,400 |  268,702  |     159\r\n  Quahaug,         |  144,044 |  194,687 ||  28,090 |   94,260  |     745\r\n  Scallop,         |  103,000 |  164,436 ||  30,900 |  121,753  |     647\r\n                   +----------+----------++---------+-----------+----------\r\n      Total,       |  562,091 | $685,705 ||  66,501 | $502,857  |   2,912\r\n  =================+==========+==========++=========+===========+==========\r\n\r\nIn the above table the areas for the scallop, clam and quahaug are only\r\napproximate.

Under the present methods of production, the\r\naverage value per acre is only $17; each acre, if properly farmed,\r\nshould furnish an annual production of at least $100, or six times\r\nthe present yield. The shellfish areas of Massachusetts which are at\r\npresent utilized are giving almost a minimum production, instead of\r\nthe enormous yield which they are capable of furnishing. All that\r\nis necessary to procure the maximum yield is the application of\r\nsystematic cultural methods, instead of relying on an impoverished\r\nnatural supply. Not only are the productive areas furnishing far less\r\nthan they are capable of producing, but also Massachusetts possesses\r\n6,000 acres of barren flats, which should become, under the proper\r\ncultural methods, as valuable as the productive areas. (This has been\r\nexperimentally demonstrated by the commission.) While it is possible\r\nto develop, through cultural methods, these latent natural resources,\r\nit will take years to bring them to a high degree of development. It\r\ncan be partially accomplished, at least, in the next few years, and the\r\npresent production increased several times, _as nature responds to the\r\nslightest intelligent effort of man, and gives large returns_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE SHELLFISHERIES.\r\n\r\n_A. Is there a Decline?_\r\n\r\n(1) So obvious is the general decline of the shellfisheries that almost\r\nevery one is aware, through the increasing prices and difficulty of\r\nsupplying the demand, that the natural supply is becoming exhausted.\r\n\r\n(2) Statistical figures of the shellfish production not only show a\r\ndecline, but conceal a rapid diminution of the supply.\r\n\r\n(3) Production statistics alone should never be taken as typifying the\r\nreal conditions of an industry, as such figures are often extremely\r\ndeceiving. For instance:--\r\n\r\n(4) The increased prices, stimulated by an increasing demand, have\r\ncaused a greater number of men, equipped with the best modern\r\nimplements, to swell the production by overworking shellfish areas\r\nwhich in reality are not one-fourth so productive as they were ten\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nWhile the general decline of the shellfisheries is a matter of public\r\nknowledge, specific illustrations of this decline have been lacking.\r\nThe present report calls attention to actual facts as proofs of the\r\ndecline of each shellfishery, by a comparison of the present conditions\r\nin various localities with the conditions of 1879. The only past record\r\nof Massachusetts shellfisheries of any importance is found in the\r\nreport of the United States Fish Commission for 1883, and, although\r\nthis is very limited, it is sufficient to furnish many examples of the\r\nextinction or decline of the shellfisheries in certain localities.\r\n\r\nIn a general consideration of the shellfisheries, it is noticeable that\r\nin certain localities the extinction of the industry has been total, in\r\nothers only partial, while others have remained unchanged or have even\r\nimproved. This last class is found either where the natural advantages\r\nare so great that the resources have not been exploited, or where\r\nmen have, through wise laws and cultural methods (as in the oyster\r\nindustry), preserved and built up the shellfisheries.\r\n\r\n_1879_ v. _1907_.--In comparing the present condition of the\r\nshellfisheries with that of 1879, it will be seen that many changes\r\nhave taken place. Even twenty-five years ago inroads were being made\r\nupon the natural supply; from that time to the present can be traced\r\na steady decline. During the past five years the production has been\r\naugmented by additional men, who have entered into the business\r\nunder the attraction of higher prices, and the extension of the\r\nquahaug and oyster fisheries. Though the annual catch is greater,\r\na disproportionately greater amount of time, labor and capital is\r\nrequired to secure an equal quantity of shellfish.\r\n\r\n  ==========================+==========+==========+==========\r\n                            |   1907.  |   1879.  |   Gain.\r\n  --------------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n  Production (bushels),     |  562,991 |  264,818 |  297,273\r\n  Men,                      |    2,912 |      910 |    2,092\r\n  Capital,                  | $502,857 | $165,000 | $337,857\r\n  Area (acres),             |   66,501 |   66,501 |        -\r\n  ==========================+==========+==========+==========\r\n\r\nThe following instances illustrate specific decline in the various\r\nnatural shellfisheries:--\r\n\r\n(1) Oyster industry, natural beds: Wareham, Marion, Bourne, Wellfleet,\r\nCharles River.\r\n\r\n(2) Sea clam industry: Dennis, Chatham, Nantucket.\r\n\r\n(3) Scallop industry: Buzzards Bay and north side of Cape Cod\r\n(Barnstable).\r\n\r\n(4) Clam industry: Essex, Plymouth, Duxbury, Buzzards Bay, Annisquam,\r\nWellfleet, Nantucket.\r\n\r\n(5) Quahaug industry: Chatham, Buzzards Bay, Fall River district.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the more prominent cases. Similar cases will be\r\nfound all along the coast of Massachusetts, and no one can deny that\r\nthe natural supply is rapidly becoming exhausted, and that methods are\r\nneeded to increase the production, or at least to save the little that\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n_B. Causes of the Decline._\r\n\r\nI. _An Increasing Demand._--The indirect cause of the decline of\r\nthe shellfisheries is the increased demand. To-day more shellfish\r\nare consumed than ever before, and the demand is much greater each\r\nsucceeding year. It is an economic principle that there must be an\r\nequilibrium between supply and demand. If the demand is increasing,\r\neither the supply has to increase to meet the demand, or the price of\r\nthe commodity goes up and a new equilibrium is established. The supply\r\nmust equal the demand of the market. This increasing demand has worked\r\nhavoc with the shellfisheries. There was a time when the natural supply\r\nwas of such abundance that the moderate demand of those early days\r\ncould be met without injury to the fishery. Soon this limit was passed,\r\nand with a steadily increasing demand came a corresponding drain on the\r\nnatural resources, which little by little started a decline, the result\r\nof which is to-day apparent.\r\n\r\nThe ill-advised policy of the past has been to check the demand by\r\nvarious devices, such as closed seasons, limited daily production,\r\netc. These not only have proved without benefit to the fisherman,\r\nbut also have hurt the consumer by the increased price. The demand\r\ncan be checked by raising the price, but this tends towards a class\r\ndistinction between the rich and the poor. The poor man should be able\r\nto enjoy \"the bounties of the sea\" as well as the rich. The policy of\r\nthe future should be not to check the demand, but rather to increase\r\nthe supply.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes contribute to this demand, which has unlimited\r\npossibilities of expansion:--\r\n\r\n(1) The popularity of shellfish as an article of diet is steadily\r\nincreasing, not merely for its nutritive value, but for variety and\r\nchange in diet. Fashionable fads, _i.e._, the \"little neck\" of the\r\nrestaurants and hotels, contribute to the popularity of these shellfish.\r\n\r\n(2) In the present age, transportation facilities and cold storage make\r\npossible shipments to all parts of the United States, and continually\r\nwiden the market for sea foods.\r\n\r\n(3) The influx of summer people to the seashore not only causes an\r\nadditional summer demand, but also widens the popular knowledge of\r\nthese edible mollusks.\r\n\r\n(4) Advertising and more attractive methods of preserving and selling\r\nsea food by the dealers still further increase the demand.\r\n\r\nII. _Overfishing._--The immediate and direct cause of the decline\r\nis _overfishing_. Increased demand causes a severe drain upon the\r\nshellfish beds, which soon leads to _over_fishing. It is not merely\r\nthe hard working of the beds, but the continuous unmethodical and\r\nindiscriminate fishing which has caused the total extermination of once\r\nflourishing beds in certain localities. Under present methods a bed is\r\nworked until all its natural recuperatory power is exhausted, and then\r\nit is thrust aside as worthless, a barren area. Prof. Jacob Reighard,\r\nin \"Methods of Plankton Investigation in their Relation to Practical\r\nProblems,\"[3] aptly sums up the situation in his opening paragraph:--\r\n\r\n    In this country the fisherman as a rule continues to fish\r\n    in any locality until fishing in that locality has become\r\n    unprofitable. He then moves his operations to new waters until\r\n    these in turn are exhausted. He is apt to look upon each new\r\n    body of water as inexhaustible, and rarely has occasion to ask\r\n    himself whether it is possible to determine in advance the\r\n    amount of fish that he may annually take from the water without\r\n    soon depleting it.\r\n\r\nIn this way the shellfish beds have become exhausted through the\r\nindifference and lack of knowledge on the part of the fishing public.\r\nIn colonial days the resources of the shellfisheries were apparently\r\ninexhaustible. The conviction that man could ever exhaust the resources\r\nof nature took firm hold of the Puritan mind, and even in the present\r\ngeneration many still cling to this illogical doctrine, although proof\r\nto the contrary can be seen on all sides. This idea has caused great\r\nharm to the shellfisheries, stimulating men to wreck certain localities\r\nby overfishing.\r\n\r\nIII. _Pollution of Harbors and Estuaries and the Ill Effects upon\r\nPublic Health through the Shellfisheries._--The unscientific disposal\r\nof sewage, sludge, garbage and factory waste may tend to rapidly fill\r\nup the harbor channels, as well as the areas where the currents are not\r\nso rapid.\r\n\r\nCompetent authorities scout the idea that Boston harbor is at present\r\nfilling up to any considerable degree with sewage sludge, but the\r\nproblem must be met in the not distant future. This sewage sludge upon\r\nentering salt or brackish water precipitates much more rapidly than in\r\nfresh water or upon land, and becomes relatively insoluble, hence the\r\naccumulation in harbors, _e.g._, Boston and New Bedford harbors and\r\nthe estuaries of the Merrimac, Taunton and other rivers. This sludge,\r\ninstead of undergoing the normal rapid oxidation and nitrification,\r\nas it does when exposed to the air on land, undergoes in the sea\r\nwater a series of changes, mainly putrefactive, which results in the\r\nproduction of chemical substances which in solution may (1) drive away\r\nthe fish which in incredible quantities formerly resorted to that\r\nplace; (2) impair the vitality and even kill whatever fish spawn or\r\nfry may be present; (3) check the growth of or completely destroy the\r\nmicroscopic plants and animals which serve as food for the young fish\r\nand shellfish; (4) by developing areas of oily film floating upon the\r\nsurface of the water, enormous numbers of the surface-swimming larvæ of\r\nclams, quahaugs, scallops, oysters, mussels and other marine animals\r\nmay be destroyed annually. But most serious of all is the fact that\r\nall the edible mollusks, notably the clam, quahaug, oyster and mussel,\r\nact as living filters, whose function is to remove from the water\r\nthe bacteria and other microscopic plants and animals. Most of these\r\nmicroscopic organisms serve as food for the mollusk; and in instances\r\nwhere the mollusk is eaten raw or imperfectly cooked, man is liable to\r\ninfection, if the bacillus of typhoid fever or other disease chances\r\nto be present in the mollusk. Though the chance of such infection is\r\nremote, it is nevertheless actually operative. Many typhoid epidemics\r\nin this country and abroad have been found to be directly referable to\r\nshellfish from sewage-polluted waters. For these reasons approximately\r\n1,500 acres in Boston harbor and 700 acres in New Bedford harbor\r\nhave become unsuitable for the growth of shellfish; and the State\r\nBoard of Health, after investigation, decided that clams, oysters and\r\nquahaugs found within these areas are likely to be the direct cause of\r\na dangerous epidemic of typhoid. For this reason the taking of these\r\nshellfish for any purpose was very properly prohibited; but at the last\r\nsession of the Legislature a bill was passed which permitted the taking\r\nof such shellfish for bait, upon securing permits from the Board of\r\nHealth, and providing heavy penalties for both buying and selling. As\r\na matter of fact, however, it is well-nigh impracticable to properly\r\nenforce this law, for the reason that it is possible only in very rare\r\ninstances to keep any one lot of clams known to have been dug under\r\nthese conditions under surveillance from the time of digging until they\r\nare placed upon the hook as bait. Complete prevention of the _taking_\r\nof such shellfish is the only method by which the public health can be\r\nproperly safeguarded. Even though in our opinion the annual financial\r\nloss to the public from the destruction of this public fishery by the\r\ndumping of city sewage into the water is not less than $400,000, the\r\npublic health is of greater consequence, and should not be jeopardized,\r\nas is the fact under present conditions. Until such a time as the\r\npublic realize that economic disposal of sewage must take place on land\r\nrather than in water, laws absolutely preventing any contact with the\r\ninfected shellfish should be enforced without exception. In instances\r\nlike these it is greatly to be deplored that but rarely under our\r\nsystem of government can legislation, which the best knowledge and\r\ncommon-sense demand for the public weal, be passed in its adequate and\r\nbeneficial entirety, but is so frequently emasculated in the selfish\r\ninterests of a few persons.\r\n\r\nIV. _Natural Agencies._--The above causes are given as they are\r\nobviously important, but by no means are they to be considered the only\r\nreasons. Geographic and climatic changes often explain the extinction\r\nof shellfish in certain localities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT ABUSES OF THE SHELLFISHERIES.\r\n\r\nNot only has this survey shown by specific examples the alarming but\r\nactual decline of the natural shellfish supply (in spite of deceptive\r\nproduction statistics), but it has brought to light numerous evils\r\nof various kinds. These abuses have developed gradually with the\r\nrise of the shellfisheries, until at the present day they cannot be\r\noverlooked or considered unimportant. So closely are these connected\r\nwith the present status of our shellfishery that upon their abolition\r\ndepends its future success or failure. Some need immediate attention;\r\nothers will require attention later. After a thorough and competent\r\ninvestigation, remedies for the correction of each evil should be\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nIn the future Massachusetts will have to utilize all her wealth of\r\nnatural resources, to keep her leading position among the other States\r\nof the Union. To do this she should turn to her sea fisheries, which\r\nhave in the past made her rich, and hold forth prospects of greater\r\nwealth in the future. Untold possibilities of wealth rest with her\r\nshellfisheries, if obsolete methods and traditions can be cast aside.\r\nIn any age of progress the ancient and worthless must be buried\r\nbeneath the ruins of the past, while the newer and better take their\r\nplace. There is no more flagrant example of obsolete methods and\r\ntraditions holding in check the development of an industry than with\r\nthe shellfisheries, and it is time that Massachusetts realized these\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\nThe shellfisheries of Massachusetts are in a chaotic state, both\r\nlegally and economically. The finest natural facilities are wasted,\r\nand thousands of acres of profitable flats are allowed to lie barren\r\nmerely for a lack of initiative on the part of the general public.\r\nThis chaotic and unproductive state will exist until both the consumer\r\nand the fishermen alike understand the true condition of affairs, and\r\nrealize that in the bays, estuaries and flats of Massachusetts lies as\r\nmuch or more wealth, acre for acre, as in the most productive market\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island the clam and scallop fisheries have almost disappeared.\r\nFive or ten years from now the shellfisheries of Massachusetts will be\r\nin a similar condition, and beyond remedy. Now is the time for reform.\r\nThe solution of the problem is simple. Shellfish farming is the only\r\npossible way in which Massachusetts can restore her natural supply to\r\nits former abundance.\r\n\r\nI. _The Shellfish Laws._--The first evils which demand attention\r\nare the existing shellfish laws. While these are supposed to wisely\r\nregulate the shellfisheries, in reality they do more harm than good,\r\nand are direct obstacles to any movement toward improving the natural\r\nresources. Before Massachusetts can take any steps toward cultivating\r\nher unproductive shellfish areas, it will be necessary to modify the\r\nworst of these laws.\r\n\r\n_A. Fishery Rights of the Public._--The fundamental principle upon\r\nwhich the shellfish laws of the State are founded is the so-called\r\nbeach or free fishing rights of the public. While in other States\r\nproperty extends only to mean high water, in Massachusetts the property\r\nholders own to extreme low-water mark. Nevertheless, according to\r\nfurther provisions of this ancient law, the right of fishing (which\r\nincludes the shellfisheries) below high-water mark is free to any\r\ninhabitant of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n(1) _Origin._--The first authentic record of this law is found under\r\nan act of Massachusetts, in 1641-47, by which every householder\r\nwas allowed \"free fishing and fowling\" in any of the great ponds,\r\nbays, coves and rivers, as far \"as the sea ebbs and flows,\" in their\r\nrespective towns, unless \"the freemen\" or the General Court \"had\r\notherwise appropriated them.\" From this date the shellfisheries were\r\ndeclared to be forever the property of the whole people, _i.e._, the\r\nState, and have been for a long period open to any inhabitant of the\r\nState who wished to dig the shellfish for food or for bait.\r\n\r\n(2) _Early Benefits._--In the early days, when the natural supply was\r\napparently inexhaustible and practically the entire population resided\r\non or near the seacoast, it was just that all people should have common\r\nrights to the shore fisheries. As long as the natural supply was more\r\nthan sufficient for the demand, no law could have been better adapted\r\nfor the public good.\r\n\r\n(3) _Present Inadequacy._--Two hundred and fifty years have passed\r\nsince this law was first made. The condition of the shellfisheries has\r\nchanged. No longer do the flats of Massachusetts yield the enormous\r\nharvest of former years, but lie barren and unproductive. The law which\r\nonce was a benefit to all has now become antiquated, and incapable of\r\nmeeting the new conditions.\r\n\r\n(4) _Evil Effects._--If this law were merely antiquated, it could\r\nbe laid aside unnoticed. On the contrary, as applied to the present\r\nconditions of the shellfisheries it not only checks any advancement,\r\nbut works positive harm. From the mistaken comprehension of the\r\nso-called beach rights of the people, the general public throughout\r\nthe State is forced to pay an exorbitant price for sea food, and the\r\nenterprising fishermen are deprived of a more profitable livelihood.\r\nThe present law discriminates against the progressive majority of\r\nfishermen in order to benefit a small unprogressive element.\r\n\r\n(5) _Protection._--If shellfish farming is ever to be put on a paying\r\nbasis, it is essential that the planter have absolute _protection_. No\r\nman is willing to invest capital and labor when protection cannot be\r\nguaranteed. What good does it do a man to plant a hundred bushels of\r\nclams, if the next person has a legal right to dig them? Since the\r\nlaw absolutely refuses any protection to the shellfish culturist,\r\nMassachusetts can never restock her barren flats and re-establish\r\nher shellfisheries until this law is modified to meet the changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n(6) _Who are the Objectors?_ Objectors to any new system are always\r\nfound, and are not lacking in the case of shellfish culture. These\r\nwould immediately raise the cry that the public is being deprived of\r\nits rights. To-day the public has fewer rights than ever. The present\r\nlaw causes class distinctions, and a few are benefited at the expense\r\nof the public. The industrious fisherman suffers because a few of the\r\nworthless, unenterprising class, who have no energy, do not wish others\r\nto succeed where they cannot. In every seacoast town in Massachusetts\r\nthe more enlightened fishermen see clearly that the only way to\r\npreserve the shellfisheries is to _cultivate the barren areas_.\r\n\r\nHon. B. F. Wood, in his report of the shellfisheries of New York, in\r\n1906, clearly states the case.[4]\r\n\r\n    There is, unfortunately, in some of the towns and villages\r\n    upon our coast an unprogressive element, composed of those who\r\n    prefer to reap where they have not sown; who rely upon what\r\n    they term their \"natural right\" to rake where they may choose\r\n    in the public waters. They deplete, but do not build up. They\r\n    think because it may be possible to go out upon the waters for\r\n    a few hours in the twenty-four (when the tide serves) and dig a\r\n    half peck of shellfish, that it is sufficient reason why such\r\n    lands should not be leased by the State to private planters. It\r\n    might as well be said that it is wrong for the government to\r\n    grant homestead farms to settlers, because a few blackberries\r\n    might be plucked upon the lands by any who cared to look for\r\n    them.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from the report of the Massachusetts\r\nCommissioners on Fisheries and Game for 1906:[5]--\r\n\r\n    There are at least four distinct classes within our\r\n    Commonwealth, each of which either derive direct benefits from\r\n    the mollusk fisheries of our coast, or are indirectly benefited\r\n    by the products of the flats:--\r\n\r\n    (1) The general public,--the consumers, who ultimately pay the\r\n    cost, who may either buy the joint product of the labor and\r\n    capital invested in taking and distributing the shellfish from\r\n    either natural or artificial beds, or who may dig shellfish for\r\n    food or bait purposes for their own or family use.\r\n\r\n    (2) The capitalist, who seeks a productive investment for money\r\n    or brains, or both. Under present laws, such are practically\r\n    restricted to _distribution_ of shellfish, except in the case\r\n    of the oyster, where capital may be employed for _production_\r\n    as well,--an obvious advantage both to capital and to the\r\n    public.\r\n\r\n    (3) The fishermen, who, either as a permanent or temporary\r\n    vocation, market the natural yield of the waters; or, as in the\r\n    case of the shellfisheries, may with a little capital increase\r\n    the natural yield and availability by cultivating an area of\r\n    the tidal flats after the manner of a garden.\r\n\r\n    (4) The owners of the land adjacent to the flats, who are under\r\n    the present laws often subjected to loss or annoyance, or even\r\n    positive discomfort, by inability to safeguard their proper\r\n    rights to a certain degree of freedom from intruders and from\r\n    damage to bathing or boating facilities, which constitute a\r\n    definite portion of the value of shore property.\r\n\r\n    All of these classes would be directly benefited by just laws,\r\n    which would encourage and safeguard all well-advised projects\r\n    for artificial cultivation of the tidal flats, and would deal\r\n    justly and intelligently with the various coincident and\r\n    conflicting rights of the fishermen, owners of shore property,\r\n    bathers and other seekers of pleasure, recreation or profit,\r\n    boatmen, and all others who hold public and private rights and\r\n    concessions.\r\n\r\n    That any one class should claim exclusive \"natural valid\r\n    rights,\" over any other class, to the shellfish products of the\r\n    shores, which the law states expressly are the property of \"the\r\n    people,\" is as absurd as to claim that any class had exclusive\r\n    natural rights to wild strawberries, raspberries, cranberries\r\n    or other wild fruits, and that therefore the land upon which\r\n    these grew could not be used for the purpose of increasing the\r\n    yield of these fruits. This becomes the more absurd from the\r\n    fact that the wild fruits pass to the owner of the title of the\r\n    land, while the shellfish are specifically exempted, and remain\r\n    the property of the public.\r\n\r\n    The class most benefited by improved laws would be the\r\n    fishermen, who would profit by better wages through the\r\n    increased quantity of shellfish they could dig per hour, by\r\n    a better market and by better prices, for the reason that\r\n    the control of the output would secure regularity of supply.\r\n    Moreover, when the market was unfavorable the shellfish could\r\n    be kept in the beds with a reasonable certainty of finding\r\n    them there when wanted, and with the added advantage of an\r\n    increased volume by growth during the interval, together with\r\n    the avoidance of cold-storage charges. Thus the diggers could\r\n    be certain of securing a supply at almost any stage of the tide\r\n    and in all but the most inclement weather, through a knowledge\r\n    of \"where to dig;\" moreover, there would be a complete\r\n    elimination of the reasoning which is now so prolific of ill\r\n    feelings and so wasteful of the shellfish, viz., the incentive\r\n    of \"getting there ahead of the other fellow.\"\r\n\r\n_B._ All the shellfish laws should be revised, to secure a unity and\r\nclearness which should render graft, unfairness and avoidable economic\r\nloss impossible, and be replaced with a code of fair, intelligent and\r\nforceful laws, which would not only permit the advancement of the\r\nshellfish industry through the individual efforts of the progressive\r\nshellfishermen, but also protect the rights of the general public.\r\n\r\n_C._ The majority of the shellfish laws of the State are enacted by\r\nthe individual towns. In 1880 the State first officially granted\r\nto each town the exclusive right to control and regulate its own\r\nshellfisheries, as provided under section 68 of chapter 91 of the\r\nPublic Statutes. This was slightly modified by the Acts of 1889 and\r\n1892 to read as follows (now section 85 of chapter 91 of the Revised\r\nLaws):--\r\n\r\n    SECTION 85. The mayor and aldermen of cities and the selectmen\r\n    of towns, if so instructed by their cities and towns, may,\r\n    except as provided in the two preceding sections, control,\r\n    regulate or prohibit the taking of eels, clams, quahaugs and\r\n    scallops within the same; and may grant permits prescribing the\r\n    times and methods of taking eels and such shellfish within such\r\n    cities and towns and make such other regulations in regard to\r\n    said fisheries as they may deem expedient. But an inhabitant of\r\n    the commonwealth, without such permit, may take eels and the\r\n    shellfish above-named for his own family use from the waters\r\n    of his own or any other city or town, and may take from the\r\n    waters of his own city or town any of such shellfish for bait,\r\n    not exceeding three bushels, including shells, in any one day,\r\n    subject to the general rules of the mayor and aldermen and\r\n    selectmen, respectively, as to the times and methods of taking\r\n    such fish. The provisions of this section shall not authorize\r\n    the taking of fish in violation of the provisions of sections\r\n    forty-four and forty-five. Whoever takes any eels or any of\r\n    said shellfish without such permit, and in violation of the\r\n    provisions of this section, shall forfeit not less than three\r\n    nor more than fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nResponsibility has thus been transferred from the State to the towns,\r\nand they alone, through their incompetence and neglect, are to blame\r\nfor the decline of the shellfisheries. The town laws are miniature\r\ncopies of the worst features of the State laws. While a few towns have\r\nsucceeded in enacting fairly good laws, the majority have either passed\r\nno shellfish regulations at all, or made matters worse by unintelligent\r\nand harmful laws. It is time that a unified system of competent by-laws\r\nwere enacted and enforced in every town.\r\n\r\nThe ill-advised features which characterize the present town laws are\r\nnumerous, and are best considered under the following headings:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Unintelligent Laws._--One of the worst features of our town\r\nshellfish laws is their extreme unfitness. Numerous laws which are\r\nabsolutely useless for the regulation and improvement of these\r\nindustries have been made by towns, through men who knew nothing\r\nabout the shellfisheries. These laws were made without any regard\r\nfor the practical or biological conditions underlying the shellfish\r\nindustry. It is to be expected that laws from such a source would\r\noften be ill-advised and unintelligent, but under the present system\r\nit cannot be avoided. Until sufficient knowledge of the habits and\r\ngrowth of shellfish is acquired by the authorities of State and town,\r\nMassachusetts can never expect to have intelligent and profitable\r\nshellfish laws. While the majority of these unintelligent laws do no\r\nharm, there are some that work hardship to the fishermen and are an\r\ninjury to the shellfisheries.\r\n\r\n(2) _Unfairness; Town Politics._--Town politics offers many chances\r\nfor unscrupulous discrimination in the shellfish laws. Here we find\r\none class of fishermen benefiting by legislation at the expense of the\r\nother, as in the case of the quahaugers _v._ oystermen. In one town\r\nthe oystermen will have the upper hand; in another, the quahaugers. In\r\nevery case there is unfair discrimination, and a resultant financial\r\nloss to both parties. The waters of Massachusetts are large enough for\r\nboth industries, and every man should have a \"square deal,\" which is\r\nfrequently lacking under the present régime.\r\n\r\nBesides party discrimination, there is discrimination against\r\ncertain individuals, as illustrated in giving oyster grants. Town\r\npolitics plays a distressing part here. Favoritism is repeatedly\r\nshown, and unfairness results. All this shows the unpopularity and\r\nimpracticability of such regulations and the method of making them.\r\n\r\n(3) _Present Chaotic State._--The present town laws are in a chaotic\r\ncondition, which it is almost impossible to simplify. No one knows the\r\nlaws, there is merely a vague impression that such have existed. Even\r\nthe selectmen themselves, often new to the office and unacquainted with\r\nthe shellfisheries, know little about the accumulated shellfish laws\r\nof the past years, and find it impossible to comprehend them. The only\r\nremedy is to wipe out all the old and replace them with unified new\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n(4) _Unsystematic Laws._--The present laws are unsystematized.\r\nEach town has its own methods, good and bad, and the result is a\r\nheterogeneous mixture. Often there are two or three laws where one\r\nwould definitely serve. To do absolute justice there should be a\r\ndefinite system, with laws elastic enough to satisfy the needs of all.\r\n\r\n(5) _Nonenforcement._--The worst feature of allowing town control of\r\nthe shellfisheries is the nonenforcement of the laws already passed.\r\nWe find in many towns that good by-laws have been made, but from\r\ninattention and lack of money these have never been enforced and have\r\nbecome practically nonexistent. The 1½-inch quahaug law of several\r\ntowns is an instance of this. In but one town in the State, Edgartown,\r\nis any effort made to enforce this excellent town by-law, although\r\nseveral of the other towns have passed the same. The proper enforcement\r\nof laws is as important as the making, as a law might as well not be\r\nmade if not properly enforced. The only way that this can be remedied\r\nis either to take the control completely out of the hands of the town,\r\nor else have a supervisory body which would force the town to look\r\nafter violators.\r\n\r\nBesides the town by-laws there are other evils which result from the\r\npresent system of town control.\r\n\r\nII. _Lack of Protection in Oyster Industry._--In no case is the\r\nmanagement by towns more inefficient and confusing than in the case of\r\nthe oyster industry. As this subject will be taken up in the oyster\r\nreport which follows, it is only necessary here to state that there\r\nis great need of a proper survey of grants, fair laws, systematic\r\nmethods, etc. Protection is necessary for the success of any industry,\r\nand is especially needed for the oyster industry. The oyster industry\r\nof Massachusetts will never become important until adequate protection\r\nis guaranteed to the planters. Under the present system, uncertainty\r\nrather than protection is the result.\r\n\r\nIII. _Town Jealousy._--The evil of town jealousy, whereby one town\r\nforbids its shellfisheries to the inhabitant of neighboring towns, is\r\nto-day an important factor. It is fair that a town which improves its\r\nown shellfisheries should not be interfered with by a town which has\r\nallowed its shellfisheries to decline. While this is true perhaps of\r\nthe clam, quahaug and oyster, it does not hold true of the scallop. The\r\nresult of this close-fisted policy has resulted in the past in a great\r\nloss in the scallop industry. The town law in regard to scallops is all\r\nwrong. The scallop fisheries should be open to all the State, and no\r\none town should \"hog the fishing,\" and leave thousands of bushels to\r\ndie from their dog-in-the-manger attitude.\r\n\r\nIV. _Sectional Jealousy._--Another evil, which in the past has been\r\nprominent, but is becoming less and less as the years go by, is the\r\njealousy of the north shore _v._ the south shore, Cape Cod _v._ Cape\r\nAnn. In the past this has been a stumbling block against any advance,\r\nas any plan initiated on the south shore would be opposed from sheer\r\nprejudice by the north shore representatives, and _vice versa_. The\r\ncry of \"entering wedge\" has been raised again and again whenever any\r\nbill was introduced for the good of the shellfisheries by either party.\r\nMerely for political reasons good legislation has been defeated.\r\nHowever, the last few years have shown a decided change. The jealous\r\nfeeling has in a large measure subsided; the shellfisheries need\r\nintelligent consideration, and all parties realize that united effort\r\nis necessary to insure the future of these industries.\r\n\r\nV. _Quahaugers_ v. _Oystermen_.--On the south shore the worst evil\r\nwhich at present exists is the interclass rivalry between the\r\nquahaugers and oystermen. This has caused much harm to both parties,\r\nthrough expensive lawsuits, economic loss, uncertainty of a livelihood,\r\nas well as retarding the proper development of both industries.\r\n\r\nVI. _Waste of Competition._--At the present day the utilization of\r\nwaste products in all industries is becoming more and more important.\r\nIn this age material which was considered useless by our forefathers is\r\nmade to play its part in the economic world. Through science industrial\r\nwaste of competition is being gradually reduced to a minimum, although\r\nin any business which deals with perishable commodities, such as fish,\r\nfruit, etc., there is bound to be a certain amount of loss.\r\n\r\nUnder the present system the shellfisheries suffer from the effects of\r\nwaste resulting from competition. Both the fisherman and the consumer\r\nfeel the effects of this, in different ways,--the fisherman through\r\npoor market returns, the consumer through poor service. As long as the\r\nshellfisheries are free to all, there is bound to be that scramble\r\nto get ahead of \"the other fellow,\" which not only results in the\r\ndestructive waste of the actual catch, but also causes a \"glutted\"\r\nmarket, which gives a low return to the fisherman. Thousands of dollars\r\nare thus lost each year by the fishermen, who are forced to keep\r\nshipping their shellfish, often to perish in the market, merely because\r\nthe present system invites ruthless competition. The fishermen in this\r\nrespect alone should be the first to desire a new system, which would\r\ngive to each a shellfish farm and the privilege of selecting his market.\r\n\r\nVII. At the present moment there are two evils which demand attention,\r\nand which can be lessened by the passage of two simple laws:--\r\n\r\n(1) During the past three years many thousands of bushels of quahaugs\r\nunder 1½ inches have been shipped out of the State, merely passing into\r\nthe hands of New York oystermen, who replanted, reaping in one year a\r\nharvest of at least five bushels to every one \"bedded.\" Through the\r\ninactivity of town control, the incentive to get ahead of the other\r\nfellow and the ignorance that they are wasting their own substance have\r\ncaused many quahaugers in the past to do this at many places.\r\n\r\nThe 1½-inch quahaug law has been for years a law for many towns\r\nin the State. It has been practically a dead letter in all but\r\nEdgartown, where it is enforced thoroughly. There should be a State law\r\nrestricting the size of the quahaugs taken.\r\n\r\n(2) The enforcement of a 1½-inch clam law, especially in the towns of\r\nFall River and Swansea, where the digging has reduced the clams to a\r\nsmall size, likewise deserves immediate attention.\r\n\r\nAll the present evils have each contributed their share toward the\r\nruin of the shellfisheries, and can be best summed up under one head,\r\n_i.e._, the abuse of nature. All the above evils have either directly\r\nor indirectly worked towards this end. This \"abuse of nature\" has\r\nresulted in several ways: (1) indiscriminate fishing, restricted by no\r\nlaws, augmented by unwise laws; (2) overfishing in certain localities\r\nuntil the supply is exhausted, as, among other instances, with the\r\nEssex clam flats and the natural oyster beds of the Weweantit River;\r\n(3) exploiting and wasting the natural resources, so that nature cannot\r\nrepair the inroads. Nature cannot cope with despoiling man,--man must\r\nassist nature.\r\n\r\nIn the past there has been much feeling, especially among the clammers\r\nof the north shore, against the Fish and Game Commission. It therefore\r\nis necessary to correct a mistaken impression, which has arisen among\r\nthe clammers, that \"the State is going to take the clam flats away from\r\nus.\" This idea is on the face of it absurd. The Massachusetts Fish\r\nand Game Commission is seeking only to have this question solved in\r\nsuch a manner as to yield the most satisfactory results for the public\r\ngood. At the present time it would be highly undesirable to take the\r\ncomplete control of the shellfisheries from any town, as long as that\r\ntown shows itself capable of regulating them wisely. At the present day\r\nbut few towns show any signs of this. What is necessary and desirable\r\nis to have an intelligent supervisory body, with power to compel each\r\ntown to take proper care of its shellfisheries. It is advisable that\r\nthere be a central power, co-operating with the town control in all\r\nmatters pertaining to the shellfisheries, whether it be regulations or\r\nthe restocking of barren areas. A board of arbitration, a committee\r\nof appeal for any grievance under the town control, and a commission\r\nthat would act for the interests of the whole State, are what is\r\nmost desirable at the present time. Such an arrangement would not be\r\nchanging radically the present system of town control, but it would\r\nfree it from its existing evils, place it on a firm and just basis, and\r\ngive the shellfisheries a chance for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHERMAN AND LAWS.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman of to-day, though nominally his own master, is in reality\r\nsubject to the demands of the market. To gain a living he is forced to\r\nwork in all kinds of weather, at cold, disagreeable work. Under the\r\npresent system he is oppressed by useless special town laws, which\r\nmerely increase his daily labors without benefiting the fishery in the\r\nleast. A few good laws only are necessary for the shellfisheries. It\r\nis time that the fisherman, one of the great factors in the commercial\r\nsupremacy of Massachusetts, should be freed from all unnecessary\r\nburdens through a new system of satisfactory laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMEDY.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the existing evils of the town shellfisheries,\r\nthe outlook is far from hopeless. To-day the shellfisheries of\r\nMassachusetts, owing to great natural resources, are as good or better\r\nthan those of any other coast States, and only await development\r\nunder proper methods to ensure a bright future. The Commissioners on\r\nFisheries and Game can only point the way of reform; the result lies\r\nin the hands of the intelligent voters of this Commonwealth, whose\r\naction decides the future success or failure of the shellfisheries. It\r\nshould be the object of every thinking voter, whether he be fisherman\r\nor consumer, to see that the right action be taken in regard to the\r\nshellfisheries.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the preceding pages of this report, the attempted remedy\r\nhas been based upon the false economic basis of attempting to check the\r\ndemand by prohibiting digging for certain periods (closed seasons),\r\nlimiting the amount to be legally dug by any one person, etc. It would\r\nbe quite as logical for a town or city to prohibit by by-laws the use\r\nor digging of potatoes or any other food crop, when the supply was\r\nshort, rather than to attempt to _increase_ the supply. An increasing\r\ndemand cannot be checked by any such ill-advised measures, but can be\r\nmet only by a corresponding increase in the natural production. The\r\nonly remedy that can be applied successfully is shellfish culture,\r\nwhich means the utilizing of thousands of acres of barren shore area\r\nfor the planting of farms which will furnish harvests of shellfish. In\r\nthis way the latent potentialities of nature, which it is criminal to\r\nneglect, will be utilized for the good of the entire population of the\r\nState. /#\r\n\r\nWe learn from the dictionaries that a farm is defined to be a tract\r\nof land under one control, devoted to agriculture, etc.; and that\r\nagriculture is the cultivation of the soil for food products or other\r\nuseful or valuable growths. All this is very familiar knowledge, as\r\napplied to the dry land; but that there may fairly be brought within\r\nthese definitions the operations of an industry in which lands covered\r\nby the salt waters of our bays and harbors are tilled, cultivated,\r\nraked, harrowed and planted with seedling bivalves, and harvests of a\r\nvaluable product garnered, constituting a superb food for the masses,\r\nis less familiar, and to many may seem quite astonishing. It is within\r\na comparatively few years that this unique style of farming has had its\r\ngrowth and development, until now many thousands of acres of land under\r\nwater have been carefully surveyed, and the boundaries marked by buoys\r\nand stakes.[6]\r\n\r\nTo bring the shellfisheries of Massachusetts to their maximum\r\nproduction will take years, but within five years the production can\r\nbe nearly doubled, if work in the right direction is begun at once.\r\nPatience will be required to overcome the obstacles which must be met,\r\nand the change must necessarily be gradual.\r\n\r\nEvery year the difficulties of reform increase. Owing to a steadily\r\nincreasing demand, the natural supply is becoming smaller, and\r\nconsequently the difficulty of increasing it becomes so much the\r\nharder. Soon the line of possibility will be crossed, and the\r\nshellfisheries will become an industry of the past. A few shellfish\r\nwill always remain, but as an important industry, the shellfisheries,\r\nif no remedy is applied, in twenty-five years will be commercially\r\nextinct. While there is still time, let action be taken.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of the barren shellfish areas, wise laws, good\r\nregulations and systematic methods of culture are necessary, in\r\norder to obtain the maximum production from these sea farms. The sea\r\nfarm possesses one advantage over the ordinary farm,--the soil never\r\nbecomes exhausted, as the shellfish derive their sustenance from the\r\nwater, utilizing indirectly the waste nitrates of the land. To do this\r\nit is necessary that shellfish culture be at once begun, either by\r\nindividuals or by towns.\r\n\r\nThree methods of shellfish culture offer ways of approach towards the\r\nutilization of the waste areas:--\r\n\r\n(1) To leave the matter wholly in the hands of the town. This is the\r\npoorest way, as has been shown in the past. Unless the town officials\r\nwere well informed about the shellfisheries, it would be an absurd\r\nfarce to entrust the future of this important industry wholly in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n(2) Place all power with the State, instead of with the town. Have\r\na unified and simplified system, whereby shellfish farms and grants\r\ncan be leased by the individuals. This plan, much better than the\r\nfirst, and possibly the final solution, is, however, not practical of\r\napplication to the existing conditions. Later, when these conditions\r\nare removed, it may prove the best solution of the problem.\r\n\r\n(3) The present system of town control to remain. The appointment of\r\nthe Fish and Game Commission, or a similar commission, to have complete\r\nadvisory power over the towns, and power to force each town to properly\r\nprotect its shellfish. A State law would be passed, legalizing grants\r\nto individuals and dividing the flats into two equal parts,--public\r\nand private. The leasing of grants would be in the hands of the town\r\nauthorities, but subject to appeal for any grievance to the Fish and\r\nGame Commission.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter relating to each shellfish will be given the practical\r\nmethods of cultivation for reclaiming the waste areas. These methods\r\nhave been proved by the experimental work of this commission,\r\nthe results of which may be published in a subsequent scientific\r\nreport upon the shellfish. The commission has definitely shown that\r\nshellfish culture in Massachusetts is a possibility, and, moreover, a\r\nremunerative possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO WOULD BENEFIT?\r\n\r\n(1) Under the proposed system of practical shellfish culture, many\r\nclasses of people would be benefited. The person who would be primarily\r\nbenefited is the fisherman. In the following ways the condition of\r\nthe industrious fisherman would be bettered: (_a_) his work would be\r\nsteady, not uncertain; (_b_) he would know his exact annual income, and\r\ncould govern his living expenses accordingly; (_c_) he would receive\r\nmore money, with less hardship; (_d_) he would ensure steady market\r\nreturns, which under the present system are very uncertain; (e) he\r\nwould be his own master, and not forced to work for poor pay, under the\r\nstress of wasteful competition.\r\n\r\n(2) The shellfisheries are not for any particular class, but should\r\nbenefit all, and any improvement in the industry affects all people. A\r\nsecond class would also be benefited by an increase in the shellfish\r\nindustries. This class can be divided into two groups: (_a_) those\r\ndirectly influenced; (_b_) those indirectly. In the first group are\r\nthe middlemen,--dealers. By an increased trade, more firms enter the\r\nbusiness, more men are hired, etc. Comprising the second group are\r\nteamsters, coopers, shop owners, sailors, transportation lines,--an\r\nindefinite list, which would be indirectly benefited by an increase in\r\nthe shellfish industry.\r\n\r\n(3) Thirdly, the consumer would receive the benefit of improved quality\r\nof goods, reasonable prices, etc. Through increased transportation\r\nfacilities the inland consumer would have the pleasure of partaking of\r\nsea food, and what were once the luxuries of the rich could be had by\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL.\r\n\r\nCapital is needed for the best success of any business. In a broad\r\nsense, the tools, implements, etc., of the shellfisherman are capital.\r\nIn the future, if the shellfisheries are to become a great industry,\r\nmoney as working capital is indispensable. Blind objection to the\r\nemployment of capital on the part of the fishermen works against the\r\nbest interests of the shellfisheries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLFISH MONOPOLY.\r\n\r\nFor years the fishermen have feared that the shellfisheries would\r\nfall into the hands of a few companies or trusts, and the individual\r\nfisherman thereby lose his independence. As the present age tends\r\ntoward the formation of monopolies in all business, the fears of the\r\nfishermen are not altogether groundless in this respect; nevertheless,\r\nwhile there are certain chances of monopoly in the shellfisheries,\r\nthese chances are very small. In the first place, a monopoly of a raw\r\nedible product, such as shellfish, is hardly possible. Never can it\r\nbe possible for any one company to control all or the majority of a\r\nshellfish supply, which possesses unlimited possibilities of expansion.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are but two ways in which a monopoly of the\r\nshellfisheries can be obtained: one is the control of the market by\r\nbuying up all the shellfish,--a thing far easier under the present\r\nconditions; the other, by buying through contract the rights of the\r\nindividual planters. The success of such an enterprise would depend\r\nwholly upon the personnel of the shellfishermen, and such a result\r\ncould never become possible if each shellfisherman would refuse to sell\r\nhis rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThis survey has shown (1) that the shellfisheries have declined (an\r\nestablished fact); (2) that the causes of the decline are overfishing\r\nand unwise laws; (3) that the remedy is, not to check the demand,\r\nas has been previously attempted, but to increase the production\r\nby the utilization of vast areas of barren flats, which have been\r\nexperimentally proved capable of yielding a great harvest; (4) that the\r\npresent chaotic laws render this impossible; (5) that there is a need\r\nof reform, or else the shellfisheries will soon disappear; (6) that the\r\nfirst step is the removal of these laws to permit the application of\r\nproper cultural methods.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Gulf Biologic Station, Cameron, La., Bulletin No. 3, 1905.\r\n\r\n[2] Returns of Massachusetts Department of Fisheries and Game.\r\n\r\n[3] United States Fish Commission Pamphlet, 1898.\r\n\r\n[4] New York Shellfish Report, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[5] Report on the Shellfisheries, pp. 33-35.\r\n\r\n[6] Forest, Fish and Game Commission Bulletin, Shellfish Culture in New\r\nYork, 1905. By B. Frank Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUAHAUG (_Venus mercenaria_).\r\n\r\n\r\nInhabiting common waters with the scallop, the northern range of the\r\nquahaug (the hard-shell clam or \"little neck\") in Massachusetts is\r\nPlymouth. Commercially it is found both on the north and south side\r\nof Cape Cod and in Buzzards Bay, the principal fisheries being at\r\nWellfleet, Orleans, Edgartown, Nantucket and in Buzzards Bay.\r\n\r\nThe quahaug, while essentially a southern and warm-water form, being\r\nfound in the United States along the Atlantic seacoast as far south\r\nas the Gulf of Mexico, practically reaches its northern range in\r\nMassachusetts. In a few sheltered bays on the Maine coast quahaugs are\r\nsometimes found, but in small quantities. However, at Prince Edward\r\nIsland there is said to be an abundance.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast of Massachusetts north of Boston very few quahaugs\r\nare found, although they were formerly taken near Salem. The black\r\nquahaug (_Cyprina islandica_), so called from its dark epidermis, is\r\noften caught in the trawls, but this is a deep-sea form, and by no\r\nmeans a true quahaug. In Essex and Ipswich rivers and on Plum Island\r\nexperimental beds have shown that quahaugs grow in these waters, but\r\nno spawn has yet been noticed, though ripe eggs were developed in the\r\nplanted quahaugs. Owing to the swift currents, which carry the spawn\r\nperhaps for miles, it is impossible to determine accurately whether any\r\nset has taken place.\r\n\r\nDuring the past three years, as outlined by chapter 78, Resolves\r\nof 1905, the Fish and Game Commission has conducted a series of\r\nexperiments upon the quahaug, designated to furnish sufficient data\r\nconcerning the growth of this mollusk under a variety of conditions, to\r\ndemonstrate the possibilities and value of practical quahaug farming.\r\nThe results of these investigations upon the life, habits and culture\r\nof the quahaug are to be published in a later scientific report. It is\r\nnecessary here to say that all statements in this report concerning\r\nthe growth and culture of quahaugs have been proved by experiments,\r\nthe results of which are on file at the office of the department of\r\nfisheries and game.\r\n\r\nIt is the object of this report to present both to the fishermen and\r\nconsumers (1) actual statistical figures of the industry of the State\r\nfor 1907; (2) a biological survey of the quahauging areas, outlined\r\nby maps and descriptions; (3) a description of the industry. This\r\nsurvey should furnish a basis for determining any decline or advance\r\nin the quahaug industry of the future, as well as affording comparison\r\nwith the United States Fish Commission survey of 1879, made by Ernest\r\nIngersoll.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, situated at the northern limit of the quahaug industry\r\nof the United States, is handicapped in comparison with other States,\r\nas only the southern waters of the State are given to this industry.\r\nNevertheless, though possessing only a partial industry, Massachusetts\r\nranks the fourth State in quahaug production, according to the 1906\r\nreport of the United States Fish Commission.\r\n\r\nThe same natural conditions which suit so well the shallow-water\r\nscallop are also adapted to the growth of the quahaug. In nearly\r\nall the sheltered bays, inlets and rivers of the southern coast\r\nof Massachusetts the quahaug can be found in varying abundance.\r\nTechnically, there is more territory which admits the possibility of\r\nquahaug growth than of any other shellfish. The bathymetric range of\r\nthe quahaug is extensive, as the quahaug is raked in all depths of\r\nwater up to 50 feet. In spite of the vast territory nature has provided\r\nfor the quahaug in the waters of Massachusetts, the commercial fishery\r\nis found only in small parts of this large area. Scattered quahaugs\r\nare found over the rest of the area, but in paying quantities only in\r\nlimited places.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of developing this great natural tract of quahaug\r\nground are especially alluring,--far more so than any of the other\r\nshellfisheries. The quahaug has a greater area, greater possible\r\nexpansion and a more profitable market. Nature has equipped southern\r\nMassachusetts with numerous bays with remarkable facilities for the\r\nproduction of quahaugs; it only remains for man to make the most of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n_Method of Work._--The method of work used in preparing this portion of\r\nthe report varied but little from that relating to the other shellfish,\r\nthough several features made it harder to obtain accurate information.\r\nThere is a more general obscurity about the history of the quahaug than\r\nabout any of the other shellfish, even though the quahaug industry is\r\ncommercially the youngest of all. This is due, perhaps, to the gradual\r\nrise of the industry through the discovery of new territory. The only\r\nhistorical record obtainable is E. Ingersoll's report on the quahaug,\r\nin 1879, in which he deals briefly with the industry in Massachusetts.\r\nTown records help but little in determining the history of the\r\nindustry, as only of late years have the towns required the taking of\r\npermits.\r\n\r\nIn making the biological survey, the difficulty arises of defining what\r\nconstitutes quahaug ground, since scattering quahaugs are found over\r\nvast territories, but only limited areas are commercially productive.\r\nThe estimates of the quahaugers, both historically and in regard to\r\nproduction and areas, are often erroneous and vary greatly. By the use\r\nof market reports, express shipments, estimates of dealers, estimates\r\nof several reliable quahaugers, and all methods at our command, the\r\nfacts of the industry were compiled and errors eliminated as far as\r\npossible. The home consumption is hard to determine, and is merely an\r\nestimate. The area of the quahaug territory was plotted on the map,\r\nand calculations made from the plots. Whenever personal inspection was\r\nnot possible, as in Falmouth, the estimates of several quahaugers were\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Results._\r\n\r\n1. _Is the Quahaug Fishery declining?_--The decline of the quahaug\r\nfishery is well recognized. Even the production figures, which,\r\nwhen stimulated by high prices, usually give a deceptive appearance\r\nof prosperity to a declining industry, since more men enter the\r\nfishery, show a decline in the last few years. When such a point is\r\nreached,--when, in spite of higher prices and more men, the annual\r\nproduction becomes less and less,--not many years will pass before the\r\nindustry will collapse completely.\r\n\r\nIncreased prices show either an increase in demand or a falling off of\r\nthe supply. Both are perhaps true of the quahaug industry. The demand,\r\nespecially for \"little necks,\" has been steadily on the increase, and a\r\nbroad inland market is gradually opening, since the quahaug is capable\r\nof long transportation without perishing. So the increased prices are\r\na sign of the diminution of the supply, as well as of an increased\r\ndemand, the indeterminable factor being what ratio the one bears to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe only way to determine accurately the decline in the natural supply\r\nis to compare the amount the average quahauger could dig ten or twenty\r\nyears ago with the amount dug to-day. Even this comparison is unfair,\r\nas the better rakes, improved methods, etc., of the present time tend\r\nto increase the daily yield of the quahauger.\r\n\r\nThis decline can best be shown by taking special localities:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Buzzards Bay._--The quahaug industry in Buzzards Bay has shown\r\na great decline in the past ten to twenty years, and the industry is\r\nnow at a low ebb, especially in the towns of Marion and Mattapoisett.\r\nWareham, Bourne and Fairhaven still manage to ship about 27,000 bushels\r\nannually, employing over 200 men; but this is hardly up to their former\r\nstandard. To-day at Wareham the daily catch per man is one-fifth of\r\nwhat it was twenty years ago; in 1887 a man could dig 5 bushels to a\r\ncatch of 1 bushel now. Buzzards Bay perhaps has shown the greatest\r\nquahaug decline.\r\n\r\n(2) _South Side of Cape Cod._--While not so marked a decline has taken\r\nplace as in Buzzards Bay, every quahauger agrees that the industry is\r\ngradually failing. In Bass River, at Hyannis, and in Chatham, there\r\nis a marked decrease, while at Cotuit and Osterville the industry has\r\nremained stationary.\r\n\r\n(3) _North Side of Cape Cod._--The best quahaug fishery of\r\nMassachusetts, except at Edgartown, is found on the north side of Cape\r\nCod, in the towns of Wellfleet, Eastham and Orleans. These three towns\r\ngive an annual yield of 75,000 bushels. Only about fifteen years old\r\ncommercially, the industry has passed its prime and is on the decline.\r\nThis decline is shown both by production figures and by the gradual\r\nmoving to deeper water. As the quahaugs were thinned out in shallow\r\nwater, the fishermen moved farther and farther out, using long rakes,\r\nuntil 60-foot rakes are now used at a depth of 50 feet. Probably the\r\n60-foot limit will never be exceeded, unless a method of dredging is\r\ndevised; and it will be only a question of years when the industry will\r\nbecome extinct.\r\n\r\n(4) _Nantucket._--The industry here has generally declined, though in\r\nthe last few years there has been a slight increase in production.\r\n\r\n(5) _Edgartown._--The quahaug industry at Edgartown has declined\r\nlittle, if any, while the fishery has been carried on for many years.\r\nThe natural resources have not been seriously impaired, owing to the\r\nefficient town management; and Edgartown can be congratulated on being\r\nthe only town in the State that can boast of a protected industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the quahaug industry has not openly shown the tendency to\r\ndecline that the soft clam has manifested in southern Massachusetts,\r\nthe danger is nevertheless very great, and the disaster would be far\r\nworse. The fishermen of Cape Cod realize that the clam industry has\r\npractically gone; but they are blind to the fact that a far more\r\nimportant one--the quahaug industry--is in as grave danger, and only\r\nwhen it is too late will they wake to a realization of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe clam industry on Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay will never assume the\r\nimportance it possesses on the north shore, owing to lack of extensive\r\nflats. Rather the quahaug industry is the main shellfish industry of\r\nthe south shore, as it is more valuable, more important, and capable of\r\nvast expansion. The development of the quahaug industry should bring\r\nmany hundred thousand dollars to Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nII. _Causes of the Decline._--The direct cause is overfishing. The\r\nquahaug is hardy, little harmed by climatic changes, and has but few\r\nnatural enemies. Man alone has caused the decline of the natural\r\nsupply. Not satisfied with taking the mediums and large quahaugs,\r\nbut spurred on by the high prices offered for the \"little neck,\"\r\nthe quahaug fisherman has cleaned up everything he can get, and the\r\nnatural supply has suffered greatly. If the market demands the capture\r\nof the \"little neck,\" it is necessary to leave the large quahaugs as\r\n\"spawners.\" At the present time, by the capture of both the industry is\r\nbeing ruined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Remedy._--_Quahaug Farming._\r\n\r\nThere is only _one way_ in which the present decline can be checked,\r\nand that is, to increase the natural supply by cultural methods to meet\r\nthe demands of the market. The only way to accomplish this increase\r\nis to plant and raise quahaugs,--in fact, have a system of _quahaug\r\nfarming_ for the whole south shore of Massachusetts. In considering\r\nquahaug farming, many questions naturally arise: (1) Is quahaug farming\r\nan established fact, or a mere theory? (2) Possibilities of quahaug\r\nfarming. (3) What is the growth of the quahaug, and how long does it\r\ntake to raise a crop? (4) What is the value of a quahaug farm? (5) What\r\nbenefits would the quahaug industry receive from such a system?\r\n\r\n(1) _Quahaug Farming an Established Fact,--not a Theory._--It is\r\nnot the object of this report to go into a scientific treatise upon\r\nexperiments in quahaug culture. For the past three years the Commission\r\non Fisheries and Game has been conducting experiments upon the growth\r\nand culture of quahaugs, the results of which will be published in a\r\nsubsequent report. These experiments have shown that quahaug farming is\r\nno theory, but an established fact, and that, if taken up, it will make\r\nthe quahaug fishery the most important shellfish industry of the State.\r\nThese experiments, consisting of small beds one one-thousandth of an\r\nacre in area, were located at different places along the coast. Various\r\nconditions in regard to food, current, tide, soil, etc., were tested.\r\nThe results from nearly every bed were excellent, and showed the ease\r\nof culture and the great profit which would result if larger areas were\r\nthus worked.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained from the experiments of the commission alone are\r\nsufficient to prove the practicability of quahaug farming, even if\r\nthere were no other proofs. As it is, there have been many tests made\r\nby the oystermen, both outside and inside the State. Some years ago the\r\noystermen near New York realized the possibilities of raising quahaugs\r\non their oyster grants, and to-day Massachusetts ships many barrels of\r\n\"seed\" quahaugs out of the State to these far-sighted business men,\r\nwho reap large returns by replanting these small \"little necks.\" The\r\nMassachusetts oystermen have not been slow to realize the large returns\r\nafforded by quahaug culture, and some have planted many bushels of the\r\n\"seed,\" thus turning their grants into partial quahaug farms. These\r\nmen have proved that this style of farming is practical, and that as a\r\nmoney-making proposition the quahaug is far ahead of the oyster.\r\n\r\nAs affairs exist to-day in Massachusetts, a few men alone have the\r\nprivilege of raising quahaugs, while the rest stand idle. Theoretically\r\nand legally, no one has the right to plant and raise quahaugs in the\r\nState; but practically and secretly it is done with great success.\r\nWho can blame the oysterman for raising quahaugs with his oysters, in\r\nview of the fast-declining quahaug industry? Rather by so doing he is\r\nhelping perpetuate the natural supply. The objection to this present\r\nsystem of secret quahaug farming is its unfairness. A few men are\r\nenjoying the privileges that many others should likewise enjoy. There\r\nis plenty of room, and quahaug farming might as well be carried on\r\nopenly, to the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nWhile the oystermen have made a move toward general quahaug farming,\r\nand have shown the great possibilities that this system possesses, the\r\nquahaugers have also exhibited a tendency in a similar direction. The\r\noriginators of the town law in Eastham, Orleans and Wellfleet, which\r\nprovides for the leasing of 5,625 square feet of flat for bedding the\r\ncatch, and thus makes possible the advantage of a favorable market,\r\nprobably did not imagine that this was the first great step on the part\r\nof the quahaugers towards shellfish farming. The success of this scheme\r\nhas here opened the eyes of the intelligent quahaugers to the even\r\nbetter possibilities of quahaug culture, and any well-devised scheme of\r\nshellfish farming will be favorably received.\r\n\r\nThe main impulse that makes people turn to quahaug culture is the\r\nsteady decline of the industry, especially during the last few years.\r\nIn the previous pages of this report there have been shown: (1) the\r\nactuality of the decline; (2) the causes of this decline. The proof\r\nof the decline is so generally apparent that it has created a popular\r\ndemand for a fair system of quahaug farming, to check the diminution of\r\nthe present supply.\r\n\r\n(2) _Possibilities of Quahaug Farming._--The quahaug has a wide range;\r\nit is found in all depths of water, from high tide line to sixty feet,\r\nand in various kinds of mud and sand bottom. This natural adaptability\r\ngives the quahaug a wider area than any other shellfish, as it will\r\nlive in nearly any bottom, although the rate of growth depends\r\nessentially upon its location in respect to current. This permits the\r\nutilization of vast areas which to-day are unproductive, and which\r\ncan all be made into profitable quahaug farms. Quahaugs will grow on\r\nthousands of acres of flats, such as the Common Flats of Chatham, if\r\nthey are planted. There are indefinite possibilities of expansion in\r\nquahaug farming through the reclamation of this unproductive sea bottom.\r\n\r\n(3) _Rate of Growth of Quahaug._--The rate of growth of the quahaug\r\nvaries greatly in regard to its location in respect to the current.\r\nThe quahaugs which have the better current or circulation of water\r\nshow the faster growth. The fastest growth recorded by the experiments\r\nof the Department on Fisheries and Game was a gain of 1 inch a year;\r\n_i.e._, 1½-inch quahaugs attained in one year a length of 2½ inches.\r\nThe average growth is between ½ and ¾ inch a year, or a yield of 3 to 5\r\nbushels for every bushel planted, or the return in one year of $4 for\r\nevery $1 invested. In the more favorable localities there would be the\r\nenormous gain of $8 for every dollar invested. All this can be done in\r\nsix months, as the quahaug grows only during the six summer months. The\r\nabove figures are taken from experiments which have been conducted on\r\nCape Cod, in Buzzards Bay and at Nantucket.\r\n\r\n(4) _Value of a Quahaug Farm._--An acre of \"little-neck\" quahaugs has a\r\nhigh market value. A conservative estimate of 10 per square foot gives\r\nthe yield in one year of 2½-inch quahaugs as 600 bushels per acre; This\r\nmeans that 120 bushels of 1¾-inch quahaugs were planted to the acre.\r\nThe price paid for the same would be $600, at the high price of $5 per\r\nbushel. The price received for the same, at $3 per bushel, would bring\r\n$1,800, or a gain of $3 for every $1 invested. This is a conservative\r\nestimate on all sides. Quahaugs could be planted two or three times\r\nas thick, seed might be purchased for less money, more money might be\r\nreceived for private shipments, and faster growth can be obtained. The\r\nonly labor necessary is gathering the quahaugs for market. The quahaug\r\nfarm requires no such care as the agricultural farm, and offers far\r\nmore profit.\r\n\r\n(5) _Advantage of Quahaug Culture._--The quahaug is the most\r\nremunerative of any of our shellfish. It possesses several advantages\r\nover the oyster: (1) it is hardier,--less influenced by climatic\r\nconditions; (2) it has fewer enemies, as it lies protected under the\r\nsand; (3) it possesses a market the whole year; (4) there is more money\r\nfor the planter in raising \"little necks\" than in raising oysters. If\r\noyster culture has succeeded in Massachusetts, there is no question\r\nthat, given a proper chance, quahaug culture can be put on a firm\r\nbasis, and made the leading shellfish industry of Massachusetts. The\r\nvalue of the present quahaug industry lies chiefly in the production of\r\n\"little necks.\" Under a cultural system of quahaug farms, this could be\r\nmade a specialty. Old quahaugs would be kept as \"seeders,\" and \"little\r\nnecks\" alone raised for the market. The advantage of furnishing \"little\r\nnecks\" of uniform size would lead to increased prices; steady customers\r\nwould be obtained and certainty of production guaranteed. All the\r\nadvantages lie with quahaug farming, as opposed to the present method\r\nof \"free-for-all\" digging.\r\n\r\nThe quahaug industry of the future, if put on a cultural basis, will\r\nnot only check the decline of a valuable industry, but will increase\r\nthe present production many fold. A far larger supply, work for more\r\nmen and better prices for the consumer will result.\r\n\r\n(6) _Spat Collecting._--The main obstacle that stands in the way\r\nof permanent quahaug culture is a lack of sufficient young \"seed\"\r\nquahaugs. While several heavy sets have been recorded, the \"seed\"\r\nquahaugs are never found in vast quantities, as are the young of the\r\nsoft clam (_Mya arenaria_). The set of quahaugs is usually scattering\r\nand slight. A method of spat collecting, _i.e._, catching the spawn and\r\nraising the small quahaugs, is alone necessary for the complete success\r\nof quahaug culture. While nothing of practical importance has yet been\r\nfound, indications are favorable that some means will be devised in the\r\nnext few years, and that quantities of young quahaugs can be raised.\r\nExperiments have already shown that as many as 75 can be caught per\r\nsquare foot in box spat collectors; but a more practical method than\r\nthis must be found to make the business profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Quahaug Industry._\r\n\r\n_Methods of Capture._--Several methods of taking quahaugs are in vogue\r\nin Massachusetts, some simple and primitive, others more advanced and\r\ncomplex, but all modifications of simple raking or digging. These\r\nmethods have arisen with the development of the industry, and record\r\nthe historical changes in the quahaug fishery, as each new fishery or\r\nseparate locality demands some modification of the usual methods.\r\n\r\n(1) \"_Treading._\"--The early settlers in Massachusetts quickly learned\r\nfrom the Indians the primitive method of \"treading\" quahaugs, which\r\nrequired no implements except the hands and feet. The \"treader\" catches\r\nthe quahaug by wading about in the water, feeling for them with his\r\ntoes in the soft mud, and then picking them up by hand. Nowhere in\r\nMassachusetts is it used as a method of commercial fishery.\r\n\r\n(2) _Tidal Flat Fishery._--Often quahaugs are found on the exposed\r\ntidal flats, where they can sometimes be taken by hand, but more\r\noften with ordinary clam hoes or short rakes. Owing to the scarcity\r\nof quahaugs between the tide lines, this method does not pay for\r\nmarket fishing, and is only resorted to by people who dig for home\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n(3) _Tonging._--In most parts of Buzzards Bay and in a few places\r\non Cape Cod quahaugs are taken with _oyster tongs_. This method is\r\napplicable only in water less than 12 feet deep, as the longest tongs\r\nmeasure but 16 feet. Four sizes of tongs are used, 8, 10, 12 and 16\r\nfeet in length. Tonging is carried on in the small coves and inlets,\r\nwhere there is little if any rough water. A muddy bottom is usually\r\npreferable, as a firm, hard soil increases the labor of manipulating\r\nthe tongs, which are used in the same manner as in tonging oysters.\r\n\r\n(4) _Raking._--The most universal method of taking quahaugs is with\r\nrakes. This method is used in every quahaug locality in Massachusetts,\r\neach town having its special kind of rake. Four main types of rakes can\r\nbe recognized:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Digger._--In some localities, chiefly in Buzzards Bay,\r\nthe ordinary potato digger or rake, having four or five long, thin\r\nprongs, is used. Usually it has a back of wire netting, which holds the\r\nquahaugs when caught by the prongs. As the digger has a short handle\r\nof 5 feet, it can be used only in shallow water, where the quahauger,\r\nwading in the water, turns out the quahaugs with this narrow rake. This\r\nmethod yields but a scanty return, and is more often used for home\r\nconsumption than for market.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Garden Rake._--The ordinary garden rake, equipped with a\r\nbasket back of wire netting, is in more general use in shallow water,\r\neither by wading or from a boat, as it has the advantage of being wider\r\nthan the potato digger.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Claw Rake._--This type of rake varies in size, width and\r\nlength of handle. It is used chiefly at Nantucket. The usual style has\r\na handle 6 feet long, while the iron part in the form of a claw or\r\ntalon is 10 inches wide, with prongs 1 inch apart. Heavier rakes with\r\nlonger handles are sometimes used for deep water, but for shallow water\r\nthe usual form is the short-claw rake.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Basket Rake._-The greater part of the quahaug production is\r\ntaken from deep water, with the basket rake. These rakes have handles\r\nrunning from 23 to 65 feet in length, according to the depth of water\r\nover the beds. Where the water is of various depths, several detachable\r\nhandles of various lengths are used. At the end of these long handles\r\nis a small cross-piece, similar to the cross-piece of a lawn mower;\r\nthis enables the quahauger to obtain a strong pull when raking. The\r\nhandles are made of strong wood, and are very thin and flexible, not\r\nexceeding 1½ inches in diameter. The price of these handles varies\r\naccording to the length, but the average price is about $2. As the long\r\nhandles break very easily, great care must be taken in raking.\r\n\r\nThree forms of the basket rake are used in Massachusetts. These\r\nrakes vary greatly in form and size, and it is merely a question of\r\nopinion which variety is the best, as all are made on the same general\r\nprinciple,--a curved, basket-shaped body, the bottom edge of which is\r\nset with thin steel teeth.\r\n\r\n_The Wellfleet and Chatham Rake._--This rake is perhaps the most\r\ngenerally used for all deep-water quahauging on Cape Cod, and finds\r\nfavor with all. It consists of an iron framework, forming a curved\r\nbowl, the under edge of which is set with thin steel teeth varying\r\nin length from 2 to 4 inches, though usually 2½-inch teeth are the\r\nfavorite. Formerly these teeth were made of iron, but owing to the\r\nrapid wear it was found necessary to make them of steel. Over the bowl\r\nof this rake, which is strengthened by side and cross pieces of iron,\r\nis fitted a twine net, which, like the net of a scallop dredge, drags\r\nbehind the framework. An average rake has from 19 to 21 teeth, and\r\nweighs from 15 to 20 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Edgartown Basket Rake._--The basket rake used at Edgartown and\r\nNantucket is lighter and somewhat smaller than the Wellfleet rake. The\r\nwhole rake, except the teeth, is made of iron. No netting is required,\r\nas thin iron wires 1/3 inch apart encircle lengthwise the whole basket,\r\npreventing the escape of any marketable quahaug, and at the same time\r\nallowing the mud to wash out. This rake has 16 steel teeth, 1½ inches\r\nlong, fitted at intervals of 1 inch in the bottom scraping bar, which\r\nis 16 inches long; the depth of the basket is about 8 inches. Much\r\nshorter poles, not exceeding 30 feet in length, are used with this\r\nrake, and the whole rake is much lighter. The price of this rake is\r\n$7.50, while the poles cost $1.50.\r\n\r\nThe third form of basket rake is a cross between the basket and claw\r\nrakes. This rake is used both at Nantucket and on Cape Cod, but is not\r\nso popular as the other types. The basket is formed by the curve of\r\nthe prongs, which are held together by two long cross-bars at the top\r\nand bottom of the basket, while the ends are enclosed by short strips\r\nof iron. This rake exemplifies the transition stage between the claw\r\nand basket types, indicating that the basket form was derived from the\r\nformer. Handles 20 to 30 feet long are generally used with these rakes.\r\n\r\n_Shallow v. Deep Water Quahauging._--Two kinds of quahauging are found\r\nin Massachusetts,--the deep and the shallow water fisheries. This\r\narbitrary distinction also permits a division of localities in regard\r\nto the principal methods of fishing. Although in all localities there\r\nexists more or less shallow-water fishing, the main quahaug industry of\r\nseveral towns is the deep-water fishery. In all the Buzzards Bay towns\r\nexcept Fairhaven and New Bedford the shallow-water fishery prevails;\r\nthis is also true of the south side of Cape Cod. On the north side\r\nof Cape Cod the opposite is true, as the quahauging at Wellfleet,\r\nEastham, Orleans and Brewster is practically all deep-water fishing. At\r\nEdgartown and Nantucket, although there is considerable shallow-water\r\ndigging, the deep-water fishery is the more important.\r\n\r\nThe deep-water fishery is vastly more productive than the shallow-water\r\nindustry, furnishing annually 118,500 bushels, compared to 23,227\r\nbushels, or more than 5 times as much. The deep-water fishery, _i.e._,\r\nthe basket-rake fishery, is the main quahaug fishery of the State, and\r\neach year it is increasing, because of the opening of new beds. On the\r\nother hand, the shallow-water grounds are rapidly becoming barren from\r\noverfishing.\r\n\r\nThe deep-water quahauging is harder work, requires considerable capital\r\nbut has fewer working days. Naturally the earnings from this fishery\r\nshould surpass those of the shallow-water industry. The deep-water\r\nquahauger averages from $5 to $8 for a working day, while the\r\nshallow-water fisherman earns only from $2 to $3 per day.\r\n\r\n_Deep-water Quahauging._--Both power and sail boats are used in\r\ndeep-water quahauging, though power is gradually replacing the old\r\nmethod of sailing, because of its increased efficiency and saving of\r\ntime. When the quahaug grounds are reached, the boat is anchored at\r\nboth bow and stern, one continuous rope connecting both anchors, which\r\nare from 500 to 600 feet apart, in such a way that the bow of the\r\nboat is always headed against the tide. A sufficient amount of slack\r\nis required for the proper handling of the boat, which can be moved\r\nalong this anchor \"road\" as on a cable, and a large territory raked.\r\nThe rake is lowered from the bow of the boat, the length of the handle\r\nbeing regulated by the depth of the water, and the teeth worked into\r\nthe sandy or muddy bottom. The quahauger then takes firm hold of the\r\ncross-piece at the end of the handle, and works the rake back to the\r\nstern of the boat, where it is hauled in and the contents dumped on the\r\nculling board or picked out of the net. In hauling in the net the rake\r\nis turned so that the opening is on top, and the mud and sand is washed\r\nout before it is taken on board. The long pole passes across the boat\r\nand extends into the water on the opposite side when the rake is hauled\r\nin. This process is repeated until the immediate locality becomes\r\nunprofitable, when the boat is shifted along the cable.\r\n\r\nThe usual time for quahauging is from half ebb to half flood tide, thus\r\navoiding the extra labor of high-water raking. Deep-water raking is\r\nespecially hard labor, and six hours constitute a good day's work.\r\n\r\n_Boats._--Nearly all kinds of boats are utilized in the quahaug\r\nfishery, and are of all values, from the $10 second-hand skiff to\r\nthe 38-foot power seine boat, which costs $1,500. The shallow-water\r\nindustry requires but little invested capital. Dories and skiffs are\r\nthe principal boats, costing from $10 to $25. Occasionally a sail\r\nor power boat may be used in this fishery. The deep-water industry\r\nrequires larger and stronger boats. These are either power or sail\r\nboats, often auxiliary \"cats,\" and their value runs anywhere from $150\r\nto $1,500. The average price for the sail boats is $250, while the\r\npower boats are assessed at $350. At Orleans several large power seine\r\nboats, valued at about $1,500, are used in the quahaug fishery. These\r\nseine boats are 30 to 38 feet over all, have low double cabins, and are\r\nrun by 8 to 12 horse-power gasolene engines. The ordinary power boats\r\nhave gasolene engines from 2 to 6 horse-power. In this way each method\r\nof quahauging has its own boats, which are adapted for its needs.\r\n\r\n_Dredging._--So far as known, dredging is never used in quahauging\r\nin Massachusetts, although it is sometimes used on sea-clam beds. It\r\nhas been tried, but without success, chiefly because of the uneven\r\nnature of the bottom. The invention of a suitable dredge is necessary,\r\nand there can be little doubt that in the future, if this difficulty\r\nis overcome, dredging will be used in the quahaug fishery. In 1879\r\nMr. Ernest Ingersoll reports in Rhode Island the use of a quahaug\r\ndredge similar in structure to our rake. Evidently this form was never\r\nespecially successful, possibly because these dredges could not be\r\ndragged by sail boats.\r\n\r\n_Outfit of a Quahauger._--The implements and boats used in quahauging\r\nhave already been mentioned. The outfit of the average quahauger in\r\neach fishery is here summarized:--\r\n\r\n                        _Deep-water Quahauging._\r\n\r\n  Boat,                                          $300\r\n  2 rakes,                                         20\r\n  3 poles,                                          6\r\n                                                -----\r\n                                                 $326\r\n\r\n                      _Shallow-water Quahauging._\r\n\r\n  Boat,                                           $20\r\n  Tongs or rakes,                                   3\r\n  Baskets,                                          2\r\n                                                -----\r\n                                                  $25\r\n\r\n_Season._--The quahaug fishery is essentially a summer fishery, and\r\nlittle if any is done during the winter. The season in Massachusetts\r\nlasts for seven months, usually starting the last of March or the\r\nfirst of April, and ending about the first of November. The opening of\r\nthe spring season varies several weeks, owing to the severity of the\r\nweather; and the same is true of the closing of the season.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the Buzzards Bay industry, where digging is done in the\r\nshallow waters of protected bays and coves, using short rakes and\r\ntongs, has a longer season than the quahaug industry of Cape Cod, where\r\nthe fishery is carried on in deep and open waters. With the former,\r\nthe cold work and hardship alone force the quahaugers to stop fishing,\r\na long time after storms and rough weather have brought the latter\r\nindustry to an end.\r\n\r\nThe actual working days of the deep-water quahauger number hardly over\r\n100 per season, while those of the shallow-water fishermen easily\r\noutnumber 150. The deep-water quahauger's daily earnings are two or\r\nthree times the daily wages of the shallow-water quahauger, but the\r\nadditional number of working days in part make up this difference.\r\n\r\nThe quahaug season can be divided arbitrarily into three parts: (1)\r\nspring; (2) summer; (3) fall. The spring season lasts from April 1 to\r\nJune 15, the summer season from June 15 to September 15, and the fall\r\nseason from September 15 to November 1. These seasons are marked by an\r\nincrease in the number of quahaugers in the spring and fall. The men\r\nwho do summer boating quahaug in the spring before the summer people\r\narrive, and in the fall after the summer season is over. The opening\r\nof the scallop season, in towns that are fortunate enough to possess\r\nboth industries, marks the closing of the quahaug season. These two\r\nindustries join so well, scalloping in the winter and quahauging in the\r\nsummer, that a shellfisherman has work practically all the year.\r\n\r\n_The Principal Markets._--The principal markets for the sale of\r\nMassachusetts quahaugs are Boston and New York. In 1879 the Boston\r\nmarket, according to Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, sold comparatively few. At\r\nthe present time the Boston market disposes of many thousand bushels\r\nannually, but nevertheless the greater part of the Massachusetts\r\nquahaugs are shipped to New York. This, again, is due to the better\r\nmarket prices offered by that city. Besides passing through these two\r\nmain channels, quahaugs are shipped direct from the coast dealers to\r\nvarious parts of the country, especially the middle west. This last\r\nmethod seems to be on the increase, and the future may see a large\r\nportion of the quahaug trade carried on by direct inland shipments.\r\n\r\n_Shipment._--Quahaugs are shipped either in second-hand sugar or flour\r\nbarrels or in bushel bags. The latter method is fast gaining popularity\r\nwith the quahaugers and dealers, owing to its cheapness, and is now\r\nsteadily used in some localities. When quahaugs are shipped in barrels,\r\nholes are made in the bottom and sides of the barrel, to allow free\r\ncirculation of air and to let the water out, while burlap is used\r\ninstead of wooden heads.\r\n\r\n\"_Culls._\"--Several culls are made for the market. These vary in number\r\nin different localities and with different firms, but essentially are\r\nmodifications of the three \"culls\" made by the quahaugers: (1) \"little\r\nnecks;\" (2) \"sharps;\" (3) \"blunts.\" The divisions made by the firm of\r\nA. D. Davis & Co. of Wellfleet are as follows: (1) \"little necks,\"\r\nsmall, 1½-2¼ inches; large, 2¼-3 inches; (2) medium \"sharps,\" 3-3¾\r\ninches; (3) large \"sharps,\" 3¾ inches up; (4) small \"blunts;\" (5) large\r\n\"blunts.\"\r\n\r\n_Price._--The prices received by the quahaugers are small, compared\r\nwith the retail prices. \"Little necks\" fetch from $2.50 to $4 per\r\nbushel, sharps and small blunts from $1.10 to $2, and large blunts from\r\n80 cents to $1.50, according to the season, fall and spring prices\r\nnecessarily being higher than in summer. The price depends wholly upon\r\nthe supply in the market, and varies greatly, although the \"little\r\nnecks\" are fairly constant, as the demand for these small quahaugs is\r\nvery great. To what excess the demand for \"little necks\" has reached\r\ncan best be illustrated by a comparison between the price of $3 paid to\r\nthe quahauger per bushel, and the actual price, $50, paid for the same\r\nby the consumer in the hotel restaurants.\r\n\r\n_Bedding Quahaugs for Market._--By town laws in Orleans, Eastham\r\nand Wellfleet, each quahauger may, upon application, secure from\r\nthe selectmen a license, giving him not more than 75 feet square of\r\ntidal flat upon which to bed his catch of quahaugs. While no positive\r\nprotection is guaranteed, public opinion recognizes the right of each\r\nman to his leased area, and this alone affords sufficient protection\r\nfor the success of this communal effort, which is the first step by\r\nthe people toward quahaug farming.\r\n\r\nThe quahauger needs only to spread his catch on the surface, and within\r\ntwo tides the quahaugs will have buried themselves in the sand. Here\r\nthey will remain, with no danger of moving away, as the quahaug moves\r\nbut little. The quahauger loses nothing by this replanting, as not only\r\ndo the quahaugs remain in a healthy condition, but even grow in their\r\nnew environment.\r\n\r\nThe result of this communal attempt at quahaug culture is beneficial.\r\nWhile the market price for \"little necks\" is almost always steady, the\r\nprice of the larger quahaugs fluctuates considerably, and the market\r\noften becomes \"glutted.\" This would naturally result in a severe loss\r\nto the quahauger if he were forced to keep shipping at a low price.\r\nAs it is, the fortunate quahauger who possesses such a grant merely\r\nreplants his daily catch until the market prices rise to their proper\r\nlevel. An additional advantage is gained by the quahauger, who at the\r\nend of the season has his grant well stocked, as higher prices are then\r\noffered. As many as 1,000 barrels are often held this way at the end of\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\n_Food Value._--See food value table in scallop report.\r\n\r\n_Uses._--Besides its many uses as a food, raw, cooked and canned, the\r\nquahaug is of little importance in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n(1) For bait the soft clam (_Mya arenaria_) is generally preferred, and\r\nbut few quahaugs are used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n(2) The shell was once prized by the Indians for their wampum; now it\r\nis occasionally used for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\n(3) Oystermen use it for cultch when they can get nothing better;\r\nthough more fragile shells are usually preferred, so that the masses of\r\noyster \"set\" can be easily broken apart.\r\n\r\n(4) Shell roads are occasionally made from quahaug shells. Possibly\r\nlime could be profitably obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History of Quahaug Industry in Massachusetts._\r\n\r\nSouth of Plymouth harbor quahaugs have always been plentiful along\r\nthe shores of Cape Cod, Buzzards Bay and the islands of Nantucket and\r\nMartha's Vineyard. Frequent shell heaps show that the Indians were\r\naccustomed to use this mollusk as a food, and even indulged in an\r\noccasional clam bake. Colonial records show us that the early colonists\r\nwere not slow in learning to \"tread out\" this mollusk from the mud\r\nflats. The shells of the quahaug were much prized by the Indians for\r\nwampum beads, because of their purplish color.\r\n\r\nAlthough reckoned inferior by many to the soft clam (_Mya arenaria_),\r\nthe quahaug was dug for home consumption for years in Massachusetts,\r\nand but little attempt was made to put it on the market. The\r\ncommercial quahaug fishery started on Cape Cod, about the first of the\r\nnineteenth century, growing in extent until about 1860. From 1860\r\nto 1890 the production remained about constant. The production in\r\n1879 for Massachusetts, as given by A. Howard Clark, totaled 11,050\r\nbushels, valued at $5,525. It is only in the last fifteen to twenty\r\nyears that the actual development of the quahaug fishery has taken\r\nplace. The present production of Massachusetts is 144,044 bushels,\r\nvalued at $194,687. To the popular demand for the \"little neck\" can\r\nbe attributed the rapid development of the quahaug industry during\r\nthe last ten years. This development has furnished employment for\r\nhundreds of men, and has given the quahaug an important value as a sea\r\nfood. What it will lead to is easily seen. The maximum production was\r\npassed a few years ago, constant overfishing caused by an excessive\r\ndemand is destroying the natural supply, and there will in a few years\r\nbe practically no commercial fishery, unless measures are taken to\r\nincrease the natural supply. Quahaug farming offers the best solution\r\nat the present time, and gives promise of permanent success.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics, taken from the United States Fish Commission\r\nreports, show the rapidity of the development of the quahaug fishery:--\r\n\r\n  =============+============+===========+================\r\n      DATE.    |  Bushels.  |   Value.  | Price (Cents).\r\n  -------------+------------+-----------+----------------\r\n  1879,        |    11,050  |   $5,525  |      50.0\r\n  1887,        |    35,540  |   21,363  |      60.0\r\n  1888,        |    26,165  |   14,822  |      56.5\r\n  1898,        |    63,817  |   50,724  |      79.5\r\n  1902,        |   106,818  |  131,139  |     124.0\r\n  1905,        |   166,526  |  288,987  |     155.0\r\n  =============+============+===========+================\r\n\r\nNot only has there been an increase in production, but also an increase\r\nin price, as can be seen from the above table, which shows that the\r\nprice has more than doubled between 1888 and 1902. This increase in\r\nprice has alone supported a declining fishery in many towns, making it\r\nstill profitable for quahaugers to keep in the business, in spite of\r\na much smaller catch. The advance in price is due both to the natural\r\nrise in the value of food products during the past twenty-five years\r\nand also to the popular demand for the \"little neck,\" or small quahaug.\r\n\r\n_State Laws._--There are no State laws governing the quahaug fishery,\r\nexcept the regulations of the State Board of Health in regard to sewage\r\npollution in Acushnet River and Boston Harbor.\r\n\r\n_Town Laws._--Regulation of the quahaug fishery was given to each town\r\nby the State under the general shellfish act of 1880; the industry is\r\ntherefore entirely governed under the by-laws of the town.\r\n\r\nAn interesting comparison can be made between the quahaug regulations\r\nof the different towns. Good, useless and harmful laws exist side by\r\nside. One town will pass excellent regulations, and enforce them;\r\nanother town will make the same, but never trouble to see that they\r\nare observed. Edgartown enforces the 1½-inch quahaug law; Orleans,\r\nEastham and Wellfleet have the same law, but fail to enforce it. Many\r\ntowns allow the small seed quahaugs to be caught and shipped out of the\r\nState, thus losing $4 to every $1 gained. These towns refuse to make\r\nany regulation, such as a simple size limit, which would remedy this\r\nmatter, and have no thought for the future of their quahaug industry.\r\nAll that can be said is that the quahaug laws are the best of the town\r\nshellfish regulations, and that is but faint praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Statistics of the Quahaug Fishery._\r\n\r\nIn the following table the towns are arranged in alphabetical order,\r\nand the list includes only those towns which now possess a commercial\r\nquahaug fishery. In giving the number of men, both transient and\r\nregular quahaugers are included. In estimating the capital invested,\r\nthe boats, implements, shanties and gear of the quahauger are alone\r\nconsidered, and personal apparel, such as oilskins, boots, etc., are\r\nnot taken into account. The value of the production for each town is\r\nbased upon what the quahaugers receive for their quahaugs, and not the\r\nprice they bring in the market. The area of quahaug territory given for\r\neach town includes all ground where quahaugs are found, both thick beds\r\nand scattering quahaugs.\r\n\r\n  =============+======+=========+======+=======+================+======+=======\r\n      TOWN.    |Number| Capital |Number|Number |1907 PRODUCTION.|      | Value\r\n               |  of  |invested.| of   |  of   +--------+-------+ Area |  of\r\n               | Men. |         |Boats.|Dories |Bushels.| Value.|  in  | Yield\r\n               |      |         |      | and   |        |       |Acres.|  per\r\n               |      |         |      |Skiffs.|        |       |      | Acre.\r\n  -------------+------+---------+------+-------+--------+-------+------+-------\r\n  Barnstable,  |   25 |    $850 |    - |    25 |   2,500| $3,700|   950| $3.95\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Bourne,      |   46 |   1,000 |    - |    46 |   5,400|  8,400| 2,500|  3.36\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Chatham,     |   50 |   5,750 |   25 |    25 |   6,700| 10,000| 2,000|  5.00\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Dennis,      |   15 |     150 |    - |    10 |     500|    950|   200|  4.75\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Eastham,     |   25 |   8,000 |   12 |     - |  10,000| 11,500| 4,000|  2.87\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Edgartown,   |   70 |  12,000 |   42 |    18 |  20,000| 32,000| 1,800| 17.77\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Fairhaven,   |  115 |   5,000 |   11 |   100 |  15,000| 16,500| 3,000|  5.50\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Falmouth,    |    - |       - |    - |     - |     100|    115|   400|   .29\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Harwich,     |    7 |     200 |    - |     7 |   1,500|  2,550|   100| 25.50\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Marion,      |   19 |     250 |    - |    19 |     800|  1,500|   400|  3.75\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Mashpee,     |    7 |      70 |    - |     5 |     250|    285|   400|   .71\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Mattapoisett,|   28 |     500 |    - |    28 |     800|  1,500|   750|  2.00\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Nantucket,   |   48 |   6,750 |   30 |    10 |   6,294|  8,487| 5,290|  1.60\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Orleans,     |   75 |  25,000 |   30 |    25 |  33,000| 41,350| 1,500| 27.56\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Wareham,     |   50 |   1,000 |    - |    50 |   6,000| 10,500| 1,300|  8.08\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Wellfleet,   |  145 |  27,500 |  100 |     - |  33,000| 41,350| 2,500| 16.54\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |\r\n  Yarmouth,    |   20 |     240 |    - |    10 |   2,200|  4,000| 1,000|  4.00\r\n  -------------+------+---------+------+-------+--------+-------+------+-------\r\n               |      |         |      |       |        |       |      |Average\r\n  Totals,      |  745 |  94,260 |  250 |   378 | 144,044|194,687|28,090| $6.93\r\n  =============+======+=========+======+=======+========+=======+======+=======\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barnstable._\r\n\r\nBarnstable, with its extensive bays both on the north or bay side and\r\non the south or Vineyard Sound side, offers great possibilities for\r\nquahaug production. Although the quahaug ranks, in productive value,\r\nthe third shellfish industry of Barnstable, the natural resources\r\npermit an expansion under cultural methods which would place the\r\nquahaug ahead of the oyster, which at the present time is the leading\r\nshellfish industry of the town.\r\n\r\nIn Barnstable harbor, on the north coast of the town, a few quahaugs\r\nare found scattered in isolated patches. (See Map No. 9.) These are\r\nrelatively of small importance commercially, and no regular fishery is\r\ncarried on. In the future the vast barren flats of this harbor may be\r\nmade productive of quahaugs as well as clams, although at present the\r\ntotal area of quahaug grounds is hardly 5 acres.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the quahaug industry of Barnstable is conducted\r\non the south shore of the township, which is especially adapted, with\r\nits coves and inlets, for the successful growth of this shellfish. The\r\nprincipal fishery is in Cotuit harbor and West Bay, and is chiefly\r\nshared by the villages of Osterville, Marston's Mills and Cotuit, which\r\nlie on the east, north and west sides, respectively, of the bay.\r\n\r\nWhile the greater part of Cotuit harbor is taken up by oyster grants,\r\nthere are certain parts, though limited in area, which are set aside\r\nfor quahauging. The principal area for quahauging is the flat which\r\nruns along Oyster Island. This was originally an oyster grant taken\r\nout by Wendell Nickerson, and thrown open to quahaugers to protect\r\nthe quahaug interests from the oyster planters. This territory, which\r\ncomprises 70 acres, is mostly hard sand. Directly west in the center of\r\nthe harbor lies a strip of 80 acres of mud and eel grass, where both\r\nquahaugs and scallops abound. The depth of water on quahauging grounds\r\nvaries from 1 to 14 feet.\r\n\r\nScattering quahaugs are found also in Osterville harbor, West Bay,\r\nPopponesset River and East Bay. This bottom is practically all sand,\r\nand comprises a total of 1,650 acres. This cannot all be considered\r\ngood quahaug ground, although quahaugs can occasionally be found.\r\n\r\nAt Hyannis the quahaug grounds are confined to Lewis Bay, where they\r\ncover an area of 800 acres. The quahaugs lie in scattered patches over\r\nthis area, but in no place is there especially good quahauging. The\r\nbottom is hard, usually sandy, with patches of eel grass, while the\r\naverage depth of water is hardly more than 6 feet.\r\n\r\nIn Osterville Bay about 20 men, in Lewis Bay about 5, using the same\r\nnumber of dories, make a business of quahauging in the summer months.\r\nThree styles of implements are used: (1) oyster tongs, varying from 8\r\nto 16 feet, according to the depth of water; (2) large basket rakes,\r\nwith 30-foot handles; (3) ordinary garden rakes, with wire basket, for\r\nshallow-water digging.\r\n\r\nAt Cotuit the quahaugs run one-third \"little necks,\" one-third mediums\r\nand one-third large. Here several men, using long-handled rakes, make\r\nfrom $3 to $5 per day in favorable weather. The markets are principally\r\nNew York and Boston, where the quahaugs are shipped, mostly in sacks,\r\nwhich is a cheaper and better way than shipment in barrels. Here the\r\nquahaug season lasts from April 1 to November 1, most of the work being\r\ndone in the summer, when the oyster business is at a standstill.\r\n\r\nThere are no town laws governing the quahaug fishery, other than\r\nforbidding a non-resident of the town the right of quahauging; and no\r\nlicenses are required.\r\n\r\nNo records of the history of the quahaug industry at Barnstable can be\r\nfound. A. Howard Clark in 1879 makes the following brief statement,\r\nwhich is the only record obtainable:--\r\n\r\n    Both soft clams and quahaugs are found in the harbor\r\n    [Osterville harbor], but no considerable fishing for them is\r\n    carried on.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),              950\r\n  Number of men,                                   25\r\n  Number of boats,                                  -\r\n  Value of boats,                                   -\r\n  Number of dories,                                25\r\n  Value of dories,                               $500\r\n  Value of implements,                           $350\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                    800\r\n      Value,                                   $2,000\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,700\r\n      Value,                                   $1,700\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  2,500\r\n      Value,                                   $3,700\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bourne._\r\n\r\nThe town of Bourne was formerly included in the town of Sandwich, and\r\nmany old laws relating to shellfish, such as oyster regulation in\r\nBarlow River, were enacted by the town of Sandwich. Situated at the\r\nhead of Buzzards Bay, and separated from the adjacent town of Wareham\r\nby Cohasset Narrows, Bourne has many advantages for a profitable\r\nquahaug industry. It possesses nearly twice as much quahaug territory\r\nas Wareham, but, as most of this lies unproductive, has a smaller\r\nannual output. The territory includes over 2,500 acres of ground, most\r\nof which consists of flats of mud, sand and eel grass, covered with\r\nshallow water. It is very sparsely set with quahaugs. Outside the\r\noyster grants practically the entire stretch of coast from Buttermilk\r\nBay to Wings Neck is quahauging ground, as can be seen on Map No. 17.\r\nOther quahaug grounds lie between Basset's Island, Scraggy Neck and\r\nHandy's Point. It is our opinion that this large territory, which\r\nto-day yields on the average less than $3.50 per acre, in the future,\r\nunder cultivation, can be made to yield an average of $100 per acre,\r\nthereby bringing into the town of Bourne a yearly income of at least\r\n$250,000, and furnishing labor for hundreds of men.\r\n\r\nAbout 46 men are engaged in the quahaug fishery of Bourne, using the\r\nsame number of skiffs and dories, which represent approximately an\r\ninvestment of $875. The fishery lasts usually seven months during the\r\nsummer, April 1 to November 1, while the winter digging is of small\r\naccount. Practically all the digging is done in comparatively shallow\r\nwater, with short-handled rakes or tongs. Rather more than a third of\r\nthe quahaugs appear to be \"little necks,\" while the mediums constitute\r\none-tenth of the total catch. \"Blunts\" are of little consequence.\r\n\r\nThe selectmen issue permits for the taking of quahaugs and clams. In\r\n1906, 46 permits were issued, entitling the holder to 10 bushels of\r\nclams and 10 bushels of quahaugs per week.\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said concerning the history of the Bourne quahaug\r\nindustry, as no early records exist. Its development has been similar\r\nto that of the industries of the other Buzzards Bay towns. During the\r\nlast few years the Bourne fishery, unlike most of the towns on Buzzards\r\nBay, has shown signs of increasing. This is not due, however, to any\r\nincrease in the natural supply, but to the decline of the oyster\r\nindustry, which gives more opportunity to the quahaugers. The same\r\nantagonistic feeling that is prevalent in Wareham exists here between\r\nthe oystermen and quahaugers.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            2,500\r\n  Number of men,                                   46\r\n  Number of boats,                                  -\r\n  Value of boats,                                   -\r\n  Number of skiffs,                                46\r\n  Value of skiffs,                               $875\r\n  Value of implements,                           $125\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  2,000\r\n      Value,                                   $5,000\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  3,400\r\n      Value,                                   $3,400\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  5,400\r\n      Value,                                   $8,400\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chatham._\r\n\r\nChatham is favorably situated in regard to the quahaug fishery, as\r\nthis shellfish is found in the waters on the north and south sides of\r\nthe town. The grounds are extensive, covering about 2,000 acres, the\r\ngreater part of which consists of the vast area south of the town known\r\nas the \"Common Flats.\"\r\n\r\nThe quahauging grounds are in four localities: (1) Pleasant Bay; (2)\r\nMill Pond; (3) Stage Harbor; (4) Common Flats.\r\n\r\n(1) Part of the waters of Pleasant Bay belong to the town of Chatham.\r\nIn an arm of this bay, known as Crows Pond, the best Pleasant Bay\r\nfishery is carried on in water varying from 6 to 16 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n(2) An excellent \"little neck\" fishery is carried on in the upper part\r\nof the Mill Pond, in comparatively shallow water, comprising an area\r\nof 3 acres. On these bars in 1905 there was a very heavy set of small\r\nquahaugs, which were rapidly taken up before they had a chance to\r\nattain to a fair size.\r\n\r\n(3) Quahaugs are raked on the west side of Stage Harbor in 5 to 15 feet\r\nof water, in an area of 4 acres of muddy bottom.\r\n\r\n(4) The Common Flats comprise 1,700 acres, and are covered at low tide\r\nby a depth of only 1 to 2 feet of water. Quahaugs are found throughout\r\nthis territory in scattering quantities, but practically all is good\r\nquahaug ground except the shifting outer part of the flat. The soil\r\nvaries from a pure sand to a sandy mud, and in parts is thickly covered\r\nwith eel grass, which makes raking hard. This area offers one of the\r\nbest opportunities for successful quahaug planting in the State. The\r\narea is large, seed can be obtained easily and quahaugs grow well in\r\nthis locality. If it were not for the lack of protection, Chatham could\r\nestablish one of the best quahaug industries in the State by leasing\r\nout the Common Flats for planting purposes.\r\n\r\nQuahaugs are taken at Chatham only with rakes. In the deep water in\r\nCrows Pond and in Stage Harbor basket rakes are used; but in the\r\nshallow water on the Common Flats and in the Mill Pond the usual\r\nimplement is an ordinary garden rake, with wire netting basket. Handles\r\nfrom 20 to 25 feet in length are used with the basket rakes.\r\n\r\nThe quahaug industry has existed in Chatham for the past twelve years.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            2,000\r\n  Number of men,                                   50\r\n  Number of boats,                                 25\r\n  Value of boats,                              $5,000\r\n  Number of dories,                                25\r\n  Value of dories,                               $350\r\n  Value of implements,                           $400\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  2,200\r\n      Value,                                   $5,500\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  4,500\r\n      Value,                                   $4,500\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  6,700\r\n      Value,                                  $10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dartmouth._\r\n\r\nThe quahaug industry of Dartmouth is of little consequence. In 1907,\r\n320 permits were granted, mostly to New Bedford fishermen for \"bait.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dennis._\r\n\r\nThe quahauging grounds of Dennis are practically all in Bass River,\r\nwhere Dennis has equal fishery rights with Yarmouth. The area of these\r\ngrounds is 200 acres, with a maximum depth of 6 feet of water over the\r\nbeds. The history of the industry is the same as that of Yarmouth, as\r\nthe two industries are closely associated, and a similar decline has\r\nresulted.

This\r\nquahauging territory comprises about 4,000 acres, which is open to the\r\nquahaugers of both Wellfleet and Orleans. While scattering quahaugs are\r\nfound over approximately all this territory, the fishery is conducted\r\nin only certain definite places.\r\n\r\nIn Nauset harbor on the east side during the season of 1906 numerous\r\nbeds of \"little necks,\" about the 1½-inch size, were discovered. It is\r\nthought that these came from the spawn of certain quahaugs which the\r\nlife savers were accustomed to bed in the harbor for their own use.\r\nThese quahaugs were torn up and scattered by the ice during a severe\r\nwinter, and in this way the nucleus of a new fishery was formed. Two\r\nmen who discovered the best of these beds cleared $60 in one week.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of the town 25 men commonly dig with long-handled\r\nrakes. These fishermen work at quahauging about 100 days in the year,\r\nand average from 5 to 6 bushels per day. Power boats are used for the\r\nmost part, although the boats are not so large or expensive as those\r\nof the Orleans fishermen, for the Eastham quahauger digs in the more\r\nsheltered waters of Wellfleet Bay.\r\n\r\nThe production for 1906 was 10,000 bushels, but this does not give the\r\ntrue yield of the Eastham flats, as the Wellfleet and Orleans fishermen\r\nrake to a great extent in Eastham waters, and so many more bushels are\r\nactually taken within the town limits.\r\n\r\nThe town laws of Eastham are the same as those of Wellfleet. (See\r\nWellfleet.) The history of the Eastham quahaug industry is so closely\r\nconnected with that of Orleans and Wellfleet that no additional\r\nfeatures require mention.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            4,000\r\n  Number of men,                                   25\r\n  Number of boats,                                 12\r\n  Value of boats,                              $7,375\r\n  Number of dories,                                 -\r\n  Value of dories,                                  -\r\n  Value of implements,                           $625\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,000\r\n      Value,                                   $2,500\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  9,000\r\n      Value,                                   $9,000\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 10,000\r\n      Value,                                  $11,500\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgartown._\r\n\r\nThe finest \"little neck\" fishery in Massachusetts is found in Katama\r\nBay, in the town of Edgartown. Two-fifths of the entire catch are\r\n\"little necks.\" The most productive grounds are situated in the lower\r\npart of Katama Bay, while quahaugs are also found in Edgartown harbor\r\nand in Cape Poge Pond, the total area of these localities comprising\r\n1,800 acres.\r\n\r\nThe fishing is mostly done from power dories or sail boats with basket\r\nrakes. Poles from 20 to 25 feet long are used, as the water over the\r\nbeds is less than 20 feet deep. Some quahaugs are taken in the shallow\r\nwater with small claw rakes. The catch is shipped to the New York and\r\nBoston markets.\r\n\r\nThe quahaug industry of Edgartown is the best-regulated shellfish\r\nindustry in Massachusetts. If excellent care had not been taken of\r\nthe \"little neck\" fishery of Katama Bay by enforcing a size limit\r\nof 1½ inches, through the employment of a special shellfish warden,\r\nthe quahaug fishery of Edgartown would have been ruined long ago by\r\nthe exportation of small \"seed\" quahaugs. To-day the number of small\r\nquahaugs which are returned to the water greatly exceeds the amount of\r\nmarketable quahaugs taken. This is the only case in Massachusetts where\r\nthe quahaug fishery, by careful regulations of the town, has maintained\r\nan undiminished supply. If other towns had taken similar care of their\r\nquahaug fisheries in the past, the general decline of the industry in\r\nthis State would never have become so serious.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the shellfish permit, which every Edgartown\r\nquahauger is required to take out, at the cost of $2, before he can\r\nrake quahaugs for market. Any man over sixty years old obtains his\r\npermit free. This permit should serve as a model for other towns.\r\n\r\n                           SHELLFISH PERMIT.\r\n\r\n              TOWN OF EDGARTOWN, SELECTMEN'S OFFICE, 190_.\r\n\r\n    In consideration of having received from ____ of Edgartown the\r\n    sum of $2, permission is hereby granted to him to take from any\r\n    of the waters of this town daily, between sunrise and sunset,\r\n    twenty-five bushels of scallops or clams, including shells,\r\n    and four bushels, including shells, of quahaugs; of these four\r\n    bushels, not more than two bushels are to be of the size known\r\n    as \"little necks.\"\r\n\r\n    The acceptance of this permit constitutes an agreement by the\r\n    holder thereof that he will, and that any other person who for\r\n    the time being has or shall have in his custody or possession\r\n    any building, boat, barrel, box, tub, crate or other vessel or\r\n    receptacle containing or suitable for or capable of containing\r\n    shellfish, and belonging to or under the control of the holder\r\n    of this permit, shall, at any time or place when requested\r\n    so to do by either of said selectmen or by their authorized\r\n    agent, or by any constable or fish warden of said town, or\r\n    by any other officer authorized to enforce the laws relating\r\n    to shellfish or shellfisheries in said town, open any such\r\n    building, boat, barrel, box, tub, crate or other vessel or\r\n    receptacle, and fully expose to them or either of them the\r\n    contents thereof for inspection; and if the holder of this\r\n    permit or such other person as aforesaid, when so requested,\r\n    refuses or neglects so to do, said selectmen may revoke this\r\n    permit or suspend the same for any stated time, at their\r\n    discretion.\r\n\r\n    The holder of this permit is subject to the regulations for\r\n    the taking of eels and shellfish as made and posted by the\r\n    selectmen, and also to any additional regulations which said\r\n    board may hereafter make and publish.\r\n\r\n    If the person having this permit for the taking of shellfish\r\n    violates any law of the Commonwealth or any regulation now\r\n    or hereafter made by said selectmen, relating to shellfish\r\n    or shellfisheries in said town, said selectmen may revoke\r\n    said permit, or suspend the same for any stated time at their\r\n    discretion.\r\n\r\n    No person is allowed by law to take from the waters of\r\n    said town, or to sell or offer for sale, or to have in his\r\n    possession, any \"little neck\" clams or quahaugs measuring less\r\n    than one and one-half inches across the widest part. Any person\r\n    violating this provision of law is liable to a fine of not less\r\n    than ten nor more than one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n    This permit will expire April 1, 190 , unless sooner revoked.\r\n\r\n                                               _Selectmen of Edgartown._\r\n\r\nErnest Ingersoll in 1879 makes the following statement concerning the\r\nquahaug fishery of Martha's Vineyard:--\r\n\r\n    Martha's Vineyard used to be bordered by good quahaug ground,\r\n    but I am not aware that many are caught there now. In an old\r\n    book I find the following allusion to it: \"The poquau (_Venus\r\n    mercenaria_) is found in Old Town Harbor, at Cape Poge, and in\r\n    Menemsha Pond: great quantities are exported.\"\r\n\r\nA. Howard Clark in 1879 says:--\r\n\r\n    Soft clams and quahaugs are abundant in the harbor, and are\r\n    used by the fishermen for bait.... Three hundred bushels of\r\n    quahaugs and sea clams, valued at $150, were taken during the\r\n    year 1879.\r\n\r\nIf such were the conditions in 1879, the industry has had a great\r\ndevelopment. To-day Edgartown is one of the best quahaug towns of the\r\nState, and produces the finest \"little necks.\" Comparing the production\r\nfigures of 1879 and 1907, a great increase is noted:--\r\n\r\n                    _Production, 1879._\r\n\r\n  Bushels,                                        300\r\n  Value,                                         $150\r\n\r\n                    _Production, 1907._\r\n\r\n  Bushels,                                     20,000\r\n  Value,                                      $32,000\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            1,800\r\n  Number of men,                                   70\r\n  Number of boats,                                 42\r\n  Value of boats,                             $10,500\r\n  Number of dories,                                18\r\n  Value of dories,                               $450\r\n  Value of implements,                         $1,050\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  8,000\r\n      Value,                                  $20,000\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 12,000\r\n      Value,                                  $12,000\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 20,000\r\n      Value,                                  $32,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fairhaven._\r\n\r\nAt Fairhaven the quahaug industry is of considerable importance, and\r\nthe output from this town alone is nearly half the entire production of\r\nBuzzards Bay.\r\n\r\nSome 3,000 acres are more or less bedded with quahaugs. Of this,\r\nprobably not more than one-tenth is very productive. The best\r\nquahauging is in Acushnet River, where digging for market has been\r\nforbidden because of sewage pollution (see New Bedford), and in Priests\r\nCove as far as Sconticut Neck. In these grounds \"little necks\" are\r\nnumerous. The grounds around West Island and Long Island, once very\r\nproductive, are now largely dug out. Little Bay and the east coast of\r\nSconticut Neck are fairly productive, while the west coast yields only\r\na small amount. Most of the quahaugs now dug come from the deep water\r\nwest-southwest of Sconticut Neck. Here, with rakes having handles from\r\n40 to 60 feet long, the quahaugers dig in water 7 fathoms or more in\r\ndepth. The quahaugs, mostly large sharps, are in bluish mud or sticky\r\nbottom, and are all large. A number of blunts are found with these\r\nlarge sharps. In the Acushnet River, owing to the enforced closed\r\nseason, there are a large number of \"little necks.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 115 men are employed now in quahauging. Before the Acushnet River\r\nwas closed by law, over twice that number are reported to have been\r\nengaged in the business. Six power boats and five cat boats, besides a\r\nconsiderable number of skiffs and dories, are used in the fishery.\r\n\r\nNo permits are required for ordinary quahauging except in the\r\nprescribed territory of Acushnet River, where permits to catch a\r\ncertain amount for bait are given as in New Bedford.\r\n\r\nThe production for 1879, as given by A. Howard Clark in \"The Fisheries\r\nof Massachusetts,\" was 3,000 bushels, which is just one-fifth of the\r\npresent production. The supply of quahaugs has decreased the last few\r\nyears, though new territory is constantly being opened up, as the\r\nquahaugers go out further into the deeper water. The increased price,\r\nhowever, probably more than counterbalances the decline in production.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            3,000\r\n  Number of men,                                  115\r\n  Number of boats,                                 11\r\n  Value of boats,                              $2,600\r\n  Number of skiffs,                               100\r\n  Value of skiffs,                             $1,500\r\n  Value of implements,                           $900\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,000\r\n      Value,                                   $2,500\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 14,000\r\n      Value,                                  $14,000\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 15,000\r\n      Value,                                  $16,500\r\n\r\n\r\n_Falmouth._\r\n\r\nThere is practically no quahaug industry in Falmouth. Hardly 100\r\nbushels are dug annually, and those only for home consumption. A few\r\nquahaugs are perhaps shipped by the oystermen.\r\n\r\nThis town, with its numerous inlets, bays and brackish water ponds,\r\noffers perhaps as fine an opportunity for shellfish culture, especially\r\nfor quahaugs, as exists in Massachusetts. There is no reason why the\r\nwater of Waquoit Bay and the other brackish ponds should not produce a\r\ngreat supply of quahaugs, if properly worked.\r\n\r\nQuahaugs are found mostly in scattering quantities over a large area in\r\nWaquoit Bay and in small quantities on the north and west side of Great\r\nPond, comprising a total of nearly 400 acres. Not all this ground,\r\nwhich is the greater part mud, is capable of producing quahaugs, but\r\nmany parts could produce good harvests. On the bay side of the town\r\nsmall patches of good quahaugs are found at North Falmouth, Squeteague\r\nPond, West Falmouth harbor on the southeast side, and a few are found\r\nin Hadley harbor, Naushon. These, together with the small patches\r\nin Great Pond, comprise about 1 acre of good quahaug ground, and are\r\nmostly dug by summer people.\r\n\r\nIn the past twenty-five years there has been a great decline in the\r\nquahaug industry, especially in Waquoit Bay, which to-day barely\r\nproduces 50 bushels. A. Howard Clark states, in 1879:[7]--\r\n\r\n    Quahaugs are plenty in Waquoit Bay, and are gathered and eaten\r\n    by the villagers, but none are shipped. It is estimated that\r\n    about 500 bushels of quahaugs are annually consumed by the\r\n    people of Falmouth town.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),              400\r\n  Number of men,                                   --\r\n  Number of boats,                                 --\r\n  Value of boats,                                  --\r\n  Number of dories,                                --\r\n  Value of dories,                                 --\r\n  Value of implements,                             --\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                     10\r\n      Value,                                      $25\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                     90\r\n      Value,                                      $90\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    100\r\n      Value,                                     $115\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harwich._\r\n\r\nThe quahaug fishery of the town of Harwich is carried on in that part\r\nof Pleasant Bay which lies within the town limits. In the southern\r\nwaters of the town, on the Sound side, scattering quahaugs are found\r\nin certain localities, but are not of any commercial importance. The\r\nmost important of those localities are off Dean's Creek and in Herring\r\nRiver, where quahaugs are dug for home consumption.\r\n\r\nHarwich shares with Chatham and Orleans the quahaug fishery of Pleasant\r\nBay, but has a more limited territory, as only a small portion of\r\nPleasant Bay lies within the town limits. Practically all this\r\nterritory, comprising 100 acres, is quahauging ground, though the\r\ncommercial quahauging is prosecuted over an area of 10 acres only.\r\nScattering quahaugs are found over an area of 100 acres.\r\n\r\nAs the waters of Pleasant Bay are sheltered, the fishing is all done\r\nfrom dories, with basket rakes having 20 to 25 foot poles. The depth of\r\nwater over the quahaug beds is from 6 to 16 feet.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the quahaug fishery in Pleasant Bay, Mr. Warren J.\r\nNickerson of East Harwich, who has been acquainted with the industry\r\nfor many years, says:--\r\n\r\n    Pleasant Bay is and has been a very valuable quahaug ground.\r\n    Some fifty years ago there were shipped in vessels to New Haven\r\n    and other places 13,000 bushels in one year from its waters.\r\n    Since then there has been more or less taken from these waters\r\n    by fishermen from the towns of Orleans, Chatham and Harwich.\r\n    During the last few years there have been 25 regular fishermen\r\n    and perhaps 12 transient. Probably 8,000 bushels a year for the\r\n    last five years would be a fair estimate of the catch. Thirty\r\n    per cent of these were \"little necks.\"\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),              100\r\n  Number of men,                                    7\r\n  Number of boats,                                 --\r\n  Value of boats,                                  --\r\n  Number of dories,                                 7\r\n  Value of dories,                               $100\r\n  Value of implements,                           $100\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                    700\r\n      Value,                                   $1,750\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    800\r\n      Value,                                     $800\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,500\r\n      Value,                                   $2,550\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marion._\r\n\r\nThe town of Marion, situated on the western side of Buzzards Bay,\r\npossesses a spacious harbor, the waters of which furnish excellent\r\nquahaug grounds.\r\n\r\nThis territory, comprising a total of 400 acres, is chiefly confined\r\nto Marion harbor, running in a narrow strip parallel to the shore from\r\nAucoot Cove all along the coast to Planting Island. Almost all the head\r\nof the harbor and all of Blankinship's and Planting Island Cove is\r\nquahaug area. Small grounds are also found at Wing's Cove and in the\r\nWeweantit River.\r\n\r\nThe town law requires each year the possession of a permit costing $1\r\nbefore a person is entitled to dig quahaugs for sale. Nineteen of these\r\nlicenses were issued in 1906, but not more than 2 or 3 of these went to\r\nmen who depend upon quahauging for a living. The remaining 16 engage in\r\nthe fishery to a greater or lesser extent in the summer season.\r\n\r\nThe annual production for 1906 was 800 bushels, valued at $1,500, as\r\nabout half were \"little necks.\" Mediums are not numerous, and are\r\nbought by the quahaug dealers at $1.25 per bushel and sold by them at\r\nso much per hundred.\r\n\r\nIn Marion the quahaug industry once flourished to a marked degree, but\r\nat present is very much on the decline. The coves, which once were\r\nbedded with \"little necks\" and quahaugs, are now nearly exhausted. No\r\nreasons exist for this condition of affairs, so far as known, except\r\noverdigging. Gradually for many years the supply has perceptibly\r\ndeclined, until now it is at a very low ebb. Where a thousand barrels\r\nwere formerly produced, it is doubtful if a thousand bushels are now\r\ndug during the entire season, and the overworked beds are becoming each\r\nyear more depleted. A. Howard Clark, in his report on the fisheries of\r\nMarion, estimates the quahaug production in 1880 as 2,000 bushels. The\r\nyield for 1906 is only 800 bushels, which shows an alarming decline\r\nin production. If once the waters of Marion could produce a large\r\namount of quahaugs, there is no reason why they cannot again be made to\r\nproduce the same, or more.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),              400\r\n  Number of men,                                   19\r\n  Number of boats,                                 --\r\n  Value of boats,                                  --\r\n  Number of skiffs,                                19\r\n  Value of skiffs,                               $200\r\n  Value of implements,                            $50\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                    400\r\n      Value,                                   $1,100\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    400\r\n      Value,                                     $400\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    800\r\n      Value,                                   $1,500\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mashpee._\r\n\r\nThe quahaug industry at Mashpee is at a low ebb. Natural facilities\r\nare favorable, but a lack of initiative on the part of the inhabitants\r\ncauses a small production. The best grounds are found in Popponessett\r\nBay and River, where a territory of 200 acres includes several oyster\r\ngrants which are worked but little. On the east side of Waquoit Bay\r\nscattering quahaugs are found in Mashpee waters.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 regular and 4 intermittent quahaugers, with an invested\r\ncapital of $70, who are obliged by the town laws to have a permit\r\ncosting $1. The quahaug industry of the town has remained about the\r\nsame for the last twenty-five years, and now a good quahauger can\r\nscarcely average 1½ to 2 bushels per day.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),              400\r\n  Number of men,                                    7\r\n  Number of boats,                                 --\r\n  Value of boats,                                  --\r\n  Number of skiffs,                                 5\r\n  Value of skiffs,                                $50\r\n  Value of implements,                            $20\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                     25\r\n      Value,                                      $60\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    225\r\n      Value,                                     $225\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    250\r\n      Value,                                     $285\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mattapoisett._\r\n\r\nThe town of Mattapoisett, situated to the west of Marion, receives but\r\nlittle income from her shellfisheries, as the waters are for the most\r\npart too open and exposed for shellfish culture. The quahaug fishery\r\nis the most important shellfish industry of the town, but even this,\r\nwhen compared with the quahaug fishery of other towns, is rather\r\nunimportant, as most of the suitable territory is nonproductive.\r\n\r\nQuahaugs are very unevenly distributed over 800 acres. The best\r\nquahaugs are found in Aucoot Cove and at Brants. In the main harbor\r\nquahaugs are found, though scattering, as indicated on the map.\r\n\r\nNo licenses or permits are required of the 28 men and boys who add to\r\ntheir income from time to time by quahauging. Most of these depend on\r\nother sources of employment for their main support. The industry as a\r\nwhole is gradually declining, as overfishing has made it impossible for\r\nthe natural supply to perpetuate itself.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),              750\r\n  Number of men,                                   28\r\n  Number of boats,                                 --\r\n  Value of boats,                                  --\r\n  Number of skiffs,                                28\r\n  Value of skiffs,                               $425\r\n  Value of implements,                            $75\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                    400\r\n      Value,                                   $1,100\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    400\r\n      Value,                                     $400\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    800\r\n      Value,                                   $1,500\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nantucket._\r\n\r\nThe quahaug industry of Nantucket ranks second to the main shellfish\r\nindustry, the scallop fishery, and brings annually about $8,000 to the\r\nisland. Nantucket is especially adapted for quahaugs, as Nantucket\r\nharbor, Maddequet harbor and the Island of Tuckernuck possess extensive\r\nterritory. In spite of these natural advantages, which are as fine\r\nas any in the State, Nantucket produces only 6,000 bushels annually,\r\nwhereas her resources, under proper cultural methods, warrant an annual\r\nproduction exceeding even that of Wellfleet, which is at present\r\nshipping 33,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe quahauging territory of Nantucket is divided into three sections:\r\n(1) Nantucket harbor; (2) Maddequet harbor; and (3) Tuckernuck.\r\n\r\nIn Nantucket harbor quahaugs are found over an area of 2,290 acres,\r\nboth scattering and in thick patches. The principal areas are situated\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Near the town between Monomoy Heights and the wharves is a\r\nterritory of 240 acres. In the deep water directly out from the wharves\r\nthere has been good quahauging although the bed was discovered only a\r\nfew years ago.\r\n\r\n(2) On the east side of the harbor, between Abram's Point and Pocomo\r\nHead, including Polpis harbor, are extensive grounds, comprising about\r\n900 acres, of scattering quahaugs.\r\n\r\n(3) On the opposite side of the harbor lies a strip of quahaug\r\nterritory of 250 acres, which extends between Third Point and Bass\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\n(4) At the head of the harbor on both sides quahaugs are found over an\r\narea of 900 acres.\r\n\r\nMaddequet harbor on the western end of the island has approximately 300\r\nacres suitable for quahaugs, running from Broad Creek to Eel Point.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern end of Tuckernuck Island is a bed of quahaugs covering\r\nabout 200 acres; while on the west side, between Muskeget and\r\nTuckernuck, is a large area of 2,500 acres, which is more or less\r\nproductive. The Tuckernuck fishery is largely \"little necks,\" and it is\r\nfrom here that the shipment of small \"seed\" quahaugs has been made.\r\n\r\nIn the spring and fall men who have been boatmen during the summer work\r\nat quahauging. While 48 men work irregularly, about 18 men are engaged\r\nin the fishery during the entire summer, though probably never more\r\nthan 30 are raking at any one time.\r\n\r\nThe production in 1906, from April I to November I, was 2,159 barrels,\r\nor 6,477 bushels; value, $7,557.\r\n\r\n                          PRODUCTION, 1907.[8]\r\n\r\n  ==============+========================================+\r\n                |              QUAHAUGS                  |\r\n                |---------+-----------+---------+--------+\r\n                | Barrels |  Average  | Bushels |  Value |\r\n     MONTHS     |         | price per |         |        |\r\n                |         |  Barrel   |         |        |\r\n  --------------+---------+-----------+---------+--------+\r\n  April         |   138   |   $3.50   |    414  |  $483  |\r\n  May           |   257   |    4.00   |    771  | 1,028  |\r\n  June          |   460   |    4.00   |  1,380  | 1,840  |\r\n  July          |   355   |    3.00   |  1,065  | 1,060  |\r\n  August        |   312   |    3.50   |    936  | 1,092  |\r\n  September     |   302   |    3.42   |    906  | 1,032  |\r\n  October       |   123   |    4.00   |    369  |   492  |\r\n  November      |    50   |    3.00   |    150  |   150  |\r\n                +---------+-----------+---------+--------+\r\n    Total       | 1,997   |   $3.60   |  5,991  |$7,177  |\r\n  \"Little necks\"|   101   |           |    303  | 1,310  |\r\n                +---------+-----------+---------+--------+\r\n    Grand total | 2,098   |           |  6,294  |$8,487  |\r\n  ==============+=========+===========+=========+========+\r\n\r\n  +=======================================================\r\n  |              |            \"LITTLE NECKS\"\r\n  |              |---------+-----------+---------+--------\r\n  |              | Barrels |  Average  | Bushels |  Value\r\n  |   MONTHS     |         | price per |         |\r\n  |              |         |  Barrel   |         |\r\n  +--------------+---------+-----------+---------+--------\r\n  |April         |    --   |     --    |    --   |   --\r\n  |May           |     4   |   $14.00  |    12   |  $56\r\n  |June          |    13   |    14.00  |    39   |  182\r\n  |July          |    33   |    14.00  |    90   |  462\r\n  |August        |    20   |    15.00  |    60   |  300\r\n  |September     |    22   |    10.00  |    66   |  220\r\n  |October       |     9   |    10.00  |    27   |   90\r\n  |November      |    --   |     --    |    --   |   --\r\n  |              +---------+-----------+---------+--------\r\n  |  Total       |   101   |   $12.97  |   303   |$1,310\r\n  +==============|=========+===========+=========+========\r\n\r\nThe month of June shows the largest production, as the summer people\r\ndo not arrive in any numbers until July. The men who do the summer\r\nboating are engaged in the quahaug fishery during this month, naturally\r\nincreasing the production.\r\n\r\nThe principal method is raking from a boat or dory with a long-handled\r\nbasket rake, very similar in form to the rake used on Cape Cod. The\r\nsecond method, applicable only in shallow water, employs the use of\r\na claw rake with a much shorter handle. The quahauger uses this rake\r\nin the shallow water, where he can wade at low tide. The largest claw\r\nrakes are often wider than the basket rakes, and are much cheaper.\r\n\r\nAt Nantucket about 5 per cent. of the entire catch is \"little necks,\"\r\nwhich are found mostly at Tuckernuck. The quahauger usually makes three\r\nculls of his catch: (1) \"little necks\"; (2) medium; (3) large. A few\r\nblunts are obtained. The quahaugs are shipped chiefly to New York and\r\nBoston markets, either directly by the quahaugers or through Nantucket\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\nThe boats used in the industry, numbering 24 sail, 6 power and 10\r\nsingle dories, and approximating $6,150 in value, are in a way\r\ntransitory capital, and are used in the winter for scalloping and other\r\nfishing. Nevertheless, it is necessary to class them as capital used in\r\nthe quahaug fishery.\r\n\r\nNo special town laws are made for the regulation of the Nantucket\r\nquahaug fishery, although at any time by vote of the town suitable\r\nregulations and by-laws can be made.\r\n\r\nQuahaugs have probably always been abundant at Nantucket, as over fifty\r\nyears ago they were reported as plentiful. It is only of late years\r\nthat the fishery has assumed any great importance, when the increasing\r\nprices, especially for the \"little necks,\" made it profitable for men\r\nto enter the business. As it is, many men now quahaug only when they\r\nhave nothing else to do.\r\n\r\nFrom the statistics of the United States Fish Commission for 1879 we\r\nfind that the annual catch for that year amounted to 150 bushels,\r\nvalued at $75. As a striking contrast to this, the present production\r\nof 6,294 bushels, valued at $8,487, shows the great development of the\r\nfishery, which has been caused by more men entering the business, the\r\nopening up of new beds, such as the \"little neck\" beds of Tuckernuck,\r\nand the improved methods of raking in the deep water.\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to state definitely, from lack of past\r\nstatistical figures, whether Nantucket industry is declining or\r\nimproving. Between 1879 and 1906 no records are obtainable. The\r\nproduction figures for 1906 show 6,477 bushels, as compared with 6,144\r\nbushels in 1907. Whether there was merely a sudden temporary increase\r\nin the supply by the opening up of new beds in 1906, or whether there\r\nis a steady decline, can only be determined by the production of future\r\nyears. Many indications point to the latter, in spite of the assurance\r\nof the quahaugers that 1907 was a good season, because of high market\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nThe last few years have witnessed a change in the quahaug fishery,--a\r\nrealization that there is more money in planting and raising quahaugs\r\nthan in oyster culture. The out-of-State oystermen, especially in New\r\nYork, have been the first to realize this, and have been buying, at the\r\nrate of $4 to $5 per bushel, all the small quahaugs they can procure,\r\nmerely replanting, to reap the following year a yield of 3 to 6 bushels\r\nfor every bushel planted.\r\n\r\nUnder the stimulus of the high prices offered, many bushels of small\r\nquahaugs have been shipped from the town, which thus lost what the\r\nplanters gained. There is much feeling against such a practice, but so\r\nfar nothing has been done by the town to stop this shipping of \"seed\"\r\nquahaugs. As the town has full control of its shellfisheries, it has\r\nonly to pass a simple law allowing no quahaugs under 2 inches to be\r\ntaken, and see that it is properly enforced. Such a matter should be\r\nattended to at once, as not only is the actual value of the catch\r\ndiminished, but the industry is seriously impaired by the capture of\r\nthese small quahaugs before they can spawn.\r\n\r\nThe only other way to remedy this difficulty is to grant licenses\r\nallowing the replanting of these small quahaugs on the barren parts of\r\nthe harbor until they have obtained a proper size. The results obtained\r\nfrom the experiments of the commission in Polpis harbor show that\r\nquahaugs will grow rapidly when thus replanted in suitable places, and\r\nthat a gain of ½ to ¾ of an inch, or 3 to 6 bushels for every bushel\r\nbedded, can be obtained during the six summer months (May to November).\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            5,290\r\n  Number of men,                                   48\r\n  Number of boats,                                 30\r\n  Value of boats,                              $5,800\r\n  Number of dories,                                10\r\n  Value of dories,                               $350\r\n  Value of gear,                                 $600\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                    303\r\n      Value,                                   $1,310\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  5,991\r\n      Value,                                   $7,177\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  6,294\r\n      Value,                                   $8,487\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Bedford._\r\n\r\nThe quahaug industry of New Bedford was practically annihilated by the\r\nlaw of 1905, which closed the Acushnet River and Clark's Cove to both\r\nclammer and quahauger. Good beds of quahaugs, particularly \"little\r\nnecks,\" exist in both these waters, but can be taken only for bait.\r\nAs several sewers run into the Acushnet River, and the public health\r\nwas endangered by the consumption as food of the quahaugs taken from\r\nthe river and the waters near its mouth, nearly 400 acres of quahaug\r\nterritory were closed by the State Board of Health. What little\r\navailable territory there is outside the prescribed area, off Clark's\r\nPoint, is free to all.\r\n\r\nA license is required to dig quahaugs for bait in this territory, and\r\nsuch is issued free of charge. The maximum amount permitted to be dug\r\nis 2 bushels per week of clams or quahaugs, or of both. Some 320\r\npermits have been issued since the law was passed, in 1905. Eleven of\r\nthese have been since revoked for unlawful conduct on the part of the\r\npossessors. For the first offence the license is merely revoked, for\r\nthe second a fine of $10, and for the third $100 is imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orleans._\r\n\r\nAlthough Orleans is well represented by all four main types of\r\nshellfish, the quahaug fishery is the leading industry of the town. A\r\nfavorable coast line, fronting on the west the waters of Cape Cod Bay\r\nand bounded on the east by Pleasant Bay, provides excellent facilities\r\nfor the quahaug fishery.\r\n\r\nThe main quahauging territory is in Cape Cod Bay. While the west coast\r\nof Orleans is only about a mile long, the privileges which allow\r\nthe citizens of Orleans free fishing in Eastham waters, according\r\nto the act of incorporation in 1792, \"whereby the benefits of the\r\nshellfishery were to be mutually shared,\" opens up an extensive tract\r\nof quahaug territory, from 2 to 3 miles in width, extending north as\r\nfar as Billingsgate Island and the Wellfleet line. The actual Orleans\r\nquahaug territory consists only of 1,000 acres, which furnish but poor\r\nquahauging, while the water is several fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nOn the east side an entirely different condition prevails. Here in\r\nthe waters of Pleasant Bay is a bed of quahaugs which, though worked\r\nfor a long time, is still in excellent condition. The proportion of\r\n\"little necks\" is larger than on the west side, running about one-half\r\nthe entire catch; neither is the water as deep here, rarely having\r\na greater depth than 12 feet, and by no means as rough as the more\r\nexposed waters of Cape Cod Bay. The quahauging grounds here comprise\r\n500 acres.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are 1,500 acres of quahaug territory in the town of\r\nOrleans, only a small part of this is commercially productive, and the\r\nlarger part of the fishery is carried on in Eastham waters.\r\n\r\nThe possession of two entirely different quahaug grounds, one on the\r\neast, the other on the west coast, makes practically two different\r\nindustries, each of which will have to be considered separately.\r\n\r\n(1) _Cape Cod Bay Industry._--In Cape Cod Bay 50 men rake quahaugs\r\nwhenever the weather will permit. Owing to the great depth of water,\r\nthe work is difficult, requiring rakes with handles often 60 feet long.\r\nTwo men generally go in one boat, the usual type being an elongated\r\ndory, some 30 to 32 feet over all, carrying from 4 to 12 horse-power\r\ngasolene engines. These boats are built to stand rough weather, and\r\ncost from $700 to $1,000 apiece. Thirty boats are employed in this\r\nbusiness in the bay.\r\n\r\nThe quahauger averages perhaps 100 working days in a year, as in a\r\nstrong wind and choppy sea it is impossible to rake in the deep water.\r\nA good fisherman expects to rake from 2 to 3 barrels of quahaugs a\r\nday. Five to ten years ago as many as 15 barrels were dug in a day\r\nby one man, but this is impossible now. Even as it is, the profits\r\nare large. The best quahauger in Orleans cleared in 1906 over $1,600,\r\nwhile several others made nearly $1,400. As at Wellfleet, the Orleans\r\nquahaugers receive licenses to replant their quahaugs along the shore,\r\nand it is customary to thus keep them until the New York or Boston\r\nmarkets offer suitable prices. Nearly two-thirds of these deep-water\r\nquahaugs are blunts, and perhaps one-tenth of the catch is \"little\r\nnecks.\"\r\n\r\n(2) _Pleasant Bay Industry._--About 25 men dig here from ordinary\r\ndories, using short rakes and tongs. The average wages are $2 to $3 per\r\nday, which is considerably less than the high wages of the Cape Cod Bay\r\nfishery; but many more days can be utilized during the year, while the\r\nwork is much easier and the necessary outlay of capital is slight. Here\r\nthe quahaugs run about one-half \"little necks,\" and the proportion of\r\nblunts is small.\r\n\r\nLittle evidence of decline can be seen in Pleasant Bay, where the bed\r\nof quahaugs, although raked for a long time, still shows few signs of\r\ndecrease. On the Cape Cod Bay side the reverse is true, and the supply\r\nis gradually diminishing.\r\n\r\nThe same town laws for regulation of the quahaug fishery apply for\r\nWellfleet, Eastham and Orleans. (See Wellfleet.)\r\n\r\nThe main historical features of the quahaug industry at Orleans have\r\nbeen similar to Wellfleet, the industry lying practically dormant until\r\n1894, when it rapidly reached its present production. Unfortunately,\r\nbut little data can be obtained for comparison of the industry of 1879\r\nwith 1907. Ernest Ingersoll reports, in 1879:--\r\n\r\n    At Orleans, some few men who go mackereling in summer stay at\r\n    home and dig clams in winter, getting perhaps 50 barrels of\r\n    quahaugs among others, which are peddled in the town.\r\n\r\nComparing the two years by table, we find:--\r\n\r\n  =======================+=================+===============================\r\n                         |1879.            |1907.                         |\r\n  -----------------------+-----------------+------------------------------+\r\n  Annual production,     |150 bushels,     |33,000 bushels.               |\r\n  Value of production,   |$82.50,          |$41,350.                      |\r\n  Number of men,         |A few,           |75.                           |\r\n  Location, quahaug beds,|Pleasant Bay,    |Cape Cod Bay and Pleasant Bay.|\r\n  Market,                |Home consumption,|New York and Boston.          |\r\n  =======================+=================+===============================\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  ==========================+===============+===============+=========\r\n                            | Cape Cod Bay. | Pleasant Bay. |  Total.\r\n  --------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------\r\n  Area (acres),             |      1,000    |       500     |   1,500\r\n  Number of men,            |         50    |        25     |      75\r\n  Number of boats,          |         30    |         -     |      30\r\n  Value of boats,           |    $23,000    |         -     | $23,000\r\n  Number of dories,         |          -    |        25     |      25\r\n  Value of dories,          |          -    |      $500     |    $500\r\n  Value of implements,      |     $1,250    |      $250     |  $1,500\r\n                            |               |               |\r\n          _Production._     |               |               |\r\n                            |               |               |\r\n  \"Little necks\":--         |               |               |\r\n     Bushels,               |      2,700    |     3,000     |   5,700\r\n     Value,                 |     $6,750    |    $7,000     | $13,750\r\n                            |               |               |\r\n  Quahaugs:--               |               |               |\r\n     Bushels,               |     24,300    |     3,000     |  27,300\r\n     Value,                 |    $24,300    |    $3,300     | $27,600\r\n                            |               |               |\r\n  Total:--                  |               |               |\r\n     Bushels,               |     27,000    |     6,000     |  33,000\r\n     Value,                 |    $31,050    |   $10,300     | $41,350\r\n  ==========================+===============+===============+=========\r\n\r\n\r\n_Provincetown._\r\n\r\nNo commercial quahaug fishery is carried on at Provincetown. A few\r\nquahaugs, chiefly \"little necks,\" are found in the tide pools among the\r\nthatch on the northwestern side of the harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Swansea._\r\n\r\nA quahaug fishery existed in Swansea until three years ago. Since that\r\ntime there has been no commercial fishery, though a few quahaugs are\r\nstill dug for home consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Truro._\r\n\r\nOccasionally a few scattering quahaugs are found on the bars, which\r\nextend out one-quarter of a mile from shore on the bay side. No quahaug\r\nfishery is carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wareham._\r\n\r\nThe town of Wareham, situated on the northeast side of Buzzards Bay\r\nand separated from the adjoining town of Bourne by Cohasset Narrows,\r\nhas a coast line indented with numerous small inlets, bays and rivers,\r\nwhich afford excellent opportunities for the growth of the quahaug.\r\nThe villages of Onset, Wareham and part of Buzzards Bay enjoy the\r\nprivileges of this fishery.\r\n\r\nQuahaugs are found over practically the entire territory, and comprise\r\na total area of about 1,300 acres. Although much of this area is\r\nbarren, the commercial fishery is maintained by small isolated beds\r\nwhich occur here and there.\r\n\r\nThe two principal centers of the industry are in the Wareham River and\r\nin Onset Bay. At Onset the whole bay, except the oyster grants, as\r\nincluded between the southeast end of Mashnee Island and Peters Neck,\r\nis used for quahauging. A few quahaugs are found in Broad Cove, and\r\nfair digging is obtained in Buttermilk Bay and Cohasset Narrows. The\r\nWareham River, outside the oyster grants, and a narrow shore strip from\r\nWeweantit River to Tempe's Knob, comprise the rest of the territory. In\r\nOnset Channel a fine bed exists in deep water, 2 to 4 fathoms, but the\r\nground is so hard that not much digging is done.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the map that practically 75 per cent. of the\r\nquahaug territory is taken up by oyster grants, especially in the\r\nWareham River and Onset Bay. Town sentiment is in a chaotic state\r\nover the oyster and quahaug deadlock, and much friction naturally\r\nexists between the opposing factions, the quahaugers and oystermen.\r\nThe struggle between these two parties was at its height several years\r\nago, and the enmity still continues, though not so openly, owing to the\r\ndecline of the quahaug industry. Rightly managed, affairs ought to be\r\nso arranged that prosperity might be brought to both factions; but town\r\ncustoms and town laws, poorly enforced at the best, are hardly able to\r\ncope with this evil, which has resulted in much expense legally and\r\nfinancially to both parties, and both industries are badly crippled in\r\nconsequence,--the oyster industry by lack of protection and the quahaug\r\nindustry by loss of grounds. It is hoped that in the future suitable\r\narrangements can be made for both industries, and that the quahaug\r\nindustry, which is at present declining, can be put on an equal footing\r\nwith the oyster industry, by granting licenses to plant and grow\r\nquahaugs.\r\n\r\nMost of the digging is done with garden rakes, potato diggers or by\r\nhand. Some tongs are used, but few if any long-handled basket rakes,\r\nsince the digging is chiefly confined to the shallow water, not more\r\nthan 10 feet deep, except in Onset Channel, where it ranges from 12 to\r\n24 feet.\r\n\r\nNo information or statistical records of the quahaug fishery of Wareham\r\ncan be obtained, and it is therefore impossible to draw any comparison\r\nbetween the present industry and the industry of twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the quahaug fishery in Wareham is an established\r\nfact. The production of 6,000 bushels for 1906 is far less than the\r\nproduction of five years ago. Since 1901 the output has steadily\r\ndeclined, and where the quahauger once was able to rake 5 bushels at\r\na tide, to-day he can rake scarcely 1 bushel in the same time. It\r\nis only a question of a few years when the natural supply will be\r\ncompletely exterminated. The only salvation of the industry in Wareham\r\nis to increase the natural supply by quahaug farming.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            1,300\r\n  Number of men,                                   50\r\n  Number of boats,                                  -\r\n  Value of boats,                                   -\r\n  Number of dories,                                50\r\n  Value of dories,                               $750\r\n  Value of implements,                           $250\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  3,000\r\n      Value,                                   $7,500\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  3,000\r\n      Value,                                   $3,000\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  6,000\r\n      Value,                                  $10,500\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wellfleet._\r\n\r\nThe town of Wellfleet possesses the finest quahaug industry in\r\nMassachusetts. More men are engaged in the business and the annual\r\nproduction is larger than that of any other town of the State.\r\n\r\nIn colonial days the towns of Orleans, Eastham and Wellfleet were\r\nincorporated as one town,--the town of Eastham. In 1763 an act was\r\npassed incorporating the North Precinct of Eastham into a district by\r\nthe name of Wellfleet, \"Reserving to the inhabitants of said town the\r\nprivileges by them heretofore enjoyed of all ways to and of erecting\r\nhouses on the beaches and islands for the convenience of the fishery of\r\nall kinds, and of anchorage and of landing all goods or wares at any of\r\ntheir common landing places in any of the harbors of said Eastham in\r\nlike manner as they might have done if this act had never been made and\r\npassed.\" By this act were created the two independent towns of Eastham\r\nand Wellfleet, which held in common all fisheries, thus giving the\r\nmutual right of the shellfisheries to both towns.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 another act of incorporation, separating Orleans from Eastham,\r\nwas enacted, which provided that the benefits of the shellfisheries of\r\nthese two towns were to be mutually enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe result of these two acts was to give Eastham and Wellfleet and at\r\nthe same time Eastham and Orleans mutual rights of the shellfishery,\r\nbut forbidding mutual shellfisheries between Wellfleet and Orleans.\r\nWhile this may seem to give theoretically the advantage to Eastham,\r\nactually the town gains nothing in the quahaug fishery, as Orleans has\r\npractically no productive grounds on the bay side, and the Orleans\r\nquahaugers fish in the Eastham waters.\r\n\r\nThe quahaug territory of Wellfleet comprises about 2,500 acres, and\r\napproximately takes up all the harbor, wherever there are no oyster\r\ngrants, running from the \"Deep Hole\" between Great Island and Indian\r\nNeck southward to the Eastham line. Outside of these limits a few\r\nquahaugs are found on the flats of Duck Creek and along the shore\r\nflats of the town. They are more abundant on the north side of Egg\r\nIsland, where they are taken in shallow water with ordinary hand\r\nrakes. The best quahauging is found in the channel extending from an\r\nimaginary line between Lieutenant's Island and Great Beach Hill south\r\nto Billingsgate. The greatest depth at low tide is 4½ fathoms and the\r\ngeneral average is about 3 fathoms. In this channel are found most of\r\nthe \"little necks,\" small blunts and small sharps.\r\n\r\nOutside of the oyster grants, quahaugs are found south of Great\r\nIsland, north of Billingsgate Island on the west side of the harbor,\r\non Lieutenant's Island bar and at the mouth of Blackfish Creek. A few\r\nquahaugs, both sharps and blunts, are raked with 25-foot rakes in the\r\nshallow water 6 to 8 feet near the beach, usually on a sandy bottom.\r\n\r\nThe principal market for Wellfleet quahaugs is New York, though many\r\nare sent to Boston and other parts of the country, even to the middle\r\nwest. Quahaugs have been shipped from Wellfleet to Milwaukee and\r\narrived in good condition after ten days.\r\n\r\nThe annual production is 33,000 bushels, one-sixth of these, 5,500\r\nbushels, being \"little necks.\" There were 140 men engaged in the\r\nfishery in 1906, and 145 permits were granted in 1907. The average\r\nyield for a day's raking is 4 bushels, although an exceptional\r\nquahauger can sometimes rake 7 bushels.\r\n\r\nPractically all the raking is done in deep water, with rakes the\r\nhandles of which are often 47 feet long. Each quahauger has a set\r\nof handles of various lengths for different depths of water. Both\r\npower boats and \"cats\" are used here in quahauging, the power boats\r\npossessing considerable advantage over the sail boat. Thirty-eight\r\npower boats and 62 sail boats, both single and double manned, are used\r\nat Wellfleet.\r\n\r\nAt present there is every indication of a declining fishery. Until\r\nthe last three years the industry has been steadily on the increase\r\nsince 1894. The maximum production was reached a few years ago, and\r\nthe industry is slowly on the decline, unless the opening up of new\r\nbeds gives it a fresh start. Unfortunately, all the quahaugers do not\r\nrealize the possibility of this seemingly inexhaustible supply giving\r\nout, and believe it will continue forever; but any one can see that\r\nit is impossible for the natural supply to continue when such inroads\r\nare yearly made, and that it is only a question of time when the best\r\nbusiness asset of the town will become extinct.\r\n\r\nFor years there has been an antagonistic feeling between the\r\nquahaugers and the oystermen, due to the conflicting interests of\r\nthese industries. Although the quahaug territory has been narrowed\r\ndown by the giving of oyster grants in the harbor, the quahaug fishery\r\nhas not suffered severely, as the poorer quahaug grounds were alone\r\ngranted, with the idea that more money could be made by using these\r\nfor oyster culture. Although these grants were laid out in good faith,\r\ninjustice in many instances has been done the quahaug industry; but on\r\nthe whole the change has been for the benefit of the town. In the broad\r\nwaters of Wellfleet harbor there is room for both industries, and there\r\nis no reason why both should not prosper if wisely regulated, without\r\nthe intervention of town politics. At present this antagonism has hurt\r\nthe interests of both, and it is manifestly unfair that either should\r\ndrive the other out while there is room for both to prosper.\r\n\r\nWellfleet is the only town that can boast of a quahaug club. This\r\nclub was formed in 1904, and had an enrollment of practically all the\r\nquahaugers.\r\n\r\nPermits are required of every man engaged in the quahaug fishery. These\r\ncost $1 apiece, and are granted on application to any one who has been\r\na resident of the town for six months. These permits are to be obtained\r\neach year, on or before May 1, after which date an additional charge of\r\n50 cents is made for collecting. No person without a regular permit is\r\nallowed to catch quahaugs for market. Permits were first issued in 1904.\r\n\r\nSection 2 of chapter 269 of the Acts of 1904 is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    SECTION 2. No inhabitant of said towns shall sell or offer for\r\n    sale little neck clams or quahaugs which measure less than one\r\n    and one-half inches across the widest part, and no person shall\r\n    in any of said towns sell or offer for sale little neck clams\r\n    or quahaugs which measure less than one and one-half inches\r\n    across the widest part.\r\n\r\nThis excellent law was passed for the towns of Eastham, Orleans\r\nand Wellfleet, but has never been enforced. Although enacted and\r\ntechnically lived up to, no measures are made for its enforcement,\r\nwhich would necessitate a shellfish inspector. This furnishes an\r\nexample of the nonenforcement of one of the few good town laws.\r\n\r\nSection 4 of chapter 269 of the Acts of 1904 is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    SECTION 4. The selectmen of the said towns may, in their\r\n    respective towns, grant licenses or permits for such periods,\r\n    not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as they\r\n    may deem proper, not however covering more than seventy-five\r\n    feet square in area, to any inhabitants of the town to bed\r\n    quahaugs in any waters, flats and creeks within the town at\r\n    any place where there is no natural quahaug bed, not impairing\r\n    the private rights of any person or materially obstructing any\r\n    navigable waters. It shall be unlawful for any person, except\r\n    the licensee and his agents, to take any quahaugs in or remove\r\n    them from the territory covered by any such license.\r\n\r\nThe above should receive well-deserved praise, as it is one of the most\r\nuseful town laws ever enacted in Massachusetts. Each quahauger is thus\r\nenabled to stake off a little plot 75 feet square on the flats, whereon\r\nhe can bed his catch whenever the market price is too low for shipment.\r\nThis not only makes steadier work for the quahaugers, since a dull\r\nmarket does not stop digging, as before, but also enables him to obtain\r\na better price for his quahaugs, and he is not forced to lose through\r\nthe wastes of competition.\r\n\r\nQuahaugs have always been abundant at Wellfleet. Forty years ago about\r\n15 men were engaged in the business, and shipped their catch to Boston\r\nby packet boats, quahaugs then wholesaling at 50 cents per bushel.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 (report of the United States Fish Commission) Ernest Ingersoll\r\ngives the following account of the quahaug industry at Wellfleet, which\r\nfurnishes such an excellent comparison with the present industry that\r\nit is given here:--\r\n\r\n    The early productiveness of Cape Cod is shown by the presence\r\n    of numerous shellfish heaps, particularly in Wellfleet and\r\n    Barnstable harbors, filled up by the Indians, and consisting\r\n    almost wholly of the shells of this mollusk. Though in greatly\r\n    depleted numbers, the quahaug still survives along the inside\r\n    of the Cape, and at Wellfleet has been raked from early times\r\n    by the settlers. Mr. F. W. True contributes some notes on\r\n    this place, from which I learn that the quahaug fishery as\r\n    a business there dates from the beginning of the nineteenth\r\n    century. It grew in extent until 1863, and from that time\r\n    until 1868 the trade was at its height, since when it has\r\n    diminished year by year, owing to lack of good market rather\r\n    than failure of the supply. Between 1863 and 1869 the average\r\n    catch each year was not less than 2,500 bushels. Of this amount\r\n    a comparatively small part was consumed at Wellfleet, and the\r\n    rest were shipped to Boston, Provincetown, Salem, Newport,\r\n    Manchester and a few other New England ports. From 1870 to 1876\r\n    the quantity of quahaugs taken per year decreased from 2,500\r\n    bushels to 1,800 bushels, and this latter amount has remained\r\n    constant to the present year. Of the total catch in 1878,\r\n    fully one-half, or 900 bushels, was consumed in Wellfleet, and\r\n    the remaining 900 bushels were shipped to Boston and other\r\n    neighboring towns. For three years, beginning with 1876, 75\r\n    bushels of quahaugs have been annually shipped to New York City.\r\n\r\n    Quahaugs are found in all parts of Wellfleet Bay except in a\r\n    small spot near the wharves, called the \"Deep Hole,\" and a\r\n    similar one on the west side of the bay. Both of these places\r\n    are covered with a thick, soft mud. It is not usual, however,\r\n    to fish in parts of the bay where the average depth at low\r\n    water exceeds 8 feet. Most of the raking is done on the western\r\n    side. In ordinary years, quahaug raking is begun the last of\r\n    March and continues until the first of October. As a general\r\n    thing, no raking is done through the winter months, although\r\n    in some years a small amount has been done through holes cut\r\n    in the ice. The fishermen rake about four tides per week,\r\n    beginning at half-ebb and raking to half-flood. The boats used\r\n    are either cat boats or yawls rigged with two sails. Each boat\r\n    carries 1 man. The rake employed at Wellfleet is described\r\n    by Mr. True as similar in form to an oyster rake, but made of\r\n    steel instead of iron. In former days this instrument was of\r\n    iron, the tips of the teeth only being of steel. An average\r\n    rake has seventeen teeth, and weighs about 12 pounds. The\r\n    handle or tail is of wood, and is about 23 feet long. The\r\n    baskets in which the quahaugs are collected and measured are\r\n    of ordinary manufacture, and hold about a bushel each; and the\r\n    whole outfit of a quahaug fisherman does not cost over $150,\r\n    and the total amount of capital invested in apparatus at the\r\n    present time in Wellfleet does not exceed $800. This amount is\r\n    about evenly divided between 5 men, none of whom are engaged in\r\n    this fishery more than a part of their time.\r\n\r\n    Quahaugs are sent to market always in the shell, and packed\r\n    in second-hand flour or sugar barrels. The wholesale price\r\n    of quahaugs for many years averaged 60 cents per bushel, but\r\n    in 1879 it fell to 55 cents. One dollar and seventy-five\r\n    cents is the average wholesale price per barrel. Quahaugs\r\n    retail in Wellfleet at 80 cents per bushel. The usual method\r\n    of transportation is by packet, at a cost of 25 cents per\r\n    barrel.[9]\r\n\r\n                     COMPARISON OF 1879 WITH 1907.\r\n\r\n  =========================+======================+======================\r\n                           |         1879.        |         1907.\r\n  -------------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Annual production,       |1,800,                |33,000.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Annual value,            |$990,                 |$41,250.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Average price per bushel,|55 cents,             |$1.25.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Number of men,           |5,                    |145.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Capital,                 |$800,                 |$25,950.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Market,                  |Boston and New York,  |New York, Boston,\r\n                           |                      |and other cities.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Season,                  |April 1 to October 1, |April 1 to October 1.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Boats,                   |5 sail boats,         |100 boats, one-third\r\n                           |                      |power, two-thirds\r\n                           |                      |sail.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Deepest water,           |8 feet,               |40 feet.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Longest rake,            |23 feet,              |47 feet.\r\n                           |                      |\r\n  Best quahaug beds,       |West side of harbor,  |Channel.\r\n  =========================+======================+======================\r\n\r\nFrom the account of Mr. Ingersoll the above table has been formulated,\r\nshowing the vast increase in the quahaug business of Wellfleet since\r\n1879, as well as certain changes in the industry. This by no means\r\nproves that the quahaug industry is on the increase; it merely shows\r\nthat it has taken a tremendous development since 1879, and the\r\nfact that the quahaug industry of Wellfleet has passed its maximum\r\nproduction a few years ago and is now on the decline should not be\r\noverlooked in consulting this table, which otherwise would give an\r\nerroneous impression. The changing of the quahaug grounds from shallow\r\nto deeper water alone is a sign of the decline of the industry. The\r\nquahaug industry has developed to its present extent only since 1894,\r\nand is comparatively recent. By the opening of the great beds of\r\n\"little necks\" and quahaugs in the channel and deep water the industry\r\nsuddenly became important.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            2,500\r\n  Number of men,                                  145\r\n  Number of power boats,                           38\r\n  Value of power boats,                       $14,000\r\n  Number of sail boats,                            62\r\n  Value of sail boats,                        $10,300\r\n  Value of implements,                         $3,200\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  5,500\r\n      Value,                                  $13,850\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 27,500\r\n      Value,                                  $27,500\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 33,000\r\n      Value,                                  $41,350\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yarmouth._\r\n\r\nThe quahaug grounds, which lie mostly in Bass River, are free to the\r\ninhabitants of Dennis and Yarmouth, as these two towns have common\r\nfishery rights. Quahaugs are found in four localities: (1) Bass River;\r\n(2) Mill Creek; (3) Barnstable Bar on the north shore; and (4) Lewis\r\nBay. The total area is 1,000 acres, which includes all grounds where\r\nthere are any quahaugs, as there are now no thick beds. The average\r\ndepth of water over the quahaug grounds is 4 feet.\r\n\r\nThe town law governing the quahaug fishery reads thus:--\r\n\r\n    All persons other than the inhabitants of the towns of Dennis\r\n    and Yarmouth are prohibited from taking clams and quahaugs from\r\n    the shores and waters of the town of Yarmouth. Inhabitants\r\n    of the Commonwealth not residents of Dennis and Yarmouth may\r\n    obtain permits of the selectmen to take sufficient quantity of\r\n    said shellfish for their family use.\r\n\r\nThe history of the quahaug industry of Yarmouth is one of decline. The\r\nindustry has existed for fifteen years, starting in 1892. Mr. Edgar N.\r\nBaker, who has been interested in the business ever since it started,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    In the last ten years it is safe to say that the catch has\r\n    fallen off fully 75 per cent., and nothing but the constant\r\n    advance in prices and lack of profitable employment has\r\n    prompted men to give their attention to this method of\r\n    obtaining their \"bread and butter.\" The most conservative\r\n    estimate would not put it below 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Area of quahaug territory (acres),            1,000\r\n  Number of men (transient),                       20\r\n  Number of boats,                                 --\r\n  Value of boats,                                  --\r\n  Number of skiffs,                                10\r\n  Value of skiffs,                               $100\r\n  Value of implements,                           $140\r\n\r\n                             _Production._\r\n\r\n  \"Little necks\":--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,200\r\n      Value,                                   $3,000\r\n  Quahaugs:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,000\r\n      Value,                                   $1,000\r\n  Total:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  2,200\r\n      Value,                                   $4,000\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] \"The Fisheries of Massachusetts,\" United States Fish Commission\r\nReport, Section II., p. 253.\r\n\r\n[8] Returns of Special Agent Wm.

United States Fish Commission Report, Section V.,\r\nVol. 2, p. 603.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALLOP (_Pecten irradians_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common shallow-water scallop is unknown commercially on the north\r\nshore, occurring only south of Boston. It is usually found in abundance\r\nalong the southern shore of Cape Cod, in Buzzards Bay, and about the\r\nislands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years investigations in regard to its growth, habits\r\nand culture have been carried on by the Commissioners on Fisheries and\r\nGame. These investigations are now practically completed. In another\r\nreport the whole life history of this bivalve will be given, showing\r\nthe application of this scientific study to the existing conditions of\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\nThe scallop fishery in Massachusetts is only a partial industry, as it\r\ndoes not concern the whole coast line, but merely the Vineyard Sound\r\nand Buzzards Bay shore. Compared with other States, the production of\r\nMassachusetts is favorable, New York alone exceeding it in output.\r\nThe southern coast of Massachusetts is especially adapted for this\r\nshellfish. Its bays, sheltered harbors and inlets afford excellent\r\nground for the scallop, which requires protection against the heavy\r\nseas. Thousands of acres of eel-grass flats from 1 to 60 feet under\r\nwater were formerly covered by beds of scallops, and in parts are still\r\nthickly set. While the extent of the scalloping area is large, only\r\nportions are ever productive at any one time. A set may be in one part\r\nthis year, and the next year's spawn may catch in a different place.\r\nThus, while all the ground is suitable for scallops, only a small part\r\nis in productive operation each year.\r\n\r\nWhile the possibilities of future development are not as alluring as\r\nin the other shellfisheries, yet much can be done to assist nature and\r\nhelp preserve the supply. Wise laws and well-directed efforts can save\r\nmany bushels of the young scallops which yearly die on the exposed\r\nflats where they have set in unfavorable places.\r\n\r\n_Scope of the Report._--The object of this report is to present certain\r\ninformation concerning the scallop industry which will be of use to\r\nthe scallop fishermen, and of interest to the general public and the\r\nconsumers. While the scallop is well known as an article of food, the\r\nmajority of people know little about the animal. It will therefore be\r\nnecessary in the following report to give brief descriptions of the\r\nvarious methods used in the capture of this bivalve, in order to make\r\nclear the more technical portions.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the report considers the general results of the\r\nsurvey, the history of the industry, the scallop laws, the methods of\r\nscalloping and the statistics of the industry. The second part gives a\r\nmore detailed description, the following points being considered under\r\neach town: (1) survey; (2) statistics of industry; (3) town laws; (4)\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Work._--Several difficulties stand in the way of procuring\r\nexact information concerning the scallop industry, especially in regard\r\nto historical data which should show the improvement or decline of the\r\nfishery. The town records are incomplete, lost, or furnish but slight\r\ninformation. Little has been written about this industry, and we were\r\nthus forced to rely upon the scallopers for information concerning the\r\nhistory and former production of each town. Fortunately, the scallop\r\nindustry is of recent origin (thirty years), and the information is\r\nvery nearly correct. By the use of town records, market reports,\r\nrecords of express shipments, personal surveys and estimates by the\r\nvarious scallopers, and by all other methods at our command, the facts\r\nof the last few years have been obtained in an approximately correct\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe area of the scallop territory was obtained by personal inspection\r\nand calculated by plottings on the maps. In designating the area\r\nsuitable for scallops in any town by a certain number of acres or\r\nby plottings on the map, it does not mean that scallops are found\r\neach year over all this territory. Allowances must be made for the\r\nuncertainty of the scallop supply. Some years there will be no\r\nscallops; in other years, plenty. Even when scallops are plentiful,\r\nthey rarely cover the whole territory, but are found only in certain\r\nparts in different years. The designation of an area as scallop\r\nterritory means that scallops have been found in the past over this\r\nterritory, and that the natural conditions of the territory appear\r\nfavorable for scallops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Decline._\r\n\r\nThe most important questions which first come to mind when considering\r\nthe scallop industry of to-day are these three: (1) Has there been any\r\ndecline in the industry? If so, how extensive? (2) What are the causes\r\nof the decline? (3) How can the fishery be improved?\r\n\r\nI. _Extent of the Decline._--There is no question but that the industry\r\nas a whole has declined. This decline has made itself manifest,\r\nespecially in certain localities, _e.g._, Buzzards Bay, where until\r\n1907 the entire fishery, except at New Bedford and Fairhaven, had been\r\ntotally extinct for the past seven years.\r\n\r\nAlong the south side of Cape Cod, at Edgartown and Nantucket, the\r\nsupply has on the average remained the same. Of course there is varying\r\nabundance each year, but as a whole the industry in these localities\r\ncan hardly be said to have declined.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, on the north side of Cape Cod we find a marked\r\ndecline. A scallop fishery no longer exists at Plymouth, Barnstable\r\nharbor, Wellfleet and Provincetown, though twenty-five years ago these\r\nplaces boasted of a valuable industry.\r\n\r\nSo we have to-day in Massachusetts three localities, two of which show\r\na marked decline in the scallop fishery, while the other shows some\r\nimprovement. Of the two depleted areas, the one (north of the Cape) may\r\nnever revive the industry; the other (Buzzards Bay) gives indications\r\nthat the industry can once more be put on a very profitable footing.\r\nThe only thing necessary is perpetual precaution on the part of the\r\nfishermen, in order to prevent this decline. Massachusetts must not\r\nallow the industry to become extinct, as in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nII. _Causes of the Decline._--The causes of the decline of this\r\nindustry can be grouped under three heads: (1) natural enemies; (2)\r\noverfishing by man; (3) adverse physical conditions.\r\n\r\nThe natural enemy of the scallop which works the greatest mischief is\r\nthe starfish, or \"five finger,\" as it is often called. The starfish\r\ndestroys the scallop in the same manner as it attacks the oyster. The\r\ndecline of the scallop fishery in Buzzards Bay is attributed by the\r\nfishermen to the inroads of this pest. Undoubtedly the starfish was\r\nthe chief apparent cause, since, according to report, dredges full of\r\nstarfish could be hauled up. In other localities in Massachusetts the\r\nstarfish has not been so plentiful.\r\n\r\nWhile the main cause of the decline of the natural clam, quahaug and\r\noyster beds is overfishing by man, the decline of the scallop fishery\r\ncannot be so considered. The scallop has a short life, hardly 25\r\nper cent. passing the two-year limit; so it does no harm to capture\r\nthe marketable scallops which are over sixteen months old, as the\r\nscallop spawns when one year old, and dies a natural death usually\r\nbefore it reaches a second spawning season. When only old scallops\r\nare taken, as is generally the case, it is probably _impossible_\r\nfor man to exterminate the scallops by _overfishing_. Unfortunately,\r\nin certain localities in the past there has been a large capture of\r\nthe \"seed\" scallop, viz., the scallop less than one year old, which\r\nhas not spawned. This has worked the ruin of the scalloping in these\r\nlocalities. The capture of the spawners for another year merely makes\r\nthe next year's set so much smaller, and causes a rapid decline.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it is hardly profitable to catch the \"seed\" scallop, owing\r\nto its small size. But a direct relation can be established between a\r\nhigh market price and the capture of seed. When the market price is\r\nhigh and scallops scarce, it becomes profitable to catch the young\r\n\"seed.\" The present scallop law now defines a \"seed\" scallop, and\r\nforbids its capture. By protecting the \"seed\" scallop the State has\r\ndone all that at present appears expedient to insure the future of the\r\nindustry; the rest lies in the hands of the towns.\r\n\r\nSo, while the scallop has declined in certain localities, and the\r\ndecline has been hastened by unwise capture of the \"seed\" scallop,\r\nthe main decline of the fishery cannot be attributed to wholesale\r\noverfishing, as it is impossible to overfish if only the old scallops\r\n(over one year old) are taken; for, unlike most other animals, the\r\nscallop usually breeds but once, and its natural period of life is\r\nunusually brief. These scallops, if not taken, will die, and prove a\r\ntotal loss; so every fisherman should bear in mind that, as long as the\r\n\"seed\" scallops are protected, severe fishing of large scallops is not\r\nlikely to injure the future scallop industry.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes of the decline of the fishery, besides the inroads\r\nof man, are best termed \"adverse physical conditions.\" Severe winters,\r\nstorms, anchor frost, etc., work destruction upon the hapless scallop.\r\nThe \"infant mortality\" is especially great.\r\n\r\nAs the scallop dies before reaching its second birthday, only one set\r\nof scallops spawn in any one season. There are never two generations of\r\nscallops spawning at one time. I quote from Ernest Ingersoll in this\r\nconnection:--\r\n\r\n    This represents a case where the generations follow one another\r\n    so rapidly that there are never two ranks, or generations,\r\n    in condition to reproduce their kind at once, except in\r\n    rare individual instances, since all, or nearly all, of the\r\n    old ones die before the young ones have grown old enough\r\n    to spawn. If such a state of affairs exists, of course any\r\n    sudden catastrophe, such as a great and cold storm during the\r\n    winter, or the covering of the water where they lie for a long\r\n    period with a sheet of ice, happening to kill all the tender\r\n    young (and old ones, too, often) in a particular district,\r\n    will exterminate the breed there; since, even if the older\r\n    and tougher ones survive this shock, they will not live long\r\n    enough, or at any rate, will be unable to spawn again, and so\r\n    start a new generation.[10]\r\n\r\nThe set of young scallops is abundant in shallow water upon the\r\neel-grass flats, which often, as is the case of the Common Flats at\r\nChatham, are exposed at extremely low tides. A severe winter often\r\nkills off all the \"seed\" thus exposed. In this case no spawn is\r\nobtained the following summer, causing the suppression of the scallop\r\nfishery in that locality for at least a few years, and possibly its\r\npermanent extinction.\r\n\r\nIII. _Improvement; restocking Barren Areas._--The scallop industry,\r\nunlike the clam and quahaug, offers but little inducement to private\r\nenterprise. For successful private culture small bays or coves would be\r\nneeded, and suitable areas are very scarce. The scallop offers better\r\nopportunity for communal culture, _i.e._, by towns.\r\n\r\nThere is but one way now known of artificial propagation for the\r\nscallop industry, and that is by transplanting in the fall the abundant\r\nset from the exposed places to the deeper water before the seed is\r\nkilled by the winter. It is merely assisting nature by preventing a\r\nnatural loss, and in no sense can properly be termed propagation. It\r\nis merely a preventive, and money used in this way to preserve the\r\nscallops is well expended. Usually the set is abundant, and can be\r\ntransferred in large numbers. This is the only practical method now\r\nknown of increasing our scallop supply, though it is hoped in the\r\nfuture that other methods may be devised.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the above comes the question, if we can thus\r\npreserve scallops doomed to destruction, will it not be profitable\r\nto transplant scallops to places where the scalloping has been\r\nexterminated by various causes, and by means of these \"seeders\" furnish\r\nsucceeding generations which may populate the barren areas? This plan\r\nis practical and feasible, and should be given due consideration. Why\r\nshould not scallops be transplanted to our Buzzards Bay harbors, to\r\nagain restock these areas? Often the attempt might fail, but there is\r\nbound to be success if there is perseverance. The best time to plant\r\nthese scallops is in the fall, as a double service will be given: (1)\r\npreservation from destruction of the seed scallops; (2) furnishing\r\nspawn and young in the barren locality. Ingersoll speaks of the\r\nrestocking of Oyster Bay in 1880:--\r\n\r\n    In the spring of 1880 eel grass came into the bay, bringing\r\n    young scallops [the eel grass carries the scallops attached to\r\n    it by the thread-like byssus]; thus the abundance of that year\r\n    was accounted for, though there had not been a crop before in\r\n    that bay since 1874.\r\n\r\nIf such a restocking can be accomplished by nature, it can be done with\r\nmore certain effect with man's assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Industry._\r\n\r\nI. _The Methods._--The methods of scalloping follow the historical\r\nrise of the fishery. As the industry grew more and more important,\r\nimprovements became necessary in the methods of capture, and thus,\r\nparallel with the development of the industry, we can trace a\r\ncorresponding development in the implements used in the capture of the\r\nscallop.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Gathering by Hand._--When the scallop was first used as an\r\narticle of food, the primitive method of gathering this bivalve by hand\r\nwas used. This method still exists on the flats of Brewster, and often\r\nin other localities after heavy gales wagons can be driven to the beach\r\nand loaded with the scallops which have been blown ashore.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Scoop Nets._--This hand method was not rapid enough for the\r\nenterprising scallopers, and the next step in the industry was the\r\nuse of scoop nets, about 8 inches in diameter, by which the scallops\r\ncould be picked up in the water. These nets were attached to poles\r\nof various lengths, suitable to the depth of water. \"This method,\"\r\nwrites Ingersoll, \"was speedily condemned, however, because it could be\r\nemployed only where scallops are a foot thick and inches in length, as\r\none fisherman expressed it.\"\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Pusher._--The next invention was the so-called \"pusher.\" The\r\n\"pusher\" consists of a wooden pole from 8 to 9 feet long, attached to\r\na rectangular iron frame 3 by 1½ feet, upon which is fitted a netting\r\nbag 3 feet in depth. The scalloper, wading on the flats at low tide,\r\ngathers the scallops by shoving the \"pusher\" among the eel grass. When\r\nthe bag is full, the contents are emptied into the dory and the process\r\nrepeated. The scallopers who use the \"pusher\" go in dories, which are\r\ntaken to the various parts of the scalloping ground and moved whenever\r\nthe immediate locality is exhausted. This method is in use to-day,\r\nbut is applicable only to shallow flats, and can be worked only at\r\nlow tide, where dredging is impossible. It is hard work, and not as\r\nprofitable as the better method of dredging. This method of scalloping\r\nis used chiefly at Chatham, Dennis and Yarmouth; occasionally it is\r\nused at Nantucket and other towns.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Dredging._--The greater part of the scallop catch is taken by\r\ndredging, which is the most universal as well as the most profitable\r\nmethod. The dredge, commonly pronounced \"drudge,\" consists of an iron\r\nframework about 3 by 1½ feet, with a netting bag attached, which will\r\nhold from one to two bushels of scallops. Cat boats, carrying from 6 to\r\n10 dredges, are used for this method of scalloping. These boats, with\r\nseveral \"reefs,\" cross the scallop grounds pulling the dredges, which\r\nhold the boat steady in her course. A single run with all the dredges\r\noverboard is called a \"drift.\" The contents of all the dredges is said\r\nto be the result or catch of the \"drift.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the dredges are hauled in they are emptied on what is known as\r\na culling board. This board runs the width of the boat, projecting\r\nslightly on both sides. It is 3 feet wide, and has a guide 3 inches\r\nhigh along each side, leaving the ends open. The scallops are then\r\nseparated from the rubbish, such as seaweed, shells, mud, etc., while\r\nthe refuse and seed scallops are thrown overboard by merely pushing\r\nthem off the end of the board. Each catch is culled out while the\r\ndredges are being pulled along on the back \"drift,\" and the board is\r\nagain clear for the next catch. The culled scallops are first put in\r\nbuckets and later transferred either to bushel bags or dumped into the\r\ncockpit of the boat.\r\n\r\nTwo men are usually required to tend from 6 to 8 dredges in a large\r\ncat boat, but often one man alone does all the work. This seems to be\r\nconfined to localities, as at Nantucket nearly all the cat boats have\r\ntwo men. At Edgartown the reverse is true, one man to the boat, though\r\nin power dredging two men are always used.\r\n\r\nSeveral styles of dredges are used in scalloping, as each locality has\r\nits own special kind, which is best adapted to the scalloping bottom of\r\nthat region. Four different styles are used in Massachusetts, two of\r\nwhich permit a subdivision, making in all six different forms. Each of\r\nthese dredges is said by the scallopers using them to be the best; but\r\nfor all-round work the \"scraper\" seems the most popular.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Chatham or Box Dredge._--As this dredge was first used in\r\nChatham, the name of the town was given to it, to distinguish it from\r\nthe other styles. At the present time its use is confined to Chatham\r\nand the neighboring towns of the Cape. With the exception of a very few\r\nused at Nantucket, it is not found elsewhere in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe style of the box dredge is peculiar, consisting of a rectangular\r\nframework, 27 by 12 inches, of flat iron 1 by ¼ inches, with an\r\noval-shaped iron bar extending back as a support for the netting\r\nbag, which is attached to the rectangular frame. To the side of the\r\nrectangular frame is attached a heavy iron chain about 4 feet long, to\r\nwhich is fastened the drag rope.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Scraper._--As can be seen by the illustration, this style of\r\ndredge consists of a rigid iron frame of triangular shape, which has a\r\ncurve of nearly 90° at the base, to form the bowl of the dredge. Above,\r\na raised cross bar connects the two arms, while at the bottom of the\r\ndredge a strip of iron 2 inches wide extends from arm to arm. This\r\nstrip acts as a scraping blade, and is set at an angle so as to dig\r\ninto the bottom. The top of the net is fastened to the raised cross bar\r\nand the lower part to the blade.\r\n\r\nThe usual dimensions of the dredge are: arms, 2½ feet; upper cross bar,\r\n2 feet; blade, 2½ feet. The net varies in size, usually holding about a\r\nbushel of scallops, and running from 2 to 3 feet in length. Additional\r\nweights can be put on the cross bar when the scalloper desires the\r\ndredge to scrape deeper. A wooden bar, 2 feet long, buoys the net.\r\n\r\nTwo styles of this dredge are in use. At Nantucket the whole net is\r\nmade of twine, while at Edgartown and in Buzzards Bay the lower part of\r\nthe net is formed of a netting of iron rings, the upper half of the net\r\nbeing twine. The iron rings are supposed to stand the wear better than\r\nthe twine netting. This difference seems to be merely a matter of local\r\nchoice. The \"scraper\" is perhaps the dredge most generally used, as, no\r\nmatter what style is in use, a scalloper generally has a few \"scrapers\"\r\namong his dredges.\r\n\r\n(3) _The \"Slider.\"_--The principle of the \"slider\" is the reverse of\r\nthe \"scraper,\" as the blade is set either level or with an upward\r\nincline, so the dredge can slide over the bottom. This dredge is used\r\non rough bottom and in places where there is little eel-grass. In some\r\ndredges the blade is rigid, but in the majority the blade hangs loose.\r\n\r\nThe \"slider\" used at Edgartown differs from the \"scraper\" by having\r\nperfectly straight arms and no curved bowl, the blade being fastened\r\nto the arms in a hook-and-eye fashion. The dimensions of this dredge\r\nare the same as those of the \"scraper,\" although occasionally smaller\r\ndredges are found.\r\n\r\n(4) _The \"Roller\" Dredge._--This style of dredge is used only in\r\nthe town of Mattapoisett, where the scallopers claim it is the most\r\nsuccessful. The dredge is suitable for scalloping over rough ground, as\r\nthe blade of the dredge is merely a line of leads, which roll over the\r\nsurface of the ground gathering in the scallops.\r\n\r\nThe dredge consists of an oval iron frame, 32 by 20 inches, which acts\r\nas the arms, and is attached to another iron frame, 32 by 3 inches. The\r\nblade of the dredge consists of a thin rope with attached leads. The\r\nnet is made wholly of twine, and is about 2½ feet long.\r\n\r\n_Scalloping with Power Boats._--The season of 1907 has witnessed in\r\nMassachusetts the first use of auxiliary power in the scallop fishery.\r\nAt Edgartown the main part of the scalloping is now done by power,\r\nwhich, in spite of the additional expense of 5 gallons of gasolene per\r\nday, gives a proportionately larger catch of scallops. The Edgartown\r\nscallopers claim that their daily catch, using power, is from one-third\r\nto one-half better than under the old method of dredging by sail.\r\nNot only can they scallop when the wind is too light or too heavy\r\nfor successful scalloping by sail, but more \"drifts\" can be made in\r\nthe same time. A slight disadvantage of scalloping with power is the\r\nnecessity of having two men, as the steering of the power boat demands\r\nmuch closer attention than the sail boat, which is practically held to\r\na fixed course by the dredges. A power boat for scalloping possesses\r\nonly the disadvantage of additional cost; but it is only necessary\r\nto look forward a few years, when expedition rather than cheapness\r\nwill be in demand, to a partial revolution in the present methods of\r\nscalloping, whereby the auxiliary cat boat will take the place of the\r\nsail boat in the scallop fishery.\r\n\r\nII. _Preparing the Scallop for Market._ (1) _The \"Eye.\"_--The edible\r\npart of the scallop is the large adductor muscle. The rest of the\r\nanimal is thrown away, though in certain localities it is used as fish\r\nbait and in others for fertilizer. Why the whole of the animal is not\r\neaten is hard to say. Undoubtedly all is good, but popular prejudice,\r\nwhich molds opinion, has decreed that it is bad, so it is not used as\r\nfood. This is perhaps due to the highly pigmented and colored portions\r\nof the animal. Nevertheless, there is a decided possibility that in\r\nthe future we shall eat the entire scallop, as well as the luscious\r\nadductor muscle.\r\n\r\nThe adductor muscle is called by the dealers and fishermen the \"eye,\" a\r\nname given perhaps from its important position in the animal, and its\r\nappearance. The color of the \"eye,\" which has a cylindrical form, is a\r\nyellowish white.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Shanties._--The catch of scallops is carried to the shanty of\r\nthe fisherman, and there opened. These shanties are usually grouped\r\non the dock, so the catch can be readily transferred. Inside of these\r\nshanties, usually 20 by 10 feet or larger, we find a large bench 3 to\r\n3½ feet wide, running the length of the shanty, and a little more than\r\nwaist high. On these benches the scallops are dumped from the baskets\r\nor bags, and pass through the hands of the openers. Under the bench are\r\nbarrels for the shells and refuse.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Openers._--The openers are usually men and boys, though\r\noccasionally a few women try their hand at the work. Of late years\r\nthere has been a difficulty in obtaining sufficient openers, and the\r\nscallopers often are forced to open their own scallops. The openers\r\nare paid from 20 to 30 cents per gallon, according to the size of the\r\nscallops. One bushel of average scallops will open 2½ to 3 quarts of\r\n\"eyes.\" An opener can often open 8 to 10 gallons in a day, making an\r\nexcellent day's work. The price now paid is more than double that paid\r\nin 1880, which was 12½ cents per gallon. Some openers are especially\r\nrapid, and their deft movements cause a continual dropping of shells in\r\nthe barrel and \"eyes\" in the gallon measure.\r\n\r\n(4) _Method of opening the Scallop._--The opening of a scallop requires\r\nthree movements. A flat piece of steel with a sharp but rounded end,\r\ninserted in a wooden handle, answers for a knife. The scallop is taken\r\nby a right-handed opener in the palm of the left hand, the hinge\r\nline farthest away from the body, the scallop in its natural resting\r\nposition, the right or smooth valve down. The knife is inserted between\r\nthe valves on the right-hand side. An upward turn with a cutting motion\r\nis given, severing the \"eye\" from the upper valve, while a flirt at the\r\nsame moment throws back the upper shell. The second motion tears the\r\nsoft rim and visceral mass of the scallop and casts it into the barrel,\r\nleaving the \"eye\" standing clear. A third movement separates the \"eye\"\r\nfrom the shell and casts it into a gallon measure. Frequently the last\r\ntwo movements are slightly different. The faster openers at the second\r\nmotion merely tear off enough of the rim to allow the separation of the\r\n\"eye\" from the shell, and on the third movement cast the \"eye\" in the\r\nmeasure, while the shell with its adhering soft parts is thrown into\r\nthe refuse barrel. These last two motions can hardly be separated, so\r\nquickly are they accomplished.\r\n\r\n(5) _\"Soaking.\"_--The \"eye\" is then usually put through the following\r\ncourse of treatment before marketing; the treatment is what is\r\nfamiliarly known as \"soaking.\" It has been noticed that whenever salt\r\nwater products are allowed to soak in fresh water, an increase of bulk\r\nis found. This is due to a change, called osmosis, which causes the\r\nswelling of the tissues. The \"eye\" can be increased, by the process\r\nof osmosis, to a gain of more than one-third its natural size; that\r\nis, 4½ gallons of scallop \"eyes\" can be increased to 7 gallons by\r\njudicious \"feeding\" with fresh water. Also, a change has taken place\r\nin the scallops after a few hours' soaking. No longer do we find the\r\npoor yellow-colored small \"eye\" of the freshly opened scallop, but a\r\nbeautiful white, plump \"eye,\" which at once tempts the purchaser. While\r\nthese changes have added to the salable properties of the scallop by\r\nbeautifying its appearance and increasing its size, the scallop has\r\nlost much of its sweet flavor and freshness.\r\n\r\nPractically every scallop sold in the markets or shipped from any\r\nscalloping center is soaked, as the \"soaking,\" if not already done\r\nby the fishermen, is administered by the retail dealers. There\r\nare scallopers who are ready to ship the unsoaked scallops at a\r\nproportionate price the moment the market demands them; but the\r\nconsumer, through ignorance, demands the large, nice-appearing \"eyes,\"\r\nand thus unwittingly favors the practice. However, as long as pure\r\nwater is used and other sanitary precautions taken, no actual harm may\r\narise from soaking scallops.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of swelling scallops are in use. When the scallops are\r\nshipped in kegs, which usually contain 7 gallons, the following method\r\nis applied: 4½ to 5 gallons of \"eyes\" are placed in each keg, and are\r\nallowed to stand over night in fresh water; in the morning before\r\nshipment more water is added and the keg closed, and by the time of\r\narrival to the New York or Boston market the scallops have increased to\r\nthe full amount of 7 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe second method of \"soaking\" is slightly more elaborate. The eyes are\r\nspread evenly in shallow wooden sinks 5 by 3 feet, with just enough\r\nfresh water to cover them, and left over night. In the morning a milky\r\nfluid is drawn off, and the \"soaked\" scallops are packed for market in\r\nkegs or butter tubs.\r\n\r\n(6) _Shipment._--The kegs in which the scallops are shipped cost 30\r\ncents apiece, and contain about 7 gallons. A full keg is known as a\r\n\"package.\" The butter tubs are less expensive, but hold only 4 to 5\r\ngallons. Indeed, anything which will hold scallops for shipment is used\r\nto send them to market.\r\n\r\nWhen the scallops get to the market they are strained and weighed, 9\r\npounds being considered the weight of a gallon of meats. In this way\r\nabout 6 gallons are realized from every 7-gallon keg. With the improved\r\nmethods of modern times scallops can be shipped far west or be held\r\nfor months in cold storage, for which purpose unsoaked scallops are\r\nrequired. Certain firms have tried this method of keeping the catch\r\nuntil prices were high, but it has not been especially successful.\r\n\r\n(7) _Market._--One of the greatest trials to the scallop fisherman is\r\nthe uncertainty of market returns when shipping. He does not know the\r\nprice he is to receive; and, as the price depends on the supply on the\r\nmarket, he may receive high wages or he may get scarcely anything. The\r\nwholesale market alone can regulate the price, and the fisherman is\r\npowerless. While this is hard on the scalloper, it does not appear that\r\nat the present time anything can be done to remedy the uncertainty of\r\nreturn. The scallop returns from the New York market are usually higher\r\nthan from the Boston market. The result of this has been to give New\r\nYork each year the greater part of the scallop trade, and practically\r\nall the Nantucket and Edgartown scallops are shipped to New York.\r\n\r\nEither from a feeling of loyalty, or because the market returns are\r\nsooner forwarded, or because the express charges are less, Cape Cod\r\nstill ships to the Boston market, in spite of the better prices offered\r\nin New York. Why so many Cape scallopers should continue to ship to\r\nBoston, and resist the attractions of better prices, is impossible to\r\ndetermine, and appears to be only a question of custom.\r\n\r\n(8) _The Price._--The price of scallops varies with the supply. The\r\ndemand is fairly constant, showing a slight but decided increase each\r\nyear. On the other hand, the supply is irregular, some years scallops\r\nbeing plentiful, in other years scarce.\r\n\r\n_The Maine or Deep-sea Scallop._--In the Boston market the\r\nshallow-water scallop has a formidable rival in the giant scallop of\r\nthe Maine coast, which is nearly twice as large. Nevertheless, the Cape\r\nscallop maintains its superiority and still leads its larger brother in\r\npopular favor, wholesaling at 50 to 70 cents more a gallon. There is no\r\ndoubt that this competition has had a tendency to lower the price of\r\nthe Cape scallop, possibly accounting for the higher market price in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n_Outfit of a Scalloper._--While we have traced the scallop from its\r\ncapture among the eel-grass to its final disposition, we have not\r\nconsidered the equipment of the scalloper. The average capital invested\r\nin the business can best be summed up under these two heads,--the boat\r\nfisherman and the dory fisherman.\r\n\r\n                   _Boat Fisherman._\r\n  Boat,                                       $500.00\r\n  Dory,                                         20.00\r\n  Six dredges,                                  25.00\r\n  Rope and gear,                                25.00\r\n  Culling board,                                 2.00\r\n  Incidentals,                                   3.00\r\n  Shanty,                                       50.00\r\n                                              -------\r\n     Total,                                   $625.00\r\n                   _Dory Fisherman._\r\n  Dory,                                        $20.00\r\n  Oars,                                          1.50\r\n  Pusher,                                        2.50\r\n  Shanty,                                       25.00\r\n                                              -------\r\n    Total,                                     $49.00\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Scallop Season._--There is considerable diversity of opinion\r\namong the scallopers as to when the scallop season should open. Some\r\nadvocate November 1 as the opening date, instead of October 1, as the\r\npresent law reads; and many arguments are put forth by both sides.\r\n\r\nThe class of fishermen who desire November 1 are those who are engaged\r\nin other fishing during the month of October, and either have to give\r\nit up or lose the first month of scalloping. Naturally, they wish a\r\nchange, putting forth the additional argument of better prices if the\r\nseason begins later. The scalloper who is not engaged in other fishing\r\nof course desires the law to remain as it is at the present time,\r\nclaiming that the better weather of October gives easier work, more\r\nworking days, and allows no chance of loss if the winter is severe.\r\n\r\nUnder the present law, the town can regulate the opening of its season\r\nto suit the demands of the market and the desire of the inhabitants.\r\nThis does away with the necessity of any State law on this point,\r\nwhich, under the present system of town control, would be inadvisable.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion of the fishermen is in favor of the present date,\r\nOctober 1. As nearly as could be determined, about 75 per cent. favor\r\nOctober 1 and 25 per cent. November 1. This sentiment is divided by\r\nlocalities, as more men were in favor of November 1 at Nantucket and\r\nEdgartown than on Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay, where very few favored a\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nIV. _The Utilization of Waste._--While it seems an enormous waste that\r\nout of a bushel of scallops only 2½ to 3 quarts of edible meats are\r\nobtained, it is not all absolute loss. Oyster growers buy the shells\r\nfor cultch to catch the oyster seed, paying from 3 to 5 cents per\r\nbushel. Other uses are found, such as ornaments and in making shell\r\nroads. The refuse is used for fish bait, and often barrels of it are\r\nsalted for this purpose. It is also used in some places for manure for\r\nagricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the last year a new use for scallop shells has developed. Similar to\r\nthe souvenir postal card, scallop shells bound together with ribbon\r\nand containing miniature photographic views have been put on the\r\nmarket. Three firms near Boston make a business of this, and use only\r\nthe lower or bright valve of the scallop. Certain scallopers furnish\r\nthese scallop shells, cleaned of meat, at the rate of $6 per barrel;\r\nand, though it takes considerable time to separate the shells when\r\nopening, the excellent price makes this new industry pay. The question\r\nof the future is to find new and more important uses for our waste sea\r\nproducts. Some day what is now waste in the scallop industry may be\r\nutilized for the benefit of the public.\r\n\r\nV. _Food Value._--As a food the scallop stands ahead of all the other\r\nshellfish, containing much more nourishment than the oyster. The\r\nfollowing figures are from the tables of Professor Atwater, rearranged\r\nby C. F. Langworthy:[11]--\r\n\r\n                  (All values expressed as per cent.)\r\n\r\n  ==============================+=========+======+=======+=========+=====\r\n                                | Refuse, | Salt | Water | Protein | Fat\r\n                                | Bone,   |      |       |         |\r\n                                | Skin,   |      |       |         |\r\n                                |  etc.   |      |       |         |\r\n  ------------------------------+---------+------+-------+---------+-----\r\n  Oysters, solids,              |      -- |   -- |  88.3 |     6.1 | 1.4\r\n  Oysters, in shell,            |    82.3 |   -- |  15.4 |     1.1 |  .2\r\n  Oysters, canned,              |      -- |   -- |  85.3 |     7.4 | 2.1\r\n  Scallops,                     |      -- |   -- |  80.3 |    14.7 |  .2\r\n  Soft clams, in shell,         |    43.6 |   -- |  48.4 |     4.8 |  .6\r\n  Soft clams, canned,           |      -- |   -- |  84.5 |     9.0 | 1.3\r\n  Quahaugs, removed from shell, |      -- |   -- |  80.8 |    10.6 | 1.1\r\n  Quahaugs, in shell,           |    68.3 |   -- |  27.3 |     2.1 |  .1\r\n  Quahaugs, canned,             |      -- |   -- |  83.0 |    10.4 |  .8\r\n  Mussels,                      |    49.3 |   -- |  42.7 |     4.4 |  .5\r\n  General average of mollusks   |    60.2 |   -- |  34.0 |     3.2 |  .4\r\n    (exclusive of canned).      |         |      |       |         |\r\n  ==============================+=========+======+=======+=========+=====\r\n\r\n                  (All values expressed as per cent.)\r\n\r\n  ==============================+=========+=========+===========+=======\r\n                                |Carbohy- | Mineral | Total     | Fuel\r\n                                | drates  | Matter  | Nutrients | Value\r\n                                |         |         |           | per\r\n                                |         |         |           | Pound\r\n  ------------------------------+---------+---------+-----------+-------\r\n  Oysters, solids,              |     3.3 |      .9 |      11.7 |  235\r\n  Oysters, in shell,            |      .6 |      .4 |       2.3 |   40\r\n  Oysters, canned,              |     3.9 |     1.3 |      14.7 |  300\r\n  Scallops,                     |     3.4 |     1.4 |      19.7 |  345\r\n  Soft clams, in shell,         |     1.1 |     1.5 |       8.0 |  135\r\n  Soft clams, canned,           |     2.9 |     2.3 |      15.5 |  275\r\n  Quahaugs, removed from shell, |     5.2 |     2.3 |      19.2 |  340\r\n  Quahaugs, in shell,           |     1.3 |      .9 |       4.4 |   65\r\n  Quahaugs, canned,             |     3.0 |     2.8 |      17.0 |  285\r\n  Mussels,                      |     2.1 |     1.0 |       8.0 |  140\r\n  General average of mollusks   |     1.3 |      .9 |       5.8 |  100\r\n    (exclusive of canned).      |         |         |           |\r\n  ==============================+=========+=========+===========+======\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Laws._\r\n\r\nThe State laws regulating the fishery were made for the benefit of the\r\nindustry and for the preservation of the \"seed\" scallop, which is the\r\nonly requirement necessary for insuring the future supply.\r\n\r\nEach town has charge over its scallop fishery, under the general\r\nshellfish act of 1880, which entrusted all regulation of the\r\nshellfisheries to the selectmen of the towns. The town laws governing\r\nthe scallop fishery are by far the most satisfactory of the shellfish\r\nlaws of the towns. Although in many respects beneficial, they have\r\ncertain disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe main disadvantage of the town laws is found in the jealousy of\r\nneighboring towns. One town may make a law to oppose another town, and\r\nwill often injure its own interests thereby. In this connection the\r\ncondition at Dennis, during the winter of 1904-05, was an instance. As\r\nscallops were remarkably abundant, the town made by-laws intended to\r\nexclude from its scallop fisheries the residents of other towns. At\r\nthe close of the scalloping season, when the ice came, the scallops\r\nwere still abundant. The inhabitants of the town thought they could\r\nget the rest next season. They did not know that the scallop does not\r\nlive two years. The next year not a single scallop of that set was to\r\nbe found; they had died. If other scallopers had been allowed to go\r\nthere, thousands of dollars could have been saved, and many scallopers\r\ngiven employment. This one case illustrates the disadvantages of town\r\njealousy; and Dennis is by no means to blame, as it merely protected\r\nitself against the similar restrictions of neighboring Cape Cod towns.\r\n\r\nThe town laws which benefit the scallop industry are made each year\r\naccording to the condition of the industry. Edgartown and Nantucket\r\nhave perhaps the best-governed scallop industries. Laws requiring\r\nlicenses, regulating the opening of the season and restricting at\r\nproper times the catch, so as to get the best market prices instead of\r\noverstocking the market when the prices are low, are to be recommended\r\non account of their benefit to the scallopers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History._\r\n\r\nIn considering the rise of a fishing industry, it is often difficult\r\nto state exactly the year when the industry started, as there are\r\ndifferences of opinion as to how large a fishery should be before it\r\ncould be justly considered an industry. The scallop fishery has existed\r\nfor years, but did not become an established industry of the State\r\nbefore the year 1872. At that time there was hardly any demand for\r\nscallops, and the catch was with difficulty marketed. Since then the\r\nmarket demand for the scallop has steadily increased, until the supply\r\ncan hardly meet the popular demand. It seems almost incredible that\r\nthe scallop as an article of food should once have been scorned and\r\npractically unknown.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of 1876 and 1877 the industry took a sudden spurt. At\r\nthis time the introduction of the dredge on Cape Cod revolutionized\r\nthe industry, and made it possible to open up the deep-water fields.\r\nThe industry on Cape Cod first started at Hyannis, where a number of\r\nmen entered the new business; and for several years the production\r\nincreased rapidly, with the opening of new territories and improved\r\nmethods of capture. While the natural supply has remained the same or\r\ndeclined in certain localities, as has been shown in a previous part of\r\nthis report, the value of the industry, in regard to the number of men\r\nengaged and capital invested, has steadily increased.\r\n\r\n               SCALLOP PRODUCTION FOR MASSACHUSETTS.[12]\r\n\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n         YEAR.       |  Bushels. |   Value. |  Gallons. |    Price\r\n                     |           |          |           |  per Gallon.\r\n  -------------------+-----------+----------+-----------+--------------\r\n  1879,              |    10,542 |   $3,514 |     7,028 |        $0.50\r\n  1887,              |    41,964 |   38,933 |    27,976 |         1.39\r\n  1888,              |    26,168 |   43,202 |    17,446 |         2.48\r\n  1898,              |   128,863 |   85,383 |    85,908 |         0.99\r\n  1902,              |    66,150 |   89,982 |    44,100 |         2.04\r\n  1905,              |    43,872 |   98,712 |    29,248 |         3.37½\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n\r\nThese figures show that the price of scallops varies greatly, dependent\r\nlargely upon the amount caught that season; also that there has been,\r\nin spite of the irregularity of the catch, a gradual rise in prices\r\nsince 1879, due to a more extensive market.\r\n\r\nIn considering the scallop industry the following points should be\r\nnoted: (1) It has been necessary to record as scallop area any grounds\r\nwhere scallops have ever been found, in spite of the fact that only a\r\nportion of this total area is in any one year productive. (2) The boats\r\nengaged in the scallop fishery are but transitory capital, which is\r\nutilized, outside of the scallop season, in other fisheries. (3) The\r\nquahaug and scallop fisheries in many towns supplement each other, as\r\nthe same men and boats are engaged in both industries. (4) The length\r\nof the season varies in the different localities. In New Bedford and\r\nFairhaven the scallops are mostly caught in a few weeks, as many boats\r\nenter the business temporarily. This necessarily gives an excess of\r\ninvested capital and a small production. In these two towns the number\r\nof scallop licenses are recorded as showing the number of men engaged\r\nin the fishery, while as a fact but a small part of these are steadily\r\nengaged in the industry.\r\n\r\n    Key: N= Number\r\n\r\n  ============+======+============+==========+=======+================+=======\r\n              |Number| Boats      |  Extra   | Value |   Production   |Area of\r\n              |  of  |            |  Dories  |  of   |    1907-08     |Scallop\r\n      TOWN    | Men  +---+--------+---+------+  Gear +-------+--------+Grounds\r\n              |      | N | Value  | N |Value |       |Gallons| Value  |(Acres)\r\n              +------+---+--------+---+------+-------+-------+--------+-------\r\n  Barnstable  | 39   | 23|  $8,000|  -|     -|   $575|  1,530|  $2,004|  2,800\r\n  Bourne      | 38   | 30|  15,000|  -|     -|  1,200| 12,000|  15,720|  3,000\r\n  Chatham     |107   | 35|  10,650| 61|$1,430|  1,185| 34,615|  45,345|  2,000\r\n  Dennis      | 30   |  9|   4,230|  9|   180|    368|  2,950|   3,865|  2,250\r\n  Edgartown   | 39   | 26|   8,000|  -|     -|    550| 17,000|  22,270|  2,000\r\n  Fairhaven   |73[13]| 50|  12,500|  -|     -|  1,500|  1,300|   1,703|  2,500\r\n  Harwich     | 12   |  7|   2,350|  -|     -|    280|  2,170|   2,843|  3,200\r\n  Marion      | 44   | 16|   5,300| 24|   250|    580|  7,000|   9,170|  1,500\r\n  Mattapoisett| 22   | 19|   6,900|  -|     -|    760|  5,000|   6,550|  1,200\r\n  Nantucket   | 99   | 47|  13,250| 20|   500|    700| 20,245|  26,539|  4,500\r\n  New Bedford |38[13]| 20|   5,000|  -|     -|    600|    700|     917|    400\r\n  Tisbury     | 20   |  8|   3,000|  6|    90|    300|  3,000|   3,930|    800\r\n  Wareham     | 45   | 36|  10,800|  -|     -|  1,300| 10,000|  13,100|  2,500\r\n  Yarmouth    | 41   | 15|   3,750| 10|   200|    475|  8,000|  10,480|  2,250\r\n  ------------+------+---+--------+---+------+-------+-------+--------+-------\r\n     Total    | 647  |341|$108,730|130|$2,650|$10,373|125,510|$164,436| 30,900\r\n  ============+======+===+========+===+======+=======+=======+========+=======\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barnstable._\r\n\r\nThe principal scalloping grounds of the town of Barnstable are found in\r\nHyannis bay and at Cotuit. Scallops are said to have once been abundant\r\nin Barnstable harbor, on the north side of Cape Cod. At the present day\r\nthe scallop is unknown commercially in this locality, and few are found\r\non the sand flats of the harbor. A. Howard Clark, in his report on the\r\nfisheries of Massachusetts, in 1880, makes the following statement\r\nconcerning this industry in Barnstable harbor:--\r\n\r\n    Scallops are abundant along the shores of the harbor, and\r\n    in 1876 a party of men from Hyannis established themselves\r\n    here for the purpose of gathering them. In 1877 the price of\r\n    scallops declined very greatly, forcing these men to abandon\r\n    their enterprise. The fishery was continued, however, by two\r\n    men of Barnstable. In the winter of 1877-78 the latter shipped\r\n    40 half-barrels of \"eyes,\" and during the winter of 1878-79\r\n    only 6 half-barrels. They were sent to Boston and New York.\r\n\r\nThis furnishes a concrete example of the extinction of the productive\r\nscallop beds in certain localities. The chances are that a severe\r\nwinter or other adverse physical conditions killed all the scallops\r\nin the harbor, and rendered impossible any future supply. Although\r\nBarnstable harbor, with its swift tides, is not suitable for scallops\r\nin all parts, yet there are certain localities where they should\r\nthrive. In no way is it visionary or impossible that by the proper\r\ntransplanting of young scallops from the waters on the south side of\r\nthe Cape, these \"seeders\" might furnish other generations of scallops,\r\nand revive an extinct industry. At any rate, the chances for success in\r\nthis line look favorable, and should be carefully considered.\r\n\r\n_Hyannis._--Although the scallop industry on the north coast of the\r\ntown is extinct, it still flourishes as of old on the south coast. The\r\nbulk of the business is carried on here, and nearly all the shipments\r\nare made from this town. The scallop territory comprises 2,700 acres,\r\nin the following localities: (1) Lewis Bay; (2) near Squaw's Island;\r\n(3) Hyannisport harbor; and (4) the shore waters. At Hyannisport small\r\nscallops are taken with \"pushers\" in the shallow water, while large\r\nscallops are taken by dredging in the other three localities. Scallops\r\nare found in different parts and in varying abundance each year.\r\nPractically all this territory as outlined on the map is suitable for\r\nscallops.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of scalloping are in use at Hyannis: (1) the hand \"pusher,\"\r\nused in shallow water, especially in the harbor at Hyannisport; (2)\r\ndredging. These two methods cover different territories, and it is\r\npossible that one year scallops may be found only on the flats where\r\nit was impossible to dredge with a boat, and another year be all in\r\nthe deep water where the \"pusher\" cannot be used. However, in most\r\nyears both methods are in use. The dredge most commonly used is the\r\n\"scraper,\" although the Chatham style is found here. Six to nine are\r\ncarried by each boat.\r\n\r\nHyannis claims the distinction of shipping the first Cape Cod scallops\r\nto market. This was in 1874, and was the start of a considerable\r\nindustry which employed 80 men. There has been more or less scalloping\r\never since that time. Ernest Ingersoll, in his report on the scallop\r\nfishery of the United States, in 1880, says in reference to scallop\r\nfishing at Hyannis from 1876 to 1878:--\r\n\r\n    The most northerly locality at which such a fishery exists,\r\n    as far as I am informed, is at Hyannis, Mass., and during\r\n    the winter of 1877 many persons of all ages and conditions\r\n    were employed in it there. One firm fitted up a large house\r\n    expressly for the business, and employed a large number of\r\n    openers. Skiffs, cat-rigged yawl boats, dories and punts, 200\r\n    in number, and of every size, shape, form and color, were used;\r\n    most of them were flat bottomed, shaped like a flatiron, and\r\n    therefore very \"tender\" when afloat. Each boat carried two\r\n    dredges, locally termed \"drags.\" In that year, according to Mr.\r\n    F. W. True, each of the 200 boats averaged 120 bushels, or 100\r\n    gallons, during the season, which would give a total of 24,000\r\n    bushels, or 20,000 gallons for the fleet. The scallops were\r\n    sent to New York and also to Boston, and an average price of\r\n    $5 per half-barrel was received. In 1876 the price was $7, and\r\n    in 1878 only $3.50. Further inquiries show that this spurt at\r\n    Hyannis had no precedent, and has completely died away, so that\r\n    at present there is no catch there, or at least no shipments.\r\n\r\nThe 1904-05 fishery was very successful, while the season of 1905-06\r\nproved the reverse. The production for 1905-06 was 1,350 gallons,\r\nvalued at $3,200; while the 1906-07 season furnished 1,000 gallons,\r\nworth $2,000. The following notes, made in November, 1905, give the\r\nsituation of the industry for that year:--\r\n\r\nThe scalloping areas this season have been at Squaw's Island and in\r\nLewis Bay, the first locality furnishing the better fishing. By the\r\nmiddle of November both areas were practically exhausted and the\r\nseason over. The production to November 12 was 900 gallons. After that\r\ntime the shipments to the Boston and New York markets were small and\r\nirregular, in spite of the high price of $3 to $3.50 per gallon.\r\n\r\n_Cotuit._--In the report of Mr. Ingersoll we find no mention of\r\nscalloping at Cotuit. Either there was none in 1879, or it was too\r\nsmall to be of any importance. To-day the scalloping is of slight\r\nimportance, and practically all is used for home trade. Undoubtedly\r\nthere has been but little change in the past twenty-five years. Side\r\nby side with the pigmy scallop industry has grown the oyster industry,\r\nwhich has made Cotuit famous. Undoubtedly the latter has sapped the\r\nstrength of the former by encroaching on its area; but it has always\r\nbeen for the best interests of the people, as the oyster industry here\r\nis far more valuable than the scallop fishery.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of Cotuit are quite small, extending over an irregular\r\nstrip of 100 acres. The bottom is mostly muddy, and covered with\r\npatches of eel grass. All the rest of the bay, where the bottom is\r\nmore suited for oyster culture, is taken up by grants. This scalloping\r\narea, although small, is free to the scallopers of Osterville, Cotuit,\r\nMarston's Mills and Hyannis, and even where heavily set it is soon\r\nfished out.\r\n\r\nIn the years previous to 1904-05 exceptionally fine scalloping had been\r\nreported by the fishermen. The season of 1904-05 was exceptionally\r\npoor, and in 1905-06 hardly any scallops were obtainable. In 1907\r\nscalloping began October 1, and by December 15 all the boats were\r\nhauled up, as the scallops became too scarce for profitable fishing.\r\nDredging is the only important method employed in the Cotuit fishery,\r\nalthough a few scallops were picked up on the flats.\r\n\r\nA town law forbidding the capture of scallops for market before\r\nDecember 1 was passed in 1899. This, nevertheless, permitted any\r\nresident of Barnstable, between October 1 and December 1, to catch\r\nscallops for his family use, and for this reason could never be\r\nstrictly enforced. In 1907 this law was repealed, as many believed that\r\nit was detrimental rather than helpful to the Cotuit interests, as it\r\ngave the Hyannis scallopers, after they had fished for two months in\r\nHyannis Bay, the cream of the Cotuit fishery.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  ============+=======+=================+=======+======================\r\n              | Number|      BOATS.     | Value | PRODUCTION, 1907-08.\r\n     TOWN.    |   of  +--------+--------+  of   +----------+-----------\r\n              |  Men. | Value. | Number.| Gear. | Gallons. |  Value.\r\n  ------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+----------+-----------\r\n  Hyannis,    |   16  | $3,200 |    8   | $200  |    1,130 |  $1,480\r\n  Hyannisport,|   14  |  2,800 |    7   |  200  |      100 |     131\r\n  Cotuit,     |    9  |  2,000 |    8   |  175  |      300 |     393\r\n  ------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+----------+-----------\r\n      Total,  |   39  | $8,000 |   23   | $575  |    1,530 |  $2,004\r\n  ============+=======+========+========+=======+==========+===========\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bourne._\r\n\r\nThe villages of Buzzards Bay, Monument Beach and Cataumet share the\r\nscallop fishery of the town of Bourne, and have had during 1907-08 a\r\nsuccessful season for the first time in eight years.\r\n\r\nThe available scallop territory of the town covers approximately 3,000\r\nacres, extending from Buttermilk Bay along the whole coast of the town\r\nto Cataumet.\r\n\r\nThe fishing is mostly done by dredging with cat boats, carrying from\r\nsix to ten dredges per boat, although a few scallopers dredge with\r\npower. The dredges are generally of the \"scraper\" type, with the chain\r\nbottom, similar to the dredges used at Edgartown. The scallopers both\r\nopen their own catch and hire openers to assist them. Thirty boats, 8\r\ncarrying 2 men, and 22 with 1 man, totalling 38 men, are employed in\r\nthe scallop fishery.\r\n\r\nThe industry lasted until Jan. 1, 1908, when the boats were hauled up\r\nfor winter. The total estimate for the season is 20,000 bushels, or\r\n12,000 gallons (unsoaked), valued at $15,720. The largest daily catch\r\nrecorded for one boat was 72 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe principal market is New York, though part of the catch is sent\r\nto New Bedford. The price varied from $1.15 to $3 per gallon. The\r\nscallopers claim that they do not soak the scallops, as the \"eye\" is\r\nlarge enough to sell well without increasing its size. Undoubtedly\r\nsoaking is done to some extent. The scallops are large, opening about\r\n3½ quarts per bushel.\r\n\r\nTwelve hundred dollars are invested in gear and $15,000 in boats, which\r\nvary from $300 to $1,300 in value.\r\n\r\nLicenses costing $1 are required by the selectmen of every scalloper.\r\n\r\nHere again we find the old tale of the decline of a once prosperous\r\nindustry, and new enthusiasm in the success of the 1907-08 season. The\r\n1906-07 season was an improvement over the previous one, when eight\r\nlicenses were issued, allowing a maximum of 1,605 bushels to be taken.\r\nIn previous years no licenses were given, as there were no scallops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brewster._\r\n\r\nScalloping at Brewster can hardly be called an industry. Here the\r\nprimitive method of picking up the scallops on the exposed flats at\r\nlow tide is alone used. The scallops are washed by the heavy seas on\r\nthe flats, and can be gathered by men, women and children when the\r\ntide goes down. Somewhere in the deeper water is a bed of scallops,\r\nbut in 1905 no one had been able to locate it. In 1905 only one man\r\nmade a business of gathering and shipping these scallops. He averaged 2\r\nbushels per tide, going down with a team and carting them to his house,\r\nwhere he opened them. All shipments were made to Boston, at an average\r\nprice of $1.75 to $2. The people pick up many for home use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chatham._\r\n\r\nThe town of Chatham, situated at the elbow of Cape Cod, possesses\r\nabundant facilities for all the shore fisheries. For the past\r\ntwenty-five years the scallop fishery has held almost equal rank with\r\nthe lobster and cod fisheries, for which Chatham is noted, and has in\r\nmany years furnished employment when other fishing had failed.\r\n\r\nScallops are found only in the southern waters of the town. Between\r\nInward Point and Harding's Beach many acres of eel-grass flats,\r\nsheltered from the open ocean by Monomoy Island, furnish excellent\r\ngrounds for scallops. The entire area of these grounds is approximately\r\n2,000 acres, although this whole territory is never completely stocked\r\nin any one year. During the season of 1907-08 the following places\r\nconstituted the scalloping grounds:--\r\n\r\n(1) Island Flats in Stage Harbor, on the east side of the channel,\r\nopposite Harding's Beach, furnished a number of scallops, which were\r\nrapidly caught the first of the season, as these flats were near the\r\ntown. Here the water is not more than 1½ to 2 feet deep at low tide,\r\nand thick eel grass covers the greater part except near the channel.\r\nThe first of the season a man could obtain 8 bushels per day, but later\r\na catch of 2 bushels was considered good.\r\n\r\n(2) Directly south of Harding's Beach lies John Perry's flat, commonly\r\nknown as \"Jerry's,\" where there has been good scalloping for many years.\r\n\r\n(3) The western half of the Common Flats furnished the best scalloping\r\nin 1907-08, as the scallops, though small (6 pecks to a gallon), were\r\nplentiful. These flats run nearly dry on low course tides, and are\r\ncovered with eel grass. Nearly every year there is a heavy set of\r\nscallop seed, which, because of the exposed nature of the flats, is\r\nwholly or partially destroyed. The entire set was destroyed in the\r\nwinter of 1904-05, while 30 per cent. was lost in 1906-07.\r\n\r\n(4) On the flats just south of Inward Point was another bed of scallops.\r\n\r\n(5) In the bend north of Inward Point scallops were plentiful.\r\n\r\n(6) On the northwest edge of the Common Flats scallops can be dredged\r\nover an area of 160 acres at a depth of 5 fathoms. These are of good\r\nsize, opening 3½ quarts to the bushel.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of obtaining scallops are employed: (1) by the use of the\r\n\"pusher;\" and (2) by dredging. As the \"pusher\" is used on the flats\r\nat low water where the boats cannot sail, the boat man possesses the\r\nadvantage of \"pushing\" at low tide and dredging at high water. Sixty\r\nper cent. of the scallopers at Chatham go in dories and use \"pushers,\"\r\nas the Common Flats afford excellent opportunity for this sort of\r\nfishing; the remaining 40 per cent. scallop in boats, using \"pushers\"\r\nto a limited extent. Four to six box dredges are used for each boat,\r\nthe smaller boats carrying four, the larger six.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                  107\r\n      Dory men (\"pushers\"), 62\r\n      Boat men (dredgers),                         45\r\n  Number of boats,                                 35\r\n      Single-manned,                               26\r\n      Double-manned,                                9\r\n  Value of boats,                             $10,650\r\n  Number of dories,                                61\r\n  Value of dories,                             $1,430\r\n  Value of scallop gear for dories,               135\r\n  Value of scallop gear for boats,              1,050\r\n  Total value of scallop gear,                  1,185\r\n\r\nLast season 34,615 gallons, valued at $45,345, were shipped to Boston\r\nand New York. Shipments are made in butter tubs, containing 4 to 6\r\ngallons each.\r\n\r\nThe larger scallops in the deep water are from 2½ to 2¾ inches in\r\nlength, taking 5 pecks to open a gallon of \"eyes.\" On the flats are\r\nsmaller scallops, from 2 to 2¼ inches in length, of which 6½ pecks\r\nare required to make a gallon. About 4,000 gallons were bought in\r\nChatham by two dealers, paying $1.30 per gallon; the rest were shipped\r\nto Boston and New York by the individual scallopers, shipments being\r\nmade semiweekly to New York. The scallops were shipped in butter tubs\r\ncontaining from 4 to 6 gallons, on which the express charges were: to\r\nNew York, 65 cents; to Boston, 35 cents. The 1907-08 production was\r\n20,000 gallons, valued at $40,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1905-06 practically all the catch were \"seed\" scallops of the set\r\nof 1905; only about 5 per cent. of the catch were scallops of the 1904\r\nset. Owing to the exceptional cod fishing, only 15 men made a business\r\nof scalloping, going mostly one man to a boat, and averaging 3½ bushels\r\nper day after the scalloping \"struck in,\" Dec. 1, 1905. The high prices\r\nalone made it profitable to catch these small scallops, which gave only\r\n3 pints of \"eyes\" to a bushel of shells,--just one-half the amount\r\nyielded by a bushel of large scallops. The fishermen were all from\r\nSouth and West Chatham. The entire catch was estimated at 2,800 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dennis._\r\n\r\nThe scallop grounds of Dennis and Yarmouth are common property for the\r\ninhabitants of both towns, while other towns are excluded from the\r\nfishery. The West Dennis scallopers fish mostly on the Yarmouth flats\r\nat the mouth of Parker River, and between Bass and Parker rivers on the\r\nshore flats. There is also scalloping along the shore on the Dennis\r\ngrounds. These grounds are for the \"pushers.\" Dredging is carried on at\r\nDennisport, and the boats cover a wide territory at some distance from\r\nthe shore. The town possesses a large area, which either has scattering\r\nscallops or is well stocked one year and barren the next. Nearly 2,250\r\nacres of available territory is included in the waters of the town. The\r\nflats, which are of sand with thick or scattering eel grass, according\r\nto the locality, afford a good bottom for scallops. Were it not for the\r\neel grass, the scallops would perish by being washed on the shore by\r\nsoutherly winds.\r\n\r\nThirty men make a business of scalloping in the town of Dennis, 22\r\nfrom Dennisport and 8 from West Dennis. At Dennisport scalloping is\r\npractically all done by dredging, while at West Dennis scallops are all\r\ntaken by the use of \"pushers.\" At Dennisport 9 boats, 3 sail and 6 cat\r\nboats, with power, carrying 18 men, are employed in the business. Here\r\nalso are 4 dory scallopers. At West Dennis the scallopers go mostly in\r\npairs, using only 5 dories.\r\n\r\nThe dredges used at Dennisport are similar to the Chatham dredge. At\r\nDennisport the scallopers open the scallops and also employ openers,\r\nwhile at West Dennis the scallopers do the entire work.\r\n\r\nIn 1907-08 the production was 2,950 gallons, valued at $3,865.\r\nScallops were shipped to the New York and Boston markets, although the\r\ngreater part of the catch went to New York.\r\n\r\nThe scallops taken at Dennisport are large, opening 3 quarts to the\r\nbushel. At West Dennis, where the fishing is done in the shallow water,\r\nthe scallops are somewhat smaller, yielding only 2½ quarts to the\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of November large quantities of scallops were blown\r\nashore at Dennisport, and it is said that as many as 72 bushels were\r\ngathered by one man in a day.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of boats:--\r\n      Sail,                                    $1,230\r\n      Power,                                    3,000\r\n      Dories,                                     180\r\n                                               ------\r\n          Total,                               $4,410\r\n\r\n  Value of gear:--\r\n      Boat,                                       350\r\n      Dory,                                        18\r\n                                               ------\r\n          Total,                                 $368\r\n\r\nPermits are required for scalloping, but are issued free of charge by\r\nthe selectmen. Dennis and Yarmouth have common scallop fishery rights,\r\nthe town scallop regulation reading as follows:--\r\n\r\n    All persons other than the inhabitants of the towns of Dennis\r\n    and Yarmouth are prohibited from taking scallops from the\r\n    shores and waters of the town of Yarmouth excepting for their\r\n    family use, and in no case without a permit.\r\n\r\nDuring the season of 1904-05 there existed off Dennisport one of the\r\nlargest beds of scallops ever known in Massachusetts. Not only was it\r\nextensive, but the scallops were very numerous. An enormous yield was\r\nthe result, affording great profit to a large number of scallopers,\r\nand bringing into the town thousands of dollars. It was stated by the\r\nscallopers that when the scalloping ceased because of the severe winter\r\nand ice the number of scallops appeared in no way diminished. During\r\nthe season the catch averaged over 25 bushels per boat. Prospects\r\nlooked good for the following season, as the fishermen expected the\r\nscallops to live until the next year. Unfortunately, the life of a\r\nscallop is less than two years, and before spring practically the whole\r\nof this large bed was dead,--a heavy loss to the fishing interests of\r\nthe town and of the State.\r\n\r\nIn cases like this the exclusion of scallopers from the neighboring\r\ntowns, through the present system of town laws, has resulted in severe\r\neconomic and financial loss to the State, as many more scallops\r\ncould have been captured without injury to the future supply if more\r\nfishermen had been given an opportunity to enjoy this fishery.\r\n\r\nThe following season, 1905-06, presented a marked contrast to that\r\nof 1904-05. Some adverse conditions had injured the set of 1905, and\r\nas a result there were scarcely any adult scallops. By January 1 the\r\nscallops of the 1906 set had become large enough in certain localities\r\nto permit capture. Owing to the high prices, these scallops, less than\r\neight months old (\"seed\" scallops), were profitable to catch, and the\r\nseason's catch at Dennisport after January 1 consisted of these young\r\nscallops. At that time the present \"seed\" scallop law was not in force,\r\nso the capture of these scallops was entirely legal.\r\n\r\nAbout 6 men were engaged during 1905-06 in scalloping at Dennisport.\r\nThe scallops were obtained by dredging in the deeper water. The average\r\ncatch was 3 to 4 bushels per day. The 1906-07 season was hardly above\r\nthe average. At West Dennis 8 men were engaged in scalloping on the\r\nflats with \"pushers.\" The scallops were small, averaging about 2 inches\r\nin width. It is only once every three or four years that West Dennis\r\nscallops are in the deep water where it is necessary to dredge them;\r\nusually the scallops are found on the shallow-water flats. The 1907-08\r\nseason is the best season the town has had since 1904-05.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dartmouth._\r\n\r\nA few scallops are occasionally found in Slocum's River and other\r\nplaces, but in no quantity to furnish any commercial fishery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eastham._\r\n\r\nThe scalloping grounds are on the west side of the town, about half a\r\nmile out. During the season of 1906-07, 6 men, working at intervals\r\nduring the winter, managed to take a total of 500 bushels from these\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgartown._\r\n\r\nEdgartown, situated at the eastern end of Martha's Vineyard, possesses\r\nextensive scallop grounds, and is one of the leading towns in the\r\nproduction of this shellfish. This fishery, even more important than\r\nthe quahaug industry, furnishes steady winter employment for a large\r\nnumber of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe important grounds are in Cape Poge Pond and in Edgartown harbor,\r\nwhile occasionally beds of scallops, especially \"seed,\" are found in\r\nKatama Bay. These grounds comprise an area of 2,000 acres, chiefly of\r\ngrass bottom.\r\n\r\nAt Edgartown scalloping is done both with sail and with power boats,\r\nwhich are generally auxiliary cat boats, though power dories are used\r\nto some extent. All but two of the power boats are doubly manned,\r\nwhile the sail boats carry but one man. Eleven sail and 15 power boats,\r\nemploying 39 men, are engaged in the fishery.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of dredges are used, the \"scraper\" for scalloping in the\r\neel grass and the \"slider\" for clean surface. The depth of water over\r\nthe scallop beds is not more than 18 feet, necessitating 10½ fathoms\r\nof rope. The price of a dredge, including rope, is about $3, which is\r\ncheaper than in the Buzzards Bay towns. Each power boat uses six to\r\neight, which are held out by \"spreaders,\" poles extending from the\r\nsides of the boat, in order that the dredges may cover more ground and\r\nnot trail behind one another.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the scalloping is done by power, and, in spite of\r\nthe extra cost of nearly 90 cents per day, the proportionate increase\r\nmakes this method more profitable; it is claimed to increase the catch\r\nabout one-third. Scalloping with power necessitates the services of two\r\nmen, as one man has to cull while the other steers. At the end of the\r\n\"drift\" the boat is stopped, and both men cull. With sail, culling can\r\nbe done when dredges are overboard. When two men scallop, the owner of\r\nthe boat takes three-fifths while his partner shares two-fifths of the\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five to 30 openers prepare the scallop for market during the\r\nafternoons and evenings. These are paid at the rate of 25 cents per\r\ngallon, and average about $1.50 per day, a good opener cutting out a\r\ngallon of \"eyes\" in an hour. Small scallops open 700 \"eyes\" per gallon;\r\nthe larger ones, 500.\r\n\r\nThe 1907-08 season was successful, as the scallops were plentiful, the\r\ndaily catch per boat running between 5 and 50 bushels. About 17,000\r\ngallons, valued at $22,270, were shipped between Oct. 1, 1907, and\r\nApril 1, 1908.\r\n\r\nShipments are made mostly to the New York market; a very few to Boston\r\nmarket. The freight charges on a keg, which weighs about 70 pounds, is\r\n55 cents. In warm weather scallops are sent by express, the charges\r\nbeing 80 cents. The scallops are packed in butter tubs of large size,\r\naveraging from 6 to 7 gallons, and costing 8 cents apiece. These are\r\nobtained second hand from the grocery stores at New Bedford. The tubs\r\nare packed full and closed tightly. By the time the scallops arrive at\r\nmarket they are reduced in quantity by the jarring, in warm weather\r\nfrom 7 to 6 gallons, and in cold from 7 to 6½. Returns from the market\r\nare made in about a week. Scallops can be held back for better prices\r\nthree to four days in warm weather, and about seven in cold.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of power boats,                        $5,250\r\n  Value of sail boats,                          2,750\r\n  Value of gear,                                  550\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                   $8,550\r\n\r\nBy vote of the town, the season for several years has been open one\r\nmonth later than the State season. Shellfish permits costing $2 are\r\nrequired of every scalloper. The daily catch for one man is restricted\r\nto 25 bushels.\r\n\r\nEdgartown was one of the pioneer towns in the State in the scallop\r\nfishery, and as early as 1875 scallops were shipped to the market. The\r\nindustry has maintained a steady supply, and has not shown the great\r\nvariation of the Cape and Buzzards Bay fisheries. This is due perchance\r\nto the natural conditions, which render favorable the maintenance of an\r\nextensive industry.\r\n\r\nThe last four seasons have been very successful, as when scallops were\r\nscarce the increased price more than made up for the diminished supply.\r\nThe 1904-05 season was favorable, but, owing to the severe winter,\r\nfishing ceased about January 1, although scallops were plentiful both\r\nin Cape Poge Pond and Edgartown harbor. In 1905-06 scallops were found\r\nonly in Cape Poge Pond, as the previous severe winter had killed all\r\nthe harbor \"seed.\" This season was most successful, as Nantucket and\r\nEdgartown, owing to the scarcity of scallops in other localities,\r\nreceived very high market prices. Scallops were more abundant in\r\n1906-07, but the lower prices made the industry less prosperous than in\r\nthe previous season.\r\n\r\n              COMPARISON OF 1879 WITH 1907-08 PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n  =====================+=======+=========\r\n                       | 1879. | 1907-08.\r\n  ---------------------+-------+---------\r\n  Gallons,             |  500  |  17,000\r\n  Value,               | $250  | $22,270\r\n  =====================+=======+=========\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fairhaven._\r\n\r\nFairhaven possesses, with New Bedford, the scalloping grounds of\r\nthe Acushnet River, and in addition a much larger territory around\r\nSconticut Neck and West Island. The scalloping territory comprises\r\nabout 2,500 acres, most of which is unproductive or productive only at\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThe town charges $1 for the license to each scalloper. Seventy-three\r\nlicenses were issued in 1906-07. This is a larger number than has been\r\nissued in recent years. The highest number ever issued was 80.\r\n\r\nThe capital invested is transitory, for the season, as in New Bedford,\r\nusually lasts only three weeks. Possibly $14,000 is invested in this\r\nway in boats and gear.\r\n\r\nIn a good season as high as 2,000 gallons have been shipped in a week.\r\nThe average season hardly produces this amount in the whole three\r\nweeks. In the season of 1907-08, 1,300 gallons were shipped. Some years\r\nago the starfish was a source of damage to the fishery, but of late\r\nyears it has attracted little notice.\r\n\r\nWe find the following account of the scallop fishery of Fairhaven\r\nwritten by A. Howard Clark in 1879:--\r\n\r\n    Ten boats took 2,100 bushels of scallops in 1880. Fourteen men\r\n    with 10 boats dredge for scallops from the middle of October\r\n    to the middle of January. Great quantities are found in the\r\n    Acushnet River, as well as along the western shore of the bay.\r\n    A small dredge, holding about a bushel, is used. It is made\r\n    with an oval-shaped iron frame, 3½ feet in length. Wire netting\r\n    is used in the front part and twine at the back. Small sail\r\n    boats, each with two men, fish with from one to twelve of these\r\n    dredges in tow, sailing with just enough sheet to allow a slow\r\n    headway. As soon as a dredge is filled, the men \"luff up,\" haul\r\n    in, empty, and go on. These little boats take from 10 to 75\r\n    bushels a day. If the breeze be unfavorable, one man takes the\r\n    oars while the other tends the dredges.\r\n\r\nThe amount of production at the present time is about the same, or\r\neven more, than the figures given for 1879. In all other respects the\r\nindustry has changed. Five times as many men now work at the business,\r\nwhile more boats and capital are invested. This looks as if the\r\nindustry had improved. The industry as regards the methods of capture\r\nhas improved, but the actual production has remained the same. Now the\r\nseason lasts barely three weeks, whereas twenty-five years ago with few\r\nmen it lasted four months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fall River District._\r\n\r\nNo scallop fishery exists in these waters at the present time. In 1879,\r\n800 gallons were taken from this region. This furnishes an excellent\r\nillustration of the total decline of the scallop fishery in certain\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Falmouth._\r\n\r\nThe town of Falmouth cannot be said to support any scallop industry of\r\nimportance. Each year in Squeteague Pond, Wild Harbor, North Falmouth\r\nand in West Falmouth harbor a few scallops can be found; but these are\r\nused only for limited local consumption, and usually are very scarce.\r\nScallops are occasionally present in small quantities in Waquoit Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harwich._\r\n\r\nThe scallop territory of Harwich covers an extensive area on the south\r\nside of the town, and in some places extends for a distance of from 2\r\nto 3 miles out from shore. Usually the scallops are found, as in the\r\nlast season (1907-08), outside the bar, at a distance of 3 miles from\r\nshore, where they can be taken only by dredging from sail or power\r\nboats. The intervening body of water sometimes contains a few scallops\r\nin a quantity to make a commercial fishery. The total area of the\r\nscallop grounds is about 3,200 acres. The bottom is mostly sandy, with\r\npatches of eel grass.\r\n\r\nAll the scallops are caught by dredging, as the water is too deep for\r\nany other method. Twelve men were engaged in the fishery during the\r\n1907-08 season. The boats, 7 in number, consisted of 3 power and 4\r\nsail; 5 were manned by 2 men, 2 were sailed singly. The dredges used\r\nhere are the same style as the Chatham dredge.\r\n\r\nThe 1907-08 production was 2,170 gallons, valued at $2,843. The\r\nscallops were shipped to the Boston and New York markets, the greater\r\npart being shipped to New York, at an average price of $1.30 per\r\ngallon. The scallops taken in 1907-08 were large, opening 3½ quarts to\r\nthe bushel.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of boats,                              $2,350\r\n  Value of gear,                                  280\r\n  Value of shore property,                        400\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                   $3,030\r\n\r\nFor the last two years there has been practically no scallop fishery.\r\nThe 1904-05 season was the last successful season, when the large bed\r\nof scallops was found off Dennis. The 1907-08 season, however, has\r\nbeen fairly good, and it is thought that the following year may be as\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marion._\r\n\r\nMarion was included in the general revival of the scallop fishery which\r\ncame to Buzzards Bay during the past season of 1907-08, and for the\r\nfirst time in eight years has had a successful scallop season.\r\n\r\nThe scallop grounds of the town extend over an area of 1,500 acres,\r\nsituated on both sides of Great Neck, and extending from the Wareham\r\nline to Aucoot Cove.\r\n\r\nAll scalloping is done by dredging. The fishery can be divided into two\r\nclasses: (1) the boat fishery; (2) the skiff fishery. Under the first\r\nclass comes the cat boat and sloop, carrying six dredges; while the\r\nsecond class consists of the small sail skiffs, with one dredge. The\r\nskiff scalloper rows or sails, as the wind permits, and with his one\r\ndredge makes an average catch of 3 bushels per day. Forty-four men,\r\nusing 16 sail and power boats and 24 skiffs are engaged in the fishery.\r\nThe business likewise requires the services of nearly 24 openers.\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the dredges are of the \"scraper\" type, with chain\r\nnetting; the rest \"sliders,\" with loose blades. A very few \"roller\" or\r\n\"lead\" dredges are used.\r\n\r\nThe production for 1907-08 was 7,000 gallons, valued at $9,170. The\r\nscallops were mostly sent to the New Bedford market. The scallops\r\nare of two sizes: the smaller, which are taken in the shallow water,\r\nopen only 2½ quarts per bushel, while in the deeper water the larger\r\nscallops yield about 3½ quarts. The rest of the body of the scallop,\r\nafter the removal of the eye, is saved for bait at Marion, the\r\nscalloper receiving 30 cents per bucket.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of boats,                              $5,300\r\n  Value of skiffs,                                250\r\n  Value of gear,                                  580\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total                                    $6,130\r\n\r\nThe three towns of Marion, Mattapoisett and Rochester have common\r\nfishery rights, as all three were included in the original town of\r\nRochester. In 1852 Marion became an independent town, and in 1857\r\nMattapoisett was likewise separated from Rochester. Until 1893 Marion\r\nand Mattapoisett had separate fishery rights, Rochester having mutual\r\nrights with both. Since then the fishery of these towns has been common\r\nto all three. Every scalloper is required to have a permit, the boatmen\r\npaying $2, the skiff scallopers $1, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe scallop industry supplanted the waning oyster industry at Marion\r\nsome twelve years ago, and for a time it flourished greatly. The\r\nabundance of scallops and extent of the grounds furnish excellent\r\nscalloping. After a few very successful years the industry suddenly\r\ndied out and became practically extinct. The direct cause is claimed by\r\nthe scallopers to have been the starfish, which came in the harbor in\r\ngreat abundance at the time of the decline of the industry. Up to this\r\nseason but little scalloping had been done for several years, and not a\r\nsingle permit was issued for the season of 1906-07.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mashpee._\r\n\r\nThe scallop territory of Mashpee lies in the Popponesset River and Bay,\r\ncomprising at most 200 acres. For the last six years there has been no\r\nscallop industry in the town. A few scallops are occasionally taken for\r\nhome consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mattapoisett._\r\n\r\nThe scallop territory of Mattapoisett, comprising an area of 1,200\r\nacres, much of which is open and exposed, is in general confined to the\r\nfollowing localities: Nasketucket Bay, Brant Bay, Brant Island Cove,\r\nMattapoisett harbor, Pine Neck Cove and Aucoot Cove. The location and\r\nextent of these grounds are indicated on Map 8.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   22\r\n  Number of boats:--\r\n      Sail,                                        13\r\n      Power,                                        6\r\n                                               ------\r\n          Total,                                   19\r\n\r\n  Boats, how manned:--\r\n      Single,                                      16\r\n      Double,                                       3\r\n\r\nDredging is the only method of scalloping used in Mattapoisett.\r\nSmall cat boats and a few power boats are employed in the fishery.\r\nThe \"roller\" dredge is the most popular style with the Mattapoisett\r\nscallopers, who claim that on the uneven bottom this dredge is the most\r\nsuccessful. This town is the only locality in the State where this kind\r\nof dredge is used. The cost of a dredge completely rigged with rope,\r\nwhich is often 15 fathoms long, is $4.50, and 8 to 10 dredges are used\r\nfor each boat.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1907-08 season the production was 5,000 gallons, valued at\r\n$6,550. These were mostly marketed at New Bedford, where they were\r\npurchased unsoaked by the New Bedford Fish Company. At the first part\r\nof the season it was not uncommon for a boat to catch 25 bushels per\r\nday, but as the season progressed the size of the catch gradually\r\ndiminished. The scallops were large, opening 3 quarts to the bushel.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of boats,                              $6,900\r\n  Value of gear,                                  760\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                   $7,660\r\n\r\nThe scallop industry at Mattapoisett, though once important, was\r\nextinct for several years. The present season has shown a revival, and\r\nthe industry has again assumed a commercial value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nantucket._\r\n\r\nNantucket is one of the leading towns of the State in the scallop\r\nfishery. The grounds lie both in Nantucket harbor and in Maddequet\r\nharbor on the west end of the island. The former of these is the\r\nlarger and more important, as the fishery is near the town. When the\r\nscallops become scarce in Nantucket harbor, the scallopers adjourn to\r\nthe fresher beds of Maddequet. Nantucket harbor contains approximately\r\n3,000 acres of scallop territory; Maddequet and Muskeget, 1,500 acres.\r\n\r\nPractically all the scalloping is done by dredging from sail boats,\r\nemploying about 99 men in the fishery. The dredges are of the \"slider\"\r\nand the \"scraper\" types, the iron frames of which cost $1.50 and the\r\nnetting bags 30 cents. From 6 to 10 of these are used per boat, and are\r\ndragged by 7 fathoms of 15-thread rope. Five regular openers are hired,\r\nwho receive from 20 to 25 cents per gallon, according to the size of\r\nthe scallops. A few scallops are taken in the shallow water by the dory\r\nfishermen with \"pushers,\" which are locally known as \"scoops.\" These\r\ndiffer from the Cape Cod \"pusher,\" being more rounded and smaller in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of boats:--\r\n      Power,                                       10\r\n      Sail,                                        37\r\n      Dories,                                      20\r\n\r\n  Boats, how manned:--\r\n      Single,                                      15\r\n      Double,                                      32\r\n      Single dories,                               20\r\n\r\nIn 1906-07 the production was 9,820 gallons, valued at $12,875.\r\n\r\n  ==================+==========+===========+===========\r\n                    |          |   Price   |\r\n     1907-08.[14]   | Gallons. |per Gallon.|  Value.\r\n  ------------------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  October,          |    2,639 |     $1.25 |  $3,298.75\r\n  November,         |    4,160 |      1.00 |   4,160.00\r\n  December,         |    5,430 |      1.00 |   5,430.00\r\n  January,          |    5,910 |      1.50 |   8,865.00\r\n  February          |      960 |      2.00 |   1,920.00\r\n  March,            |    1,146 |      2.50 |   2,865.00\r\n                    +----------+-----------+-----------\r\n      Total,        |   20,245 |     $1.31 | $26,538.75\r\n  ==================+==========+===========+===========\r\n\r\nShipments were made by express to New York and Boston, the charges to\r\nNew York being 95 cents, to Boston 55 cents per keg. The greater part\r\nwas shipped to New York market. The scallops were shipped mostly in\r\n7-gallon kegs, which cost 33 cents apiece. About 30 New York and 20\r\nBoston firms receive shipments from the Nantucket scallopers.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of scallops, the large \"channel\" and the small or \"eel\r\ngrass,\" are obtained.

Many scallopers when fishing in shallow water \"cull out\" the\r\nsmall \"seed\" scallops, and, instead of returning them to the shallow\r\nwater, transplant them to the deep water of the channel, where they\r\nare not only protected in case of severe winter, but produce a larger\r\nscallop the following year. This is the only attempt at protecting\r\nthe scallop ever made in Massachusetts, and shows how important the\r\nindustry is to the town.\r\n\r\nFor the two seasons previous to 1907-08 every scalloper was required to\r\nhave a license. In 1905-06 the price was 50 cents, while the following\r\nyear, 1906-07, 190 licenses, costing $1 each, were taken out. No\r\nlicenses were required in 1907-08. Special by-laws, either limiting the\r\ncatch or enforcing a close season to meet the demands of the fishery,\r\nare made by the town each year.\r\n\r\nScallops have been always plentiful, but fifty-five years ago they\r\nwere not caught, as they were considered poisonous. The present\r\nindustry started in 1883, and since that time, in spite of its ups and\r\ndowns, it has remained a constant source of revenue to the island.\r\nNotwithstanding a scarcity of scallops, the high prices of 1905-06\r\nenabled the fishermen to have a fairly successful season. Both the\r\n1906-07 and the 1907-08 seasons have been very prosperous, as scallops\r\nhave been plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Bedford._\r\n\r\nThe scallop industry at New Bedford has been in existence since about\r\n1870, and has furnished a livelihood for an average of 15 men ever\r\nsince. Of late years the industry has shown a marked decline.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 A. Howard Clark says:--\r\n\r\n    Scallops are plentiful in the Acushnet River, and large\r\n    quantities are taken with dredges from October through the\r\n    winter. The business of late years has greatly increased.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Ernest Ingersoll also writes:--\r\n\r\n    In the Acushnet River and all along the western shore of\r\n    Buzzards Bay these little mollusks abound, and their catching\r\n    has come to be of considerable importance in that locality.\r\n    Mr. W. A. Wilcox, who sends me notes on the subject, says that\r\n    it is only eighteen years ago that a fisherman of Fairhaven\r\n    (opposite New Bedford) was unable to sell 5 gallons that he had\r\n    caught. But the taste has been acquired, and a local market has\r\n    grown up to important proportions, so that in 1880 14 men and\r\n    10 small boats (dories) were dredging for scallops in Buzzards\r\n    Bay from the middle of October to the middle of January. Mr.\r\n    Wilcox says: \"These small boats will take from 10 to 75 bushels\r\n    a day.\" These men are not willing to work every day, however,\r\n    since the tautog and other fishing calls their attention,\r\n    and there is danger of overstocking the market. It therefore\r\n    happens that the total catch reported for both New Bedford and\r\n    Fairhaven men will not exceed 6,400 gallons, valued at $3,864,\r\n    60 cents being a fair price in this and the Boston market. The\r\n    value of the investment devoted to this business at Fairhaven\r\n    is about $120.\r\n\r\nThe scallop industry of 1907 cannot be compared with that of former\r\nyears. The amount of scallops taken is not one-third of the former\r\nproduction. More men are engaged in the business than twenty-five years\r\nago, but the beds are raked clean in a shorter time. The annual yield\r\nhas sadly fallen off, in spite of improved methods of capture and\r\nincreased number of fishermen. This decline cannot here be attributed\r\nto either of the natural enemies of the scallop, as neither the\r\nstarfish nor oyster drill are abundant. Severe climatic conditions and\r\noverfishing by man are the direct causes of this decline.\r\n\r\nThe scallop area of New Bedford comprises approximately 400 acres,\r\nprincipally in the Acushnet River and in Clark's Cove.\r\n\r\nIn 1906-07, 38 licenses were issued by the city for scalloping. This is\r\na marked decrease over former years. Probably not all these men fish\r\nregularly. In the last few years the season has been rather short,\r\nlasting between three and four weeks, as the scallops were practically\r\nall caught in that time.\r\n\r\nThe capital required for the business, consisting of cat boats, skiffs,\r\ndredges, shanties, etc., amounts to about $5,600; but this is merely\r\ntransient, and is only employed for three or four weeks, and then\r\ndevoted to other fisheries.\r\n\r\n                           ANNUAL PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n  ========================================\r\n   YEAR. | Bushels. | Gallons. | Value.\r\n  ---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n  1905-06, |  1,000   |  1,000   | $3,000\r\n  1906-07, |  1,200   |  1,200   |  3,000\r\n  1907-08, |    700   |    700   |    917\r\n  ========================================\r\n\r\nAll scalloping is done by dredging from either cat boats or dories.\r\nSince 1879 improvements have been made, and cat boats instead of\r\ndories, each manned by one man with six dredges, now do the work once\r\nwholly performed, as Ingersoll says, by dories. All the scalloping\r\ntakes place in deep water.\r\n\r\nWhen the law of 1905 made the Acushnet River and Clark's Cove forbidden\r\nshellfish territory, because of the sewage pollution of the harbor,\r\nthe capture of scallops in season was still allowed. This was based on\r\nthe principle that there is no danger in eating the clean \"eye\" of the\r\nscallop, although as a matter of fact there is actual danger of typhoid\r\ninfection to those handling anything from sewage-polluted waters.\r\n\r\nThe following notes were made Nov. 21, 1905, upon the fishery of that\r\nyear:--\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the season a bed of scallops was discovered just\r\noutside the harbor beyond the light. Twenty-five boats set to work\r\nimmediately, but there was not a sufficient supply of scallops to keep\r\nthem long employed, and one by one they dropped out, until by November\r\n21 only two or three boats were still engaged in the fishery.\r\n\r\nThe scallops of this year were of large size, 2½ to 2¾ inches, and\r\nturned out a gallon of \"eyes\" per bushel,--an excellent yield, as the\r\naverage scallops only shuck out 2½ to 3 quarts to a bushel of shells.\r\nIf a man could obtain a gallon per day by November 21 he was lucky, and\r\nowing to the high retail price, he made a fair day's wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orleans._\r\n\r\nOn the flats about ½ to 1 mile from the west shore scallops are\r\noccasionally found. Six years ago there was a fairly good season, but\r\nsince that time there have been very few scallops, and these are taken\r\nonly for home consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Provincetown._\r\n\r\nScallops are obtained on the flats in the east bend of the harbor\r\ntoward the Truro shore, where they are blown by a southwest wind.\r\nEvidently there must be a bed of scallops in the deep water from which\r\nthe scallops are washed on the flats. In 1905-06 from 2 to 6 men were\r\nengaged in picking up these scallops and retailing them for home trade.\r\nAbout 1894 or 1895 scallops were numerous, and it was not uncommon for\r\na man to pick up 5 bushels on the flats at one tide. Since 1900 but few\r\nscallops have been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tisbury._\r\n\r\nThe scalloping grounds of Tisbury are in the harbor at Vineyard Haven.\r\nOnly Vineyard Haven fishermen make a business of scalloping here. The\r\nscallop grounds comprise an area of 800 acres.\r\n\r\nMost of the scallops are obtained by dredging from cat boats, which\r\nare nearly all equipped with power. With two exceptions the boats are\r\nsingly manned. Fourteen men go in 8 boats, using from six to eight\r\ndredges per boat. Six men scallop in skiffs, using one dredge. The\r\ndredges are similar to those used at Edgartown.\r\n\r\nDuring the season of 1907-08, 3,000 gallons of scallops, valued at\r\n$3,930 were captured. The fishermen ship chiefly to the New York\r\nmarket. The scallops are of an exceptionally large size, opening, it is\r\nsaid, 4 quarts to the bushel. The proportionate size of the \"eye\" to\r\nthe shell is much greater than with the ordinary scallop.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of boats,                              $3,000\r\n  Value of skiffs,                                 90\r\n  Value of gear,                                  300\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                   $3,390\r\n\r\nNo licenses or permits are required for scalloping. The last season\r\n(1907-08) is the second season that scallops have been abundant in this\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wareham._\r\n\r\nSituated at the head of Buzzards Bay, the town of Wareham possesses\r\na considerable water area which is suitable for scallops. The\r\nentire territory, embracing approximately 2,500 acres, extends in a\r\nsouthwesterly direction from Peter's Neck, including Onset Bay, to\r\nAbiel's Buoy and from there to Weweantit River. Scallops are also found\r\nin the Wareham River. Scallops are mostly found in the deeper water,\r\nwhich makes dredging the only profitable method of scalloping in this\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nScalloping is practically all done by dredging either from sail or\r\npower boats, only 3 power boats being in use during the 1907-08 season.\r\nThree men from the village of Wareham use \"pushers,\" but the yield from\r\nthis style of fishing is very small. The style of dredge in most common\r\nuse is the \"scraper.\" This year the price paid for the frame of the\r\ndredge is $3.50. These dredges have the blade set downward firmly, and\r\nhave a chain bottom of iron rings. The usual number per boat is eight,\r\nbut at Onset any number from four to fourteen are used, according to\r\nthe size of the boat and the individual choice of the scalloper. Nearly\r\nall the boats are cat boats, averaging in value about $300.\r\n\r\nAbout 30 regular openers have been engaged off and on by the\r\nscallopers. When the catch was large at the first of the season more\r\nopeners were engaged,--often as many as 3 to a scalloper. One-tenth of\r\nthe number are women.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of scallopers,                            45\r\n  Number of boats:--\r\n      Power,                                        3\r\n      Sail,                                        33\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                       36\r\n\r\nThe quantity of scallops taken during 1907-08 was approximately\r\n10,000 bushels, valued at $13,100. During October the catch was\r\nabout 15 bushels per day for the average scalloper, but later became\r\nconsiderably less. The greater part of the scallops were sold to\r\nthe New Bedford Fish Company, the representatives of which bought\r\nthem unsoaked from the fishermen. Certain of the fishermen, however,\r\npreferred to ship their catch to the Boston and New York markets.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of boats,                             $10,800\r\n  Value of gear,                                1,300\r\n  Value of shore property,                      7,000\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                  $19,100\r\n\r\nNo permits were issued in 1907-08. Previous to this year, permits were\r\nrequired from every scalloper. Wareham has a fish committee, the duty\r\nof which is to enforce the fish laws.\r\n\r\nThe first scalloping started in Wareham in 1879, when several boats\r\nfrom New Bedford commenced dredging in Wareham waters. From that\r\ntime the industry rapidly developed, until it assumed considerable\r\nimportance as a winter occupation. Since 1899 the industry has been\r\npractically dead until the present season of 1907-08. The Wareham\r\nscallopers to a man attribute this decline to the inroads of the\r\ndestructive starfish. While the scallops have been so exterminated\r\nthat no profitable fishery has been conducted the last seven years,\r\nthey have not been wholly extinct, as a few could be found each year.\r\nLately the number has been increasing, until in 1907-08 the season was\r\nvery profitable. In connection with this it is said that the starfish\r\nwere less numerous than usual. The prospects of another good season in\r\n1908-09 are excellent, as \"seed\" scallops are said to be plentiful in\r\nmany places, especially in the deep water, which furnishes protection\r\nin case of a severe winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wellfleet._\r\n\r\nAt the present time in Wellfleet Bay there is no commercial scallop\r\nfishery, although scattering scallops are found in various parts of the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yarmouth._\r\n\r\nThe scallop grounds of Yarmouth are on the south side of the town, on\r\nthe flats which border the shore from Bass River to Lewis Bay. Part of\r\nthe waters of Lewis Bay belong to the town of Yarmouth, and scallops\r\nare found over all this territory. The nature of the bottom is the\r\nsame as at Dennis and Barnstable. The total area of scallop territory\r\nis estimated at 2,250 acres. The scallop grounds of Dennis are open to\r\nYarmouth scallopers.\r\n\r\nBoth dredges and \"pushers\" are employed in the scallop fishery of the\r\ntown. The method depends upon the location of the scallops, whether\r\nin shallow or deep water, as well as the means of the individual\r\nscallopers. Both the Chatham dredge and the \"scraper\" are used.\r\nForty-one men were engaged in the 1907-08 fishery, using 15 boats and\r\nten dories.\r\n\r\nThe production for 1907-08 was 8,000 gallons, valued at $10,480.\r\nScallops were shipped to New York and Boston markets.\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  Value of boats,                              $3,750\r\n  Value of dories,                                200\r\n  Value of gear,                                  475\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                   $4,425\r\n\r\nThe same laws as were quoted for Dennis, the two towns having common\r\nfishery rights.\r\n\r\nThe 1904-05 season was prosperous, as Yarmouth scallopers had the\r\nprivilege of scalloping in the large bed off Dennis. The two following\r\nyears were very poor, and even the last season has not been up to the\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] E.

The commissioners may expend for\r\n    the purposes of this resolve a sum not exceeding five hundred\r\n    dollars a year for a period of three years.\r\n\r\nAs authorized by the above act, the Commissioners on Fisheries and Game\r\nhave conducted experiments of a biological nature upon the oyster. At\r\nthe start of the investigations, for a proper understanding of the\r\nvarious conditions in the different localities, it was necessary to\r\nmake a survey of the oyster industry of the State. Recently this survey\r\nhas been supplemented by sending printed questions to the oystermen,\r\nand the whole put in the form of a report, which gives an account of\r\nthe industry. This first report on the oyster is merely a broad survey\r\nof the whole industry of the State, and is preliminary to future\r\nreports of a more scientific character.\r\n\r\n_The Need of a Survey._--In 1879 Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, in his\r\n\"Monograph on the Oyster,\"[15] gave an excellent account of the oyster\r\nindustry of Massachusetts. Since that time no complete account, either\r\nstatistical or biological, has been written. Meanwhile, the oyster\r\nindustry of the State, owing to its steady improvement, has changed in\r\nthe past twenty-eight years, and what was true of 1879 is not true of\r\n1907. Not only have localities changed and new areas been opened up,\r\nbut also the whole industry has expanded through the enterprise and\r\nbusiness ability of the oystermen, and to-day Massachusetts possesses\r\nan oyster fishery which more than doubles the production of 1879. Thus\r\na survey of this fishery, by comparison with that of 1879, shows the\r\nchanges that have taken place, and gives some idea of the growth of the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this report will furnish sufficient data to give\r\nactual knowledge of the conditions of oyster culture in the State, show\r\nthe success of this industry, and indicate what is essential for its\r\nfuture improvement. It is necessary, in view of the conflict between\r\nthe quahaug and oyster fisheries, that the public understand the exact\r\nsituation, and this is possible only through a published account of\r\neach industry.\r\n\r\n_Scope of the Report._--The object of the report is to furnish\r\ninformation which will be of value both to the oysterman and to the\r\nconsumer. Primarily the report is for the oysterman, showing the extent\r\nof the industry in his own locality and in other parts of the coast,\r\nwhere perhaps he is unacquainted with the conditions. While exact facts\r\nare presented for the benefit of the oysterman, this report at the\r\nsame time tries to give a general description of the industry for the\r\nconsumer, who perhaps knows nothing of the oyster except as an article\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the report has been arranged under the following\r\nheadings: (1) the natural oyster beds; (2) results of the survey; (3)\r\nhistory of the industry; (4) the oyster laws; (5) the oyster industry;\r\n(6) general statistics. The second part considers separately the\r\nindustry of each town or section.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Work._--The statistical figures for the oyster industry\r\nare reasonably complete as the oyster fishery is on a more systematic\r\nbusiness basis than any of the other shellfisheries. Nevertheless,\r\non certain points it was impossible to obtain absolutely correct\r\ninformation, as, for instance, the area of grants, since no survey is\r\nmade of the grants when leased, and the oysterman himself does not\r\nknow the exact area of his granted territory. Thus an estimate has\r\nto be made by each oysterman of his granted area, and, while this is\r\napproximately correct, it cannot be considered as absolutely true.\r\n\r\nThe statistical returns were compiled by sending to each oysterman in\r\nthe State a blank form, containing a series of questions, with the\r\nrequest that he would co-operate with the commission by answering.\r\nMany oystermen responded with complete answers, thus permitting the\r\ncommission, through their aid, to publish an extended report on the\r\noyster fishery. However, it was found impossible to obtain complete\r\ninformation from several towns, as a number of oystermen neglected\r\nto return these blanks. The return of each oysterman is filed at the\r\noffice of the Commission on Fisheries and Game, and only the total\r\nfor each town is published, thus treating as confidential the private\r\nbusiness of individuals. The commission expresses a most cordial\r\nacknowledgment to the oystermen for their co-operation in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the report were obtained by personal inspection of\r\nthe oyster beds as to their biological conditions, by means of town\r\nrecords, and interviews with the oystermen. Town records, which should\r\nhave given the location, number and areas of the grants, proved nearly\r\nworthless in most cases, owing to incompleteness, loss and confusion.\r\nOwing to the frequent change in selectmen, little if any information\r\ncould be obtained from this source, as the new selectmen were generally\r\nunacquainted with the work of their predecessors concerning the leasing\r\nof oyster grants. The grants were often incompletely described, bounds\r\nuncertain and the acreage unknown.\r\n\r\nThe interviews with the individual oystermen furnished more and better\r\ninformation both in regard to the present condition of the industry and\r\nthe general history for each town.\r\n\r\nPersonal inspection of the oyster grounds was made, the biological\r\nconditions noted and the area of the grants plotted on the accompanying\r\nmaps. Not all these grants are worked, and parts of the cultivated\r\ngrants are unfit for oyster raising. The charted area includes all\r\ngrants, cultivated or uncultivated.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of the industry, information was obtained\r\nfrom town records, oystermen who had been in the business for years,\r\nand various newspapers and periodicals. For a comparison of the oyster\r\nindustry of 1879 and 1907 the excellent report of Mr. Ernest Ingersoll\r\nupon the \"Oyster Industry,\" published in the tenth census of the United\r\nStates, was used for comparison, and in many places directly quoted.\r\nWere it not for this work and the report of A. Howard Clark on the\r\n\"Fisheries of Massachusetts,\" it would have been impossible to draw any\r\nreliable comparison with the oyster industry of twenty-eight years ago.\r\n\r\n_Massachusetts as an Oyster State._--Massachusetts is perhaps not so\r\nwell adapted for oyster culture as it is for clam or quahaug farming,\r\nand does not equal other seacoast States in the extent of its oyster\r\nindustry. Nevertheless, the oyster industry is on a much firmer footing\r\nthan the other shellfisheries, and is an important adjunct to the\r\nwealth of the southern Massachusetts towns.\r\n\r\nAll the oyster grants, except in the towns of Wellfleet, Eastham\r\nand Orleans, are found south of Cape Cod, as the southern shore of\r\nMassachusetts alone is adapted for the oyster industry. Along the south\r\nside of Cape Cod and in Buzzards Bay the numerous inlets and estuaries\r\nafford with their brackish water excellent ground for the cultivation\r\nof this bivalve, and many acres which otherwise would be barren have\r\nbeen made productive through the grant system; while the shores of\r\nMassachusetts which adjoin the waters of Narragansett Bay possess, in\r\nthe Taunton, Cole and Lee's rivers, excellent waters for the growth of\r\nseed oysters. Thus Massachusetts possesses good facilities for oyster\r\nculture, which are capable of a far greater expansion than present\r\nconditions indicate.\r\n\r\nHowever well developed the oyster industry is at present, there is\r\nplenty of room for improvement. It is the consensus of opinion among\r\nthe oystermen that the business is developing every year,--a fact that\r\nspeaks well for its future. Improvements in the oyster industry can\r\narise in three ways: (1) investment of more capital in the business,\r\nwhich will allow more extensive operations; (2) more intensive\r\ncultivation of the present grounds; (3) the opening of new areas for\r\noyster culture and the utilization of waters at present useless.\r\nEverything indicates that the oyster industry will take advantage of\r\nopportunities as soon as they are given.\r\n\r\n_The Oyster Grant System._--Oyster culture in Massachusetts is the\r\nlogical result of the failure of the natural oyster beds. When these\r\nbeds became destitute of oysters through overfishing, it was necessary\r\nthat means should be used to perpetuate the stock. Oyster planting had\r\nbeen successfully carried on in the States south of Massachusetts, and\r\nit was merely a question of experiment whether the oyster would respond\r\nto the same methods in Massachusetts. Thus oyster culture arose in this\r\nState at first as an experiment, later as an established industry.\r\nGrants were given, as through this way only could oyster planting\r\nbecome a success, and the \"free fishery\" people were forced to bow to\r\npublic opinion, which decreed that grants should be leased. Thus oyster\r\ngrants arose from necessity, as in no other way could Massachusetts\r\npreserve her oyster supply.\r\n\r\nThe system of oyster grants and oyster culture, in spite of its many\r\nfailings, has shown what can be done to preserve and increase a natural\r\nshellfish industry if the proper methods are used. Planted beds have\r\nfurnished enough spawn to maintain the natural beds, which would have\r\nlong ago been depleted through the inroads of overfishing. They have\r\npreserved a fishery which would have disappeared almost completely, and\r\nestablished a better and more extensive industry, not only benefiting\r\nthe oystermen, but also those indirectly associated with the business,\r\nsuch as teamsters, transportation companies, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the following report various abuses of the present system of oyster\r\nculture will be enumerated, and it is only necessary to state that\r\nmany evils must be eliminated before the oyster industry can obtain\r\nits maximum expansion. Such evils as town politics, disputes with\r\nquahaugers, etc., will have to be remedied. The greatest obstacle\r\nwhich now checks the oyster industry is the _lack of protection_.\r\nUntil complete protection is given to the oysterman, the industry will\r\nnever attain to its full development. The removal of the abuses by the\r\norganization of the oyster industry of the State under a unified system\r\nis the best way to secure proper regulation and improvement of the\r\noyster industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Natural Oyster Beds._\r\n\r\nWhile there has been much discussion whether oysters were ever native\r\nin Massachusetts Bay, or merely the result of southern \"plants,\"\r\nthe consensus of opinion is that there were natural oyster beds in\r\nexistence when the first settlers came to this coast. Not only do\r\nhistorical records show this, but the remains of the natural beds at\r\nthe present time indicate that oysters have existed for centuries.\r\nThus there seems to be no reasonable doubt that the northern coast\r\nof Massachusetts, as well as the southern, once possessed extensive\r\nnatural oyster beds.\r\n\r\nI. _Location of the Natural Oyster Beds._--(1) _Parker River._--A\r\nnatural bed of oysters once existed in the Parker River at Newbury, and\r\neven fifty years ago it is said that oysters could still be obtained\r\nfrom this natural bed. About 1882 the experiment of fattening oysters\r\nfor market was made, and many bushels were bedded on the flats during\r\nthe summer by an oyster firm at Newbury. These oysters not only grew\r\nwell, but threw considerable spawn, furnishing a good set in the river.\r\nOyster raising was then tried, but the result was a failure, as the\r\noysters which were planted in too shallow water were killed during the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n(2) _Mystic and Charles Rivers._--Mr. Ernest Ingersoll states that: \"In\r\n1634 William Wood, in his 'New England's Prospect,' speaks of 'a great\r\noyster bank' in Charles River, and another in the 'Mysticke,' each of\r\nwhich obstructed the navigation of its river.\" He locates the Charles\r\nRiver beds as either off Cambridgeport or near the site of the Boston\r\nMuseum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nDr. G. W. Field, chairman of this department, in his report in 1902\r\nas biologist to the Charles River Dam Commission, makes the following\r\nstatement about the Charles River oyster:--\r\n\r\n    The oyster (_Ostrea_), formerly abundant, is no longer living,\r\n    and, from what indications I have been able to gather, probably\r\n    became extinct within twenty-five years. Their dead shells are\r\n    brought up by dredging operations. Their peculiar elongated\r\n    shape is the result of growth being concentrated at the upper\r\n    end, as a result of their closely crowded position in the bed,\r\n    or of an attempt to keep the opening above the accumulating\r\n    mud, and thus avoid being smothered. The fact that there are\r\n    few signs of small \"seed oysters\" tends to prove that the\r\n    bottom was so muddy that they found few places to \"set.\" From\r\n    the elongated shape of the shells may be inferred that the\r\n    amount of sedimentation going on in that particular region\r\n    was rapid during the life of the group of oysters whose\r\n    shells are to be found in quantities in the material dredged\r\n    between Harvard and Brookline bridges. This sediment need not\r\n    necessarily have been sand or clay, or any material which is\r\n    persistent, but it might have been flocculent organic débris,\r\n    which remained but a short time and left little or no evidence,\r\n    beyond its effect upon the shape of the oyster shells.\r\n\r\nIn the above account Dr. Field not only locates the original oyster\r\nbeds of Charles River, but also furnishes evidence which indicates the\r\ncause of their extinction, _i.e._, the débris and sewage, or waste\r\npoisonous, polluting materials, of a large city emptying into the\r\nriver. This is not only true of the Charles, but also of the Mystic and\r\nTaunton river beds, which have been destroyed in like manner.\r\n\r\n(3) Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, in his report on the \"Oyster Industry of the\r\nUnited States,\" in 1880 mentions that natural oyster beds were once\r\nat Weymouth, Ipswich, Barnstable and Rowley. Nothing further can be\r\nlearned concerning these places.\r\n\r\n(4) _Wellfleet._--An extensive oyster bed was found at Wellfleet Bay,\r\nwhich not only furnished a sufficient supply for the first settlers,\r\nbut enabled the inhabitants of Wellfleet to carry on a considerable\r\ntrade by shipping them to Boston and other ports, until it was finally\r\ndestroyed in 1775. Its destruction was due to overfishing and the\r\nutilization of the shells for lime, which soon destroyed the natural\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n(5) _Chatham._--A natural oyster bed once existed in the Oyster Pond,\r\nbut no trace of it now remains.\r\n\r\n(6) _Harwich._--Herring River in the town of Harwich still possesses\r\nthe remnants of a natural oyster bed, as occasionally a few oysters\r\ncan be gathered along its banks. This bed once comprised a stretch of\r\nthree-quarters of a mile along the river.\r\n\r\n(7) _Yarmouth._--The town of Yarmouth once possessed a natural oyster\r\nbed in Mill Creek, but this was fished out by 1895 and then granted for\r\noyster culture.\r\n\r\n(8) _Barnstable._--There is a natural oyster bed at Centerville.\r\n\r\n(9) _Martha's Vineyard._--Native oysters are said to have existed in\r\nthe brackish ponds on the south side of the island; a few are found\r\nthere at the present time.\r\n\r\n(10) _Falmouth._--A few native oysters are to be found in the salt\r\nponds on the south coast of the town. In Squeteague Pond and Wild\r\nHarbor oysters were once native.\r\n\r\nBuzzards Bay comprises the best natural oyster territory in the State.\r\nAt the present time the natural oyster industry has been supplanted\r\nby oyster culture, which gradually took the place of the declining\r\nnatural oyster fishery. While natural beds still exist to some extent,\r\nthey are, to all practical purposes, extinct. Where once there were\r\nextensive areas, now there are only scattering oysters. In many cases\r\nthe beds have been so completely destroyed that the ground has been\r\ngranted for oyster culture. That Buzzards Bay is a \"natural set area\"\r\ncan be readily seen by the amount of \"seed oysters\" that are caught by\r\nthe oystermen who plant shells for the purpose.\r\n\r\n(11) _Bourne._--(_a_) _Red Brook Harbor._--In 1879 Ernest Ingersoll\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    On the southern shore of this harbor, about a mile from its\r\n    head, exists a living bed of natural oysters some 7 acres in\r\n    extent, under the protection of the town for public benefit.\r\n    The oysters growing on it are reported to be large, but not of\r\n    extraordinary size, scalloped and roundish, differing in no\r\n    respect from aged oysters grown after transplanting to another\r\n    part of the bay.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 this natural bed had been reduced to 3 acres, and the\r\nunproductive part granted.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Barlow River._--In 1873 an act was passed to protect the oyster\r\nfishery in Barlow River, by ordering a closed season of one and\r\none-half years. The passage of this act shows that a natural bed of\r\nimportance existed in this river, and that even in 1873 the effects of\r\noverfishing were apparent. At the present time there are but few native\r\noysters in Barlow River, or, as it is sometimes called, Pocasset River.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Monument River._--A natural bed also existed in Monument River,\r\nwhich became so depleted that about 1875 the river was surveyed and\r\ndivided into small grants.\r\n\r\n(12) _Wareham._--(_a_) _Wareham River._--Natural oysters are found in\r\nthe Wareham or Agawam River, which has been one of the most productive\r\nnatural beds in the State, and still furnishes a scant living for two\r\nor three men. In view of the overfishing, it is surprising that any\r\nof the natural oysters have survived, except on reserved areas of the\r\ntown, which are opened every three or seven years for the capture of\r\n\"seed.\"\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Weweantit River._--The Weweantit River, which lies between the\r\ntowns of Wareham and Marion, has a larger and better natural oyster bed\r\nthan the Wareham River, but this has also been depleted by overfishing,\r\nexcept on the reserved areas of the town of Wareham.\r\n\r\n(13) _Dartmouth._--A few oysters are found in Slocum's River.\r\n\r\n(14) _Westport._--Westport River has also a few oysters.\r\n\r\n(15) _Taunton River, Coles River and Lee's River._--These rivers once\r\nhad extensive beds of natural oysters, but now are wholly devoted to\r\ngrowing oysters. Old records and laws show how important these natural\r\nbeds were, and also furnish an excellent illustration of the effects of\r\noverfishing combined with water pollution from manufacturing sources.\r\n\r\nII. _Decline of the Natural Oyster Beds._--The above-mentioned examples\r\nfurnish abundant proof that the natural oyster beds of the State, which\r\nonce were sufficient to supply the wants of our forefathers, have\r\ndeclined to such an extent that at the present time but few natural\r\noysters are tonged for the market. Where there were formerly many acres\r\nof excellent native oysters, to-day there is scarcely an acre that can\r\nbe called good oyster fishing, except in a few cases where the towns\r\nmaintain a nearly perpetual closed season. No proof of the decline is\r\nnecessary; it is an established fact.\r\n\r\nThere have been two principal causes which have ruined the natural\r\noyster beds; besides these two,--(1) water pollution and (2)\r\noverfishing,--certain geographical changes have doubtless occurred,\r\nwhich have accelerated the decline.\r\n\r\n(1) _Water Pollution._--The effect of water pollution through the\r\nsediment deposited by sewage and manufacturing waste on the natural\r\noyster beds is well illustrated by the destruction of the Charles River\r\nbeds. This is also shown in a less degree in the Taunton River.\r\n\r\n(2) _Overfishing._--The primary cause of the decline of the natural\r\noyster beds was overfishing. This is particularly true of the beds\r\nsouth of Cape Cod and in Buzzards Bay, which were of large extent, and\r\nunpolluted by manufacturing wastes or sewage. This overfishing has\r\nnot been the result of the last few years, since records show that as\r\nearly as 1824 Harwich passed an act to preserve the oyster fishery\r\nof the town; and that Sandwich, in the part which is now the town of\r\nBourne, in 1832 passed regulations protecting the natural oyster\r\nfishery in Monument River; while at Wellfleet the natural oyster bed\r\nwas completely exterminated by the year 1775. Overfishing has affected\r\nthe natural beds in several ways, all of which have worked toward the\r\ngeneral decline of the native oyster.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The first settlers took the large oysters from the natural beds,\r\nwhich under normal conditions had all they could do to keep up the\r\nsupply. In this way the beds were deprived of the spawning oysters,\r\nwith the result that in spite of the closed seasons, which gave little\r\nif any benefit, a gradual decline set in.\r\n\r\n(_b_) At the same time that the oysters were being taken from the beds,\r\nthe early oystermen through ignorance were making an economic blunder\r\nby not returning the shells to the waters. The oyster shells furnish\r\nnaturally the best surfaces for the collection of \"seed,\" as spat will\r\nset only on clean surfaces. By taking the large oysters and with them\r\nthe shells and other débris from the bed, the natural oyster bars were\r\ndestroyed and less space given for the spat to catch. So both the\r\ntaking of the large oysters in excessive amounts and the destruction of\r\nthe natural spat collectors, either for lime, as was done at Wellfleet,\r\nor for other purposes, were sufficient in the early days to cause the\r\ndecline of the natural oyster beds.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In more recent times the destruction of the natural beds has been\r\nhastened by the taking of the small oysters. This practice was due to\r\ntwo reasons: (1) the supply of large oysters was exhausted; (2) oyster\r\nculture became important, and the natural beds were raked clean for\r\n\"seed\" which the oystermen obtained for planting on their grants. Thus\r\nthe oyster grant system has been the chief cause of the destruction of\r\nthe natural beds in the last forty years. It was only when the natural\r\nbeds failed that grants were given, and so oyster culture cannot be\r\nconsidered the primary cause of the destruction of the natural beds,\r\nbut only a later agency in their total extermination. The natural beds\r\nin Buzzards Bay all bear testimony to these three means of overfishing,\r\nand in recent years particularly to the last.\r\n\r\nIt has been a most fortunate thing for Massachusetts that the oyster\r\ngrant system was inaugurated as soon as the decline of the natural\r\nfishery became manifest, else at the present time there would be no\r\noysters in the State, for it is recognized that the present natural\r\nbeds are perpetuated by the spawn which comes from the various oyster\r\ngrants. Foresight has indeed provided an excellent oyster industry,\r\nwhich is rapidly improving. It is only necessary to apply similar\r\nmethods of culture to the other shellfish industries of the State to\r\ninsure their future also; otherwise the decline, which is following the\r\nsame steps as the destruction of the natural oyster beds, will lead to\r\nthe commercial extinction of these valuable fisheries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Results of the Survey._\r\n\r\nThe survey of the oyster industry has shown several interesting\r\nfacts which should be brought to the attention of the fishermen\r\nand consumers. In the first place, it has shown that the oyster\r\nfishery is a larger and more important industry than it has been\r\ncommonly considered, and that the welfare of the shore fisheries of\r\nsouthern Massachusetts depends upon its maintenance. Secondly, the\r\noyster industry is to-day in a position where it cannot reach its\r\nfull development for the reason merely that the present laws do not\r\nencourage the expansion of the industry. Thirdly, the oyster industry\r\nis trammeled by certain abuses, chiefly of a legal nature, which\r\nhinder its development, and upon the abolition of which depends its\r\nfuture success. Fourthly, the oyster industry under present conditions\r\nencroaches to some extent upon the other shellfish rights, especially\r\nin relation to the quahaug fishery, and has caused much jealous\r\nfeeling; but if properly regulated there should be room for both\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the opinion of the oystermen concerning the present\r\nabuses of the oyster industry, and how these could be best remedied,\r\nthe following question was asked of the individual planters: \"What\r\nmeasures or laws would, in your opinion, be best adapted for the\r\nimprovement of the oyster industry?\" Although many neglected to answer\r\nthis question, forty-three opinions were offered, dealing with the\r\nproblems which the oystermen consider as needing attention and upon\r\nwhich the welfare of the industry depends. These answers have been\r\narranged in tabular form, showing the number of oystermen who advocate\r\ncertain measures.\r\n\r\n                          MEASURES SUGGESTED.\r\n\r\n  Present laws satisfactory,                                      11\r\n  Direct State control of oyster industry,                        11\r\n  Town control, with right of appeal to the department of\r\n    fisheries and game,                                            1\r\n  Longer length of lease,                                          4\r\n  More certainty of re-leasing grants if improved,                 7\r\n  More protection for industry,                                    4\r\n  Right to grow all kinds of shellfish,                            1\r\n  More ground for cultivation,                                     1\r\n  State to forbid marketing of oysters from contaminated waters,   1\r\n  Provision for destruction of starfish,                           2\r\n                                                              ------\r\n      Total,                                                      43\r\n\r\nWhile these answers show a diversity of ideas, about 75 per cent.\r\nurge that something be done to improve the present system, and, while\r\nmany are in favor of placing the industry under State control, the\r\nmajority is definitely of the opinion that the present system of town\r\ncontrol is proving a serious drawback to the oyster industry. The best\r\ninterests of the oysterman and the consumer demand a better method of\r\nregulation of this industry. As long as town politics, partiality and\r\ncarelessness enter into the leasing of oyster grants, and thus deprive\r\ncertain people of their rights, it is safe to say that the oyster\r\nindustry can never get beyond its present state of development. One\r\nsolution of the difficulty might be full State control of leasing the\r\ngrounds for the oyster industry. This is possibly too radical a step\r\nat present, and the system can perhaps be so adjusted as to remedy its\r\ndefects without taking the control of the fishery entirely away from\r\nthe hands of the town. Another solution is to continue the system of\r\ntown control, but to have a State commission which would act as a board\r\nof appeal for all who felt aggrieved at the judgment of the selectmen.\r\n\r\nThe advisability of ten-year grants has caused much comment among the\r\noystermen. Practically all grants are now given for this period of\r\ntime. As a system it is deservedly unpopular, since it does not help\r\nthe quahaug interest, and it checks the development of the oyster\r\nindustry. The oyster business, unlike the other branches of shellfish\r\nculture, requires a considerable capital. This system of ten-year\r\ngrants operates directly to discourage the outlay of capital. If the\r\noysterman were sure of reaping the benefits of his labor and capital,\r\nit would be to his selfish interest to develop his own grant to its\r\nmaximum capacity. But what far-sighted business man will invest money\r\nin a business which stands a good chance of being completely \"wiped\r\nout\" in a few years? Again, this system makes three years out of the\r\nten practically worthless. The oysterman usually \"seeds\" his grant\r\nabout three years before he expects to reap his harvest; but when his\r\ngrant has run for seven years, it is evident that he will plant no more\r\noysters because of the uncertainty of obtaining a second lease, and\r\nnaturally does not desire to invest his labor and money for the benefit\r\nof an unknown successor.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for this is not difficult. If a grant were rented annually\r\nas long as the planter desired to hold it, to be forfeited if not\r\nimproved to a certain standard (to be decided upon), or for non-payment\r\nof rent, the difficulties above enumerated would disappear. Much of\r\nthe territory now held unimproved would either be brought up to a\r\nstandard of excellence or given over to the quahaugers, and in either\r\ncase direct benefits would result. If legislation were so arranged\r\nthat any man might take, by the payment of a nominal rent, a small\r\npiece of ground, which he could hold as long as he improved it, the\r\noyster industry could be put on a firmer footing; a man confident of\r\nenjoying the fruits of his labors could thus improve his grant, and, as\r\nhe acquired skill and knowledge, could add other land and ultimately\r\nexpect to build up a successful business.\r\n\r\nA third important suggestion relates to the marketing of oysters in\r\na sanitary condition. The oyster industry of the State has suffered\r\nseverely because of the scare resulting from the marketing of oysters\r\nfrom contaminated waters. The Cape and Buzzards Bay oysters are\r\nin general free from all sewage contamination, and should not be\r\nconsidered on the same basis as the impure varieties from outside\r\nthe State. Naturally, the Massachusetts oystermen desire that there\r\nbe some guarantee for the purity of the oysters marketed, as their\r\ninterests suffer because this impure stock is often sold under the name\r\nof the Cape oyster. If laws were passed requiring the inspection and\r\ncertification of marketed oysters in regard to healthful conditions\r\nunder which they have been produced, both the oyster planter and the\r\nconsumer would be benefited.\r\n\r\nThere is but little doubt that the oyster industry can be still\r\nfurther developed by opening waste territory which at this time does\r\nnot appear available, since under existing conditions proper capital\r\ncannot be induced to enter the business. The oyster industry demands\r\nmore attention than it has hitherto received, and must be considered an\r\nimportant asset of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History of the Industry._\r\n\r\nAlthough the oyster laws are the mile-stones which mark the progress\r\nof the oyster industry, and any consideration of the development of\r\nthese laws naturally gives many historical features, it is nevertheless\r\nnecessary, at the risk of repetition, to give a separate account of the\r\nhistory of the oyster fishery. The Massachusetts oyster fishery can be\r\ndivided historically into three distinct periods: (1) the free fishing\r\nperiod; (2) the period of bedding southern oysters; (3) the period of\r\noyster grants.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Free Native Fishery (1620-1840)._--In the early colonial\r\ndays the oyster fishery was considered in the same way as the other\r\nshellfisheries are now looked upon, _i.e._, held to be the common\r\nproperty of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth. The natural supply\r\nwas abundant enough to meet the needs of all the inhabitants, and for\r\nmany years no signs of decline were manifest. In 1775 the natural beds\r\nof Wellfleet gave out, furnishing the first record of unmistakable\r\ndecline. From that time there arose an extensive series of protective\r\nlaws, with the one object of preserving the natural supply by limiting\r\nthe demand. This policy of protective laws, though perhaps temporarily\r\nbeneficial, was based on an erroneous principle. It was preventive, but\r\nnot constructive, and did not build up the demolished fishery.\r\n\r\n(2) _Oyster Bedding (1840-70)._--With the decline of the natural beds,\r\nthe practice of bedding southern \"plants\" became an important part of\r\nthe oyster trade. The southern oysters were bedded on the flats in the\r\nspring and taken up for market in the fall. Salem, Wellfleet and Boston\r\nwere the leading places in this new phase of the oyster industry, and\r\nmany thousand bushels were annually planted.\r\n\r\n(3) _Oyster Grants (1870-1908)._--So successful was this summer\r\nbedding of southern oysters that experiments were soon made in rearing\r\noysters. This proved successful from the start, and within a few years\r\nthe extensive grant system which is now in vogue was inaugurated on\r\nCape Cod and Buzzards Bay.\r\n\r\nThese three methods, although separated by definite periods in which\r\neach have been the leaders, remain to a greater or less extent at\r\nthe present day. The natural beds are still in existence, and, as at\r\nWareham, are opened once in three or seven years, according to the\r\ndiscretion of the selectmen, for catching \"seed.\" The summer bedding of\r\noysters still continues, as certain planters find it more profitable to\r\nfatten than to grow oysters, and the oyster grant system is now in full\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the industry of 1907 with that of 1879 shows several\r\nchanges. These changes are for the most part improvements which have\r\narisen with the development of the industry. In some cases the changes\r\nhave been detrimental, and a few localities have shown a decline. New\r\nfields have opened to the oysterman both in new localities and through\r\nthe extension of the present beds. On the whole, there has been a great\r\nincrease in the grant system of oyster culture, while the \"bedding\"\r\nof southern \"plants,\" which in 1879 employed many men, boats and\r\nextensive capital, has practically disappeared. The annual production\r\nhas increased gradually, and for 1906-07 is approximately five times\r\nas large as in 1879. The following figures, except for 1907, are taken\r\nfrom the United States Fish Commission's reports, and show the gradual\r\nincrease in production:--\r\n\r\n  =========+==========+========\r\n    YEAR.  | Bushels. |  Value.\r\n  ---------+----------+--------\r\n  1879,    |  36,000  | $41,800\r\n  1887,    |  43,183  |  64,115\r\n  1888,    |  45,631  |  66,453\r\n  1898,    |  101,225 |$156,235\r\n  1902,    |  103,386 | 133,682\r\n  1907,[16]|  161,182 | 176,142\r\n  =========+==========+========\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Oyster Laws._\r\n\r\nIn submitting a complete report upon the oyster industry, the oyster\r\nlaws, which have played an important part in the development of the\r\nfishery, cannot be totally neglected. However, so important a subject\r\ndemands separate investigation, and offers excellent opportunities for\r\nlegal research. Therefore it is not the purpose of this report to give\r\nmore than a brief account of the present oyster laws and their history.\r\n\r\nThe shellfish laws of Massachusetts constitute the foundation of the\r\noyster industry, as they have taken a practically extinct native\r\nfishery and have built up the present extensive business. So closely\r\nare they connected with its welfare that the future of this growing\r\nindustry depends upon the proper expansion of these laws to meet the\r\nnew conditions.\r\n\r\nA survey of these oyster laws, with an analysis of their merits and\r\ndefects, is needed. Their defects have brought about the present\r\nunsatisfactory situation in certain localities, and should be remedied.\r\nTheir merits should be strengthened and amplified, as the basis of\r\nfuture expansion. They have come into being from time to time, in\r\nresponse to the immediate need of the hour; consequently they have no\r\nunity, and are, indeed, but imperfectly understood. An insight into\r\ntheir perplexing details should bring out many inconsistencies. Again,\r\nno comprehensive knowledge of the history of the industry is possible\r\nwithout a study of the laws. The errors once committed need not be\r\nrepeated to further embarrass the industry, and the lessons learned by\r\nexperience would be well applied to its future development.\r\n\r\n_Protective and Constructive Laws._--The oyster laws can be divided\r\ninto two classes: (1) protective; and (2) constructive. The early laws,\r\nwhich were passed to save the natural supply, were of the first class;\r\nwhile the laws establishing the present system of oyster culture come\r\nunder the second heading. The beginnings of all legislative enactment\r\narose in the treatment of the natural oyster beds. These beds were fast\r\nbecoming exhausted, when laws were passed to protect their important\r\nnatural resources. This measure was only partially successful. It did\r\nsucceed in preserving the remnant of those old beds from destruction,\r\nbut it was powerless to build up an industry of any extent. When it\r\nbecame clearly evident that no possible fostering of native resources\r\ncould supply the growing demands of the market, legislation quite\r\nlogically directed itself toward the artificial propagation of oysters.\r\nFrom this step arose a series of problems which long proved baffling,\r\nand still engross a great deal of public attention. The artificial\r\npropagation of oysters necessitated the leasing of grants in tidal\r\nwaters. This giving up of public property to private individuals\r\naroused the opposition of rival shellfish industries, who saw in this\r\nmeasure a curtailment of their resources. Numerous other difficulties\r\nof minor significance arose from time to time, all demanding attention\r\nat the hands of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nApart from the general supervision of the oyster industry, there\r\nhave been two other sources of legislative enactment. First, special\r\nlaws have been called for to regulate the fishery in certain waters\r\nunder the oversight of the State Board of Health. Secondly, during\r\nthe past few years the attention of the Legislature has been directed\r\ntowards the development of the oyster fishery as an important asset\r\nof the Commonwealth, and laws authorizing various experiments, both\r\nscientific and practical, have been passed in order to devise methods\r\nof increasing and developing the industry.\r\n\r\nI. _Protective Laws._--The history of the oyster laws of Massachusetts\r\nis a history of the industry itself. The rise and decline of the\r\nfishery are distinctly traceable in the development of the legal\r\nmachinery which regulates it. From the time of the Pilgrims the oyster\r\nbeds of the coast had been regarded as inexhaustible mines. The fallacy\r\nof this view gradually became apparent, as these beds began to be\r\ndepleted through overfishing. As early as 1796 a general law, entitled\r\n\"An act to prevent the destruction of oysters and other shellfish,\" was\r\npassed by the Legislature. Prior to 1869 the town of Harwich adopted\r\nthis old law. Shortly after, Swansea followed suit, and restricted the\r\nexploitation of her native oyster beds in the Lee and Cole rivers. In\r\n1870 Wellfleet inaugurated an innovation, in the nature of a permit\r\nto take oysters, which was required of all citizens of the town. The\r\nidea of this permit was to regulate the fishery, centralize control\r\nin the hands of the selectmen and add to the income of the town. In\r\n1873 Sandwich passed a law enforcing a close season on all her native\r\nbeds, to last for a period of one year. In 1875 Brewster followed the\r\nlead of Wellfleet, in demanding permits of all outsiders and also from\r\nall citizens taking more than 3 bushels at any one time, although an\r\nunlimited amount might be taken for food.\r\n\r\nThe aim of all this legislation was not to develop the industry\r\ndirectly, but indirectly by preserving and fostering the native beds.\r\nThis theory, while excellent in motive, did not work out well, as the\r\nnative beds could not by any possible protection be brought to produce\r\nan annual yield at all adequate to the growing demands of the market.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of purely natural resources proving unequal to the\r\ndemands of the occasion, the creation of other resources became\r\nnecessary, and an entirely new epoch in the history of the oyster\r\nfishery was inaugurated. This epoch marked the beginning of the\r\nproduction of oysters by artificial means, and the establishment of\r\nthis new industry and the perplexing complications which grew out of it\r\nhave been the source of legislative strife for many years.\r\n\r\nII. _Constructive Laws._--The first legislation authorizing the present\r\nsystem of oyster culture was instituted at Swansea, in 1869. This was\r\nthe beginning and the foundation of a broad movement of oyster culture\r\nwhich spread rapidly along the southern coast of the State. This\r\ncurious law allowed the selectmen to sell, by public or private sale,\r\nthe oyster privilege of Swansea outright to any person or persons who\r\nwere citizens of the town. The measure, although apparently designed\r\nto restrict the exhaustion of the native resources, did not tend to\r\ndevelop the industry. It possessed one element of value, i.e., it\r\nincreased the revenue of the town. Apart from its interest as the\r\nforerunner of artificial propagation of oysters, this old law is\r\nnoteworthy, as it forms the basis of the system which to-day regulates\r\nthe industry in that section of the country. The custom of selling an\r\nextensive oyster privilege, as apart from the system of leasing grants,\r\nfirst clearly outlined in the law of 1869, still holds throughout this\r\nsection. It remains the usual custom to sell either the whole of a\r\ntownship's available oyster territory, or else an extensive part of it,\r\nto one man for a lump sum per year.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 an important step occurred in the evolution of the oyster\r\nindustry. Swansea and Somerset were given the privilege of granting\r\nany of their bays, shores, banks and creeks for the propagation of\r\noysters. This act was far more sweeping and advanced than any of its\r\npredecessors, but it was in one respect too sweeping. It interfered\r\nwith the rights of the property owners along the shore, and was\r\ntherefore contrary to the general underlying principle of the State\r\nlaw, which allows the cultivation of oysters only in so far as such\r\ncultivation does not interfere with the vested rights of all citizens\r\nalike. The measure proved untenable, and was promptly repealed.\r\nIts repeal was on general principles a thing to be desired, but\r\nnevertheless a blow to the industry. The tidal waters along the coast\r\nhave always been the most valuable part of the oyster territory, as\r\nthey have proved to be the best adapted for obtaining \"oyster set.\"\r\nThis measure was therefore designed to aid the oyster growers, and give\r\nthem valuable privileges which belonged originally to the adjoining\r\nproperty owners. Even to the present day the dividing line between\r\nthe rights of property owners and oystermen has remained an unsettled\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the close season proved a failure in\r\nBuzzards Bay, and the towns of Wareham, Bourne and Marion turned their\r\nattention toward the establishment of an oyster industry. This attempt\r\nbecame a settled policy of these towns about 1875.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 a peculiar act was passed, making it unlawful for any person\r\nto remove oysters from any grant, even his own, between the hours\r\nof sunset and sunrise. This act was necessary for the protection of\r\nthe oyster planters, by preventing the stealing of oysters from the\r\ngrant at night. Various efforts had been made to protect grants from\r\nsuch attacks, but the extreme difficulty of detection was always an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to proper enforcement, and it was deemed expedient\r\nto prohibit all fishing at night. That this problem had become an\r\nimportant one is shown by the title of the law, which was styled\r\n\"An act for the better protection of the oyster fisheries in this\r\ncommonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1884 an important act was passed, enlarging the limits of that\r\nterritory which might lawfully be used for the cultivation of oysters.\r\nPractically all communal waters outside the jurisdiction of adjacent\r\nland owners was thrown open for oyster grants.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the institution of a public hearing was inaugurated. This was a\r\nconcession to the hostile quahaug element, and allowed the public the\r\nopportunity of protesting against the granting of territory for oyster\r\nculture; nevertheless, the final power really remained in the hands of\r\nthe selectmen. A further concession to this element was the law which\r\ncalled for the revoking of grants within two years if unimproved. The\r\ninterests of the oystermen were also kept in sight, and legislation\r\npassed which was designed to protect grants still more from the\r\ndepredations of outsiders. Provision was likewise made for the proper\r\nenforcement of these laws, and the penalties attached were increased.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 an act was passed which was designed to do away with all\r\npossible outside monopoly. The danger of organized capital acquiring\r\ncontrol of a large tract and excluding small individual planters had\r\nbecome apparent, and this means was taken to guard against it. The act\r\nprohibited the transfer of grants in any township to any person not a\r\ncitizen of that township; thus, if any monopoly did exist it would be\r\nrestricted to only one township. The limits during which fishing on\r\ngrants might be carried on was lengthened two hours, so that it read\r\nfrom \"one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the town of Yarmouth obtained a law requiring a permit for\r\ncitizens to take oysters from native beds, not exceeding 2 bushels per\r\nweek, from September 1 to June 1. This is now the only town in the\r\nCommonwealth to require such a permit from citizens.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 legislation was passed relative to the proper definition of\r\nthe boundaries of grants. This was rendered necessary because of\r\nthe haphazard methods hitherto pursued in giving grants with very\r\nindefinite boundaries. Mean low-water mark was fixed as the shoreward\r\nboundary of grants, while mean high-water mark was defined as the limit\r\nto which shells might be placed to catch the set. This, however, was\r\ndependent upon the owners of the adjacent property, and their consent\r\nwas held necessary before this territory between high and low water\r\ncould thus be utilized.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 special legislation was passed, restricting the catching of\r\noysters in contaminated waters except for bait.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 authority was granted to proper officials to develop the oyster\r\nindustry by planting shellfish, or by close season.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the Fish and Game Commission was authorized to expend a sum\r\nnot exceeding $500 per annum for the investigation of the oyster, by\r\nexperiment or otherwise, with a view to developing the industry.\r\n\r\nThe development of the oyster laws has been by a process of evolution.\r\nThey have kept pace with the growth of the industry, and have been in\r\nfact the logical outcome of that expansion. The various acts which go\r\nto make up the bulk of this legislation have been passed from time to\r\ntime to fill the immediate demands of the hour, and consequently lack\r\nthat unity and consistency which might otherwise characterize them.\r\nChanging conditions have called for alterations in the legal machinery,\r\nas the industry has expanded, to meet new requirements. These additions\r\nhave frequently been dictated by short-sighted policy, and the\r\nCommonwealth as a whole has often been lost sight of in the welfare of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nOf all the shellfisheries, the oyster industry is most hampered by\r\nunwise legislation. It is the most difficult to handle, because it\r\npresents many perplexing phases from which the others are free. Clams,\r\nquahaugs and scallops flourish in their respective territories, and\r\nlegislation merely tends to regulate their exploitation or marketing.\r\nWith the oyster, however, other problems have arisen. The areas in the\r\nState where oysters grow naturally are few in number and relatively\r\nof small importance. The clam, quahaug and scallop grounds are to be\r\ncompared with wild pastures and meadows, which yield their harvests\r\nwithout cultivation; while the oyster grants are gardens, which must be\r\nplanted and carefully tended.\r\n\r\nWith this distinction arises another question, of far-reaching\r\nsignificance,--the question of private ownership. The quahaug, clam\r\nand scallop fisheries demand that the tidal flats and waters be held\r\nin common as communal interests, and freely open to all citizens of\r\nthe town; the oyster fishery requires that certain portions of these\r\nflats and waters be set aside for private ownership. With the economic\r\nquestions involved in this discussion it is not the purpose of this\r\nreport to deal. There is one fact, in any case, which cannot be argued\r\naway. The oyster industry is dependent solely upon private ownership\r\nof grants. If, therefore, the oyster industry is to be encouraged at\r\nall,--and it certainly has very great possibilities,--this fact of\r\nprivate ownership must be accepted at once. If, as some assert, it is\r\nan evil, it is a necessary evil, and it has come to stay. The questions\r\nremaining for legislation on this subject are the proper regulation of\r\nthis private ownership, so as to give the maximum of encouragement to\r\nthe oyster fishery, and the minimum of danger to the rival shellfish\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe oyster and quahaug industries openly clash. This is an unfortunate\r\noccurrence, but it cannot be avoided, since the ground suitable for\r\nthe culture of oysters is almost always the natural home of the\r\nquahaug. Therefore, when portions of this ground are given out to\r\nprivate individuals for the production of oysters, the available\r\nquahaug territory is necessarily reduced. Over this question endless\r\ndisputes have arisen. The problem is undoubtedly one requiring delicate\r\nadjustment; but there is no reason why these two industries should not\r\nflourish side by side, as there would be plenty of room for both if all\r\nthe available territory were properly utilized.\r\n\r\nThere is one important feature of this problem, however, which the\r\npresent laws have wholly failed to recognize. Wherever practicable,\r\nthe best of the quahaug territory should not be granted; and as far as\r\npossible, the oystermen should utilize only those tracts of territory\r\nwhich are not naturally very productive of quahaugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Oyster Industry._\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who perhaps are not familiar with the methods\r\nemployed in the oyster industry, the following brief account is given:--\r\n\r\nI. _Selecting the Grant._--The oysterman, in selecting a grant, has to\r\nconsider first the nature of the soil; and secondly, the location as\r\ninfluencing the growth of the oyster. Not less important is the quality\r\nof the oyster, which means not only a good price, but also readiness\r\nof sale, as the oysters produced in certain localities are especially\r\ndesirable in appearance and flavor.\r\n\r\nAs the oyster will not grow on all kinds of bottom, but demands a firm\r\nsoil, free from soft mud and shifting sand, the oyster area of the\r\nState is naturally limited. Usually but part of an oysterman's grant is\r\nsuitable for the cultivation of oysters, and he is forced to let the\r\nrest of the territory lie idle, unless he can, with shells or gravel,\r\nartificially change this waste area into suitable ground. Shifting sand\r\nperhaps can never be made suitable for oysters; but many acres of soft\r\nmud can be made productive, if the oysterman only has a reasonable\r\nguarantee that he would receive the results of his labor.\r\n\r\nWhile the oyster culture is limited by the nature of the bottom, it is\r\nalso restricted by other conditions. The salinity of the water has much\r\nto do with the rapidity of growth, and the oysters seem to thrive in\r\nlocalities where a slight amount of fresh water enters. The amount of\r\nfood in the water is the principal factor in the rate of growth, and\r\nto this is due the fact that the rate of growth varies considerably\r\nin different localities. As a rule, the beds with good circulation of\r\nwater (_i.e._, currents) show the more rapid growth.\r\n\r\nII. _Collecting the \"Seed.\"_--The term \"seed\" is applied to one, two,\r\nthree and even four year old oysters which the oystermen plant on their\r\ngrants. These grants are in reality salt-water gardens, requiring\r\nconstant supervision; and the obtaining of the \"seed\" for planting is a\r\nmost important consideration. The gathering of the oyster \"seed\" is a\r\nsimple process, but one which requires much research.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer, usually during the months of June and July in\r\nthese waters, the Massachusetts oyster spawns. Both sperm from the\r\nadult male and the eggs from the adult female oysters are extruded\r\nin considerable quantities into the water, and there the eggs are\r\nfertilized. As fertilization is somewhat a matter of accident,\r\nundoubtedly the great majority of eggs never develop. The fertilized\r\neggs pass rapidly through various changes in the course of a few hours,\r\nand emerge as microscopic embryos, with thin, transparent coverings.\r\nAt this period these forms are free swimming, and are found in great\r\nnumbers in the water. They are extremely delicate, and great quantities\r\nare destroyed by natural agencies, such as cold storms, sudden changes\r\nin temperature, etc. They likewise are subject to the depredations of\r\nall sorts of marine creatures, and comparatively few in proportion\r\nsurvive. The survivors, after leading this free-swimming existence for\r\nseveral days, settle to the bottom, where they attach themselves by\r\na calcareous fixative to stones, shells, pieces of wood, etc. Here,\r\nunless buried by silt and soft mud or killed by exposure, poisonous\r\npollution, etc., the young oyster rapidly becomes of a size suitable\r\nfor planting.\r\n\r\nThe economic utilization of this scientific knowledge is as follows:\r\nshells offer a very good surface for the attachment of the young\r\noyster, and many thousand bushels are annually strewn over the bottom\r\nprevious to the spawning season. Considerable judgment is needed in\r\nchoosing the right time to plant these shells, which after a few\r\nweeks in the water become so coated with slime that fixation of the\r\n\"spat\" becomes impossible. In Massachusetts the area between high and\r\nlow water mark has been found by experiment to be the most valuable\r\nterritory for this purpose, as shells planted here collect the heaviest\r\nset and can be handled with the least expense. A projecting sand bar or\r\npoint with a current is also well adapted for catching oyster spat.\r\n\r\nThe scallop shell is the most serviceable in spat collecting, because\r\nit is more brittle, and the clusters of oysters when attached are\r\nreadily broken apart. After the oysterman has obtained a successful\r\nset, he allows the young oysters to obtain a suitable growth before he\r\nmakes a final planting, either in the spring or fall.\r\n\r\nIII. _Size of the \"Seed\" used for Planting._--While many oysters are\r\nraised from native spat in the Buzzards Bay district, the greater\r\npart of the seed is purchased in Connecticut and Long Island, and is\r\ncarried in schooners or steamers to Massachusetts waters. The usual\r\nprice ranges from 35 cents to $1 per bushel, according to size and\r\nquality. The oystermen cannot always choose the size of \"seed\" they\r\ndesire for planting, as the set of any one year is very uncertain,\r\nand several seasons may pass before a large quantity of \"seed\" can be\r\nobtained. Thus the oyster planters are forced to take whatever size\r\nthey can obtain, whether it be two, three or four year old \"seed.\" As\r\na rule, the small \"seed\" is most in demand, as it means relatively\r\nfaster growth and less money invested. Often, when the ground is most\r\nfavorable for fattening, large oysters are preferred for planting,\r\nand certain oystermen make this line of work a specialty. Certain\r\nlocalities where there is plenty of lime in the water are well adapted\r\nfor growth, and yet produce poor-\"meated\" oysters, while in other\r\ngrounds the reverse is true. The oystermen occasionally by a double\r\ntransfer utilize both grounds, planting oyster \"seed\" for the first few\r\nyears in the rapid-growing localities, and then transplanting the large\r\noysters to the \"fattening\" ground six months before marketing.\r\n\r\nIV. _Preparing the Grant._--The first step in preparing the grant is to\r\nremove all débris. In the deep water, this is usually done by dredging;\r\nin the shallow water, by whatever means is the easiest. If the bottom\r\nis of firm soil, the grant is then ready for planting; however, if the\r\nsoil is soft mud, it is necessary to shell the bottom in order to give\r\nit greater firmness. The oysterman continually has to keep a sharp\r\nlookout in order to protect his grant from enemies such as the starfish\r\nand the oyster drill, and to keep it clear of seaweed and other matter\r\nwhich would interfere with the growth of the oyster.\r\n\r\nV. _Sowing the \"Seed.\"_--The \"seed\" oysters are planted on the prepared\r\nbed by scattering them with shovels or scoops from the boats and scows.\r\nThe oysterman, knowing the maximum amount of \"seed\" the bed will grow\r\nto the best advantage, plants the required number, taking care that\r\nthe oysters are properly scattered, as for the best growth oysters\r\nshould lie separate and not in crowded masses. The amount of \"seed\"\r\nthat can be planted on a given area depends upon the natural conditions\r\nof the locality.\r\n\r\nVI. _Enemies._--The oyster, having passed through the countless dangers\r\nof his embryonic career, is still harassed by several enemies. Of\r\nthese, the most destructive is the starfish. This animal, commonly\r\nknown as the \"five-finger,\" occurs along the entire Massachusetts\r\ncoast, and is especially abundant in Buzzards Bay. Occasionally whole\r\noyster beds are wiped out by this pest, which sweeps over the ground\r\nin vast armies. The method of attack of the starfish is unique. By\r\nexerting with its tube feet a steady pull in opposite directions\r\non both valves of the shell of the victim, the starfish tires the\r\ncontracted muscle of the oyster, and the shells open. The starfish then\r\nextrudes its stomach so as to enwrap the prey, and in this curious\r\nmanner devours the oyster.\r\n\r\nA close second to the starfish in amount of damage is the oyster\r\n\"drill\" or \"borer\" (_Urosalpinx cinerea_). This little mollusk with its\r\nrasping tongue drills a small hole through the shell of the oyster, and\r\nthen sucks out the contents.\r\n\r\nA third enemy, according to the oyster planters, is the \"winkle\"\r\n(_Fulgur carica_ and _F. caniculatus_). The method of attack is\r\nsomewhat obscure.\r\n\r\nBesides this dangerous trio of living enemies, the oyster is subject to\r\nconstant peril from inanimate agencies. Probably the greatest of these\r\nis shifting bottom. Where oysters are grown on sandy soil, the violent\r\nwaves of winter storms frequently tear up the bottom, or else the force\r\nof currents is such as to kill the oysters by completely burying them\r\nin the sand. Again, if the oysters are growing in very muddy bottom\r\nthey are constantly liable to be smothered in the slimy ooze. Ice in\r\nwinter frequently tears oysters from their beds and bears them to some\r\nunfavorable environment, where they soon die.\r\n\r\nVII. _Harvesting the Oysters._--The oysterman completes his planting\r\nabout June 1. During the summer months, the growing period of the\r\noyster, the grants remain idle except for the care and supervision of\r\nthe oystermen. As the oyster takes from three to five years to attain\r\nits growth, the oysterman practically harvests but one-fourth to\r\none-third of his entire stock each year, beginning about September 1\r\nand continuing through the winter as the weather permits.\r\n\r\nIn winter the oysterman, to keep up the market supply, beds \"culled\"\r\noysters near the shore, where he can tong them through the ice whenever\r\nit is impossible to obtain oysters from his grant.\r\n\r\nThe implements used in gathering the oyster harvest are of three\r\nkinds: tongs, dredges and rakes. Tongs are employed principally by the\r\nsmaller oyster growers, and on ground where the water is comparatively\r\nshallow. A pair of tongs is really a pair of long-handled rakes,\r\nfastened together like a pair of shears. The pole, corresponding to\r\nthe blade of the shears, varies from 8 to 16 feet in length. The\r\nrakes, some 2 to 2½ feet broad, are so fitted to the end of the poles\r\nthat when extended by spreading the handles they rest upon the bottom\r\nparallel to each other. These tongs are usually worked from skiffs or\r\nflat-bottomed boats, the oystermen first separating the tips of the\r\nhandles and then bringing them together, thus causing a corresponding\r\nmovement of the two rakes, which with their 2-inch iron teeth gather in\r\nall the intervening oysters. The tongs with their burden of oysters are\r\nthen lifted into the boat, emptied, and the process repeated.\r\n\r\nDredging is a much faster and less laborious method of oystering\r\nthan tonging, and can be carried on over a much larger territory.\r\nThe oyster dredge consists of a bag of woven iron rings attached\r\nto an iron framework. From each corner of the framework iron rods\r\nextend, converging at a point some feet away. At this point the rope\r\nis attached, by which the dredge is dragged from either a sail or\r\npower boat. The blade, resting horizontally on the surface, is armed\r\nwith teeth which rake the oysters into the bag. When this bag, which\r\nholds from 3 to 8 bushels, is full, the dredge is raised, usually by a\r\nwindlass worked by steam, gasolene or hand power, as the case may be,\r\nits contents dumped out and the dredge lowered for another haul.\r\n\r\nRakes, the third implement in general use, are not employed as\r\nextensively as tongs or dredges, but are used in still water, where the\r\nbottom is suitable.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Marketing._--The \"catch\" as soon as it is dredged or tonged\r\nis brought in boats to the oyster houses, where men with hatchets or\r\nsimilar implements break apart the clustered oysters and cast aside\r\nthe empty shells, bits of rock, etc. Three different varieties of\r\nmarketable oysters are usually sorted out, according to size: (1)\r\nlarge, (2) medium and (3) small. The respective sizes vary somewhat\r\nwith the locality, demands of the market and the season; but the large\r\noysters commonly count about 900 to the barrel, the medium 1,000 or\r\nmore, while the small run 1,200 or over.\r\n\r\nThe different sizes as they are sorted out are packed in barrels and\r\nare then ready for shipment. The principal markets are of course New\r\nYork and Boston, though the demand farther inland is increasing, and\r\nshipments to Chicago or places even farther west are frequently made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Statistics._\r\n\r\nThe following facts concerning the oyster industry have been compiled\r\nfrom the written statements of the different oystermen. Complete\r\nreturns have not been received from Wareham, Barnstable, and Falmouth,\r\nwhile possibly a few oystermen in the other towns have been overlooked.\r\nFalmouth raises but few oysters for the market and these returns have\r\nbeen recorded, the remaining oystermen merely planting for their own\r\nuse. In the towns of Barnstable and Wareham about four-fifths of the\r\noystermen have made returns. The facts given in the following tables\r\nare based only on the returns at hand, and therefore do not give a\r\ncomplete report for these two towns.\r\n\r\n                          STATISTICAL SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n  ====================+==============+============================+=======\r\n                      |   NUMBER OF  |   AREA OF WORKED GRANTS    |\r\n        TOWN.         |    GRANTS.   |        (ACRES).            |Number\r\n  --------------------+------+-------+------+---------+-----------+of Men.\r\n                      |Total.|Worked.|Total.|Suitable.|Unsuitable.|\r\n  --------------------+------+-------+------+---------+-----------+-------\r\n  Wellfleet,          |    35|     23|   967|      810|        157|    14\r\n  Chatham,            |    21|     21|    65|       55|         10|    20\r\n  Dennis-Yarmouth,    |     4|      2|    10|       10|          -|     3\r\n  Barnstable,         |    29|     29|   188|      121|         67|    33\r\n  Falmouth,           |    22|      6|    44|       23|         21|     5\r\n  Bourne,             |   135|     42|   100|       83|         17|    21\r\n  Wareham,            |   125|     70|   196|      159|         37|    26\r\n  Fall River district,|    14|     14|   810|      510|        300|    36\r\n  Nantucket,          |     2|      1|    20|        3|         17|     1\r\n                      +------+-------+------+---------+-----------+-------\r\n     Total,           |   387|    208| 2,400|    1,774|        626|   159\r\n  ====================+======+=======+======+=========+===========+=======\r\n\r\n                           CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\n  ================+========+===========+===========+==========+==========\r\n        TOWN.     | Boats. |Implements.|  Shore    |   Bedded |   Total.\r\n                  |        |           | Property. |  Oysters.|\r\n  ----------------+--------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n  Wellfleet,      | $10,115|      $575 |    $1,200 |  $19,500 |  $31,390\r\n  Chatham,        |   1,695|       313 |     1,225 |   23,300 |   26,533\r\n  Dennis-Yarmouth,|      25|        50 |       100 |    5,000 |    5,175\r\n  Barnstable,     |   5,269|     1,139 |     4,300 |   28,850 |   39,558\r\n  Falmouth,       |   1,525|       105 |     1,000 |      450 |    3,080\r\n  Bourne,         |   5,515|       483 |       150 |   18,300 |   24,448\r\n  Wareham,        |   9,355|     1,120 |     2,420 |   27,725 |   40,620\r\n  Fall River      |        |           |           |          |\r\n     district,    |  19,840|     2,000 |     6,200 |   68,500 |   96,540\r\n  Nantucket,      |     518|        15 |        25 |      800 |    1,358\r\n                  +--------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n     Total,       | $53,857|    $5,800 |   $16,620 | $192,425 | $268,702\r\n  ================+========+===========+===========+==========+==========\r\n\r\n                         PRODUCTION OF 1906-07.\r\n\r\n  ================+====================+==================+===========\r\n                  | MARKETABLE OYSTERS.|   SEED OYSTERS.  |   Total\r\n      TOWN.       +---------+----------+--------+---------+   Value.\r\n                  | Bushels.|  Value.  |Bushels.|  Value. |\r\n  ----------------+---------+----------+--------+---------+-----------\r\n  Wellfleet,      |  22,500 |  $24,850 |  1,000 |  $1,000 |  $25,850\r\n  Chatham,        |  14,550 |   23,987 |      - |       - |   23,987\r\n  Dennis-Yarmouth,|   1,000 |    1,500 |      - |       - |    1,500\r\n  Barnstable,     |  25,850 |   48,050 |    100 |     100 |   48,150\r\n  Falmouth,       |   3,012 |    6,025 |      - |       - |    6,025\r\n  Bourne,         |   2,100 |    4,100 | 23,000 |  15,000 |   19,100\r\n  Wareham,        |   7,770 |   12,790 | 22,100 |  12,090 |   24,880\r\n  Fall River      |         |          |        |         |\r\n     district,    |  38,000 |   26,250 |      - |       - |   26,250\r\n  Nantucket,      |     200 |      400 |      - |       - |      400\r\n                  +---------+----------+--------+---------+-----------\r\n     Total,       | 114,982 | $147,952 | 46,200 | $28,190 | $176,142\r\n  ================+=========+==========+========+=========+===========\r\n\r\n                    SECTIONAL ARRANGEMENT OF TOWNS.\r\n\r\n  _A._ North side of Cape Cod:--\r\n          1.

In spite of the success of the past years, the industry is\r\ndeclining, indicating, possibly, that after 1910 no more grants will be\r\nleased.\r\n\r\nFour parts of the bay are taken up by oyster grants in the vicinity of:\r\n(1) Mayo's Beach; (2) Great Island; (3) Indian Neck; (4) Lieutenant's\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n(1) Nine grants, covering an area of 176 acres of both flats and\r\ndeeper water, extend out from Mayo's Beach a distance of 1,500\r\nfeet. These grants extend along shore from Commercial Wharf to Egg\r\nIsland, a distance of 3,500 feet. Seven of these grants have each a\r\nshore extension of 200 feet, the other 2 having 600 and 1,500 feet\r\nrespectively. The principal planting on these grants is done by D.\r\nAtwood & Co.\r\n\r\n(2) On the west side of the bay, along the shores of Great Island and\r\nBeach Hill, there are 7 grants which are now worked. Originally there\r\nwere 12 grants in this locality, but 5 of them expired some time ago.\r\nThe area included in these 5 grants is 500 acres, while the entire\r\ngranted area covers 708 acres. Wright & Willis, R. R. Higgins and L. D.\r\nBaker have done most of the planting on these grants in the past few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n(3) On the east side of the bay, near Indian Neck, are 5 grants,\r\ncomprising 224 acres. J. A. Stubbs does all the planting here. A single\r\ngrant of 11 acres of flats is held in Duck Creek Cove by J. C. Wiles.\r\nThese grants extend along the shore for 2,000 yards and run out into\r\nthe bay for 1,000 yards.\r\n\r\n(4) Off Lieutenant's Island are 8 grants, comprising a total area of\r\n1,062 acres. Only 3 of these, comprising 559 acres, are now worked.\r\nJoseph Crosby of Osterville is the principal planter on these grants.\r\n\r\nFrom the statistical returns of the oyster planters it is found that\r\n23 grants are now held for oyster planting, comprising an area of 967\r\nacres; 810 acres, or 83 per cent. of this area, is suitable for oyster\r\nculture. There is very little soft mud bottom, only 82 acres, while the\r\nshifting sand area is 75 acres.\r\n\r\nThe total area of grants ever leased at Wellfleet comprises 2,182\r\nacres, of which 1,473 are now held. The average depth of water over\r\nthese grants at mean low tide is 4 feet, the extremes running from 1 to\r\n12 feet.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                           $31,390\r\n  Power boats,                                      4\r\n  Value of power boats,                        $9,250\r\n  Sail boats,                                       4\r\n  Value of sail boats,                           $750\r\n  Dories and skiffs,                                8\r\n  Value of dories and skiffs,                    $115\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                     14\r\n      Tongs,                                       12\r\n  Value of implements,                           $575\r\n  Value of shore property,                     $1,200\r\n  Value of oysters on grant,                  $19,500\r\n\r\nMost of the oystering is done by dredging, two large gasolene oyster\r\nboats, the \"Cultivator\" and the \"Marion,\" being employed for this\r\npurpose. Tongs are also used extensively. Fourteen men are engaged from\r\nsix to twelve months each year in the oyster business.\r\n\r\nThe production for 1906-07 was 22,500 bushels of marketable oysters,\r\nvalued at $24,850; and 1,000 bushels of \"seed,\" worth approximately\r\n$1,000. Most of the planted \"seed\" is obtained from Long Island and\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nThe damage from the natural enemies of the oyster is reported as very\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nThe Wellfleet oyster has a peculiar salty flavor not possessed by other\r\noysters. For some trade this is preferred, while for others it is not\r\nso desirable. Before marketing the extreme saltiness is sometimes\r\nremoved by floating the oysters in Duck Creek, where the water is less\r\nsalt, using large, scow-like floats, 30 by 15 feet.\r\n\r\nSeveral Boston firms are engaged in oyster culture at Wellfleet,\r\nincluding D. Atwood & Co., J. A. Stubbs and R. R. Higgins.\r\n\r\nFor years there has been a conflict between the quahaugers and the\r\noystermen at Wellfleet. This is very natural, owing to the rivalry\r\nbetween the two industries and the rapid rise of the quahaug fishery in\r\nthe last fifteen years. Owing to their greater number, the quahaugers\r\nhave obtained the upper hand in town affairs, with the result that\r\nin 1910, when all the oyster leases run out, it is said that no more\r\nwill be granted, and the oyster business of Wellfleet will come to an\r\nend. This is especially unfortunate for the town, as there is room\r\nfor both industries, and the destruction of either one would be a\r\ngreat financial loss. It is hoped that some means can be devised to\r\nstraighten out the difficulties between the opposing factions before\r\neither industry is ruined.\r\n\r\nBut little oyster spat has ever been caught in Wellfleet Bay. That\r\noysters will set there is evidenced by the young \"seed\" caught on the\r\npiles of the wharves and on stones and rocks around the harbor. It is\r\nnoteworthy that at Wellfleet the spat sets only between the tide lines,\r\nand does not catch where water is constantly over the ground. This is\r\ndirectly contrary to the conditions in Long Island Sound, where the set\r\nis caught in deep water. E. P. Cook and J. A. Stubbs have tried spat\r\ncollecting in Herring River for several years, with the results of one\r\nor two good sets, the best being caught by Mr. Cook in 1906. The other\r\nyears have proved failures in this line. There is no question but that\r\noyster spat can be profitably caught if sufficient interest is taken in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nThe early laws were as follows:--\r\n\r\n    In 1772 a law having been enacted by the General Court,\r\n    regulating the taking of oysters in Billingsgate Bay, an\r\n    amendment to that act was now asked by the town, namely, that\r\n    during the summer months oysters shall not be taken to market,\r\n    nor fished by the inhabitants of the town for their own use\r\n    during the months of July and August.\r\n\r\nIn 1773:--\r\n\r\n    That, inasmuch as the oyster fishery, which is of great\r\n    value to the town and of great advantage to the Province,\r\n    has received detriment from persons taking young oysters,\r\n    the enactment of more stringent regulations are necessary to\r\n    prevent their destruction.\r\n\r\nThese early laws show that the natural oyster beds were highly prized\r\nby the Inhabitants in colonial days, and that measures, even then,\r\nwere necessary to prevent their extinction. At the present time\r\nWellfleet has no other regulations than the general oyster laws of the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe history of the oyster industry of Wellfleet can be divided into\r\nthree periods: (1) the natural oyster fishery; (2) the \"bedding\" of\r\nsouthern oysters; (3) oyster planting.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Natural Oyster Beds of Wellfleet._--The first settlers found\r\na natural oyster bed near Hitchin's Creek, or Silver Spring, in 1644,\r\nand it is said that oysters were very abundant at that time. Old shells\r\nare occasionally dredged or raked up at the present day from these\r\nbeds. The Rev. Enoch Pratt, in his \"History of Eastham, Wellfleet and\r\nOrleans,\" gives the following account of this early oyster industry:--\r\n\r\n    Oysters were found in great abundance on the flats at the first\r\n    settlement [1644], but at this time [1770] the inhabitants had\r\n    so increased and such quantities were taken for consumption and\r\n    for the Boston market, that it became necessary, to prevent\r\n    their entire destruction, for the district to take measures to\r\n    preserve and propagate them.... Shops and stands were opened\r\n    in Boston, Salem, Portland and other places, where the oysters\r\n    were sold in quantities to suit the purchaser.\r\n\r\n    In 1775 all the oysters in the bay died. What caused their\r\n    destruction is not certainly known, but it is supposed that\r\n    as, at this time, a large number of blackfish died and came on\r\n    shore, where their carcasses remained, producing a very filthy\r\n    condition of the water, it caused this mortality.\r\n\r\nA more probable explanation is given by Mr. E. P. Cook of Wellfleet.\r\nThe early inhabitants, not knowing the value of the natural shell beds\r\nfor catching the spat, greedily took every shell and burned them into\r\nlime as a fertilizer for their farms and plaster for their houses.\r\nThere was once a fine strip of woods near this original oyster rock,\r\nbut this was cut down, and the sand gradually washed over the beds,\r\nkilling the young oysters. To these two causes can be attributed the\r\nfinal destruction of the natural beds in 1775.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Bedding of Southern Oysters._--After the destruction of the\r\nnatural beds, an important industry arose in the \"bedding\" of southern\r\noysters for northern trade. Privileges for bedding oysters on the flats\r\nwere granted to a number of oyster firms. These men hired schooners\r\nin the latter part of the winter or the early spring, which went to\r\nthe southern oyster grounds and brought back loads of oysters. These\r\noysters were spread or bedded over the leased flats of the harbor,\r\nwhere they remained until the following fall, when they were taken up\r\nfor market. In this way the oysters gained in size by the summer's\r\ngrowth, and were fattened for market. Considerable trade sprang up in\r\nthe carrying of oysters, and many vessels were engaged in this traffic.\r\nIn 1841 Mr. Gould, the conchologist, states that 120 men, with 30\r\nvessels of about 40 tons each, were employed for three months of the\r\nyear, and brought to the town an annual revenue of $8,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Capt. William Dill is credited with bringing into Wellfleet the\r\nfirst cargo from Virginia, which started a large trade in Chesapeake\r\noysters. Mr. Ernest Ingersoll makes the following statement concerning\r\nthe Virginia trade:--\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless, it was not until about 1845 or 1850 that the\r\n    business began to confine itself to Virginia oysters, and a\r\n    large business to be done. At its height, about 1850, it is\r\n    probable that more than 100,000 bushels a year were laid down\r\n    in the harbor; some say 150,000.... The favorite ground was at\r\n    the mouth of Herring River.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Enoch Pratt writes, in 1844:--\r\n\r\n    The inhabitants of the town tried the experiment of bringing\r\n    oysters from the south and laying them down on the flats, which\r\n    succeeded well. In the course of a year they doubled their\r\n    size and their quality was much improved. This soon became a\r\n    large business, and a number of vessels have been employed in\r\n    the spring of every year in bringing them here. The number of\r\n    bushels which are now [1844] annually brought is about 60,000.\r\n    Nearly all the oyster shops and stands in Boston, and other\r\n    cities and towns in this State, are supplied from this place,\r\n    and are kept by persons belonging to the town. This business\r\n    affords a living for many families.\r\n\r\nMr. Ernest Ingersoll thus describes the decline of the oyster trade in\r\n1870:--\r\n\r\n    The war of the rebellion, however, interfered somewhat with the\r\n    oyster trade, and it began to decline so far as Wellfleet was\r\n    concerned. Then the various dealers in northern ports, having\r\n    learned something, began to bed near home in their own harbors,\r\n    and so saved freightage. Finally, the steamers from Norfolk\r\n    and the railways entered into so serious a competition that\r\n    fully ten years ago [1870] Wellfleet Bay was wholly deserted\r\n    by the oystermen as a bedding ground, though her vessels still\r\n    continue to carry cargoes in winter from Virginia to Boston,\r\n    Portland, Salem, Portsmouth and the Providence River, to supply\r\n    the active trade and fill the new beds, which the dealers at\r\n    these various ports had learned could be established at home.\r\n    The reader thus discovers how important a part Wellfleet has\r\n    played in the history of the oyster trade of New England. A\r\n    hundred thousand bushels of the bivalves once grew fat along\r\n    her water front, and thousands of dollars were dispensed\r\n    to the citizens in the industry they created. Now [1880] a\r\n    little experimental propagation, to the value of a few hundred\r\n    dollars, and about 6,000 bushels of bedded oysters from\r\n    Virginia, worth perhaps $5,000 when sold, form the total active\r\n    business. The oyster fleet, however, remains, though greatly\r\n    diminished, and carrying its cargoes to Boston, Portland and\r\n    elsewhere, instead of bringing them to be laid down in the home\r\n    harbor. It will be long before Wellfleet, and its neighbor,\r\n    Provincetown, lose the prestige of old custom as oyster\r\n    carriers.\r\n\r\n(3) _Oyster Raising._--In 1876 the first attempt to raise oysters from\r\n\"seed\" at Wellfleet, is said to have been made by E. P. Cook, who\r\nobtained a grant from the town of about 30 acres, on which were planted\r\n500 bushels of \"seed\" from Somerset, Mass. The \"Oysterman\" of Dec. 20,\r\n1906, gives the following account of oyster planting at Wellfleet:--\r\n\r\n    In 1876 our informant, Mr. E. P. Cook, conceived the idea that\r\n    these waters could grow \"seed\" oysters as well as fatten big\r\n    stock. He went to Somerset, Mass., and got a carload of 500\r\n    bushels and planted them. A few had previously been planted\r\n    but with ill success. The people laughed at him for dumping\r\n    his good money overboard. He was the first man to lease a\r\n    piece of oyster ground from the State, and of course had his\r\n    pick, which was 600 feet on the shore next to the Silver\r\n    Spring, the original spot of the natural rocks. Mr. Cook here\r\n    showed his acumen as a culturist. The next spring they had\r\n    made a remarkable growth, and all had lived. Then there was\r\n    a stampede of the fellows who laughed, to get some ground,\r\n    too. Soon every inch of available ground had been taken up.\r\n    We mention the following who took up plats: Solomon Higgins,\r\n    I. C. Young, Benjamin Oliver, Daniel Oliver, Edward Oliver,\r\n    Cornelius Rogers, William Smith, S. B. Rich, Theodore Brown,\r\n    Stephen Young. These men did not all plant. The next year Mr.\r\n    Cook bought 500 bushels more, and now he had 1,000 bushels on\r\n    his grounds. These were two-year-old plants, and when they\r\n    had laid there three years he sold these primitive beauties\r\n    for $5 per barrel. Some time after this he bought Mr. Rich's\r\n    plot. Subsequently Mr. Cook sold 400 of his 600 feet to R. R.\r\n    Higgins, the founder of the famous oyster-packing house by that\r\n    name. This same man bought the 200 feet of Solomon Higgins. Now\r\n    this house had 600 feet of shore ground. R. R. Higgins was the\r\n    first wholesaler with capital invested in the culture of the\r\n    Cape Cod oysters. Finally, this house absorbed all the ground\r\n    Cook had. Eight years after this the Wright & Willis firm came\r\n    on the scene; that period had elapsed since the first cargo\r\n    of \"seed\" had been freighted here. They bought the remainder\r\n    of the Solomon Higgins grant. Then Mr. Cook took out another\r\n    grant below Smalley's Bar. Capt. Albert Harding and Capt. D.\r\n    A. Newcomb took out leases. In 1892 Mr. Cook sold his lease to\r\n    the D. Atwood Company. Then Mr. Cook bought the Capt. Albert\r\n    Harding lease and sold the right to plant on it, the law then\r\n    not allowing the lessee to turn over the grant in toto. Then\r\n    H. & R. Atwood became interested here. About this time some\r\n    friction between the planters and clammers existed, but it\r\n    should be remembered that the planters occupied only about\r\n    200 of the 2,400 acres involved in this dispute. Then it was\r\n    that J. A. Stubbs came on the stage of activity, and Mr. Cook\r\n    secured a lease for this wholesale concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eastham._\r\n\r\nThe oyster industry of Eastham is closely associated with the Wellfleet\r\nindustry, and practically all the business is carried on by Wellfleet\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\nThe grants extend along the western shore from the Eastham-Wellfleet\r\nline south, running out into the bay a distance of 1 mile. The average\r\nwidth of these grants is 900 feet. Twenty-four grants have been given\r\nout by the selectmen, but only 12 of these are in existence at the\r\npresent time, the others having lapsed for non-payment of dues. (The\r\ntown charges $3 for the original grant, and $1 each year thereafter).\r\nThe area of the grants is 800 acres, of which only 125 acres are under\r\ncultivation. As all the business, which is but small, is done by\r\nWellfleet firms, the statistics of the industry are included in the\r\nWellfleet report. All the grants, as at Wellfleet, expire in 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orleans._\r\n\r\nThere are 5 grants on the west coast of the town, but practically\r\nnothing is done in the oyster business. The oyster industry of Orleans\r\nis a dead issue, and quahaugers dig at will over all the granted\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe grants are all eight to nine years old, and will not be renewed,\r\nas they are said to be unconstitutional, since the waters of Eastham\r\nand Orleans are common, and the consent of Eastham was not obtained\r\nwhen they were granted. The real reason for not renewing them will be\r\nbecause they are not profitable. The sand shifts on a good deal of the\r\nterritory, and where the water is too deep for shifting, oyster culture\r\ndoes not seem to pay.\r\n\r\nFour years ago 15,000 bushels of two-year-old \"seed\" was sent here from\r\nConnecticut. The greater part of this \"seed\" died in transportation,\r\nand much of the remainder was killed by the shifting sand. Two years\r\nago (1905) 3,000 bushels of marketable oysters were shipped from\r\nOrleans; but little has been done since then. No set has ever been\r\ncaught here, although spat catches readily on the rocks which lie\r\nbetween the tide lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chatham._\r\n\r\nThe oyster furnishes an important industry for the town of Chatham,\r\nwhich ranks next to Wellfleet and Cotuit in the production of \"Cape\"\r\noysters.\r\n\r\nThe oyster grants are all situated in Oyster Pond and Oyster Pond\r\nRiver, covering an area of 65 acres of excellent bottom. Of this, 55\r\nacres is hard bottom; 6 acres, soft mud; and 4 acres of coarse shifting\r\nsand. The whole of Oyster Pond River and the most of the shore waters\r\nof Oyster Pond are taken up by grants. The central part of Oyster Pond\r\npossesses a soft bottom, and is therefore unsuited for oyster culture.\r\nThe depth of water over the grants varies from dry to 6 feet at low\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nRecords show that a natural oyster bed once existed in Oyster Pond, as\r\nin 1802 \"excellent oysters, but scarce,\" were reported. Even now old\r\nshell heaps are found, which contain extremely large oyster shells,\r\nand indicate that the Indians used these oysters for food. Indeed,\r\nthe name, Oyster Pond, was given long before grants were issued, and\r\ndoubtless received this name because of these natural oysters.\r\n\r\nNo natural oysters remained in 1877, when the first grants were issued\r\nto George S. Atwood, John Vanhise, Jonathan Small, Stephen Gould and\r\nFrank Lanpier. The last three named held together one grant in Oyster\r\nPond River; Atwood's grant was in Oyster Pond; while Vanhise's grant\r\nwas partly in Oyster Pond and partly in Stage harbor, where oyster\r\nculture was a failure. The planting was not very successful at first,\r\nowing to a lack of proper methods.\r\n\r\nThese grants were issued in 1874 for a term of twenty years. The next\r\nseries of grants were issued for ten years, and in 1893 the first\r\ngrants were renewed for the same length of time. Since the period of\r\nthe twenty-year grants there have been two ten-year leases, and the\r\npresent leases will expire in 1911.\r\n\r\nA town regulation restricts the oyster grants to the southern waters of\r\nthe town, and allows no grants to be given in the waters of Pleasant\r\nBay, where there is considerable territory which might be suitable\r\nfor oyster raising. As all the available territory is now taken up in\r\nOyster Pond, no more grants can be issued.\r\n\r\nThe method of obtaining a grant by a resident of the town is to choose\r\nthe locality, stake out the grant and report the same to the selectmen,\r\nwho will grant a license if the bounds are satisfactorily described,\r\nand no part of another grant is included. The price of the license,\r\nwhich runs for a period of ten years, is $2, and 50 cents is charged\r\nfor recording it. No regular survey of the grant is made. Taxes are\r\npaid yearly on stock and working capital.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                           $26,533\r\n  Power boats,                                      1\r\n  Value of power boats,                          $300\r\n  Sail boats,                                       2\r\n  Value of sail boats,                           $500\r\n  Dories and skiffs,                                8\r\n  Value of dories and skiffs,                    $105\r\n  Scows,                                           12\r\n  Value of scows,                                $790\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                     10\r\n      Tongs,                                       34\r\n  Value of implements,                           $313\r\n  Value of shore property,                     $1,225\r\n  Value of oysters on grant,                  $23,300\r\n\r\nOwing to the shallow water, most of the work is done by tonging. Flat\r\nscows, 25 by 10 feet, are generally used for this work, as they afford\r\nexcellent footing for the oysterman in tonging and plenty of room for\r\nthe oysters. These scows, which have a capacity of 100 bushels, can be\r\nanchored by stakes or iron piping, and definite areas covered by the\r\ntonger. In the fall the oystermen make their \"culls\" on these scows.\r\nChatham is the only town in Massachusetts where scows are in general\r\nuse. Dredging is done only to a limited extent by 3 oystermen, the\r\nothers all using tongs. Twenty men are engaged from four to six months\r\nof the year in the oyster business at Chatham.\r\n\r\nThe production for 1906-07 was 14,550 bushels, valued at $23,987. The\r\noyster industry has been increasing every year, the production for\r\n1906-07 being one-third more than the 1905-06 output. The oystermen are\r\nunanimous in saying that the oyster business of Chatham is steadily\r\nimproving.\r\n\r\nNo \"seed\" oysters are raised in Chatham, as no large set has ever been\r\ncaught, and all attempts in this line have proved unsuccessful. All\r\nthe \"seed\" oysters are brought from Greenport, L. I. These run from\r\ntwo to four years old, the larger oysters being preferred. As a rule,\r\noystermen are forced to take what they can get when they buy seed.\r\n\r\nThe only natural enemy which infests the Chatham oyster is the oyster\r\ndrill (_Urosalpinx cinerea_). The damage done by this pest is slight,\r\namounting to nearly $800 annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harwich._\r\n\r\nNo oyster industry is now carried on in the town of Harwich. A\r\nnatural oyster bed once existed in Herring River, and occasionally\r\na few oysters can be picked up at the present time; but the bed\r\nis practically fished out. This bed once extended a distance of\r\nthree-quarters of a mile in the lower part of the river.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 an act was passed to prevent \"the wilful destruction of oysters\r\nand other shellfish in the town of Harwich,\" which shows that even as\r\nearly as 1824 the natural bed in Herring River was on the verge of\r\ndepletion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dennis and Yarmouth._\r\n\r\nThe oyster industries of Dennis and Yarmouth are so connected that they\r\nwill have to be considered as belonging to one town.\r\n\r\nFour grants have been leased in the two towns, but only 2 of these are\r\nworked. Three grants are situated in Bass River, while the fourth,\r\nwhich is not operated, owing to the shifting sand, lies outside Dog\r\nFish Bar. The 2 grants which are worked are situated in Bass River, and\r\ncomprise an area of 10 acres of hard bottom, all of which is suitable\r\nfor oyster culture. The Bass River grants, which are taxed at the\r\nvaluation of $1,000 apiece, expire in 1914.\r\n\r\nMill Creek, in West Yarmouth, one of the most valuable shellfish areas\r\nin the town, originally contained a natural oyster bed which extended\r\nfrom the mouth of the creek up for 1,000 feet, comprising an area of\r\n2-1/3 acres. Nevertheless, this was granted in 1895 for a period of ten\r\nyears. Two years ago the lease expired, and it is said that the oysters\r\nhave come in again in abundance.\r\n\r\nAll along the south shore of the two towns \"seed\" oysters, which have\r\nbeen washed out of Mill Creek, can be picked up. A small amount of\r\n\"seed\" is raised on the grants, but this is not enough to furnish the\r\nrequisite amount required for planting purposes, so about 2,500 bushels\r\nis annually brought into the town from Oyster Bay, L. I.\r\n\r\nNo damage is done in these waters by the natural enemies of the oyster,\r\nas both the starfish and oyster drill are very scarce.\r\n\r\nOne thousand bushels of marketable oysters, valued at $1,500, were\r\nshipped in the season of 1906-07.\r\n\r\nThree men are engaged for a period of seven and one-half months in the\r\noyster industry.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                            $5,175\r\n  Dories,                                           2\r\n  Value of dories,                                $25\r\n  Tongs,                                            5\r\n  Value of implements,                            $50\r\n  Value of shore property,                       $100\r\n  Value of bedded oysters,                     $5,000\r\n\r\nThe oysters are taken by tonging from dories, as the water is\r\ncomparatively shallow. No dredging is done.\r\n\r\nYarmouth is the only town in the State which requires a license for\r\ntaking oysters from a natural bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barnstable._\r\n\r\nBarnstable is the great oyster town of the Commonwealth, as it has\r\nthe twofold distinction of possessing the most extensive industry\r\nand producing the finest quality of oysters. The causes which have\r\nbrought the cultivation of oysters in this town to so flourishing a\r\ncondition have been fourfold: first, Barnstable has a long coast line,\r\nmuch cut up by bays and rivers, which give it a very large available\r\narea; secondly, this area is remarkably suited for the cultivation\r\nof oysters, as it is for the most part hard, clean bottom, in\r\ncomparatively shallow water and well sheltered from storms; thirdly,\r\nthere is little damage from the enemies of the oyster,--the starfish,\r\nwinkle and drill, fourthly, the waters of the township are notably\r\npure, free from contamination, and well adapted for the production of a\r\nrapid-growing oyster of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nBarnstable township contains several villages, three of which, Cotuit,\r\nMarston's Mills and Osterville, are prosperous centers of the oyster\r\nfishery. Hyannis, a fourth village, once maintained a business of this\r\nnature, which proved unprofitable and has now practically disappeared.\r\nOyster grants are scattered along the shores of Popponesset River and\r\nBay, in Cotuit harbor, Bluff Channel, South Bay, Osterville Narrows\r\nand at Marston's Mills. In addition, a large but indefinite territory\r\nalong the southern shore, as indicated on the map, is maintained as\r\nexperimental grants.\r\n\r\nCotuit is by far the most important center of the industry. Here the\r\nfishery is conducted on an extensive scale. The white, clean sandy\r\nbottom and the remarkably pure waters of the bay produce an oyster\r\nwith a bright, clear shell, which distinguishes it from oysters\r\ngrown elsewhere. This Cotuit oyster is much sought for by hotels and\r\nfancy dealers, and is universally considered par excellence among\r\nMassachusetts oysters.\r\n\r\nBarnstable, though supporting an immense industry, has by no means\r\nexhausted her latent resources. Extensive experiments to increase the\r\nproductive area of the town have been carried on for the past few\r\nyears. A strip of territory along the southern coast, some 4 miles\r\nlong and 3 miles wide, has been granted. This territory is of doubtful\r\nutility, as the bottom is largely shifting sand exposed to the full\r\nforce of southerly gales. These grants have hardly been in force long\r\nenough to demonstrate their possibilities, but it is probable that a\r\nlarge territory may be thoroughly suitable for the future expansion of\r\nthe oyster industry.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, several oystermen did not make statistical returns,\r\nthus rendering a complete record for the Barnstable oyster industry\r\nimpossible. The majority of the oystermen willingly responded, and the\r\npresent report comprises only those returns which have been sent in.\r\n\r\nThe total area comprised by the grants, 29 in number, is 188 acres, of\r\nwhich 121 acres are of hard bottom, suitable for oyster culture. There\r\nis very little shifting bottom. The usual Cotuit bottom is a clear\r\nsand, which is especially favorable for the production of fine oysters.\r\n\r\nThirty-three men are employed from six to eight months each year in\r\nthe industry, which gave in 1906-07 a production of 25,850 bushels\r\nof marketable oysters, valued at $48,050. Except for a small natural\r\noyster bed at Centerville, no \"seed\" is caught in Barnstable, and is\r\nall brought from Long Island and Connecticut. Several firms plant\r\nonly large oysters, bedding them in the spring and taking them up the\r\nfollowing fall, when they have acquired the Cotuit flavor.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                           $39,558\r\n  Power boats,                                      4\r\n  Value of power boats,                        $3,900\r\n  Sail boats,                                       3\r\n  Value of sail boats,                           $800\r\n  Dories,                                          22\r\n  Value of dories,                               $413\r\n  Scows,                                            7\r\n  Value of scows,                                $156\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                     23\r\n      Tongs,                                       45\r\n  Value of implements,                         $1,139\r\n  Value of shore property,                     $4,300\r\n  Value of oysters on grant,                  $28,850\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mashpee._\r\n\r\nThe oyster industry of Mashpee is rather limited. Five grants exist in\r\nthe west channel of Popponesset River, covering practically all the\r\nterritory. Only about 5 to 10 acres of this territory is suitable for\r\noyster culture. The ground granted for oysters is used indiscriminately\r\nfor quahauging and scalloping, and seems to be almost public property.\r\n\r\nBut one man is engaged in the oyster business, and he rarely ships\r\nany, but peddles them around the community. No \"seed\" is caught.\r\nStarfish and oyster drills are very scarce. A cat boat, dory and tongs\r\nconstitute the capital invested, which is valued at $200. The annual\r\nproduction is valued at $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Falmouth._\r\n\r\nThe oyster industry of Falmouth is conducted on the south side of\r\nthe town, in the waters of Waquoit Bay. There are no oysters on the\r\nBuzzards Bay side of the town.\r\n\r\nAccording to the town records, there are 22 grants in existence. These\r\ngrants are mostly small, not averaging more than 2 to 10 acres, and are\r\nbut little cultivated. Returns from 6 of these grants, which comprise\r\nall the territory worked for market, are alone used for the statistical\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nThe best oyster territory is in Waquoit Bay and Child's River. In\r\nWaquoit Bay 6 acres are granted, 4½ acres of which is hard bottom,\r\nsuitable for oyster culture. In Child's River the grants comprise 20\r\nacres, two-thirds of which, or 13 acres, is hard bottom. Altogether,\r\nsome 44 acres are granted, and, although a good deal of the surface is\r\nmuddy, there are 23 acres of very fair oyster ground.\r\n\r\nNo business is made of raising \"seed,\" but from two to three year old\r\n\"seed\" is shipped from Greenport, L. I., and replanted.\r\n\r\nIn 1906-07, 3,012 bushels of marketable oysters, valued at $6,025, were\r\nshipped. Many of the grants are leased to men who raise oysters for\r\ntheir own use only, while but few make a business of shipping oysters.\r\n\r\nThe only enemy is the oyster drill, which does but slight damage here.\r\n\r\nThree men are engaged for nine months each year in the oyster industry\r\nat Falmouth; while 5 or more run grants for their own use.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                            $3,080\r\n  Power boats,                                      1\r\n  Value of power boats,                          $800\r\n  Sail boats,                                       1\r\n  Value of sail boats,                           $250\r\n  Dories,                                           4\r\n  Value of dories,                                $75\r\n  Scows,                                            1\r\n  Value of scows,                                $400\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                      2\r\n      Tongs,                                        6\r\n  Value of implements,                           $105\r\n  Value of shore property,                     $1,000\r\n  Value of bedded oysters,                       $450\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buzzards Bay District._\r\n\r\nThe Buzzards Bay oyster industry is in a state verging on chaos. In\r\nsome specially favored localities it is in a flourishing condition;\r\nin others hardly less favorable it is almost completely stagnant.\r\nGreat natural advantages exist, which if properly utilized would\r\ncreate a business of immense proportions. These resources are for\r\nthe most part but poorly improved, and in many cases are neglected\r\naltogether. A spirit of uncertainty, which discourages confidence and\r\nchecks initiative, seems to pervade the business atmosphere. Amid this\r\nuncertainty and conflicting forces, one fact, at once the starting\r\npoint of the whole difficulty and at the same time the sole solution\r\nof the problem, stands out vividly clear. This is the need of proper\r\n_legislation_.\r\n\r\nThe troubles which beset the Buzzards Bay oyster industry are directly\r\ntraceable to defects in the present legislative system. These defects\r\nare both active and passive. In some cases unwise and illogical laws\r\nare in operation, which hamper business activity; in other cases laws\r\nfor which there is a crying need are laid aside or neglected. A reform\r\nin certain aspects of town supervision is the demand of the hour. Until\r\nthe present system receives an overhauling, it is doubtful if the\r\nindustry will ever experience full prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain a clear insight into the difficulties which darken the\r\nimmediate outlook in this region, it will be necessary to take a brief\r\nsurvey of the history and present status of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the oyster fishery in Buzzards Bay arose from the\r\nexploitation and subsequent depletion of the natural beds. These beds,\r\nof which there are several scattered along the coast from Bourne to\r\nMattapoisett, furnished for a long time a large annual output of\r\noysters. In the early '70's the supply began to decrease rapidly, and\r\nthe fear of total extermination caused the selectmen of Marion, Wareham\r\nand Sandwich (Bourne) to attempt a strict supervision of the fishery.\r\nThese attempts were in all cases unsatisfactory, and about 1875 the\r\nartificial culture of oysters began almost simultaneously in the three\r\ntowns by the issue of licenses or grants to private individuals. The\r\nmeasure was popular from the first. Almost all the available land\r\nwas speedily appropriated, and a flourishing but exotic industry,\r\nstimulated by a considerable outlay of capital, burst into life.\r\n\r\nAt Marion the new business lasted precisely fifteen years. The industry\r\nwas largely a losing venture. The oysters did not grow well, and were\r\nof inferior quality. In time, doubtless, when the causes which produced\r\nthese effects had been studied, a stable and well-ordered industry\r\nwould have resulted. It is but natural to assume that where oysters\r\ngrew in a \"wild\" state, cultivated ones could likewise be grown. Such\r\nan outcome, however, was not destined to follow. The grants had been so\r\ngiven that they all expired at the same time. When this date arrived,\r\nthe majority of the inhabitants of Marion were of the opinion that\r\nthe oyster grants would yield far better returns if utilized merely\r\nfor the quahaugs which grew naturally on them, and the whole harbor\r\nwas consequently thrown open as common ground. From that date the\r\nquahaug fishery has waned almost to the point of extinction, but no\r\nefforts have been made to resurrect the old oyster industry, which has\r\npractically disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt Bourne the industry began with bright prospects. The present\r\nbusiness, though somewhat impoverished, still possesses those inherent\r\nresources which are capable of developing a more extensive industry.\r\n\r\nAt Wareham the business was of slower growth and more logical\r\ndevelopment, and it has continued to increase, until at present the\r\ntown possesses an important industry. It has struggled with many\r\nproblems which have retarded its growth, and which still embarrass it.\r\nThese are primarily problems of legislation, as the industry stands in\r\nneed of better regulations before it can attain its maximum development.\r\n\r\nIn all these difficulties, which have been briefly outlined and hinted\r\nat, the main source of annoyance has been the strife between two rival\r\nfactions,--the oyster and quahaug interests. These interests have ever\r\nbeen at war, and the result has been almost fatally destructive to\r\nboth. The questions at stake in this controversy have been broad in\r\ntheir general interest. The quahaug industry is essentially democratic,\r\nrepresenting roughly labor as against capital, and demands that tidal\r\nflats and waters be kept as common property for general use. The oyster\r\nindustry, on the other hand, is essentially exclusive, representing\r\norganized capital, and maintains that oyster grants are as much the\r\nsubject of private ownership as farms and city lots. The whole aim of\r\nlegislation has been to reconcile these wholly opposite theories. The\r\nproblem has been complex and many-sided, and it is not strange that the\r\nselectmen of the towns in question have been unable to harmonize the\r\ntwo factions or pass regulations suitable to both parties. Certain it\r\nis that in trying to benefit both they have benefited neither, and the\r\npresent confusion has resulted.\r\n\r\nThe matter is one certainly of sufficient importance to merit attention\r\nfrom the State. It is not merely local. The whole Commonwealth is\r\ninterested vitally in the development of its industries, and it is\r\nunwise to allow so important an industry as the oyster fishery to\r\nremain solely in the hands of local authority, especially when local\r\nauthority has shown itself unable to cope with the problem.\r\n\r\nThe present system in vogue in the Buzzards Bay district is perhaps\r\nunfair to both parties in its policy. The selectmen may lease an\r\nunlimited number of grants, of an unlimited area, to any citizen or\r\nnumber of citizens of the town in question. Theoretically at least\r\nthey may grant all the available area in sight to one man. There must\r\nof course be the formality of a hearing, and sufficient pressure may\r\nbe and is frequently brought to bear upon the selectmen to retard them\r\nfrom exercising the full extent of their authority; but nevertheless\r\nthe system is unjust to the majority, and it is small wonder that the\r\nquahaug fishermen feel aggrieved that some of their former privileges\r\nare thus curtailed. Furthermore, the clause which demands that these\r\ngrants should be used for the cultivation of oysters is oftentimes\r\nopenly evaded, and a good portion of the granted area, though not used\r\nfor oysters, is closed to the quahaugers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the oystermen, while apparently enjoying great\r\nprivileges, in reality are severely handicapped. An oysterman obtains\r\na grant perhaps with great difficulty, owing to opposition from\r\nthe quahaug men. He can carry on no extensive business without the\r\nexpenditure of considerable capital. If he \"seeds\" his grant, the first\r\ntwo or three years are spent in the maturing of the first harvest.\r\nThe grant is given only for ten years; consequently, when it has run\r\nfor seven or eight years the owner is in doubt whether to plant any\r\nmore \"seed,\" as he does not know that his license will be renewed and\r\nnaturally does not wish to plant a bed for his unknown successor.\r\nAgain, if he is fairly successful and wishes to expand his business,\r\nhe cannot without great risk invest in the costly equipment necessary\r\nfor such an enterprise, as he has no certainty of getting a sufficient\r\namount of territory or of keeping it any length of time. Furthermore,\r\nadditional complications arise from the disputes with owners of\r\nadjoining shore property. This is particularly unfortunate, as this\r\ntidal area along the shore is most valuable for the collection of\r\noyster set or \"seed.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statements it appears that the oyster and quahaug\r\nfactions are in the position of two combatants who continue to fight,\r\nwhile the object of the strife is lost to both. It is impossible to\r\nhandle so grave a problem by merely theorizing, but a few ideas might\r\nbe suggested as bearing favorably on the subject. It would seem wise\r\nto refrain as far as possible from granting the best portions of\r\nquahaug territory, for there is sufficient room for both industries to\r\nflourish. Then, too, grants might be rented at so much per acre as long\r\nas the owner desired within certain time limits, assuming that he paid\r\nhis annual rental and improved his grant. These and other suggestions\r\nmight be made which would seem an improvement over the present\r\ncircumstances; but it is doubtful if conditions can be much bettered\r\nuntil some motive force and centralized authority is supplied by proper\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bourne._\r\n\r\nBourne has long supported a promising oyster industry. In some respects\r\nit has greater advantages for the extension of this business than\r\nWareham, but the invested capital, the annual product and the resulting\r\nrevenue are all overshadowed by those of its neighboring rival. The\r\ngreat natural resources which Bourne possesses, its extensive available\r\narea, its multiplicity of bays, inlets, islands and rivers,--these and\r\na variety of other causes combine to make it a most favorable locality\r\nfor the growth of oysters; and it is indeed an unfortunate circumstance\r\nboth for the shellfish interests of the community and the broader\r\ninterests of the State that so great a source of economic wealth should\r\nbe so little improved. The vexing questions which harass the oyster\r\nplanters of Wareham and hamper their efforts are present here in even\r\ngreater force. In many places where a flourishing business was once\r\ncarried on the industry is at a standstill, while nowhere does it\r\nevince that life and activity which its decided advantages warrant.\r\n\r\nThe town books contain records of 135 grants in force to-day. No\r\naccurate system of charting is in vogue except in the Monument River,\r\nand no absolutely reliable data concerning the total area is available,\r\nbut the combined territory comprised in these grants aggregates nearly\r\n600 acres. Of this territory, however, only a portion, and a relatively\r\nsmall portion, is really improved; the remainder is either allowed to\r\nlie dormant or is worked merely for the quahaugs which it produces. The\r\noyster territory of Bourne is divided into five distinct sections: the\r\nMonument River section, the region about Mashnee Island, Toby Island\r\nand vicinity, Basset's Island and the neighborhood of Wing's Neck, and\r\nPocasset and the Red Brook harbor or Cataumet district. Of these five\r\nregions, the Monument River ranks first, both in the total area and\r\nalso in importance, and it is here that most of the business is carried\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe statistical returns of the Bourne oystermen show that only 42\r\ngrants comprising 100 acres are worked. Of this 83 acres is hard bottom\r\nsuitable for oyster raising while the remaining 17 acres is mostly soft\r\nmud.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                           $24,448\r\n  Power boats,                                      3\r\n  Value of power boats,                        $3,000\r\n  Sail boats,                                       8\r\n  Value of sail boats,                         $1,900\r\n  Dories and skiffs,                               29\r\n  Value of dories and skiffs,                    $615\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                     99\r\n      Tongs,                                       38\r\n  Value of implements,                           $483\r\n  Value of shore property,                       $150\r\n  Value of bedded oysters,                    $18,300\r\n\r\nTwenty-one men make a living from the industry. The production for\r\nthe year ending Aug. 1, 1907, amounted to 2,100 bushels of marketable\r\noysters, valued at $4,100, and 23,000 bushels of \"seed,\" worth $15,000.\r\nThe methods employed in oyster culture here are similar to those in use\r\nat Wareham. Thousands of bushels of shells, preferably those of the\r\nscallop, are strewn over the bottom to collect the set, which is then\r\ntaken up and transferred to the proper grant or shipped for sale. The\r\ntwo great enemies of the oyster, the borer or drill, and the starfish,\r\nflourish here. The borer seems more destructive in those sections which\r\nare comparatively sheltered, the starfish in more exposed localities.\r\n\r\nThe history of the industry is one of picturesque variety. The\r\nbeginnings of the industry were bright with promise; the sudden growth\r\nwhich followed was spectacular but erratic; and the difficulties\r\nwhich soon arose plunged it into complications from which it emerged\r\nmuch shattered and greatly declined. Originally there were three good\r\nnatural beds,--in Monument River, Barlow's River and Red Brook harbor,\r\nrespectively. These beds long supplied all the oysters produced,\r\nand when in 1834 they began to be depleted, legislation was enacted\r\nregulating them until 1863, when the town surveyed a number of grants\r\nin the Monument River, each with an average area of 1½ to 10 acres,\r\nand allowed one of these grants to every citizen desiring it, on the\r\npayment of $2.50. These old beds still linger as rather uncertain\r\nassets of the communal wealth. The Monument River grounds still supply\r\na fairly large harvest, the Barlow River has declined much more, while\r\nthe Cataumet beds are nearly extinct.\r\n\r\nThe shellfish laws of this region are of vital importance, as it is\r\ntheir province to inaugurate order from chaos, put a stop to wasteful\r\nmethods, and take such steps as appear necessary for the proper\r\ndevelopment of the industry. How greatly these laws fail in their\r\nmission is abundantly shown by the present conditions of the fishery.\r\nThe whole situation is on the threshold of a change. What this change\r\nwill be, whether for better or worse, depends upon the legislation of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wareham._\r\n\r\nWareham is the second town in the State in the production of oysters,\r\nbeing excelled in this respect by Barnstable alone. Its commanding\r\nposition at the head of Buzzards Bay, the numerous indentations of\r\nits coast line, and the three rivers which lie partially within its\r\nborders, give it a wide expanse of available territory exceptionally\r\nfavorable for the development of this shellfish industry.\r\n\r\nThe substantial success which has attended the oyster business at\r\nWareham has been attained by slow but steady growth. Many problems have\r\nbeen encountered,--problems of local prejudice, opposition from rival\r\nindustries and the like; but these problems have simply hampered the\r\nindustry,--they have not sufficed to check its growth. At present the\r\nbusiness seems firmly established, and can enter on its future career\r\nof prosperity as soon as the barriers which block its progress shall\r\nhave been removed.\r\n\r\nThe town records show a total of 125 grants in operation to-day. These\r\ngrants are poorly described and for the most part unsurveyed, but their\r\ntotal area approximates 1,000 acres. According to the statistical\r\nreturns of the oystermen, 70 grants, comprising 196 acres, are under\r\ncultivation. Of this, 159 acres are of hard bottom, suitable for oyster\r\nplanting, while the waste area is equally soft mud and shifting sand.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                           $40,620\r\n  Power boats,                                      4\r\n  Value of power boats,                        $3,800\r\n  Sail boats,                                      17\r\n  Value of sail boats,                         $4,485\r\n  Dories and skiffs,                               50\r\n  Value of dories and skiffs,                    $820\r\n  Scows,                                            2\r\n  Value of scows,                                $250\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                    120\r\n      Tongs,                                       84\r\n  Value of implements,                         $1,120\r\n  Value of shore property,                     $2,420\r\n  Value of bedded oysters,                    $27,725\r\n\r\nThe catching of oyster \"seed\" at Wareham is more important than the\r\nraising of marketable oysters; 22,100 bushels of seed, valued at\r\n$12,090, were exported last year (1906-07). Thousands of bushels\r\nof shells, chiefly those of the scallop, are planted yearly in\r\nshallow water, to catch the set. The territory where these shells\r\nmay be planted to the best advantage is on the fringe of tidal flats\r\nwhich skirt the coast. This area, however, which is consequently of\r\nconsiderable value, is of doubtful ownership, being claimed both by\r\nthe oystermen and also by the owners of the adjacent shore property.\r\nThe dispute arising over this question has been most harmful to the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe marketable oysters raised at Wareham are of very good quality.\r\nThere were 7,770 bushels of these oysters, valued at $12,790, produced\r\nin 1906-07, and shipped mostly to New York and Boston. Altogether,\r\nthere are 26 men depending on this industry for a living.\r\n\r\nBesides the grants, there are two native beds, one each in the Wareham\r\nand the Weweantit rivers. These beds comprise nearly 80 acres, and,\r\nthough now greatly reduced, they still yield a considerable amount of\r\nseed oysters.\r\n\r\nThe laws governing the industry here are similar to those at Bourne.\r\nThe ten-year grant prevails, with all its attendant evils to the\r\noysterman; while the quahaugers have abundant cause to complain, from\r\nthe fact that practically all the available territory has been granted\r\nto the oystermen. While it is true that scarcely a third of this land\r\nis utilized for the cultivation of oysters, it is likewise true that\r\nthe rights of the oystermen are by no means strictly observed by\r\nthe quahauger. There can be but one result of this policy,--endless\r\nwrangling and confusion, and, in the end, loss to both parties.\r\nThe unfortunate thing about the whole matter is that most of this\r\nwastefulness is entirely needless; but this is a problem for future\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marion._\r\n\r\nThe oyster industry at Marion is practically dead. The last grants\r\nexpired some ten or twelve years ago, and were never renewed. Of the\r\ntwo original natural beds, that in Blankinship's Cove is now almost\r\nentirely depleted, while the larger and more important bed in the\r\nWeweantit River has greatly declined in importance. This bed, however,\r\nstill supplies all the marketable oysters produced within the town,\r\nthough the annual production is insignificant. From twenty-five to\r\nthirty years ago the oyster industry had its beginning, and for a time\r\nflourished. Almost all the available territory, both in the harbor and\r\nin the Weweantit River, was granted. The older grants were leased for\r\nfifteen years, and those of later date were arranged to run out at the\r\nsame time; so it followed that all the leases expired simultaneously,\r\nand the industry came to an abrupt end. These old grants were not\r\nrenewed, for two reasons: first, they had not paid very well; and,\r\nsecondly, the growing quahaug industry promised more lucrative returns.\r\nThe scallops, too, began to be abundant, and the old oyster business\r\ngave way before its newer and more prosperous competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fall River District._\r\n\r\nThe Fall River district, comprising the six towns of Fall River,\r\nFreetown, Berkley, Dighton, Somerset and Swansea, may best be treated\r\nas a geographical unit. The oyster industries of the individual\r\ncommunities overlap to a considerable extent, and make distinct\r\nseparation difficult, while, as the same methods of culture everywhere\r\nobtain and the same problems and difficulties are encountered, a brief\r\nsurvey of this whole region may be comprehensively discussed in one\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful shores of Mount Hope Bay and its tributary streams, the\r\nCole, Lee and Taunton rivers, furnish an extensive territory for a\r\nlarge oyster industry. The best of this area is now included within the\r\nconfines of the bay itself, though the Cole and Lee rivers furnish a\r\nsmall but valuable addition. The Taunton River, however, which thirty\r\nyears ago produced the finest oysters in the State, and was the main\r\nsource of supply for this district, has become utterly worthless\r\nfor the growth of marketable oysters. In fact, this river, with its\r\ncurious history, and the difficulties which it now presents to the\r\ncarrying on of an important and profitable industry, furnishes the\r\nmost interesting problem of this whole region. This river embraces the\r\nentire oyster territory of Freetown, Berkley and Dighton and portions\r\nof Somerset and Fall River,--certainly half of all the available\r\nterritory of the whole section; and yet it is an indisputable fact that\r\nthis large and formerly profitable area is now altogether unsuitable\r\nfor the production of edible shellfish.\r\n\r\nThe causes for this transformation of a river which once supplied a\r\nlarge annual revenue to the prosperous communities which lined its\r\nbanks, into a stream unwholesome and unfit for the proper maturing of\r\nits shellfish, have been much discussed. The prevailing opinion seems\r\nto lay the blame to the impurities discharged into the river by the\r\nTaunton factories. Other theories, ingenious but far less worthy of\r\nweight, have been urged; but the burden of evidence strongly points to\r\nthe sewage of the city of Taunton as the probable main factor in the\r\ndecline of the industry.\r\n\r\nWhile greatly impaired as a favorable territory for the propagation\r\nof oysters, the river, however, is still largely utilized. Extensive\r\ngrants are sold by the towns of Dighton, Berkley and Freetown to\r\noystermen, who bed them with \"seed,\" which is allowed to remain until\r\nit is from two to three years old, when it is taken up and replanted in\r\nsome other locality where the waters are uncontaminated, and here left\r\nfor a certain time until it becomes \"purified\" and ready for shipment\r\nto market. By this method the old grants are still worked, though\r\ngreatly declined in value, as oysters can no longer be sold to market\r\ndirect, and the process of transplanting entails considerable expense.\r\n\r\nIn the other towns of this region the industry is carried on much the\r\nsame as in Buzzards Bay or Barnstable. A great deal of attention is\r\npaid to the enemies of the oyster, particularly the starfish. This\r\nanimal is combated chiefly with \"mops\" of cotton waste which are\r\ndragged over the bottom, and the starfish, becoming entangled in the\r\nstrands, are removed and destroyed. As this fairly effectual warfare is\r\nbeing constantly waged, the numbers of this pest are kept well reduced,\r\nand the grounds maintained in very good condition.\r\n\r\nBy a peculiar local custom, which would be decidedly unpopular in some\r\ncoast communities, the towns of this section usually sell their entire\r\noyster privilege to some individual or company, ordinarily the highest\r\nbidder. In this manner, aided by the fact that some persons purchasing\r\nsuch rights re-sell them to others, the oyster industry of this entire\r\nregion is owned and controlled by a very few men. This arrangement,\r\nhowever, does not seem to be unpopular, the only difficulty arising\r\nfrom those clammers who are accustomed to dig clams under water, and\r\nsometimes find a bed located on an oysterman's grant. In such cases\r\nthe owners usually waive their rights, and allow the clammers to dig\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, the oyster industry in this district, while it has\r\nby no means attained its maximum development, has indeed reached very\r\nconsiderable proportions. The entire amount of area granted aggregates\r\n810 acres. Of this total, some 510 acres are suitable for oyster\r\nculture, the remainder being soft mud, shifting sand, or otherwise\r\nunfit for utilization. The entire output for 1907 exceeded 38,000\r\nbushels, valued at $26,250. Thirty-six men depend partially upon the\r\nbusiness for a livelihood.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                           $96,540\r\n  Power boats,                                      9\r\n  Value of power boats,                       $19,500\r\n  Dories and skiffs,                               17\r\n  Value of dories and skiffs,                    $340\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                     12\r\n      Tongs,                                       18\r\n  Value of implements,                         $2,000\r\n  Value of shore property,                     $6,200\r\n  Value of oysters on grant,                  $68,500\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nantucket._\r\n\r\nThe oyster industry of Nantucket is of recent origin, and the oysters\r\nare as yet raised only for home consumption.\r\n\r\nTwo grants have been leased by the selectmen, but only one of these is\r\nnow planted. These grants are situated in the east and west bends of\r\nPolpis harbor. The cultivated grant in the west bend comprises some\r\n20 acres, only 3 of which are of hard bottom and suitable for oyster\r\nculture, the remaining 17 having a soft mud bottom.\r\n\r\nThe \"seed\" planted on the grant is obtained at New Haven. In the last\r\nfew years the oysters on this grant have thrown a large quantity of\r\nspawn, which has caught on piles and stones at various places around\r\nNantucket harbor.\r\n\r\nThe only enemy to the Nantucket oyster is the oyster drill.\r\n\r\nThe production of marketable oysters for 1906-07 was 200 bushels,\r\nvalued at $400. These were sold for home trade on the island.\r\n\r\nOne man is engaged in the oyster business for a period of three months\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nThe oysters are taken both by dredging and with tongs.\r\n\r\n  Capital invested,                            $1,358\r\n  Power boats,                                      1\r\n  Value of power boats,                          $500\r\n  Dories,                                           1\r\n  Value of dories,                                $18\r\n  Implements:--\r\n      Dredges,                                      2\r\n      Tongs,                                        1\r\n  Value of implements,                            $15\r\n  Value of shore property,                        $25\r\n  Value of oysters on grant,                     $800\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] The Oyster Industry in the United States. Tenth Census of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[16] Returns of the Massachusetts department on fisheries and game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAM (_Mya arenaria_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mya arenaria_, commonly known as the \"soft\" or \"long-neck\" clam, is\r\nfound along the entire Massachusetts coast, wherever there is afforded\r\na sufficient shelter from the open ocean. Exposed beaches with open\r\nsurf are never inhabited by this mollusk, which is usually found on the\r\ntide flats of bays, inlets and rivers, and on the sheltered beaches\r\nbetween high and low tide lines. The clam occurs in various kinds of\r\nsoil, from rocky gravel to soft mud, but grows best in a tenacious soil\r\nof mud and sand, where it lies buried at a depth of from 6 to 12 inches.\r\n\r\nAs Cape Cod marks the dividing line between a northern and a southern\r\nfauna, it also divides the clam flats of Massachusetts into two\r\ndistinct areas. The same clam is found both north and south of Cape\r\nCod, but the natural conditions under which it lives are quite\r\ndifferent. In comparing these two areas, several points of difference\r\nare noted.\r\n\r\n(1) The clam areas of the north coast are mostly large flats, while\r\nthose of the south shore are confined to a narrow shore strip, as\r\nBuzzards Bay and the south side of Cape Cod for certain geological\r\nreasons do not possess flats, but merely beaches.\r\n\r\n(2) The rise and fall of the tide is much higher on the north shore,\r\nthus giving an extent of available flats nearly six times the clam area\r\nsouth of Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n(3) Clam growth as a rule is much faster on the north shore. This is\r\ndue to the great amount of tide flow over the river flats of the north\r\nshore. Current is the main essential for rapid clam growth, as it\r\ntransports the food. The average south shore flats possess merely the\r\nrise and fall of the tide, and as a rule have not the currents of the\r\nnorth shore rivers.\r\n\r\n(4) The temperature of the northern waters is several degrees colder\r\nthan the waters south of Cape Cod. This affords, as has been shown\r\nexperimentally, a longer season of growth for the southern clam. The\r\nnorth shore clam in the Essex region only increases the size of its\r\nshell through the six summer months, while the south shore clam grows\r\nslightly during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe present advantages lie wholly with the north shore district, as\r\nthrough overdigging the less extensive areas of southern Massachusetts\r\nhave become in most parts commercially barren. Overdigging has not\r\noccurred to the same extent on the north shore, owing to the vast\r\nextent of the flats. Nevertheless, many acres of these, as at Plymouth,\r\nKingston, Duxbury, and even Gloucester and Essex, have become wholly or\r\npartially unproductive. The only important clamming in Massachusetts\r\nto-day is found in the towns bordering Ipswich Bay. The south shore and\r\na good part of the north shore furnish but few clams for the market.\r\n\r\nIn view of restocking the barren areas through cultural methods, the\r\nnorth shore possesses two advantages over the south shore: it has a\r\nlarger natural supply at present, which will make restocking easier; it\r\nhas larger areas of flats, which can be made to produce twenty times\r\nthe normal yield of the south shore flats. Although, compared with the\r\nnorth shore, the clam area of the south shore seems poor, it is above\r\nthe average when compared with the clam areas of the other States\r\nsouth of Massachusetts, and when properly restocked the clam flats of\r\nsouthern Massachusetts should furnish a large annual production.\r\n\r\nIf the clam industry is not properly cared for, it will be totally\r\nruined before many years. The clammers do not realize this, because of\r\na mistaken impression that nature will forever furnish them with good\r\nclamming, and they have little thought for the future; while, on the\r\nother hand, the consumer is indifferent from lack of knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Scope of the Report._--The object of this report is to present in\r\nbrief form the condition of the clam fishery in Massachusetts. For this\r\npurpose facts showing the present extent of the industry have been\r\ncompiled, with the view of furnishing both the clammer and consumer\r\nwith certain desirable information.\r\n\r\nThe report will consider: (1) general conditions of the industry of\r\n1907; (2) a survey of the clam-producing area, illustrated by maps;\r\n(3) a plan of clam culture which will make productive many acres of\r\nbarren flats; (4) the history of the clam industry, a comparison being\r\nmade between the industries of 1879 and 1907; (5) a description of the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Work._--The same methods as used with the other shellfish\r\nwere pursued in obtaining the statistical data for the clam industry.\r\nThe clam-producing areas were examined and the observations recorded.\r\nTown records, which were of some assistance with the other shellfish,\r\nfurnished practically no clam data, compelling the Commission to\r\nrely upon the estimates of the clammers and clam dealers. While this\r\nmethod made it difficult to secure accurate detailed information, the\r\nstatistics for each town were checked up in a variety of ways, thus\r\nfurnishing as nearly correct figures as can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn making an historical comparison of 1879 and 1907, the report\r\nof Ernest Ingersoll on the clam fishery of the United States, and\r\nthe report of A. Howard Clark on the fisheries of Massachusetts,\r\nas published in the United States Fish Commission Report, Section\r\nV, volume 2, and Section II., respectively, were of great use, as\r\npractically all of the statistics for 1879 were obtained from these two\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nIn making the survey of the clam areas, records were made of: (1)\r\nsoil; (2) food (_a_) in water, (_b_) on surface of soil; (3) rate of\r\ncurrents; (4) abundance of clams and localities of set; (5) barren\r\nflats that can be made productive. In the present report only the kind\r\nof soil, abundance of clams and area of barren flats will be given, the\r\nfood problem being reserved for later publication.\r\n\r\n_Summary._--In the following summary the seacoast towns are arranged\r\nin geographical order from north to south. The number of men includes\r\nboth regular and intermittent clammers who dig for the market; all\r\nothers are excluded. In determining the production of any town it\r\nis impossible to obtain exactly correct figures, as the amount dug\r\nfor home consumption is an unestimable quantity, and the clams are\r\nmarketed in a number of ways, rendering it almost impossible to get\r\ncomplete statistics. The production statistics have been obtained in\r\na variety of ways, and the final estimates have resulted from careful\r\nconsideration of all facts. The invested capital includes the clammer's\r\noutfit and boat, but does not include personal apparel, such as boots\r\nand oil skins.\r\n\r\nThe clam flats are divided into two main divisions: (1) productive; and\r\n(2) barren. The barren areas are those where at present no clams grow\r\nat all, not even scattering; and areas yielding even a few clams are\r\nstill considered productive flats, though to all practical purposes\r\nbarren. It was necessary to make the division thus, as otherwise no\r\ndecisive line could be drawn. The barren flats are divided into those\r\nsections that can be made productive and those that can never be made\r\nto grow clams. The productive flats, on the other hand, are divided\r\ninto areas of good clamming and areas of scattering clams which do not\r\nsupport a commercial fishery. The normal production of the clam flats\r\nhas been carefully estimated, in view of the previous experiments of\r\nthe Fish and Game Commission, and the different classes of flats have\r\neach been given a certain valuation in computing the total for each\r\ntown. The areas given of the clam flats are based upon calculations, as\r\nno engineering survey was made.\r\n\r\nThe price of clams varies in different localities, and chiefly depends\r\nupon the quality of clams and the method of marketing. In certain towns\r\nclams are \"shucked\" (removed from the shell),--a process which greatly\r\nincreases their market value; while in other places they are sold only\r\nin the shell. These two facts account for the apparent variation in the\r\nvalue of the production in different localities, as each town is given\r\nits own market price.\r\n\r\nThe following production table does not include an important\r\nfactor,--the amount of clams dug by the summer people. An unestimable\r\nquantity is annually taken from the flats in this way, and is not\r\nincluded in the production statistics. Indeed, summer people have\r\naffected the clamming interests of several towns, as the selectmen\r\nhave refused to place closed seasons, etc., on certain depleted flats\r\nin order to cater to the summer residents, who desire free clamming\r\nnear their cottages. The total number of licenses issued by the boards\r\nof health of Boston and New Bedford for taking shellfish in their\r\nrespective harbors are given as representing the number of clammers. In\r\nreality, however, only a few of these licensees make a regular business\r\nof clamming.\r\n\r\n                     SUMMARY OF THE CLAM INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  =============+======+=========+=================+===========================+\r\n               |      |         |1907 PRODUCTION. |        TOTAL AREA.        |\r\n               |      |         +--------+--------+-----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n               |Number|         |        |        |     |     |       |Mussels|\r\n      TOWN.    |  of  | Capital |        |        |     |     |       |and Eel|\r\n               | Men. |invested.|Bushels.| Value. |Sand.| Mud.|Gravel.| Grass.|\r\n  -------------+------+---------+--------+--------+-----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n  Salisbury,   |66[17]|    $625 |  15,000| $16,500|   34|  216|     -

People who live along the seashore\r\nrealize that they can no longer gather the amount of clams they once\r\ncould dig with ease from the same flats. On the southern shore of the\r\nState especially it is oftentimes difficult to obtain even enough for\r\nfamily use. The consumer also realizes the loss of the clam, as he is\r\nforced to pay higher prices.\r\n\r\nIf specific cases of this decline are demanded, the following instances\r\nshould show the exact depletion in the various localities. Even in the\r\nbest clam-producing town of the State, Newburyport, where the clam\r\nproduction, according to statistics, has apparently increased during\r\nthe last twenty-five years (as a result of more men entering the\r\nfishery), the supply has shown signs of failing. Essex now possesses\r\nmany acres of flats formerly productive which now lie in a practically\r\nbarren condition. Gloucester can no longer boast of her former clam\r\nindustry, as the flats in Annisquam River are in poor condition. Hardly\r\n30 men now make a business of clamming in that town, whereas 92 men\r\nwere engaged in the fishery in 1879. Passing south of Gloucester, we\r\nfind great evidence of decline in the Boston harbor flats. Even before\r\nthe edict closing the harbor from clammers was in force, the production\r\ndid not by any means equal that of 1879. Plymouth harbor, including the\r\nthree towns of Duxbury, Kingston and Plymouth, furnishes an excellent\r\nillustration of this decline. Here an area of flats as extensive as\r\nall the other flats of the State combined now lies practically barren,\r\nwhereas in former times great quantities of clams were taken. These\r\nflats had already become depleted to a marked extent by 1879, and\r\nto-day practically no clams are shipped to market from the Duxbury\r\nflats, although you can still read \"Duxbury clams\" on the menus of\r\nthe hotels and restaurants, showing how important a clam industry\r\nthis town once possessed. Buzzards Bay district lies at present\r\nunproductive except for supplying home consumption and the demands of\r\nthe summer people. The shores of Cape Cod no longer yield their former\r\nsupply of clams, and the most striking example of the extinction of a\r\nflourishing fishery is found in the town of Chatham, which now does not\r\nproduce one-tenth part of its production in 1879. The Fall River or\r\nNarragansett Bay district does not come up to its past productiveness,\r\nand now chiefly yields clams which in former times would have been\r\nconsidered as too small to use.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen by the following table, which gives a comparison between\r\nthe industry in 1879 and 1907, the localities south of Gloucester all\r\nshow a decline in their production, and there is no town on the coast\r\nwhich has not shown some depletion in the natural clam supply. The\r\nlocalities of the north shore, while indicating by their statistics a\r\ngain in production, nevertheless have not their former abundance, and\r\nthe actual diminution of the supply is concealed by the fact that more\r\nmen have entered the industry.\r\n\r\n  =====================+=========================+===========================\r\n                       |          1879.          |         1907.\r\n      LOCALITY.        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n                       |  Men. |Bushels.| Value. |  Men.  |Bushels.| Value.\r\n  ---------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------\r\n  Ipswich,             |   75  | 11,500 | $4,600 |  136   | 25,000 | $18,750\r\n  Salisbury and        |       |        |        |        |        |\r\n      Newburyport,     |   60  | 28,800 | 11,520 |  241   | 70,500 |  77,500\r\n  Essex,               |   75  | 11,500 |  4,500 |   50   | 15,000 |  12,750\r\n  Gloucester,          |   92  | 13,978 |  5,200 |   31   |  6,000 |   8,000\r\n  Boston harbor,       |   90  | 40,000 | 20,000 | 350[19]|  7,500 |   6,000\r\n  Duxbury,             |  -[20]|  5,000 |  2,500 |    5   |    700 |     600\r\n  Plymouth             |  -[20]|  5,000 |  2,500 |    6   |  3,000 |   2,500\r\n  Harwich,             |   15  |  1,125 |    400 |    -   |    100 |      80\r\n  Chatham,             |  150  | 35,000 | 12,250 |   10   |  1,500 |   1,200\r\n  Nantucket,           |  -[19]|  2,253 |    872 |    4   |    400 |     350\r\n  Edgartown,           |  -[20]|  4,000 |  1,570 |    7   |  1,200 |   1,000\r\n  New Bedford district,|  -[20]|  5,800 |  2,900 | 332[19]|  1,600 |   1,685\r\n  Fall River district, |  -[20]|  3,375 |  3,121 |   25   |  5,315 |   5,290\r\n  =====================+=======+========+========+========+========+==========\r\n\r\n_Causes of the Decline._--The same cause which has been stated in the\r\ngeneral report has contributed to the decline of the clam supply,\r\n_i.e._, the increasing demand which has led to overfishing. Thus the\r\ndecline can be directly attributed to the exploiting of natural clam\r\nresources by man, although it must be admitted that natural agencies,\r\nsuch as geographical changes, destroy the clam flats of certain\r\nlocalities and build up others.\r\n\r\nThis decline has become possible through the indifference of the towns\r\nto the welfare of their clam fishery, and by not restricting, through\r\ntown laws, the extermination of the clams in time to allow nature to\r\nreplenish the flats. Some towns, such as Ipswich, have regulated this\r\nmatter by placing closed seasons on portions of the flats, which has\r\nbeen the partial means of preserving their natural supply. Thus the\r\ntown laws have proved inadequate, as most towns have no laws at all, or\r\nhave such unwise ones that they often defeat their own object.\r\n\r\nIt is again necessary to emphasize the need of reform in the clam\r\nindustry. This Commonwealth once possessed an extensive supply of\r\nclams, and still possesses part of its former abundance; but the\r\npresent supply is diminishing at such a rate that it will not be\r\na quarter of a century before the natural clam fishery will be\r\ncommercially extinct. On the south shore clams are now commercially\r\nextinct, and it is only a question of time, if the present methods are\r\nallowed to remain, before the north shore clams will also disappear.\r\nThe experiments of the Massachusetts department of fisheries and game\r\nand the work of men who have planted this shellfish all show that\r\nthousands of dollars can be brought into the State by utilizing the\r\nwaste clam areas, and that the production can be so increased as to\r\neven exceed that of former years. Immediate action is necessary, if\r\nthis important industry is to be saved.\r\n\r\n_The Remedy._--The remedy is comparatively simple, and abundant proof\r\nof its success is at hand. By restocking the barren and unproductive\r\nareas of the Commonwealth the present production can be increased many\r\ntimes. Experiments have shown that clams can be readily, successfully\r\nand economically transplanted, and that it is a completely practical\r\nundertaking. Not only can the barren areas be restocked, but the yield\r\nof the productive areas can be much increased. Clam farming is the only\r\npractical method of restocking these areas, and only through such means\r\ncan the clam flats be made to yield their normal harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clam Farming._\r\n\r\nThe subject of clam farming has received a good deal of attention the\r\npast few years, and much has been said concerning the enormous profits\r\nwhich would result from the cultivation of this shellfish. While the\r\nnewspaper statements have been for the most part correct, there has\r\nbeen considerable exaggeration and many details have been inaccurate.\r\nTo remove any misapprehensions, the following account of clam farming\r\nis given.\r\n\r\nThe value of clam farming has been perhaps overestimated. While no\r\nfabulous returns are ever to be expected, the yield is large in\r\nproportion to the labor, and steady returns are sure. The methods\r\nused are simple, the capital required is small, the area suitable for\r\nraising clams is extensive, and clam farming gives promise of becoming\r\none of the most prominent and remunerative shore industries. The\r\nprofits derived from such a system should furnish steady employment for\r\nhundreds of men on the Massachusetts coast.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts possesses thousands of acres of tidal flats which are\r\ncapable of producing clams. Most of these flats are practically barren,\r\n_i.e._, produce no clams in paying quantities, and yet if planted with\r\nsmall clams will yield in from one to two years large quantities of\r\nmarketable bivalves. This large area of barren flats should be divided\r\ninto small farms, which should be leased to individuals for the purpose\r\nof planting and raising clams.\r\n\r\n_The Necessity of Clam Farming._--It is a well-known fact that the\r\nnatural supply of clams is becoming rapidly exhausted, and that this\r\nimportant fishery will become commercially extinct unless steps are\r\ntaken to check its decline. The only practical means known at the\r\npresent time is _clam farming_. In the past, methods such as close\r\nseasons and restricting the catch have been used, but with poor\r\nresults, as these have been economically wrong. The correct method\r\nin such cases is not to restrict the demand, but to increase the\r\nsupply. Clam farming offers the only means of increasing the natural\r\nproduction, and not only checking the decline, but establishing a large\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n_Is Clam Farming Practical?_--Clam farming is not a theory but an\r\n_established fact_. Clams will grow if planted in suitable places, and\r\nwill yield large returns. For three years the Commission of Fisheries\r\nand Game have made numerous experiments in clam farming in many\r\nseacoast towns. They have not only proved its complete practicability,\r\nbut have also shown that large profits result from successful planting.\r\nRecords are on file at the State House showing the exact results of\r\nthese experimental farms, which indicate the future success of clam\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\nBesides the experiments of the Commission on Fisheries and Game,\r\n_successful clam farming_ is now being carried on in several towns of\r\nthe State. The leading town in this line is Essex, where at least 15\r\ngrants are held by the clammers. The only protection given is based\r\nupon public sentiment, which, however, is sufficient to insure the\r\nsuccess of the enterprise. All these grants were staked out on flats\r\nwhich were producing no clams when granted, although part of this\r\narea was once very productive. So far these grants have proved most\r\nsuccessful, thus proving by actual experience that clam farming is a\r\nworthy rival of agriculture.\r\n\r\n_Historical Attempts at Clam Farming._--Clam farming has been in\r\nexistence for years. The first record of any legislation upon this\r\nsubject is found in an act to regulate the clam fishery in and around\r\nthe shores of Plymouth, Kingston and Duxbury in 1870, whereby a license\r\nwas granted for a term not exceeding five years to any inhabitant\r\nof these towns to plant, cultivate and dig clams. This license cost\r\n$2.50, and gave the exclusive use of the flats and creeks described\r\nto the licensee and his heirs during the time specified, and also the\r\nright in an action of tort to recover treble damages from any person\r\nwho, without his consent, dug or took clams from said grant. Evidently\r\nnothing was done to follow out this law, which was soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 an act was passed to regulate the shellfisheries (including\r\nclams) in the waters of Mount Hope Bay and its tributaries. The terms\r\nof this act were practically the same as the Plymouth act, the only\r\ndifference being the substitution of the word _shellfish_ for _clam_.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 an act was passed by the town of Winthrop, authorizing the\r\nplanting of clams on the shores of that town. The grant was to consist\r\nof not over 2 acres of _barren_ flats, situated more than 500 feet from\r\nhigh-water mark. The other provisions of this act were the same as\r\nthose of the Plymouth act of 1870.\r\n\r\nThe most important clam culture law was passed in 1888. This authorized\r\nthe planting of clams on the shores of Essex. Here the provisions of\r\nthe law were followed out, and the first energetic attempt at clam\r\nfarming started. The law, the provisions of which were nearly the same\r\nas the previous laws, reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nACTS OF 1888, CHAPTER 198.\r\n\r\n      AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE PLANTING OF CLAMS, IN AND AROUND THE\r\n                           SHORES OF ESSEX.\r\n\r\n    _Be it enacted, etc., as follows:_\r\n\r\n    SECTION 1. The selectmen of the town of Essex may by writing\r\n    under their hands grant a license for such a term of years, not\r\n    exceeding five, as they in their discretion may deem necessary\r\n    and the public good requires, to any inhabitant of said town,\r\n    to plant, cultivate and dig clams upon and in any flats and\r\n    creeks in said town now unproductive thereof, not exceeding two\r\n    acres to any one person, and not impairing the private rights\r\n    of any person.\r\n\r\n    SECTION 2. Such license shall describe by metes and bounds\r\n    the flats and creeks so appropriated and shall be recorded by\r\n    the town clerk before it shall have any force, and the person\r\n    licensed shall pay to the selectmen for the use of said town\r\n    two dollars and to the clerk fifty cents.\r\n\r\n    SECTION 3. The person so licensed and his heirs and assigns\r\n    shall for the purposes aforesaid have the exclusive use of\r\n    the flats and creeks described in the license during the term\r\n    specified therein, and may in an action of tort recover treble\r\n    damages of any person, who, without his or their consent digs\r\n    or takes clams from such flats or creeks during the continuance\r\n    of the license.\r\n\r\n    SECTION 4. Said town of Essex at any legal meeting called for\r\n    the purpose may make such by-laws, not repugnant to the laws of\r\n    the commonwealth, as they may from time to time deem expedient\r\n    to protect and preserve the shellfisheries within said town.\r\n\r\n    SECTION 5. Whoever takes any shellfish from within the waters\r\n    of said town of Essex in violation of the by-laws established\r\n    by it or of the provisions of this act shall for every offence\r\n    pay a fine of not less than five or more than ten dollars\r\n    and costs of prosecution, and one dollar for every bushel of\r\n    shellfish so taken.\r\n\r\n    SECTION 6. This act shall take effect upon its passage.\r\n    [_Approved April 9, 1888._]\r\n\r\nIn the report of the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries\r\nfor 1894 Mr. Ansley Hall gives the following account of clam culture\r\nunder this act:--\r\n\r\n    During the first two years (1889-90) the people were slow to\r\n    avail themselves of the privilege of planting, for fear that\r\n    after they had spent their time and labor they would not be\r\n    able to secure protection from trespassers; but in 1891 and\r\n    1892 lots were obtained and planted. In 1892 there were 25\r\n    acres that were quite productive, about one-third of the entire\r\n    catch of the section being obtained from them. The catch from\r\n    these lots is not definitely known, but is estimated at about\r\n    2,500 barrels.\r\n\r\n    Cultivated clams possess some advantage over the natural\r\n    growth, from the fact that they are more uniform in size, and\r\n    are as large as the best natural clam. They bring $1.75 per\r\n    barrel, while the natural clams sell for $1.50 per barrel. This\r\n    is the price received by the diggers. One acre of these clams\r\n    is considered to be worth $1,000, if well seeded and favorably\r\n    located so as not to be in danger of being submerged with sand.\r\n    This valuation would be too high for an average, since all the\r\n    acres are not equally well seeded and located. The clammers\r\n    are generally impressed that the industry can be extensively\r\n    and profitably developed, and their only fear is that they\r\n    will not be able to secure lots permanently. The greater part\r\n    of the land available for this purpose is covered by the deeds\r\n    of people owning farms along the river, and the consent of the\r\n    land owners has to be obtained before lots can be taken up.\r\n    It seems probable, however, that the business will continue\r\n    to progress unless checked by complications that may arise\r\n    relative to the occupancy of the grounds.\r\n\r\nThe result of this first practical attempt at clam culture was a\r\ncomplete failure, and after a few years' trial the clam farms were all\r\ngiven up. The main reason for this failure was lack of protection both\r\nfrom outsiders and from one another. Nevertheless, this attempt proved\r\nthat with proper protection a most successful industry could be made of\r\nclam farming. The following statement by Prof. James L. Kellogg, in the\r\nUnited States Fish Commission Bulletin for 1899, describes the failure\r\nof clam culture at Essex:--\r\n\r\n    It is not difficult to determine the reasons for the failure\r\n    of the culture experiment at Essex. The areas upon which clams\r\n    were planted were those which were at the time unproductive.\r\n    The beds still containing clams--the \"town flats\"--were free\r\n    to any native of Essex. The one thing which was absolutely\r\n    necessary to the success of any planter was that the clams on\r\n    his leased ground should not be disturbed by other diggers.\r\n    This protection was apparently not given in any case by the\r\n    town authorities, and, as no person lived within sight of the\r\n    majority of the beds, it was quite impossible for any man to\r\n    guard his property much of the time.\r\n\r\n    As to what followed it is not easy to obtain definite testimony\r\n    from the clammers themselves. Other citizens of the town,\r\n    however, and some few clammers, intimate that most of the men\r\n    began to take clams from any property but their own, and that\r\n    in this way the full result of no man's labor in planting was\r\n    ever realized. Others who did not make clam digging a regular\r\n    business, but only dug occasionally, are said to have had no\r\n    respect for the rights of those who had leased property. It was\r\n    said that at times when vessel builders and the shoe factory\r\n    released employees, many of them, for lack of other occupation,\r\n    turned their attention to clam digging, with the result that\r\n    too many clams were at the time taken from the flats.\r\n\r\n    Another reason for the failure of the Essex experiment is that\r\n    a number of short-sighted clammers began to fear, after the\r\n    clams had been planted, that the production might suddenly\r\n    become so great as to glut their market, and, as a consequence,\r\n    force prices down. Some few individuals, inspired by this fear,\r\n    are reported to have said and to have done everything in their\r\n    power to prevent the success of the experiment. In all cases,\r\n    it is said, the selectmen of the town, who issued the leases,\r\n    refused their aid in the prosecution of trespassers.\r\n\r\n    In spite of the fact, which had been demonstrated in the\r\n    experiment, that when properly planted the clams grew much more\r\n    rapidly and became much larger than on the natural beds, no\r\n    applications for a renewal of the leases were made when the\r\n    first ones expired. No change in the condition at Essex may be\r\n    hoped for until there is some evidence that a law protecting\r\n    the planter will be strictly enforced. With proper protection,\r\n    a great industry might, and probably would, be quickly\r\n    established, not only in Essex, but in any region where clam\r\n    flats are now unproductive because of excessive digging.\r\n\r\n_Protection Necessary._--The same lack of protection which ruined the\r\nEssex clam experiments has been the cause of similar failures in other\r\nshore towns. As long as no protection is given, clam farming can never\r\nbecome possible, as the whole success of the enterprise depends wholly\r\nupon the planter's having complete control of his land. The present\r\nlaw gives absolutely no protection, as according to the old free beach\r\nlaw a person has a right to dig a mess of clams anywhere between the\r\ntide lines, no matter whether natural or planted. This practically\r\ndiscourages clam farming, however profitable, as no clammer is going to\r\nthe labor and expense of planting clams, if the next person who comes\r\nalong has a legal right to dig as many as he pleases. Until a law is\r\npassed which gives to the clam planter absolute protection from this\r\nsort of trespassing, and does away with the antiquated free fishing\r\nlaw, clam culture can never become a successful industry.\r\n\r\n_Present Clam Culture._--In 1906 grants of barren flats were again\r\nissued for the purpose of clam culture in Essex, and this time the\r\nattempt seemed successful. Two things encouraged this: the excellent\r\nresults of the experiments in Essex River by the Commission on\r\nFisheries and Game, and the possible results indicated by the\r\nexperiments of 1888. The only protection for these clam grants is by\r\npublic sentiment, and the mutual agreement of all the clammers to\r\nrespect the rights of the individual. So far there has been no trouble\r\nfrom trespassing and the lack of protection, which caused the failure\r\nof first attempts. It is hoped that these clam farms will become\r\npermanently successful, despite the lack of protection, as they will\r\ngreatly increase the production of the Essex clam flats.\r\n\r\n_Clam Farming and Agriculture._--The comparison between clam farming\r\nand agriculture is very close, and both possess many common features,\r\nthough there are several points of difference. The clam obtains its\r\nsustenance entirely from the water, while agricultural products obtain\r\ntheir nourishment chiefly from the soil. The nitrogenous waste products\r\nof the land washed into the streams furnish the nourishment to the\r\nlittle marine plants (diatoms) on which the clams feed.\r\n\r\n_Rate of Growth of the Clam._--The report of the Commission on\r\nFisheries and Game for the year 1906 contains the following\r\nstatements:--\r\n\r\n_What is the natural growth of the clam per year?_\r\n\r\nThere is great diversity in the growth of the clam, owing to the\r\nlocation in respect to three essential conditions,--current, length\r\nof time submerged, and soil. The following figures give briefly the\r\ngeneral trend of results from numerous experimental beds under great\r\nvariety of conditions. For simplicity, a 1-inch clam is taken as the\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nA 1-inch clam will grow in one year to a size between 2 and 3 inches.\r\nUnder fairly favorable conditions, with a moderate current, a 1-inch\r\nclam will increase to 2½ inches, or a gain of 900 per cent, in volume.\r\nFor every quart planted, the yield in one year will be 9 quarts. For\r\nbeds without current, 1-inch clams average about 2 inches, or a gain\r\nof 500 per cent.; _i.e._, five quarts for every quart planted. Beds\r\nunder exceptionally fine conditions have shown the amazing return of\r\n15 quarts for every quart of 1-inch clams planted. Clams increased in\r\nthese beds from 1 to 3 inches in length. Therefore, by planting clams 1\r\ninch or over, under _favorable_ conditions a _marketable_ clam can be\r\nproduced in _one year_.\r\n\r\n_What is the maximum production per square foot?_\r\n\r\nThe number of clams per square foot that can be raised to the best\r\nadvantage depends upon the location of the flat in respect to natural\r\nconditions. Clams thickly planted (15 to 20 per square foot) in\r\nfavorable locations may show a greater growth than when thinly planted\r\n(5 per square foot) in less favorable locations; therefore, no definite\r\nstatement can be made which will apply in all cases. The only rule\r\nthat can be given is that a flat with a current will produce a greater\r\nnumber of clams per square foot than one without a current. On good\r\nflats clams can be planted conveniently and economically from 10 to 15\r\nper square foot, or even a larger number.\r\n\r\n_What results can be obtained by planting on barren flats?_\r\n\r\nThere are two groups of flats which come under the term barren:\r\n(1) flats which once produced clams in great numbers, but now are\r\npractically barren, except for an occasional clam here and there;\r\n(2) flats which never have produced clams, and on which for physical\r\nreasons clams can never grow. The first group of flats is alone\r\nconsidered in this answer.\r\n\r\nExperimental beds were planted on certain flats in the Essex River\r\nwhich come within the first group of barren flats. These once\r\nproductive flats had been cleaned out in the past, and for some reason\r\nhad not seeded naturally. Forty beds were laid out under all kinds of\r\nconditions, with the object of finding a way to make these once more\r\nproductive. Results have been all that could be hoped for. Only 4 poor\r\nbeds were found, out of the 40 laid out; 36 beds were in thriving\r\ncondition. It should be noted that no attempt was made to choose the\r\nbest places, but all conditions were tried. Over two-thirds of the\r\nclams were re-dug, the increase averaging, in terms of 1-inch clams,\r\nover 1,000 per cent., or 10 quarts for every quart planted the year\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIf many acres of Massachusetts flat, idle at present, are capable of\r\nsuch a yield, should such economic waste be allowed? Why should not\r\nthe towns, by the expenditure of a little money, restock flats such as\r\nthese for the benefit of their inhabitants? I do not say that all flats\r\ncan be made productive in this way, as I know of many cases where the\r\nmere sowing of seed clams will not restock a flat; but I do say that\r\nMassachusetts possesses enough flats of the former nature, which should\r\nbe made a profit to her clammers. Clam set occurs, as Mr. Stevenson\r\nshows in his report, in large quantities; the transportation of seed\r\nclams is easy; planting requires little labor, the practical way being\r\nto sow the clams, which burrow readily; while the yield in proportion\r\nto the labor is enormous.\r\n\r\n_What sized clams are best for planting?_\r\n\r\nThe size best adapted must be determined for each flat. Shore flats\r\nwith little current will allow the planting of any size, from ¼ inch\r\nup; flats with a swift current necessitate a larger clam (1 to 1½\r\ninches), as the smaller will be washed out of its burrow; soft mud also\r\ndemands a larger clam, as the smaller will be stifled by the oozy silt.\r\n\r\n_What are the physical conditions that influence the growth of clams?_\r\n\r\nThere appear at least three essential conditions for rapid growth of\r\nclams: (1) a good current; (2) low and level flat; and (3) a tenacious\r\nsoil, relatively free from decaying matter.\r\n\r\nA low flat gives the clams longer feeding periods, as the water remains\r\nover them longer, therefore there is a greater growth. This has been\r\nexperimentally shown by Dr. A. D. Mead.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. J. L. Kellogg, clams cannot do well in a soil\r\nwhich contains much decaying organic matter, as the acids eat away\r\nthe shells. Soils of this description also facilitate the spread of\r\ninfection from one clam to another.\r\n\r\nCurrent is the chief essential for successful clam culture. The term\r\n\"current\" does not imply a rapid flow of water, but rather a good\r\ncirculation of water over the flat. In the Essex and Ipswich rivers the\r\nclam flats have a continuous current. On such flats the growth is more\r\nrapid than on flats which have no circulation of water, in addition to\r\nthe mere rise and fall of the tide. The current performs the work of\r\n(1) keeping the flats clean and carrying away all contamination, but\r\nits most important work is as (2) _food carrier_.\r\n\r\n_Value of a Clam Farm._--The value of an acre of clam flats, if\r\nproperly cultivated, is about $450 per year for the average clam flat.\r\nMany of the more productive flats will yield a far greater amount,\r\nwhile others will not yield as much. It has been often erroneously\r\nstated that an acre of clam flats would produce $1,000 per year. This\r\nis a decided overestimation, as it would be hardly possible for the\r\nmost productive flat to yield that amount. It is possible, however,\r\nfor a good flat to yield about $750 per year, but this is only under\r\nthe most favorable conditions. Such yields as these are large for the\r\nclammer, whose average yearly income is only $400 (a few of the more\r\nexpert clammers make possibly $700 to $750), and a man possessing a\r\nclam farm of 1½ to 2 acres would make a good living.\r\n\r\n_Method of operating a Clam Farm: choosing the Ground._--In choosing\r\na grant, the planter should have in mind three things: (1) the\r\naccessibility of the grant, for his own convenience, and nearness to\r\nthe market, as much of the success of clam farming depends upon the\r\nexpense of marketing the product, and the ease with which it can be\r\ndisposed of; (2) the length of time allowed for labor by the exposure\r\nof the flat (flats vary greatly in the amount of time exposed each\r\ntide, the low flats being submerged nearly all the time, and the high\r\nflats having a much longer exposure),--a high flat possesses the\r\nadvantage of allowing a longer working period for the clammer; (3)\r\nthe natural facilities of the flat itself as regards the growth of\r\nclams. Moreover, the flat should be chosen in regard to (1) soil; (2)\r\ncurrent; (3) tide. A good flat should have a soil which is tenacious\r\nand compact, affording at the same time easy digging. Probably the best\r\nsoil is a mixture of fine sand and mud in a ratio of one-third mud\r\nto two-thirds sand, as this amount of mud gives the right degree of\r\ntenacity.\r\n\r\nThe growth of a clam depends upon the circulation of water over the\r\nflat, as the current carries the food, and, therefore, the more current\r\nthe more food for the clams. Current also keeps the bed clean, and\r\nprevents contamination and disease from spreading among the clams.\r\nThen, again, the growth of a clam depends upon the amount of water over\r\nthe bed; _i.e._, length of time covered. The clam can only feed when\r\nthe tide is over the bed, and thus the feeding time is limited for\r\nthe higher flats. While experiments have shown that clams grow faster\r\nwhen continually under water than when exposed part of the time, the\r\nquestion of tide is not so great a factor as that of current in regard\r\nto clam growth, and can be almost disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe best flat for clam planting is a _fairly high flat_ with a _good\r\ncurrent_ over it, as it gives nearly as rapid growth and a much longer\r\nperiod to dig than a flat which is exposed only a short period. This\r\nflat must have the right kind of soil, which must not be shifting sand\r\nor too soft mud, but a compact, tenacious mixture.\r\n\r\n_The Seed Clams._--Nature has provided the means of stocking these\r\nfarms. The set of clams is usually restricted to certain localities,\r\nwhich, however, vary from time to time, and heavy sets are found in\r\nlimited areas. These sets run as thick as 2,000 per square foot of\r\nsurface, occasionally covering an area of 3 acres. From these natural\r\nset areas the natural clam flats are partially restocked by the washing\r\nout of the small clams. More often these whole sets are wasted, as\r\nthe clams, instead of washing on the good flats, are carried to\r\nunproductive places and consequently perish. Thus there are areas of\r\nheavy set which are of no use to any one, as practically all the clams\r\nperish before they become adults. These areas of heavy set occur in\r\nnearly every harbor of the coast to a greater or less extent, and are\r\navailable for nearly every town.\r\n\r\nThe problem now is to make use of these large sets, and not allow them\r\nto go to waste. It has been shown that these clams when transplanted\r\nwill grow much faster, and will not perish; therefore, clam farming\r\noffers both the possibility of saving these natural sets and utilizing\r\nbarren ground.\r\n\r\nMethods of spat collecting have been constantly referred to in\r\nconnection with clam farming, especially by the Rhode Island Fish\r\nCommission, and the impression has been given that clam farming can\r\nnever become a success until some practical method of spat collecting\r\nhas been found. With the soft clam there is no need of any method\r\nof spat collecting, as the natural set is more than sufficient for\r\nrestocking the barren flats. All that is necessary is to utilize\r\nthe enormous natural sets. If this is done, the barren flats of\r\nMassachusetts can be made productive.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty is in devising some method of obtaining the small\r\nclams with sufficient rapidity. As the nature of the soil and the\r\nsize of the clams vary, no one method can apply to every case, and it\r\ndepends upon the ingenuity of the clammer. The methods used at present\r\nare: (1) digging with an ordinary clam hoe, which is slow work; (2)\r\ndigging in shallow water, so that the clams may be washed out; (3)\r\ndigging a series of trenches across the heavy set area, and scooping\r\nout the clams washed in these trenches; (4) carrying both sand and\r\nclams by the dory load; (5) by using a sieve, in the form of a cradle,\r\nwhich washes the clams out in the water. This last method is the most\r\nsuccessful for small clams, and has been used by the commission in\r\nobtaining seed clams for their experimental beds. By using a cradle 3\r\nby 2 feet, covered with sand wire netting, clams which ran 3,000 per\r\nquart, were obtained by 3 men at the rate of 2 bushels an hour,--an\r\namount sufficient to plant from 1/25 to 1/10 of an acre.\r\n\r\nAnother problem of importance is the transportation of seed clams, as\r\nin many instances the clams will have to be carried some distance.\r\nThe best method of shipping seed clams is to pack them dry in damp\r\nsea weed, putting them in small packages, so they will not be crushed\r\nby their own weight. The best though most expensive method is to pack\r\nthe clams in crates, such as are used for strawberries. It has been\r\nfound that clams kept in water are not in such good condition as those\r\nshipped dry, and it is of the utmost importance that the clams be in\r\ngood condition when planted.\r\n\r\nThe length of time a clam will live out of its natural element depends\r\nupon the temperature; in cold weather it will keep for several days,\r\nand even weeks; while in warm weather the seed clam will be in poor\r\ncondition after one day's exposure.\r\n\r\n_Preparing the Grant._--Usually the ground needs no preparation, and\r\nthe clams can be planted at once. It is a good plan to remove any\r\nmussels and any of the enemies of the clam from the grant.\r\n\r\n_Planting the Clams._--The planting of the seed clams is perhaps the\r\neasiest work of the clam culturist, as it necessitates merely the\r\nsowing of the seed on the surface of the flat. The small clams when\r\nleft this way burrow into the ground as soon as the water is over them,\r\nand require no planting on the part of the culturist.\r\n\r\n_Working the Farm._--This style of farming requires no cultivation for\r\nthe growth of the clams. Once planted, the farmer has no further work\r\nuntil the time when he is ready to dig them. The clams grow better\r\nwhen undisturbed than when the soil is upturned by frequent digging.\r\nProtection from man and the natural enemies of the clam demand the\r\nattention of the owner at all times.\r\n\r\n_Harvesting the Clams._--The time of digging will vary as to the size\r\nof clam desired and the rate of growth on the grant. The clam farmer\r\ncan cater to a particular trade by regulating the size of the clams\r\nmarketed. He may find it more profitable to market a small clam after a\r\nshort period of growth, or _vice versa_, on the same principle that a\r\nfarmer raises hogs for the market.\r\n\r\nNorth of Boston, in localities favorable for fast growth, such as the\r\nEssex and Ipswich rivers, by planting large seed of at least l½ inches\r\nin the spring, marketable clams of 2½ to 3 inches can be obtained in\r\nthe fall after six months' growth. Here the clams grow only during the\r\nsummer months, and nothing would be gained by leaving them over winter.\r\nIn this way a crop each year can be raised on these farms. In other\r\nlocalities of slower growth it will take from eighteen to twenty-four\r\nmonths to raise a crop. The clam farmer will have to regulate the size\r\nof the seed and length of growth to best suit the needs of his farm.\r\n\r\n_Advantages of Clam Farming._--Clam culture possesses several\r\nadvantages over the old free-for-all digging: (1) steadier returns; (2)\r\neasier work; (3) better pay; (4) more clams per man. If the clammers\r\nof the Commonwealth only realized these facts they would make a united\r\neffort toward clam culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History._\r\n\r\nI. _Early History._--The history of the Massachusetts clam industry\r\nbegan in obscurity. Even before the time of the earliest settlers the\r\nnative Indians depended largely upon this abundant mollusk for their\r\nfood supply, as is clearly indicated by the scattered shell heaps which\r\nmark their ancient camp fires. Upon the arrival of the Pilgrims, clam\r\ndigging was incorporated among the most time-honored industries of the\r\nCommonwealth, and in times of want the early colonists depended largely\r\nupon this natural food supply. With the arrival of the colonists really\r\nbegan the first epoch of the clam fishery as an economic factor in\r\nthis Commonwealth, a period which lasted nearly two hundred years.\r\nThis period marked the exploitation of clam grounds merely for home\r\nconsumption. Money was scarce, inland markets were practically unknown,\r\nand the importance of this shellfish was confined merely to local\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nII. _Rise of the Bait Industry._--Early in the last century a growing\r\ndemand for clams as bait for the sea fisheries became apparent.\r\nClams had always been utilized for this purpose more or less, but an\r\nincreased demand called for the development of an important industry in\r\nthis line. Various centers of activity were established, particularly\r\nat Newburyport, Essex, Ipswich, Boston harbor and Chatham. The clams\r\nwere mainly shucked, that is, removed from the shell, and shipped\r\neither fresh or salted in barrels to the fishermen at Gloucester,\r\nBoston and Provincetown. This industry opened up new fields of\r\nemployment for many men and boys, and brought considerable ready money\r\ninto various coast communities.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Development of Inland Markets._--The consumption of clams\r\nfor food in the coast towns continued throughout the rise and gradual\r\ndecline of the bait industry, but the creation of inland markets did\r\nnot begin to be an important factor until 1875. It was about this time\r\nthat the clam came to be generally looked upon throughout the State\r\nas an article of food, and consequently an important industry was\r\ngradually evolved to meet this growing demand. This step marked the\r\nbeginning of the extensive fishery of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe mistaken policy of the average shellfish community, which\r\nregarded clam grounds as natural gardens of inexhaustible fertility,\r\nstill persisted even after the fallacy of this policy had long\r\nproved apparent through the depletion of extensive tracts. The same\r\nill-advised methods were pursued to the ultimate ruination of much\r\nvaluable territory. All wise regard for the future was overshadowed\r\nby the immediate needs of the present; local legislation fostered the\r\nevil; State legislation was conspicuous by its absence; and, left to\r\nthe mercy of unsystematic overdigging, these natural resources rapidly\r\nwasted away.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous tendencies which have lurked in the ruling policy of\r\nthe clam fishery have been shown in the rise and fall of the industry\r\nin certain localities. Forty years ago Duxbury and Plymouth ranked\r\nas the greatest clam towns of the coast. Their supply has long since\r\nbecome insignificant. Newburyport and Ipswich have become the chief\r\nproducers of the State clam harvest; but Essex and Gloucester, in the\r\nsame fertile regions, have greatly declined, and the industry at Rowley\r\nhas become nearly extinct. In the Fall River district the digging of\r\nsmall seed clams for food has brought the fishery to the verge of ruin.\r\nThe few resources of Buzzards Bay have become nearly exhausted, while\r\non Cape Cod the industry has shown here and there a temporary increase,\r\novershadowed by a far more extensive decline, such as at Chatham.\r\nFurthermore, the sewage contamination of coast waters in the harbors of\r\nBoston and several other large cities have closed extensive regions for\r\nthe production of food.\r\n\r\nIV. _Attempts to develop the Industry._--Various efforts have been\r\nmade to restrain overdigging the clam flats, by local regulations,\r\nparticularly by \"close\" seasons. These attempts have been productive\r\nof little good. Other efforts, designed to develop extensive tracts\r\nmade barren by wasteful methods of fishing, have been put in operation.\r\nThese efforts have been along two independent lines: the first, an\r\neffort on the part of the community to seed in common flats by the\r\nappropriation of money for that purpose, as in the case of Wellfleet;\r\nthe second, an attempt to arrive at the same end by leasing private\r\ngrants to individuals, as at Essex and Plymouth. These efforts, while\r\ntending in the right direction, have not as yet yielded the results\r\nthat might be wished for. Within the past three years the State has\r\ntaken hold of the problem, and by an extensive series of experiments is\r\nendeavoring to devise practical means of developing the great inherent\r\npossibilities in this extensive industry.\r\n\r\n CLAM PRODUCTION TABLE FOR MASSACHUSETTS, OBTAINED FROM THE REPORTS OF\r\n                  THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n  =======+==========+=========+===================\r\n         |          |         |\r\n   YEAR. | Bushels. |  Value. | Price per Bushel\r\n         |          |         |     (Cents).\r\n  -------+----------+---------+-------------------\r\n   1880, | 158,626  | $76,195 |      41.73\r\n   1887, | 230,659  | 121,202 |      52.54\r\n   1888, | 243,777  | 127,838 |      52.44\r\n   1889, | 240,831  | 137,711 |      57.14\r\n   1892, | 191,923  | 133,529 |      69.57\r\n   1898, | 147,095  | 102,594 |      69.74\r\n   1902, | 227,941  | 157,247 |      68.98\r\n   1905, | 217,519  | 209,545 |      96.19\r\n  =======+==========+=========+===================\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Clam Industry._\r\n\r\n_Methods of Digging._--The ordinary method of taking clams is so simple\r\nas hardly to need explanation. Although simple, clam digging requires\r\nconsiderable skill, and it takes years of experience to become a good\r\nclammer.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of clam digging used in Massachusetts,--the\r\n\"wet\" and the \"dry\" digging. Wet digging is carried on when water is\r\nover the clam beds; dry digging, which is the common method, takes\r\nplace when the flats are left exposed by the tides. The only places in\r\nMassachusetts where wet digging is carried on regularly are Eastham,\r\nChatham, Swansea, and in Katama Bay, Edgartown. In the lower end of\r\nKatama Bay is found a submerged bed of clams which is one of the most\r\nproductive beds of this class in Massachusetts. These submerged clams\r\nare taken with what is known locally as a \"sea horse,\" which is an\r\nenlarged clam hoe, with prongs 12 to 14 inches long, and a strong\r\nwooden handle four feet in length. This handle has a belt attachment\r\nwhich is buckled around the clammer. Two men are required for this\r\nwork. The sea horse is worked deep into the loose sand and is dragged\r\nalong by one man, who wades in the shallow water over these submerged\r\nflats, while his partner follows, gathering the clams which the sea\r\nhorse roots out. Another method of wet digging is called \"churning,\"\r\nand is based on the same principle as the above method, only the clams\r\nare turned out under water by long forks or hoes. This method is not\r\nused in Massachusetts to any extent. Excellent results are usually\r\nobtained from wet digging.\r\n\r\nThe methods used in dry digging depend upon the nature of the soil.\r\nThe difference lies only in the kind of digger. The clam hoe of the\r\nsouth shore, where the soil is either coarse sand or gravel, has broad\r\nprongs, some even being 1¼ inches across. The usual number of prongs\r\nis four, but occasionally three broad prongs suffice. The clam hoe of\r\nthe north shore, often called \"hooker,\" has four thin, sharp prongs\r\nand a short handle. The set of this handle is a matter of choice with\r\nthe individual clammers, some preferring a sharp, acute angle, and\r\nothers a right angle. This style of clam hoe is best suited for the\r\nhard, tenacious clam flats of the north shore. At Essex spading forks\r\nare used for clamming, but not as extensively as the hooker. For sand\r\ndigging the forks are said to be better, while for mud digging the\r\nhooker is preferred.\r\n\r\n_Outfit of a Clammer._--The outfit of a clammer does not require much\r\noutlay of capital. A skiff or dory, one or two clam hoes and three or\r\nfour clam baskets complete the list. Occasionally, as at Ipswich, where\r\nthe clam grounds are widely scattered, power dories are used, and this\r\nnecessitates the investment of considerable capital; but the investment\r\nof the average clammer does not exceed $26. Personal apparel, such as\r\noilskins and boots, are not considered under this head.\r\n\r\n                            CLAMMING OUTFIT.\r\n\r\n  Skiff dory,                                  $22.00\r\n  Two clam diggers,                              1.50\r\n  Four clam baskets,                             2.00\r\n                                               ------\r\n      Total,                                   $25.50\r\n\r\nThe boats most often used by the north shore clammers are called \"skiff\r\ndories,\" and in construction are between a dory and a skiff. These\r\nboats are especially adapted for use in rivers.\r\n\r\n_Marketing._--Clams are shipped to market either in the shell or\r\n\"shucked out.\" Two rules are followed by the clammers in making this\r\ndistinction: (1) small clams, or \"steamers,\" are shipped in the\r\nshell, especially during the summer months, while the large clams are\r\n\"shucked;\" (2) the fine-appearing sand clam is usually sold in the\r\nshell, while the unprepossessing mud clam is shucked, _i.e._, the\r\nshell and the external covering of the siphon or neck are removed.\r\nThis causes on the north shore a division by locality. The Ipswich and\r\nEssex clams, except for a few individual orders, are mostly shipped to\r\nmarket in the shell, while the Annisquam River and Newburyport clams\r\nare usually shucked in the winter. Little if any shucking is done by\r\nthe south shore clammers.\r\n\r\nShucking almost doubles the value, as a bushel of clams, worth in the\r\nshell 75 cents, will furnish, when soaked, about 10 quarts of shucked\r\nclams, which bring about 50 cents per gallon, or a total of $1.25 when\r\nmarketed. The shucked clams are put through a process of soaking in the\r\nsame way the scallop \"eyes\" are treated before marketing. They absorb\r\na sufficient quantity of fresh water, after soaking six hours, to\r\nincrease their bulk about one-third and give a plump appearance to the\r\nclams.\r\n\r\nWhile many clammers do not soak their clams, it seems to be a universal\r\ntendency, wherever clams are shucked, to gain by this method. Soaking\r\nof any sort impairs the flavor of the clam, and for this reason such a\r\npractice is to be deplored, but as long as the consumer is satisfied\r\nto take second-rate goods, this practice will continue, and it can be\r\nstopped only by the united demand of the shellfish dealers.\r\n\r\n_Shipment._--Second-hand flour and sugar barrels are used for the\r\nshipment of clams in the shell, while kegs and butter tubs hold the\r\nshucked clams. In winter clams can be shipped inland without perishing;\r\nbut in hot weather they will spoil in a few days, unless iced.\r\n\r\n_Maine Clams._--Massachusetts annually consumes many thousand barrels\r\nof Maine clams. If the demand of the Boston market were not partially\r\nmet by the influx of Maine clams, the clam flats of Massachusetts would\r\nbe subject to a greater drain.\r\n\r\n_Market._--The principal market for the clam industry of Massachusetts\r\nis Boston. Gloucester, Newburyport, Salem and Lynn draw part of\r\nthe clam trade of the north shore, but the greater portion goes to\r\nBoston, whence it is distributed throughout the State. In recent years\r\nshipments have been made from the Ipswich Bay region direct to New\r\nYork, Baltimore and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n_Price._--The price of clams is fairly constant, varying but little\r\nin summer and winter. Naturally, this seems curious, when winter and\r\nsummer clamming are compared. The production in winter is much smaller\r\nthan in summer, which is due to (1) fewer clammers, because of the\r\nsevere work in cold weather; (2) less working days, as the clammer\r\nis often unable to dig for weeks, and even months, and also cannot\r\nwork early or late tides, as in summer. In spite of this diminution\r\nof supply, the winter price is practically no higher. This is due to\r\na smaller demand in winter, as well as to the influx of the Maine\r\nclams at this season. In summer there is an increased demand for\r\nclams, caused by the arrival of the summer people at the seashore; and\r\nlarge quantities of this shellfish are used by hotels, cottages, etc.\r\nThis increase in demand is enough to offset the increase in supply,\r\nresulting in a stationary price.\r\n\r\nThe price varies as to the quality of the clams, whether soaked or\r\nunsoaked, small or large, good or poor looking shells, and fresh or\r\nstale. The average price as received by the clammer for clams in the\r\nshell is 75 cents per bushel; shucked clams, when soaked, 45-50 cents\r\nper gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrangement of Towns._\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiarities of the different localities, it has been\r\nimpossible to satisfactorily arrange the towns alphabetically.\r\nTherefore, in order to present local comparisons, they have been\r\narranged in geographical order, starting at the northern boundary of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salisbury._\r\n\r\nSalisbury, the most northerly town in the State, has a good clam\r\nterritory, very similar to that of Newburyport, though much smaller in\r\narea.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the clam ground, and practically all the very good digging,\r\nis comprised in a single flat, which extends along the northerly bank\r\nof the Merrimac for nearly 2 miles. This flat is about 900 feet wide,\r\non an average, and has a total area of 216 acres. On the eastern end,\r\nand skirting the channel, it is sandy; but for the most part it is mud\r\nthroughout, varying from a hard, smooth surface in the middle portion\r\nto a soft, scummy soil on the west.\r\n\r\nAbout 100 acres in the central section of this flat are covered with\r\na thick set of clams, especially from 1 to 2 inches. This territory\r\nfurnishes the bulk of the good digging, and is being constantly turned\r\nover and the larger clams sorted out. Roughly speaking, the main east\r\nhalf of the flat is sandy, or hard mud, with very good clamming, the\r\nwestern half softer mud, with fair or scattering clams. This is an\r\nexceptionally fine natural clam flat, and if properly cultivated its\r\nproduction would be immensely increased. At the eastern extremity of\r\nthe flat a long, narrow cove extends in a general northerly direction\r\ninto the main land. This cove, including the outer fringing bars,\r\ncontains some 34 acres of flats, for the most part sandy and rather\r\npoorly productive, though no considerable area is anywhere strictly\r\nbarren. The combined clam flat territory of the town aggregates\r\n250 acres, comprising 150 acres of good clamming and 100 acres of\r\nscattering clams; of these, 216 acres are of mud and 34 acres of sand.\r\n\r\nWhile the town records show 66 licensed clammers, only about 50 make\r\nclamming their chief occupation. The industry is carried on in much\r\nthe same manner as at Newburyport; $625 is invested in boats and\r\nimplements, and some 15,000 bushels of clams, aggregating $16,500, are\r\nannually produced.\r\n\r\nThe clam industry at Salisbury is largely stationary as regards\r\navailable territory, while the production varies considerably from year\r\nto year. There is little or no town legislation affecting the industry,\r\nexcept the issuing of permits by the selectmen. These permits cost 25\r\ncents, and are required from every clammer.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   66\r\n  Capital invested,                              $625\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 15,000\r\n      Value,                                  $16,500\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand                                         34\r\n      Mud,                                        216\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      250\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                              150\r\n      Scattering clams,                           100\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),          -\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                        -\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $70,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Newburyport._\r\n\r\nNewburyport is pre-eminently the clam town of Massachusetts. It\r\nproduces the most clams, gives employment to the most men, and has on\r\nthe whole the finest flats.\r\n\r\nThe total clam-growing area of this town comprises about 1,080 acres;\r\nof this, some 800 acres are more or less productive, while the balance,\r\n280 acres, is practically nonproductive. Scattering clams exist\r\neverywhere, so there are, properly speaking, no truly barren flats.\r\n\r\nThe flats of Newburyport, broad, level and continuous, are peculiarly\r\nadapted to clam culture. The general type of soil is mud, varying from\r\na soft, sticky variety on the west coast, and also along the shores\r\nof Plum Island, to a firm, hard surface in the great middle section\r\nnorth of Woodbridge's Island, where clams flourish most abundantly and\r\nfurnish the best digging within the city limits. Here nearly 100 acres\r\nare covered with a heavy set of 1 to 2 inch clams. Altogether there are\r\nsome 930 acres of this mud. Much of this, especially to the west and\r\nsouth, is apparently unfavorable to clams, being soft and unwholesome,\r\nbut even here at certain seasons clams are dug extensively.\r\n\r\nThe sand flats include the shifting Hump sands that fringe the Merrimac\r\nchannel and the Cove on Plum Island. These and other minor sections\r\ncomprise about 150 acres. The Hump sands are quite productive. The\r\nother sand flats are not entirely barren, but practically unutilized.\r\n\r\nThe clam industry at Newburyport furnishes employment for about 175\r\nmen, although over 200 depend upon it for some portion of their income.\r\nThe season lasts the year round, though on account of storms and ice\r\nthe winter's work is rather uncertain. A good fisherman will, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, dig several bushels of clams at a tide, though\r\nthe ordinary man will probably not average more than a bushel and a\r\nhalf, taking the whole year into account.\r\n\r\nThe outlay of capital invested is comparatively small. A flat-bottom\r\nboat or dory, a clam hoe or two, and three or four wire-bottom baskets,\r\nconstitute a clammer's outfit, costing altogether perhaps $15 or $20.\r\nAs two or more men frequently go in one boat, even this expenditure\r\nmay be reduced. The shore property in use, consisting of from 8 to\r\n10 shanties, is also inconsiderable. Several power boats are used,\r\nhowever, and their added cost brings the aggregate money invested up to\r\nabout $2,700.\r\n\r\nThe flats of Newburyport are a large factor in its economic wealth.\r\nDuring 1907 they produced nearly 55,500 bushels of clams, exceeding\r\n$61,000 in value. Nearly two-thirds of these clams were shucked, that\r\nis, removed from the shell and sold by the gallon. In this form,\r\nusually soaked to increase their volume, they retail for about 45\r\ncents per gallon. As clams in the shell, sold for \"steamers,\" etc.,\r\nwill hardly bring more than 65 cents per bushel, the process of\r\nshucking nearly doubles the value to the fisherman, as a bushel of\r\nclams in the shell will produce from 2 to 3 gallons of soaked clams.\r\nThe income of the average clammer will hardly exceed $350 per year, but\r\na really energetic and industrious fisherman may in the same time make\r\nfrom $500 to $700, or even more. Many of the men have individual orders\r\nfrom dealers in Lynn, Haverhill and the neighboring cities, while the\r\nlocal dealers ship largely to Boston.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the industry by city ordinance is of very little\r\nnote. Practically the only legislation pertaining to it is the law\r\nwhich requires every clammer to have a permit, but even this regulation\r\nis but indifferently enforced. The Newbury flats are likewise free to\r\nthe Newburyport clammers, and part of the Newburyport production comes\r\nfrom these outside flats.\r\n\r\nThe history of the clam industry at Newburyport is one of constant\r\nchange. Twenty years ago large areas on southwest Joppa were\r\npractically barren; now they are quite productive. The reverse is true\r\nof Ball's flat on Plum Island, which, though once of great importance,\r\nis now almost waste. Though no serious inroads have as yet been made, a\r\nslow but steady decline in the industry is distinctly noticeable.\r\n\r\n       COMPARISON OF 1907 WITH 1879 (SALISBURY AND NEWBURYPORT).\r\n\r\n  =======+============+=========+======+==========+==========\r\n         |            |         |      |          |\r\n   YEAR. | Production |  Value. | Men. | Capital. |  Price\r\n         | (Bushels). |         |      |          |   per\r\n         |            |         |      |          | Bushel.\r\n  =======+============+=========+======+==========+==========\r\n         |            |         |      |          |\r\n   1879, |   28,800   | $11,520 |   60 |   $750   |  $0.40\r\n         |            |         |      |          |\r\n   1907, |   70,500   |  77,500 |  241 |  3,325   |  1.10\r\n  =======+============+=========+======+==========+==========\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                  175\r\n  Capital invested,                            $2,700\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 55,500\r\n      Value,                                  $61,000\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       150\r\n      Mud,                                        930\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                    1,080\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                              800\r\n      Scattering clams,                           280\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),          -\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                        -\r\n  Possible normal production,                $250,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Newbury._\r\n\r\nThe town of Newbury has in itself no shellfish industry, although\r\nthere is an extensive area of suitable flats which are worked with\r\nequal rights by the Newburyport clammers. These flats comprise some\r\n360 acres, and extend along both sides of Plum Island Sound and\r\nParker River. Over 100 acres of scattering clams occur, though not\r\nin sufficient quantities for the most part to make very profitable\r\ndigging. The remainder, some 260 acres, though almost all suitable for\r\nthe production of large quantities of clams, is practically barren.\r\n\r\nThe principal type of soil is mud, and the mud flats comprise about\r\n250 acres. The flats of Parker River and those in its immediate\r\nneighborhood, however, are largely sand, and altogether they aggregate\r\nabout 110 acres. Of these, \"the thoroughfare\" is practically the only\r\none which furnishes clams in any quantity. Sections of the broad\r\nflats which border on Plum Island Sound produce scattering clams of\r\nlarge size. There is, however, no very good digging in town, and no\r\nconsistent effort seems ever to have been made to utilize the great\r\nwealth which lies dormant in the clam flat territory. Six Newbury\r\nmen dig intermittently in the summer, and furnish some 300 bushels,\r\nworth about $250, for town trade. However, this does not take into\r\nconsideration the amount taken from these flats by the Newburyport\r\nclammers.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    6\r\n  Capital invested,                               $75\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    300\r\n      Value,                                     $250\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       110\r\n      Mud,                                        250\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      360\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                -\r\n      Scattering clams,                           100\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        260\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                        -\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $40,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rowley._\r\n\r\nRowley presents a more striking example of the decline in the shellfish\r\nindustry than any other town in this region.\r\n\r\nFour hundred acres of good flats border Plum Island and Rowley River\r\nwithin the town limits, but of these only 20 at most are economically\r\nproductive. Eighty acres more are not entirely barren, though\r\npractically worthless, while the remaining 300, though almost all well\r\nadapted for clam culture, are barren.\r\n\r\nThe main type of soil is sand, and the sand flats, for the most part\r\nin Plum Island Sound, comprise some 250 acres. The remainder, 150\r\nacres, is mostly mud in scattered sections along the Rowley River and\r\nin patches on the main flats. The only really productive flats are\r\nthe little coves and creeks of Rowley River and the Knob Reefs in\r\nPlum Island Sound. The Knob Reef clam grounds produce very large and\r\nfine clams, which lie on the lower edge of the flat and are exposed\r\nonly a short time every tide. Knob Reefs also has the distinction of\r\npossessing probably the finest clam set of its size in the State, which\r\nwould furnish abundant opportunity for restocking all the barren Rowley\r\nRiver flats, if the town authorities had taken proper measures to\r\ntransplant this seed. As it is, this extensive set, too thick for good\r\ngrowth, is rapidly wasting away.\r\n\r\nThe history of the industry is one of steady decline. Reliable evidence\r\nexists to show that almost all the flats of Rowley once produced clams,\r\nand that large areas now waste were formerly productive. That these\r\nimmense barren areas, possessing such an enormous latent wealth, should\r\nbe allowed to remain thus unimproved, is a most conclusive argument for\r\nthe need of radical action. No settled attempt, however, except for a\r\nsingle closed season in 1906, has ever been made by the clammers or\r\ntown authorities to better the conditions, or to check the decline in\r\nthe productive territory that remains.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   15\r\n  Capital invested,                              $800\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  2,000\r\n      Value,                                   $1,500\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       250\r\n      Mud,                                        150\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      400\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               20\r\n      Scattering clams,                            80\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        300\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                        -\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $60,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ipswich._\r\n\r\nIpswich is second only to Newburyport in the production of clams,\r\nand has perhaps even greater possibilities of development. The\r\nclam territory of the two towns, while nearly equal in extent, is,\r\nhowever, markedly different in general characteristics. The flats\r\nof Newburyport, while few in number, are broad, continuous, and have\r\na great degree of similarity throughout. The flats of Ipswich, on\r\nthe other hand, are divided into a great number of relatively small\r\nsections, widely diversified in character, and scattered along an\r\nextensive coast line. As these flats are in many respects the most\r\ninteresting and important of any town in the State, it seems well to\r\nexamine them in detail.\r\n\r\nFour distinct divisions can be distinguished in the clam territory of\r\nthis town: Ipswich River, Plum Island, Green's Creek and Roger Island,\r\nand Essex River flats.\r\n\r\nTaken in the order named, the Ipswich River has in itself a great\r\nvariety of clam ground. Both sides of the river for nearly 3 miles are\r\nfringed with bars, mainly of mud though sandy near the mouth. Some of\r\nthe mud flats are so soft that they are practically barren, or given up\r\nlargely to mussel beds; while much of the sand, as, _e.g._, the main\r\nportion of the High Sands, is too shifting to be valuable. The larger\r\npart of these river flats are, however, productive.\r\n\r\nThe Plum Island division comprises Lufkins, Point Peter, Appletons,\r\nForesides and several other minor flats. Of these, Lufkins is very\r\nimportant. It occupies a semicircular depression on the coast of Plum\r\nIsland, and, owing to its peculiar location, the swift current which\r\nflows past its outer edge makes a double eddy at both ebb and flood\r\ntide. These eddies sweep gently over its broad surface, and deposit a\r\nfine silt which has made the characteristic soil a hard, bluish clay.\r\nThis is the only important clay flat of this region. The total area of\r\nLufkins is 46 acres. The outer border to the north is mud, becoming\r\nsoft; to the south, sandy. The portion near shore is, as has been\r\nstated, a clayey soil, and it is here that clams are found abundantly.\r\nAn exceptionally good set of 1 to 2 inch clams occupies from 3 to\r\n4 acres of this portion. Though clams are numerous, the exceeding\r\nhardness of the soil makes digging rather difficult.\r\n\r\nPoint Peter, or \"P'int\" Peter, is also an important flat, comprising\r\naltogether 28 acres, though about 7 acres of the outer portion extend\r\nfar into the current, and are of so shifting and sandy a nature as to\r\nbe practically worthless. Most of the remainder is mud, varying from\r\nsand and hard mud on the outside to soft mud in the creeks that lead\r\ninto the main land. The central portion of the flat is peculiarly\r\nadapted to the culture of clams, however, and is very productive.\r\n\r\nAppleton's flat comprises about 6 acres of hard sand, verging into mud,\r\nthickly strewn with old clam shells. It lies at the mouth of Perkins\r\nand Pine Creeks, which run for about a mile into the main land of Plum\r\nIsland, and contain nearly 25 acres each of fairly productive mud\r\nflats. Appleton's is a valuable flat, and the clams dug here are large.\r\n\r\nThe Foresides is a thatch island a little over a mile in length, lying\r\nin the mid channel of Plum Island Sound. The flats which surround it\r\non all sides are practically all sand, and comprise about 80 acres.\r\nThe whole western side is more or less productive, though the outer\r\nedge, where the strong cross currents of the channel sweep over, is too\r\nmuch rippled to be suitable for clam growth. The strip of sand along\r\nthe northern and northeastern sides, though rather narrow and limited\r\nin area, is productive, while most of the southeastern portion, which\r\nprojects far into the channel, is barren and totally unadapted for soft\r\nclams, though bedded with sea clams. The productive sections of this\r\nflat are much dug, and altogether it is one of the most important of\r\nthe Ipswich clam grounds.\r\n\r\nThe west coast of Plum Island Sound, comprising the Green's Creek\r\nand Roger Island territories, extends from the Ipswich to the Rowley\r\nrivers. This division contains the bulk of the waste and barren flats\r\nof the town, although there is exceptionally good clamming in Stacy's\r\nCreek, Third Creek and the \"Nutfield.\"\r\n\r\nThe Essex River region is rather remote for most of the clammers,\r\nand hard to reach, but furnishes on the whole some of the very best\r\ndigging. The three main flats of this division are the Essex beach,\r\nWheeler's, and the Spit. Essex beach has a very good set, evenly\r\nsprinkled over the ridgy, shifting bars that skirt the channel.\r\n\r\nWheeler's is an irregular sand bar, occupying about 77 acres. Fully\r\none-half of this is very productive, and in the main portion occurs\r\nanother thick set very similar to that on Essex beach.\r\n\r\nThe Spit, mainly sand or sandy mud, lies in the three towns of Ipswich,\r\nEssex and Gloucester. The whole area is some 300 acres, about a third\r\nlying within the town of Ipswich. This whole bar is so liable to\r\nchange that any calculations based on its precise area or location are\r\ndecidedly unreliable. Very good digging occurs, however, in limited\r\nareas on the north and west sides of the Ipswich territory.\r\n\r\nThese four divisions comprise the clamming territory of Ipswich, and\r\naggregate 970 acres, of which 390 acres is sand and 500 mud. This also\r\nincludes 15 acres of mussels scattered along Ipswich River, Plum Island\r\nand Green's Creek region, and about 10 acres of eel grass in various\r\nlocalities. Over 800 acres is more or less productive, about half being\r\ngood clamming.\r\n\r\nAbout 50 regular clammers depend upon these flats for a living,\r\nthough 136 permits were issued in 1907. Here, owing to the greater\r\ndistances to be traversed, many power boats are used. Nearly $7,500 is\r\ninvested in the industry, and 25,000 bushels of clams, at a valuation\r\nof $18,750, are annually produced. The relative decrease in price as\r\ncompared with Newburyport is due to the fact that shucking is not so\r\nextensively practised here.\r\n\r\nThe town laws merely require a permit from every clammer, for which\r\nno charge is made. Such permit is issued at the discretion of the\r\nselectmen, and requires of the recipient six months' residence in the\r\ntown and two years in the State. In past years the town has made\r\nseveral by-laws for the protection of shellfish, chiefly in the nature\r\nof partial closed seasons; but unfortunately considerable difficulty\r\nhas been found in enforcing these excellent laws, and the results have\r\nbeen far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIpswich has jealously guarded the rights of its clam flats, and has\r\nprotected them in every way from the invasion of outsiders, which in\r\npart accounts for the excellent condition of these flats, which were\r\noriginally deeded to the Commoners by the Crown, and from them to the\r\ntown. Ipswich is the only town in the Commonwealth which has thus\r\ndirectly received its clam flats as its own property, and naturally has\r\ndone more to improve its natural clam resources than any other town in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThe history of the industry shows little change; some few flats once\r\nconsidered worthless have been opened and utilized; others once\r\nproductive have been dug out and allowed to become waste. On the whole,\r\nthe industry is following the trend of the shellfisheries everywhere,\r\nand slowly but steadily declining.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                  136\r\n  Capital invested,                            $7,500\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 25,000\r\n      Value,                                  $18,750\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       390\r\n      Mud,                                        500\r\n      Gravel,                                      55\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                       25\r\n      Total,                                      970\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                              400\r\n      Scattering clams,                           420\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        125\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       25\r\n  Possible normal production,                $200,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Essex._\r\n\r\nEssex, while still ranking as an important clam-producing town, has\r\na very imperfect development of her shellfish resources. The total\r\nclam flat area comprises some 650 acres, and, though scarcely more\r\nthan 25 acres can be considered as unfit for the growth of clams, and\r\nconsequently barren, only a little more than half the remainder is\r\nat all productive, and of this probably less than 150 acres yields\r\nany financial return. In other words, 325 acres of good clam flat is\r\nallowed to remain practically barren.\r\n\r\nThe main type of soil is sand, and nearly 500 acres may be properly\r\nclassed under this head. The remaining 150 acres are mud, and are\r\nlocated in the creeks along the river and in the coves north of Hog\r\nIsland. The productive sections are scattered for the most part along\r\nboth sides of the Essex River, and well-developed areas are also\r\nfound at its mouth and on the Spit. There are several good locations\r\nof seed clams. One section of about 25 acres occurs on the west side\r\nof the Spit. This is composed of 1 to 2 inch clams, running 10 to 40\r\nper square foot. At the mouth of the river on the north side occurs\r\nanother set of ½-inch clams, covering about 10 acres. On the flats west\r\nof Cross Island is found a third set of ½ to 2 inch clams, comprising\r\nabout 30 acres. Other smaller patches of set are scattered along the\r\nriver almost up to its source.\r\n\r\nAbout 50 men derive an income from these flats. Some $1,200 is\r\ninvested, and the annual product exceeds 15,000 bushels, valued at\r\n$12,750.\r\n\r\nThe town of Essex has realized the importance of the clam problem, and\r\nhas attempted through legislation to deal with it. The selectmen are\r\nempowered to grant to citizens of the town an area consisting of an\r\nacre or less on flats already barren, for the purpose of raising clams,\r\nand in this manner partially restock the flats. A rental of $2 is\r\ncharged, covering a period of five years, and an additional fee of 50\r\ncents is required for recording. In spite of inadequate protection, the\r\nexperiment has been conducted long enough to prove that these flats can\r\nbe made profitable to the clammers.\r\n\r\nThe history of the clam industry at Essex is one of extensive decline.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the greater part at least of the\r\nwaste area was once very productive. Prof. James L. Kellogg in the\r\nUnited States Fish Commission Bulletin for 1899, says:--\r\n\r\n    We have much evidence that the clam industry in Essex has,\r\n    in the past, been extensive.... Much more testimony of a\r\n    similar character may be had to show that the flats once very\r\n    productive have almost entirely failed.\r\n\r\n                     COMPARISON OF 1907 WITH 1879.\r\n\r\n  ======================+========+========\r\n                        |        |\r\n                        | 1879.  |  1907.\r\n  ----------------------+--------+--------\r\n  Production (bushels), |    500 |  15,000\r\n  Value,                | $4,500 | $12,750\r\n  Men,                  |     75 |      50\r\n  Capital,              |      - |  $1,200\r\n  Price (cents),        |     40 |      85\r\n  ======================+========+=========\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   50\r\n  Capital invested,                            $1,200\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                 15,000\r\n      Value,                                  $12,750\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       500\r\n      Mud,                                        125\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                       25\r\n      Total,                                      650\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                              150\r\n      Scattering clams,                           150\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        325\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       25\r\n  Possible normal production,                $120,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gloucester._\r\n\r\nThe far-celebrated deep sea fisheries of Gloucester overshadow her\r\nhumble shellfish industry; but within her tidal flats lie undeveloped\r\nresources, which if properly brought out would form no inconsiderable\r\nfactor in her annual revenue. Even now her clam fishery attains\r\nconsiderable proportions, though by no means what it once was, or what\r\nit might be were suitable cultural methods employed.\r\n\r\nThe main areas of clam-producing territory lie in the Annisquam River\r\nand in the Essex River in West Gloucester. The grounds in the Annisquam\r\nare the more productive. This river is some 4 miles long, and is\r\nbordered for the greater part of this distance with tidal flats. Of\r\nthese the sand flats predominate, though there are large areas of mud\r\nand extensive beds of mussels. On the extreme head of the river, known\r\nas the Dumfudgeon region, dredging operations for the Gloucester canal\r\nhave somewhat impaired the flats, but as a whole the river seems in\r\nevery way suitable for the production of an abundant harvest of clams.\r\n\r\nThe flats of West Gloucester, including a portion of the Essex Spit,\r\nare largely unproductive. The Spit is the only flat of any extent in\r\nthis region which is at present of real economic value; the remaining\r\nflats, scattered along the south shore of the Essex River and its\r\ntributary creeks, are for the most part practically barren.\r\n\r\nThe total area of clam flats in Gloucester approximates 550 acres. Of\r\nthis, some 250 acres are sand, 200 mud, while there are about 100 acres\r\nof mussels and eel grass, which cannot be considered at all adapted for\r\nclam culture. Only a fraction of the whole, 75 acres, more or less, is\r\ngood clamming; a scant 100 acres produces scattering clams; 275 acres\r\nare barren, though capable of producing clams; while 100 acres may\r\nnever be made productive.\r\n\r\nEight men dig regularly on these flats the year round, and 23 others\r\nwork intermittently. The capital invested amounts to over $600, and\r\nthe annual output exceeds 6,000 bushels, valued at $8,000. Most of the\r\nclams produced at Gloucester are shucked either for market or bait.\r\n\r\nLocal legislation has no bearing on the shellfish question, and no\r\neffort is being made either to better conditions in the clam industry\r\nor to check its steady decline.\r\n\r\nThe industry has fallen off greatly in the past few years.

The area of tidal flats,\r\ncomprising nearly 50 acres, is at present unprofitable and nearly\r\nworthless. As at Swampscott, some clams still continue to be dug\r\nfor bait and for local clam bakes, but any evidence of a systematic\r\nbusiness has long ceased to exist. Thirty years ago clams were far\r\nmore abundant, though there was never an extensive industry.

Seven men are at\r\npresent employed in digging the harbor flats, where the clams have\r\nvery recently seeded in. Many of these clams, though rather small, are\r\nshucked, and the remainder are sold in the local markets. The entire\r\nvalue of the annual production does not exceed $200, and the capital\r\ninvested amounts to but $75. This is rather poor showing for 100 acres\r\nof flats for the most part comparatively good, and capable of yielding\r\n$11,000 annually.

Its clam grounds could, if properly utilized,\r\nyield a great increase over their present inconsiderable return.\r\nNo legislation on the part of the city authorities has intervened\r\nto improve the shellfish production or to prevent the depletion of\r\nvaluable territory which has been allowed to gradually lapse into an\r\nunsanitary desert. While at low tide about 400 acres of flats spread\r\nover the broad harbor or border the banks of the Saugus River, but 40\r\nacres of this wide expanse yield any appreciable revenue. The principal\r\npart of the digging is done on the mud flats of the Saugus River. Here\r\n7 fishermen work intermittently to supply the local market during the\r\nsummer months. There is some good territory at the mouth of the river\r\ntoward the north, and scattering clams occur along the eastern shores,\r\nbut the main flats of the harbor are for the most part barren.\r\n\r\nThe deposit of sewage from the city drainage has undoubtedly had a\r\nprejudicial effect on much of this area, as the unpleasing scum which\r\ncovers the soft, sticky mud and eel grass bears abundant witness.\r\nWhether measures undertaken to reclaim this lost area would in the long\r\nrun yield profitable returns is an undecided question, but much might\r\nbe done, by the employment of judicious cultural methods, to increase\r\nthe yield of those flats which are properly productive. No exact\r\nreturns of the annual clam harvest for this region are obtainable, as\r\nmost of the output is disposed of at retail, but it cannot exceed 1,000\r\nbushels, and probably falls far short of that figure; $1,000, then, or\r\nthereabouts, represents the total monetary income from this fishery.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    7\r\n  Capital invested,                              $100\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,000\r\n      Value,                                   $1,000\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                        90\r\n      Mud,                                        300\r\n      Gravel,                                       5\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        5\r\n      Total,                                      400\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               10\r\n      Scattering clams,                            30\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        160\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                      200\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $26,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saugus._\r\n\r\nAt Saugus conditions in many respects parallel those at Lynn. The clam\r\ngrounds, while they by no means equal those of the neighboring city in\r\narea, are on the whole better, as they are freer from contaminating\r\nsewage. Of the 250 acres which comprise the normal tide flat area, only\r\n100 acres, or 40 per cent., can be said to be strictly barren. The\r\nremaining 150 acres is an undeveloped asset, as its value lies far more\r\nin its prospects than in its present productivity. While scattering\r\nclams occur throughout, no more than 25 acres can be accounted paying\r\nproperty. This remunerative territory lies chiefly in the Saugus River\r\nand in the vicinity of the Point of Pines. Here 10 men dig quite\r\nregularly, particularly in the summer, though none of them depend\r\nwholly upon this source of revenue for a livelihood. The annual output\r\nequals that of Lynn, both in amount and valuation. To these flats, with\r\ntheir undeveloped resources, local legislation gives practically no\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   10\r\n  Capital invested,                              $100\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  1,000\r\n      Value,                                   $1,000\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       100\r\n      Mud,                                        150\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      250\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               10\r\n      Scattering clams,                            40\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        100\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                      100\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $22,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nahant._\r\n\r\nAlthough Nahant has a large area of tidal flats, it is not on the\r\nwhole favorably located, and much that would otherwise be available is\r\nnecessarily waste. The territory which borders the western coast is not\r\nbarren, but most of it is not productive enough to be profitable.\r\n\r\nA few scattered sections repay the clammer for his labor, and from\r\nthese sections perhaps 300 bushels a year are dug for home consumption.\r\nFour or five men are employed at intervals in the summer months, but no\r\none of them depends upon this source of income for more than transient\r\nemployment, as the entire value of the yearly harvest does not exceed\r\n$300. As there are nearly 250 acres of flats in Nahant, this would be a\r\nrevenue of $1.60 per acre, on an average. However, this is not a fair\r\ncomparison, for much of the territory apparently available is, as has\r\nbeen stated, properly waste. Nevertheless, an industry of far greater\r\nproportions than at present could be attained if wise legislation were\r\ndirected to that end.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    -\r\n  Capital invested,                                 -\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    300\r\n      Value,                                     $300\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                        50\r\n      Mud,                                        100\r\n      Gravel,                                     100\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      250\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                -\r\n      Scattering clams,                            50\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        150\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       50\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $25,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boston Harbor._\r\n\r\nOwing to the danger arising from sewage contamination the State Board\r\nof Health, on Dec. 6, 1906, requested the Department of Fisheries and\r\nGame to prohibit the digging of clams for market in Boston harbor.\r\nThe region closed by this law lies to the west of an imaginary line\r\nrunning from Point Shirley through Deer Island to the northeastern end\r\nof Peddocks Island; thence in a southwesterly direction to the extreme\r\npoint of Hough's Neck. This territory includes Winthrop, Chelsea,\r\nCharlestown, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, East Boston,\r\nSouth Boston, Dorchester, Neponset and Quincy. For convenience all the\r\nprescribed territory is treated under the head of \"Boston harbor.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of the State Board of Health in closing Boston harbor was\r\nnecessitated by a due regard for the public health, as it seemed\r\ninexpedient to allow clams dug from this territory and subject to\r\nsewage contamination to be marketed for food. Necessary as this act\r\nmay have been, the closing of 5,000 acres of flats for the production\r\nof edible shellfish made valueless an important source of revenue, and\r\nthrew a large number of clammers out of employment. Some alleviation\r\nof these conditions has resulted through the granting of permits to\r\ntake shellfish for bait from the prescribed waters, thus furnishing a\r\nnumber of men with transient employment. The value of the law, however,\r\nis almost completely nullified, for the danger to the public health is\r\nactual, and not imaginary. Under present conditions it is well-nigh\r\nimpossible to make the necessary surveillance so complete as would be\r\nnecessary to prove that clams \"dug for bait\" are not used as food.\r\nFurther, even in the digging and handling of shellfish in polluted\r\nwaters there is positive danger of transmitting the germs by hands of\r\nthe digger to his own mouth or to other persons.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the flats permit the division of Boston harbor into three\r\nsections: (1) the north shore, (2) the south shore, (3) and the islands.\r\n\r\n(1) The northern coast of the harbor has extensive mud and sand flats,\r\ncovered for the most part with eel grass or scattered mussel beds. Much\r\nof the surface is a variety of pebbly gravel, while but little of it\r\nappears to be good clam ground. The mud flats are mostly covered with a\r\nsewage scum which renders them unsuitable for clams. Scattering clams\r\nare found throughout the entire region.\r\n\r\nThe immediate vicinity of Snake Island in Winthrop and the cove on\r\nPoint Shirley furnish fairly good clamming, while clams are found in a\r\ngreater or less degree upon the extensive flats of Winthrop harbor.\r\nThe flats of the Mystic River, which are of a tenacious mud rather\r\nunwholesome in appearance, in so far as they have not been encroached\r\nupon for building purposes, possess scattered patches of very good\r\ndigging, and furnish transient employment to 20 or more men. The flats\r\nin the Charles and Chelsea rivers likewise furnish fair clamming.\r\n\r\n(2) The south shore of the harbor is much like the north, except that\r\nthe mud type of soil predominates. The large flats, mainly mud, are not\r\nentirely barren though most of the clams are found in a narrow strip\r\nof beach along the shore. At South Boston as well as in Dorchester Bay\r\nclams are found in considerable numbers, though nowhere are there any\r\nlarge areas of good clamming.\r\n\r\n(3) The islands in the harbor are fringed with pebbly beach, where\r\nscattering clams are usually found. Apple Island and Governor's Island\r\nare surrounded with quite extensive flats, which are, however, but\r\nsparsely productive. Much digging for bait is carried on constantly on\r\nthese pebbly beaches.\r\n\r\n_History._--Boston harbor has been in the past a good clamming region,\r\nas the magnitude of its available flats has rendered possible an\r\nextensive production. Naturally, the closing of the harbor by the State\r\nBoard of Health has limited the annual production of clams from this\r\nvicinity, as now the only legal digging is for bait. Owing to this\r\npartial closed season the clams are said to have been on the increase\r\nduring the last two years. Nevertheless, before the passage of this\r\nact the fishery had already greatly declined. The decline of the clam\r\nindustry has been going on for years, as even in 1879 Mr. Ernest\r\nIngersoll mentions:--\r\n\r\n    In Boston harbor clams are much depleted, owing to the fact\r\n    that they are remorselessly dug the year through, chiefly by\r\n    a class of ignorant foreigners who go down the harbor for the\r\n    purpose. July and August are the most productive months, there\r\n    being a large demand for the \"clam bakes\" which picnic parties\r\n    from the cities indulge in on the various beaches. All the\r\n    clams got in Boston harbor are very small, because they are\r\n    allowed little chance to grow; in March and April they are\r\n    hardly worth eating.\r\n\r\n                         COMPARISON WITH 1879.\r\n\r\n                                1897.     1907.\r\n  Number of men,                   90       350\r\n  Annual production:--\r\n      Bushels,                 40,000     7,500\r\n      Value,                  $20,000    $6,000\r\n  Number of dories,                50         -\r\n  Capital invested,            $1,350    $2,250\r\n\r\nIn 1879 A.

The clamming territory is confined for the most part to this\r\nnarrow strip fringing the shore, though scattering clams are found in\r\ndiminished numbers on the mud flats.\r\n\r\nThe shellfish industry of the town consists mostly in procuring clams,\r\nmussels and cockles for bait.

The region immediately about White Head and the territory\r\nopposite extending along Barson's beach are the most productive, while\r\nscattering clams are found in Little Harbor.\r\n\r\nThe total acreage of available flat exceeds 100 acres. Of this, 90\r\nacres are wholly unproductive, and the remainder, 10 acres, is not very\r\nvaluable. The main type of soil is sand, though areas of mud are found\r\nin the coves. There are no regular clammers, though many clams are dug\r\nby the citizens of the town for their own use. There has never been a\r\nclam industry worthy of the name at Cohasset, and the present state of\r\napathy appears to be normal.

The town has considerable natural advantages, since\r\nthe North River, which formerly made a wide sweep to the south before\r\nemptying into the ocean, has opened a new channel within the last ten\r\nyears, forming many acres of excellent clam ground. A close season is\r\nmaintained, although there has been considerable discontent on the part\r\nof certain individuals relative to this policy of the selectmen. A\r\nconsiderable quantity of clams, probably not exceeding 200 bushels per\r\nannum, are dug for home consumption.

A vast extent of tidal\r\nflats, far exceeding in area those of any other town in the State, and\r\nin a measure suitable for the production of clams, lie almost wholly\r\nbarren. The enormous territory comprised in these flats exceeds 3,500\r\nacres, or, roughly, 5½ square miles. This is greater than the combined\r\nclam area of Salisbury, Newburyport, Ipswich, Essex and Gloucester,\r\nwhich is the finest territory in the State, and produces most of the\r\nMassachusetts clams. Duxbury, with a greater area than all these towns,\r\ndug in 1907 about 700 bushels of clams,--an amount which could well\r\nhave been produced from 2 acres of ground. An investigation into the\r\nhistory of the town shows us that this state of barrenness has not\r\nalways existed. There was a time when Duxbury was justly celebrated for\r\nher shellfish, as is still shown by the allusions to Duxbury clams on\r\nthe menus of many hotels and restaurants. The dealers at Taunton, Fall\r\nRiver and other Massachusetts cities formerly sent to Duxbury large\r\norders for clams, which were always forthcoming. Now, as far as can be\r\nascertained, not a single barrel is shipped out of the town from year\r\nto year.\r\n\r\nThis transition from a state of prosperity to one of almost total\r\nbarrenness is replete with interest, and is difficult of solution.\r\nDoubtless several causes may have contributed to this general decline.\r\nIn the first place, it is evident that the Duxbury flats were never in\r\nso flourishing a state of production as those of the Cape Ann district.\r\nThis assumption is amply supported by historical records, and it is\r\nalso supplemented, at least, by the fact that a great per cent. of the\r\npresent territory is largely unfit for the production of clams in any\r\nquantity. As these flats have changed scarcely at all for many years,\r\nis it unreasonable to suppose that they ever have been very suitable\r\nsince the first settlement of the country?\r\n\r\nAs for the historical records referred to, the weight of evidence\r\neverywhere tends to prove that many years ago there was a fairly large\r\noutput of clams yearly from Duxbury. But while this output was large\r\nin itself, it was, in proportion to the possible area, exceedingly\r\nsmall. Mr. Ernest Ingersoll states that in 1879 there were yearly\r\nexported from Duxbury 5,000 bushels of clams. At that time, he says,\r\nthe industry had declined. Clamming was then prosecuted with no such\r\nvigor as at the present time, for the price was low, and the demand,\r\nexcept for bait, by no means excessive. Clams had not yet come to be\r\nlooked on as such important articles of food as at present, and the\r\nbusiness of digging them as carried on then could have made little\r\ninroad on well-stocked flats. The great probability is that only a\r\nsmall percentage of the whole territory was ever very productive. An\r\nobserver at the present time, viewing from an eminence the flats of\r\nDuxbury at low tide, could not help being struck with the singular\r\nappearance which they present. He would see spread out before him a\r\nbroad expanse apparently of green meadows, with long, narrow streams of\r\nwater winding in and out among them. These seeming meadows, stretching\r\non mile after mile, broken here and there by a patch of clear sand, are\r\nthe tidal flats of Duxbury, more than 2,700 acres of which are covered\r\nwith a thick growth of eel grass.\r\n\r\nHow many years this eel grass has covered the flats no one knows. It\r\nshifts somewhat, as the ice in winter sometimes plows up an immense\r\nsurface, stripping it of its green covering. For the most part it seems\r\nto grow steadily year after year, until the roots, decaying stalks and\r\nthe fine sediment which they have collected build up a spongy crust\r\nover the true bed of the flat. It is this spongy, clayey soil which is\r\nthe predominant type in the eel-grass region, though a large area is\r\nsoft mud with little patches of hard sand. It does not seem surprising\r\nthat clams are not abundant in this soggy medium, covered with its\r\nthick matting of grass. Clams do exist, however, for occasionally when\r\nthe ice in the winter storms has scraped bare a section of these flats,\r\nscattering large clams can be found.\r\n\r\nWhether anything can be done with these eel-grass flats on a\r\nsufficiently large scale to render the undertaking profitable, and\r\nwhether they would prove good ground for clam culture if the eel grass\r\nwere removed, is a problem. However, the sand flats free from eel grass\r\ncomprise nearly 800 acres,--an area sufficient in itself to furnish a\r\nvery large industry for the town. Smooth, hard and unshifting, they\r\nhave the appearance of being in every way suitable for the production\r\nof an enormous amount of shellfish. Yet, barring cockles, mussels and\r\nrazor clams, shellfish are rare on most of these flats, which, in spite\r\nof their inviting appearance, are practically barren.\r\n\r\nThe only places where clams are dug in any quantity is along the shore.\r\nHere little scattered patches, remnants perhaps of the former large\r\nsupply, repay the clammer's toil with a scant return. Little or no\r\neffort is made to dig them on the main flats, and few are so dug unless\r\nthey happen to be unearthed by accident when the men are searching\r\nfor razor clams for bait. The supply is hardly adequate for home\r\nconsumption and the demands for bait by local fishermen.\r\n\r\nWhether all the great tidal territory of Duxbury can ever be\r\nreconstructed into profitable clam ground is a difficult question.\r\nThere exist, however, no known reasons why a fishery at least as\r\nflourishing as that of twenty years ago could not be re-established\r\nand indefinitely developed. A great industry was once in evidence\r\nhere. Outside the boggy eel-grass marshes (doubtful territory at best)\r\nare wide expanses of clean sand flats, suitable in every way for the\r\ncultivation of clams. That the ingenuity of man properly administered\r\ncan build up an enormous industry on these sand flats alone, no\r\nthoughtful person can doubt, and then utilization of these great barren\r\nDuxbury wastes will partially, at least, be accomplished.\r\n\r\n                     COMPARISON OF 1907 WITH 1879.\r\n\r\n  ======+============+=========\r\n  YEAR. | Production | Value.\r\n        | (Bushels). |\r\n  ------+------------+---------\r\n  1879, |   5,000    | $2,500\r\n  1907, |     700    |    600\r\n  ======+============+=========\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    5\r\n  Capital invested,                               $60\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    700\r\n      Value,                                     $600\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       800\r\n      Mud,                                          -\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                    2,700\r\n      Total,                                    3,500\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                5\r\n      Scattering clams,                            10\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        800\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                    2,685\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $83,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kingston._\r\n\r\nThe condition of the clam industry at Kingston is in many respects\r\nparallel to that at Duxbury. The clam flat area (some 600 acres) is\r\nvery much smaller, but the character of the soil is essentially the\r\nsame, consisting for the most part of clay, soft mud and eel-grass\r\nmarshes, with a relatively small proportion of really suitable ground.\r\n\r\nThe two main flats of the town are Egobert's and Gray's. Egobert's,\r\nthe larger of the two, has an area of about 275 acres. Most of this\r\nis practically waste, owing to a thick growth of eel grass; but a\r\ntriangular piece on the mid-southern section is bare. This portion of\r\nsmooth, unshifting sand comprises about 80 acres. A few patches of\r\nclams are scattered along the outer edge, near the channel, but hardly\r\nany of these patches produce clams enough to make it profitable to dig\r\nthem. The great bulk of this territory is entirely barren.\r\n\r\nGray's flat is of an entirely different type. It is a long flat, with\r\na fairly uniform width of about 100 yards. It runs through its entire\r\nlength parallel to the shore, while on the other side it is separated\r\nfrom Egobert's by a 300-foot channel. Like Egobert's, it is covered\r\nfor the most part by eel grass, but it is essentially different in\r\nthe nature of its soil, which is mud throughout. Although the total\r\narea of the flat is about 115 acres, an irregular section of bare mud\r\non the southeastern side, comprising 30 acres, is the only available\r\nclam territory. This section is composed of soft mud on the north and\r\nsouth, rather poorly suited for clam culture; but the mid section\r\ncontains several acres of hard mud, which seems well adapted, and here\r\nclams are found in sufficient quantities to keep several men digging\r\nintermittently through the summer months.\r\n\r\nAlong the shore a few clam grants have been given to individuals by\r\nthe local authorities. These are managed with fair success, though no\r\nbusiness other than that of supplying the local demand is carried on.\r\nThe possibilities of forming a clam industry here of importance is\r\nevident, though through lack of available territory it could never give\r\npromise of such a development as might be looked for from Duxbury or\r\nPlymouth.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    4\r\n  Capital invested,                               $50\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    500\r\n      Value,                                     $450\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       150\r\n      Mud,                                          -\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                      450\r\n      Total,                                      600\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                5\r\n      Scattering clams,                             5\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        150\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                      440\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $18,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plymouth._\r\n\r\nThe clam industry at Plymouth is at a low ebb. The same problems which\r\nbaffle progress at Duxbury and Kingston are present here with all\r\ntheir complications. The combined available territory, exceeding 1,600\r\nacres, save for a few unimportant sections, is wholly barren. While it\r\nis true that fully two-thirds of this great area is eel-grass waste,\r\nand in its present state of little value for the production of clams,\r\nthere remains over 500 acres of good flats, for the most part sand\r\nwell adapted for shellfish culture. It is certain that a flourishing\r\nindustry has existed here in former times. From the earliest history\r\nof the colony, records tell of the excellent clam flats at Plymouth;\r\nand we learn that the Pilgrims during the darkest hours of the early\r\nsettlement depended in large measure upon these flats for support. As\r\nlate as 1879 Ernest Ingersoll reports an annual output of 5,000 bushels\r\nof clams, and states that the industry had then greatly declined. It\r\nappears to have gone down steadily ever since, until now it merely\r\nfurnishes transient employment to 4 or 5 men, who dig at rather\r\nuncertain intervals for local markets.\r\n\r\nThe best clamming, probably because the most inaccessible, is around\r\nClark's Island. Scattering clams occur on Wind flat, the Oyster grant,\r\nand in patches along the shore. But no considerable extent of good\r\nclamming occurs anywhere, and the bulk of the territory is wholly\r\nbarren.\r\n\r\nThe town of Plymouth has endeavored in several ways to develop the\r\nindustry. It has appropriated money to restock the flats, a close\r\nseason has been tried, and an attempt made to solve the problem by the\r\ngiving of private grants. While these grants have not always been run\r\nin as energetic a manner as could be desired, the experiment has proved\r\nconclusively that there are great possibilities in such a system. In\r\nshort, there can be little doubt that in the proper administration\r\nof private grants lies the key to the solution of the problem which\r\nconfronts this whole region. As clams were once abundant in Plymouth\r\nharbor, and as no apparent causes other than excessive digging appear\r\nto have brought about the decline, there seems to be no logical reason\r\nwhy this amount of territory (500 acres) should not yield its proper\r\nharvest. As for the vast extent of eel-grass flats, with all their\r\nundetermined possibilities, they can well afford to wait until the more\r\nimmediate and pressing problems of the flats already available for clam\r\nculture have been solved.\r\n\r\n                     COMPARISON OF 1907 WITH 1879.\r\n\r\n  ======+============+=========\r\n  YEAR. | Production | Value.\r\n        | (Bushels). |\r\n  ------+------------+---------\r\n  1879, |   5,000    | $2,500\r\n  1907, |   3,000    |  2,500\r\n  ======+============+=========\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    6\r\n  Capital invested,                               $60\r\n  Value of shore property,                          -\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  3,000\r\n      Value,                                   $2,500\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       400\r\n      Mud,                                        100\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                    1,100\r\n      Total,                                    1,600\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               10\r\n      Scattering clams,                            50\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        440\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                    1,100\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $58,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barnstable._\r\n\r\nThe clam industry at Barnstable, while not so extensive as at Ipswich\r\nor Essex, is nevertheless of special interest. The immensely long\r\ncoast line, stretching for many miles on both the north and south\r\nshores of Cape Cod, gives the town a shellfish area both in Cape Cod\r\nBay and Vineyard Sound which renders it unrivalled throughout the\r\nState for variety of marine life and diversity of natural environment.\r\nThese conditions, as they affect clam culture, are best suited on the\r\nnorthern or bay side of the town, where the clam industry flourishes\r\nmore extensively, as the southern shore is almost wholly given up to\r\nthe rival quahaug, oyster and scallop fisheries.\r\n\r\nOn the northern shore a large harbor, nearly 5 miles long and about\r\n2 miles broad at its widest part, extends in a general westerly\r\ndirection, ending in a vast waste of salt marshes interwoven with a\r\nnetwork of creeks. Up this harbor the tides rush with great velocity,\r\nand when they sweep out to sea leave a broad expanse of flats, sandy\r\non the north and central portions and muddy on the south. These flats\r\ncover an aggregate area of 400 acres, comprising 200 acres of hard sand\r\nand 150 acres of soft mud. Large stretches of these mud flats on the\r\nsouth are waste, and covered for the most part with eel grass. Other\r\nsections elsewhere are likewise waste for various causes, and are to\r\nbe excluded as unprofitable or barren; yet the total available area\r\nremaining after making these deductions exceeds 350 acres. This is the\r\ntheoretical condition,--the real condition is far otherwise: 20 acres\r\nat the most yield clams, and of these only 10 acres produce them in\r\nmarketable quantities.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these conditions is interesting. In the winter\r\nthe ice and the force of storms tear out great pieces of the tough\r\nmarsh surf, and the tides sweep them down the harbor. Some of these\r\nhuge masses are torn to pieces and washed away, others find lodgment\r\non the broad surface of some tidal flat; these, becoming stationary,\r\naccumulate sediment; the grass grows upon them through the summer, and\r\ngradually a little island is formed. Surrounding these islands and\r\noftentimes growing over their entire surface, bedded in among the roots\r\nof the marsh grass, we find a very thick set of clams. In short, all\r\nthe digging of any kind is in the immediate vicinity of these islands.\r\n\r\nThe deductions to be made from these facts are apparently simple. In\r\nthe spawning season, when the microscopic clam larvæ are in their\r\nfloating stage, they are carried here and there by the currents. Later,\r\nwhen they tend normally to settle in some fertile tract of flat, they\r\nare prevented from so doing by reason of the remarkable swiftness of\r\nthe tides, which sweep strongly over the broad, smooth flats, and give\r\nthe little clams no opportunity of lodgment. Only in the firm thatch of\r\nlow-lying islands can they find anything to cling to, and here, with\r\ntheir slender byssus threads attached to unyielding grass or roots,\r\nthey are able to withstand the wash of the current. Thus the clams are\r\ngathered in great numbers in these natural collectors, later are washed\r\non the neighboring flat, and finally a little colony grows up about\r\nevery island of this sort.\r\n\r\nThat this is actually what happens is largely borne out both by\r\nobservation and facts. It makes little difference where these islands\r\nare located; clams grow nearby, while all about may stretch smooth,\r\nhard flats, perfectly adapted for clams, yet altogether barren. In view\r\nof the somewhat incomplete investigations made in this region, it is\r\nperhaps too sweeping to point out any single factor as the sole cause\r\nfor these waste areas; but undoubtedly the swift tides and smooth, hard\r\nflats, which offer no resting place for the young larvæ, constitute the\r\nmain causes.\r\n\r\nAnother odd circumstance in connection with the Barnstable clam\r\nindustry is the local regulations which control the industry. Almost\r\nall digging is carried on in the winter, as a local by-law forbids the\r\ndigging of clams in summer in any quantity exceeding 6 bushels per week\r\nfor family use. This somewhat curious by-law is designed wholly for the\r\nbenefit of the majority of the clammers, and to give them employment in\r\nthat season of the year when work is most difficult to obtain. While\r\ninterfering somewhat with summer clam bakes, the law appears to meet\r\nthe approval of the townspeople.\r\n\r\nThe south shore of Barnstable possesses many of the features of\r\nBuzzards Bay, and produces clams only in numbers sufficient for home\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   25\r\n  Capital invested,                              $200\r\n  Value of shore property,                          -\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    700\r\n      Value,                                     $550\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       200\r\n      Mud,                                        150\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                       50\r\n      Total,                                      400\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               10\r\n      Scattering clams,                            10\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        330\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       50\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $39,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yarmouth._\r\n\r\nThe clam industry at Yarmouth, never extensive, has steadily declined,\r\nuntil now it barely supplies the demands of home consumption.\r\nBarnstable bar on the northern coast twenty years ago produced clams in\r\nconsiderable quantities, but the soil was never well adapted for this\r\nshellfish. Scattering clams are now found there, but the grounds are\r\nvery much exposed, and cannot properly rank as clam-producing area.\r\nSea clams abound there at certain seasons, and furnish a transient\r\nbusiness; also razor clams, which are used extensively for bait.\r\n\r\nThe best clam territory is in Mill Creek, on the south shore of the\r\ntown. Scattered patches of clams also occur along the shore of Bass\r\nRiver, but the whole area really available does not exceed 50 acres,\r\nand this is not at all well improved. There are no regular clammers,\r\nbut intermittent digging produces about 600 bushels of clams annually,\r\nwhich are used either for home consumption or for bait.\r\n\r\nNo effort has been made on the part of the town authorities to better\r\nconditions, although the advisability of giving clam grants, at least\r\non the northern or bay side, has been discussed. No permits are\r\nrequired, and local legislation does not in any way concern itself with\r\nthe clam industry.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    5\r\n  Capital invested,                               $40\r\n  Value of shore property,                          -\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    600\r\n      Value,                                     $500\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                        25\r\n      Mud,                                         15\r\n      Gravel,                                      10\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                       50\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                5\r\n      Scattering clams,                            10\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),         25\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       10\r\n  Possible normal production,                  $6,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orleans._\r\n\r\nOrleans is one of the few towns in the State which shows an advance in\r\nthe clam industry. This is largely due to an increased production on\r\nthe rich flats of Nauset harbor, as the remaining available territory\r\nin the town is declining in value. The output of 1907 is an increase of\r\nnearly 40 per cent. over the yield of the previous year, which shows an\r\nencouraging development.\r\n\r\nThe clam flat area of the town is divided into four rather distinct\r\ndivisions, three on the east or Atlantic side and one on the Bay or\r\nwestern side. The grounds which have been dug for the longest time and\r\nyielded uniformly the best results lie in the waters of Town Cove. Here\r\na strip of gravelly sand and mud about 30 feet wide extends along the\r\nshores of this cove for 2 or 3 miles. Clams are scattered throughout\r\nthis strip, and are dug constantly.\r\n\r\nThe second division includes the bars of Nauset harbor, which at\r\npresent furnish the best digging in town. The increased value of the\r\ntown's industry is largely due to the recent development of these\r\nflats. Clams have seeded in abundantly during the past two or three\r\nyears, and now furnish very good digging.\r\n\r\nThe third section comprises that portion of the clam flat area\r\nbordering the coast of Pleasant Bay which crosses the town boundaries\r\non the southeast. Here clams are rather scarce, though dug\r\noccasionally. This section is economically the least important of the\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section extends along the western coast, on a belt of sand\r\nbars well out in Cape Cod Bay. Clams are found on a strip about a\r\nquarter of a mile in width, and lying over half a mile from shore. This\r\nis a very exposed location. Billingsgate Point, projecting out from\r\nthe Wellfleet coast, offers some protection from northwest winds, and\r\nthe hills of the Cape break the force of the easterly gales; but the\r\nfull force of storms from the west and southwest sweeps these bars, and\r\nwould seem to render them unsuitable for the growth of clams. Clams are\r\nhere, however, in considerable numbers, though not so numerous as three\r\nor four years ago, and are dug to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the digging is done by intermittent clammers, who\r\nobtain perhaps 2½ bushels per day. No permits are required, as there\r\nare no town by-laws regulating the industry.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   30\r\n  Capital invested,                              $200\r\n  Value of shore property,                          -\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  3,000\r\n      Value,                                   $3,000\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       125\r\n      Mud,                                         50\r\n      Gravel,                                      20\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        5\r\n      Total,                                      200\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               25\r\n      Scattering clams,                            50\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),         75\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       50\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $27,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eastham._\r\n\r\nThe town of Eastham is a sparsely settled community, and the clam\r\nfishery, while not large, plays a rather important part in its business\r\nactivity. Six men depend quite largely upon it for a livelihood, while\r\nsome 30 others dig intermittently through the summer. The same peculiar\r\ncondition as at Orleans exists on the western coast. Here far from\r\nshore clams are found in considerable numbers on the shifting bars. The\r\nmain source of supply, however, comes from the productive sand flats of\r\nNauset harbor.\r\n\r\nThese flats have seeded in only in the past two or three years, but\r\nthey have already shown latent possibilities of a future increase. In\r\nthe so-called \"Salt Pond\" 2 men are employed nearly the year round in\r\ndigging clams under water by a method of \"churning,\" locally known as\r\n\"rootling.\"\r\n\r\nThe total available area in Eastham is about 200 acres. More than half\r\nof this is sand, which includes almost all the good digging, while the\r\nmud flats are interspersed with stretches of gravel and scattering\r\npatches of eel grass.\r\n\r\nThe same abuses which have nearly ruined the Swansea fishery have begun\r\nhere. Small seed clams are exported in considerable quantities to\r\nsupply the summer demand of the New Bedford and Fall River districts.\r\nWhile this system has not yet made its ravages apparent, a glance\r\nat the Swansea report will serve to convince the most casual reader\r\nthat unless some steps are taken to check this evil, the practical\r\nannihilation of the Eastham clam industry must follow. As it is, local\r\nlegislation seems powerless to cope with the problem, and no laws of\r\nany kind relating to the clam fishery are in force.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   36\r\n  Capital invested,                              $250\r\n  Value of shore property,                         --\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  4,000\r\n      Value,                                   $4,000\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       100\r\n      Mud,                                         50\r\n      Gravel,                                      30\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                       20\r\n      Total,                                      200\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               25\r\n      Scattering clams,                            50\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        100\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       25\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $30,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wellfleet._\r\n\r\nAlthough possessing extensive flats, Wellfleet produces at present a\r\nrelatively small amount of clams. The inhabitants realize that these\r\nflats are capable of producing a large harvest of clams if properly\r\nplanted, and that in this way an extensive industry can be developed,\r\nand have undertaken to restock the flats, appropriating in 1906 for\r\nthis purpose the sum of $1,000.\r\n\r\nAt Billingsgate Island there are fair clam flats, but they are not\r\neasily accessible, as they lie at a distance of 5 miles from town.\r\nClams can also be obtained in more or less abundance in the thatch\r\nwhich borders the flats of Blackfish Creek, Herring River and Duck\r\nCreek. A few clams are scattered over the flats of Blackfish Creek,\r\nparticularly toward the head of the creek. Two patches of clams\r\ncovering perhaps an acre are on the flats in front of the town: one\r\nin the stone and gravel east of Commercial wharf; the other, a more\r\nextensive area, just west of Mercantile wharf.\r\n\r\nWellfleet possesses many acres of flats which, though now barren, are\r\ncapable of excellent production if properly planted. Wellfleet flats\r\nextend from Duck Creek to Herring River and from Herring River along\r\nthe shores of Great Island for a distance of 4½ miles, and cover an\r\narea of 400 acres. The Great Island flats are not especially adapted\r\nfor clams, and only parts of these can ever be successfully cultivated,\r\nwhile possibly all the area between Duck Creek and Herring River can be\r\nreclaimed. South Wellfleet flats, which comprise an area of 200 acres,\r\nare much poorer flats, consisting for the most part of mud and shifting\r\nsand. Only the firmer portions, about 50 acres, can be made productive\r\nby planting with clams.\r\n\r\nAt Wellfleet the soft clam fishery can hardly be styled an industry.\r\nIn the winter a few men go clamming when there is nothing else to do.\r\nThe majority prefer razor clamming, which is a considerable winter\r\nindustry, owing to the demand for this bait at Provincetown. Three\r\nmen clam during the summer, doing practically all their digging at\r\nBillingsgate, while 8 others are in this work during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe flats of Wellfleet were never very productive, but formerly were\r\ncapable of furnishing a far greater production than at present. This\r\ndecline is only accounted for by overdigging, which has brought about\r\nthe present scarcity.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   11\r\n  Capital invested,                              $300\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    800\r\n      Value,                                     $640\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       450\r\n      Mud,                                          5\r\n      Gravel,                                     150\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                       --\r\n      Total,                                      605\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                3\r\n      Scattering clams,                            12\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        250\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                      340\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $28,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Truro._\r\n\r\nThe clam flats at Truro are confined principally to the Pamet River. At\r\nthe mouth of this river near the head of the harbor bar is a sand flat\r\ncomprising several acres, where the bulk of the clams are produced. In\r\nSouth Truro, Stony Bar and other similar patches of rocky beach are\r\nfairly well bedded with clams. Scattering clams are found over the\r\nshifting bars which skirt the main land on the bay side, but nowhere\r\nare clams sufficiently abundant to warrant any serious attempt at\r\nexportation. Fifteen to twenty years ago clams were everywhere much\r\nmore abundant in this region than now, and in those days some market\r\ndigging was carried on. At present the needs of the home market are\r\nwith difficulty supplied from the local production, and 100 bushels per\r\nyear would cover all clams dug both for food and bait. No effort has at\r\nany time been made by the town authorities to increase the industry,\r\nthough the clam fishery, at least in the sheltered coves of Pamet\r\nRiver, is not without possibilities of development.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    1\r\n  Capital invested,                                $2\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                     50\r\n      Value,                                      $60\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                        50\r\n      Mud,                                         --\r\n      Gravel,                                      --\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                       --\r\n      Total,                                       50\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                1\r\n      Scattering clams,                             2\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),         47\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       --\r\n  Possible normal production,                  $5,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Provincetown._\r\n\r\nFor the last five years the flats of Provincetown have produced only a\r\nsmall amount of clams. Wherever clams have set in abundance they have\r\nbeen quickly dug by fishermen for bait, thus checking their natural\r\npropagation.\r\n\r\nClams are found in the drains among the thatch beds on the southwest\r\nside of the harbor and in Race Run, while a considerable set is\r\nscattered between the wharves of the town. All the extensive flats at\r\nthe southwest end of the harbor are entirely barren of clams, owing\r\nchiefly to the shifting nature of the sand, although on certain parts\r\nof these, especially near the thatch, clams would grow if planted. As\r\nit is, the shifting sand makes it impossible for the young clams to set\r\non this area.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    5\r\n  Capital invested,                               $15\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    400\r\n      Value,                                     $320\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       400\r\n      Mud,                                          -\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      400\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                3\r\n      Scattering clams,                             3\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        200\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                      194\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $21,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chatham._\r\n\r\nChatham can no longer be considered as the best clam-producing town of\r\nsouthern Massachusetts. In 1879 Chatham produced a greater quantity\r\nof soft clams than all the rest of the Cape; to-day all has changed,\r\nand the annual output is far less than several other towns of the Cape\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe town of Chatham is situated in the southeastern portion of Cape\r\nCod, and includes that part which is commonly called the \"elbow\" of the\r\nCape. It is surrounded on the north, east and south sides by the ocean,\r\nwhile on the south the peninsula known as Monomoy Island extends for 9\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe clamming territory of Chatham is situated in Stage harbor, Pleasant\r\nBay and at Monomoy Point.\r\n\r\nIn Stage harbor clams are found along the sides of the Mill Pond,\r\ncomprising possibly an acre, and in the eastern end of the harbor\r\ntoward the dike, where about 3 acres of flats are thickly set.\r\n\r\nAn extended area of sand flats are found in Pleasant Bay. But small\r\nparts of this area furnish good clamming, and the Common Flats on the\r\ninside of Monomoy Island, where once there were acres of good clams,\r\nnow lie entirely barren except for a small patch of set just north of\r\nBrant Island, comprising about 1/5 of an acre. Here are about 100 acres\r\nof barren flats which only need planting to be made productive.\r\n\r\nThe commercial clam fishery, of the town is carried on at Monomoy\r\nPoint, where 5 acres of the best clamming in Massachusetts is found.\r\nThe Powder Hole flats, formed of coarse, clean sand, are thickly set\r\nwith clams of all sizes, and furnish excellent digging. A good clammer\r\ncan obtain from 5 to 6 bushels per tide from these flats.\r\n\r\nClams are dug at Chatham during the fishing season chiefly for bait.\r\nSuch digging lasts through the fall and winter. In the summer, clams\r\nare dug only for food, as no cod fishing is conducted in the warm\r\nmonths. From 10 to 15 men were engaged in clamming during the summer\r\nof 1907, travelling from Chatham to Monomoy Point in power or sail\r\ndories. Practically all the clams dug came from the Powder Hole flats\r\nat Monomoy Point. These were purchased at Chatham wharf by fish firms\r\nat the price of $2 per barrel.\r\n\r\nThe winter clam fishery of Chatham was once an important industry,\r\nwhich started in 1875 when clams were in great demand as fish bait.

The shores of the Popponesset River furnish\r\nperhaps favorable conditions for the growth of this shellfish, but\r\nthe available territory is small, not exceeding 50 acres, and of this\r\nonly a small percentage, comprising scattered patches of gravel-mud,\r\nproduces clams in any abundance.\r\n\r\nNo effort is made at exportation for market, and under the present\r\ncircumstances it is doubtful if a greater yield than that required to\r\nsupply home consumption could be expected. No effort is made on the\r\npart of local legislation to control the industry or foster it in any\r\nway.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    2\r\n  Capital invested,                               $20\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                     50\r\n      Value,                                      $45\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                        20\r\n      Mud,                                          5\r\n      Gravel,                                      20\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        5\r\n      Total,                                       50\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                2\r\n      Scattering clams,                             8\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),         30\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       10\r\n  Possible normal production,                  $5,400\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buzzards Bay._\r\n\r\nThe section of Massachusetts bordering the shores of Buzzards Bay\r\nsupports a flourishing quahaug, oyster and scallop fishery, capable of\r\ngreat development. The clam industry, however, never very extensive,\r\nis of very slight significance at present, and can never attain the\r\nsame degree of importance as the other shellfisheries, owing to the\r\nlimited area available for clams. To those familiar with the harbors\r\nof Newburyport and Duxbury and their vast tidal flats with their\r\nlatent possibilities, the shores of Buzzards Bay present indeed a\r\nnotable contrast. Bluff and hilly for the most part, and frequently\r\nrocky, nowhere do they show extensive flats suitable for clam culture.\r\nThat clams grow wherever opportunity permits is evident, for they\r\nare found on gravelly stretches or among rocks all along the coast,\r\nexcept in those localities openly exposed to the full force of the\r\nsea. But allowing for all possible favorable features, the lack of any\r\nconsiderable territory is a disadvantage that will forever act as a\r\nbarrier to any expansion. Falmouth and Dartmouth on the east and west\r\nsides of Buzzards Bay respectively differ materially from the remaining\r\ntowns of the district, in the fact that the characteristic soil of\r\ntheir clam grounds is sand; while the other towns have little in the\r\nshape of available territory except gravel stretches along the shores\r\nof coves, small areas of mud, and the rocky beaches of points and\r\nheadlands. The yearly output hardly anywhere suffices for the needs of\r\nhome consumption. Nowhere is any attempt at exportation possible. The\r\nbusiness, such as it is, is carried on in a very intermittent fashion,\r\nchiefly in the summer, with but a small investment of capital.\r\n\r\nSpecial local regulation seems to remain aloof from the problem of\r\ninsuring a future clam supply. That the combined area of all the towns\r\nof Buzzards Bay does not equal that of a single town in the Cape Ann\r\ndistrict is an undeniable truth; but the fact nevertheless remains\r\nthat an industry far more considerable than exists at present could be\r\nsupported, and it is truly to the interest of the towns of this region\r\nto make the best possible use of their limited advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Falmouth._\r\n\r\nFalmouth has a long coast line not only on Buzzards Bay but also on\r\nVineyard Sound. The flats at North and West Falmouth on the bay side\r\nare similar to those of Wareham and Bourne, though there are several\r\nsmall patches of quite good digging. On the southern shore there\r\nare clams scattered along the coasts of the various indentations,\r\nparticularly at Waquoit Bay.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    -\r\n  Capital invested,                                 -\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    200\r\n      Value,                                     $175\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                        40\r\n      Mud,                                          5\r\n      Gravel,                                       5\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                       50\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                2\r\n      Scattering clams,                             8\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),         40\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                        -\r\n  Possible normal production,                  $6,400\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bourne._\r\n\r\nThe clam industry at Bourne is practically extinct.

This clearly shows the\r\nlow ebb to which the industry has fallen in this region.\r\n\r\nThere are no true tide flats in Wareham, but the total area of the\r\nmud-gravel and rocky bottom between high and low water mark where\r\nscattering clams are found is nearly 100 acres. There are no regular\r\nfishermen, but some half dozen quahaugers dig clams from time to time,\r\nchiefly during the summer, to supply the home market.\r\n\r\nThe industry, such as it is, appears to be about stationary at present,\r\nthough in production it has declined notably during the last twenty\r\nyears. The town officials have attempted no measures to revive the\r\nfailing fishery, and no town laws affect it in any way.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    6\r\n  Capital invested,                              $100\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    800\r\n      Value,                                     $800\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                        15\r\n      Mud,                                         10\r\n      Gravel,                                      75\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      100\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                -\r\n      Scattering clams,                            50\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),          -\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       50\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marion._\r\n\r\nThe wealthy summer residents at Marion create a demand for clams at\r\na very substantial price. In spite of the increased price, there is\r\nlittle inducement to engage in this industry as a livelihood, and only\r\n1 man digs steadily through the summer months, though intermittent\r\ndigging is done by others to supply the local market.\r\n\r\nThe best clamming is on the east coast of Great Neck and in Wing's\r\nCove. These grounds are difficult of access, and consequently have not\r\nbeen so much overworked as the nearer shores of Ram's Island, Allan's\r\nPoint and Blankinship's Cove.

The\r\nfinest clam grounds of this town lie in the proscribed district of the\r\nAcushnet River, and handling or eating shellfish from this area is a\r\npositive menace to the public health.\r\n\r\nA strip of gravel-mud about 100 feet in average width fringes the\r\nshores of Priest's Cove, and this strip furnishes at present the best\r\ndigging. Scattered patches of clams occur along the indentations of\r\nSconticut Neck, around West Island and along the coast of Little\r\nBay.

Now practically all the available territory of the\r\ncity is proscribed, and no clams are allowed to be taken from this\r\narea except for use as bait. Licenses are also required to take clams\r\neven for bait from this proscribed territory. Three hundred and twenty\r\nof these licenses have been issued since the passage of the act in\r\n1904. The annual yield of clams for this purpose cannot be accurately\r\nascertained, but probably does not exceed 250 bushels. No important\r\nclam industry would ever have been possible at New Bedford, under any\r\ncircumstances, but the slight possibilities which once existed have\r\nbeen swept away and can never return under the present conditions,\r\nthough shellfish grown in this region could, if suitable legislation\r\nwere enacted, be transplanted to a sanitary environment, where in a\r\nmonth all danger of spreading typhoid germs would be avoided.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Licenses for bait,                              320\r\n  Capital invested,                                 -\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels (for bait),                         300\r\n      Value,                                     $225\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                         5\r\n      Mud,                                          5\r\n      Gravel,                                      15\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                       25\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                -\r\n      Scattering clams,                            15\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),          -\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       10\r\n  Possible normal production,                  $3,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dartmouth._\r\n\r\nThe town of Dartmouth possesses a wide expanse of territory, but the\r\nactual amount of available clam ground is not as large as it would\r\nappear at first sight. Clams are found in more or less abundance at the\r\nfollowing places: (1) Rickerson's Point (2/3 acre); (2) Apponagansett\r\nRiver (6 acres); (3) Apponagansett harbor (1 acre); (4) Nonquit (1/10\r\nacre); (5) Round Hill Point (1/5 acre); (6) Salter's Point (3/4 acre);\r\n(7) Smith's Neck (3/5 acre); (8) Little River (7-1/2 acres); (9)\r\nSlocum's River (6 acres); comprising a total of 23 acres. The best\r\nclamming is obtained on the flats of Little and Slocum's rivers. In\r\nApponagansett River clams are dug in the summer for the Padanaram clam\r\nbakes.\r\n\r\nA town by-law placing a closed season on Slocum's River was in\r\nforce during the years 1904 and 1905. In 1906 Dartmouth, by a State\r\nlaw, required permits for clamming.

Six towns of this region enjoy the privileges\r\nof a clam industry, situated as they are on the shores of Mt. Hope\r\nBay and its tributary streams, the Cole, Lee and Taunton rivers.\r\nBeginning with the most westerly and taking them in order, these towns\r\ncomprise Swansea, Somerset, Dighton, Berkley, Freetown and Fall River.\r\nThese towns differ only in extent of resources or development of the\r\nindustry, while the general nature of the clam flats and the methods\r\nemployed in carrying on the business are essentially alike for all.\r\nThe area in this region suitable for clam culture possesses some of\r\nthe distinguishing features of the typical north shore flats, some\r\nof the Buzzards Bay variety and some peculiar to itself. There are\r\nscarcely any sand flats, and the prevailing type of soil is mud, as at\r\nNewburyport, or gravel, as in Buzzards Bay; while the greater part of\r\nthe clam supply comes from a large and rather indefinite area, which is\r\nnot properly tide flat at all, but lies continuously submerged.\r\n\r\nThe methods employed in carrying on this industry include both wet and\r\ndry digging. On the tide flats the clams are dug as elsewhere on the\r\nsouth shore, with hoes or the common digger. Where, however, clams\r\nare dug in 2 or 3 feet of water, as is most frequently the case, an\r\nordinary long-handled shovel and wire basket are employed. The soil\r\ncontaining the clams is shoveled into the baskets, and then the clams\r\nare sifted out under water. Several years ago an attempt was made\r\nto dig clams by machinery. An enterprising oysterman spent several\r\nhundred dollars in constructing a machine which was designed to farm\r\nthe under-water districts more quickly and successfully than could be\r\ndone by hand. The device had some of the principles of a suction pump,\r\nand theoretically the clams on the submerged flats could be washed out\r\nfrom the soil and collected in a receptacle. The machine worked well\r\nenough in extracting the clams from the mud, but failed completely\r\nwhen it came to collecting them. In short, after a thorough trial it\r\nwas pronounced a failure and had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe main peculiarity of this region, and a far more important one\r\nthan the type of soil or the methods of digging, is the nature of the\r\nclams which are produced. The inadequate territory and the constantly\r\nincreasing demands of the Fall River markets have led to abuses which\r\nhave had a most disastrous effect on the clam industry, and unless\r\nchecked, and soon, these abuses will certainly cause its complete\r\nannihilation. The abuses in question are the universal custom of\r\ndigging small seed clams for food. So importunate have the markets of\r\nFall River and the vicinity become, that when the supply of suitable\r\nclams proves inadequate they demand and will gladly take \"anything with\r\na shell on,\" as the dealers say, so that it is no uncommon sight to see\r\nexposed for sale in the city markets clams of only 1 inch in length.\r\nThis deplorable condition is fostered by the custom of digging under\r\nwater, for the fine mesh of the woven-wire baskets retains even the\r\nsmallest clams, which are saved for market.\r\n\r\nNo quicker or surer way of destroying the industry completely could\r\nhave been devised than this method of digging seed clams for food. One\r\nbarrel of these clams would produce 10 to 15 barrels of marketable\r\nclams if left for one year under favorable circumstances. Thus, when\r\na clammer digs 1 barrel of these clams he is in reality destroying 10\r\nor more barrels. This is truly reaping the \"seed\" before it has had\r\nany time to mature the proper harvest. Also, these \"seed\" clams are so\r\nimmature that in many cases they have not spawned, and thus the clammer\r\nby destroying the clams in this manner damages irrevocably all chances\r\nof restocking the flats.\r\n\r\nFrom the inherent difficulties of the problem, however, local\r\nregulation seems powerless to cope with the evil. The short-sighted\r\nclammers, while they know that these methods, if pursued very far,\r\nwill ultimately destroy the industry, seem willing, nevertheless,\r\nto sacrifice the future for the present. The other clammers are\r\ninevitably brought into line on this mistaken policy, as they cannot\r\nbut argue that if a few will persist in exploiting a natural resource\r\nit is the right of every man to have an equal chance, and take his\r\nshare of the proceeds as long as they last. Another potent factor in\r\nthis wastefulness is the irresponsible foreign element of the mill\r\ndistricts, who dig clams for their own use, large or small, with entire\r\nindifference. It might perhaps prove unjust and difficult to enforce\r\nlaws preventing individuals digging \"seed\" clams for their own use; but\r\nlegislation could possibly be enacted preventing the sale of such seed\r\nin the public market. This would strike a blow at the abuse sufficient\r\nto rob it of its worst features. The most casual glance at the facts\r\nin the case prove that there is a pressing need for some legislative\r\naction. The history of the clam industry in this region is one of\r\nsteady and rapid decline. Any clammer of the vicinity is willing to\r\nacknowledge that conditions at present are in a very unsatisfactory\r\nstate. The output of clams has greatly diminished, both in the\r\nconsensus of opinion of those interested in the business, and also\r\naccording to statistical figures. Furthermore, the end of the industry,\r\nas far as any economic importance is concerned, is plainly in sight,\r\nand at the present rate of destruction cannot long be delayed. It would\r\nseem that here was a striking example of the need of prompt and wise\r\nlegislation for the protection and development of an industry which has\r\nmade large profits for the community, and might yield still greater\r\nreturns if properly regulated.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this region can never compete with the towns of the\r\nNewburyport district in the production of clams, for the reason that\r\nthey have by no means an equal acreage of suitable flats. The Taunton\r\nRiver is also a considerable factor, as its contaminated waters impair\r\nthe quality of clams grown along its shores. There remains, however,\r\na considerable extent of suitable territory which might yield a large\r\nproduct if rightly controlled, and this territory, with its inherent\r\npossibilities depleted to the verge of exhaustion by unwise and\r\nwasteful methods, it is for the interest of the Commonwealth to protect\r\nand improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Swansea._\r\n\r\nSwansea, the most western town of this district, is by far the\r\nmost favorably located, and has the greatest possibilities of clam\r\nproduction. Situated on the northern shore of Mt. Hope Bay, and\r\ncontaining the majority of the flats in the Cole and Lee rivers, it\r\npossesses a greater available territory free from the contaminating\r\ninfluences of the Taunton River than any other town in this region.\r\n\r\nAltogether, 200 acres comprise the possibly available clam area of this\r\ntown. The best of this area is located in Cole's River, and includes\r\nLong Beach flat, the best flat of the district. Situated on the east\r\nshore of the river just below the railroad bridge, this flat stretches\r\nsouth in a broad triangle comprising some 20 acres of smooth, semihard\r\nmud. Over the main flat is sprinkled a very thick set of ½ inch to 1\r\ninch clams, interspersed with some of larger growth. While this is\r\nthe best flat, other flats extend along both shores far up the river\r\nuntil the clams become too \"fresh\" to be very good. Flats also occur\r\nin the Lee River, and there is a large and rather indeterminate amount\r\nof under-water territory. The total area suitable for culture is not\r\nfar from 150 acres; of this, about 20 acres are gravel and the rest\r\npractically all mud.\r\n\r\nNo permits are necessary to dig clams on tidal flats, but permits are\r\nrequired to \"churn\" clams under water. Twenty of these permits were\r\nissued last year. Usually in digging under water two men work together,\r\none shovelling the mud into the wire baskets and the other sifting out\r\nthe clams. About 75 per cent. of the clams produced come from these\r\nunder-water areas, as the tide flats are for the most part nearly\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nThe season lasts all the year round, though most of the clams are dug\r\nin the summer time. Of late years it has become increasingly hard for a\r\nman to earn a living by clamming, as only 1 to 1½ bushels now comprise\r\nan average day's work under the most favorable circumstances. Many of\r\nthe clammers are leaving the business and seeking a livelihood in other\r\nemployments.\r\n\r\nThe history of the industry is one of marked decline. The most\r\nconservative clammer estimates that at the present rate the passing of\r\nfive years will witness the complete annihilation of the industry.\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                   25\r\n  Capital invested,                              $250\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                  5,000\r\n      Value,                                   $5,000\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       100\r\n      Mud,                                        100\r\n      Gravel,                                       -\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      200\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                               20\r\n      Scattering clams,                            30\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        100\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       50\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $24,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Somerset._\r\n\r\nSomerset, the next town in order, joins Swansea on the east and\r\nextends several miles up the left bank of the Taunton River. Its flats\r\non the south and west, particularly in the Lee River, produce some\r\nclams, though the industry is practically run out. The total clam area\r\ncomprises about 75 acres. This is mostly mud, though gravel stretches\r\nalong the shore aggregate perhaps 10 acres. The development of latent\r\npossibilities in this territory is largely curtailed by the disastrous\r\neffects of the Taunton River upon the clams. This water, contaminated\r\nby the manufacturing plants of Taunton, makes the clams grown in the\r\nnorthern part of the town of inferior taste and quality.\r\n\r\nSix licenses, costing $1 apiece, were issued last year for \"churning\"\r\nclams.

Years ago it is claimed that clams were abundant, and that\r\nquantities were dug for food or for bait. Now the reverse is true, and\r\nthe fisherman often finds it difficult to procure clams even for bait.\r\nIndeed, Nantucket furnishes an excellent illustration of the decline of\r\nthe clam industry.\r\n\r\nPractically all the flats of Nantucket are shore flats _i.e._, narrow\r\nflats along the shores of the harbor and on the sides of the creeks.\r\nThus the area, though extending for many miles, is not great, and\r\nthe clam industry of the island, though capable of development,\r\nnevertheless can never assume the importance of the quahaug and the\r\nscallop fisheries. In Nantucket harbor clams are found in the creeks,\r\nand particularly in Polpis harbor, although scattering clams are found\r\nall along the south shore of the harbor. A few clams are found on the\r\nnorth side in Coatou Creek and in First and Second Bend. The flats in\r\nNantucket harbor are all coarse sand or a fine gravel, except in the\r\ncreeks, where they become muddy. On the eastern and southern sides\r\nclams are found in scattering quantities in Maddequet harbor, on the\r\nnorth side of Tuckernuck and in the cove on the south side of Muskeget.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF 1907 WITH 1879.\r\n\r\n  =============================+=================+=================\r\n            PRODUCTION.        |     1879.       |       1907.\r\n  -----------------------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n  Bushels,                     |     2,253       |        400\r\n  Value,                       |      $872       |       $350\r\n  =============================+=================+=================\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n  Number of men,                                    4\r\n  Capital invested,                               $40\r\n  Production, 1907:--\r\n      Bushels,                                    400\r\n      Value,                                     $350\r\n  Total area (acres):--\r\n      Sand,                                       150\r\n      Mud,                                         25\r\n      Gravel,                                      25\r\n      Mussels and eel grass,                        -\r\n      Total,                                      200\r\n  Productive area (acres):--\r\n      Good clamming,                                5\r\n      Scattering clams,                            15\r\n  Barren area possibly productive (acres),        130\r\n  Waste barren area (acres),                       50\r\n  Possible normal production,                 $18,000\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgartown._\r\n\r\nAlthough Edgartown possesses 200 acres of clam flats, it is not in a\r\ntrue sense a clam-producing town. The reason for this small production\r\nis due to the nature of the flats, which are mostly under water at\r\nlow tide, making clamming difficult. Naturally Edgartown devotes its\r\nenergies to the more profitable quahaug and scallop fisheries.\r\n\r\nThe clam flats of the town are situated along the shores of Cape Poge\r\nPond and in the lower part of Katama Bay, where many acres of flats are\r\ncontinually submerged. The shore flats are of small area, owing to the\r\nlight rise and fall of the tide, less than 3 feet at this part of the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n(1) _Cape Poge Pond._--Scattering clams are found all along the shore\r\nflats, except for a ¾-mile strip on the west side. The soil is of a\r\ncoarse sand or gravel.\r\n\r\n(2) _Katama Bay._--The best clam flats of the town are situated in\r\nKatama Bay, and extend over a considerable territory. These flats,\r\nconsisting of a coarse, sandy soil, lie continually submerged. Here the\r\nclams are dug by means of a \"sea horse.\" This \"animal\" is nothing more\r\nthan an elongated clam hoe with a belt attachment, whereby the clammer\r\ncan \"churn\" out the clams at a depth of 2 to 3 feet.\r\n\r\nThe clam industry of Edgartown has fallen off considerably since 1879.\r\nHowever, the clammers say that it has improved during the last fifteen\r\nyears.

To the trained observer, however, it seems of the greatest\r\nimportance in dealing with such a practical and important problem to\r\nplace on record all facts and opinions which may become of value, and\r\nto emphasize by frequent repetitions certain fundamental facts.\r\n\r\n                        Respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n                                                          D. L. BELDING.\r\n\r\nThe preceding report is intended to be a reliable statement of\r\nfacts, and suggestions for consideration. On such a basis of facts\r\nthe future policy of developing the shellfisheries must be based. It\r\nis the purpose of the Commissioners on Fisheries and Game to hold\r\na series of public hearings in the different sections of the State\r\nfor the purpose of giving personal expositions of the shellfish\r\nconditions and possibilities, and of giving a better opportunity for\r\nexchanging, discussing and weighing opinions. Meantime, in considering\r\nthe conditions of the shellfisheries of Massachusetts, and the laws\r\nnecessary to improve these conditions, the following points are of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe present shellfish laws are based upon the principle of \"public\"\r\nfisheries, and were made at times and at places where there was such\r\na superabundance that the natural increase was sufficient to meet\r\nthe market demands. Artificial cultivation was unnecessary. The\r\nfundamental laws were made in the colonial days. Since then the demand\r\nfor shellfish as food has enormously increased, and for many years the\r\nannual natural increase has been entirely inadequate to meet these\r\ndemands. We have outgrown the conditions which the original conception\r\nof that law covered. Under parallel conditions it has been found\r\nnecessary to sell or lease the public lands, in order that the yield of\r\nfood may be increased by cultivation under the immediate direction and\r\nresponsibility of individual citizens, and under protection of State\r\nand national laws. When it was learned that the yield of a cultivated\r\noyster bed far exceeded the natural product both in quantity and\r\nquality, the oyster laws were so modified that an important industry\r\nwas built up, until to-day practically the entire oyster yield of\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut is from cultivated beds,\r\nand the total product is many times the total catch from the natural\r\nbeds in their palmiest days. To-day not only is it necessary to so\r\nmodify the oyster laws as to increase the opportunities for better\r\nutilizing our bays and estuaries for oyster growing on a more extensive\r\nscale than is done at present, but also for developing similar methods\r\nof growing clams and quahaugs, and perhaps also scallops. The tidal\r\nflats must, as well as the deeper waters, be made to produce food and\r\nmoney by securing a larger yield per acre, and by the utilization of\r\nthousands of acres which are now practically idle, but which either are\r\nnow adapted for growing shellfish or can readily be made so.\r\n\r\nOur present shellfish laws are a heterogeneous, conflicting patchwork,\r\ndevised to meet temporary and local conditions, utterly inadequate\r\nto-day to permit the fishermen to secure a just return for their labor,\r\nand completely sacrificing the public interests. In many cases the\r\nresponsible tax-paying citizen cannot find a place to dig a family\r\nsupply of clams or quahaugs, neither can the industrious native\r\nfisherman get a fair day's pay for his labor.\r\n\r\nAn entirely new code of shellfish laws is necessary, based upon the\r\ngeneral principles (1) that in selling the shores the State reserved\r\nthe right of fishing as \"far as the tide doth ebb and flow,\" and (2)\r\nthat the State may now lease these fishing rights under such conditions\r\nand restrictions as to secure to every citizen so desiring and so\r\ndeserving an opportunity to cultivate such a definite area as may meet\r\nhis needs and powers. Experience has proved conclusively that it is\r\na correct economic principle for the State to give a secure title to\r\ncertain carefully defined lands to a capable man, and to say: \"This\r\nland is yours. You may raise potatoes, corn, hay or anything you\r\nchoose. Every plant, fruit or tree growing on this property is yours.\r\nYou have become responsible for its right and proper use. You have full\r\nand complete rights in this property, and can develop it by investing\r\nyour labor and your money according to your own judgment, and the State\r\nwill protect you in these rights as long as you do not interfere with\r\nthe rights of other persons.\" Equally so it is an indubitable economic\r\nfact that the landowner finds it more profitable to plant or transplant\r\ncorn, potatoes, grass, strawberries, etc., rather than to depend upon\r\nthe natural methods and yield. Similarly, it is equally logical for the\r\nState to give to the fisherman equal opportunities with the farmer. The\r\nState should guarantee the tenure of the fisherman in his definitely\r\nbounded shellfish garden, and should protect his interests and the\r\nproperty on that garden as securely as if it were potatoes or corn,\r\nand should, so far as possible, guard him from local jealousy or the\r\neffects of petty politics so long as he continues wisely to improve\r\nhis grant in conformity to the spirit and letter of laws which are\r\nfound by experience to give the greatest good to the greatest number.\r\n\r\nFurther, the State should protect the fishermen and the consumers of\r\nshellfish by defining the areas which from a sanitary point of view\r\nare (1) totally unsuitable for shellfish cultivation; (2) those where\r\nshellfish may be grown but not eaten; and, finally, (3) definite areas\r\nfrom which alone shellfish may be sold for food. Provide suitable\r\npenalties for sale of shellfish which have not been kept for the\r\nrequired time (at least thirty days) in sanitary surroundings before\r\ngoing to market. The entire question of pollution of streams and\r\nestuaries must be carefully considered in view of the public rights\r\nand of the commercial interests of the fishermen. Further, the laws\r\nmust be so carefully drawn that the respective rights and interests of\r\nindividual fishermen, shore owners, summer cottagers and the transient\r\npublic at the seashore are completely safeguarded against the dangers\r\nof predatory wealth monopolizing the opportunities for cultivating\r\nshellfish in the waters and the tidal flats.\r\n\r\nThe situation is extremely complicated on account of the diverse\r\nconditions and the numerous conflicting interests, oystermen,\r\nquahaugers, clammers and scallopers, native and alien fishermen, owners\r\nof shore property, town and State rights, local interests and petty\r\npolitics, and careful judicial consideration is necessary not alone\r\nas to the substance of the necessary laws, but upon the methods of\r\nadministering these laws.\r\n\r\n                        Respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n                                                         G.

The photograph\r\nshows the correct position of the pusher in operation. Only a small\r\npart of the pole is shown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =The Box Scallop Dredge.=--This dredge consists of a\r\nrectangular framework, 27 by 12 inches, with an oval-shaped iron bar\r\nextending backward as a support for the netting bag, which is attached\r\nto the rectangular frame. To the sides of this frame is joined a heavy\r\niron chain about 4 feet long, to which the drag rope is fastened. This\r\nstyle of dredge is used only at Chatham and the neighboring towns of\r\nCape Cod.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Scallop Dredge=,--\"=The Scraper.=\"--This implement\r\nhas the form of a triangular iron framework, with a curve of nearly\r\n90° at the base, to form the bowl of the dredge. On the upper side a\r\nraised cross bar connects the two arms, while at the bottom a strip\r\nof iron 2 inches wide extends across the dredge. This narrow strip\r\nacts as a scraping blade, and is set at an angle so as to dig into the\r\nsoil. The top of the net is fastened to the cross bar and the lower\r\npart to the blade. The usual dimensions of the dredge are: arms, 2½\r\nfeet; upper cross bar, 2 feet; blade, 2½ feet. The net varies in size,\r\nusually running from 2 to 3 feet in length and holding between 1 and\r\n2 bushels. Additional weights can be put on the cross bar when the\r\nscalloper desires the dredge to \"scrape\" deeper. A wooden bar 2 feet\r\nlong buoys the net. The scraper used at Nantucket has the entire net\r\nmade of twine, whereas in other localities the lower part consists of\r\ninterwoven iron rings.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =The Oyster Dredge.=--This is the type of oyster dredge\r\nused on the large gasolene boats. The photograph was taken on board the\r\noyster boat of Mr. James Monahan of Wareham. The dredge consists of a\r\nnet of woven iron rings attached to an iron framework. From each corner\r\nof the framework rods extend, converging at a point some feet away,\r\nwhere the drag rope is attached. The blade, resting horizontally on the\r\nsurface, is armed with large teeth which rake the oysters into the bag.\r\nWhen this bag, which holds from 8 to 15 bushels, is full, the dredge is\r\nraised by a gasolene hoist.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =The Basket Quahaug Rake.=--This style of basket rake\r\nis used at Edgartown and Nantucket. The whole rake is made of iron,\r\nno netting being required, as thin iron wires 1/3 of an inch apart\r\nencircle lengthwise the entire basket, preventing the escape of any\r\nmarketable quahaugs, while at the same time allowing mud and sand to\r\nwash out. This rake has 16 steel teeth, 1½ inches long, fitted at\r\nintervals of 1 inch on the scraping bar. The depth of the basket is\r\nabout 8 inches. Short poles not exceeding 30 feet in length are used,\r\nas the raking is carried on in water which does not exceed 25 feet in\r\ndepth. Only the iron framework of the rake is shown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =The Claw Quahaug Rake.=--This rake varies greatly in\r\nsize and length. Its use is chiefly confined to Nantucket. The general\r\nstyle has a handle 6 feet long, while the iron part, in the form of a\r\nclaw or talon, with prongs 1 inch apart, is 10 inches wide. A heavier\r\nrake, as here shown, is sometimes used in the deeper water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =The Scallop Rake.=--The use of this rake is confined\r\nalmost exclusively to the town of Chatham. Both scallops and quahaugs\r\ncan be taken with it. The bowl is formed by a curve of the prongs,\r\nwhich are held together by two long cross bars at the top and bottom\r\nof the basket, while the ends are enclosed by short strips of iron.\r\nHandles from 15 to 20 feet long are generally used with this rake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Rowley Reef Clam Set.=--This photograph shows the\r\nsurface of Rowley Reef, one of the flats of Plum Island Sound. In the\r\nsummer of 1906 a heavy set of clams was found on this flat, averaging\r\n1,500 to the square foot of surface. These rapidly diminished, and one\r\nyear later, Aug. 27, 1907, when this photograph was taken, the clams\r\nnumbered about 400 to the square foot. This area furnished an excellent\r\nillustration of the great destruction of natural clam set. Only 5 per\r\ncent. of these clams reached maturity, and the remaining 95 per cent.,\r\ndestroyed by natural agencies, could have been saved if proper measures\r\nhad been taken. At least 100 acres of the barren flats of Rowley could\r\nhave been planted with the \"seed\" from this flat, and after two years\r\nthe crop would have been worth $30,000. The present shellfish laws of\r\nthe Commonwealth are alone to blame for this waste. The clam hoe shown\r\nin the foreground is the typical digger or \"hooker\" of the North Shore\r\nclammer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Rowley Reef.=--This photograph, taken on the same date\r\nas the preceding, shows another section of the reef, where the clam set\r\nhas been torn up and destroyed by horse-shoe crabs and cockles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Rowley Reef.=--A photograph, natural size, of a thickly\r\nset part of the same flat. The broken shells on top show clams which\r\nhave been crowded out of the sand and destroyed. In this way nature\r\nregulates the number of clams in a given area.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Castle Neck Flat= (=Essex River=).--A scene at low\r\ntide, Aug. 28, 1907, showing the area turned over by two clammers in\r\none hour. At this date there was a heavy set of small clams on this\r\nflat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Plymouth Harbor.=--This photograph was taken at low\r\ntide, from the boat house of Mr. Frank Cole. In the foreground are a\r\nfew of the experimental clam beds of the Massachusetts department of\r\nfisheries and game. Note the large tracts of eel grass covering the\r\nflats.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Cole's Clam Grant.=--This photograph shows a portion\r\nof the grant leased to Mr. Frank Cole by the town of Kingston for\r\nthe propagation of clams. Several of the experimental beds of the\r\nMassachusetts department of fisheries and game were situated on this\r\ngrant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Clam Spat Box.=--This box was suspended from a raft\r\nduring the summer of 1907. The small clams which were caught in it are\r\nheaped before the box. These clams vary in size from ½ to 2 inches in\r\nlength, showing that the spawning season is at least of two months'\r\nduration. The spat box was put down May 15 and taken up October 15.\r\nNote the barnacles, silver shells (_Anomia_), etc., on the box and\r\nrope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =A Clam Shanty.=--The shanty of Samuel Kilbourn, an\r\nexperienced Ipswich clammer. The large heap of shells is the result of\r\nsix weeks of steady digging. Numerous shanties of this sort are used\r\nfor \"shucking out\" clams when marketed by the gallon. This photograph\r\nalso shows the clam sifter which was used in obtaining the small \"seed\"\r\nclams from Rowley Reef for the experimental beds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Taking up One of the Clam Gardens of the Massachusetts\r\nDepartment of Fisheries and Game.=--The bed was planted Nov. 15, 1905,\r\nin Essex River, on a sand flat locally known as \"Newfoundland.\" When\r\nthe bed was planted the flat was considered barren, as it produced\r\npractically no clams. The photograph was obtained Nov. 15, 1907, when\r\nthe bed was taken up, and shows the clammers at work. Note the heaps of\r\nmarketable clams which were taken from the bed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Yield in Two Years of the Garden shown in the Preceding\r\nPhotograph.=--Note the amount of clams planted, compared with the\r\nmarketable clams taken out. The size of the bed was 1/100 of an acre.\r\nThe clams had increased in size so that 8 quarts were obtained for\r\nevery quart planted. This shows what could be done with many barren\r\nflats if individuals had the privilege of cultivating clam farms.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =The Winkle or Cockle= (=Lunatia heros and\r\nduplicata=).--An enemy of the clam, which it destroys by boring a hole\r\nthrough the shell and sucking out the contents.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Clam Growth.=--This photograph gives a comparison\r\nbetween the growth of small and large clams from a single bed under the\r\nsame natural conditions. The large clam shows a much slower growth than\r\nthe small. Both clams were notched when planted on the \"Spit\" in Essex\r\nRiver, April 18, 1907. They were dug Aug. 28, 1907.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Soft-shelled Clam= (=Mya arenaria=).--This large\r\nclam shell, measuring 5¾ inches in length, was found on Grey's Flat,\r\nKingston. Where the flat has been worn away by erosion the ground is\r\nwhite with thousands of these shells in an upright position in the\r\nsoil, showing that sudden destruction had overtaken them at some time\r\nin the past.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Quahaugs from an Experimental Bed at Monomoy Point,\r\nshowing Two Years' Growth.=--The two notches or file marks on the\r\nshells indicate the growth per year. The photograph is two-thirds life\r\nsize. These quahaugs have shown rapid growth, having gained nearly 1\r\ninch a year in length, which is the best growth thus far found in any\r\nof the experimental beds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Gathering \"Seed\" Oysters in the Weweantit River,\r\nWareham, May 6, 1908.=--The natural beds of the town of Wareham had\r\nbeen closed for seven years, and on this date were opened for the\r\nperiod of one week for the inhabitants of the town to gather \"seed\"\r\noysters, the photograph was taken on the opening day, and shows the\r\noystermen at work tonging the \"seed\" oysters. In the foreground is a\r\nloaded skiff, ready to have its contents estimated by the inspector,\r\nwho declares the number of bushels. The tongers pay the town 10 cents\r\nper bushel for the privilege of gathering the oysters, and sell them\r\nfor 35 cents per bushel to the planters, thus realizing a profit of 25\r\ncents.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Typical Steam Dredger.=--The oyster boat of Mr. James\r\nMonahan of Wareham, showing oyster dredge and hoist.
