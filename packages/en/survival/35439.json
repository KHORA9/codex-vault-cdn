W. J. ROCHE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR,\r\nOTTAWA, CANADA. 1914\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND REGULATIONS IN CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nAll public lands in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta are controlled\r\nand administered by the Dominion Government through the Department of\r\nthe Interior. The lands disposed of as free homesteads (Government\r\ngrants) under certain conditions involving residence and improvements,\r\nare surveyed into square blocks, six miles long by six miles wide,\r\ncalled townships. When these improvements are completed and duties\r\nperformed, a patent or crown deed is issued.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOLLOWING IS A PLAN OF A TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\n                          N\r\n                  SIX MILES SQUARE\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n  W |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | E\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n                          S\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing how the land is divided into square sections and\r\nsquare quarter-sections. Also showing how the sections in a township are\r\nnumbered.]\r\n\r\nEach township is subdivided into 36 square blocks or sections one mile\r\nsquare and containing 640 acres and numbered from one to thirty-six.\r\nEach section is divided into four quarter-sections of 160 acres each.\r\n\r\nThe four quarters of the section are described, as the northeast, the\r\nnorthwest, the southeast and the southwest quarter.\r\n\r\n=Who Is Eligible.= The sole head of a family or any male eighteen years of\r\nage or over, who is a British subject or who declares his intention to\r\nbecome a British subject; a widow having minor children of her own\r\ndependent upon her for support.\r\n\r\n=Acquiring Homestead.= To acquire a homestead applicant must make entry in\r\nperson, either at the Dominion Lands Office for the district in which\r\nthe land applied for is situate, or at a sub-agency authorized to\r\ntransact business in such district. At the time of entry a fee of $10\r\nmust be paid. The certificate of entry which is then granted the\r\napplicant gives him authority to enter upon the land and maintain full\r\npossession of it as long as he complies with the homestead requirements.\r\n\r\n=Cattle Provision to Secure Homestead.= With certain restriction, stock\r\nmay be substituted in lieu of cultivation.\r\n\r\n=Residence.= To earn patent for homestead, a person must reside in a\r\nhabitable house upon the land for six months during each of three years.\r\nSuch residence however, need not be commenced before six months after\r\nthe date on which entry for the land was secured.\r\n\r\n=Improvement Duties.= Before being eligible to apply for patent, a\r\nhomesteader must break (plough up) thirty acres of the homestead, of\r\nwhich twenty acres must be cropped. It is also required that a\r\nreasonable proportion of this cultivation must be done during each\r\nhomestead year.\r\n\r\n=Application for Patent.= When a homesteader has completed his residence\r\nand cultivation duties he makes application for patent before the Agent\r\nof Dominion Lands for the district in which the homestead is situate, or\r\nbefore a sub-agent authorized to deal with lands in such district. If\r\nthe duties have been satisfactorily performed patent issues to the\r\nhomesteader shortly after without any further action on his part, and\r\nthe land thus becomes his absolute property.\r\n\r\n=Timber and Fuel.= An occupant of a homestead quarter-section, having no\r\nsuitable timber of his own, may obtain on payment of a 25-cent fee a\r\npermit to cut 3,000 lineal feet of building timber, 400 roof poles, 500\r\nfence posts, 2,000 fence rails. Homesteaders and all bona fide settlers,\r\nwithout timber on their own farms, may also obtain permits to cut dry\r\ntimber for their own use on their farms for fuel and fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS REGULATIONS\r\n\r\nA settler may bring into Canada, free of duty, live stock for the farm\r\non the following basis, if he has actually owned such live stock abroad\r\nfor at least six months before his removal to Canada, and has brought\r\nthem into Canada within one year after his first arrival viz: If horses\r\nonly are brought in, 16 allowed. If cattle are brought in, 16 allowed;\r\nif sheep are brought in 160 allowed; if swine are brought in, 160\r\nallowed. If horses, cattle, sheep and swine are brought in together, or\r\npart of each, the same proportions as above are to be observed.\r\n\r\nDuty is to be paid on live stock in excess of the number above provided\r\nfor. For customs entry purposes a mare with a colt under six months old\r\nis to be reckoned as one animal; a cow with a calf under six months old\r\nis also to be reckoned as one animal. Cattle and other live stock\r\nimported into Canada are subject to Quarantine Regulations.\r\n\r\nThe following articles have free entry:\r\n\r\nSettler' effects, free viz: Wearing apparel, household furniture, books,\r\nimplements and tools of trade, occupation, or employment: guns, musical\r\ninstruments, domestic sewing machines, typewriters, live stock,\r\nbicycles, carts, and other vehicles, and agricultural implements in use\r\nby the settler for at least six months before his removal to Canada, not\r\nto include machinery or articles imported for use in any manufacturing\r\nestablishment or for sale; also books, pictures, family plate or\r\nfurniture, personal effects, and heirlooms left by bequest; provided,\r\nthat any dutiable articles entered as settlers' effects may not be so\r\nentered unless brought with the settler on his first arrival, and shall\r\nnot be sold or otherwise disposed of without payment of duty until after\r\ntwelve months' actual use in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe settler will be required to take oath that all of the articles have\r\nbeen owned by himself or herself for at least six months before removal\r\nto Canada; and that none have been imported as merchandise, for use in a\r\nmanufacturing establishment or as a contractor's outfit, or for sale,\r\nand that he or she intend becoming a permanent settler within the\r\nDominion of Canada, and that the \"Live Stock\" enumerated is intended for\r\nhis or her own use on the farm which he or she is about to occupy (or\r\ncultivate), and not for sale or speculative purposes, nor for the use of\r\nany other person or persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREIGHT REGULATIONS\r\n\r\n1. Carloads of Settlers' Effects, the property of the settler, may be\r\nmade up of the following described property for the benefit of actual\r\nsettlers, viz: Live stock, any number up to but not exceeding ten (10)\r\nhead, all told, viz: Cattle, calves, sheep, hogs, mules, or horses (the\r\ncustoms will admit free of duty in numbers referred to in Customs\r\nparagraph above, but railway regulations only permit ten head in each\r\ncar); Household Goods and personal property (second-hand); Wagons or\r\nother vehicles for personal use (second-hand); Farm Machinery,\r\nImplements, and Tools (all second-hand); Soft-wood Lumber (Pine,\r\nHemlock, or Spruce--only) and Shingles, which must not exceed 2,000 feet\r\nin all, or the equivalent thereof; or in lieu of, not in addition to the\r\nlumber and shingles, a Portable House may be shipped; Seed Grain, small\r\nquantity of trees or shrubbery; small lot live poultry or pet animals;\r\nand sufficient feed for the live stock while on the journey. Settlers'\r\nEffects rates, however, will not apply on shipments of second-hand\r\nWagons, Buggies, Farm Machinery, Implements, or Tools, unless\r\naccompanied by Household Goods.\r\n\r\n2. Should the allotted number of live stock be exceeded, the additional\r\nanimals will be charged for at proportionate rates over and above the\r\ncarload rate for the Settlers' Effects, but the total charge for any one\r\nsuch car will not exceed the regular rate for a straight carload of Live\r\nStock.\r\n\r\n3. Passes--One man will be passed free in charge of live stock when\r\nforming part of carloads, to feed, water, and care for them in transit.\r\nAgents will use the usual form of Live Stock Contract.\r\n\r\n4. Less than carloads will be understood to mean only Household Goods\r\n(second-hand), Wagons or other vehicles for personal use (second-hand),\r\nand (second-hand) Farm Machinery, Implements, and Tools. Less than\r\ncarload lots must be plainly addressed. Minimum charge on any shipment\r\nwill be 100 pounds at regular first-class rate.\r\n\r\n5. Merchandise, such as groceries, provisions, hardware, etc., also\r\nimplements, machinery, vehicles, etc., if new, will not be regarded as\r\nSettlers' Effects, and, if shipped, will be charged at the regular\r\nclassified tariff rates. Agents, both at loading and delivering\r\nstations, therefore, give attention to the prevention of the loading of\r\nthe contraband articles and see that the actual weights are way-billed\r\nwhen carloads exceed 24,000 lbs. on lines north of St. Paul.\r\n\r\n6. Top Loads.--Agents do not permit, under any circumstances, any\r\narticle to be loaded on the top of box or stock cars; such manner of\r\nloading is dangerous and absolutely forbidden.\r\n\r\n7. Settlers' Effects, to be entitled to the carload rates, cannot be\r\nstopped at any point short of destination for the purpose of unloading\r\npart. The entire carload must go through to the station to which\r\noriginally consigned.\r\n\r\n8. The carload rates on Settlers' Effects apply on any shipment\r\noccupying a car weighing 24,000 pounds or less. If the carload weighs\r\nover 24,000 lbs. the additional weight will be charged for. North of St.\r\nPaul, Minn., 24,000 lbs. constitutes a carload, between Chicago and St.\r\nPaul and Kansas City or Omaha and St. Paul a carload is 20,000 lbs. From\r\nChicago and Kansas City north to St. Paul any amount over this will be\r\ncharged extra. From points South and East of Chicago, only five horses\r\nor heads of live stock are allowed in carloads, any over this will be\r\ncharged extra; carload 12,000 lbs. minimum.\r\n\r\n9. Minimum charge on any shipment will be 100 lbs. at first-class rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARANTINE OF SETTLERS' CATTLE\r\n\r\nSettlers' cattle must be inspected at the boundary. Inspectors may\r\nsubject any cattle showing symptoms of tuberculosis to the tuberculin\r\ntest before allowing them to enter. Any cattle found tuberculous to be\r\nreturned to the United States or killed without indemnity. Settlers'\r\nhorses are admitted on inspection if accompanied by certificate of\r\nmallein test signed by a United States Inspector of Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustries, without which they will be inspected at the boundary free of\r\ncharge by a Canadian Officer. Settler should apply to Canadian\r\nGovernment Office for name of Inspector nearest him. Certificate of any\r\nother Veterinarian will not be accepted. Horses found to be affected\r\nwith glanders within six months of entry are slaughtered without\r\ncompensation. Sheep may be admitted subject to inspection at port of\r\nentry. If disease is discovered to exist in them, they may be returned\r\nor slaughtered. Swine may be admitted, when forming part of Settlers'\r\nEffects, but only after a quarantine of thirty days, and when\r\naccompanied by a certificate that swine plague or hog cholera has not\r\nexisted in the district whence they came for six months preceding the\r\ndate of shipment; when not accompanied by such certificate, they must be\r\nsubject to inspection at port of entry. If diseased to be slaughtered,\r\nwithout compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES AGENTS.\r\n\r\n     =M. V. MacINNES=, 176 Jefferson Ave., Detroit, Mich.\r\n\r\n     =C. A.

Its millions of acres of land, easily cultivable, highly\r\nproductive, accessible to railways, and with unexcelled climatic\r\nconditions, offer something too great to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta have the largest\r\narea of desirable lands in North America, with but 8 per cent under the\r\nplough. Their cultivation has practically just begun. A few years ago\r\nthe wheat crop amounted to only 71 million bushels. To-day, with only 4\r\nper cent of the available area in wheat, the crop is over 209 million\r\nbushels. What, then, will 44 per cent produce?\r\n\r\nThen look at immigration. In 1901 it was 49,149, of which 17,000 were\r\nfrom the United States; in 1906 it was 189,064, of which 57,000 were\r\nAmericans; in 1913 it was about 400,000, about 125,000 being Americans.\r\nWhy did these Americans go to Canada? Because the American farmer, like\r\nhis Canadian cousin, is a shrewd business man. When an American can sell\r\nhis farm at from $100 to $200 per acre and homestead in Canada for\r\nhimself and for each of his sons who are of age, 160 acres of fertile\r\nland, capable of producing several bushels more to the acre than he has\r\never known, he will be certain to make the change.\r\n\r\nAnd then, following the capital of brawn, muscle, and sinew, comes\r\nAmerican capital, keeping in touch with the industrious farmer with whom\r\nit has had dealings for many years. These two, with farming experience,\r\nare no small factors in a country's upbuilding. Nothing is said of the\r\ngreat mineral and forest wealth, little of which has been touched.\r\n\r\nIn so short a time, no country in the world's history has attracted to\r\nits borders so large a number of settlers prepared to go on the land, or\r\nso much wealth, as have the Canadian prairies. Never before has\r\npioneering been accomplished under conditions so favourable as those in\r\nWestern Canada to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is not only into the prairie provinces that these people go, but many\r\ncontinue westward to the great trees and mountains, and fertile valleys,\r\nthe glory of British Columbia, where can be grown agricultural products\r\nof almost every kind, and where fruit is of great importance. The vast\r\nexpanse of the plains attracts hundreds of thousands who at once set to\r\nwork to cultivate their large holdings. But man's work, even in the\r\ncities with their record-breaking building rush, is the smallest part of\r\nthe great panorama that unfolds on a journey through the country. Nature\r\nis still supreme, and man is still the divine pigmy audaciously seeking\r\nto impose his will and stamp his mark upon an unconquered half\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n=THE HOMEMAKING SPIRIT.=--The most commendable feature in Western\r\ndevelopment to-day is the \"homemaking spirit.\" The people are finding\r\nhappiness in planting trees, making gardens, building schools, colleges,\r\nand universities, and producing an environment so homelike that the\r\ncountry cannot be regarded as a temporary abode in which to make a\r\n\"pile\" preparatory to returning East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Confiding to his better half what they will do with the\r\nproceeds of their crop of wheat, which yielded 41-1/2 bushels per acre.]\r\n\r\n=THOUSANDS OF AVAILABLE HOMESTEADS.=--The desire of the American people to\r\nprocure land is strong. Agricultural lands of proved value have so\r\nadvanced in price that for the man with moderate means, who wishes to\r\nfarm, finding a suitable location has become a serious question.\r\nFortunately, in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, there are yet\r\nthousands of free homesteads of 160 acres each, which may be had by\r\nthe simple means of filing, paying a ten-dollar entrance fee, and living\r\non the land for six months each year for three years. No long,\r\npreliminary journey, tedious, expensive, and hazardous, is necessary.\r\nThis homesteading has been going on in Canada for several years, and\r\nhundreds of thousands of claims have been taken up, but much good land\r\nstill is unoccupied. Many consider the remaining claims among the best.\r\nThey comprise lands in the park districts of each of the three\r\nprovinces, where natural groves give a beauty to the landscape. Here\r\nwheat, oats, barley, and flax can be grown successfully, and the\r\ndistricts are admirably adapted to mixed farming. Cattle fatten on the\r\nnutritious grasses; dairying can be carried on successfully; timber for\r\nbuilding is within reach, and water easy to procure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the free grant lands, there are lands which may be\r\npurchased from railways and private companies and individuals. These\r\nlands have not increased in price as their productivity and location\r\nmight warrant, and may still be had for reasonably low sums and on easy\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nNowhere else in the world are there such splendid opportunities for\r\nindulgence in the land-passion as in Western Canada. Millions of rich\r\nacres beckon for occupation and cultivation. Varying soil and climate\r\nare suited to contrary requirements--grazing lands for the stock\r\nbreeder; deep-tilling soils for the market gardener; rolling, partly\r\nwooded districts for the mixed-farming advocate; level prairie for the\r\ngrain farmer; bench lands and hillsides for the cultivator of fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER GOOD YEAR IN WESTERN CANADA\r\n\r\nManitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta Have Splendid Crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grain crop of 1913 was harvested and threshed in perfect condition.\r\nExcepting flax, the average yield was excellent; wheat almost\r\nuniversally graded near the top. Wheat from many fields averaged forty\r\nbushels per acre, weighing sixty-five pounds to the measured bushel.\r\nOats ran from fifty to one hundred and fifteen bushels to the acre, and\r\nbarley kept up the reputation of Western Canada as a producer of that\r\ncereal. In many sections the yield of flax exceeded earlier\r\nexpectations, although in places, winds which blew off the boll caused\r\nsome loss. Hundreds of farmers of small means who have been in the\r\ncountry only three or four years, paid up all their indebtedness out of\r\nthe crop of 1913 and put aside something for farm and home improvements.\r\nNot only for the farmer with limited means and small acreage has the\r\nyear been prosperous; the man able to conduct farming on a large scale\r\nhas been equally successful--and for such, Western Canada offers many\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nA farmer in southern Alberta raised 350,000 bushels of grain last year,\r\nand made a fortune out of it. In Saskatchewan and in Manitoba is heard\r\nthe same story of the successful working of large areas.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected with its unprecedented development, the financial\r\nstress during 1913 was felt as keenly throughout Western Canada as\r\nanywhere in the country. The fact is that money could not keep pace with\r\nthe natural demands of 400,000 new people a year. Towns and cities had\r\nto be built, farming operations were extensive, and capitalists had not\r\nmade sufficient preparation. But last year's crop has restored\r\nconditions to a normal state, and natural and reasonable development\r\nwill continue.\r\n\r\nOwing to a wet fall in 1912 and a heavy snowfall the succeeding winter,\r\nseeding in some districts was later than usual. But with the favourable\r\nweather of May, June, and July, wheat sown in May ripened early in\r\nAugust. Rains came at the right time, and throughout the season the best\r\nof weather prevailed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These cattle winter out in Western Canada and do well.\r\nShelter and water are abundant.]\r\n\r\n=The Cities Reflect the Growth of the Country.=--Passing through Western\r\nCanada from Winnipeg, and observing the cities and towns along the\r\nnetwork of railways in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, one feels\r\nthere must be \"something of a country\" behind them all. Gaze in any\r\ndirection and the same view is presented: field after field of waving\r\ngrain; labourers at work converting the virgin prairie into more fields;\r\nwide pasture lands where cattle are fattening on grasses rich in both\r\nmilk- and beef-producing properties. Here is the wealth that builds the\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nIn thirty years Winnipeg has increased in population from 2,000 to\r\n200,000; and become an important gateway of commerce. The wheat alone\r\ngrown in the three prairie provinces in 1913 is sufficient to keep a\r\nsteady stream of 1,000 bushels per minute continuously night and day\r\ngoing to the head of the lakes for three and a half months, and in\r\naddition to that, the oats and barley would supply this stream for\r\nanother four months. The value of the grain crop alone would be\r\nsufficient to build any of our great transcontinental railroads and all\r\ntheir equipment, everything connected with them, from ocean to ocean.\r\nWith only 10 per cent of the arable land under cultivation, what will\r\nthe possibilities be when 288 million acres of the best land that the\r\nsun shines on is brought under the plough? Do you not see the portent of\r\na great, vigorous, populous nation living under those sunny skies north\r\nof the 49th parallel?\r\n\r\n=New Railway Mileage Grows at Rapid Rate.=--Every year long stretches of\r\nnew rails are extended into some hitherto untravelled domain, bringing\r\ninto subjugation mountain, plain, and forest. Mighty rivers are being\r\nbridged, massive mountains are being tunnelled, and real zest is being\r\ngiven this work in the exciting race between the rival companies as they\r\nstrive to outstrip each other in surmounting Nature's obstacles. During\r\n1913, more than 4,000 miles of new road have been built in Canada, the\r\nbulk of this in Western Canada.\r\n\r\nThe latest reports give the total railway mileage in Manitoba,\r\nSaskatchewan, and Alberta as 12,760 miles, the Canadian Pacific Railway\r\nhaving 5,534; the Canadian Northern, 4,187; the Grand Trunk Pacific,\r\n1,476; the Great Northern Railway, 162. Manitoba has a total mileage of\r\n4,014; Saskatchewan, 5,679; Alberta, 3,073. The gain over 1912 is about\r\n3,400 miles.\r\n\r\n=Western Canada's Wheat.=--The quality of Western Canada wheat is\r\nrecognized everywhere. Recently a U. S. senator said of the Canadian\r\ngrain fields: \"The wheat that Canada raises is the Northwestern hard\r\nspring wheat. The cost of raising is less in Canada than in the States,\r\nbecause the new lands there will produce larger crops than the older\r\nland on this side of the line, and the land is cheaper than in the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to official figures the total estimated wheat production of\r\nWestern Canada in 1913 was 209,262,000 bushels, an increase of more than\r\n5 million bushels in 1912. Oats show a total yield of more than\r\n242,413,000 bushels, barley more than 30 million bushels, rye more than\r\n2,500,000 bushels, flax more than 14 million bushels, and mixed grains\r\nmore than 17 million bushels. Wheat, oats, barley, and rye are above the\r\naverage quality of the last two years, and potatoes and root crops show\r\na good percentage of standard condition during growth. The value of the\r\nharvest is approximately 209 million dollars as compared with about 200\r\nmillion in 1912.\r\n\r\nWinnipeg, the grain centre of Western Canada, has received and handled\r\nmore wheat per day than Chicago, Minneapolis, and Duluth combined.\r\n\r\nApproximately 191 million bushels of grain were shipped from the\r\nelevators at Fort William and Port Arthur during the season of\r\nnavigation; from the first of September, 1913, until December 20, 127\r\nmillion bushels of grain were shipped to the east--52,000,000 bushels\r\nmore than for the same period last year.\r\n\r\n=What Farmers Receive.=--The amount of grain marketed, and the estimated\r\nreceipts, based on an average price for September, October, and\r\nNovember, are as follows:\r\n\r\n               Bushels        Price per bushel\r\n\r\n  Wheat      97,000,000        .73    $70,000,000\r\n\r\n  Oats       30,000,000        .30      9,000,000\r\n\r\n  Barley      9,500,000        .40      3,800,000\r\n\r\n  Flax        6,500,000      $1.10      7,150,000\r\n\r\n  Total                               $89,950,000\r\n\r\n=A Splendid Fall.=--The fall of 1913 was exceedingly favourable to the\r\nfarmer of Western Canada. The weather made it possible to harvest and\r\nthresh in the minimum of time, and in some cases permitted a start on\r\nfall ploughing early in September, in many parts continuing until\r\nDecember 1st. Owners of traction engines took advantage of clear nights\r\nto plough, the powerful headlights throwing a brilliant light across the\r\nfields. The men worked in relays, and it was frequently midnight before\r\nthe big outfits quit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beginning a home in the prairie--house and table \"lands\"\r\nare built on cement foundation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sizing up quantity of hay per acre he would get from his\r\nhayfield.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Starting from town with loads of posts for pasture\r\nfence.]\r\n\r\n=Mixed Farming.=--Mixed farming is yielding large profits to those who\r\nwork intelligently along the lines of intensive farming. In addition to\r\nwheat, oats, barley, and flax--alfalfa and other fodder crops are grown,\r\nand in some places corn.\r\n\r\nEvery variety of vegetable grows abundantly and sugar beets are a\r\nmoneymaker. Stock-raising is an important branch of mixed farming, and\r\nhogs and sheep are commanding high prices, the demand greatly exceeding\r\nthe supply.\r\n\r\n=Sheep.=--The sheep industry in Western Canada pays exceedingly well. In\r\nthe early days--but a few short years ago--a district south of the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway from Swift Current to Maple Creek was stocked\r\nwith sheep, and several large ranches made money, but with the onrush of\r\nsettlement these ranches have been vacated and are now given up to\r\nsuccessful grain growing. However, the farmers who now cross the\r\nboundary to purchase the best Montana breeds and take them to their\r\nfarms, in every case report a success as great as that in grain growing.\r\nAlthough no country could be better fitted for sheep raising, and\r\nnumerous successes have been made, Western Canada imports much of its\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\n=Profits in Horse Raising.=--The raising of horses is receiving increasing\r\nattention. Here also a rare opportunity for profit exists, for the\r\nmarket is woefully unsupplied.\r\n\r\n=Dairying= offers splendid opportunities for profit. In the rapidly\r\ngrowing cities and towns there is a demand for milk, cream, and butter.\r\nCreameries and cheese factories are established at accessible points.\r\nThe feeding of cattle is nominal.\r\n\r\n=Poultry Products= can be readily marketed, and poultry raisers have done\r\nremarkably well. No one knows better than the farmer's wife the saving\r\neffected by having a flock of hens, some turkeys, geese and ducks, and\r\nthe cost of feed is not noticed.\r\n\r\n=Hog Raising.=--Hog-raising has equal advantages with grain growing. A\r\nlarge quantity of pork that should be supplied at home is now shipped\r\nin. Barley, the best staple for hog raising, is easily grown and yields\r\nheavily. Alfalfa can be grown with little trouble, and with two crops in\r\na season, and three tons to the acre to a crop, it will play an\r\nimportant part in the hog industry of the future. The Canadian field pea\r\nand the rape, also are good feed and produce the very best of pork.\r\n\r\nChas. Reid, of Swift Current, who sold a thousand dollars' worth of pork\r\nlast summer, and then had considerable on hand, has demonstrated that\r\nhogs pay better than straight grain raising. He has an income from his\r\nfarm the whole year round.\r\n\r\nA farmer near Moose Jaw sold some hogs for $130.00. To the question,\r\n\"What did they cost?\" he answered: \"Really nothing. I bought one sow; I\r\nhave kept two, and I have three to kill for my own use. Of course we had\r\nskim milk and buttermilk, and I fed some chop, but what is left is worth\r\nall I paid out. I call the $130.00 clear profit.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the same story in all parts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and\r\nAlberta. A little attention, plenty of such grain as would go to waste,\r\nsome shelter, and that's all. Last year many farmers went into\r\nhog-raising extensively, and it saved many of them from financial\r\nembarrassment; for when money was not obtainable at the banks, farmers\r\nhaving marketable hogs sold them with handsome profit. Several made from\r\n$1.00 to $1.20 per bushel for wheat by feeding it to hogs.\r\n\r\n=Butter and Eggs.=--Large sums are spent regularly in United States\r\nmarkets for butter and eggs to supply the cities and towns of Western\r\nCanada, and large quantities of butter are imported from New Zealand.\r\nNot only is the demand in the towns, but many wheat-raisers purchase\r\nthese commodities when they might produce them on their own farms at\r\ntrifling cost.\r\n\r\nWilliam Elliott, near Moose Jaw, has eight cows and eighty hens. In less\r\nthan eight months, his butter and eggs sold for more than $500. All the\r\ngroceries and the children's clothing and boots, are paid for with\r\nbutter and egg money.\r\n\r\nW. H. Johnston, five miles south of Moose Jaw, has thirty cows and milks\r\nan average of twenty-five. His gross receipts last summer were from $600\r\nto $700 per month, of which $300 was profit. He grows his own feed,\r\nprincipally oats and hay, and has no worries over harvesting or grain\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n=Truck Gardening.=--Long days of abundant sunshine from May to September,\r\nand adequate moisture in the spring and early summer permit of a wide\r\nvariety of products. The soil is rich and warm, and easily worked. Close\r\nattention to cultivation has resulted in record yields of vegetables and\r\nsmall fruits, which bring good prices in the cities.\r\n\r\nA farmer within five miles of Moose Jaw, who sold vegetables at the city\r\nmarket last year realized more than $300 between August 1, and October\r\n30. He had half an acre in carrots, cabbage, cauliflower, radishes,\r\nbeans, lettuce and onions, and half an acre in potatoes and turnips. His\r\nown table was supplied all summer and enough vegetables were put in the\r\ncellar to supply him during the winter and seed potatoes in the spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. P. O. Uwell's old home, Clover Bar, Alberta. This old\r\nhome is now replaced by one of more modern structure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A comfortable modern home in Western Canada, the old home\r\nnow used as a granary. William Hamilton--Pioneer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Segar Wheeler's residence \"Rosthern,\" Sask. is a fair\r\ntype of many homes in the Canadians.]\r\n\r\n=Corn Can Be Grown on Canadian Prairies.=--Manitoba is producing corn,\r\nchiefly for feed. On September 28, corn nine feet high had developed to\r\nthe dough stage, and the crop would easily exceed twenty tons to the\r\nacre. There are also scattered fields of corn in Saskatchewan and\r\nAlberta.\r\n\r\nCorn is successfully grown in the northern part of Minnesota in similar\r\nsoil and under the same climatic condition, and there is no apparent\r\nreason why like results should not be secured in Western Canada. Many\r\nAmerican farmers of experience believe the corn belt is extending\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\n=Alfalfa= is an assured crop in many parts of Western Canada and is\r\ndestined to be the leading forage crop. In a recent competition\r\nforty-three entries were made, and every field was one of which farmers\r\nof the older alfalfa countries might be proud. In southern Alberta\r\nalfalfa is a success; at Edmonton it grows abundantly. Battleford,\r\nPrince Albert, Regina, Indian Head, Lacombe, Brandon, and in many other\r\ndistricts alfalfa is grown.\r\n\r\n=Post Offices.=--Throughout the settled portions of Western Canada are\r\nfound post offices at which mails are delivered regularly, thus bringing\r\nEastern friends within a few days' reach of those who have gone forward\r\nto make homes under new but favourable conditions on the fertile lands\r\nof the West. Last year hundreds of new post offices were established,\r\nmany of them at points remote from the railway, but all demanded by new\r\nsettlements made during the year.\r\n\r\n=Roads and Bridges.=--It is said to be the policy of the Canadian\r\nGovernment to do everything possible for the welfare of the settler,\r\nwhether in accessible new town or remote hamlet. This solicitude is\r\nshown in every branch dealing with the organizing of new districts.\r\nBridges have been built, roads constructed, the district policed, and a\r\ndozen other conveniences provided. Is it any wonder that with the\r\nsplendid, high-yielding land, free to the homesteader or open to\r\npurchase at reasonable prices from railway and land companies, the\r\nCanadian immigration records for 1913 were so high?\r\n\r\n=Land Laws=.--Canada's land laws were formed after the United States had\r\napplied its methods to the free lands of the West, and embody the best\r\nUnited States provisions. They are so framed as not to bear heavily on\r\nthe settler, whose interests are carefully watched, and are liberally\r\nadministered. After several years' trial they have proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nTitles, or patents, come from the Crown, and on being registered in a\r\nLand Titles Office these patents secure a transfer.\r\n\r\nTaxes outside of cities, towns, and the larger municipalities, are\r\nmerely nominal and are devoted entirely to the improvement of roads, to\r\neducational purposes, to the payment of salaries, and to the erection\r\nof public buildings. At least 50 per cent of these costs, and in small\r\nstruggling communities, 60 per cent or more, is paid by the Government\r\nout of the fund produced by the sale of school lands, one-eighth of the\r\ncountry having been reserved for that purpose.\r\n\r\n=The Banks of Canada.=--The close of 1913 has brought the usual bank\r\nstatements accompanied by the addresses of the presidents and general\r\nmanagers of these institutions. They deal with economic matters first\r\nhand, and show in striking manner the prosperity of the country. Those\r\nwho know anything of Canadian banking methods know the stability of\r\nthese institutions, and the high character of the men in charge of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Coulson, of the Canadian Bank of Commerce says:\r\n\r\n     \"We have had a good harvest. The yield has been generally\r\n     good, and the quality on the average has never been\r\n     surpassed. This has been especially so in the Western\r\n     Provinces, and the unusually favourable weather and abundant\r\n     transportation facilities afforded by the railroads enabled\r\n     the movement of grain to be made rapidly.\"\r\n\r\n=Canada's New Bank Act.=--During 1913 the decennial revision of the Bank\r\nAct took place. Among important changes were:\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Central Gold Reserves. Authority to lend to\r\nfarmers on their threshed grain.\r\n\r\nThe provision which enables a bank to lend to a farmer on the security\r\nof his threshed grain is extensively utilized. This class of loan is\r\nregarded as a moral risk, and banks still depend more upon the character\r\nof the borrower than upon the security.\r\n\r\n=What Bank Managers Have to Say.=--Mr. Balfour, manager of the Union Bank\r\nof Canada:\r\n\r\n     \"The railway companies have carried out the grain from the\r\n     Western Provinces this year in a very satisfactory manner.\"\r\n\r\nMr. John Galt, president of the Union Bank of Canada:\r\n\r\n     \"Speaking generally, the crop results have been satisfactory.\r\n     In the three great wheat growing provinces this has been a\r\n     banner year. Not only has the yield been large, but the\r\n     average quality has never been equalled, and the cost of\r\n     harvesting has been unusually low, owing to the magnificent\r\n     weather. This has, to some extent, offset the low prices\r\n     which prevailed. The railways have done splendid work in\r\n     handling the crop.\r\n\r\n     \"There is a marked increase in the number of livestock.\r\n     Farmers are becoming more fully alive to the advantages they\r\n     derive from this source and are realizing that their\r\n     borrowing credit is greatly enhanced if they can show a good\r\n     proportion of cattle in their assets, and banks should look\r\n     with favour on loans for the purchase and handling of\r\n     livestock.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Campbell, general manager of the Northern Crown Bank, gives\r\nstrong testimony of the wealth of Western Canada:\r\n\r\n     \"It is important at a time like the present for every\r\n     business concern, financial or otherwise, to show by its\r\n     statement that collections have been good. We may\r\n     congratulate ourselves upon the showing we have made in this.\r\n     Notwithstanding that we have made new loans amounting to\r\n     millions of dollars since the crop was harvested, our old\r\n     loans have been paid off so rapidly that our liquid assets\r\n     were not reduced.\r\n\r\n     \"This state of affairs is attributable to the fine weather we\r\n     have experienced in the West, which enabled the farmers to\r\n     harvest their grain early and quickly and to the unusual\r\n     rapidity with which the crop was moved by the railway\r\n     companies.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corn is not generally grown in Western Canada, but this\r\n320 acres shows a splendid yield, and considerable is now grown for\r\nfodder.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL PREMIERS ARE OPTIMISTIC\r\n\r\n     =Manitoba is Stronger.=--Sir Rodmond Roblin has no pessimism\r\n     regarding the outlook in Manitoba. He says: \"The improvements\r\n     upon farm and field excite the admiration of those interested\r\n     in agriculture, while our population has been very\r\n     considerably increased by a healthy, intelligent, and\r\n     industrious class of new-comers. Manitoba, is much stronger\r\n     financially, numerically, commercially, industrially and\r\n     educationally than she was in the year 1912. Her progress and\r\n     development are rapid, healthy, and permanent.\"\r\n\r\n     =Hope and Cheer in Saskatchewan.=--Hon. Walter Scott: \"The\r\n     sheet anchor of Saskatchewan is its soil, which (excluding,\r\n     of course, the far north) comprises a larger proportion of\r\n     land capable of sustaining a farming population than any area\r\n     of similar vastness on the globe. Nothing but inconceivable\r\n     recklessness and waste can prevent its remaining for all time\r\n     a great agricultural province, and nothing can seriously\r\n     check its steady forward movement.\"\r\n\r\n     =Alberta on Sound Footing.=--Hon. A. L. Sifton: \"Alberta was\r\n     never on a sounder footing than it is to-day. It has reaped\r\n     the best crop in her history, and stands in line for her\r\n     share of the millions earned by the farmers of Western Canada\r\n     for their wheat and other grains. Coarse grains for feeding\r\n     purposes are beginning to predominate with the advent of\r\n     mixed farming. A gratifying increase in the number of dairy\r\n     cows and hogs is reported from every district, indicating a\r\n     new source of wealth, a more constant revenue for the farmer\r\n     and a new basis of credit for farming operations.\"\r\n\r\n     =Splendid Outlook in British Columbia.=--Sir Richard McBride\r\n     says: \"That British Columbia, judged by the healthy growth in\r\n     population and in general industries during the past year,\r\n     and the splendid outlook, may confidently be expected to have\r\n     increased prosperity in 1914. Mining will show a larger\r\n     output for the current year and the same may be said of\r\n     agriculture and other occupations. Generous and wise\r\n     expenditure for adding to the already extensive road system,\r\n     the building of necessary public works, as well as the\r\n     enormous amount of railway construction all conduce to the\r\n     opening up and settlement of immense areas, hitherto almost\r\n     dormant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPANAMA CANAL AND CANADA\r\n\r\n     =The London Times=, speaking of the Panama Canal, says:\r\n     \"Although there is considerable speculation in trade and\r\n     political circles as to the effect of the opening of the\r\n     Panama Canal, enthusiasts in the West predict that Western\r\n     Canada generally will increase in population and wealth to an\r\n     extent beyond conception. The Canal will have the effect of\r\n     bringing the outposts of Empire inside the commercial arena.\r\n     The new water route, combined with improved railway\r\n     facilities, will certainly improve the position of Western\r\n     Canada in the battle for the world's markets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT WESTERN CANADA\r\n\r\n     =Mr. James J. Hill.=--\"Within a few years the United States\r\n     will not be exporting any wheat, but it will become a market\r\n     for the wheat of Canada.\"\r\n\r\n     =Dr. Wm. Saunders=, Director of the Canadian Government\r\n     Experimental Farm at Ottawa, Canada: \"The Canadian Northwest\r\n     can supply not only sufficient wheat for a local population\r\n     of thirty millions, but have left over for export three times\r\n     as much as the total import of the British Isles. One-fourth\r\n     of its arable land is devoted to wheat.\"\r\n\r\n     =Professor Shaw.=--\"The first foot of soil in the provinces of\r\n     Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta is worth more than all the\r\n     mines from Alaska to Mexico, and more than all the forests\r\n     from the boundary to the Arctic ocean. One acre of the\r\n     average soil in Western Canada is worth more than ten acres\r\n     of average land in the United States.\"\r\n\r\n     =Professor Tanner.=--\"The black earth of Central Russia, the\r\n     richest soil in the world, has to yield its distinguished\r\n     position to rich, deep, fertile soil of Western Canada. Here\r\n     the most fertile soil of the world is to be found. These\r\n     soils are rich vegetable humus or clay loam with good clay\r\n     subsoil. To the high percentage of nitrogen is due the high\r\n     percentage of gluten which gives the 'Canadian No. 1 Hard'\r\n     the flouring qualities which have spread its fame abroad to\r\n     the ends of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n     =St. Paul Farmer.=--During a recent trip through Western\r\n     Canada, the editor of the _St. Paul Farmer_, in referring to\r\n     Government forces in agriculture, spoke of the interest that\r\n     the Dominion and the Provincial Governments took in farming\r\n     and farm education, as \"complete and effective.\"\r\n\r\n     =The General Manager= of a Canadian bank is reported to have\r\n     said that, \"owing to the speedy manner in which grain came\r\n     forward in the fall of 1913, our farmer customers in the\r\n     prairie provinces paid off about three million dollars of\r\n     liabilities between September 20, and October 10.\"\r\n\r\n     =Hon. W. T. White=, speaking at a New York meeting, said: \"We\r\n     used to give you good Canadians but now we are getting back\r\n     good Americans. Ours came from the east, yours are going into\r\n     our west. Some of the most practical citizens, the best\r\n     Canada has to-day, are the Americans. We received last year\r\n     no less than 140,000. Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, three\r\n     provinces, have each a larger territory than modern Germany,\r\n     less than ten per cent under cultivation. This year they had\r\n     a crop of over 200 million bushels of wheat. You cannot get\r\n     any country where contracts are more faithfully regarded or\r\n     obligations more carefully safeguarded by law than in\r\n     Canada.\"\r\n\r\n     =Sir Thomas Shaughnessy.=--\"Immigration into Canada cannot\r\n     cease, for it is due to economic conditions which show no\r\n     signs of changing.\"\r\n\r\n     =David R. Forgan.=--\"Nothing can check a country which can\r\n     raise the amount of wheat which has been raised in Western\r\n     Canada this year. Any checks which the country may have had\r\n     as a result of the world-wide money conditions are entirely\r\n     beneficial to the country. Numbers of young men, the sons of\r\n     farmers in the States, are now coming to Canada, and are\r\n     taking up land much cheaper and equally as good as they could\r\n     get in the States.\"\r\n\r\n     =Lord William Percy= of England: \"The possibilities and\r\n     opportunities offered by the West are infinitely greater than\r\n     those which exist in England.\"\r\n\r\n     =Colonel Donald Walter Cameron= of Lochiel, Scotland, Chief of\r\n     the Cameron Clan: \"We cannot blame our people for coming out\r\n     here, where there are so many opportunities as compared with\r\n     those afforded in Scotland. I thought possibly a trip through\r\n     Canada would give us some plan as to how to stop the\r\n     wholesale emigration from Scotland, but, after seeing this\r\n     wonderful country and the opportunities on every side, where\r\n     one man has as good chances as his neighbor, I have come to\r\n     the conclusion that nothing more can be done.\"\r\n\r\n     =Speaker Clark=.--In commenting on Speaker Clark's remarks\r\n     expressing regret at the number of Americans who had gone to\r\n     Canada in one week, the _Chicago News_ says: \"The appropriate\r\n     sentiment for the occasion would seem to be a God-speed to\r\n     the emigrants. They are acting as the American pioneers did\r\n     before them, and are taking what appears to them to be the\r\n     most promising step for improving their fortunes. The bait is\r\n     wild land, and it is not affected by national boundaries.\"\r\n\r\n     =Mayor Deacon,= Winnipeg: \"No man who sets foot in Canada is\r\n     more entirely and heartily welcome than the agriculturist\r\n     from the South.\"\r\n\r\nAn eminent American writer after a recent visit to the Canadian West in\r\nspeaking of the American immigration to Canada, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Any country that can draw our citizens to it on such a scale\r\n     must have about it something above the ordinary, and that\r\n     Canada has in many ways.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figuring out the result of the year's crop. The yield of\r\nwhich he estimates at over forty bushels per acre of wheat.]\r\n\r\n=Dean Curtiss= of Ames Agricultural College, Iowa, says:\r\n\r\n     \"We of the United States think we know how to get behind\r\n     agriculture and push, but the Canadians dare to do even more\r\n     than we do in some respects. They have wonderful faith in the\r\n     future: they hesitate at no undertaking that offers prospects\r\n     of results. More significant still is the wide co-operation\r\n     for agricultural promotion, including the government, private\r\n     individuals, and corporations and the railroads.\r\n\r\n     \"Manitoba has in the last two years provided about as much\r\n     money for the building of an agricultural plant as Iowa has\r\n     appropriated in half a century. It has given in two years\r\n     $2,500,000 for buildings and grounds for its agricultural\r\n     institutions. Saskatchewan is building a plant for its\r\n     university and agricultural college on a broader and more\r\n     substantial plan than has been applied to any similar\r\n     institution in this country. Yet neither province has more\r\n     than half a million population.\r\n\r\n     \"For public schools equally generous provision is made. They\r\n     are being built up to give vocational and technical training\r\n     as well as cultural. They fit the needs of the country\r\n     excellently and should turn out fine types of boys and girls.\r\n     They do this with a remarkable faith in the value of right\r\n     education.\"\r\n\r\nDean Curtiss was much interested in the many ways the Canadian\r\nGovernment aids agriculture, aside from appropriations for education. It\r\nis helping to solve marketing problems; encouraging better breeding of\r\nlivestock by buying sires and reselling them at cost, and doing many\r\nother things of like character. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"I found that the Government is advancing from 50 to 85 per\r\n     cent of the money necessary to build cooeperative creameries\r\n     and elevators. Where cattle need breeding up, the Government\r\n     buys bulls of dairy, Shorthorn, or special dairy breeds, and\r\n     sends them in at cost and long time payments.\"\r\n\r\nThe words \"Canadian wheat\" are familiar to all, but many have not yet\r\nparticipated in the benefits derived by those who, within the past few\r\nyears, have placed their capital in Canadian wheat lands. They, who,\r\nthrough foresight, so invested, they who broke the first furrow, have\r\nreaped bountifully.\r\n\r\nThe development of the fertile plains and valleys of Western Canada is\r\nstill in its infancy. The accomplishments of the past few years, while\r\ntruly wonderful, have but proven the great resources and future\r\ncapabilities of this vast country.\r\n\r\nThe growth of to-day will be insignificant compared with the\r\nachievements of the next few years.\r\n\r\nThe homestead shack is now giving place to the comfortable residence,\r\nlarge barns are being erected where the improvised log and mud stable\r\nsheltered a few head of cattle, fields are fenced, roads built, and\r\ngreat fields of grain and luxuriant pastures are always in evidence.\r\n\r\n=The Climate.=--Owing to the altitude, Western Canada is one of the finest\r\nand most healthful sections in the world. Speaking generally it is at\r\nleast a thousand feet higher above sea level than the Middle Western\r\nStates, thus giving a dry, bracing air, much like portions of Colorado.\r\nDuring a large part of the summer the days are hot and sunny, with more\r\nthan twenty hours of daylight and consequently growing weather, in each\r\nday. The nights, however, are always cool and restful and are largely\r\nresponsible for the splendid vitality of Western men.\r\n\r\nThe winters are truly splendid. Usually farming operations on the land\r\nare stopped by frost from the 12th to the 15th of November although some\r\nyears they have been continued into December. Usually late in November\r\nsnow falls, and with the exception of those districts where Chinook\r\nwinds are frequent, will remain until the following spring, disappearing\r\nearly in March. During this time there is clear, bright, dry, sunny\r\nweather and an intensely invigorating atmosphere. The average winter\r\ntemperature ranges from zero to twenty-two above zero, according to the\r\ndistrict. Occasionally severe cold weather will occur, lasting for two\r\nor three days, but this is not unknown in the Middle Western States. One\r\nof the greatest advantages is the hard frost, during the winter. This\r\nfreezes the ground to a depth of several feet. In the spring, thawing\r\nnaturally commences at the top. As soon as the top soil is sufficiently\r\nthawed the land is sown, the cultivation forming a mulch which conserves\r\nthe moisture in the frozen ground underneath. With the increasing warmth\r\nof early summer, the lower frost gradually thaws out and this moisture\r\naids largely in the growth of the young crop.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest rainfall occurs in June, when it is most needed and does\r\nthe most good to the growing crops. The rainfall of western Canada\r\nvaries from 16 to 28 inches. The farmers are usually working upon the\r\nland during the first week in April. This gives a long growing season\r\nand plenty of time to dispose of the crop and get the land prepared,\r\nready for the next season's operation.\r\n\r\n                METEOROLOGICAL RECORD FOR JANUARY, 1913\r\n\r\n                                             Precipi-\r\n  Experimental       Degrees of Temperature   tation       Hours of\r\n  Farm or            Highest  Lowest   Mean     in         Sunshine\r\n  Station at                                  Inches   Possible  Actual\r\n\r\n  Brandon, Man         36.9   -37.6   24.60     .11       268      73.6\r\n  Indian Head, Sask    40.0   -45.0   -6.51     .80       266      57.9\r\n  Rosthern, Sask       38.6   -49.5   13.30     .55       252      73.9\r\n  Scott, Sask          38.8   -48.8   -9.47     .59       255      83.9\r\n  Lacombe, Alta        45.3   -35.6     .67     .93       257      63.3\r\n  Lethbridge, Alta     47.0   -30.0    7.49     .80       269      91.9\r\n\r\n  DECEMBER, 1912\r\n\r\n  Brandon, Man         39.9    27.2    9.30    1.00       254      61.1\r\n  Indian Head, Sask    39.0    19.0   13.19    1.23       248      53.2\r\n  Rosthern, Sask       38.8    23.2    8.15     .50       233      62.4\r\n  Scott, Sask          44.1    19.8   16.86     .27       238      91.3\r\n  Lacombe, Alta        58.6    10.6   21.98     .03       238      7.42\r\n  Lethbridge, Alta     50.1     0.9   27.16     .23       254     102.3\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A scene showing farming on a large scale in the park\r\ndistricts of Western Canada.

That there might be no doubt as to the superiority\r\nof barley feeding, Manitoba climate, and judgment in selecting the\r\nanimal, in 1913 Mr. McGregor entered another Aberdeen-Angus, a\r\nhalf-brother to the winner of 1912, and secured a second victory. In\r\nother classes also Mr. McGregor had excellent winnings. Glencarnock's\r\nvictory proves not only the superiority of the new feeding, but that the\r\nclimate of the prairie provinces of Western Canada, in combination with\r\nthe rich foods possessed by that country, tends to make cattle raising a\r\nsuccess at little cost.\r\n\r\nOther winnings at the Live Stock Show which placed Western Canada in the\r\nclass of big victories were: three firsts, seven seconds, and five other\r\nprizes in Clydesdales.\r\n\r\nAmong recent victories won by Western Canada within the past three\r\nyears:\r\n\r\nIn February, 1911, Hill & Sons, of Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, showed a\r\npeck of oats at the National Corn Exposition in Columbus, Ohio, and\r\ncarried off the Colorado Silver Trophy, valued at $1,500.00. In\r\nFebruary, 1913, they had a similar victory at Columbia, N. C., the third\r\nand final winning was at Dallas, Texas, on February 17, 1914, when Hill\r\n& Son's oats defeated all other entries.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, Seager Wheeler, of Rosthern, won $1,000 in gold at the New York\r\nLand Show for best hundred pounds of wheat.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, at the Dry Farming Congress, Lethbridge, Mr. Holmes of Cardston\r\nwon an engine for best wheat in the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, at Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. P. Gerlack, of Allan, Saskatchewan,\r\ncarried off the honors and a threshing machine for the best bushel of\r\nwheat shown in a world competition. It was the Marquis variety and\r\nweighed 71 lbs. to the bushel. At this congress, Canada won a majority\r\nof the world's honours in individual classes, and seven out of the\r\nsixteen sweepstakes.\r\n\r\nOther first prizes taken at the same place were:\r\n\r\nBarley, Nicholas Tetinger, Claresholm, Alberta. Oats, E. J. Lanigan,\r\nElfross, Saskatchewan. Flax, John Plews, Carnduff, Saskatchewan. Sheaf\r\nof barley, A. H. Crossman, Kindersley, Saskatchewan. Sheaf of flax, R.\r\nC. West, Kindersley, Saskatchewan. Sheaf of oats, Arthur Perry,\r\nCardston, Alberta. In district exhibits, Swift Current, Saskatchewan,\r\nwon the Board of Trade Award, with Maple Creek second. Red Fife Spring\r\nWheat, E. A. Fredrick, Maple Creek. Other variety of Hard Spring Wheat,\r\nS. Englehart, Abernethy, Saskatchewan. Black Oats, Alex Wooley, Norton,\r\nAlberta. Oats, any other variety, Wm. S. Simpson, Pambrun, Saskatchewan.\r\nWestern Rye Grass, W. S. Creighton, Stalwart, Saskatchewan. Sheaf of Red\r\nFife Wheat, R. H. Carter, Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. Sheaf of\r\nMarquis Wheat, G. H. Carney, Dysart, Saskatchewan. Two-Rowed Barley, R.\r\nH. Carter, Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. Six-Rowed Barley, R. H.\r\nCarter, Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. Western Rye Grass, Arthur Perry,\r\nCardston, Alberta. Alsike Clover, Seager Wheeler, Rosthern,\r\nSaskatchewan.\r\n\r\n=Agricultural Education in Western Canada.=--Scientific farming probably\r\ncan be pursued with more profit and advantage in Western Canada than in\r\nany other portion of the continent. What can be achieved may be judged\r\nby what has been accomplished by the thousands who with not even a\r\ntheoretical knowledge have made it a success. The various governments\r\nhave provided for the development of a class of farmers who, in the\r\npossession of the rich soil of the country, with its abundant humus, its\r\nphosphates, and large endowment of other properties will make of it the\r\ngreatest farming region of the known world.\r\n\r\nAREAS OF LAND AND WATER\r\n\r\n     According to the latest measurements the land and water areas\r\n     of the three provinces, as at the Census of 1911, are as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     -------------+-------------+------------+------------\r\n       Provinces  |    Land     |   Water    |    Total\r\n     -------------+-------------+------------+------------\r\n                  |    acres    |   acres    |    acres\r\n     Manitoba     |  41,169,098 |  6,019,200 |  47,188,298\r\n     Saskatchewan | 155,764,480 |  5,323,520 | 161,088,000\r\n     Alberta      | 161,872,000 |  1,510,400 | 163,382,400\r\n     Total        | 358,805,578 | 12,853,120 | 371,658,698\r\n     -------------+-------------+------------+------------\r\n\r\n     Note--By the Extension of Boundaries Act, 1912, the area of\r\n     Manitoba was increased by 113,984,000 acres, bringing the\r\n     total to 161,172,298 acres, of which 12,739,600 acres are\r\n     water.

It may well be termed one of the Maritime Provinces of\r\nCanada. Manitoba is one-fourth larger than Germany, its area covering\r\n252,000 square miles or about 161 million acres. If a family were placed\r\non every half section of the surveyed land in Manitoba, more than\r\n600,000 persons would be actually living in the Province.\r\n\r\n=Available Homesteads.=--One and a half million acres of land are open for\r\nfree homesteading in Manitoba--east of the Red River, and between lakes\r\nWinnipeg and Manitoba, also west of Lake Manitoba and in the newly\r\nopened districts along the railway lines. The wooded areas of these\r\ndistricts will make a strong appeal to those who appreciate the\r\npicturesque. Where the timber is light scrub, it is easily removed,\r\nwhile the heavy forest richly repays the cost of clearing. Lakes,\r\nrivers, and creeks are numerous, and wells of moderate depth furnish\r\nwater for domestic purposes. Homestead lands are easily reached and the\r\nvalue of land is steadily advancing. Two hundred and thirty-two\r\nhomesteads were filed in Winnipeg in December, 1913--almost twice the\r\nnumber filed during December, 1912.\r\n\r\n=Available Farm Lands=, apart from homesteads, can be secured at $12 to\r\n$15 per acre for raw prairie, while improved farms command $35 to $40.\r\n\r\n=Improved Farms= may be secured in all parts of Manitoba from owners who\r\nhave grown wealthy and are in a position to retire.\r\n\r\n=Soil and Surface.=--The surface of Manitoba is not a flat, bare stretch,\r\na \"bald-headed prairie.\" A large part of the land, especially in the\r\nsouth, is, indeed, the flat bed of a wide, prehistoric lake; but even in\r\nthe southwest the land rises into wooded hills, and in the southeast,\r\nclose to the Lake-of-the-Woods country, there is a genuine forest. In\r\nWestern Manitoba are forested areas, and timbered districts exist on the\r\nTurtle Mountains and the Brandon Hills. The true forest persists in\r\nCentral Manitoba as far as the Duck Mountains. From all these points\r\nquantities of lumber, fence posts, and firewood are sent to the prairie\r\nsettlers. The rivers and lakes are skirted by a plentiful tree growth.\r\nDown through the heart of the Province stretch two great lake chains.\r\nLake Winnipeg and lakes Winnipegosis and Manitoba, which receive the\r\nwaters of the Saskatchewan and Assiniboine from the west, and discharge\r\nthrough the Nelson River to Hudson Bay. Sloping to the west from the\r\nLake Manitoba plain is a range of gentle hills known as the Duck\r\nMountains, Riding Mountains, and the Porcupine Hills. These hills in no\r\nway alter the fact that almost the whole land surface of Central and\r\nSouthern Manitoba west of its great lakes is ready for cultivation. The\r\nnorthern portion of the Province, though not surveyed, is known to\r\ncontain a large area of good agricultural land. Manitoba's soil is a\r\ndeep rich loam, inexhaustible in its productiveness. There are 25-1/2\r\nmillion acres of land surveyed, about one-fourth of which was under crop\r\nin 1913.\r\n\r\n=Grain Growing.=--Manitoba is noted for its wheat crops and has already\r\nan established prestige in yields of oats, rye, and flax; in some parts\r\ncorn is being grown. In certain districts good yields of winter wheat\r\nare reported.\r\n\r\nThe grain statistics for the Province reveal an interesting condition.\r\nIn 1901 there were 1,965,200 acres of land under wheat, and in 1910 the\r\narea had grown to 3,094,833 acres. In 1913, this had increased to\r\n3,141,218 acres. The land under oats, in 1913, amounted to 1,939,723\r\nacres; barley, 1,153,834 acres, and flax, 115,054 acres. The average\r\nyield of wheat in 1913 was 20 bushels; oats, 42 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe total grain crop in the Province for 1913 was 178,775,946 bushels,\r\ngrown on 6,364,880 acres, compared with 182,357,494 for 1912, the\r\ndecrease being due to a falling off in oats of nearly 7 million bushels\r\nand in flax of more than 1 million bushels. Of the 1913 grain crop\r\nspring and fall wheat together occupied an area of 3,141,218 acres and\r\nyielded 62,755,455 bushels. Oats occupied an area of 1,939,723 acres and\r\nyielded 81,410,174 bushels. Barley occupied an area of 1,153,834 acres\r\nand yielded 33,014,693 bushels. Flax, rye, and peas occupied an area of\r\n130,105 acres and yielded 1,595,624 bushels. The above are Provincial\r\nGovernment returns.\r\n\r\n=Potatoes and Field Roots.=--The yield of potatoes for 1913 was 9,977,263\r\nbushels from an area of 55,743 acres, and that of field roots 4,196,612\r\nbushels from an area of 16,275 acres. The average yield of potatoes was\r\nabout 180 bushels per acre; field roots 257 bushels. Total value, about\r\n$2,100,000.\r\n\r\n=Fodder Crops.=--Brome grass contributed 43,432 tons from an area of\r\n24,912 acres. Rye grass 33,907 tons from an area of 21,197 acres.\r\nTimothy 181,407 from an area of 118,812 acres. Clover and alfalfa\r\ntogether contributed 20,454 tons from an area of 10,037 acres, and\r\nfodder corn 119,764 tons from an area of 20,223 acres. Total value about\r\n2 million dollars. Alfalfa is largely grown at Gilbert Plains, Roblin,\r\nSwan River and Grand View. The figures given are from Provincial\r\nGovernment returns.\r\n\r\n=The Season.=--Although spring opened a few days earlier than usual,\r\nseeding was quite general on well drained land by April 15th. From that\r\ndate until the end of the month the weather was exceptionally\r\nfavourable, and by May 10th, on well prepared land, nearly all the\r\nseeding was over.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three weeks of May the weather was quite cool, and\r\ngrowth was slow; but with warmer weather the last week's growth was more\r\nrapid. There was an abundance of moisture from the previous fall, and\r\ndespite the low temperature during May, wheat was well advanced by the\r\nend of the month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Putting up wild hay in Manitoba, which frequently yields\r\nfrom 1-1/2 to 2 tons per acre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Central and Southern MANITOBA\r\n\r\nFor Map of Northern Manitoba see pages 14 and 15]\r\n\r\nThe early part of June was dry with high temperature; but in the latter\r\npart of this month rain was more plentiful, especially in the western\r\npart of the Province. The rainfall in July was below the average, and\r\nthe temperature lower than usual. Harvesting was general by the middle\r\nof August.\r\n\r\nThe excellent condition of the land at seeding time, the favourable\r\nweather during germination and growth, and the ideal harvesting and\r\nthreshing weather, exercised the greatest influence in determining the\r\nhigh grade of all grains as well as materially reducing the cost of\r\nharvesting.\r\n\r\n=Mixed Farming= has become quite general in Manitoba, practically every\r\nfarmer now having his herd of cattle or flock of sheep. His fattened\r\nhogs find a steadily increasing market at good prices, while poultry is\r\na source of revenue. The vegetable crop is always a success; wonderful\r\nyields of potatoes and roots are regularly recorded. Many portions of\r\nthe country, partially wooded and somewhat broken, which were formerly\r\noverlooked, are now proving desirable for mixed farming. These park\r\ndistricts have sufficient area for growing grain, hay, and grasses.\r\n\r\nThe poplar groves scattered here afford excellent shelter for cattle\r\nand, in many cases, furnish valuable building material. The district\r\nlying east and southeast of Winnipeg is rapidly being settled. It is\r\nwell served by the Canadian Pacific, Canadian Northern, and Grand Trunk\r\nPacific Railways. Rainfall here as elsewhere throughout the Province is\r\nadequate, and well water easily secured. Much of this land is available\r\nfor homesteads, while other portions may be purchased at a low price\r\nfrom the railway and land companies. This applies to Swan River and\r\nDauphin districts.\r\n\r\nHon. George Lawrence, Minister of Agriculture, says: \"Conditions in\r\nManitoba are excellent for livestock of all kinds, and the money-making\r\npossibilities in producing all manner of food are beyond question.\r\n\r\n\"The output of the creameries last year was close to 4,000,000 pounds.\r\nThey cannot, however, begin to meet the demand. It is the same with\r\neggs, poultry, beef, pork, mutton, vegetables, and all foodstuffs. The\r\nopportunity for the man who will go in for mixed farming in this\r\nProvince is consequently obvious.\"\r\n\r\n=Dairying= yielded about 3-1/2 million dollars in 1913 for butter, and then\r\nfailed to supply local demand, a quantity of milk, cream, and butter\r\nbeing imported. Winnipeg alone used over three-quarters of a million\r\ndollars' worth of milk and cream in 1913. The demand is increasing with\r\nthe growth of the cities throughout the west, and splendid opportunities\r\nexist in this field. Cheese sold in 1913 at 12-1/2 cents per pound, dairy\r\nbutter at 23.4 cents, and creamery butter at 27.5 cents.\r\n\r\nDairy schools, under control of the Agricultural College are well\r\nequipped and under the guidance of professors of high standing.\r\n\r\n=Businesslike Farming.=--Nowhere on the continent more than in Manitoba\r\nhas farming advanced to the dignity of a thoroughly businesslike\r\noccupation. Here the farmer works, not merely for a living, but for a\r\nhandsome profit. Instances are frequent where large areas under wheat\r\nhave given a clear profit of over $12 an acre. All the labour of\r\nploughing, seeding, harvesting, and marketing is included at $7.50 per\r\nacre with hired help. Even allowing $8, it is a poor year that will not\r\nyield a handsome margin.\r\n\r\nThe greatest monopoly of the future will be land.\r\n\r\nWheat is the greatest food cereal. Lands suitable to the growth of No. 1\r\nhard wheat are extremely limited. While the demand for wheat is\r\nincreasing, the wheat belt of the United States is decreasing yearly in\r\nacreage and yield, with the result that within a few years the United\r\nStates will have to import and scramble for a lion's share of the wheat\r\ncrops of the world.\r\n\r\nThe following tables give the acreage, average and total yield of wheat\r\noats, barley, and flax for the last seven years. Provincial government\r\nreturns,\r\n\r\n                         WHEAT                           OATS\r\n  Year       Acreage   Average     Total       Acreage  Average    Total\r\n                        Yield      Yield                 Yield     Yield\r\n  1907      2,789,553  14.22   39,688,266.6  1,213,596  34.8   42,140,744\r\n  1908      2,850,640  17.23   49,252,539    1,216,632  36.8   44,686,043\r\n  1909      2,642,111  17.33   45,774,707.7  1,373,683  37.1   50,983,056\r\n  1910      2,962,187  13.475  39,916,391.7  1,486,436  28.7   42,647,766\r\n  1911      3,350,000  18.29   61,058,786    1,625,000  45.3   73,786,683\r\n  1912      2,823,362  20.07   58,433,579    1,939,982  46.0   87,190,677\r\n  1913      3,141,218  19.30   62,755,455    1,939,723  42.0   81,410,174\r\n\r\n                        BARLEY                           FLAX\r\n  Year       Acreage  Average     Total        Acreage  Average    Total\r\n                       Yield      Yield                  Yield     Yield\r\n  1907        649,570  25.7    16,752,724.3     25,915  12.25     317,347\r\n  1908        658,441  27.54   18,135,757       50,187  11.18     502,206\r\n  1909        601,008  27.31   16,416,634       20,635  12.26     253,636\r\n  1910        624,644  20.75   12,960,038.7     41,002   9.97     410,928\r\n  1911        760,000  31.5    21,000,000       86,000  14.00   1,205,727\r\n  1912        962,928  35.0    33,795,191      191,315  13.06   2,671,729\r\n  1913      1,153,834  28.0    33,014,693         --     --         --\r\n\r\n=Education.=--Manitobans expend a greater percentage of public funds for\r\nschools than for any other purpose. Private schools, business colleges\r\nand public libraries, as numerous and as well equipped as those in\r\nsimilar communities anywhere, are established in all important cities\r\nand towns and these with the excellent public schools afford educational\r\nfacilities equal to those of any country. There are also a number of\r\nCatholic parochial schools.\r\n\r\nThe Dominion Experimental Farm at Brandon is doing much to educate the\r\nfarming population of the Province. Accurate records of all practical\r\nexperiments are kept and the information is given to settlers free.\r\nDairy schools, farmers' institutes, livestock, fruit growers,\r\nagricultural, and horticultural associations also furnish free\r\ninstruction as to the most successful methods practised in their\r\ncallings.\r\n\r\n=Railways= have anticipated the future, so that few farmers are more than\r\neight or ten miles from a railway. Manitoba now has 3,895 miles of\r\nrailway as compared with 1,470 miles in 1893. The Canadian Pacific has\r\n1,620 miles, Canadian Northern 1,809, and the Grand Trunk 366, and\r\nextensions will be made by all lines this year. Railway lines being\r\nbuilt to Hudson Bay will make large mineral deposits available. When\r\nthis territory is surveyed there will be opened up a wonderfully rich\r\narea, capable of maintaining an immense population. This added territory\r\ngives a port on Hudson Bay, from which vessels can carry the farm\r\nproduce of the West to old country markets.\r\n\r\n=Climate.=--Unlike some other provinces, Manitoba's climatic conditions\r\nare uniform throughout. There is much sunshine the year round. The\r\nsummer is pleasant, warm, and conducive to rapid and successful growth.\r\n\r\nThe long autumns are usually agreeable, ploughing weather sometimes\r\nextending to the end of November.\r\n\r\nThe winters rarely last more than three or four months, and because of\r\nthe dry atmosphere, the low temperature is not as much felt as in\r\ncountries with more moisture. The snow is never deep, and travel in\r\nwinter by team or rail is rarely impeded by drifts. The annual\r\nprecipitation is 21.4 inches.\r\n\r\nThe crop season in Manitoba extends from April to October, inclusive.\r\nSeeding frequently starts early in April, and threshing usually lasts\r\nthrough October. The mean temperature for the period, April 1 to\r\nSeptember 30, in 1913 was 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The mean temperature in\r\nOctober was only 34.40 Fahrenheit, but threshing can be done in cold\r\nweather as readily as in warm, with no injurious effects. The total\r\nprecipitation in the Province was smaller than usual--for the growing\r\nseason 9.67 inches, but rain was well distributed: May 1.04 inches; June\r\n2.34 inches; July 1.70 inches; August 3.56 inches, and September .68\r\ninches. The average sunshine was 7.3 hours daily. The mean temperature\r\nof the country is 32.7; January 5.2; July 66.1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Here is a usual scene in Western Canada during the\r\nharvesting season.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The raising of hogs is a highly profitable industry in\r\nWestern Canada. They are easily fattened on barley, oats and alfalfa.]\r\n\r\n=Picnicing on December 11, 1913.=--The mild weather of the past few months\r\nhas been general throughout the Province of Manitoba. At Melita, on\r\nDecember 11th, the citizens suspended business and had a picnic at River\r\nPark on the outskirts of the town, and there was no discomfort from heat\r\nor cold.\r\n\r\n=Fruit.=--Small fruits did well in 1913. Apples are not grown extensively,\r\nbut several orchards in the Province were well laden. The orchard of Mr.\r\nStephenson, near Morden, was the most notable, and produced a crop of\r\nseveral hundred barrels of apples, as well as an abundance of crabs,\r\ncherries, and other fruits. At the recent Land and Apple Show in\r\nWinnipeg, native apples compared very favourably with those from\r\nProvinces which pride themselves on their horticultural possibilities.\r\n\r\n=Sugar Beets.=--In growing sugar beet, Manitoba has had success. Syrup\r\nproduced from sugar beets grown at Morden was of good consistency and\r\nthe colour indicated that good sugar could be manufactured from it.\r\n\r\n=Game and Fish.=--Manitoba's fishery output represents an annual value of\r\nover one million dollars. There is plenty of good fishing. Wild ducks,\r\ngeese, and swans haunt the lakes and rivers, while on the prairies are\r\nflocks of prairie chicken.\r\n\r\n=Manitoba Farm Lands Year.=--In addition to circumstances which point to\r\nnext year as an important one to farming interests, there is one great\r\nfactor which will undoubtedly have much to do with the sale and\r\ndevelopment of farms. This is the fact that the people of Manitoba\r\nrealize the necessity for mixed farming. This means the breaking up of\r\nlarge tracts of land into smaller farms and therefore a largely\r\nincreased population. Even while the present year has been one of some\r\nfinancial stringency the demand for farm lands has steadily increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SOME MANITOBA FARMERS HAVE DONE\r\n\r\n=Gladstone, Man.=, reports that the wheat crop of 1913 exceeded all\r\nexpectations; 30 bushels per acre was the general yield. The grade was\r\nnever better. One farmer had 400 acres in wheat, which weighed 66 pounds\r\nto the bushel.\r\n\r\n=Portage Plains, Man.=, showed some remarkable yields. Noah Elgert had\r\n61 bushels of wheat per acre; the government farm, 61 bushels; Geo. E.\r\nStacey, 54; T. J. Hall, John Ross and D. W. McCuaig, 50; W. Richardson,\r\n51; M. Owens, 61-1/2; Anderson and Turnbull, 60; J. Lloyd, 48-1/2; Jas.\r\nBell and Robt. Brown, 48; R. S. Tully, 52; J. Wishart, 49-1/4; Philip\r\nPage, 47; J. Stewart, 45; J. W. Brown, 30; Chester Johnson, 44; E. H.\r\nMuir, 42; L. A. Bradley, 43; W. Boddy, 40; Albert Davis, 43; E.\r\nMcLenaghen, 37. After farming the same land for forty years, J. Wishart\r\nsecured a crop of 49-1/2 bushels to the acre, the best he ever had. Mr.\r\nBradley's yield was on land plowed this spring.\r\n\r\n=Marquette, Man.=, September 21. Splendid weather has enabled the farmers\r\nof this section to make good progress with the cutting and harvesting of\r\nthis season's crop. Wheat is averaging 20 bushels to the acre, with\r\nbarley 45 and oats going 70. There has been no damage of any\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n=Binscarth, Man.=, says good reports are coming from the machines of high\r\nyields and good sample. The elevators are busy shipping cars every day.\r\n\r\n=Dauphin, Man.=, September 13. Threshing is general. The grain is in good\r\nshape and the weather is ideal. The samples are best ever grown here,\r\ngrading No. 1 Northern. The returns are larger than expected in nearly\r\nevery case. E. B. Armstrong's wheat went 34 bushels to the acre; others,\r\n25 to 27.\r\n\r\n=Balmoral.=--John Simpson says: \"Very prosperous has been our first year's\r\nfarming in Canada. Shipped two carloads of wheat that graded No. 1\r\nNorthern and sold for eighty-five cents. Weather for the last two weeks\r\nwas perfect--no snow and just enough frost to keep the roads from\r\ngetting muddy.\"\r\n\r\n=Brandon.=--Hard wheats have long been the choice product of Manitoba\r\nsoil, but nothing more significant is required to announce a new\r\nindustry in the Province than that Glencarnock Victor, a\r\nManitoba-finished steer, owned by Mr. J. D. McGregor, was last year\r\ngrand champion of America, and his half-brother from the same stables,\r\nwon like honours this year. Neither had ever been fed any corn, but\r\nfattened on prairie hay, alfalfa, and barley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS\r\n\r\n=Winnipeg=, with a population of about 200,000, is a natural distributing\r\npoint for Western Canada, as well as the shipping point for the\r\nwonderful crops from the tributary prairie lands. The prosperity of\r\nWestern Canada is here reflected in substantial buildings, wide\r\nboulevards, quarries, water works, street lighting systems, asphalt\r\nplants, and a park system of 29 parks, covering 500 acres. There are 40\r\nmodern school buildings with 378 teachers and 21,210 pupils.\r\n\r\nWinnipeg has four live daily papers and forty weekly and monthly\r\npublications. Twenty-four railway tracks radiate from the city, making\r\nWinnipeg the leading grain centre of the world. A photograph taken at\r\nany point in the financial centre of the city shows magnificent new\r\nbuildings under construction, representing immense investment and\r\nindicating the confidence felt in the city's future. Municipal\r\nimprovements are constantly being made. The city now has 466 miles of\r\nsidewalk, 112 miles of boulevard and 162 miles of street pavement. There\r\nare 115 churches.\r\n\r\nSt. Boniface, the seat of the Roman Catholic archdiocese of St.\r\nBoniface, adjoins and is partly surrounded by the business district:\r\n17,000 population.\r\n\r\n=Brandon=--With 18,000 population is the second city in the Province and\r\nis located on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, with its\r\nseven branch railway lines. The Canadian Northern runs through the town\r\nand has erected a fine new modern hotel. The Great Northern entering\r\nfrom the south and the Grand Trunk Pacific completed, there is afforded\r\nexcellent shipping facilities, necessary to the factories, flour mills,\r\nmachine shops, and wholesale houses established here. There are fourteen\r\nbranch banks here with clearings totalling $33,000,000. As an\r\neducational centre Brandon might be ranked with cities several times\r\nlarger. The high school would be a credit to any city of first rank. A\r\nDominion Experimental Farm is located here.\r\n\r\n=Portage la Prairie=--Enjoys splendid railway facilities at the junction\r\nof four lines of railway. This fortunate situation has brought a number\r\nof industries. The city owns its park and has a fine educational system,\r\nincluding a Collegiate Institute. Many churches and fraternal\r\norganizations are supported by this city of 7,000 population. Municipal\r\nimprovements are constantly being made.\r\n\r\n=Selkirk= is a distributing point of supplies for points on Lake Winnipeg.\r\n\r\n=Carberry and Morden= are flourishing railway towns in the heart of fine\r\nwheat-growing sections, as are Minnedosa, Neepawa, Dauphin, Carman,\r\nVirden, and Souris.\r\n\r\nScores of towns now developing afford openings for those desiring\r\nbusiness opportunities; each has its mills and warehouses for wheat.\r\nAmong these centres may be named Manitou, Birtle, Emerson, Gretna,\r\nWawanesa, Rivers, Somerset, Baldur, Deloraine, Melita, Rapid City,\r\nHamiota, Gladstone, Killarney, Hartney, Stonewall, Boissevain, Elkhorn,\r\nGilbert Plains, Pilot Mound, Winkler and Plum Coulee.\r\n\r\nProvincial Government returns.\r\n\r\n                                 POPULATION AND LIVESTOCK\r\n\r\n                         1891     1908     1909     1911     1912     1913\r\n  Population           152,506                    455,614\r\n  Horses                86,735  230,926  237,161  232,725  273,395  304,100\r\n  Milch cows            82,710  173,546  167,442  146,841           154,400\r\n  Other horned cattle  147,984  357,988  333,752  397,261  428,274  460,200\r\n  Sheep                 35,838   29,265   29,074   32,223   42,087  112,500\r\n  Hogs                  54,177  192,489  172,374  176,212  216,640  176,000\r\n  Cultivated farms                        45,380            49,755   50,000\r\n\r\nIncrease in population in ten years was 78.52 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit of grains, grasses, clover, fodder crops, vegetables, and\r\nnatural products shown at the 1913 United States Land Show spoke well\r\nfor the soil and climate of Manitoba.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An ordinary threshing scene in Manitoba, where fields of\r\nwheat, oats and barley pay the farmer well.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTHERN MANITOBA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSASKATCHEWAN\r\n\r\n\r\nSaskatchewan, the central Prairie Province, is a huge rectangle\r\nextending from the 49th to the 60th parallel, with an area as large as\r\nFrance and twice the size of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nIt comprises 155,092,480 acres, and extends 760 miles north and south\r\nand 390 miles east and west at the southern boundary bordering on the\r\nUnited States. The average altitude is about 1,500 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nSaskatchewan claims to be without a rival in North America as a producer\r\nof wheat and small grains. Only physical and geographical conditions\r\nretard even a more phenomenal agricultural development. Its growth and\r\nacquisition of wealth has been phenomenal. There are four distinct zones\r\nextending north and south: (a) rolling prairie, (b) prairie and\r\nwoodland, (c) forest, (d) sparsely timbered belt. All the land is\r\nsuitable for cultivation and will yield the highest quality of cereals,\r\nthough less than 13 million acres are now under the plough. The\r\npopulation of approximately 550,000 thriving, vigorous people will\r\neventually be a million. The increase in ten years was 440 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Government forces in Saskatchewan are complete and effective. Every\r\nbranch of agricultural work conducted by the Provincial Government is a\r\npart of the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n=Soil and Surface.=--The soil in all of Saskatchewan is a rich loam,\r\nrunning from eight to twenty inches deep over a chocolate clay subsoil.\r\nMoisture is evaporated from this subsoil so gradually that the fertility\r\nis almost inexhaustible. With few exceptions the southern portion of the\r\nProvince from a line east and west through Saskatoon is almost flat.\r\n\r\nIn certain portions the surface is undulating, but in no case so hilly\r\nas to preclude ploughing every acre; near some of the rivers in the more\r\nhilly sections the soil becomes lighter with some stone and gravel.\r\n\r\nFive reasons may be given for the exceptionally favourable conditions\r\nawaiting the grower of wheat in Saskatchewan: 1. The soil is of almost\r\ninexhaustible fertility. 2. The climate brings the plant to fruition\r\nvery quickly. 3. The northern latitude gives the wheat more sunshine\r\nduring the growing period than is had in districts farther south. 4.\r\nRust is of infrequent occurrence. 5. Insect foes are unknown.\r\n\r\n=Fuel and Water.=--The coal areas to the south, and the partially wooded\r\nareas in the north, provide an ample supply of fuel, while water can be\r\nsecured anywhere at a reasonable depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN\r\n\r\n=The Available Homesteads= are principally in the northern portion of\r\nCentral Saskatchewan which is watered east and west by the main\r\nSaskatchewan River and by its chief branch, the North Saskatchewan, a\r\ngreat part of whose navigable length lies within this section. The\r\nsurface generally is rolling prairie interspersed with wooded bluffs of\r\npoplar, spruce, and pine, alternating with intruding portions of the\r\ngreat plain from the south. In soil and climate Central Saskatchewan is\r\nwell adapted to the raising of cattle, also wheat and other grains.\r\nNorth of township Thirty there is unlimited grazing land, horses, cattle\r\nand sheep feeding in the open most of the year. There is the necessary\r\nshelter when extreme cold weather sets in and water is plentiful. Sheep\r\ndo well. Many farmers have from 50 to 100 sheep and lambs. The district\r\nalso possesses everything required for the growing of crops and there\r\nare satisfactory yields of all the smaller grains. The homesteader may\r\nadd to his holdings by purchasing adjoining land from the Canadian\r\nNorthern, Canadian Pacific Railway and other corporations. These\r\nunimproved lands range from $15 an acre upwards.\r\n\r\nDistricts recently opened for settlement are Shellbrook, Beaver River,\r\nand Green Lake, into which the Canadian Northern Railway is projected.\r\nOther new districts are Jack Fish Lake and Turtle Lake, north of\r\nBattleford, into which the same road is built. These districts are\r\nfavourable for grain and cattle raising. North of North Battleford are\r\nseveral townships which will not long be without transportation, and to\r\nthe east of these there are available homesteads which can be reached\r\nthrough the Prince Albert gateway.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN\r\n\r\n=Available Farm Land.=--There are but few homesteads available in\r\nSoutheastern Saskatchewan. The land is occupied by an excellent class of\r\nfarmers, and values range from $15 per acre to $25 for unimproved\r\nprairie, and from $40 to $50 per acre for improved farms. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Moose Jaw mixed farming and grain raising are carried\r\non with success. North and northwest, towards the Saskatchewan, are\r\nlarge settlements; but to the south and southwest is a tract of land\r\navailable for homesteading, and a land office at Moose Jaw makes it easy\r\nto inspect the land and secure speedy entry. These lands are easily\r\nreached from Moose Jaw, Mortlach, Herbert, Gull Lake, and Swift Current.\r\n\r\nMaple Creek district is an important stock centre. Some of the best\r\nsheep, cattle, and horses in Canada are raised on the succulent grass\r\nhere but the wheat grower and mixed farmer are treading on the heels of\r\nthe ranchman.\r\n\r\nWest of Swift Current to the Alberta boundary herds of cattle roam and\r\nlargely find for themselves. Snowfall is light and winters so mild that\r\nhardy animals graze through the whole year. The Chinook winds are felt\r\nas far east as Swift Current. Grain growing is successful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In many parts of Western Canada, large farms are operated\r\nby steam or gasoline power. This shows its use, and also discing,\r\nseeding and harrowing.]\r\n\r\nFarm land can be purchased from railway and other land companies in\r\nSoutheastern Saskatchewan, which includes that section between Manitoba\r\non the east and the third meridian on the west, extending some distance\r\nnorth of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It has more\r\nrainfall than portions farther west and less wood than the portion lying\r\nnorth. In character and productiveness of soil, Southeastern\r\nSaskatchewan is a continuation of Manitoba, but contains more prairie\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN\r\n\r\n=Available Homesteads.=--Northern Saskatchewan has not yet been opened to\r\nany extent for settlement. There are approximately 80 million acres\r\nbeyond the railway at Prince Albert which time, zeal, and railway\r\nenterprise will eventually make accessible. Furs, forest wealth, and\r\nfisheries are recognized as a national asset, but thousands of acres of\r\nfertile land lie beyond the existing lines of railway awaiting\r\ndevelopment. Northern Saskatchewan has natural resources sufficient to\r\nmaintain a population equal to that of any European country in\r\ncorresponding latitude.\r\n\r\n=Saskatchewan Crops.=--Saskatchewan leads all other provinces in wheat\r\nproduction, though only a comparatively small portion of its tillable\r\narea is under cultivation. In 1898 the area under wheat was 276,253\r\nacres; 910,359 acres in 1905; 2,703,563 acres in 1908, and in 1913, five\r\nyears' time, it had more than doubled, the area being 5,720,000 acres.\r\nOn this there were grown approximately 121-1/2 million bushels of wheat,\r\nan average of about 21-1/4 bushels to the acre. The farmers realized\r\nabout 124 million dollars for products apart from field and fodder\r\ncrops, valued at 5 million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are from Provincial Government returns.\r\nSaskatchewan has easily 50,000,000 acres of unbroken prairie to grow\r\njust such good crops, and another 25,000,000 acres on which to graze\r\nlive stock.\r\n\r\n                  Acreage   Yield     Total     Price per        Total\r\n                             per   Production    Bushel          Value\r\n                            Acre\r\n  Wheat          5,760,249   19.5  112,369,405  At   63c   $ 70,792,725.15\r\n  Oats           2,638,562   41.7  110,210,436  At   23c     25,348,400.28\r\n  Barley           307,177   30.2    9,279,263  At   26c      2,412,608.38\r\n  Flax             967,137   12.0   11,654,280  At  $1.00    11,654,280.00\r\n  Province       9,673,125         243,513,384              110,208,013.81\r\n\r\nWhile the average yield of wheat is shown to be 19.5 bushels per acre,\r\nthousands of farmers raised 35 bushels and some more than 40.\r\nConsiderable was sown on stubble, and there were many low yields\r\noccasioned by indifferent farming, and anxiety to secure a crop from\r\nlate seeding, without which the general average would have exceeded 30\r\nbushels per acre. The same is true of other grains. On the Experimental\r\nFarm at Indian Head, Marquis wheat produced 48 bushels to the acre, and\r\nRed Fife on the stubble 28 bushels.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire wheat crop was within the contract grades, (none less\r\nthan 3 Northern, the great bulk graded No. 1) and by the end of October\r\n75 per cent of the crop was threshed. In many instances wheat weighed 64\r\nand as high as 66 pounds to the bushel. Mr. Paul Gerlach of Allan,\r\nSaskatchewan, had 71 pounds per bushel, and carried off the honours at\r\nthe International Dry Farming Congress at Tulsa last November.\r\n\r\n=Mixed Farming= is so successful in Saskatchewan that only passing comment\r\nis necessary. The Province is famous for its high-class horses,\r\nwell-bred cattle, sheep, and hogs. At the Live Stock Show in Chicago in\r\n1913, the Province carried off high premiums. The Department of\r\nAgriculture secures good breeding stock for the farmers and encourages\r\nthe preservation of females.\r\n\r\n=Poultry Raising= is so profitable that many Saskatchewan farmers have\r\ngone into it extensively. Of 10,000 turkeys marketed at Moose Jaw there\r\nwas not a single \"cull.\" They brought an average of $2.80 each. Chickens\r\nprovide a certain profit and constant income.\r\n\r\n=Dairying= is successful. An established market and excellent natural\r\nfacilities favour this branch of mixed farming. 997,000 pounds of\r\ncreamery butter yielded $271,185 in 1912 and private dairies realized\r\n$189,000 from 700,000 pounds, making a total increase of $177,376.69\r\nover 1911. With the exception of cream delivery, a government\r\nsuperintendent supervises all business transactions of most creameries.\r\n\r\n=Fodder Corn.=--At Prince Albert fodder corn has reached a height of eight\r\nfeet with not a poor sample in the lot and there are strong indications\r\nthat before many years corn will be grown here for ensilage with general\r\nsuccess. At the Experimental Farm, fodder corn yielded about 18 tons of\r\ngreen fodder per acre, which went into the silo in good condition.\r\n\r\n=Railways.=--About five hundred miles of new road opened in 1912 gives\r\nSaskatchewan a total mileage of about 5,000 miles as compared with 1,000\r\nin 1905, of which 1,230 is main line and 3,700 branches. The Province is\r\nso well served by the Canadian Pacific, Canadian Northern, and Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific that few of the established settlements are more than 10\r\nto 20 miles from transportation; new settlements do not have to wait\r\nlong for railway advantages. The Hudson Bay Railway will afford a short\r\nhaul to ocean shipping from Saskatchewan grain fields. One and a half\r\nmillion dollars have been appropriated by the local government for\r\nimprovements and building highways. From 1905-13 the population has\r\ndoubled, and whole districts which were practically uninhabited but a\r\nshort time ago are now filled with farmers.\r\n\r\n=Rivers.=--The chief rivers are the North Saskatchewan, South\r\nSaskatchewan, Qu'Appelle, and Carrot. The North and South Saskatchewan\r\nrise in the Rockies and have a general easterly trend. The Red Deer\r\nflows into the South Saskatchewan, about 150 miles north of the United\r\nStates boundary. The South Saskatchewan runs east nearly half way across\r\nthe Province, then turns north and enters the North Saskatchewan a\r\nlittle east of Prince Albert. The South Saskatchewan, with the\r\nQu'Appelle, intersects the Province from east to west. The Carrot rises\r\nsouth of Prince Albert and runs parallel to the North Saskatchewan, into\r\nwhich it flows near \"The Pas,\" and the junction point of the Hudson Bay\r\nRailway, now under construction.\r\n\r\n=Lumbering.=--North and east of Prince Albert, the present centre of the\r\nlumber industry, lumbering is extensive. In the northern forest the\r\ntimber is black and white spruce, larch or tamarack, jack pine, aspen or\r\nwhite poplar, balsam or black poplar, and white birch.\r\n\r\n=Game and Fish.=--In the north, furs are secured for the world's markets\r\nand fishing is carried on extensively.\r\n\r\n=Education.=--Schools are sustained by provincial aid and local rates.\r\nExcept in special cases where qualified teachers cannot be obtained, the\r\nteacher must hold a certificate from the Department of Education. The\r\nuniversity is supported and controlled by the Province, a department of\r\nwhich is a college of agriculture with some of Canada's best educators\r\nand agricultural specialists on the faculty. Nowhere do agricultural\r\nauthorities give greater attention to the welfare and education of the\r\nfarmer than in the newer districts of this Province.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS\r\n\r\n=Regina.=--Capital of Saskatchewan, lies in the heart of a splendid\r\nagricultural section, and is distributing centre for a large district.\r\nWith a population of about 45,000 it supports a dozen banks which had\r\nclearings of 116 million dollars in 1912. It has good hotels, is noted\r\nfor its substantial public buildings, wide, well-paved streets, and\r\nmetropolitan spirit. The Canadian Pacific, Canadian Northern and Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific unite to make it an important railway centre. The\r\ncollegiate institute and provincial normal school add to its educational\r\nimportance. The Northwest Mounted Police headquarters are located here,\r\nalso the judiciary of Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The sheep industry in Western Canada is one of certain\r\nprofit. There are many large flocks in all parts of the three\r\nProvinces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN Surveyed lands shown in colour.\r\n\r\nFor Map of Central Saskatchewan see pages 22 and 23.]\r\n\r\n=Saskatoon.=--The seat of the University of Saskatchewan, is a growing\r\ncity beautifully situated on the South Saskatchewan River. It is well\r\nserved by the Canadian Northern's Regina-Prince Albert line which\r\npasses through an extensive and productive farming district to the\r\nsouthwest and joins the main line at Warman, and is also on the route of\r\nthe Canadian Pacific from Winnipeg to Edmonton. Population about 28,000;\r\nin 1903 it was about 100. There are four bridges crossing the South\r\nSaskatchewan River, with another in contemplation.\r\n\r\n=Moose Jaw= is a divisional point on the Canadian Pacific, is a terminus\r\nof the Soo Line and is also served by the Canadian Northern and Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific. Population approximately 23,000. It is noted for its\r\nschools and churches. Splendid street car facilities exist here. This\r\ndistrict is well settled by progressive farmers. They have brought raw\r\nprairie land, which cost from $8 to $10 per acre, to a state of\r\ncultivation, that makes their farms worth from $25 to $40 per acre.\r\n\r\n=Prince Albert= is the northern terminus of the Canadian Northern and is\r\ndelightfully situated on the North Saskatchewan River. It is served by a\r\nline of the Grand Trunk Pacific built from the main line at Young. The\r\nCanadian Northern Battleford-Prince Albert line will be completed this\r\nfall. It has four big sawmills, and several banks, churches, schools,\r\nand hotels. Population, 12,000. The three flour mills grind about 400\r\nbarrels a day. One mill ships its product largely to Scotland.\r\n\r\n=Swift Current= is a divisional point of the Canadian Pacific Railway and\r\na busy railway centre. It is said to be the largest initial wheat market\r\nin America. Population about 2,500. A few years ago the district from a\r\npoint twelve miles west of Moose Jaw to the western boundary of the\r\nProvince, and south to the United States boundary was considered fit\r\nonly for horse ranching, cattle and sheep grazing, but now the land is\r\npractically all homesteaded in every direction from Swift Current.\r\nBranch lines extended to the northwest and southeast enter fairly well\r\nsettled districts; other lines are contemplated. It was incorporated as\r\na city.\r\n\r\n=North Battleford= is wonderfully well situated agriculturally and\r\npicturesquely. It has a population of over 7,000, and is incorporated as\r\na city. Several important industries and large wholesale places are\r\nestablished. The Canadian Northern Railway passes through the town,\r\nhaving its divisional headquarters here, and during the year will\r\ncomplete its line to Prince Albert. There is excellent passenger and\r\nfreight service on the same company's line northwest, which is under\r\nconstruction to Athabaska Landing, Alberta. A traffic bridge connects\r\nNorth Battleford with Battleford.\r\n\r\n=Weyburn= is a prosperous city on the \"Soo\" Line between Moose Jaw and\r\nNorth Portal. Its railway connection with Stoughton furnishes a direct\r\nroute to the east. The Lethbridge line of the Canadian Pacific starts\r\nhere and will be completed this year. Building permits, 1912, $760,000.\r\n\r\n=Yorkton= within the last five years has more than doubled its population\r\nand ships annually over 2 million bushels of grain. It is an up-to-date\r\ntown of about 2,500 inhabitants with creditable municipal buildings,\r\neight grain elevators, water works, sewerage system, flour mill, saw\r\nmill, cement sidewalks, telephone, and a municipal gas plant.\r\n\r\n=Battleford.=--Population about 3,000. Has one of the most picturesque\r\nsituations in the west, and was the first capital of the Old\r\nTerritories. During the past year it has made remarkable growth owing to\r\nthe agricultural possibilities of the surrounding country. The Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific reaches the town from Biggar on the south and is building\r\na line west from Saskatoon. The Canadian Northern has a branch entering\r\nthe town. The Canadian Pacific is expected to build from Asquith. A\r\nnumber of industries have embraced the encouraging opportunities offered\r\nby the town, and large wholesale houses have erected distributing\r\ndepots.\r\n\r\n=Rosetown=, on the Canadian Northern Saskatoon-Calgary line, is\r\nprogressive. It is of importance to-day, and marked for a good future. A\r\nsplendid agricultural district peopled with excellent settlers surrounds\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=Zealandia=, on the same line of railway, has wonderful physical\r\nadvantages. Although of only a few short years' existence, as the centre\r\nof a farming country where lands have increased from $8 to $30 per acre,\r\nits fame has spread and its citizens are warranted in anticipating a\r\nbright future.\r\n\r\n=Kindersley= has been on the map only four or five years. The surrounding\r\nfertile land that made the Goose Lake district famous in agriculture so\r\nsoon after its discovery, gave to Kindersley a large portion of its\r\nglory and substance. It is growing rapidly, and confidence in what it\r\nwill do is well bestowed.\r\n\r\n=Maple Creek=, for many years the centre of a ranching section, has a\r\npopulation of 1,000, and the large surrounding area of free homestead\r\nland is rapidly being settled. Excellent crops are reported.\r\n\r\n=Estevan= is noted for its coal mines and has rail connection with\r\nWinnipeg.\r\n\r\n=Rosthern=, on the Regina-Prince Albert branch of the Canadian Northern,\r\nis in the centre of a good agricultural district.\r\n\r\n=Wolsely=, three hundred miles west of Winnipeg, is the western terminus\r\nof the Wolsely-Reston branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\r\n\r\n=Indian Head=, the largest incorporated town in Saskatchewan, has more\r\nelevators than any other town in the province. For some time it was the\r\nlargest initial wheat-shipping point in the world. The Dominion\r\nGovernment Experimental Farm is here.\r\n\r\n=Moosomin=, two hundred and twenty miles west of Winnipeg on the main line\r\nof the Canadian Pacific Railway, is a flourishing town surrounded by\r\nrolling prairie particularly adapted to mixed farming. Population 1,200.\r\nIt has good churches, schools, banks, grain elevators and waterworks.\r\n\r\n=Qu'Appelle and Arcola= are enterprising towns. Among the largest\r\nincorporated villages are Broadview, a divisional point on the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway main line, Grenfell, Duck Lake, Alameda, Balgonie,\r\nLemberg, Lloydminster, Melfort, Rouleau, and Sintaluta. Portal is the\r\npoint where the \"Soo\" Line enters Saskatchewan. Yellow Grass, Milestone\r\nand Drinkwater are newer towns--settled within the past few years by\r\nprogressive farmers from the States. Important and growing towns on the\r\nGrand Trunk Pacific, are Melville, Watrous, Scott, Nokomis and Young.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SASKATCHEWAN FARMERS ARE DOING\r\n\r\n=Regina.=--During the week ending Sept. 21, 5119 cars of No. 1 Northern\r\nHard were shipped out of the Province, as compared with 1,497 cars of\r\nNo. 2 Northern and 290 cars of No. 3 Northern in 1912. There were, in\r\naddition, 111 cars of No. 1 Manitoba Hard shipped during the week.\r\n\r\n=Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Nov. 30.=--Since Sept. 1, 19,850,000 bushels of\r\ngrain have been shipped from the Moose Jaw district, against 32,000,000\r\nfor the previous entire crop year. Rouleau heads the list with 1,040,000\r\nbushels, and Milestone comes second with 910,000 bushels. Vanguard,\r\nwhich led last year, is third, with 835,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Rutan.=--Arthur Brondson, inexperienced in farming, having lived in\r\nLondon until eight years ago, last year raised 36 acres of Red Fife\r\nwheat, of 49 bushels per acre, and 48 acres Marquis wheat, 52 bushels\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\n=Regina.=--James Cranston threshed 1,050 bushels oats from ten acres;\r\nJames Hars's 60 acres yielded 106 bushels; W. J. Crawford's 60 acres\r\nproduced 43 bushels Preston wheat; other yields of Marquis wheat show\r\n40, 48, 50, and 63 bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n=Esterhazy.=--Esterhazy shared in the abundant harvest of 1913. A\r\nconservative estimate for the yield is from 25 to 30 bushels per acre\r\nfor wheat, and 40 to 45 for oats. Some fields yielded 40 to 45 bushels\r\nper acre in wheat.\r\n\r\n=Tisdale.=--D. McKibbon threshed 38 bushels wheat to the acre off 40\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n=Wynyard.=--Eggert Bjornson threshed 176 acres, averaging 36 bushels No. 1\r\nNorthern wheat.\r\n\r\n=Moose Jaw.=--Chas. White's 80 acres wheat yielded 38 bushels to the acre.\r\nW. H. Johnston's 90 acres produced 35-1/2 bushels wheat per acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A landscape view of Central Saskatchewan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This man is sufficiently modest to start with oxen; in a\r\nyear or two they will be replaced by horses. He now farms 320 acres.]\r\n\r\n=Pasqua.=--E. S. Patterson, on 230 acres summer-fallow, threshed 31 acres\r\nMarquis, with a yield of 40-2/3 bushels per acre; 199 acres Red Fyfe\r\nwith a yield of 35-1/2 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n=Caron.=--Archie Dalrymple, 100 acres, 40-1/2 bushels wheat per acre. Geo.\r\nClemenshaw, 80 acres, 42-1/2 bushels wheat per acre.\r\n\r\n=Boharm.=--Geo. Campbell had 55 acres wheat that yielded 38 bushels per\r\nacre, and 100 acres that yielded 36 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Assiniboia.=--E. Lennard threshed 1200 bushels oats, from a ten-acre\r\nfield. His summer-fallow yielded 40 bushels No. 1 Northern wheat per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n=Canora.=--Mike Gabora had a yield of 120-1/2 bushels oats per acre. C. R.\r\nGraham, who has a 3,000 acre farm in this district, for a number of\r\nyears has grown oats that averaged 60 bushels to the acre, and sometimes\r\nyielded 100 bushels: one year the average was 117 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Arcola.=--R. F. Harman, formerly of the County of Cork, Ireland,\r\nhomesteaded in the North Battleford district in 1903, with $50.00\r\ncapital. He now owns 480 acres, clear of encumbrance, raises wheat,\r\noats, barley, hay, and is a firm believer in mixed farming. In ten years\r\nhis capital has increased from $50.00 to $25,000.\r\n\r\n=Swift Current.=--Ed. K. Leep, of Chicago, homesteaded north of Swift\r\nCurrent. He had 30 acres of land in potatoes in June and lifted new\r\npotatoes on August 15. In the Fall little more than half an acre yielded\r\nover one hundred bushels. Some had been used in the meantime. Fuel was\r\nplentiful 8 miles away and good water was reached at twenty-five feet.\r\nThe climate was agreeable, and good crops assured.\r\n\r\n=Nokomis.=--J. Keys had oats in 1913 that went 110 bushels to the acre,\r\nand wheat, 40 bushels. He has paid off the mortgage on his farm, and now\r\ncontemplates a trip to his old home in Denmark, to induce more of his\r\npeople to settle in his neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n=W. E. Lewis= of Dayton, Ohio, went to Saskatchewan seven years ago with\r\n$1,800 in money, a carload of household effects and farm implements,\r\nfour horses and three cows. The first year he got only feed from the\r\ncrops, but the second year threshed over 2,800 bushels of wheat from 100\r\nacres. He has not had a crop failure and now has 22 horses, 15 cattle,\r\n35 hogs, and owns 1,120 acres of land, all under cultivation. He has\r\nbeen offered $35.00 an acre for his land. Should he care to sell, he\r\ncould pay all his debts, and have $30,000 to the good, but, he says,\r\n\"Where could I go to invest my money and get as good returns?\"\r\n\r\n=A. T. Smith= of Southern Saskatchewan will grow alfalfa on 3,000 acres of\r\nland in 1914.\r\n\r\n=Mr. S. G. Cowan says=: \"I usually thresh from 60 to 65 bushels of oats,\r\n30 of wheat, and 60 of barley. Vegetables grow well, and it is no\r\ntrouble at all to grow potatoes. My farm has been under crop nine years,\r\nand has never been frozen, snowed under, or hailed. I have kept 100\r\ncattle and 100 hogs. I usually give them their growth on green feed,\r\nwheat, oats, and barley, and fatten them on grain. With a little to\r\nstart on we have cleared $10,000 in a little over four years.\"\r\n\r\n=Chaplin.=--J. R. Lowe has matured two crops of fodder corn, and he says\r\nthere is little difference between it and what he grew in Minnesota.\r\n\r\n=Industries.=--The remarkable growth of the several cities and towns is\r\nbut one of many evidences of increasing agricultural prosperity. With\r\nthe coal resources of the southeastern part of the Province utilized,\r\nand the opportunities in northern parts for getting cheap water,\r\nSaskatchewan's industrial opportunities are many.\r\n\r\nThere is a great demand for help of all kinds. With seven cities, thirty\r\nor more towns, and five hundred villages, many men are constantly\r\nrequired for building trades and municipal work. The 90,000 farmers want\r\nhelp to put in and farm their crops. Boards of Trade in every city and\r\ntown are ready to give information about openings for investment and\r\nassistance in locating men. The experimental stage is passed and people\r\nare developing beautiful homes surrounded by fertile fields.\r\n\r\n  Cost of Farm Implements:\r\n\r\n  Disc Drill (single to\r\n  twenty double)                     $   96.00\r\n  Mowers                                 53.50\r\n  Twelve in.

Five million dollars have been\r\nset aside for road improvements. The new agricultural college, with its\r\n1,300 acre farm, costing one million dollars, is an evidence of public\r\nactivity.

The area of arable land alone in Alberta is\r\nestimated at 100 million acres, of which less than 3 million acres is\r\nunder cultivation. This provincial empire, with its great wealth in\r\nagricultural lands, mines, forests, and fisheries, has less than 500,000\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAlberta is a vast plateau from 2,000 to 3,000 feet above sea-level, hung\r\nby its western edge on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. It slopes\r\ngently toward the east and north. Absolutely level plains form no great\r\nproportion of the surface. While open, treeless country characterizes\r\nthe southern part of the Province, the greater part is undulating,\r\ndiversified by forest, stream, hill and open country, not unlike Ontario\r\nor New York State. Beautiful lakes, fringed with forest and abounding in\r\nwhitefish are scattered over its central and northern area. Luxuriant\r\ngrasses cover the open country, which once formed the chief feeding\r\ngrounds of herds of bison.\r\n\r\nThe Province naturally falls into three divisions, exhibiting marked\r\ndistinctions in climate and topography--Southern, Central and Northern\r\nAlberta.\r\n\r\n=Available Homesteads= are to be found west and north of\r\nEdmonton--territory made accessible by the Grand Trunk Pacific and the\r\nCanadian Northern Railways--in an immense stretch of splendid country.\r\nWheat and oats are reliable crops. Rainfall is certain. Mixed farming is\r\nhighly successful. The wild grasses and pea vine supply ample feed for\r\nstock; water is plentiful and easily secured. On into the foothills and\r\nthe mountains are stretches of prairie land, through which the Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific and Canadian Northern Railways are now constructed.\r\n\r\nThe northern and western portions of Central Alberta have some \"brush\"\r\nland with soil equal to that of the open prairie. The cost of clearing\r\nis slight, and there is the advantage of shelter for cattle, and an\r\nabsolute assurance of splendid water. There is a good market for the\r\nfuel and timber obtained in clearing. Practically all of the land\r\nbetween Edmonton and Athabaska Landing--and between Edmonton and Lac la\r\nBiche to the northeast has been subdivided for homesteading.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN ALBERTA\r\n\r\nNorth of the end of steel extends 75 per cent of this rich Province, yet\r\nunexploited. When the railways push into the Athabaska and the Peace, it\r\nwill be realized that Alberta owns an empire north of the Saskatchewan,\r\na country set apart by nature to provide homes for millions of agrarian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN ALBERTA\r\n\r\n=Southern Alberta= is open and rolling, and devoid of timber except along\r\nthe streams and the Rocky Mountains' foothills. The soil is a fertile\r\nloam. The climate is ideal, with pleasing summers and mild winters.\r\nStock pasture in the open air during winter, grazing on the nutritive\r\nsun-dried grasses. The absence of timber in Southern Alberta is\r\ncompensated for by the supply of coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Typical school in rural district in Western Canada, which\r\nwill soon be replaced by consolidated school, picture of which appears\r\nelsewhere.]\r\n\r\nRanching which once was predominant is fast being abandoned and settlers\r\nare dividing the limitless acres into small, productive holdings. As a\r\ngrazing country, Southern Alberta has had few equals, for the hills and\r\nvalleys, well watered, afford excellent pasturage. Winter wheat sown on\r\nnew breaking, or summer-fallowed land, from the middle of July to the\r\nend of September is ready for harvest from the 1st to the 15th of August\r\nin the following year. Climate and soil make this an ideal wheat-growing\r\ndistrict. Considerable spring wheat is grown, as well as oats, barley\r\nand flax. The production of sugar-beets compares favourably with that of\r\nGermany and the world.\r\n\r\nThe average of winter wheat for the Province in 1913, was 21 bushels an\r\nacre. The greater portion was grown around Lethbridge, Taber, Grassy\r\nLake, Cardston, Spring Coulee, Pincher Creek, Macleod, Stavely, Leavitt,\r\nClaresholm, Nanton, High River, Okotoks, Carmangay and Calgary.\r\n\r\n=Water Supply and Irrigation.=--Water for domestic and farm purposes is\r\neasily obtained at reasonable depth. In certain sections of the Canadian\r\nWest, as in the American West, the soil is unexcelled for growing\r\ncereals, but the geographical location and relative position to the rain\r\navenues is not advantageous, not only the requisite amount of rain but\r\nits conservation is essential to the growing of crops, and that is the\r\nmeaning of \"dry farming.\" This is being successfully followed in the\r\nsouthern portion of Southern Alberta. Some of the district can also be\r\neasily and successfully farmed by means of irrigation. Irrigation\r\nditches have been constructed by the Canadian Pacific Railway and the\r\nSouthern Alberta Land Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Typical school, such as many towns are building in\r\nWestern Canada, where the education of the children is carefully looked\r\nafter.]\r\n\r\nA most valuable asset to Southern Alberta is the Lethbridge Experimental\r\nStation, operated by the Dominion Department of Agriculture. Reports\r\nfrom the farm show that on land broken and backset in 1912, spring wheat\r\nsown April 3, 1913, ripened between July 31 and August 17, and yielded\r\nfrom 22 to 41 bushels per acre; oats sown April 13, 1913, ripened from\r\nJuly 31 to August 4, and yielded from 54 to 84 bushels per acre; barley\r\nsown April 15, 1913, ripened from July 28 to Aug. 5, and yielded from 28\r\nto 40 bushels per acre. On irrigated land the yield of spring wheat was\r\nfrom 30 to 54 bushels, and the period of ripening about the same; oats\r\nyielded from 102 to 132 bushels per acre, same period for ripening;\r\nbarley yield on irrigated land was from 65 to 100 bushels per acre,\r\nharvested from July 28 to August 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL ALBERTA\r\n\r\n=Central Alberta= extends from the Red Deer River northward to the height\r\nof land between the Saskatchewan and the Athabaska. Its great wealth is\r\nits deep black humus varying in depth from ten inches to three feet,\r\noverlying a warm subsoil.\r\n\r\n=Mixed Farming.=--None of the three central provinces afford greater\r\nadvantages for mixed farming than Alberta. In the south the great ranges\r\nof vacant area affords excellent pasturage. The central portion\r\nfurnishes pasturage of equal quality, and the groves and park lands\r\nprovide shelter, making it possible to raise cereals, as well as feed\r\nfor cattle and hogs. Dairying and poultry raising meet with undoubted\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n=Dairy Products= have an unlimited market; cattle can be pastured most of\r\nthe year; every variety of grass including clover and alfalfa thrive;\r\nthe climate is healthful and water abundant. More than a million head of\r\ncattle could have been fed on the wild hay that went to waste last year.\r\nHundreds of thousands of acres are literally overrun with rich wild\r\ngrasses and pea vine. The dairy yield approximated $1,250,000 in 1913,\r\nand 50,000 cows could be added without affecting the price of dairy\r\nproducts. The government operates a travelling dairy to instruct new\r\nsettlers, and manages permanent creameries which produced over three\r\nmillion pounds of butter last year. Fattening hogs on milk adds to the\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n=Poultry Raising.=--The winter price of fresh eggs ranges from 50 to 60\r\ncents a dozen, the summer prices rarely falling below 25 cents.\r\nExtensive developments along this profitable line cannot be long\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\n=Crops of 1913.=--With an average rainfall of 10.92 inches during the\r\ngrowing season in that part of the Province including Edmonton and\r\nsouthward, an average daily sunshine record of 10 hours, and a mean\r\ntemperature of 53 degrees Fahrenheit for the months April to September\r\ninclusive, good crops were certain. Spring seeding began early in April.\r\nThe season was highly favourable and a big crop was harvested in\r\nexcellent condition. Marquis wheat at one point went as high as 62.5\r\nbushels per acre as a field crop, and oats and barley relatively as\r\nhigh. Yields of all kinds of grain and forage crops have been most\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nThe census bureau of the Dominion Government give the following returns:\r\n\r\n                   Area       Area      Average        Total       Total\r\n                   1912       1913    1912   1913      1912        1913\r\n  Fall wheat      212,000    202,000  21.83  21.00   4,628,000   4,242,000\r\n  Spring wheat  1,378,000  1,310,000  21.54  23.00  29,675,000  30,130,000\r\n  Oats          1,461,000  1,639,000  46.30  43.65  67,630,000  71,542,000\r\n  Barley          187,000    197,000  33.05  32.15   6,179,000   6,334,000\r\n  Rye              15,000     16,000  25.56  24.89     377,000     398,000\r\n  Flax            132,000    105,000  12.83  11.00   1,693,000   1,155,000\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Department of Agriculture for Alberta placed the total\r\nyield of all grains at 81,500,000 bushels, but as the acreage is less,\r\nthe average yields are about the same.\r\n\r\nThe average yield per acre of potatoes from 25,000 acres was about 170\r\nbushels; turnips and other roots about 250 bushels. Alfalfa yielded\r\nabout 2.77 tons per acre and sugar beets about 9 tons per acre; hay and\r\nclover 1.56 tons, with a total value of all these products of\r\n$3,700,000.\r\n\r\n=Government and Other Telephones.=--The Government operates the telephone\r\nsystem, including about 7,000 miles of long distance wires, pursues an\r\nactive policy of stimulating the organization of rural companies by\r\ngiving as a bonus all poles required. These rural companies are\r\nconnected with local exchanges and toll offices wherever possible.\r\n\r\n=Railways.=--During 1913 considerable was added to the railway mileage.\r\nBesides its main line the Canadian Pacific has two branches from\r\nCalgary--one north to Strathcona, the other south to Macleod. Two\r\nrunning eastward diverge at Lacombe and Wetaskiwin, the latter a through\r\nline via Saskatoon to Winnipeg. Another leaves the Canadian Pacific near\r\nMedicine Hat, passes through Lethbridge and Macleod and crosses the\r\nmountains by the Crow's Nest Pass, a branch connecting with the Great\r\nNorthern at Coutts and extending to Cardston and west. Another branch\r\nwill connect Lethbridge with Weyburn, on the \"Soo\" line. Provincial\r\nmileage 1,523. Other branches connecting the system are being built; as\r\nshown on the maps.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Northern enters Alberta from the east at Lloydminster on\r\nits way to Edmonton. From Edmonton lines are projected and partially\r\nconstructed north and west. One starting at Vegreville connects the main\r\nline with Calgary, and then extends southeasterly toward Lethbridge and\r\nMacleod. From this line a branch is being built into the coal fields\r\nwest of Lacombe and will form part of the transcontinental line of that\r\nsystem. Its extension from Saskatoon to Calgary is about completed.\r\nMileage 593.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific serves the territory lying between the Canadian\r\nNorthern and the Canadian Pacific, operating trains through productive\r\nterritory and for some distance into British Columbia. This Company has\r\ncompleted its line south from Tofield to Calgary, a part of the\r\ntranscontinental line of that system. Through trains now run from\r\nEdmonton to Toronto, Provincial mileage, 545.\r\n\r\nAnother road is now under construction northward from the international\r\nboundary through Pincher Creek, with Calgary as a northern terminus.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial government has outlined a policy of railway development\r\nthroughout the Province, particularly in the north, opening vast\r\nagricultural lands which will attract settlers desirous of taking up\r\nfree homestead.\r\n\r\n=Lakes and Rivers.=--The Saskatchewan and the Mackenzie rivers rise in the\r\nProvince. The former is divided into two great arteries, one of which\r\nwith its tributaries, the Bow, Belly, St. Mary's, Old Man and Red Deer,\r\nwaters the south, while the north branch, with the Brazeau, Clearwater,\r\nSturgeon, Battle, Blindman and Vermilion as tributaries, waters the\r\ngreat central plains. The Peace and the Athabaska drain the north. Lake\r\nAthabaska, 120 miles long, Lesser Slave, 60 miles long, and many smaller\r\nbodies of water are chiefly in the northern part.\r\n\r\n=Mineral Resources.=--Alberta has enormous coal and lignite areas. The\r\nproduction of coal in 1913 was over 3-1/2 million tons, valued at over\r\n7-1/2 million dollars. The coal supply is practically inexhaustible, and\r\nunderlies much of the whole Province in seams from four to twelve feet\r\nthick. It is found in all grades, lignite, bituminous and anthracite, on\r\nthe banks of every stream, and in the shafts from 20 to 150 feet deep.\r\nThe total formation contains 12,800 square miles; contents 71 billion\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nNatural gas has been found at Medicine Hat, Tofield, Dunmore Junction,\r\nand Bow Island on the South Saskatchewan, and at Pelican Rapids on the\r\nAthabaska. Recently considerable interest has been taken in the oil\r\nfields south of Calgary and north of Edmonton. Important commercial oil\r\nfields will soon be located. There is also petroleum, gypsum, salt and\r\ntar sands. Excellent brick and fireclay.\r\n\r\n=Fish and Furs.=--The Great Lakes of the North furnish yearly half a\r\nmillion pounds of incomparable whitefish, while the fur wealth of the\r\nnorth is important.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This shows that it is not all work in Western Canada.\r\nThere are many spots as beautiful as this, the resort of the sportsman\r\nand pleasure seeker.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coal mining at Tofield, Alberta, where an excellent\r\nquality is obtained, and where natural gas is abundant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTHERN ALBERTA\r\n\r\nLands within irregular line along railway in British Columbia are\r\nadministered by the Dominion Government.\r\n\r\nSurveyed lands shown in colour.\r\n\r\nFor Map of Central Alberta see pages 30 and 31.]\r\n\r\n=Education.=--The organization of free district schools is optional with\r\nsettlers, the Government liberally supporting them. An expenditure of\r\nabout $700,000 a year brings educational advantages within the reach of\r\nthe most scattered community. One new school a day has been opened in\r\nAlberta during the last three or four years, an indication of the\r\nsettlement that is going on. School population at end of 1912, over\r\n70,000; number of schools 2,029. Two hundred and forty-five school\r\nbuildings were erected in 1912.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of exact scientific knowledge is carried on by\r\nfarmers' institutes, stock-judging schools, seed fairs and travelling\r\ndairies. The raising of pure-bred stock is assisted by Government\r\ngrants. Experimental and demonstration farms have been established\r\nthroughout the Province. Agricultural high schools will soon be started,\r\nand agriculture form part of the public school curriculum.\r\n\r\n=A Healthy Product.=--The air of Alberta insures the best of health. The\r\nwhole of Alberta lies above mountain altitude, and the air is\r\nextraordinarily clear and bracing. Consequently there is comparatively\r\nlittle cloudy weather on normal days, either in summer or winter. Bright\r\nsunshine prevails. Striking testimony as to freedom from consumption is\r\nprovided by Dr. T. H. Whitelaw of Edmonton, according to whose official\r\nreport not one case of this disease has originated in Edmonton since the\r\nbeginning of 1911.\r\n\r\n=Stock.=--Alberta's dry and invigorating atmosphere, short, mild winters,\r\nnutritious grasses, and abundant water supply, make it pre-eminently\r\nadapted to horse breeding. The Alberta animal is noted for its\r\nendurance, lung power, and freedom from hereditary and other diseases.\r\nIt winters out at a nominal expense and without even hay or grain\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\nFour-year old steers, which have never been under a roof nor fed a pound\r\nof grain and have been given less than a ton of hay, weigh about 1,500\r\npounds by August 1 and will then gain until October from 2 to 3 pounds a\r\nday. Experiments made at the Demonstration Farm at Olds show that 100\r\nsteers weighed in November 1, at 127,540 pounds, weighed out May 20,\r\nless than 7 months later at 143,412 pounds, showing a net gain of $10.12\r\nper head.\r\n\r\nAt the Lacombe Experimental Station the gain per day in feeding cattle\r\nranged from 1.8 to 1.72 lbs., showing a net profit when sold of $14.35\r\nto $28.90.\r\n\r\n=Good Roads in the Province.=--One of the most important considerations in\r\na new country is that of roads. The Alberta government has taken up this\r\nproblem in an intelligent manner, that will eventually greatly enlarge\r\nthe resources of the Province.\r\n\r\nThe money expended on ferry service, maintenance of bridges, road\r\nconstruction, construction of bridges, and the construction of trunk\r\nroads, was essential to the opening up of vast tracts of fertile land.\r\n\r\nAs a result, $100,000,000, or more than $200 per capita of the total\r\npopulation of the Province, is the estimated farm value of the 1913 crop\r\nin Alberta.\r\n\r\n=Sugar Beets and Alfalfa.=--Operations are now extending north as well as\r\nsouth of Lethbridge, where a large factory has been conducted for some\r\nyears. An expert from Colorado has taken up irrigated land in the\r\nBassano district to carry on the industry on a large scale. He says:\r\n\"This is going to be a great beet-raising country. My crop averaged\r\nbetween 16 and 18 per cent sugar, which is a very high grade.\" He says\r\nhis new farm produces as much alfalfa per acre as his former more\r\nexpensive land in Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Fruit.=--It has not yet been demonstrated that the larger fruits, such as\r\napples, can be made commercially attractive in Alberta. All the smaller\r\nfruits can be grown with little trouble, at a cost that makes their\r\nculture profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SOME ALBERTA FARMERS ARE DOING\r\n\r\n=Macleod.=--Weather conditions were excellent throughout the season.\r\nNinety per cent of the wheat up to October 1 graded No. 1, the only No.\r\n2 being fall wheat. The yield ranged from 20 to 40 bushels per acre,\r\nwith an average of 28. Oats yielded well, and barley about 60 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Inverary= is a new district. Wheat graded No. 2 and some of it went 50\r\nbushels to the acre, oats going about 75 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Monarch.=--The yield of wheat on summer-fallow averaged 35 bushels, a\r\nlarge percentage No. 1 Northern.\r\n\r\n=Milk River.=--All spring grains yielded better than expected. A 300-acre\r\nfield of Marquis wheat gave 41-1/2 bushels.\r\n\r\nExperimental farm results on grain sown on irrigated land place \"Red\r\nFife\" wheat in the banner position, with a yield of 59.40 bushels per\r\nacre. Oats yielded 13 bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n=Calgary.=--The yield of grain was everywhere abnormal, with an increased\r\nacreage of about 23 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Bassano.=--September 25. Individual record crops grown in Alberta include\r\na 1,300-acre field of spring wheat, near here, which went 35 bushels to\r\nthe acre and weighed 66 pounds to the bushel.\r\n\r\n=Noble.=--Mr. C. S. Noble had 350,000 bushels of grain. The cost of\r\nproduction per acre was $9.10 on summer-fallow and the returns were\r\n$24.93 per acre. Oats averaged 90 bushels on 2,880 acres, wheat 38 on\r\n300 acres, and barley 61 on 450 acres, all grading top.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris Oium, came from South Dakota twelve years ago and homesteaded\r\nthe first 160 acres in his township, dividing his land between grain and\r\npasture. He earned sufficient money to buy a quarter section of railway\r\nland at $11 an acre. The half section netted proportionate profits and\r\nhe gradually increased his holdings to 1,920 acres, which are devoted to\r\nmixed farming this year. He values his land at $50 an acre. He has 200\r\nhogs, mostly pure bred Poland China, 25 head draft horses and 35 head of\r\npure bred Hereford cattle. Feeding barley to hogs nets him 80 cents a\r\nbushel, twice the average market price when delivered to the warehouse.\r\nHis barley averages 40 bushels to the acre; oats average 80 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Red Deer.=--John Lamont says that a man on a quarter-section, with a few\r\ncows, brood sows, and 100 hens, can be as sure of a good living for his\r\nfamily as if he were pensioned by the government. His 20 acres of\r\nAlberta red winter wheat yielded 985 bushels. Last year his wheat went a\r\nlittle over 40 bushels per acre, machine measure. He grows alfalfa.\r\n\r\nS. D. McConnell has carried on mixed farming for twelve years keeping a\r\nfew cattle and some hogs; makes a dollar a bushel out of his barley by\r\nfeeding it. His fall wheat has gone from 30 to 65 bushels to the acre;\r\noats from 40 to 100 bushels, never weighing less than 42 lbs. to the\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nH. S. Corrigan has averaged at least 30 bushels of spring wheat per\r\nacre, 40 bushels of barley, and 60 bushels of oats. Twenty-one acres of\r\noats ran 90 bushels per acre, and weighed 48 pounds per bushel. Last\r\nwinter he bought nine head of cattle for $420, fed them six weeks on\r\nhay, green feed, and chop and sold them for $579.60. Two steers, 26\r\nmonths old weighed 2,440 lbs. One sow raised 58 pigs in 2-1/2 years, and\r\nwhen sold, weighed 550 pounds. Two of her pigs, now a year old, are\r\nraising 23 pigs. Timothy has yielded a ton and a half on an average, at\r\n$15 a ton.\r\n\r\n=Red Deer.=--J. Northrup has not missed a crop in nine years, and says:\r\n\"This is the best country in the world for small grain, better than Iowa\r\nand that is good--I love old Iowa. Winter wheat yields as high as 45\r\nbushels per acre. Potatoes yield 400 bushels per acre at times. Alfalfa\r\nis a good crop when the soil is inoculated.\"\r\n\r\nC. A. Sharman has the world's champion Jersey cow. He says: \"A quarter\r\nsection of land and 100 head of stock mean the maximum of growth from\r\nevery square yard. Any man, woman, or child that uses Alberta rightly\r\nwill be used rightly by Alberta. Farming in Alberta is no gold brick\r\nproposition, but an industry, which is the basis of all wealth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the comfortable homes in Western Canada, showing\r\nsplendid surrounding of trees.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alfalfa has become a recognized fodder crop in Western\r\nCanada. Large areas are already planted, and it produces abundant\r\nyields.]\r\n\r\nA. P. Olsen formerly of Minnesota has raised cattle, horses, hogs and\r\nalso milked a few cows. His oats yield 45 bushels to the acre, spring\r\nwheat, 36 bushels, winter wheat and barley 40 bushels. He won first\r\nprize at the Calgary Exhibition for a collection of 32 varieties of\r\ngrasses found on his own land.\r\n\r\n=Macleod.=--R. McNab has returns which show a yield of 45 bushels of No. 1\r\nNorthern wheat to the acre.\r\n\r\n=Gleichen.=--Forty-five bushels of No. 1 Northern wheat per acre was the\r\nyield on the Blackfoot Indian reserve in 1913.\r\n\r\n=Pincher Creek.=--Alfred Pelletier had 130 bushels oats per acre.\r\n\r\n=Cities and Towns.=--On the banks of the Saskatchewan and forming the\r\nportal alike to the Last West and the New North, the capital city of\r\n=Edmonton= has attractions for the capitalist, the tourist, the\r\nmanufacturer, and the health seeker. At the centre of two great\r\ntranscontinental highways, Edmonton will soon be rated among the world's\r\ngreat cities. Traffic from the Pacific to Hudson Bay will go through her\r\nportals, the south, north and west will contribute. Possessed of\r\nmunicipally-owned waterworks, electric-lighting and power systems,\r\nstreet railways and telephones, the city is modern, attractive and\r\nalive. The number of banks is evidence of prosperity. The coal output of\r\nthe district is about 3,000 tons daily. Population, about 60,000. In\r\n1901, it was 2,626. In 1911, the assessment was a trifle under 47\r\nmillion dollars; in 1912, 123-1/2 million dollars. School attendance,\r\n5,114.\r\n\r\n=Calgary= tells its own story in public buildings and in over one hundred\r\nwholesale establishments, 300 retail stores, 15 chartered banks, half a\r\nhundred manufacturing establishments, and a $150,000 normal school\r\nbuilding. The principal streets are paved. There is municipal ownership\r\nof sewer system, waterworks and electric light and street railway.\r\nDirectly bearing upon the future of Calgary is the irrigation project of\r\nthe Bow River Valley, where 3 million acres are being colonized. One\r\nthousand two hundred miles of canals and laterals are completed.\r\nPopulation in 1911 was 43,736; now claimed 75,000. There are 36 schools,\r\n146 teachers, and 7,000 pupils. The Canadian Pacific car shops here\r\nemploy 3,000 men. It has the Canadian Pacific, Canadian Northern, and\r\nGrand Trunk Pacific.\r\n\r\n=Lethbridge=, with a population of about 13,000, the centre of a splendid\r\nagricultural district, is also a prosperous coal-mining and commercial\r\ncity. The output of the mines, which in 1912 was about 4,300 tons daily\r\nand necessitated a monthly pay roll of $145,000, finds a ready market in\r\nBritish Columbia, in Montana, and as far east as Winnipeg. A Government\r\nExperimental Farm is nearby. The several branches of railway diverging\r\nhere make it an important railway centre. It will shortly have the Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific, and direct Canadian Pacific and Canadian Northern lines\r\neastward. The municipally-owned street car system affords excellent\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Medicine Hat=, in the valley of the South Saskatchewan and the centre of\r\na magnificent ranching and mixed-farming district, is a division point\r\nof the Canadian Pacific Railway, with extensive railway shops operated\r\nwith natural gas for fuel. The light, heat, and power, derived from this\r\ngas are sold to manufacturers at 5 cents per thousand cubic feet, and\r\nfor domestic purposes at 1 cent. The factories and industries now using\r\nnatural gas pay out about 2-1/2 million dollars annually, which will be\r\nconsiderably augmented by factories in course of construction, and to be\r\nerected. When the new flouring mills are completed, Medicine Hat will be\r\nthe largest milling centre on the continent. Population over 6,000.\r\n\r\n=Macleod= is one of the oldest towns in the Province. With the rapid\r\nsettlement of the surrounding agricultural land, this town is showing\r\nwonderful progress; during 1913 a large amount was spent in new\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n=Wetaskiwin= is a railway division point from which farms stretch in all\r\ndirections. The city is beautifully located, and owns its electric light\r\nplant, waterworks, and sewerage system.\r\n\r\n=Red Deer= is situated on the Canadian Pacific, half way between Calgary\r\nand Edmonton. It has a large sawmill, two brick-yards, concrete works,\r\ncreameries, wheat elevators, and a sash-and-door factory. Coal and wood\r\nare plentiful and cheap. The district has never had a crop failure. It\r\nshowed considerable business activity in 1913. Lines of railway extend\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\n=Lacombe=, on the direct line between Calgary and Edmonton, has a flour\r\nmill, foundry, planing mill, brick-yard, grain elevators, electric\r\nlights, and telephones. The surrounding country is noted for its\r\npure-bred cattle and horses, and a Government Experimental Farm adjoins\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\n=Raymond= enjoys a rapid growth, and has one of the largest sugar\r\nfactories in the west. Sugar beets are a great success here. Mr. Henry\r\nHolmes, who won the big wheat prize at the Dry Farming Congress held at\r\nLethbridge in 1912 resides here.\r\n\r\nOther prosperous towns are Claresholm, Didsbury, Fort Saskatchewan, High\r\nRiver, Innisfail, Olds, Okotoks, Pincher Creek, Ponoka, St. Albert,\r\nVermilion, Vegreville, Carmangay, Stettler, Taber, Tofield, Camrose,\r\nCastor, Cardston, Bassano, Edson, Coronation, Empress, Magrath, Nanton,\r\nStrathmore, Gleichen, Leduc, Hardisty, Walsh, Daysland, Sedgewick,\r\nGrassy Lake and Wainwright. Much interest is being taken in Athabaska\r\nLanding, owing to its increasing agricultural settlement and the\r\ncompletion of the Canadian Northern.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS IN ALBERTA, 1913\r\n\r\n=Agricultural Conditions.=--From the agricultural standpoint the season of\r\n1913 was perfectly normal. Spring opened favourably for seeding\r\noperations and at no time from seeding to threshing did unfavourable\r\nconditions threaten a successful harvest. Copious rains in the growing\r\nperiod, and bright dry weather in the cutting and threshing period kept\r\nthe farmer confident from the beginning. It was a season made, as it\r\nwere, to the farmers' order. The quality of grain was extra good. Wheat\r\nweighed from 61-1/2 to 68 pounds to the bushel, oats 40 to 46, and barley\r\n52 to 58.\r\n\r\nConditions were equally favourable to pasture and hay crops and live\r\nstock. The first and second cuttings of alfalfa were especially heavy\r\nand timothy made a good average yield. Abundant pasture continued\r\nthroughout the season making both beef and dairy cattle profitable\r\ninvestments. Live stock, dairy products, poultry and eggs are worth four\r\ntimes the value of grain crops. The value of the former is nearly 120\r\nmillions, while the total value of the grain crop is about 30 millions.\r\nThe income from the former reached 40 million dollars last year, that\r\nfrom the latter about 25 million dollars.\r\n\r\n=Public Works and Railways.=--About 600 miles of steel were laid last\r\nyear, bringing the railway mileage of the province up to nearly 3,600\r\nmiles. Equal activity is assured for 1914. This year the Government made\r\na step to provide transportation facilities for districts sidetracked by\r\nthe railway companies. The means adopted is guaranteeing the interest on\r\nthe securities of light railways up to one-half the estimated cost.\r\n\r\n=Financial.=--The income of the farming community exceeds that of all\r\nformer years. It is estimated that the product of this year that will be\r\nconverted into cash for the liquidation of debts, is nearly 65 million\r\ndollars. The farmer is therefore in a position to pay his machinery\r\ndebts, store debts, and other obligations. Consequently the farmers are\r\noptimistic and are planning extended operations for the coming season.\r\n\r\nMeasured by every economical standard, Alberta shows sound prosperity\r\nand justifies a continuance of the confidence of outside capitalists in\r\nher established business, and increased investments in the development\r\nof her vast resources of farms, mines and forests.\r\n\r\n=Population and Live Stock.=--(Dominion Census Bureau):\r\n\r\n                  1909     1910     1911     1912       1913\r\n  Population    ......   ......   374,663  ......

Looking across\r\nthe water to the millions of British subjects in India, in Hong-Kong, in\r\nAustralia, and the isles of the sea, one catches brief pathetic glimpses\r\nof the commercial greatness which the Pacific has begun to waft to these\r\nshores. Nature intended British Columbia to develop a great seaward\r\ncommerce, and substantial trade relations are now established northward\r\nto the Yukon and southward to Mexico. Population, June, 1911, 392,480.\r\n\r\nBritish Columbia has natural wealth in her forests and her fish, in her\r\nwhales and seals and fruit farms. But it is from her mines, more than\r\nfrom aught else, that she will derive her future wealth.\r\n\r\nThe parallel chains of the Rockies, the Selkirks, and the Coast Ranges\r\nare a rich dower. They furnish scenery unrivalled in its majesty; they\r\nare nurseries of great rivers which pour tribute into three oceans; and\r\nin their rocky embrace they hold a mineral wealth second to none.\r\n\r\nBritish Columbia contains an aggregate of from 16 million to 20 million\r\nunoccupied arable acres. Sir William Dawson has estimated that in the\r\nBritish Columbia section of the Peace River Valley alone, the\r\nwheat-growing area will amount to 10 million acres. It is a country of\r\nbig things.\r\n\r\n=How to get the Land.=--Crown lands in British Columbia are laid off and\r\nsurveyed into townships, containing thirty-six sections of one square\r\nmile in each. The head of a family, a widow, or single man over the age\r\nof eighteen years, and a British subject (or any alien upon making a\r\ndeclaration of his intention to become a British subject) may for\r\nagricultural purposes record any tract of unoccupied and unreserved\r\ncrown land (not being an Indian settlement), not exceeding 160 acres in\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nFree homesteads are not granted. The pre-emptor of land must pay $1 an\r\nacre for it, live upon it for two years, and improve it to the extent of\r\n$2.50 per acre. Particulars regarding crown lands of this Province,\r\ntheir location, and method of pre-emption can be obtained by\r\ncommunicating with the sub-joined government agencies for the respective\r\ndistricts, or from the Secretary, Bureau of Agriculture, Victoria, B.\r\nC.:\r\n\r\nAlberni, Nanaimo, New Westminster, Golden, Cranbrook, Kaslo, Nelson,\r\nRevelstoke, Bakersville, Telegraph Creek, Atlin, Prince Rupert,\r\nHazleton, Kamloops, Nicola, Vernon, Fairview, Clinton, Ashcroft.\r\n\r\n=Agriculture.=--It is not so long ago that agriculture was regarded as a\r\nquite secondary consideration in British Columbia. The construction of\r\nrailroads, and the settlement of the valleys in the wake of the miner\r\nand the lumberman, have entirely dissipated that idea. The agricultural\r\npossibilities of British Columbia are now fully appreciated locally, and\r\nthe outside world is also beginning to realize that the Pacific Province\r\nhas rich assets in its arable and pastoral lands.\r\n\r\nProfessor Macoun says: \"As far north as the fifty-fourth degree it has\r\nbeen practically demonstrated that apples will flourish, while in the\r\nsouthern belt the more delicate fruits, peaches, grapes, and apricots,\r\nare an assured crop.\"\r\n\r\nOn a trip through the valley one sees apple orchards with the trees\r\nfairly groaning under their loads of fruit, and pear, plum, and prune\r\ntrees in like manner. In many places between the trees there are rows of\r\npotatoes, cabbages, and other vegetables, showing that the land is\r\nreally producing a double crop. Grapes, water melons, and musk melons\r\nalso thrive in the valley, and large quantities of each are grown.\r\nTomatoes, cherries, and berries of all kinds are grown extensively.\r\nWheat, oats, and corn give excellent yields. As an instance, one man's\r\nwheat crop this season averages 48-1/2 bushels to the acre. Of prunes,\r\none orchardist grew a crop of 7,000 boxes. The apples shipped find a\r\nready market in Calgary, Regina, and in the other cities in the prairie\r\nprovinces. Prices this year are considerably better than they were a\r\nyear ago. Last year this valley produced 350 carloads of fruit and\r\nvegetables, and some of the farmers have made net profits of as high as\r\n$250 an acre.\r\n\r\nThose who have turned their attention to mixed farming are exceptionally\r\nwell pleased with the result. A local company is being organized to\r\nbuild a cannery and this will be in operation next year. And besides\r\nthis one, another cannery is being talked of.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys, of which there are many, there are tracts of wonderfully\r\nrich and, largely of alluvial deposits, that give paying returns.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia and Kootenay Valleys, comprising the districts of\r\nCranbrook, Nelson, Windermere, Slocan, Golden and Revelstoke are very\r\nrich. The eastern portion requires irrigation; they are well suited to\r\nfruit farming and all kinds of roots and vegetables. Timber lands are\r\nsaid to be the best, when cleared. In the western portion of these\r\nvalleys there are considerable areas of fertile land, suitable for fruit\r\ngrowing. The available land is largely held by private individuals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The fruit industry of British Columbia is making rapid\r\ndevelopment. Peaches, plums, pears, grapes, apples grow to the greatest\r\nperfection.]\r\n\r\nThe valleys of the Okanagan, Nicola, Similkameen, Kettle, North and\r\nSouth Thompson, and the Boundary are immensely rich in possibilities.\r\nThe advent of the small farmer and fruit grower has driven the cattle\r\nindustry northward into the Central district of the Province. The ranges\r\nare now divided into small parcels, occupied by fruit growers and small\r\nfarmers. Irrigation is necessary in most places, but water is easy to\r\nacquire.\r\n\r\nThe Land Recording District of New Westminster is one of the richest\r\nagricultural districts of the Province and includes all the fertile\r\nvalley of the Lower Fraser. The climate is mild, with much rain in\r\nwinter. The timber is very heavy and the underbrush thick. Heavy crops\r\nof hay, grain, and roots are raised, and fruit growing is here brought\r\nto perfection. The natural precipitation is sufficient for all purposes.\r\n\r\nFor about seventy miles along the Fraser River there are farms which\r\nyield their owners revenues from $4,000 to $7,000 a year; this land is\r\nnow worth from $100 to $1,000 an acre. As much as 5 tons of hay, 120\r\nbushels of oats, 20 tons of potatoes, and 50 tons of roots have been\r\nraised per acre.\r\n\r\nVancouver Island, with its great wealth of natural resources and its\r\ncommanding position, is fast becoming one of the richest and most\r\nprosperous portions of the Province. Its large area of agricultural land\r\nis heavily timbered and costly to clear by individual effort, but the\r\nrailroad companies are clearing, to encourage agricultural development.\r\nMost farmers raise live stock, do some dairying and grow fruit. Grains,\r\ngrasses, roots, and vegetables grow to perfection and yield heavily.\r\nApples, pears, plums, prunes, and cherries grow luxuriantly, while the\r\nmore tender fruits--peaches, apricots, nectarines, and grapes attain\r\nperfection in the southern districts when carefully cultivated.\r\n\r\nF. A. Starkey, Pres. of the Boards of Trade says that a clear profit of\r\n66-2/3 per cent can be made in fruit growing.\r\n\r\n=Lillooet= is well adapted to dairying, cattle raising, and fruit growing.\r\n\r\n=Central British Columbia=, through which the Grand Trunk Pacific is now\r\nbeing constructed, comprises the valleys of the Bulkley, Endako,\r\nNechaco, Fraser, and Stuart, where there is considerable land inviting\r\nto the settler. The soil and climate of the valleys extending westward\r\nto the Bulkley are adapted to grain growing and cattle raising, while\r\nfurther westward and to within fifty miles of the west coast belt apple\r\nculture as well is successful.\r\n\r\nDown the Fraser from Fort George there is active development in\r\nsettlement, and wheat, oats, barley and hay are highly productive; the\r\nclimate is good. The soil is a brown silt covered by a layer of\r\nvegetable mould, and the timber is light and easy to clear.\r\n\r\nAlong the Nechaco, between Fort George and Fraser Lake, is same\r\ncharacter of soil and a similar country, there being large tracts well\r\nfitted for general farming. Native grasses yield abundant food; there is\r\nample rainfall, and the winter climate moderates as the coast is\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nNorth of Fort Fraser there is good grazing and farming land, somewhat\r\ntimbered and covered with rich grasses. The prevailing price is $25 an\r\nacre; owners are not particularly anxious to sell.\r\n\r\nThe Bulkley and Endako valleys have a lightly-timbered rich soil, and a\r\nwell-watered country with mixed farming possibilities. There is no\r\nnecessity for irrigation. It would be rash for the inexperienced to\r\npenetrate this district in search of land before the railway. The\r\ndifficulties and cost are too great. To the hardy pioneer, who has\r\nknowledge of how to select good land in a timbered country, the future\r\nis at his feet. Most of the available land within a reasonable distance\r\nof the railroad is taken up, and the days of the pre-emptor, except in\r\nremoter parts, are past. Land can be secured at a reasonable figure from\r\nthose who have purchased in large blocks from the Government.\r\n\r\nCentral British Columbia is lightly timbered from end to end; natural\r\nopen patches are not frequent, and occur mostly on river banks and at\r\nthe ends of lakes. While railroad construction is under way and\r\nsettlement in progress good prices will be obtained for all agricultural\r\nproducts. This portion of the Province can now be reached by way of\r\nPrince Rupert, by rail from Edmonton, or by trail from Ashcroft, B. C.\r\n\r\n=Highways.=--One-half million dollars was spent last year in opening up\r\nfirst-class wagon and motor roads throughout the Province.\r\n\r\n=Education.=--The school system is free and non-sectarian; equally as\r\nefficient as in any other Province of the Dominion. The Government\r\nbuilds a school-house, makes a grant for incidental expenses, and pays a\r\nteacher in every district where twenty children between the ages of six\r\nand sixteen can be gathered. High schools are also established in\r\ncities, where classics and higher mathematics are taught.\r\n\r\n=Chief Cities.=--Victoria, the capital, about 60,000; Vancouver, the\r\ncommercial capital, 123,902; New Westminster, 13,199; Nelson, 4,476;\r\nNanaimo, 8,168; Rossland, 2,826; Kamloops, 3,772; Grand Forks, 1,577,\r\nRevelstoke, 3,017; Fernie, 3,146; Cranbrook, 3,090; Ladysmith, 3,295;\r\nPrince Rupert, 4,184; Fort George and Fort Fraser on the Fraser and\r\nNechaco rivers and Grand Trunk Pacific will be important towns in the\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\nHon. W. R. Ross, Provincial Minister of Lands, says that there is a\r\ntotal of 93,000,000 acres of land reserved for pre-emption within the\r\nconfines of the Province at the present time. Of the 250,000,000 acres\r\nof ground estimated to be within the Province only 5,000,000 acres, or\r\nabout 2 per cent, had been sold to date he said, even excluding reserve\r\nland, available for settlement. As a matter of fact, during the past few\r\nyears between 9,000 and 11,000 pre-emptions had been issued by the\r\nGovernment to settlers, and during the last year 3,600 had been issued\r\noutside of the railway belt and about 1,200 within the area.\r\n\r\nThe cities afford a splendid reflex of the trade of the country, and\r\nshow the development in mining, fishing, lumbering, shipping,\r\nmanufacturing and agriculture.\r\n\r\n=Climate.=--Near the coast the average number of days in the year below\r\nfreezing is fifteen; rainfall varies from 40 to 100 inches. Farther\r\ninland the average number of days in the year below freezing is\r\nsixty-five. The northern districts of Hazleton, Pearl River, Cassiar,\r\nand Atlin are somewhat colder.\r\n\r\nOcean currents and moisture laden winds from the Pacific exercise a\r\nmoderating influence upon the climate of the coast. The westerly winds,\r\narrested in their passage east by the Coast Range, create what is known\r\nas the \"dry belt\" east of the mountains; the higher air currents carry\r\nthe moisture to the lofty peaks of the Selkirks, and the precipitation\r\nin the eastern portion of the Province is greater than in the central\r\ndistrict, thus a series of alternate moist and dry belts is formed. The\r\nProvince offers a choice of a dry or moist climate, an almost total\r\nabsence of extremes of heat and cold, freedom from malaria, and\r\nconditions most favourable.\r\n\r\n=Mineral Resources.=--The precious and useful metals abound in British\r\nColumbia, and it was the discovery of placer gold in the Cariboo\r\nDistrict that first attracted attention to the Province. Occurrences of\r\ncopper, gold, silver, and lead ores are widespread, and mining is being\r\ncarried on in those districts convenient to transportation facilities.\r\nCoal is extensively mined in Vancouver Island, in the Crow's Nest Pass\r\ndistrict and more recently, in the Nicola Valley region. Miners' wages\r\nare high, and there is usually a constant demand for workmen. The value\r\nof the mineral production last year was 32 million dollars, of which\r\ncoal contributed 9 million and copper 8 million dollars.\r\n\r\nMuch successful prospecting is in progress in the region traversed by\r\nthe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, the completion of which will\r\nundoubtedly be followed by important mining development. Already many\r\nvaluable finds of coal and metal ores have been made. The mineral\r\nresources are not confined to any one section, although the principal\r\nmetalliferous operations have so far been confined to the southern\r\nportion of the Province. The various mining camps, employing large\r\nnumbers of men, who are paid high wages, afford a fine home market for\r\nthe products of the farms and orchards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There is no more profitable industry in British Columbia\r\nthan that of raising cattle. Dairying is carried on extensively.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH COLUMBIA\r\n\r\nDominion Electoral Divisions shown in Colour. Lands in Peace River\r\nBlock, as well as those along the Canadian Pacific Railway within shaded\r\nline, are administered by the Dominion Government.]\r\n\r\n=Timber.=--Next in importance, at the present time, are the timber\r\nresources. It is admitted that the largest remaining areas of\r\nfirst-class building timbers in the world are in British Columbia. The\r\nlumber industry has increased enormously of recent years owing to the\r\ndemand from the rapidly growing Prairie Provinces. For many years to\r\ncome it will have to undergo constant expansion to keep pace with the\r\never-growing needs of the untimbered prairie regions. The principal\r\nwoods are Douglas fir, cedar, spruce, tamarac, pine and hemlock.\r\n\r\n=Fisheries.=--This Province has risen to the rank of the greatest\r\nfish-producing Province in the Dominion. Besides its extensive salmon\r\nfisheries, it has, lying within easy distance of the northern part of\r\nits coast line, extremely rich halibut grounds, while herring are in\r\ngreat abundance all along its shores. These various branches of the\r\nfishing industry are being rapidly developed, but there is yet room for\r\ngreat expansion. The value of the fisheries of the Provinces for 1913\r\namounted to about 11 million dollars.\r\n\r\n=What Premier McBride says=:\r\n\r\n\"Millions of British money is finding investment in British Columbia,\r\nand there is scope for millions more. One of the advantages of British\r\nColumbia is that all of its industrial and other enterprises are of a\r\npermanent character. There is room for millions of people. We have the\r\nresources, the geographical situation, and the climate that will appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Our elementary school system is free and compulsory, and one of the\r\nmost efficient in the world, making ample provision, as it does, for\r\nambitious students to pass on to the universities of Canada, the United\r\nStates, and England. But we are also to have our own University.\"\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been attracted to the result of the opening of the\r\nPanama Canal on the shipping future of the ports at the coast.\r\n\r\n=Lakes and Rivers.=--The most important are the Columbia, which has a\r\ncourse of 600 miles in British Columbia; the Fraser, 750 miles long; the\r\nSkeena, 300 miles long; the Thompson, the Kootenay, the Stikine, the\r\nLiard, and the Peace. These with their tributaries drain an area of\r\none-tenth of the whole of the North American continent. The lake area\r\naggregates 1-1/2 million acres.\r\n\r\nOn the lakes and rivers first-class steamers give accommodation to the\r\nsettlements along the banks and in the valleys, and afford excellent\r\ntransportation for tourists. There are lines of steamers in service\r\nbetween Vancouver, Japan, and China; between Vancouver and Australia;\r\nbetween Vancouver and Mexico, and between Vancouver and England via the\r\nSuez Canal. These ocean communications of British Columbia are highly\r\nimportant. Vancouver is the terminus of the shortest route from\r\nLiverpool to Yokohama and all important points of the Far East. The\r\nProvince has a considerable coasting fleet, having direct connection\r\nwith Yukon and Alaska. There is not as yet a large Pacific marine of\r\nCanadian registry. Although in the service of Canadian interests the\r\ntonnage is largely British.\r\n\r\n=A Rich Province.=--British Columbia coal measures are sufficient to\r\nsupply the world for centuries. It possesses the greatest compact area\r\nof merchantable timber in the world. The mines are in the early stages\r\nof their development, and have already produced about 400 million\r\ndollars, of which coal contributed 122 million. The value of the mineral\r\nproduction in 1911 was 30 million dollars. The fisheries return an\r\naverage annual yield of nearly 10 million dollars. British Columbia's\r\ntrade, per head of population, is the largest in the world. The chief\r\nexports are salmon, coal, gold, silver, copper, lead, timber, masts and\r\nspars, furs and skins, whale-oil, sealskins, hops, and fruit.\r\n\r\n=Railways.=--The Canadian Pacific Railway has two main lines and several\r\nbranches making connection with United States railway systems, as well\r\nas operating on Vancouver Island. With the exception of one or two small\r\ngaps the Grand Trunk Pacific will have its line completed through\r\nCentral British Columbia this year. This will open up a very large area\r\nfor settlement. At the Pacific terminus in Prince Rupert, splendid\r\nsteamers connect with other portions of the Mainland and with Vancouver\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Northern has secured low grades across the Rockies and,\r\nmaking its way down the Fraser and North Thompson, finds an easy outlet\r\nat Port Mann near Vancouver. The Great Northern enters the Province at\r\npoints in the boundary. The provincial railway mileage is 1,854 miles\r\nwith 1,000 miles under construction.\r\n\r\n=Stock.=--Dairying pays handsomely in British Columbia. The local demand\r\nfor butter is constantly increasing and the prices secured are higher\r\nthan in Eastern Canada. The Province possesses many elements necessary\r\nto constitute it a great dairying country. There are extensive areas of\r\npastoral land in the interior, while increased cultivation in the lower\r\ncountry will form the necessary feeding ground. With a plentiful supply\r\nof good water, and luxuriant and nutritious grasses, there is every\r\nrequired facility added. Cattle raising on a large scale was formerly\r\none of the chief industries of the Province, and many of the large\r\nranches are still making money, but the tendency of late has been for\r\nsmaller herds and the improvement of the stock. Sheep raising is another\r\nbranch of agriculture capable of great expansion. Hogs, in small\r\nfarming, are probably the most profitable of live stock, owing to the\r\ngeneral demand for pork, bacon, ham, and lard, and much attention is now\r\nbeing given to raising them. Over 1 million dollars of hog products are\r\nimported annually, and prices are always high. The demand for good\r\nhorses, especially heavy draft and working animals, is always\r\nincreasing, and prices are consequently high.\r\n\r\n=Dairy Products.=--In 1912 this industry reached a valuation of nearly 4\r\nmillion dollars. Poultry raising is a branch of general farming which is\r\nbeginning to receive special attention in British Columbia. The home\r\nmarket is nowhere nearly supplied either with eggs or poultry, large\r\nquantities being imported from Manitoba, Ontario, California,\r\nWashington, and elsewhere. Good prices prevail at all seasons of the\r\nyear. Every portion of British Columbia is suitable for poultry raising.\r\nIn the Coast districts, hens, ducks, and geese can be raised to great\r\nadvantage, and the dry belts and uplands are particularly well adapted\r\nto turkeys.\r\n\r\n=Grain.=--Wheat is grown principally in the Fraser, Okanagan, and\r\nSpallumcheen Valleys and in the country around Kamloops. Barley of\r\nexcellent quality is grown in many parts of the Province. Oats are the\r\nprincipal grain crop, the quality and yield being good, and the demand\r\nbeyond the quantity grown. Potatoes, turnips, carrots, mangolds, and all\r\nother roots grow in profusion wherever their cultivation has been\r\nattempted. Hop culture is carried on in the Okanagan, Agassiz, and\r\nChilliwak districts. British Columbia hops command a good price in\r\nEngland and recently Eastern Canada and Australia have bid for them.\r\nSome attention has been given to the cultivation of sugar-beets,\r\ntobacco, and celery, and in each case with the most gratifying results,\r\nensuring an early expansion of operations in all of these lines.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 there was a total agricultural production in the Province of\r\nabout 14-1/2 million dollars, but there was imported another 15 million\r\ndollars' worth.\r\n\r\nBritish Columbia agriculturists and fruit growers are particularly\r\nfortunate in having a splendid home market for their products, and for\r\ntheir surplus there is the enormous present and illimitable future\r\ndemand of the Prairie Provinces, assuring always good prices and ready\r\nsale for everything they produce.\r\n\r\n=Game.=--For big-game hunters there are moose, wapiti, sheep, caribou,\r\ngoat, deer, grizzly, black, and brown bear, wolves, panthers, lynx, and\r\nwild cats; in the way of small game there is the best snipe shooting\r\nprocurable anywhere, and duck and geese, prairie chicken, grouse, and\r\nquail abound. In addition to sport with rifle and shot gun, salmon\r\nfishing, unknown elsewhere, trout and grayling fishing, unsurpassed in\r\nany other country, may be enjoyed at a minimum of cost and\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In Central British Columbia there is an area of\r\nagricultural land that is unexcelled anywhere. Wonderful yields of all\r\nsmall grains are reported.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WINS IN CENTRAL CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adaptable and friendly man going into Canada will find a welcome\r\nawaiting him. There is room for everybody. The man already established,\r\nthe railways, and the Government are equally anxious to secure further\r\nimmigration of the right kind. The new man is not looked upon as an\r\nintruder but as a producer of new wealth, an enricher of the\r\ncommonwealth. The new man should buy his tools as he needs them. Until\r\nhe has more than thirty acres under crop he can work with a neighbour,\r\nin exchange for the services of a binder. He may not need to build a\r\ngranary for two or three years. A cow is a good investment, and a\r\nvegetable garden easily pays its own way.\r\n\r\nA few broad general suggestions might be made to the settlers who come\r\nin with varying capital at their command.\r\n\r\n=The Man Who Has Less Than $300.=--This man had better work for wages for\r\nthe first year. He can either hire out to established farmers or find\r\nemployment on railway construction work. During the year, opportunity\r\nmay open up for him to take up his free grant or make the first payment\r\non a quarter-section that he would like to purchase.\r\n\r\n=The Man Who Has $600.=--Get hold of your 160-acre free homestead at once,\r\nbuild your shack, and proceed with your homestead duties. During the six\r\nmonths that you are free to absent yourself from your homestead, hire\r\nout to some successful farmer and get enough to tide you over the other\r\nhalf of the year which you must spend in residence upon the land. When\r\nyou have put in six months' residence during each of these years and\r\nhave complied with the improvement conditions required by the Land Act,\r\nyou become the absolute owner.\r\n\r\n=The Man Who Has $1,000.=--Either homestead a farm or purchase one on the\r\ninstallment plan, and get to work at once. A small house and out\r\nbuildings will be required, with horses or oxen, a plough, a wagon, etc.\r\nWorking out in the harvest season will be needed to bring in money to\r\ntide over the winter and get the crop sown in good condition. As the\r\ncrop grows, opportunity is given to make the house comfortable, to look\r\naround and plan ahead.\r\n\r\n=What $1,500 Will Buy.=--No farmer should come expecting to make a\r\nhomestead pay its own way the first year. He needs buildings, an\r\nequipment, and money for the maintenance of himself and family, until\r\nhis first harvest can be garnered. After securing his land and putting\r\nup his buildings, $1,500 will give him a fairly good equipment to begin\r\nwith. This will probably be expended as under:\r\n\r\n  1 team of good horses  $450.00\r\n  1 harvester             165.00\r\n  4 milch cows at $65     260.00\r\n  1 seeder                113.00\r\n  1 strong wagon           94.00\r\n  4 hogs at $25           100.00\r\n  4 sheep at $8            32.00\r\n  1 set strong harness     35.00\r\n  1 rough sleigh           37.00\r\n  1 disc harrow            36.00\r\n  1 breaking plough        25.00\r\n  1 mowing machine         60.00\r\n  1 stubble plough         20.00\r\n  1 harrow                 20.00\r\n    Other smaller tools    40.00\r\n    Barnyard fowls         40.00\r\n        Total           $1527.00\r\n\r\nIf the settler locates early in the season he may get in a crop of\r\npotatoes or oats in May or early June.\r\n\r\n=Will a Quarter-Section Pay?=--\"Will the tilling of a quarter of a section\r\n(160 acres) pay?\" when asked of those who have tried it provokes the\r\ninvariable answer that \"It will and does pay.\" \"We, or those following\r\nus, will make less than that pay,\" said one who had proved up on a\r\nhomestead. Another pointed to the fact that many of those who commenced\r\non homesteads are now owners of other quarters--and even larger areas,\r\nshowing that they have progressed in obtaining more land, while others\r\nstill have stuck to the homestead quarter and this year are marketing as\r\nmuch as $2,000 worth of grain and often nearer $3,000.\r\n\r\n=Shall You Buy, Rent or Homestead?=--The question is one that Canadian\r\nGovernment officials are frequently asked, especially in the homes of a\r\nfamily of boys who have become interested in Central Canada. If the\r\nyoung man has grit and inexperience let him homestead. Treating this\r\nsubject in a newspaper article, a correspondent very tersely says, \"He\r\nwill survive the ordeal and gain his experience at less cost.\"\r\n\r\nAnother has ample knowledge of farming practice, experience in farm\r\nmanagement, but lacks pluck and staying power and the capacity to\r\nendure. The food for thought and opportunity for action provided by the\r\nmanagement of an improved farm would be just the stimulus required to\r\nmake him settle into harness and \"work out his own salvation in fear and\r\ntrembling.\"\r\n\r\nMany men make excellent, progressive, broad-gauge farmers, by renting,\r\nor buying an improved farm in a settled district and keeping in touch\r\nwith more advanced thought and methods. Their immediate financial\r\nsuccess may not be so great; their ultimate success will be much\r\ngreater, for they have been saved from narrow-gauge ways and withering\r\nat the top.\r\n\r\nLet the boy take the route that appeals to him. Don't force him to\r\nhomestead if he pines to rent. Don't try to keep him at home if\r\nhomesteading looks good to him. The thing to remember is that success\r\nmay be achieved by any one of the three routes. If the foundation is all\r\nright, hard work the method, and thoroughness the motto, it makes little\r\ndifference what road is taken--whether homesteading, buying, or\r\nrenting--Central Canada is big enough, and good farming profitable\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alfalfa is a crop that is now assured in any of the\r\nProvinces of Western Canada. The above is a Manitoba illustration, but\r\nwill apply to the other Provinces.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR OPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nContentment is not necessarily achieved by accomplishments that benefit\r\nthe world--the world outside the small sphere in which we move; but when\r\naccompanied by such accomplishments how the satisfaction broadens! The\r\ngenius whose inventions have been of service to mankind is in a plane\r\nfar above that of the simple-minded individual who finds contentment in\r\nthe little things of life affecting himself alone.\r\n\r\nFeeding the world is no mean accomplishment. Nor is it a vain or\r\ntrifling boast to say that this is what the farmer of Western Canada has\r\nstarted out to do. He is sure to find contentment. Part of his\r\ncontentment will be the consciousness of doing world-wide good; part of\r\nit will be the personal enjoyment of an inspiring liberty and\r\nindependence. Afield and abroad his friends will learn what he is doing.\r\nSoon they too will become partners in a work that not only betters their\r\nown condition, but ministers to the needs of the whole world in the\r\nraising of products that go to \"feed the world.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to those who desire this broad contentment that the Canadian\r\nGovernment extends the heartiest welcome, and to such men it offers the\r\nvast opportunities of a country richer in possibilities than any other\r\nin the present century. To the man on the farm in other regions, whom\r\nsuccess has followed with slow tread; to the farmer's son, who has\r\nwatched with unsatisfied eye the unrequited efforts of his forbears,\r\nseeing the life that has made his mother a \"drudge,\" noting the struggle\r\nwhich has stooped his father's shoulders, dimmed his vision, dwarfed his\r\nspirit, and returned nothing but existence and a meagre bank account--it\r\nis to these men, father and son, that the opportunities of Western\r\nCanada are presented. To them an invitation is extended to secure the\r\ncontentment found in personal progress and world-wide benefaction.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of Western Canada are no longer new and untried.\r\nTwelve or fifteen years of cultivation have made it a vital, living\r\nland, and placed it on the level with the greatest of the food-producing\r\ncountries. That same redundant energy will shortly make it the richly\r\nladen \"bread basket\" not of England only, but of the entire world.\r\n\r\nHere every condition is a health bringer as well as a wealth bringer. A\r\nfew months in this \"New World\" to which you are invited and where\r\nrejuvenating physical and mental changes are wrought; where before hard\r\nwork was drudgery, it is now a delight; where nothing but fresh trouble\r\ndarkened the horizon, the outlook is now a rainbow of promise. Industry\r\nis seasoned with the compelling spirit of adventure, and the thought of\r\nthe coming harvest constantly lightens the burden of labor.\r\n\r\nThe crowded city dweller, curbing those natural desires for\r\nhome-building that are as natural as breathing, will find in Western\r\nCanada a country where nothing is so plentiful as space. And in building\r\nhis home here he is surely laying the foundation for a competence, and\r\nvery often for a fortune. Along with prosperity there is abounding\r\nhappiness and good fellowship in the farming communities. The\r\nhomesteader, beginning in a modest way, rears his first habitation with\r\npractical and serviceable ends in view. His next-door neighbours are\r\nready and willing to help him put a roof over his head. There is a\r\nsplendid lend-a-hand sentiment mixed with the vigorous climate. The\r\nfirst harvest, like all succeeding harvests, comes quickly, because the\r\nsoil is a lightning producer. All summer long the settler has dreamed of\r\nnothing but acres of waving grain; with the autumn the sight of hopes\r\nfulfilled compensates him for his months of toil. In due time the crop\r\nis harvested and marketed, the debts are wiped out, and the settler\r\nproudly opens his bank account.\r\n\r\nWhen he has turned the golden grain into the golden coin of the realm he\r\nrealizes for the first time what it means to be liberally paid for the\r\nwork of his hand and brain. The reward of the farmer in Western Canada\r\nis sure; and as the soil responds faithfully to his husbandry, year\r\nafter year, he looks back upon the old conditions he has left with\r\ndevout thankfulness that they are past.\r\n\r\nAfter the bumper harvest the happy young farmer can send for the wife or\r\nthe bride-to-be whom he has left \"back home.\" A few years ago \"down on\r\nthe farm\" was an expression synonymous with isolation, loneliness and\r\nprimitive living. Not so to-day. Whatever his previous outlook, the\r\nsettler in Western Canada cannot go on raising large crops and selling\r\nhis products for high prices without enlarging his view of life in\r\ngeneral and bettering his material conditions. He needs to practice no\r\nrigid economy. He can afford to supply his wife and children with all\r\nthe best the markets provide. An up-to-date farm house in Manitoba,\r\nSaskatchewan, or Alberta has very much the same conveniences as the\r\naverage home of the well-to-do in any other part of the world. Nine\r\ntimes out of ten it is because he feels confident he can increase the\r\ncomfort and happiness of his wife and children that the settler\r\nemigrates to Western Canada.\r\n\r\nWestern Canada is no longer a land calling only to the hardy young\r\nadventurer; it calls to the settler and to his wife and children. And\r\nwith its invitation goes the promise not only of larger financial\r\nreturns, but of domestic happiness in a pure, wholesome environment.\r\n\r\nRailroads bring to the doors of the settler the fruits of all countries\r\nand here is to hand the use of every modern idea and invention. The\r\nclimate is the most health-giving, all-year kind. There is latent riches\r\nin the soil, produced by centuries of accumulation of decayed\r\nvegetation, and the fat producing qualities of the native grasses are\r\nunexcelled in any part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe soil produces the best qualities of wheat, oats, barley, flax, and\r\nall kinds of vegetables and roots in less time than many districts\r\nfarther south in the states. There are inexhaustible coal deposits and\r\nnatural gas and oil fields, as yet unknown in extent or production. The\r\nCanadian Rockies, forming a western boundary to the great agricultural\r\narea, supply the needed mineral and building materials. In the north and\r\nwest there are immense forests. Lakes and rivers are capable of an\r\nenormous development for power purposes, besides supplying an abundance\r\nof food and game fishes, and forests and prairies are full of big and\r\nsmall game of all kinds.\r\n\r\nBut all this is yet undeveloped and unused. All kinds of live stock can\r\nbe raised here for less money than in the more thickly populated\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nOne Western Canada farmer in 1912 secured a crop of Marquis wheat,\r\nyielding 76 bushels per acre. This is spoken of as a record yield, and\r\nthis is doubtless true, but several cases have been brought to notice\r\nwhere yields almost as large have been produced, and in different parts\r\nof the country. During the past year there have been reported many\r\nyields of from 35 to 45 bushels of wheat to the acre. Oats, too, were a\r\nsuccessful crop and so was the barley and oat crop. Wheat that would\r\nyield 40 bushels per acre, would bring on the market 70 cents (a fair\r\nfigure) per bushel, a gross return of $28 per acre. Allow $12 per acre\r\n(an outside figure) there would be a balance of $16 per acre net profit.\r\nThis figure should satisfy anyone having land that cost less than $100\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the number of questions asked daily, it has been deemed\r\nadvisable to put in condensed form, such questions as most naturally\r\noccur, giving the answers which experience dictates as appropriate,\r\nconveying the information commonly asked for. If the reader does not\r\nfind here the answer to his particular difficulty, a letter to the\r\nSuperintendent, or to any Government Agent, will secure full\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n=1. Where are the lands referred to?=\r\n\r\nIn Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and in British Columbia.\r\n\r\n=2. What kind of land is it?=\r\n\r\nThe land is mostly prairie (except in British Columbia) and can be\r\nsecured free from timber and stones, if desired, the soil being the very\r\nbest alluvial black loam from one to two feet deep, with a clay subsoil.\r\nIt is just rolling enough to give good drainage, and in places there is\r\nplenty of timber, while some is underlaid with good coal.\r\n\r\n=3. If the land is what you say, why is the Government giving it away?=\r\n\r\nThe Government, knowing that agriculture is the foundation of a\r\nprogressive country, and that large yields of farm produce insure\r\nprosperity in all other branches of business, is doing everything in its\r\npower to encourage settlement. It is much better for each man to own his\r\nown farm, therefore a free grant of 160 acres is given to every man who\r\nwill reside upon and cultivate it.\r\n\r\n=4. Is it timber or prairie land?=\r\n\r\nThe province of Manitoba has considerable open prairie, especially in\r\nthe southwest; towards the centre it is parklike with some timber belts\r\nin parts.\r\n\r\nThe southern parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta are chiefly open prairie\r\nwith growths of timber along the streams. As you go north or northwest\r\nabout 20 per cent of the country may be said to be timbered.\r\n\r\n=5. Then as to climate?=\r\n\r\nThe summer days are warm and the nights cool. The fall and spring are\r\nmost delightful, although it may be said that winter breaks almost into\r\nsummer, and the latter lasts until October. Winters are pleasant and\r\nhealthful. There are no pulmonary or other endemic complaints. Snow\r\nbegins to fall about the middle of November and in March there is\r\ngenerally very little. Near the Rockies the snowfall is not as heavy as\r\nfarther east, and the chinook winds have a tempering influence. The\r\nabsence of the snowfall would be regretted by the farmer. Nature has\r\ngenerously provided for every mile of the country, and there is really\r\nvery little choice with the exception that farther west the climate is\r\nsomewhat milder.\r\n\r\n=6. Is there sufficient rainfall?=\r\n\r\nA sufficient supply can be relied upon. The most rain falls in May and\r\nJune, when most needed.\r\n\r\n=7. What are the roads like?=\r\n\r\nBridges and culverts are built where needed, and roadways are usually\r\ngraded up; but not gravelled or macadamized. The natural prairie road is\r\nsuperior to most manufactured roads, and afford good travelling in\r\nordinary seasons and every fall and winter.\r\n\r\n=8. What sort of people are settled there, and is English generally\r\nspoken?=\r\n\r\nCanadians, English, Scotch, Irish, French, and English-speaking\r\nAmericans (who are going in, in large numbers), with Germans and\r\nScandinavians. English is the language of the country, and is spoken\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n=9. Will I have to change my citizenship if I go to Canada?=\r\n\r\nAn alien, before making entry for free homestead land, must declare his\r\nintention of becoming a British subject and become naturalized before\r\nobtaining patent for his land. In the meanwhile he can hold possession,\r\nand exercise right of ownership. If not a British subject he must reside\r\nthree years to become naturalized. To become a British subject a settler\r\nof foreign birth should make application to anyone authorized to\r\nadminister oaths in a Canadian Court. An alien may purchase land from\r\nany of the railway or land companies and hold title deed without\r\nchanging his citizenship.\r\n\r\n=10. How about American money?=\r\n\r\nAmerican money is taken everywhere in Central Canada at its face value.\r\n\r\n=11. Can a man who has used his homestead right in the United States take\r\na homestead in Canada?=\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n=12. If a British subject has taken out \"citizen papers\" in the United\r\nStates how does he stand in Canada?=\r\n\r\nHe must be \"repatriated,\" i.e., take out a certificate of\r\nnaturalization, which can be done after three months' residence in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n=13. What grains are raised in Central Canada?=\r\n\r\nWheat (winter and spring), oats, barley, flax, speltz, rye and other\r\nsmall grains, and corn is grown chiefly for silo purposes.\r\n\r\n=14. How long does it take wheat to mature?=\r\n\r\nThe average time is from 100 to 118 days. This short time in accounted\r\nfor by the long hours of sunlight which during the growing and ripening\r\nseason, will average 16 hours a day.\r\n\r\n=15. Can a man raise a crop on the first breaking of his land?=\r\n\r\nYes, but it is not well to use the land for any other purpose the first\r\nyear than for raising garden vegetables, or perhaps a crop of flax, as\r\nit is necessarily rough on account of the heavy sod not having had time\r\nto rot and become workable. Good yields of oats have been reported on\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\n=16. Is there plenty of hay available?=\r\n\r\nIn many parts there is sufficient wild hay meadow on government or\r\nvacant land, which may be rented at a very low rental, if you have not\r\nenough on your own farm. Experience has proven that timothy, brome,\r\nclover and other cultivated grasses do well. Yields of brome have been\r\nreported from two to four tons per acre. Alfalfa under proper\r\ncultivation in many places gives successful yields.\r\n\r\n=17. Do vegetables thrive and what kinds are grown?=\r\n\r\nPotatoes, turnips, carrots, beets, onions, parsnips, cabbages, peas,\r\nbeans, celery, pumpkins, tomatoes, squash, melons, etc., are unequalled\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n=18. Can fruit be raised and what varieties?=\r\n\r\nSmall fruits grow wild. The cultivated are plums, cranberries,\r\nstrawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, currants. In British Columbia\r\nfruit growing of all kinds is carried on very extensively and\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n=19. About what time does seeding begin?=\r\n\r\nAs a rule farmers begin their seeding from the first to the fifteenth of\r\nApril, sometimes continuing well into May. The average yield of all\r\ngrains in Central Canada would be largely increased, did not some\r\nfarmers unwisely do seeding until the middle of June.\r\n\r\n=20. How is it for stock raising?=\r\n\r\nThe country has no equal. In many parts cattle and horses are not housed\r\nthroughout the winter, and so nutritious are the wild grasses that stock\r\nis marketed without having been fed any grain.\r\n\r\n=21. In what way can I secure land in Central Canada?=\r\n\r\nBy homesteading, or purchasing from railway or land companies. The\r\nDominion Government has no land for sale. The British Columbia\r\nGovernment sells land to actual settlers at low figures.\r\n\r\n=22. Can I get a map or list of lands vacant and open to homestead entry?=\r\n\r\nIt has been found impracticable to keep a publication of that kind up to\r\ndate, owing to the daily changes. An intending settler on reaching the\r\ndistrict he selects should enquire of the Dominion Lands Agent what\r\nlands are vacant in that particular locality, finally narrowing down the\r\nenquiry to a township or two, diagrams of which, with the vacant lands\r\nmarked, will be supplied free. A competent land guide can be had.\r\n\r\n=23. How far are homestead lands from lines of railway?=\r\n\r\nThey vary, but at present the nearest will be from 15 to 20 miles.\r\nRailways are being built into the new districts.\r\n\r\n=24. In which districts are located the most and best available\r\nhomesteads?=\r\n\r\nThe character of homestead wanted by the settler will decide this. Very\r\nfew homesteads are vacant in the southern districts; towards the centre\r\nand north portions of the provinces, homesteads are plentiful. They\r\ncomprise a territory in which wood for building purposes and fuel are\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\n=25. Is there any good land close to the Rocky Mountains?=\r\n\r\nThe nearer you approach the mountains the more hilly it becomes, and the\r\nelevation is too great for grain raising. Cattle and horses do well.\r\n\r\n=26. If a man take his family there before he selects a homestead can he\r\nget temporary accommodation?=\r\n\r\nAt the following places the Government maintains Immigration halls with\r\nfree temporary accommodation for those desiring such and supplying their\r\nown provisions. It is always better for the head of the family, or such\r\nmember of it as may be entitled to homestead, to select and make entry\r\nfor lands before moving family:\r\n\r\nBiggar, Brandon, Calgary, Caster, Cereal, Edmonton, Edson, Emerson,\r\nEntwistle, Gravelburg, Herbert, Kerrobert, Lloydminster, Lethbridge,\r\nMoose Jaw, North Battleford, North Portal, Prince Albert, Regina,\r\nSaskatoon, Strathcona, South Battleford, Swift Current, Tisdale, Unity,\r\nVegreville, Vermilion, Viking, Virden, Wainwright, Wilkie, Yonkers.\r\n\r\n=27. Where must I make my homestead entry?=\r\n\r\nAt the Dominion Lands Office for the district.\r\n\r\n=28. Can homestead lands he reserved for a minor?=\r\n\r\nAn agent of Dominion Lands may reserve a quarter-section for a minor\r\nover 17 years of age until he is 18, if his father, or other near\r\nrelative live upon homestead or upon farming land owned, not less than\r\n80 acres, within nine miles of reserved homestead. The minor must make\r\nentry in person within one month after becoming 18 years of age.\r\n\r\n=29. Can a person borrow money on a homestead before receiving patent?=\r\n\r\nNo; contrary to Dominion Lands Act.\r\n\r\n=30. Would the time I was away working for a neighbour, or on the\r\nrailway, or other work count as time on my homestead?=\r\n\r\nOnly actual residence on your homestead will count, and you must reside\r\non homestead six months in each of three years.\r\n\r\n=31. Is it permissible to reside with brother, who has filed on adjoining\r\nland?=\r\n\r\nA homesteader may reside with father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or\r\nsister on farming land owned solely by him or her, not less than 80\r\nacres, or upon homestead entered for by him or her not more than nine\r\nmiles from entrant's homestead. Fifty acres of homestead must be brought\r\nunder cultivation, instead of 30 acres, as is the case when there is\r\ndirect residence.\r\n\r\n=32. How shall I know what to do or where to go when I reach there?=\r\n\r\nMake a careful study of this pamphlet and decide in a general way on the\r\ndistrict in which you wish to settle. Then put yourself in communication\r\nwith your nearest Canadian Government Agent, whose name appears on the\r\nsecond page of cover. At Winnipeg, and in the offices of any of the\r\nDominion Lands Agents in Central Canada, are maps showing vacant lands.\r\nHaving decided on the district where you will make your home, the\r\nservices of a competent land guide may be secured to assist in locating.\r\n\r\n=33. What is the best way to get there?=\r\n\r\nWrite your nearest Canadian Government Agent for routes, and settlers'\r\nlow railway rate certificate good from the Canadian boundary to\r\ndestination for passengers and freight.\r\n\r\n=34. How much baggage will I be allowed on the Canadian railways?=\r\n\r\n150 pounds for each full ticket.\r\n\r\n=35. Are settlers' effects bonded through to destination, or are they\r\nexamined at the boundary?=\r\n\r\nIf settler accompanies effects they will be examined at the boundary,\r\nwithout any trouble; if effects are unaccompanied they will go through\r\nto the nearest bonding (or customs) point to destination.\r\n\r\n=36. In case settler's family follow him what about railway rates?=\r\n\r\nOn application to Canadian Government Agent, settlers' low railway rate\r\ncertificate will be forwarded, and they will be given the settlers'\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\n=37. What is the duty on horses and cattle if a settler should want to\r\ntake in more than the number allowed free into Canada?=\r\n\r\nWhen for the improvement of stock free; otherwise, over one year old,\r\nthey will be valued at a minimum of $50 per head, and duty will be 25\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n=38. How much money must one have to start grain farming and how little\r\ncan he do with if he goes ranching?=\r\n\r\nSee Chapter \"What wins in Central Canada,\" page 37.\r\n\r\n=39. How can I procure lands for ranching?=\r\n\r\nThey may be leased from the Government at a low rental. Write for full\r\nparticulars to Secretary of the Interior, Ottawa, Canada.\r\n\r\n=40. In those parts which are better for cattle and sheep than for grain,\r\nwhat does a man do if he has only 160 acres?=\r\n\r\nIf a settler should desire to go into stock raising and his\r\nquarter-section of 160 acres should not prove sufficient to furnish\r\npasture for his stock, he can make application to the Land Commissioner\r\nfor a lease for grazing lands for a term of twenty-one years, at a very\r\nlow cost.\r\n\r\n=41. Where is information to be had about British Columbia?=\r\n\r\nApply to Secretary Provincial Bureau of Information, Victoria, B. C.\r\n\r\n=42. Is living expensive?=\r\n\r\nSugar, granulated, 14 to 18 lbs. for $1, according to fluctuation of\r\nmarket. Tea, 30 to 50 cents a lb.; coffee, 30 to 45 cents a lb.; flour,\r\n$2.25 to $3.00 per 98 lbs. Dry goods about Eastern Canada prices. Cotton\r\nsomewhat dearer than in United States, and woollen goods noticeably\r\ncheaper. Stoves and furniture somewhat higher than eastern prices, owing\r\nto freight charges.\r\n\r\n=43. Are the taxes high?=\r\n\r\nNo. Having no expensive system of municipal or county organization,\r\ntaxes are necessarily low. Each quarter-section of land, consisting of\r\n160 acres, owned or occupied, is taxed very low. The only other taxes\r\nare for schools. In the locations where the settlers have formed school\r\ndistricts the total tax for all purposes on a quarter-section amounts to\r\nfrom $10 to $14.50 per annum.\r\n\r\n=44. Does the Government tax the settler if he lets his cattle run on\r\nGovernment lands? If they fence their land, is he obliged to fence his\r\nalso?=\r\n\r\nThe settler is not required to pay a tax for allowing his cattle to run\r\non Government land, but it is advisable to lease land from the\r\nGovernment for haying or grazing purposes, when needed. If one fences\r\nhis land, his adjoining neighbour has to stand a proportionate share of\r\nthe cost of the fence adjoining his property, or build one-half of it\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n=45. Where can a settler sell what he raises? Is there any competition\r\namongst buyers, or has he got to sell for anything he can get?=\r\n\r\nA system of elevators is established by railway companies and others\r\nthroughout the entire West. Grain is bought at these and forwarded to\r\nthe great markets in other parts of Canada, the United States, and\r\nEurope. Canadian flour mills, oatmeal mills, and breweries use millions\r\nof bushels of grain annually. To the west and northwest of Central\r\nCanada lie mining regions, which are dependent upon the prairies for\r\nsupplies and will to a great extent continue to be. Beef is bought on\r\nthe hoof at the home of the farmer or rancher. Buyers scour the country\r\nin quest of this product.\r\n\r\n=46. Where can material for a house and sheds be procured, and about what\r\nwould it cost? What about fuel? Do people suffer from the cold?=\r\n\r\nThough there are large tracts of forest in the Canadian West there are\r\nlocalities where building timber and material is limited, but this has\r\nnot proven any drawback as the Government has made provision that should\r\na man settle on a quarter-section deprived of timber, he can, by making\r\napplication to the Dominion Lands Agent, obtain a permit to cut on\r\nGovernment lands free of charge the following, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. 3,000 lineal feet of building timber, measuring no more than 12\r\ninches at the butt, or 9,250 feet board measure. 2. 400 roofing poles.\r\n3. 2,000 fencing rails and 500 fence posts, 7 feet long, and not\r\nexceeding five (5) inches in diameter at the small end. 4. 30 cords of\r\ndry fuel wood for firewood.\r\n\r\nThe settler has only the expense of the cutting and hauling to his\r\nhomestead. The principal districts are within easy reach of firewood;\r\nthe settlers of Alberta and Saskatchewan are particularly favoured,\r\nespecially along the various streams, from some of which they get all\r\nthe coal they require, at a trifling cost. No one in the country need\r\nsuffer from the cold on account of scarcity of fuel.\r\n\r\n=47. Is it advisable to go into a new country during the winter months\r\nwith uncertain weather conditions?=\r\n\r\nA few years ago, when settlement was sparse, settlers were advised to\r\nwait until March or April. Now that so many have friends in Western\r\nCanada there need be no hesitation when to start. Lines of railway\r\npenetrate most of the settled districts, and no one need go far from\r\nneighbours already settled. There is no longer the dread of pioneering,\r\nand it is robbed of the romance that once surrounded it. With farm\r\nalready selected, it is perfectly safe, and to the prospective\r\nhomesteader he can get some sort of occupation until early spring, when\r\nhe will be on the ground ready for it.\r\n\r\n=48. What does lumber cost?=\r\n\r\nSpruce boards and dimensions, about $20 per thousand feet; shiplap, $23\r\nto $28; flooring and siding, $25 up, according to quality; cedar\r\nshingles, from $3.50 to $4.25 per thousand. These prices fluctuate.\r\n\r\n=49. What chance is there for employment when a man first goes there and\r\nisn't working on his land?=\r\n\r\nThere are different industries through the country, outside of farming\r\nand ranching, such as sawmills, flour mills, brick-yards, railroad\r\nbuilding in the summer, and lumbering in the winter. The chances for\r\nemployment are good as a large percentage of those going in and those\r\nalready there farm so much that they must have help, and pay good wages.\r\nDuring the past two seasons from twenty to thirty thousand farm\r\nlabourers have been brought in each year from the eastern Provinces and\r\nthe United States to assist in caring for the large crops. The capable\r\nand willing worker is sure to succeed in Canada.\r\n\r\n=50. Can I get employment with a farmer so as to become acquainted with\r\nlocal conditions?=\r\n\r\nThis can be done through the Commissioner of Immigration at Winnipeg,\r\nwho is in a position to offer engagements with well established farmers.\r\nMen experienced in agriculture may expect to receive from $25 up per\r\nmonth with board and lodging, engagements, if desired, to extend for\r\ntwelve months. Summer wages are from $30 to $35 per month; winter wages\r\n$10 to $15. During harvest wages are higher than this.\r\n\r\n=51. If I have had no experience and simply desire to learn farming in\r\nCentral Canada before starting on my own account?=\r\n\r\nYoung men and others unacquainted with farm life, willing to accept from\r\n$8 up per month, including board and lodging, will find positions\r\nthrough the Government officers at Winnipeg. Wages are dependent upon\r\nexperience and qualification. After working for a year in this way, the\r\nknowledge acquired will be sufficient to justify you in securing and\r\nfarming on your own account.\r\n\r\n=52. Are there any schools outside the towns?=\r\n\r\nSchool districts cannot exceed five miles in length or breadth, and must\r\ncontain at least four actual residents, and twelve children between the\r\nages of five and sixteen. In almost every locality, where these\r\nconditions exist, schools have been established.\r\n\r\n=53. Are churches numerous?=\r\n\r\nThe various denominations are well represented and churches are being\r\nbuilt rapidly even in the most remote districts.\r\n\r\n=54. Can water be secured at reasonable depth?=\r\n\r\nIn most places it can be had at from fifteen to forty feet, while in\r\nother places wells have been sunk to fifty or sixty feet.\r\n\r\n=55. Where are free homesteads to-day, and how far from railway?=\r\n\r\nIn some well settled districts it may be possible to secure one by\r\ncancelling, but such chances are few. Between the lakes in Manitoba as\r\nwell as north and southeast of Winnipeg. In the central portions of\r\nSaskatchewan, Alberta and west of Moose Jaw and Swift Current. A\r\nsplendid homestead area is that lying north of Battleford, and between\r\nPrince Albert and Edmonton north of the Canadian Northern railway. One\r\nwill have to go at least twelve or fifteen miles from a line of railway\r\nat present, but extensions will soon make many homesteads available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUABLE HINTS FOR THE MAN ABOUT TO START\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newcomer may start for Western Canada during any month in the year.\r\nRailroads carry him to a short distance of his new home, the country\r\nroads are good, and there is settlement in all parts, so that shelter is\r\neasily reached. Temporary provision is required for the family's\r\narrival, when better may be made. If going in the winter months, it is\r\nwell to have a pair of good strong sleds. As teams cost $5 a day take\r\nalong your horses and do your own hauling. As they require care, write\r\nahead to some livery barn for room. In shipping your horses have them\r\nloaded by the best shipper in your home town. For feeding on the way,\r\nput in two-by-four cleats breast high on the horses, and fix to fit the\r\nend of a stout trough which is dropped in, afterwards nailing on a top\r\ncleat. If they have been used to corn take along twenty bushels for each\r\nhorse, if possible, not to feed alone along the way, but to use while\r\nbreaking them in to an oat diet. You need both hay and oat straw on the\r\ncars. The new arrival may have to pay $7 a ton for hay and 40 cents per\r\nbushel for oats. Railroad construction consumes lots of both, and not\r\nhalf the farmers take time in the fall to put up plenty of hay. Bring\r\nall the horses you can. Five big horses can pull a twelve-inch gang\r\nthrough the sod, but six can do it easier, and you can use five on the\r\nharrow. You can hitch a team to a goat or scrubber, as they call them\r\nhere, and lead them behind the drill, making your ground smooth and\r\npacking it lightly, as you put in the seed. If you have been intending\r\nto bring eight horses, bring twelve; if you were going to bring twelve,\r\nbring sixteen. The first two years on the new land is hard on horses,\r\nand you will need plenty. If you have any spare time or can get help,\r\nthey bring in money. I know two men who cleared over $600 apiece doing\r\noutside work this last summer. They worked on the roads, in harvest and\r\nthreshing, and received $5 per day for man and team. One can get all the\r\noutside breaking one's team can do at $4 per acre, so horse power is the\r\nmain thing.\r\n\r\nTake a supply of meat along, also lard, canned goods, and other things\r\nfor your cellar. One settler took a sugar barrel packed with canned\r\nfruit, and had not a single can broken or frozen, wrapping each in a\r\nwhole newspaper and then packing in between with old rags, worn out\r\nunderwear, old vests, and such goods as might otherwise be thrown away.\r\nRemember there is no old attic or store-room to go to on the new farm.\r\nThe same settler says: \"Cooked goods are also good. In the cold weather\r\nwe kept and used beef that had been roasted two weeks before, and a\r\nbushel of cookies lasted well into the summer, keeping fresh in a tin\r\nbox. Bring your cows and also your separator. The latter will not sell\r\nfor much at the sale and is useful here, as you have no place to store\r\nquantities of milk. Bring at least your two best cows with you on the\r\njourney. We had milk all along the road and furnished the dining car\r\ncooks (we had a diner on our freight train) for favors they extended.\r\nThen when we landed we found that milk and cream were scarce, and butter\r\nof the farm variety out of range.\r\n\r\n\"We packed two one-gallon jars before we moved and also some to use on\r\nthe way. This lasted fresh and sweet until it was all used and saved us\r\nthe trouble of churning or saving cream, hence we lived high on cream\r\nfor the first few weeks. It came in handy making corn starch, as well as\r\non our fruit and in a dozen other ways. We also had a nice big box of\r\ngroceries handy and all selected for emergency. Corn starch, tapioca and\r\nsimilar packages are easy to handle while moving, and a big box of such\r\nthings made cooking easy for the first few weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Do not sell anything that can be used in your new farming. Old belts,\r\nsingletrees, doubletrees, and such goods are worth far more away out on\r\nthe prairies than on the old improved farm, and they will cost more\r\nhere. We even brought our best big rugs and every carpet, even having\r\nmore carpets than we had rooms. Your new home may not be as warm as the\r\nold one. We laid down a carpet and put a big rug right on top of that on\r\nthe floor, and then we were comfortable in our rough house. Bring all\r\nsorts of tools and wagon gears with you; you will save money by doing\r\nso, anvil, drills, old bolts, and screws, etc., come in handy. We\r\nbrought pieces of hardwood for doubletrees and unexpected uses.\r\n\r\n\"Bring your stock remedies. You will be far from a veterinarian. Boracic\r\nacid comes in handy, so does a medicine cabinet for the household, with\r\ncarbolic salve, liniments, etc.\r\n\r\n\"One of the first things you will need is a hayrack, and you will not\r\nhave time to build one before it is needed, so take the old one or build\r\na new one and take it with you. It can be used for crating and for\r\npartitions and other purposes in loading the car. Make the sides of the\r\nrack quite close and have a solid bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Bring along your base-burner. I am writing by a hard coal fire in a\r\nround oak stove, and it makes a splendid heat. Better soft coal than you\r\never burned can be had at $9.50 per ton, and hard coal is $13. Wood is\r\nplentiful in the parks, chiefly dry poplar and a species of willow.\r\n\r\n\"So far from town one needs big supplies of kerosene, so bring a steel\r\nbarrel that will not become leaky. You can buy oil cheaper by the barrel\r\nand it saves trouble. Also bring a good oil stove. It will do the baking\r\nand save hauling fuel in the long working season.\r\n\r\n\"One thing we highly appreciated was a small tank we had made to carry\r\nwater in the cars for the horses. It was made to hold two barrels, was\r\nabout three feet in diameter and four high, and had the top soldered on,\r\nwith a lid just large enough to get in a pail. This was the best\r\narrangement on the train for hauling water. After we landed we had to\r\nhaul water for our house use and the tank was very useful to draw up a\r\ncouple of barrels and have a big supply on hand and no slopping when\r\nhauling.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOMINION OF CANADA AND NEWFOUNDLAND 1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES\r\n\r\nObvious printer's errors, including punctuation have been silently\r\ncorrected.
