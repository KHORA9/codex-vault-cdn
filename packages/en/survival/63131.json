A treatment that is a success in one location\r\nmay be a failure in another. In every instance decision should be based\r\nupon field data and full knowledge of the local needs and conditions.\r\nAn installation planned from assumed conditions may work harm. The\r\nhouseholder may be misled as to the purification and rely on a protection\r\nthat is not real. He may anticipate little or no odor and find a nuisance\r\nhas been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEWAGE, SEWERS, AND SEWERAGE DEFINED\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman excrements (feces and urine) as found in closets and privy vaults\r\nare known as night soil. These wastes may be flushed away with running\r\nwater, and there may be added the discharges from washbasins, bathtubs,\r\nkitchen and slop sinks, laundry trays, washing vats, and floor drains.\r\nThis refuse liquid product is sewage, and the underground pipe which\r\nconveys it is a sewer. Since sewers carry foul matter they should be\r\nwater-tight, and this feature of their construction distinguishes them\r\nfrom drains removing relatively pure surface or ground water. Sewerage\r\nrefers to a system of sewers, including the pipes, tanks, disposal works,\r\nand appurtenances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE AND QUANTITY OF SEWAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder average conditions a man discharges daily about 3½ ounces of moist\r\nfeces and 40 ounces of urine, the total in a year approximating 992\r\npounds.[1] Feces consist largely of water and undigested or partially\r\ndigested food; by weight it is 77.2 per cent water.[2] Urine is about 96,3\r\nper cent water.[2]\r\n\r\n[1] Practical Physiological Chemistry, by Philip B. Hawk, 1916, pp. 221,\r\n359.\r\n\r\n[2] Agriculture, by P. H. Storer, 1894, vol. 2, p. 70.\r\n\r\nThe excrements constitute but a small part of ordinary sewage. In\r\naddition to the excrements and the daily water consumption of perhaps\r\n40 gallons per person are many substances entering into the economy of\r\nthe household, such as grease, fats, milk, bits of food, meat, fruit and\r\nvegetables, tea and coffee grounds, paper, etc. This complex product\r\ncontains mineral, vegetable, and animal substances, both dissolved and\r\nundissolved. It contains dead organic matter and living organisms in the\r\nform of exceedingly minute vegetative cells (bacteria) and animal cells\r\n(protozoa). These low forms of life are the active agents in destroying\r\ndead organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria are numbered in billions and include many species, some\r\nuseful and others harmful. They may be termed tiny scavengers, which under\r\nfavorable conditions multiply with great rapidity, their useful work\r\nbeing the oxidizing and nitrifying of dissolved organic matter and the\r\nbreaking down of complex organic solids to liquids and gases. Among the\r\nmyriads of bacteria are many of a virulent nature. These at any time may\r\ninclude species which are the cause of well-known infectious and parasitic\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEWAGE-BORNE DISEASES AND THEIR AVOIDANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAny spittoon, slop pail, sink drain, urinal, privy, cesspool, sewage\r\ntank, or sewage distribution field is a potential danger. A bit of spit,\r\nurine, or feces the size of a pin head may contain many hundred germs,\r\nall invisible to the naked eye and each one capable of producing disease.\r\nThese discharges should be kept away from the food and drink of man\r\nand animals. From specific germs that may be carried in sewage at any\r\ntime there may result typhoid fever, tuberculosis, cholera, dysentery,\r\ndiarrhea, and other dangerous ailments, and it is probable that other\r\nmaladies may be traced to human waste. From certain animal parasites or\r\ntheir eggs that may be carried in sewage there may result intestinal\r\nworms, of which the more common are the hookworm, roundworm, whipworm,\r\neelworm, tapeworm, and seat worm.\r\n\r\nSewage, drainage, or other impure water may contain also the causative\r\nagents of numerous ailments common to livestock, such as tuberculosis,\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease, hog cholera, anthrax, glanders, and stomach and\r\nintestinal worms.\r\n\r\nDisease germs are carried by many agencies and unsuspectingly received by\r\ndevious routes into the human body. Infection may come from the swirling\r\ndust of the railway roadbed, from contact with transitory or chronic\r\ncarriers of disease, from green truck grown in gardens fertilized with\r\nnight soil or sewage, from food prepared or touched by unclean hands\r\nor visited by flies or vermin, from milk handled by sick or careless\r\ndairymen, from milk cans and utensils washed with contaminated water, or\r\nfrom cisterns, wells, springs, reservoirs, irrigation ditches, brooks,\r\nor lakes receiving the surface wash or the underground drainage from\r\nsewage-polluted soil.\r\n\r\nMany recorded examples show with certainty how typhoid fever and other\r\ndiseases have been transmitted. A few indicating the responsibilities and\r\nduties of people who live in the country are cited here.\r\n\r\n In August, 1889, a sister and two brothers aged 18, 21, and 23 years,\r\n respectively, and all apparently in robust health dwelt together in a\r\n rural village in Columbiana County, Ohio. Typhoid fever in particular\r\n virulent form developed after use of drinking water from a badly polluted\r\n surface source. The deaths of all three occurred within a space of 10\r\n days.\r\n\r\n In September and October, 1899, 63 cases of typhoid fever, resulting\r\n in 5 deaths, occurred at the Northampton (Mass.) insane hospital. This\r\n epidemic was conclusively traced to celery, which was eaten freely in\r\n August and was grown and banked in a plot that had been fertilized in the\r\n late winter or early spring with the solid residue and scrapings from a\r\n sewage filter bed situated on the hospital grounds.\r\n\r\n Some years ago Dr. W. W. Skinner, Bureau of Chemistry, Department of\r\n Agriculture, investigated the cause of an outbreak of typhoid fever in\r\n southwest Virginia. A small stream meandered through a narrow valley\r\n in which five 10-inch wells about 450 feet deep had been drilled in\r\n limestone formation. The wells were from 50 to 400 feet from the stream,\r\n from which, it was suspected, pollution was reaching the wells. In a pool\r\n in the stream bed approximately one-fourth mile above the wells several\r\n hundred pounds of common salt were dissolved. Four of the wells were cut\r\n off from the pump and the fifth was subjected to heavy pumping. The water\r\n discharged by the pump was examined at 15-minute intervals and its salt\r\n content determined over a considerable period of time. After the lapse of\r\n several 15-minute intervals the salt began to rise and continued to rise\r\n until the maximum was approximately seven times that at the beginning of\r\n the test, thus proving the facility with which pollution may pass a long\r\n distance underground and reach deep wells.\r\n\r\n Probably no epidemic in American history better illustrates the dire\r\n results that may follow one thoughtless act than the outbreak of typhoid\r\n fever at Plymouth, Pa., in 1885. In January and February of that year the\r\n night discharges of one typhoid fever patient were thrown out upon the\r\n snow near his home. These, carried by spring thaws into the public water\r\n supply, caused an epidemic running from April to September. In a total\r\n population of about 8,000, 1,104 persons were attacked by the disease and\r\n 114 died.\r\n\r\nLike plants and animals, disease germs vary in their powers of resistance.\r\nSome are hardy, others succumb easily. Outside the body most of them\r\nprobably die in a few days or weeks. It is never certain when such germs\r\nmay not lodge where the immediate surroundings are favorable to their life\r\nand reproduction. Milk is one of the common substances in which germs\r\nmultiply rapidly. The experience at Northampton shows that typhoid-fever\r\ngerms may survive several months in garden soil. Laboratory tests by the\r\nUnited States Public Health Service showed that typhoid-fever germs had\r\nnot all succumbed after being frozen in cream 74 days. (Public Health\r\nReports, Feb. 8, 1918, pp. 163-166.) Ravenel kept the spores of anthrax\r\nimmersed for 244 days in the strongest tanning fluids without perceptible\r\nchange in their vitality or virulence. (Annual Report, State Department of\r\nHealth, Mass., 1916, p. 494.)\r\n\r\n=Unsafe practices.=--Upon thousands of small farms there are no privies\r\nand excretions are deposited carelessly about the premises. A place of\r\nthis character is shown in figure 1. Upon thousands of other farms the\r\nprivy is so filthy and neglected that hired men and visitors seek near-by\r\nsheds, fields, and woods. A privy of this character is shown in figure 2.\r\nThese practices and conditions exist in every section of the country. They\r\nshould be abolished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--One of many farms lacking the simplest sanitary\r\nconvenience]\r\n\r\nDeserving of severe censure is the old custom of conveying excrements or\r\nsewage into abandoned wells or some convenient stream. Such a practice is\r\nindecent and unsafe. It is unnecessary and is contrary to the laws of most\r\nof the States.\r\n\r\nLikewise dangerous and even more disgusting is the old custom of using\r\nhuman excrement or sewage for the fertilization of truck land. Under\r\nno circumstances should such wastes be used on land devoted to celery,\r\nlettuce, radishes, cucumbers, cabbages, tomatoes, melons, or other\r\nvegetables, berries, or low-growing fruits that are eaten raw. Disease\r\ngerms or particles of soil containing such germs may adhere to the skins\r\nof vegetables or fruits and infect the eater.\r\n\r\nUpon farms it is necessary to dispose of excretal wastes at no great\r\ndistance from the dwelling. The ability and likelihood of flies carrying\r\ndisease germs direct to the dinner table, kitchen, or pantry are well\r\nknown. Vermin, household pets, poultry, and live stock may spread such\r\ngerms. For these reasons, and also on the score of odor, farm sewage never\r\nshould be exposed.\r\n\r\n=Important safety measure.=--The farmer can do no other one thing so vital\r\nto his own and the public health as to make sure of the continued purity\r\nof the farm water supply. Investigations indicate that about three out of\r\nfour shallow wells are polluted badly.\r\n\r\nWells and springs are fed by ground water, which is merely natural\r\ndrainage. Drainage water usually moves with the slope of the land. It\r\nalways dissolves part of the mineral, vegetable, and animal matter of the\r\nground over or through which it moves. In this way impurities are carried\r\ninto the ground water and may reach distant wells or springs.\r\n\r\nThe great safeguards are clean ground and wide separation of the well\r\nfrom probable channels of impure drainage water. It is not enough that\r\na well or spring is 50 or 150 feet from a source of filth or that it is\r\non higher ground. Given porous ground, a seamy ledge, or long-continued\r\npollution of one plat of land, the zone of contamination is likely to\r\nextend long distances, particularly in downhill directions or when the\r\nwater is low through drought or heavy pumping. Only when the surface of\r\nthe water in a well or spring is at a higher level at all times than any\r\nnear-by source of filth is there assurance of safety from impure seepage.\r\nSome of the foregoing facts are shown diagrammatically in Figure 3. Figure\r\n4 is typical of those insanitary, poorly drained barnyards that are almost\r\ncertain to work injury to wells situated in or near them. Accumulations\r\nof filth result in objectionable odor and noxious drainage. Figure 5\r\nillustrates poor relative location of privy, cesspool, and well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--The rickety, uncomfortable, unspeakably foul,\r\ndangerous ground privy. Neglected by the owner, shunned by the hired man,\r\navoided by the guest, who, in preference, goes to near-by fields or woods,\r\npolluter of wells, meeting place of house flies and disease germs, privies\r\nof this character abide only because of man's indifference]\r\n\r\nSewage or impure drainage water should never be discharged into or upon\r\nground draining toward a well, spring, or other source of water supply.\r\nNeither should such wastes be discharged into openings in rock, an\r\nabandoned well, nor a hole, cesspool, vault, or tank so located that\r\npollution can escape into water-bearing earth or rock. Whatever the system\r\nof sewage disposal, it should be entirely and widely separated from the\r\nwater supply. Further information on locating and constructing wells is\r\ngiven in Farmers' Bulletin 1448-F, Farmstead Water Supply, copies of which\r\nmay be had upon request to the Division of Publications, Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to bring home to the reader these vital points:\r\n\r\n1. Never allow the farm sewage or excrements, even in minutest quantity,\r\nto reach the food or water of man or livestock.\r\n\r\n2. Never expose such wastes so that they can be visited by flies or other\r\ncarriers of disease germs.\r\n\r\n3. Never use such wastes to fertilize or irrigate vegetable gardens.\r\n\r\n4. Never discharge or throw such wastes into a stream, pond, or abandoned\r\nwell, nor into a gutter, ditch, or tile drainage system, which naturally\r\nmust have outlet in some watercourse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--How an apparently good well may draw foul\r\ndrainage. Arrows show direction of ground water movement. _A-A_, Usual\r\nwater table (surface of free water in the ground); _B-B_, water table\r\nlowered by drought and pumping from well _D_; _C-C_, water table further\r\nlowered by drought and heavy pumping; _E-F_, level line from surface of\r\nsewage in cesspool. Well _D_ is safe until the water table is lowered to\r\n_E_; further lowering draws drainage from the cesspool and, with the water\r\ntable at _C-C_, from the barn. The location of well _G_ renders it unsafe\r\nalways]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--An insanitary, poorly drained barnyard. (Board of\r\nHealth, Milwaukee.) Liquid manure or other foul drainage is sure to leach\r\ninto wells situated in or near barnyards of this character]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SEWAGE DECOMPOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a bottle of fresh sewage is kept in a warm room changes occur in the\r\nappearance and nature of the liquid. At first it is light in appearance\r\nand its odor is slight. It is well supplied with oxygen, since this gas\r\nis always found in waters exposed to the atmosphere. In a few hours the\r\nsolids in the sewage separate mechanically according to their relative\r\nweights; sediment collects at the bottom, and a greasy film covers the\r\nsurface. In a day's time there is an enormous development of bacteria,\r\nwhich obtain their food supply from the dissolved carbonaceous and\r\nnitrogenous matter. As long as free oxygen is present this action is\r\nspoken of as aërobic decomposition. There is a gradual increase in the\r\namount of ammonia and a decrease of free oxygen. When the ammonia is near\r\nthe maximum and the free oxygen is exhausted the sewage is said to be\r\nstale. Following exhaustion of the oxygen supply, bacterial life continues\r\nprofuse, but it gradually diminishes as a result of reduction of its food\r\nsupply and the poisonous effects of its own wastes. In the absence of\r\noxygen the bacterial action is spoken of as anaërobic decomposition. The\r\nsewage turns darker and becomes more offensive. Suspended and settled\r\norganic substances break apart or liquefy later, and various foul-smelling\r\ngases are liberated. Sewage in this condition is known as septic and the\r\nputrefaction that has taken place is called septicization. Most of the\r\nodor eventually disappears, and a dark, insoluble, mosslike substance\r\nremains as a deposit. Complete reduction of this deposit may require many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Poor relative locations of privy, cesspool, and\r\nwell. (State Department of Health, Massachusetts.) Never allow privy,\r\ncesspool, or sink drainage to escape into the plot of ground from which\r\nthe water supply comes]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF AIR IN TREATMENT OF SEWAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nDecomposition of organic matter by bacterial agency is not a complete\r\nmethod of treating sewage, as will be shown later under \"Septic tanks.\" It\r\nis sufficient to observe here that in all practical methods of treatment\r\naeration plays a vital part. The air or the sewage, or both, must be in a\r\nfinely divided state, as when sewage percolates through the interstices\r\nof a porous, air-filled soil. The principle involved was clearly stated\r\n30 years ago by Hiram F. Mills, a member of the Massachusetts State Board\r\nof Health. In discussing the intermittent filtration of sewage through\r\ngravel stones too coarse to arrest even the coarsest particles in the\r\nsewage Mr. Mills said: \"The slow movement of the sewage in thin films over\r\nthe surface of the stones, with air in contact, caused a removal for some\r\nmonths of 97 per cent of the organic nitrogenous matter, as well as 99 per\r\ncent of the bacteria.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL UTILITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious discussion has dealt largely with basic principles of sanitation.\r\nThe construction and operation of simple utilities embodying some of\r\nthese principles are discussed in the following order: (1) Privies for\r\nexcrements only; (2) works for handling wastes where a supply of water is\r\navailable for flushing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIT PRIVY\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows a portable pit privy suitable for places of the character\r\nof that shown in figure 1, where land is abundant and cheap, and in such\r\nlocalities has proved practical. It provides, at minimum cost and with\r\nleast attention, a fixed place for depositing excretions where the filth\r\ncan not be tracked by man, spread by animals, reached by flies, nor washed\r\nby rain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Portable pit privy. For use where land is abundant\r\nand cheap, but unless handled with judgment can not be regarded as safe.\r\nThe privy is mounted on runners for convenience in moving to new locations]\r\n\r\nThe privy is light and inexpensive and is placed over a pit in the ground.\r\nWhen the pit becomes one-half or two-thirds full the privy is drawn or\r\ncarried to a new location. The pit should be shallow, preferably not\r\nover 2½ feet in depth, and never should be located in wet ground or rock\r\nformation or where the surface or the strata slope toward a well, spring,\r\nor other source of domestic water supply. Besides standing on lower ground\r\nthe pit should never be within 200 feet of a well or spring. Since dryness\r\nin the pit is essential, the ground should be raised slightly and 10 or\r\n12 inches of earth should be banked and compacted against all sides to\r\nshed rain water. The banking also serves to exclude flies. If the soil\r\nis sandy or gravelly, the pit should be lined with boards or pales to\r\nprevent caving. The standard galvanized or black enameled wire cloth\r\nhaving 14 squares to the inch. The whole seat should be easily removable\r\nfor cleaning. A little loose absorbent soil should be added daily to the\r\naccumulation in the pit, and when a pit is abandoned it should be filled\r\nimmediately with dry earth mounded to shed water.\r\n\r\nA pit privy for use in field work, consisting of a framework of ½-inch\r\niron pipe for corner posts connected at the top with ¼-inch iron rods bent\r\nat the ends to right angles and hung with curtains of unbleached muslin,\r\nis described in Public Health Report of the United States Public Health\r\nService, July 26, 1918.\r\n\r\nA pit privy, even if moved often, can not be regarded as safe. The danger\r\nis that accumulations of waste may overtax the purifying capacity of the\r\nsoil and the teachings reach wells or springs. Sloping ground is not a\r\nguaranty of safety; the great safeguard lies in locating the privy a long\r\ndistance from the water supply and as far below it as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITARY PRIVY\r\n\r\nThe next step in evolution is the sanitary privy. Its construction must\r\nbe such that it is practically impossible for filth or germs to be spread\r\nabove ground, to escape by percolation underground, or to be accessible to\r\nflies, vermin, chickens, or animals. Furthermore, it must be cared for in\r\na cleanly manner, else it ceases to be sanitary. To secure these desirable\r\nends sanitarians have devised numerous types of tight-receptacle privy.\r\nConsidering the small cost and the proved value of some of these types, it\r\nis to be regretted that few are seen on American farms.\r\n\r\nThe container for a sanitary privy may be small--for example, a\r\ngalvanized-iron pail or garbage can, to be removed from time to time by\r\nhand; it may be large, as a barrel or a metal tank mounted for moving;\r\nor it may be a stationary underground metal tank or masonry vault. The\r\nessential requirement in the receptacle is permanent water-tightness to\r\nprevent pollution of soils and wells. Wooden pails or boxes, which warp\r\nand leak, should not be used. Where a vault is used it should be shallow\r\nto facilitate emptying and cleaning. Moreover, if the receptacle should\r\nleak it is better that the escape of liquid should be in the top soil,\r\nwhere air and bacterial life are most abundant.\r\n\r\nSanitary privies are classified according to the method used in treating\r\nthe excretions, as dry earth, chemical, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRY-EARTH PRIVY\r\n\r\n=Pail type.=--A very serviceable pail privy is shown in Figures 7 and 8.\r\nThe method of ventilation is an adaptation of a system that has proved\r\nvery effective in barns and other buildings here and abroad. A flue with\r\na clear opening of 16 square inches rises from the rear of the seat and\r\nterminates above the ridgepole in a cowl or small roofed housing. Attached\r\nto this flue is a short auxiliary duct, 4 by 15 inches, for removing foul\r\nair from the top of the privy. In its upper portion on the long sides the\r\ncowl is open, allowing free movement of air across the top of the flue.\r\nIn addition, the long sides of the cowl are open below next to the roof.\r\nThese two openings, with the connecting vertical air passages, permit free\r\nupward movement of air through the cowl, as indicated by the arrows. The\r\ncombined effect is to create draft from beneath the seat and from the top\r\nof the privy. The ventilating flue is 2 by 8 inches at the seat and 4 by 4\r\ninches 5 feet above. The taper slightly increases the labor of making the\r\nflue, but permits a 2-inch reduction in the length of the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Pail privy. Well constructed, ventilated, and\r\nscreened. With proper care is sanitary and unobjectionable]\r\n\r\nIn plan the privy is 4 by 4½ feet. The sills are secured to durable posts\r\nset about 4 feet in the ground. The boarding is tight, and all vents and\r\nwindows are screened to exclude insects. The screens may be the same as\r\nfor pit privies or, if a more lasting material is desired, bronze or\r\ncopper screening of 14 squares to the inch may be used. The entire seat\r\nis hinged, thus permitting removal of the receptacle and facilitating\r\ncleaning and washing the underside of the seat and the destruction of\r\nspiders and other insects which thrive in dark, unclean places. The\r\nreceptacle is a heavy galvanized-iron garbage can. Heavy brown-paper bags\r\nfor lining the can may be had at slight cost, and their use helps to keep\r\nthe can clean and facilitates emptying. Painting with black asphaltum\r\nserves a similar purpose and protects the can from rust. If the contents\r\nare frozen, a little heat releases them. Of nonfreezing mixtures a strong\r\nbrine made with common salt or calcium chloride is effective. Two and\r\none-half to 3 pounds of either thoroughly dissolved in a gallon of water\r\nlowers the freezing point of the mixture to about zero. Denatured alcohol\r\nor wood alcohol in a 25 per cent solution has a like low freezing point\r\nand the additional merit of being noncorrosive of metals. The can should\r\nbe emptied frequently and the contents completely buried in a thin layer\r\nby a plow or in a shallow hand-dug trench at a point below and remote from\r\nwells and springs. Wherever intestinal disease exists the contents of\r\nthe can should be destroyed by burning or made sterile before burial by\r\nboiling or by incorporation with a strong chemical disinfectant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Pail privy]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--A well-ventilated privy in Montana]\r\n\r\nA privy ventilated in the manner before described is shown in Figure 9.\r\nThe cowl, however, is open on four sides instead of two sides as shown\r\nin Figures 7 and 8. The working drawings (figs. 7 and 8) show that the\r\nconstruction of a privy of the kind is not difficult. Figure 10 gives\r\nthree suggestions whereby a privy may be conveniently located and the\r\napproach screened or partially hidden by latticework, vines, or shrubbery.\r\n\r\n=Vault type.=--A primitive and yet serviceable three-seat dry-earth privy\r\nof the vault type is shown in Figure 11. This privy was constructed in\r\n1817 upon a farm at Westboro, Mass. The vault, made of bricks, was 6 feet\r\nlong by 5 feet wide, and the bottom was 1 foot below the surface of the\r\nground. The brickwork was laid in mortar, and the part below the ground\r\nsurface was plastered on the inside. The outside of the vault was exposed\r\nto light and air on all four sides. Across the long side of the vault\r\nin the rear was a door swinging upward through which the night soil was\r\nremoved two or three times a year, usually in the spring, summer, and fall\r\nand hauled to a near-by field, where it was deposited in a furrow, just\r\nahead of the plow.\r\n\r\nEspecial attention is called to the shallowness of the vault and the\r\nlightened labor of cleaning it out. The swinging door at the rear\r\nfacilitated the sprinkling of dry soil or ashes over the contents of the\r\nvault, thus avoiding the necessity of carrying dirt and dust into the\r\nbuilding and dust settling upon the seat. This privy was in use for nearly\r\n100 years without renewal or repairs. When last seen the original seat,\r\nwhich always was kept painted, showed no signs of decay. Modern methods\r\nwould call for a concrete vault of guaranteed water-tightness,[3] proper\r\nventilation and screening, and hinging the seat.\r\n\r\n[3] Directions for mixing and placing concrete to secure water-tightness\r\nare contained in Farmers' Bulletin 1279-F, \"Plain concrete for farm use,\"\r\nand Farmers' Bulletin 1572-F, \"Making Cellars Dry.\"\r\n\r\nWorking drawings for a very convenient well-built two-seat vault privy\r\nare reproduced in Figures 12 and 13. The essential features are shown in\r\nsufficient detail to require little explanation. With concrete mixtures of\r\n1:2:3 (1 volume cement, 2 volumes sand, 3 volumes stone) for the vault and\r\n1:2:4 for the posts there will be required a total of about 2 cubic yards\r\nof concrete, taking 3½ barrels of cement, 1 cubic yard of sand, and 1½\r\ncubic yards of broken stone or screened gravel. The stone or gravel should\r\nnot exceed 1 inch in diameter, except that a few cobblestones may be\r\nembedded where the vault wall is thickest, thus effecting a slight saving\r\nof materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Screening the approach to a privy. _A_, Raised\r\nplatform with lattice sides, suitable for short distances, convenient,\r\nand easily cleared of snow; _B_, walk hidden by latticework; _C_, walk\r\ninclosed by an arbor]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL CLOSET\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--A primitive vault privy in Massachusetts. Note\r\nthe tight, shallow, easily cleaned vault. _A_, Brick vault 5 by 6 feet,\r\nbottom about 1 foot in the ground; _B_, water-tight plastering; _C_,\r\nrowlock course of brick; _D_, door hinged at top; _E_, door button; _F_,\r\nthree-pane window hinged at top; _G_, passageway]\r\n\r\nA type of sanitary privy in which the excrements are received directly\r\ninto a water-tight receptacle containing chemical disinfectant is meeting\r\nwith considerable favor for camps, parks, rural cottages, schools, hotels,\r\nand railway stations. These chemical closets,[4] as they are called, are\r\nmade in different forms and are known by various trade names. In the\r\nsimplest form a sheet-metal receptacle is concealed in a small metal or\r\nwooden cabinet, and the closet is operated usually in much the same manner\r\nas the ordinary pail privy. These closets are very simple and compact,\r\nof good appearance, and easy to install or move from place to place. In\r\nanother type, known as the chemical tank closet, the receptacle is a\r\nsteel tank fixed in position underground or in a basement. The tank has a\r\ncapacity of about 125 gallons per seat, is provided with a hand-operated\r\nagitator to secure thorough mixing of the chemical and the excretions, and\r\nthe contents are bailed, pumped, or drained out from time to time.\r\n\r\n[4] Among publications on chemical closets are the following: \"Chemical\r\nclosets,\" Reprint No. 404 from the Public Health Reports, U. S. Public\r\nHealth Service, June 29, 1917, pp. 1017-1020: \"The chemical closet,\"\r\nEngineering Bulletin No. 5, Mich. State Board of Health, October, 1916;\r\nHealth Bulletin, Va. Department of Health, March, 1917, PP. 214-219.\r\n\r\nChemical closets, like every form of privy, should be well installed,\r\ncleanly operated, and frequently emptied, and the wastes should receive\r\nsafe burial. With the exception of frequency of emptying, the same can\r\nbe said of chemical tank closets. With both forms of closet thorough\r\nventilation or draft is essential, and this is obtained usually by\r\nconnecting the closet vent pipe to a chimney flue or extending it well\r\nabove the ridgepole of the building. The contents of the container should\r\nalways be submerged and very low temperatures guarded against.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Two-seat vault privy]\r\n\r\nAs to the germicidal results obtained in chemical closets, few data are\r\navailable. A disinfecting compound may not sterilize more than a thin\r\nsurface layer of the solid matter deposited. Experiments by Dr. Alvah\r\nH. Doty with various agents recommended and widely used for the bedside\r\nsterilization of feces showed \"that at the end of 20 hours of exposure\r\nto the disinfectant but one-eighth of an inch of the fecal mass was\r\ndisinfected.\"[5] Plainly, then, to destroy all bacterial and parasitic\r\nlife in chemical closets three things are necessary: (1) A very powerful\r\nagent; (2) permeation of the fecal mass by the agent; (3) retention of\r\nits strength and potency until permeation is complete. The compounds or\r\nmixtures commonly used in chemical closets are of two general kinds:\r\nFirst, those in which some coal-tar product or other oily disinfectant is\r\nused to destroy germs and deodorize, leaving the solids little changed in\r\nform; second, those of the caustic class that dissolve the solids, which,\r\nif of sufficient strength and permeating every portion, should destroy\r\nmost if not all bacterial life. Not infrequently the chemical solution\r\nis intended to accomplish disinfection, deodorization, and reduction to\r\na liquid or semiliquid state. Ordinary caustic soda, costing about $1 in\r\n10-pound pails, has given good results.\r\n\r\n[5] Annual Report, Mass. State Board of Health, 1914, p. 727.\r\n\r\nA simple type of chemical closet is shown in Figure 14, and the essential\r\nfeatures are indicated in the notation. These closets with vent pipe and\r\nappurtenances, ready for setting up, retail for $20 and upward. A chemical\r\ntank closet, retailing for about $80 per seat, is shown in Figure 15.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture occasionally receives complaints from people\r\nwho have installed chemical closets, usually on the score of odors or the\r\ncost of chemicals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Two-seat-vault privy. Note the shallow,\r\nwater-tight, easily cleaned concrete vault]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISINFECTANTS AND DEODORANTS\r\n\r\nDisinfection is the destruction of disease germs. Sterilization is\r\nthe destruction of all germs or bacteria, both the harmful and the\r\nuseful. Antisepsis is the checking or restraining of bacterial growth.\r\nDeodorization is the destruction of odor. Unfortunately in practice none\r\nof these processes may be complete. The agent may be of inferior quality,\r\nmay have lost its potency, or may not reach all parts of the mass treated.\r\nA disinfectant or germicide is an agent capable of destroying disease\r\ngerms; an antiseptic is an agent merely capable of arresting bacterial\r\ngrowth, and it may be a dilute disinfectant; a deodorant is an agent that\r\ntends to destroy odor, but whose action may consist in absorbing odor or\r\nin masking the original odor with another more agreeable one.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] Those desiring more explicit information on disinfectants and the\r\nprinciples of disinfection are referred to U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nFarmers' Bulletin 926, \"Some Common Disinfectants,\" and 954, \"The\r\nDisinfection of Stables.\" and to publications of the U. S. Public Health\r\nService.\r\n\r\nOf active disinfecting agents, heat from fire, live steam, and boiling\r\nwater are the surest. The heat generated by the slaking of quicklime has\r\nproved effective with small quantities of excreta. Results of tests by the\r\nMassachusetts State Board of Health[7] show that the preferable method\r\nconsists in adding sufficient hot water (120° to 140° F.) to cover the\r\nexcrement in the receptacle, then adding small pieces of fresh strong\r\nquicklime in amount equal to about one-third of the bulk of water and\r\nexcrement combined, covering the receptacle, and allowing it to stand 1½\r\nhours or longer.\r\n\r\n[7] Annual Report, Mass. State Board of Health, 1914, pp. 727-729.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Chemical closet. _A_, Water-tight sheet-metal\r\ncontainer; _B_, metal or wooden cabinet; _C_, wooden or composition seat\r\nring; _D_, hinged cover; _E_, 3 or 4 inch ventilating flue extending 18\r\ninches above roof or to a chimney; _F_, air inlets]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Chemical tank closet. _A_, Tank, 2 feet 3 inches\r\nby 4 feet 2 inches 5/64th-inch iron, seams welded; capacity, 125 gallons;\r\n_B_, 14-inch covered opening for recharging and emptying tank; _C_,\r\n12-inch galvanized sheet-metal tube; _D_, 4-inch sheet-metal ventilating\r\npipe extending above ridgepole or to a chimney; _E_, agitator or paddle]\r\n\r\nAmong chemical disinfectants a strong solution of sodium hydroxide\r\n(caustic soda) or potassium hydroxide (caustic potash, lye) is very\r\neffective and is useful in dissolving grease and other organic substances.\r\nBoth chemicals are costly, but caustic soda is less expensive than\r\ncaustic potash and constitutes most of the ordinary commercial lyes.\r\nChlorinated lime (chloride of lime, bleaching powder) either in solution\r\nor in powdered form is valuable. For the disinfection of stools of\r\ntyphoid-fever patients the Virginia State Board of Health[8] recommends\r\nthoroughly dissolving ½ pound of best chlorinated lime in 1 gallon of\r\nwater and allowing the solution to cover the feces for at least 1 hour.\r\nThe solution should be kept in well-stoppered bottles and used promptly,\r\ncertainly within 2 or 3 days. Copper sulphate (blue vitriol, bluestone)\r\nin a 5 per cent solution (1 pound in 2½ gallons of water) is a good but\r\nrather costly disinfectant. None of the formulas here given is to be\r\nconstrued as fixed and precise. Conditions may vary the proportions, as\r\nthey always will vary the results. The reader should remember that few,\r\nif any, chemical disinfectants can be expected fully to disinfect or\r\nsterilize large masses of excrement unless the agent is used repeatedly\r\nand in liberal quantities or mechanical means are employed to secure\r\nthorough incorporation.\r\n\r\n[8] Health Bulletin, Va. State Board of Health, June, 1917, pp. 277-280.\r\n\r\nAmong deodorants some of the drying powders mentioned below possess\r\nmore or less disinfecting power. Chlorinated lime, though giving off an\r\nunpleasant odor of chlorine, is employed extensively. Lime in the form\r\nof either quicklime or milk of lime (whitewash) is much used and is an\r\nactive disinfectant. To prepare milk of lime a small quantity of water is\r\nslowly added to good fresh quicklime in lumps. As soon as the quicklime\r\nis slaked a quantity of water, about four times the quantity of lime, is\r\nadded and stirred thoroughly. When used as a whitewash the milk of lime is\r\nthinned as desired with water and kept well stirred. Liberal use of milk\r\nof lime in a vault or cesspool, though it may not disinfect the contents,\r\nis of use in checking bacterial growth and abating odor. To give the best\r\nresults it should be used frequently, beginning when the vault or cesspool\r\nis empty. Iron sulphate (green vitriol, copperas) because of its affinity\r\nfor ammonia and sulphides is used as a temporary deodorizer in vaults,\r\ncesspools, and drains; 1 pound dissolved in 4 gallons of water makes a\r\nsolution of suitable strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF PRIVY NUISANCE\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of simple measures for preventing a privy from\r\nbecoming a nuisance:\r\n\r\n1. Locate the privy inconspicuously and detached from the dwelling.\r\n\r\n2. Make the receptacle or vault small, shallow, easy of access, and\r\nwater-tight.\r\n\r\n3. Clean out the vault often. Do not wait until excrement has accumulated\r\nand decomposition is sufficiently advanced to cause strong and foul odors.\r\n\r\n4. Sprinkle into the vault daily loose dry soil, ashes, lime, sawdust,\r\nground gypsum (land plaster), or powdered peat or charcoal. These will\r\nabsorb liquid and odor, though they may not destroy disease germs.\r\n\r\n5. Make the privy house rain-proof; ventilate it thoroughly, and screen\r\nall openings.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION TO PRIVIES\r\n\r\nAll the methods of waste disposal heretofore described are open to the\r\nfollowing objections:\r\n\r\n1. They do not take care of kitchen slops and liquid wastes incident to a\r\npressure water system.\r\n\r\n2. They retain filth for a considerable period of time, with probability\r\nof odors and liability of transmission of disease germs.\r\n\r\n3. They require more personal attention and care than people generally are\r\nwilling to give.\r\n\r\nBy far the most satisfactory method yet devised of caring for sewage\r\ncalls for a supply of water and the flushing away of all wastes as soon\r\nas created through a water-tight sewer to a place where they undergo\r\ntreatment and final disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITCHEN-SINK DRAINAGE\r\n\r\nA necessity in every dwelling is effective disposal of the kitchen-sink\r\nslops. This necessity ordinarily arises long before the farm home is\r\nsupplied with water under pressure and the conveniences that go with it.\r\nHence the first call for information on sewage disposal is likely to\r\nrelate merely to sink drainage. This waste water, though it may not be\r\nas dangerous to health as sewage containing human excrements, is still a\r\nmenace to the farm well and capable of creating disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--How to waste kitchen-sink drainage. _A_, Sink;\r\n_B_, waste pipe; _C_, trap; _D_, clean-out; _E_, box filled with hay,\r\nstraw, sawdust, excelsior, coke, or other insulating material; _F_, 4-inch\r\nvitrified sewer-pipe, hubs uphill, and joints made water tight for at\r\nleast 100 feet downhill from a well; _G_, 4-inch vitrified sewer pipe,\r\nhubs downhill, joints slightly open, laid in an 18-inch bed of coarse\r\nsand, gravel, stone, broken brick, slag, cinders, or coke; _H_, strip\r\nof tarred paper on burlap or a thin layer of hay, straw, cornstalks,\r\nbrush, or sods, grass side down; _I_, 12 inches of natural soil; _J_,\r\nstone-filled pit. As here illustrated, water is drawn by a pitcher or\r\nkitchen pump (_K_) through a 1¼ or 1½ inch galvanized-iron suction pipe\r\n(_L_) from a cistern (_M_). The suction pipe should be laid below frost\r\nand on a smooth upward grade from cistern to pump and be provided with a\r\nfoot valve (_N_) to keep the pump primed. If a foot valve is used, pump\r\nand pipe must be safe from frost or other means than tripping the pump be\r\nprovided for draining the system]\r\n\r\nThe usual method of disposing of sink slops is to allow them to dribble\r\non or beneath the surface of the ground close to the house. Such drainage\r\nshould be taken in a water-tight carrier at least 100 feet downhill from\r\nthe well and discharged below the surface of the ground. Every sink should\r\nbe provided with a suitable screen to keep all large particles out of the\r\nwaste pipe. An approved form of sink strainer consists of a brass plate\r\nbolted in position over the outlet and having at least 37 perforations not\r\nlarger than one-fourth inch in diameter. Provided a sink is thus equipped\r\nand is given proper care and the land has fair slope and drainage,\r\nthe waste water may be conducted away through a water-tight sewer and\r\ndistributed in the soil by means of a short blind drain. A simple\r\ninstallation, consisting of a kitchen-sink and pump and means of disposal\r\nas described, is shown in Figure 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nCESSPOOLS\r\n\r\nWhere farms have water under pressure an open or leaching cesspool is a\r\ncommon method of disposing of the sewage. Ordinary cesspools are circular\r\nexcavations in the ground, lined with stone or brick laid without mortar.\r\nThey vary from 5 to 10 feet in diameter and from 7 to 12 feet in depth.\r\nSometimes the top is arched and capped at the ground surface by a cover of\r\nwood, stone, or cast-iron. At other times the walls are carried straight\r\nup and boards or planks are laid across for a cover, and the entire\r\nstructure is hidden with a hedge or shrubbery.\r\n\r\nExcept under the most favorable conditions the construction and use of\r\na cesspool can not be condemned too strongly. They are only permissible\r\nwhere no other arrangement is possible. Leaching cesspools especially are\r\nopen to these serious objections:\r\n\r\n1. Unless located in porous soil, stagnation is likely to occur, and\r\nfailure of the liquid to seep away may result in overflow on the Surface\r\nof the ground and the creation of a nuisance and a menace.\r\n\r\n2. They retain a mass of filth in a decomposing condition deep in the\r\nground, where it is but slightly affected by the bacteria and air of\r\nthe soil. In seeping through the ground it may be strained, but there\r\ncan be no assurance that the foul liquid, with little improvement in\r\nits condition, may not pass into the ground water and pollute wells and\r\nsprings situated long distances away in the direction of underground flow.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of avoiding soil and ground-water pollution cesspools have\r\nbeen made of water-tight construction and the contents removed by bailing\r\nor pumping. Upon the farm, however, this type of construction has little\r\nto recommend it, for the reason that facilities for removing and disposing\r\nof the contents in a clean manner are lacking.\r\n\r\nIn some instances cesspools have been made water-tight, the outflow being\r\neffected by three or four elbows or =T=-branches set in the masonry near\r\nthe top, with the inner ends turned down below the water surface, the\r\nwhole surrounded to a thickness of several feet with stone or gravel\r\nintended to act as a filtering medium. Tests of the soil water adjacent to\r\ncesspools of this type show that no reliance should be placed upon them as\r\na means of purifying sewage, the fatal defects being constant saturation\r\nwith sewage and lack of air supply. To the extent that the submerged\r\noutlets keep back grease and solid matters the scheme is of service in\r\npreventing clogging of the pores of the surrounding ground.\r\n\r\nWhere the ground about a cesspool has become clogged and water-logged,\r\nrelief is often secured by laying several lines of drain tile at shallow\r\ndepth, radiating from the cesspool. The ends of the pipes within the\r\ncesspool should turn down, and it is advantageous to surround the lines\r\nof pipe with stones or coarse gravel, as shown in Figure 16 and discussed\r\nunder \"Septic tanks.\" In this way not only is the area of percolation\r\nextended, but aeration and partial purification of the sewage are effected.\r\n\r\nWhere a cesspool is located at a distance from a dwelling and there is\r\nopportunity to lead a vent pipe up the side of a shed, barn, or any stable\r\nobject it is advisable to do so for purposes of ventilation. Where the\r\nconditions are less favorable it may be best, because of the odor, to omit\r\nany direct vent pipe from the cesspool and rely for ventilation on the\r\nhouse sewer and main soil stack extending above the roof of the house.\r\n\r\nCesspools should be emptied and cleaned at least once a year and the\r\ncontents given safe burial or, with the requisite permission, wasted in\r\nsome municipal sewerage system. After cleaning, the walls and bottom may\r\nbe treated with a disinfectant or a deodorant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTIC TANKS\r\n\r\nA tight, underground septic tank with shallow distribution of the effluent\r\nin porous soil generally is the safest and least troublesome method of\r\ntreating sewage upon the farm, while at the same time more or less of the\r\nirrigating and manurial value of the sewage may be realized.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Kinnicutt used to say that a septic tank is \"simply a\r\ncesspool, regulated and controlled.\" The reactions described under the\r\ncaptions \"How sewage decomposes\" and \"Cesspools\" take place in septic\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\nIn all sewage tanks, whatever their size and shape, a portion of the solid\r\nmatter, especially if the sewage contains much grease, floats as scum on\r\nthe liquid, the heavier solids settle to form sludge, while finely divided\r\nsolids and matter in a state of emulsion are held in suspension. If the\r\nsludge is retained in the bottom of the tank and converted or partly\r\nconverted into liquids and gases, the tank is called a septic tank and the\r\nprocess is known as septicization. The process is sometimes spoken of as\r\none of digestion or rotting.\r\n\r\n=History.=--Prototypes of the septic tank were known in Europe nearly 50\r\nyears ago. Between 1876 and 1393 a number of closed tanks with submerged\r\ninlets and outlets embodying the principle of storage of sewage and\r\nliquefaction of the solids were built in the United States and Canada. It\r\nwas later seen that many of the early claims for the septic process were\r\nextravagant. In recent years septic tanks have been used mainly in small\r\ninstallations, or, where employed in large installations, the form has\r\nbeen modified to secure digestion of the sludge in a separate compartment,\r\nthus in a measure obviating disadvantages that exist where septicization\r\ntakes place in the presence of the entering fresh sewage.\r\n\r\n=Purposes.=--The purposes of a septic tank are to receive all the farm\r\nsewage, as defined on page 1, hold it in a quiet state for a time, thus\r\ncausing partial settlement of the solids, and by nature's processes of\r\ndecomposition insure, as fully as may be, the destruction of the organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n=Limitations.=--That a septic tank is a complete method of sewage\r\ntreatment is a widespread but wrong impression. A septic tank does not\r\neliminate odor and does not destroy all organic solids. On the contrary,\r\nfoul odors developed, and of all the suspended matter in the sewage about\r\none-third escapes with the effluent, about one-third remains in the tank,\r\nand about one-third only is destroyed or reduced to liquids and gases.\r\nThe effluent is foul and dangerous. It may contain even more bacteria\r\nthan the raw sewage, since the process involves intensive growths. As\r\nto the effects upon the growth and virulence of disease germs little is\r\nknown definitely. It is not believed that such germs multiply under the\r\nconditions prevailing in a septic tank. If disease germs are present, many\r\nof their number along with other bacteria may pass through with the flow\r\nor may be enmeshed in the settling solids and there survive a long time.\r\nHence the farmer should safeguard wells and springs from the seepage or\r\ndischarges from a septic tank as carefully as from those of cesspools.\r\n\r\n=Further treatment of effluents.=--The effluent of a septic tank or any\r\nother form of sewage tank is foul and dangerous. Whether or not the\r\nsolids are removed by screening, by short periods of rest, as in plain or\r\nmodified forms of settling tanks, or by longer quiescence, as in septic\r\ntanks, the effluent generally requires further treatment to reduce the\r\nnumber of harmful organisms and the liability of nuisance. This further\r\ntreatment usually consists of some mode of filtration. In the earliest\r\nexample of such treatment the sewage was used to irrigate land by either\r\nbroad flooding or furrow irrigation. By another method the sewage is\r\ndistributed underground by means of drain tile laid with open joints, as\r\nillustrated in Figures 27 and 30.\r\n\r\nArtificial sewage filters are composed of coarse sand, screened gravel,\r\nbroken stone, coke, or other material, and the sewage is applied in\r\nnumerous ways. Since, filtration is essentially an oxidizing process\r\nrequiring air, the sewage is applied intermittently in doses.[9]\r\n\r\n[9] Artificial filters of various types are well described and illustrated\r\nin Public Health Bulletin No. 101, \"Studies of Methods for the Treatment\r\nand Disposal of Sewage--The Treatment of Sewage from Single Houses and\r\nSmall Communities.\" U. S. Public Health Service, December, 1919.\r\n\r\nIf properly designed and operated, filters of sand, coke, or stone are\r\ncapable of excellent results. Under the most favorable conditions it is\r\nunwise to discharge the effluent of a sewage filter in the near vicinity\r\nof a source of water supply. Under farm conditions filters are usually\r\nneglected or the sewage is improperly applied, resulting in the clogging\r\nand befouling of sand filters and the discharge from stone filters of an\r\neffluent which is practically as dangerous and even more offensive than\r\nraw sewage. Moreover unless the filters are covered there are likely to be\r\nannoying odors, and there is always the possibility of disease germs being\r\ncarried by flies where sewage is exposed in the vicinity of dwellings.\r\nHence it seems more practical for the farmer, avoiding the expense of\r\nearth embankments or masonry sides and bottom for a filter bed, to waste\r\nthe tank effluent beneath the surface of such area of land as is most\r\nsuitable and available. This method of applying sewage to the soil or\r\nsubsoil is often spoken of as subirrigation, but subsoil distribution of\r\nsewage is different in principle and practice from subirrigation for the\r\nincrease of crop yields. Subirrigation is rarely successful unless the\r\nland is nearly level, the topsoil porous and underlaid with an impervious\r\nstratum to hold the water within reach of plant roots, and unless a\r\nrelatively large quantity of water is used and the work is skillfully\r\ndone. On the other hand, the quantity of sewage on farms being small, it\r\nmay be wasted in hilly ground, which should be as porous, deeply drained,\r\nand dry as possible.\r\n\r\n=Parts of a system.=--The four parts of a septic-tank installation with\r\nsubsurface distribution of the effluent are outlined in Figure 17: (1)\r\nThe house sewer from house to tank; (2) the sewage tank consisting of one\r\nor more chambers; (3) the sewer from tank to distribution field; (4) the\r\ndistribution field, where the sewage is distributed and wasted, sometimes\r\ncalled the absorption field. These parts will be discussed in the order\r\nnamed, although the last should have the first consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Parts of a septic-tank installation]\r\n\r\n=House sewer.=--The length will vary with the slope of the ground and\r\nposition of buildings, well, and distribution field. Fifty to 100 feet is\r\na fair length; a greater is still more sanitary. Wherever possible the\r\nhouse sewer should be laid straight in line and grade. Figure 18 shows\r\nhow this work may be done. Suppose the distance from A to E be 100 feet;\r\nthat grade boards be set 25 feet apart crosswise of the trench at A, B,\r\nC, D, and E; that the ground at A be 4 feet lower than at E; that the top\r\nof the sewer be 2½ feet below the surface of the ground at A and 4½ feet\r\nbelow the surface of the ground at E; the fall of the sewer between A\r\nand E is 2 feet (4 + 2½ - 4½ = 2). If the fall in 100 feet be 2 feet, in\r\n25 feet it is one-fourth as much, or 6 inches. Hence, grade board B is 6\r\ninches higher than grade board A, C is 6 inches higher than B, and so on\r\nto E. The top edges when all the boards are set with a carpenter's level\r\nand fastened in position should be in line. The grade thus established\r\nmay be any convenient height above the top of the proposed sewer, and the\r\nmeasuring stick used to grade the pipe is cut accordingly. This height is\r\nusually a certain number of whole feet. Fixing the line of the sewer is a\r\nmere matter of setting nails in the top edges of boards A and E directly\r\nover the center of the proposed sewer and tightly stretching a fish line\r\nor grade cord; nails should be set where the cord crosses boards B, C, and\r\nD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Setting line and grade for house sewer. To\r\nthe observer at A the top edges of the grade boards appear as one; the\r\nhalf-driven nails are set to line]\r\n\r\nIf the cellar or basement contains plumbing fixtures, the house sewer\r\nshould enter 1 to 2 feet below the cellar floor. If all plumbing fixtures\r\nare on the floors above, the sewer may enter at no greater depth than\r\nnecessary to insure protection from frost outside the cellar wall. Digging\r\nthe trench and laying the pipe should begin at the tank or lower end. The\r\nlarge end of the pipes, called the hub, should face uphill, and the barrel\r\nof each pipe should have even bearing throughout its length. Sufficient\r\nearth should be removed from beneath the hubs to permit the joints to be\r\nmade in a workmanlike manner.\r\n\r\nThe house sewer may be vitrified salt-glazed sewer pipe, concrete pipe, or\r\ncast-iron soil pipe. The latter, with poured and calked lead joints makes\r\na permanently water-tight and root-proof sewer, which always should be\r\nused where the vicinity of a well must be passed; 4, 5, or 6-inch pipe may\r\nbe used, depending mainly on the fall and in less degree on the quantity\r\nof sewage discharge. As a measure of economy the 4-inch size is favored\r\nfor iron pipe. If vitrified pipe is used, either the 5 or 6-inch size is\r\npreferable, as these sizes are made straighter than the 4-inch size and\r\nare less liable to obstruction. Of the two the 5-inch size is preferable.\r\nThe fall in 100 feet should never be less than 2 feet for 4-inch size, 1½\r\nfeet for 5-inch size, 1 foot for 6-inch size.\r\n\r\nFigure 19 shows methods of making good joints. _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, _E_,\r\n_F_, and _G_ are ordinary sewer pipe joints; _H_, cast-iron soil pipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--How to make good joints. See text for directions\r\nand specifications]\r\n\r\n _A_ shows the use of a yarning iron to pack a small strand of jute into\r\n the joint space, thus centering the pipes and preventing the joint filler\r\n running inside. The joint surfaces should be free of dirt and oil. The\r\n jute is cut in lengths to go around the pipe; a small strand is soaked\r\n in neat Portland cement grout, then twisted and wrapped around the small\r\n end of the pipe to be pushed into the hub of the last pipe laid. After\r\n the pipe is pushed home the jute is packed evenly to a depth of not over\r\n ½ inch, leaving about 1½ inches for the joint filler. Old hemp rope or\r\n oakum dipped in liquid cement or paper may be used, in place of jute, and\r\n the packing may be done with a thin file or piece of wood.\r\n\r\n _B_ shows the use of a rubber mitten or glove to force Portland cement\r\n mortar into the joint space. The mortar should be thoroughly and freshly\r\n mixed in the proportion of one volume of cement to one volume of clean\r\n sand and should be pressed and tamped to fill the joint completely.\r\n\r\n _C_ shows a section of finished joint. The fresh mortar should not be\r\n loosened or disturbed when laying the next pipe.\r\n\r\n _D_ shows method of pouring a joint with grout, which is quicker,\r\n cheaper, and better than using a rubber mitten. A flexible sheet-metal\r\n form or mold, oiled to prevent the grout sticking, is clamped tightly\r\n around the joint and is completely filled with grout consisting of equal\r\n parts of Portland cement and clean sand mixed dry, to which water is\r\n added to produce a creamy consistency. The pipes should not be disturbed\r\n and the form should not be removed for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n _E_ shows a section of grouted joint, well rounded out, strong, and tight.\r\n\r\n _F_ shows the use of a pipe jointer for pouring a hot filler. The pipe\r\n jointer may be an asbestos or rubber runner or collar or a piece of\r\n garden hose clamped around the pipe leaving a small triangular opening\r\n at the top. The jointer is pressed firmly against the hub, and any\r\n small openings between the jointer and pipe are smeared with plastic\r\n clay to prevent leakage of the filler. A clay dike or funnel about 3\r\n inches high built around the triangular opening greatly aids rapid and\r\n complete filling of the joint space. The filler may be a commercially\r\n prepared bituminous compound or molten sulphur and fine sand. The former\r\n makes a slightly elastic joint; the latter a hard unyielding joint. With\r\n good workmanship both kinds of joint are practically water-tight and\r\n root-proof, and cost about the same as cement mortar joints. The filler\r\n is heated in an iron kettle over a wood, coke, or coal fire. It should\r\n be well stirred, and when at a free running consistency should be poured\r\n with a ladle large enough to fill the joint completely at one operation.\r\n As soon as the compound cools the jointer is removed. Sulphur-sand\r\n filler is made by mixing together dry and melting equal volumes of\r\n ordinary powdered sulphur and very fine clean sand, preferably the finest\r\n quicksand. A 5-inch sewer pipe joint requires from three-tenths to\r\n nine-tenths of a pound (according to the kind of pipe) of sulphur, worth\r\n 3 to 5 cents per pound, and a like quantity of sand. From ½ to 1½ pounds\r\n of bituminous filler are required for a 5-inch pipe joint.\r\n\r\n _G_ shows section of finished joint.\r\n\r\n _H_ shows the use of a pouring ladle in making lead joints in cast-iron\r\n soil pipe. This pipe is in lengths to lay 5 feet, and the metal of the\r\n barrel is ¼ inch thick. The joint is yarned with dry jute or oakum, as\r\n described above, and is poured full with molten, soft, pig lead to be\r\n afterwards driven tightly with hammer and calking tools. About ¾ pound\r\n of lead for each inch in diameter of pipe is required. Prepared cements\r\n of varying composition have proved effective and, as they require no\r\n calking, are economical. Among the best is a finely ground, thoroughly\r\n mixed compound of iron, sulphur, slag, and salt.\r\n\r\n _I_ is a homemade pipe jointer or clay roll for use in pouring molten\r\n lead. A strand of jute long enough to encircle the pipe and the ends to\r\n fold back, leaving an opening at the top, is covered with clay moistened,\r\n rolled and worked to form a plastic rope about 1 inch in diameter. The\r\n jointer gives the very best results but must be frequently moistened and\r\n worked to keep the clay soft and pliable. The jointer shown in _F_ is\r\n frequently used for pouring lead joints.\r\n\r\nObstructions in house sewers are frequent. Among the causes are broken\r\npipes, grade insufficient to give cleansing velocities, newspaper, rags,\r\ngarbage, or other solids in the sewage, congealing of grease in pipes\r\nand main running traps (house sewer traps), and poor joint construction\r\nwhereby rootlets grow into the sewer and choke it. Good grade and good\r\nconstruction with particular care given to the joints, will avert or\r\nlessen these troubles. The sewer should be perfectly straight, with the\r\ninterior of the joints scraped or swabbed smooth. When the joint-filling\r\nmaterial has set, the hollows beneath the hubs should be filled with good\r\nearth free of stones, well tamped or puddled in place. It is important\r\nthat like material be used at the sides of the pipe and above it for at\r\nleast 1 foot. The back filling may be completed with scraper or plow. No\r\nrunning trap should be placed on the house sewer, because it is liable\r\nto become obstructed and it prevents free movement of air through the\r\nsewer and soil stack. Conductors or drains for rain or other clean water\r\nshould never connect with the house sewer, but should discharge into a\r\nwatercourse or other outlet.\r\n\r\nWhere obstruction of a house sewer occurs, use of some of the simple tools\r\nshown in Figure 20 may remedy the trouble. It is not likely that farmers\r\nwill have these appliances, except possibly some of the augers; but some\r\nof them can be made at home or by a blacksmith, and most of them should\r\nbe obtainable for temporary use from a well-organized town or city sewer\r\ndepartment. The purpose of the several tools shown is indicated in the\r\nnotation.\r\n\r\n=The tank.=--The septic tank should be in an isolated location at least\r\n50 to 100 feet from any dwelling. This is not always possible, because of\r\nflat ground, but in many such instances reasonable distance and fall may\r\nbe secured by raising both the house sewer and tank and embanking them\r\nwith earth. Cases are known where tanks adjoin cellar or basement walls\r\nand the top of the tank is used as a doorstep; in other cases tanks have\r\nbeen constructed within buildings. Such practices are bad. It is difficult\r\nto construct an absolutely water-tight masonry tank, and still more\r\ndifficult to make it proof against the passage of sewer odors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Sewer-cleaning tools--how to use them. _A_,\r\nOrdinary 1½ or 2 inch auger welded to a piece 1¾-inch extra strong wrought\r\npipe about 5 feet long: the stem is lengthened by adding other pieces of\r\npipe with screw couplings, and is fitted with a pipe handle; all cleaning\r\nwork should proceed upstream; _B_, twist or open earth auger; _C_, ribbon\r\nor closed earth auger; _D_, spiral or coal auger; _E_, ship auger; _F_,\r\nroot cutter; _G_, sewer rods, with hook coupling, usually of hickory\r\nor ash 1 or 1¼ inches in diameter and 3 or 4 feet long; _H_, gouge for\r\ncutting obstructions; _I_, scoop for removing sand or similar material;\r\n_J_, claw, and _K_, screw, for removing paper and rags; _L_, scraper; _M_,\r\nwire brush for removing grease, drawn back and forth with a wire or rope;\r\n_N_, homemade wire brush (for a 5-inch sewer use a 1½-inch wooden pole\r\nto which is securely tacked a piece of heavy rubber, canvas, or leather\r\nbelting or harness leather 5½ by 8 inches, spirally studded, as shown,\r\nwith ordinary wire nails 1½ inches in length)]\r\n\r\nIn Northern States, particularly in exposed situations, it is desirable to\r\nhave the top of the tank 1 to 2 feet underground, thus promoting warmth\r\nand uniformity of temperature in the sewage. In Southern States this\r\nfeature is less important, and the top of the tank may be flush with the\r\nground. Every tank should be tightly covered, for the reasons above stated\r\nand to guard against the spread of odors, the transmission of disease\r\ngerms by flies, and accidents to children.\r\n\r\nConsiderable latitude is allowable in the design and construction of\r\nseptic tanks. No particular shape or exact dimensions can be presented for\r\na given number of people. One family of 5 persons may use as much water\r\nas another family of 10 persons; hence the quantity of sewage rather than\r\nthe number of persons is the better basis of design. Exact dimensions\r\nare not requisite, for settlement and septicization proceed whether the\r\nsewage is held a few hours more or a few hours less. As to materials of\r\nconstruction, some form of masonry, either brick, building tile, rubble,\r\nconcrete, or cement block, is employed generally. Vitrified pipe, steel,\r\nand wood have been used occasionally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--One-chamber septic tank--does nothing more than\r\na tight cesspool. Brick construction, heavily plastered inside; size\r\nsuitable for 180 to 280 gallons of sewage daily (nominally 4 to 7 persons)]\r\n\r\nA plant for use all year round should have two chambers, one to secure\r\nsettlement and septicization of the solids and the other to secure\r\nperiodic discharge of the effluent by the use of an automatic sewage\r\nsiphon. The first chamber is known as the settling chamber, the second\r\nas the siphon or dosing chamber. The siphon chamber is often omitted\r\nand the effluent is allowed to dribble away through subsurface tile, as\r\nillustrated in Figure 16. The latter procedure is not generally advised,\r\nbut may be permissible where the land slopes sharply or has long periods\r\nof rest, as at summer houses and camps.\r\n\r\nThe septic tanks shown in this bulletin are designed to satisfy the\r\nfollowing conditions:\r\n\r\n1. Water consumption of 40 gallons per person per day of 24 hours.\r\n\r\n2. A detention period of about 24 hours; that is, the capacity of the\r\nsettling chamber below the flow line is approximately equal to the\r\nquantity of sewage discharged from the house in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n3. Where a siphon chamber is provided, its size is such that the dose of\r\nsewage shall be approximately equal to 20 gallons per person; that is, the\r\ncapacity of the siphon chamber between the discharge and low-water lines\r\nis roughly equal to the quantity of sewage discharged in 12 hours.\r\n\r\nA simple one-chamber brick tank suitable for a household discharging 180\r\nto 280 gallons of sewage daily is shown in Figure 21. A small two-chamber\r\ntank constructed of 24-inch vitrified pipe, suitable for a household\r\ndischarging about 125 gallons of sewage daily, is shown in Figure 22. A\r\ntypical two-chamber concrete tank is shown in Figure 23. Excepting the\r\nsubmerged outlet, all pipes within the tank and built into the masonry\r\nare cast-iron soil pipe with cast-iron fittings. Vitrified or concrete\r\nsewer pipe and specials are generally used, as they are frequently more\r\nreadily obtainable and a slight saving in first cost may be effected. Cast\r\niron is less liable to be broken in handling or after being set rigidly in\r\nmasonry, and the joints are more easily made water-tight. The submerged\r\noutlet is midway of the depth of liquid in the settling chamber. The\r\ninside depth of the siphon chamber is the drawing depth of the siphon plus\r\n1 foot 5 inches.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the principal dimensions with quantities of\r\nmaterials for four sizes of tank as illustrated in Figure 23:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dimensions and quantities for septic tanks_\r\n\r\n  --------+--------+--------+--------------------------------------------\r\n          |Quantity|        |          Settling chamber.\r\n          |   of   |Capacity|\r\n  Number  | sewage | below  +-------+-------+-------+----+-------+---+---\r\n    of    | in 24  |  flow  |Length.| Depth.|Width. | W. |   X.  | Y.| Z.\r\n  persons.| hours. |  line. |       |       |       |    |       |   |\r\n  --------+--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+----+-------+---+---\r\n          | Galls. | Galls. |Ft.

If the spaces within a filter or soil are constantly\r\nfilled with water, air is excluded, and the action of the filtering\r\nmaterial is merely that of a mechanical strainer with its clogging\r\ntendency. The purpose of a siphon is twofold: (1) To secure intermittent\r\ndischarge, thus allowing a considerable period of time for one dose to\r\nwork off in the soil and for air to enter the soil spaces before another\r\nflush is received; (2) to secure distribution over a larger area and in a\r\nmore even manner than where the sewage is allowed to dribble and produce\r\nthe conditions of the old-fashioned sink drain--namely, a small area of\r\nwater-logged ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Two-chamber septic tank, simple and inexpensive,\r\nconstructed of 24-inch vitrified sewer pipe, size suitable for 125 gallons\r\nof sewage daily (nominally 3 persons). _A_, House sewer; _B_, settling\r\nchamber, made of double =T= branch and one length of straight pipe, each 3\r\nfeet long and 2 feet in diameter, supported by 4 inches of concrete, all\r\njoints made water-tight; _C_, submerged outlet, consisting of a metal =T=\r\nslipped into the sewer-pipe branch; _D_, wire screen ¼-inch mesh; _E_,\r\nsiphon chamber made of one =T= branch 3 feet long and 2 feet in diameter;\r\n_F_, siphon; _G_, 3-inch overflow; _H_, sewer to distribution field; _I_,\r\ntight cover with lifting ring; _J_, concrete protection around sewer-pipe\r\nhubs]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Typical two-chamber concrete septic tank. (See\r\ntable for dimensions and quantities for different sizes)]\r\n\r\nThree types of sewage siphon are shown in Figure 24. In all, the essential\r\nprinciple is the same: A column of air is entrapped between two columns\r\nof water; when the water in the chamber rises to a predetermined height,\r\ncalled the discharge line, the pressure forces out the confined air,\r\ndestroying the balance and causing a rush of water through the siphon to\r\nthe sewer. The entire operation is automatic and very simple. The siphons\r\nshown are commercial products made of cast-iron; they have few parts and\r\nnone that move, and the whole construction is simple and durable. The\r\ntable (fig. 24) lists stock sizes adapted to farm use. Manufacturers\r\nfurnish full information for setting their siphons and putting them in\r\noperation. For example, take type 2, Figure 24: (1) Set siphon trap\r\n(=U=-shaped pipe) plumb, making E (height from floor to top of long leg)\r\nas specified; (2) fill siphon trap with water till it begins to run out at\r\nB; (3) place bell in position on top of long leg, and the siphon is ready\r\nfor service. Do not fill vent pipe on side of bell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Three types of sewage siphon. The table gives\r\ndimensions for setting standard 3 and 4 inch siphons; also the appropriate\r\nsize and grade of the sewer to carry the siphon discharge]\r\n\r\nThe overhead siphon, type 3, Figure 24, may be installed readily in a tank\r\nalready built by addition of an outlet sump. If properly set are handled,\r\nsewage siphons require very little attention and flush with certainty.\r\nLike all plumbing fixtures they are liable to stoppage if rags, newspaper,\r\nand similar solids get into the sewage. If fouling of the sniffing hole\r\nor vent prevents the entrance of sufficient air into the bell to lock the\r\nsiphon properly, allowing sewage to dribble through, the remedy is to\r\nclean the siphon. Siphons are for handling liquid; sludge if allowed to\r\naccumulate will choke them.\r\n\r\n=Submerged outlet.=--The purpose of a submerged outlet is to take the\r\noutflow from a point between the sludge at the bottom and the floating\r\nsolids or scum. The outlet in Figure 23 may be readily made of sheet\r\nmetal by a tinsmith. Wrought iron or steel pipe with elbows or light lead\r\npipe may be used, the pipe being set in the concrete and left in place.\r\nSometimes a galvanized wire screen (¼-inch mesh) is fitted over the inner\r\nend to prevent large solids leaving the settling chamber and possibly\r\nclogging the siphon or distribution tile. If a screen is used it should be\r\neasily removable for cleaning.\r\n\r\n=Manhole frame and cover.=--The frame and cover shown in Figure 23 are\r\nstock patterns made of cast-iron and weighing about 250 pounds per set.\r\nThe cover is 21 inches in diameter; it is tight and, on account of its\r\nweight, is unlikely to be disturbed by small children. The frame or rim\r\nis about 7 inches high and 31 inches in longest diameter. If desired,\r\nlight cast-iron cistern or cesspool covers obtainable from plumbing supply\r\nhouses, homemade slabs of reinforced concrete (see fig. 25), or wooden\r\ncovers (see fig. 21) may be used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Homemade reinforced concrete covers. (1) Slabs\r\nplaced crosswise permit uncovering the whole tank for cleaning, but as\r\ninspection is somewhat difficult, cleaning is the more likely to be\r\nneglected; (2) manhole, 18 inches square; cover, 22 by 22 by 3 inches\r\nthick, easy to make and to slide or lift from the opening]\r\n\r\n=Overflow.=--The purpose of an overflow is to pass sewage to the\r\ndistribution field should the siphon stop working. The overflow (fig. 23)\r\nis a 3-inch riser pipe with top 3 inches above the discharge line and the\r\nbottom calked or cemented into the side outlet of a =T= branch. The run of\r\nthe =T= branch should correspond with the size of the sewer from the tank\r\nto the distribution field. If this sewer is 4-inch pipe, a 4 by 3 inch\r\n=T= branch is used, the 4-inch spigot end of the siphon being calked or\r\ncemented into the branch, as shown in Figure 23; if the sewer is 5-inch, a\r\n5 by 3 inch =T= branch is used and connected to the siphon with a 5-inch\r\nto 4-inch reducer (in vitrified specials the equivalent is a 4-inch to\r\n5-inch increaser); if the sewer is 6-inch, a 6 by 3 inch =T= branch is\r\nused and connected to the siphon with a 6-inch to 4-inch reducer.\r\n\r\n=Concrete work.=--Before excavation for the tank is begun, two wooden\r\nforms should be built for shaping the inside of the settling and siphon\r\nchambers. In most instances the ground is fairly firm, so that the lines\r\nof excavation may conform to the outside dimensions of the tank, the\r\nback of the walls being built against the earth. The forms may be made\r\nof square-edged boards, braced and lightly nailed, as shown in Figure\r\n26. The forms should have no bottom. If it is desired to lay the sides\r\nand covering slab in one operation, the top of the forms must be boarded\r\nover. All pipe and manhole openings should be accurately placed and cut.\r\nThe faces of the forms may be covered with paper or smeared with soap or\r\ngrease to facilitate removal later.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Forms for concrete work--how to use them]\r\n\r\n 1 Make the forms as shown and to the dimensions required by Figure 23\r\n and the table on p. 29; nails to be driven from the inside and left\r\n projecting for drawing with a claw hammer.\r\n\r\n 2. Excavate to lines 6 or 8 inches, as may be required, outside of the\r\n forms and to the depths required for both chambers.\r\n\r\n 3. Pour settling chamber floor and place form thereon.\r\n\r\n 4 Pour settling chamber walls to level of siphon chamber excavation,\r\n inserting submerged outlet pipe at the proper height. 5. Block siphon and\r\n short pipes to correct line and grade, and fill with concrete around the\r\n trap.\r\n\r\n 6. Pour siphon chamber floor, and place the form thereon.\r\n\r\n 7 Continue pouring all walls to their full height, inserting the inlet\r\n pipe when the concrete reaches that elevation.\r\n\r\n 8. Do not remove forms till the concrete is hard; with favorable weather,\r\n forms for walls only may be removed in 1 to 2 days; forms supporting a\r\n cover slab should remain 1 to 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe ground should next be excavated to the proper depth for placing the\r\nfloors in both chambers. The settling chamber floor, being the lower,\r\nshould be placed first. Effort should be made to secure water-tight\r\nwork, a feature of especial importance where leakage might endanger a\r\nwell or spring. A concrete mixture of 1:2:4 is generally preferred (1\r\nvolume cement, 2 volumes sand, 4 volumes stone). The ingredients should\r\nbe of best quality and thoroughly mixed. The concrete should be poured\r\npromptly and worked with a spade or flat shovel to make the face smooth\r\nand eliminate pockets or voids within the mass.[10] Before the settling\r\nchamber floor has hardened the form should be set upon the floor and the\r\nconcrete work continued up the sides. The pipe form for the submerged\r\noutlet should be set. When the side walls of the settling chamber have\r\nreached the bottom of the excavation for the siphon chamber, the siphon\r\ntrap with its connecting branch and short piece of pipe should be set to\r\nproper line and grade and blocked in position. The floor of the siphon\r\nchamber should now be poured and the form for that chamber placed thereon,\r\nleaving a 6-inch or 8-inch space (according to the thickness of the\r\ndivision wall) between the ends of the two forms. Pouring of all side\r\nwalls and the top slab should continue without stop, making the entire\r\nstructure a monolith.\r\n\r\n[10] See footnote, p. 12. For more detailed information on form and\r\nconcrete work the reader is referred to U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nFarmers' Bulletin 1480-F, \"Small Concrete Construction on the Farm.\"\r\n\r\n=Steel reinforcement.=--To stiffen the cover slab and guard against\r\ncracking, a little steel should be embedded in the concrete about 1 inch\r\nabove the inside top. For this purpose a strip of heavy stock fencing is\r\nconvenient and inexpensive. The line wires should be not less than No.\r\n10 gauge (about 1/8 inch) and the stay wires not less than No. 11 gauge.\r\nThe reinforcement should be cut at manholes and fastened around manhole\r\nopenings. If desired a standard wire-mesh reinforcement weighing about\r\none-third of a pound per square foot may be used. Another alternative is\r\nto use 14-inch round rods, spacing the crosswise rods 6 inches apart and\r\nthe lengthwise rods 12 inches apart. Poultry netting should not be used,\r\nbecause of its lightness.\r\n\r\n=Sewer from tank to distribution field.=--The length of this sewer depends\r\non the situation of the field and the fall to it. The size of the sewer\r\ndepends on the fall that can be obtained and the size of siphon. The table\r\nin Figure 24 shows the minimum fall at which 4-inch, 5-inch, and 6-inch\r\nsewers should be laid to take the discharge of the 3-inch and 4-inch\r\nsiphons specified. The line and grade should be set in the same manner\r\nas for the house sewer (see fig. 18) and the construction should be as\r\nspecified under that caption.\r\n\r\n=Distribution field.=--The distribution field or area is a sewage filter,\r\nand its selection and the manner of preparing it largely determine the\r\nsuccess of subsoil disposal of sewage. As a rule farm land is not the best\r\nfiltering material. It is too fine grained and fertile. Its tendency is to\r\nhold water too long, to admit insufficient air, to clog when even small\r\nquantities of sewage are applied. Hence the distribution area should be\r\nof liberal size--on the average 500 square feet for each person served.\r\nIt should be dry, porous, and well drained--qualities that characterize\r\nsandy, gravelly, and light loam soils. It should be devoid of trees and\r\nshrubbery, thus giving sunlight and air free access. It should be located\r\nat least 300 feet downhill from a well or spring used for domestic water\r\nsupply. Preferably it should slope gently, but sharp slopes are not\r\nprohibitive. Subsoiling the area is always desirable.\r\n\r\nClay and other compact, impervious soils require special treatment. Less\r\nsewage can be applied to them, and hence it is well to have the area\r\nlarger than 500 square feet per person. Clay should be subsoiled as deep\r\nas possible with a subsoil plow. In some instances dynamite has been\r\nof service in opening up the ground to still greater depth. Drainage\r\nand aeration should be further promoted by laying tile underdrains, as\r\noutlined in Figure 17 and shown in more detail in Figure 29.\r\n\r\nAfter the construction work the distribution areas should be raked\r\nand seeded with thick-growing grass. Grass is a safe crop; its water\r\nrequirement is high, and it affords considerable protection from frost.\r\nSuitable grasses are redtop, white clover, blue grass, and Bermuda grass.\r\nThe area may be pastured or kept as grass land.\r\n\r\n=Distribution system.=--Poor distribution of the sewage and failure to\r\nprotect the joints of the distribution tile account for most of the\r\nfailures. Each flush of the siphon should be so controlled that every part\r\nof the field will receive its due proportion. The distribution tile must\r\nbe so laid that loose dirt will not fall or wash into the open joints.\r\n\r\nDifferent methods of dividing the flush and laying out the distribution\r\ntile are shown in Figures 27 and 30. Layouts 1, 2, and 3, Figure 27, are\r\nsuitable for flat or gently sloping areas and are planned for the shallow\r\nsiphon chambers tabulated on page 29. Layout 4, Figure 27, is suitable for\r\nsteep slopes. In all four layouts use is made of one or more =V= branches\r\n(not =Y= branches) to divide the flow equally among the several lines. =V=\r\nbranches, sometimes called breeches, should be leveled with a carpenter's\r\nlevel crosswise the ends of the legs, thus insuring equal division of the\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nThe size and length of distribution tile and the spacing of the lines\r\nor runs admit of considerable variation in different soils. Water sinks\r\nrapidly in gravels and sands, and hence larger tile and shorter length are\r\npermissible than in close soils. Lateral movement is slow in all soils,\r\nbut extends farther in gravels and sands than in close soils. In average\r\nsoils the effect on vegetation 5 feet away from the line is practically\r\nnil.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations, with the siphon dose 20 gallons per person, it\r\nis usually a safe rule to provide 50 feet of 3-inch tile for each person\r\nserved and to lay the lines 10 feet apart. Such provision gives a capacity\r\nwithin the bore of the tile lines about equal to the siphon dose, and\r\nas some sewage is wasted at each joint a reasonable factor of safety is\r\nprovided. A spacing of 10 feet will, it is believed, permanently prevent\r\nthe extension of lateral absorption from line to line, provided the area\r\nis fairly well drained. As between 3-inch and 4-inch tile the smaller\r\nsize costs less and is better calculated to taper the dose to small\r\nproportions. Four-inch tile is less likely to get out of alignment or to\r\nbecome clogged; a length of 28 feet has the same capacity in the bore as\r\n50 feet of 3-inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Methods of laying distribution system: Methods\r\n1, 2, and 3 for flat or gently sloping land; method 4 for steep slopes\r\n(see also fig. 30); _A_, direction of slope; _B_, contour of field; _C_,\r\nsewer from tank, preferably size 5 inch, though 4 or 6 inch may be used,\r\ndepending on the fall and the size of the siphon (see table, fig. 24);\r\n_D_, =V=-branch set to divide the flow exactly; _E_, reducer, to 4 inches;\r\n_F_, 1/8 bend, 4-inch; _G_, increaser, from 4 inches; _H_, increaser, 3\r\nto 4 inches; _I_, reducer, 4 to 3 inches; _J_, distribution tile, 3-inch;\r\n_K_, distribution tile, 4-inch]\r\n\r\nGood-quality drain tile in 1-foot lengths or second-quality sewer pipe\r\nin 2-foot lengths may be used. The lines are generally laid in parallel\r\nruns, but may be varied according to the topography. Layouts 1, 2, and 3,\r\nFigure 27, for flat or gently sloping land, run with the slope; layout 4,\r\nfor steep slopes, runs back and forth along the contour in a series of\r\nlong flat sweeps and short steep curves. The grade of the runs and sweeps\r\nshould be gentle, rarely more than 10 or 12 inches in 100 feet. In layouts\r\n1, 2, and 3, Figure 27 especially, it is desirable that the last 20 feet\r\nof each run should be laid level or given a slight upward slope, thus\r\nguarding against undue flow of sewage to the lowest ends of the system.\r\n\r\nThe runs should be laid no deeper than necessary to give clearance when\r\nplowing and prevent injury from frost. Ten inches of earth above the top\r\nof the tile is sufficient generally throughout the southern half of the\r\nUnited States and 18 inches generally in the North, but if the field\r\nis exposed or lacks a thick heavy growth of grass, the cover should be\r\nincreased to 3 to 6 feet near the Canadian line. Where frost goes down 5\r\nto 7 feet, it is better to lay the tile at moderate depth and cover the\r\nruns with hay, straw, or leaves weighted down, removing the covering in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nMaking the joints of the distribution tile demands especial attention.\r\nFor a short distance on the upper end of each run the tile should be laid\r\nwith ends abutting; the joint opening should be increased gradually to\r\none-eighth inch and this increased to one-fourth in the last 20 feet of\r\nthe run. All joints should be protected against the entrance of loose\r\ndirt. Four methods are shown in Figure 28. The lower end of each run\r\nshould be closed with a brick or flat stone; or, what is better, an elbow\r\nor =T= branch may be placed on the end and vented above the surface of the\r\nground, improving the flow of sewage, the ventilation of pipes, and the\r\naeration of the soil.\r\n\r\nIf the distribution tile must be laid in clay or other close, poorly\r\ndrained soil, special treatment is necessary. A common method is to\r\nsubsoil and underdrain the area thoroughly, as shown in Figure 29.\r\nIt is not always possible to run the underdrain in lines between the\r\ndistribution lines as shown in Figures 17 and 29, but it is a desirable\r\nthing to do, as the sewage must then receive some filtration through\r\nnatural soil.\r\n\r\nIn some instances it is sufficient to lay the distribution tile on a\r\ncontinuous bed, 8 to 12 inches thick, of coarse gravel, broken stone, or\r\nbrick, slag, coke, or cinders and complete the refill as shown in Figure\r\n16 or 29.\r\n\r\nFigure 30 shows two other methods of controlling the flow on steep slopes\r\nand diverting proper proportions to the several lateral distributors laid\r\nalong the contour of the field. This work can not be effected properly\r\nwith =T= or =Y= branches; the flow tends to shoot straight ahead,\r\ncomparatively little escaping laterally. To overcome this difficulty\r\nrecourse is had to diverting boxes, of which two types are shown in Figure\r\n30. These boxes involve expense, but permit inspection and division of the\r\nflow according to the needs. They may be built of brick, stone, concrete,\r\nor even wood.\r\n\r\nType 1 consists of a single box, into which all the lateral distributors\r\nhead. It will be noted that the laterals enter at slightly different\r\nelevations, the two opposite the inlet sewer being the highest, the next\r\ntwo slightly lower, and the next two the lowest. This staggering of the\r\noutlets, in a measure, offsets the tendency of the flow to shoot across\r\nand escape by the most direct route.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Four methods of protecting open joints in\r\ndistribution lines--an all-important work. Sketches show cross-section and\r\nlongitudinal views; the depth from the surface of the ground to the top of\r\nthe tile is about 10 inches]\r\n\r\n 1. _A_, Subsoiled ground; _B_, 3 or 4 inch drain tile; _C_, strip of\r\n tarred paper about 6 inches wide and extending three-fourths the distance\r\n around the tile, allowing sewage to escape at the bottom; _D_, coarse\r\n sand, gravel, broken stone or brick, slag, cinders, or coke, the coarsest\r\n material placed around the tile (where the ground is naturally very\r\n porous and well drained, special filling in the trench may be omitted);\r\n _E_, natural soil.\r\n\r\n 2. Drain tile covered with a board laid flat, leaving the entire joint\r\n open.\r\n\r\n 3. Drain tile laid in stoneware gutter pieces and the joint covered\r\n with stoneware caps; gutter and cap pieces are inexpensive commercial\r\n products; their radius is longer than that of the outside of the tile,\r\n thus leaving open most of the joint space; the gutter aids in keeping the\r\n tile in line.\r\n\r\n 4. Vitrified sewer pipe with hubs facing downhill; the spigot end should\r\n be centered in the hub with a few small chinks or wedges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.---Close soils should be deeply subsoiled and\r\nunderdrained. Porous, well-drained, air-filled soil is absolutely\r\nnecessary. _A_, Subsoiled ground; _B_, 3 or 4 inch distribution tile; _C_,\r\ndepth variable with the climate, 1¼ to 3½ feet; _D_, 4-inch underdrain;\r\n_E_, depth such as would prepare land for good crop production, generally\r\n3½ to 4 feet; _F_, stone or other coarse material; _G_, gravel grading\r\nupward to coarse sand; _H_, loose soil]\r\n\r\nType 2 calls for one or more diverting boxes, according to the number of\r\nlateral distributors, and readily permits of wasting sewage at widely\r\nseparated elevations and distances. The outlet pipes enter the box at\r\nslightly different elevations, for the reason already stated. With either\r\ntype, should the outlets not be set at the right elevations, partial\r\nplugging of the holes and a little experimenting will enable one to\r\nequalize or proportion the discharges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Two systems of distribution on steep slopes--use\r\nof diverting box. _A_, Direction of slope; _B_, contour of field; _C_, 4,\r\n5, or 6 inch sewer from tank; _D_, diverting box; _E_, 3-inch or 4-inch\r\ndistribution tile]\r\n\r\n=Sewage switch.=--The clogging of filters and soils after long-continued\r\napplication of sewage has been previously referred to. It is, therefore,\r\ndesirable to arrange the distribution system in two units with a switch\r\nbetween them, so that one area may drain and become aerated while the\r\nother is in use. This procedure is especially desirable where the soil is\r\nclose and the installation of considerable size. It adds to the life and\r\neffectiveness of the distribution area and permits use of a plant in case\r\nit is necessary to repair, extend, or relay the tile in either unit.\r\n\r\nArrangement in two units does not necessarily mean doubling the amount\r\nof tile and the area required in a single field. However desirable that\r\nmay be, expense or lack of suitable ground will often prevent. With open\r\nsands and gravels and the assumed siphon dose of 20 gallons per person,\r\n15 to 20 feet of 4-inch tile in each unit for each person will usually\r\nsuffice. With more compact soil it is advisable to more nearly double the\r\nrequirements previously described. Two simple types of switch are shown in\r\nFigure 31. The switch should be turned frequently, certainly as often as\r\nis necessary to prevent saturation or bogginess of either area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Two simple types of sewage switch. _A_, Sewer\r\nfrom tank; _B_, switch box; _C_, cover; _D_, blade or stop board (in the\r\nleft-hand box the direction of flow is controlled by placing the blade in\r\nalternate diagonal position; in the right-hand box the stop works in iron\r\nguides cast integral with a short piece of light-weight pipe set in the\r\nmasonry; if desired the guides may be wood, fastened to the masonry with\r\nexpansion bolts); _E_, sewer to distribution area; _F_ (right-hand box),\r\nalternate position of outlets or additional outlets if required]\r\n\r\n=A complete installation.=--The general layout and working plans of\r\na complete installation built in 1915-16 are shown in Figure 32. The\r\nplant is larger than those heretofore considered, and involves several\r\nadditional features. The settling chamber below the flow line has a\r\ncapacity of 1,000 gallons, and on a basis of 40 gallons per person per day\r\nwould serve 25 people.\r\n\r\nFor many years sewage had been discharged through two 4-inch sewers to\r\na cesspool in the rear of the house. The proximity of the well made it\r\nunsafe, and the overflow of the cesspool dribbled over the low portion of\r\nthe garden and barnyard, cheating nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to make borings with a soil auger in the pasture 400\r\nor 500 feet from the house. The borings showed a heavy clay soil to a\r\ndepth of about 4 feet, underlaid with a sandy stratum only a few inches in\r\nthickness. It was decided to locate the distribution area in the pasture\r\nand to aid the seepage of sewage by digging numerous filter wells through\r\nthe clay to the sandy stratum. Levels were taken and a contour plan\r\nprepared to serve for laying out the plant and establishing the grades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--A complete installation for a large rural\r\nhome. General layout on a contour plan and construction drawings. Note\r\nabandonment of old cesspool near the well and garden and removal of sewage\r\nto a lower and safer location in the pasture, where the treatment is\r\nsubsurface distribution, aided by numerous filter wells about 4 feet deep\r\nfilled with coarse gravel. Note that sludge is removed from the bottom of\r\nthe settling chamber by opening the gate on the sludge drain]\r\n\r\nThe septic tank is built in one corner of the barnyard, and a 5-inch sewer\r\nconnects it with the old 4-inch sewers to the cesspool. All sewer-pipe\r\njoints were poured with a flexible jointing compound. The settling chamber\r\nis of hopper shape at the bottom, and a 4-inch sludge drain with gate\r\nprovides for the gravity removal of sludge. The lower end of the sludge\r\ndrain is above the surface of the ground and 9 feet below the flow line.\r\nThe end is protected by a small retaining wall, and the sludge is readily\r\ncaught in barrels and hauled out on the land for burial. The outlet is low\r\nenough to drain the settling chamber completely. If it is desired merely\r\nto force out the sludge, the drain may be brought to the surface under a\r\nhead of 3 to 5 feet, discharging the sludge into a trench or drying bed,\r\nto be applied later to the land. A 2-inch waste pipe about mid-depth of\r\nthe settling chamber permits drawing off the cleared portion of the sewage\r\nto the siphon chamber and from thence through another 2-inch waste pipe\r\ninto the 6-inch sewer leading to the distribution field.\r\n\r\nThe 4-inch siphon has a drawing depth of 33 inches, and as the siphon\r\nchamber is 4 feet wide by 6 feet long the dose is about 500 gallons. The\r\nsiphon cost $35. The 6-inch sewer to the switch box falls about 6 inches\r\nin 50 feet. The distribution field was thoroughly subsoiled, and about 800\r\nfeet of 3-inch tile was laid in each unit. At intervals of 25 feet along\r\nthe distribution trenches 6-inch holes were dug through the clay stratum\r\nwith a posthole digger. These holes were filled with stone and constitute\r\nthe filter wells previously mentioned. All tile lines are surrounded with\r\nstone and coarse gravel, and the ground has been trimmed to give a uniform\r\ncover of 12 inches. All work was done by day labor in a thorough manner.\r\nAs the men were doing other work at the same time the actual cost is not\r\nknown, but it is believed the installation cost about $700.\r\n\r\n=Cost data.=--Reliable cost figures are difficult to estimate. Labor,\r\nmaterials, freight, haulage, and other items vary greatly in different\r\nlocalities. The septic tank shown in Figure 21 contains about 1,000 bricks\r\nand is estimated to cost $60 complete. The septic tank shown in Figure\r\n23 for 5 persons is estimated to cost $135; for 10 persons, $170; for\r\n15 persons, $240; for 20 persons, $280. In Maryland, in 1916, the cost\r\nof installing a septic tank similar to that shown in Figure 23 (for 5\r\npeople), including 86 feet of 5-inch house sewer (55 feet of cast-iron\r\npipe passing a well, and 31 feet of vitrified pipe) and 214 feet of\r\nsecond-quality 4-inch sewer pipe in the distribution area, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Excavation, labor                            $7.50\r\n  Materials delivered                          46.60\r\n  Three-inch siphon, including freight         15.75\r\n  Construction, labor                          28.00\r\n  Supervision                                   5.00\r\n                                              ------\r\n     Total                                    102.85\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quotations in the following table will be found useful in making\r\nestimates of cost:\r\n\r\n               _Cost per foot of pipe and drain tile_\r\n\r\n      (Approximate retail prices, Washington, D.

The cost of clay bends, =T=-branches, reducers, and\r\nincreasers may be roughly estimated at four times the price of straight\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n=Operation.=--Attention must be given to every plant to insure success.\r\nUnusual or excessive foulness should be investigated. No chemicals should\r\nbe used in a septic tank; garbage, rags, newspaper, and other solids\r\nnot readily soluble in water should be kept out of sewers and tanks.\r\nThe plant should be inspected often, noting particularly if the siphon\r\nis operating satisfactorily. If scum forms in the settling chamber it\r\nshould be removed, and the sludge should be bailed or pumped out yearly.\r\nFrequently tanks are not cleaned out for three or four years, resulting in\r\nlarge quantities of solid matter going through to the distribution system\r\nand clogging it. Clogging may occur in the tile or in the adjacent soil.\r\nIn either case the tile should be dug up, cleaned, and relaid. In some\r\ncases it has been found advantageous to relay the tile between the former\r\nlines. When sewage is applied to fairly porous land at the slow rate here\r\nrecommended and the plant is well handled the tile lines should operate\r\nsatisfactorily for many years. Liming heavy soils tends to loosen and keep\r\nthem sweet.\r\n\r\n=Field data.=--As a basis for outlining or designing a suitable\r\ninstallation the following data should be known:\r\n\r\n  1. State, town, and whether in or near an incorporated municipality.\r\n\r\n  2. Usual number of persons to be served.\r\n\r\n  3. Average daily consumption of water in gallons.\r\n\r\n  4. Kind and depth of well, depth to water surface.\r\n\r\n  5. Character of soil, whether sandy, gravelly, loamy, clay, or muck.\r\n\r\n  6. Condition of soil as to drainage.\r\n\r\n  7. Character of subsoil.\r\n\r\n  8. Character of underlying rock and, if known, its depth below the\r\n       surface.\r\n\r\n  9. Depth to ground water at both house and field where sewage is to be\r\n       distributed.\r\n\r\n 10. Minimum winter temperature and approximate depth to which frost goes.\r\n\r\n 11. Number and kind of buildings to be connected with the sewer.\r\n\r\n 12. Number and kind of plumbing fixtures in each building.\r\n\r\n 13. Whether plumbing fixtures are to be put in the basement.\r\n\r\n 14. Depth of basement floor below ground.\r\n\r\nA plan to scale or a sketch with dimensions showing property lines,\r\nbuildings, wells, springs, and drainage outlets should be furnished. The\r\ndirection of surface drainage should be indicated by arrows. The slope of\r\nthe land (vertical fall in a stated horizontal distance) should be given\r\nor if possible a contour plan (showing lines of constant elevation) should\r\nbe furnished.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREASE TRAPS\r\n\r\nFarm sewage may contain from 10 to 30 pounds of grease and fats per person\r\nper year. This grease, originating mainly in the kitchen-sink, hinders\r\nseptic action and clogs pipes, filters, and soils. Half the grease may be\r\nstopped by a septic tank, but the remainder goes into the distribution\r\nsystem, interfering with its action. A grease trap is a device for\r\nseparating the grease from other wastes. The need for it may be lessened\r\nby carefully depositing waste greases and fats with the garbage; but\r\none should always be installed if the kitchen is carelessly managed or\r\ndischarges quantities of greasy water as at institutions, hotels, boarding\r\nhouses, and bakeshops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Three types of grease trap. _A_, Ready-made\r\ngrease trap; vitrified, salt-glazed earthenware; stock sizes: 10-inch\r\ndiameter by 24 inches, 12-inch diameter by 24 inches, 15-inch diameter\r\nby 24 inches. _B_, Homemade grease trap; concrete or well-plastered\r\nbrickwork; elbow, cross, and increaser to be recessed drainage fittings.\r\n_C_, Type of grease trap used at United States Army camps]\r\n\r\nA grease trap should have several times the capacity of the greatest\r\nquantity of greasy water discharged into it at one time, in order that\r\nthe entering water shall be well cooled and the grease congealed. The\r\nsolidified grease rises to the surface of the water in the trap and is\r\nretained therein. A dishpan of greasy water (2½ to 3 gallons) is the\r\nlargest quantity likely to be discharged at one time from an ordinary\r\nkitchen-sink, hence the grease trap should have not less capacity than 7\r\nor 8 gallons. Figure 33 shows three types of grease traps suitable for\r\nfarm use. In each the outlet pipe has small clearance at the bottom. This\r\nfeature, together with the =V=-shaped hopper bottom, tends to create a\r\nscouring velocity and thus prevent the accumulation of coffee grounds and\r\nother solid wastes in the bottom of the trap. A grease trap should be\r\nclose to the sink it is intended to serve, but not within the kitchen, on\r\naccount of objectionable odors when the trap is opened to remove grease.\r\nIt is good practice to place the trap in the cellar or basement, where it\r\nis safe from frost yet close to the source of grease.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nDo not waste money by digging and partly constructing, afterwards seeking\r\ninformation. Prepare a plan and work from it. Get in touch with your\r\ncounty agricultural and home demonstration agents. Advice may be obtained\r\nalso from extension workers, State agricultural colleges, State and local\r\nboards of health, the United States Public Health Service, and the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture. Do not guess distances and levels.\r\nUse a measuring tape and some type of level--engineer's, architect's,\r\ndrainage, hand, or carpenter's. Study this bulletin, and design, lay\r\nout, and construct in accordance therewith. Remember to: (1) Isolate the\r\nseptic tank--locate it 50 to 100 or more feet from any dwelling and, if\r\npracticable, to the leeward of prevailing summer breezes; (2) locate the\r\ncesspool or sewage-distribution field downhill from the well or spring,\r\nand, if possible, 300 feet therefrom; (3) select dry, porous, deeply\r\ndrained ground for disposal of all sewage; (4) do not apply more sewage to\r\na given area of land than can be thoroughly absorbed and oxidized; (5) lay\r\nsewers straight and below the reach of frost, ventilate them thoroughly,\r\nand make the joints water-tight and root-proof.\r\n\r\nMakeshift methods, materials, or devices should be avoided or used\r\nsparingly. Do not place a vent pipe in the top of a cesspool or septic\r\ntank if near a dwelling. Siphon chamber and siphon may be omitted in those\r\nrare instances where it is feasible to discharge into salt water or into\r\na large stream already badly polluted. Disposal of sewage in a running\r\nstream should be a last resort. Such practice endangers water supplies\r\ndownstream, and unless the volume and velocity of flow are good nuisance\r\nmay be created in the vicinity. Do not neglect inspection and operation.\r\nClean out settling tanks yearly or oftener. All pipe lines below ground\r\nshould be marked with iron or stone markers to facilitate examination,\r\nrepair, or extension of the system.\r\n\r\nThere is a general but erroneous belief that the cost of sewerage is\r\nlittle in the city but almost prohibitive in the country. All personal and\r\nRealty properties in one eastern city represent a valuation of $10,382\r\nper home, which pays $355 for sewers outside the cellar wall. An average\r\nfarm in a Middle West State represents a valuation of $17,259. Is not\r\nthe farmer justified in the small outlay required to dispose of the farm\r\nsewage? Because of the issuance of bonds and the apportionment of sewer\r\nassessments for a series of years the city dweller may have his burden\r\ndistributed over a long period. The farmer does not pay interest on these\r\nobligations, and sewer work can be done more cheaply in the country than\r\nin the city.\r\n\r\nSafe disposal of farm sewage is not a passing fad but a vital necessity.\r\nBesides being an asset a good sewerage installation greatly promotes the\r\nwholesomeness and healthfulness of the farm. Moreover the benefits are\r\nfar-reaching, because farm products go into every home, and farm and urban\r\npopulations mingle freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           January 6, 1930\r\n\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_              Arthur M.
