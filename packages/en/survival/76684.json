All my family with the exception\r\nof my father had been farmers and even he, in his latter years, had\r\ntalked wistfully of the independence of country life. His father had\r\nowned a fairly prosperous farm in New Hampshire and on his few acres\r\nhad lived and died. He had raised there wheat for his flour, wool for\r\nhis clothing, hides for his shoes, cream for his butter, and meat and\r\nvegetables for his table. He even made a fairly good imitation tea and\r\ncoffee and sweetened the drink with maple sugar from his own trees.\r\nGrandfather Carleton, according to father, could have built a Chinese\r\nwall about his fields and lived within its boundaries, asking favor\r\nof no man. I suppose it was the feeling of independence coming of this\r\nthat made such men as he good Americans; the first to shoulder muskets\r\nfor their country, the first to shoulder axes and blaze a trail through\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nRuth’s folks, too, had all been farmers. She herself was born and bred\r\non a farm and I think it was that which gave her such good health and\r\ngood courage. Though in the years of our struggle in the city I never\r\nheard her complain, I knew that always in her heart she had a great\r\nyearning for the fields and open sky. She never spoke of this, but\r\nsometimes Ruth says a great deal when she doesn’t speak. I know when I\r\nfirst told her of my plan she had to swallow hard to keep from crying.\r\n\r\nOne thing alone disturbed Ruth and that was the thought that with\r\nsuccess we were running away from our new-found friends.\r\n\r\n“Somehow it seems as though we ought to stay right on here where we’ve\r\nmade good and share our success with the others,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You talk as though we’d made our fortune and were going back to the\r\nfatherland,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I feel that way,” she admitted.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “the gang is part of me now and I wouldn’t quit if I\r\nwere worth a million. But we’re in a position where we can afford more\r\nelbow room now. Of course we can move back into the suburbs again, if\r\nwe want to.”\r\n\r\nShe shuddered a little at that.\r\n\r\n“Not back there,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Then the only other thing is a farm,” I said. “And if you want, you\r\ncan think of it as a farm for the whole gang. What a place it will be\r\nfor the kiddies; your own and the others!”\r\n\r\nThat was all the cue Ruth needed. On the spot she hatched plans enough\r\nto keep her busy all her life. It looked to me as though we’d need\r\na Carnegie endowment to carry out all her schemes, but I didn’t say\r\nanything. I’d felt that way before about her projects and seen her end\r\nby putting them through on a few dollars. If Ruth had put into business\r\nthe same amount of thought and brains and energy that she put into her\r\nphilanthropies she would have made a fortune.\r\n\r\nI went to a real estate dealer and there I received my first surprise.\r\nIt wasn’t my last, however. Before I was through with this business I\r\ndiscovered that I had as much to learn as I had during those first\r\nyears as an emigrant. And I may as well say right here that my\r\nexperience wasn’t the kind I’ve read about in the “Simple Life” and\r\n“Back to the Farm” stories. And because it was different is the reason\r\nI’m writing this. There’s been just as much nonsense written about\r\nthe farm as about the slums. One man makes it out a hell on earth and\r\nanother man makes it out a paradise on earth, and both of them are\r\nwrong and both of them are right, but neither of them seems to me to\r\nhave got at the heart of the matter.\r\n\r\nIn “One Way Out” I learned to my own satisfaction that if an emigrant\r\nsucceeds where an American fails it proves there’s something wrong with\r\nthe American. And there is. True as you’re living, there is. Something\r\nis lacking in him that his ancestors had; something lacking that the\r\nemigrant has to-day. I thought that I had learned this once for all\r\nbut when I got back into the country I had to learn it over again. The\r\nconditions were different, but the same facts held good.\r\n\r\nI received a surprise, I said, at the very beginning. It came when the\r\nreal estate man handed me a list of almost a hundred places for rent\r\nand for sale--all within easy reach of the city. I had my choice of\r\nanything from one acre to a hundred acres. Not only this but they were\r\noffered me almost at my own figure and my own terms. I found I could\r\nbuy a farm as easily as a set of books. I don’t think the agents would\r\nhave refused a dollar down and a dollar a week.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know anything about real estate values then, but judging from\r\nthe prices suburban property was bringing I had an idea that a fairly\r\ndecent place with buildings would cost me around ten thousand dollars.\r\nI found that for this sum I could get a fourteen room Colonial house\r\nwith land enough for a park. After living where the same amount of land\r\nwould almost make a ward, I was staggered. I thought there must be\r\nsomething crooked in the proposition. But I went to the other agencies\r\nand found the same bargains open to me. It seemed that farms were a\r\ndrug on the market.\r\n\r\nAnd this was in a section of the country which had been settled for\r\nover two hundred and fifty years! There’s something to think about in\r\nthat. It was within a ten cent car fare of a region which was absorbing\r\nemigrants by the hundred thousand. It was on the very outskirts of a\r\ncity which was howling about congestion and moaning over the high cost\r\nof living. Land was actually lying idle almost within sight of a market\r\npleading for more produce. It certainly looked queer.\r\n\r\nThese facts, however, didn’t concern me at the time. As soon as I made\r\nsure the facts were actually as represented, I set about making a\r\nselection. To Ruth and me this was like living our honeymoon all over\r\nagain. Perhaps it was more like living our youth again, for we hadn’t\r\never passed our honeymoon. I’d go over the lists with her in the\r\nevening and we’d check off the places that sounded good to us, and then\r\non the first fair morning we’d start to hunt them up. She’d leave the\r\nbaby at home with some of our good neighbors and we’d go as far as we\r\ncould on the electric cars and then walk. I wanted to have a carriage\r\nbut she wouldn’t hear of it because she wanted to feel free. Some days\r\nshe pretended we were gypsies and other days that we were two Indians\r\nhunting a spot to camp. I didn’t mind, because Dick was looking after\r\nmost of the business now so I could take my time without worrying about\r\nthat. In this way we squandered whole days along the country roads\r\ngoing through one old house after another and eating our lunch by the\r\nside of a brook or in a bit of woods.\r\n\r\nI think there must have been something in our blood inherited from our\r\nancestors, for we took to the open road as though we’d been born by its\r\nside. Oh, but those were good days--those days when we wandered about\r\nat our will in search of a home. It was June and the fields were full\r\nof flowers and the air full of birds. Ruth knew them every one and\r\ngreeted them like old friends, pointing them out to me. I could tell a\r\ncrow from a robin and a daisy from a buttercup, but that was about all,\r\nand yet to me also these wild things were like old friends. I had never\r\nmissed them, but after the first day I knew I could never do without\r\nthem again. It was just as I had felt about Ruth from the first time I\r\nsaw her.\r\n\r\nI suppose too that the contrast with our narrow quarters of the\r\nlast few years had something to do with our joy in the broader\r\nprospect. Not that we had ever felt crowded. We had in our tenement\r\nall the room we needed and our lives had been so full that we didn’t\r\nnotice our quarters anyway. Our lives were still full but with more\r\nleisure and less strain we wanted more than we needed. We were like\r\npioneers--content at the start with a log cabin or even a tent, but\r\nwith prosperity desiring larger and better quarters more as a matter of\r\ncomfort than necessity. We were now ready for a few of the luxuries of\r\nlife but we recognized frankly the fact that our new inclinations were\r\nluxuries. If success had been longer in coming than it was, we would\r\nhave remained where we were in perfect contentment.\r\n\r\nIt was hard for us to decide on any of the many old houses we explored\r\nbecause to us they all looked attractive. The thing we both liked about\r\nthem in spite of signs of decay was that they all seemed so firmly\r\nestablished. There was nothing flimsy about them. They looked as though\r\nthey had become rooted in the soil like the big elms which grew before\r\nso many of them. It was as though the winds and the sun and the rain\r\nhad tested them and found them honest. As Ruth said, in going into them\r\nyou wouldn’t feel as though you were beginning life again as you might\r\nin a brand new house, but were only starting where the last owner left\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAfter our experiences during the last few years we appreciated such\r\ndetails as those. There had been times in the emigrant days when way\r\ndown deep in our hearts we had felt a little bit like people without a\r\ncountry. We were pioneers and we gloried in that, but we were pioneers\r\nwithout a fatherland. We had no sunny Italy, no emerald isle, no gay\r\nFrance, not even a grim Russia to talk about over a pipe at the end of\r\nthe day as our neighbors had. We had to go back a century or more to\r\nget home, and vivid as that past seemed at times it was distinctly a\r\npast in which we had played no part. Now out here in the country where\r\nwe saw stone walls built by our forefathers, where the land had been\r\ntilled by them, where trees planted by them were still growing, where\r\nif not direct descendants of our own, descendants of the old stock\r\nstill lived, we felt closer to that history. So we thought that if we\r\nwent into one of the old houses built by our forefathers, it would\r\nbring us still nearer home.\r\n\r\nWe spent almost a month this way, anxious to draw out the pleasure as\r\nlong as possible.\r\n\r\n“I’ll know our home as soon as I see it,” said Ruth; “I’ll recognize it\r\nlike an old friend.”\r\n\r\nAnd so she did. One day toward nightfall--when in the country all the\r\nworld seems to get mellow--we came upon a little story and a half\r\nhouse connected by a shed with a ramshackly looking barn. It was half\r\nhidden behind trees and lilac bushes on the top of a knoll which sloped\r\nto a small lake some fifty rods distant. There wasn’t another house\r\nwithin sight of it--just woodland and pasture and fields. Standing\r\nthere on the old granite doorstep, you wouldn’t have believed there was\r\na city within a long day’s journey.\r\n\r\nWe had the key and went inside. The rooms were low studded and the\r\nwindows came down to within two feet of the floor. The ceilings were\r\ndiscolored and the paper was off in great patches where the roof had\r\nleaked. But in spite of this the place somehow was like home. Ruth took\r\nmy arm with a tight squeeze and looked up at me.\r\n\r\n“This is it, Billy,” she said.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t so sure as she was until all excited she began to tell me what\r\nshe was going to do. With the birds singing outside and the lazy sun\r\nstreaming through the windows slantwise, she led me through every room,\r\nselecting her papers, making her changes, and placing her furniture.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want a single new thing in this house,” she exclaimed. “We\r\nwant to keep it just as it was and don’t you see how it was?”\r\n\r\nI hadn’t ever lived in the country and so I didn’t, but she made it so\r\nvivid to me before we left that evening that I felt as though I had\r\nbeen born here.\r\n\r\n“We must visit all the houses in the neighborhood and buy what\r\nfurniture we can right here,” she said. “Maybe there’ll be an auction.\r\nCountry people are always selling off their old stuff so we must keep\r\nour eyes open.”\r\n\r\n“I should think it would be a lot simpler to buy what we want in town\r\nand be done with it,” I said.\r\n\r\n“But we don’t want to be done with it, Billy,” she answered. “We can’t\r\ncome slam bang into an old house like this. We must grow into it.”\r\n\r\nShe was so happy that I didn’t say anything more. I knew that she\r\nwas right, whatever I thought. I’d trust Ruth’s instinct against my\r\njudgment any time.\r\n\r\nI found that I could secure some fifty acres around the house and this\r\nwas what pleased me. The lot included woodland, pasture and field, but\r\nmostly pasture grown up to alders and scrub pine. But however poor the\r\nland was, it was land, and that was what I was hungry for. I wanted to\r\nlook out the windows and see land and walk over it and feel it beneath\r\nmy feet, knowing I owned it. I wanted to feel that I had a certain\r\nsection of these United States of America which belonged to me and my\r\nheirs forever and ever. To have this would seem like being taken into\r\nthe firm.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to look up the deeds I felt this more keenly than ever. I\r\nwas able to trace the title back to an old Indian grant, for it had\r\nbeen held in one family over two hundred years and had changed title\r\nonly twice since then. This in itself brought history mighty close.\r\n\r\nI bought the land and house for twenty-eight hundred dollars--the house\r\nbeing practically thrown in. Because it was lop-sided and old and in\r\nneed of repair it had no market value whatever. A flimsily built modern\r\nbungalow would have brought more. And yet when I examined the timbers\r\nI found them of oak, handhewn, and sound as a nut. The underpinning\r\nwas made of great granite slabs and was as good as the day it was put\r\nin, though it had worked askew from the frost. Even the floors, though\r\nuneven and needing propping, were sound. The roof boards and shingles\r\nhad of course rotted, but here again the timbers supporting them had\r\nwith time only become seasoned. When our great grandfathers built\r\nhouses they didn’t build for decades but for centuries. They didn’t\r\nreckon the cost of the lumber. In a cottage they used beams big enough\r\nto support a church, matched them true and fastened them with hand-made\r\nspikes a foot long. I couldn’t have bought the lumber alone for what\r\nI paid for the house. I couldn’t have bought it anyway. You can’t buy\r\nsuch timber as that any more.\r\n\r\nI started work upon it at once, because we wanted to get in as soon\r\nas possible. From the moment I paid the first installment--I bought\r\nit on time as a matter of convenience--we felt this to be our home. I\r\ncouldn’t spare any of my own men just then and felt anyway that as far\r\nas possible I ought to use local labor, so after considerable effort I\r\nrounded up three men to help me.\r\n\r\nI came to know these fellows better later on, but at the start they\r\nwere almost as foreign to me as though they had come from another\r\ncountry. One of them was a man of fifty, another a man of forty and\r\nthe third was a young chap not more than twenty-two or three. I’ll\r\ncall the oldest one Hadley--though that wasn’t his name. The last name\r\ndoesn’t count for much anyway, because at the end of the week I was\r\ncalling him Jim and he was calling me Bill. In less than two weeks the\r\nchildren who used to come over to watch us were calling me Bill.\r\n\r\nSeth Sprague and Josh Chase will do as names for the other two and\r\ncome pretty close to what their names really were. Josh was the young\r\nfellow--a tall, bony lad with shoulders already well rounded, and in\r\nmany other ways looking as old as Seth, who might have been his father.\r\n\r\nAll three of them had been born in the neighborhood and had lived here\r\never since. All three of them came from old New England stock and had\r\ninherited small farms from their fathers. And I must say that their\r\npersonal appearance was no great credit to that stock. This impressed\r\nme right off. Not only were their bodies undersized and spare but their\r\nfaces were thin and sallow. They didn’t look healthy. They didn’t look\r\nas healthy as the average emigrant. And yet they had been living in\r\nthe country all their lives with out-of-door work in this fine air\r\nfor a tonic and with country food to nourish them. They didn’t look\r\ndissipated--just scrawny and underfed. If I had met one of them in the\r\nslums I would have said he was a case for the associated charities. I\r\ndoubt if Seth could have got past the emigration officials. The first\r\ntime they opened their dinner pails, however, I saw that I had missed my\r\nguess about their being starved. I never saw any three human beings get\r\noutside of as much food as they did. Three or four eggs, half a loaf\r\nof bread, a big slab of pie and two or three doughnuts to a pail, was\r\ntheir average lunch. They saw my surprise and Jim told a story fixing\r\nit on Seth, though I suspect it was an old one round the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHe said that Seth happened into the grocery one day just after a\r\ndrummer had opened a large tin of canned beef. The drummer took off a\r\nslice which he ate with some crackers, and then shoved the can along to\r\nSeth with the invitation to join him. Seth took out his pocket knife\r\nand began. He finished that pound can with the rest of the crackers and\r\nallowing that this sort of whetted his appetite ordered a second can.\r\nWhen he finished this the drummer who had been watching in amazement\r\nsaid, “Don’t quit now; have another.” Seth replied that he didn’t mind\r\nif he did and ate the contents of the third can. Then closing his knife\r\nand running the back of his hand across his mouth, he gave a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction. “My,” he said, “but that was a juicy morsel.”\r\n\r\nThis started a yarn from Seth and he fixed his on Jim. They were full\r\nof these stories and would stop work a dozen times a day to drawl them\r\nout. Seth said that a man who lived on the edge of the town had a wife\r\nwho was a mighty good cook. One spring she planned to go away for a\r\nweek and visit some relatives but before going she cooked up enough\r\nfood to last her husband a week. He was a hearty eater, so she spent\r\nthree or four days at the task. When it came time for supper, the\r\nfirst day she left, the man felt so lonesome that he went out of the\r\nhouse and looked for someone to join him. He met Jim and asked him in.\r\nJim said that he had just had supper and wasn’t feeling particularly\r\nhungry, but that he would join in a cup of tea just to be sociable. He\r\nsat down at the table and ate up a two quart pot of beans and the man\r\nbrought on a second pot. Jim ate that too. Then the man brought out a\r\npie and Jim ate that. A second one followed, and to cut a long story\r\nshort, Jim before he finished ate up every single thing there was in\r\nthe house. His host didn’t say anything until Jim rose from the table.\r\n“Well,” said his host, “I’m glad you didn’t come along when you were\r\nhungry.”\r\n\r\nI had more trouble handling those three men than I’ve ever had with a\r\ngang of a hundred foreign laborers. They didn’t know enough to do the\r\nwork properly by themselves and they knew too much to obey orders. When\r\nit came to straightening up the underpinning I let them go ahead for a\r\nwhile on their own responsibility. This was a simple task which three\r\nmen with crow bars ought to have done in half a day. At the end of the\r\nfirst half day they had succeeded in harmonizing their various opinions\r\nas to how it ought to be done to the point where they determined they\r\nneeded a jack screw. One of them went off to borrow this and when he\r\nreturned it was lunch time. Then I took hold and it was only by doing\r\nmost of the work myself that we finished this job in two days. I used\r\nthem to help only where I needed more muscle and at that the three\r\ntogether couldn’t lift as much as one of my stocky, close-knit Italian\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\nI found it impossible either to lead or drive them. My attempts\r\nresulted in nothing but longwinded arguments or sulky threats of\r\nleaving. And I was paying them a dollar and seventy-five cents a day\r\nfor unskilled labor. They were both lazy and incompetent. That’s the\r\nfrank truth.\r\n\r\nI kept them along until the fourth day, which was cloudy with at times\r\na light drizzling rain. I had got up at four o’clock in order to be\r\nat the house on time, for I was anxious to get this outside work done\r\nas soon as possible. At seven o’clock not one of the men had put in\r\nan appearance. I waited until half past eight and then went off to\r\nsee what the trouble was. I found Seth at home smoking a pipe by the\r\nside of the kitchen stove. His wife was a pleasant faced woman and\r\nthe inside of the house was as neat as wax--in marked contrast to the\r\nclutter around the outside.\r\n\r\n“What’s the trouble?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Dunno of any trouble,” he answered as though surprised by my question.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been down to the house over an hour waiting for you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“What for?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you going to work any more?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t expect a man to work in the rain, do you?” he answered.\r\n\r\n“I guess it’s too much to expect work of you in any sort of weather,” I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nI paid him for his four days and left him growling uncomplimentary\r\nremarks about me to his wife. I received the same reply from Jim. I\r\npaid him off too and went on in search of young Chase. I thought the\r\nboy and I together might be able to clear up some of the odd jobs. He\r\nwasn’t at home. His mother thought he might be at the grocery store. I\r\nwent down there and found him lolling against the counter.\r\n\r\n“You aren’t afraid of rain too, are you?” I demanded. There were three\r\nother men there and he looked ashamed.\r\n\r\n“It’s my rheumatiz,” he answered, feeling of his leg. “It’s botherin’\r\nme a powerful lot to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Then you refuse to come to work?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to accommodate ye,” he answered. “But honest--”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want you to accommodate me,” I said. “I want you to work for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHe straightened up a little at this and answered back. “I won’t work in\r\nthe rain for no man.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced toward the others and I saw them nod their approval. This\r\nstand was more than I had expected of him. It showed that he had some\r\nspirit of a certain kind after all.\r\n\r\n“All right,” I said. “Here’s your money.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was leaving, he roused himself once more. “I reckon what you\r\nwant mister ain’t a man--it’s a Dago.”\r\n\r\n“You’re partly right,” I said; “I reckon what I want is a Dago.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMY NEIGHBORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was my first introduction to the old-stock farmer of whom I was to\r\nlearn much more later on. Of course in a real sense these men were not\r\nfarmers, and yet they were farmers or nothing. They had been born on a\r\nfarm, had spent their lives there, and still depended upon the land for\r\nwhatever means of livelihood they had. They were willing to work out\r\nas a matter of accommodation or to pick up an extra dollar or so, but\r\nthey certainly did not class themselves as laborers. I could agree with\r\nthem in that, but neither to my mind were they real farmers; not as I\r\nconceived farmers to be from what my father had told me and from what I\r\nread in the magazines.\r\n\r\nI don’t suppose my ideal differed much from that of the average city\r\nbred man who has never had the good fortune to spend even his vacation\r\nin the country. Perhaps I was a little more visionary about them than\r\nsome, because my life in the foreign quarter had roused my patriotism\r\nand driven me back into history for comfort. From that source I had\r\ncreated in my mind as representative a tall, gaunt individual of\r\nthe Lincoln type with all Lincoln’s ruggedness of body and brain. I\r\npictured him as honest to his very soul, as industrious to an extreme,\r\nas shrewd and thrifty, as brave and long suffering. So I still\r\nbelieve the old New Englander to have been; so I believe many of them\r\nare to-day. Perhaps I was unfortunate in finding at the very start\r\nthree who did not live up to my standard, but I want to put down my\r\nexperiences just as they came to me. If there were no more like these\r\nin the length and breadth of the whole land, here at least were three.\r\nAnd they were of the genuine old stock, uncontaminated by a single drop\r\nof new blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI received from people who read “One Way Out” much criticism to the\r\neffect that the experiences which befell me were not typical; that the\r\nconditions which I encountered would not hold in other places. Perhaps\r\nthat is true. I don’t know. As I tried to make clear before, I’m not\r\nan investigator, nor a sociologist, nor a writer of tracts. I don’t\r\nclaim to know any more than I have seen with my own eyes--than I have\r\nactually lived through. But I still believe that conditions, whatever\r\nthey are, don’t matter if a man tackles them in the right spirit. I\r\nbelieve that, because I see every day men starting even and one failing\r\nand one succeeding.\r\n\r\nWhat I said in “One Way Out” I want to repeat here: I’m authority on\r\nnothing but myself. Just as Ruth and I, driven on by circumstances,\r\nwent adventuring in the slums, so driven on by other if not such urgent\r\ncircumstances we went adventuring in the country. And I approached my\r\nnew and later life in a state of just as much absolute ignorance as\r\nI did the first. It was chance that led me to locate where I did, it\r\nwas chance which furnished me with my neighbors; it was chance which\r\nfurnished me with my opportunity. If this led me into an unexplored\r\ncountry and along paths never before trod by man, I thank my lucky\r\nstars. I don’t believe it, but I’m willing to let it go at that. I’m\r\nnot much on argument.\r\n\r\nThis then is a plain statement of what I saw with my new eyes--the eyes\r\nof an immigrant into the country. It is a plain statement of what I\r\ndid and what I learned and the people I met. I don’t claim that it’s\r\neither typical or important. The life of one man isn’t apt to be. Here\r\nit is, however, without any further explanation or apology, for what\r\nit’s worth, and if anyone gets as much fun out of reading it as I have\r\nhad in living it, I won’t consider I’ve wasted my time in writing it.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to act at once on Seth’s idea. I remembered having seen,\r\nback on the road, a little place which at the time I had thought looked\r\nlike the home of some foreign-born pioneer. It bore all the earmarks;\r\nit was an unkempt but busy looking place. There were evidences of many\r\nchildren and a consequent clutter of tin cans, broken bottles and old\r\nshoes, but I saw no farming tools and broken down wagons in the yard.\r\nThese things were all under cover in the shed. I noticed too that the\r\nyard was full of chickens and that every square foot of land around the\r\nhouse was being tilled. When I knocked at the door a woman appeared\r\nwith a child in her arms and with half a dozen more clinging to her\r\nskirts. She was a red-cheeked, black-eyed woman, as plump and happy\r\nlooking as you would ask to see. Somehow I felt instantly at home\r\nhere. I surprised her by asking in Italian where her man was, and she\r\nanswered that he was out back of the barn and bade one of the boys to\r\nrun and fetch him for the signor. I said no, that I would go and find\r\nhim myself. She protested that the signor would get wet and that he had\r\nbetter come in and wait. I felt half ashamed that she should class me\r\nwith that sort of coddled signor and hurried off to find Tony.\r\n\r\nI found him in an old hat and gray sweater, up to his knees in the\r\nblack soil. He was a swarthy, well-muscled chap, with a face tanned to\r\nthe color of sole leather. He looked like a villain of melodrama, but\r\nas I approached he smiled a greeting which revealed teeth as naturally\r\nwhite as a hound’s. A couple of mongrel pups were nosing at his heels\r\nand ran at me ferociously, but stopped half way and wagged their tails.\r\nWith an oath in Italian he ordered them back and belly to the ground\r\nthey obeyed him.\r\n\r\nI introduced myself and he recognized my name at once for the fame of\r\nCarleton’s gang had by now spread far.\r\n\r\n“I have two cousins working for you,” he said in a manner that made me\r\nfeel it a compliment.\r\n\r\nHe told me their names and I remembered them well. They were good\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n“I’ve bought a house near you,” I said. “I need a man or two to help\r\nme. Do you want a job?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, signor,” he replied with a shake of his head in apology, “if I did\r\nnot have so much to do here.”\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand over the scant two acres of land back of him as\r\nthough it were a principality.\r\n\r\n“This is all yours?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered proudly. “This--the house--everything.”\r\n\r\n“You are doing well then.”\r\n\r\n“Well enough,” he answered with a shrug of his shoulders and a smile.\r\n\r\n“Then I can’t hire you?”\r\n\r\n“It would be impossible, signor,” he answered, as though some\r\napology were due me. “The planting is not yet done. And--by the good\r\nChrist--there are a thousand things to do on an estate.”\r\n\r\nIt was good to hear the way he pronounced that word estate. There was\r\nenough dignity in it to make it seem in sober earnest like an estate.\r\n\r\n“Do you know of anyone I can get?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“There is Signor Chase,” he began.\r\n\r\nBut I shut him off. “Any of your countrymen, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“There is Dardoni; he might have a man. But no--not in the spring.\r\nThere are my wife’s cousins. They have just come over. I could send--”\r\n\r\n“No,” I interrupted, “I can get men enough in the city.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you, signor,” he answered with a bow.\r\n\r\nI started to leave when rather hesitatingly he asked if I wouldn’t be\r\ngood enough to step into the house and have a glass of wine with him.\r\nHe had so interested me and what he said had so whetted my curiosity\r\nthat I gladly accepted. He preceded me to the house and at the door\r\ncalled loudly for Maria. She came with her cheeks redder than ever and\r\nwith the children clinging about her skirts, ushered us into the living\r\nroom. There was no such neatness here as I had seen in the Sprague\r\nhouse. All was confusion; a mixture of sewing and play things and\r\ngarlic-flavored cooking. What can one do with six children to feed and\r\nclothe? Maria made no apologies. This was home and home to her was a\r\nplant for the rearing of children. We seated ourselves at a bare wooden\r\ntable and she brought out a bottle of red wine as light as new cider. I\r\ndrank good health to Maria and success to Tony.\r\n\r\nI asked him many questions out of honest interest and he answered me\r\nfrankly and with eagerness as your true pioneer ever does because of\r\npride in his accomplishments. He told me that he had come here three\r\nyears ago to work for Dardoni who had a grand estate--ten times as\r\nlarge as his--on the other side of the town. He had saved a little\r\nmoney before he came and with that, and what he earned later, he had\r\nbought these few acres of his own. Since then he had earned his living\r\nand something over. The thing that impressed me at the time, but the\r\nfull significance of which I did not realize until later, was that he\r\nfound a market for his eggs and produce right here in the village. Some\r\nof it he exchanged at the store for groceries but much of it he sold\r\nfrom door to door. It sounded like carrying coals to Newcastle.\r\n\r\nI passed a pleasant hour with Tony and then went back to my house where\r\nI puttered around the rest of the day doing odd jobs. When I came home\r\nthat night and told my experiences to Ruth she only laughed to herself\r\nand made no comment. I told her I was going to take four or five of my\r\nown men out there next day and she said she guessed I would save time\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nFrom that point on, the work went along swimmingly. After getting all\r\nthe buildings straightened up I brought down a couple of carpenters to\r\ndo the shingling. At different times Seth and Jim and Josh came along\r\nto watch proceedings. They bore no ill will and offered me plenty of\r\nadvice. At first I resented this, but after a while I learned not to\r\nmind. I couldn’t help liking the men after a fashion and I enjoyed\r\ntheir stories. They took as paternal an interest in my affairs as\r\nthough I were a tenant and they were landlords. They were like children\r\nin the intimate questions they asked, but I found that they were not at\r\nall disturbed if they received no replies.\r\n\r\nAfter the shingling I began on the plastering. I knocked down the old\r\nplastering in every room and found that the lathing was all of the old\r\nsplit-board kind. This really made a stronger and firmer background\r\nthan the modern lathing. I made another find; two fireplaces which had\r\nbeen bricked up to accommodate air-tight stoves. I was mighty well\r\npleased with this because I’m fond of fireplaces and had wondered how I\r\nwas going to build one without tearing the house half to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we did was to putty up the holes and cracks and paint\r\nevery speck of wood inside and out a dead white. Ruth insisted on white.\r\n\r\n“Somehow I wouldn’t feel I was living in the country if my house wasn’t\r\nwhite,” she said.\r\n\r\nI agreed with her, for to my mind there’s no color so fresh and bright\r\nlooking. And the very first coat brought the old house to life. It’s\r\nwonderful what paint will do. It didn’t make the house look new in the\r\nsense of making it appear like a house of to-day, but rather carried it\r\nback to its youth. It was like making an old man young again. We could\r\nhardly wait for the paint to dry before starting the second coat, and\r\nthat carried us back another twenty-five years. Even Seth, who at the\r\nstart had allowed that the old shack wasn’t worth repairing, admitted\r\nnow that it began to look real nifty.\r\n\r\nAnd the inside looked as fine as the outside. When we began, the\r\nwoodwork was discolored both by age and dirt. This made the whole\r\ninterior look worse than a cheap tenement. Twenty dollars’ worth of\r\nwhite lead and oil changed this as though by magic into a clean white,\r\nas fresh as when the house was first built. There is nothing which\r\nshows age more than paint and there’s nothing so easily remedied. If\r\nthe owners had done what I had already done they would have made almost\r\nthree hundred per cent. interest on their investment. In three weeks,\r\nat a cost of four hundred dollars, I had added fifteen hundred in value\r\nto the place. And it was a legitimate value. My paint hadn’t covered up\r\ndefects; it had simply brought out the honest worth of the structure.\r\n\r\nWith the floors painted and the windows drawn, we were now ready for\r\nthe personal details which should make this house into a home. It was\r\nthen that we had a great stroke of luck in hearing of an auction in\r\nanother village some eight miles away and off the main road. Seth told\r\nus about it and said if I was looking for old trash he reckoned I could\r\nfind enough of it there. He said he wouldn’t give a quarter for the\r\nwhole lot, which didn’t sound very encouraging. But Ruth said she had\r\nheard them talk like that before, and anyway it would be good fun to go.\r\n\r\nOne clear summer morning then we rose early and Ruth put up a lunch\r\nand we boarded the train. The nearest station was five miles away and\r\nthere we hired an old white horse and a buggy. We jogged along over\r\nthe country roads at a three-mile-an-hour clip and reached the place\r\njust before the auction started at ten o’clock. We found some thirty or\r\nforty natives there. Most of them had come just to look on. They always\r\nhad time for that. Even in the busiest season it was as easy to gather\r\na crowd in these out-of-the-way places as it is during the noon hour on\r\nBroadway. And they wouldn’t come for an hour, but for all day.\r\n\r\nWe found rather a romantic story in connection with this auction. The\r\nstory ran, and I guess it was true, that the man who had been living\r\nhere as a bachelor for forty years had originally built and furnished\r\nthis house for his bride. Just before they were to be married she had\r\ndied and he had moved into the house and lived here by himself until\r\nhis own death.\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth heard that, she said to me, “Billy, do you know I think he’d\r\nbe glad for us to have his things.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how he’d feel about me, but I’m dead sure he’d be glad\r\nfor you to have them,” I said.\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t if it wasn’t for you,” she answered, with a smile.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying she was right in this deduction but I made up my mind\r\nshe’d have whatever she liked at that auction if it broke me.\r\n\r\nThere’s a lot in luck at auctions--for the buyer. And we were certainly\r\nin luck that day. There were no stray automobile parties in the group\r\nto boost things up for the fun of it, and no professional furniture\r\nbuyers. It was a real country auction with a country auctioneer and\r\na country crowd. Seth and Jim and Josh were there and the rest of\r\nthe group was all of their kind. Both the men and the women looked\r\nbloodless and withered. It showed in their faded eyes, in their sallow\r\ncheeks, in their spare bodies. They seemed old and tired--even the\r\nyoung women. And the strange thing about it was that to me they looked\r\nlike foreigners. I felt as though I had come into some distant country\r\namong a new people. I couldn’t seem to connect them with America; even\r\nwith the America of history. It took an effort on my part to remember\r\nthat the names they bore were the names borne by many of those who\r\nsettled in Plymouth.\r\n\r\nI asked Ruth if she felt that way and after thinking a moment she\r\nanswered, “Not as much as you do.”\r\n\r\nStill I saw she knew there was something wrong with them because she\r\nkept looking at the women with almost a sad expression. Once, she said,\r\n“There’s something to do here, Billy.”\r\n\r\n“Missionary work?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“But this isn’t Africa,” I laughed. “This is the United States of\r\nAmerica. It’s a fact and we mustn’t forget it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “that is just what we must remember.”\r\n\r\n“And most of these people are descendants of the Mayflower. They are\r\nrelatives of ours.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said soberly, “we must remember that, too.”\r\n\r\nBut the auctioneer was begging our kind attention to examine a\r\ncollection of extremely useful articles which he announced he was going\r\nto include in a single parcel. Into an old tin pan he counted one by\r\none a rusty egg beater, two iron spoons, a kitchen knife, three glass\r\npreserve jars, a doughnut cutter, a crockery door knob and finally a\r\ndozen ordinary tin coffee cans. Then with his hands on his hips he\r\nstood back and beamed with pride upon the collection.\r\n\r\n“How much for the lot!” he demanded.\r\n\r\nHe himself looked like one of the odds and ends he was selling. Though\r\nnot over thirty-five he was round shouldered and dyspeptic. He wore\r\nglasses and though smooth shaven his beard still showed. His clothes\r\nhung loosely about his spare frame and he seemed to be always in pain.\r\n\r\nThe bids started at two cents and quickly went to five, while the crowd\r\nlaughed good naturedly.\r\n\r\nI gained a better impression of the auctioneer right off by the\r\nearnest, sober way he went at his business. He had a trick of leaning\r\nover the crowd with his long bony finger outstretched and calling\r\nearnestly, “Once, twice--” with a little pause there which made you\r\nfeel as though you were missing a great opportunity.\r\n\r\n“Twice,” he repeated, and in the excitement of the moment I was on the\r\npoint of bidding six when he brought both hands together with the\r\ndecisiveness of a decree of Fate and I escaped.\r\n\r\nRuth had detected my temptation and pulled at my sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Billy,” she warned, “you mustn’t bid on anything except\r\nwhat we really want.”\r\n\r\n“Think of all those things going for five cents,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“And when the man gets home with them he’ll wonder why he ever bid\r\ntwo,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer disposed of the culch first and always found a bidder\r\nif only for a worthless basket filled with broken bottles. And there\r\nwasn’t a man who bought those things who didn’t have his wood shed\r\ncluttered up with similar waste.\r\n\r\nFinally he came to six wooden kitchen chairs. They were painted yellow\r\nand had seats three inches thick. They were hand made and fastened\r\ntogether with wooden pegs instead of nails and were as stout as when\r\nfirst built. Ruth had picked these out at once.\r\n\r\n“I’d better start them at a quarter,” I said.\r\n\r\n“No,” she whispered, “you keep quiet. Let me do the bidding.”\r\n\r\n“How much a piece for the lot?” inquired the auctioneer.\r\n\r\nThe man who had the adjoining farm started them at two cents.\r\n\r\n“Why you’d pay more than that for kindling wood,” exclaimed the\r\nauctioneer. “But two I’m offered. Will anyone make it three?”\r\n\r\nI nudged Ruth but she didn’t open her mouth.\r\n\r\n“Three,” called someone.\r\n\r\n“Three I’m offered, who’ll make it four?”\r\n\r\nNo one answered.\r\n\r\n“Three I’m offered, once,--”\r\n\r\nI nudged Ruth again but she remained as though dumb. I was standing on\r\ntiptoe.\r\n\r\n“Three I’m offered; twice. Going, going--”\r\n\r\nI was all out of breath when Ruth spoke up as cool as you please,\r\n“Four.”\r\n\r\n“Four I’m offered.”\r\n\r\nHe extended his finger towards the first bidder.\r\n\r\n“Now make it five,” the auctioneer coaxed.\r\n\r\nThe man shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Make it a half.”\r\n\r\nAgain the man shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I’m offered four cents a piece for these fine hardwood chairs. Make\r\nit a half. Make it a quarter. Going--going--”\r\n\r\nHe paused again with an eager tantalizing smile. Then he brought his\r\nhands together.\r\n\r\n“And sold to Mr.--”\r\n\r\n“Carleton,” I answered quickly.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” gasped Ruth. “They are ours!”\r\n\r\nWe bought another lot of eight at twelve cents a piece. We bought\r\na third lot, cane seated and painted a handsome black, for nine\r\ncents. Besides this we bought a mahogany veneered bureau with old\r\nbrass handles, in perfect condition, for four dollars and a quarter.\r\nI learned later that it was worth at least twenty-five dollars. We\r\nbought a grandfather’s clock with pine case and wooden works, made in\r\nWinchester, England, for thirteen dollars and a half. We bought a solid\r\nmahogany four-poster bed for twenty-two dollars. We bought a hardwood\r\nkitchen table for two dollars. We bought three feather beds at a dollar\r\nand a half a piece--the goose feathers alone in each being worth five\r\nor six dollars. We bought a set of black and white ware consisting of\r\na tea pot, sugar bowl, milk pitcher, and nine cups and saucers, in\r\nperfect condition, for five dollars--less than you’d pay for ordinary\r\ncrockery. We bought a mahogany veneered kitchen clock for two dollars.\r\nWe bought a bird’s eye maple, rope bed for four dollars. In addition to\r\nthis we bought beautiful old bed spreads and rag rugs and mirrors--all\r\nfor a song. In fact, we took about everything in the house that was\r\nof any value and paid less than ten cents on a dollar for what it was\r\nworth merely as furniture, and less than two cents for what most of it\r\nshould have brought as antiques.\r\n\r\nI accomplished two things that day; I furnished my house for a song\r\nand I introduced myself to my future neighbors, for my reckless buying\r\nbecame the gossip of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCOLD FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of August when we moved into our new home, and on the\r\nsecond Saturday following we gave a house warming. When we left our\r\ntenement we told our friends that instead of saying good-by to them\r\nthere we meant to say howdy at the new home. And so this party was\r\nprincipally for them, although through the local paper we sent out a\r\ngeneral invitation to everyone in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe swept up the barn floor and set a long table there, improvised out\r\nof boards and saw horses. Ruth decorated it with green and with wild\r\nflowers. We served cold meats, bread and butter, ice cream and cake,\r\ncoffee and milk, to some seventy-five grown-ups and Lord knows how many\r\nchildren. The latter made the whole country-side spring to life as\r\nthough by magic. If a happier, more enthusiastic group than our former\r\nneighbors ever gathered together under one roof I’d like to see them.\r\nRuth, Dick, and myself acted as waiters, with plenty of assistance from\r\neveryone, and saw to it that all had as much as they could eat.\r\n\r\nThe village people came more out of curiosity than anything else, I\r\nimagine. Ed Barclay, the auctioneer, was there and I liked him even\r\nbetter than at first on further acquaintance. Seth, Josh and Jim turned\r\nup in spite of their aversion to Dagoes. Then the Reverend Percy\r\nCunningham, pastor of the Methodist Church, came with his wife. He\r\nwas a slight, very serious man, dressed in black like an undertaker.\r\nDeacon Weston, said to be the richest man in town, also dropped in for\r\na minute and bade me welcome. He had a thin, hard face that hinted as\r\nto how he had acquired his wealth, and later I found out that my guess\r\nwas sound. Horatio Moulton, who kept the village store, was another who\r\nstopped to shake hands.\r\n\r\nBut the fellow out of the whole lot who interested me most was Giuseppe\r\nDardoni, the landed proprietor of whom Tony had spoken to me. In spite\r\nof the fact that financially he was one of the strongest men in town\r\nhe was never called anything but Joe--not so much in a spirit of good\r\nfellowship as with the easy familiarity people speak to a Chinaman or a\r\nno-account Indian. He never resented the slight openly, but I had long\r\nsince learned that these people appreciate being given the dignity of\r\ntheir full name.\r\n\r\nSignor Dardoni was a man of forty-five, I should judge. He was slight\r\nand wiry of build, with a kindly face and smiling eyes. His hair was\r\nturning gray and he was extremely courteous and gentle mannered.\r\nNeither in dress nor speech did he betray the fact that he was any more\r\nprosperous than most of his fellow citizens. I noticed, however, that he\r\ndrove up with his daughter behind a very good horse and in a well-kept\r\nsulky. He greeted everyone with a good-natured smile, and Seth who\r\nhappened to be standing near introduced us.\r\n\r\n“Joe,” he said, “let me make ye ’quainted with Bill Carleton who’s\r\nfiggerin’ on settlin’ here.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard much of you,” I said to him, speaking in Italian, to Seth’s\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n“And I have heard much of Signor Carleton. But you have traveled in\r\nItaly?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “in Little Italy.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed at that and I took him to meet Ruth. Later we adjourned into\r\nthe house where, over a bottle of smuggled Italian wine, which one of\r\nthe boys had given me, I learned more about him. We passed a pleasant\r\nhalf hour and when he left I told him that I wanted to come over and\r\nvisit him.\r\n\r\n“I want to see how you manage your farm,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I shall be honored,” he said with the sincere but exaggerated\r\npoliteness of his race. “But it is not much, just a few acres.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until midnight that the last of our guests left, for\r\nPelletti, who had brought along his fiddle, furnished music for a\r\ndance. It would have done your heart good to watch those people\r\ndance--especially the girls. The fiddle seemed to become part of them.\r\nBefore we knew it Ruth and I were on the floor and Dick had seized\r\nLucia, Dardoni’s oldest daughter, and followed at our heels.\r\n\r\nIt was right after this that I began to plan the development of my\r\nfarm. It was of course much too late in the season for me to attempt\r\nto plant anything. However, there were many other things about the\r\nplace that needed attention. I hired Hadley by the month to help me\r\nand started in at once clearing up generally. I had him repair the\r\nwalls and fences, cut bushes, trim the trees, and do the chores around\r\nthe house. I bought a cow for the sake of having our own milk for the\r\nkiddies, and so he also had her to look after. I paid him forty dollars\r\na month and it was all he was worth. Dick and I used to do as much\r\nevery Saturday afternoon as he did through the week.\r\n\r\nI made one other investment this season; I bought a second-hand\r\nautomobile. This made me independent of trains and allowed me many an\r\nodd hour at home which otherwise I would have lost. I could make the\r\nrun from my office to the house in thirty-five minutes, but the thing\r\ncost me first and last a good deal of money. It didn’t take me a month\r\nto learn that anyone who figures on saving car fare with one of them\r\nmakes a mistake. However, I figured that we would save enough in other\r\nways to make up for this added expense. Here again I soon learned I was\r\nmistaken, and that brought me face to face with a new revelation which\r\nknocked sky high some of my preconceived notions. We found when we came\r\nto settle our first month’s store bill that it was costing as much\r\nand in some cases more for our food stuffs than it had cost in the\r\ncity. When Ruth came to me with the bills and I looked them over I was\r\nastonished to find that the prices even for eggs and butter were those\r\ncurrent in town; that such staples as sugar and flour and lard were\r\nif anything a little higher and that for vegetables we were actually\r\npaying more than we did at the city market when Ruth was doing her own\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “what do you make out of this?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand about the butter and eggs,” she said, “but of\r\ncourse I don’t have the chance here that I used to have to get cut\r\nprices on the other things.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” I said, “but these men don’t have to pay high rents or an\r\nexpensive staff of clerks. They don’t even advertise. It looks to me\r\nas though our friend Moulton was taking advantage of us. Probably he\r\nthinks we’re city folks and don’t care what we pay.”\r\n\r\nThis was in September and there wasn’t an item on our bill that did not\r\nequal or exceed town prices for the best. Taking into account the fact\r\nthat, as Ruth said, there were no bargain sales, it is easy to see that\r\nwhere we had looked for a reduction in living expenses we had really\r\nmet with a substantial increase. Not only this, but in most cases the\r\ngoods we received were inferior to those we secured in town. As for\r\nmeats, the prices charged were exorbitant.\r\n\r\nNow neither Ruth nor I had reached, or ever will I trust, a point where\r\nwe didn’t care how much we were paying. The lesson of the ginger jar\r\nwas too firmly implanted for us to accept without a question, as we\r\ndid when we were living in the suburbs, whatever we might be charged.\r\nBut aside from this I was genuinely interested in the economic side\r\nof the matter. I wanted to know how this condition of things happened\r\nto exist. It looked to me on the face of it as though there was\r\nsomething wrong in having to pay as much in the country for butter,\r\neggs, vegetables and poultry as we had to pay in the city. So I went\r\ndown to the village and had an interview with my fat friend Moulton. He\r\nwelcomed me cordially and listened to my questions with a smile.\r\n\r\n“I’m not kicking on your making a fair profit,” I told him, “but I\r\nsimply can’t figure out why it’s necessary for you to charge so much in\r\norder to do it. If you can show me, I’ll trade with you; if you can’t\r\nI’m going to trade in town after this.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” he nodded, “I hear your kick every year from summer\r\nfolks. They come up here to save money and go away sore because they\r\ndon’t.”\r\n\r\n“But why don’t they?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“’Cause I have to make a profit in order to live,” he answered. “Now\r\nlook a-here, I ain’t so big a corporation that I have to hide my books\r\nto steer clear of an investigation from Congress. If you’ve got a spare\r\nhour I’ll show you some things that city folks don’t reckon on.”\r\n\r\nAnd he did. I’ll give him credit for making the whole business clear\r\nto me in less than an hour. He opened my eyes to a few facts that I’ve\r\nnever seen mentioned in any fairy dreams about the simple life that\r\nI’ve ever read. And what is more they were cold facts that don’t seem\r\nto get into even the heavier treatises on New England life.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he proved to me with his books, that he bought not\r\nonly his staples from the city market, but even his produce.\r\n\r\n“I can’t buy a pound of decent butter here,” he said. “The farmer’s\r\nbutter you hear so much about isn’t made any more; what little is made\r\nis loaded down with salt to a point where you couldn’t pay ’em twenty\r\ncents a pound for it. I can’t buy a decent chicken. All they bring in\r\nhere are the old fowls that you couldn’t cut up with a broad ax.”\r\n\r\n“What do they do with their chickens?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“They don’t raise many to start with.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Too lazy for one thing, and then they say they have to pay too much\r\nfor corn.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t they raise their own corn?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask me,” he answered. “The fact is they buy western corn for all\r\ntheir stock.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t corn grow here?”\r\n\r\n“I reckon it would grow if they planted it,” he answered. “Seems t’ me\r\nI recollect something about the Injuns growing it. But I guess that\r\nmaybe the Injuns didn’t have to plant theirs. Maybe it just growed. I\r\ns’pose it’s hard work to plant corn and hoe it.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed to himself at a story this suggested. All these people had\r\nLincoln’s gift of pointing a fact with a story.\r\n\r\n“They tell about Josh Whiting who lived in that old house down to the\r\nlower end of the village where Horatio Sampson lives now. Josh was so\r\nall-fired lazy that he wouldn’t do no work at all and like to starved\r\nto death. So the neighbors after feeding him for a while allowed\r\nthat so long as he warn’t no good he might just as well be buried.\r\nA committee of ’em went down to his house one day and took him out\r\nand put him in a hearse and started for the graveyard. When they were\r\nnighing the gate a stranger came along and inquired what was up. They\r\ntold him and it seemed to him like such hard lines that he offered to\r\ndo something.\r\n\r\n“‘I’ll give the corpse a bag of corn anyhow,’ says he.\r\n\r\n“‘All right,’ they says.\r\n\r\n“So he went to the hearse and opened the door and looked in.\r\n\r\n“‘I can’t see a man die for lack of food,’ says he. ‘So I’ll give ye a\r\nbag of corn.’\r\n\r\n“Josh, he hitched up on one elbow to see who was speakin’. ‘Is it\r\nshelled?’ says he.\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ answered the fellow. ‘But it won’t be much trouble for you to\r\nshell it.’\r\n\r\n“Josh settled down on his back again with his hands crossed over his\r\nchest. ‘Drive on,’ he says.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, when I was through laughing, “who gets what chickens\r\nthey do raise?”\r\n\r\n“Dardoni,” he answered. “He buys them for cash and sends them to the\r\nwholesaler in town. When I want one I buy from the wholesaler.”\r\n\r\n“What about eggs?”\r\n\r\n“Same thing. They bring in a few to swap for groceries. But look at\r\n’em.”\r\n\r\nHe went to a basket and held up one about as large as a robin’s egg.\r\n\r\n“That’s the kind they bring in,” he said. “An egg is an egg and I take\r\nthem ’cause I can sell them back again. But when I want a decent egg I\r\nhave to pay the market quotation for it. They all take the papers and\r\nthey charge accordin’ to what they read there.”\r\n\r\n“But vegetables--”\r\n\r\n“They don’t raise enough for themselves--except Dardoni and a few other\r\nDagoes.”\r\n\r\n“What _do_ they raise?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Damfino,” he answered. “Measles mostly. Some rheumatiz and a fine crop\r\nof dyspeptsy. You want to know what I make more profit on than anything\r\nin my store?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to three shelves loaded with patent medicine bottles. “That\r\nstuff,” he said. “There’s fifty per cent. profit in it and I can’t keep\r\nnuff of it.”\r\n\r\n“But good Lord, you wouldn’t think that in the country--”\r\n\r\n“They live on it,” he answered; “what it says on the bottles is pretty\r\nnigh true; ‘Babies cry for it.’ Only they oughter add onto that, ‘And\r\nparents die for it.’”\r\n\r\nHe leaned over towards me and spoke in my ear. “It ain’t nothin’ but\r\ndope and whisky. The village is pretty nigh divided even on which they\r\nlike best. I’ve got a bunch of old maids that get drunk reg’lar on it\r\nand don’t know it. The meanest thing I do is to sell it to ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you cut it out?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“’Cause they’d go to the drug store and buy it there,” he said. “If\r\nthis was the only place in town where they could get it, I’d take an\r\nax handle and smash every last bottle. That’s honest. Howsomever, that\r\nain’t got anything to do with eggs, an’ then again maybe it has. P’raps\r\nit’s that stuff that makes them lazy.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to his books again.\r\n\r\n“You any idee how many of these folks I carry on credit?”\r\n\r\n“Ten per cent.,” I said for a guess.\r\n\r\n“Say seventy per cent. an’ ye’ll come nearer. Any idee how long I carry\r\nmost of the accounts?”\r\n\r\n“Six months.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll average up two years. Any idee how much of that is bad?”\r\n\r\n“Five per cent.,” I said with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Say twenty per cent. and ye wouldn’t come nigh enough even to hit the\r\ntarget.”\r\n\r\nI was curious enough to examine his books carefully and I saw that\r\nevery statement he made was true. I settled my bill without another\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how you keep in business,” I said. “You’ll have my trade\r\nfrom now on even though I could do better buying in town. I’ve come out\r\nhere to live and I believe in standing my tax, but I’ll be hanged if I\r\ncan see any reason why things should be this way.”\r\n\r\n“After you’ve lived here a year, maybe you’ll see.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe I will,” I said, “but I tell you right now that within that time\r\nI’ll be raising most of my own stuff.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“That’s what they all say. But I’d hate to pay you what that’s goneter\r\ncost you.”\r\n\r\n“What about Dardoni?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s a Dago,” answered Moulton, as though that disposed of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMoulton’s books had summed up conditions in this country town\r\nconcretely and vividly. His ledger was a tract. Five years’ residence\r\ncouldn’t have given me such a clear insight into the actual state\r\nof things as they existed here. But of course they furnished no\r\nexplanation either of the apparent degeneracy of the natives or the\r\nsuccess of the newcomers. The key to the latter I held myself, but the\r\nrevelation of the condition of the former came to me as a shock.\r\n\r\nThink of it! Here almost within sight of one of the oldest and most\r\nprosperous cities in the East lay a village of three or four hundred\r\nAmerican families, descendants of the best New England stock, in a\r\ncondition of such stagnation that they couldn’t pay their store bills.\r\nSurrounded by land which had supported their ancestors, they were\r\ndependent upon the West for their food stuffs. Born and bred in the\r\nopen air they were weak and lazy and sick. In ideal surroundings my\r\nown kith and kin were actually worse off than many of the penniless\r\nimmigrants of the slums.\r\n\r\nWhat, in God’s name, was the matter with them? I asked this of myself\r\nover and over again and that winter, as I learned still more about\r\nthem, what had at first been merely an exclamation of surprise became a\r\nprayer. What, in God’s name, was the matter with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA TOWN ASLEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this first winter Ruth and I made the most of every opportunity\r\nto get acquainted with our fellow townsmen. We went to church regularly\r\nand attended all the sociables and concerts and fairs and we met\r\nsome very fine people. But a large part of them, however, were not so\r\nrepresentative of the new generation in whom I was most interested as\r\nthey were of the old generation. I found that most of the comfortable\r\nand well-to-do were among those who had inherited small fortunes, where\r\nthe accumulations of several branches of one family had finally settled\r\nin a single individual. Much of this money I also found had been made\r\noutside the village. Then of course there was another prosperous\r\nelement consisting of a half dozen local business men who were doing\r\nwell; the hardware merchant, the druggist, the grain and hay merchant,\r\nthe local lawyers and doctors. I might have seen more of these men if\r\nI had been a member of the fraternal organizations, but somehow I never\r\ntook to them. I found that there were a half dozen branches of various\r\nsecret societies in this small village and a good many men belonged to\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nAnother significant fact was that I didn’t meet at any of these\r\ngatherings any of my foreign-born friends. I never saw Dardoni there,\r\nor Tony or any of the other dozen families who as far as enterprise and\r\nworldly success go were important members of the community. One reason\r\nwas their difference in religious belief, but another and stronger\r\nwas the fact that they were held to be on an inferior social plane.\r\nIn many ways they were. There’s no denying this, but they had, to my\r\nmind, enough sterling qualities to offset that. Anyway, I hadn’t looked\r\nto find social lines drawn in a country village, but when I expressed\r\nmy views even to Cunningham, the minister, I didn’t receive much\r\nencouragement. It made me mad to see such snobbishness in an American\r\nvillage and several times I spoke from the shoulder. After I had\r\nvisited Dardoni’s farm I felt more strongly than ever.\r\n\r\nSignor Dardoni had some forty acres and there wasn’t a square\r\nfoot which wasn’t under cultivation. Ten of them were in an apple\r\norchard--the only orchard in town that produced commercially. He had\r\ntaken native trees when they weren’t more than half alive with their\r\nclutter of dead limbs, and trimmed them up, grafted them, and made them\r\npay. That one accomplishment alone ought to have distinguished him in\r\nthe village. It ought to have set an example if nothing else. And yet\r\nI found orchard after orchard going to waste and producing nothing\r\nbut cider apples. Even these weren’t picked, and Dardoni made another\r\nneat income every fall buying them on the trees for a song and turning\r\nthem into new cider and vinegar. He had done this for five years and\r\neveryone knew that it paid and yet no one thought of following his\r\nexample and making the same use of their own waste apples. That’s a\r\nfair illustration of the difference in spirit between the two races.\r\n\r\nAnother ten or fifteen acres he kept for hay, raising enough for his\r\nown use and sometimes enough to sell. On another strip he raised his\r\nown corn and wheat for fodder, being the only man in town who didn’t\r\nspend his good money at the hay and grain store where corn went at\r\ntimes way over the dollar mark. Here again the natives had a working\r\nexample before their very eyes and yet took no advantage of it.\r\n\r\nAnother ten acres Dardoni devoted to garden truck for the near-by\r\nmarket, reaping every spring a handsome profit. There wasn’t a native\r\nin the whole village who tried even to raise more than enough for\r\nhimself and many didn’t do that even when they had back door yards big\r\nenough to supply them for the year.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his land he used for his chicken and egg business, although\r\nhe had some fifty pigs which ran loose most everywhere. Of course he\r\nalso kept cows--a half dozen of them, selling the cream to the local\r\ncreamery (which, incidentally, was not owned by local capital) and\r\nusing the buttermilk for his pigs and chickens. The pigs kept his\r\norchard in good condition and the cows and horses furnished him with\r\ndressing for his other land.\r\n\r\nNow I want to make a point here: Dardoni was not a scientific farmer.\r\nHe didn’t know anything about the science of farming. He was not\r\nreviving worn-out soil by the use of modern cultivation. He was not\r\napplying laboratory methods; he was applying horse sense. He didn’t\r\nknow any more about farming, or as much perhaps, as every mother’s\r\nson of those who had been born and brought up here and their fathers\r\nbefore them. But he did know enough to work his land and he had learned\r\nto do that in a country where a single acre means something. The only\r\ndifference between him and these others was that he got up early in the\r\nmorning and worked--worked all day long. The one thing in his favor was\r\nthat he also had a business instinct and appreciated the value of his\r\ncity market. But principally his success lay in the fact that he used\r\nevery single advantage and made the most of it.\r\n\r\nHe lived in a large old-fashioned Colonial house which had once been\r\nowned by a local politician who had succeeded in being elected to\r\nCongress for a single term in Civil War days, and who had never found\r\nit necessary to do anything afterwards. His son dissipated his fortune\r\nand the place came on the market about the time Dardoni happened\r\nalong. Dardoni hadn’t improved its appearance any but he had added a\r\nbig barn and several out houses. His family consisted of a wife and\r\nsix children, the oldest being Lucia who was eighteen and who had been\r\neducated at the local high school, and the youngest being Joe, now\r\nthree years old. The rest of his household included a half dozen young\r\nmen, all relatives, to whom he paid an average of ten dollars a week.\r\nThey were good workers and seldom remained with him longer than three\r\nyears before buying a place of their own. Through him, directly and\r\nindirectly, some forty families had already settled in the village.\r\n\r\nPersonally I found Dardoni a most interesting and agreeable fellow, and\r\nthe more I saw him the better I liked him. He had become thoroughly\r\nAmericanized in the sense that he had really made America his home\r\nwith the expectation of spending his life here and having his sons\r\nand daughters live here after him. He had been naturalized and was a\r\nheavy taxpayer but he took no interest in the affairs of the town.\r\nFor one thing his home was his castle and for another his habit of\r\nthought was to accept conditions as they were and make the best of them\r\nwithout any attempt to change them. But whenever I suggested any needed\r\nimprovement, such as in the matter of better roads, I found him alive\r\nand willing to do his share.\r\n\r\nOne other incident that winter set me to thinking and made me feel\r\nmore than ever the need of some radical revolution in this old town.\r\nHadley came to me in January and wanted to borrow fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n“Show me that you really need it and I’ll let you have it,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a note comin’ due,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Who holds it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Dardoni,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“What did you borrow from him for?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, there was considerable sickness in the family last year and I\r\ngot hard up.”\r\n\r\n“You own your house all clear?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--except that Dardoni took a first mortgage on it for the note.”\r\n\r\n“And you have five acres of land?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And there’s only you and your wife?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then how--”\r\n\r\n“Doctors and medicines cost something,” he broke in, rather resenting\r\nmy further questioning.\r\n\r\nNow here was a concrete example of a man without any bad habits in the\r\nordinary meaning of the word, who had lived here fifty years in a\r\nhouse and on land which came to him by inheritance, who had worked with\r\na fair amount of industry and raised three children, all now away from\r\nhome and self supporting, who in a crisis had been forced to borrow\r\nmoney from an immigrant who hadn’t been in this country ten years and\r\nwho started without a cent. On the face of it there was something wrong\r\nhere, but what was it? In a nutshell, lack of thrift, lack of industry,\r\nlack of enterprise. Hadley was doing here on a farm exactly what I had\r\ndone in the suburbs; he was living and always had lived up to the last\r\ncent he made. Even at this time, when he was earning forty dollars a\r\nmonth from me, he didn’t save a cent. He bought hay and corn for his\r\nhorse; he bought expensive meats for his table; instead of mending old\r\nharnesses, he bought new harnesses; he subscribed for a daily paper\r\nand had a telephone in his house which he didn’t need any more than\r\nhe needed a safe deposit vault. In the meanwhile he had five acres of\r\nidle land at his back. He was in a state of lethargy as the whole town\r\nwas in a state of lethargy. He was stagnant--half-dead. A dozen things\r\nwhich had been luxuries to his father had become necessities to him.\r\nThe price of everything had increased and he hadn’t kept pace with\r\nit. What was true of him was true of the whole town. I loaned him the\r\nmoney, but that night I had a talk with Ruth.\r\n\r\n“Ruth,” I said, “I’m going to give this old town the biggest shaking up\r\nit’s had since the glacial period.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Billy, what’s the matter?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Everything’s the matter,” I said. “This village isn’t sleeping, but\r\ndead. It’s time someone blew the resurrection trumpet. I’m going to\r\nblow it; I’m going to play Gabriel.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up from her sewing with a laugh, but when she saw I was in\r\nearnest she put aside her work and came over and put her arms around me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSTIRRING THINGS UP\r\n\r\n\r\nI meant every word I said and I set to work right off. One of the\r\nfirst things I did was to have the Reverend Percy Cunningham up to\r\nsupper. His church was probably the biggest social influence in the\r\nvillage and so if it was possible I wanted to enlist him at the\r\nbeginning. Personally I didn’t think much of his ability. He was a\r\nserious man who acted as though he thought his chief function here\r\nwas the conducting of funerals. The very sight of him was a grim\r\nreminder of death. He dressed in black, seldom smiled, and he walked\r\non tiptoe. His appearance was all the more marked because it happened\r\nthat Seavey, the local undertaker, was a roly-poly, good-natured man\r\nand the biggest sport in town. He owned an automobile, drank more than\r\nwas good for him, and acted as starter at all the horse races within a\r\nradius of fifty miles. Perhaps it was to offset this blithe influence\r\nof his colleague that Cunningham felt it necessary to go to the other\r\nextreme. At any rate Ruth said that whenever he called in the afternoon\r\nshe felt as though she ought to darken the room and send the children\r\noff to a neighbor.\r\n\r\nWe had him up and Ruth laid herself out to make the meal as cheerful as\r\npossible, but when we were through I felt like saying Amen. Ruth spoke\r\nof it later as the Last Supper and was ashamed of herself afterwards.\r\n\r\nI took him into the front room and began on him at once.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Cunningham,” I said, “it seems to me the time has come for this\r\ntown to take out a new lease on life.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” he agreed.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “you’ve been here longer than I have; what’s your\r\nsuggestion for bringing this about?”\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment and then he said, “I’ve been seriously considering\r\nyour suggestion for a very long while--in fact ever since I took up my\r\npastoral work here.”\r\n\r\n“That was about fifteen years ago?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Sixteen years this coming spring,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“You ought to have reached some conclusion in that time,” I said.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” he nodded. “What I thought I should do when I saw my\r\nopportunity was to invite here two or three good evangelists and hold a\r\nrousing week of revival services.”\r\n\r\nNow I have no objection to revival services. In their way they do\r\ngood. But after all, their function is largely religious and I had in\r\nmind just at present something more material. Besides, the revival end\r\nseemed to me to be his own duty. He himself ought to have been holding\r\nmeetings all these last sixteen years.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” I said. “I guess we need something of the sort. But\r\nto get down to brass tacks, have you any idea how many people in this\r\ntown are in debt?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “I have never looked into that.”\r\n\r\n“About half of them,” I said. “Have you any idea how many of the men\r\nand women in this town are drunkards?”\r\n\r\n“Women--drunkards?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“About a third of them,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Carleton, you must be mistaken!”\r\n\r\n“Ask your druggist; ask Moulton!” I said. “They’ll tell you. Most of\r\nthe children are either doped or stimulated with patent medicines.\r\nBesides this, there are a dozen or two downright morphine fiends. Dr.\r\nWentworth is responsible for that.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Wentworth!” he exclaimed. “That is a very serious charge, Mr.\r\nCarleton. Dr. Wentworth has been practicing here for almost forty\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n“More’s the pity,” I said. “He belongs back in the dark ages. I went to\r\nhim myself with a touch of neuralgia and he prescribed morphine before\r\nI’d been in his office fifteen minutes. It’s become a habit with him\r\njust because it’s the simplest way of relieving pain. However, those\r\nare details. They don’t account for the general lethargy, for the\r\ndecaying orchards, for the waste land and wasted opportunities which\r\nare lying all around your parish. Now, to take another tack for a\r\nmoment--did it ever strike you as significant that every foreign-born\r\nsettler who has come here during the last ten years is waxing fat and\r\nprosperous?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen very little of the foreign element,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled weakly.\r\n\r\n“They are hardly of us,” he said, “either in faith or standards. It has\r\nalways seemed to me a pity that they should have found their way here.”\r\n\r\nI became heated at that.\r\n\r\n“Pity!” I exclaimed. “It’s the one ray of hope in this whole blessed\r\nvillage. They came here and are coming here with the old-time spirit\r\nof the men who founded this town. They are adventurers--pioneers.\r\nThey come here fresh, eager, earnest, with simple tastes and simple\r\nstandards. They are making good and they are going to continue to make\r\ngood until--mark my words--they own not only this town but all New\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\nHe sat up at this.\r\n\r\n“It’s a fact,” I said. “Look around you. It’s clear as daylight. On\r\nthe one hand we have the old stock, either abandoning their farms or\r\ndying upon them; on the other we have the newcomers pressing in with\r\nthe eagerness of explorers, taking up these farms and bringing them\r\nto life. Why, this is Eden to them. Where they came from they’ve been\r\nmaking a living off bits of soil that we wouldn’t build a pigsty on,\r\nand here they have acres for the asking. Look at Dardoni; look at\r\nTony; look at the dozen others. They are settling this country anew\r\nin exactly the same spirit that our ancestors did. And they are going\r\nto win in the same fashion. They are going to drive these shiftless\r\nremnants before them exactly as our forefathers drove off the Indians.\r\nWe think Columbus discovered this country in 1492 once for all, when\r\nit’s really being discovered now before our face and eyes. We think\r\nthis country was settled by the Pilgrims, when as a matter of fact the\r\nreal settling is going on to-day.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t intend to orate but as I sat facing Cunningham I felt as\r\nthough I were facing the whole village. With his black clothes,\r\nhis drooping shoulders, and his fifteen years of deliberation, he\r\nrepresented just the element I wanted to get at. But I didn’t rouse him\r\nvery much. He murmured something about being surprised and I ran on\r\nstill further.\r\n\r\n“Now,” I said, “what are we going to do about it? Most of the younger\r\ngeneration are moving away as fast as they are old enough. They are\r\neither going into the cities or out West. I don’t blame them for that.\r\nIt’s encouraging to think they have life enough left in ’em to crawl\r\nout of this frog pond. Those who don’t emigrate are as old and feeble\r\nat seventeen as their grandfathers were at seventy. What are we going\r\nto do about it?”\r\n\r\n“Really, Mr. Carleton, I--I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Then let me give you my idea: let’s all emigrate.”\r\n\r\nHe evidently thought I was crazy.\r\n\r\n“I mean it,” I said. “And I know what I’m talking about because I’ve\r\nalready done it once. Let’s emigrate out of the past into the present.\r\nLet’s emigrate to new New England. Let’s start a pioneer movement and\r\ntackle these old acres as though they were virgin soil. Let’s join\r\nDardoni and his fellows.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean literally, Mr. Carleton?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t that be--to speak frankly--a little bit like going backwards?”\r\n\r\n“If you like,” I said. “But it wouldn’t hurt this town any to go back a\r\nhundred years or so. The curse comes in standing still.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, preparing to leave, “your suggestion is\r\ninteresting--very. I most certainly will think it over.”\r\n\r\nRemembering how long it took him to think over things before, that\r\ndidn’t sound very encouraging.\r\n\r\n“All right,” I said, “and in the meanwhile I’m going to start\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA GAME WORTH PLAYING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pioneer idea--that was the heart of my scheme; the same old idea\r\nthat had already lifted me from the slough of a salary and the suburbs\r\nand put me on my feet. Under its inspiration I had worked out my\r\nsalvation in the city and now, although I had come here for peace and\r\nquiet, I felt as though I were being challenged by a cuff on the cheek.\r\nNo live man could sit down and look on calmly at such conditions as\r\nfaced me here. When these people within sight of a hungry market said\r\nthat farming didn’t pay it proved that the fundamental trouble was\r\nnot lack of opportunity but lack of appreciation of the opportunity.\r\nJust sit down and figure out what the forebears of these same people\r\naccomplished on these very acres. Out of this soil they wrenched the\r\ncapital that went far towards establishing the richest nation on the\r\nface of the earth. But it may be argued that the Pilgrims had the\r\nadvantage of virgin land. So they did, but virgin land in New England\r\nmeant also virgin rocks--a million or more to the acre as testified\r\nto by the stone walls of to-day; it meant virgin trees with a wild\r\ntangle of roots and no dynamite to blow them out with; it meant virgin\r\ncold and the crudest kind of stoves to fight it off with; it meant\r\ncrude virgin farm implements and virgin Indians to make the use of\r\nthem interesting by zipping arrows from ambush at the sturdy plowman.\r\nAnd yet in spite of these handicaps and a hundred others, those same\r\npioneers fought it out with such fine spirit that there are to-day men\r\nwho sigh because they were not living then instead of now. They won\r\na comfortable living and so did their sons and grandsons after them,\r\neven though they were forced to sacrifice half their time and money\r\nand life in battle to establish this nation which now we enjoy already\r\nestablished. And they did this because of the pioneer spirit back of\r\nthem--a spirit which a nation allows to die at its peril.\r\n\r\nWith all I saw before me I didn’t believe that spirit was yet dead. As\r\nRuth said, there wasn’t a youngster in this very village, who though he\r\nwasn’t worth his salt here, wouldn’t buck up if placed on a Western\r\nhomestead a hundred miles or more from civilization. The spirit of\r\nhis ancestors would then rouse him. They were proving it by taking\r\nup farms in Canada. In a less marked degree it was this same spirit\r\nwhich without their knowledge prompted them to do better in the cities\r\nat the beginning than at home. The thing then, to my mind, which was\r\nneeded was to make these same young men realize that it was really\r\njust as much of a brave adventure to make a few acres pay in the East\r\nas in the West. That was what I had got hold of when standing helpless\r\nwithout the capital to go West. I assumed that I had already traveled a\r\nthousand miles to get where I already was and from that point didn’t go\r\nten miles from home.\r\n\r\nNow it was this spirit of a young nation which the foreign-born caught.\r\nIn the older country where it was dead I haven’t much doubt but what\r\nDardoni and his fellows were a shiftless lot. If they had remained\r\nthey would probably have plugged along in a beggarly rut. It wasn’t\r\nuntil they came over here that they roused themselves to work, not\r\nploddingly like uninspired natives, but with a romantic fervor that\r\nmade these old acres yield as they had never yielded before. They\r\nbrought with them no modern agricultural methods. They took the land as\r\nthey found it, and it was their simple pioneer standards, their pioneer\r\nearnestness, their pioneer courage, that brought them success. They\r\nworked for independence with the same pioneer enthusiasm and industry\r\nwhich inspired the early settlers. How long would that little band of\r\nadventurers who landed on the rocky shore of Massachusetts have lasted\r\nif they had shown no more backbone than those who to-day fold their\r\nhands and shake their heads at the deserted farms surrounding them?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe more I talked over these things with Ruth the more excited I\r\nbecame. It was as clear as daylight that idle land could not forever\r\nexist in the face of a needy market. I had learned at school the\r\nphrase that “Nature abhors a vacuum.” Rural New England to-day was\r\npractically a vacuum and nature was already finding a way to fill it.\r\nShe was forcing in adventurers of other nations with the challenge to\r\nthe native born to either get to work or get out. If anyone wants to\r\nsee proof of this for himself let him travel through the Connecticut\r\nvalley, or along the Massachusetts cape, or through the small towns in\r\nthe neighborhood of Boston. Let him go into the hill towns of Maine,\r\nNew Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and he will find there Italians,\r\nPortuguese, Russians, Poles, already established and accepted where\r\ntwenty years ago a foreigner was a curiosity. They are the vanguard of\r\nthe army Nature is marshaling for her certain purpose. Let the traveler\r\nlook below the superficial squalor and learn how many people these\r\npioneers are supporting, how much they are saving and how much they are\r\nbuying, and he will catch an inkling of what’s afoot. I had seen this\r\ngoing on in the city, but there the contrast between what was and what\r\nis was not so marked. New England cities have long ceased to be merely\r\nNew England, and I had come out into the country for that very reason.\r\nI had wanted a taste of undiluted New England, and this was what I\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Dick had been taking hold of the contracting business\r\nwith such good results that I found myself able to throw more and more\r\nupon him. He had with him a college mate, and the two under the spur of\r\nyouth went hustling after new business at a pace that made my services\r\nunnecessary except as a sort of advisory committee. With my new\r\ninterests to occupy me, with the business prospering under the younger\r\nmanagement and with a fair amount in the bank as a surety against\r\naccidents, I was glad to have it so. I believe it’s an older man’s\r\nduty to turn over his business to the younger generation whenever it\r\nis possible. During the winter I watched the progress of the two boys\r\nclosely and was surprised at the shrewdness and level-headedness that\r\nDick displayed. I give credit for that to his experience in selling\r\nnewspapers on the streets. It taught him not only self-reliance but in\r\nhis association with men both self-confidence and poise. He knew how\r\nto approach men, how to put forward his case in the shortest possible\r\ntime, and then how and when to leave. He was popular too with the gang\r\nand I found the latter turning more and more to him.\r\n\r\nIt was in February that after a long talk with Ruth I called the boy\r\ninto my den one evening.\r\n\r\n“Dick,” I said, “I haven’t been very much more than a figurehead in\r\nthe business during the last few months and now I think I’ll pull out\r\naltogether.”\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, Dad,” he answered, “what’s the matter with you?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I said. “Only you don’t need me and I want to take up\r\nfarming.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better let me call in the doc,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Do I look as though I needed him?” said I. “It’s sure that if I felt\r\nthat way I wouldn’t be undertaking a new business.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right for you to putter around here for fun,” he said, “but\r\nyou know as well as I that you can’t make farming pay. Just look around\r\nyou--”\r\n\r\n“That’s what makes me believe farming will pay,” I said. “I look around\r\nme and I see men doing just what you advise me to do--puttering around.\r\nYou wouldn’t expect to make contracting pay if you went at it that way,\r\nwould you?”\r\n\r\n“I know, but--”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” I broke in, glad of a chance to express some of the things\r\nI had been thinking over for the last few months. “Look here, boy, do\r\nyou realize what as a business proposition this village is? It’s a\r\nbig unused plant in which thousands of dollars have been invested,\r\nand it’s lying idle next door to a market crying for its products. If\r\nyou saw a big factory building all equipped and standing idle, with\r\nlabor loafing around the doors, with its books filled with orders,\r\nyou’d jump in, wouldn’t you? Well, that’s exactly what this village\r\nis. Small as it is, you’ve only to look at the assessor’s books to\r\nfind that over a million dollars is invested here in lands and another\r\nhalf million in buildings. There are over eight hundred voters in town\r\nand not a hundred of them are making more than a bare living out of\r\nthis investment. It’s safe to say that not a quarter of one per cent.\r\nis being made on this big capital. And yet within a team drive of us\r\nthere’s a market so large that it’s bringing its produce at a profit\r\nsome three thousand miles. It’s not only bringing it there, but it’s\r\nbringing it into this very town.”\r\n\r\n“But look here, Dad,” Dick interrupted, “you don’t own the town, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“But I own part of it,” I said, “and I intend to help operate the rest.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how,” he said. “Besides it’s been tried and the business\r\nhasn’t paid.”\r\n\r\n“What about Dardoni?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“That’s so.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to undertake anything that isn’t being done to-day right\r\nunder our noses. It’s as true as gospel preaching that these old-world\r\npioneers are going to own this village and utilize to the fullest these\r\nopportunities unless we do ourselves. What is true here is true of all\r\nNew England. That isn’t a cry of wolf when there is no wolf, either;\r\nit’s the sober truth. These fellows are going at their work right. It\r\nisn’t luck with them. You can’t say that New York is owned by Jews\r\nbecause Hebrews are a lucky race. They are the unluckiest race on the\r\nface of the earth. They own New York because they are a pioneer race.\r\nAnd because of this they are going to own more than New York if we\r\nAmericans don’t wake up.”\r\n\r\n“By George, you’re right, Dad,” exclaimed Dick. “What is more, they\r\ndeserve all they get. They’ve worked and sacrificed for every cent of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly as our ancestors did when they were adventurers in a new\r\nland,” I said. “It gets back again to the pioneer idea. This country\r\nwith its institutions no longer belongs to the people who made it. It’s\r\nbeing made all over again and it belongs to those who are helping in\r\nthe new making.”\r\n\r\n“Right! Right! But what you want to do is to get out and preach this.\r\nYou’ve worked hard, Dad, and it’s time you had a rest.”\r\n\r\n“There’s been preaching enough, Dick,” I said, “and as for rest--a man\r\ndoesn’t rest at my age by doing nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then what’s your scheme?”\r\n\r\n“To make my own farm pay and then to help my neighbors make their farms\r\npay.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll stake my last dollar that you make your own pay if you start in\r\nto do it, but as for the others--have you thought out any plan?”\r\n\r\n“In a rough way,” I said. “In the first place I’m convinced that\r\ntalk doesn’t do any good. These people have been preached at through\r\nthe papers, magazines and pulpit until their brains are calloused.\r\nThey aren’t interested in the problem in the abstract. They aren’t\r\ninterested in anything much--not even themselves. They’re convinced\r\nthat farming doesn’t pay and they have before them the visible proof\r\nthat it doesn’t so far as they are concerned anyhow. On the other hand,\r\nthere’s Dardoni, but they dispose of him by calling him a Dago.”\r\n\r\n“Then what’s left?” demanded Dick.\r\n\r\n“To get them interested in themselves first of all. The only way I know\r\nof to do that is to make it worth their while in good hard cash.”\r\n\r\n“Bribe ’em?”\r\n\r\n“It amounts to that. I want to get them together in some sort of an\r\norganization.”\r\n\r\n“There’s the Grange,” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“It has played its part and in some places is still playing it. But\r\naround here people are sick of it. It has become nothing but a social\r\nclub.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“You know what they are doing in the West and South; they are offering\r\ncash prizes to boys for the best crop of corn raised on a given\r\narea. They’ve roused the whole country to the competition and have\r\nadvertised it so well that the winner becomes for the moment a national\r\nfigure. That’s what we ought to do here, only my plan is to give the\r\ncompetition a wider scope. We ought to have prizes for the older men\r\nand for the women. We ought to stimulate better care of our apple\r\norchards, better hay fields, better potatoes, better household economy,\r\nbetter kitchen gardens.”\r\n\r\n“Hold on,” interrupted Dick, “who’s going to pay for these prizes?”\r\n\r\n“In the end the club will raise the money. To start with it ought to be\r\nraised by public subscription.”\r\n\r\n“If I know this crowd, you’ve got a job.”\r\n\r\n“Ten prizes of a hundred dollars each will amount to only a thousand\r\ndollars. The business men of the town ought to give half that the first\r\nyear; I’ll give the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Hear! Hear!” shouted Dick.\r\n\r\n“As an investment,” I said. “If we can bring this old town to life it\r\nwill pay every mother’s son in it. If we can make it the livest, the\r\nmost beautiful village in the state, as it ought to be made, we’ll\r\nattract a desirable class of residents and double real estate values.\r\nThe prosperity of every citizen is the prosperity of the community.\r\nIn the meanwhile we’ll decrease the cost of living here and give men\r\ncash to pay their bills. Good Lord, there’s no limit as to what can be\r\ndone if we can rouse these people. I tell you it’s a great big business\r\nproposition if nothing more.”\r\n\r\n“By George, I don’t know but what you’re right, Dad,” exclaimed Dick.\r\n“It will be a game worth playing, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PIONEERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur plan was simple and to the point; first to organize the village\r\ninto a club on the simplest and broadest lines. It was to be called\r\n“The Pioneers,” and every taxpayer and the family of every taxpayer was\r\nto be eligible for membership. The membership fee was to be for adults\r\none dollar, for women fifty cents, for boys ten cents. We were to have\r\na president, a secretary-treasurer, and a board of five directors.\r\nThe latter were to pass on all disbursements and had the privilege of\r\ncanceling membership fees in any worthy case. Our constitution and\r\nby-laws were to be merely perfunctory and as free of red tape as was\r\nconsistent with proper organization.\r\n\r\nHolt, a young lawyer in town who had taken an immediate interest in the\r\nplan, undertook to secure the pledges for the thousand dollars so that\r\nat the first meeting we might have something tangible to present. I\r\nheaded the list with five hundred dollars, he came second with fifty,\r\nand Ed Barclay made up another fifty. Holt secured the rest in two days\r\nfrom the village merchants. Not a man refused to subscribe. On the\r\nface of it the scheme appealed to them as worth a try anyhow. It took\r\nno argument to make them appreciate the fact that their business was\r\ndependent upon the prosperity of the community, but it impressed them\r\nas a distinct novelty to attempt anything to further the prosperity\r\nof the same community upon which they were dependent. They had always\r\naccepted conditions as fixed by forces over which they had no control.\r\nThey were like farmers who, before the days of irrigation, accepted\r\ndrought as a decree of God. The idea of doing anything to remedy\r\nnatural conditions never occurred to them. This new plan was carrying\r\nmatters even one step further; it was an attempt not to remedy but\r\nactually to create. The argument I had used with Dick about the town\r\nbeing a big unused plant appealed to them. With a market waiting for us\r\nand plenty of labor on hand we proposed to set the wheels a-going and\r\ncreate a business for the merchants and for every citizen in the town.\r\n\r\nThree days later, on January fifteenth, the following notice, prepared\r\nby Holt, appeared in the local paper spread over half the front page, in\r\nplace of the usual stale Washington correspondence:\r\n\r\n  ATTENTION!\r\n\r\n  Next Wednesday evening, January nineteenth, a meeting will be held in\r\n  the Opera House to discuss a plan for putting money into the pockets\r\n  of every resident of this village.\r\n\r\n  WE ARE GOING TO WAKE UP!\r\n\r\n  A committee of citizens has contributed the sum of ONE THOUSAND\r\n  Dollars which will be divided among those who attend this meeting and\r\n  fulfil the conditions.\r\n\r\n  WE ARE GOING TO WAKE UP!\r\n\r\n  Come and bring the whole family. The Woodmen band will furnish music.\r\n\r\n  WE SURE ARE GOING TO WAKE UP!\r\n\r\nThis looked to me a little bit like circus advertising and I wanted\r\nHolt to tone it down, but he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I’d put it in red ink if they had any in the printing shop, but they\r\nhaven’t. You don’t use a tinkly silver bell when you want to call this\r\nbunch in the morning; you use a cow bell.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to this we had the same call to arms printed in the form\r\nof a circular--Holt unearthed some green paper for this--and mailed a\r\ncopy to everyone in town. Those we had left over we tacked up in the\r\nstores and on telegraph poles. It’s pretty certain no one missed seeing\r\nit, and if they did they had to be deaf not to hear about it, for there\r\nwasn’t much of anything else talked about from the moment it appeared.\r\nWe wanted to get everyone together for once if we never did again, and\r\nwe certainly succeeded.\r\n\r\nAn hour before the meeting was called to order the hall was packed\r\njam full and there were at least a hundred who couldn’t get in. There\r\nis something electric about the enthusiasm of people in just being\r\ntogether. The whole village rubbing shoulders with one another in a\r\nbunch had its effect. They were on edge with excitement and began to\r\nshow signs of waking up on the spot. The slightest incident was enough\r\nto send a laugh through the crowd and it took nothing at all to start a\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\nHolt was flying around like a hen with its head cut off trying to make\r\nroom for those outside, collecting chairs and poking up the janitor to\r\nkeep the hall warm. His face was flushed and his eyes bright with the\r\nexcitement of it. I myself was fairly stage struck when I looked out\r\nfrom behind the wings and saw the gathering. I found it difficult to\r\ncatch my breath and heartily wished someone else was going to preside.\r\nI tried to persuade Holt to open the meeting but he wouldn’t.\r\n\r\n“No, siree, you’re the man. Where’s that confounded band?” He was off\r\nin a second to round them up and make out the programme for the music.\r\nHe had to make room for them on the stage and a few minutes later they\r\nstruck up the Star Spangled Banner. After they had played it through\r\nonce Holt stepped to the front after nodding towards them to repeat.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, “everyone join in.”\r\n\r\nHe stood there like the leader of a chorus beating time with his hands,\r\nand every man, woman and child sang his best. They sang the second\r\nverse with a vim that strained their throats. As I watched them my\r\neyes grew blurry and my knees weak. I began to question all the hard\r\nthings I had said about them, for if ever patriotism was expressed\r\nin music it was then. It seemed to me that a hundred years and more\r\nrolled back, revealing every man here as ready to shoulder a musket for\r\nhis country as ever their ancestors had been. When the singing ceased\r\nand it came time for me to step forward I felt worse than I did when\r\nas a boy I had to speak a piece on Friday afternoon. I was appointed\r\ntemporary chairman by acclaim and then started in to deliver the little\r\nspeech I had prepared for the occasion. But I hadn’t gone far before\r\nI forgot it and took a new course. At first I had been self-conscious\r\nlike a bashful man among strangers, but when I was used to the many\r\neyes staring at me I felt as though I was with my own family. A common\r\ncountry and a common cause seemed to unite us on the spot. I had\r\nwished to avoid the personal. Even in the face of the publicity I have\r\nalready given the little happenings of my own life, I can truthfully\r\nsay I don’t like it. But I felt here as I felt before when I wrote for\r\nprint, that what a man can talk of from his own knowledge counts for a\r\ngreat deal more than his theories. So before I knew it I found myself\r\ntelling briefly what I put down in “One Way Out.” I tried to impress\r\nupon them the opportunities that are open to a man who tackles life in\r\na pioneer spirit and the fun of the fight. Then I rehearsed what their\r\nancestors had done on these same acres upon which they now lived and\r\ntried to make them understand that if to-day there were more handicaps\r\nthere were also corresponding opportunities. I spoke of the big market\r\nawaiting their produce and by my personal experiences in living in the\r\nbig city made them understand how hungry a market it was.\r\n\r\n“If your great grandfathers could come back here to-day,” I said,\r\n“there isn’t a man of them who wouldn’t build a fortune upon this land.”\r\n\r\nI was conscious of cheering from time to time but I didn’t realize\r\nhow deeply they were really moved until I had finished. Then I became\r\nconscious again that I was on a platform facing them and I saw them\r\nrise to their feet and cheer again and again. I had in some way\r\nintroduced Holt, but before he stepped forward he motioned to the band\r\nand they struck up Yankee Doodle Dandy. The leader didn’t step lively\r\nenough for him and amid more cheering and laughing he took the leader’s\r\nplace and led them off at a quickstep that made the whole crowd keep\r\npace with pounding feet. Ruth was in the front row with Dick and I\r\ncaught her eye. She smiled at me in a way that made me very proud.\r\n\r\nHolt, taking advantage of the right feeling I had created in the\r\naudience, developed at once the practical side of the proposition.\r\n\r\n“Have all the pioneers died or moved West?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“No! No!” came the reply from a group of the younger men.\r\n\r\n“Right! Right!” he shouted. “What is more, we’re going to prove it.\r\nWe have a fine example here in Mr. Carleton, but we aren’t going to\r\nallow him to be known for long as the only living specimen of pioneer\r\ncaptivity.”\r\n\r\nThis of course raised a laugh and then he told them something of what\r\nwas being done in the middle West and South to encourage farming. Then\r\nhe quoted from some of the reports recently made by the government and\r\nby agricultural schools to show what the possibilities for farming were\r\nright in New England.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, “what we want to do is to get together and work\r\ntogether and fight together and accomplish some of these things\r\nourselves. The trouble with us is that it’s been every man for himself\r\nand the devil take the hindmost. The farmer must help the merchant\r\nand the merchant help the farmer. To this end it is proposed that we\r\norganize ourselves into a club to be known as ‘The Pioneers.’”\r\n\r\nThis was greeted with a cheer and then Holt outlined the plan as we\r\nhad already outlined it among ourselves. This was greeted with a still\r\nnoisier cheer. But when he mentioned the thousand dollars that had been\r\nraised as prize money the audience let itself loose.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said in conclusion, “I move you that we waste no further time\r\nin discussion but adopt at once the constitution and by-laws for this\r\norganization as here prepared.”\r\n\r\nIt was seconded and carried unanimously.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Holt, “I move you that Mr. William Carleton be elected\r\npresident of this club by a unanimous vote.”\r\n\r\nIt was done.\r\n\r\nI took the floor again and nominated Holt as secretary-treasurer, which\r\nwas seconded and passed.\r\n\r\nThen Holt, the three leading merchants and myself were elected a\r\ncommittee of five directors to prepare the further details. The\r\nmeeting then adjourned until the following Wednesday.\r\n\r\nHolt had ready on the platform paper and ink for those to sign who\r\nwished to become members, and no sooner was the meeting over than a\r\nrush for the stage began. Two hundred and sixty-three signatures were\r\nsecured then and there and as near as I could judge the only reason\r\neveryone in the hall didn’t sign was because only the hardy could reach\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nNow no one could have asked for a more auspicious beginning than this,\r\nbut I had seen enough of how men act in a group to know that the real\r\ntest would come later after each individual had cooled off and thought\r\nover the proposition for himself. Consequently while I considered this\r\nevening’s enthusiasm to be decidedly significant and boding well for\r\nthe scheme, I expected a slump sooner or later. Holt, however, couldn’t\r\nsee even a speck in the clear sky, and I for one was glad of it. It’s\r\ngood to see a man that way.\r\n\r\n“They jumped at it like a hungry trout does at a worm,” he declared.\r\n“This is just the encouragement for which they’ve been waiting\r\ntwenty-five years. Before next Wednesday I expect to have the name of\r\neveryone who can hold a pen on that list.”\r\n\r\nAnd Ruth was about as enthusiastic as Holt.\r\n\r\n“It was fine, Billy,” she said. “You certainly kept your promise about\r\nwaking them up.”\r\n\r\nIn looking back over these last few pages it strikes me that perhaps\r\nthese things aren’t very important but my pen sort of ran away with\r\nme as I remembered that first meeting. But then again maybe these\r\ndetails are significant as showing how easy it was to rouse these\r\npeople as a whole in contrast with how difficult it was to inspire them\r\nindividually. If Holt and I had taken any one of these men into an\r\noffice and given him the same talk it would have gone in one ear and\r\nout the other without leaving even a record of its progress.\r\n\r\nDuring the next week the five of us worked hard on our list of prizes.\r\nWe wanted the money to cover as much ground as possible but we also\r\nwanted each prize to be substantial enough to be tempting. This is what\r\nwe finally made ready to report to the next meeting:\r\n\r\n1. For the best crop of hay on one acre of fresh broken land, one\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\n2. For the best crop of hay on an acre of land already used as hay\r\nland, seventy-five dollars.\r\n\r\n3. For the best crop of corn on an acre of land, one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n4. For the best house garden, seventy-five dollars.\r\n\r\n5. For the best market garden, seventy-five dollars.\r\n\r\n6. For the best flower garden, fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n7. For the best potato crop per acre, one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n8. For the largest return from chickens according to capital invested,\r\none hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n9. For the largest return from cows according to capital invested, one\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\n10. For the largest return from pigs according to capital invested, one\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\n11. For the most notable improvement in an old orchard, one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nThis seemed at the time and it seems to me to-day a pretty fair\r\ndivision. It gave everyone a chance whether the owner of one acre or\r\nfifty, and it was varied enough to interest everyone. As the awards\r\nwere to be made on the basis of capital invested it gave the poor man\r\nan equal chance with the well-to-do.\r\n\r\nTo some people the main prizes of a hundred dollars may seem small, but\r\njust remember that this was a bonus over and above the regular profit\r\na man was sure to make on his six months’ work. Furthermore, a hundred\r\ndollars in the country means a good deal more than it does in the city.\r\nFurthermore again, one hundred dollars in a lump sum is worth two\r\nhundred dollars in installments. And finally, one hundred dollars as a\r\nprize looks about as big as a thousand dollars. I’ve known men to spend\r\na hundred dollars in a lottery and consider their money well invested\r\nwhen they finally drew a prize of five dollars. In every newspaper\r\ncontest you’ll find men doing a hundred dollars’ worth of work to get a\r\nchance at a ten dollar prize.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second meeting was almost as well attended as the first and the\r\ncommittee’s report was received with enthusiasm. But the thing which\r\npleased me most was the fact that it was the young men who came early\r\nand crowded up into the front of the hall. Holt noticed this and\r\npointed out a goodly number of youngsters who never before had taken\r\nany interest in farming at all. It is doubtful if they did now except\r\nas a means for reaching the prizes. However, that point didn’t worry\r\nme. I knew that in order to win the money they must first of all make\r\ntheir land pay, and once they got into their heads the fact the soil\r\nwould pay, half our object was attained.\r\n\r\nBut this suggested a new idea. In fact, every step we took suggested\r\nfurther development. Our scheme grew by itself like a weed, which to my\r\nmind is the logical way for an enterprise of this sort to grow. After\r\nwe had adjourned until the following Wednesday I called the attention\r\nof the board of directors to the fact that so many young men who had\r\nalways affected to scorn farming showed an interest in our proposition.\r\n\r\n“Now,” I said, “it seems to me a pity to let them go at their work in\r\nhaphazard fashion. The most any of them know, probably, is to plow and\r\nharrow the soil, put in their seed, and then wait for results.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Moulton, “if they keep down the weeds it will keep them\r\nout of mischief, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“And they’ll get discouraged in a season, if not sooner,” I said. “No,\r\nwe want to help them do more than that--we want them to get results. It\r\nwon’t mean anything to them or to you if they don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” agreed Holt. “Swanson, you’re the farmer of the board. It’s up\r\nto you to instruct them.”\r\n\r\nSwanson had a fifty-acre farm on which he raised hay with better\r\nresults than some, simply because his land was better.\r\n\r\n“They prob’ly think they know more’n I do now,” he answered.\r\n\r\nThere wasn’t much doubt about that, for no one ever has much faith in\r\nlocal authority. Still I saw the old man was rather proud that the\r\nsuggestion had been made and I didn’t wish to hurt his feelings.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Swanson is a busy man,” I said. “What we want is someone who can\r\ncome here and address the club as a club. I thought that possibly the\r\nState Agricultural School might help us out.”\r\n\r\nSwanson threw up his head at this like an old war horse scenting a\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n“Huh,” he grunted, “what do them fellers know ’bout farmin’? Half of\r\n’em never held a plow handle in their lives.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe you’re right,” I said, “but if it’s true I’d like to have one of\r\nthem down here and help show him up.”\r\n\r\n“What they don’t know ’bout farmin’ would fill a book,” he growled.\r\n\r\n“We’ll put you down in the audience and let you pop questions at them,”\r\nI laughed. “Anyway it ought to keep up the interest of the club until\r\nspring. No harm done anyway. I put the motion that I be instructed to\r\nwrite the school and see what can be done.”\r\n\r\n“Seconded,” chirped in Holt.\r\n\r\nSwanson didn’t object, and so the next day I sent off my letter. In it\r\nI told briefly what we had done and what we wished to do and asked for\r\nadvice. To my surprise I received at once an enthusiastic letter from\r\nthe president himself asking for a personal interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conversation with a dozen or more of the better farmers of our town\r\nin an endeavor to get at the most important features of what in the\r\nway of instructions we needed, I was surprised to find that suspicion\r\nof agricultural school methods was general. The farmer looked as much\r\naskance at these teachers as he did at college men. They thought\r\nthem steeped in book learning and without practical experience. If\r\nthey admitted that at the experiment stations these men produced\r\nfine results, it was only to add, “But thet ain’t runnin’ a farm by\r\na long shot.” In some cases farmers had actually sent soil to be\r\nanalyzed and had followed instructions about seeds and fertilizers,\r\nwhether accurately or not I don’t know, but certainly without gaining\r\nconfidence in the new methods. This seemed to me a pity for the farmer\r\nif he was wrong and a pity for the taxpayer, who was furnishing funds\r\nto support these schools, if the farmer was right. So while I didn’t\r\nreceive much encouragement for this new feature of our enterprise I\r\nwent to town to meet the president of the agricultural school, primed\r\nwith a few opinions which I thought might wake him up at any rate.\r\n\r\nI will call him Dennison. I found him a gentle, scholarly-looking man\r\nof sixty, with earnest eyes and with an air that impressed me at once\r\nwith his sincerity. There was, however, about his mouth an expression\r\nof weary resignation as of a man who has fought a long fight without\r\nparticularly encouraging results. He was very cordial and wanted to\r\nhear at once just what our scheme was. I told him briefly how our\r\nultimate hope was to arouse the pioneer spirit in the village and of\r\nthe very practical incentive we had given to rouse, first of all, the\r\nambition of the men to till the soil.\r\n\r\n“This prize system,” I explained to him, “is only a quick method of\r\ngetting the community started. It gives the men something to work for\r\nthat seems to them tangible. A possible five hundred dollar profit is\r\nvague and conditional, while a hundred dollars deposited in the bank is\r\ndefinite and concrete. They’ll work for that.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know but what you’re right,” he said, as though impressed by\r\nthe new idea. “At any rate the experiment is worth fostering. I’ll send\r\nyou down all the speakers you’ll listen to.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” I said, “but right here is where we must use some judgment.\r\nThese people are queer, and--well, I’ll tell you frankly they haven’t\r\nmuch faith in you fellows.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t take offense. He just smiled--a weary, patient kind of smile.\r\n\r\n“That’s the pity of it,” he said.\r\n\r\n“And what’s the reason of it?” I asked directly.\r\n\r\n“I take it you haven’t lived long among them yourself,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t,” I said, “but I expect to live among them from now on.\r\nI’ve seen a lot of them as it is, because I’ve taken pains to.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“And I’ll give you my own theory first,” I said. “What we want down our\r\nway are practical men. At this stage we don’t want theoretical farmers.\r\nWe don’t want to learn just yet the chemistry of farming, but how to\r\nmake the most out of our land with the materials at hand. We aren’t\r\nlooking for the best results, but the most practical results. I wish\r\nyou could teach us how to raise potatoes, hay, corn and garden stuff\r\nwith the aid of plain old-fashioned manure, a plain old-fashioned plow,\r\nand plain old-fashioned sweat and elbow grease. The other can come\r\nlater.”\r\n\r\nAgain he smiled.\r\n\r\n“Are you a college man, Mr. Carleton?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered, wondering what that had to do with it.\r\n\r\nThen he took from his bag a catalogue of the school and went over with\r\nme the details of the courses given. While there was a background of\r\nconsiderable theory, I must admit the work also covered about every\r\npractical branch of farming I had ever heard of.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think a man who mastered these courses would know something\r\nabout farming?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He should,” I said. “It certainly makes me feel as though I’d like to\r\ngo through the school myself.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “you turn out about forty graduates a year. What do\r\nmost of the boys do?”\r\n\r\n“Teach,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Most of them come from farms?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Few of them go back to the farms?”\r\n\r\n“Not many,” he answered uneasily. “But some secure positions as farm\r\nmanagers.”\r\n\r\n“Managers of other people’s farms?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course. Most of the young men have limited means and are\r\nwithout the capital to buy farms of their own.”\r\n\r\n“But why don’t they return to the farms they left before they came to\r\nschool?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose they feel the opportunities there aren’t large enough for\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” I said. “Now, Mr. Dennison, I’m not a farmer; I’m a business\r\nman. I’m taking hold of the possibilities of this village where I live\r\nas a business enterprise. And I’m not a teacher. I’m not in a position\r\nto criticise your work here except as a business man who wants to use\r\nsome of it to help along his business enterprise. But right here I’d\r\nlike to say frankly that it doesn’t seem to me it would pay to hire\r\ninstruction which ends by making the employee discontented with his\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“With equal frankness allow me to say I consider that a very narrow\r\nway of looking at it,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Don’t think I’m considering my own pocket,” I said. “I’m only general\r\nmanager for the group represented by the club. What I mean is that what\r\nwe ourselves particularly want is instruction which will help every\r\nman to thrive and gain content on his own land and won’t leave him\r\nambitious to neglect it for a larger enterprise somewhere else. That\r\ntendency is just what we’re fighting. There’s been too much of ‘Go\r\nwest, young man.’ Our battle cry is ‘Stay at home, young man.’ Honestly\r\nnow--isn’t that what New England needs?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” he nodded.\r\n\r\n“Inspiration to stay at home and compete with the old-world pioneers\r\nwho are pushing him hard, that’s what the native New Englander needs,”\r\nI repeated.\r\n\r\n“Ah, those foreigners,” he sighed. “If I had stuff like that to handle.”\r\n\r\n“You might spoil it,” I said, laughing in my turn.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you’re right,” he joined in. “After all, there’s no substitute\r\nfor sheer industry.”\r\n\r\nWell, the upshot of our pleasant argument was that he offered to do\r\nall he could to help us in our project.\r\n\r\n“After all,” he said, “there are only five essentials in good farming.\r\nThe first is to determine what the land lacks by analysis (don’t get\r\nfrightened--we’ll do that much for you); the second is to supply that\r\nlack by proper fertilization; the third is proper selection of seed;\r\nthe fourth is proper rotation of crops so that one crop will put back\r\nwhat the previous crop has taken out; and the fifth is just hard work\r\nin keeping the land cultivated. I don’t see why in a general way that\r\nground couldn’t be covered between now and spring. At any rate I’m\r\nwilling to try it if you’ll furnish the enthusiasm.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do that if I have to hire a brass band,” I said. But I didn’t\r\nneed a brass band. With that prize money in prospect there wasn’t a man\r\nwho dared stay away for fear the other fellow might secure an advantage\r\nover him. We had two lectures a week open only to members of the club.\r\nWe tried to make them as informal as possible and at the conclusion of\r\neach talk threw the meeting open for questions. Holt took down each\r\nlecture in shorthand and I had a half dozen copies made at my own\r\nexpense. We kept one of these for the club as a matter of record but\r\nthe others were at Holt’s office where any member was allowed to take\r\none for not over three days so that he might copy for himself anything\r\nhe wished. It was surprising how soon those copies became thumb-marked\r\nand dog-eared.\r\n\r\nThe speakers kept true to my requirements and followed substantially\r\nthe outline laid out by Dennison at our first interview. The first\r\nspeaker took up the matter of soil and had a difficult task on his\r\nhands to convince these men that not all dirt was soil and that not all\r\nsoils were the same.\r\n\r\n“There’s as much difference in land as there is in stock,” he said.\r\n“And if you want the best returns you have to handle it just as\r\ntenderly and feed it just as properly. The next time you plant a\r\ncornfield don’t think of it as a field but as a well bred cow or horse.\r\nGroom it as you would groom your horse or cow and feed it with the same\r\ncare. Remember, too, that just as you don’t expect your horse to give\r\nwork or your cow to give milk without supplying the necessary material\r\nout of which to make work and make milk; you can’t expect your field to\r\ngive you back corn unless you supply it with the material for making\r\ncorn. That sounds reasonable, doesn’t it? The poor farmer is the only\r\nworkingman in the world except the Wall Street sucker who expects to\r\nget something for nothing. Nature supplies most of the elements free of\r\ncharge, but whatever you take out you have to put back.”\r\n\r\nThen he went on to explain how different soils need different foods\r\njust as much as different kinds of stock need different foods.\r\n\r\n“It all depends upon what you want to get back. If you want back eggs\r\nyou use the food that will make eggs; if you want back fat you use the\r\nfood that will make fat; if you want back milk, you use the food that\r\nwill make milk, and so on. Now, some of your land is already adapted\r\nby nature to supply certain things--corn, wheat, hay, potatoes, what\r\nnot. When that is so, use what is given you. If, however, the land\r\nhasn’t those elements you must supply them, either by fertilizers or by\r\nplanting a preparatory crop that will use what is already present and\r\nleave behind what you want for the final crop.”\r\n\r\nThis likening of land to live stock was a fine idea. It impressed every\r\nman in the club. I know that in my own case I had always thought of\r\nland as about as fixed and abstract as a problem in geometry. This\r\ntreating it as something living--as of course it really is--gave a man\r\na new attitude towards it. It made plausible all the theories of care\r\nwhich followed. A man knows he has to feed and care for his live stock.\r\nIf so, then why not his land, which is also a living thing?\r\n\r\nThe second man took up the matter of fertilization--the restoring to\r\nthe land such elements as have been used up by the previous crops and\r\ngiven back to the farmer in the form of produce. It’s an amazingly\r\nsimple proposition when you stop to think about it. It’s merely paying\r\nback money you’ve borrowed. If, after doing that a profit isn’t left,\r\nyou can’t blame the money.\r\n\r\nThe third man covered the proper selection of seeds. Like the previous\r\nspeakers he pleaded for the substitution of horse sense and care in\r\nplace of the present haphazard methods. No more than all dirt is land\r\nare all kernels seeds. You must be sure that the seeds you plant are\r\nlive seeds. The usual method is to plant them and if you get a crop,\r\nthe seeds were surely alive; if you don’t get a crop, the seeds were\r\nsurely dead. But there is no need of risking your season’s work on\r\nsuch an experiment. Take a sample fifty from your seeds a month or so\r\nbefore planting time, place these in a box and cover with earth, keep\r\nmoist and warm and count the number of seeds which sprout. There you\r\nhave as accurate a method of determining their germinating value as any\r\nchemist could give. If the seeds don’t come up in a decent percentage,\r\nget some more. If they do, you have insured your crop so far as the\r\nseeds are concerned. The whole scheme of modern farming is to eliminate\r\nfrom the beginning all elements of chance so far as possible, which is\r\nno more than every other business man does.\r\n\r\nThe fourth speaker took up the rotation of crops, which is a somewhat\r\nmore abstract proposition than the others. It seems that nearly every\r\ncrop both takes from the land what it needs and gives back to a certain\r\nextent something else in its place. Nature is no hog and generally pays\r\nher way. The whole secret is to so alternate your crops as to take full\r\nadvantage of this fact. The matter has been determined to a science.\r\n\r\nThe fifth speaker dwelt upon the necessity of proper cultivation--of\r\nplowing deep and harrowing often. Here again was something that was\r\nwithin the understanding of the average man. Your soil and seeds need\r\nair and light as much as your live stock. You wouldn’t expect a cow to\r\nthrive shut up in a dark stall with little air. When you harrow you do\r\nno more than throw open the barn windows and let in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nI have run over in this general way the ground covered by the speakers\r\nmerely to show how simply and reasonably this subject of business-like\r\nfarming can be presented when done right. It is neither an abstract nor\r\na complex study and the essentials can be brought home to the every-day\r\nfarmer in a very few months.\r\n\r\nEach speaker, moreover, at my suggestion, besides treating his\r\nspecial subject took occasion to talk on farming as a profession--and\r\nespecially farming in New England. They emphasized the fact that\r\nfarming is a big business proposition, an honorable calling, and\r\nnot merely an effort to raise food supplies for the home. They all\r\ndwelt on the fact that New England always had been and still is a\r\nfarming region. Modern conditions instead of destroying its value as\r\nan agricultural country have really increased that value by giving\r\na larger market. But--they emphasized again and again--hard work is\r\nrequired, concentrated intelligent effort, in order to bring results.\r\nThis is true of every business. The days of fifty years ago when almost\r\nany slip-shod method was bound to bring a profit, have passed. Farming\r\nhas been the last business to accept modern business conditions, but\r\nthe time has now come when it must. Waste can no longer be tolerated\r\nhere any more than in other forms of business. A man to succeed must\r\nharbor every resource and use every by-product. As one man said, “So\r\nkeen is competition to-day, so slight a margin of profit is there\r\nbetween competing houses, that very often the man who shows a profit\r\nis the man ingenious enough to make it from the by-products which\r\ntwenty-five years ago were spurned.”\r\n\r\nOne speaker spoke of the Chinese and the tender care they bestow upon a\r\nfew hundred square feet of land and the results secured from this.\r\n\r\n“Our ancestors were both hard workers and thrifty,” said he, “and we\r\nmust get back to their standards. We in the East have been spoiled\r\nas well as despoiled by the West. We have listened to stories of\r\nthousand-acre farms, steam plows, and million-bushel crops, until our\r\nown opportunities seem petty by comparison. We have heard of Oregon\r\nfruit farms until our own fruit doesn’t seem worth cultivating. But\r\nthat’s all wrong. You ought to realize it when in spite of the million\r\ndollar crops you find yourselves paying more and more every year for\r\nyour flour. You ought to realize it whenever you go to the grain mill\r\nand pay out your good money for corn that you might as well raise\r\nyourselves. As for Oregon apples--don’t let them frighten you. If\r\nnature gives them size and color, she makes them pay for it in juice\r\nand flavor. They look well in boxes, those apples, but the world is\r\nlearning to buy New England apples to eat. There isn’t a better apple\r\ncountry on the globe than New England.”\r\n\r\nGood straight talk that, and it had its effect. You could see the\r\naudience straighten up and hold themselves the better for it. Every\r\nmeeting was well attended and there was never the slightest sign of\r\nrestlessness in the audiences, though sometimes the talks lasted nearly\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Ruth in her quiet way was doing as much as the rest of\r\nus to keep up interest in the undertaking. She made it a point to get\r\nacquainted with all the farmer wives in the neighborhood. She had them\r\nup to the house in groups and dropped many a word of encouragement and\r\ngave many a bit of advice which came from a full experience.\r\n\r\n“Billy,” she said to me one night, “it’s the deadly uninspired routine\r\nof their lives that’s killing the women. They cook and sew and scrub\r\nwithout a single dream to help them along. And that’s because the men\r\ndon’t dream. If you succeed in rousing the husbands and sons you’ll\r\nbring the wives and mothers to life, too.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what we want to do,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It shows that it isn’t lack of money that makes poverty, Billy,” she\r\nsaid. “All these women have good homes and plenty to eat and wear and\r\nyet--and yet I honestly believe they are poorer than our old friends of\r\nthe tenements.”\r\n\r\n“We were never so poor in our lives as when we lived with plenty to eat\r\nand wear in the suburbs,” I reminded her.\r\n\r\n“That’s just it,” she nodded. “This is the same kind of poverty. It\r\ncomes from the fact that for these women life ends with the end of each\r\nday. They die every time they crawl into bed at night. There is never\r\nanything for them to look forward to on the morrow.”\r\n\r\n“If we could only make them realize that this condition is largely\r\ntheir own fault--”\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t make any difference at all,” she broke in; “we must\r\nchange the conditions. Most of our misfortunes are our own fault, but\r\nthat doesn’t make them any less misfortunes. It’s another misfortune\r\nthat our misfortunes are our own fault. I don’t know but what that’s\r\nthe worst misfortune of all.”\r\n\r\nShe was right. It doesn’t do much good to blame people for their\r\nfaults. We ourselves, after making public our experiences in the\r\nsuburbs, received many hard letters from people who couldn’t see\r\nanything in our plight but the well deserved consequences of our own\r\nfolly. If we hadn’t done this or that, if we had done this or that, we\r\nwere assured that we would have come out all right. To be sure. That\r\napplies to every human being who ever tried to live this life. If we\r\nwere all as wise as Solomon to start with and lived up to all Solomon’s\r\nprecepts, then would come the millennium. But we aren’t. We all have\r\nto learn and in the learning we make many mistakes. Then we make them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnd the man who blames us and lets it go at that isn’t our friend, and\r\nsome day is going to make a mistake himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t think a winter, in our town, ever passed more quickly or\r\nmore pleasantly than this winter. The months flew by like weeks and\r\nthe weeks like days. When the first warm melting days came in late\r\nApril everyone began to get impatient. It seemed as though the snow\r\nwould never leave the ground, and many didn’t wait for this before\r\nplotting out their crops and digging up samples of soil to send to the\r\nagricultural school. Seeds were bought and tested and farming tools\r\nbrought out and put in order.\r\n\r\nIt’s good to be in the country in the spring. It was my first\r\nexperience and the change took place like a miracle. I saw trees that\r\nlooked as dead as fence posts start to life with the stirring sap; I\r\nsaw little green grass blades appear among the brown waste of dead\r\nblades; I saw all manner of living things awake and creep out of their\r\nwinter hiding places until the earth looked almost as though the\r\nresurrection trumpet had blown.\r\n\r\nSpring means a great deal more to us farmers than it does to city\r\nfolk. She comes like a partner returning from a winter vacation, takes\r\ndown the shutters, sweeps the store clean and stands at the door ready\r\nfor business. She comes with unlimited capital which is furnished\r\neveryone for the asking. If men will have none of it even then she does\r\nnot stand idle, but for the sake of the housewives and the children\r\nproceeds on her own hook to make the world as beautiful as possible;\r\nsprinkles the trees with blossoms and perfume, scatters the ground with\r\nflowers, sweetens the air with song. You can’t escape her bounty if you\r\nwill. This year, however, she couldn’t complain of lack of coöperation.\r\n\r\nHardly had the frost fairly left the ground when there was an\r\nunprecedented demand in our town for horses and plows. There were\r\nnot enough to go around. I let Hadley go in order to take the many\r\njobs that were offered him, but with every plow and horse in the\r\nneighborhood in use I saw much land that would be late for seed. If\r\ntangible evidence was needed of what the Pioneer Club had already\r\naccomplished it was in this state of affairs. There had been no\r\ndifficulty the year before. One Sunday Holt and I scoured the\r\nsurrounding towns for men and horses and secured six teams on the\r\npromise of at least a week’s work for each. They were willing enough\r\nto come, even though in doing so they neglected their own work. It was\r\nthe old story of their being willing for five dollars a day cash in\r\nhand to jeopardize a future ten. However, that was their own lookout\r\nand I quieted my conscience with the thought that if we made as good as\r\nwe hoped to do the influence of this would spread to the neighboring\r\ntowns. They were mighty curious as to what was going on.\r\n\r\n“What’s got into you people, anyhow?” asked one man.\r\n\r\n“We’re getting ready for the planting,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Well, something must have happened to make you so all-fired busy down\r\nyour way,” one of them answered. Even among neighboring towns our\r\nvillage had a bad reputation.\r\n\r\nI told him about the Pioneer Club and the prizes that were being\r\noffered. The amount made his eyes stick out.\r\n\r\n“Gee,” he answered, “guess I’ll have to move down.”\r\n\r\n“You’re welcome,” I said. “Come and bring your family.”\r\n\r\nWe certainly did look like a busy community. Drive along the roads in\r\nany direction and you’d see acre after acre of upturned land. The smell\r\nof new earth was in the air and it was like tonic even to the passerby.\r\n\r\nDuring this busy preparatory season Holt kept his law office open\r\nevenings and it came to be a sort of club room. I planned to stay down\r\nthere every evening until eleven and the two of us tried to straighten\r\nout the difficulties that arose. One of these was seeing to it that\r\nevery man who showed himself to be in earnest had a proper supply\r\nof material with which to start his crop. We made arrangements with\r\nMoulton and with Gordon the hardware man to extend reasonable credit to\r\neveryone even in cases where credit had been withdrawn. Our argument\r\nthat it was wiser to help a man get on his feet than keep him down was\r\nsound on the face of it.\r\n\r\n“These fellows mean business now,” I said to Gordon, “and if we go on\r\nhalf as well as we’ve begun there won’t be a man in this village who\r\nwithin a couple of years won’t be able to pay his bills. It’s up to you\r\nto do your part. Their success is your success. Give them credit for\r\neverything but patent medicines and you won’t lose.”\r\n\r\nWhile it was true that in doing this Gordon was choosing the lesser of\r\ntwo evils I realized that it wasn’t exactly fair either to force him\r\nand a few other merchants to bear the burden of financing these men\r\nwithout interest. But the small farmer is in a bad position. When the\r\ncommercial business house needs money it can go to a bank and upon a\r\nstatement of its business and its rating obtain money and credit on\r\nits signature. A small farmer has no business rating and can get money\r\nonly upon a mortgage at six per cent., which is almost prohibitive. Of\r\ncourse the banks can’t be blamed for treating with individuals in this\r\nway but it struck me that something might be done about this if ever\r\nwe got the community as a whole firmly bound together. The combined\r\nsecurity of all the land and business in the village ought to mean\r\nsomething to a bank.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I was not neglecting my own land. I realized that there\r\nwasn’t much use in preaching the profits of farming unless I at least\r\nmade the attempt to demonstrate it on my own acres. While on the one\r\nhand I was handicapped by lack of practical training, it struck me that\r\nthis would make the experiment all the more interesting as showing what\r\ncould be done by a man who availed himself of the knowledge of others,\r\nwhich, through the government bureaus and the State Agricultural\r\nSchool, was freely offered to everyone.\r\n\r\nBefore this series of lectures I don’t believe any human being ever\r\nknew less about farming than I did. I hadn’t spent even my vacations\r\non a farm. I couldn’t tell wheat in the field from oats. I couldn’t\r\ntell a squash from a pumpkin. I didn’t know anything about soils, about\r\nseeds, about fertilizers, about cultivation. My mind was a blank on\r\nthe subject, which at least had the advantage of making me free of\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\nI don’t mean to say that even after the superficial course of lectures\r\nto which I listened this winter that I felt myself an authority on\r\nthe subject. I didn’t. But on the other hand everything that was said\r\nsounded so much like just plain common sense that I didn’t see why\r\nany fairly intelligent man couldn’t put the theories into practice,\r\nespecially when he had the Agricultural School back of him, ready and\r\neager to give further advice.\r\n\r\nTake for example the matter of orchards. I found on my place some\r\nseventy-five apple trees all cluttered up with dead limbs. It didn’t\r\nrequire a farmer to realize that any tree was handicapped by such a\r\nburden. I took a saw and cut out all this dead wood and a little later,\r\nwhen the shoots had started, trimmed off all those which obviously were\r\nuseless. Then, still following out instructions, I scraped the bark on\r\nthe trunks and whitewashed them. This was no more than common sense\r\ngrooming, such as one would give live stock. Then, I girdled the trunks\r\nwith burlap to prevent insects from crawling up to the young leaves.\r\nAfter this, I spaded up around the roots so that air and water and\r\nsunshine could get in. Until now the dead sod had matted down into a\r\ncovering that was about as impervious to air and moisture as a rubber\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\nHadley watched me with cynical indifference. To him it seemed as\r\nfoolish to bestow all this care upon gnarled old apple trees as it\r\nwould to give the same attention to a full grown man that a woman\r\nbestows upon an infant. He believed that a tree would grow anyway and\r\nwas outside the province of farming.\r\n\r\n“Only wastin’ your time,” he said. “Them trees won’t never do nothin’.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps not, but I felt more than repaid in seeing the orchard look\r\nshipshape instead of like a neglected cemetery.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the season I had taken samples from a five-acre strip of\r\ndamp, low-lying land at the foot of the hill which was fairly well\r\ndrained, and sent them to the school for analysis. I received a\r\nreport advising me to plant potatoes there and a formula for the best\r\nfertilizer to use. Here again it didn’t take a man bred on a farm to\r\ncarry out the simple instructions. I had the field plowed as soon\r\nas the frost was out of the ground, applied my fertilizer of acid\r\nphosphate, kainit and nitrate of soda--so many pounds to the acre--and\r\nharrowed it in. It didn’t require even ordinary intelligence to have\r\nthis done or to purchase Early Norwood, New Queen and Green Mountain\r\nseed and plant them in rows three feet apart and in sets fifteen inches\r\napart. Hadley and I did the work--work that any day laborer was capable\r\nof doing. I reserved a small strip for the planting of Early Horn\r\ncarrots, Market Model parsnips, Edmand’s beets and Early Milan turnips.\r\nThese names didn’t mean anything to me, and I didn’t care if they\r\ndidn’t. Before the end of the season, however, I wished I had reserved an\r\neven larger strip for these things. I never ate such vegetables in my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI plowed up about an acre back of the barn for the garden and emptied\r\nupon this the manure from the cow barn, working it in well. Then I\r\nharrowed the ground until it was pulverized almost as fine as dust.\r\nAccording to the Professor not half time enough is devoted by the\r\naverage New England farmer to the preparation of the soil for his seed.\r\nOftentimes he is content with a shallow plowing and a single harrowing.\r\nI noticed that Dardoni and Tony, however, knew by instinct enough to\r\nwork their soil thoroughly. They depended a great deal on hand labor,\r\nbecause for one reason they could secure help cheap. Newcomers were\r\nglad enough to work for them for the experience, and the chance it gave\r\nthem to look around for places of their own. However, the result was\r\nthe same and they did their work thoroughly. I planted about one-fourth\r\nof this garden to peas in successive sowings. Here was another\r\nsimple and obvious advantage which I found my neighbors until now had\r\nneglected. They sowed perhaps an early and late crop of peas and corn\r\nbut it never occurred to them to make three or four plantings and many\r\nof them didn’t even make two. When peas and corn were ripe everyone\r\nhad peas and corn but in the intervals no one except Dardoni and his\r\nfellows had them at all. They were therefore either scarce or a drug on\r\nthe market. Under advice I used Suttons, with a few Dwarf Champions.\r\n\r\nAnother quarter of the garden I planted to beans--some string\r\nbeans--Plentifuls and Valenties--some wax and Lima beans and a large\r\npatch of white pea beans for winter.\r\n\r\nAnother quarter of the patch I put into sweet corn, using for the early\r\nvarieties Early Cory and Peep o’ Day; for medium earlies Crosby, and\r\nfor late corn Country Gentleman. Among these I put in a few squash\r\nseeds, Crooknecks and Hubbards.\r\n\r\nThe last quarter I used for cucumbers, cabbage, tomatoes and small\r\nstuff, such as lettuce, pepper grass, radishes, Swiss chard, and beets.\r\n\r\nNow to get all this done within the space of a few weeks required\r\nhard work. I was up at half past four and in the field by half past\r\nfive. With an hour out at noon I was in the field steadily until six\r\no’clock. Then I ate supper and was in bed by eight-thirty so dog-tired\r\nI could hardly get undressed. And yet I woke up at daylight the next\r\nmorning completely rested and eager to be at it again. This was the\r\nkind of hard work that leaves no after effects. I continued to employ\r\nHadley, but without boasting I honestly believe I accomplished each day\r\nfour times as much as he did. I didn’t do this by unusual exertion,\r\nbut merely by keeping steadily at it and planning the work in a\r\nbusiness-like way. In my thought I kept one step ahead of my hands\r\nwhile he always kept one step behind and had to wait for his head to\r\ncatch up with him.\r\n\r\nI never felt more alert in body and mind than I did this spring. I was\r\nused to physical labor, but I found myself responding with even greater\r\nvigor now than when I was younger and digging for the subway as a day\r\nlaborer. For one thing I had none of the mental strain with which I was\r\nburdened then. Of course I was in a far better position financially and\r\neverything was going well with my own. Dick was making good and the\r\nkiddies were as rosy and plump as fall apples. Ruth, too, was happier\r\nthan I had ever seen her, so that while I took this new work seriously\r\nit was with a light-hearted seriousness that added to the zest of life.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we were holding a meeting of the Pioneers every two\r\nweeks in order that interest might not flag, and to discuss any\r\ndifficulties that arose. These gatherings were informal, and as time\r\nwent on had the effect of binding us together into one big family.\r\nSometimes I spoke and sometimes Holt spoke, and twice we had a man\r\ndown from the school. So far as it was possible we tried to prod up\r\neveryone’s pride. We told them that as descendants of the people who\r\nfounded this nation we had a certain responsibility of blood. We were\r\nstill the backbone of this nation, but this inheritance didn’t amount\r\nto anything unless we lived up to it. We tried to impress everyone\r\nwith the fact that other pioneers were coming in (and they saw this\r\nfor themselves) and that if we meant to retain our title and position\r\nit must be by proving ourselves worthy of it. We avoided carefully\r\nanything which might stir up class hatred.\r\n\r\n“The race is open to all,” said Holt. “It’s right that it should\r\nbe. A man wouldn’t have much of a horse race if he only allowed his\r\nown horses to enter--horses he was sure of. A victory wouldn’t mean\r\nanything. It would be like betting with yourself. It’s only in the\r\nfree-for-all that you get a real race and a real victory. We’ve made a\r\ngood start and now all we have to do is to sit tight and drive hard.”\r\n\r\nHolt had a catchy way of talking and always succeeded in putting the\r\ncrowd into good humor and also in throwing a glamour of romance over\r\neverything. We couldn’t have had a better man.\r\n\r\nBut as I said, the greatest good of these meetings came in the\r\ncommunity idea which was fostered. Associating here week after week\r\nfor a common purpose we began to feel friendly and intimate with\r\none another. Farmers are naturally an independent lot and the worse\r\nfarmers they are the more independent they are apt to be. Lack of\r\nsuccess instead of humbling them makes them even cockier, as it does\r\nfor that matter with people in any walk of life who have any backbone.\r\nThey find plenty of excuse for their failure outside themselves.\r\nNewspapers and muckraking magazine articles and politicians furnish\r\nthem with arguments enough to explain how they are being robbed and\r\nabused. These things sink in deep among farmers when they sink in at\r\nall, because they have time to think them over and digest them. But it\r\nsinks into them as individuals and not as a body. The result is that\r\nnot only do they become suspicious of the outside world but suspicious\r\nof one another. It makes them even more pronounced separate units.\r\nUp to a certain point this is not only a good thing but the best\r\npossible thing. It has preserved their individuality. Organization\r\nafter organization has tried to herd them together and reduce them\r\nto a mere class so as to drive them in one direction for their own\r\nselfish ends, but happily without result. They won’t be driven. Even\r\nthe organizations which have had a less sordid interest in the task\r\nhave failed to hold them together for any length of time, which in my\r\nopinion has saved them from being swallowed up.\r\n\r\nBut this independence is carried to extremes in the smaller communities\r\nand it was so in our town. Every man was suspicious of his neighbor.\r\nThough engaged in the same work and with many interests in common every\r\nman felt himself a competitor, not with the outside world, but with\r\nhis nearest neighbor. They wouldn’t pull together on anything.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t overcome this feeling in a minute but we did accomplish a lot\r\ntowards it even during this first summer. In a way this prize system\r\nmight be expected to increase individual competition, but even to the\r\nend of winning the prizes we forced everyone to work together which\r\nmore than made up.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before we all of us realized that we had opened up a\r\nfield even larger than any of us had dreamed. When we saw almost two\r\nhundred acres spring to life as a result of our initial effort; as we\r\nsaw front dooryards blossom with flower gardens and back dooryards\r\nbecome alive with truck gardens; as we saw orchard after orchard, which\r\nuntil now had been about as sightly as a patch of dead hemlocks, step\r\nforth trim and neat and full, not of dead hopes, but of big promise; as\r\nwe noted the absence of village loafers and grocery store hangers-on,\r\nwe caught an inkling of what a power we had set in motion. And the\r\njoy of it came in the realization that this was no new and imported\r\npower, but native energy which all the while had been here latent.\r\nThese acres, this labor which had been lying idle, was now waking\r\nup. It represented thousands of dollars when aroused and only so\r\nmany cents when dormant. A man couldn’t have come in here and bought\r\nthis plant--houses, barns, fields, stock, men, for much less than a\r\nmillion dollars at any time, and yet it hadn’t been worth to those who\r\npossessed it what it was taxed. Quick with life as it was now it was\r\ncoming to its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment my seeds began to show in tiny sprouts above the ground\r\nuntil the full grown produce was safely garnered, I lived with a hoe\r\nin my hands. Much to Hadley’s disgust I also kept a hoe in his hands\r\nmost of the time. I didn’t allow a weed either in my truck garden or my\r\npotato patch ever to get more than two inches high. Instead of hoeing\r\nonce I hoed a half dozen times. The advantage of this is not so much\r\nin keeping down the weeds as it is in stirring up the soil so that the\r\nearth keeps fresh and alive and porous. Hadley was disgusted.\r\n\r\n“Lawd-a-mighty,” he exclaimed, as we started for the potato patch with\r\nhoes over our shoulders for the fourth cultivation, “ye’ll hoe your\r\nstuff to death.”\r\n\r\n“You wait and see the results,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Ye b’lieve every darn thing them school teachers tell ye?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty nearly,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right for them to preach,” he said, “but I’ll bet a dollar to\r\na doughnut thet they’d quit preachin’ hoein’ mighty quick if ye gave\r\nthem this five-acre patch to hoe theirselves.”\r\n\r\nBut I was satisfied with results at the end of the first month. No one\r\ncould ask for hardier looking plants than I had. But Hadley was not\r\nconvinced even with this visible proof.\r\n\r\n“They’ve grown spite of ye,” he said. “Anyhow the tarnation bugs will\r\neat ’em up afore you’re through. Always do.”\r\n\r\nDoubtless they would if I had given my permission, but when I wasn’t\r\nhoeing I was spraying with Paris Green. More than this I went around\r\nwith a tin can and knocked off into this all those bugs which did\r\nsucceed in reaching maturity. A couple of sprayings a season was the\r\nmost anyone around here ever did. So long as the bugs were kept down\r\nenough not actually to kill the plants most people hereabout were\r\nsatisfied. I don’t believe an even hundred of the pests succeeded in\r\ngetting a square meal off my potatoes.\r\n\r\nNow in all this I insist, and it’s evident on the face of it, that such\r\nattention didn’t imply on my part any scientific knowledge of farming.\r\nI did what I was told to do and did it thoroughly. I did what it seems\r\nto me I should have known enough to do even if I hadn’t been told.\r\nYou can’t eat your cake and have it, too; you can’t let bugs eat your\r\npotatoes and have your potatoes, too. It was queer sort of reasoning\r\nthat until now had convinced my neighbors that this was possible. They\r\nhad almost fatalistic theories about farming. They seemed to think\r\nthat the most any man could do was to plant his seed and then trust to\r\nProvidence for what might result. This pious faith in the bounty of the\r\nAlmighty was fundamentally of course merely an unconscious excuse for\r\ntheir own laziness, but it seems to me it really must have been at the\r\nroot of their shiftlessness--an inheritance perhaps. Hadley was a fine\r\nexample of it. I gave up early in the season trying to inspire him even\r\nwith the help of the prizes. He did plant a few hills of corn but he\r\nrefused to hoe them more than once.\r\n\r\nNow what I did myself, a large part of my neighbors were also doing in\r\na more or less earnest way. The young men I found were doing more than\r\nthe old men. The latter had taken advice in the matter of fertilizers\r\nand seeds but it came hard to them to give the later attention to\r\ntheir crops that I did. However, it was possible to see a general and\r\nnotable improvement even in this. The semi-monthly meetings did much to\r\nspur them on and the noticeable results which followed their efforts\r\nalso did something more. Some of them remained skeptical, but both\r\nHolt and myself insisted that they must keep at it until the end of\r\nthe season. We never missed a chance to dangle before their eyes the\r\nprize money. Holt did one clever thing that had a very good effect. He\r\nsecured one hundred crisp new dollar bills and kept them displayed in\r\nthe window of Moulton’s grocery store with a sign over them which read:\r\n\r\n  “ONLY ONE OF THE TEN PRIZES.”\r\n\r\nThe display of so much money caught the eye of everyone who passed.\r\nMore than that about everyone in town who was competing went down and\r\nhad a look at it every so often. It acted like a tonic to many a man\r\nwho was getting disheartened by the amount of labor involved in the new\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nHolt and I made a rough estimate of the land now under cultivation\r\nthat last year was idle and figured that it amounted to about one\r\nhundred and eighty acres. In addition to this there was of course the\r\nland that was always farmed to a more or less extent amounting to some\r\ntwo hundred acres more. Out of this last lot there wasn’t an acre that\r\ndidn’t show improvement over the year before.\r\n\r\nThe new hundred and eighty acres counted for a lot more in value than\r\nshows in the mere statement, because it included gardens for nearly\r\neveryone in the village and this meant an actual saving in cash for\r\nevery householder from the moment the produce began to mature. Moulton\r\nnoted the effect of this when as usual he started to bring in early\r\nvegetables from the city market. He had all he could do to get rid of\r\nthe first lot and after that gave it up. No one wanted city vegetables\r\nwith the prospect ahead of vegetables of their own. Martin, the local\r\nbutcher, also noticed the effect in a way he didn’t like. He was the\r\nonly man in the village who opposed us and he can’t be blamed, for his\r\nmeat sales began to fall off in June and dropped fifty per cent. during\r\nJuly and August. With green peas to be had for the picking, followed\r\nby string beans, new potatoes, green corn, turnips, parsnips, beets,\r\nshell beans and what not, most people thought twice before paying him\r\nforty cents a pound for rump steak. Personally I’d like to have seen\r\nhim put out of business, for he was a robber if ever there was one. He\r\nhad set me to wondering a long while before this why it wasn’t possible\r\nfor us to raise our own meat. With plenty of corn and hay upon which\r\nto feed our cattle, with grazing ground for sheep, with practically\r\neveryone able to keep his own pig on ordinary waste I didn’t see any\r\nreason why in the end we shouldn’t make use of this opportunity. Our\r\nforefathers raised whatever meat they needed and I believed we could do\r\nit to-day. This was one of the things I resolved to bring up at one of\r\nthe fall meetings.\r\n\r\nBut when crops began to mature we were confronted with another and more\r\nurgent problem. Just as soon as the green peas began to come along we\r\nrealized that we were face to face with the problem of distribution.\r\nWe had killed the local market, which was decidedly a good thing. In\r\none sense we hadn’t killed it, for now every man was supplying himself,\r\nbut we had killed it for our surplus. It didn’t take me long to see\r\nthat this would be wasted, for all that a majority of the individuals\r\nthemselves might do. The farmers were helpless partly because they had\r\nno selling knowledge and partly because it was almost impossible for\r\nthem to get produce to the market and sell at a profit in small lots.\r\nHolt and I made a round of the commission merchants in town and the\r\nvery best we could do with any of them was at a price forty per cent.\r\nbelow retail. We figured that transportation would eat up another ten\r\nper cent. which left the man who raised the crop some fifty per cent.\r\nThis was dead wrong on the face of it, but we didn’t have any time to\r\nargue the point and it wouldn’t have done us any good if we had. As we\r\nwere now situated, fifty per cent. was better than nothing. However,\r\nthis opened my eyes to some of the reasons why in the suburbs we\r\ncouldn’t make both ends meet.\r\n\r\nI called a special meeting of the club and told the members what I\r\nhad learned and outlined the plan Holt and I had devised to save what\r\nwe could. The situation had come unexpectedly and was due of course\r\nto our ignorance. We didn’t realize it at the time but as it happened\r\nthis crisis was the best thing that could have come about. It forced\r\nus on the spur of the moment and at the psychological moment into a\r\nplan that promised to develop big things in the end; the coöperative\r\nselling plan. I proposed that every member of the club should gather\r\nearly each morning such things as were fit for the market over what he\r\ncouldn’t use himself and bring them to my barn. There the produce would\r\nbe measured and sorted and each man given a credit slip. A committee\r\nof three was to be appointed by the club to oversee without pay this\r\nwork for a week. The committee would hire a team to transport the goods\r\nto the early train which left at five fifteen. At the end of each week\r\nan accounting would be made, the cost of transportation deducted and\r\nprofits distributed pro rata. I offered to look after the bookkeeping\r\nmyself if the club so desired and at the next meeting this task was\r\ndelegated to me.\r\n\r\nNow it is possible that in advance of the present urgent situation\r\nwhich demanded that they accept this or nothing, a minority at least\r\nmight have viewed this scheme with suspicion. They were not used to\r\ndoing things in a body and the novelty of it, like all novelties, might\r\nhave frightened them. As it was, the plan was received with instant\r\nenthusiasm and when put to a vote carried without a single dissenting\r\nvoice. Anyway if a man disapproved all he had to do was not to bring\r\nin his produce. The action of the club didn’t bind a man to anything\r\nexcept to abide by results if he chose to contribute his stuff.\r\n\r\nWe appointed three men to appear at my barn at four o’clock the next\r\nmorning. They turned up on time and by four-fifteen the produce began\r\nto arrive. Everyone brought what he had, whether it was a bushel\r\nof sweet corn, a peck of beans, a dozen heads of lettuce, a half\r\ndozen cucumbers or a barrel of apples or potatoes. In most cases the\r\nindividual lots didn’t amount to much but collectively we made a good\r\nshowing that first morning. We had enough to fill a two horse load. I\r\nwent to the station and supervised the loading myself and then went\r\non to the market with it. Barnes, the commission man, looked it over\r\nand admitted that he was well pleased on his part with the venture.\r\nAt the end of the first week I received a check for four hundred and\r\neighty-three dollars and sixty-five cents--not in itself a large amount\r\nor as much as it should have been, but when considered as money,\r\na large per cent. of which would otherwise have gone to waste, a\r\ncreditable showing.\r\n\r\nAnd really the working out of the scheme as it continued from week to\r\nweek was wonderfully simple. There was nothing either difficult or\r\ncomplicated about it. The three men appointed every week gave about\r\ntwo hours of their time for six days which in no way interfered with\r\ntheir farm duties. They all looked upon their selection as an honor and\r\nrather enjoyed their position.\r\n\r\nNor was my part of it burdensome. I received an itemized accounting\r\nfrom Barnes and had nothing to do but divide these items as the dated\r\ncredit slips were produced. I didn’t even have to do that, for Ruth\r\ndid the figuring herself. Before the end of the season we found we had\r\nhandled thirty-eight hundred dollars, but this included the apple and\r\npotato crop which went through us. And there wasn’t a single kick or\r\ncomplaint heard during the whole business.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as the end of the season approached, the matter of\r\nthe prize distribution loomed big. I wanted to make the most of that\r\nevent. I wanted it to be a big spectacular finish that would cling in\r\nthe minds of all during the ensuing winter. The committee held several\r\nmeetings to discuss the best way of doing this and we finally hit upon\r\nthe idea of an old-time country fair. There hadn’t been one in town for\r\ntwenty years because the last ones held had degenerated into nothing\r\nbut two-cent horse races in which the prizes had all been carried off\r\nby semi-professionals. The chief objection to the plan was the lack of\r\nfair grounds. The old society had gone into bankruptcy and sold off\r\nwhat property it had and the grounds had since then grown up to scrub\r\npine. Ruth solved the difficulty by suggesting that we go back again\r\nto the early days for our idea. Originally the fairs were held on the\r\nvillage green. In fact, in parts of New England they still are to-day.\r\nHer idea was to revive this custom in our town.\r\n\r\nThe idea had several advantages, not the least of which was that it\r\nincurred no expense, and met with instant approval. We appointed a\r\ncommittee to look after the details, a second committee to arrange a\r\nfield day for the youngsters, and a third committee with Ruth at its\r\nhead to arrange some sort of entertainment for the women.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t leave them out,” Ruth insisted. “They play a more\r\nimportant part in this work than you imagine.”\r\n\r\nWe had arranged with the Agricultural School to send down men to act\r\nas judges so that everything should be judged impartially. A man had\r\ncome down just before the haying season and had overseen the weighing\r\non the town scales of all hay entered for the competition. Quality and\r\nquantity were the two things taken into account for the best crop on\r\nland already used for that purpose, while the prize for the best crop\r\non reclaimed land required a somewhat nicer judgment. The nature of the\r\nland here had to be considered. When the expert had completed his work\r\nhe made his report and placed it in a sealed envelope which was not to\r\nbe opened until the public award.\r\n\r\nThis same method was used in making the awards for the most notable\r\nimprovement in orchards, for the best corn crop and the best potato\r\ncrop. As for the other prizes the committee itself acted as judges.\r\nThe results here were a matter of self-evident facts. In the live\r\nstock competition each man was required to show a receipted bill for\r\nall money expended and a record of some sort for all money received.\r\nThe garden competition had to be judged in a more general way, as it\r\nwas observed by the committee during the entire season. I had put a\r\ngood deal of time into this myself and it had been a genuine pleasure.\r\nThere was hardly a family in the village who didn’t have a garden\r\nof some sort that year, for even those who didn’t intend to compete\r\ncaught the contagion and planted something. I wish there had been some\r\nway of computing the saving in cash that resulted from this alone. It\r\ncertainly amounted to a good many times the money which had inspired\r\nthe movement. It seems almost impossible of belief that to many\r\nresidents of this country village the raising of their own green stuff\r\nwas a decided novelty. But such is the fact. With a man coming daily\r\nto the door, as until this season Tony and others had done, with peas,\r\nlettuce, corn, cucumbers and what not, people had bought of him as a\r\nmatter of convenience. It had cost them only a little at a time and\r\nthey hadn’t realized to how much the sum total amounted.\r\n\r\nI know that Ruth and I found a big difference in our household expenses\r\nonce the garden began to bear. Not only this but we did away with meat\r\nalmost entirely and never lived so well in our lives. In addition to\r\nwhat I used myself I loaded down Dick’s machine every morning with such\r\nstuff as couldn’t be put away for winter use, to be distributed among\r\nmembers of the gang--among families with children or those temporarily\r\nin hard luck through sickness. Moulton was certainly mistaken when he\r\nhad prophesied that it would cost me more to raise than buy my own\r\nvegetables. But he hadn’t planned on any such modern methods as I and\r\nthe whole village used that season.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the day for the fair grew nearer the town became on edge with\r\nexcitement. Here was a holiday which appealed to everyone, whether\r\nfarmer or not. It brought the whole village together as a unit. I was\r\nsurprised to find how much local spirit really existed below all the\r\napparent indifference. I found there wasn’t a man or woman who didn’t\r\nhave some town pride, however slight. The trouble was that they seldom\r\nhad an opportunity to express it. Holt kept up a running fire of\r\ncomment in the local paper, which was glad to give us all the space\r\nwe wished. It made the most readable and inexpensive copy they had\r\nreceived for a long time. We also got out posters and distributed them\r\namong the neighboring towns, bidding everyone come as guests of the\r\nvillage. Every merchant decorated his store a week in advance and the\r\nWoodmen band in anticipation of the event practiced new pieces every\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nRuth secured the town hall for the women and arranged there for an\r\nexhibition of New England cooking, preserving and needle work, which\r\ninstantly gave the women an active interest in the undertaking. She\r\nalso arranged to serve here a free lunch of coffee, sandwiches and\r\ncakes to out-of-town visitors. Her committee decorated the interior of\r\nthe old building with wild flowers and flowers from the home gardens,\r\nwith a background of evergreens gathered by the small boys.\r\n\r\nWe received requests for street privileges from a number of fakirs\r\nand sold these for enough to purchase settees to go around the band\r\nstand. We used some care, however, in giving out our permits and barred\r\nall gambles of whatever kind. About a dozen came into town the day\r\nbefore and erected their booths which gave the village still more of\r\na holiday aspect. That night there wasn’t a livelier village in the\r\nState. It was so full of anticipation that I don’t believe more than\r\nhalf the population got their full night’s sleep for the first time in\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n“Are we dead yet?” demanded Holt of Ruth as he prepared to leave us\r\nlong after midnight and after being up since four A. M.\r\n\r\n“Some of you will be if you don’t go right home this minute and get\r\nsome sleep,” she answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA GREAT DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of October first dawned cool and clear with just frost\r\nenough in the air to make everyone feel as fit as a fighting cock. As\r\nearly as seven o’clock carriage loads of people passed my house from\r\nthe neighboring villages. Old men and young came, women and children,\r\nglad of an excuse no matter how slight to journey to a common meeting\r\nplace and see and be seen. They came from as far away as twenty miles\r\nand people who had not met for ten years took this opportunity to visit\r\nwith one another. Former residents, friends of present residents and\r\ntotal strangers poured into town, obeying the instinct to herd together\r\nfor a day. The whole village kept open house and so far as it was\r\npossible we tried to have everything free--to act as a town as hosts.\r\nI for my part extended a general invitation to the gang and all my old\r\nfriends from Little Italy and spread a big table in the barn for them\r\nbecause there wasn’t room in the house. As many as seventy-five women\r\nand children came in the afternoon, while that evening about the whole\r\ngang came along. They pretty nearly ate us out of house and home but I\r\nhad a big bonfire built in the yard and in this they roasted apples and\r\npotatoes when everything else was gone.\r\n\r\nThe prize award was set for eleven o’clock and for an hour before the\r\nband gave a concert. At the conclusion of this I estimated that fully\r\nnine hundred people were gathered around the band stand. It was as\r\nintense and excited a gathering as you ever saw. Not an inkling of\r\nwho had won the prizes leaked out although in most cases the general\r\ndiscussion and known facts had narrowed the possibilities down to a\r\nhalf dozen in each class. I myself didn’t know the winners except in\r\nthe cases where I acted as judge. When the band finished its programme\r\nwith “America” and Holt and the committee and the judges from the\r\nAgricultural School who were present as guests, and myself stepped to\r\nthe platform you could have heard a pin drop. As president of the club\r\nit was my duty to make a brief speech and in this I outlined for the\r\nbenefit of strangers present the object of the club, the money that\r\nhad been offered, what had been accomplished and on what basis the\r\nawards were to be made.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” I said at the end, “that every man and woman and boy\r\nwho is a member of this club ought to feel that he has won something\r\nwhether he draws a money prize or not.”\r\n\r\nThis was greeted with noisy cheering which it did my heart good to hear.\r\n\r\n“Every one of you who planted a seed and cared for it has reaped the\r\nreward of seeing it multiply at a rate possible in no other business.\r\nNature is the grand prize giver. Every farmer ought to consider himself\r\na partner with Nature--with God. Men give you for the use of a dollar\r\nfor one year four cents, possibly five or six cents; Nature gives us\r\nfor a dollar’s worth of seed as high as a thousand and two thousand\r\nper cent. There isn’t a family in this village who planted a garden\r\nlast spring who hasn’t been paid by Nature in produce representing good\r\nhard cash the wages of a skilled artisan. We’ve had all we wanted to\r\neat, some of us have put away enough for the winter and over and above\r\nthat we have sold in garden stuff alone thirty-eight hundred dollars’\r\nworth. And that doesn’t represent the sum total of our products by\r\na good deal. So I insist that we’ve all won richer prizes than any\r\noffered here to-day. And with the knowledge we’ve gained this year I\r\nlook to see this result doubled next year. I look to see our farms grow\r\nbetter and better with good care; I look to see our orchards improve; I\r\nlook to see us raise all our own beef and mutton and pork and the grain\r\nto feed the stock upon. I look to see us do all our hardy ancestors did\r\nand with opportunities such as they never dreamed of wax so prosperous\r\nthat men in the business world outside will be forced to reckon with us\r\nand give us the position that is our right--abreast of the leaders in\r\nthe productive enterprises of the world. This bit of extra money here,\r\nin spite of all that Mr. Holt would have us believe, doesn’t represent\r\nour goal. We’ve attained that already, and this is only just so much\r\nmore pin money. We’ve proven as individuals, we’ve proven as a club,\r\nwe’ve proven as a town, that farming can be made to pay. To prove that\r\nis to have received our pay.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t want any soreness left as a result of disappointed hopes and\r\nso when I heard my words received with shouts and handclapping and\r\nsmiling faces I was very glad. I reached for the first sealed envelope\r\nand tore it open. The noise subsided until you could have heard a pin\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\n“For the best crop of hay on one acre of fresh broken land the prize is\r\none hundred dollars in cash. It gives me pleasure to announce that this\r\nhas been awarded to Horatio L. Harrison.”\r\n\r\nI saw Harrison’s face. It went white, then red. A good many other faces\r\nwent white, too, and for a second there was an ominous silence. Then\r\nHolt sprang to the front of the platform.\r\n\r\n“Fellow citizens,” he shouted, “let’s give three cheers for Harrison.\r\nNow--hurrah!”\r\n\r\nPerhaps fifty voices joined him. At the second hurrah a hundred came\r\nin, while at the third the whole crowd let themselves loose in a\r\nfashion that was good to hear.\r\n\r\n“Tiger,” shouted Holt.\r\n\r\nAnd it came full throated from nine hundred people. Then someone called\r\nfor Harrison--he was a young man of thirty--and before he could escape\r\nhe had been pushed to the platform. Holt seized an arm and drew him\r\nup while a dozen others boosted him. He faced the crowd an instant and\r\nbowed. I handed him his money in greenbacks and he ducked out of sight.\r\n\r\nI took up the second envelope and opened it.\r\n\r\n“For the best crop of hay on an acre of land already used as hay land\r\nthe prize is seventy-five dollars. This has been awarded to Seth Edgar\r\nLovejoy.”\r\n\r\nLovejoy was a man of sixty and one of those who had followed the\r\ninstructions of the agricultural expert in the matter of proper\r\nfertilization with constant grumbling. I think his idea had been to\r\nprove what a tarnation fool the expert was. In spite of this, however,\r\nhe had succeeded in raising a ton and three-quarters of hay on an acre\r\nthat last year had yielded him less than one ton. I was more than glad\r\ntherefore for this award as it left him nothing more to say. At my\r\nannouncement the younger men cheered lustily and demanded a speech from\r\nhim--calling him by his nickname Killjoy.\r\n\r\n“Tell us how ye done it in spite of yerself,” yelled one man.\r\n\r\nLovejoy, much against his will, was forced to the platform, Holt\r\ndragging him up as he had Harrison. He faced the crowd a second in a\r\ndaze.\r\n\r\n“I dunno,” he muttered, “it’s th’ only piece of luck I ever hed.”\r\n\r\n“Not luck,” broke in Holt. “Science and hard work did it. Three cheers\r\nfor Lovejoy who wasn’t too old to learn.”\r\n\r\nThey were given good naturedly and I opened the third envelope.\r\n\r\n“Prize of one hundred dollars for the best crop of corn on an acre of\r\nland. This has been awarded to George A. Wentworth.”\r\n\r\nEveryone expected this. Wentworth was a lad of eighteen who had devoted\r\nhis whole time to this one acre of corn and had watched over every\r\nstalk of it like a widow with one child. Where ordinarily twenty\r\nbushels to the acre was considered a fair crop about here, he had\r\nreaped thirty-seven--an increase of almost one hundred per cent. I had\r\nwatched the boy all summer long. He was the type of young man we needed\r\nhereabout. He was earnest, industrious and with ambition to make a\r\ngood living. His father had a farm of some seventy acres which wasn’t\r\nmore than forty per cent. efficient and I hoped to see the boy come\r\ninto possession of it. He had confided in me that if he won a prize\r\nhe was going to buy a couple of acres of his father. The selection was\r\npopular and he was given a great ovation. He was the only man so far\r\nwho was able to reach the platform unaided but perhaps he had learned\r\nfrom the previous examples the uselessness of protest. Those who hadn’t\r\nwon were anxious to get as much sport as possible out of those who had.\r\nHolt seized his arm and addressed the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Here’s the type of boy who’s going to be one of the big men of this\r\ntown some day,” he said. “And it’s going to mean something to be a big\r\nman in this town, for this is going to be a big town. Three cheers for\r\nthe boy who knows enough to stay East. Now--let ’em out!”\r\n\r\nHolt was proving that a college education was good for one thing at\r\nleast; it taught him how to get noise out of a crowd. Leaning over the\r\nrail with his two fists clenched and his arms swinging he looked as\r\nthough he were forcing every man to shout in spite of himself. I know I\r\njoined in this time and the sedate committee back of me clapped their\r\nhands noisily. As for Dick and Ruth they stood up on their seats and\r\nshouted, looking straight into Holt’s eyes as though hypnotized. I\r\nhanded Wentworth his crisp new bills and saw that there were tears in\r\nhis eyes. It certainly does stir a man to hear eight or nine hundred\r\npeople shouting his name as these people did.\r\n\r\nThe fourth envelope contained the name of the winner of the best house\r\ngarden. Seventy-five dollars was the prize. I had largely to do with\r\nthis selection. I waited until there was a dead silence and then\r\nannounced: “It gives me great pleasure to report that this prize has\r\nbeen awarded to Mrs. Lydia A. Cumberland.”\r\n\r\nI think this came as a surprise, for nearly every man in the village\r\nhad considered himself a possible winner in this event. My own garden\r\napproached the nearest of anyone’s to hers and in the matter of the\r\namount raised really excelled Mrs. Cumberland’s. However, I was of\r\ncourse automatically barred from the competition, owing to my position\r\nas judge. Mrs. Cumberland had planted about a half acre in the rear\r\nof her house. This soil was naturally rich and she had bestowed\r\ninfinite pains upon her plants. She was a widow with two children and\r\nhad supplied her own table out of the produce, put up in glass jars\r\nalmost enough vegetables to last her through the winter and made a few\r\ndollars’ profit in cash besides. I particularly wished to encourage\r\nthis practice of putting up our own vegetables for winter use and I had\r\nbrought here with me a sample jar of each vegetable. When the cheering\r\nsubsided I held up a jar of peas.\r\n\r\n“Look at them,” I said.\r\n\r\nThen I did the same with a jar of string beans, a jar of turnips,\r\nof squash, of pickled small beets. Each exhibition was greeted with\r\ncheering.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Holt had found Mrs. Cumberland, and with her arm\r\nthrough his was escorting her up the steps to the platform. She was\r\na dear, lovable lady of fifty with shy, gentle manners that won\r\neveryone’s heart. As she approached, every man including the band rose\r\nto his feet and faced her standing.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” she choked.\r\n\r\nHolt led her to a position in front of the crowd.\r\n\r\n“The mother of our future pioneers--a pioneer herself,” he said with\r\nfine feeling.\r\n\r\nThen without any prompting on his part the crowd let itself loose. She\r\ntook out a little white handkerchief and waved it a second. Then she\r\npressed it to her eyes and shied back, and Holt stepping in front of\r\nher shielded her from further view of the audience.\r\n\r\nIt was fine--fine. I don’t know what there is about such little\r\nincidents to so touch the heart of a gathering of men and women but I\r\ndo know they are mighty good for men and women. There wasn’t a person\r\nthere who wasn’t left mellowed and almost hallowed by those few tense\r\nseconds. In and of itself and apart from all else we had done, this was\r\nworth all our labor. It sweetened the whole of us and left us with a\r\nfiner human feeling.\r\n\r\nThe prize for the best market garden went to Higginbotham and the prize\r\nfor the best flower garden went to Mildred Cunningham, the minister’s\r\ndaughter. You ought to have seen the pride with which Cunningham\r\nescorted the girl to the platform. The man since the inception of the\r\nmovement had really done what he could to help us both in his sermons\r\nand his rounds of the parish. But to my mind the little girl had done\r\nmore than he. I’d give more any time for a person who actually gets\r\ninto a forward movement than one who merely talks about it. She had\r\nkept half the sick people of the village supplied with posies all\r\nsummer long.\r\n\r\nThe seventh envelope contained the winner of the prize for the\r\nbest potato crop--one hundred dollars. I hadn’t any idea whom the\r\nAgricultural School experts had decided upon. I tore open the envelope\r\nand read automatically as follows:\r\n\r\n“For the best crop of potatoes raised upon an acre of land--one hundred\r\ndollars. It gives me great pleasure to announce as the winner--”\r\n\r\nThen I stopped. I couldn’t believe my own eyes. The name which followed\r\nwas my own.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” someone yelled impatiently.\r\n\r\n“I think there must be some mistake,” I said, turning to the judge. “I\r\ndidn’t consider myself a competitor.”\r\n\r\n“Name! Name!” came a chorus.\r\n\r\n“Name!” insisted Holt.\r\n\r\nI turned to the crowd.\r\n\r\n“The name is William Carleton,” I said, “But I don’t feel--”\r\n\r\nI didn’t get any farther. The crowd began to cheer and Holt stepped\r\nforward to egg them on. When the clamor died down a little, Holt seized\r\nmy arm. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he announced, “Mr. William Carleton--a\r\nfarmer from the city but now a citizen of the farm. He’s the greatest\r\npioneer of us all. I’ve seen his potato field and watched him care for\r\nit until I almost wished I was a potato. He’s done everything except\r\nmake feather beds for ’em and tuck ’em in at night. Three cheers more\r\nfor Pioneer Carleton.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could get my voice I responded.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad of the honor,” I said, “I don’t remember anything which has\r\never made me feel prouder. I shall always remember this. But, the\r\nhundred dollars I want to turn back right here to the Pioneer Club.”\r\n\r\nIt was a minute or two after I had torn open the eighth envelope before\r\nI could make myself heard. This was a prize of one hundred dollars\r\nfor the largest return from chickens according to capital invested.\r\nThis went to Guy Holborne, who had invested eighteen dollars for six\r\nPlymouth Rocks with a rooster, five dollars in eggs to set and three\r\ndollars in miscellaneous expenses. He had sold five dollars’ worth of\r\neggs up to date and had sixty fine pullets worth seventy-five cents a\r\npiece ready for the market. He had fed his chickens largely on waste\r\ncollected from his neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe prize for the largest return from cows according to capital\r\ninvested went to Ebenezer Blunt, the prize for the largest return from\r\npigs to Arthur Libby and the prize for the most notable improvement in\r\nan old orchard was divided between Henderson and Talbot, two of our\r\nlargest land owners. They followed my example and turned the money back\r\nto the Pioneer Club.\r\n\r\nAs the last announcement was made Holt roused the band and they played\r\n“America,” everyone standing.\r\n\r\nThe athletic events under Dick’s direction followed and kept the crowd\r\namused until dinner time. During the afternoon the fakirs did a brisk\r\nbusiness while the town hall was packed until dark. A goodly number\r\nof automobiles loaded with city folks anxious to see an old-fashioned\r\ncountry fair came and went, adding to the general holiday atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt was late that night before I really had a chance to talk over things\r\nwith Ruth.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said when we were alone, “how did it go?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t see how it could have gone any better,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“That was a great move of Holt’s in leading the cheering,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Fine! Fine!”\r\n\r\n“Think the decisions left any hard feelings?”\r\n\r\n“Only the usual per cent., Billy,” she answered, “and they won’t last.\r\nI heard most of them talking about what they were going to do next\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the stuff,” I said.\r\n\r\n“You see they had worked out the results pretty well for themselves\r\nbefore the announcement. No; it has been a success--a success from\r\nbeginning to end.”\r\n\r\n“And the women?”\r\n\r\n“There isn’t one who isn’t going to bed to-night tired and happy.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t unusual for them to go to bed tired,” I said.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“But you can be tired in twenty different ways,” she said. “And this is\r\nthe kind of tired that’s good for them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nNEW VENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s natural to be over optimistic in the first flush of success in a\r\nnew venture, but in this case there was no reaction. Outside of the\r\nfinancial success the experiment had been for every member of the club,\r\nwhich meant practically every member of the village, our most notable\r\nachievement had been in rousing the community spirit. We had all got\r\ntogether in a fashion that distinguished us from our neighboring towns.\r\nPeople from outside began to speak of us residents of Brewster as\r\nBrewsterites, which to my mind was significant. If our prize system\r\nhadn’t accomplished any more than this it had been worth while. This\r\nwas just the spirit we wanted as a basis for working out more in detail\r\nour pioneer idea. Ruth and I hadn’t forgotten our lesson from the\r\npioneers of Little Italy, that half the secret of earning more money\r\nis to save more money, and that to do this means a simpler standard\r\nof living. This was one of the things that I had talked over with Holt\r\nand Barclay and the committee with the result of a hearty endorsement\r\nfrom Holt, a mild endorsement from Barclay, and an agreement from the\r\ncommittee not to oppose. They all admitted anyway that something must\r\nbe done to keep interest alive during the long winter months.\r\n\r\nNow I had no definite plan in mind beyond a vague notion to rouse if\r\npossible an interest in the romantic lives of our ancestors--to bring\r\nhome to those of to-day the possibility of making our own lives just\r\nas romantic and independent and venturesome. Whatever we accomplished\r\ngrew out of talks between Holt, Ruth and myself, but to a still larger\r\ndegree out of incidents that grew out of the undertaking itself. Our\r\nwhole enterprise developed from within itself. We planned nothing\r\nexcept along general lines and forced nothing.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is one thing that turned up unexpectedly. Holt came\r\nto me one day and said he had run across a moving picture man who was\r\nin town with a view to installing a moving picture show. The latter had\r\nbeen to Moulton, who owned the opera house beneath which his store was\r\nlocated, and had tried to make a bargain with him to rent the hall.\r\n\r\n“Why in thunder don’t we do it ourselves?” was Holt’s question to me.\r\n\r\n“As a personal business venture?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“As a business venture for the club,” he answered. “There’s no doubt\r\nbut what a moving picture show is going to be started here sooner or\r\nlater. You can’t prevent it. If an outsider conducts the business he\r\ncarries off the good money of our members, he forces us to buck against\r\na rival interest and he runs any old films he chooses. If we run it\r\nourselves we can make it part of our winter’s amusement, select our\r\nfilms, and turn back into the club treasury everything over running\r\nexpenses.”\r\n\r\n“And if we lose?”\r\n\r\n“We can’t lose. Wouldn’t do any harm to try it anyway, and if we do\r\nlose it’s a safe bet it would scare off any outsider from ever trying\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nHolt’s argument seemed sound. The capital required was not much;\r\nenough to pay the rent of the hall which we had to hire once in two\r\nweeks anyway and the price of installing the plant which was only a\r\nmatter of a few hundred dollars. But the most attractive feature was\r\nthe opportunity this would give us to select films that would serve\r\nour ends--picture plays of the landing of the Pilgrims, Indian fights\r\nand what not to say nothing of purely educational features on plant\r\ngrowing, proper sanitation and so on. Then the negative side was also\r\nworth something--the chance to cut out the plays that might have an\r\nunwholesome tendency. The more I thought of this the better the idea\r\nseemed, so that I offered to advance the necessary capital without\r\ninterest to be paid back out of the profits--if any there were.\r\n\r\nWe put the matter before the club at the next semi-monthly meeting and\r\nthe idea received enthusiastic endorsement, as it naturally might be\r\nexpected to do when it promised amusement, a possible profit and no\r\nrisk. Whereupon we closed with Moulton and opened negotiations with\r\na leading film house for the lease of a machine. Holt undertook the\r\nbusiness management of the enterprise and nothing could have suited him\r\nbetter. He was a born publicity man.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to make the neighboring towns pay most of the running\r\nexpenses,” he declared.\r\n\r\n“How?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“You wait and see.”\r\n\r\nI waited and did see. He ran two shows a week--one on Wednesday\r\nwhich he called Pioneer Club night, and one on Saturday evening. The\r\nfilms for both were identical but for the Wednesday night show he\r\ncharged members of the Pioneer Club only five cents’ admission with\r\nthe result that they filled every available seat in the hall. The\r\nSaturday night show cost ten cents and being a repetition of the first\r\nnaturally didn’t attract but a few of the members. But he plastered the\r\nneighboring towns within a radius of ten miles with green handbills\r\nthat again filled his hall. He let himself loose on these and had as\r\nmuch fun as a schoolboy out of his attempts to whet curiosity.\r\n\r\nWe held our semi-monthly meetings on two of the four Wednesday\r\nnights and on this occasion had one or more of the films as a free\r\nentertainment following the business meeting. It was in connection with\r\nthis that we also inaugurated our pioneer talks.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning Holt and I were the speakers, although later as our\r\ntreasury grew fat with the proceeds of our picture show we used some\r\nof the money to bring in lyceum lecturers and at least once a month\r\nsome specialist from the Agricultural School. Our subjects were limited\r\neither to American pioneer history of the East or to practical talks\r\non farming. One thing we insisted upon was that they must be put into\r\npopular and entertaining form. For instance, I in my first talk had as\r\nmy subject “Early Tillers of New England Soil.” I spent a good deal\r\nof time at the city public library in looking up my material, picking\r\nout interesting facts about the nature of the soil at that time, the\r\nimplements in use, the difficulties that had to be overcome and the\r\nresults obtained. I put a good deal of emphasis on the difficulties as\r\ncompared with those of to-day and yet pointed out how cheerfully the\r\nearly settlers went at their task because they worked at it in freedom.\r\nIn connection with this we ran a film that was supposed to describe\r\nthe departure of the Pilgrims from England and their landing in this\r\ncountry. It was wonderfully vivid and made it seem almost like an event\r\nof yesterday.\r\n\r\nHolt treated in much the same fashion “The Fighting Spirit of Our\r\nAncestors.” I tell you he made a warrior of every man in the audience\r\nbefore he was through and a warrior’s mother of every woman. We ran\r\nwith this a realistic Indian fight film.\r\n\r\nAt another talk Ruth spoke on the “Women of Early New England,”\r\ndescribing their lives and their work and what the women of to-day\r\nowed to them. “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” was the film we used\r\nwith this and it was so popular that it led later on to the acting of\r\na series of tableaux founded on Longfellow’s poem. This was the big\r\nsocial event of the winter, coming at Christmas time and ending with a\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum speakers took up various phases of New England life in a\r\nmore scholarly fashion, and all were well received. But the serious\r\nwork of the winter came with the lecturers from the Agricultural School\r\nwho considered the subject of live stock in New England--an interesting\r\nquestion if not a particularly romantic one. They discussed the matter\r\nof why we should raise our own meats instead of importing them from\r\nthe West. And really, for a community like ours, there didn’t seem to\r\nbe anything at all to be said against the proposition. If there were\r\nobvious objections to keeping chickens, pigs, and cows in a tenement,\r\nthey certainly didn’t hold here. And yet there hadn’t been a steer\r\nraised for meat in our town for twenty-five years. We didn’t even raise\r\nthe corn to feed our cows on. Even pigs were scarce, while eggs and\r\nchickens were actually bought to a large extent from the city market.\r\nOn the face of it nothing could seem more absurd. With land enough and\r\nlabor enough to supply ourselves we allowed ourselves to be supplied\r\nfrom land several thousand miles away. And it wasn’t because we got our\r\ngoods cheaper. We paid prices that almost drove us into bankruptcy. We\r\nmight with as much logic have imported our water.\r\n\r\nNow the only explanation of this that anyone could see was that\r\nconvenience, which is another word for laziness, had led us into the\r\nhabit and this habit had become so fixed that it now seemed like a\r\nnecessity. Of course it wasn’t argued that we could raise meat on any\r\nsuch wholesale scale as is done in the West where the plains furnish\r\nfree fodder, or in the corn belt where corn could be raised at a price\r\nfor stock feeding impossible to us. But raising enough to supply at\r\nleast the home market didn’t involve those conditions. There wasn’t a\r\nman with a farm who couldn’t feed a portion of his hay and corn to\r\nbeef to better advantage than he could sell it, who didn’t have grazing\r\nland available for that purpose that at present was only growing up\r\nto useless small growth. Even when balanced against the question of\r\nwhether the feed couldn’t at a better profit be turned into milk, a\r\nfield was still left open for beef enough to supply the local market.\r\n\r\nAnother lecturer took up the matter of sheep raising. It wasn’t so very\r\nlong ago that every farmer in New England had a small flock of sheep as\r\nmuch as a matter of course as he had a horse. To-day with the price of\r\nmutton and lamb soaring, with wool at a premium, a flock of sheep on a\r\nNew England farm is a curiosity.\r\n\r\nNow if there were dearth of land, if the advancing population from\r\nthe cities had sent up real estate values this would be a perfectly\r\nnatural result. But the exact opposite is the case. The deserted farms\r\nsprinkled all through New England, farms left to grow up to waste\r\ntimber, farms on the market for a song, would seem to prove that much.\r\nIdle pasture land around such farms as are worked further disproves\r\nthat it isn’t lack of land that has brought this about. Then what in\r\nHeaven’s name is the cause of this wasted opportunity?\r\n\r\nI can answer only so far as I studied the men about me. The opening of\r\nthe big western grazing fields did at first have its effect in sending\r\ndown eastern values of live stock. Thousands of sheep fed by nature\r\npermitted a price even with a terrible waste, even with expensive\r\nmarketing, that discouraged eastern farmers. But that was twenty-five\r\nyears and more ago. To-day prices are different and should again\r\nencourage eastern stock raising at least for local markets. But in the\r\nmeanwhile our eastern farmers have fallen out of the habit. It has\r\nbecome a proverb that sheep don’t pay--just as, for that matter, it has\r\nbecome a proverb that chickens don’t pay, cattle don’t pay, pigs don’t\r\npay, hay don’t pay or, in brief and as Hadley was constantly reminding\r\nme, “Nothin’ don’t pay.” He spoke with more truth than he thought when\r\nhe said that. It’s a fact that “nothin’ don’t pay,” but everything else\r\ndoes pay.\r\n\r\nNow as the Agricultural School expert insisted, a flock of one hundred\r\nsheep carefully looked after in the East can be made worth as much\r\nas five hundred or a thousand half neglected on the western plains.\r\nThe only condition modern methods impose on modern farmers is that\r\nsuch things as are raised shall be cared for. There must be no waste.\r\nThat is doing nothing more than carry to the farm the principles which\r\ngovern all modern businesses. The day of allowing sheep, cattle,\r\nchickens, or produce to care for themselves and taking what is left,\r\nhas passed. The only unfortunate feature of this new system is that\r\nit involves on the part of the farmer hard work. In getting out of\r\nthe habit of raising such things as are raised to-day in a big way in\r\nthe West, the New England farmer has gotten out of the habit of hard\r\nwork. That’s the gospel truth in a nutshell as it was shown up in our\r\ntown. With the pioneer movement shifted to the West, all the pioneer\r\nqualities went with it. Deserted farms don’t necessarily mean bad farm\r\nlands; they mean bad farmers, lazy farmers, uninspired farmers. Once\r\nagain I find myself getting back to this as a fundamental truth and\r\nonce again I bring up as proof the fact that the minute you place upon\r\nthese acres an old-world pioneer like Dardoni you see the land spring\r\nto life as by magic.\r\n\r\nPigs and chickens, how to select the stock, how to feed them and house\r\nthem were treated in the same manner by other speakers from the school.\r\nI was surprised in how scientific a manner this business has been\r\nworked out. Take for example the matter of the by-product, manure.\r\nOne speaker made the statement--it sounded rash enough but he assured\r\nus that it was based on statistics--that the annual loss in America\r\nthrough the incompetent handling of barnyard dressing, amounted to six\r\nhundred million dollars. This represents just so much wasted nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid and potash. One speaker presented a table showing the\r\nvalue in dollars and cents of dressing per one thousand pounds, live\r\nweight. Sheep produce thirty-four and one-tenth pounds per day, valued\r\nat twenty-six dollars a year; calves sixty-seven and eight-tenths,\r\nvalued at twenty-four dollars a year; pigs eighty-three and six-tenths,\r\nvalued at sixty dollars a year; cows seventy-four and one-tenth pounds,\r\nvalued at twenty-nine dollars and twenty-seven cents a year; horses\r\nforty-eight and eight-tenths pounds, valued at twenty-seven dollars and\r\nseventy-four cents a year. And this is merely a by-product.\r\n\r\nI tell you those figures did us good. Those of us who were in the habit\r\nof holding our breath in awe at mention of the capitalization of the\r\nsteel trust, held up our heads and felt more like men when we realized\r\nthat we were in a sense stockholders in a business that put that trust\r\ncompletely in the shade. For example, the annual production of eggs in\r\nthe United States is about 1,293,800,000 dozens. At the average price\r\nof eggs the total value of these is $452,830,000--nearly five hundred\r\nmillion dollars a year. Added to this, more than two hundred million\r\ndollars’ worth of poultry is consumed. And this is only one item.\r\nConsider that in the State of Wisconsin alone the value of the butter\r\nand cheese products for a single year runs over eighty million dollars;\r\nconsider that the wheat crop is worth annually considerably over a\r\nbillion; that vegetables alone represent another annual value of over\r\ntwo hundred and fifty million and you get some idea of what a business\r\nthe same farmer who is laughed at in the comic weeklies is doing. The\r\ncrop for the year nineteen hundred amounted to more than three billion\r\ndollars. And that represents without a doubt another three billion\r\nof waste, for there isn’t a nation on the face of the earth that so\r\nuneconomically plants and reaps and markets its harvest. Why shouldn’t\r\nwe farmers carry ourselves proudly? Why instead of being the butt and\r\nplaything of financiers shouldn’t we hold those same men at our mercy?\r\nThese were questions that before the winter was out more than one man\r\nasked of himself.\r\n\r\nOne other point came up for discussion in the course of the winter and\r\nthat was the question of specialization; of whether as a community\r\nit would pay us better to center our efforts upon some one line such\r\nas dairy products, meat products, vegetable products or what not, or\r\nwhether it wasn’t better as small farmers with no particular advantages\r\nof soil or market for us to carry on diversified farms. On the whole\r\nthe latter was the opinion of the school experts and also carried the\r\nstrongest appeal to the majority of us. If every man kept at least one\r\ncow, a hog or so, a few sheep and a few hens, he first of all was then\r\nin a position to supply himself--and after all a man is his own best\r\nmarket--and secondly it gave him a more regular income as his stock\r\ndidn’t develop for the market all at one time; and thirdly, he didn’t\r\nput all his eggs in one basket. A man specializing for instance in\r\npoultry is apt by disease to lose his whole flock and the same is true\r\nof his herd or his hogs. A diversified farm makes a man independent\r\nof market conditions. If poultry is low and eggs high he can keep his\r\npullets for eggs. If beef is low and butter high, he can keep his cows\r\nfor milk and vice versa. In other words, he isn’t forced to sell at\r\ncertain times regardless of what the market is.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, was insisted upon, that so far as possible a man\r\nshould keep the best of each kind. This led to the subject of breeding,\r\nand this led in turn to the question of whether to this end it wasn’t\r\npossible for us as a group to invest in a common breeder--a blooded\r\nbull, a blooded ram, which as individuals none of us could afford. And\r\nthis again led, as about everything we touched upon that winter had\r\nled, to the question of closer coöperation. Two hundred years ago the\r\nIndians and various other forces which to-day seem to us only romantic\r\nled our ancestors to coöperate in a certain way; to-day economic\r\nconditions are bringing about the same result. In February the one\r\nthought that was uppermost in the minds of us all was coöperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nGETTING TOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two winters we had met together and amused ourselves together.\r\nThat was what counted--counted even more than the work we had done\r\ntogether. Perhaps you wouldn’t think that this social intercourse and\r\nthe establishment of this common pioneer background was of any great\r\nimportance, but if you had been one of us you would surely have felt\r\nits importance. It made us one big family as nothing else in the world\r\ncould have done. Church societies build up as many barriers as they\r\nbreak down; so, too, do fraternal and political societies. But here we\r\nwent back to a meeting ground which kept us shoulder to shoulder with\r\none another and with our common past. Men and women can be entertained\r\ntogether when nothing else is possible.\r\n\r\nThen again, I don’t suppose city folks know what a New England winter\r\nmeans to a New England farmer. Winter doesn’t mean much in the city\r\nexcept a complication with coal bills. Routine work goes on in the\r\nsame routine way and the amusement of the beaches is shifted to the\r\namusement of the theaters. But in the country Nature shuts up shop and\r\nthere is a complete change of work and way of living. It’s a period of\r\nexile for many and a period of loafing. Men and women are shut up with\r\nthemselves, or at best with their own. Six months of this isn’t good\r\nfor anyone. Every old spite and grudge and grouch fattens and grows\r\nstrong. Men get surly and women get cranky. Men eat too much and women\r\ncook too much. If a man hasn’t any pet grievance of his own he has\r\nplenty supplied him by the press and magazines. Farmers read too much\r\nof murders and sudden death, of corruption in business and politics and\r\nsociety. They have too much time to think over that stuff after they’ve\r\nread it and they don’t exercise enough to work it off. City folk stand\r\nit because they read and forget and don’t take it seriously. But I\r\ntell you some magazine publishers have something to answer for in the\r\npicture of city life they have drawn for country people whether true or\r\nnot. As I’ve heard Hadley say, “’Pears to me like everything’s rotten\r\nto-day.” It makes men careless about being rotten themselves when they\r\nthink all the rest of the world is.\r\n\r\nThe value of our meetings didn’t end with the meetings themselves.\r\nPeople who had been born and brought up together met in true neighborly\r\nfashion for the first time through the Pioneer Club. This was because\r\nwe furnished them a common interest. This led to more every-day\r\nintercourse that winter--to neighborhood calls and neighborhood\r\nparties. Ruth helped this along wonderfully. She entertained a good\r\ndeal herself and helped others entertain, but I tell you she had her\r\nown ideas how this should be done. She wouldn’t have any fuss and\r\nfeathers, such as we had experienced in the suburbs. People didn’t\r\nhave to dress up in their best bibs and tuckers to call on her, and\r\nthere was neither bridge nor cakes nor teas nor ices. People dropped in\r\njust as they were and brought their sewing with them. For the younger\r\npeople she devised the Miles Standish play with such materials as she\r\nhad at hand. Then there were charades and old-fashioned games and what\r\nnot--everything simple, everything inexpensive, everybody friendly and\r\nat ease. She kept the women, both young and old, astir all winter\r\nlong and gave them something else to think about besides the next\r\nday’s cooking, washing or mending. She even helped them simplify these\r\nnecessary duties and taught them a more wholesome standard of living.\r\nFrom morning till night she was a teacher, but no one except myself\r\nrealized this. She set everyone an example in her house and astonished\r\nthem with the ease with which she did her own work and cared for three\r\nchildren without wearing herself out. They never found her too busy to\r\nstop for a moment and never discovered her with either a headache or\r\na lame back. Over and over I’ve heard her say to them, “Housekeeping\r\nis only a play game.” Then she would laugh until you couldn’t help\r\nbelieving that it really was. And to her it was. God bless her--to her\r\nit was. It was wonderful how far the influence of her laughter carried.\r\n\r\nAnd all this while we had been strengthening the pioneer idea, too. We\r\nfound that older people responded to its spirit almost as eagerly as\r\nboys do to the same thing in a simpler form as expressed in the Boy\r\nScout movement. There isn’t a boy with red blood in his veins, whether\r\nraised in New York, London or a country village, who isn’t stirred by\r\nthe hardy principles that govern your true scout. It’s amazing to see\r\nhow much of that spirit is in their blood; how gladly they return to\r\nmore primitive conditions. Boys brought up in luxury taste their first\r\nreal meal when they munch a slice of bacon sizzled over the embers of a\r\nwood fire or a potato cooked in the ashes. They learn the real meaning\r\nof sleep when at the end of a hard day’s hike they roll up in a blanket\r\nin the open. Boys are born pioneers the world over--even to-day. The\r\nspirit is educated out of them in many cases, more’s the pity, but\r\nafter all it remains at the basis of every real man.\r\n\r\nSo when at our meetings, directly and indirectly, we harped upon\r\nthis idea and argued that the fun of living was within ourselves and\r\nnot outside ourselves; when we insisted that the more we depended\r\nupon things outside ourselves for happiness, the less we responded;\r\nwhen we argued for a simpler standard in our clothes, our food, our\r\nsurroundings, our amusements and a heartier dependence upon our work,\r\nwe saw its effect. Much has been said about the advantage to farmers of\r\nthe telephone, the rural mail which keeps them in daily touch with the\r\noutside world and labor-saving devices which make their work easier,\r\nbut honestly I believe that if in the end this saves them from some\r\nevils it brings evils of its own which they haven’t yet learned to\r\novercome. If these things save them from drudgery and monotony of one\r\ntype it isn’t long before they face drudgery and monotony of another\r\ntype, when they are allowed to dwell upon that feature of their work.\r\nThere isn’t in the world a bigger drudge leading a more monotonous life\r\nthan your city clerk who keeps agents scouring the world to furnish\r\nhim amusement for his idle hours and to make the routine of his work\r\nlighter. And he’s just as apt to go crazy as your lonely farmer if he\r\ndoesn’t learn to seek the joy of living within himself and not in his\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nWe tried particularly to get at the young man in our town and make him\r\nfeel it isn’t the wilderness and virgin land and homesteads that makes\r\nyour pioneer, but facing bravely whatever conditions may confront him,\r\nrelying upon his own efforts to win through them. It takes as much\r\nof a pioneer to work three acres as one hundred and sixty; a man is\r\nas much of a pioneer who forces worn-out land to yield, as one who\r\nclears virgin land of rocks and stumps. It isn’t the nature of the work\r\nbut the attitude of the man towards his work which distinguishes the\r\nplodder from the pioneer.\r\n\r\nIt is especially easy to appreciate this fact when dealing directly\r\nwith Nature. Every farm is a newly claimed homestead, if you choose to\r\nlook at it that way. And even if it has been worked a hundred years\r\nthere isn’t a season when there is not real pioneer work to be done.\r\nAs for the raising of live stock, it is done to-day much as it was two\r\nhundred years ago, except for greater attention to details.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange to some that just a fresh point of view on the same\r\nold world makes so great a difference. It didn’t, however, surprise me,\r\nbecause I had sensed the effect of this in my own life. If in the days\r\nwhen things were going well with me as a clerk with the United Woolen\r\nCompany anyone had told me that I’d come down to digging in the subway\r\nas a day laborer, I’d have felt disgraced. Such work seemed like sheer\r\nanimal-like drudgery. So it is, if you go at it that way. On the other\r\nhand, when I saw it as the pioneer work it really is, I went at it\r\nwith better spirit than ever I did adding up another man’s figures for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTwo abstract things then we had accomplished besides the practical: the\r\nestablishment of both the social spirit and the pioneer spirit among\r\nourselves. We were together like one big family and we were working in\r\na movement that might fairly be called the Man Scout movement. That’s\r\njust exactly what it was. It was alive with just the same wholesome\r\nout-of-doors adventurous spirit that characterizes the boy scout\r\nmovement. I guess it’s a pretty safe bet that anything which appeals\r\nuniversally to boys will appeal universally to men. It was so in our\r\ntown anyway.\r\n\r\nThe next step then--the coöperative step--came about naturally and\r\nalmost inevitably. No one planned it and no one so far as I remember\r\nsuggested it. It would have been a dangerous thing to suggest\r\ndirectly. As a phrase it smacked of socialism and there were mighty\r\nfew socialists in our town. Our inheritance and our training was all\r\nagainst it. There wasn’t a man so poor that even if he was willing\r\nto make a martyr out of himself would let anyone else make a martyr\r\nout of him. The worse off he was, the more independent he became. He\r\nwould rather play a lone hand at a losing game than win by joining\r\nhis troubles with those of someone else. Your bred-in-the-bone New\r\nEnglander is a solitary man who, when pressed to the wall, turns and\r\nfights his own fight. He’ll unite against a common outside enemy but\r\nnot against his own. It’s this spirit that made our nation, but it’s\r\nthis spirit too which is to-day destroying the man himself. With a\r\ncloser knit civilization demanding coöperation he is as a rule so\r\njealous of his personal rights that he balks. And after all, that’s the\r\npioneer spirit too.\r\n\r\nComing into town as an outsider I was in a position to see certain\r\nthings that were not apparent to those born and brought up here. That\r\nis always possible to anyone approaching a new business with his eyes\r\nopen. I had found it so when I began work as a ditch digger. Within\r\na year I detected flaws to which those who had given their lives\r\nto construction work were blind. I was unburdened with bewildering\r\ndetails and prejudices. So in this town my eyes were fresh and I\r\nviewed the village not altogether from the unit of my own farm but\r\nas a whole. I was a stockholder in a corporation owning a million and\r\nmore dollars’ worth of buildings and land, and employing hundreds of\r\nhands. Consequently I was able to consider any new project not only\r\nas it affected my own small interest but as it affected the whole\r\ncorporation. The question of raising our own meats then was not with me\r\nmerely a question of keeping a beef, some sheep, pigs and chickens for\r\nmyself but a matter of saving the corporation the thousands of dollars\r\nwhich would result in the general undertaking. So it was natural\r\nenough to me when the matter of buying full-blooded breeders came up\r\nwhich were beyond the means of any one individual, to suggest that the\r\nPioneer Club, which represented the corporation, should do something\r\ntowards making this easy. I had no idea of any general coöperative plan\r\nin doing this, but the idea was just the spark needed to kindle that\r\nwhole burning issue.\r\n\r\nWe wanted a good Dorset ram which would cost in the neighborhood of\r\na hundred dollars; we wanted a good bull which would cost in the\r\nneighborhood of six hundred dollars. Unless a man went into either\r\nbusiness extensively such an investment wouldn’t pay. It seemed\r\nnatural enough then for us all to club together and buy shares. But\r\nif we did this, why shouldn’t we do more? There was the whole problem\r\nof marketing still confronting us. We had solved it in a crude way\r\nlast spring but that only served to show us what might be done with a\r\nperfected organization. Out of this was born with scarcely any talk,\r\nscarcely any planning and almost full grown, the scheme which finally\r\nwelded us into one compact business firm--the Pioneer Products Company.\r\nThe idea had been growing all this time and we didn’t know it. When\r\nwe did recognize it, it seemed so natural and obvious that everyone\r\nmarveled that we hadn’t thought of it from the beginning. It’s merely\r\nanother example of what a rut farming folk have fallen into.\r\n\r\nThere isn’t any business on the face of the earth that lends itself so\r\nreadily to coöperation as farming. Every country village consists of\r\na small compact body of men living side by side and almost to a man\r\nengaged in buying the same products, manufacturing the same products\r\nand selling the same products to the same market. And these products\r\nare the universal necessities of life. It might be possible for men to\r\nget along without coal, without oil, without steel, even without beef,\r\nbut they surely could not get along without wheat and corn, without\r\nvegetables, without eggs and milk. And yet these communities instead of\r\nholding the world by the throat are themselves the prey of the world\r\neven with their own products. With common interests, common foes, with\r\na common plant and a common organization they still are the common\r\nvictims of a hundred diversified outside interests. This is solely\r\nbecause the outside interests--like the banks--are allowed to treat\r\nwith them as small weak units instead of as one large strong unit. And\r\nthis after coöperation has been taught them by their government, by\r\nevery business in the land, by every labor organization. It is, as I\r\nhave said, this branch of the pioneer spirit which has been both their\r\nsalvation and their undoing. But that it is possible both to preserve\r\nthis and curb it we proved to our satisfaction with the Pioneer\r\nProducts Company.\r\n\r\nHolt read up on the subject and he found that coöperative farming which\r\nwas so novel to us in the East had long been in successful operation\r\nin the West and South. That’s just the point. So are a hundred other\r\ngood things. We in the East have urged our young farmers West until\r\nwe have drained the East of its best. We have sent them forth like\r\nmissionaries in such numbers that now we need some of them back as\r\nmissionaries to ourselves. It’s those same men in the West who have\r\nbeen first to seize upon the new ideas in agriculture, while their\r\neastern brothers have gone along in the same old ruts. New England as a\r\nwhole has been treated like one vast deserted farm not worth anyone’s\r\ntrouble. The Government itself treats it as such. It’s eager enough to\r\nspend millions on draining projects in Florida or irrigation projects\r\nin the West while there are whole townships in the State of Maine in as\r\nprimeval a condition as they were at the landing of the Pilgrims. It’s\r\nactually so. If Maine were located in Oregon it would be to-day the\r\nrichest State in the Union. But as sure as fate the old-world pioneers\r\nwill soon rediscover it if we don’t ourselves, for to them Maine is the\r\nFar West.\r\n\r\nI find I get switched back to that theme every time I trace a new\r\nfeature of our development.\r\n\r\nAs I said, Holt read up on the subject of coöperative farming as\r\nhe always read up on every new subject before tackling it. About\r\nthe first thing he ran into was the history of the Eastern Shore of\r\nVirginia Produce Exchange--an enterprise which reads like romance.\r\nEvery farmer in New England ought to read it. Holt gave a talk on\r\nit before the club and everyone listened in amazement. Here was a\r\ngood farming country settled by industrious well-meaning farmers who\r\nraised good stuff, but who in 1899 found themselves on the verge of\r\nbankruptcy. It was each man for himself and sometimes they sold their\r\ncrops for half what it cost to raise them. As individuals they couldn’t\r\nreach their market without giving up their profits to commission men\r\nand railroads. Then someone organized the exchange and so poor were\r\nits members that a membership fee of only five dollars was charged\r\nwith the privilege of paying only twenty-five cents down and the rest\r\nin installments. During the first year the organization shipped four\r\nhundred thousand barrels of produce; ten years later it was shipping\r\none million four hundred thousand barrels. It now handles every year\r\none million barrels of Irish potatoes and eight hundred thousand\r\nbarrels of sweet potatoes. During the last three years it has done an\r\naverage business of two million five hundred thousand dollars a year.\r\nIt has lifted a stagnant community into a prosperous community within a\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\nAnother example was the Southern Texas Truck Growers’ Association\r\nwhich was organized in 1905. At that time the farmers were producing\r\nabout five hundred car loads of onions a year and not making a living\r\nfrom them. The following year they shipped nine hundred cars; the next\r\nyear one thousand cars; the next year two thousand cars, and in 1910\r\ntwenty-five hundred cars valued at one million five hundred thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nWe had twenty more such examples for encouragement but we didn’t need\r\nany of them. Our own needs suggested our own remedy and that spring the\r\nPioneer Products Company took out its charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFINDING OURSELVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Products Company was capitalized for three thousand\r\ndollars. Shares were sold for a dollar each, but each member was\r\nrequired to purchase five shares and not allowed to purchase more than\r\ntwenty. Our object as set forth in the constitution was “the buying,\r\nselling, and handling of produce; the selling and consigning of produce\r\nas agent of the producer; the inspection of all produce so consigned;\r\nand the owning and operating of whatsoever shall be deemed to the\r\nadvantage of the producer.”\r\n\r\nThe active management was to be in the hands of the general manager,\r\nwho was to receive a small salary, and the secretary-treasurer. One of\r\nthe most important provisions reads as follows: “All stockholders in\r\nthe company shall be compelled to ship through the company.”\r\n\r\nThis was inserted as a protection against the bribing of members by\r\ncity commission men whose object might be to break up the organization\r\nby offering, for a time, higher prices.\r\n\r\nOur plan for distribution of profits provided that after all expenses\r\nwere paid a dividend not exceeding ten per cent. might be voted;\r\nthat after this a sum amounting to a tax of not over one dollar a\r\nshare should be reserved from the surplus as a reserve fund, and the\r\nremainder distributed among members in proportion to the amount of\r\nbusiness done.\r\n\r\nA board of five directors elected by members was to have general\r\nsupervision of the business with power to adjust all grievances.\r\n\r\nThere you have it in a nutshell. Our organization was unique in that\r\nit was founded on a social club already well established. We elected\r\nfor the company the same board which had so successfully governed\r\nthe club. I was elected secretary-treasurer and accepted the duty\r\nbecause I knew I was in a better position to undertake the work than\r\nanyone else. We elected Holt as manager and he accepted the position\r\nin a like spirit, although he knew it would demand a great deal of\r\ntime from him. We couldn’t have had a better man. He jumped into the\r\noffice like one whose fortune depended upon the outcome. He began\r\nto make a thorough study of market conditions, and got into touch at\r\nonce with two or three big commission men. He haunted the markets and\r\nasked as many questions as though he were a member of a congressional\r\ninvestigating committee. He studied the transportation problem, and\r\nas a result soon sprang a brand new idea on us which went a long way\r\ntowards making that first season successful. He had nosed around the\r\ncity and found a second-hand auto truck which could be bought at a\r\nbargain. Our town was on a state road which was kept in good condition\r\nand he figured that by using the truck, counting in depreciation,\r\ninterest and running expenses, we could effect a freight reduction of\r\nover fifty per cent. by transporting our own produce. Furthermore,\r\nthis would leave us independent of train schedules and free to ship\r\nearly or late as might suit our convenience. He was so enthusiastic\r\nover the project that he offered to contribute towards its purchase\r\nthe salary of six hundred dollars we had voted him. I mention this to\r\nshow what a fine spirit this man Holt had. It’s the sort of spirit\r\nthat would make a success of any reputable venture. I’m also glad to\r\nmention that the company for its part showed an equally fine spirit.\r\nThe board recommended the purchase, and the stockholders to a man voted\r\nto accept the recommendation, but to a man voted not to accept Holt’s\r\ncontribution. Now that’s the sort of feeling that lies at the basis of\r\nreal coöperation. That’s the sort of feeling which the two previous\r\nwinters had made possible. There wasn’t a man in the club who didn’t\r\nappreciate Holt’s efforts and want him to get a fair return for his\r\nwork. That feeling was worth ten thousand dollars to the club.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we did was to make a canvass of the club to find out how\r\nmany men were able and willing to add to their live stock. It was urged\r\nthat every Pioneer Club member should keep at least a few hens and a\r\npig, and there was none who was not ready to accept this suggestion.\r\n\r\n“We oughtn’t to find a member of this club buying an egg or a fowl\r\nfrom this time on,” I said. “If by any chance a member does find it\r\nnecessary he ought to buy of another member. It’s absurd for any live\r\ndweller in the country ever to spend his good money for such things.\r\nIt’s more; it’s a disgrace.\r\n\r\n“Moreover we shouldn’t find within another year any member of this club\r\npaying from twelve to fourteen cents a pound for salt pork, or sixteen\r\ncents a pound for lard, or twenty-five cents a pound for bacon, when it\r\nwould almost pay every man in the club to keep pigs for the dressing\r\nalone. Our forefathers would no more have thought of getting along\r\nwithout a pig than they would a well. No more should we. The packers\r\nhave made it easy for us to buy rather than raise. So does everyone\r\nelse who wants our money. That’s the big temptation which has been our\r\nundoing--this biting to the bait of the easiest way. It’s nothing but a\r\nnew form of taxation which we have been too indifferent to throw off,\r\nuntil now we have the habit and think we can’t. It’s a pretty safe\r\nguess that the easiest way is never the profitable way in anything.\r\nWe’ve tried the other with poor results; now let’s try the new way--the\r\npioneer way.”\r\n\r\nThe question of raising beef and lamb, however, was not quite so general\r\na one, as it took more capital. However, we found some twenty men who\r\nwere willing to undertake the experiment to an extent which made\r\nit seem worth while for the rest of the club to help finance the\r\nundertaking. It resulted in the purchase of a Dorset ram and a good\r\nHolstein bull. A member was found who was willing to care for the\r\nanimals in return for the free use of them himself. In addition he was\r\nallowed to charge a nominal fee which should cover the interest of the\r\nmoney invested by the club.\r\n\r\nThis was in February, and a few weeks later with the stock fully\r\nsubscribed we began our second campaign. As Holt made clear in a talk\r\nto the club this company was not in and of itself any royal road to\r\nfortune. It was no short cut to success.\r\n\r\n“It means harder work than ever on our part,” he said. “The company\r\nwill prosper or fail by our own efforts. Don’t forget that before we\r\ncan sell anything we must have something to sell. It may be different\r\nin Wall Street, but that’s a cold fact in our business. We must have\r\nmore produce and better produce. Understand, it must be better. Now\r\nthat we have given ourselves a name, that name must be made to stand\r\nfor something. Up to now we have been anonymous, but from this point\r\non we can’t be. I want our name to be not only for our own protection,\r\nbut for the protection of our customers. I want the Pioneer Products\r\nCompany to stand for the best and freshest and cheapest vegetables to\r\nbe purchased. That’s the boast I’m making; that’s the boast I’m going\r\nright on making and you must back me up in it. You must turn more soil\r\nthis year than last and you must give more care to your stuff. You must\r\nwork harder. Don’t forget that this isn’t any easy way. For twenty\r\nyears you’ve fooled around with the easy way--raising as little as you\r\ncould with as little work as possible. This is the hard way--raising\r\nall you can and putting into the effort every ounce in you. But it’s\r\nthe only way, and if you’ll stand back of me we’ll make this the\r\nbiggest year our village ever had. Are you back of me?”\r\n\r\n“You bet we are,” came a chorus.\r\n\r\nThey proved it, too, by the preparations they made. We announced the\r\nsame prize awards that we made last year. With the money which had been\r\nturned back and with the surplus we had made on our moving picture\r\nshow we were able to do this without going to the local merchants.\r\nI’m confident, however, we could have raised from the latter twice as\r\nmuch as we needed if we had tried. For the first time in a generation\r\nthey had found their credits decreasing to an amount that more than\r\npaid for their investment in the Pioneer Club. At the same time their\r\nbusiness had increased. However, we didn’t want our prizes to be so\r\nlarge as to make them an end in themselves, and we didn’t wish to\r\nincrease their number to a point that would destroy competition.\r\nFurthermore we didn’t have half the need of stimulation that we had\r\nlast year. Our people were now stockholders in a company and had the\r\ncompany to work for. Furthermore they had the inspiration of last\r\nseason’s success to urge them on. I tell you that just the decreased\r\nhousehold expenses of last winter made them realize what it meant to\r\nkeep their land busy.\r\n\r\nI figured that at least thirty per cent. more land was turned this\r\nspring. If our town had looked busy last year it was a regular bee-hive\r\nthis year. We were also better prepared to do our own work. Several\r\nhorses had been bought during the winter and many men had invested in\r\nplows and harrows so that they were able not only to do their own work\r\nbut that of their neighbors too. We called in some outside help, but\r\nnot much, which was a big satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThere was little skepticism this season about the worth of the\r\nmethods we had followed last. Everyone had had better crops than ever\r\nbefore, even if in some cases they hadn’t come up to all that had been\r\nhoped for. Also there had been a good deal of swapping of experiences\r\nduring the winter with a result of much information in regard to seeds\r\nthat was of value. I realized that in a general way we already were\r\nbeginning to sift out the things for which our land was best adapted.\r\nIt was the beginning of specialization. I hoped, however, that this\r\nwouldn’t be carried too far, because I believed and still believe that\r\nour success would lie more in the line of general farming than special\r\nfarming. Above all things I believe that every community should first\r\nof all supply itself. That is a pioneer idea that spells safety. Every\r\ndollar saved is more than a dollar earned in most cases; it often\r\namounts to two dollars earned.\r\n\r\nI had had such success last year with my potatoes that I determined\r\nto put in another five acres, making ten in all. I expected Hadley to\r\napprove of this inasmuch as results had contradicted every prophecy he\r\nhad made. However, he only shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I say let well ’nuff be. Ye was just plumb lucky last year, but ef ye\r\ntry again ye’ll lose all ye made.”\r\n\r\nYou can’t beat Hadley’s pessimism. If you fail he’ll tell you he knew\r\nyou would; if you succeed he’ll advise you not to tempt fate again. So\r\nfar as I know he was the only man in the village who was still stuck\r\nin his tracks. I tried once more to persuade him to till his own soil\r\nbut he refused. He was living fairly comfortably on the wages I paid\r\nhim and was content to let matters rest there. Even in the face of the\r\nprofits he had seen me reap, he only replied, “Ain’t no use farmin’\r\nround here. Farmin’s dead.”\r\n\r\nI kept my vegetable garden much as I had it before, but I put in\r\nanother acre of white beans. Beans and potatoes--it looked to me as\r\nthough any farmer in New England ought to make a living from those two\r\nthings alone. They are as staple as gold and the market for them is\r\nunlimited. That is especially true of beans, for they keep indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI ought also to say that my apple trees this second spring showed the\r\nresult of the care that had been given them. They looked so hardy and\r\nstrong that it was almost impossible to believe that they had the\r\nburden of fifty years’ neglect back of them. They blossomed well and I\r\nexpected a good deal from them.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Holt was working harder than ever with a view to\r\nproviding us with the best possible market. We talked over any number\r\nof schemes. We considered the advisability of hiring a market stall in\r\nthe city market for our own produce, but that involved not only a good\r\ndeal of expense but active competition with men who made retail selling\r\ntheir business. We couldn’t afford to hire more help and it looked\r\nunwise to attempt to undertake this without the aid of an experienced\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThen we considered an attempt to work up a line of private customers\r\nand deliver our produce to them direct. This again involved an initial\r\nexpense for teams and men that we couldn’t afford and also the services\r\nof someone who could give more time to the management of the project\r\nthan Holt could spare.\r\n\r\nIn the end it seemed inevitable that we should use a commission man.\r\nBut--here’s the point--we were now collectively in a position to come\r\nto fairer terms with a middle-man than we had been as individuals.\r\nIf one man handled all our produce he could afford to pay us more.\r\nOur experience with Barnes had been fairly satisfactory but he was\r\nonly a commission agent and it didn’t seem to Holt that he offered\r\nnow as good terms as we ought to get. Undoubtedly we should have had\r\nto accept those if Holt hadn’t run across a young fellow by the name\r\nof Burlington. He was just the man we needed. He was a young fellow\r\nstarting in the retail business for himself and needed our produce as\r\nmuch as we needed him. Holt made fast to him at once. After his first\r\ninterview with Burlington, Holt came back to me enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n“He’s the temporary solution of the selling end,” he exclaimed. “He has\r\nthe market stall, he knows the game, and he has a clientele. That much\r\nhe has already invested for us. Now what I propose to do is to take him\r\ninto partnership.”\r\n\r\n“Have you got as far as that with him?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet,” answered Holt, “but that’s what it’s coming to. If we give\r\nhim stuff enough he can afford to handle it on a basis of ten per cent.\r\nover his expenses, which will be another five per cent. That’s some\r\nbetter than the thirty per cent. that we’ve been paying.”\r\n\r\n“It surely is,” I agreed, “but he hasn’t agreed to it yet.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet,” answered Holt without showing any sign of being worried.\r\n“I’m going to bring him out here some Sunday and show him our plant.”\r\n\r\nA week or so later Holt brought Burlington out. He was a clean-cut,\r\nwide-awake young fellow of thirty and I liked him at once. We had him\r\nup to dinner and after that took him to drive around the village. We\r\nshowed him some five hundred acres of land under cultivation--under\r\nreal cultivation. We showed him acres upon acres which had been\r\nharrowed and worked until they looked like front lawns ready for seed.\r\nWe told him that the produce from every inch of that ground would pass\r\nthrough the Pioneer Company except what was used at home. It was just\r\nlike one big farm.\r\n\r\nHe was amazed. Then he exclaimed, “Say, you fellows have hit it right\r\nif you can keep it up.”\r\n\r\n“Just you watch us,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “I don’t need to watch anyone but Holt here,” he answered.\r\n“And, believe me, I certainly have got to watch him if I’m going to\r\nmake a cent out of the deal.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t get that idea,” Holt broke in, taking him seriously. “We want\r\nyou to make a fair profit and we’ll see that you do. We want you to\r\nfeel like one of us--a sort of partner.”\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t thought of it that way,” answered Burlington, “but I believe\r\nthat’s the right way to look at it. And say, I wouldn’t mind living out\r\nhere myself. Anything in farms to be had around here at a reasonable\r\nfigure?”\r\n\r\n“Is now,” I answered, “but there won’t be five years from now.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t know whether he was in earnest or not, but less than two\r\nmonths later he bought the Smalley place--a good house and ten acres\r\nof land at the lower end of High Street. That was a good move for him\r\nand a good move for us. It gave us confidence in him and made him\r\nreally one of us. He joined the Pioneer Club at once and I sold him\r\nfive shares of stock out of my twenty in the Pioneer Products Company\r\nso that he could join us, though I hated to part with it. There were\r\nsome who were suspicious of his motives, but I wasn’t, and it wasn’t\r\nlong before he proved himself one of the live wires of the company.\r\nHis knowledge of the market was invaluable to us, and later on was an\r\nimportant factor in guiding us concerning what to plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE HANGS HIGH\r\n\r\n\r\nThings went well with us that second season. Much of the novelty of\r\nthe undertaking had worn off but none of the enthusiasm and everyone\r\nsettled down to hard, steady work. The prizes were still a big\r\nincentive and the hundred dollars in new bills which Holt continued\r\nto exhibit in Moulton’s store window was still as much a center of\r\ninterest and excited curiosity as money in a museum. But there was more\r\na feeling of security and confidence than the year before. Our past\r\nsuccess was somewhat responsible for this, but the Pioneer Products\r\nCompany was more so. There seemed to be a feeling now that we were\r\non a solid business basis. The coöperation idea--the mere fact of\r\norganization--and the sight of stock certificates made our members feel\r\nmore like real business men than ever before they had felt in their\r\nlives. And that was good for them. It steadied them and made them take\r\ntheir work more seriously.\r\n\r\nThat was a good season for crops. Our small stuff came along early and\r\ndid well. By the last of June we were shipping lettuce and radishes and\r\nby the first week in July early peas. Of course hothouse stuff had been\r\nin the market long before this but Burlington was able to quote prices\r\nthat furnished him a ready market. Not only were the prices right but\r\nthe produce was right. There isn’t much doubt but what stuff grown in a\r\nnormal way without being forced has certain qualities that you can’t\r\nget in hothouse products. The longer I farm the more respect I have for\r\nNature as a business partner. She is always square and above board but\r\nshe is also a stern mistress in the matter of justice. You can’t ever\r\nget something for nothing from her. She’ll beat you every time you try\r\nit. If you try to hurry her well and good, you can, but you’ll pay for\r\nyour early stuff at cost of flavor. If you go in for flavor, well and\r\ngood, but you’ll pay for that at the cost of size. Let her alone and\r\nshe’ll balance things.\r\n\r\nWe shipped eight hundred dollars’ worth of produce the last week in\r\nJune and through July our shipment amounted to three thousand dollars\r\na week, jumping in August to five thousand dollars and over a week.\r\nHolt appointed an assistant to see that everything submitted was up to\r\nstandard. This man had authority to discard anything offered, but any\r\nfarmer who felt that he was being discriminated against could submit\r\nthe refused article that night to Holt. It may be well to mention that\r\nnot a man disputed the first judgment that summer. As members of the\r\ncorporation they realized that it was as much to their interest as\r\nanyone’s to preserve our standard.\r\n\r\nOur motor truck was a great success, reducing our transportation\r\ncharges almost fifty per cent. Not only this, but as time went on we\r\nfound that at the same cost it would have paid for itself in the matter\r\nof convenience alone. We reached the market earlier and were able to\r\nmake, as we did later in the season, two and three trips a day, so\r\nalways getting our stuff to the market fresh.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, when we began to get new potatoes and early\r\napples, our sales jumped to six thousand dollars a week. Some of this\r\nwe shipped by freight. Never before had anyone in our town, except\r\nDardoni, ever marketed his early apples. A few bushels would be\r\ntaken to the store but as a rule what couldn’t be made into pies or\r\neaten by the small boys were allowed to rot on the ground. As for\r\ncrab apples--and nearly every farm had at least one tree--what a few\r\nhousewives did not put up in jelly met the same fate. I’ve seen bushels\r\nof plump red crabs rotting on the ground. But not this season. In\r\nthe first place, Ruth all winter had urged the wives to put up more\r\npreserves and the result was marked. Farmers had to get up early to get\r\nahead of their wives and gather any to send to town, but they found a\r\nready market for all they could send. I reckoned as clear profit to the\r\nvillage every apple sent and the total amounted to a good many dollars.\r\n\r\nFor that matter you could reckon as clear profit about all the garden\r\nstuff we sent for it’s certain it represented money which until now had\r\nnot been coming in. Potatoes and beans were all that had ever found\r\ntheir way to market until now. When I look back I wonder how these\r\npeople ever lived on what they raised. In any real sense they didn’t\r\nand what was true of our town is true to-day of a hundred other towns\r\nin New England. You can find conditions of poverty right out under\r\nGod’s blue sky that would make your hardened settlement worker shudder\r\nwith horror.\r\n\r\nEverything went well with us that second season as I said, and for that\r\nreason it isn’t particularly interesting to me. On the first of October\r\nwe found that we had done a business of sixty-seven thousand eight\r\nhundred dollars. In round figures this left after deducting commission\r\nand expenses sixty thousand dollars. Out of this we declared a ten per\r\ncent. dividend to stockholders, which amounted to six thousand dollars.\r\nThree thousand more, or one dollar a share, we put aside into our\r\nreserve fund. This left fifty-one thousand dollars to be distributed\r\non the basis of the amount of produce turned in. We had that year four\r\nhundred and twenty-one members which made our net profits figure up per\r\ncapita a little over one hundred and twenty dollars.\r\n\r\nNow it’s impossible for anyone to figure on whether that was a fair\r\nreturn for the amount of capital invested in our plant or not. In\r\nthe first place that doesn’t by any means represent the value of our\r\nproduce. You must take into account the amount consumed by our home\r\nmarket, the amount in hay and corn and potatoes and beans and what\r\nnot which we kept on hand for winter consumption and a hundred other\r\nthings. And besides--and this is something I want to emphasize over\r\nand over again--if you could figure the total it would all be beside\r\nthe point. The fact which counted with us wasn’t whether or not we\r\nwere getting full value from our plant as yet. We weren’t, and we knew\r\nit. The point was that we were getting something where before we got\r\nnothing. If we hadn’t shipped five thousand dollars’ worth of produce\r\nthat second season we should have called our enterprise a success. We\r\nhad waked up! We were trying! We were using our opportunities! Our old\r\nmen were interested and our younger men enthusiastic and our women were\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nIn looking back--and I don’t have to look back very far--I realize more\r\nthan ever that the Pioneer Products Company, which expresses the result\r\nof our labors in dollars and cents, is by no means as important even\r\nnow as the Pioneer Club which expresses itself principally in pleasant\r\nmemories. The Pioneer Products Company is making us secure with modest\r\nbank accounts, but it is the Pioneer Club which has made us Sam and\r\nJosh and Frank and Bill to one another, and our wives Sam’s wife and\r\nJosh’s wife and Frank’s wife and Bill’s wife. It’s the Pioneer Club\r\nthat has made us glad we’re living even if it’s the P. P. C. that has\r\nmade it possible for us to live. It’s the Pioneer Club that has made\r\nour town dear to us and has made us proud that we live here. It’s the\r\nPioneer Club that is the heart of us through the long winter months,\r\nthough we are busier then than we used to be. And it’s the Pioneer Club\r\nagain that is keeping us sane and healthy in our prosperity.\r\n\r\nWe are becoming better pioneers every year, though there are people\r\nwho think we are going back. We don’t care an awful lot about electric\r\nlights and cement sidewalks as some of our progressive neighbors do.\r\nWe have the best streets within fifty miles of us and we are content\r\nto walk in them or in footpaths along the sides. We get along very\r\nwell with kerosene lamps and on a pinch can use candles. We have good\r\nschools and in them are using some methods copied from our Southern\r\nneighbors. We try as far as possible to teach arithmetic and farming\r\ntogether, reading and farming together, geography and farming together.\r\nIt’s just as good exercise we find for our young folks to figure out\r\nhow much five bushels of potatoes at a dollar ten a bushel will amount\r\nto as it is for them to figure out how much five times one, decimal,\r\none and a cipher is. It’s just as easy for them to learn to read by\r\nreading about flowers and simple gardening as it is about how the cat\r\ncaught the rat. It’s just as interesting for them to learn the physical\r\ngeography of the world, not as a separate study, but as part of their\r\ndry-as-bones boundary statistics.\r\n\r\nWe are encouraging athletics in the schools. We are backing the school\r\nteams with our attendance at their games and our applause. It’s a fact\r\nthat the average country boy needs gymnasium work more than the average\r\ncity boy. He needs the training, the drill and routine work.\r\n\r\nWe are teaching our girls to cook and sew. We are teaching them to\r\ncook and sew economically. Both our women and our girls were getting\r\ninto the baker shop habit. When we started in we were buying city-made\r\nbread. Think of it, in the country of home-made bread, where we have\r\nboth material and time! We don’t buy much baker stuff now.\r\n\r\nWe don’t buy as much patent medicine as we did. In the first place,\r\nthere isn’t a store in town--not even the drug store--which carries it\r\nany more. A man wouldn’t dare. If you want any of the stuff you have\r\nto send to town for it, and while this is still being done no one lets\r\nanyone know he’s doing it. Those with the habit get it and swallow it\r\nthe way they do their rum and most of them know pretty well that this\r\nis all it is.\r\n\r\nA sad event, which was at the same time a mighty good thing for our\r\ntown, was the death of Dr. Wentworth. “Doc” Wentworth as he was\r\nknown to everybody, had been here forty years. He was a big-hearted,\r\nwell-meaning type of family physician, but the amount of morphine he\r\nprescribed would have disgraced Chinatown. It was his one antidote for\r\npain and he’d give it for a toothache. He gave it to man, woman and\r\nchild. Half the children in town took paregoric from the time they\r\nwere born until they were old enough to take straight morphine. It was\r\nwicked. I went to one of the big medical schools and had a talk with\r\nthe Dean and recommended this village as a promising field for some\r\ngood young physician. The result was that a young man settled among\r\nus of whom we have grown very fond. He is with us heart and soul in\r\npreventing disease instead of fostering it.\r\n\r\nWe don’t own as many automobiles as some of our neighbors, but we have\r\nsome good horses--good work horses and good driving horses. I hope\r\nto see better stock every year. I’ve a two year old I wouldn’t swap\r\nto-day for the finest automobile ever manufactured. Our annual fair\r\nis developing more and more along the lines of the old-time fair. We\r\nare exhibiting more horses and cows and pigs and chickens because we\r\nhave some now worth exhibiting. We have developed quite a business of\r\nselling off some of our surplus stock at this time. We find that the\r\nneighboring towns wait for this event to select their breeders.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the Pioneer Products Company for a moment I may say\r\nthat our business has increased steadily every year. Some things we\r\nhave dropped because we find no further need of them. For instance\r\nthe company owns no more breeding stock. Our more prosperous members\r\nconduct that end of the business themselves. We have, however, bought a\r\nstore house.\r\n\r\nWe are planning a new experiment. We found that a surprising lot of our\r\ntrade was among my old Little Italy friends. They became permanent\r\ncustomers. As time has gone on we have also developed a regular\r\nclientele outside of these--people who know the Pioneer Products\r\nCompany by name. Our scheme for next season is to put up a family\r\nhamper to be delivered regularly through the season. This will contain\r\nenough of the new vegetables to last a family a week. We divide our\r\nproduce into firsts and seconds and deliver the firsts to those who\r\ncan afford to pay a little more. The seconds will go mostly to Little\r\nItaly. The latter will be good vegetables--fresh and sound, differing\r\nfrom the firsts only in size. Burlington is to have charge of the\r\ndistribution on his usual commission basis. He is our manager now, by\r\nthe way, paying his salary out of his commission. This method will give\r\nus a steadier market.\r\n\r\nNow about our experiment in raising our own meat. That, too, has been\r\na fair success. The local butcher fought us for a little while but his\r\nfight was hopeless. Understand, there was no attempt to boycott him or\r\nanything of that sort, but we were most of us raising our own poultry\r\nand pork and besides that we weren’t eating as much meat as we did.\r\nStill there was some demand chiefly for beef. We made a proposition\r\nto the man; that we turn in to him what meats we produced for the local\r\nmarket and that he handle them on a basis of ten per cent. net profit.\r\nHe thought it over for a little while and then accepted. He has made a\r\ngood thing out of it and so have we.\r\n\r\nI don’t want anyone to get the idea that our town is any Utopia. It\r\nisn’t. It is nothing but a steady, prosperous farming community where\r\neverybody is a hard worker. We aren’t doing half of what we might, but\r\nour satisfaction comes in knowing we are doing more than we did. As\r\nthe years go by we hope to do more. There isn’t any reason I can see\r\nwhy as a town we shouldn’t be in the position of any well-conducted\r\ncity business increasing our efficiency and with that our profits.\r\nReal estate has almost doubled here, and this hasn’t been a fictitious\r\ndoubling. It is based on what land is worth to the investor who becomes\r\none of us and uses his land intelligently. No one can buy land in our\r\ntown, loaf on it and share our prosperity. We aren’t dividing any\r\nprofits except among those of us who earn them.\r\n\r\nPeople have come to our town and tried to locate the secret of our\r\nmodest success in our land, in the coöperative idea, in our favorable\r\nposition to the market, in just our bull luck. Most of these men and\r\nwomen haven’t sense enough to be worth bothering with. I haven’t\r\nmuch patience with those who look to find the solution of all our\r\ndifficulties in some arbitrary system that doesn’t take the individual\r\ninto account. But now and then comes along a man who is in earnest.\r\nThen I take him around and introduce him to Josh Chase. He sees a\r\nlong-legged, thin-faced fellow with skin as bronze as a skipper’s. Then\r\nJosh takes the visitor over his ten acres of land with the pride of a\r\nking. He shows him a new barn and all his carefully cared for farming\r\nimplements. He takes him into a modest story and a half white house and\r\nintroduces him to Mrs. Josh and a couple of rosy-cheeked children. With\r\nhalf an eye the man can see that here is prosperity of the best kind.\r\n\r\n“Well?” the man is apt to ask me.\r\n\r\n“He isn’t afraid of the rain any more,” I say.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all. It means he isn’t afraid of work. He’s up at daybreak\r\nevery morning in the year and his work isn’t done till dark. But you\r\nwouldn’t pick him out as a slave, would you? He doesn’t look like a\r\npoor downtrodden savage, does he? He’s a man with a hoe all right but\r\nis he making any bid for your sympathy?”\r\n\r\n“That’s because your coöperative idea--”\r\n\r\n“The company would have failed the second year if Josh had been\r\ndependent upon that idea and not the idea upon him. No, sir, that man\r\ncame over in the Mayflower but he didn’t land till about five years\r\nago. If you don’t believe it I’ll show you another man who came over a\r\nlittle earlier and who isn’t a member of our company because he doesn’t\r\nneed even that help.”\r\n\r\nThen I take him round and introduce him to Dardoni.\r\n\r\nHe meets the smiling black-haired Italian and sees the latter’s busy\r\nacres and meets another type of pioneer.\r\n\r\nIf, after this, the investigator is of a mind that prosperity is so\r\ncommon hereabout that anyone can succeed, then I introduce him to the\r\nawful example. That’s Hadley.\r\n\r\nPoor old Hadley--even he confided in me the other day that if he felt\r\nreal pert next spring he thought he’d put that patch back of his house\r\ninto potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Perceived typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.",
