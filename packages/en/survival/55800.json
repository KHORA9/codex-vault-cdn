This book lays out a mosaic of facts\r\nand fancies concerning the state’s landscapes, the rocks that underlie\r\nand make up the landscapes, and the history of the people now living or\r\nwho have lived amid New Mexico’s exciting and varied scenery. We hope\r\nthese short articles will help you enjoy our state, whether you are a\r\ntourist driving through at seventy miles an hour, a visitor with a\r\nlittle time to explore, or an old-timer who remembers the cattle drives.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this publication grew out of a booklet, _New Mexico Mosaic\r\nof Science and History_, that was written for the 1963 National Science\r\nFair-International held in Albuquerque. The National Science Fair\r\nbooklet was directed specifically to the Fair participants and\r\nemphasized their tours to famous scientific installations in New Mexico,\r\nareas of scenic geologic wonders, and points of historic and archeologic\r\nimportance. The booklet had only limited distribution; subsequent\r\ninterest in this kind of publication about New Mexico led to the\r\npreparation of this book.\r\n\r\nScenic Trips No. 8 is in two major parts. First, there are articles of\r\ngeneral statewide interest to acquaint visitor and resident alike with\r\nthe Land of Enchantment—its history, flora and fauna, geology, and\r\nscenic beauty. Second, there are articles describing specific scenic,\r\ngeologic, historic, and recreational places to give a depth of\r\nunderstanding and a more intimate view of New Mexico. The entire mosaic\r\nof New Mexico thus presented is a permanent record to recall vistas of\r\nNew Mexico’s enchanting land and fascinating history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nMany people have contributed their time and talents to this co-operative\r\nundertaking. We thank each of the authors of the articles; where their\r\naffiliation is not given, they are staff members of the New Mexico\r\nBureau of Mines and Mineral Resources division of the New Mexico\r\nInstitute of Mining and Technology. Professor Christiansen is a member\r\nof the Humanities Department of the Institute’s College division. This\r\nbook would have been incomplete without the co-operation of the New\r\nMexico Department of Game and Fish, the Museum of New Mexico, the New\r\nMexico Department of Development, the State Park Commission, the U.S.\r\nPark Service, and the Forest Service, Southwestern Region, U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. Our special appreciation goes to Dr. Ross\r\nCalvin for his interpretative description of New Mexico’s unique flora.\r\n\r\nBlack and white photographs were contributed by Robert Bieberman, Roy\r\nFoster, and Teri Ray of the Bureau of Mines staff and by the authors or\r\ntheir agencies. Some of the drawings were made by David H. Moneypenny.\r\nAcknowledgment is also made to Mr. Elliott S. Barker and the Forest\r\nService for their willing loan of color transparencies.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous personnel of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and\r\nTechnology who aided in preparation of this book, appreciation is due\r\nHelen Waxler, Lois Devlin, Lola White, Mary Ann Grandjean, and Sharon\r\nBallenger for typing of manuscripts and William Arnold, Robert Price,\r\nand Raymond Molina for drafting maps and figures. Teri Ray deserves\r\nspecial mention for her interest and editorial advice and for nursing\r\nthe material from rough manuscripts into printed pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\nThe kind reception given our attempt to provide a brief but\r\ncomprehensive guide to New Mexico’s scenery, rocks, and history resulted\r\nin distribution of 5000 copies in two years, and led to this second\r\nedition. In this revision, we have incorporated changes that have\r\noccurred during these two years, especially the addition of State Parks,\r\nand Teri Ray has added an index to make the book more usable. Each\r\nauthor has re-edited his article and made changes where necessary.\r\nWilliam Arnold added much material to the index map; typing of the\r\nrevision manuscript was carefully done by Lois Devlin. Alfred Coulloudon\r\nand Wayne Bera supplied additional photographs. Teri Ray initiated\r\nrevision of the first edition, worked with authors, and guided the\r\nmanuscript from the authors to the final copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\nThe first edition appeared in 1964, the second in 1967, and a reprint in\r\n1968. In the present edition front matter has been re-styled, printed\r\nmatter has been altered on the inside and outside of the covers, a\r\nfootnote added to page 104, and a less bulky paper used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Of Indians, Spaniards, and Americans\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _by_ Paige W. Christiansen\r\n\r\nIn the world of the twentieth century with its tumultuous ovation for\r\neach discovery of science, with its language of non-Euclidian space,\r\nwith new heroes who leave the earth, not discover it—sometimes it is\r\nrefreshing to look back on other days, to see other heroes, and to seek\r\nromance and excitement which was equally spectacular in times past. Yet\r\nthere is a close affinity and a spiritual link among the heroes of the\r\npast, the present, and the future, and the reaction of their\r\ncontemporaries to their feats of glory is not so different. Heroes are\r\nthose who seek the unknown, who risk life and position to expand the\r\nfrontiers of man’s universe and mind. But heroes can only lead an age,\r\nnever surpass it. History, then, is people and their catalyst, ideas.\r\n\r\nThe history of New Mexico, like twentieth century science, is\r\nmulti-dimensional. Its complex cultural patterns fit with the intricate\r\nvariety of its geologic wonders and its flora and fauna. In reality, New\r\nMexico is a part of a broader concept, the Southwest. This vast region,\r\nwhich includes western Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, southern California,\r\npart of southern Colorado, and southern Utah, has given rise to some of\r\nman’s greatest achievements. Here prehistoric man rose above his animal\r\nheritage to take control of these lands. Here, also, many millennia\r\nlater, man achieved one of his greatest scientific wonders, the\r\nsuccessful release of atomic energy. The story of the years between\r\nthese events, so far separated in time, is a wondrous tale.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN BEGINNINGS\r\n\r\nBefore the coming of the white man, this land belonged to nature’s\r\nchildren, the Indian. Centuries before European nations came into\r\nexistence, peoples from Asia, crossing by the Bering waters, had\r\ndiscovered, explored, and settled the American continents from Alaska to\r\nTierra del Fuego. They mastered the plains, the northern forests, the\r\njungles of Central and South America, and the arid regions. In the\r\ndeserts and mountains of the Southwest, they conquered elements and\r\nterrain, first to survive and then slowly to ascend the ladder of\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nAt first they were foragers, living on what nature provided. At the time\r\nof Christ, several groups could be distinguished: In the Colorado River\r\ndrainage, south of the Grand Canyon, were the Yuman Foragers; in\r\nsoutheastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico were the Mogollon\r\npeople; in the Four Corners area (where the states of Utah, Colorado,\r\nArizona, and New Mexico meet) and in the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico\r\nwas a complex of cave sites that evidenced a forager type of culture.\r\nBut, as man always aspires to rise above his environment, the Indian\r\nslowly and painfully learned to make tools, developed new techniques,\r\nand finally made the great step upward; he domesticated plants.\r\nAgriculture, based primarily on the growing of corn, came to the Four\r\nCorners before the Christian era. Gradually, out of the primitive\r\nforagers, there developed across the Southwest a complex pattern of\r\nagricultural societies; peaceful farmers intent upon harvesting the\r\nutmost from a harsh land. In Arizona, the Hohokam peoples created a\r\nculture based upon irrigation. In the valleys of the upper Gila and\r\nMimbres rivers of southwestern New Mexico, several branches of the\r\nMogollon culture grew and prospered. In the Four Corners area and in the\r\nupper Rio Grande Valley, the Mesa Verde, the Gran Chaco, and later the\r\nRio Grande branches developed, at first in the cliffs of the high\r\ncountry, then in open villages along the main tributaries of the Rio\r\nGrande. That there were numerous and varied cultures is attested to by\r\nthe ruins one finds scattered throughout the Southwest. Along now dry\r\narroyos, on buttes overlooking rivers or dry river beds, among cliffs in\r\nthe mountain fastnesses and in caves wherever they appear, there are\r\nthousands of sites whose people and history are lost in antiquity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Prehistoric Indian cliff dwelling]\r\n\r\nAnd these people were builders. They lived in caves at first, then in\r\ncrude pit houses. Finally they moved above the ground and evolved\r\nbuilding techniques and styles of architecture that stood the ravages of\r\ntime and still serve the people of the Southwest. In the city of Santa\r\nFe, the Palace of the Governors was built upon the ruins of an Indian\r\npueblo (village), the name of which has disappeared even from tradition,\r\nand its massive walls of puddled adobe, laid down before the art of\r\nmaking bricks was introduced by the Spanish, may be seen under glass in\r\nsome of the rooms of the Palace at the present time. Perhaps most\r\nspectacular are the great houses of Chaco Canyon, some of which must\r\nhave sheltered from one to two thousand people each, and which as\r\nachievements in building, both from the standpoint of durability and\r\ngraceful construction, rival the structures of the historic valleys and\r\nplateaus of the ancient eastern world.\r\n\r\nIn addition to agriculture and building, the Indian of the Southwest\r\nachieved great heights in artistic forms. The ceramics of the American\r\nSouthwest become increasingly important when compared with products of\r\nthe Old World. The Indians of America and the Southwest are a race of\r\nartists. Their aesthetic culture towers above anything achieved by the\r\nwhite man, with the general exception of ancient Greece and Renaissance\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nAs impressive as his achievements in domesticating plants, in building\r\nmassive structures, and in developing symbolism and aesthetic values to\r\nmatch his material advances, the Indian’s greatest heights were reached\r\nin his philosophy on nature and life. He conceived himself to be, not\r\nmaster of creation, but a single factor in the scheme of things. He\r\nshared with all things—beasts, birds, rocks, trees, everything in\r\nnature—a life principle which permeated all, a gift conferred by the\r\nmighty powers of earth and sky. He observed orderly procession of\r\nnatural phenomena and ordered his own life in harmony therewith. His was\r\nno egocentric point of view which has become so much a part of the\r\nphilosophic base of the European mentality. His natural philosophy\r\nentered into every facet of his life—his daily work, his art, his\r\nceramics, his religion. In short, this singularly fine outlook upon the\r\nworld helps to account for his success in conquering the diverse\r\nelements of earth and sky which constantly threatened his very\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBut this fine culture did not survive in the fullness of its bloom. What\r\neventually destroyed the vast and complicated agricultural system was\r\nnot the rigors of Mother Nature but a migration of new people into the\r\nflow of Southwest history. Sometime after 1000 A.D., a nonfarming,\r\nnomadic, warlike people entered the Southwest. The peaceful farmers,\r\nweakened by drouth, were unable to cope with this new force. Gradually\r\nthey fell back, leaving behind their homes, their fields, their culture.\r\nBy 1300, only a small remnant remained, that located in the Rio Grande\r\nValley of north-central New Mexico. Across the rest of the Southwest the\r\nnomadic tribes, technically called _Athapascan_ from their linguistic\r\naffiliation but better known by their modern name, _Apache_, had\r\nreplaced the farming cultures. The picturesque Indian pueblos we see\r\ntoday in the valleys of northern New Mexico are the direct descendants\r\nof the great cultures that existed at Mesa Verde, Gran Chaco, Frijoles,\r\nand other centers of cultural achievement.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Rio Grande Valley and the Apache who controlled most\r\nof the Southwest managed an uneasy coexistence. The Pueblo Indians\r\nremained basically farmers, holding fast to the cultural advances made\r\nby their ancestors during the millennium preceding 1300. The Apache, for\r\nthe most part, remained nomadic predators, living off nature’s bounty,\r\nor better still, raiding the pueblos for food. The Apache groups began\r\nto take on names and traditional areas which they called their own. In\r\nnorthern New Mexico were the Jicarilla Apache and in the southeast, the\r\nLipan, the Mescalero, and the Natage Apache. In northeastern Arizona\r\nwere the Navajo and in the drainage of the Gila River, the Chiricahua,\r\nthe Gila, and other groups of the Western Apache. Each of these groups\r\nmade its mark upon the face of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH CONTRIBUTIONS\r\n\r\nThis was the situation in the Southwest when the sixteenth century\r\nopened, but a new force was abroad which would grow and strengthen and\r\nleave a deep imprint on New Mexico. Beginning on the wild islands of the\r\nCaribbean and then fanning out into the heart of Mexico and the South\r\nAmerican continent, this new force spread across the face of America.\r\nEuropeans, more exactly, Spaniards, came bent upon conquest for its own\r\nreward, for the glory of God, and for gold. These sturdy men from the\r\nIberian peninsula with weapons vastly superior to the Indians’, with the\r\nhorse which made them highly mobile and devastating in battle, and with\r\ntactics and precision in warfare unknown among the Indians, were to\r\nsweep without serious setback across the great cultures of Mexico and\r\nCentral and South America. By 1540, they were ready to take their next\r\nleap forward.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of Mexico, at a place called Culiacan, a colorful host\r\ngathered. In their ears rang the words of the legend of the Seven Cities\r\nof Cibola, seven golden cities, a legend which had been popular in Spain\r\nfor many generations. Mexico City had produced wealth, and the Spanish\r\nwere ready to believe that other fabulous cities existed. One Spaniard\r\nhad already crossed part of North America and had heard from the Indians\r\ntales of the rich cities. His name was Cabeza de Vaca, and the\r\nexuberance of his tales fired the imagination of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers and adventurers gathering in Mexico, commanded by Francisco\r\nVasquez de Coronado, were the first Europeans to organize an expedition\r\nto the American Southwest. Leaving from Culiacan in 1540, they went up\r\nthe west coast of Mexico into modern Arizona, then east into New Mexico.\r\nThe seven golden cities turned out to be the pueblos around Zuni, New\r\nMexico, and not golden at all. The expedition, although discouraged,\r\nmarched into the Rio Grande Valley and visited most of the pueblos\r\nthere. Still they failed to find the treasure they sought. In a final\r\ndesperate attempt, they explored onto the Great Plains, eventually\r\nreaching central Kansas. Broken in spirit and body, they struggled back\r\nto the Rio Grande Valley, and then retraced their route to Mexico. In\r\nall, the expedition covered a two-year span. A failure? Yes, in terms of\r\nwealth and treasure found. Yes, in terms of conquest, for nothing had\r\nbeen conquered. No, in terms of human resources, for the Indians\r\nCoronado met were to be the incentive that would bring the Spaniard back\r\nto New Mexico. While the Spaniard did seek gold and glory, he also\r\nburned with a missionary zeal and sought souls for his deep-running\r\nreligion, Roman Catholicism.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Mesa top pueblo]\r\n\r\nFor fifty-five years after Coronado, interest in New Mexico and the\r\nSouthwest was spotty. Other things occupied the Spanish—primarily silver\r\ndiscoveries in the central valleys of Mexico. But men did not forget New\r\nMexico and saw there an opportunity for missionary activity and\r\nexploitation. Also, other nations of Europe were beginning to take an\r\ninterest in the North American continent, and New Mexico began to look\r\nattractive to the Spanish as a frontier defensive outpost. The frontier\r\nline pushed ever northward from central Mexico. By 1595, the Spanish\r\nwere ready to push a salient into New Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom among the mining communities of northern Mexico, a force of two\r\nhundred colonists was assembled by Don Juan Oñate who had a contract to\r\ncolonize New Mexico. After countless delays due to politics and supply\r\nshortages, the Oñate expedition left Chihuahua in 1598. The route went\r\nnorth across the desert to the Rio Grande near El Paso del Norte (modern\r\nJuarez), thence up the Rio Grande into New Mexico. On August 18, 1598,\r\nthey arrived at San Juan, and there founded the first capital of New\r\nMexico, San Juan de los Caballeros. These lands of the Southwest so long\r\ncolored by the Indian now received a new imprint, one that would alter\r\nthe direction and flow of culture and change it from the Indian to the\r\nSpanish Southwest.\r\n\r\nFrom San Juan, and later (1610) from Santa Fe, Oñate, his men, and his\r\ncolonists brought New Mexico under the Spanish yoke. In co-operation\r\nwith the Franciscan Order, which had been assigned the task of\r\nconverting the Indian, Oñate supervised the building of missions and\r\nmission churches at many of the pueblos of New Mexico. At the same time,\r\nSpanish towns developed, the most important being the new capital at\r\nSanta Fe. By 1628, New Mexico was solidly in the hands of her new\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nThe period from 1628 to 1680 was one of internal conflict and isolation\r\nfor New Mexico. It lay far out on the frontier, alone and distant from\r\nits source of supplies. It lacked many of the items necessary for\r\nfrontier life, particularly hardware and clothing. Its population was\r\nsmall, and in constant fear of Indian uprising, and its officials were\r\ntoo weak to act with vigor. Finally, there was a lack of genuine\r\ninterest on the part of the central authorities. All these problems led\r\nto internal conflicts between soldier and colonist; between colonist and\r\nIndian; between colonist and official; and, perhaps most bitter of all,\r\nbetween church and state. This latter conflict would erupt time after\r\ntime, openly, and with bitterness and denunciation from both sides.\r\nGovernors were excommunicated as heretics; Franciscans were accused of\r\nall sorts of crimes and improper behavior. This, plus the other\r\nconflicts, gave rise to growing disrespect by the Indians for their\r\nEuropean conquerors. The superiority of Christianity was questioned by\r\nthe Indians as they watched the attacks and counterattacks made by\r\npriest and governor. The whole system of Spanish rule seemed a mockery.\r\nIn 1680, the Indians decided their way was best after all and rose in\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nLed by Po-pé from Taos, the various pueblos banded together in a mighty\r\neffort to remove the Spanish from traditional Indian lands. For the\r\nfirst time the pueblos came together, united by a single purpose. There\r\nwere two exceptions; Isleta, just south of Albuquerque, and the Piro\r\nvillages farther south (Socorro) remained loyal to the Spanish. Up and\r\ndown the Rio Grande Valley, the Spaniards fell before the pent-up anger\r\nof the Indians. Survivors gathered at Santa Fe, but their water supply\r\nwas cut, and they were forced to retreat south. At Isleta and later at\r\nthe Piro villages, they received aid before continuing south to El Paso\r\ndel Norte. With them went their Indian allies from Isleta and Socorro.\r\nIt was a total defeat for the Spanish, and the Indian again was master\r\nof New Mexico.\r\n\r\nBut not for long, for at El Paso there gathered a force dedicated to\r\nrevenge for their comrades who had died before the Indian onslaught.\r\nAbly led by Diego de Vargas, this expedition moved into New Mexico in\r\n1692. The Indians, who had achieved such unity for the moment in 1680,\r\nwere again badly divided. De Vargas, instead of having to subdue an\r\nalliance, had only to deal with one pueblo at a time. Very quickly New\r\nMexico was returned to a mission area and frontier military post. The\r\nPueblo Indians became permanently subjected to European domination.\r\nTheir one and only attempt at unity had, in the final analysis, failed.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, New Mexico was the\r\nheart of the Spanish empire in the Southwest. Only in southwestern\r\nArizona, western Texas, and California did the Spanish hold any land\r\nother than in the upper Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. During these\r\ncenturies, this valley complex played out its dual role of mission area\r\nand military outpost. Its only connection with the resources and ideas\r\nof the world was a long hazardous road that stretched from Santa Fe to\r\nChihuahua City and then south to Mexico City. This was New Mexico’s\r\nRoyal Road, and over it moved everything needed by soldier, priest, and\r\ncivilian. The trade was dominated by the merchants of Chihuahua, and New\r\nMexico suffered. The tale of New Mexico during this period was one of\r\npoverty, hardship, and warfare. And several vital forces moved across\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nOne of these forces had long been in the Southwest, but latent. The\r\nSpanish adopted an Indian word meaning _enemy_ to describe it—Apache!\r\nThe Spanish brought with them domesticated animals which quickly adapted\r\nto conditions of the New World and became available to the Indian. Most\r\nimportant was the horse, at least as far as the Apache was concerned. By\r\nthe early eighteenth century, the Apache, and other groups on the\r\nplains, had adapted to the use of the horse. While dangerous as foot\r\nsoldiers, the Apache became vastly more dangerous as mounted warriors.\r\nWhereas they had been satisfied with minor raids against the pueblos and\r\nthe Spanish holdings prior to 1700, they exploded on a wave of terrorism\r\nduring the eighteenth century which very nearly drove the Spanish from\r\nthe frontier. Late in the century, the conflict between the Apache and\r\nthe Spanish became increasingly bitter. The history of the Southwest\r\nbecame the history of incessant Indian incursions and Spanish attempts\r\nto control the raiders. The missions declined and in many instances gave\r\nway entirely to the presidio or fort. In New Mexico the military came to\r\ndominate the missionary, and only through the heroic efforts of the\r\nmeager force at the Presidio of Santa Fe did the Spanish manage to hold\r\nNew Mexico from total collapse. A poor province became poorer,\r\npopulation declined, both among the Spanish and Indian, and the future\r\nlooked dark indeed.\r\n\r\nFar from New Mexico, other forces were stirring which would have a\r\nprofound effect on the province and the Southwest. Spain and the Spanish\r\nempire were in trouble. Spain had failed to develop the supply\r\ncapability to keep her colonies alive and was forced to spend her wealth\r\nin other areas of Europe. After two and a half centuries, the cumbersome\r\nand inefficient colonial administrative machinery was breaking down.\r\nWhile Spain’s star was descending, other European nations were on the\r\nmove. England, France, Holland, and Russia were contesting with Spain\r\nfor control of the New World. England and France were digging in on the\r\neast coast of North America; Holland was penetrating the islands of the\r\nCaribbean, and Russia was pushing down the Pacific Coast from Alaska.\r\nThe weakness of Spain and the failure of her colonial government, plus\r\nhelp from Napoleon by way of his invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in\r\n1808, brought about the collapse of the Spanish empire. In America,\r\npatriots, inspired by the earlier success of the American Revolution and\r\nafire with the ideas of the French Revolution, struck out at the\r\nremnants of Spanish rule. By 1825, all the Spanish colonies but the\r\nislands of the Caribbean were free and independent nations. New Mexico\r\nand the Southwest became part of the Mexican state.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, Mexico, without leaders, without a political\r\nheritage to lead it to stability, and torn by power struggles large and\r\nsmall, was plunged into a period of political anarchy and civil war\r\nwhich would last for half a century. The problems and dangers of a\r\nfar-flung frontier were lost in the din of conflict, and New Mexico\r\nbecame a forgotten province. Its claims as a mission area were so weak\r\nas to be almost nonexistent. It was no longer needed as a military\r\noutpost, for the danger to Mexico was not external, but internal. Its\r\nreasons for being were forgotten, at least for the moment, and New\r\nMexico had to survive on her own initiative. But for one very important\r\nfact, the Spanish salient into the Southwest might have collapsed under\r\nthe weight of poverty and Indian attacks. That fact was the opening of\r\nthe Santa Fe Trail in 1821, a trail which linked the Spanish world with\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon world then pushing its frontiers out from Missouri. This\r\ntrail, so rich in lore and adventure, so much a part of the history of\r\nboth the American west and the Spanish north, was the door through which\r\npassed the characters for the final act in the history of the Southwest.\r\n\r\nBefore the final act, however, it is vital and necessary to set down the\r\ncontribution of two hundred fifty years of Spanish occupation and rule.\r\nThe coming of the Spaniard to the Southwest began a mixture of white and\r\nred races which resulted in a new mixed race. The first generation of\r\nthose who came up from Mexico were Caucasians; their descendants were\r\nusually not. They came seeking wealth and security, but there was\r\nneither wealth nor security in New Mexico, and they remained poor, very\r\npoor. The society that evolved was to be based upon farming and stock\r\nraising, and its organization was to be feudal in nature. There would be\r\nno education; hence, there could be no intellectual advance. The world\r\nbegan to go ahead of the people of New Mexico. Only in the house of the\r\nrico was there any sign of the wealth and grandeur of Spain; everywhere\r\nelse was poverty. Farming was left in the hands of the Indian, while the\r\nSpaniard chose to be a man on horseback, a cattleman, an aristocrat. In\r\nthe final analysis, Spanish New Mexico would not develop as democratic\r\nand agricultural, but aristocratic and feudal. The hacienda was a part\r\nof old Spain in exile. The rico tried vainly to hold to his idea of\r\nchivalry and to a decorum suitable to his position. But what chance was\r\nthere in the face of the increasing poverty, the constant danger to life\r\nand property, and time that did not move? While individual courage of\r\nthe upper class remained, discipline and industry died. When the\r\nAmerican army marched into the Southwest, the sons of the conquistadores\r\ncould offer no armed resistance. Perhaps the most amazing thing about\r\nthe society of the ricos in New Mexico was that it failed to contribute\r\nany lasting monument. It left no art, no music, no great highways, no\r\nadequate governmental system.\r\n\r\nBut many elements of Spanish culture were to persist, and these arose\r\nfrom the collective consciousness of the people of New Mexico. Around\r\nthe great haciendas were small villages with their artisans and workers.\r\nIt was among these people that the heritage of Spain clung to this land.\r\nMany of these towns yet remain and are not much different from those of\r\ntwo hundred years ago. To a large degree, their Spanish culture seems\r\nhidden and undiscovered, but the people, their loves and hates,\r\npleasures and hopes, beliefs and fears, are governed by tradition, a\r\ntradition that finds its roots deep in the soil of Spain.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Old mission church at Isleta Pueblo]\r\n\r\nToday, when we look at the cultural scene in New Mexico, we can see\r\ndirect evidence of Spanish occupation. The language of half the people\r\nin the state is Spanish, in some areas still the Spanish of the\r\nsixteenth century. Roman Catholicism, of which the Spanish were the most\r\nCatholic, dominates the religious scene. The Spanish heritage in\r\npolitical attitudes, in building and architecture, and in the legal\r\ntradition of the state is apparent. New Mexico, of all the states in the\r\nUnited States, is the only one that can claim a truly Spanish heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLO-AMERICAN VIGOR\r\n\r\nWhile Spain lost its empire and New Mexico and the Southwest sank into\r\npoverty and decay, yet another force was on the march, a force that\r\nwelled up in an Anglo-American people clinging to the Atlantic Coast of\r\nNorth America. As these people developed a nation, they also discovered\r\na sense of destiny which turned their faces to the west and their\r\nfootsteps toward the sunset. With them moved their culture. At first, it\r\nwas a trickle, a few traders bent on profit, crossing the plains on the\r\nSanta Fe Trail. Then the trickle became a flood. For New Mexico, these\r\nmen came as saviors. The Missouri traders broke the Chihuahua monopoly\r\nand goods from all parts of the world began to flow into New Mexico,\r\nresulting in higher standards of living. These Yankee traders, sensing a\r\ngood thing, also penetrated the markets of Mexico, using New Mexico’s\r\nRoyal Road to gain entrance.\r\n\r\nAgain there was conflict, not Spanish and Indian, but Latin and\r\nAnglo-American. Mexico owned the lands of the Southwest and intended to\r\nkeep them. But this American, with his gaze glued on western skies,\r\nrefused to turn aside, and he strode on, grinding the feeble efforts of\r\nMexican resistance into the desert sands. The Mexican War in 1846,\r\nsuddenly transferred ownership of Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada,\r\nArizona, and California from Mexico to the United States. This was\r\nnearly half the territory of Mexico. New Mexico, with her already\r\ncomplex cultural pattern, was subjected to still another influence.\r\n\r\nThe history of the American occupation of the Southwest is as complex\r\nand diverse as its predecessors. Its ingredients include cattle, mining,\r\nrailroads, agriculture, science, and the Indian. All these, and others,\r\ncombined to give an Anglo-American slant to the Southwest. The Indian\r\nculture did not disappear, nor did the Spanish, but rather a new stratum\r\nwas cast that was to complete the mosaic.\r\n\r\nWhen the American arrived in New Mexico, he found a poor, backward area,\r\nhungry for trade and outside contacts. He found the Indians of the\r\nSouthwest in open rebellion against the white men. The Navajo and other\r\nApache groups, the Comanche, and some of the Pueblos were the primary\r\noffenders. This was to be the main problem occupying the time and energy\r\nof the American settler and soldier for forty years after 1846. Until\r\nthe Indian situation was stabilized, there would be little economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\n\r\nThe method evolved for containing the vicious raids against friendly\r\nIndian, Spanish, and American communities was a series of forts placed\r\nat strategic passes or trails surrounding the traditional lands of the\r\nApache. The Indian strongholds were located primarily in the mountainous\r\nregions of southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. The line of\r\nforts stretched along the Rio Grande south of Socorro to the vicinity of\r\nLas Cruces, and west along the southern edge of the mountain escarpment\r\ninto Arizona. Then the defense complex ran north across the desert to an\r\nirregular line running east from Flagstaff through Gallup and back to\r\nthe Rio Grande. These forts were well garrisoned and provisioned and\r\nbegan to carry the fight to the Indian. Early success was halted by the\r\nconflict generated by the American Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe center of the Civil War in the west was in New Mexico. There was\r\nconflict, argument, and some small degree of fighting in other western\r\nstates and territories as settlers from the north or south struggled to\r\ncarry this territory or that state into the Union or the Confederacy.\r\nThese were, however, local matters and as much political as military. In\r\nNew Mexico, there was a war and there were battles, battles which\r\ndeserve to be a part of the general Civil War story but that are usually\r\nforgotten in the smoke and roar of eastern cannon.\r\n\r\nTwo major battles were fought in New Mexico, the first a Confederate\r\nvictory, the second a Union victory which saved New Mexico, and the\r\nwest, for the Union. The aim of the Confederate forces was to capture,\r\nintact if possible, the forts in New Mexico and Arizona with their great\r\nstore of military provisions, provisions badly needed by the Confederate\r\narmy. Also, there was a feeling among southern leaders that success in\r\nNew Mexico might also lead to success in California, badly split on the\r\nquestion of secession, and in Colorado, rich in silver and gold. An army\r\nrecruited in Texas and commanded by General Henry Sibley was sent to\r\naccomplish Confederate aims.\r\n\r\nThis army entered New Mexico along the traditional route, moving up the\r\nRio Grande from El Paso. It quickly subdued the forts and Union troops\r\nin southern New Mexico and continued up-river. On February 21, 1862, it\r\nmet a Union army commanded by Colonel E. R. S. Canby at Valverde, a\r\nsmall community about twenty miles south of Socorro, New Mexico. Kit\r\nCarson, New Mexico’s famous trapper and scout, commanded the New Mexico\r\nVolunteers, a part of the Union force. Canby’s troops were beaten and\r\ndispersed at the Battle of Val Verde, leaving the upper Rio Grande\r\nValley virtually without defense. Within a few weeks, the Texans had\r\ntaken Albuquerque and Santa Fe. But one stronghold in New Mexico\r\nremained in the hands of the Union forces. Fort Union, northeast of Las\r\nVegas, New Mexico, became the focal point of action by both north and\r\nsouth. Sibley, marching from Santa Fe, knew success depended on the fall\r\nof Fort Union. The Union forces, equally aware of the importance of the\r\nfort, hurriedly reinforced it with a number of volunteers from Colorado.\r\n\r\nWithin Fort Union, a crisis developed over differing opinions on\r\nstrategy. The fort commander wanted to keep the garrison at full\r\nstrength and fight the Confederates from within the fort. The Colorado\r\nVolunteers wanted to go out and meet the enemy. The latter won and a\r\nUnion force moved into the passes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to\r\nmeet the Confederates in a fateful battle that would decide control of\r\nthe west. It was fought at Glorieta Pass on March 28, 1862. Despite the\r\nfact that the two armies met on this field, the contest was not decided\r\nthere. Early on the morning of March 28, a force of 400 Colorado\r\nVolunteers, commanded by Colonel John M. Chivington, began a flanking\r\naction in hopes of hitting the Confederate rear. This group moved out of\r\nthe Pass into the mountains, and by a very difficult route moved back\r\ntoward the Pass behind the Confederate force. On a ridge overlooking\r\nApache Canyon, they saw below them the entire Confederate supply train\r\nand cavalry horse herd. In a lightning hit-and-run attack, the supply\r\ntrain and horses were destroyed. When word of this reached Sibley at\r\nGlorieta Pass, there was little for him to do but to retire from the\r\nfield. The Confederate force never recovered from this disaster and\r\ngradually retreated to Santa Fe, then back down the Rio Grande into\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the Civil War, New Mexico and the Southwest returned,\r\nnot to peace, but to war, war against the Apache. It took twenty years\r\nfor the American with all his modern weapons and tactics to bring the\r\nApache under control. For the Apache, it ended on September 3, 1886,\r\nwhen Geronimo and his few ragged followers surrendered to General Miles\r\nin Skeleton Canyon, Arizona. Under the weight of steel and increasing\r\nnumbers of white men, the Apache was doomed. Though civilization would\r\nswallow the Apache, as it has always succeeded against the barbarian,\r\nthe Apache made a spectacular defense of his lands and his way of life\r\nagainst both Spaniard and American. He made himself master of the\r\ndesert, and only the gods of science succeeded in overcoming him and his\r\ndesert gods.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL BOOM\r\n\r\nWith the Indian situation settled, New Mexico underwent a boom in two\r\nimportant areas, mining and cattle raising. These industries, so much a\r\npart of the history of the American West, did and still play an\r\nimportant role in the well-being of the Southwest. Mining camps sprang\r\nup along the mountain fringes as new discoveries of silver and gold came\r\nto light. Around Socorro and Magdalena, in the Mogollon Mountains, at\r\nHillsboro and Kingston in the Black Range, and hundreds of other places\r\nin New Mexico and the Southwest, men hungry for quick wealth swarmed\r\nover the hills and mountains and built their roaring camps. While miners\r\nwere tapping the subsurface wealth, cattlemen were staking out their\r\nclaims to the grasslands, both on the eastern plains and in the high\r\nmountain meadows. Cattle empires grew to staggering proportions,\r\nsometimes erupting into violent conflict over grazing and water rights,\r\nsuch as the Lincoln County War made famous by the participation of Billy\r\nthe Kid.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Feature of the Old West]\r\n\r\nThe character of the Southwest still bears the stamp of the miner and\r\nthe cattleman. Although the cattle and grazing industry has declined, as\r\nhas the traditional mining camp, the past importance of these activities\r\nhas had a tremendous impact upon the character of Southwest folklore,\r\nlaw, and music and on the thought of the people.\r\n\r\nOther influences affected New Mexico as a result of the American\r\noccupation, things inherent in the American culture. Ribbons of steel\r\nacross a continent, buildings of steel and stone, business and commerce,\r\ntechnology, common law, the English language, the Protestant religion,\r\nand, above all, the American-brought driving desire to dominate, to win.\r\nCertainly the American had to adapt his culture to the desert lands, but\r\nhe did it in his own way, not in the way of the Indian or Spaniard. So\r\nAnglo-American culture became superimposed upon a Spanish culture that\r\nwas superimposed upon an Indian culture.\r\n\r\n_Disinherited_, that is the word that best describes contemporary New\r\nMexico culture. A stronger race came and took away the inheritance of\r\nthe Indian, though there did result a blood mixture. Only in superficial\r\nmatters did the Spanish adopt any of the Indian ways. The Spanish, too,\r\nsuccumbed to a stronger people and have been denied the privilege\r\ncommonly accorded to conquered peoples, that of mixing their blood with\r\nthat of the conquerors. One finds today in New Mexico three distinct\r\npeople—Indian, Spanish, and Anglo-American—as sharply contrasted as the\r\nstrands in a Navajo blanket. There is pure red alongside white, and only\r\nrarely do the colors blend into pinks or grays. This is why we must say\r\nthat New Mexico is a mosaic, not a synthesis, of many elements, clearly\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nAcross the span of time, great men, people, and ideas have molded New\r\nMexico and Southwest history. Indian, Spanish, American—vital forces\r\nthat are today working toward a genuinely unique culture in New Mexico.\r\nThe modern world may well give to the Southwest the idea or catalyst\r\nthat will blend these elements into a single force. Science, techniques,\r\nideas are things of the present and are for the present to assess and\r\nsynthesize. The Indian gods of air, earth, and sky and the white man’s\r\ngods of morality and science do not differ a great deal in their\r\naspirations for their chosen people, and perhaps they will decree a\r\nsplendid and unique synthesis from the cultural mosaic. Through\r\nunderstanding comes knowledge; from knowledge, creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Exotic Plants of New Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _by_ Ross Calvin\r\n\r\nThe problem of discussing plant life becomes complicated, for some of\r\nthose arriving in New Mexico may be compound microscope botanists, some\r\ncollectors, others pathologists, still others geneticists. Some will be\r\nchemists or mathematicians, some others untrained in the ways of growing\r\nthings and mainly interested in seeing while they tour. But one thing is\r\nfairly certain—most visitors will come from a distance, so it may be\r\nuseful to invite them to observe what they can readily see on the way\r\nhither, which will be a relatively painless method of amassing some\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nYet the method of arrival itself suggests choices, options, and\r\nexercises in probability. Do visitors come in covered wagons, or in jet\r\nplanes; by bus, car, train, or some other way? The most convenient way,\r\ndoubtless, is by plane traveling six hundred miles an hour at a height\r\nof some thirty thousand feet; but the most rewarding way is by saddle or\r\non foot as the early collectors came.\r\n\r\nSince one cannot know his own country well if he knows no other, a\r\nvisitor from the east arriving at an altitude of five miles will\r\nprobably be more conscious than others of drastic changes in the\r\nlandscape when he first looks down on New Mexico. Instead of the\r\nuniversal green of the east, he will note the earth as an unaccustomed\r\ntawny, reddish brown expanse, and this will be its common color through\r\nmost months of the year. He will note the absence of rivers, but the\r\npresence of mountains which generally ring the horizon. He will wonder,\r\nafter traversing the border counties at the western edge of the Great\r\nPlains, at the infrequency of plowlands, and will promptly conclude that\r\nNew Mexico is one vast, bare desert—an impression that will be corrected\r\nrapidly when he visits the dark National Forests where the slim, crowded\r\nspruces and firs tower skyward.\r\n\r\nThe visitor from El Paso, as the Chihuahua desert (the name is fairly\r\ndeserved) slides backward underneath him, will be amazed at the\r\nserpentine stripe of vivid verdure below, all completely leveled, and\r\nall marked off by geometrical lines and tightly bordered by pale hills\r\nwhere the vegetation is reduced to tiny dots not tall enough to cast a\r\nshadow. Still proceeding north, he will presently be above a ninety-mile\r\nstretch where the vegetation is so skimpy and the river so closely boxed\r\nin by desolate hills that Spanish explorers bestowed on it the sinister\r\nname _Jornada del Muerto_—Dead Man’s Journey, which is self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, a visitor descending into New Mexico from the\r\nnorthland in wintertime above this same Rio Grande will traverse a\r\nfeatureless jumble of peaks on which the black coniferous forest no\r\nlonger shows as black at all but, snow-encased, gleams as white as the\r\nnaked snowfields themselves. And he will find incredible the immense\r\nrange of climate spanned in a flight only an hour long.\r\n\r\nThe jet traveler approaching from the west beholds the greatest, most\r\nspectacular panorama of all, the true wasteland of the desert, with vast\r\nblocks uplifted from out of earth’s crust, plateaus dissected by giant\r\nempty canyons whose walls are seared to utter nudity by ages of the most\r\nintense sunshine on our continent. Here the architecture of nature is\r\nall designed on a gigantic scale, and the climate exhibits influences of\r\na mighty ocean, of towering mountain chains, and the range of wandering\r\nplanetary winds which created the desert. From the altitude of a\r\ncruising jet, the distances, the speed, the color, and the light are\r\nindescribably exhilarating.\r\n\r\nSince the traveler arriving from any direction can see for\r\nidentification only a few species, it will suffice to point out only two\r\nof the harbingers of eastern New Mexico, both of which are dominant on\r\nthat area of the Great Plains: the blue grama grass, which in fall and\r\nwinter bears the graceful sickle-shaped head, and the small _Yucca\r\nglauca_ which cannot be mistaken for anything else.\r\n\r\nAlong the northern line, the visitor should look for the somber, almost\r\nblack, forest of spruce and fir with its white patches of aspen on the\r\n10,000-foot slopes. Descending farther southward, even a casual observer\r\nwill note that these species give way first to the yellow pines, then to\r\nthe junipers (“cedars”) and dwarf pines or piñons. The visitor arriving\r\nfrom the south will find most conspicuous of all the olive-green\r\ncreosote bush in its summer-winter foliage, next, the omnipresent\r\nmesquite (_Prosopis_), then the various _Opuntia_ cacti (chollas and\r\nprickly pears), and the yuccas.\r\n\r\nAs he comes in from Arizona, the splendid saguaros will beckon him\r\ntoward the gateway of New Mexico, but they will nowhere enter it\r\nthemselves. The vase-shaped body of the ocotillo consisting of\r\nunbranching, ten-foot wands should be recognized at a glance, as\r\nlikewise should the various yuccas and agaves. And in early springtime,\r\na low tree with a rounded mass of golden bloom will joyously proclaim\r\nits identity as a paloverde.\r\n\r\nThe desert plants thus enumerated can be recognized along various\r\nstretches of U.S. 66 as one holds his speed at a conservative ninety or,\r\neven better, at a conservative sixty.\r\n\r\nThe amateur scientist will need to do some homework before he learns\r\nmuch systematic botany or plant physiology. It takes considerable study\r\nto comprehend the slow, age-long process which has resulted in the\r\nevolution of all this grotesque vegetation: the interaction of extreme\r\naridity, high temperature, low humidity, high evaporation, infrequent\r\nprecipitation, the hostility of numerous chemical solutions, and the\r\nnatural rapacity of the animal population. Each plant must have an\r\nadaptation of its own, from the tiny winter annual, which must race\r\nthrough its course from a tender rosette to ripened seed before the\r\nsearing sunshine arrives, on up through the series to the stoic saguaro,\r\nwhich seems able to scorn nature’s enmity.\r\n\r\nA final warning to the air traveler. He should be sure before deplaning\r\nthat he has observed a _bajada_. It is a must. Bajada is one name,\r\noutwash slope is another, alluvial fan is still another. The stewardess\r\nshould inquire of each student, and if his answer is “no,” she should\r\nreply, “Then you’ve just flunked the course.” A bajada is the most\r\ncharacteristic single feature of all in the sloping, stony topography of\r\nthe desert—and remember that the surface of the desert is regularly\r\nsloping and stony. The Spanish word itself means only a down slope, but\r\nit has come to have a semitechnical sense—a fan-shaped apron of rocky\r\ndebris at the foot of a mountain where it has settled out of the summer\r\ntorrents and there keeps accumulating in successive floods. As the mass\r\nbuilds up, the bigger fragments drop out closest to the parent crag,\r\nthen the small ones, finally the coarse gravel, and lowest of all on the\r\nslope the fine sand. Thus the fragments are graduated in size, in\r\ndistance traveled, and in the nature of soil resulting. As the fan\r\nincreases in size and laps up higher and higher on the mountain’s flank,\r\nthe geologists often describe the result by saying that the mountain “is\r\nburying itself under its own debris.” From the air, the lines of\r\ndrainage will be seen to have assumed the form of a tree with its trunk\r\ndownward, its branches high in air. But the most interesting aspect of a\r\nbajada is the nice proportion which nature works out between the plant\r\nspecies and their location on the curve.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SAGEBRUSH TO SPRUCE TREES\r\n\r\nThe traveler who has viewed the Southwestern panorama of nature from its\r\nsagebrush to its spruce trees has indeed seen most of it. The spruce\r\nwhich grows wild only well up on the higher mountains is familiar to\r\neverybody because it has become a favorite in formal planting\r\neverywhere. But the sages—who knows them? To the tenderfoot, almost any\r\ngray plant is “sage.” To my friends the cowmen, sage means commonly\r\nsaltbush. To my friends the foresters, sage means an artemisia. But\r\nthere are romantics to whom “purple sage” is Apache plume, which is a\r\nmember of the wild rose family.\r\n\r\nSome popular education would seem to be desirable. And this applies,\r\ntoo, to the cacti, for there is more misinformation about them than\r\nanything else that grows, runs, or creeps—except rattlesnakes. The\r\nclever people who design travel folders and pictorial maps almost always\r\nput saguaros in New Mexico. But saguaros do not grow in New Mexico. That\r\nis final! And the yucca is not a cactus. That also is final. Nor yet the\r\nocotillo—that defiant, splendid denizen of the desert which flaunts the\r\nscarlet torch of flowers. The question that is always on the surface as\r\none writes of plant life in the Southwest is, “Who wants to know?” The\r\npicnicker wants to know the names—and nothing much besides—of the wild\r\nflowers. My friend the cowman already has the names; that is, the common\r\nones. If I chance to mention blue grama grass, he gently corrects me,\r\n“black grama.” Then if I mention black grama, he says, “no, white\r\ngrama.” But at least he is concerned about something more important than\r\nnonscientific names. He wants to know if the plant is something that a\r\nlean old cow can eat, whether it stays green in winter, and if it will\r\nhold the soil in place. The tourist who pilots car and passengers some\r\nsix hundred miles between breakfast and bedtime asks only what he was\r\nlooking at. The rest of us who go into the mountains often enough to be\r\nimpressed by the layer-cake succession of plants on their slopes can,\r\nwith the aid of some reading, amass a store of knowledge where others\r\namass only mileage. On a tour, it is mileage or knowledge. One has to\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nActually, our New Mexico desert is not dominated by sage. That honor is\r\nheld by the creosote bush, called by some of the old-timers\r\n_greasewood_, _Covillea glutinosa_, by some of the scientists—along with\r\nfive other synonyms. Like the mesquite with which it shares the same\r\ngeneral habitat but _does not intermix_, it occupies an immense spread\r\nof territory, roughly from Texas to California. Since no livestock will\r\neat it and the ground it occupies is equally useless for agriculture\r\nbecause of aridity and stoniness, creosote is a veritable coyote for\r\nsurvival. The traveler descending from Taos to Santa Fe need not look\r\nfor it. The sage of that locality, which gives the landscape its\r\nsingularly mournful aspect, is a true sage. With good reason the cowboys\r\ncall it _black sage_.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Lieutenant Emory, as he rode southward with the Army of the\r\nWest, first encountered the creosote as he approached Socorro. The\r\nnorthward extension of the plant is at the same point today, and the\r\nrange of mesquite extends only a few miles farther north. These two\r\nremarkable plants are the main markers of the Lower Sonoran Zone. In the\r\nsame arid, stony, broken country, the traveler will find an abundance of\r\ncacti, and these plants are usually supposed to be the most tenacious of\r\nall tenacious growing things. Actually, in southwestern Arizona and\r\nneighboring parts of California there are whole areas where the aridity\r\nis too severe for cacti, but for our state—let it stand. Everybody, of\r\ncourse, has noted the grotesque shape of the plants, but not everybody\r\nhas noted that the shape was chosen with a canny intelligence. A globe\r\nexposes less surface (that is, the vulnerable area for evaporation) than\r\nany other solid of equal volume. And a cylinder is second best. Another\r\nthing—cacti being succulents are filled with a watery sap or juice which\r\nquickly coagulates after a wound and stops the waste of moisture.\r\nFurthermore, the plant’s aggressive root system is arranged so as to\r\ncapture the grounds scanty moisture most quickly and completely after\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nCacti of more than sixty species occur within our state, but more than\r\nnine tenths of the plants seen along the highway—unless they are brought\r\ntogether for a garden collection—can be grouped into one genus, the\r\n_Opuntia_. The family likeness is shown not by the shape or general\r\nappearance but by the fact that all are jointed. Both the cane cactus\r\n(also called cholla and elkhorn) and the pancaked prickly pear, unlike\r\nthe big barrel cactus and the numerous small species which resemble it\r\nin shape, have joints and may therefore be rightly called opuntias. The\r\n“pancakes,” it may be remarked, are not leaves but divisions of the\r\nstem. A cactus gets along without leaves. So a good rough-and-ready test\r\nis this: if it has leaves, it is not a cactus—which eliminates ocotillo,\r\nyucca, agave, sotol, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe barrel cactus is sure to be seen growing beside service stations in\r\nthe southern part of the state. Its name as well as its size identifies\r\nit. The flowers and the large lemon-shaped fruits are worth a glance. If\r\nthey do not occur on the south side of the plant, it has been\r\ntransplanted and turned. The evidence is as trustworthy as the presence\r\nof moss on the north side of a tree in the forest.\r\n\r\nThe barrel cacti, the opuntias, acacias, the ocotillos, along with the\r\ncreosote and mesquite already mentioned, have a way of growing along\r\ntogether in what is called a plant society. These all belong in the\r\nbottom layer of the cake called the Lower Sonoran Zone, which is best\r\nseen on the Rio Grande mesas near El Paso.\r\n\r\nThe layer next above it comprises the foothill country of the Upper\r\nSonoran Zone, which includes most of the state of New Mexico. Some of\r\nits common markers are juniper, piñon, oak of various species including\r\nlive oak, mountain mahogany, mescal, yucca, beargrass, and the famous\r\nblue grama grass. It is exhibited all along the Continental Divide in\r\nthe southwest part of the state but nowhere so well as in the Fort\r\nBayard Reservation. There a tract, protected for three generations from\r\nwoodcutting, fires, and intensive grazing, offers a large-scale picture\r\nof the lovely land that once was New Mexico. There the character and\r\namount of vegetation astounds the visitor who is familiar with only the\r\nclose-picked, parched aspect of the landscape that generally borders the\r\nmain highways. When seen from the air, the very color of the\r\ngrass-mantled earth is many shades lighter than that of the bare\r\novergrazed ranges a few miles to the south. And the difference can be\r\nseen by anybody.\r\n\r\nThe foothills are dotted, not covered, with juniper and piñon. The\r\ndwarfed, rounded little junipers (properly enough called cedars) leave\r\nthe traveler unprepared to believe that they will anywhere become\r\nrespectable forest trees. Yet in the Burro Mountains, the alligator-bark\r\nspecies, finest of them all, reaches a diameter of five feet and an age\r\nof about 1000 years. The wood has an extraordinary fragrance, and its\r\nsmoke tells the neighbors for blocks around that you are warming\r\nyourself at the fireplace. Another notable thing about the wood is its\r\nresistance to decay in the earth. I have removed pieces of it from\r\nsubterranean ruins of the Mimbres culture which, according to the best\r\narchaeological opinion, are some eight hundred years old.\r\n\r\nThe yuccas deserve a story by themselves. One small, unimpressive\r\nspecies greets you on the meadows at the foot of Raton Pass; others have\r\nto be searched out along high limestone ridges where the foothills are\r\ndeciding to become mountains. The one chosen for our state flower is the\r\ntall yucca (_Yucca elata_), a superb species best seen along the\r\nContinental Divide near Silver City. The genus reaches its greatest size\r\nin the grotesque Joshua tree, which never fails to attract the eye on\r\nthe Mohave desert in California.\r\n\r\nThe century plant has a name that always gets attention. But let us be\r\nsure we mean the same thing. Rightly, it means the mescal, the favorite\r\nfood of the Mescalero Apaches. Besides these two names, it is called\r\nalso maguey and, no doubt, Spanish dagger along with various other\r\nspine-tipped plants. All of which clinches the argument for a name which\r\nfor all users is a certain designation for one object and only one. It\r\nis not just because botanists like to appear learned that they call this\r\nplant _Agave parryi_. That title is as descriptive as middle C for one\r\nkey on the piano, and in the same way international.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Yucca plants]\r\n\r\nEveryone inquires about the century plant’s life expectancy. An\r\ninsurance man might make an inference from the name. The plant is a big\r\ncompact cluster or rosette of rigid, upward-pointing, spadelike leaves,\r\neach four or five inches in width and each tipped with a vicious, stout\r\nthorn. Year after year the plant just sits there by a boulder,\r\nunnoticed. I question whether anything alive on the desert has a better\r\nlife expectancy. As far as my observations go, it has no diseases. It is\r\ninvincible to drouth. Freezing does not harm it, and fire cannot burn\r\nit—although a yucca even when green will flame up like a torch. No\r\nhungry old cow can crop it, and no rodent gnaws it, at least not enough\r\nto do harm. And since the Indians have gone on reservations, no human\r\nuses it. So it stays there.\r\n\r\nIn fact, nothing less than a caterpillar can leave a dent on it—not, of\r\ncourse, the caterpillar that eats young tomato plants, but the\r\nCaterpillar that pulls heavy road machinery. The plant just does not die\r\nbefore maturity, it would seem. A remarkable organism, indeed! But after\r\nmany, many years, depending on the amount of moisture it receives, it\r\nmakes up its mind to flower. In one tremendous effort, it shoots up a\r\ntwelve-foot flower stalk at the rate of several inches a day. The\r\nblossoming is a final, dramatic, beautiful gesture, for by the time the\r\nflowers have withered, the great tenacious plant has turned to a ghastly\r\npurple and is dead.\r\n\r\nOn the high slopes where the last yuccas end and only a few junipers\r\nremain in the race for survival, the yellow pines come in to mark off\r\nwhat is called the Transition Zone. The pines need no description, no\r\nprinted promotion. The traveler, any traveler, can appreciate them\r\nalthough he might not be stirred to the slightest interest by the lovely\r\nyuccas. Since the beginning of time, the pines, fragrant, cheerful,\r\ncompanionable, have been man’s best friend. Among the ponderosa pines\r\ntakes place most of the hunting, most of the camping, much of the\r\npicnicking. There is no danger that the tourist will overlook the pine\r\nbelt and the pines for they are probably the most numerous tree in New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Piñon needles]\r\n\r\nAbove them, the classifications are less clearly defined and ecologists\r\nare less inclined to agree on zonation. The Canadian Zone, if we settle\r\non that name, occurs only in small areas on the map, and most of them\r\nnorth of Santa Fe. These are high ridges and island peaks that tower\r\nhigh enough to tempt the Engelmann spruces. Yet some of these islands\r\noccur as far south as the Mogollon Mountains and thus bring Canadian\r\nZone scenes almost to the Mexican border. For hardy ecologists who want\r\nto explore high ridges and horns of bare stone which rise as clean as a\r\nhound’s tooth clear up into the Arctic-alpine Zone, it is necessary to\r\nenter Colorado.\r\n\r\nEngelmann spruce forests may be associated with the 10,000-foot level.\r\nThe blue spruce is very similar, perhaps only a subspecies, but it comes\r\nin a little lower. The Engelmann makes a dense forest hardly allowing\r\ninvaders, but the blue is more tolerant, less austere. It loves the\r\nwater and is the natural companion of chill, cascading trout streams.\r\nThough fond of shadow, it seems to grow equally well where the narrow\r\ncanyons widen and admit the sunshine upon the tiny meadows of lush\r\ngrass, cranesbill, velvety red cinquefoils, lupines, and yellow\r\ncolumbines. And when one of these miniature openings is fringed with\r\nspruces whose pointed tips rise sharp against a curtain of azure with\r\nits white cumulus clouds, there you have the loveliest vista in the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR VISIBLE IMPACT ON THE PLANT LIFE\r\n\r\nThough nature lovers usually find the life zones more fascinating than\r\nany other aspect of plants in the mountains, there is one other much\r\nmore important. It is the misuse, injury, and destruction of native\r\nplant life. Because scientists are generally alert to the conservation\r\nof what is useful and beautiful in natural resources, I venture to bring\r\nup the matter here.\r\n\r\nA useful case history is provided by Silver City, New Mexico. It was\r\nfounded in the early seventies as a silver camp, which would fairly\r\nguarantee a certain amount of reckless haste and rowdy carelessness.\r\nPoint two was its location on a foothill watershed only twenty-seven\r\nsquare miles in area. Point three was an extreme concentration of\r\nlivestock near the town. Point four was the fact that the annual\r\nrainfall was crowded mainly into July, August, and a part of September.\r\n\r\nMines are naturally users of timber. Obviously, shafts and tunnels have\r\nto be timbered. More than that, little smelters nestled back among the\r\nhills were also hungry for wood. And since coal was expensive and hard\r\nto get, most of the adobe cottages were heated many years by juniper,\r\noak, and piñon firewood. All these matters were naturally, if not\r\nactually, inevitable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe massive ore wagons and freight wagons had to be drawn by four- to\r\nten-horse teams—and the horses kept on eating. Then because it was also\r\na ranching country, each cowboy had to keep a _remuda_ of saddle\r\nhorses—and they ate too. Also, the few cows that provided milk for the\r\nchildren grazed hungrily over the stony slopes. Most of all, the range\r\ncattle, which had no provender at all except that which the competitive,\r\nhalf-starved steers could provide for themselves, overgrazed every\r\nsquare foot of pasturage down to the bare soil. The government’s\r\nopen-range policy made overgrazing inevitable because no ranchman could\r\nprotect his pasturage since it was all unfenced. The cow that got there\r\nfirst got the grass. That passed as land management, which proves that\r\nsome statesmen then were about as wise as some of the Wizards of\r\nWashington now. But the advent of fences caused the cutting of millions\r\nof fence posts where none should have been cut.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Elk]\r\n\r\nWhen the grass went, its roots went, and when its roots went, there was\r\nnothing to hold the soil, and then it, too, started to go. And go it\r\ndid. A deep hole formed in Main Street, as it is still called on the\r\nSilver City town plat. The best explanation I can find of that hole is\r\nthat earth was taken out of it to form adobe bricks for the walls of\r\nhouses and corrals (that clay did make good adobe!). Meanwhile, the\r\nwoodhaulers’ wagons had greedily carted away the trees from each little\r\ncanyon, while the narrow steel tires cut deep ruts which formed two deep\r\ngullies at the first heavy rain. Then the parallel gullies proceeded to\r\nwash out deeper and create a middle ridge or high center on which axles\r\ngot stuck. Since there was nobody responsible for making a new road,\r\nthere was no choice except to move over and form another track and use\r\nit until in turn it became unusable. (By this simple kind of\r\ndestruction, the old Santa Fe Trail, it is said, reached a width of a\r\nhundred feet.)\r\n\r\nBut the water descending the slope kept increasing its destructive\r\nvelocity as the denuded ground approached the bareness of a tin roof.\r\nVillagers observed that the hole in their Main Street was becoming a\r\nwaterfall after each rain, and that the ruin was passing into a big-time\r\noperation. The town built a dam to restrain the floods. It washed out in\r\nthe first one. Soon Main Street followed it down the drain, which by\r\nthis time was already a hideous gash in the earth many miles long and\r\ntwenty feet deep. Then the water began on a really different scale of\r\ndestruction. One furious flood washed away the cabin in which Billy the\r\nKid’s mother lived. More than that, it washed away the wall of Judge\r\nNewcomb’s house and abducted his Steinway from the second floor. A few\r\nyards from the spot, an old photograph taken in 1891 shows a\r\nwoodhauler’s ox team lying in the street there. It gives no hint at that\r\ntime of the famous Big Ditch—the only name that Main Street, Silver City\r\nhas had now for the last forty years.\r\n\r\nBy 1927, after many other attempts had been made to tame the floods a\r\nsteel bridge about one hundred feet long and thirty feet above the floor\r\nof the “canyon” was swung into place. In 1935-1936, the Soil\r\nConservation Service went to work in earnest, made the watershed a\r\ndemonstration area, and spent a third of a million dollars there in a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nIn the _New Mexico Magazine_ for August 1934, the really incredible\r\nstory of the Big Ditch is exactly documented with old photographs and\r\nnewspaper clippings. After a friendship of many years with old-time\r\nminers and ranchers at Silver City, I would not point an accusing finger\r\nat one of them. I appeal, however, for a greater vigilance over plant\r\nlife and soils nowadays from everybody. In such protected areas as the\r\nFort Bayard Reservation, the U.S. National Forest enclosures, and the\r\nfrontier cemeteries, the imagination can visualize a New Mexico that is\r\nfar different from what is here today—a close-picked, hard-used land\r\nwhere unwise woodcutting has continued through much of the last three\r\ncenturies and where the thin ranges have been required to support in the\r\nlast century alone perhaps more than one hundred million cows, sheep,\r\nand horses. The magnitude of the cause accounts for the magnitude of the\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nA good many years ago, I wrote as the concluding paragraph to _Sky\r\nDetermines_ what seemed to some exaggerated praise for my adopted\r\nhomeland. There is now less and less cavil from any readers. I believed\r\nthe words true in 1934, and I stand my ground now.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps nowhere in the world is the natural setting nobler than in New\r\n  Mexico—more beautiful with spacious desert, sky, mountain; more varied\r\n  in rich, energizing climate, more dramatic in its human procession,\r\n  more mellow with age-old charm. Endowed with sunshine that stimulates,\r\n  and winter chill that toughens; with silence and majestic desert color\r\n  that offer a spiritual companionship, it has enough. Here, if anywhere\r\n  is air, earth, sky fit to constitute a gracious homeland, not alone\r\n  for those who study and create, but as well for those who play, for\r\n  those who sit still to brood and dream.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Tyuonyi Pueblo ruin\r\n\r\n    This large ruin in Bandelier National Monument lies along the banks\r\n    of El Rito de los Frijoles. Narrow-leaf cottonwoods line the stream,\r\n    and shrubs of the Upper Sonoran Zone cover the hillside slopes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Dwellers in the Hills and Plains\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _by_ Levon Lee[1]\r\n\r\nThe vast sweep of New Mexico’s 77 million acres, which ranges all the\r\nway from the Alpine tundra of the tallest mountains down to the heat of\r\nthe lower Sonoran desert, offers a home and sanctuary for many kinds of\r\nwild life.\r\n\r\nSome of these animals are considered game animals; others may be pests,\r\nsince they prey upon or destroy what mankind regards as its own. The\r\ncoyote which takes a sheep from the small herder is wicked indeed in the\r\neyes of the sheepman. Predatoriness on all living things by other things\r\nhas gone on since time began and will continue—mankind being not the\r\nleast predator.\r\n\r\nA good definition is that composed by the late Judge C. M. Botts who\r\ndefined a predator as “a critter that takes another critter that I\r\nwant.”\r\n\r\nNew Mexico’s immense topographic and geologic differences make for a\r\nvery wide range of habitats preferred by the various species. The elk\r\nand deer, being highly adaptable, may be found from the Alpine tundra of\r\nthe higher mountains clear out into the creosote desert. Deer occur in\r\nfour separate subspecies: the Rocky Mountain and the desert mule deer,\r\nthe western whitetail, and the Sonoran fantail deer, which is also a\r\nwhitetail. These animals may be found all the way from the dense\r\nconiferous forests of the north with perpetual gloom and cold to the\r\nsun-scorched granite mountains such as the Florida and the Organ\r\nmountains of southern New Mexico; from great towering granite spires to\r\nthe folded blocks of limestone such as comprise the Big Hatchets, the\r\nGuadalupe, and the San Andres mountains.\r\n\r\nThe javelina, or little wild pig, lives along the watercourses in the\r\nsouth west part of the state. Its thin spiky hair gives it little or no\r\nprotection against cold, and only in the balmier parts of New Mexico\r\ndoes it feel at home.\r\n\r\nThe desert bighorn sheep, as distinguished from his cousin the Rocky\r\nMountain bighorn, goes around on a sun-scorched, ocotillo-covered\r\nlimestone-rubble slope in the full glare of the sun and lies down to\r\ntake his afternoon siesta. The Rocky Mountain bighorn, on the other\r\nhand, with his preference for cooler climates does not shun even the\r\ndense spruce timber at the very top of the Sandia Mountains as the\r\nhideout for his afternoon rest.\r\n\r\nThis adaptability by New Mexico’s species to the tremendous differences\r\nin altitude, rainfall, and temperature makes them all the more valuable\r\nas a resource for the pleasure and enjoyment of everyone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Photo courtesy of Forest Service_, U.S.D.A.)\r\n    Pack train on a wilderness trail]\r\n\r\nThe most popular big game animals in New Mexico are the mule deer in\r\neither of the two subspecies. Every fall, beginning in late October and\r\nextending ordinarily through December, more than 100,000 hunters take to\r\nthe woods for their 50-50 chance of bringing home the sought-after mule\r\ndeer. A hunter may shoot his mule deer at the Alpine tundra timber line,\r\nout in the blazing heat of the creosote desert, or among the rock crags\r\nof some of the southern desert mountains. He will find his quarry a\r\nworthy opponent. Shy, wild, and with terrific eyesight and hearing,\r\nthese animals provide a true challenge.\r\n\r\nElk and antelope, as well as bighorn sheep, are hunted by special\r\nlicenses only, since their numbers do not warrant a general open season.\r\nThese special licenses are much sought after and are ordinarily made\r\navailable by application and a public drawing in the fall. The javelina,\r\nconfined to our southwestern counties, is also hunted by special\r\nlicense. It is noteworthy that although New Mexico had protected them\r\nfor many years, the javelina did not increase its numbers. As a matter\r\nof fact, the natural losses applied against any game species are going\r\nto be in effect no matter whether hunting is permitted or not, the\r\nhunting being merely subtracted from what would be lost to nature\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\nOur state mammal, the black bear, is found throughout the wooded areas\r\nof the state and occasionally wanders out into the plains or down into\r\nthe desert mountains of the south. Bears are hunted avidly in the fall\r\nby sportsmen with dog packs before the regular big game seasons begin,\r\nwhen the use of dogs is prohibited. They are again hunted during the big\r\ngame seasons by anyone bearing the proper license, but no packs of dogs\r\nare allowed. This is to prohibit the possibility of dogs being used to\r\npursue elk, deer, or wild turkey, an illegal act in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is fortunate in having a tremendous diversity of both upland\r\ngame and waterfowl, and big game and small game for her people.\r\nImportantly, the game resources are spread out through every county in\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nThe state’s richness of bird life is varied and extensive. New Mexico\r\nranks among the first five in the total number of birds found within its\r\nboundaries. More than 400 species of birds live within the state. These\r\nrange all the way from the tiny mites of the bird kingdom, the\r\nhummingbirds, weighing less than an ounce, to the great white whistling\r\nswan, weighing up to 25 pounds, or the Merriam turkey, which may weigh\r\nclose to 30. Of the six species of quail found in the United States, New\r\nMexico has four and may possess the fifth, since the mountain quail of\r\nthe western coast have been introduced into this state and still occur\r\non the west slopes of the Sacramento Mountains near Tularosa. Five\r\nspecies of doves found throughout the state from the highest coniferous\r\nforest down into the scorching heat of the creosote desert are the Inca\r\ndove, ground dove, mourning dove, white-winged dove, and the bandtail\r\npigeon, all of them close relatives. Of these, only two, the mourning\r\ndove and the white-winged dove, are commonly hunted as game species.\r\n\r\nAn unexplained and precipitous decline struck the bandtail pigeon about\r\nten or twelve years ago, from which it apparently has never recovered.\r\nAlthough hunting was undoubtedly part of the pressure exercised against\r\nthese birds, it in no way accounted for their sudden and dramatic\r\ndecline in numbers. This decline may gradually be reversed, since more\r\nand more of these birds are being seen. It is well known that animals\r\nwith a high reproductive capacity can endure much heavier losses to\r\ntheir population than can those with low or very limited reproduction,\r\nsuch as the bandtail, which normally lays only a single egg. The\r\nmourning dove, on the other hand, lays two eggs at a time and may raise\r\nas many as five or more broods in one year. Take this one step further\r\nwith the scaled or Gambel quail, which may lay up to 12 or 15 eggs, and\r\nit can readily be seen that the population of bandtail pigeons can never\r\nendure the losses that the much more prolific mourning dove and quail\r\ncan. The same might be said by comparison of elk and deer. Elk do not\r\nbear their first young until their third year, and then the cow may not\r\nbear young but alternate years until her seventh or eighth year; by that\r\ntime she has begun to decline in vigor; in her total life she may not\r\nproduce more than four or five calves. The mule deer, on the other hand,\r\nstart bearing at the age of two, with their first birth normally single;\r\nfrom then on, twins are usual for the rest of the doe’s life. Thus, deer\r\nhave a considerably greater reproductive potential than do elk or\r\nbighorn sheep, which have one young at a time.\r\n\r\nThe fleet-footed antelope of the open rolling plains is another example\r\nof fairly high reproductive capacity, since they breed earlier than do\r\ndeer and normally bear twins. Antelope are confined to the more open\r\ncountry where their prodigious running ability and marvelous eyesight\r\nstand in good stead in protecting them against their natural enemies.\r\n\r\nThe wild turkey, classified by law in New Mexico as big game, is found\r\nthroughout the mountainous areas of the state, not excepting some of the\r\ndesert ranges. New Mexico is one of two states fortunate enough to\r\npossess three of the five forms of the wild turkey known to the United\r\nStates: the Merriam turkey, found in the higher elevations of the\r\nmountainous areas, usually the ponderosa forest; the Rio Grande turkey,\r\nconfined to the watercourses of the eastern plains; and the fairly rare\r\nMexican turkey, found in the Animas and Peloncillo mountains of extreme\r\nsouthwestern New Mexico. In Hildalgo County these mountains are actually\r\nlargely Mexican in both flora and fauna. Some of the rarest, most\r\nbeautiful birds of North America are also found in this area and nowhere\r\nelse in the United States with the exception of southeastern Arizona.\r\n\r\nOur most abundant game bird, the mourning dove, is found in every county\r\nof the state and nests from the coniferous forests of the north and the\r\nhigher mountains of the south clear out into the plains where there is\r\nnot a tree in sight for miles. Doves are extremely adaptable and very\r\nprolific. They provide the finest kind of sport shooting and are avidly\r\nsought, particularly by shotgun enthusiasts of the eastern and southern\r\nparts of the state.\r\n\r\nScaled quail are found throughout New Mexico, being absent only in\r\nelevations above 7000 feet. Even there, they periodically occur but are\r\nordinarily driven back by winter snow. Gambel quail are found throughout\r\nthe river courses of the Rio Grande Valley, the San Juan Valley, and the\r\nsouthwestern watercourses. The Mearns’ quail is found in the southern\r\nhalf of the state in the higher mountain elevations, whereas the\r\nbob-white quail occupies the grassy rolling sandhills of the eastern\r\ncounties where it is commonly found together with scaled quail.\r\n\r\nQuail hunting is one of the most popular sports in New Mexico and many\r\nthousands of hunters can hardly wait from one season to the next. New\r\nMexico is in the heart of the scaled quail country and provides some of\r\nthe finest shooting to be had anywhere.\r\n\r\nMigratory waterfowl, while not considered abundant, are not uncommon in\r\nthis state, known more for its aridity than for its rivers and lakes.\r\nThe two main fly ways are the Rio Grande Valley and the Pecos Valley,\r\nwith the Pecos Valley being somewhat ahead in total numbers.\r\n\r\nDucks commonly found in New Mexico in abundance are teal, both\r\ngreen-winged and blue-winged as well as the lesser-known cinnamon teal,\r\nmallards, widgeon, pintails, gadwall, scaups, canvasbacks, redheads, and\r\nother species.\r\n\r\nIn addition, New Mexico plays winter home to many thousands of the\r\nlesser sandhill crane which is confined to the river valleys and open\r\nplains of the eastern part of the state, particularly the southeastern\r\ncounties. A smaller population of the greater sandhill crane is found in\r\nthe Rio Grande Valley and near Columbus. Flocks of the small\r\nRichardson’s goose are found in the northeastern counties, in\r\nparticular, and along river courses throughout the state. The small snow\r\ngoose is likewise confined mostly to major river courses. The larger\r\nCanada geese are found particularly in the middle Rio Grande Valley\r\nwhere extensive development has been made by both state and federal\r\nagencies to encourage the use and the presence of bands of geese.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is unique in that it was the first state in many years to be\r\nable to open a hunting season on the lesser sandhill crane. This bird is\r\ncomparatively abundant, the total population probably being in excess of\r\n200,000, with the vast majority of these birds wintering in west Texas,\r\nNew Mexico, and Mexico. They occasionally cause heavy depredation to\r\ngrain crops in the southeastern part of the state, and hunting has been\r\npartly justified on the basis that the large wintering flocks might be\r\nbroken up and depredation spread over a larger area for less individual\r\neffect. These birds are tall, wild, and shy. They are hard to hunt, even\r\nmore so than geese, and although strenuous efforts have been made, not\r\ntoo many of them are bagged.\r\n\r\nOne should not overlook the tremendous opportunity for sport hunting of\r\nunprotected species, such as the various rabbits, the mountain lions and\r\nbobcats, and coyotes.\r\n\r\nThe wolf is now very rare in New Mexico. Only occasionally do wolves\r\ncome out of Mexico into the southwestern counties, usually in Hidalgo,\r\nLuna, and Doña Ana. Wolves are large, effective predators and are\r\nincompatible with the cattle-raising industry. Since they have a\r\nfondness for beef, the hand of the cattleman is raised against them.\r\n\r\nThe mountain lion prefers his natural prey of deer, mule deer being the\r\nprincipal victims. The bobcat preys on deer and on many of the small\r\nwild animals, rabbits in particular. These predators, when run and\r\nhunted with a pack of dogs, provide a fascinating sport which is growing\r\nin popularity.\r\n\r\nThe use of calls to attract animals to a “victim” has become widespread.\r\nThe calls imitate the distressed cry of rabbits and other creatures\r\nwhich to the predator means a meal close at hand. Everything from\r\nmountain lions to red-tailed hawks have been hunted by this procedure,\r\nand it can be very successful in bagging quarry. This type of hunting\r\nhas value in that it can be enjoyed at any time of the year throughout\r\nthe state and with a minimum of time and effort.\r\n\r\nHunting is a conservation practice that, wisely administered, results in\r\nwholesome out-of-door recreation and brings many tons of high protein\r\nfood of highest quality to the table. Nature nowhere in her economy\r\nlocks up a resource and throws away the key—we should be no less wise.\r\n\r\nLong gone are the buffalo which once roamed the High Plains of eastern\r\nNew Mexico. Exotic animals, imported and stocked along the rugged canyon\r\nof the Canadian River above Conchas Reservoir, are the Barbary sheep\r\nwith their magnificent coiled horns. Beavers dam some of the mountain\r\nstreams, badgers and skunks can be seen from the highways, and amid the\r\nforests are squirrels and porcupines, while high on rock slopes, the\r\nRocky Mountain woodchuck and the gray rock cony dash from ledge to\r\nledge. The white-tailed ptarmigan also haunts these high crags, and\r\nlower down the mountain, bluebirds nest. Hawks, eagles, magpies, jays,\r\nravens, orioles, wrens, sparrows, warblers, finches, and many other\r\nbirds of endless variety soar over canyon, forest, and sand-dune desert.\r\n\r\nMost notable of all is the crested roadrunner, the chapparal cock or\r\npaisano of Mexico and the state bird. In between racing with horsemen or\r\nautomobiles, the slender roadrunner cocks his head, strikes swiftly and\r\nvictoriously, then swallows his victim, which can be a small\r\nrattlesnake, whole.\r\n\r\nSnakes there are aplenty. Mostly, they are nonpoisonous, such as the\r\ngarter snake, glass snake, puff adder, ring-necked snake, the coachwhip,\r\nthe Mexican blacksnake, and the large western bullsnake. The small but\r\nvery venomous coral snake is rare, but common among rocks and near\r\nstreams are the large western diamondback rattlesnake, the prairie\r\nrattlers, and the less common green or blacktailed rattlesnake. Every\r\nsun-warmed rock has its scampering lizard, and nearby are horned toads,\r\ndry-land terrapins, tortoises, tarantulas, centipedes, vinegarroons,\r\nscorpions, and spiders. Of these latter desert animals, only the black\r\nwidow spider is poisonous.\r\n\r\nContrast in the influence of environments is shown by the animals that\r\ninhabit the “malpais,” the recent flows of black, rough-surfaced lava,\r\ncompared with similar animals found among the white gypsum dunes of\r\nWhite Sands. Black or darkly colored subspecies of mice, plains wood\r\nrats, kangaroo rats, and rock squirrels live on the black lava, whereas\r\nwhite or pale counterparts of these animals live among the white gypsum\r\ndunes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Sketch of roadrunner, New Mexico state bird]\r\n\r\nThe dwellers in the hills and plains of New Mexico are as varied as the\r\nhills and plains; they add their color and movement to the scenes of the\r\nLand of Enchantment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Rocks That Shape the Enchanting Landscape\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _by_ Frank E. Kottlowski\r\n\r\n“As old as the hills.” How much more ancient can anything be? Yet New\r\nMexico’s hills, its enchanting landscapes, were built in but the most\r\nrecent “minute” of geologic time. Merely one geologic era ago, marine\r\nwaters covered the state, and storm-tossed waves ruled where now the hot\r\nsun beats down on dry sands and cacti a mile above sea level.\r\n\r\nWhat determined the Land of Enchantment’s landscapes? Shaping these land\r\nforms are the rocks of the earth’s crust, the structure of those rocks,\r\nand the endless battle between the rocks and the atmosphere. A story\r\nspelled out in stone, the geologic history. The rocks determine.\r\n\r\nEons ago, it began; one billion, two billion, or perhaps even more\r\nbillions of years ago. A history whose beginnings have been lost owing\r\nto destruction of its earliest records. A history, written in the rocks,\r\nthat is divided into four general parts (fig. 1). The oldest rocks, more\r\nthan 600 m.y. (million years) old, almost devoid of traces of life, are\r\nthe Precambrian rocks. The Paleozoic rocks, 230 to 600 m.y. old, are\r\nmarked by ancient (_paleo_-) life. This was the Period of Invertebrates,\r\nanimals without backbones. Mesozoic rocks, 70 to 230 m.y. old, formed in\r\nthe Era of Dinosaurs and contain types of life that are intermediate\r\n(_meso_-) between the ancient and modern animals. And rocks of the\r\nCenozoic Era, 70 m.y. ago to the present, make up the latest (_ceno_-,\r\nrecent) chapter of the earth’s history.\r\n\r\nEvents of the Cenozoic Era have had the greatest influence on New\r\nMexico’s landscapes. So let us begin the story at the dawn of the\r\nCenozoic, and return to the earlier geologic chapters later.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\nThe mountains, the plains, the rivers, and the lakes all are transitory\r\nfeatures of the landscape, created during the recent part of the\r\nCenozoic Era, and all doomed to destruction in the near future,\r\ngeologically speaking. Even so, some of the plains and mountains may\r\npredate man’s evolution onto the earth scene.\r\n\r\nGone were the late Mesozoic seas; never again during our lifetime nor\r\nthe lifetime of many future generations will marine waters roll over New\r\nMexico, and sea-spawned creatures rule. For the first two thirds of the\r\nCenozoic, the Paleogene Period (25 to 70 m.y. ago), New Mexico suffered\r\nfrom the dying effects of the great Laramide upheaval of the earth’s\r\ncrust. Large areas were exposed to the harsh erosion of stream and wind.\r\nThe landscape looked as parts of southwestern New Mexico do today—tall\r\nrugged mountain ranges scattered in isolated patches amid wide gravelly\r\nplains. But the climate was more humid, and while no large through\r\nrivers are known, local great swamps and lakes lay on the plains in\r\ndebris-trapping lowlands.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1.

New Mexico during Paleogene time]\r\n\r\nScenery in north-central New Mexico (fig. 2) may have been similar to\r\ntoday’s, with mountains in the same general areas as the present-day\r\nSangre de Cristo, Nacimiento, San Juan, and Brazos ranges.\r\nCoarse-grained gravels were stacked up at the edges of the mountains,\r\nbut out in the adjoining lowlands, floodplain sands and varicolored\r\nlake-bed clays settled. Three low areas were “basins” of deposition\r\nwhere thick masses of sediments accumulated—the Raton and Poison Canyon\r\nformations in the Raton Basin near Raton, the Animas, Nacimiento, and\r\nSan Jose formations in the San Juan Basin north and northwest of Cuba,\r\nseen along N.M. Highway 44, with thinner deposits of the El Rito and\r\nBlanco Basin formations to the northeast of Cuba, and the Galisteo\r\nFormation in the Galisteo Basin south and southwest of Santa Fe.\r\nVolcanic rocks, the Espinaso beds, overlie the Galisteo but are not much\r\nyounger in age. Reddish rocks of the Galisteo Formation crop out along\r\nU.S. Highway 85 at La Bajada Hill about twenty miles southwest of Santa\r\nFe. The Sandia Mountains’ area appears to have been a lowland.\r\n\r\nSilicified wood, chiefly of pines but with some oak and poplar, is\r\nabundant in the Galisteo Formation. Large logs, up to 6 feet in diameter\r\nand 135 feet long, have been found. In the great swamps of the Raton\r\nBasin, where the climate was much like that of Georgia today, tall\r\nreeds, water lilies, fig trees, palm trees, magnolias, and sycamores\r\ngrew in profusion, and contributed to the thick coal beds now mined\r\nthere. The early ages of the Cenozoic saw the spectacular rise of the\r\nmammals to dominance over reptiles on land; numerous remains of the\r\nearly mammals are found in the Nacimiento and San Jose formations,\r\nincluding the famous Puerco and Torrejon faunas—as well as many clams,\r\nsnails, fish, turtles, crocodiles, snakes, and birds.\r\n\r\nSoutheastern New Mexico appears to have been relatively level with only\r\nlocal hills and vast regions of featureless, stagnant but high plains\r\nwhere erosion slowly ate downward, deposition was slight, and most of\r\nthe detritus was carried eastward far beyond the state’s borders. The\r\nredbeds of the Baca Formation were laid down on the north flank of low\r\nmountains that extended intermittently from somewhere near Quemado\r\ntoward Socorro. Some ancient hills near present-day Sierra Blanca shed\r\nrock fragments that accumulated near Capitan as the varicolored Cub\r\nMountain Formation. Deeply eroded uplands northwest of Elephant Butte\r\nReservoir supplied gravels and sands that mingled with andesitic\r\nvolcanic debris as the upper part of the McRae Formation in central\r\nSierra County. Many of the weathered greenish and purplish volcanic\r\nrocks in southwestern New Mexico were extruded at this time, and beneath\r\nthe surface these molten magmas (hot liquefied rocks) cut into older\r\nrocks. Vapors and hot solutions from the magmas are believed to have\r\nemplaced some of New Mexico’s vast ore deposits during this time.\r\n\r\nThe last phase of the Paleogene Period, about 25 to 40 m.y. ago, was an\r\nearth-shaking time in New Mexico—and the first explosion of an atomic\r\nbomb in 1945 on the Jornada del Muerto between Socorro and Carrizozo was\r\na relatively low-energy-yield event compared with the late Paleogene\r\nearth movements. Almost the entire southwestern quarter of the state\r\nliterally exploded, with volcanic eruptions on a grand scale. These lava\r\nflows, rock breccias, ashes, pumice, and associated intrusives (molten\r\nrocks that did not make it to the surface) form the Datil-Mogollon\r\nplateau—at least 100 miles in diameter—as part of the Datil Formation,\r\nwhich locally is miles thick, and made up the main mass of many other\r\nranges near the Mexican border. Sierra Blanca (12,003 feet altitude)\r\nnortheast of Alamogordo is a huge, isolated volcanic mass of late\r\nPaleogene age.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. East-west cross section of Rio Grande\r\n    graben near Santa Fe]\r\n\r\nThis widespread volcanic activity continued into the Neogene Period\r\nwhich began about 25 m.y. ago. Rhyolites, pumice, and perlite in the\r\nsouthwest, as well as in other parts of the state, covered wide areas.\r\nMount Taylor, towering up to 11,389 feet near Grants and visible on the\r\nwestern skyline from Albuquerque, is a Neogene volcanic pile, as are\r\nparts of the Sangre de Cristo range northeast of Taos. Shiprock and\r\nCabezon Peak, landmarks in northwestern New Mexico, are volcanic\r\nnecks—the eroded cores of ancient volcanoes.\r\n\r\nValle Grande caldera makes up the center of the Jemez Mountains west of\r\nLos Alamos and is a late Neogene volcanic mass with the central crater\r\nsixteen miles in diameter—one of the world’s largest calderas. Bandelier\r\nNational Monument headquarters is within a canyon carved from Valle\r\nGrande’s ashes. Volcanic ash scattered over the western parts of Texas,\r\nOklahoma, and Kansas was blown from this volcano. Capulin Mountain, east\r\nof Raton, is a huge recent cinder cone and is surrounded by numerous\r\nbasaltic lava flows that cap the High Plains from Raton eastward to\r\nClayton. The very fresh black basalt flows near Carrizozo and in the\r\nvalley of Rio San Jose near Grants are probably less than 1000 years\r\nold. Numerous mesas along the Rio Grande Valley from the Colorado line\r\nto El Paso are capped by black basalt flows of late Neogene age.\r\n\r\nMany of the present-day mountains were uplifted in early Neogene time,\r\nfollowing the climax of the great volcanic eruptions. This uplifting, in\r\nmany instances, took place along one side of huge mountain masses,\r\nforming tilted fault blocks like the Sandia, Manzano, San Andres, and\r\nSacramento mountains. Rock beds in the Sandia Mountains, for example,\r\ndip to the east, but were uplifted along a west-bounding fault zone—a\r\nhuge break in the earth’s crust—as much as four miles! This was an\r\nearth-shaking event! However, the uplifting took place slowly, and\r\nindeed is continuing today as the Albuquerque area, along with the Rio\r\nGrande Valley southward to Socorro, is one of the most active earthquake\r\nareas in the state.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with uplift, other blocks of the earth’s crust sank, forming\r\ngraben basins which were flooded with rock debris from the adjoining\r\nuplifts. A tremendous irregular graben, now followed by the Rio Grande,\r\ncut north-south across the state. Geologists label it the _Rio Grande\r\nstructural depression_ (fig. 3). Mountains on the east are the Sangre de\r\nCristo, Sandia, Manzano, Los Pinos, Fra Cristobal, and Caballo ranges;\r\nthose to the west include the Brazos, Jemez, Ladron, Socorro, Magdalena,\r\nand San Mateo mountains. Within this complex graben, and around the\r\nbordering ranges, the colorful sandstones and siltstones of the Santa Fe\r\nGroup were deposited—these red, yellow, orange, and cream rocks are\r\neroded in many places, such as near Santa Fe, to “badlands”\r\ncharacteristic of the landscapes along the Rio Grande Valley from\r\nEspanola southward to El Paso. Much brightly tinted silicified wood is\r\nfound in these beds, and literally freight-car loads of mammalian\r\nremains have been shipped to museums from outcrops near Espanola.\r\n\r\nIn the basins amid the mountains of southwestern New Mexico, similar\r\nsands and gravels of the Gila Conglomerate filled low areas. East of the\r\nmountains of central New Mexico that form a north-south chain of ranges\r\nfrom Raton to Carlsbad, thin gravels of the Ogallala Formation were\r\ndumped onto the western edges of the High Plains. They now cap the\r\nplains as well as make picturesque bluffs east of the Pecos River and\r\nsoutheast of Tucumcari—the “caprock” of that area. In northwestern New\r\nMexico, isolated mesas are topped by the Chuska and Bidahochi\r\nformations; similar sands, silts, and clays washed from adjoining\r\nhighlands.\r\n\r\nThe final episodes of landscape formation occurred during the\r\nPleistocene Epoch, the recent glacial period. Mountain valley glaciers\r\noccupied some of the higher parts of the state, as far southward as\r\nSierra Blanca; large lakes filled many of the closed basins, such as\r\nthose near Estancia and south of Lordsburg; the Carrizozo and Grants\r\nbasalt flows were extruded; the final tremendous explosions of Valle\r\nGrande spread volcanic ash over large regions; sands, gravels, and clays\r\nwere eroded and deposited by streams and in lakes; and sand dunes were\r\nheaped up in many areas. The glistening white gypsum dunes (fig. 4) of\r\nWhite Sands National Monument, built up into 50-foot-high mounds\r\nwindward of gypsiferous Lake Lucero, are spectacular products of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande, in its present valley, probably is only as old as\r\nmid-Pleistocene, born during late uplift of its headwater mountains, the\r\nSan Juan and Sangre de Cristo ranges in southern Colorado and northern\r\nNew Mexico—initiated by floods of meltwaters from waning mountain\r\nglaciers. Some of the lower terraces (benches) along the Rio Grande are\r\nvery young, being dated by radiocarbon methods at 2600 b.p. (before\r\npresent). Until shackled by Elephant Butte Dam in 1916, and smaller dams\r\nup and down the valley, the Rio Grande switched its course with every\r\nlarge springtime flood. Even with these man-made controls, the Rio\r\ncarves new channels during floods and covers flooded fields with silt as\r\nthe high waters recede.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECAMBRIAN ERA\r\n\r\nThe highest points in New Mexico are in the north-central region. Here,\r\nalong the backbone of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, tower Wheeler Peak\r\n(13,160 feet above sea level), northeast of Taos, and South Truchas Peak\r\n(13,102 feet), northeast of Santa Fe. Snow lingers on these lofty spires\r\nall year around except during an especially hot August. Highest\r\npeaks—they must be capped by the youngest rocks. But no, the quartzites\r\nand gneisses, hard rocks made up of quartz and feldspar, that hold up\r\nthese pinnacles against the attack of water and ice are among the oldest\r\nrocks known in the Southwest—perhaps as much as two billion years old.\r\nThese Precambrian rocks lay deep beneath the earth’s surface from early\r\nPaleozoic time (500 m.y. ago?) until early Neogene time, then were\r\nuplifted along great breaks in the earth’s crust, uplifted slowly and\r\nintermittently during the span of time from about 20 m.y. ago to perhaps\r\n1 m.y. ago.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. Gypsum dunes of White Sands]\r\n\r\nHow did these ancient rocks form? What did New Mexico look like during\r\nthe dawn of geologic history? The record in stone is fragmentary. But\r\nabout two billion or so years back, thick masses of quartz sandstone\r\nwere laid down in north-central New Mexico, as well as vast lenses of\r\nmud, and some beds of feldspar-rich sandstone. Volcanic activity was\r\nintense; huge flows of rhyolite and andesite were poured out over most\r\nof the state, and these in turn, along with the muddy and sandy\r\nsediments, were intruded by enormous masses of hot granite. Mile-high\r\nmountains were formed, and during the stretch of this early geologic\r\ntime, called the Precambrian Era, the high peaks were eroded by rain,\r\nwind, and sun until some were worn down to featureless plains sloping\r\ntoward the ancient ancestral oceans.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5. Staurolite twin crystals in mica schist]\r\n\r\nThese Precambrian rocks now make up the cores of such mountain ranges as\r\nthe Sandias east of Albuquerque, the Sangre de Cristo range near Santa\r\nFe, the Pedernal Hills south of Clines Corners, the Burro Mountains\r\nsouthwest of Silver City, the Brazos Range east of Tierra Amarilla, the\r\nZuni Mountains southwest of Grants, and the San Andres Mountains west of\r\nWhite Sands. As seen in Tijeras Canyon east of Albuquerque, the bulk of\r\nthe ancient rocks are gray to pinkish granite and granite gneiss,\r\nspeckled by crystals of biotite, microcline, orthoclase, and quartz.\r\nQuartzites (hardened sandstones), greenstone, and foliated mica schists\r\n(fig. 5) are the older rocks that were intruded by granitic magmas about\r\n1350 million years ago—as indicated by dating of radioactive isotopes,\r\nK-Ar and Rb-Sr. Locally, pegmatite dikes, a late-cooling, large-crystal\r\nstage of the granites, crisscross the granite and contain excellent\r\ncrystals of quartz, feldspar, and mica, as well as less common minerals.\r\nThe famous Harding pegmatite near Dixon, about forty miles north of\r\nSanta Fe, contains beryl, columbite-tantalite, lepidolite mica,\r\nspodumene, and other rare minerals. Some of these crystals are ten feet\r\nin length!\r\n\r\n\r\nPALEOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\nThere are some primitive types of plant and animal life known from\r\nPrecambrian rocks outside of New Mexico but the earliest beds that\r\ncontain abundant fossils are those of Cambrian age, 500 to 600 m.y. old.\r\nCambrian rocks in New Mexico are in the Bliss Sandstone, a reddish brown\r\niron-rich bed, 50 to 200 feet thick, that occurs only in the southern\r\npart of the state. There it can be seen, for example, along the bold\r\neast-facing escarpment of the San Andres Mountains or the west-facing\r\ncliffs of the Caballo Mountains, as a dark band resting on the pinkish\r\nPrecambrian granitic rocks. It is a shallow-sea sand, deposited on the\r\nnortheastern edge of the Cambrian seas. Scattered amid the brown-stained\r\nquartz, red hematite, and green glauconite are broken shells of\r\ntrilobites and primitive brachiopods. Northern New Mexico was a low,\r\nbroad island during Cambrian time, a source of some of the sands in the\r\nBliss Sandstone.\r\n\r\nDuring the Ordovician Period, 425 to 500 m.y. ago, upper sands of the\r\nBliss as well as overlying limestones and dolomites were deposited in\r\nthe shallow warm seas of southern New Mexico; these latter rocks are the\r\nEl Paso Limestone and Montoya Dolomite. The Ordovician seas teemed with\r\ninvertebrate life. Fifteen-foot-long cephalopods, as much as a foot in\r\ndiameter, ruled the shallow salt-water bottoms, munching on the abundant\r\ntrilobites and the moss animals, the bryozoans. Numerous brachiopods,\r\ncorals, snails, and clams also thrived, with many of the Ordovician\r\ncarbonate-rock beds literally being made up of these fossil remains.\r\nNear El Paso, these limy fossiliferous beds are nearly 2000 feet thick,\r\nbut they thin northward to a knife edge in thickness near Mockingbird\r\nGap at the north end of the San Andres Mountains. Parts of northwestern\r\nNew Mexico may have been low islands exposed to the sun and erosion\r\nduring Ordovician time, but most of the state was probably within an\r\nextensive shallow ocean. Later, erosion removed the Ordovician rocks\r\nfrom central and northern New Mexico.\r\n\r\nSilurian strata, the brown Fusselman Dolomite, deposited during the\r\nmiddle of that period (400 to 425 m.y. ago), remain only in the southern\r\nand southeastern parts of the state, thinning out northward from the\r\n1000-foot-thick bed near El Paso. The extent of these middle Silurian\r\nseas is not known, but most of central and northern New Mexico was\r\nundergoing erosion during late Silurian time. The northward thinning of\r\nthe Fusselman Dolomite is due chiefly to this erosion, evidenced by the\r\nknobby, ridged and channeled top surface of the Fusselman. Brachiopods\r\nand corals are the most abundant fossils in the Fusselman Dolomite;\r\nelsewhere, Silurian rocks are known for the sea scorpions or\r\neurypterids, which attained a length of nine feet, and for the complete\r\nremains of primitive fishes.\r\n\r\nDuring early and middle Devonian time (345 to 400 m.y. ago), most of New\r\nMexico was a lowland rotting beneath the sun. Fossiliferous Devonian\r\nrocks are unknown in the north-central part of the state but occur\r\nbeneath the surface in the Four Corners region of northwestern New\r\nMexico and the adjoining states. These rocks are of late Devonian age\r\nand consist of lower dolomite and sandstone, middle shale and dolomite,\r\nand the upper Ouray Limestone.\r\n\r\nIn southern New Mexico, a uniform blanket of dark limy muds, called the\r\nPercha Shale, was deposited during late Devonian time. This shale marks\r\na great change from the limestones of earlier ages. In part, it is of\r\nblack muds deposited in widespread or in local stagnant basins and in\r\npart calcareous fossiliferous muds in which abundant invertebrate life\r\nwas buried. The clay and quartz silt that make up the rocks were a\r\nweathered residuum that had accumulated, during the long period of late\r\nSilurian and early and middle Devonian times, on the lowland of central\r\nand northern New Mexico.\r\n\r\nExcept in the stagnant basins, invertebrate life was prolific,\r\nbrachiopods, bryozoans, and corals being especially numerous. Fossil\r\nfish remnants, chiefly teeth, are abundant in some of the sandy units,\r\nand outside of New Mexico the earliest amphibians occur in upper\r\nDevonian rocks. The oldest definitely known assemblage of land plants\r\noccurs in the Devonian, and forests containing forty-foot-high trees\r\nspread over the uplands. Such tree ferns, horsetail rushes, and lycopods\r\n(spiked-leafed trees) may have grown in profusion on the swampy lowlands\r\nnear Albuquerque’s and Santa Fe’s present sites, far north of the muddy\r\nDevonian seas of southern New Mexico.\r\n\r\n                       Figure 6. Fossil specimens\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Brachiopod\r\n    _Marginifera._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Crinoid\r\n    stem fragment.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Crinoid\r\n    restoration of a crinoid.]\r\n\r\nMississippian rocks (310 to 345 m.y. old) probably were deposited over\r\nmost of New Mexico. Subsequent erosion removed much of the Mississippian\r\nbeds in northern New Mexico. The remnants, less than 100 feet thick in\r\nmost places, are of lower sandy and shaly beds overlain by massive\r\ncrinoidal limestones, the Arroyo Penasco Formation of the Nacimiento and\r\nSandia mountains and the Tererro Formation of the Sangre de Cristo range\r\neast of Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nIn southern New Mexico, the Mississippian beds are thick and widespread,\r\nbeing more than 1000 feet in thickness in the southwestern panhandle.\r\nThere the rock units are the Escabrosa Limestone of the southwest or the\r\nLake Valley Limestone of the south-central part of the state. These are\r\nmassive fossiliferous limestones precipitated in shallow extensive seas\r\nabounding with invertebrate life. Huge gardens of the sea lilies,\r\ncrinoids, spread over the area, their remains mingled with those of lacy\r\nmoss animals, the bryozoans, and with brachiopods and corals. Locally,\r\nas in the region of the Sacramento and San Andres mountains and Black\r\nRange, moundlike fossil reefs, called bioherms, were built. Some of\r\nthese bioherms in the Sacramento Mountains are mounds of fossiliferous\r\nlimestones 350 feet high and several thousand feet in diameter. Beds on\r\ntheir flanks dip as much as 35 degrees and are made up of broken “fossil\r\nhash” calcite sands. One can stand at the base of these huge limestone\r\nhills and almost hear the ancient waves breaking against the reef and\r\nsee the dying struggle of the brachiopod (fig. 6) that left his shell in\r\nthe reef-flank sands.\r\n\r\nTo the south, beginning near the present site of White Sands, dark\r\ncherty limestones were laid down in stagnant waters, to become the\r\nRancheria Limestone. This black to reddish brown siliceous limestone is\r\nmore than 300 feet thick near El Paso. There its thin beds break down\r\ninto slabs that resemble a jumbled woodpile.\r\n\r\nNorthern New Mexico was above sea level during late Mississippian time;\r\nin some areas caves developed in the porous limestones, and in other\r\nplaces the limestones were eroded to a residuum of chert and red clay.\r\nThe land must have looked like the karst areas of Indiana, Kentucky, and\r\nIllinois today—with lost rivers flowing into sink holes, numerous caves,\r\nand many underground rivers. Only the southernmost part of the state was\r\nawash in the late Mississippian seas, and in these salt waters, rocks of\r\nthe Helms and Paradise formations settled. They are typical nearshore\r\nbeds of yellowish limy sandstone, green limy shales, and brown sandy\r\noolitic limestones. Plant fossils occur intermingled with marine animal\r\nremains; the plant fragments were washed into the shallow seas from the\r\nland areas of the central and northern parts of the state.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian Period (280 to 310 m.y. ago) was a time of change.\r\nPreviously, northern New Mexico had been an emergent lowland or barely\r\nawash in shallow waters, while to the south shallow but extensive seas\r\nheld sway, the spawning ground of the vertebrates and invertebrates that\r\nevolved between 310 and 600 m.y. B.C. But mountains were built during\r\nthe Pennsylvanian, and the whole pattern of land and sea was altered.\r\nThe sun rose on north-south aligned ranges interspersed with\r\nnorth-south-trending seas (fig. 7). Somewhere north of Albuquerque a\r\nmighty range of mountains, the Uncompahgre Range, arose to shed rock\r\ndebris into adjoining ocean basins. To the southeast, a lower but\r\nprominent range, the Pedernal Mountains, stretched from the present-day\r\nPedernal Hills southward to somewhere near Ruidoso and Piñon. Rocks\r\neroded from this landmass were dumped westward into the Orogrande basin\r\nwhich occupied the region near the present-day White Sands; there as\r\nmuch as 3000 feet of beds accumulated—impure sandstones, dark shales,\r\nfragmental limestones, and even some gypsum during the end phase of\r\nPennsylvanian sedimentation.\r\n\r\nRocks filled the Delaware basin in southeastern New Mexico—limestones,\r\nsandstones, and black shales that now produce oil and gas. In\r\nnorthwestern New Mexico west of Grants and mostly west of the Zuni\r\nMountains, a low land area, the Zuni Islands, was the source of eroded\r\nresiduum released into an ocean channelway that ran north-northwest\r\nthrough central New Mexico from El Paso to Farmington. And in the\r\nnortheast, granite hills of the Sierra Grande Arch stood above the\r\nshallow Pennsylvanian seas.\r\n\r\nIn the Four Corners region, broken rock from the Uncompahgre Range was\r\nrushed westward into the Pennsylvanian-age Paradox Basin. Amid the\r\nclastic limestones, black shale, gypsum, and salt of this basin are\r\noil-bearing lenses. Today, oil wells pump this black “gold” from the\r\nancient rocks—wells almost in the shadow of Shiprock’s famous spire.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian Period was a time of coal making on the greatest scale\r\nin the earth’s history. Extensive swamps and marshes, the habitat of\r\npeat and ultimately coal, were almost lacking in New Mexico. Thus, only\r\nthin scattered lenses of coal occur in the Pennsylvanian beds of the\r\nstate. The lands of this period were covered by tree ferns, scale trees,\r\nhorsetail rushes, and primitive conifers. In the shallow seas, the\r\ndominant invertebrates were fusulinids (fig. 8), small-shelled\r\nprotozoans shaped like grains of wheat. Abundant cockroaches, large\r\ndragonflies, and spiders swarmed over the land.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7. New Mexico during Pennsylvanian time]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Permian Rocks\r\n\r\nThe Permian Period (230 to 280 m.y. ago) dawned with renewed rising of\r\nthe highlands in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Floods of\r\nred sand and clay, washed from the rotting hills, wiped out the seas of\r\nnorthern and central New Mexico, and intertongued southward with marine\r\nlimestones. These early Permian rocks are the Hueco Limestone near El\r\nPaso, there 2200 feet thick, the Abo Redbeds near Albuquerque, and the\r\nupper Sangre de Cristo Redbeds southeast of Santa Fe. Wherever the\r\nredbeds crop out, their dark reddish brown hue, speckled and striped\r\nwith spots and streaks of green, enlivens the drab gray-and-brown\r\nlandscape. Some of the reddish coloring is from angular grains of red to\r\norange feldspar, but most is in thin brilliantly tinted skins of\r\nhematite that coat the sand grains and saturate the clays. In northern\r\nand central New Mexico, amphibians and other primitive vertebrate\r\nanimals lived amid the red soils and sands; their bones and imprints\r\nhave been preserved on thin flat slabs of sandstone that now decorate\r\nsidewalks and patios.\r\n\r\n                       Figure 8. Fossil specimens\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bryozoan\r\n    _Fenestrellina._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fusulinid\r\n    _Fusulina._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Coral\r\n    _Lophophyllidium._]\r\n\r\nThe early Permian seashore, where limy muds beyond the surf intermingled\r\nwith red sandy muds swept from the north, vacillated somewhere north of\r\nAlamogordo with each sea-level change. Amid the breakers, and as\r\nsubmarine banks in the shallow waters, reefs grew—moundlike masses of\r\nshell debris and calcite mud trapped among frondlike calcareous algae.\r\nNear Tularosa, these algal “bioherms” are sixty feet high and extend\r\nwithin broad belts half a mile wide. In southeastern New Mexico, these\r\nburied “Abo” reefs have yielded much oil.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of Permian time, the southern Colorado mountains had been\r\nworn down to low hills that lay north of an extensive sea covering most\r\nof New Mexico. From Santa Fe south to White Sands and southeastward\r\nalmost to Carlsbad, very shallow marine waters were alternately stifled\r\nby pale-red sandy muds or evaporated by the sun. The results were\r\nalternating beds of pale-red sandstone, gypsum, and silty dolomitic\r\nlimestone, called the Yeso Formation. Locally, as near Carrizozo, thick\r\ndeposits of rock salt also were precipitated, and the Yeso there is\r\nabout 4000 feet thick. At this time, the Delaware basin of southeastern\r\nNew Mexico saw the beginning of its most spectacular events, the\r\nbuilding of the Capitan and Goat Seep reefs. This basin—a huge oval\r\nsouth of Carlsbad and east of Carlsbad Caverns—had been “deep” sea\r\nduring most of Pennsylvanian time, but it was a more distinct geographic\r\nfeature during the Permian. While the pale-red sands, gypsum, halite,\r\nand dolomitic limestones of the Yeso Formation were laid down to the\r\nnorth and northwest, the Delaware basin was rimmed by a low, broad bank\r\nof fossil-hash calcite sand, now called the Victorio Peak Limestone. In\r\nthe basin, in deep stagnant waters, black sandy limestone and black\r\nshale of the Bone Spring Formation were deposited.\r\n\r\nA sheet of white quartz sand filled the late Yeso seas; the resulting\r\nGlorieta Sandstone, about 200 feet thick, prominently caps Glorieta\r\nMesa. Its cliffs are a familiar sight to travelers on the Santa Fe\r\nRailway at Glorieta Pass. The Coconino Sandstone in the Grand Canyon\r\narea of Arizona is the western part of the Glorieta. This “clean”\r\nsand—lacking intermixed mud—marks the continued lowering of the southern\r\nColorado uplands. Broad seas then spread over all but northern New\r\nMexico and a thick (600 to 1000 feet) persistent marine unit, the San\r\nAndres Limestone, was laid down. Much oil is produced in southeastern\r\nNew Mexico from this dark-gray unit of limestones and dolomites. The\r\nrich agricultural region stretching from Roswell to Artesia depends on\r\nunderground water gained from the San Andres Limestone, water that falls\r\nas rain and snow on the Sacramento Mountains, seeps underground into the\r\ncracks and caverns within the San Andres, and flows eastward downslope\r\nto the Pecos Valley.\r\n\r\nThe delicate balance between land and sea swung upward at the end of San\r\nAndres time as these late Permian seas retreated to southern New Mexico.\r\nThe deep Delaware basin was the only persistent marine body of water. It\r\nwas rimmed by magnificent towering barrier reefs, the Goat Seep and\r\nCapitan reefs that now are host to Carlsbad Caverns. These reefs were\r\nsimilar to the present-day Great Barrier Reef of Australia, except that\r\nthe Capitan and Goat Seep reefs surrounded an inland sea whereas the\r\nAustralian reef borders a continent. The Capitan reef is about 400 miles\r\nlong, and other than oceanward channels cut through to the south,\r\ncompletely encircled the 10,000-square-mile Delaware basin. At its\r\nheyday, the Capitan reef was barely awash, and teeming with life, in\r\ncontrast to the silent, stagnant deeps of the Delaware basin which were\r\nabout 2000 feet below sea level only a few miles away from the barrier\r\nreef. On the steep slope into the basin, huge slump blocks of\r\nfossiliferous reef limestone slid, mingling with fossil-hash sand. These\r\n“flank” beds dip steeply from the massive reef core to interfinger with\r\nthe black sandy limestones of the basin.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware basin was a marine feature throughout Late Paleozoic time;\r\nits northwestern border is now marked by the southeast-trending front of\r\nthe Guadalupe Mountains southeast of Carlsbad; its north edge was\r\neast-northeast of Carlsbad, and it extended southward into West Texas.\r\n\r\nShallow “shelf” seas reached irregularly and intermittently northward\r\nand northwestward from the Capitan reef and mingled with low islands\r\nthroughout all but southeastern New Mexico. Landward, away from the\r\nDelaware basin, the rocks change from massive, thick, light-gray\r\nlimestones of the reefs into thin units of thin-bedded dolomite, then\r\nabruptly into alternating beds of gypsum and redbeds, the Artesia Group\r\nof rocks, and finally, marking the distant shorelines, into thin units\r\nof red mudstone and red sandstone, the Bernal Formation. Evaporation of\r\nsea water was excessive, and average temperatures high; the climate\r\nvaried from semiarid in northwestern New Mexico to subtropical in the\r\nDelaware basin area—a contrast and a similarity to today’s climate.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9. Castile gypsum sample]\r\n\r\nLatest Permian time saw the dramatic end of the Paleozoic Era. Most of\r\nNew Mexico was uplifted above sea level, with only the Delaware basin\r\nremaining as a land-locked sea, much like the Caspian Sea today, but\r\nwith channels open periodically southward to the ocean. The rocks of\r\nthis waning part of the Permian are called the _Ochoan Series_; they\r\nshow an abrupt and striking change from the underlying Carlsbad reef\r\nlimestones and associated black basin-filling limestones up into the\r\nlaminated gypsum-anhydrite of the basal Ochoan rocks, the Castile\r\nformation. Normal marine conditions ended almost instantaneously. Excess\r\nof evaporation lowered the water level of the inland sea; the\r\naccumulated brine (concentrated salty sea water) killed the life on and\r\nnear the Capitan reef, and thick beds of anhydrite were precipitated.\r\nThe lowest beds of the Ochoan Series, the Castile Anhydrite, and the\r\noverlying Salado Salt, mostly filled the deep depression that was the\r\nDelaware basin; the upper beds, the Rustler Dolomite and Dewey Lake\r\nRedbeds, lap over the edges of the basin and in places rest irregularly\r\nupon the Capitan limestone.\r\n\r\nThese are unusual rocks. The Castile (about 1800 feet thick) is thinly\r\nbanded, with thicker bands (laminae, thin layers) of light-gray\r\ngypsum-anhydrite alternating with thin laminae of dark-brown calcite\r\n(fig. 9). This lamination is believed due to annual changes, the brown\r\ncalcite being precipitated during the summer and the gray anhydrite\r\nduring the winter. On the surface, the calcium sulfate mineral is\r\ngypsum, but at depths of about 600 feet, these laminae are anhydrite.\r\nAddition of water to anhydrite has changed it to gypsum wherever ground\r\nwater penetrated the laminae.\r\n\r\nThe Salado Salt, about 2000 feet thick, is almost entirely of rock salt\r\n(halite), with important interbeds of potassium-rich minerals—red\r\nsylvite, gray langbeinite, brownish bitter-tasting carnallite, and\r\npale-red polyhalite. As all these salts are highly soluble in water, the\r\nSalado Salt nowhere “crops out” at the surface. East of Carlsbad,\r\nhowever, the potash-rich beds are mined underground, and supply about\r\nninety per cent of the United States’ production—used chiefly as\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe arid period of Salado Salt evaporation changed slightly as the\r\ndolomites and anhydrites of the Rustler Dolomite were laid down in the\r\nlast drying moments (geologically speaking) of the Permian. Then as the\r\nseas retreated to the south, the fine-grained red sands and silts of the\r\nDewey Lake Redbeds were spread as a thin blanket over the low lands\r\nbasking under the hot Permian sun. This was a time of dying; whole races\r\nof vertebrate and invertebrate animals were wiped out, to be known today\r\nonly from their fossil remains. As the dim unmarked episode of latest\r\nPermian time merged into the Triassic, an inkling of coming life was\r\nrecorded in the rocks. The amphibians were more modern types, and they\r\ngave rise to the most striking of early land animals, the reptiles. This\r\nwas the beginning of the conquest of the land by the reptiles, which\r\nculminated later in the dinosaurs, and was aided by the retreat of\r\nshallow seas from the continents, a change survived chiefly by the\r\nspecies adapted to living on land.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic Era dawned in New Mexico on extensive plains, except for a\r\nnorthwest-trending range in the extreme north-central part of the state.\r\nDuring this, the early part of the Triassic Period (180 to 230 m.y.\r\nago), sands and muds eroded from New Mexico were carried westward to\r\nnortheastern Arizona where they now form the Moenkopi Formation, the\r\nbrilliant reds and purples of the Painted Desert region. Uplands arose\r\nin late Triassic time in southwestern New Mexico. Along with mountains\r\nin south-central Colorado, these highlands were torn apart by water and\r\nwind, and the detritus was swept into sheets of brightly colored sand\r\nand shale. These beds are thickest (about 2000 feet) along the New\r\nMexico—Texas line east of Roswell and in west-central New Mexico (near\r\nGrants) extending westward into northeastern Arizona. The eastern\r\nTriassic rocks are the redbeds of the Dockum Group with the lower Santa\r\nRosa Sandstone and the upper Chinle beds. The northwestern rocks are the\r\nChinle Formation overlain by the redbeds of the Wingate Sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe Chinle Formation is of special scenic interest as its beds contain\r\nthe silicified trees so well shown at Petrified Forest National\r\nMonument. These varicolored rocks—red, purple, green, and gray—also\r\ndecorate the Painted Desert area, the wide valley of Rio San Jose east\r\nof Laguna, and flank Interstate 40 (U.S. Highway 66) from the Texas line\r\nwestward almost to Clines Corners. As some beds are weathered “ash”\r\nbeds, the highlands were sites of volcanoes that spread their dust over\r\nmuch of the Southwest. In contrast to the underlying marine Paleozoic\r\nrocks, these Triassic beds were deposited on land by streams and in\r\nshallow lakes. Thus the beasts that roamed New Mexico were\r\namphibians—such as the thick-skulled stegocephalians—and reptiles of the\r\ncrocodilelike clan, the phytosaurs. The silicified trees in the Chinle\r\nare mostly primitive pines; some grew to heights of more than 100 feet\r\nand measure 7 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico was featureless rolling prairie, with scattered low hills in\r\nthe northwest, during most of Jurassic time (135 to 180 m.y. ago). In\r\nthe late part of the period, the Sundance-Curtis sea and its shoreline\r\nlagoons spread down from the north into northwestern New Mexico. Sand\r\ndunes on its southeastern shores consolidated into the cross-bedded\r\nEntrada Sandstone; its reddish brown cliffs rim the Rio San Jose Valley\r\nnear Grants and Gallup. In an extensive lagoon, or salt-water lake that\r\ncovered most of northwestern and north-central New Mexico, the gypsum\r\nand limestone of the Todilto Formation were precipitated; this gypsum is\r\nthe bed mined near Rosario siding (seen between Albuquerque and Santa\r\nFe) by the Kaiser Gypsum Company, and near San Ysidro on White Mesa by\r\nthe American Gypsum Company. The Todilto salty basin was overwhelmed by\r\nreddish sands and silts of the Summerville Formation, washed chiefly\r\nfrom the south, and by the multicolored sands of the Zuni Sandstone\r\n(exposed at El Morro), and then the stream and wind-blown sands and\r\nclays of the varicolored Morrison Formation were laid down in northern\r\nNew Mexico. Petrified wood and bone fragments are abundant in the\r\nMorrison beds—along with uranium—but no fossil finds in New Mexico equal\r\nthose in the Morrison Formation of Dinosaur National Park, Utah.\r\n\r\nMuch of North America, including southern New Mexico, was land during\r\nthe Jurassic. In the streams and lakes were many kinds of fishes,\r\namphibians, reptiles, snails, crustaceans, and water bugs; on dry land\r\nwere hordes of reptiles, small primitive mammals, and ants; in the air\r\nwere flying reptiles, the earliest known birds, moths, and butterflies.\r\nThe earth was ruled by the reptiles, with the dinosaurs dominant—some\r\nbeing the most ponderous land animals of all earth history. Such were\r\nStegosaurus and Brachiosaurus, the latter 85 feet long and weighing 50\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous Period (70 to 135 m.y. ago) was one of great contrast in\r\nNew Mexico. During Early Cretaceous time, most of the central and\r\nnorthern parts of the state were low lands torn by erosion, while thick\r\npiles of conglomerate, sandstone, and shale accumulated in depressions\r\nin the southwestern corner. Huge volcanoes near Lordsburg added their\r\nhot ashes, bombs, and flows to the sedimentary detritus, and thick\r\nfossiliferous limestones were laid down in muddy and sandy waters of the\r\nsea—the shoreline fluctuated over tens of miles in areas south of\r\nLordsburg, Deming, and El Paso. These Early Cretaceous beds total 20,000\r\nfeet in thickness in some areas. In eastern and northeastern New Mexico,\r\nin contrast, thin sheets of quartz sand were deposited by streams on the\r\nedge of a shallow sea, and black muds in local lagoons.\r\n\r\nRock beds thousands of feet thick were laid down in northern and central\r\nNew Mexico during Late Cretaceous time, whereas most of the southern\r\npart of the state was above sea level and was being eroded by tireless\r\nwinds and streams. The shorelines made parallel northwest-trending bands\r\nacross the state. These are now marked by beach sands, some of which are\r\nspeckled by black minerals, high in rare elements titanium, niobium, and\r\nzirconium. Northwestern and central New Mexico was a battleground of the\r\nland and sea, with the beaches advancing and retreating fifty or a\r\nhundred miles during an instant of geologic time. Stream sands and coal\r\nbeds lie landward from the beach sands which, in turn, mingle seaward\r\nwith black limy shales that were flushed into the seas. The lowest of\r\nthese rocks is the Dakota Sandstone—famous as an artesian aquifer in the\r\nHigh Plains areas of states to the northeast—Colorado, the Dakotas,\r\nNebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, and Montana. Above is the black Mancos Shale,\r\nwhich in turn is overlain by the Mesaverde Group.\r\n\r\nThe transitions from coal swamps and stream sands to beach deposits and\r\nthen into marine black shales is characteristic of the Mesaverde in\r\nnorthwestern and north-central New Mexico. To the northeast, beds of the\r\nsame age were laid down in an extensive muddy sea that stretched far to\r\nthe east; the Pierre Shale and Niobrara chalky limestone that underlie\r\nthe plains northeast of Las Vegas are typical. The cliff-forming\r\nsandstones and coal beds near Gallup are part of the Mesaverde Group and\r\nrim the entire San Juan Basin. Above are similar rocks such as the\r\nKirtland Shale, Pictured Cliffs Sandstone, and Fruitland Formation that\r\nunderlie valleys cut in the shales and cliffs carved from the sandstones\r\nin the northwest corner of New Mexico near Farmington.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the Cretaceous, the Laramide “revolution” began, and\r\nNew Mexico along with most of North America emerged from beneath the\r\nseas, to be high and dry to the present. The revolution, an extensive\r\nupheaval of the earth’s crust, saw uplift of the San Juan Mountains area\r\nin southwestern Colorado and large volcanoes spouting fire and ashes\r\nnearby. Fragments of the eroded mountains and debris from these\r\nandesitic volcanoes were flushed southward by streams and steam to\r\nsettle as thick piles of mud, sandstone, and conglomerate, the McDermott\r\nand Animas formations in the San Juan Basin. The last moment of\r\nCretaceous time, if we could be so precise, was ushered out almost\r\nunnoticed—with mountains rising to the north and the andesitic-quartz\r\ndetritus being laid down to the south in the upper beds of the Animas\r\nFormation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, mountains arose during Late Cretaceous time in north-central\r\nNew Mexico and south-central Colorado, about on the site of the\r\npresent-day Sangre de Cristo range northeast of Taos, and shed erosional\r\ngravels and muds into the Raton Basin area. Alluvial fan gravels and\r\nsands grade eastward into dark muds and coals laid down in swamps and on\r\nfloodplains. These rocks now cap the rugged mesas seen northwest of the\r\nSanta Fe Railway from Raton southward—the cliff-forming Trinidad\r\nSandstone and the dark siltstones, sandstones, black shales, and coal\r\nbeds of the Vermejo and Raton formations. The Kaiser Steel Corporation\r\nmine near Koehler extracts coal from these beds. Again, the exact end of\r\nthe Cretaceous is marked only by some obscure boundary between beds, in\r\nthat area within the Raton Formation.\r\n\r\nDuring the Cretaceous Period, the deciduous trees—such as the oak,\r\nmaple, poplar, and elm that dominate today’s flora—became common. The\r\ncovered-seed plants, the angiosperms, are the most notable of the\r\nCretaceous plants, but the development of the modern floras was an\r\nantecedent to the great expansion of mammals and birds during the\r\nfollowing Cenozoic Era. Reptiles ruled the earth, led by the dinosaurs\r\n(fig. 10) and their distinctive group, the horned large-skulled\r\nceratopsians such as Triceratops. The small, hairy, warm-blooded mammals\r\nwere still insignificant creatures that ran from their huge dinosaur\r\nlords, but they ate reptile eggs, and so excelled the sluggish reptiles\r\nin mental and physical activity that they adapted swiftly to the\r\nchanging environments of the Laramide revolution—and became dominant as\r\nthe pea-brained reptiles were unable to stand the changes.\r\n\r\nThe shallow seas of the Cretaceous swarmed with invertebrate life;\r\nforaminifers (unicellular protozoans) in uncountable billions make up\r\nlarge parts of the chalky limestones. Mollusks, particularly clams like\r\noysters and the heavy ribbed Inoceramus, and complexly sutured\r\ncephalopods, the ammonites, as well as the internal-shelled belemnoids\r\n(that look like cigars), were most numerous among larger marine animals.\r\nReef builders in southwestern New Mexico were the peculiarly corallike\r\nclams, the rudistids. Widespread warm humid climates seem to have\r\nprevailed throughout the state during most of the Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSCAPES AND MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThus as the Cretaceous seas withdrew from New Mexico, the Cenozoic Era\r\ndawned, and never again have marine waters shaped the landscapes. The\r\nrocks, Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and their ancient\r\nmovements determine New Mexico’s spectacular landscapes. They tell tales\r\nof the endless war between erosion and hard rock, show the deposition of\r\nsediments, their uplift, and their eventual destruction. The result is\r\nstriking scenery—volcanic mountains, as Mount Taylor, Sierra Blanca,\r\nValle Grande—fresh lava flows near Carrizozo and Grants—volcanic necks\r\nlike Shiprock and Cabezon—White Sands, the work of the wind—El Morro,\r\nEnchanted Mesa, Acoma, and badlands near Santa Fe, the result of\r\nweathering and erosion—great fault-line escarpments of the Sandia,\r\nManzano, San Andres, and Sacramento mountains—the work of underground\r\nwaters at Carlsbad Caverns. And man adds his erosive powers—the huge\r\nopen-pit copper mine at Santa Rita and countless excavations for rock to\r\nbuild homes, to straighten highways.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10. Make way for ’is lordship, the Dinosaur!]\r\n\r\nThe sun can be harsh and hot, the rain sparse, the winter nights fierce\r\ncold. But within the rocks are natural resources undreamed of by the\r\nearly Indians, almost untouched by the Spanish, and with potential\r\nbeyond vision for the future. Water, being scarce, is one of the more\r\nimportant resources. With an average yearly precipitation of only\r\nfifteen inches, and more than half of the state receiving less than that\r\naverage, water is a problem! Farming must depend upon irrigation, the\r\nwater being drawn from streams or “mined” from underground “pools” where\r\nit had been accumulating for centuries.\r\n\r\nForests, game, and fish are lucrative resources somewhat unexpected in a\r\nsemiarid state; sheep and cattle—in this the stronghold of the cowboy,\r\nfamous in gunfighter lore—each total more than a million. New Mexico’s\r\n1965 mineral production, valued at $781.9 million, ranked seventh among\r\nthe states. Principal commodities won from the rocks, in order of value,\r\nwere oil, potash, natural gas, uranium, copper, sand and gravel, zinc,\r\ncoal, crushed stone, and perlite. Sizeable quantities of barite, beryl,\r\ncarbon dioxide, cement, clays, gem stones, gold, gypsum, helium, iron\r\nore, lead, limestone, magnesium compounds, manganese, mica, molybdenum,\r\npumice, salt, silver, sulfur, and vanadium were also mined. The huge\r\nopen-pit copper mine at Santa Rita, the many uranium mines near Grants,\r\nthe underground potash mines near Carlsbad, and the thousands of oil and\r\ngas wells in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the state are\r\ntypical of man-made landscape features attributable to mineral\r\nexploitation in New Mexico. Numerous old mine dumps, rotting mine\r\nshafts, and spooky ghost towns are reminders of past fortunes won and\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe rocks, the work of water, wind, and sun, and the not insignificant\r\nupheavals by man have shaped New Mexico’s landscapes. Blended with its\r\nblue skies, warm sun, and the products of three cultures—Indian,\r\nSpanish, and American—the rocks and their movements have made the\r\nlandscapes a land of enchantment.\r\n\r\n  Earth wears a mantle rich with lore,\r\n      of storied fabric finely spun,\r\n  That tells of kingdoms come and gone,\r\n      of legions lost and battles won.\r\n  No seer no monarch can divine,\r\n      the cryptic writings; he alone,\r\n  Who humbly speaks the tongue of earth,\r\n      can find a story in a stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Before Coronado\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _by_ Robert H. Weber\r\n\r\nThe cultural heritage of New Mexico is a rich and colorful one, blending\r\nas it does the three separate traditions of Indian, Spanish, and\r\nAnglo-American. Of these, the lifeways of the Indian, ancient and\r\nmodern, are of particular interest to both the visitor and resident.\r\nThese were the first inhabitants of the New World, whose roots extend\r\nback in time many thousands of years before the first European set foot\r\nhere. People who had adapted themselves to the varied and often harsh\r\nenvironments of desert, plain, valley, canyon, and mountain; who\r\nwitnessed the disappearance of the large mammals of the Pleistocene Ice\r\nAge and concomitant changes in climate and vegetation; the first\r\nprospectors and miners seeking flint, obsidian, turquoise, clay, salt,\r\nand mineral pigments; early traders exchanging valued minerals and\r\nhandicrafts for shells of the coastal regions; hunters and farmers,\r\narchitects and builders, civic and religious leaders, philosophers and\r\ncritics, skilled craftsmen and artists, explorers and soldiers—all\r\nancient counterparts of those who were to follow.\r\n\r\nIn 1540, when the train of soldiers in the company of Coronado’s Spanish\r\nExpedition entered the unknown lands later called New Mexico, four\r\ngroups of native Americans were established residents in the area. Along\r\nthe arable valley of the Rio Grande and its tributaries, and in several\r\noutlying areas were the adobe and stone apartment-house villages of the\r\nPueblo Indians, whose livelihood was based largely on agriculture. East\r\nof the mountains were scattered bands of Plains Indians, Eastern\r\nApaches, who were nomadic hunters following the herds of buffalo that\r\nranged across the vast grasslands of the High Plains. Western Apaches\r\nwere dispersed in small bands of hunters and gatherers of wild foods\r\nthrough the mountainous country to the west of the Rio Grande. A related\r\ngroup, the Navajo, augmented the necessities of life gained by hunting\r\nand gathering with subordinate agricultural crops in the Plateau region\r\nto the northwest.\r\n\r\nEarly contacts of the _conquistadores_ were largely with the Pueblo\r\nIndians, although they had limited knowledge of the Apaches and Navajos\r\nin outlying districts. There was little to suggest to the Spanish\r\ninvaders, except for the ruins of long-abandoned Pueblo villages, that\r\nthe fragmentary record of thousands of years of human prehistory lay\r\nscattered in the dust beneath their feet. Undoubtedly they would have\r\ndismissed as utter nonsense any notion that men armed with stone-tipped\r\nspears had here slain elephants in a marsh 12,000 years old that now lay\r\nburied beneath shifting sands of a desert landscape. Indeed, it was not\r\nuntil the last quarter of the 1800’s that serious attempts were made to\r\ndecipher the prehistoric traces of the Pueblo Indians, whereas concrete\r\nevidence that man had hunted long-extinct Pleistocene big game in\r\nAmerica was not discovered until less than forty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HUNTERS\r\n\r\nThe year 1926 was marked by the first of a series of important\r\narcheological finds in New Mexico that were eventually to demonstrate\r\nthat man had occupied this area as much as 11,000 to 12,000 years ago.\r\nDuring this period, Late Pleistocene ice sheets of continental glaciers\r\nstill blanketed parts of the northern tier of states in the vicinity of\r\nthe Great Lakes, and elephants (both mammoths and mastodons), horses,\r\ncamels, giant bison, tapirs, and ground sloths roamed the Southwest.\r\nExcavations begun in 1926 near the small town of Folsom, in northeastern\r\nNew Mexico (fig. 1), disclosed a number of fossil skeletons of a large\r\nform of extinct bison, forerunners of the modern bison or buffalo. Among\r\nthese bones were dart or spear points of distinctive form and\r\nworkmanship, characterized by broad, shallow flutes or channels on each\r\nface (fig. 2). These artifacts, now known as Folsom points, have since\r\nbeen recovered from a number of sites in New Mexico and elsewhere in\r\nNorth America, commonly in association with the remains of extinct\r\nbison. Evidently Folsom “Man” (whose skeletal remains have not been\r\ndiscovered) was a nomadic hunter particularly dependent upon the bison\r\nfor his food supply, much as were the later Plains Indians of historic\r\ntime. Ages of from 10,000 to 11,000 years have been obtained from\r\ncharcoal and other organic remains at Folsom camp sites by the\r\nradiocarbon method.\r\n\r\nSucceeding years have seen an increasing number of valuable\r\narcheological discoveries at camp and game-kill sites of Folsom Man and\r\nother Early Hunters. Unquestionably, the most important of these sites\r\nis the Blackwater Draw locality between Clovis and Portales in extreme\r\neastern New Mexico, where excavations for gravel disclosed a stratified\r\nsequence of sediments that were deposited in an ancient pond and spring.\r\nHere, too, were the characteristic Folsom points in association with the\r\nbones of fossil bison. Below the Folsom layer, still older deposits\r\ncontained the fossil bones of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison\r\nassociated with fluted spear points that resembled those from Folsom but\r\nwere generally larger and less skillfully chipped and fluted. These\r\npoints, now known as Clovis points, are so commonly found beside the\r\nremains of mammoths in a number of sites in the High Plains and the\r\nSouthwest that their makers are believed to have been adept at hunting\r\nthese extinct elephants. Radiocarbon dates place Clovis points in a time\r\nrange of from 11,000 to 12,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn a layer above that containing Folsom points at Blackwater Draw,\r\nseveral varieties of unfluted lanceolate points were found to be\r\nassociated with the bones of fossil bison. These points have been\r\nidentified by various specific names such as Plainview, Milnesand, Eden,\r\nand Scottsbluff from excavated sites elsewhere in the High Plains\r\nregion, and probably range in age from 8000 to 10,000 years. Although\r\nthe giant bison still survived into this level of stratigraphy and time,\r\nthe elephant, camel, and horse of the Clovis level had disappeared from\r\nthe area.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1.

Below cave deposits containing Folsom points was an earlier\r\ntype of point among the bones of mammoth, horse, camel, and other large\r\nPleistocene mammals. Now identified as Sandia points, these projectile\r\ntips are distinguished by an asymmetric stemmed form with a shoulder on\r\none side. The age of the Sandia points has been a subject of some\r\ncontroversy, but the latest available data from charcoal in Sandia Cave\r\nindicates an age of nearly 12,000 years, which is within the accepted\r\nrange of the Clovis points.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2. Folsom point recovered from among rib bones\r\n    of fossil bison at Folsom, New Mexico (Photograph of plastic\r\n    replica. Original point in collection of Denver Museum of Natural\r\n    History.)]\r\n\r\nClovis, Sandia, and Folsom points, together with related stone\r\nimplements, are at many places enclosed in sediments deposited in or\r\nadjacent to ponds, lakes, streams, and wet meadows. These environments\r\nindicate a former cool and more humid climate in areas that are now\r\nsemiarid. The food requirements of many of the large herbivores that\r\nlived at this time also suggest more abundant vegetation and surface\r\nwater than prevails here today. It is not unreasonable, then, to presume\r\nthat climatic conditions contributing to the advance of continental\r\nglaciers in the Great Lakes region, and to valley glaciers in the Rocky\r\nMountains, should have been reflected in lower summer temperatures and\r\nhigher rainfall in non-glaciated areas. The ultimate extinction of the\r\nlarge Pleistocene mammals and the similar time of disappearance of the\r\nhunters who preyed upon them may both be related to the climatic changes\r\nthat followed the end of the Ice Age in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTERS AND GATHERERS\r\n\r\nGroups of people dependent upon a different way of life from that of the\r\nEarly Hunters are known to have occupied much of the present area of New\r\nMexico. Although there is some suggestion of overlap in time of these\r\npeople with the Early Hunters, they appear to have become prominent\r\nduring the several thousand warm, dry years following the end of the\r\nPleistocene. Adapted, as they were, to a fuller utilization of the\r\nresources of the area through the hunting and trapping of smaller game\r\nand an emphasis on the gathering of a wide variety of wild plant foods,\r\nthese people ranged extensively across the varied terrain of the state.\r\nSimilar patterns of subsistence and artifacts are known from the Great\r\nBasin region west of the Rocky Mountains, where they have been\r\ncategorized under the term _Desert Culture_. Local manifestations of the\r\nDesert Culture in southeastern Arizona, extending eastward into western\r\nand southern New Mexico, are identified as the Cochise Culture. Other\r\ngroups showing similarities with Archaic cultures to the east penetrated\r\nthe northeastern part of New Mexico at a time when the area was still\r\npopulated by Pleistocene bison.\r\n\r\nHabitation sites of these gatherers are distributed in open situations\r\nand in shelter caves. Such sites are commonly marked by milling stones\r\nthat characterize the preparation of wild foods (fig. 3), hearths,\r\nchopping and scraping implements, and stemmed projectile points markedly\r\ndifferent from those used by the Early Hunters. These points were\r\naffixed to dart shafts that were propelled with a spear thrower or\r\n_atlatl_, a device that preceded the bow and arrow in America but is\r\nstill used by Australian Aborigines.\r\n\r\nSeasonal changes in the local availability of wild foods must have\r\nnecessitated a nomadic or seminomadic way of life. The development of\r\nagricultural techniques in the later years before the beginning of the\r\nChristian Era, however, probably contributed to the development of a\r\nsemisedentary existence that was eventually to lead to the village life\r\nof the later periods. The exact time of introduction of the principal\r\nagricultural crops, corn, squash, and beans, is unknown, but evidence\r\nfrom west-central New Mexico indicates their use by the Cochise people\r\nby 2500 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUEBLOAN FARMERS\r\n\r\nHaving acquired the techniques of deliberately planting and raising food\r\ncrops that could be stored against future needs, local populations of\r\nHunters and Gatherers became less dependent upon the gathering of wild\r\nfoods and began to construct clusters of more permanent dwellings near\r\ncultivable land. Among the earliest recognized houses of this period are\r\nthe semisubterranean pit houses of the early Mogollon people in the San\r\nFrancisco River drainage of west-central New Mexico (fig. 4) and of the\r\nAnasazi Basketmakers in the San Juan River drainage of northwestern New\r\nMexico. These cultural advances, together with the acquisition of\r\ntechniques for the manufacture of fired pottery, foreshadowed the\r\ndevelopment of the Mogollon and Pueblo cultures at a time beginning\r\nperhaps as early as 300 B.C. for the Mogollon area and at least by 1\r\nA.D. for the Anasazi area.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. Milling stones of the type used by the\r\n    Cochise People\r\n    Plant foods were ground in a shallow basin metate with the small\r\n    one-hand mano (hand stone). Socorro, New Mexico.]\r\n\r\nThese two cultural groups, the Mogollon in southwestern and southern New\r\nMexico, whose roots extend back through the ancestral Cochise to before\r\n6000 B.C., and the Anasazi in the Four Corners region of northwestern\r\nNew Mexico, probably developed independently during the early years.\r\nFrom about 500 A.D., however, there is increasing evidence of trade\r\nrelationships and eventual fusion of traits. Other groups to the west,\r\nsuch as the Hohokam of Arizona, were sources of cultural influence on\r\nthe indigenous people of New Mexico. In the Mogollon and San Juan\r\nAnasazi heartlands and in the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico, a\r\npattern of village life with elaboration of social and religious\r\norganization emerged from the relatively simple cultures of the early\r\nyears. Villages began to assume organized form, dwellings were combined\r\nin rows of adobe and stone structures containing a number of contiguous\r\nrooms, and subterranean ceremonial chambers or _kivas_ assumed larger\r\nand more specialized architectural distinctiveness from the ancestral\r\npit-house dwellings. In the Mogollon area, the characteristic brownware\r\npottery of the Mogollons was used side by side with decorated\r\nblack-on-white pottery of Anasazi origin. The bow and arrow slowly\r\nreplaced the less efficient _atlatl_ and dart. The significance of these\r\nearly stages in the evolution of the Pueblo Culture in the San Juan and\r\nupper Rio Grande areas is indicated by their designation as the\r\nDevelopmental Pueblo period (Pueblo I and II).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Photograph of museum diorama courtesy of the\r\n    Chicago Natural History Museum_)\r\n     Figure 4. Mogollon pit-house village of the period 200 B.C.]\r\n\r\nThe climax of these developments occurred in the interval between 1050\r\nand 1300 A.D. in the Classic or Great Pueblo period (Pueblo III). Among\r\nthe most impressive manifestations of this period are large\r\nstone-masonry apartment houses, some rising to five stories in height\r\nand housing hundreds of people. Dwellings of this type are highlights of\r\nseveral well-known tourist attractions, among which are the cliff\r\ndwellings of Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado and the monumental\r\nruins of Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon (fig. 5), both products of the\r\ningenuity of the Anasazi Indians.\r\n\r\nAt the very apex of the cultural efflorescence of the Great Pueblo\r\nperiod, some unknown circumstance or series of events caused abandonment\r\nof most of the urban centers of the San Juan Anasazi and Mogollon areas.\r\nA prolonged drouth is recorded by tree rings formed during the period\r\nfrom 1276 to 1299 A.D. Surely a drouth of this magnitude would have had\r\nserious effects on people as dependent upon agriculture as were the\r\nPueblo Indians. There are some indications that alien and perhaps enemy\r\npeople were drifting into these areas at about this time, perhaps\r\npredecessors of the modern Navajos and Apaches. The congested living\r\nconditions of Pueblo villages undoubtedly contributed to unsanitary\r\nconditions and social pressures that also may have contributed to shifts\r\nin population. Many of these migrants moved into the homeland of the Rio\r\nGrande Anasazi in the upper Rio Grande Valley, and to a lesser extent in\r\nthe central Rio Grande Valley. Some may have relocated at Zuni and other\r\nareas along the Little Colorado River drainage extending westward into\r\nArizona.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Photograph courtesy of the National Park Service_)\r\n    Figure 5. Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon National Monument\r\n    A multistory pueblo containing 800 rooms.]\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Pueblo period, another group showing characteristics of\r\nboth the Anasazi and of non-Puebloan people occupied an area on both\r\nsides of the Continental Divide along the eastern margin of the San Juan\r\nBasin. This cultural phase, known as the Largo-Gallina because of the\r\ndistribution of sites in the Largo and Gallina drainage basins, is\r\nrepresented by pit houses, surface rooms, and towerlike structures with\r\nsome similarities to the dwellings of the Anasazi. The black-on-white\r\npottery also suggests Puebloan relationships, whereas the culinary\r\nvessels resemble those of the Navajo.\r\n\r\nBeginning at about 1300 A.D. or shortly thereafter, a different cultural\r\ngroup began to move westward from the Texas Panhandle into the plains of\r\nnortheastern New Mexico. These people of the Panhandle Aspect built\r\nsingle-room structures and contiguous room pueblos resembling those in\r\nuse by the Anasazi of the Rio Grande and were skilled bison hunters,\r\nfarmers, and traders. This combination of traits suggests both Puebloan\r\nand eastern traditions. Panhandle Aspect villages were abandoned\r\nsuddenly not long after 1400, perhaps as a result of the drouth recorded\r\nby tree rings for the period from 1439 to 1454.\r\n\r\nFollowing the shift in population of the Pueblo region, cultural changes\r\noccurred that have led to the designation Regressive Pueblo period\r\n(Pueblo IV) for the interval between 1300 and 1700 A.D. Noteworthy\r\nchanges during this period include a tendency toward enlargement of\r\nvillages and the creation of new styles of pottery, accompanied by some\r\ndeterioration of the artistic creativity of the Classic period. Major\r\nruins of this period that are readily accessible to the public include\r\nPuye Cliff Dwellings, Tyuonyi Pueblo in Bandelier National Monument, and\r\nPecos Pueblo in Pecos National Monument.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Coronado’s _entrada_ in 1540, there were from 60 to 70\r\nPueblo villages in New Mexico, most of which contained fewer than 400\r\ninhabitants. Four or five mutually unintelligible languages were spoken,\r\neach with several dialects, making communication between Spanish and\r\nIndian extremely difficult. Language barriers contributed to an\r\ninadequate documentation of the Pueblo way of life during the early\r\nyears of Spanish contact, so that we must continue to depend upon the\r\narcheological record during the first century of Spanish colonization of\r\nthe area. The beginning of the Historic Pueblo period (Pueblo V)\r\naccordingly is commonly set at 1700 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPACHES AND NAVAJOS\r\n\r\nLittle is known concerning the origin of these two related groups, who\r\ndiffer markedly from the Pueblo Indians in language and cultural traits.\r\nTheir closest ties are with other Athapaskan-speaking tribes in\r\nnorthwestern Canada, and available evidence indicates that they are\r\ncomparative newcomers to the Southwest. A correlation between the\r\nabandonment of sections of the Pueblo region and pressures exerted by\r\nancestral Apaches and Navajos has been suggested, but definite proof of\r\nthis is still lacking. Raids against the eastern pueblos of the Galisteo\r\nBasin are reported to have occurred in 1525. Coronado’s expedition\r\nencountered nomadic hunters in the plains east of Pecos in 1541,\r\nobserving that they followed the movements of herds of bison or buffalo\r\non whom they were highly dependent for food and shelter, lived in\r\nportable tents of tanned buffalo hides supported by a framework of\r\npoles, and used dogs as beasts of burden. Trade contacts with the Rio\r\nGrande pueblos included exchange of hide “cloaks” for corn grown by the\r\nPueblo Indians.\r\n\r\nRelated groups in western and northwestern New Mexico are even more\r\npoorly known, as there was still less contact between them and the\r\nSpanish explorers. Evidently some agriculture was practiced as a\r\nsupplement to a subsistence based largely on hunting and gathering, a\r\npattern of livelihood reminiscent of that of the pre-Puebloan Cochise\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding years of Spanish and American colonization of New Mexico\r\nwere to be highly influenced by the Apaches and Navajos, and also by\r\nanother group of Plains Indians, the Comanches. The events of this\r\nperiod, however, are discussed in a separate article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Frontier Forts of New Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _by_ Robert A. Bieberman\r\n\r\nFollowing President Polk’s declaration of war against Mexico in May\r\n1846, a United States Army force was sent from Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas\r\nTerritory, against the Mexican provinces of New Mexico and California.\r\nThis army, known as “The Army of the West,” was led by Gen. Stephen W.\r\nKearny. Upon his arrival in Santa Fe in August 1846, General Kearny\r\nissued a proclamation which informed the citizens that New Mexico was\r\nnow a part of the United States and that he and his army and the forces\r\nto follow would protect them and their property. General Kearny remained\r\nin Santa Fe only one month, but during that month he appointed a\r\ngovernor, judges, and other officials, started construction of a fort in\r\nSanta Fe, and sent troops against the Navajo Indians in fulfillment of\r\nhis promise to protect the people. Kearny and his “Army of the West”\r\nleft Santa Fe in September 1846 to conquer California, leaving behind a\r\ndetachment of troops under the command of Col. Alexander W. Doniphan.\r\nThus began the role of the U.S. Army, which was to continue for the next\r\nhalf century, in securing the frontier in what we now know as the State\r\nof New Mexico.\r\n\r\nHistory has shown that the troops stationed in New Mexico were called\r\nupon to participate in the Mexican War and the Civil War and to protect\r\nthe newly established border between Mexico and New Mexico from\r\nviolations from both sides. However, the basic role of the military, the\r\nrole which continued for fifty years, was to protect the traveler, the\r\nfarmer, the miner, and the settler from Indian attack. Its task was made\r\nno less difficult by the changing, unrealistic, discriminatory Indian\r\npolicies which came out of Washington during this period. When relative\r\ncalm was established, promises were forgotten and violence erupted anew.\r\n\r\nThe defense policy in New Mexico did not follow a set plan but gradually\r\nevolved. Military posts were established at different places when the\r\nneed arose and were abandoned when the need diminished. A few of the\r\nposts were occupied and used by the army throughout most of this period.\r\nOthers existed but a few months or years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fort Union\r\n\r\nLocated twenty-seven miles northeast of Las Vegas, Fort Union became the\r\nmost important and most famous fort in the New Mexico Territory.\r\nEstablished on the Santa Fe Trail in 1851, it served as supply depot for\r\nthe territory and as a base for troops engaged in the protection of\r\ntraffic along the Santa Fe Trail and of the settlements in the area from\r\nthe depredations of the Apaches, Utes, Comanches, and Kiowas. The site\r\ncan be reached by traveling eight miles of paved road which leaves U.S.\r\nHighway 85 one mile north of Watrous.\r\n\r\nDuring its forty-year history, Fort Union occupied three different\r\nsites, all within the same general area. The original fort was of log\r\nconstruction which rapidly fell into disrepair. In August 1861, amid\r\nrumors of the possible invasion of the territory by Confederate forces,\r\nconstruction was begun on a new fort. This fort was of earthworks, in\r\nthe form of an eight-pointed star. It was here that the troops waited\r\nfor the attack which never came. With the passing of the Confederate\r\nthreat, work was begun in 1863 on the third fort, the remains of which\r\nare seen today.\r\n\r\nFort Union soon became the largest fort in the territory. It was\r\nconstructed in two sections, one for the garrison and one for the supply\r\ndepot. The garrison area consisted of four infantry and two cavalry\r\nbarracks facing a row of nine officers’ quarters across the parade\r\nground. A sixty-bed hospital was constructed. The depot area included\r\nfive warehouses, mechanics corral, transportation corral, and\r\nadministration buildings. An arsenal was built about one mile from the\r\nfort proper.\r\n\r\nThe buildings were constructed of adobe on stone foundations. The roofs\r\nwere flat and the walls were capped with brick copings in what has\r\nbecome the territorial style of architecture.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Photo courtesy of National Park Service_)\r\n    Ruins of Fort Union]\r\n\r\nFort Union was a community within itself and a lively social center.\r\nWeary travelers on the Santa Fe Trail eagerly anticipated their arrival.\r\nFew complaints were heard when soldiers were transferred to Fort Union,\r\nfor this was a popular assignment.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the railroad and peace at last descending on the\r\nfrontier in the 1880’s, the need for the fort diminished. But it clung\r\nto life for a few more years, mainly because of the fond memories which\r\nlived in the hearts of the military leaders who had been stationed\r\nthere. Finally, the end came and Fort Union was abandoned in February\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nNew life came to the fort in 1955 when it became a National Monument.\r\nThe ruins have been excavated and stabilized and a fine visitors’ center\r\nand museum has been established. Fort Union has at last assumed its\r\nrightful place as a shrine of history. Stand on the parade ground and\r\nsurvey the majesty that was Fort Union, listen for the sounds, the bugle\r\ncalls, the barklike commands of close-order drill, the creak of wagons,\r\nand the thunder of horses’ hooves. These are the sounds of Fort Union.\r\nThey are still there if one will only pause and listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fort Marcy\r\n\r\nFort Marcy was established in 1846 at Santa Fe and was named for the\r\nthen Secretary of War, W. L. Marcy. The fort was located on a hill\r\noverlooking the city some 1000 yards northeast of the plaza. A deep\r\nditch or moat surrounded the massive adobe walls of the fort and a\r\nblockhouse, within musket range, protected the only entrance. At the\r\ntime of Colonel Manfield’s inspection trip in August 1853, the troops\r\nwere quartered in public buildings in Santa Fe, there being no quarters\r\nprovided at the fort; however, it could be occupied on a moment’s\r\nnotice. The original Fort Marcy was abandoned in 1867 and a new one was\r\nconstructed a short distance to the west. This new site is now occupied\r\nby business and residential properties. The War Department abandoned\r\nFort Marcy in October 1894, the troops and equipment being moved to Fort\r\nSill, Oklahoma. The site was turned over to the city of Santa Fe in\r\n1897.\r\n\r\nFort Marcy played an important role during the military occupation of\r\nNew Mexico. It served as a base of operations against marauding Indians,\r\nwas captured and occupied for a short time by Confederate forces in\r\n1862, served as headquarters for the Ninth Military Department (changed\r\nto Department of New Mexico in 1853) throughout most of this period, and\r\nwas a center for the social life of Santa Fe. Only low mounds of earth\r\nnow mark the site of Fort Marcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Fort Wingate\r\n\r\nFort Wingate, at the site known today, was established in 1868. It is\r\nlocated on the site of a pre-existing fort at Ojo del Oso (Bear Springs)\r\nabout twelve miles east of Gallup and three miles south of U.S. Highway\r\n66.\r\n\r\nFort Fauntleroy was established in August 1860 and was named for the\r\nthen Department Commander, Col. T. T. Fauntleroy. The name was changed\r\nto Fort Lyon in September 1861 after Colonel Fauntleroy resigned his\r\ncommission and joined the Confederate forces. The fort was abandoned in\r\nDecember 1861 as troops were concentrated at other posts to meet the\r\nthreat of invasion of the territory by Confederate forces from the\r\nsouth. With the defeat of Confederate troops early in 1862, the military\r\nreturned to the Indian problem and established a post some sixty miles\r\nto the east on the Rio de Gallo near San Rafael. This post was named\r\nFort Wingate in honor of Capt. Benjamin Wingate who died of wounds\r\nreceived during the battle with the Confederate forces at Val Verde. The\r\npost proved to be too far from the Navajo country for effective control\r\nand, in 1868, was abandoned and a new Fort Wingate established at Ojo\r\ndel Oso on the site occupied earlier by Fort Fauntleroy.\r\n\r\nThe physical plant of the new Fort Wingate consisted of barracks,\r\nofficers’ quarters, hospital, guard house, storehouse, employees’\r\nquarters, corrals, barns, and various repair and storage sheds, all\r\nbordering the traditional rectangular parade ground. Some of these\r\nbuildings are in use today.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, 4000 Mexican refugees lived in a tent city at Fort Wingate\r\nuntil peace was restored after Pancho Villa’s revolution in Mexico.\r\nFollowing World War I, it became an ordnance storage depot, and new\r\nadministrative and living quarters were built several miles west of the\r\noriginal fort enclosure. This installation is known today as Fort\r\nWingate Ordnance Depot, and the long rows of concrete ammunition storage\r\nbunkers can be seen from U.S. Highway 66. In 1925, the original fort\r\nenclosure was transferred to the Department of the Interior for use as\r\nan Indian school. Today, the parade ground is a playground and the\r\nbarracks are dormitories for the children who attend this school. The\r\nmissile age came to Fort Wingate in 1963 when a portion of the military\r\nreservation became the launching site for test rockets which impact at\r\nthe White Sands Missile Range 200 miles to the south.\r\n\r\nFort Wingate has seen many changes during its long and colorful history.\r\nIt served well during its first 100 years and continues to serve today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fort Craig\r\n\r\nFort Craig was established in the spring of 1854 on the abandonment of\r\nFort Conrad, nine miles north. It was named in honor of Col. L. S. Craig\r\nwho was killed by an army deserter on June 6, 1852. The remains of Fort\r\nCraig are located on the west bank of the Rio Grande about thirty-four\r\nmiles south of Socorro and five miles, by dirt road, east of U.S.\r\nHighway 85. The fort was established to afford protection against the\r\nmany bands of Apaches that roamed this part of the territory.\r\n\r\nFort Craig was well built and became one of the best-garrisoned military\r\nposts in New Mexico. Built on the usual rectangular plan, the parade\r\nground was bordered on the northeast by two double officers’ quarters;\r\non the northwest by the guard house, prison room, and sallyport; on the\r\nsouthwest by three soldiers’ barracks each in the form of a hollow\r\nsquare enclosing a patio; and on the southeast by various workshops,\r\nstorerooms, stables, and corrals. The commanding officers’ quarters\r\noccupied the west corner of the parade ground and the hospital the east\r\ncorner. Behind the commanding officers’ quarters there were three large\r\nbombproof storerooms. The entire installation was enclosed within a high\r\nwall, beyond which a ditch encircled the fort. Gun bastions projected\r\nfrom the north and south corners.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Remnants of guard house, Fort Craig (built of basalt\r\n    blocks)]\r\n\r\nFort Craig was one of the most important military posts in New Mexico.\r\nIts troops participated in many engagements with the Indian. In the fall\r\nof 1861, troops from other posts were concentrated at Fort Craig to meet\r\nthe threatened invasion of Confederate forces from the south. In\r\nFebruary 1862, these troops were defeated by the Confederate invaders in\r\nthe battle of Val Verde which took place about four miles north of the\r\nfort. Upon the withdrawal of Confederate forces from the territory later\r\nin 1862, the troops at Fort Craig returned to the Indian problem. In\r\nMarch 1885, the fort was relinquished by the army and the improvements\r\nsold. The last soldier left in August 1885 after government property was\r\nremoved and sent to Forts Bliss and Stanton. The buildings were sold at\r\npublic auction on April 30, 1894, to the Valverde Land and Irrigation\r\nCompany for $1070.50.\r\n\r\nFort Craig is now a ruin, but the outlines of most of the buildings can\r\nstill be seen. Portions of the plastered walls of the commanding\r\nofficers’ quarters remain, as do portions of the hospital and stone\r\nguard house. The wall and ditch surrounding the fort, gun bastions,\r\nstorehouses, and cemetery are still much in evidence. Coal marks the\r\nblacksmith’s shop and broken bottles the sutler’s store. Another\r\nfrontier fort has passed into history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Fort Stanton\r\n\r\nFort Stanton was established in May 1855 on the Rio Bonito at a site\r\nlocated approximately four miles east of present-day Capitan and three\r\nmiles south of U.S. Highway 380. The fort was an attempt to control the\r\nMescalero and White Mountain Apaches and was named for Capt. H. W.\r\nStanton who had been killed by Apache Indians earlier that year. Many a\r\nsoldier stationed at Fort Stanton gave up his life to an Apache during\r\nthe Indian wars.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Map of New Mexico showing location of frontier forts]\r\n\r\nThe original fort was little more than a stockade, with few buildings\r\nand little equipment. In August 1861, the government stores were burned\r\nand the troops moved to Albuquerque in the face of the Confederate\r\ninvasion. Confederate troops occupied the site one month later but\r\npromptly left after a few encounters with the Apache. The site was\r\nreoccupied by Union troops October 1862 and, later, substantial\r\nbuildings were erected, most of which still stand.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the frontier, Fort Stanton was abandoned as a\r\nmilitary post in August 1896, and in 1899, the installation passed to\r\nthe U.S. Public Health Service for use as a merchant marine hospital for\r\nthe treatment of tuberculosis. During World War II, a German prisoner of\r\nwar camp was established at the fort. In 1953, the hospital was closed\r\nby the federal government because of the high cost of running the\r\nestablishment. Fort Stanton is now a state tuberculosis hospital\r\noperated by the New Mexico Department of Public Welfare.\r\n\r\nCol. Kit Carson used the fort as a base of operations while rounding up\r\nthe Mescalero and White Mountain Apaches in late 1862 and early 1863. In\r\n1881, the famous outlaw, Billy the Kid, was confined in the building now\r\nused as a dental clinic while on his way to the gallows in Lincoln,\r\nwhich never claimed him. Gen. John J. Pershing, as a young lieutenant,\r\nwas stationed for a time at Fort Stanton.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Fort Selden\r\n\r\nFort Selden was established in 1865 and named for Capt. Henry R. Selden\r\n(later colonel) who distinguished himself at the battle of Val Verde,\r\nFebruary 21, 1862. The fort was beside the Rio Grande nine miles north\r\nof the settlement of Doña Ana. The site is located along U.S. Highway 85\r\nabout seventeen miles north of present-day Las Cruces.\r\n\r\nFort Selden was one of a chain of forts established to control the\r\nApaches. It was on the Butterfield Trail and provided protection for the\r\ngovernment rope ferry which crossed the Rio Grande at nearby Leasburg.\r\nThe summit of Mt. Robledo, across the river to the west, was used as a\r\nheliograph station, flashing messages between Fort Selden and Fort Bliss\r\nat Franklin (El Paso, Texas).\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the fort were one-story adobe structures with walls two\r\nfeet thick. The installation included barracks for enlisted men, two\r\ndouble officers’ quarters, a ten-bed hospital, stone guard house,\r\nstorehouses, workshop, bake shop, corrals, and a magazine with stone\r\nwalls three feet thick. The fort was rectangular in ground plan, the\r\nbuildings enclosing a parade ground.\r\n\r\nFort Selden was abandoned in 1879 when the railroads began to draw\r\ntravel away from the overland trails. It was reoccupied in 1881 when the\r\nApache Chiefs Victorio, Nana, and later Geronimo were on the warpath.\r\nWith the passing of the Indian problem, Fort Selden was permanently\r\nabandoned in 1892. During World War I, the grounds of the fort were used\r\nfor cavalry maneuvers by units stationed at Fort Bliss.\r\n\r\nA rather famous American once lived at Fort Selden. Gen. Douglas\r\nMacArthur, as a child of four, moved with his family to the fort in\r\n1884, following the assignment of his father, then an infantry captain,\r\nto that post. The family remained at Fort Selden until late in 1886.\r\n\r\nNow only crumbling adobe walls mark the site of Fort Selden, once a\r\nwelcome sight to travelers in southern New Mexico. The wind, rain, and\r\nsun have taken their toll, aided in no small way by man himself. In\r\n1963, through the efforts of the Doña Ana Historical Society, Fort\r\nSelden was made a State Monument by the New Mexico legislature. It is to\r\nbe hoped that the fort will now be protected from further weathering and\r\nvandalism so that the remnants of this old outpost will stand for many\r\nyears to come as a monument to the men who once manned it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Fort Cummings\r\n\r\nFort Cummings was established in October 1863 in what is now Luna\r\nCounty, New Mexico. It was located at Cooke’s Spring, an important\r\nwatering stop on the Butterfield Trail, at the eastern edge of Cooke’s\r\nCanyon. Prior to the establishment of Fort Cummings, the Apaches made\r\nfrequent and fatal attacks upon travelers as they passed through the\r\nfour miles of Cooke’s Canyon or stopped at the spring. Cooke’s Canyon\r\nwas one of the most dangerous stretches on the Butterfield Trail. The\r\nfort was named for Maj. Joseph Cummings who was killed by Navajo Indians\r\nin August 1863. Its ruins can be reached by turning off State Highway 26\r\nat Florida, sixteen miles northeast of Deming, and traveling seven miles\r\nto the west.\r\n\r\nFort Cummings was the most elaborate and best-walled fort in New Mexico.\r\nIt covered an area 365 × 320 feet and was completely surrounded by a\r\ntwelve-foot-high adobe wall. The main entrance was topped by a guard\r\ntower. Officers’ quarters occupied the west side of the parade ground,\r\nthe hospital the north side, and soldiers’ quarters the east side. The\r\nvarious workshops, storerooms, offices, stables, and corrals extended\r\nalong the south side of the fort.\r\n\r\nAbandoned in August 1873, Fort Cummings was reoccupied in 1880, and then\r\nagain abandoned in October 1886. Later it was used as a cattle corral by\r\nthe Carpenter-Stanley Cattle Company. The spring was walled and covered,\r\nand the water piped to Florida.\r\n\r\nLittle remains of Fort Cummings today. A few weathered walls here and\r\nthere among the mesquite and creosote bushes mark the site. The spring\r\nstill flows, supplying water for the stock which now graze upon this\r\n“protector of the trail.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Fort Bayard\r\n\r\nFort Bayard, established in 1865 to protect the miners and settlers\r\nmoving into the area following the Civil War, allowed the orderly\r\ndevelopment of what was to become New Mexico’s most important\r\nmineral-producing area. Named for Capt. George D. Bayard who was wounded\r\nrepeatedly during Indian forays and who died of wounds received in the\r\nBattle of Fredricksburg (Va.) during the Civil War, the fort was located\r\nabout five miles southeast of Pinos Altos and about midway between the\r\nmining towns of Pinos Altos and Santa Rita. The site is about nine miles\r\neast of present-day Silver City, just north of State Highway 90.\r\n\r\nThe original fort consisted of log and adobe buildings forming a square\r\naround the parade ground. During its thirty-four year history as an army\r\npost, many changes and additions were made to the fort, including the\r\nbuilding of two-storied officers’ quarters. In 1899, the line troops\r\nwere removed and the fort was officially designated as a U.S. Army\r\nGeneral Hospital to treat tubercular soldiers. In 1920, the hospital was\r\nturned over to the Public Health Department; in 1922, to the U.S.\r\nVeterans Administration; and again, in 1966, to the State Health\r\nDepartment as a facility for the care of the aged and of tuberculosis\r\ncases. It can now accommodate more than 300 patients. The modern\r\nbuildings are a far cry from the dirt-floored log and adobe buildings of\r\nthe original fort.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Pre-Civil War Period._\r\n\r\nThe period 1846 to 1861 was characterized by constant Indian warfare.\r\nTreaties were made, then broken. Forts were established, then abandoned,\r\nand new forts built as the military tried in vain to cope with the\r\nproblem. Punitive expeditions proved ineffective as the Indians\r\nseparated into small and predatory bands which overran the country.\r\n\r\nForts Union, Marcy, Fauntleroy, Craig, and Stanton were established\r\nduring this period. Additional forts, whose sites have returned to the\r\ndesert, are Fort Conrad (1851), on the Rio Grande about twenty-five\r\nmiles south of Socorro; Fort Thorn (1853), on the Rio Grande about five\r\nmiles north of Hatch; Fort Fillmore (1851), on the Rio Grande about\r\nseven miles south of Las Cruces; Fort Webster (1852), on the Mimbres\r\nRiver about one and one-half miles northwest of San Lorenzo; Fort McLane\r\n(1860), at Apache Tejo about four miles south of Hurley; and Fort Floyd\r\n(1857), on the Gila River about two miles south of Cliff.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Civil War Period._\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 created a new problem on the\r\nfrontier in New Mexico. Confederate military leaders moved quickly to\r\nseize control of the Southwest and California to cut off the supply of\r\ngold to the North and divert it to the Confederacy. Confederate troops\r\nunder Col. J. B. Baylor occupied abandoned Fort Bliss at Franklin (El\r\nPaso), Texas on July 1, 1861. Baylor began his move northward along the\r\nRio Grande on July 23 and quickly occupied Mesilla. Nearby Fort Fillmore\r\nwas abandoned and the Union forces retreated toward Fort Stanton, but\r\nthey were soon captured by Baylor’s troops. Upon the fall of Fort\r\nFillmore, Fort Stanton was hastily abandoned on August 2 and was taken\r\nover by the Confederates shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nGen. H. H. Sibley arrived at Fort Bliss in December 1861 to assume\r\ncommand of the Confederate forces. Sibley’s troops moved northward along\r\nthe Rio Grande and were engaged in battle by Union troops from Fort\r\nCraig, under Gen. E. R. S. Canby, as they attempted to bypass the\r\nwell-garrisoned post. The Battle of Val Verde took place four miles\r\nnorth of Fort Craig on February 21, 1862. After a day of bloody\r\nfighting, Sibley emerged the victor. He occupied Albuquerque on March 2,\r\n1862, and Santa Fe on March 23. The Confederate forces then moved toward\r\nFort Union in an attempt to gain complete control of the territory. On\r\nMarch 27 and 28, they were met by Union forces sent out from Fort Union\r\nand were defeated in battle near present-day Glorieta. Sibley then\r\nretreated to Fort Bliss.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Confederate campaign in New Mexico, 1861-1862]\r\n\r\nWhile Sibley was thus engaged, another part of his army moved across\r\nwhat is now southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona and\r\noccupied Tucson (Arizona). Gen. J. H. Carleton and his California Column\r\nleft Los Angeles on April 13 and cleared this area of Confederate\r\ntroops, reaching the Rio Grande on August 7. Carleton reoccupied Fort\r\nBliss, which had been abandoned by the Confederate troops in their\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Post-Civil War Period._\r\n\r\nWhile the Union troops were preoccupied with the Confederates, the\r\nIndians stepped up their raids and depredations. With the passing of the\r\nConfederate threat, attention was once more focused on the Indian\r\nproblem. A new plan was formulated which called for the capturing of the\r\nIndians and confining them to reservations. A reservation (Bosque\r\nRedondo) was established late in 1862 near present-day Fort Sumner, New\r\nMexico, to which were eventually confined several thousand Navajos and\r\nMescalero Apaches. This resettlement was not a success since the Apaches\r\nran off and the Navajos suffered greatly from sickness and disease. A\r\ntreaty was signed with the Navajos in 1868, and they were allowed to\r\nreturn to their homes, no longer a threat to the frontier. The Mescalero\r\nApaches were finally settled on a reservation in their own country south\r\nof Fort Stanton, and the Jicarillas on a reservation west of Tierra\r\nAmarilla.\r\n\r\nThe Mimbreno, Mogollon, and Warm Springs Apaches of southwestern New\r\nMexico were more of a problem. In 1871, a reservation and Fort Tularosa\r\nwere established near present-day Aragon in western New Mexico. After a\r\nfutile attempt to keep the Indians there, they were moved in 1874 to a\r\nnew reservation and military post at Ojo Caliente, about forty miles\r\nnorthwest of present-day Truth or Consequences. This, too, proved a\r\nfailure and the Apaches were moved to the San Carlos Reservation in what\r\nis now Arizona. During these attempts to locate the Apaches on\r\nreservations, various rebellious bands of Apaches led by Victorio, Nana,\r\nand Geronimo continued on the warpath. Geronimo and his band surrendered\r\nin 1886 and were imprisoned in Florida. After Geronimo’s surrender,\r\nrelative peace descended upon the frontier in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nEstablished in the post-Civil War period were Forts Wingate (old and\r\nnew), Selden, Cummings, and Bayard, as well as Fort Lowell (1868), near\r\nTierra Amarilla; Fort Bascom (1863), on the Canadian River about eight\r\nmiles north of Tucumcari; Fort Sumner (1862), on the Pecos River about\r\nfive miles southeast of present-day Fort Sumner; Fort McRae (1863), on\r\nthe Rio Grande about ten miles northeast of Truth or Consequences; and\r\nFort West (1863), on the Gila River about two miles south of Cliff.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of the railroad and cessation of hostilities with the\r\nIndians, a new era was begun. One by one, the old forts were abandoned:\r\ntheir need had passed. The colorful frontier forts of New Mexico are\r\njust a memory now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Our National Heritage\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Forests in the so-called “desert” state of New Mexico cover\r\nmore than 8.5 million acres, about 11 per cent of the state’s area.\r\nNational Monuments and Carlsbad Caverns National Park only extend over\r\nabout 430 square miles but cover ten of New Mexico’s most scenic areas\r\nthat are of national geologic, archeologic, and historic interest. These\r\nare our national heritage, set aside by the federal government for the\r\nperpetual equal use of all Americans.\r\n\r\nThe forests cap the higher ranges of the state, except on windblown\r\npeaks that extend above the timberline. They provide protection for the\r\nwatersheds that feed New Mexico’s rivers, supply about 125 million board\r\nfeet of cut timber each year, and yield forage for more than 150,000\r\ncattle and sheep. Picnic nooks and camp grounds are plentiful, fish\r\nabound in the rushing mountain streams, and big game awaits the hunter\r\nthroughout the forest lands. The primitive virgin wilderness is\r\npreserved in its natural state, accessible only by pack trip, in the\r\nGila Wilderness area of the Diablo and Mogollon mountains north of\r\nSilver City and the Pecos Wilderness area east of Santa Fe in the Sangre\r\nde Cristo Mountains.\r\n\r\nIncomparable Carlsbad Caverns is in the state’s only National Park.\r\nNational Monuments include the glistening gypsum dunes of White Sands,\r\nthe volcanic cone of Capulin Mountain, the prehistoric ruins of Chaco\r\nCanyon, Aztec Ruins, Bandelier, and Gila Cliff Dwellings, the Spanish\r\nruins at Gran Quivira, Inscription Rock at El Morro, and the crumbling\r\nwalls of old Fort Union. In the near future, Valle Grande may be added\r\nto the National Park System and will include Valle Caldera, one of the\r\nworld’s largest volcanic calderas, a mountainous jumble with cool\r\nstreams, thick coniferous forests, and lush high meadows.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO’S BIG SHARE OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM\r\n\r\n                       _by_ H. V. Reeves, Jr.[2]\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the growth of cities and towns, the insatiable suburbs,\r\ncongested streets and highways, the acres of dump yards for discarded\r\nautomobiles, legions of billboards upstaging mountain ranges and\r\nseashores, and the melancholy predictions of demographers who say that\r\nwithin thirty years there will be twice as many of us, consider this:\r\nfor New Mexico in particular, the outlook is not utterly bleak.\r\n\r\nSome ninety years ago, without anything approaching the present-day\r\nhorrible example before them, some farsighted, selfless, tireless\r\nindividuals began to work to set aside areas of outstanding scenic,\r\nscientific, and historical interest so that they would not be engulfed\r\nby humanity. Often against strong opposition, these benefactors\r\nsucceeded in bringing about legislation that bounded many such areas and\r\ndefined laws to protect them. The areas became national parks,\r\nmonuments, and historic sites. And in 1916, the National Park Service,\r\nan agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, was established to\r\nadminister the units of the National Park System.\r\n\r\nToday, other selfless individuals are contributing their time and effort\r\nto bring additional areas into the National Park System before they are\r\nlost forever. For example, Pecos ruins became a National Monument in\r\nlate 1966 (see page 106).\r\n\r\nNot every suggested area possesses the qualities that merit\r\npreservation, qualities of national significance. Proposed areas receive\r\ncareful study before they are recommended for inclusion within the\r\nsystem—recommended to the Congress by the Secretary of the Interior. The\r\nSecretary’s recommendations are based on those received from the\r\nAdvisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings, and\r\nMonuments. This board is composed of eleven private citizens, each of\r\nwhom is competent in one or more of the following fields: history,\r\nnatural history, archeology, architecture, conservation, and recreation.\r\n\r\nDiverse in character, New Mexico’s ten units of the National Park System\r\nare of geologic, scenic, archeological, and historical interest. A visit\r\nto each unit will disclose the qualities that have been judged to be of\r\nnational significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Carlsbad Caverns National Park\r\n\r\nIncomparable Carlsbad Caverns, in southeastern New Mexico, includes a\r\nsingle underground chamber so expansive that its floor could accommodate\r\nfourteen football fields and its ceiling could hold a 22-story building;\r\nother chambers that contain countless cave formations of great variety\r\nof shape and color; cool and naturally circulating fresh air; and a\r\nsystem of lighting that reveals the beauty and spaciousness most\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\nSince the temperature within the Caverns remains at about 56°F the year\r\nround, warm clothing is needed. Comfortable shoes, too, for the\r\nfour-hour, three-mile complete tour, which starts at the natural\r\nentrance. Shorter trips, the Big Room tours that start at the elevators\r\nin the visitor center, take in only a part of the underground chambers.\r\nAll tours are under leadership of competent park guides who answer\r\nquestions and explain the earth processes that have resulted in the\r\ncaverns and their amazing decorations.\r\n\r\nFrom the natural entrance, the immense main corridor of the Caverns is\r\nfollowed downward 829 feet for one and three-quarters miles. This brings\r\nvisitors to the most scenic rooms (the Green Lake Room, King’s Palace,\r\nQueen’s Chamber, and Papoose Room), where the stalactites, stalagmites,\r\nand helictites reach their peak in numbers, shapes, and delicate\r\ncoloring. The trail leads upward 80 feet from the Papoose Room to the\r\nlunchroom. Near the lunchroom is the Big Room, the most majestic of the\r\nCaverns’ chambers. The trail around its perimeter, one and a quarter\r\nmiles long, encompasses a floor space of fourteen acres.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Hall of Giants in Carlsbad Caverns National Park]\r\n\r\nCompleting the circuit of the Big Room and returning to the lunchroom,\r\nvisitors may either walk or board an elevator and ride smoothly back to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nHow were the Caverns formed? The story began about 240 million years\r\nago, during the Permian Period. At that time, the two limestone\r\nformations in which the caverns occur—the Tansill Formation and Capitan\r\nLimestone—were deposited as part of an organic reef complex at the edge\r\nof a warm shallow sea.\r\n\r\nDuring subsequent periods, other seas brought in sedimentary material\r\nthat covered the reef. About 60 million years ago, earth movements,\r\nwhich were responsible for the uplift of the area, fractured the reef\r\nand permitted surrounding ground water to enter along fracture lines and\r\nbegin work in fashioning the caverns. The water at first dissolved small\r\ncrevices in the limestone. As more water came in, the crevices enlarged\r\nto cavities, called solution pockets. Then the walls, floors, and\r\nceilings of the pockets dissolved and collapsed, joining the pockets,\r\nwhile the solution process continued, eventually forming the huge rooms\r\nseen today.\r\n\r\nBeginning about 3 million years ago and into recent times, the uplift of\r\nthe local Guadalupe Mountains and changing climates lowered the water\r\ntable. Water that had been inside the caverns drained away and was\r\nreplaced by air. Most solution stopped, but large sections of partly\r\ndissolved walls and ceilings collapsed under their own weight. Stability\r\nwas finally achieved, however, and probably no rock has fallen within\r\nthe caverns during the last several thousand years.\r\n\r\nEven before the collapsing ended, another phase of cavern development\r\nhad begun. Rain water and snow melt slowly seeped into the caverns.\r\nDroplets of water, each holding a minute quantity of dissolved\r\nlimestone, appeared upon the ceilings. Exposed to the air, the droplets\r\nevaporated and left their mineral content as calcite and\r\naragonite—crystalline forms of limestone. Over centuries, this process\r\nof evaporation and deposition has built a myriad of crystalline\r\nstalactites of all shapes and sizes. Water that dripped to the floor\r\nevaporated and deposited the calcite and aragonite to build stalagmites.\r\nWhen joined together, stalactites and stalagmites become columns, or\r\npillars. In the scenic rooms, conditions existed that brought about the\r\ncreation of helictites—twisted formations that seem to defy gravity in\r\ntheir growth. Color in the cave formations, shades of brown, red, and\r\nyellow, result from the presence of small amounts of iron oxide and\r\nother minerals.\r\n\r\nCarlsbad Caverns National Park offers more than the caverns themselves.\r\nEach evening from April to October, bats in incredible numbers spiral\r\nupward out of the Caverns’ entrance and fly southward over the rim of\r\nthe escarpment to feed in the valleys of the Black and Pecos rivers.\r\nThey return just before dawn, diving swiftly and from high altitudes\r\ninto the entrance. Flying directly to the bat cave, they spend each day\r\nhanging head downward in dense clusters from the walls and ceilings. The\r\nbat cave itself is not open to visitors. A park naturalist explains the\r\nbat flight and discusses the bats in detail in a talk given at the\r\nentrance to the Caverns each evening before the flight begins.\r\n\r\nThe nature trail, a half mile loop that begins and ends near the\r\nentrance to the Caverns, guides the visitor to many of the desert plants\r\nof the region. The park is visited by more than half a million people\r\neach year, and yet the delicate cave formations and the natural beauties\r\nremain unmarred.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     White Sands National Monument\r\n\r\nWhite Sands National Monument, fifteen miles southwest of Alamogordo, is\r\nanother area of great interest to the geologist and biologist. But its\r\nstrangeness, the graceful contours of its snow-white dunes, and the\r\npeculiar adaptations of some of the plants and animals that live among\r\nits dunes are appreciated as fully by the nonscientist. More than\r\n370,000 visitors come to marvel at the White Sands each year.\r\n\r\nThe Monument, some 230 square miles in extent, preserves the most\r\nimpressive part of the world’s largest gypsum desert. This is a\r\nglistening sea of pure gypsum sand that the wind has drifted into huge\r\ndunes that are almost bare of vegetation except along the fringes.\r\nWavelike, the restive dunes move slowly before the prevailing winds,\r\ncovering and uncovering the few plants that lie in their way. And\r\nwavelike, their surfaces trace the vagaries of indecisive breezes in\r\ntiny parallel ripplelike ridges.\r\n\r\nBecause of the almost constant wind and resulting gradual advance of the\r\ndunes, most of the plants that are able to establish themselves in the\r\nopen flats between the dunes eventually become buried. A few species,\r\nhowever, are able to survive the irresistible march of the sand. Through\r\nrapid growth and elongation of the stems, the struggling crowns remain\r\non top of the rising crests of the dunes. Plants with stems more than\r\nforty feet long have been found. As the dunes continue forward under the\r\npressure of the wind, they leave the plants elevated on columns of\r\ncompacted gypsum bound by their adventitious roots.\r\n\r\nAnimals, too, have become adapted to their unusual surroundings. The\r\nsmall creatures, lizards, mice, and others, are picked off easily by\r\nsuch predators as foxes, coyotes, and hawks when they are conspicuous.\r\nThus, through the centuries, only the lighter-colored individuals have\r\nsurvived among the dunes and, through many generations, have developed\r\npale and elusive animals that blend inconspicuously with their white\r\nsurroundings. Pocket mice are a good example of this. Among the white\r\ndunes, the pocket mice are white; in the nearby red hills, they are a\r\nrusty color; and on the beds of black lava a few miles north of the\r\nsand, the pocket mice are very dark.\r\n\r\nA visitor to White Sands National Monument should stop at the visitor\r\ncenter, where exhibits explain the geology of the duneland and others\r\ndescribe the plants and animals that are able to live there.\r\n\r\nBut how and from where did this natural wonder come? The dunes of gypsum\r\nlie in the Tularosa Basin, which stretches for more than 100 miles\r\nbetween two north-south mountain ranges. All sides of the valley slope\r\ngently inward, forming the basin, with Lake Lucero, its lowest point, at\r\nthe southwest end of the Monument. This valley was formed hundreds of\r\ncenturies ago, when a great section of the earth’s crust settled to form\r\nthe type of basin known geologically as a graben.\r\n\r\nHigh above the basin floor, beds of gypsum are found to the north in the\r\nmountain ranges flanking the valley. Similar gypsum beds lie far beneath\r\nthe floor of the basin. Thus, it was once a part of the high plateau, a\r\ngreat blocklike section that slowly sank to form the basin at its\r\npresent level.\r\n\r\nPercolating water from seasonal rains and melting snow carries tons of\r\ngypsum, in solution, from the highlands at the north end of the basin\r\ninto Lake Lucero. During much of the year, cloudless skies and warm dry\r\nwinds evaporate Lake Lucero, and it shrinks to a crystal-encrusted\r\nmarsh. Capillarity draws the gypsum-laden underground water to the\r\nsurface; it, too, evaporates, depositing its burden of gypsum throughout\r\nthe extensive “alkali flats.” The persistent southwest wind picks up the\r\nparticles of gypsum and whirls them away, adding them to the gleaming\r\nwhite dunes, the accumulation of centuries.\r\n\r\nThe best ways to see the dunes are by car and by foot. Along the drive\r\nthat leads into the heart of the duneland are numbered posts that\r\ncorrespond to numbered paragraphs in the Monument’s informational\r\nfolder. These paragraphs explain the features that are of particular\r\nsignificance. At pull-outs along the drive, park the car and walk among\r\nthe dunes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Capulin Mountain National Monument]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Capulin Mountain National Monument\r\n\r\nCapulin Mountain National Monument, in the northeast part of the state,\r\nis an area of geologic interest that presents still another aspect of\r\nthe science of the earth. It contains the cone of an extinct volcano,\r\none of the most symmetrical of the geologically recent cinder cones in\r\nthe United States. Its conical form rises more than 1000 feet above its\r\nbase. The irregular rim is about one mile in circumference, and the\r\ncrater is about 415 feet in depth, as measured from the highest part of\r\nthe rim. Some 40,000 people a year visit the Monument.\r\n\r\nThe mountain consists chiefly of loose cinders, ash, and other rock\r\ndebris of volcanic explosions. These materials were spewed out by a\r\nseries of successive eruptions, probably of considerable duration. The\r\ncoarse materials fell back around the vent, piling up to form the\r\nconical mound. Dust and other fine materials were carried away by the\r\nwind. After the eruptions, vegetation gained a foothold on the steep,\r\nunstable flanks of the cone, so that in time the slopes became\r\nstabilized. Geological studies indicate that the volcano probably was\r\nactive about 7000 years ago.\r\n\r\nCapulin Mountain is of special interest, partly because it represents\r\nthe last stages of a great period of volcanic activity that was\r\nwidespread throughout western North America. Evidences of this older and\r\nmore intense activity can be seen from the top of Capulin Mountain in\r\nthe scores of other nearby volcanic hills and peaks. The largest of\r\nthese is the Sierra Grande, an extinct volcano rising 4000 feet above\r\nthe surrounding plain; it is ten miles to the southeast. Northwest of\r\nCapulin are a number of mesas that are capped with black lava, the\r\nlargest of which are Barella, Raton, and Johnson. Fishers Peak, south of\r\nTrinidad, Colorado, is on a similar mesa. The famous Spanish Peaks,\r\nnorthwest of Trinidad, are a pair of extinct volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIn this great volcanic area, the lava erupted in a succession of flows.\r\nThe series of eruptions were separated by long periods of inactivity.\r\nDuring these inactive times, erosion cut valleys and wore down parts of\r\nthe old lava sheets. This action formed new channels and lower terrain\r\nover which succeeding lava flows spread. This process was repeated at\r\nleast three times. The oldest lavas, which have been exposed by erosion,\r\nare found on the tops of the highest mesas. The last series of eruptions\r\ncreated Capulin Mountain; they were ejections mostly of cinders and ash,\r\nwith less lava flow than in the preceding volcanic activity. These\r\ncinder-and-ash eruptions were so recent, geologically, that some of the\r\nnearby, bare, steep-sided cinder cones appear as if they had just\r\ncooled.\r\n\r\nThe National Park Service has constructed a road up the mountain to the\r\nrim of the crater. And from the parking area at the rim, two trails lead\r\nto the most interesting points on the mountain. One trail, self-guiding,\r\nmakes the complete one-mile circuit of the crater along the rim. A guide\r\nbooklet, keyed to numbered stakes that have been set at places along the\r\ntrail, explains the features of particular significance—both on the\r\nmountain and in the distance. The other trail, less scenic, provides a\r\nrare opportunity to see a volcanic mountain from the inside out, for it\r\nleads down to the bottom of the crater.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: View of Chaco Canyon National Monument]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Chaco Canyon National Monument\r\n\r\nRich in areas of geological interest, New Mexico is equally rich in\r\nareas of archeological interest. Four of these are preserved as units of\r\nthe National Park System.\r\n\r\nChaco Canyon National Monument, in the northwestern part of the state,\r\ncontains more than a dozen large prehistoric ruins and hundreds of\r\nsmaller archeological sites. These ruins are considered to be without\r\nequal north of central Mexico. No other archeological area in the\r\nSouthwest exhibits such a high development of prehistoric Pueblo\r\ncivilization. Most of the sites lie within a strip of land about eight\r\nmiles long and two miles wide, through which Chaco Canyon runs. Although\r\nthe Monument is relatively isolated, it is open year around and is\r\nvisited by about 22,000 people annually.\r\n\r\nThe most imposing and best known of the ruins is Pueblo Bonito. Built\r\nbetween 800 and 900 years ago, this 4- and 5-story village covered more\r\nthan three acres and contained about 800 rooms and 32 kivas, or\r\nceremonial chambers. Archeologist Neil M. Judd, of the National Museum,\r\nwho conducted some of the late excavations, has said that Pueblo Bonito\r\nwas the largest apartment house built anywhere in the world prior to\r\n1887, estimating that at one time it housed 1200 people.\r\n\r\nEarliest of the Chaco sites, small villages of crude pit houses were\r\noccupied during 600 to 800 A.D. Archeologists, studying changes in\r\nmasonry style, pottery types, and other remains, have pieced together\r\nthe development of the culture of the inhabitants of Chaco Canyon over a\r\nperiod of six centuries.\r\n\r\nAfter Chaco Canyon’s cultural high point was reached in the 1100’s, a\r\ngradual decline set in. The population decreased, and in the 1200’s, the\r\nregion was abandoned. During this same century, other Pueblo centers\r\nwithin the San Juan Basin were also deserted.\r\n\r\nVarious theories have been advanced to explain this exodus: soil\r\nerosion, warlike enemies, poor facilities for urban sanitation, drought,\r\nand intervillage warfare. One or a combination of these factors might\r\nhave been instrumental in bringing about the abandonment of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Aztec Ruins National Monument\r\n\r\nAztec Ruins National Monument, at Aztec in the northwestern corner of\r\nthe state, was set aside to preserve an outstanding example of classical\r\nPueblo construction, one of the largest pre-Spanish villages in the\r\nSouthwest. More than 40,000 visitors come to the Monument each year.\r\n\r\nTree-ring dates indicate that most of the big central pueblo was rapidly\r\nconstructed during the period 1106 to 1121. At this time, the people of\r\nAztec were influenced by the cultural center to the south, Chaco Canyon.\r\nDuring the last half of the 1100’s, after the decline of Chaco Canyon\r\nhad begun, the people of Aztec began to look toward the north, and by\r\n1200, Mesa Verde ideas dominated the region. Aztec was abandoned by\r\nabout 1300, as was the rest of the general region.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest at Aztec Ruins National Monument is the\r\nreconstructed Great Kiva. The Pueblo Indians built separate rooms, now\r\nknown as kivas, for ceremonial purposes. During the period of Chaco\r\ninfluence, the people at Aztec constructed a very large circular\r\nbuilding, 48 feet in diameter, in their plaza. Its features differ from\r\nthose of the small kivas and establish it as a Great Kiva, similar to\r\nthose at Chaco. The Great Kivas represent the peak of religious\r\narchitecture among the Pueblos. The Great Kiva at Aztec was completely\r\nrestored in 1934 by Earl H. Morris, of the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Bandelier National Monument\r\n\r\nBandelier National Monument, forty-six miles west of Santa Fe, preserves\r\nthe ruins of dwellings and other structures that were erected by Indians\r\nwho lived in the area until about 1550 A.D. Almost 100,000 people visit\r\nthe Monument each year.\r\n\r\nWhen many of the ancient Pueblo Indian centers were abandoned in the\r\nlate thirteenth century, the people moved to locations where the water\r\nsupply was more constant. A favorable area was the upper Rio Grande\r\nValley in what is now New Mexico. One of the later flowerings of Pueblo\r\nculture occurred here. The ruins within Bandelier are representative of\r\nthis phase of Pueblo development.\r\n\r\nIn Frijoles Canyon, the Indians chose the location of their homes well.\r\nThe creek that runs through the canyon flows all year. On the canyon\r\nfloor and mesa top there was land suitable to the cultivation of crops.\r\nAnd the canyon walls of soft tuff (consolidated volcanic ash) could\r\neasily be hollowed out by the Indians with their harder stone tools in\r\nfashioning storage rooms behind dwellings built against the cliff.\r\n\r\nCliff ruins, or talus villages, extend along the base of the northern\r\nwall of the canyon for about two miles. Other ruins are located on the\r\nfloor of the canyon. The houses of stone masonry were irregularly\r\nterraced, from one to three stories in height. Some hollowed recesses at\r\nthe base of the cliff also were used for dwelling rooms.\r\n\r\nLike the other pueblo dwellers, the Frijoles inhabitants were farmers,\r\nraising the usual corn, beans, and squash. They used cotton cloth, which\r\nhas been found in the ruins and which suggests that they had the loom.\r\nSince the growing season in the high Frijoles country is short, they\r\nprobably obtained their cotton by trade with Indians who lived farther\r\nsouth. They made pottery decorated with glaze paint.\r\n\r\nFor a few centuries, the Indian farmers lived in the canyons, built\r\nvillages, honeycombed the cliffs with artificial caves, and tilled the\r\nsoil. But with the passing years, drought, soil-eroding floods, soil\r\ndepletion, famine, and possibly disease—singly or in combination—forced\r\nthe canyon dwellers again to seek new homes. Descendants of these\r\nIndians still live in nearby modern pueblos along the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cliff houses in Frijoles Canyon, Bandelier National\r\n    Monument]\r\n\r\nAbout ninety per cent of Bandelier National Monument is, and will\r\nremain, a wilderness. The rugged and scenic back country is accessible\r\nby about sixty miles of maintained trails, leading to such features as\r\nAlamo Canyon, the Stone Lions, Painted Cave, the Pueblo ruins of San\r\nMiguel and Yapashi, and White Rock Canyon of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Valle Grande\r\n\r\nAnother area has been considered as an addition to the National Park\r\nSystem in New Mexico. A 1963 bill introduced in Congress would establish\r\nValle Grande-Bandelier National Park, about forty-six miles west of\r\nSanta Fe. Valle Grande is part of the Valle Caldera, which is among the\r\nworld’s largest and has been the site of extensive studies of calderas\r\n(the collapsed summits of volcanoes). Lessons learned there have been\r\napplied in recognizing and investigating calderas in other places.\r\nBandelier National Monument, primarily of archeological significance,\r\nlies to the east of the canyon-cut rim of the caldera. As written, the\r\nbill would have incorporated the Monument in the proposed national park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Part of Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument\r\n\r\nGila Cliff Dwellings National Monument, forty-seven miles north of\r\nSilver City and at the edge of the Gila Wilderness Area, contains a\r\nseries of ruins that portray the development of the agricultural Indians\r\nwho lived south of the Mogollon Mountains. Specifically, the ruins\r\nrepresent a branch of the generalized culture known as Mogollon.\r\nAlthough part of the road to the Monument was paved in 1963, the last\r\nfour-mile stretch is still primitive and should not be attempted in an\r\nordinary passenger car except during the summer and in dry weather. In\r\nspite of the difficult road, more than 23,000 people visited the\r\nMonument during 1965. The last four miles of the road have been recently\r\npaved.\r\n\r\nThe earliest ruin yet found within the Monument is a Mogollon pit house\r\nof a type that was made about 500 A.D. It is roundish and, on the east\r\nside, has a narrow ramplike entrance some two feet wide and ten feet\r\nlong. The people of this period did only a little farming (corn and\r\nbeans), a little hunting, and gathered much uncultivated plant food.\r\nThey made a fairly good plain-brown pottery and undoubtedly were skilled\r\nin a number of crafts whose products have since disappeared. Such things\r\nas nets and snares, baskets, and wooden tools last but a short time in\r\nopen sites.\r\n\r\nOther, later, pit house types may be seen in the Monument. Pit houses\r\nwere prevalent in the area until about 1000 A.D., when influences from\r\nthe Anasazi (Pueblo) Indians of the northern part of the Southwest began\r\nto affect the Mogollon people.\r\n\r\nSquare houses, built above the ground, became the style; some were of\r\nmasonry, some of adobe construction, and some were built of wattle\r\n(wooden rods and twigs). A new type of pottery was also introduced at\r\nabout the same time: white with black designs.\r\n\r\nThe principal ruins in the Monument are the cliff dwellings, which were\r\nbuilt during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They, too, reflect\r\nthe northern pueblo influence. About forty rooms, remarkably well\r\npreserved, are fitted into a series of chambers, or caves, in a low\r\ncliff of Gila Conglomerate. By about the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the area was abandoned by the farming Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Gran Quivira National Monument\r\n\r\nSignificant chapters in the absorbing history of New Mexico were written\r\nat three sites that have been made units of the National Park System.\r\n\r\nGran Quivira National Monument, near the center of the state southeast\r\nof Mountainair, preserves the ruins of a frontier Spanish mission that\r\nhad been built, used, and abandoned by 1675. The Monument contains\r\ntwenty-one ruined house mounds of Indian pueblos and ruins of two\r\nmission churches. It was the presence of the Indians at this location,\r\nof course, that attracted the Franciscan missionaries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A look at ruins of Gran Quivira]\r\n\r\nThe earliest Indian pueblo in the Monument was founded about 1300 A.D.;\r\nby the 1600’s, the village, with several structures, had become the\r\nlargest in the region. It was conveniently located on the south side of\r\na hill near the cultivated fields in the surrounding lowlands. Water was\r\na problem then as now. The Indians solved this as best they could by\r\ndigging shallow wells at the base of the hill, about one mile west of\r\nthe pueblo.\r\n\r\nThe first known specific reference to Gran Quivira was made in 1630 by\r\nFray Alonso de Benavides, a Franciscan missionary. He called the pueblo\r\nthe “Village of the Humanas,” and referred to the church there as having\r\nbeen built by Father Francisco Letrado in 1629 and dedicated to San\r\nIsidro. Humanas, now misnamed “Gran Quivira,” was later administered\r\nfrom the mission of San Gregorio de Abo, some forty miles to the north.\r\nIn 1659, Father Diego de Santander was assigned to Humanas. Construction\r\nof the mission buildings, which he rededicated to San Buenaventura, was\r\ncompleted by him.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans had a pronounced influence upon the Pueblo Indians. They\r\nstimulated trade with Mexico and the pueblos farther north. They\r\nimported wine grapes and cultivated them, and they introduced\r\ndomesticated sheep, goats, cattle, and horses.\r\n\r\nSometime between 1672 and 1675, the pueblo and mission at Humanas were\r\nabandoned because of Apache raids, drought, and crop failures. The\r\npeople first moved to the Rio Grande near the present town of Socorro. A\r\nfew continued to El Paso del Norte, where, in 1680, they were joined by\r\nthose from Socorro, who had fled with the Spaniards from the Pueblo\r\nRevolt of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       El Morro National Monument\r\n\r\nEl Morro National Monument, southwest of Grants near Ramah, was\r\nestablished to preserve the famous Inscription Rock, register of\r\nIndians, Spaniards, and westward-moving pioneers. About 22,000 people\r\nnow visit the Monument each year.\r\n\r\nEl Morro, or Inscription Rock, is a massive mesa point of sandstone.\r\nRising some 200 feet above the valley floor, it forms a striking\r\nlandmark. From its summit, rain and melted snow drain into a natural\r\nbasin at the foot of the cliff, creating a constant and dependable\r\nsupply of water in a region where water is scarce. The route from Acoma\r\nto the Zuni pueblos led directly past the mesa. It was a regular camping\r\nplace for Spanish _conquistadores_ and, later, for travelers from the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nOn the top of El Morro lie ruins of Indian pueblos, abandoned long\r\nbefore the coming of the Spaniards. And carved in the sandstone are\r\nnumerous petroglyphs left by these ancient people, ancestors of the\r\nmodern Zunis. Perhaps it was the petroglyphs that prompted later\r\ntravelers to record their names and thoughts on the rock.\r\n\r\nThe first known historical mention of El Morro is found in the journal\r\nof Diego Pérez de Luxán, chronicler of the Espejo Expedition of 1583.\r\nLuxán stopped there for water on March 11 of that year.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Part of the pool and cliff at El Morro]\r\n\r\nThe oldest dated inscription at El Morro was made in 1605 by don Juan de\r\nOñate, first governor of New Mexico. Returning from an expedition to the\r\nmouth of the Colorado River, he camped at El Morro and carved this\r\ninscription in Spanish: “Passed by here the Adelantado Don Juan de Oñate\r\nfrom the discovery of the Sea of the South, the 16th of April of 1605.”\r\nThe “Sea of the South” was the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nIf don Diego de Vargas, the most famous Spanish governor of New Mexico,\r\nseems boastful in the message he left at El Morro, who can blame him?\r\nHis words, in English, read, “Here was the General Don Diego de Vargas,\r\nwho conquered for our Holy Faith and for the Royal Crown all of New\r\nMexico at his own expense, year of 1692.” Twelve years earlier, the\r\ngreat Pueblo Indian Revolt had driven the Spaniards from New Mexico.\r\nMore than 400, including 23 priests, had lost their lives, and the\r\nsurviving Spaniards, some 1100, had fled to El Paso del Norte. De Vargas\r\nrestored order, without further bloodshed, in 1692.\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation of Santa Fe by the army of Gen. Stephen W. Kearny\r\nin August 1846, details of United States troops were dispatched to\r\nexplore various parts of New Mexico. Probably the first to visit El\r\nMorro was Lt. J. H. Simpson, accompanied by the artist R. H. Kern, who\r\ncopied some of the early inscriptions in September 1849. Then the names\r\nof other soldiers, traders, Indian agents, surveyors, emigrants who were\r\ntraveling westward, and settlers were added to the rock.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the Monument by Presidential proclamation in\r\n1906, inscribing on the face of the cliff has been prohibited. If the\r\nMonument had not been established and the law not passed, this\r\nfascinating part of the history of the Southwest would surely have been\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Fort Union National Monument\r\n\r\nFort Union National Monument, twenty-six miles northeast of Las Vegas\r\nand on the route of the old Santa Fe Trail where the mountains meet the\r\nplains, preserves the ruins of a famous frontier Army post. As a base of\r\noperations for military and civilian ventures in New Mexico from 1851 to\r\n1891, Fort Union helped to direct the course of events in the formative\r\nyears of the Southwest. More than 11,000 visitors come to the Monument\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nFive years after the conquest of New Mexico by the United States in the\r\nwar with Mexico, Col. E. V. Sumner moved some of his troops from Fort\r\nMarcy, in Santa Fe, to the site of Fort Union and there began\r\nconstruction of log buildings on the west side of Coyote Creek. This was\r\nthe first Fort Union.\r\n\r\nThe first post took an active part in protecting settlers and traders\r\nfrom Indian raids during the 1850’s. Mounted patrols of dragoons made\r\nmany expeditions into the mountains against the warring Apaches and Utes\r\nand out onto the plains to pursue Comanche war parties.\r\n\r\nFort Union was also charged with supply and support of many outlying\r\nmilitary posts, such as Fort Defiance and Fort Craig. The Quartermaster\r\nDepot at Fort Union in later years came to be the hub of all Army supply\r\nservices in the Southwest.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three decades of its life, Fort Union saw the great\r\nConestoga wagons and prairie schooners of the Santa Fe Trail caravans\r\npass in increasing numbers. By the outbreak of the Civil War,\r\nenterprising traders were hauling more than ten million dollars’ worth\r\nof goods from Missouri each year. The fort provided escorts for caravans\r\nand when requested by apprehensive company or postal officials, escorts\r\nfor stage-coaches of the Independence-Santa Fe Mail. Century-old tracks\r\nof the Santa Fe Trail can be still seen near Fort Union.\r\n\r\nThe start of the Civil War in 1861 brought new activity to the fort.\r\nImmediate invasion of New Mexico by Confederate forces from Texas was\r\nexpected. Gen. E. R. S. Canby, commanding Union troops in the territory,\r\nbegan construction of an earthwork fortification in a defensive position\r\nabout a mile from the original fort. The ditches, parapets, and\r\nbomb-proofs of this redoubt were completed late in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Texas column was not slow in coming. By March 1862, these invaders\r\nunder Gen. Henry H. Sibley had defeated a Union force at Val Verde, had\r\nfrightened the defenders from Albuquerque and Santa Fe into inaction,\r\nand were marching eastward across the mountains toward the final\r\nstronghold, Fort Union. On March 10, the First Regiment of Colorado\r\nVolunteers, under Col. J. P. Slough, arrived at Fort Union as\r\nreinforcements. And on March 22, Colonel Slough led his 1342 men out of\r\nthe fort to meet the advancing Confederates. In a two-day battle fought\r\nin Apache Canyon and Glorieta Pass, the Union forces defeated the\r\nConfederates, thus saving Fort Union for the federal cause.\r\n\r\nFrom 1863 to 1869, the garrisons at Fort Union were chiefly occupied in\r\na construction program that produced most of the adobe-walled buildings\r\nwhose ruins may now be seen. Fort Union then returned to its earlier\r\nmission of a base for Indian fighting.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of Fort Union was reduced with the final submission of\r\nthe Indians and with the arrival of the railhead at Las Vegas in 1879.\r\nThe huge fort was demoted to caretaker status in the 1880’s and was\r\nabandoned in 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt each of these New Mexico units of the National Park System, as at\r\nother units throughout the nation, trained personnel of the National\r\nPark Service—archeologists, historians, naturalists, and park\r\nrangers—are on duty. Their purpose is to make the visitor’s trip\r\nrewarding. This they do through museum exhibits, guided walks and\r\nself-guiding trails, campfire talks, and publications.\r\n\r\nHere in New Mexico, then, escape the irritations that seem to go with\r\nprogress. Awaiting the traveler are unspoiled places where he can\r\nsurround himself with the quiet majesty of nature, walk the paths made\r\nby prehistoric people, camp where the Spanish _conquistadores_ camped,\r\nstroll among the ruins of buildings erected by the men who helped to\r\nfashion the Southwest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST LANDS ABOVE THE DESERT\r\n\r\n                         by Ruth Bush Jones[3]\r\n\r\nToday, as in earlier times, people of New Mexico look to their mountains\r\nwith a new and greater appreciation of their forest land heritage.\r\nToday, also, people seek aesthetic values of peace, beauty, and serenity\r\nfound in nature’s solitudes, in addition to forest products for economic\r\nuse. Basic to the enjoyment of the high country are the forest treasures\r\nof clear, pure water ... of wild game and birds ... of trees for shade\r\nand solitude, fuel, shelter, and forest products ... of grass and browse\r\nfor cattle, sheep, horses, and wildlife ... of magnificent grandeur and\r\npanoramic vistas. These basic treasures coupled with understanding of\r\nthe purposes and many benefits of the National Forests bring true\r\nrecreation to the visitor.\r\n\r\nThe high country of New Mexico, much of it in the National Forests, is\r\nentrusted by law to the care and administration of the U.S. Forest\r\nService, an agency of the Department of Agriculture. These vast public\r\nproperties located in several sections of the state are administered as\r\nCarson, Santa Fe, Cibola, Lincoln, Gila, Apache, and Coronado National\r\nForests, the latter two lying primarily in Arizona and being directed\r\nfrom there rather than from New Mexico. Visitors to New Mexico traveling\r\nalong main highways see the high forest country outlining the horizon\r\nand often regard the lofty masses of rugged rock as unapproachable and\r\nlacking in friendliness.\r\n\r\n“Not so,” says the Forest Ranger. There are broad highways welcoming the\r\ntraveler into the high country where forest trees stretch to the sky.\r\nThere are cool invigorating streams sparkling clear and clean from\r\nmountain fastnesses and developed campgrounds and picnic areas ready for\r\nuse. Outdoor recreation from simple relaxing and picnicking under a pine\r\ntree to the most strenuous of wilderness backpacking or horseback\r\nriding, winter sports, and skiing awaits the visitor. There is fishing\r\nin mountain streams and in big open lakes or in precious, secluded\r\nmountain lakes. And for those who like their surroundings interpreted\r\nfor them, there are nature trails and/or forest naturalists to explain\r\nlocal rock formations, vegetation, and the natural and human history of\r\nthe immediate country.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Ranger asks only that each visitor do his share in cleaning\r\nup a camp or picnic site and being _sure_ that camp fires, matches, and\r\ncigarettes are thoroughly extinguished: “Keep Your National Forest Green\r\nand Clean!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Carson National Forest\r\n\r\nLocated in north-central New Mexico, with headquarters at Taos, the\r\nCarson National Forest nurtures and cradles the Rio Grande as it leaves\r\nits birthplace in Colorado en route to the south. Carrying water from\r\nhigh country snow melt, the Carson adds precious, clear water from its\r\nhigh mountain streams and lakes to the Rio Grande in support of the\r\nprosperous communities along its way. The Carson includes some of the\r\nhighest water-producing lands in the state and is the source of several\r\npermanent streams and lakes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Map of National Forests in New Mexico]\r\n\r\nNamed in honor of Kit Carson, the noted scout, Carson National Forest\r\noffers some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the Southwest,\r\nincluding the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Red River Canyon, and Wheeler\r\nPeak, which at 13,160 feet is the highest point in New Mexico. Part of\r\nthe famed Pecos Wilderness Area and the Wheeler Peak Wild Area are\r\nincluded in this Forest and are available to those willing and able to\r\nhike, ride a horse, or pack into the rugged mountain country. For the\r\nwinter sports enthusiast, the Red River Ski Area, Sipapu Winter Sports\r\nArea, and Taos Ski Valley operate in part within the Carson National\r\nForest and offer some of the finest alpine skiing in the Southwest.\r\n\r\nGood roads lead the visitor to Spanish and Indian villages where life\r\nand culture are almost unchanged since the ancient and comparatively\r\nrecent days of settlement. Towns with singing-sounding names like\r\nPicurís, Taos Pueblo, Las Trampas, Truchas, Santa Barbara, and Tres\r\nRitos nestle along forest streams and add charm and beauty to a scenic\r\ntrip in the northern Sangre de Cristo range (name given to the mountains\r\nby early Spanish settlers, meaning _Blood of Christ_. The analogy\r\nrelates to the reddish glow that sometimes colors the mountains at\r\nsunset.). Radiating from Taos are roads leading into the eastern half of\r\nthe Forest, bringing the traveler into fascinating and colorful country.\r\nTaos Canyon, Arroyo Hondo, Questa, and the Red River country abound in\r\nold mining ghost towns, Indian ruins, and legendary Spanish villages\r\nlocated in canyons and on mountain tops.\r\n\r\nThe high range rising between the Rio Grande and the Chama River to the\r\nwest is the major part of the western half of the Carson National\r\nForest. Tres Piedras, El Rito, La Madera, Canjilon, Lagunitas, and San\r\nAntonio are a few of the picturesque communities here. Farther to the\r\nwest is the Jicarilla Division of the Carson, the high mountain country\r\nadjacent to the Jicarilla Apache Reservation. Bisected by State Highway\r\n17 between Farmington and Chama, this section is a test of true\r\npioneering skill for the traveler who is willing to follow dim tracks of\r\nroads and trails to enjoy the Forest. However, modern civilization is\r\nintroduced by the 150 oil and gas wells in this area, even though the\r\ncountry is rugged and broken.\r\n\r\nCarson National Forest is a trout fisherman’s delight. For the hunter,\r\nRocky Mountain mule deer, elk, and antelope are found in all parts of\r\nthe Forest. Small game is plentiful, and rabbits provide many hours of\r\nhunting pleasure. Beaver, muskrat, mink, weasel, marten, and skunk are\r\nthe principal fur bearers, and turkey, grouse, ducks, geese, quail, and\r\ndoves make up the game bird population. Predators include the mountain\r\nlion, bobcat, coyote, and fox.\r\n\r\nMore than 40 developed camp and picnic grounds, most of which are\r\naccessible year round, welcome the visitor. Among them, Echo\r\nAmphitheater picnic ground on U.S. Highway 84, south of Canjilon, is a\r\nstriking natural echo chamber formed by centuries of wind and water\r\nerosion in the rugged sandstone rock. “If you stand near the chamber,\r\nyou only have to whisper, and your words come back in a spooky echo.”\r\n\r\nAbout five miles south on U.S. Highway 84 is the Ghost Ranch Museum,\r\nwith live native Southwestern animals and conservation exhibits,\r\nincluding a living and growing display showing on-the-ground Forest\r\nService Multiple Use Management of the mythical Beaver National Forest,\r\nthe “smallest National Forest in the world.”\r\n\r\nRanger stations at Canjilon, El Rito, Gobernador, Penasco, Questa, Taos,\r\nand Tres Piedras provide local information and recreation maps.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Echo Amphitheater surrounds part of the trail to\r\n    campground]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Santa Fe National Forest\r\n\r\nThe Santa Fe National Forest, with headquarters in Santa Fe, lies\r\ndirectly south of the Carson National Forest on both sides of the Rio\r\nGrande and is the center of a region rich in natural resources as well\r\nas historic and geologic interests. The two divisions of the Forest\r\ncontain the high mountains to the east and west in the central section\r\nof the state. The Pecos Division to the east of the Rio Grande is the\r\nlocation of the major part of the Pecos Wilderness Area, one of the\r\nearliest of such areas to be established.\r\n\r\nThe Pecos Division is so named because the Pecos River, which later\r\njoins the Rio Grande in Texas, heads among its towering mountains in a\r\nbeautiful alpine basin sometimes called the _Pecos Horseshoe_. The Pecos\r\nRiver is one of the state’s largest streams and supplies some of its\r\nmost important irrigation projects. This division of the Forest includes\r\nthe southern part of the Sangre de Cristo range and was first known as\r\nthe Pecos River Forest Reserve, established in 1892—the oldest National\r\nForest in the Southwest. The division abounds in clear, cold mountain\r\nlakes and streams. Truchas Lakes, Pecos Baldy, Stewart Lake, Spirit\r\nLake, and Lost Lake, as well as many mountain streams, lure not only the\r\nfisherman but the hiker and camper to their wilderness beauty.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three developed campgrounds and picnic areas located in cool\r\nglades are ready for the visitor along roads leading into the Forest\r\nfrom Santa Fe, Pecos, Glorieta, Las Vegas, and other communities. Skiing\r\nand winter sports are available at the Santa Fe Ski Basin northeast of\r\nSanta Fe; the chair lift operates year around for those who wish merely\r\nto view the spectacular scenery. The Pecos Division watersheds of the\r\nSanta Fe National Forest, like the eastern section of the Carson,\r\ncontribute generously to the water flow of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nWild game, game birds, and fishing attract visitors at all times of the\r\nyear, while the golden hues of the aspen in the autumn tempt artists and\r\nphotographers to record on canvas and film nature’s fall colors. A trip\r\njust before the winter snows to the aspen country of the Santa Fe\r\nNational Forest is a must. Ranger stations are located at Santa Fe, Las\r\nVegas, and Pecos.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: An Izaak Walton along the Pecos river]\r\n\r\nWest of the Rio Grande are the Jemez Mountains, which form the Jemez\r\nDivision of the Santa Fe National Forest. The Jemez country is a\r\nfavorite area for fishermen and hunters. For the sturdy hiker and\r\npicnicker, there are hundreds of fascinating points to visit and peaks\r\nto climb. Capulin Peak, Dead Man’s Peak, Nacimiento Peak, and Cerro\r\nPedernal are a few of the exciting ones. The Jemez country contains the\r\nSan Pedro Parks Wild Area, northeast of Cuba where San Gregorio Lake is\r\nwaiting for the fisherman or hiker willing to walk or ride horseback.\r\nThis section abounds in unique geologic formations—Battleship Rock, Tent\r\nRocks, Teakettle Rock, to name a few.\r\n\r\nEighteen developed camping and picnicking areas welcome the visitor to\r\nthe Jemez Division. Youth groups also favor the Jemez for their summer\r\ncamping. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, YMCA, and others have\r\ncamps adjacent to the Santa Fe National Forest. Timber production,\r\nwildlife habitat management, livestock grazing, and watershed protection\r\nare among the activities of the Jemez Division, while visitors and\r\ntravelers enjoy the forest, the streams, and the unique scenery. Ranger\r\nstations are at Jemez Springs, Cuba, Espanola, and Coyote.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Cibola National Forest\r\n\r\nA mountain playground for people who live or visit near U.S. Highway 66\r\nis Cibola National Forest, with headquarters in Albuquerque. Embracing\r\nthe Sandias, Manzanos, and Gallinas Peak areas east of the Rio Grande in\r\ncentral New Mexico, this Forest also includes most of the mountain\r\nranges in the west-central section of the state, the San Mateo\r\nMountains, with 11,389-foot Mount Taylor, and the Datil, Magdalena, and\r\nZuni ranges.\r\n\r\nOutdoor recreation is the fastest growing use of the Cibola National\r\nForest and more than a million visits are made each year to this popular\r\nForest. The name is a Zuni Indian word, pronounced SEE-bo-lah, meaning\r\n_buffalo_. Buffalo may have roamed the Cibola in years past, but today’s\r\nbig game animals making the Cibola their home are the Rocky Mountain\r\nbighorn sheep, Rocky Mountain mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk,\r\nantelope, and bear. Game birds include turkey, grouse, quail, and dove;\r\nspring and fall migrations of ducks and geese use the Cibola as a\r\nresting place. There are 18 campgrounds with 249 family units and 14\r\npicnic grounds with 382 family units scattered through the vast domain\r\nof the Cibola National Forest.\r\n\r\nSandia Crest in the Sandia Mountains east of Albuquerque is a goal for\r\nmany travelers. Here on this 10,678-foot mountain top, there is a\r\nbreathtaking view of the middle Rio Grande Valley and the Estancia\r\nValley—a jet age view of nearly 10,000 square miles. The visitor stands\r\non rocks which in eons past were under the sea, as indicated by fossils\r\nfound on the peak. Recent recreation developments have been made at the\r\nSandia Ski Area where a new 7450-foot double chair lift will carry 700\r\nriders an hour on a 1650-foot vertical rise to the restaurant and upper\r\nterminal on Sandia Crest. A tramway ascends the west face of the Sandias\r\nto meet the Ski Area chair lift at the Crest.\r\n\r\nThe fabled Manzano Mountains rising above the plains to the west of\r\nState Highway 10 and south of U.S. Highway 66 are fast becoming a haven\r\nfor the camper, picnicker, or sightseer willing to follow secondary\r\nroads to find the perfect spot to enjoy the forest. Capillo Peak, 9368\r\nfeet high, Mosca Peak, Cerro Blanco, and Manzano Peak lure the mountain\r\nclimber. Legends surrounding the old Spanish communities of Tajique,\r\nTorreon, and Manzano are exciting campfire stories after a day spent\r\nexploring the high country.\r\n\r\nWest of the Rio Grande, the San Mateo Mountains north of Grants and the\r\nZuni Mountains forming the backbone of the Continental Divide southeast\r\nof Gallup can be a new experience in outdoor recreation. McGaffey Lake\r\nrecreation area, not too far from the route of the _conquistadore_ Juan\r\nde Oñate, is a cool retreat after crossing the desert and lava flow.\r\n\r\nWest of Socorro on U.S. Highway 60, with Magdalena as headquarters, the\r\nhigh Datil, Gallinas, and Magdalena mountains and another San Mateo\r\nrange rise above the San Agustin Plains, an ancient lake bed. Mt.\r\nWithington and Mt. Baldy, 10,787 feet high, dominate the landscape. Good\r\nroads and developed campgrounds are available. Hunting for wild game as\r\nwell as for unusual gem stones and geologic finds are favored activities\r\nin this western section of the Cibola. District ranger stations are at\r\nGrants, Gallup, Magdalena, Mountainair, and Tijeras.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Lincoln National Forest\r\n\r\nNamed for the great president, the Lincoln National Forest, with\r\nheadquarters at Alamogordo, has characteristics distinguishing it from\r\nall other National Forests in the state. The high mountains and canyons\r\nof the Sacramento, Guadalupe, Capitan, and White mountains, rising\r\nbetween the Tularosa and Pecos basins, were the backdrop and often the\r\nprize of the Indian and cattle wars. Stories and legends of early day\r\nhappenings in the Tularosa Basin, mining operations, battles between\r\nrival cattle ranchers, large timber operations providing lumber, poles,\r\nmine props, and railroad ties are warp and woof of the Lincoln country.\r\nThis Forest includes the high mountains north and south of the Mescalero\r\nApache Indian Reservation.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade, the Lincoln National Forest gained new fame as\r\nthe birthplace of the world-renowned Smokey the Bear, symbol of forest\r\nfire prevention. In the Capitan Mountains, travelers like to visit\r\nSmokey’s birthplace near Capitan Pass, and in the community of Capitan\r\non U.S. Highway 380 is a log museum which features the activities of the\r\nbear cub found near there during a disastrous fire.\r\n\r\nFor the outdoor enthusiast, the Forest offers superb beauty, graceful\r\nand majestic snow-covered peaks, and the peace and serenity of a forest\r\nsanctuary. Each year, thousands of visitors from the plains seek its\r\ncool refuge from desert heat in summer and its readily accessible sports\r\narea in the winter. Ten campgrounds with many picnicking and camping\r\nsites are provided. Canyons, mountains, and streams in many instances\r\nfeature anglicized names—Big Dog Canyon, Mule Peak, Bug Scuffle\r\nHill—though the influence of the early Spanish settler still remains in\r\nnames such as Sacramento, Agua Chiquita, Ruidoso, and Rio Penasco.\r\n\r\nLincoln National Forest abounds in points of interest; Monjeau Lookout\r\noverlooks the headwaters of the Bonito, Eagle, and Ruidoso creeks as\r\nwell as the tall slopes of Sierra Blanca to the southwest. Sierra\r\nBlanca, 12,003 feet high, is the most southerly mountain of that\r\nelevation in the continental United States. Just north of the peak is\r\nthe Sierra Blanca Recreation Area, with one of the finest and\r\nbest-equipped skiing facilities in the country. The restaurant and\r\ngondola lift operate during summer months, and from Lookout Mountain\r\nobservation site, near the gondola’s upper terminal, the traveler can\r\nview White Sands, the Malpais (lava flow), and the 28,000-acre White\r\nMountain Wild Area.\r\n\r\nHunters find deer of three distinct types in this Forest—the Rocky\r\nMountain mule deer, the desert mule deer, and the Texas white-tailed\r\ndeer—and, of course, black bear from which family Smokey the Bear came.\r\nGame birds like wild turkey, quail, and chukkar partridge challenge the\r\nhunter. Fishing the Lincoln’s lakes and streams is a recurring delight\r\nto the angler. Aspens and oaks flaunt their brilliant autumn coloring\r\nagainst the warm green of pines and spruces, heralding the advent of\r\nwinter snows and provoking numerous aspencades for those who wish a\r\nshare in this ever new pageant of nature’s beauty.\r\n\r\nLike all the National Forests, the Lincoln is managed for the production\r\nand wise use of water, timber, and forage for livestock and wildlife and\r\noutdoor recreation. District ranger stations are at Cloudcroft,\r\nCarlsbad, Mayhill, Ruidoso, Sacramento, and Capitan.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “_Anybody for a run?_” at Sierra Blanca ski area]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Gila National Forest\r\n\r\nThe Gila National Forest, with headquarters in Silver City, is a big,\r\nwild, wonderful country in the southwestern section of the state. It has\r\nbeen scarcely affected by the hustle and bustle of modern living. Within\r\nits boundaries are 2.7 million acres of public-owned forest and range\r\nland, with almost a quarter of it devoted to wilderness and primitive\r\nareas. It includes the famous Gila Wilderness, the first such area set\r\naside in the United States and the largest in the Southwest. Most of the\r\nGila National Forest is north of Silver City, though part of it lies in\r\nthe high country between Silver City and Lordsburg.\r\n\r\nThe Gila is an exciting and exhilarating place to explore, sightsee,\r\nhunt, fish, and just enjoy. Indian ruins are evident almost everywhere,\r\nbut the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument, adjacent to the Gila\r\nPrimitive Area, is the best preserved. Ancient tree stumps and abandoned\r\nIndian ruins record the history of man; old mine dumps contain ores and\r\nminerals not known nor appreciated in the heyday of local mining;\r\nmicroscopic plants and forest grasses which may hold the key to man’s\r\nfuture health abound; and the traveler may experience great delight in\r\nfinding a dried root or branch to add to a native rock garden; the\r\nmajestic peaks, deer and other wild game, and cool, splashing waters of\r\na mountain creek delight the camera hobbyist.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful and spectacular box canyons in the Southwest\r\nis on Whitewater Creek about four miles northeast of Glenwood. A catwalk\r\nbuilt against the rock walls of the canyon enables the traveler to\r\nthrill at the unusual beauty and colors of the canyon and the cool\r\ndepths of the trout stream below (_see_ Frontispiece).\r\n\r\nGood roads lead into the Gila National Forest at Reserve and Alma from\r\nU.S. Highway 260. An enjoyable loop trip which touches the Gila\r\nWilderness at Willow Creek can be taken on State Highway 78 from Alma.\r\nAnother beautiful trip is through the Black Range from the junction of\r\nState Highway 180 and U.S. Highway 85 to Silver City. Approach to the\r\nGila from the north can be made through Beaverhead, Apache Creek, and\r\nReserve, where good roads lead into the Forest.\r\n\r\nFifteen developed recreation areas provide camping and picnicking for\r\nthe hiker, horseback rider, and motorist and are complete with\r\nfireplaces, tables, and benches. Elk, deer, antelope, bear, javelina,\r\nand game birds are plentiful, and fishing in the high mountain creeks is\r\nusually rewarded with a satisfying catch.\r\n\r\nDistrict ranger stations are at Magdalena, Truth or Consequences,\r\nReserve, Glenwood, and Mimbres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Apache and Coronado Forests\r\n\r\nAlthough small parts of these forests lie in New Mexico, they belong to\r\nforests in Arizona. Apache National Forest touches the northern edge of\r\nthe Gila and its attractions are much like those of the latter. The\r\nCoronado National Forest, which is in the extreme southwest corner of\r\nNew Mexico, lies in an area of aridity and is difficult to reach from\r\nNew Mexico. It is surrounded by Sonoran desert, at least in its\r\nenvironment in this state.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Gila Hunters with Happy Thanksgiving (_wild\r\n    turkeys_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese far-flung public lands in New Mexico provide many resources\r\nbesides varied kinds of outdoor recreation: timber for industry, water\r\nfor city and farm, forage for livestock and wildlife. As long as our\r\nNational Forests are protected and developed—used but not abused—they\r\nwill continue to yield rich harvests, both tangible and intangible,\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Lake Roberts\r\n    This 70-acre lake thirty miles northeast of Silver City on State\r\n    Highway 25 lies in the Gila National Forest.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The State Also Preserves[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nState Monuments have been established to preserve some of New Mexico’s\r\nhistoric and archeologic sites of importance. These include the mission\r\nruins of Abo, Quarai, Pecos, and Jemez, the Palace of the Governors in\r\nSanta Fe, pueblo ruins at Coronado State Monument, the old Lincoln\r\nCounty Courthouse, the archeologic site at Folsom Man State Monument,\r\nthe plaza and nearby Mexican Colonial-style buildings in La Mesilla, and\r\nFort Selden. The history recorded at these sites dates from 10,000 B.C.\r\nof Clovis Man to 1878 of the cattlemen’s Lincoln County War.\r\n\r\nState parks cover areas of scenic beauty, geologic wonders, and historic\r\ninterest. Reservoir lakes yielding necessary water, good fishing,\r\nswimming, and boating include Conchas, Storrie, Bluewater, El Vado, Ute,\r\nElephant Butte, Caballo, Alamogordo, Clayton, Morphy, and Bottomless\r\nLakes. The latter are natural sink holes east of Roswell. Hyde Memorial\r\nPark and Santa Fe River Park, near and in Santa Fe, provide scenic\r\npicnic spots, as do Rock Hound State Park near Deming and Oasis State\r\nPark near Portales and Clovis. Picnicking, fishing, and spectacular\r\ncanyons attract the visitor at Rio Grande Gorge Park west of Taos. Weird\r\nerosional figures carved from volcanic layers distinguish City of Rocks\r\nState Park near Deming. Pancho Villa State Park at Columbus and Kit\r\nCarson Memorial at Taos mark historic sites. Valley of Fires State Park\r\nwest of Carrizozo preserves the black twisted lava of a relatively\r\nrecent volcanic flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO STATE MONUMENTS\r\n\r\n                    _by_ Museum of New Mexico Staff\r\n\r\nThe State of New Mexico, recognizing the depth and color of its own\r\nhistory, has established a number of state monuments preserving\r\nimportant historical or archeological sites. These are administered by\r\nthe Museum of New Mexico located in Santa Fe. Any mosaic of New Mexico\r\nwould be incomplete without including these important landmarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  El Palacio, Palace of the Governors\r\n\r\nThe main facility of the Museum of New Mexico is El Palacio. The Palace\r\nof the Governors, on the plaza in the heart of Santa Fe, is the oldest\r\npublic building in the United States. Built in 1610, it was the seat of\r\nSpanish government in New Mexico until 1821, of the Mexican government\r\nuntil 1846, and the residence of the governors appointed by the\r\nPresident of the United States until 1910, when it became a unit of the\r\nMuseum of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt presently contains exhibits relating to New Mexico’s past, ranging\r\nfrom the Indians, who arrived after crossing the Bering Sea, to the\r\nSpanish, who came seeking gold and glory on horseback, to the wagon\r\ntrains from the east, whose goal was the end of the Santa Fe Trail,\r\nwhich is directly in front of El Palacio.\r\n\r\nEl Palacio was the capitol of New Mexico for 300 years and was the seat\r\nof residence for more than one hundred of New Mexico’s governors. During\r\nthat time it was captured and held by the Indians from 1680 to 1692. The\r\nArmy of the Confederacy captured it for a few days during the Civil War,\r\nand one of its occupants, Territorial Governor Lew. Wallace, wrote his\r\nfamous novel, _Ben Hur_, within its walls.\r\n\r\nThere are other fascinating units connected with the Museum of New\r\nMexico in Santa Fe. Among these are the Fine Arts Museum, emphasizing\r\nthe art and artists of the great Southwest; the International Folk Art\r\nMuseum; and the Hall of Ethnology, devoted primarily to the peoples of\r\nthe Southwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Abo State Monument\r\n\r\nOff U.S. Highway 60, nine miles west of Mountainair is Abo State\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the ancient mission church of San Gregorio de Abo and its\r\npueblo, built of red sandstone, are in a broad, natural amphitheater\r\nrimmed on the north and west by the blue Manzano Mountains, which\r\ncontrast strikingly with the reddish hues of the Abo sandstone. This is\r\none of the Saline Missions, so called because of the nearby salt\r\ndeposits in the Estancia Basin.\r\n\r\nIt was built during the seventeenth century by Indians under the\r\nsupervision of the Franciscans, led by the venerable Fray Francisco de\r\nAcevedo. The inhabitants of Abo were very friendly to the Spaniards.\r\nThey were forced to abandon their pueblo about 1673 because of drought\r\nand the raids of the Apaches and Comanches. They then moved south to El\r\nPaso del Norte where they joined in founding Isleta del Sur.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the pueblo have disintegrated with time into low mounds\r\nwhich lie adjacent to the mission. The ecclesiastical structures have\r\nbeen excavated and repaired for permanent preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Quarai State Monument\r\n\r\nThis monument is near Punta de Agua, eight miles north of Mountainair\r\noff State Highway 10.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the mission church of the Immaculate Conception at Quarai\r\nare unsurpassed in grandeur of architecture or setting by any that\r\nsurvive from the labors of the early Franciscans in New Mexico. Built of\r\nred sandstone masonry about 1628, at the Pueblo of Quarai, it was\r\nabandoned along with the pueblo about 1674, chiefly because of Apache\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\nOne of the most venerated of the Franciscan missionaries, Fray Geronimo\r\nde la Llana, worked and died at Quarai, beloved by his Indian charges.\r\nHis remains now rest in a crypt in the wall of St. Francis Cathedral in\r\nSanta Fe. The ruins have been excavated and repaired for permanent\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Coronado State Monument\r\n\r\nThis pueblo ruin is on the west bank of the Rio Grande, one mile from\r\nthe town of Bernalillo, seventeen miles north of Albuquerque, and one\r\nmile off U.S. Highway 85, between Albuquerque and Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblo of Kuaua was one of the several towns of the ancient Tiguex\r\nprovince. At or near Kuaua, the Coronado expedition maintained\r\nheadquarters from about 1540 to 1542 A.D. During excavation of the\r\nancient pueblo, more than 1200 ground-floor rooms were found and five\r\nkivas, or underground ceremonial chambers, were uncovered.\r\n\r\nIn one of the kivas was found a highly important group of ancient wall\r\npaintings. This kiva has been reconstructed and the paintings restored.\r\n\r\nThe old walls of Kuaua have been rebuilt to a few feet in height so that\r\nthe structure can be seen. A museum has been erected on the site to\r\nexhibit the material found during the excavation and to portray life in\r\nthe Tiguex province. The Coronado State Monument and Museum commemorates\r\nthe meeting, more than four hundred years ago, of the elements that\r\ninfluenced the culture of New Mexico—the Indian and the _conquistadore_.\r\n\r\nA curator-custodian is on duty at the Coronado Museum headquarters,\r\nwhich is open all year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Pecos State Monument\r\n\r\nOff U.S. Highway 84-85, three miles south of Pecos, is this State\r\nMonument. It became a National Monument during late 1966.\r\n\r\nThis mission, the Church of Nuestra Senora de los Angeles de Porciuncula\r\nat Pecos, dates from the year 1617. It is fitting that this mission,\r\nwhich was one of the first two, with Jemez, established by the\r\nFranciscans in New Mexico, should bear the name “Our Lady of the Angels\r\nof Porciuncula,” for with his own hands, St. Francis, founder of the\r\nOrder, rebuilt the decaying chapel of Our Lady of Angels at Assisi,\r\nwhich he called his Porciuncula or “Little Inheritance,” and there\r\nestablished the headquarters of the Franciscan Order.\r\n\r\nPecos was well fortified because of its location on the eastern edge of\r\nthe pueblo area and its contact with the Plains Indians. It resisted the\r\nraids for many years, but when a smallpox epidemic in 1838 reduced the\r\npopulation to seventeen survivors, they moved to Jemez Pueblo,\r\nabandoning Pecos.\r\n\r\nA part of the massive adobe walls of the ruined mission has been\r\nexcavated and repaired, as have some of the rubble masonry walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Jemez State Monument\r\n\r\nThis Monument is at Jemez Springs, sixty miles north of Albuquerque on\r\nState Highway 4.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest early mission churches was established at Giusewa\r\nPueblo. _Giusewa_ means “place of the boiling waters” in the language of\r\nthe Jemez Indians, and refers to the famous Jemez Hot Springs nearby.\r\nThe mission, with Pecos, was one of the two earliest in New Mexico.\r\nThese were founded one hundred and fifty-two years before the first\r\nCalifornia missions.\r\n\r\nThe original settlement of the Giusewa Pueblo goes back hundreds of\r\nyears before Columbus’ discovery of America, as does the settlement of\r\nthe other pueblos, Quarai, Abo, and Pecos.\r\n\r\nGuisewa Pueblo became extinct during the last quarter of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, a result of the consolidation of several pueblos of the Jemez\r\nprovince into fewer and larger towns. Only one town, the present Jemez\r\nPueblo, survives from that time. Excavation and repairs have been made\r\nin the ruins of both the pueblo and the mission church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       La Mesilla State Monument\r\n\r\nThis colorful State Monument consists of the plaza in the village of\r\nMesilla, near Las Cruces, and the buildings nearby. The Monument\r\npreserves an aspect of the Mexican Colonial culture and architecture\r\nwhich flourished here in the early nineteenth century. The Gadsden\r\nPurchase of 1853 was celebrated in the Mesilla Plaza and the famous\r\ndesperado, Billy the Kid, once stood trial here for his life. During the\r\nCivil War, Mesilla was briefly the Confederate capitol of the Territory\r\nof Arizona.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Lincoln State Monument\r\n\r\nLocated in Lincoln, on U.S. Highway 380, and known as the Old Lincoln\r\nCounty Courthouse, the first floor of this Monument was the mercantile\r\nstore of L. G. Murphy & Co. in the 1870’s, during the Lincoln County\r\nWar. The second floor was purchased in 1870 by the county for a court\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIt was from this building that Billy the Kid made his daring escape on\r\nApril 28, 1881, after killing his two guards. A caretaker and a museum\r\nattendant are on duty at all times. Mementos of the infamous Lincoln\r\nCounty cattle war are featured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Fort Selden State Monument\r\n\r\nThe crumbling adobe walls of Fort Selden lie about seventeen miles north\r\nof Las Cruces just west of Interstate Highway 25. The history of this\r\nfort, given in the article on _Frontier Forts_, was highlighted by the\r\nbrief stay of General Douglas MacArthur, who spent some of his childhood\r\nwithin the fort’s walls and played in the adjoining green valley of the\r\nRio Grande.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO STATE PARKS\r\n\r\n                            _by_ The Editors\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is blessed with a wealth of natural resources and perhaps\r\nmost important is the abundance of sites with outstanding scenic and\r\nrecreational facilities. The contrasts apparent in the mosaic of New\r\nMexico are also seen in the pattern of its state parks. They range from\r\ndesert regions with sparse and exotic flora and fauna to the high\r\nmountain canyons choked with Douglas fir and aspen where even in the\r\nsummer evenings one huddles close to the fire for warmth. And the mosaic\r\nshifts from waterless areas amid geologic wonders to wide expanses of\r\nopen water well stocked with trout. The parks are administered by the\r\nNew Mexico State Park and Recreation Commission. Wherever possible,\r\nareas have been set aside for the permanent enjoyment of the people of\r\nNew Mexico and their visitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Bottomless Lakes State Park\r\n\r\nBottomless Lakes State Park, established in 1936, was one of the first\r\nof the New Mexico state parks. It is surprising to find this treasure of\r\ngreat natural beauty in an area so dominated by aridity. There are six\r\nsmall lakes in the park, of which Lea Lake is the largest with about 15\r\nacres of surface area. The water of the lakes is crystal clear and\r\nvaries in depth from 45 feet in the shallow lakes to about 100 feet in\r\nthe deeper ones. They were created as “sink holes” when water dissolved\r\nlarge areas of underground gypsum, resulting in cave-ins. The lakes now\r\noffer extensive recreational facilities for the people of New Mexico and\r\nfor tourists passing through or visiting the area. Camping, swimming,\r\nand boating are available. Pecos “diamonds,” small quartz crystals, can\r\nbe found in the neighboring hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Conchas Lake State Park\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Sketch of Bottomless Lake]\r\n\r\nConchas Lake is one of the largest sustained bodies of water in New\r\nMexico. Conchas Dam, which holds the water of the Canadian River, forms\r\nthe lake. The main dam is 235 feet above the roadway and is 1250 feet in\r\nlength. At capacity it holds 600,000 acre-feet of water. The reservoir\r\nserves many purposes: flood control, local irrigation, camping and\r\nboating facilities, and fishing and water skiing.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian River has its origin on Raton Mesa and flows southward to\r\nConchas Dam, then turns abruptly eastward. On its way across the High\r\nPlains, it cuts into some of the oldest rocks that can be seen on the\r\nwestern edge of the plains, the Dockum Group of Late Triassic age. The\r\nbest place to view the earth-building processes of this region is where\r\nState Highway 120 crosses the gorge of the Canadian River between Wagon\r\nMound and Roy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Hyde Memorial State Park\r\n\r\nHere, at an elevation of 9000 feet, among tall pines and aspens is one\r\nof the most scenic of all New Mexico’s parks. High in the Sangre de\r\nCristo Mountains, eight miles northeast of Santa Fe, the park offers an\r\nexcellent example of the scenic beauty in New Mexico rarely seen by most\r\ntravelers passing through the state. Easily accessible from Santa Fe,\r\nHyde Park gives a few moments, or a few days, respite in the cool\r\nrefreshment of a mountain forest. Excellent picnic and camping\r\nfacilities are available. For those who want to penetrate the mountain\r\nvastness even farther, there are a number of well-marked trails for\r\nhiking.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Navajo Lake State Park\r\n\r\nNavajo Dam on the San Juan River lies twenty-five miles east of Aztec at\r\nan elevation of 6200 feet in a region of spectacular scenic beauty.\r\nCamping, picnicking, boating, fishing, and water skiing facilities are\r\navailable, and a lodge is under construction. This is expected to be one\r\nof the most important sports and recreational centers in northwest New\r\nMexico in coming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Pancho Villa State Park\r\n\r\nNamed for the famous Mexican bandit and revolutionary leader, the park\r\nis located near Columbus, New Mexico, site of Villa’s most infamous\r\nraid. In the dead of the night on March 10, 1916, Villa and his men\r\nentered the town of Columbus and did their bloody work. When they left,\r\nseventeen local people were dead, including eight soldiers and nine\r\ncivilians. The Mexican force suffered heavy casualties, perhaps as many\r\nas 125 killed. The town of Columbus was badly damaged and has only\r\nrecently begun to recover from the blow. The expedition of General\r\nPershing, then on duty along the Mexican border, was organized to hunt\r\ndown Villa and his men. Pershing and a United States military unit spent\r\nthree months inside Mexico, only to return to the United States\r\nempty-handed. The park commemorates one of the most interesting and\r\ntragic episodes in New Mexico history. Within the park, one can see\r\nexcellent examples of Sonoran desert flora. Picnic facilities and\r\ncamping sites are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        El Vado Lake State Park\r\n\r\nEl Vado Dam is a part of the complex Rio Grande Conservancy District\r\nflood and irrigation project. It holds the water of the Chama River,\r\nwhich flows west, south, and then east into the Rio Grande. The country\r\nsurrounding El Vado Lake is beautiful and contains some of the finest\r\ntrout fishing streams in the state. At the lake itself there are camping\r\nfacilities, including trailer spaces (no hookups for water or\r\nelectricity). The lake is at an elevation of 7000 feet and is one of the\r\nimportant flood-control bodies of water in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Bluewater State Park\r\n\r\nBluewater Lake, at an elevation of 7460 feet, is a spot of spectacular\r\nbeauty. Adjacent is a 160-acre wooded park. The area offers boating,\r\nfishing, and swimming. The lake was formed by impounding the waters from\r\nthe Zuni Mountains’ watershed, and it fills three great depressions in\r\nhigh tablelands. The dam, built across two lofty natural walls of solid\r\nrock, the San Andres Limestone, holds a lake a mile wide and seven and a\r\nhalf miles long. Bluewater Lake State Park was the first of New Mexico’s\r\nparks, so designated in 1929.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Storrie Lake State Park\r\n\r\nStorrie Lake State Park surrounds a small lake north of Las Vegas, New\r\nMexico. It lies on the west edge of the High Plains and is an excellent\r\nrecreation area. The lake is at an elevation of 6400 feet and has a\r\nlimited number of picnic and camping facilities. It is stocked with\r\nrainbow and brown trout and crappies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        City of Rocks State Park\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most unusual of the state parks, and one of the\r\nfinest for picnicking and for camping. Located in the unusual rock\r\nformation known as the Sugarlump Welded Rhyolite Tuff northwest of\r\nDeming, it is a source of wonder to all visitors. Suddenly, in a\r\nseemingly flat, desert plain, one comes upon these grotesque outcrops.\r\nIn the coolness of the shade of these ancient rocks one can survey\r\nvistas under an azure sky that are almost breathless. This is the desert\r\nSouthwest at its very best; not the harsh, unfriendly desert of movies\r\nand fiction, but a lovely spot in which to enjoy to the fullest the\r\nwonders of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Kit Carson Memorial Park\r\n\r\nThis 20-acre plot of grass, flower beds, trees, and picnic tables lies\r\non the northeast edge of Taos and contains the graves of Kit Carson and\r\nPadre José Martinez. Not far away is the Kit Carson House, a group of\r\nadobe buildings surrounding a patio, that was Carson’s headquarters,\r\noffice, and home from 1858 to 1866. This Indian fighter, trapper,\r\nhunter, and trader is most famous for defeating the Navajos in Canyon de\r\nChelly and marching 7000 of these Indians across New Mexico to a\r\nreservation at Bosque Redondo near Fort Sumner. However, during his\r\neight years as Indian agent, Carson worked continuously for the welfare\r\nof his charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Oasis State Park\r\n\r\nOne of the state’s newest parks, Oasis is seven miles northeast of\r\nPortales along State Highway 467. This shady place of cottonwood trees\r\namid sand dunes has long been a favorite picnic spot. The sand dunes\r\nform an irregular ridge separating Portales Valley to the south from\r\nBlackwater Draw to the north. In Blackwater Draw have been found bones\r\nof ancient animals and the weapons used by early man some 12,000 years\r\nago. Portales Valley is the sand-filled remnant of the early Pleistocene\r\nBrazos River Valley that once drained eastward into Texas. About 800,000\r\nyears ago, the Pecos River to the west “captured” the headwaters of this\r\nformer Brazos River and left the Portales Valley high and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Valley of Fires State Park\r\n\r\nThis park, about five miles west of Carrizozo on U.S. Highway 380,\r\nfeatures picnic tables amid the Carrizozo lava flow, or malpais, one of\r\nthe youngest in the United States. The lava flowed out of Little Black\r\nPeak about 1000 years ago in a series of individual “rivers” of hot\r\nblack basalt. The composite flow is 44 miles long, 0.5 to 6 miles wide,\r\nand is made up of about 1 cubic mile of basalt; it moved southward down\r\nthe lowest part of the northern Tularosa Basin.\r\n\r\nClimb around on the lava and note the ropy nature of the surface\r\n(_pahoehoe_ of the Hawaiians), the many frozen gas bubbles in the rocks\r\n(vesicles), the squeeze-ups where once-liquid lava protrudes through\r\ncracks in the hardened crust, the pressure ridges where the hardened\r\ncrust arched and broke, and collapsed lava tunnels where the outer lava\r\nfroze and the molten interior ran out, leaving an open tube or cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Ute Lake State Park\r\n\r\nUte Dam, two miles southwest of Logan, provides a 4200-acre reservoir\r\nalong the Canadian River and Ute Creek stocked with rainbow trout, bass,\r\ncrappie, and catfish. Camping, picnicking, and boating facilities are\r\navailable along the valley walls, which are cut in the brown Santa Rosa\r\nSandstone and overlying maroon to green Chinle shales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Santa Fe River State Park\r\n\r\nBordering the Santa Fe River in downtown Santa Fe, this city park merges\r\nwith the State Capitol grounds. It provides picnic tables and benches in\r\nthe shade of tall trees amid the picturesque ancient city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Elephant Butte Lake State Park\r\n\r\nThe giant Elephant Butte Reservoir, impounded behind the dam five miles\r\neast of Truth or Consequences, provides year-around fishing, boating,\r\nwater skiing, and camping. Built in brown to gray Cretaceous sandstone\r\nand shale, the dam is overlooked by the brownish-black volcanic neck\r\nthat is Elephant Butte. Eastern shores are carved from the purplish and\r\nmaroon McRae layers. This is the main storage reservoir for the water\r\nthat irrigates the lush Rio Grande Valley to the south near Las Cruces\r\nand El Paso.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Caballo Lake State Park\r\n\r\nCaballo Reservoir, downstream from Elephant Butte, offers excellent\r\nfacilities for water sports, its bass and crappie fishing being notable.\r\nThe State Park is fourteen miles south of Truth or Consequences and six\r\nmiles north of the dam. The spectacular rugged front of the Caballo\r\nMountains looms to the east, with sharp canyons and ribbed cliffs along\r\nthe valley walls cut in the tan layers of the Santa Fe Formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Rio Grande Gorge State Park\r\n\r\nFrom Velarde (twelve miles north of Espanola) for seventy miles\r\nnorthward to the Colorado state line, the Rio Grande Gorge is carved 500\r\nto 800 feet into black basalt flows and tan Santa Fe Formation layers.\r\nFishing is exciting in the fast waters, although the northern part of\r\nthe gorge is difficult to reach.

Thompson[5]\r\n\r\nWater in the great Southwest, of which the State of New Mexico is a\r\npart, has made for a colorful and historical background. Water, perhaps\r\nmore than anything else, has molded the lives of all inhabitants of the\r\narea from the pueblo and lodge of the early Indian to the civilization\r\nwe know today. The fish and wildlife resources as related to water have\r\nplayed an important part in everyday living and economy.\r\n\r\nFrom data gathered by archeologists there are indications that the early\r\nIndian used fish as part of his diet. Fish bones are found in excavated\r\nruins, and fish pictures are occasionally found as petroglyphs and on\r\npottery (fig. 1). Although the use of fish was limited, it was\r\nwidespread throughout the Southwest, not being confined to one Indian\r\ntribe or nation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1. Bowl depicting fish, found in ruins of\r\n    Mimbres Indians]\r\n\r\nThe use of fish by the white settler was likewise restricted, but it\r\nincreased as time progressed and knowledge and equipment improved. There\r\nis only limited reference to fish for either food or sport fishing until\r\nafter the middle of the nineteenth century. Early explorers made records\r\nof fish in various waters of New Mexico and in most instances described\r\nthe new species.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the waters of the desert also could be described as fish\r\ndeserts. Only three recognized kinds of food fish, as we know them\r\ntoday, inhabited the waters of this region. The trout was limited to the\r\ncutthroat species or subspecies. These were found as one subspecies in\r\nthe Rio Grande drainage and the other subspecies in the Arkansas River\r\ndrainage. The latter is reduced in numbers but a few remnants remain in\r\nthe headwaters. The former is being artificially propagated and is being\r\nmaintained successfully. The trout found in the Gila River drainage,\r\noriginally thought to be a cutthroat, then a rainbow, has been recently\r\ndescribed as a separate species. These trout, like the Arkansas River\r\nfish, remain as remnants in the headwaters. For the most part, the\r\nnative trout have had a difficult time surviving in recent years because\r\nof the change in water and land use; the habitat has become exceedingly\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nChannel catfish were originally found in the Rio Grande drainage and\r\ncontinue to maintain themselves satisfactorily. Water and land\r\nmanipulation, however, present a serious threat, even to this hardy\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThere are records that the gulf eel once came up the Rio Grande during\r\npart of its life cycle. This fish of the ocean has long since\r\ndisappeared—the fate of many migrating fish when confronted with\r\nman-made obstructions in the watercourses.\r\n\r\nWaterfowl were in great abundance once, in both the upper Rio Grande and\r\nthe Pecos River drainages. These birds utilized the vast marsh areas of\r\nthe valleys during spring and fall migrations. It is presumed that there\r\nwas very little nesting of waterfowl in the early years.\r\n\r\nThe mammals that live in or near the water, principally fur bearers,\r\nwere in abundance as long as water habitat was abundant and prior to\r\nunrestricted trapping. With the exception of the beaver (since restocked\r\nand protected), many of the fur bearers once numerous are now extremely\r\nlimited in numbers or approaching extinction. There is only an\r\noccasional sighting of the otter which was once relatively plentiful.\r\n\r\nHabitat for the various water mammals, birds, and fish is found in the\r\ndrainage systems. The major system is the Rio Grande that flows through\r\nthe center of the state; the Pecos River is its tributary. In this\r\nsystem are six of the seven life zones and conditions of habitat\r\nsuitable to almost any form of water-dwelling life.\r\n\r\nThere is a noticeable habitat change due to several causes, such as\r\nranching, irrigation, urban development, and a general minor change in\r\nclimatic conditions. Many variations are in direct relation, such as\r\nimproper grazing, unscreened irrigation diversions, dams, and sewage\r\ndisposal, to mention a few. There is an indication of a long-term\r\nwarming of the general Southwest, and though this change is fractional,\r\nit does have a basic effect on habitat.\r\n\r\nThe effect of habitat change can be noted in the life of the cutthroat\r\ntrout. Early records reveal that this trout, liking cool clear water,\r\nwas once caught in the Rio Grande in the lower part of the box canyon\r\nnorth of Peñablanca. It was also caught near the town of Pecos. The fish\r\ncan no longer survive in the changed water conditions and is found now\r\nonly in the headwaters. Even the catfish has difficulty surviving in\r\nsome sections of the rivers for lack of water. In the lower Pecos, the\r\ncatfish finds difficulty in reproducing because of the high salt content\r\nof the river water.\r\n\r\nAs has already been noted, the fish that are recognized as game fish\r\ntoday were in short supply a hundred years ago. It was not until the\r\nrailroads entered New Mexico that fish were imported to supplement the\r\nnative supply. In an unpublished report by the author, it was pointed\r\nout that almost every kind of fish propagated in the United States has\r\nbeen imported and stocked in waters of New Mexico. Of these, some have\r\nsurvived beyond expectations and others have disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nWhen the railroads entered New Mexico, there were already requests for\r\nfish in the hands of the United States Fish Commission. Fish were\r\ndelivered in especially designed fish-distribution cars and the\r\nconsignee met the cars at designated rail sidings. From the distribution\r\ncars, the fish were further transported by wagons in water containers of\r\nvarious descriptions, usually wooden barrels or watertight wooden boxes,\r\nto streams or lakes as assigned. Because of the mode of travel at the\r\ntime, the quantities of fish so stocked were limited, but they did\r\nprovide seed stock from which their population could grow. Fish were\r\npacked on back and on horses into relatively inaccessible areas. The\r\nprocedures and techniques of fish transportation have evolved to the\r\npresent highly specialized equipment and methods of operation.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the quantities of fish imported and\r\nplanted increased in relation to the improved transportation. The early\r\nrecords indicate the numbers in the hundreds and in just a few\r\nlocations; later plantings increased both in numbers stocked and in\r\nwaters stocked. The first fish imported to supplement the native fish\r\nwas the German carp. In fact, this was the only fish imported for eight\r\nconsecutive years, 1883-1890. These early plantings were followed by\r\ncatfish, German brown trout, brook trout, yellow perch, largemouth black\r\nbass, crappie, rock bass, tench, rainbow trout, strawberry bass, black\r\nspotted trout, bream, smallmouth bass, salmon, white bass, and walleyed\r\npike.\r\n\r\nAll the fish imported are classed as game fish except carp and tench\r\n(the latter did not survive). The various species met their habitat\r\nrequirements, and although there were no survivals in some locations,\r\nthey did acclimate in others and have developed into a substantial\r\nfishery. Some species are predominant while others, like the rock bass,\r\nare remnant and taken only occasionally. The fish most sought now and\r\npredominant in the fishery are rainbow (fig. 2) and brown trout,\r\ncatfish, largemouth bass, crappie, and walleyed pike.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2. Joy of the fisherman, rainbow trout]\r\n\r\nManagement of the fishery has progressed with technical development.\r\nWhen fish were planted in early years, very little thought was given\r\nabout the habitat except that it was water. There was little known of\r\nthe requirements of fish. As a result, fish were placed in waters only\r\nto perish. To maintain a fish population now, all techniques available\r\nare employed and fish are stocked where water and species are\r\ncompatible.\r\n\r\nWater in the desert is always at a premium for the inhabitants. The\r\nearly Indian cultures used water for irrigation, and there are still\r\nvestiges of canals used by Indians to convey water to their crops. The\r\nuse of water by the Indians then had little or no effect on fish life,\r\nbut as irrigation development increased, a new habitat was formed. The\r\nonce free-flowing rivers became dry in places, and new waters were\r\ndeveloped in the drainage ditches in the Rio Grande Valley. The\r\ncompetition for water is very keen and fish and wildlife uses come after\r\ndomestic, commercial, and irrigation purposes.\r\n\r\nThe water requirements are so great, in fact, that it has been necessary\r\nto control water and its use by laws. The law of 1876 provided that\r\nwater could not be refused a traveler. Community ditch commissioners\r\nwere established by law in 1895. The basic laws governing water rights\r\nwere established in 1907. These laws have been amended or added to as\r\nconditions dictate. Conservancy districts were recognized by law in\r\n1927, and underground waters came under law in 1931. The Interstate\r\nStream Commission was created in 1935. At present, New Mexico water laws\r\nare considered some of the best in the nation; however, it has been only\r\nrecently that water for fish and wildlife has been recognized as one of\r\nthe beneficial uses.\r\n\r\nConverse to the use of water to the detriment of fish and wildlife,\r\nthere are several areas in which water has been developed and impounded\r\nto the benefit of the fishery. Although some impoundments were\r\nsingle-purpose developments, they supply habitat in conservation pools\r\nor during years of abundant water supply.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. Find the elephant!—at Elephant Butte\r\n    reservoir]\r\n\r\nWaters impounded by man but used as a fishery are Elephant Butte\r\nReservoir (fig. 3), 40,096 surface acres when full. It contains\r\nlargemouth black bass, crappie, walleyed pike, catfish, and sunfish.\r\nThis lake has not been full for many years; but like Alamogordo\r\nReservoir (4650 surface acres), Caballo Reservoir (11,532 surface\r\nacres), McMillan Reservoir (2500 surface acres), Conchas Reservoir\r\n(16,640 surface acres), and Avalon Reservoir (950 surface acres), it has\r\nproduced excellent fishing. These are large irrigation lakes and are all\r\nstocked generally with the same species of fish.\r\n\r\nThe lakes built for irrigation but utilized for trout are usually much\r\nsmaller. The principal ones are Navajo Reservoir (15,600 surface acres)\r\nand El Vado (3500 surface acres). There are also Miami Lake (190 surface\r\nacres) and several others of small size.\r\n\r\nIn addition, several small lakes have been built or acquired for the\r\nprimary purpose of providing fishing. A few of these are Hopewell Lake\r\n(14 surface acres), Lake Roberts (73 surface acres), and Charette Lakes\r\n(400 surface acres). There are many more varying in size. The smaller\r\nlakes are primarily for trout fishing, but a few in the southern part of\r\nthe state do have species usually found in warmer waters.\r\n\r\nIn the process of reservoir construction, waterfowl habitat and resting\r\nareas are created. These new lakes, however, are a poor substitute for\r\nthe natural marshes and potholes originally frequented by ducks and\r\ngeese. Water mammals, likewise, find the artificial impoundments\r\nundesirable in comparison, and the increased water has added very little\r\nto this resource.\r\n\r\nEvery water development has with it the appeal of recreation other than\r\nfishing. Now a lake must have such facilities as picnic and camping\r\nareas, launching ramps, good accessibility, boat rentals, and a\r\nconcessionaire. There is no single-purpose reservoir in respect to\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is concluded that the old adage, “fishing ain’t what it used\r\nto be,” should no longer be true for New Mexico. The fishing water has\r\nbeen added to greatly and the fish are managed better. The only problem\r\nis one of increased human population. Where there was one fisherman\r\nfifty years ago, there are a thousand now.\r\n\r\nTruly, the water of the desert is used to the limit.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    The past living today—San Miguel, early mission church still used\r\n    daily in Santa Fe]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Indians of New Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _by_ Paige W. Christiansen\r\n\r\nPeople entering New Mexico today find Indian cultures and Indian\r\nvillages with traditions and ways of life that have changed little in\r\nmany centuries. In this respect, man in the twentieth century shares an\r\nexperience in common with Coronado, Oñate, and all the other\r\n_conquistadores_ who visited New Mexico so many generations ago. They,\r\ntoo, found the ancient Indian cultures strangely magnetic and exciting.\r\nIf we could but remove the asphalt highways, the billboards, the\r\ntelephone poles, and fences that seem always to surround us, the Indian\r\nvillages in many parts of the state would look very much as they looked\r\nto the early Spanish explorers who were the first Europeans to see them.\r\nTo meet the Indians of New Mexico and to visit their homes, if possible,\r\nis one of the greatest experiences available to residents and visitors\r\nalike. Although words are inadequate to give the true flavor and\r\nexcitement of the Indian and his way of life, they are all we have to\r\nintroduce the various people who make up the Indian population of New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThere are two main groups that should be known. First, the Pueblo\r\nIndians, those who developed sedentary village life and who are the\r\ndescendants of the first Americans in New Mexico. Second, the\r\n“newcomers” to the state, those who, for some reason or other, moved\r\ninto the state to replace earlier cultures. Let us, then, visit some of\r\nthese people’s homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Acoma Pueblo\r\n\r\nAcoma Indian Pueblo, the Sky City, is famous in both history and legend.\r\nBuilt on the top of a lofty, almost inaccessible, redrock mesa some 357\r\nfeet high, it is one of the most picturesque of all New Mexico Indian\r\npueblos. No other pueblo gives one such a clear sense of living in\r\nancestral times. The movements of the people up and down the steep\r\ntrails, the untiring vistas, and the ancient homesites are reminiscent\r\nof the life and times of the cliff dwellers. Here the archeologists can\r\nsearch out the secrets of ancient life by direct observation. Here, too,\r\nis brought forth in the fullness of its bloom an Indian culture of\r\noutstanding achievement.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Acoma participated in the great Pueblo Revolt of 1680.\r\nThey killed their priest, Fray Lucas Maldonado, in the first frenzy of\r\nthe rebellion. Because of their isolation and the inaccessibility of the\r\nvillage, they were spared the vengeance of the Spaniards under de Vargas\r\nduring the reconquest in 1692. There was an attempt by the Spanish in\r\n1696 to take Acoma, but they succeeded only in destroying the crops and\r\nin capturing five Acoma warriors. The Indians held out until July 6,\r\n1699, when they submitted to the Spanish governor of New Mexico,\r\nGovernor Cubero. Thereafter, Acoma became an integral part of the\r\nmission complex established in New Mexico by the Spanish.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A., by Starr Jenkins_)\r\n    Aspen Basin in Sangre de Cristo Mountains near Santa Fe]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A., by John Whiteside_)\r\n    Tent Rocks in Jemez Mountains]\r\n\r\nAcoma is noted for its excellent pottery. The ware is fashioned from\r\nclay of fine quality, is very well fired, and is carefully decorated in\r\ntypical Acoma designs. Here is an excellent example of Indian artistic\r\nability. Some weaving, such as belts and headbands, is engaged in and a\r\nfew baskets are produced, but Acoma is most famous for its pottery.\r\n\r\nOne of the landmarks at Acoma is the great church which brave Fray Juan\r\nRamirez toiled to create in the early seventeenth century. Surely there\r\nare few memorials of the Spanish epoch in the Southwest that present\r\nsuch a picture of dauntless faith in spiritual ideals as does this\r\nfortress church silhouetted high against the sky above the bare-rock\r\nmesa. It measures 150 feet in length and has walls that are 60 feet high\r\nand 10 feet thick. Timbers 40 feet long and 14 inches through support\r\nthe roof and make a handsome ceiling. There are, of course, no seats and\r\nlittle decoration. And what a location for so magnificent a spiritual\r\ncenter it is! From there one may lift his eyes in rapt admiration of the\r\nsplendid panorama of the great plain and the encircling mountains, and\r\nthereby appreciate more fully the work of the Deity.\r\n\r\nThe Acoma are agriculturists, cultivating their lands by irrigation;\r\nthey raise corn, wheat, melons, squashes, and hay. Now, however, most of\r\nthe people of Acoma do not live on their mesa which protected them for\r\nso many centuries. The dangers of attack are no longer present, and the\r\nfarmers find it more advantageous to live closer to their irrigated\r\nplots. The result is that the people of Acoma are now scattered\r\nthroughout several villages. Their great culture, their traditions,\r\ntheir fierce pride, and their deep reverence for their spectacular\r\nhistory is visible in their faces and manners. Acoma, the Sky City,\r\nremains the eternal city of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Cochiti Pueblo\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Cochiti Pueblo claim the famed cave dwellings and ruins\r\nof the Rito de Frijoles (Bandelier National Monument) as their ancestral\r\nhome. Failure of timber and water resources plus the constant attack of\r\nthe various Apache Indian tribes over several centuries caused the\r\nresidents of the Rito de Frijoles to seek a better home. This probably\r\noccurred about 1200 A.D. In 1598, when Juan de Oñate, colonizer of New\r\nMexico, arrived, the Indians of Cochiti were living in their present\r\nvillage. For a short time following the reconquest of New Mexico by de\r\nVargas after the Pueblo Revolt, the people of Cochiti lived in Cañada de\r\nCochiti, which was in a better position for defense against Spanish\r\nreconquest. In 1694, de Vargas took the canyon village by storm, burned\r\nit, and forced the people to return to the older village of Cochiti\r\nwhere they remain to this day.\r\n\r\nThe population of the village is slightly more than 300, and there has\r\nbeen little growth in the past thirty years. Like the other New Mexico\r\npueblos, the main occupation is agriculture. Their ancient traditions\r\nare well preserved, among them the well-known Rain Dance held during the\r\nannual festival of San Buenaventura in July.\r\n\r\nLocated at the pueblo is the ancient and beautiful Spanish mission, San\r\nBuenaventura de Cochiti, built in the early seventeenth century. To step\r\ninto this church is to return to the Spanish days of yore. There are no\r\nseats, women kneel on one side, the men on the other, and the services\r\nare a mixture of old world orthodoxy and new world Indian traditions.\r\nCochiti represents one of the finest examples of modern Pueblo Indian\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Isleta Pueblo\r\n\r\nIsleta Pueblo is the southernmost of the pueblos lying along the green\r\nand lush Rio Grande Valley today. It stands on the same site it occupied\r\nwhen Coronado came in 1540 and was a stopping place for every Spanish\r\nexplorer and traveler who passed through New Mexico. It did not take\r\npart in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, but rather joined the Spanish in the\r\nretreat to El Paso del Norte (modern Juarez, Mexico). There they founded\r\na new village just to the south of modern El Paso which they called\r\nIsleta del Sur. The main village of Isleta, in New Mexico, remained\r\ndeserted until 1709 when it was re-established by Fray Juan de la Peña.\r\n\r\nTwo different missions were built at Isleta Pueblo. The first, San\r\nAntonio de Isleta, was constructed about 1629. The church was burned in\r\n1680, and in 1681 was being used as a sheep corral. Between 1680 and the\r\ncompletion of the reconquest, it was completely destroyed. The second\r\nmission, still remaining at Isleta, called San Agustin de Isleta, was\r\nbuilt in 1709 on the old site.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the primary pursuit of the Indians of Isleta, although\r\nthey do considerable stock grazing. The population of Isleta is nearly\r\n2000 persons. The annual fiesta takes place in late August.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Jemez Pueblo\r\n\r\nThe Jemez Indians were first seen by Europeans in 1541 when they were\r\nvisited by Captain Francisco de Barrio-Nuevo, of Coronado’s expedition.\r\nHe counted seven villages, naming them Aguas Calientes because of the\r\nmany hot springs in the canyon of the Jemez River. The ancient pueblos\r\nare now all in ruins, with one preserved as the Jemez State Monument.\r\nThe present pueblo, built on the mesa where the Jemez River leaves the\r\nmountains, was constructed after the Pueblo Revolt. The Jemez people\r\nfled their older villages during the reconquest and for a time lived\r\nwith the Navajo, whom they disliked but preferred to the Spanish.\r\n\r\nThere have been four notable missions among the Jemez Indians. The\r\nfirst, San Diego de Jemez Mission, was built in the early seventeenth\r\ncentury. It was one of the most successful of the New Mexico missions;\r\nreportedly, more than 6000 converts were made among the Jemez Indians\r\nbefore 1622. Because of the constant attacks of the Navajo, the\r\ntraditional enemies of the Jemez people, the ancient pueblos gradually\r\ndeclined and were finally completely abandoned after Jemez participation\r\nin the Pueblo Revolt. The ruins of this church, now the Jemez State\r\nMonument, are among the most picturesque in all New Mexico. Its walls\r\nare three feet thick and were put together with intricate care. In its\r\ntime, it must have been a beautiful building.\r\n\r\nThe second, San Juan de Los Jemez Mission, was built in 1617 at a\r\nvillage located near the junction of the Guadalupe and Jemez rivers, six\r\nmiles north of the present pueblo. The ruins are faint but still\r\nvisible. The mission was abandoned in 1680.\r\n\r\nThe third mission had a very brief history. It was called San Jose de\r\nlos Jemez Mission and was located near San Juan de Los Jemez, of which\r\nit was a _visita_. Like San Juan, San Jose was abandoned in 1680.\r\n\r\nThe present mission was founded early in the eighteenth century and is\r\none of the interesting things to visit at Jemez Pueblo. This old church\r\nis the center of the annual festival held at Jemez on November 12.\r\n\r\nJemez is noted for its splendid presentation of the Buffalo Dance in the\r\nwinter and for its Corn Dances during the November festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Laguna Pueblo\r\n\r\nLaguna Pueblo is the youngest and second largest of the pueblos in New\r\nMexico. Built in 1697, shortly after the reconquest by de Vargas, the\r\nname was derived from a large lake which existed at one time just west\r\nof the village. In addition to the main village, a number of small\r\nsettlements have developed where the terrain is suitable for\r\nagriculture, the main occupation of the Lagunas. The most important of\r\nthese villages are Paguate, Encinal, Paraje, Mesita, Seama, and Casa\r\nBlanca. The Laguna Indians are of mixed origin, composed of four\r\nlinguistic stocks: Tano, Keres, Shoshone, and Zuni.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rock-walled Santa Maria mission, Laguna Reservation]\r\n\r\nAlthough the occupation of the pueblo was traditionally agriculture, in\r\nrecent years a moderate revolution has been visible. The people of\r\nLaguna are in the middle of one of the richest uranium mining areas in\r\nthe world, and many of them have been employed in mining activities.\r\nAlso, the pueblo lies on the main line of the Santa Fe Railway, allowing\r\nsome employment with the railroad. Laguna Pueblo is one of the most\r\nprogressive of all the Indian groups in New Mexico. It has a population\r\nwell in excess of 3000.\r\n\r\nLocated at Laguna is the San Jose de Laguna mission, built in 1699. The\r\nplaster on the building is native earth. Indian symbols are painted on\r\nthe ceiling of the chancel, and a large picture of St. Joseph done on\r\nelk skin hangs on the reredos. The halos on the saints are triangular\r\nrather than circular. The altar is covered with animal skins painted\r\nwith Christian symbols.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Nambé Pueblo\r\n\r\nNambé is one of the smallest of the pueblos but is located in an area\r\nnoted for its scenic beauty and climate. Its population is less than\r\n200. It was not always so small; during the eighteenth and nineteenth\r\ncenturies, the population was greatly reduced by intertribal war and\r\nwitchcraft executions. The Nambé people played an active role in the\r\npueblo rebellion of 1680, murdering their priest and destroying their\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe original church at Nambé was one of the first missions founded after\r\nthe establishment of the first European settlement of San Gabriel at San\r\nJuan in 1598. Destroyed in 1680, it was rebuilt in 1696. In 1729, the\r\nconverts had increased to such numbers that a new church was required.\r\nThis church remained in use until 1909 when, because of carelessness in\r\nkeeping it in repair, the roof collapsed during a storm. The annual\r\nNambé fiesta is held in early October.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Picurís Pueblo\r\n\r\nPicurís is seldom visited by the tourist, for it lies in the mountains\r\nforty miles north of Santa Fe and can only be reached over a gravel\r\nroad. The people of Picurís were among the most warlike of the normally\r\npeaceful pueblo peoples. They participated actively in the pueblo\r\nrebellion in 1680, killing their priest and all the Spaniards in the\r\nvicinity. They also participated in the battle for Santa Fe which broke\r\nSpanish power in New Mexico until 1692. After the revolt, fear of the\r\nSpanish caused them to abandon their village until they were induced to\r\nreturn in 1706. The population of Picurís is very small, being slightly\r\nmore than 100.\r\n\r\nOne of the few old missions left in New Mexico, the San Lorenzo de\r\nPicurís church shows the strange mixture of Spanish and Indian\r\ntraditions. Near the door is a human skull covered with an old cloth,\r\nbut unfortunately, its story is lost to antiquity.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature at Picurís is the unusual construction seen in\r\nsome of the buildings. Made of puddled adobe, they are the oldest still\r\nstanding of any pueblo in the Rio Grande Valley. The buildings were made\r\nby pouring adobe mud into wall forms. This is the same kind of\r\nconstruction that is found at Casa Grande, Arizona, one of the\r\nsignificant prehistoric ruins in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Pojoaque Pueblo\r\n\r\nPojoaque, though still listed among the Indian villages of New Mexico,\r\nis no longer populated by Indians. Two missions were established at\r\nPojoaque in the early Spanish days, the first shortly after 1600. This\r\nwas destroyed in the rebellion in 1680. Later, in 1706, a new church was\r\nconstructed which is still in use. The Indian population of Pojoaque was\r\ngradually reduced until, in 1900, the few remaining families abandoned\r\nthe village. Since that time, Spanish-American families have occupied\r\nthe buildings. It is a picturesque village seldom seen, for it is hidden\r\nfrom the passing tourist by a hill. Yet some of the buildings in this\r\nancient village date back to pre-Coronado times and are a significant\r\npart of the romance of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Sandia Pueblo\r\n\r\nSandia Pueblo is a remnant of the Tiguex villages visited by Coronado in\r\n1540. A mission was created at Sandia shortly after the colonization by\r\nOñate, and it was an important mission center until the Pueblo Revolt.\r\nAfter the revolt, Sandia peoples scattered rather than again submit to\r\nSpanish control. Many of them went to live with the Hopi and there\r\nfounded the village of Payupki on the middle mesa, the walls of which\r\ncan still be found. After 62 years, in 1742, a few families returned to\r\nthe Rio Grande Valley to found the modern pueblo. The old mission\r\nremains visible, although reduced to a rubble of adobe. Sandia Pueblo\r\nremains a small village, containing less than 150 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           San Felipe Pueblo\r\n\r\nSan Felipe is one of the most conservative of the pueblos and has\r\nretained much of its Indian heritage despite the impact of Spanish and\r\nAmerican influences. It has a close affinity with its neighbors,\r\nparticularly Santo Domingo only five miles distant. San Felipe was a\r\nwell-established village when the Spanish first arrived. Its people\r\njoined in heartily when the pueblo uprising began in 1680 but abandoned\r\ntheir village during a Spanish counteroffensive in 1681 (which failed).\r\nWhen reconquest was completed in 1692, the people returned to their\r\nvillage. Thereafter, they remained friendly to the Spanish and suffered\r\nmany attacks from the Navajo, who hated them for this loyalty.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest remaining structures showing early Franciscan mission\r\narchitecture can be seen at the San Felipe church. The present church is\r\nnot the original mission, for three different churches were located at\r\nSan Felipe over the centuries. The first was built in 1605 and destroyed\r\nduring the Pueblo Revolt. The second was built in a new part of the\r\nvillage in 1694, but shortly after 1700, the village was moved and a new\r\nchurch constructed. The latter church is the one now in use at San\r\nFelipe. On May 1, the nearly 1000 people of the pueblo celebrate their\r\nannual fiesta.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          San Ildefonso Pueblo\r\n\r\nSan Ildefonso has gained fame throughout the world because of the\r\nexcellence of its pottery. The high quality and general acceptance of\r\nthis commodity has made the village prosperous. It boasts some of the\r\nmost famous Indian artists and artisans in the United States, among them\r\nJulian and Maria Martinez, perhaps the best-known potters in the world.\r\n\r\nSan Ildefonso participated in the Pueblo Revolt but did not contest the\r\nreconquest, at least not at first. In 1694, when de Vargas began to wage\r\nwar on the northern pueblos, San Ildefonso did take part. The people\r\nfortified themselves on Black Mesa, a high, steep mesa of volcanic\r\norigin near the pueblo. There they successfully withstood Spanish\r\nefforts to dislodge them. Notwithstanding their initial success, they\r\nwere ultimately conquered and brought into the Spanish system. Today\r\nthere are several hundred people living in the village, and they are\r\namong the friendliest of the pueblo peoples. San Ildefonso is easily\r\naccessible from Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nThe mission church dates back to the 1890’s, although earlier churches\r\nat the pueblo played an important role in bringing Christianity to the\r\nPueblo Indian world. The older churches are long since gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            San Juan Pueblo\r\n\r\nSan Juan Pueblo is best noted for its close association with the first\r\nSpanish settlement in New Mexico in 1598. Oñate, colonizer of New\r\nMexico, selected a site for his first headquarters which was a part of\r\nthe ancient Pueblo of San Juan. The natives living in that part of the\r\nvillage willingly gave up their homes to the Spaniards and were taken in\r\nby the remainder of the people of San Juan. Oñate, in appreciation for\r\nthis hospitality, bestowed upon the pueblo the name _San Juan de los\r\nCaballeros_, a name which the pueblo is still proud to bear.\r\n\r\nYet this same friendly people also contributed Po-pé, the great leader\r\nof the Pueblo Revolt, to the history of New Mexico. While Po-pé shared\r\nwith many other pueblo leaders a hatred of the Spanish conqueror, he was\r\nthe spiritual force and the organizer of the rebellion that broke the\r\ncontrol of the Spaniard for twelve years and returned New Mexico to the\r\nIndian. This great rebellion stands as one of the significant efforts in\r\nthe history of the world of a people to cast off the bonds of foreign\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nSan Juan cannot claim a church dating back to the _conquistadores_, but\r\nit does have one of the great landmark churches in the Southwest. In\r\n1890, the chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes was dedicated at San Juan. It\r\nwas constructed of red volcanic rock found west of the Rio Grande. This\r\nbeautiful structure is an architectural jewel set in desert\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nThe nearly 700 people of San Juan welcome visitors to their homes; their\r\nundecorated burnished black pottery is particularly distinctive and\r\npopular. The pueblo’s annual festival is held in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Santa Ana Pueblo\r\n\r\nSanta Ana Pueblo lies along the banks of the Rio Jemez, which enters the\r\nRio Grande from the west. The pueblo was visited by Oñate and a mission\r\nwas built there about 1600, shortly after his visit. The people of Santa\r\nAna joined in the Pueblo Revolt, and since there was no priest serving\r\ntheir church in 1680, they joined with the Indians of Santo Domingo and\r\nSan Felipe to massacre the padres at San Felipe. In 1687, during one of\r\nthe Spanish efforts to reconquer New Mexico, Santa Ana was destroyed and\r\nher people fled. Later, at the urging of de Vargas, the modern pueblo\r\nwas established, along with the church now standing there. The\r\npopulation of Santa Ana is nearly 400. Its annual festival takes place\r\nin August. It is often difficult to find many of the people at the main\r\npueblo for they spend most of the growing season at El Ranchito, to the\r\neast in the Rio Grande Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Santa Clara Pueblo\r\n\r\nSanta Clara Pueblo is near the mouth of Santa Clara Creek, a year-round\r\nstream flowing out of the Jemez Mountains into the Rio Grande. To the\r\nwest of the pueblo, on lands owned by Santa Clara, are the famous Puye\r\nCliff Dwellings ruins. The people of Santa Clara claim these natural\r\ncliff homes as their ancestral dwelling places, a fact which has been\r\nsubstantiated by archeologists. The Santa Clara Indians represent, then,\r\nan important living Indian group in which one can observe institutions\r\nand traditions that can be linked to traditions of the cultures that\r\nlived in the caves and abandoned cities of Southwest antiquity.\r\n\r\nLike most of the pueblo people, Santa Clara joined the Pueblo Revolt,\r\nbut this action did not seriously harm the pueblo. The real damage was\r\ndone to Santa Clara in the late eighteenth century when intertribal\r\nwarfare over witchcraft, plus the ravages of disease, took nearly 500\r\nlives in the village. The current population is about 500.\r\n\r\nThe church at Santa Clara is quite modern, having been constructed in\r\nthe twentieth century. The old church, built in 1760, was caught up in\r\nthe modernization craze that swept through the pueblo world in the early\r\n1900’s. Perhaps one of the most substantial and beautiful of all pueblo\r\nchurches, the old church collapsed during a storm in 1909 (the same\r\nstorm that destroyed the church at Nambé); it had been structurally\r\nweakened by the removal of the roof for remodeling.\r\n\r\nThe village has excellent agricultural lands and supplements its income\r\nby manufacturing an excellent and distinctive pure black pottery. Its\r\nannual festival is in mid-August.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Santo Domingo Pueblo\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo is one of the largest of the pueblos, having a population\r\nof nearly 1500. It is also the most conservative in retention of its\r\nnative culture. This makes its dances and dress of particular interest\r\nto the visitor to New Mexico. The present pueblo was established after\r\nthe reconquest in 1692. The Indians of Santo Domingo took a particularly\r\nactive part in the Pueblo Revolt, killing three padres resident at the\r\npueblo. When de Vargas moved to retake Santo Domingo, he found the\r\npeople had abandoned the village. They had constructed a village in the\r\nJemez Mountains to the west, and it was there that de Vargas defeated\r\nthem. Even then, the people of Santo Domingo did not give up the fight,\r\nand only after a long series of defeats and serious loss of life did\r\nthey surrender and again return to the vicinity of their original\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe church at Santo Domingo is not so old as many other pueblo edifices,\r\nbut its qualities remain among the most typical aspects of early New\r\nMexico mission architecture. In early August, during the great annual\r\nfestival, the Indians completely clean and whitewash the church. Two\r\nlarge horses are painted on the front of the building by native artists.\r\nThe dances during the Santo Domingo festival are among the most colorful\r\nand authentic in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Taos Pueblo\r\n\r\nTaos represents the northernmost of the pueblos in New Mexico. It is\r\nalso one of the most scenic, lying at the foot of the Taos Mountains, a\r\nspur of the mighty Sangre de Cristo range. It is a prosperous village of\r\nabout 900 persons. There is no finer example of pueblo apartment\r\narchitecture in New Mexico. The main pueblo building rises five stories\r\nabove the mesa. One must be careful not to confuse the Spanish town, don\r\nFernando de Taos, and the old Indian farming center, Ranchos de Taos,\r\nwith the pueblo, San Geronimo de Taos. It is the latter that is Indian\r\nand is, therefore, by far the oldest of the three.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the old San Geronimo mission at Taos represent one of the\r\nmost historic and fateful in all the Southwest. It was there that two\r\npriests were murdered in 1680 during the first days of the Pueblo\r\nRevolt. It was there that Po-pé sowed the first seeds of that rebellion.\r\nAgain in 1696, the Taos Indians sought to free themselves from Spanish\r\ncontrol by killing their priests and other Spaniards in the vicinity.\r\nAgain they were subdued. In 1847, when the Americans annexed New Mexico,\r\nthe Taos Indians tried once more to gain their independence. Inflamed by\r\nMexican citizens who refused to accept American authority, they attacked\r\nthe Americans at Fernando de Taos, killing nine of them. Governor\r\nCharles Bent, builder of the famous Bent’s Fort on the Santa Fe Trail,\r\nwas among those killed. On February 3, 1847, the American army in New\r\nMexico laid siege to the village and the Indians fortified themselves in\r\nthe mission. It became the Alamo of the Taos people. American artillery\r\nwas brought to bear, and the walls of the ancient church were battered\r\ndown; the Indians fled, first to the village and then into the\r\nmountains, leaving behind 150 dead and many wounded. They were finally\r\nforced to surrender, and their leaders were hung. Those so hung remain\r\nmartyrs to this day. The ruins of the Taos mission, built three and a\r\nquarter centuries ago, still can be seen. They are a stark landmark to\r\nthe stubborn independence of the people of Taos.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    Souvenir of the American army’s work in 1847: Taos Pueblo mission]\r\n\r\nThe traditions and ceremonials of Taos are well preserved. Their arts\r\nand crafts, however, have declined and are not of the high quality found\r\nin some of the other pueblos. Their ceremonials are excellent and are\r\nnoted for their beauty and precision. The feast day of San Geronimo,\r\nSeptember 30, is the most important event of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Tesuque Pueblo\r\n\r\nTesuque is a small village, perhaps numbering no more than 150 persons.\r\nEven though it has always been small, it holds a major place in the\r\nhistory of New Mexico. It was at Tesuque that the first blood was shed\r\nin the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. On August 9, Cristobal de Herrera was\r\nmurdered, and two Tesuque Indians rushed to Santa Fe to warn the Spanish\r\ngovernor of the impending rebellion. The Indian leaders, now aware that\r\ntheir plot was known, moved the date of the revolt from August 13 to\r\nAugust 10. On August 10, Father Pio, in charge of the Tesuque mission,\r\nwent out from Santa Fe to say Mass and also was murdered.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    Most-painted church in America?... Ranchos de Taos]\r\n\r\nAlthough its handicrafts are of poor quality, the Tesuque Indian\r\nceremonials are colorful and authentic. The people have retained much of\r\ntheir early culture while living in proximity to the white man (Santa Fe\r\nis only nine miles distant). The pueblo’s most important festival falls\r\non November 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Zia Pueblo\r\n\r\nThe story of Zia is one of tragedy and difficult problems of existence.\r\nLocated on a basalt flow on the north bank of the Jemez River some\r\nfifteen miles above its junction with the Rio Grande, Zia has poor land\r\nand a limited supply of irrigation water. Agriculture is the main\r\neconomic pursuit, but the pueblo’s unfortunate location makes trading\r\nfor part of its food supply necessary.\r\n\r\nOñate reported Zia to be a large pueblo. However, it suffered greatly\r\nbecause of its participation in the Pueblo Revolt. Some historians\r\nestimate that during the reconquest, nearly 600 of the people of Zia\r\nwere killed defending themselves from the Spanish. Continued wars and\r\npestilence reduced the pueblo to a very few families. Over the past\r\ncentury, the group has again showed signs of growth and now has a\r\npopulation of more than 300.\r\n\r\nThe church at Zia dates from 1692, and thus represents one of the fine\r\nexamples of ancient Franciscan architecture in New Mexico. The annual\r\nfestival, dedicated to Nuestra Senora de la Asuncion, is celebrated with\r\nan excellent Corn Dance on August 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Zuni Pueblo\r\n\r\nZuni has the distinction of being the first of the pueblos seen or\r\nvisited by Europeans. Seen from a distance by Fray Marcos de Niza in\r\n1539, it was reported as a rich and extensive city. Nearby were six\r\nother pueblos, and the Spanish immediately associated the Zuni complex\r\nwith an old Spanish legend about seven golden cities, the Seven Cities\r\nof Cibola. The expedition of Coronado was formed to explore and conquer\r\nthe rich pueblos of New Mexico. His first contact was at Zuni, then\r\ncalled _Hawikuh_. It was neither golden nor rich.\r\n\r\nAlthough Zuni was an important stopping place on the early trails to\r\nMexico, it managed to remain least influenced by European ideas. The\r\nSpanish concentrated their efforts in the Rio Grande Valley and Zuni\r\nwent its own way most of the time. While there were missionary efforts\r\nfrom time to time, by the nineteenth century, the stout resistance to\r\nsuch activity caused it to cease. In recent years, sporadic missionary\r\nactivity has been evident, but it has not been notably successful.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all New Mexico Indian ceremonial dances is held at\r\nZuni each year. The Shalako, which occurs in early December, is\r\nauthentic and spectacular. The dancers, carrying huge ceremonial figures\r\non their shoulders, must train and practice constantly during the entire\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nZuni is the largest of the pueblos in New Mexico, with a population\r\nnumbering more than 5000 persons. The main occupation is agriculture.\r\nThe Zunis supplement their income by manufacturing silver inlay jewelry\r\nthat shows great creative skill and is beautiful to behold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Other New Mexico Indians\r\n\r\nIn addition to the well-known Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, there are\r\nfour other areas of Indian lands. Three of these belong to peoples of\r\nAthapascan origin, sometimes better known as Apache Indians. By name,\r\nthey are the Jicarilla Apache, the Mescalero Apache, and Navajo. The\r\nfourth group is the Ute Indian.\r\n\r\nThe Apache tribes were relative newcomers to the Southwest. Their origin\r\nwas the plains area between the northern Rocky Mountains and Hudson Bay\r\nin Canada. About 1000 A.D., a part of these northern Plains Indians\r\nbegan a migration that ultimately brought them to New Mexico. Down the\r\nHigh Plains across the western Dakotas, western Nebraska, Kansas, and\r\nfinally to western Texas and eastern New Mexico, these people came. At\r\nabout the latitude of Albuquerque, the migration split. Part of the\r\ngroup continued south, across the Staked Plains, into southeastern New\r\nMexico, west Texas, and northern Coahuila and Chihuahua, Mexico. Here\r\nthey divided into the Lipan, the Mescalero, and the Natage Apache.\r\nToday, in south-central New Mexico are the descendants of the Mescalero.\r\nThe Mescalero Apache reservation is crossed by U.S. Highway 70, a scenic\r\ndrive through pine forests. The tribe operates the Sierra Blanca ski\r\narea, one of the southernmost ski areas in the United States. Its annual\r\nCrown Dance and coming-of-age ceremonials are held July 1 to 4, followed\r\nby an Apache rodeo. The Lipan and the Natage have virtually disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe second group of the migration discovered for the first time in their\r\nlong trek down the eastern fringes of the Rockies that the country\r\nopened up to the west. They poured through the passes and entered the\r\nareas traditionally controlled by pueblo farmers. Gradually, they took\r\nover these lands for themselves, driving out the farmers. By the time\r\nthe Spanish came on the scene, most of the peaceful farmers had given\r\nway before the onslaught of the warlike Athapascan savages. Only one\r\ngroup remained, the pueblos of the central Rio Grande Valley. The\r\nmigration that moved into the desert and mountain lands divided into a\r\nnumber of groups which are known by modern names: the Chiricahua, White\r\nMountain, Western, and Jicarilla Apache and the Navajo. The Jicarilla\r\nApache reside mainly in north-central New Mexico on reservation lands,\r\nand the Navajo reservation lies partly in extreme northwestern New\r\nMexico. Most of the Navajo land and all the lands of the others are in\r\nArizona.\r\n\r\nThe Ute Indians, driven from the plains by stronger tribes, settled in\r\nthe central Rocky Mountain area. There they raided the wealthy (at least\r\nin their eyes) pueblos to the south. They fought sporadically against\r\nwhite penetration but were finally subdued and placed on reservation\r\nlands in the Four Corners area, part of which lies in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhile the history of these peoples is fascinating and full of romance,\r\nthere is little besides scenery to be seen when visiting their\r\nreservations. The populations are often scattered over many hundreds of\r\nsquare miles, and the people have only rudimentary handicrafts. The\r\nexception is the Navajo, and a trip to the Navajo reservation is\r\nworthwhile. These Indians have developed techniques of weaving and\r\nsilversmithing that contribute significant art forms to Southwest\r\nhandicrafts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outstanding Indian event of the year in New Mexico is the\r\nInter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial at Gallup, held during mid-August. Some\r\nthirty tribes from the Southwest and Midwest meet to compete in arts,\r\ncrafts, and ceremonial dancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Reminders of the Past\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _by_ Paige W. Christiansen\r\n\r\nWhen driving across New Mexico or when visiting some part of the state,\r\none should be aware of the wealth of history that is always close at\r\nhand. Many people, when faced with what seems like endless miles of\r\nempty country, fail to realize that the very emptiness is one of the\r\ncharms of the state. They also do not recognize that in the vast\r\nexpanses of mountain and desert, people of the ancient past or a recent\r\npast have lived and worked and died. Sometimes the fruits of their labor\r\nare clear and evident and live on in cities and towns. In many\r\ninstances, however, the mountains and desert have reclaimed their own\r\nand the works of man have succumbed. A mental picture must be cast over\r\nthe landscape on which great historical events took place but which is\r\nalmost empty of signs of man’s efforts. If travelers are fortunate,\r\nthere may still be some sign—a ghost town, a ruined ranch, some old\r\nartifacts—to tell the story; if not, imagination must be given rein. The\r\nsearch is the adventure, and to give aid in that search, the following\r\nmight suffice as a faint guiding light.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the descriptions of these reminders of the past, New Mexico\r\nis divided into seven geographical regions which a traveler might well\r\nvisit:\r\n\r\n  1. _North from Santa Fe_, including U.S. Highways 64, 285, and 84, and\r\n  connecting state highways.\r\n\r\n  2. _The northeast_, including U.S. 85 from Santa Fe to Raton, U.S. 66\r\n  east from Albuquerque to the Texas line, U.S. 56 from Springer to the\r\n  state line, and connecting state highways.\r\n\r\n  3. _The northwest_, including U.S. 66 west from Albuquerque to the\r\n  Arizona line, U.S. 666 north from Gallup to Colorado, and State\r\n  Highway 44 from Bernalillo to Farmington.\r\n\r\n  4. _East-central_, including U.S. 60 east from Bernardo, U.S. 380 east\r\n  from San Antonio, U.S. 70 from the Mescalero Indian Reservation to the\r\n  Texas line, U.S. 285 from Clines Corners to Roswell, U.S. 54 from\r\n  Three Rivers to Santa Rosa, and connecting state highways.\r\n\r\n  5. _West-central_, including U.S. 60 west of Socorro, U.S. 180-260 and\r\n  State Highway 12 in Catron County, U.S. 85 from Los Lunas to Elephant\r\n  Butte, and connecting state highways.\r\n\r\n  6. _Southeast_, including U.S. 70 from Las Cruces to the Mescalero\r\n  Indian Reservation, U.S. 54 from El Paso to Three Rivers, U.S. 62 from\r\n  Hobbs to the Texas line, U.S. 285 from Roswell to the Texas line, and\r\n  numerous state roads.\r\n\r\n  7. _Southwest_, including U.S. 85 from Truth or Consequences to El\r\n  Paso, U.S. 180 north from Deming to the Catron county line, U.S. 70-80\r\n  west from Las Cruces to Arizona, and state roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          North From Santa Fe\r\n\r\nThe country north of Santa Fe is the heart of Indian and Spanish New\r\nMexico. Here, if he looks beyond the narrow boundaries of the highway\r\nright-of-way, the traveler can see Indian and Spanish villages which\r\nhave not changed significantly in two and a half centuries. Along the\r\nlush green of the Rio Grande Valley or of its tributaries dashing out of\r\nthe Sangre de Cristo range to the east, these sleepy concentrations of\r\npeople reveal cultural and language patterns which smack of the\r\n_conquistadores_ of the sixteenth century or of the ancient cliff\r\ndwellers. It is a slow and easy world, perhaps most representative of\r\nthe “land of mañana.” In a region already worked for centuries for what\r\nit can produce, there is no hurry. It will be there tomorrow and\r\nforever. The people of this region are typically New Mexican. The hills\r\nare dotted with piñon and juniper trees which give a greenish to black\r\ncast to the land. This, too, is typically New Mexican.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    Cool drive on a summer day, Red River Canyon]\r\n\r\nThere is one short trip that would be fruitful for him who wants to know\r\nNew Mexico, to feel the romance of Spanish culture, and to seek\r\nadventure off the beaten track. Just north of Española, State Highway 76\r\nstrikes east from U.S. 64. Nowhere in the state can be found so much of\r\nold world charm or spectacular scenic beauty. Heading east, the traveler\r\npasses through Chimayó, a village famed throughout the world for its\r\nweaving, though seldom visited, then on through Truchas and Las Trampas\r\nto Penasco, heart of the Penitente country. The Penitentes were a\r\nreligious sect growing out of long isolation from the main threads of\r\nRoman Catholicism. They gradually reverted to relatively primitive\r\nChristian practices without guidance from main church centers but within\r\nthe past few years have returned to the Church. The many white crosses\r\nthat can be seen in the area attest to their former activity. From\r\nPenasco, the traveler can return to U.S. 64 via State Highway 75.\r\n\r\nThe area northwest of Santa Fe, stretching some thirty or forty miles on\r\nthe southeast flanks of the Jemez Mountains, is the noted Pajarito\r\nPlateau, the home of great numbers of Indian cultures, living and dead.\r\nMany of the modern Indian pueblos will be found in this region. Also,\r\nsome of the most significant ancient Indian ruins are found here, such\r\nas the Frijoles Canyon (Bandelier National Monument) and Puye Cliff\r\nDwellings.\r\n\r\nThe entire area north of Santa Fe, then, is alive with history. In every\r\nvillage, in every canyon, there is something that will add to the\r\nromance of Spanish-Indian New Mexico. In our Southwest, the heritage\r\nhanded down by these two great cultures is held dear by the people. To\r\nthe traveler will come a greater appreciation and a greater\r\nunderstanding of New Mexico and the Southwest if these are but\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Northeast New Mexico\r\n\r\nThe section designated as northeast New Mexico is an area of mountains\r\nand plains, and its historical mosaic shows elements of both: the rugged\r\nSandia Mountains near Albuquerque and the southernmost parts of the\r\nextensive Sangre de Cristo range, which thrusts north from U.S. Highway\r\n85 far into Colorado, and part of the famed buffalo plains. The area is\r\ndrained by two main river systems; the Canadian River flows east to join\r\nthe Arkansas and the Mississippi and the Pecos River flows south to join\r\nthe Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThrough this vast area ran one of Americas greatest highways, the Santa\r\nFe Trail. Beginning in Missouri communities, the Trail hurled itself\r\ninto the intricate patterns of the Great Plains with all of their\r\ndangers—Indians, boredom, violent storms, treacherous rivers, and\r\nprairie grass fires. Then on into the foothills of the mighty Rocky\r\nMountains and the steep and backbreaking approaches to Raton Pass in New\r\nMexico. The new highway across this pass (U.S. 85) and the nature of our\r\nvehicles have made this an easy passage. But the traveler should pause\r\nat some high point, or perhaps leave the main highway for a moment, and\r\ntry to imagine crossing this rugged land in Conestoga wagons. From\r\nRaton, the Santa Fe Trail continued south to Las Vegas and thence into\r\nSanta Fe via Glorieta Pass (current route of U.S. 85). Over this trail\r\npassed the goods of the world. In part, these were intended for the\r\npeople of New Mexico, but over other trails they also found markets in\r\nMexico and in California. For the curious and adventurous, sections of\r\nthe Santa Fe Trail can still be seen. Local inquiry will elicit\r\ndirections to remaining parts of the wide rutted Trail, scene of so much\r\nof the American westward movement.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    How To see the Rio Grande Valley—from Sandia Crest]\r\n\r\nWhile passing through the mountains between Santa Fe and Las Vegas, the\r\ntraveler should be aware that a critical Civil War battle was waged in\r\nthe fastness of these passes. In 1862, Confederate forces, which came up\r\nthe Rio Grande from Texas and won a series of victories over Union\r\ntroops, met a combined force of Colorado Volunteers and New Mexico Union\r\ntroops in a decisive contest over the control of the American Southwest.\r\nThe Union troops were successful, preserving New Mexico and the West for\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are some of the things to look for in this region of plains\r\nand mountains. Picture buffalo by the tens of thousands pushing up the\r\nCanadian River, or long lines of wagons winding their way along the\r\nSanta Fe Trail carrying goods and people into new lands, or the Blue and\r\nthe Gray locked in deadly combat far from the thunder of the main Civil\r\nWar battles. The mosaic here is sharp and vividly different.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Northwest New Mexico\r\n\r\nNorthwest New Mexico is typified as ancient Indian country. While\r\nseemingly a harsh land, it is only this to the uninitiated, to those who\r\nlock their minds to beauties of history and lands unlike their own. The\r\nIndian found this country good and productive. Some of the finest ruins\r\nof Indian antiquity are in this region—Chaco Canyon and Aztec, both\r\nNational Monuments, and hundreds more that remain unnamed. The Indians\r\nof the Four Corners area (named thus because New Mexico, Colorado, Utah,\r\nand Arizona meet here, the only place in the United States where the\r\nlines of four states intersect) created levels of culture unsurpassed in\r\nwhat is the continental United States; only the Indians of Mexico and\r\nPeru claim a higher culture. This is a land whose ancient people reached\r\ntheir great peak at the same time as the later Romans, as Charlemagne in\r\nancient Frankish Europe, and as Mohammed and his successors in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\n\r\nBut ancient Indians hold no monopoly on this vast region. Today many of\r\nthe Indians of New Mexico still find homes here. The Navajo Reservation\r\nlies between Gallup and the Colorado line. Part of the Ute Reservation\r\nlies along the northern edge of New Mexico, and the Jicarilla\r\nReservation is in the eastern part of this region. Many of the pueblo\r\npeople are found between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. At Gallup each year,\r\nthe famed Indian Ceremonials bring together peoples from many of the\r\ntribes in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis region is also renowned as an oil and natural gas producer and is\r\none of the booming areas in New Mexico. But this is only one aspect of\r\nthe mineral riches of the northwest; the mines near Grants, between\r\nAlbuquerque and Gallup, produce tremendous quantities of uranium ores.\r\nThe atomic energy capability of the United States begins at Grants. And\r\nnear Gallup and Fruitland are huge open-pit coal mines.\r\n\r\nThe northwest is drained by the San Juan River, a tributary of the\r\nColorado River, and is therefore a part of the Pacific watershed. The\r\nNavajo Dam project, just east of Farmington, is a part of this drainage\r\npattern.\r\n\r\nThus the region is characterized by Indians old and new, ancient things\r\nburied deep beneath the earth, and great beauty in pastel colors and\r\nsubtle contrasts—the mosaic of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        East-Central New Mexico\r\n\r\nEast-central New Mexico, like the northeast, is an area of plains and\r\nmountains. Here the buffalo roamed, and in their place, cattle now\r\nutilize the hardy and nutritious grasses of the High Plains. Mountains\r\nare the Manzano, southeast of Albuquerque, and Sierra Blanca, near\r\nCarrizozo, as well as numerous minor ranges. Also in this region is some\r\nharsh and desolate country, seared by the southwestern sun and lacking\r\nin rainfall, but supporting the exotic plants and wildlife typical of\r\nthe Sonoran desert regions.\r\n\r\nWhile the desert regions may not be attractive to the eye, they should\r\nbe appreciated for their part in the historical mosaic. In the area east\r\nof the Rio Grande is the northern half of the well-known White Sands\r\nMissile Range, one of the significant test centers in the rocket and\r\nspace age. It was also in this arid region that the first atomic bomb\r\nwas exploded (southeast of Socorro).\r\n\r\nThe early use of this desert, however, emphasized its harshness. For\r\ncenturies, the Spanish suffered across this waterless waste on their way\r\nfrom Chihuahua in Old Mexico to Santa Fe, for this was the Jornada del\r\nMuerto, journey of death, the hardest and most dangerous part of the\r\ntrip over the Camino Real. The Camino Real was the lifeline of New\r\nMexico from 1598 until the Santa Fe Trail was opened in 1821, and all\r\nvisitors during that period were obliged to cross this arid section. A\r\nmodern rocket crosses in mere seconds what took the Spaniards many days.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    Who says this is desert country?... Sierra Blanca from U.S. 70]\r\n\r\nIn the Manzano Mountains, there are numerous Indian ruins which\r\nrepresent the eastern fringes of the pueblo-building Indians of New\r\nMexico. These ruined villages have been given the name by historians of\r\n“cities that died of fear,” fear of the vicious Apache and Comanche\r\ntribes. For centuries, these brave village people tilled their crops and\r\nlived peacefully on the land. Then, in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries, the great migrations of Plains Indians that pushed\r\ninto the Southwest gradually did their deadly work. One by one the\r\nvillages succumbed, until by 1700 few people remained, and these were\r\nultimately killed or driven into the sanctuary of the Rio Grande\r\npueblos. It is awesome to stand mid the rubble of one of those ancient\r\ncities and imagine the circumstances of its demise.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of this section was the heart of the High Plains\r\ncattle empires. Here is a land that once belonged to the great cattle\r\nbarons, a land of free range, the home of the cowboy. Although it is\r\nfenced today, it is still a land of cattle and is still very close to\r\nthe early days of the cattleman.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is an intricate and varied mosaic. No simple land this, but\r\na complexity of plains, mountains, and desert, all of which color its\r\nhistory. The Indians no longer inhabit their villages, the Spanish no\r\nlonger struggle along the Jornada del Muerto, and the free range of the\r\ncattle baron is gone, but if the traveler sees it through its historical\r\npast, it will again come alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        West-Central New Mexico\r\n\r\nThis section is a complex and colorful mass of landforms scattered\r\nhelter-skelter across the western part of the state. It stretches from\r\nthe green Rio Grande Valley, with its irrigated lands, quaint farms, and\r\npicturesque agricultural villages, up the Valley’s steep western slopes\r\nto the rolling grassland and mesas and alluvial fans, ending in\r\nprecipitous and treacherous canyons in the rugged mountains. Socorro\r\nMountain, the Magdalenas, the San Mateos, the Ladrones, and countless\r\nothers seem always to ring the horizon. Some of them are timbered and\r\nabound in cool, refreshing shade and springs; some are harsh and dry. In\r\nthe west, the famed San Agustin Plains stretch to the sunset, a wide\r\ncarpet fringed by black, timbered hills, site of fabulous cattle drives\r\nof a bygone day. The complexity of the region’s geology, scenery, and\r\nterrain is matched by an equally complex history.\r\n\r\nThe history is a mosaic of many hues, some harsh and stark like its dry\r\ndesert mountains, some inviting like the shade and coolness of its\r\ntimbered canyons and mountain springs. First were the many diverse and\r\nsometimes hostile Indian cultures. There were peaceful pueblo peoples\r\ntilling their lands, using the Rio Grande’s flowing water to produce\r\nabundance. Also, prehistoric village dwellers struggled to create\r\nagricultural societies along the banks of now-dry rivers in the western\r\npart of the region. And there were the fearsome Apache Indians who\r\nfounded their homes in the broken mountain fastnesses and added their\r\nexcitement and tragedy to the mosaic. So, too, did the Spaniard make his\r\nmark and the Mexican who followed close behind. The place names of the\r\neastern part of the region are primarily Spanish, although the Spanish\r\nfound the area a difficult one in which to maintain themselves. And then\r\nthe American came to dominate this land, adding realism and technology.\r\n\r\nFinally, two major economic factors left a profound imprint: stock\r\nraising and mining. The first began with the Spanish, was continued by\r\nthe Mexicans, and commercialized by the Americans. Everywhere are signs\r\nof this heritage. Mining also played a dominant role, although of a\r\nshorter duration. One can hardly lift his eyes to the hills without\r\nseeing signs of the prospectors shovel or the miner’s work. One can\r\nhardly converse with local citizens without discussing mines of the past\r\nor mines of the future. Livestock and minerals, then, are woven through\r\nthe historical pattern and are never far from any part of the story.\r\n\r\nLet the traveler be aware of several important facts when he passes\r\nthrough this region. First, this is empty country, an area that has\r\nfewer people now than it had eighty years ago. Its mines are mostly\r\nclosed and the towns that grew with the mines are ghosts. One of the\r\nmost famous of these is the town of Kelly, a short distance from the\r\ncommunity of Magdalena. Another is Mogollon, off U.S. Highway 180 in the\r\nsouthwestern part of this region. Either of these will give to the\r\nviewer a vivid picture of the mining camps of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nTo the average tourist crossing the San Agustin Plains, they seem\r\ndesolate and uninteresting. To the traveler with imagination and\r\nknowledge of the history of this once great inland lake, the trip can be\r\nexciting. He pictures this great basin full of water, forty-five miles\r\nlong and fifteen miles wide, and sees mountains covered with blue spruce\r\nsurrounding the great lake. His mental motion picture rolls on thousands\r\nof years, watching the water evaporate and the forest of spruce die, to\r\nbe replaced eventually by the piñon and juniper now dotting the hills.\r\nGrass grew in the old lake bed, except in the last areas to evaporate,\r\nfor these had an alkali content too high for most grasses. The traveler\r\nthen watches the Indian enter the scene—not the pueblo builder, except\r\nas a transient, for no water is available. The nomadic warrior uses the\r\npathway later. In 1774 and in 1776, he sees several important battles\r\nbetween the Spanish and the Apaches fought on these Plains. Later, the\r\nAmerican cattleman dominates them, as he does today....\r\n\r\nAnd so the mosaic grows—Indians, Spanish, Americans, cattle, and\r\nmines—and the spectacular vistas and the vast emptiness add color and\r\nexcitement for the traveler who sees the past with the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Southeast New Mexico\r\n\r\nMuch of southeast New Mexico is an extension of the Great Plains, but it\r\nhas some rugged mountains and a severe desert in the middle of which lie\r\nWhite Sands National Monument and the White Sands Missile Range.\r\nMountain ranges include the Sacramento east of Alamogordo and the\r\nGuadalupe Mountains, in which are located Carlsbad Caverns.\r\n\r\nThe plains part of this region are devoted to cattle, potash, and oil.\r\nLike the other plains regions of New Mexico, the heritage passed on from\r\nthe great cattle empires of bygone days is very strong and detectable in\r\nthe people. Since the early 1930’s, oil has come to play an increasingly\r\nimportant part in the history of this section. This is especially true\r\nnear Hobbs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    Anyone for a hike?... in the Guadalupe Mountains]\r\n\r\nThe desert region in the western part of this section has clearly\r\ndefined aspects of the old and the new. The southern part of the dread\r\nJornado del Muerto swept across this arid land and only returned to the\r\nriver near modern Hatch, or sometimes farther south, near modern Las\r\nCruces, according to the whim of the river. Here also lies the White\r\nSands National Monument, a desert spot of unusual beauty and interest.\r\nNear the Monument, the White Sands Missile Range stands as an advanced\r\nscientific test center for the most modern of vehicles, the rocket. Near\r\nAlamogordo, another advanced space development and testing facility is\r\nlocated at Holloman Air Force Base. So the desert is useful, and it is\r\nbeautiful, and it is full of tragic history.\r\n\r\nThis is also Indian land. East of Tularosa is the Mescalero Apache\r\nIndian Reservation. In a way, this region has always belonged to the\r\nApache, at least since he migrated into New Mexico. The area contained\r\nno sedentary groups and the Apache appropriated it as his own. His\r\nstrongholds were in the Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains. The forts\r\nalong the Rio Grande, like Forts Fillmore and Selden, were located to\r\ncontrol the Mescalero and other Apache groups. All that remains today\r\nare the Mescaleros.\r\n\r\nThere was little Spanish influence in this area except near El Paso and\r\nin the Rio Grande Valley. The Spanish were more attracted to the upper\r\nRio Grande Valley because of the sedentary nature of the Indians of that\r\nregion. The southeast underwent its greatest development in the American\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAgain, sense the mosaic: These are not blends of land and history; they\r\nare sharp and distinct, each with its own character. Search for the\r\nhistory and the beauty, for they do not come automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Southwest New Mexico\r\n\r\nFinally, the southwest, another region of harsh desert and cool\r\nrefreshing mountains, part of New Mexico’s unusual contrast. The country\r\nsouth of U.S. 70 is Sonoran desert, thinly populated and poorly watered.\r\nTo the north of the highway lies one of the most spectacular beauty\r\nspots in the Southwest, the mountains and forests forming the headwaters\r\nof the Gila River. The Gila River flows west across Arizona until it\r\njoins the Colorado River which empties into the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in this part of the state fall into two distinct categories:\r\nThe builders, known as the Mimbres culture, constructed homes in caves\r\nand along the watercourses of the Gila and Mimbres rivers. They reached\r\nextremely high levels of culture, and then they disappeared. The Apache\r\nIndians, who entered this country at the same time as they did the rest\r\nof New Mexico, were responsible for the end of the farmers and builders,\r\nat least in part. The Apaches were predators and the farmers were\r\npeaceful, unversed in the arts of war. Finally the Apache ruled supreme,\r\nand this region became the most important single stronghold of the\r\nIndian. It was here that Geronimo found sanctuary. But the Apaches, too,\r\nwere forced to surrender their claims and were placed on reservations\r\noutside this area.\r\n\r\nMining is and has been the main source of wealth. The great open-pit\r\noperation of Kennecott Copper Company is at Santa Rita, east of Silver\r\nCity. This is one of the largest open-pit copper mines in North America.\r\nTo look into that huge man-made pit is a thrilling experience. This mine\r\nwas first opened in 1803 by the Spanish who needed copper badly as a\r\ncirculating currency in New Spain (Mexico). For a number of years, the\r\ncoins used for money in Mexico were from copper mined in southwestern\r\nNew Mexico.\r\n\r\nCopper represents only a part of the mining activity in this region.\r\nFamous mining districts in earlier days were at Kingston and Hillsboro,\r\njust east of the Black Range on State Highway 90. These areas produced\r\nconsiderable quantities of silver. There is some activity yet, but the\r\nboom has long since passed them by, although they are interesting towns\r\nto visit. The trip from U.S. 85 to Silver City via State Highway 90 is\r\none of the most scenic routes in the state.\r\n\r\nIn the region north of Silver City lies high mountain country, much of\r\nit preserved as the Gila Wilderness Area. Here a person who wishes the\r\nsolitude of forest and mountain, the thrill of trout fishing in a clear\r\ncold stream, and a wealth of wildlife can find his heart’s desire. In\r\nthe heart of this wilderness, the traveler might well find some of the\r\nancient homes of the Mimbres people. History and recreation blend into\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese complete the mosaic. Everywhere one travels in New Mexico is\r\nenchanting history, in the land and/or in the people. This has not been\r\nan effort to acquaint anyone with the intricate detail of all the\r\nhistory of every nook and cranny of this land, but these broad strokes\r\nmade on the canvas may help the traveler, transient or native, to enjoy\r\nhimself. Let him accept the challenge, stop to investigate, search out\r\nevidence of the history that is there in the colorful and changing land\r\nitself, the Indian heritage, the Spanish past, the cattleman’s range,\r\nthe miner’s endless search—and become enchanted.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A., by John Whiteside_)\r\n    Wheeler Peak near Taos—highest point in New Mexico, 13,160 feet\r\n    above sea level]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Courtesy Elliott S. Barker_)\r\n    Ghost Ranch Mountain north of Abiquiu]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Derricks and Mines\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _by_ George B. Griswold\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is a mineral-rich state. The gross production value of oil,\r\ngas, and minerals was $671 million during 1963, making the state the\r\nsixth ranking mineral producer in the nation. New Mexico ranks among\r\nother states as follows: first in the production of potash, uranium,\r\nperlite, and carbon dioxide; third in helium; fourth in copper; fifth in\r\nnatural gas and liquids; and seventh in petroleum. Important amounts of\r\nzinc, lead, gold, silver, magnesium compounds, coal, gypsum, pumice, and\r\nsalt are also produced from deposits within New Mexico. The oil and gas\r\nindustry holds a dominant position in the state, accounting for almost\r\ntwo thirds of the value of minerals produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL AND GAS\r\n\r\nMost of New Mexico’s oil and gas are produced in the southeastern part,\r\nsouth and east of Roswell. The bustling towns of Hobbs, Artesia, and\r\nLovington, as well as Roswell, are headquarters for the many oil\r\ncompanies and the associated service and supply organizations operating\r\nin the area. Oil and gas are produced from numerous reservoirs, called\r\n_fields_ or _pools_, in Paleozoic sediments ranging from Ordovician to\r\nPermian in age. From the standpoint of production, the Eunice-Monument\r\nfield (lying between these two towns) is the largest, having produced\r\nmore than 250 million barrels of oil. Other important fields are Hobbs,\r\nVacuum, Langlie Mattix, Denton, and Jalmat. All these fields produce a\r\nconsiderable amount of gas associated directly with the oil.\r\n\r\nWhen driving an automobile through southeast New Mexico, a layman finds\r\nit difficult to comprehend the immensity of the petroleum industry of\r\nthat region. This is due to the scattering of wells over a large area.\r\nSeldom are wells spaced closer than one to every ten acres, even in the\r\nmost productive fields. There are, in fact, some 16,000 wells in this\r\npart of New Mexico, ranging in depth from less than 1000 feet to 17,555\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe other oil- and gas-producing area of the state is in the northwest,\r\nin the San Juan Basin. Farmington serves as the base of operations for\r\nmost of this activity. In 1962, there were 7378 wells in the area, 1770\r\nof which were producing oil and gas and 5608 producing gas only. Most of\r\nthe San Juan Basin production is from Cretaceous sandstones, in contrast\r\nto the southeast where the oil and gas are derived from Paleozoic\r\nsediments. The development of the San Juan Basin production is\r\nrelatively new; most of the wells have been drilled since World War II.\r\nThe petroleum industry can be proud of the great help it has given to\r\nthe development of this once-almost-forgotten part of the state.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Courtesy El Paso Natural Gas Co._)\r\n    There’s the way to refine oil! Look at those mesas, near Gallup]\r\n\r\nThe methods of finding and producing oil and gas have come a long way\r\nfrom the “boom town” days when wells were drilled for the most part on\r\npure hunches and hopes. The exploration and exploitation of petroleum\r\nare now highly specialized technologies. All branches of the geologic\r\nand geophysical sciences are brought into play to piece together a\r\ncomprehensive picture of all the factors which may have made a certain\r\narea favorable for the accumulation of oil or gas. These factors include\r\nsuch things as the age, thickness, and permeability of the sedimentary\r\nrocks, the structure, old shorelines, and buried reefs. Once a target is\r\nselected, a drilling rig is moved onto the location to prove or disprove\r\nthe theory. This is the costly step of finding oil. A single 10,000-foot\r\nhole may cost $350,000, and some individual wells in New Mexico have\r\ncost more than $1 million to drill. If the well is in a completely\r\nuntested area, it is called a “wildcat.” Once a discovery is made, then\r\nthe land around the wildcat is explored by “offset” wells until the\r\ncomplete extent of the new field is proved.\r\n\r\nDuring 1962, 1666 wells were drilled to an average depth of 5153 feet.\r\nThe average drilling cost was $71,000 a well, representing a total\r\ninvestment of almost $120 million in a single year! Most of these wells\r\nwere of the development (offset) type, but even then, 27 per cent were\r\ndry. During 1962, 295 true wildcats were drilled; of these, only 46\r\nfound oil or gas—about two out of every thirteen.\r\n\r\nThe story of oil just begins with the discovery of a well. Various\r\nspecial “completion” operations are applied to the oil-producing horizon\r\nso as to increase the flow into the well. The most common techniques are\r\neither by “acidizing,” pumping acid into the formation to increase flow\r\nby enlarging the pores in the rock, or by “hydrafracing,” whereby actual\r\ncracks are induced in the formation by pumping oil from the surface back\r\ninto the well under very high pressure. After the well is “completed,”\r\nit may be a natural-flowing well if sufficient gas is associated with\r\nthe oil. If sufficient gas is not present, then the well is pumped.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, considerable success has been achieved in revitalizing\r\nold fields where production had dropped below the point of economic\r\noperation. These fields are reactivated by forcing either water or gas\r\ndown selected wells within the field, thereby forcing stagnated oil\r\nwithin the producing zone toward the other wells. This technique is\r\ncalled _secondary recovery_. Many fields will produce more oil under the\r\nsecondary recovery program than they did during their primary life.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Here’s a wildcat for you!]\r\n\r\nOnce the oil is on the surface, it passes through separators to remove\r\nany admixed gas from the oil. The gas is sent into pipelines while the\r\noil is sent to storage tanks called _tank batteries_. Periodically, the\r\noil is drawn from the tank batteries where it is transported by pipeline\r\nor rail to refineries. The great bulk of the crude oil leaves New Mexico\r\nfor refining via a major pipeline network extending through Texas to\r\nboth the Gulf and East coasts. Some oil is refined in New Mexico,\r\nhowever. Oil refineries in Artesia, Bloomfield, Ciniza, Farmington, and\r\nMonument have a combined capacity to treat some 30,000 barrels (42\r\ngallons a barrel) of crude oil a day. On the other hand, practically all\r\nthe natural gas is treated in New Mexico so as to recover its liquid\r\npetroleum constituents before sending it out of the state by pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINING\r\n\r\nThe mining industry of New Mexico dates back to the days of Spanish\r\nrule. Copper was mined from the Santa Rita mine as early as 1800 for\r\nshipment to Mexico for use in coinage. Significant mining in New Mexico\r\ndid not commence, however, until the late 1800’s. There are three major\r\ncenters today: Carlsbad, potash; Silver City area, copper, zinc, and\r\nlead; and Grants, uranium.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Question: where are the other oil pumps and tanks in\r\n    the San Juan Basin?]\r\n\r\nThe potash mining east of Carlsbad, a $75 million-a-year industry\r\nemploying more than 3600 persons, is the largest operation of its kind\r\nin the world. Six mining companies are active in the area, and a seventh\r\nis developing yet another mine. _Potash_ is a word used to denote\r\nvarious potassium compounds. The principal ore mineral at Carlsbad is\r\nsylvanite, a mixture of potassium chloride and sodium chloride (common\r\nsalt). The ore contains the equivalent of 21 to 25 per cent potassium\r\noxide (K₂O).[6] Another ore mineral, known as _langbeinite_, a double\r\nsalt of potassium and magnesium sulfate, is also mined.\r\n\r\nThe potash ores occur as horizontal beds sandwiched between thick salt\r\nand anhydrite layers. These beds are the result of evaporation of large\r\nquantities of salt waters during the latter part of the Permian period\r\nsome 240 million years ago. The potash-bearing horizons now are buried\r\nfrom 900 to 1800 feet below the surface. The discovery of potash in\r\nsoutheast New Mexico was almost by accident. In 1925, the Snowden and\r\nMcSweeny Company drilled a wildcat oil test a few miles east of\r\nCarlsbad. The hole was dry, but potash minerals were detected in the\r\ndrill cuttings. The discovery generated considerable interest because\r\nthe United States was forced to import most of its potash prior to this\r\ntime. Further drilling proved the existence of tremendous deposits of\r\npotassium salts in that area.\r\n\r\nThe potash mines are among the most highly mechanized of the mineral\r\nindustry. Access to the buried deposits is gained by vertical shafts.\r\nActual mining is now done to a large extent by continuous miners,\r\nmachines which bore or rip the potash ore from the face and load it into\r\nshuttle cars in one continuous operation. The shuttle cars then\r\ntransport the ore to conveyor belts which move it to the shafts for\r\nhoisting. Working conditions and safety are excellent and have led to\r\nhigh productivity from these mines.\r\n\r\nThe potash ore is refined or processed by fractional crystallation or\r\nflotation. These plants remove most of the unwanted sodium chloride and\r\nother gangue minerals to produce high-quality potassium chloride or\r\nsulfate. After processing, the potash salts are stored in giant bins to\r\nawait shipment by rail to the major agriculture areas of the United\r\nStates. The Carlsbad mines produce some 15 million tons of ore a year\r\nwhich, when refined, produces 4 million tons of marketable potassium\r\nsalts having a K₂O equivalent of 2.5 million tons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Courtesy International Minerals & Chemical Corp._)\r\n    Crunch!... continuous mining machine at work]\r\n\r\nUranium mining is the newest major industry in New Mexico. The boom\r\nstarted in 1950 with the discovery of uranium ore west of Grants by a\r\nNavajo sheep rancher named Paddy Martinez. This discovery started one of\r\nthe most extensive exploration and development campaigns in all mining\r\nhistory. By 1957, the area had proved uranium reserves accounting for\r\nmore than half of the entire reserve of the nation. These discoveries\r\nwill make this country self-sufficient in this vital atomic energy metal\r\nfor years to come. Five mills were built that are capable of producing\r\n“yellow cake” (almost pure uranium oxide) from uranium ores containing\r\nas little as 0.20 per cent U₃O₈. Four mills are located in the Grants\r\narea, ranging in capacity from 1500 to 4000 tons a day. The fifth mill,\r\nrated at 500 tons a day, is at Shiprock.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous mines, ranging from tiny two-man operations up to\r\ngreat mines producing more than 1000 tons a day. The most prolific\r\nproducing area is the Ambrosia Lake District north of Grants; most of\r\nthese mines are underground. Probably the largest single uranium mine,\r\nhowever, is the open-pit Jackpile-Paguate mine of the Anaconda Company\r\non the Laguna Indian Reservation some thirty miles east of Grants. The\r\nmine uses electric shovels capable of loading eight cubic yards of ore\r\nat a time into large diesel trucks.\r\n\r\nCopper is produced from the Chino mine located at Santa Rita, about\r\nfifteen miles east of Silver City. This mine, operated by Kennecott\r\nCopper Corporation, is the showpiece of the New Mexico minerals\r\nindustry. The copper ore is low grade, containing only sixteen pounds a\r\nton of the red metal, but the deposit is immense, allowing the mining of\r\n22,500 tons a day. The Chino is by far the largest single mining\r\noperation in the state. A large concentrator and smelter are located at\r\nHurley, about ten miles southwest of the pit.\r\n\r\nThe Chino pit is a spectacular sight for its scenic setting and its\r\nsheer size. The deposit is located below the Kneeling Nun, a famous\r\nnatural statue formed by the erosion of a rhyolite flow which caps a\r\nhigh mesa. The pit covers almost one square mile and is 800 feet deep.\r\nThe mining is highly mechanized. Large rotary drills make blast holes\r\ntwelve inches in diameter into which explosives are loaded. A single\r\nblast may break 100,000 tons of rock. The ore is loaded with\r\n8-cubic-yard shovels into large trucks carrying from 25 to 65 tons each.\r\nThe trucks transport the ore to an inclined skipway on the west end of\r\nthe pit. The skip then carries the ore up to the train level where it is\r\ntransferred into railroad cars for shipment to the mill. Waste rock, too\r\nlow-grade to justify sending to the mill, is transported to the very top\r\nof the skip way, where it is trucked to the dumps. At Chino, much of the\r\nwaste rock contains some copper. The amount is small, but a part of it\r\ncan be recovered by leaching-percolating water down through the rock to\r\ndissolve the copper. At the bottom of the dumps, the copper-rich water\r\nis collected and sent through precipitating tanks containing scrap iron.\r\nThe copper plates out on the iron, forming metallic copper. The\r\ndump-leaching program alone at Chino is a substantial enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe concentrator and smelter at Hurley is the facility which reduces the\r\nlow-grade ore into pure metal. The concentrator first crushes and grinds\r\nthe ore, then recovers the copper-bearing minerals (principally\r\nchalcocite and chalcopyrite) by flotation. The concentrate of these\r\ncopper sulfides is taken to the smelter to make metallic copper.\r\n\r\nNorth and west of the Chino mine are important deposits of zinc and\r\nlead. Two underground mines are now active: the Hanover of the New\r\nJersey Zinc Company and the Kearney—Pewabic of American—Peru Mining\r\nCompany. Although dwarfed by the Chino mine, these are important\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Courtesy The Anaconda Co._)\r\n    Man, dig this hole!... Jackpile open-pit uranium mine near Laguna]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Courtesy Kennecott Copper Corp._)\r\n    “Just scoop up copper ore, take it to the skipway....” up the side\r\n    of the Chino Mine at Santa Rita]\r\n\r\nCopper, potash, and uranium are not the only mining operations of New\r\nMexico. Perlite is recovered from deposits near No Agua in Taos County\r\nand just north of Grants. Two new gypsum plants are now operating\r\nnortheast of Albuquerque, and a cement plant is located east of that\r\ncity. High-grade copper veins are worked south of Lordsburg. Coal mining\r\nis being reactivated, with producing mines near Gallup, Fruitland, and\r\nRaton. A new molybdenum mine is under development east of Questa. New\r\nMexico’s mineral industry is on a broad and firm base.\r\n\r\nMines and derricks are ever-present aspects of New Mexico’s landscapes;\r\nthey are seen by every citizen of the state and every tourist as he\r\ntravels across the plains, valleys, and mountains. The derricks and the\r\nmine openings are merely surface features through which the vast wealth\r\nof the underground is exploited, but they are a monetarily important\r\npart of New Mexico’s scenery, rocks, and history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Enchanting Landscapes\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _by_ Frank E. Kottlowski\r\n\r\nThe visitor and the native may be well acquainted with the more famous\r\nscenic places in New Mexico. Most of these are National or State Parks\r\nor Monuments—glistening dunes of White Sands, sandstone cliffs of El\r\nMorro, canyons eroded in volcanic rocks of Bandelier, the recent volcano\r\nof Capulin Mountain, multicolored sinkholes at Bottomless Lakes,\r\ngrotesque carvings of volcanic rocks at City of Rocks, and the black\r\ntongues of cooled lava in the Valley of Fires State Park near Carrizozo.\r\n\r\nMany of the lesser-known spectacular scenic areas are off the beaten\r\npath, far from the seventy-mile-an-hour Interstate highways. Even a\r\nbrief description of all would fill a thick book. But near the most\r\ntraveled routes are numerous enchanting landscapes. The traveler from\r\nthe midwest or east, driving U.S. Highway 66 (Interstate 40) breaks over\r\nthe edge of the “caprock” a few miles east of the New Mexico—Texas line.\r\nAtop the caprock is Llano Estacado, the Staked Plains, a level surface\r\nstretching along the southeast edge of New Mexico eastward into Texas.\r\nAs seen south of Tucumcari near Ragland, east of Fort Sumner near\r\nTaiban, or east of Roswell near Kenna and Caprock, the bluffs of the\r\nLlano Estacado are topped by caprock, a cliff of white caliche-limestone\r\nas much as forty feet thick in places. Below, on gentle to steep slopes\r\nreaching northward toward Tucumcari or westward toward Fort Sumner and\r\nRoswell, are the varicolored red, purple, green, and gray shales and\r\nsandstones of Triassic age. Red Lake near Taiban on U.S. Highway 60-84\r\nlies in the red muds of these Triassic rocks.\r\n\r\nSouth of Tucumcari, rising boldly from the red-earth lowlands draining\r\nto the Canadian River, are Tucumcari Mountain and Mesa Redonda, and to\r\nthe northwest the long buff cliffs of Mesa Rica. The latter mesa lies\r\nnorth of Interstate 40 as far west as Newkirk. Patches of the white\r\ncaprock caliche-limestone cap these eastern New Mexico sentinels,\r\nwhereas in other localities, the brown Dakota Sandstone tops the buttes\r\nand is underlain by pink Jurassic sandstones, with the mesa bases made\r\nup of the Triassic redbeds.\r\n\r\nNear Santa Rosa, Interstate 40 dips down into the narrow green valley of\r\nRio Pecos. Roadcuts lining the steep hills into the city show the red\r\nand brown sandstones and shales of the Triassic beds.\r\n\r\nDriving westward from Santa Rosa, one crosses rolling hills near Clines\r\nCorners, then dips gently down into the northern part of the Estancia\r\nBasin near Moriarty. To the north on the horizon are the snow-capped\r\npeaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. From Moriarty, Interstate 40\r\npulls slowly upward toward Edgewood into the eastern foothills of the\r\nSandia Mountains, the grassy plains giving way to juniper and piñon\r\ngroves.\r\n\r\nFrom the downgrade into Tijeras Canyon, State Highway 10 leads north to\r\nSan Antonito and the turnoff to Sandia Crest. The crest road winds up\r\ncanyon walls, on sloping limestone mesas, up through thick stands of\r\nponderosa pine, aspen, and, near the top, Engelmann spruce and corkbark\r\nfir. Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep may be seen off the road on the high\r\ncrags. From Sandia Crest, 10,678 feet above sea level, much of\r\nnorth-central New Mexico is visible; Mount Taylor to the west, the\r\nNacimiento and Jemez mountains to the northwest, the mighty Sangre de\r\nCristo Mountains to the northeast, and countless ranges to the south and\r\nsouthwest. The city of Albuquerque is spread out at the base of the\r\nSandias, and the twisting north-south channel of the Rio Grande\r\nstretches, glistening, as far left and right as one can see.\r\n\r\nFrom Tijeras, Interstate 40 plunges into Tijeras Canyon, slicing through\r\nvertical roadcuts in Pennsylvanian limestones and shales, then through\r\nthe ancient Precambrian granite. At the canyons mouth, the road levels\r\noff on the broad alluvial plain on which much of east Albuquerque is\r\nbuilt, although the “downtown” is really down, in the valley of the Rio\r\nGrande.\r\n\r\nWestward, Interstate 40 rolls up out of the valley, crosses windswept\r\nplains spotted with black volcanic cones, in and out of the shallow\r\nbrown valley of Rio Puerco, and then to the red-cliff-bordered valley of\r\nRio San Jose. Cliffs are of brown, buff, and light-gray Jurassic\r\nsandstones, with the valley carved in Triassic redbeds. Near Laguna, on\r\nthe north side of the valley, white gypsum of the Todilto Formation\r\ncrops out. Then through the pink Jurassic cliffs the canyon winds, and\r\nnear New Laguna, the highway is bordered by the varicolored,\r\nuranium-bearing Morrison beds, which are overlain by brown sandstones\r\nand black shales of Cretaceous age.\r\n\r\nBut as Interstate 40 approaches Grants, the dominant feature is black\r\nfrozen lava. The mesas surrounding Mount Taylor are capped by black\r\nbasalt, built up in many layers, each individual flows, and loose blocks\r\ntumble down on the hillsides. Young basalt, twisted and wrinkled as if\r\nit were still hot, winds along the valley; just east of Grants, a huge\r\n“field” of this recent basalt stretches southward beyond the horizon.\r\nAnd above all looms Mount Taylor, remnant of an ancient volcano,\r\nsnow-capped in winter, towering 11,389 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nAt Casa Blanca, southeast of Mount Taylor, State Road 23 leads south to\r\nAcoma Pueblo. Eleven miles to the southwest, Enchanted Mesa, _Katsim_ as\r\nit is called by the Acomas, towers 450 feet above the surrounding valley\r\nfloor. This sheer-cliffed rock is built by layers of (from the base to\r\nthe top) pink and white Entrada Sandstone, gray Todilto limestone, pink\r\nand green Summerville beds, a massive cliff of light-tan Zuni Sandstone,\r\nand a cap of yellow-brown Dakota Sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe top of Enchanted Mesa is inaccessible by normal means. Legend has it\r\nthat once the Acomas lived there, and there are Indian ruins up on the\r\nisolated rim. A terrific rain and lightning storm, one summer day, sent\r\nhuge waterfalls down the sides of the mesa, tearing away large blocks of\r\nsandstone, and destroyed the trail to the top, a series of narrow zigzag\r\nledges and toeholds in crevasses. Thus the Acoma Indians moved a few\r\nmiles to the southwest to Acoma, onto the top of another sheer cliff, a\r\nrock fortress carved in Zuni Sandstone and capped by Dakota Sandstone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Talk about wide open spaces ... around the Enchanted\r\n    Mesa]\r\n\r\nSouthwest of Grants, the forested Zuni Mountains rise, bordered on the\r\nnorth by a valley cut in Triassic redbeds and on the east by the recent\r\nblack basalt flows. The hurrying traveler will follow Interstate 40 to\r\nGallup around the north edge of the Zuni dome, flanked on the north by\r\nthe spectacular pink, red, brown, and gray cliffs of Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous sandstones. If one has time, take the low road, State\r\nHighways 53 and 36, around the southern edge of the Zunis. For almost\r\ntwenty miles, passing through San Rafael, the paved highway parallels\r\nthe west edge of the Grants black basalt flow; then up over low ridges\r\nand past black cinder cones toward El Morro. In the lava tunnels,\r\nperpetual ice stays hidden from the sun; these can be visited at Ice\r\nCaves.\r\n\r\nEl Morro, Inscription Rock, with its towering cliffs of Zuni Sandstone,\r\noverlooks peaceful green valleys; farther west, the red and brown\r\nsandstones are carved into many mesas and buttes near Zuni Pueblo. Then\r\nnorthward to Gallup, swinging around the west edge of the Zuni\r\nMountains, the roller-coaster highway, State 36, cuts through ponderosa\r\npine country, bordered by Cretaceous brown sandstones, black shales, and\r\ncoal beds.\r\n\r\nNortheast of Gallup eight miles is Kit Carson’s Cave, a gaping door on\r\nthe face of a massive cliff of Jurassic sandstone. A pool of cool water\r\nlies along its floor. The three-and-a-half-mile drive north of\r\nInterstate 40 is through a vast broken country of sandstone spires,\r\npyramids, cliffs, and ledges carved in the Jurassic rocks. Near Gallup,\r\nthe drab coal-bearing Cretaceous beds form the landscapes, but westward\r\nnear the Arizona line, erosion has cut down again to the brilliantly\r\ncolored Jurassic rocks, and Interstate 40 is escorted westward into the\r\nGrand Canyon State by cliffs of white and pink sandstone.\r\n\r\nCalifornians crossing New Mexico in the winter are likely to travel U.S.\r\nHighway 70-80 (Interstate 10) eastward. New Mexico is entered just\r\nbefore Steins Pass, which is channeled through the tan and green\r\nvolcanic rocks of the Peloncillo Mountains. Then down across the mud and\r\nsalt marshes of Alkali Flats lying in the Animas Valley and up onto the\r\nnorth edge of the Pyramid Mountains into Lordsburg. Mine dumps dot the\r\nPyramids, and the ghost mining town of Shakespeare lies amid the purple\r\nvolcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nEastward from Lordsburg for 118 miles are the Antelope Plains; plains,\r\nplains, plains. Steers graze on the sparse grass, yucca clumps border\r\nthe highway, and here and there sand dunes flee before the restless\r\nwinds. Mountain ranges, like islands on the sea of grass, yucca, and\r\ncreosote bush, rise in the distance. West of Deming, the low Victorio\r\nMountains lie south of the highway, made up of dolomite, limestone, and\r\nandesite ridges. Southeast of Deming are the lofty Florida Mountains,\r\ntheir northern toe crossed by Interstate 10. Volcanic hills dot the\r\nlandscape east of Las Cruces, Sierra de las Uvas’ purple slopes to the\r\nnorth, and the Potrillo Mountains and Mount Riley to the south. The\r\nlatter are part of a spectacular volcanic field where black cinder cones\r\nand basalt flows cover hundreds of square miles, and craters such as\r\nKilbourne Hole are sunk below the plains.\r\n\r\nThe descent into the Rio Grande Valley is awesome, especially if the\r\nlate afternoon sun is dancing on the spires and cliffs of the Organ\r\nMountains to the east. From across the brown plains, Interstate 10 winds\r\ndown into the green Mesilla Valley, a different world of cotton and\r\nalfalfa fields, pecan and cottonwood groves, and red-tile-roofed Spanish\r\nhomes. The view of the Organ Mountains alone is worth the trip.\r\n\r\nAt Las Cruces, a city booming on cotton, rockets, and tourists,\r\nInterstate 10 turns south to parallel the east side of the Rio Grande\r\nValley down to Texas and El Paso. If one prefers a quiet scenic route,\r\nState Highway 28 winds its way along the west side of the Valley amid\r\nfields and groves, through peaceful villages, to end at the bridge over\r\nthe Rio Grande on the edge of El Paso. Here, to the south, is El Cristo\r\nRey, a cone of massive andesite, flanked by steeply tilted beds of\r\nlimestone and shale, Early Cretaceous in age, cut in two by the New\r\nMexico-Mexico border. Atop the peak is a 29-foot-high, 40-ton, limestone\r\nstatue of Christ; a winding path leads upward from the base for those\r\nstrong enough of limb to make the climb. Beyond, to the south, Ciudad\r\nJuarez lies, famous for its bordertown flavor, markets, cathedrals, and\r\nbull rings.\r\n\r\nThe traveler to the east should stay on U.S. 62-180 from El Paso. This\r\nhighway cuts through the Hueco Mountains via Powwow Canyon, a gash\r\ncarved from Pennsylvanian and Permian limestones, crosses the Diablo\r\nPlateau, rolls past the white patches of Salt Flat lakes, then winds up\r\nto the summit of Guadalupe Pass between the Delaware Mountains on the\r\nsouth and the towering Guadalupe Mountains on the north. Looking north\r\nfrom the Pass, Guadalupe Peak, highest point in Texas, and El Capitan\r\nare unforgettable sights, their steep lower slopes ribbed brown and\r\ngreen, overshadowed by the 1000-foot limestone cliffs of the peaks. The\r\nlimestone-hewn Guadalupe Mountains parallel the highway in New Mexico\r\nand are pitted with many caves, with Carlsbad Caverns the largest known\r\nin the range. Eastward beyond the Pecos Valley stretches the Great\r\nPlains and Texas.\r\n\r\nA side trip, near Carlsbad, over black-topped and gravel roads leads\r\nfrom Seven Rivers, up Rocky Arroyo on State Road 137, into the northern\r\nfoothills of the Guadalupe Mountains to Sitting Bull Falls. Here, cool\r\nspring waters cascade over limestone ledges to join in green pools lying\r\namid the cottonwood groves of the canyon floor.\r\n\r\nLake McMillan, a reservoir along the Pecos River north of Carlsbad, and\r\nthe many potash mines east of Carlsbad are parts of the enchanting\r\nlandscapes of this southeastern corner. Northward, following the green\r\ncotton fields bordering the Pecos River, U.S. Highway 285 leads through\r\nArtesia with its oil refineries to modern booming Roswell, second city\r\nof the state. East of Roswell, bordering the east side of the Pecos\r\nValley, is Bottomless Lakes, azure blue pools spotted in sink holes.\r\n\r\nEastward from Roswell, on either U.S. Highway 70 or 380, redbeds of\r\nPermian and Triassic age lie half hidden by pinkish sands up to the edge\r\nof the caprock; beyond are the fertile grazing and crop lands of the\r\nLlano Estacado, with its queen cities of Clovis and Portales. Here, deep\r\nwells pump underground waters to irrigate lush fields that produce\r\npeanuts, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, melons, strawberries, cucumbers, and\r\ngrapes. On the plains beyond the reach of the wells, wheat, maize, and\r\nbroomcorn are grown. Southeastward, oil derricks dot the plains,\r\nsurrounding Hobbs and Lovington.\r\n\r\nWestward from Roswell, U.S. Highways 70 and 380 run together up the\r\nrolling limestone hills west of the Pecos Valley before plunging down\r\nPicacho Hill into the narrow canyon of Rio Hondo. At Hondo they divide.\r\nU.S. Highway 380 leads northwestward through Lincoln town, Billy the\r\nKid’s shooting grounds, into Capitan, over Indian Divide, and down into\r\nsleepy Carrizozo—paralleled by the forested peaks of Capitan Mountains\r\nto the north and overshadowed by mighty Sierra Blanca to the southwest.\r\nU.S. Highway 70 runs up the green canyon of Rio Ruidoso, past Ruidoso\r\nDowns, past State Highway 37 which leads to Ruidoso and the Sierra\r\nBlanca Ski Area, up into the ponderosa pines, crossing the divide at\r\nApache Summit, then westward and downhill past Mescalero, paralleling\r\nRio Tularosa. Suddenly the canyon widens, and ahead is the dry Tularosa\r\nBasin with the White Sands glistening in the far distance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_Forest Service, U.S.D.A._)\r\n    Now this is what is meant by forest.... from Monjeau Lookout]\r\n\r\nFrom Tularosa to Alamogordo, U.S. Highway 70 is along the west edge of\r\nthe Sacramento Mountains wherein tier upon tier of dolomite and\r\nlimestone cliffs rise to the high peaks near Cloudcroft. Southwestward\r\nfrom Alamogordo, the highway cuts diagonally across the Tularosa Basin,\r\nskirting the southern edge of the White Sands, and passing through White\r\nSands Missile Range. Ahead lie the fabulous spires of the Organ\r\nMountains; to the right, the notched cliffs of the San Andres Mountains\r\nstretch northward to rounded Salinas Peak and beyond the horizon.\r\nSteeply, the highway rises to cross San Augustin Pass between the Organ\r\nand San Andres mountains, past the village of Organ with its crumbling\r\nmining dumps, before plunging downward onto the southern end of Jornada\r\ndel Muerto, and finally, on the east edge of Las Cruces, leaves the\r\ncreosote bush plains to dip into the green Mesilla Valley of the Rio\r\nGrande.\r\n\r\nWest of Carrizozo, U.S. 380 crosses the black basalt flows of Valley of\r\nFires State Park, curves over the Carrizozo dome and up the dip slopes\r\nof Chupadera Mesa, crosses in red roadcuts the northern tip of Sierra\r\nOscura, then westward through sand dunes of the northern Jornada del\r\nMuerto. Coal beds crop out at Cerro Colorado before the highway sweeps\r\ndown into the Rio Grande Valley to San Antonio.\r\n\r\nU.S. Highway 60 enters the state from the east on the Staked Plains near\r\nbooming Clovis, crosses Rio Pecos Valley at Fort Sumner—near Billy the\r\nKid’s grave—goes straight as a beeline over the plains to Vaughn, then\r\ncrosses the low southern end of the Pedernal Hills where tan Permian\r\nsandstones lie abruptly on Precambrian granite, quartzite, and schists.\r\nNear Willard, the highway crosses the southern end of the Estancia\r\nValley, with the salt lakes of Laguna del Perro mere remnants of the\r\nhuge Pleistocene lake that once filled the Valley. West from\r\nMountainair, Abo redbeds border the highway; limestone walls of Gran\r\nQuivira lie to the south and the red sandstone church ruins of Abo and\r\nQuarai are to the north. Through Abo Pass between the Manzano and Los\r\nPinos mountains the highway runs, then down the long alluvial fan slopes\r\nto the Rio Grande Valley at Bernardo. From Bernardo to Socorro, U.S.\r\nHighway 60 joins Interstate 25; westward from Socorro, the road climbs\r\nout of the Valley onto Snake Ranch Flats, parallels the snow-tipped\r\nMagdalena Mountains to Magdalena, then crosses the north end of the\r\ngrassy San Agustin Plains. Westward to Datil and Quemado, the highway is\r\nalways in sight of volcanic mountains, up and down winding canyons, and\r\nacross intermontane plains.\r\n\r\nStill westward into Arizona along U.S. Highway 60 are Springerville,\r\nfabulous Salt River Canyon, the mining cities of Globe, Miami, and\r\nSuperior, and booming Phoenix.\r\n\r\nInto this west-central New Mexico country of volcanic peaks and grassy\r\nplains comes U.S. Highway 180 from Deming northwestward. Along the\r\nscenic, winding route are City of Rocks, the copper smelter at Hurley,\r\nSanta Rita’s huge open-pit copper mine, famous Silver City, colorful\r\ncanyons of the Gila and San Francisco rivers, and, crossed by passes or\r\nbordering all routes, the rugged rhyolite, andesite, and basalt ledges\r\nand cliffs.\r\n\r\nFrom El Paso to Raton Pass, 515 miles, U.S. Highway 85 (Interstate 25)\r\ncrosses New Mexico from south to north, from Mexico to Colorado. As far\r\nas La Bajada Hill, between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, the highway\r\nparallels the Rio Grande. Northward from El Paso, past Las Cruces to\r\nRadium Springs and old Fort Selden, the green Mesilla Valley borders the\r\nroute; then through Selden Canyon into the Hatch Valley near San Diego\r\nMountain, and along the west side of the bold cliffs of the Caballo\r\nMountains, past Caballo Reservoir to Truth or Consequences (old Hot\r\nSprings). Eastward lies Elephant Butte Dam and reservoir; the road cuts\r\nacross alluvial plains to the west of the Rio Grande all the way to\r\nAlbuquerque, with the mountains to the west the San Mateo, Magdalena,\r\nSocorro, and Ladron and to the east, the Fra Cristobal, Los Pinos, and\r\nManzano.\r\n\r\nIntersecting Interstate 40 at Albuquerque, the Pan-American Central\r\nHighway, Interstate 25 crosses to the east side of the Rio Grande, the\r\nsheer cliffs of the Sandia Mountains to the east and the distant dark\r\ngreen Jemez Mountains to the northwest. Crossing Galisteo Creek\r\nnortheast of Santo Domingo Pueblo, Interstate 25 turns toward the\r\nnortheast, climbs La Bajada Hill, onto the green plains sloping from\r\nSanta Fe. Santa Fe, the ancient capital city, is nestled on the edge of\r\nthe Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Southeastward and eastward, U.S. Highway\r\n85 (to be Interstate 25 here) rolls, skirting the southern end of the\r\nSangre de Cristo Mountains, wedged in by the north-facing cliffs of\r\nGlorieta Mesa, through Glorieta Pass, where the Confederates lost the\r\nbattle for the Southwest, across the upper reaches of Rio Pecos, and\r\naround to Las Vegas. Then in straight lines across the western edges of\r\nthe Great Plains where they lap up onto the Sangre de Cristo ranges,\r\nthrough Wagon Mound and Springer to Raton. The climb up-canyon to Raton\r\nPass, through roadcuts of brown sandstone, shale, and coal, leads into\r\nColorado, with a view of much of southern Colorado from the Pass.\r\n\r\nMany routes lead northward from ancient Santa Fe. U.S. Highway 285\r\ncrosses the high divide near Bishop’s Lodge, follows Rio Tesuque to\r\nPojoaque, crosses the Rio Grande near Espanola amid varicolored badlands\r\ncut in the Santa Fe rocks, then heads northward on the black basalt\r\nplateau toward Colorado. Black Mesa, a volcanic neck, lies south of\r\nEspanola, overlooking the green Rio Grande Valley; atop this height,\r\nPueblo Indians once defied Spanish guns until they starved. Northward,\r\nnear Tres Piedras, the Ortega and Brazos ranges tower to the west, the\r\nperlite-rich hills of No Agua lie to the northeast, and across the\r\nbasalt plains cut by the Rio Grande, the lofty, snow-capped Sangre de\r\nCristo Mountains loom.\r\n\r\nAt Pojoaque, State Road 4 leads westward, across Otowi bridge of the Rio\r\nGrande, then winds up into the canyon and mesa country bordering the\r\nJemez Mountains. Herein lie Bandelier and Los Alamos, one with ancient\r\nabandoned pueblos, the other the atomic city. Farther west, the road\r\ncrosses the rim of an ancient volcano into Valle Grande, the crater of\r\nthat volcano—some 16 miles across. When this volcano spewed forth hot\r\nashes about a million years ago, the volcanic dust was wind-blown as far\r\nas Kansas and Nebraska!\r\n\r\nAt Espanola, U.S. Highway 84 breaks away to the northwest to follow Rio\r\nChama in its canyon carved from redbeds near Abiquiu, past the\r\ninteresting museum at Ghost Ranch—where bones of Triassic dinosaurs are\r\ncollected—Echo Amphitheater, El Vado Lake, through Chama, and on up into\r\nthe San Juan Mountains country of southern Colorado.\r\n\r\nNear Espanola, U.S. Highway 64 splits off to the northeast; this is the\r\nhigh road of north-central New Mexico. Paralleling the canyon of the Rio\r\nGrande to Pilar, the highway climbs up onto the Taos plateau to Taos,\r\nturns eastward to cut through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains over Palo\r\nFlechado Pass, down into the grassy Moreno Valley to Eagle Nest and\r\nEagle Nest Lake, then eastward again following the narrow canyon of the\r\nCimarron River to Cimarron and Raton. A loop trip northward from Eagle\r\nNest on State 38 goes through ghost town Elizabethtown, over Red River\r\nPass, and down the varicolored canyon of Red River to Questa, before\r\nturning southward toward Taos.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (_U.S. Park Service_)\r\n    Subdivision living, pueblo style—at Aztec National Monument]\r\n\r\nAnd there is the northwest, the Four Corners region, land of Navajos and\r\ngas wells, presided over by magnificent Shiprock. State Highway 44\r\nleaves Interstate 25 at Bernalillo, follows Rio Salado to San Ysidro,\r\nwhich nestles at the south tip of the Nacimiento Mountains below White\r\nMesa, thence northwestward past Cabezon Peak and coaly La Ventana to\r\nCuba in the valley of Rio Puerco. Then, up and down, the winding highway\r\ncuts transversely across the San Juan Basin, through pine groves at the\r\nContinental Divide, past the side road to Chaco Canyon National Monument\r\nat Blanco Trading Post, and among the multicolored Tertiary beds carved\r\ninto badlands. At Bloomfield, oil and gas wells lie all about, and the\r\nmesa-and-canyon country gives way to the valley of the San Juan River.\r\nAt Aztec, State Road 44 joins U.S. Highway 550 in the narrow valley of\r\nthe Animas River—a clear cold stream sent rushing down from the icy\r\nlakes of the San Juan Mountains to the north. Eastward a few miles lies\r\nNavajo Lake along the San Juan River; northward, U. S. 550 winds up the\r\nAnimas Valley toward Durango, high Silverton, and Mesa Verde National\r\nPark. Aztec Ruins National Monument is just to the northwest of Aztec.\r\n\r\nWestward from Aztec, U.S. Highway 550 follows the Animas River to its\r\njunction with the San Juan River, then past the huge Navajo coal mine, a\r\nlong open cut near Fruitland, to junction with U.S. Highway 666 at\r\nShiprock.\r\n\r\nShiprock! A buttressed needle, towering 1450 vertical feet above\r\nNavajo-land, with walls of black igneous rock radiating from its feet\r\nlike spokes on a wheel. This dark-colored spire once filled the throat\r\nof a volcano. Where are piles of rocks, hundreds of feet thick, that\r\nonce surrounded it? Down the river they went, down the San Juan to the\r\nColorado River, and thence to the ocean.\r\n\r\nTo the west, as a background, are the forested Carrizo, Lukachukai, and\r\nChuska mountains. Off to the east lies Hogback Mountain, an upturned\r\nridge of sedimentary rocks producing oil—the petroleum geologist’s\r\nfavorite haunt, an anticline.\r\n\r\nSouthward from Shiprock, U.S. 666 passes other volcanic necks such as\r\nBennett Peak and Ford Butte. North of Gallup, State Road 68 leads\r\nwestward to Window Rock (Arizona), the Indian Headquarters of the Navajo\r\nReservation. Near Gallup, coal beds of Late Cretaceous age crop out,\r\nGamerco once being a booming coal-mining town. Now huge dragline shovels\r\nscoop out the coal from open pits to the northwest of Gallup. And at\r\nGallup, the Indian Capital, a loop drive around the San Juan Basin is\r\ncompleted; Interstate 40, old U.S. Highway 66, goes eastward to\r\nAlbuquerque, St. Louis, and Chicago, and westward to Grand Canyon, Los\r\nAngeles, and the blue Pacific.\r\n\r\nMany other scenic places dot the Land of Enchantment; local hosts,\r\nrancher or city dweller, know of these. Mountain meadows, rushing\r\nstreams, rocky peaks, desert valleys, badlands, grassy plains, thick\r\nforests, spectacular chasms, needle rocks, and brilliant colors—they are\r\nall here in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Footnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.\r\n\r\n[2]National Park Service.\r\n\r\n[3]Forest Service, Southwestern Region, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[4]Information on monuments and parks developed since this publication\r\n    was first printed may be obtained from The New Mexico State Park and\r\n    Recreation Commission, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501.\r\n\r\n[5]New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.\r\n\r\n[6]K₂O is the common unit used in pricing and assaying potassium salts.\r\n    However, the potash is sold as purified potassium chloride or\r\n    sulfate.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Composition_:  Linotype Fairfield\r\n                   Text—10/11\r\n                   Index—8/9 (reduced to 6/7)\r\n                   Display heads—18 pt.
