Romero,\r\nex-Minister of Finance, who has given us the benefit of his experience\r\nfor this study of current Argentine affairs. Señor Romero is the author\r\nof the monetary law of 1881, and was responsible for the arrangement of\r\nthe foreign Debt of 1892; he is to be numbered among those Ministers\r\nwho have rendered, in the course of their financial administration, the\r\ngreatest services to their country.\r\n\r\nWe must also pay tribute to the memory of two eminent gentlemen, no\r\nlonger living, whose death the Argentine deplores; who had desired, by\r\naiding us with their advice, to be in some sort collaborators in this\r\nwork, destined as it is to make popularly known to European readers the\r\npresent prosperity of the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\nWe must express our utmost gratitude first of all to Signor Pellegrini,\r\nthat eminent man who assumed the Presidency of the Republic in a\r\ndifficult moment of her history. We are greatly honoured in that we\r\nare able to associate his name with this book, by publishing, as an\r\nIntroduction, a most interesting study of the formation of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, which was one of the last writings of this eminent citizen.\r\n\r\nAnd we must not forget the friendly and conscientious assistance rendered\r\nus so willingly by one of the most notable figures in the financial world\r\nof the Republic: M. Ernest Tornquist, whose death was also most truly a\r\nnational bereavement. M. Tornquist exercised a considerable influence\r\nover the trend of affairs, and he most notably contributed to the work of\r\neconomic expansion, and financial and monetary reorganisation, of which\r\nthe Argentine is to-day feeling the beneficial effects. We have profited,\r\nin writing this book, by his incontestable competence, and respectfully\r\nsalute the memory of this willing friend and collaborator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO THE THIRD\r\n                                EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThree years have elapsed since the appearance of the first edition of\r\nthis book, and we have to-day the satisfaction of being able to state\r\nthat the development of the country has fully responded to our optimistic\r\nforecast. Short as such a period is in the life of a people, it has been\r\nextraordinarily full; the ground covered is so considerable that it is\r\nof a larger Argentine that we now have to revise the picture, while\r\nrecording its pacific victories in the economic field.\r\n\r\nNo country in the world has ever in so short a time realised so rapid a\r\nprogress, in respect of the produce of the soil. In 1904-1905 the area\r\nunder culture was as yet no more than 22-1/2 millions of acres, while\r\nto-day, in the agricultural year of 1908-9, it attains the figure of 35\r\nmillions of acres, representing an increase of nearly 75 per cent. In the\r\nsame period the value of cereals, which was about £1,600,000 in 1904-5,\r\nhas also increased in very large proportion.\r\n\r\nTaking as basis the figures furnished by the Division of Rural Economy\r\nand Statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture, we may estimate that the\r\nharvest of 1908-9 will give a yield of, 13,811,000 (metric) tons,[1]\r\nwhich may be divided as follows: Wheat 5,760,000 tons, flax 1,228,000,\r\noats 823,000, and maize 6,000,000 tons. The value of the harvest,\r\naccording to the prices ruling in 1908, will amount to 1045 millions of\r\npaper piastres, or £92,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reducing the above quantities to bushels of 56 lbs. weight,\r\nthe cereal harvest is estimated at: wheat, 230,000,000 bushels; oats,\r\n33,000,000; maize, 240,000,000. The metric ton is 34·5 lbs. lighter than\r\nthe English.]\r\n\r\nTo appreciate these figures at their true value, one must remember that\r\ntwenty-five years ago the Argentine was still importing foreign flour to\r\nmake her bread, while to-day the production of grain represents nearly a\r\nton per head per inhabitant.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with maize: twenty years ago it was hardly grown, and\r\nto-day the harvest amounts to 6 millions of tons; furnished almost\r\nentirely by two provinces——those of Buenos Ayres and Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nAs for stock-raising, we cannot make a comparison with any very recent\r\nstatistics——since the last available date back to 1895——but we may\r\nsay that the general census which has just been undertaken, under\r\nthe direction of Señor Alberto B. Martinez, has revealed a wealth\r\nwhose magnitude surpasses all conception. To-day the Argentine counts\r\n29,116,625 horned cattle, 67,211,754 sheep, 7,531,376 horses, 750,125\r\nmules and asses, and 3,945,086 goats; which is equivalent, at the present\r\ntime, to a capital of 1481 millions of paper piastres, or £130,000,000.\r\nBy referring to the figures for 1895, which give us 21,701,526 horned\r\ncattle and 4,446,859 horses, we may judge of the immense progress which\r\nthe Argentine has realised in a few years, thanks to the transformation\r\nof 3-3/4 millions of acres of soil into magnificent pastures of lucerne.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we must, it is true, note a decrease of 7,167,808\r\nhead of sheep, which are gradually falling back before the advance of\r\nagriculture and the increasing numbers of cattle. This harmless animal\r\ncontents itself with a poorer soil, and does not fear the intemperance\r\nof the seasons; also sheep-raising is now giving place, in our central\r\nprovinces, to other more remunerative industries, and the sheep are\r\ntaking refuge in great quantities in the southern regions.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Patagonia, and even Tierra del Fuego, with its terrible\r\nwinds and drenching rain, is now being occupied by the sheep-rancher, to\r\nthe destruction of the guanaco and the natives; frost being rare save on\r\nthe ranges, and the pasture luxurious.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nIf we consider these facts with a view to noting the precise direction\r\nin which the Argentine is to-day evolving, we shall observe a marked\r\ntendency towards the extension of agriculture proper, and a check in the\r\nprogress of stock-raising, which appears——at least for the moment——to be\r\ndeveloping more slowly than of old.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic change is perceptible each year in the statistics\r\nof foreign trade. The exportation of agricultural products amounted,\r\nfor the year 1907, to the value of 164 millions of piastres (gold), or\r\n£32,800,000 as against £32,400,000 and £34,000,000 for the two preceding\r\nyears. As for the products of stock-raising, the value in 1907 amounted\r\nonly to £24,800,000, while in the two preceding years it was £24,800,000\r\nand £28,200,000; and ten years ago it exceeded by more than £10,000,000\r\nthe value of the agricultural exports.\r\n\r\nMany causes are contributing to this transformation of a pastoral into\r\nan agricultural country; their action is progressive, and they are\r\nprofoundly modifying the aspect of the land, by gradually substituting,\r\nfor the monotonous horizons of the ranchero’s prairies, the variety of\r\ncultured fields.\r\n\r\nWhile the prices of cereals have always attained a remunerative figure,\r\nthose of the bestial, on the contrary, have now and then suffered\r\nsensible depression; and, what is still more serious, the ranching\r\nindustries have also suffered, as they did in 1908, by a lack of demand\r\nfor hides and wool, and simultaneously for an insufficient outlet for\r\nmeats.\r\n\r\nThe dried-meat (saladeros) industry, which used to absorb annually\r\nnearly two million beasts, has by now been almost entirely removed in\r\nthe direction of Uruguay, or the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do\r\nSul, and is little more than a memory; as this primitive and rudimentary\r\nmethod of preparation had perforce to give way before the more hygienic\r\nand progressive chilled and frozen meat trade. The chilled beef industry,\r\nhowever, upon which such hopes were founded, has not of late years made\r\nany conquest of new markets, England being almost the Republic’s only\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\nAs for the exportation of cattle on the hoof, it is greatly impeded in\r\nEurope by prohibitive measures, which diplomacy, by means of commercial\r\ntreaties, is endeavouring to remove. Yet were the desired advantages\r\nobtained, the result would be doubtful on account of the considerable\r\nrise in the price of cattle and the high freights which are charged for\r\nthe transport of living stock. It therefore results that this particular\r\nspecies of exploitation is at an obvious disadvantage in the face of the\r\nrefrigerating trade.\r\n\r\nIf the raising of stock and its dependent industries have not, in these\r\nlast few years, realised a progress comparable to that of agriculture, we\r\nmust by no means conclude that this department of production has ceased\r\nto be an element of national prosperity. Quite on the contrary: thanks to\r\nthe efforts made to better affairs by happy selections in the breed of\r\nanimals, the value of live stock has increased in surprising proportions,\r\nand the Argentine still retains its rank as second to the United States\r\nas a stock-raising country.\r\n\r\nWhat we have endeavoured to emphasise, as a new manifestation of the\r\nnational activity during the last few years, is that the development\r\nof the country has been in especial along agricultural lines; an\r\nincontestable proof of progress, and an index of a higher degree of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, as compared to stock-raising, is, from the economical point\r\nof view, a source of wealth having quite a different bearing upon the\r\ngeneral prosperity and welfare of a nation. It is the fairy which little\r\nby little transforms the vast plains of the Argentine pampas into a more\r\nanimated landscape, peopled by numerous homesteads, foci of colonisation,\r\nwhich then develop into villages, which in a score of years may perhaps\r\nbe important cities. Agriculture summons the railroad, stimulates\r\nemigration, promotes the division of the soil, creates the small\r\nproprietor; it influences even the manners and morals of the inhabitants,\r\nfor it demands more labour, more intelligence than ranching; nimbler\r\nwits, more method, greater foresight.\r\n\r\nThe comparison between the two great industries of the Argentine is\r\nsummed up in the following fact: a property comprising 25,000 acres of\r\npasture can be put into working order and managed by a staff of ten to\r\ntwelve men. For an estate of 1500 acres under culture, one may estimate\r\nthat forty to fifty persons, grouped in families, may easily live upon\r\nthe soil and prosper. We may perceive by this the great superiority\r\nof agriculture from the point of view of the general interest of the\r\ncountry. It demands and supports a denser population; it permits the\r\ngrouping of this population in villages and cities, it creates, in\r\nproportion, with a smaller capital, a great wealth of produce; in short,\r\nit contributes on the one hand towards increasing the wealth of the\r\ncountry by participating largely in its exports, and on the other it\r\nincreases its power of consumption, by absorbing a greater number of\r\nimported products.\r\n\r\nThus the evolution of the Argentine towards agriculture constitutes a\r\nreal progress, and if the country continues to follow the same path,\r\nits development will assuredly not be arrested by lack of soil. The\r\n35 to 37 millions of acres already reclaimed, and at present under\r\nculture, represent at the most a tenth of the total area of cultivable\r\nland, which is estimated roughly at 375 millions of acres, of which at\r\nleast 125 millions are perfectly adapted to the culture of cereals. The\r\nfour Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé, Córdoba, Entre Rios, and the\r\nTerritory of Pampa Central alone contain some 32-1/2 millions of land\r\nunder the plough, while there remains about 170 millions of acres of land\r\nwhich is just as fertile, and which without manuring or preparation would\r\nyield a splendid crop from the first year of tilth.\r\n\r\nThis transformation into an agricultural country has already borne\r\nfruit. The figures relating to external commerce, compared with the\r\nworld’s statistics of cereal production, show the present position of the\r\nArgentine among the great exporting nations.\r\n\r\nIt is the Argentine which to-day, after the United States, occupies the\r\nsecond rank in the matter of cereal exports; and this is a significant\r\nevent in the economic history of the nations, to which the attention of\r\nEurope should be directed. At the present moment the Argentine, with\r\nher 4 million tons of corn available for exportation, is not as yet\r\nmistress of the grain markets, but she represents, to those countries\r\nwhose production is insufficient, a notable reserve, which has become\r\nindispensable since the United States, Canada, and Russia seem to have\r\nreached their limit of exportation.\r\n\r\nThe year 1907-8 was for the Argentine, thanks to the results of a good\r\nharvest, a period of exceptional prosperity. The average yield of wheat\r\nwas 18·7 cwt. per hectare——14 bushels per acre——and in the Province of\r\nBuenos Ayres it amounted to over a ton per hectare——or 15 bushels per\r\nacre——although the average was only 11 per acre in 1906-1907, and 13 in\r\n1905-1906.\r\n\r\nAs for the prices, they ruled higher than any the country had so far\r\nknown, even during its most prosperous periods. Wheat had been selling at\r\n6 or 7 piastres the 100 kilos——that is, approximately, at 3s. to 3s. 6d.\r\nper bushel——and at that price agriculture still yielded a fair profit. In\r\n1908, as a result of the bad harvests in several European countries, the\r\nsales rose to 6s.; at which price the profits on the cost of production\r\namounted to 25% or 30%.\r\n\r\nAfter this cursory glance at the present situation in the Argentine,\r\nwe must also express our views of the future. Optimism is certainly\r\npermissible in the case of a country which has advanced so far in so\r\nshort a time, and where prosperity is founded on a diversity of products\r\nwhich can never be affected by a universal crisis.\r\n\r\nHowever, one well might wonder whether the Argentine might not, in the\r\nBiblical phrase, know lean years following the fat; whether she is not\r\ndestined to suffer the onset of plagues, such as drought and the locust,\r\nwhich latter is to her, as to Egypt in the time of the Israelites, a\r\nveritable scourge. Certainly here we have one of the great risks to\r\nwhich the country is exposed: a country wherein all depends upon the\r\nharvest, the earth being the principal source of wealth, and the mother\r\nof all industry. Yet this danger, so real a few years ago, is greatly\r\nlessened to-day by the fact of the distribution of cultivated lands and\r\npastures over a far greater area. A bad harvest could not compromise both\r\nagriculture and stock-raising over a stretch of more than 15° of latitude.\r\n\r\nYet the country is subject to a very real danger, but one of another\r\nkind. From the very exuberance of development may arise a crisis of\r\ngrowth; for her prosperity depends not only on plentiful harvests; it\r\nmay be influenced by other factors on which it is far more difficult to\r\npronounce.\r\n\r\nThe country must continue to require considerable sums of capital for\r\nher agricultural necessities, for her stock-raising, for commerce, and\r\nfor industries; and it may be asked whether the European markets, from\r\nwhich, in great measure, her capital derives, can continue to afford her\r\nan ever-increasing amount of assistance which will keep pace with her\r\ndevelopment in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine is not so far self-sufficing. The soil is, to be sure, a\r\nsource of immense national wealth, but this wealth is not in the form of\r\na reserve to be drawn on; it is, as a rule, converted into real estate\r\ndirectly it is produced; unless, indeed, it goes abroad. For a farmer\r\nwho makes a profit, say, of £8000 or £10,000, will immediately employ\r\nhis capital to acquire another holding or to start a different kind of\r\nculture, instead of clearing off the debts which already burden his\r\nproperty. He is contented with his position as a borrower; for if money,\r\neven on mortgage, costs him 8 to 9 per cent., he can, on the other hand,\r\nobtain a far higher interest by sinking it in the purchase of land.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it results that in the Argentine rural and even urban\r\nproperty is largely hypothecated. It must be understood that this capital\r\nis well guaranteed, as its security rests not upon pure speculations but\r\non the yield of the property, which is far in excess of the charges;\r\nhowever, since the general tendency is not towards redemption, one may\r\nwonder if, sooner or later, there may not be a lack of equilibrium\r\nbetween the impulse given to the country and its financial needs. The\r\ncrisis which arose in the wool market in 1908, the drop in the prices of\r\nquebracho timber, and the restricted outlet for cattle on the hoof, and\r\neven for refrigerated meat,——all these partial misfortunes are salutary\r\nwarnings, and we must not lose sight of them, nor allow ourselves to be\r\nhypnotised by the high prices of wheat, maize, or flax, or the heavy\r\nyield of the lucerne pastures.\r\n\r\nFor our part, in considering the future of the Republic no less than\r\nits present interests, we hope to see it enter upon a period of\r\nconsolidation, rather than continue indefinitely the discussion of\r\nfurther progress. Before entering upon another stage of development the\r\ncountry must, for a while, mark time, in order to gain leisure to assume\r\nits own liabilities, rather than continue incessantly to absorb new\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nBut there is still a cloud in the serene skies of the Republic; a cloud\r\nthat might be the precursor of a truly national catastrophe, if the\r\nmeasures necessary to avert it were not taken in time. The peril arises\r\nneither from the economic situation, which is excellent, denoting an\r\never-increasing vitality, nor the relations of the Republic with the\r\nneighbouring nations, which are conceived in a spirit of peace and\r\nconcord. Although a short-sighted diplomacy has attempted to envelop the\r\nrelations between the Argentine and Brazil in an atmosphere of jealous\r\ndistrust, there is no fundamental cause which might trouble the friendly\r\nrelations of these two countries, which formerly fought side by side on\r\nthe field of battle for the redemption of a sister nation. They have no\r\nconflicting economic interests which might divide them, and are destined\r\nto afford a great example of progress and of civilisation to the other\r\nStates of South America.\r\n\r\nThe peril to which we refer is of a totally different character: it\r\nis caused exclusively by the exaggerated expenditure of the public\r\nadministrations, and the dangerous paths of armed peace upon which the\r\ncountry has entered; thus implanting, in young and free America, a\r\nruinous system, which is ruining the nations of the Old World, burdens\r\nthem with insufferable taxes, and diverts from production and labour\r\ntoo large a proportion of citizens. In order to face imaginary dangers,\r\nCongress and the Government have lately decreed that a sum of £40,000,000\r\nshall be expended upon armaments.\r\n\r\nAs for home politics, they form a domain which we do not desire to enter,\r\nand on which the world of affairs bestows little enough attention, so\r\nlong as they do not compromise the public peace. The Argentine, in\r\nfact, is still under a system of personal power; the Presidency of\r\nthe Republic is the focus about which all the political life of the\r\ncountry gravitates. In default of a people as conscious of its rights\r\nas of its duties, and possessed of the virtues necessary to a course of\r\nperseverance in democratic practices, it is the Government that manages\r\nthe elections; and it is difficult to say whether it does so because\r\nthere is no public opinion, or whether there is no public opinion because\r\nthe Governments usurp the functions of the electorate. From this point of\r\nview there has been no change in the political _morale_ of the country;\r\nthe only progress to be noted is that the parties resort less often than\r\nthey used to violence as a solution of their quarrels.\r\n\r\nAs for the administrative expenses, they are increasing with a rapidity\r\nonly equalled by the growth of the fiscal resources of this fortunate\r\ncountry. Proposals for public works accumulate in the various Ministries,\r\nwhile waiting for the funds necessary for their execution; their total\r\namounts to-day to the respectable figure of nearly £40,000,000.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: from our re-examination of the Argentine situation for 1909,\r\nwe obtain an impression of great progress and of actual prosperity,\r\nan impression confirmed by the statistics of foreign trade, in which\r\nthe entire activity of the country is reflected. For the year 1907 the\r\ntotal of imports and exports amounted to £116,000,000; for 1908 the\r\ntotal receipts and outgoings represented £133,000,000: with a commercial\r\nbalance of nearly £24,000,000 in favour of exports.\r\n\r\nAmong the other manifestations of national progress we have still to take\r\ninto account the development of the network of railroads, of which 13,660\r\nmiles are in actual working, representing a capital of £158,000,000,\r\nwhile 3259 miles are projected or in process of construction,\r\nrepresenting a capital of more than £25,000,000. These new lines have\r\nbeen conceded by Congress either to companies already existing, or to\r\nnew companies which are able to offer all desirable guarantees, so as to\r\nassure the prompt realisation of the schemes accepted. The Government,\r\non its own part, has solicited and obtained from Congress the necessary\r\nsanction for the execution of a vast plan for the colonisation of the\r\nSouthern Territories, which is based on the construction of numerous\r\nrailroads. This continuous extension of the railway system has greatly\r\nfavoured the valorisation of the new Territories, and has contributed\r\npowerfully to the movement of colonisation and emigration which is the\r\nindispensable condition of a wider future.\r\n\r\nTo-day, then, all is for the best in the best, or at least the richest,\r\ncountry in the world. But if science teaches us that Nature takes no\r\nleaps——_natura non facit saltus_——history also teaches us that nations\r\nin their progress must not progress too rapidly. For this reason the\r\nArgentine Republic, in especial, has need to-day to consolidate her\r\nprosperity under a _régime_ of foreign and domestic peace, of prudence\r\nand economy, and to avoid speculation and the abuse of credit, which have\r\nended, before now, in inevitable reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago M. F. Latzina, Director of Statistics, published in\r\nFrench a very able work on the _Geographie de la République Argentine_,\r\nof which he had issued the first edition in Spanish, and I consented with\r\npleasure to write an Introduction to a book whose object——an object which\r\nit fulfilled——was to familiarise European readers with a country whose\r\nrapid development is one of the most remarkable facts in the economic\r\nhistory of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n“These results,” I wrote, after having quoted certain statistics\r\nof agriculture and commerce, “are assuredly very satisfactory. The\r\nArgentines have the right to be proud of them; few countries in the world\r\ncould show a like example of progress!”\r\n\r\nI have no less pleasure in associating myself to-day with this book,\r\nby Señor Albert B. Martinez (sometime Under-Secretary of State, and at\r\npresent Director-General of the Statistical Department of the city of\r\nBuenos Ayres), and M. Maurice Lewandowski, Sub-Director of the Comptoir\r\nNational d’Escompte of Paris. Their competence is incontestable, and\r\ntheir work requires no recommendation, since it has won the sanction of\r\nsuccess, being now in its third French edition, and having been “crowned”\r\nby the French Academy. But the object which is aimed at by _The Argentine\r\nin the Nineteenth Century_ is the same as that of the _Geographie de la\r\nRépublique Argentine_, and the interest attaching to the book is the same.\r\n\r\n“In the competition of the new nations, created by emigration from\r\nEurope,” I said in 1890, “this Republic will be enjoying a privileged\r\nsituation, because of its particular advantages: the nature of its\r\nclimate——a climate of the temperate zone; the vast extent of its\r\nterritory; the quality of its soil; the facility with which railways\r\ncan be built; its situation on the Atlantic coast, facing Europe, and\r\nrelatively near the Indian Ocean; the powerful tide of emigration\r\nsetting in towards it, and the rapid peopling of the country, together\r\nwith the wealth that results therefrom; the suitable character of its\r\npopulation, and the liberal spirit of its political institutions....\r\n\r\n“The Argentine Republic, which occupies in the temperate zone of South\r\nAmerica a position analogous to that held by the United States in the\r\ncorresponding portion of North America, may well dream, if not of equal\r\npower, at least of a similar future.”\r\n\r\nThis dream is in process of realisation: of this the proof will be found\r\nin the chain of evidence which our authors put forward.\r\n\r\nIt is the present condition of affairs and, above all, the economic\r\nsituation, which the authors of _The Argentine in the Twentieth Century_\r\nhave set out to represent. They have not given us a panegyric——“_nihil\r\nadmirari_,” say they——but a practical book: one written by men of\r\nbusiness and affairs, founded upon direct observation, and hard-and-fast\r\nfigures, where statistics have provided them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Argentine is a young nation, which hitherto has busied itself rather\r\nin work and production for the amelioration of its present condition,\r\nand in the preparation of its morrow by creating capital, than in giving\r\nitself to the historical study of its past. Nevertheless, history is the\r\nweb from which the spirit of a nation is woven. It is useful to recall\r\nthe principal historical periods, and particularly the origins of the\r\nnation, for the better understanding of the present period.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1508 that the Spaniard, Juan Diaz de Solis, discovered the\r\nestuary of the Plata, the _Mar dulce_; and in 1516 he returned, thinking,\r\nafter the discovery of the South Sea, by Nuñez de Balboa in 1513, that\r\nthis might be the strait, so sought by the navigators of the time,\r\nby which that sea might be reached, but on landing he was killed by\r\nthe arrows of the Charrua Indians. He had discovered no strait, but a\r\nspot assuredly well suited for colonial settlement. The first attempts\r\nwere abortive: that of Sebastian Cabot, who built the fort of the\r\nSancti-Spiritu (1527), and that of Diego Garcia. It was then that the\r\ndiscovery of some ornaments of silver, worn by the people of the country,\r\ngave the river its name; known first as the Rio de Solis, it was now\r\ncalled the Rio de la Plata. The Indians destroyed the fort and killed the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nEight years later a wealthy private gentleman, an officer of Charles V.,\r\nDon Pedro de Mendoza, undertook to establish a settlement at his own\r\ncost, on the condition of being appointed governor of all territories\r\nthat might be found as far as 200 leagues from the ocean; and in 1535\r\nhe sailed with fourteen vessels and two thousand men. He laid the first\r\nfoundations of the colony of Buenos Ayres, and he rebuilt the fort of\r\nthe Sancti-Spiritu, while his lieutenant, Ayolas, in 1536, founded the\r\nstation of Asuncion, on the Rio Paraguay. The post of Buenos Ayres\r\nwas abandoned. After the death of Mendoza and Ayolas the new colony\r\nwas governed by Martinez de Irala for a space of nearly twenty years;\r\nreinforced by fresh emigrants, it barely held its own against the losses\r\ninflicted upon it by the Indians. Irala, by a voyage of three years’\r\nduration, succeeded in putting himself in touch with the Spaniards of\r\nPeru.\r\n\r\nConquerors coming from Chili across the Andes, the Spaniards founded\r\namong others, despite the hostility of the Indians, the following\r\nstations: Santiago del Estero (1552), Mendoza (1560), Tucuman (1565),\r\nCordoba (1573), Salta (1582), and Jujuy (1592). These at first were\r\nlittle more than camps entrenched. But Santiago del Estero was erected\r\ninto a bishopric, and so remained until 1700, in which year the episcopal\r\nthrone was transferred to Córdoba. In the eastern regions, in 1573,\r\nGovernor Juan de Garay built Santa Fé, re-occupied Buenos Ayres, which\r\nwas christened, on the 11th of June 1580, Cuidad de la Trinidad y Puerto\r\nde Santa Maria de Buenos Ayres (the City of the Trinity and the Haven of\r\nHoly Mary of the Fair Winds), and founded Corrientès in 1588.\r\n\r\nTrade commenced. A first consignment of hides and sugar was dispatched to\r\nSpain in 1551; but the merchants of Seville protested, and as a result\r\ntheir privileges won the day. It is a fact that the monstrous regulations\r\nwhich Spain had imposed upon her colonies forced the Argentines, for\r\nsome considerable time to carry their exports across the continent to\r\nCallao, whence they were carried by sea to Panama; there they were again\r\ntransported by land across the isthmus, and were shipped anew at Puerto\r\nBello for Seville. Imports came by the same road.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, exceptions to this rule: either by grace of\r\nprovisional permits given by the King of Spain, or, more frequently,\r\nthrough the contraband trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1617 the Province of Paraguay and the shores of the Plata were divided\r\ninto three Provinces; Paraguay, Buenos Ayres (erected into a bishopric\r\nin 1630), and Tucuman, which were dependents of the viceroyalty of Peru.\r\nThe captaincy of Chili also extended over both sides of the Andes. The\r\nIndians had to a great extent been divided among the colonists _en\r\nencomiendas_——that is to say, in a species of slavery; but other Indians,\r\nwho were still free, were formidable enemies.\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century the Jesuits instituted their first\r\n“reductions” in Paraguay, and organised in a community the Guarano\r\nIndians of the country. These “reductions,” ravaged by the Mamelukes\r\nof Brazil, were replaced by missions established on either bank of the\r\nParaguay River, and on the Uruguay to the south of Yguassu. The order of\r\nJesuits was suppressed in 1766.\r\n\r\nThe principal towns of the Argentine of to-day were already established\r\nby the middle of the eighteenth century. At that period, so Savary\r\ninforms us, “The city of Buenos Ayres contained about 4000 houses, all\r\nbuilt of earth (adobe), but covered with tiles, with the exception of\r\nsome fifty houses of brick. The inhabitants are rich, and owe their\r\nriches to the extensive trade which they carry on, both at home and\r\nabroad.” After the advent to the Spanish throne of the son-in-law of\r\nLouis XIV., France had the greater share of this trade; the King having\r\nconceded to a French company the monopoly of the Assiente——that is to\r\nsay, of the trade in negroes, until by the Treaty of Utrecht France was\r\nforced to cede this monopoly to England.\r\n\r\nThe two principal articles of export were at that time green hides for\r\nEurope and the Paraguayan _maté_ for Peru.\r\n\r\nOn the northern bank of the Plata the Portuguese had founded the Colonia\r\ndel Sacramento (1686), with a view to competing with the Spanish ports.\r\nThe Spaniards seized this place once in 1724 and again in 1766; they\r\nfounded Montevideo in 1726. The quarrel between the two colonies was only\r\nterminated by the Treaty of Madrid in 1750.\r\n\r\nIn 1748 Spain somewhat abated the severity of her laws. In 1776 she freed\r\nthe Argentine from the overlordship of Peru, by creating the viceroyalty\r\nof La Plata, with Buenos Ayres as capital. The population, which before\r\nthis change was only 37,000, rose to over 400,000 in a quarter of a\r\ncentury. In 1780 was founded the colony of Carmen, the first Patagonian\r\nsettlement, the shores of Patagonia having been first explored by the\r\nJesuit Quiroga in 1746.\r\n\r\nDuring the wars of the Empire the English seized Buenos Ayres by\r\nsurprise, but were expelled by a Frenchman, Jacques de Liniers, whom the\r\ninhabitants had appointed viceroy.\r\n\r\nThe _colonial period_ ended in 1810.\r\n\r\nSuch were the origins of the Argentine; a time of difficulties and\r\nimpediments; but in that period were laid the foundations on which the\r\nArgentine civilisation reposes.\r\n\r\nThe second period is that of the _formation of the Republican State_.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this period, that of the deliverance from Spain,\r\nopens with the memorable day of the 25th of May 1810, when liberty\r\nwas peacefully proclaimed at Buenos Ayres. The revolution spread to\r\nCórdoba and to Tucuman; it failed in Upper Peru, owing to the reverse of\r\nGoyenèche in 1811, and in Paraguay, where the capitulation of Tacuary\r\ntook place in the same year. Belgrano, one of the heroes of the War\r\nof Independence, renewed the offensive and once more invaded Upper\r\nPeru——this time victoriously; but the Argentine troops were definitely\r\ndriven from the country after the battles of Vilcuapujio (1813), and\r\nSipé-Sipe (1816). On the east coast the capitulation of Montevideo in\r\n1814 put an end to the Spanish domination. On the west the brilliant\r\nexpedition of General San Martin, who crossed the Andes, freed Chili, and\r\nstruck the decisive blow by the capture of Lima (1817-1821). The victory\r\nof General Sucre at Ayacucho (1824) terminated the struggle. Argentine\r\nterritory had already been seven years free from the Spanish troops.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this period, that of political construction, was\r\nlonger, far more laborious, and still more bloody. Questions of race\r\nand party divided the inhabitants. Guachos of the Pampa, Creoles[3] and\r\npure Spaniards, Federals and Unitarians, disputed the power, while on\r\nthe frontiers of the Republic the Indians continued to disturb and alarm\r\nthe new State. Provinces seceded; many constitutions were drafted. In\r\nspite of his talent as a statesman, Rivadavia was unable to obtain the\r\nuniversal acceptance of the Unionist Constitution of 24th December 1826.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This word is here used to denote mixed blood; in its proper\r\nuse it denotes a person of Latin blood born in tropical or semi-tropical\r\nAmerica.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nA war against Brazil, of which the notable fact was the victory of\r\nItuzaingo (1827), resulted in the recognition of Uruguay as a free state.\r\n\r\nThe civil war broke out anew several times. The military leader of the\r\nBuenos Ayres Federals, General Rosas, seized upon the dictatorship in\r\na time of disorder, exercising it not without intelligence, but with a\r\ncruel despotism, and he carried on a long war against Montevideo, which\r\nlasted until General Urquiza, of the Union party (with Brazil and Uruguay\r\nas allies) delivered his country by the victory of Caseros (1852). The\r\nConstitution of the Argentine Republic was voted on 25th May 1853; but\r\nthe end of the civil war and the definite reunion of Buenos Ayres to the\r\nother Provinces did not take place until 1860, the year of the revision\r\nof the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWar and confusion are not usually propitious to progress. However, the\r\npopulation in 1861 was estimated approximately at 1,375,000; it had\r\nincreased to almost five times what it was at the beginning of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nBuenos Ayres became definitely the capital of the Republic in 1882, upon\r\nceasing to be the capital of the State of Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nThe third period is that of _economic development_. This is the period\r\nof which our authors write. We may mention it as beginning with the\r\nre-entrance of Buenos Ayres into the Argentine Concert, and the revision\r\nof the Constitution of October 1860. If it has not been free from\r\npolitical agitations and international misunderstandings, it has none\r\nthe less been more pacific than the preceding periods, and industry has\r\nenjoyed a security which in former years was only too often disturbed by\r\nthe regulations of colonial trade, the attacks of the Indians, the civil\r\nwars, and the Separatist policy. But there were still for twelve years\r\nintestine troubles and dissensions.\r\n\r\nIt was only in 1882 that the political organisation was completely\r\nconstituted, when Buenos Ayres became the Federal capital; for from 1865\r\nto 1870 the Argentine was forced to wage war against Paraguay, when\r\nit struggled, in concert with Brazil, against the despotism of Lopez.\r\nThe Treaty of the 3rd of February 1876 gave it the greater Chaco as\r\nfar as Pilcomayo. The Chaco is pacified; matters are not the same now\r\nas when, in 1881, Crevaux was assassinated there by the Tobas. General\r\nRiva effected the Argentine conquest of Patagonia (1879-1880), and the\r\nIndians, feared so long by the planters, were driven across the Andes.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the difference which had arisen between the Argentine and Brazil,\r\nwith reference to the Misionès frontier, was settled by arbitration. By\r\nthe Treaty of 23rd July 1881 was terminated a long quarrel with Chili in\r\nrelation to Patagonia; the Argentine obtained possession of the country\r\nas far as the line made by the Cordilleras and a portion of Tierra del\r\nFuego. Arbitration also, in November 1902, settled the difference with\r\nChili, no less irritating and of equally long standing, concerning, the\r\nfrontiers of the Andes. No more serious causes of quarrel between the\r\nArgentine and its neighbours remain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe period of _economic development_ is as yet of only fifty years’\r\nduration: it is far from having reached the limit of its evolution; but\r\nwe may judge of the amplitude which that evolution has already attained\r\nby means of statistics,[4] and by them we may foretell what the future\r\nholds in promise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The more recent figures cited in this Preface are taken, for\r\nthe most part, from _The Statesman’s Year-Book_.]\r\n\r\nThe population, estimated in 1861 as being 1,375,000, had by 1907\r\nincreased to 6,210,000. Immigration, varying from one period to another\r\naccording to the economic condition of the European nations and the\r\nArgentine Republic, reached an annual average of 13,400 from 1860 to\r\n1869: between 1903 and 1908 it amounted to 211,000 (emigration not being\r\ndeducted.)[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This emigration amounted to an animal average of 93,000\r\nbetween 1903-1907; but the deduction was not made in the years 1860-1869.\r\nIn 1907 there were 209,000 immigrants and 90,000 emigrants.]\r\n\r\nThe area cultivated in 1895, the date of the first serious estimate, was\r\n5,256,160 acres, of which 2,013,000 acres were under wheat;[6] in 1909\r\n34·6 million acres were cultivated, of which 14·8 millions were in wheat.\r\nThese 34·6 millions are only a small fraction of the 256 million acres\r\nwhich the Argentine appears to contain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The cultivated area was estimated at 849,000 acres in 1872.]\r\n\r\nThe grain harvest, estimated in 1878-1881 at barely 400,000 tons,\r\nexceeded a million tons in 1895, and in 1907-1908 amounted to 5,523,900\r\ntons, or 204,384,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bovine and ovine races have not greatly increased in numbers\r\nfor the last twenty years, on account of the transformations effected by\r\nagriculture,[7] the exportation of wool, which was 660,000 quintals in\r\n1869-1870, was nearly 2,000,000 in 1905, and it still amounted to 1-1/2\r\nmillions in 1907; the exportation of beef, reckoned in carcasses, was\r\nmore than 60,000 head in 1900 and 463,000 in 1907.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: In 1875 an approximate estimate gave 13-1/2 millions of\r\nhorned cattle and 57-1/2 millions of sheep; in 1907 the figures amounted\r\nto 25,844,000 and 77,580,000.]\r\n\r\nThe first section of railroad was constructed in 1857. In 1865 the\r\nRepublic possessed only 154 miles of railroad; in 1908 there were 14,643\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the first year of which we have commercial statistics, the\r\nforeign trade amounted to £11,300,000; in 1907, it reached £113,000,000,\r\nand in 1908 £127,600,000. For several years there has been a very large\r\nexcess of exports over imports; in 1908 it would seem to have exceeded\r\n£20,000,000.\r\n\r\nThese figures, to which our authors have added many others, are eloquent.\r\nThey tell us that man, whose labour creates wealth, is four and a half\r\ntimes more numerous upon Argentine soil than he was forty-six years\r\nago; that immigration each year increases the number of workers; that\r\ncultivated soil, the chief instrument of wealth in an agricultural\r\ncountry, has an area nearly seven times greater than that of fourteen\r\nyears ago; that wheat, the principal vegetable product of that soil,\r\nnow yields harvests thirteen times more abundant than those of thirty\r\nyears ago; that the products of stock-raising have, on the whole,\r\ngreatly increased, despite the arrested development of certain forms of\r\nproduction; that the railways——the means of transport of man and his\r\nproduce, which did not exist half a century since——now cover the land\r\nwith a network of increasing fineness, and are placing the Argentine in\r\nthe first rank of the nations in respect of the mileage of railroad per\r\ninhabitant; that foreign trade, which is one of the most characteristic\r\nforms of popular activity, and that commonly mentioned in illustrating a\r\nstate’s power of expansion, has multiplied itself ten times since 1865.\r\n\r\nThese figures, taken together, form a picture which is not only\r\nencouraging, but extremely flattering to the pride of the Argentine\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut the picture is not without shadows. The Indians to-day amount only\r\nto thirty thousand in numbers; the Guachos are gradually disappearing\r\nbefore the agricultural settler; and the political and moral unity of the\r\ncountry is not yet fully accomplished. The Argentine, like most of the\r\nLatin-American republics, has given itself a Constitution based upon that\r\nof the United States; but the populations of its Provinces had not the\r\nspiritual cohesion exhibited by the British Colonies, and above all by\r\nNew England, which qualities set the seal on religious faith and the love\r\nof liberty. European immigration has brought us composite elements which\r\nare not yet amalgamated. Nearly all immigrants have come to make money:\r\nthe majority are indifferent to public affairs, as we see on election\r\ndays. Others are only too inclined to attach themselves to coteries, to\r\ncliques. In the relations between the local governments and the central\r\nGovernment, the subordination of the former is more remarkable than the\r\nharmony of their mutual relations. The planters, intoxicated by their\r\ngood fortune, are not always so prudent as to regulate their undertakings\r\nby their resources.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1890 I wrote an Introduction to M. Latzina’s book, the Argentine\r\nwas in the full swing of speculation, and apparently saw no limits to\r\nits development. “The Argentines,” I said, “resemble an enterprising\r\nmerchant, who, having opened shop in a well-frequented street, and having\r\nborrowed money in order to start with a luxurious establishment, finds\r\nhimself greatly embarrassed for years, although his business prospers,\r\nbecause his advances and his engagements are larger than his takings.\r\nIt is desirable that this spirit of enterprise should be fed, so to\r\nspeak, on diet, or at least, according to regimen; and on such conditions\r\nequilibrium would be re-established.” Indeed, it then seemed that a\r\ncrisis must occur; and it came, a few months later. It was very long and\r\nvery severe; the Argentine learned what it meant to lose its credit, and\r\nfor twelve years it suffered the disadvantages of a depreciated paper\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThe country recovered, and speculation rapidly received fresh impetus.\r\nThanks to the excess of exports, gold became plentiful; it is no longer\r\nat a premium; if interest——which has decreased——still maintains itself at\r\nabout 6 per cent., it is because there is a great demand for capital. The\r\nbudgets still increase at a pace to alarm a prudent financier, in spite\r\nof increased receipts. “If the Argentine does not wish to compromise its\r\nlofty destinies,” say the authors of the present volume, “it is essential\r\nthat it should maintain an economical administration, careful of the\r\npublic moneys, yet open to all material progress. By so doing, it will\r\ninspire confidence in men and in capital: the two elements which it must\r\nstill increase in order to become a great nation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the population born on Argentine soil were added, between 1857 and\r\n1908, 3,338,000 immigrants of various nationality;[8] 1,706,000 Italians,\r\n670,000 Spaniards, 201,000 French and Belgians, 100,000 Austro-Hungarians\r\nor Germans, and 41,000 English. Thus the Latin races are greatly in the\r\nascendant: a fact which facilitates assimilation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: On the other hand, 1,322,000 persons emigrated. The census\r\nof 1895 gave 886,000 foreigners not naturalised, of whom 493,000 were\r\nItalians, 199,000 Spaniards, 94,000 French, etc. To-day immigration\r\nconsists especially of Italians (127,578 in 1906), Spaniards (79,287),\r\nRussians (17,434), Syrians (7677), Austrians (4277), French (3698), etc.]\r\n\r\nThe Government should preoccupy itself largely with this matter of\r\nassimilation: for the process is not complete. There are two effectual\r\nmeans which it might employ, among others, in order to assimilate its new\r\nrecruits: ownership of the soil and education.\r\n\r\nThese two means have produced marvellous effects in the United States.\r\nThe Homestead Law of the 20th of May 1862 gave to every American over\r\ntwenty-one years of age, and to every person having declared, conformably\r\nwith the law, his intention of becoming a citizen, the right to occupy\r\ngratuitously 160 acres of surveyed lands, or 80 acres only in districts\r\nmore advantageously situated: if the holder, after five years of\r\nresidence, has cultivated a portion of his holding, the full title is\r\nfinally granted. For such purpose the public lands have been surveyed and\r\ndivided into lots by the Government. The Government also sells public\r\nlands by auction or treaty. Up to the month of July 1905, it had thus\r\nalienated a total of 808,000,000 acres; which explains how millions of\r\nfamilies——Irish, German, Scandinavian and others——have been more or less\r\ndefinitely settled on the soil of that which was already or which has\r\nsince then become their native land. Here is an example the Argentine\r\nGovernment would do well to follow.\r\n\r\nEducation exercises an influence of another kind, which is no less\r\nefficacious. The Americans of the United States are well aware of this,\r\nand this is why they attach such importance to the upkeep of the “common\r\nschools” and the attendance of the pupils. The children of foreign\r\nparents become Americanised in class and during play by contact with\r\nyoung Americans. The English tongue becomes their own language; their\r\nmanners of thought and their habits are modelled on those of their\r\ncomrades, whom they are unconsciously proud to imitate. If the immigrant\r\nfamily does not forget the memories of its old home, at least its\r\noffspring, from the second generation, are rooted in the American soil\r\nand have American minds.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Government must endeavour to obtain a like result. For a\r\nlong period primary instruction was in an extremely neglected state in\r\nthe Argentine Republic. However, the Constitution obliged the Provinces\r\nto secure such instruction, the Federal Government to assist by finding\r\na third of the expense of the first installation of the schools. But in\r\nspite of the Constitution, in 1874 there were only 1830 primary schools\r\nand 112,000 pupils. Progress has been accomplished: in 1905 there were\r\n5250 schools, 14,118 teachers, male and female, and 544,000 pupils. But\r\nas the population between the ages of six and fourteen had increased to\r\n827,000, only 65 per cent. of the children were attending school, and\r\nonly one child in three was able to read and write. This is a state of\r\nthings that must be changed.\r\n\r\nSecondary education, as far as numbers go, is in no better case; there\r\nare sixteen “colleges,” with 4100 pupils. The State Universities of\r\nBuenos Ayres and Córdoba and the three provincial Universities of La\r\nPlata, Santa Fé and Parana, with 3000 students, are relatively better.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The writer does not give the statistics of those who go\r\nabroad to study; the number is, of course, very considerable, especially\r\nof those who go to Paris.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe three orders of instruction ought to work together to form a\r\nnational spirit and a moral unity; but the Government should not forget\r\nthat primary instruction is the basis, and that it is the only kind of\r\ninstruction that can be bestowed upon each generation in its entirety,\r\nand that the children of each generation should be taught at an early age\r\nnot only the ideas necessary to the life of the individual, but also, by\r\nmeans of the elements of national history, ethics, and applied science,\r\nthe knowledge and love of their native country.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic as yet counts few men to whom the exigencies of\r\nlife leave leisure to consecrate themselves entirely to letters or the\r\nsciences. It has some distinguished writers, but they usually find a\r\nrecompense for their talent in the public press; for in Buenos Ayres more\r\nthan 200 journals are published. Men write as hurriedly as they act. It\r\nis to be hoped that before long, with the increase of wealth, there will\r\narise men of science, who will find no lack of material in the country,\r\nand men of letters, historians, novelists, sociologists, etc., who will\r\nalso never lack for matter in this busy, humming hive. Such men are\r\nnecessary, because their life-work goes far to make up the intellectual\r\ncapital of a nation, and even to form nationality itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my introduction to M. Latzina’s book, I glanced at the whole continent\r\nof South America, and I remarked that civilisation had scarcely\r\npenetrated the interior of this vast continent; that the density of\r\nits population was extremely low; that the economic, intellectual and\r\npolitical life of the continent was concentrated, if I may so use the\r\nword, upon its periphery; that is to say, upon the shores which are in\r\ntouch, through navigation, with the rest of the world; that the Argentine\r\nRepublic formed the southern portion of this belt connecting Uruguay and\r\nChili; that this belt is wider where the penetration of the interior\r\nis easier and the climate more favourable. This belt has also been\r\nwidened in Southern Brazil by the construction of railroads. It is still\r\nwider in the Argentine, because the network of railways is more widely\r\ndistributed, the soil is of even quality and cultivable, and the climate\r\ntemperate and favourable to expansion.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this present Introduction, let us imagine a vaster\r\narea——the whole earth, or, at least, the three inhabited zones of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe torrid zone contains nearly a third of the land surface of the earth,\r\nand only a quarter of its population; the density of population is thus\r\nbelow the average. Original civilisations have existed in the torrid\r\nzone——for example, Mexico and Peru before the arrival of Europeans——but\r\nthese existed on higher plateaus where the climate was not tropical.\r\nThere were civilisations in India and the East Indies, but these were\r\nimported from the valley of the Ganges. There are to-day intertropical\r\ncountries which exhibit an active economic life: India, Mexico, the\r\nAntilles and the seaboard of Brazil. Nevertheless, in the greater part\r\nof the torrid zone it would seem that the continuous high temperature\r\nsaps human energy, and also renders it to a great extent unnecessary, by\r\nsimplifying life, reducing as it does the number of man’s essential needs\r\nby facilitating the satisfaction of those which are, like alimentation,\r\nstrictly necessary.\r\n\r\nThe temperate zone of the north is the most favoured of all these. It\r\ncontains nearly half the land surface of the globe. It is also the\r\nmost populated, and the average density of population is far higher,\r\nfor it contains about 1,207,000,000 inhabitants, or roughly speaking,\r\nthree-quarters of the population of the globe. Here it is that we find\r\nmassed the four great sources of the ancient and modern civilisation of\r\nthe world, which also correspond to the four great groups of mankind;\r\nChina with Japan; India, with the Deccan running down to the torrid zone;\r\nEurope, and the United States and Eastern Canada. In the three first\r\ncentres the density of population is far greater than in any other large\r\ncountry. In the fourth, the number of human beings (some 94 millions)\r\nand the density are far less; but this centre has become one of the most\r\nimportant, by means of its activity of production.\r\n\r\nThere remains the temperate zone of the south. In this zone, the ocean\r\noccupies relatively the largest space. The land emerges from it only at\r\nthe termination of three continents——America, Africa, and Australia,\r\nterminated by Tasmania and New Zealand. Before the arrival of Europeans,\r\neach of these divisions was absolutely isolated, without any relations\r\nwith the others, and inhabited by races entirely savage. The coming of\r\nthe Europeans who peopled them, and the maritime commerce which ensued,\r\nhave awakened them to civilisation. In the case of America, we have seen\r\nthat free colonisation was not commenced until the nineteenth century. In\r\nAfrica, at the opening of the nineteenth century, there were only a few\r\nports occupied, and Australia was still practically untouched. To-day,\r\nin the temperate zone of the south, which comprises only a twelfth part\r\nof the land surface of the globe, there are 24 millions of inhabitants,\r\nnearly all civilised and of European descent. This population amounts to\r\n1·5 per cent. of that of the globe; its density, therefore, is below the\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the zone in which the population has relatively increased\r\nmost rapidly since the beginning of the nineteenth century, for at the\r\noutset it certainly did not count a million inhabitants. The Australian\r\nand African divisions have owed their good fortune to gold, and in a\r\nlesser degree to wool; but gold mines are a source of wealth which is\r\nexhausted by exploitation. In Australia, where the extent of arable lands\r\nis limited, immigration has at present practically ceased. In Africa the\r\nsoil is little suited to culture, and immigration to the Transvaal has\r\nbeen recruited rather among Asiatic coolies than among free workers of\r\nEuropean race.\r\n\r\nIn this southern temperate zone, the Argentine Republic is the State\r\nwhich has the most numerous population: that in which the population has\r\nknown the greatest increase, and in which economic conditions promise the\r\nwidest development in the near future. The perfecting of refrigerating\r\nprocesses will certainly facilitate the exportation of meats, and it is\r\nto be hoped that the interests of trade, under the necessities of the\r\nfood supply of the labouring classes, will finally overcome the obstacles\r\nwhich the European producers oppose in the way of imports. The demand for\r\nwheat, like the demand for meat, may vary according to the year and the\r\nprotective legislation of the nations; but in general we may say that it\r\nwill increase rather than decrease, because the population of Europe,\r\nand especially of Central and Western Europe, is for ever increasing in\r\nnumbers and in density, so that already it cannot suffice to itself by\r\nproducing its alimentary needs from its own soil, and in proportion as\r\nit becomes wealthier it will consume more white bread and more butchers’\r\nmeat. The United States and Canada continue to export wheat; but the\r\nrapid increase of the urban and industrial population of the United\r\nStates will assuredly limit this exportation to a very great extent in\r\nthe twentieth century.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The consumption of wheat in the United States averaged 200\r\nmillion bushels between 1871 and 1875, and 531 million between 1903 and\r\n1907. The exportation averaged 62 million bushels between 1871 and 1875,\r\nand 122 million between 1903 and 1907.]\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic, where the harvest is due in January, so that its\r\nwheat arrives in the European markets by March, is the country destined\r\nto profit the most by these advantages. It must learn how to make use of\r\nthem wisely, practising a policy of peace and concord, increasing its\r\npowers of stability by the development of the sentiment of nationality,\r\nand by inspiring confidence both in foreign capitalists and in immigrants\r\nby accumulating capital of its own, and by learning to retain, in spite\r\nof success, the foresight which warns of perils and the prudence which\r\navoids them.\r\n\r\n                          E. LEVASSEUR,\r\n\r\n                          _Member of the Institute,\r\n                          Administrator of the College of France._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book, intended to make known in Europe the present situation and the\r\neconomic future of the Argentine Republic, comes at an opportune moment\r\nto fulfil its mission of popularisation.\r\n\r\nDuring the last ten years of the nineteenth century the Argentine has\r\nsuffered all the misfortunes and known all the disasters that can affect\r\na rural and agricultural people. The locust, coming from the Tropics,\r\ndevoured the crops; anthrax, imported from Europe, decimated the cattle;\r\nthe threats of a war with Chili imposed enormous expenses and exhausted\r\nthe national revenue; finally, a commercial and industrial crisis, and\r\ndomestic disturbances, consequent upon the general misfortune, completed\r\nthe tale of calamities which put the vitality of the nation to the test.\r\n\r\nBut as there is no night so long that it has no dawn, all these shadows\r\nfled away. Our quarrel with Chili was submitted to arbitration, and the\r\ndecision of His Majesty the King of Great Britain not only terminated\r\na cause of difference of fifteen years’ duration, but re-established\r\nfraternal relations between the two Republics. The rural plagues were\r\nattacked and vanquished by measures which experience indicated as\r\npreventive of recurrence; commercial and industrial prosperity returned;\r\nthe tranquillity of the interior was assured; and the general welfare\r\nincreased. To accentuate still further this beneficent reaction, the\r\nimmense and fertile plains of the pampa, open to the activities of the\r\nagriculturalists, began to produce abundant harvests, which struck the\r\nEuropean markets with amazement, and diverted towards the Argentine a\r\ncurrent of gold which was estimated at more than £20,000,000, and a\r\nstream of immigration, which, in the year 1904, brought 125,000 workers,\r\nand which promises to be even greater in the present year.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic has issued triumphantly from its lengthy and\r\nsevere ordeal; it has emerged richer, stronger and more confident of its\r\nown destiny than at any other period of its history; and the increase\r\nof its revenues and the rapid growth of its prosperity have secured the\r\nattention of the great financial centres of Europe.\r\n\r\nPublic curiosity being thus awakened, many people have inquired: What\r\nis the Argentine? How far is the development of its wealth a sound and\r\ndurable process? What is the probable future of its people? Is it a\r\nmeteor that flashes brilliantly through space, or a star rising upon the\r\neconomic and political horizon?\r\n\r\nWhile some content themselves with asking such questions and awaiting\r\ntheir reply, M. Lewandowski, the representative of one of the greatest\r\ncredit establishments in France, wished to gain some practical experience\r\nof the phenomenon. He took the most certain, most practical means; took\r\nsteamer, crossed the ocean, and landed in the Argentine. With the learned\r\ncollaboration of Señor Alberto Martinez, one of the most competent of\r\nmen in matters of statistics and finance, he made a profound study of\r\neconomic questions, and the present book is the outcome of their common\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThis book should be read by all those who are not convinced that the word\r\nEurope sums up all humanity; but who take the pains, on the contrary, to\r\nfollow the development of all other nations; understanding how necessary\r\nit is for the great nations to observe the progress and evolution of\r\nthe younger peoples. Thus they avoid the risk of being surprised by the\r\nsudden apparition of great economic or political forces which they had\r\nnot foreseen, or by which they had not known how to profit.\r\n\r\nSouth America suffers from a prejudice that we cannot unhappily disclaim\r\nas being unjustified. The directing classes in France, as in all other\r\nEuropean nations, with the exception of a small commercial and financial\r\ncircle, seem to have been kept in intentional ignorance of all things\r\nrelating to the nations of the new continent. The Argentine, Chili,\r\nBrazil, Venezuela, Ecuador,——countries separated one from another by\r\nenormous distances——are none the less, for the generality of Europeans,\r\nmore or less one and the same thing; that is, they form a kind of\r\na geographical nebulosity, which is known as _South America_. The\r\npost-office employés of Buenos Ayres have often occasion to smile when\r\nthey read the addresses inscribed on the envelopes of letters dispatched\r\nby the learned and scientific bodies of Europe, and Argentines residing\r\nabroad continually find food for reflection in the questions asked them\r\nby persons occupying the highest positions.\r\n\r\nYet for the old world there is every incentive to study more closely\r\nthe development of these new peoples. It is enough to point out that\r\nthe Argentine to-day occupies as significant a position as that held by\r\nthe United States at the beginning of the nineteenth century; and that\r\nits continued evolution will undoubtedly, before the end of the present\r\ncentury, give it an importance equal to that of the United States at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with Mr Roosevelt and his Secretary of State, Colonel\r\nJohn Hay, I had occasion to make this very remark, and the President\r\nreplied, with the rapidity of judgment and the affirmative tone which are\r\nso characteristic of his mind: “In less time than that; you will find\r\nfifty years enough; for you will profit by all our experience and all the\r\nhuman progress effected during the nineteenth century.”\r\n\r\nThe shadow of discredit which has hitherto lain upon South America is\r\nexplained by the continual anarchy to which the majority of its peoples\r\nhave lent themselves since the immense colonial empire of Spain threw off\r\nits fetters in the first quarter of the last century, in order to break\r\nup into fifteen separate republics. This anarchy and disorganisation,\r\ncompared with the orderly spirit of progress which has reigned in the\r\ngreat republic of the North, have given rise to the belief, to-day\r\ngeneral, that the so different destiny of these States was due to the\r\nspecial qualities and aptitudes of the Anglo-Saxon race, which the Latin\r\nraces lacked.\r\n\r\nThis belief results from a superficial and incomplete examination of the\r\nfacts, and has gained easy acceptance, even in works of a more or less\r\nscientific nature, such as _The Psychological Laws of the Evolution of\r\nPeoples_, in which the author cites, with regard to the Latin races and\r\nthe peoples of South America, a number of inaccurate and prejudiced\r\nfacts, which have been gathered from the writings of a dyspeptic and\r\nill-tempered journalist. Such data have caused M. Gustave Lebon to deduce\r\npsychological laws which are hardly favourable to the South American\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to gain some idea of the true causes of this diversity of\r\ndestiny between the peoples of North and South America, we must study the\r\norigin of each and the particular form which colonisation has assumed in\r\neach case; forms imposed by the force of historic facts rather than by\r\nthe will of man.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons arrived in the American coasts and founded, in the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century, such cities as Boston, Charleston,\r\nPhiladelphia, etc., when America had already been discovered and explored\r\nby the Spaniards a century and a half before. These colonies were formed\r\nof groups of families who had abandoned their mother-country to seek a\r\nnew one, where they could live and labour free from the persecutions of\r\nreligious and political intolerance.\r\n\r\nWhen these colonies attained a certain fame, the surplus of the\r\noverflowing populations of Europe was naturally attracted by these virgin\r\nand fertile lands, relatively near at hand though across the ocean. Thus\r\nthere formed a current of immigration which rapidly peopled America and\r\nutilised the great natural resources of its enormous territory. In this\r\nway was gradually formed a new people, which was to a certain extent a\r\ndevelopment of the various nations from which it originated, and which\r\npreserved their customs and their political and social habits.\r\n\r\nThese colonists began by buying land of the native tribes; but,\r\nincreasing in numbers and in strength, they found it more convenient\r\nto rob them, thus forcing the Red Indians to retreat towards the north\r\nand west; and for reasons of self-respect, or on account of religious\r\nprinciples, no deliberate attempt was made to mingle with the indigenous\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThis form of colonisation, whose prime cause was to be found in\r\npersecution, not in the execution of a preconceived plan, resulted in the\r\nexistence, at the end of the eighteenth century, of thirteen colonies\r\npeopled exclusively by men of the white races, originally natives of\r\nthe countries of Northern Europe, who had transported to this new soil\r\ntheir manners and customs, their social and political laws, their\r\nliberal traditions and their economic system, so that from the moment\r\nthey declared themselves independent, they were able immediately to form\r\na single nation, united by all the ties which make for the cohesion of a\r\npeople.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The late Signor Pellegrini, in his anxiety to defend the\r\nLatin races, is not strictly impartial. At the time of the Declaration\r\nof Independence the population of the States was very largely English\r\n(with a substratum of Dutch in New York) but of different periods; and\r\nthese different periods preserved their own traditions. The difference\r\nbetween the New England Quaker and the Kentucky trapper, or the Virginian\r\nfox-hunting squire, and the Dutch patroon or Highland crofter, was as\r\ngreat as any to be found among the Latin races, if not greater, and was\r\nlargely a difference of arrested periods as well as a racial and a social\r\ndifference. The result was that Federalism was accomplished peacefully\r\nonly by the genius of Hamilton.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nTo attain such progress, to reach the summit on which they rest to-day,\r\nthe United States had only to persist in the same path, to follow the\r\nsame groove, and the incontestable merit of this people and of its great\r\nstatesmen is that they have been faithful to the principles of liberty\r\nand equality which they inherited from their ancestors, the venerable\r\n“conscript fathers”; principles which they ratified in the admirable\r\nConstitution whence this vast political organism has derived its\r\ncohesion, its vitality, and its strength.\r\n\r\nHow different were the origins of the peoples of Latin America! The\r\nSpanish sailors did not cross the ocean like the passengers of the\r\n_Mayflower_, or the companions of Penn, seeking solitary shores, known\r\nthough distant, where they might establish a home, there to live and\r\nlabour in peace and liberty.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish navigators, as brave as they were audacious, launched\r\nthemselves into the unknown, guided only by their own genius, in order to\r\ndiscover a world, to conquer new lands, new subjects, for their country\r\nand their king; and in the pursuit of that heroic dream they performed\r\nexploits which to this day amaze us by their audacity.\r\n\r\nThese were the famous _conquistadores_, whom one of their descendants,\r\nJosé Maria Hérédia, has celebrated in the admirable lines:——\r\n\r\n      “As from the natal charnel-heap a flight\r\n          Of falcons: sick of purseless pride at home\r\n          By Murcian Palos pilots and captains come\r\n      With brutal and heroic dreams alight:\r\n\r\n      They seek the fabulous ore that comes to birth\r\n          And ripens in Cipango’s distant mines,\r\n          And the trade-wind their long lateens inclines\r\n      Toward the dim limits of the Western earth.”\r\n\r\nThese first colonisers of Spanish America——soldiers, missionaries,\r\nofficials, adventurers, men without family——seized upon a whole\r\ncontinent, which they discovered and conquered at the price of unheard-of\r\nexertions. They parcelled out the land, subjugated the native tribes,\r\nreducing them to servitude in their famous _encomiendas_, or putting\r\ninto experimental practice, as in the Jesuit missions, theories of\r\ncollectivism, which is to-day regarded as a modern invention. It was a\r\ntrue feudal system that arose in the new world.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: It must be remembered, in comparing North with South\r\nAmerica, that the former also had its period of extensive slavery, its\r\nplantations worked by convict labour, and for a period an almost feudal\r\nsystem.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nIf, on the one hand, the native races were initiated into the doctrines\r\nof Catholicism in exchange for their liberty and independence, they\r\ndid not, on the other hand, receive from their masters any political\r\ninstruction, but preserved their habits of submission and passive\r\nobedience to their chief, which constituted their sole political\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the day of emancipation arrived, and this enormous\r\ncolony, in arms against its oppressors, declared itself independent, and\r\ndivided itself into several Republics, the great mass of the population\r\nconsisted of Indians converted to Christianity, and half-breeds, who\r\npreserved their habits unchanged and had no ideas, no traditions, other\r\nthan that of government by individual might.\r\n\r\nOnly in the urban centres did the white race, with its conception of\r\npolitical institutions, predominate. And when the new Government wished\r\nto organise itself in an independent manner, the two tendencies and\r\ntraditions, which correspond to two distinct mentalities, violently\r\nclashed, and began that long struggle, not wholly terminated even to-day,\r\nof which the history is the history of anarchism in America.\r\n\r\nAnother factor that also procured this conflict was the colonial\r\npolitical economy of Spain, which was not only a mistake, but a mistake\r\nof the period; an error which closed the whole continent to commerce,\r\nshut it away from the outer world, and maintained these masses of\r\nhumanity in ignorance and isolation, in order to exploit them simply as a\r\nmachine, or as an element of wealth for the service of their masters.\r\n\r\nThe problem which confronted the politicians of South America when they\r\nfound themselves face to face with this new people, whom they must of\r\nnecessity organise, was thus very different from, and far more difficult\r\nthan the problem which the founders of the North American Union had to\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nThese native masses obeyed with all their might and with the utmost\r\nenthusiasm so long as it was a question of fighting against the foreign\r\ntroops and of winning their independence; but, victory once assured,\r\nguided by their leaders, the _caudillos_, most of whom were white, they\r\nrevolted against the tendencies which began to show themselves among\r\nthe Europeans of the cities, and in many places succeeded in dominating\r\nover them by force of numbers, thus preventing all political and\r\nadministrative progress, and maintaining, as their form of government,\r\nthe personal, arbitrary, and irresponsible power of a leader, that is, of\r\nthe _caudillo_.\r\n\r\nThe written Constitutions which these people had established upon\r\ndeclaring their independence, and which were inspired by the\r\nConstitutions of the United States or the Swiss Republic, were thus\r\nreduced to a dead letter, as they were in complete contradiction to the\r\npolitical habits of the mass of the populace, and required, for their\r\napplication, a political education which the peoples of South America did\r\nnot possess. A whole century had to elapse before immigration, material\r\ninterest, and the influence of civilisation, were able slowly to modify\r\nthe political mentality of these peoples, by reinforcing and popularising\r\nthe principles of government, extirpating the elements and suppressing\r\nthe causes of the anarchy which had so long disturbed them.\r\n\r\nAmong the nations which experienced these beneficent influences, the\r\nSpanish colony known as the _Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata_, to-day\r\nthe Argentine Republic, was quite specially favoured. Its territory,\r\ncomposed of immense prairies, the celebrated Argentine “pampas,”\r\nstretching from the sea-coast and the river littoral, offered the unique\r\nwealth of their fertility and their climate. There were no mines of gold\r\nor silver to arouse the greed of adventurers; they came to these regions\r\nonly to traverse them, and so to proceed immediately to the gold-bearing\r\nregions of the distant Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the first colonists who established themselves on the banks of\r\nthe Plata, repulsed and expelled by the natives, were forced to abandon\r\na certain number of cattle and horses, which found in these prairies an\r\nadmirable opportunity to live and multiply in freedom, until finally they\r\nformed the immense herds of wild cattle and horses, whose hides became\r\nthe principal wealth and the chief article of commerce of these regions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Rio de la Plata had no commercial relations with the outside\r\nworld, and was only able to trade with Cadiz, the immensity and the\r\nsolitude of its shores favoured a contraband trade; to such a degree that\r\nEnglish, Dutch, and Portuguese smugglers came from all parts to exchange\r\ntheir manufactured articles for the hides of these wild herds.——This it\r\nis that explains how Buenos Ayres was able from the outset to become a\r\ngreat commercial centre, in which the trades dependent upon stock-raising\r\nquickly occupied the first place.\r\n\r\nCommercial activity, the development of communication by sea, the\r\nfertility of the soil, the climate——all contributed from the early days\r\nof emancipation to attract European immigration. This immigration, like\r\nthat which peopled the America of the north, was composed of families who\r\ncame to settle, to form new homes, to labour. These families, following\r\nthe example of their predecessors in the United States and for the same\r\ncauses, did not mingle with the native tribes, but struggled against\r\nthem, and forced them to abandon their lands and fly to the south,\r\nuntil at last, after a long and cruel struggle, they almost completely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThis immigration increased year by year, and to-day the great majority of\r\nthe population of the Argentine Republic——a population now exceeding 5\r\nmillions——is of European origin.\r\n\r\nThat this immigration, which flows from all the nations of Europe, has\r\nbeen the chief agent of the present prosperity of the Argentine, and\r\nis the condition of its future greatness, is an incontestable fact.\r\nOne of our leading statesmen has declared, of America, that “to govern\r\nis to people”; and this aphorism has remained a fundamental principle\r\nof government. To recognise the full force of this assertion, we must\r\nreflect that these unusually fertile prairies, situated in a privileged\r\nclimate, near the sea-coast or on the banks of enormous rivers, navigable\r\neven by transatlantic steamers, need nothing but human labour to\r\ntransform them, with less effort and at less expense than anywhere else\r\nin the world, into immense fields of wheat or maize, or pastures of\r\nlucerne, covered with herds, able to produce bread and meat enough to\r\nfeed all Europe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the agricultural production of the Argentine Republic\r\nis limited only by the number of hands which lend themselves to its\r\nexploitation; in which we have a repetition of the very phenomenon which\r\nhas served as the foundation of the development of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the progress of the Argentine Republic is a\r\nnecessary and inevitable fact, which extraordinary circumstances might\r\nfor a time retard, but which nothing could finally arrest; except,\r\nindeed, one could restrain the daily exodus of fresh swarms from the\r\nhuman hive, which abandon the old soils, exhausted by production, to seek\r\nout the fertile, virgin, and unpeopled areas of the globe.\r\n\r\nHitherto this exodus has been directed principally to the United States;\r\nattracted thither by a host of special and favouring circumstances. But\r\nthe time is rapidly approaching when North America in turn will find\r\nherself populated to the saturation point, and will no longer be able to\r\nreceive the hosts which benefited her formerly. The laws of the United\r\nStates are already beginning to impose conditions upon immigration which\r\nare constantly becoming more severe; and these laws are imposed by the\r\ntwo great political forces——the superior social classes and the lower\r\nclasses of the people.\r\n\r\nThe upper classes, Anglo-Saxon in origin, fear that contemporary\r\nimmigration, coming as it does from peoples of alien race, from the\r\nsouth or east of Europe, may modify or enfeeble those great moral and\r\npolitical qualities to which they attribute the greatness and prosperity\r\nof their nation. On the other hand, the federated workers see in these\r\nnew arrivals, healthy and vigorous, but having fewer needs, a source\r\nof dangerous competition, which may have a disastrous influence on\r\nconditions of labour and payment.\r\n\r\nThe stream of irrigation which is now setting in towards the United\r\nStates, and which amounted in numbers to 800,000 in the year 1904, must\r\nnecessarily therefore, as time goes on, turn aside in other directions,\r\nand as it will nowhere meet with more advantageous circumstances than in\r\nthe Argentine, it will flow thither as it flows already, but in greater\r\nand greater numbers, resulting in a development of wealth and power\r\nsuperior to any hitherto known.\r\n\r\nSome persons, however, formulate certain reservations as to the\r\nconsistency and the political and social value of nations formed by these\r\nhuman inundations, composed as they are of men of different races, having\r\nneither the same language, nor the same religion, nor the same customs;\r\nthey doubt whether this new Babel can give birth to a national spirit\r\nsufficiently vigorous to impress a character of political and moral unity\r\nupon these new recruits.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove that these fears are ill-founded, we have only to take\r\nthe practical example furnished by the United States. Into this vast\r\nnational crucible there poured, from the outset, the stream of emigration\r\nfrom Great Britain, Holland, France, and Spain; later came Scandinavians,\r\nGermans, Lithuanians, Poles, Hungarians, Italians, Syrians and Arabs.\r\nFrom the fusion of all these elements has issued a new race, homogeneous\r\nand powerful, with a strong national spirit which is known as “the\r\nAmerican spirit,” and under that name has won the respect of the world.\r\nThis result is neither accidental nor due to special antecedents; it is\r\nthe consequence of a natural evolution, ably and intelligently directed.\r\n\r\nThe European law, which attributes to the son the nationality of his\r\nfather, may have had its justification in the past; to-day it is\r\nmaintained only by force of tradition.\r\n\r\nNationality and love of country are only an extension of the love of the\r\nfamily and the home; and these sentiments cannot, any more than others,\r\nbe forced upon one by law. There can exist for a man only the home and\r\nthe family in which he was born and bred. Doubtless he will feel himself\r\nattached to the home of his forbears by ties of sentiment and respect;\r\nbut all the roots of his intimate feelings bind him to the home and the\r\nfamily into which he was born; they are in his blood, and thence he has\r\nreceived the first impressions which mould his character and imprint\r\nthose characteristics which form his personality.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with nationality and the mother-country. It is useless to\r\nattempt to persuade either child or man that his country is not that in\r\nwhich he was born, in which he has grown up, but another distant country\r\nwhich he has neither known nor seen.\r\n\r\nThe difference of origin among the children of immigrants of different\r\nnationalities disappears in childhood, through the community of life in\r\nschool and workshop; through sharing alike in work and play; and it is in\r\nthe earlier years of life that the mind is moulded by its surroundings;\r\nin these years develops that feeling of attachment to the soil, of union,\r\nsolidarity, and common memories, that shows itself later in an ardent\r\npatriotism. Unity of language necessarily favours the process of fusion,\r\nand explains the fact that the descendants of immigrants of different\r\nrace, religion, language, habits and traditions, are able to fuse so\r\ncompletely as to form a perfectly homogeneous population, one in mind and\r\nin sentiment, thus constituting a new nationality, young, vigorous and\r\nstrongly individual.\r\n\r\nWe have thus under our eyes a practical example of the unity of the human\r\nrace. The hazards of life, in the course of centuries, having dispersed\r\nthe primitive race throughout the earth, it has formed, under the\r\ninfluence of circumstances, new types, which in the course of time have\r\nmet and mingled, to form new crosses in their turn, which as a matter of\r\nfact are only the modalities of a common primitive race.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon is being repeated in the Argentine, as in all\r\nthe American republics, and the spontaneous and vital sentiment of\r\nnationality continually strikes the observer, who notes the pride with\r\nwhich a child born in Argentina, whether he be the son of a Spaniard,\r\nFrenchman, Italian, or German, affirms, when questioned, that his\r\ncountry is the Argentine.\r\n\r\nThus this Republic possesses all the requisite conditions of becoming,\r\nwith the passage of time, one of the greatest nations of the earth. Its\r\nterritory is immense and fertile, its surface being equal to that of all\r\nEurope, excepting Russia; it is capable of supporting with care at least\r\n100 millions of human beings; almost every climate is to be found within\r\nits limits, and, consequently, it can yield all products, from those of\r\nthe tropics to those of the polar regions. Its rivers and its mountains\r\nare among the greatest of the globe. As its maritime frontier it has the\r\nAtlantic, which brings it into contact with the whole world.\r\n\r\nIt is governed by institutions more liberal than those of any other\r\nnation, especially in all that affects the foreigner; it regards the\r\ninflux of immigration with approval, and seeks to promote it. In\r\nproportion as its vast vacant spaces become peopled their value is\r\nincreased tenfold, and production grows at an enormous pace; for a\r\nsingle family, by the aid of modern machinery, can exploit a larger\r\narea of soil, yielding a produce far greater than is required for its\r\nown consumption; a fact which explains the surprising rate at which the\r\nexport trade has increased.\r\n\r\nSuch are the true causes of the prosperity of this country, as is proved,\r\nwith abundant detail, by MM. Martinez and Lewandowski; and as these\r\ncauses are not accidental, but fundamental and permanent, they should\r\nproduce in South America the same results as in the North.\r\n\r\nGranted that wealth and prosperity are essentially conservative elements,\r\nwe have here a serious guarantee of political stability; the more so as\r\nthe country has already passed the difficult age and is cured of the\r\nmalady endemic to South America——anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be hoped that our Argentine politicians, taught by\r\nexperience, and comprehending all the responsibilities imposed upon\r\nthem by their noble mission——the work of racial regeneration and the\r\nbetterment of South America——will succeed in making constitutional\r\ngovernment an actual fact, by restraining and uprooting the tendency to\r\npersonal power, which is the lamentable heritage of indigenous tradition.\r\n\r\nIt is a great nation that is rising on the brink of the twentieth\r\ncentury; the mistress of an enormous inheritance. Immigration and the\r\nincrease of the birth-rate are furnishing it with the arms it requires;\r\nit lacks only those reserves of capital which, like all new peoples, it\r\nhas not as yet had time to create.\r\n\r\nIn no country can European capital find a more fertile or advantageous\r\nfield for its operations: a fact already well known in England; and one\r\nthe authors of this book have wished to emphasise for the greater benefit\r\nof French capital. In this they serve the interests of France and, still\r\nmore particularly, those of the Argentine Republic; and in the name of\r\nmy own compatriots, as well as for myself, I take this opportunity of\r\nexpressing my sincere gratitude.\r\n\r\n                                                    C. PELLEGRINI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ARGENTINE IN THE\r\n                              20TH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GENERAL PLAN AND METHOD OF THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore commencing a study of the financial and economic situation in the\r\nArgentine Republic, it is important to decide at the outset as to the\r\nspirit in which this examination should be pursued, and the method most\r\nproper to such an inquiry. We tread upon a novel and peculiar field, and\r\nany too rigid comparison with the events of other countries might easily\r\nlead us to errors of appreciation.\r\n\r\nAbove all we must practise the philosophical principle _nil admirari_;\r\nwe must be astonished at nothing, and abstain from all too absolute\r\njudgments. Although, as the figures of foreign trade will show, the\r\nprogress of the country has surpassed all expectation, it is, on the\r\nother hand, almost impossible to foretell how far the results of one year\r\nwill be ratified by the year following.\r\n\r\nLike all young nations, the Argentine progresses on its path to the\r\nunknown by leaps and bounds; it is as yet in an unstable condition, in\r\nwhich the oscillations of prosperity are still of great amplitude and\r\nexceedingly sudden.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to discern the cause of this essentially unstable condition.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine, in its present phase, is an agricultural country, whose\r\nprincipal sources of wealth are cereals and stock-raising; the result\r\nis that each year the whole life of the country is affected by the\r\nharvest.[13] On the harvest depends, in a great degree, the movements of\r\nexternal commerce; it produces those sudden changes which occur from\r\nyear to year, and which result occasionally in a variation of £8,000,000\r\nto £12,000,000 above or below the average.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: We use the word harvest here in its widest sense, but we\r\nmust ultimately distinguish the results of stock-raising from those of\r\nagriculture, since they do not necessarily vary in the same direction.]\r\n\r\nThe harvest influences not only the exports, more than half of which\r\nconsist of agricultural products, but has no less an influence on the\r\nvalue of importations.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The value of the exports in 1907 was £59,240,874, and\r\naccording to the official figures the products of agriculture amounted to\r\n£32,818,324.]\r\n\r\nThe national powers of consumption are, in fact, very intimately\r\nconnected with the measure of the agricultural output; as the latter\r\nis bad or good, the home consumption absorbs more or fewer imported\r\nproducts. Thus the poor harvests of 1901 and 1902, which resulted in a\r\nfall of nearly £1,800,000 in the cereal exports, produced in 1902 a fall\r\nof £800,000 in the imports of iron and materials used for construction.\r\nThe same depression was visible in the imports of textiles and beverages,\r\nand still more so in those of articles _de luxe_. The spending powers\r\nof the country being closely dependent on the facility of realising the\r\nproducts of the soil, it is easy to understand that in the case of a bad\r\nharvest or a poor market the consumers have no longer the same powers of\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nWe find the same ups and downs in the figures of the Budget, the\r\ncontributive powers of the country being influenced by the same causes\r\nas its consumption. If the crops are poor, the Budget of the following\r\nyear shows immediate traces of the fact. Thus in 1902, the year of the\r\nbad harvest, the total receipts were estimated at £5,534,000 in paper,\r\nand £9,486,669 in gold; but the actual receipts were only £5,221,000 in\r\npaper, and £8,047,755 in gold; a deficit of £1,438,913 in gold.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Customs receipts, which are the most variable item\r\nof the revenue, on account of their direct relation to consumption, have\r\nfallen from one year to another (as in 1903 compared with 1902), as much\r\nas £1,200,000 in consequence of the agricultural crisis.\r\n\r\nThere is an equally direct relation between the financial situation and\r\nthe results of the harvest. If the commercial balance is favourable, the\r\nArgentine becomes a creditor of foreign countries by the excess of its\r\nexportations, and the resulting payments in gold, after the deductions\r\nof the interest on the foreign debt, increase the proportion between the\r\nmetallic currency and the monetary circulation in general.\r\n\r\nAs these few examples prove, the prosperity of the country is\r\nsubordinated to the result of the harvest; the latter gives the measure\r\nof all improvement, all progress of a financial and economic order.\r\nUnlike the ancient European nations, the Argentine Republic has no\r\nreserves of accumulated capital behind it, so that it can live on its own\r\nsavings in times of crisis. Its commerce and its industries depend almost\r\nexclusively upon its agricultural yield, and share all the latter’s\r\nvicissitudes.\r\n\r\nAll depends on the value of the soil, the basis of public and private\r\nwealth. The power of expenditure which follows a good harvest may\r\ncontribute towards proving personal property, but the latter remains\r\nalways strictly related to the agricultural yield and general produce of\r\nthe soil, and does not constitute an easily-realised reserve.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, we must recognise that, as a rule, this capital does not\r\nremain inactive, and is as little as possible sterilised by investment\r\nin the public funds. Those who possess available cash, in the shape\r\nof revenue from a large estate, usually employ it by increasing their\r\nstock of cattle, or in reclaiming more land, or by investing it in other\r\nestates; so that all that comes from the earth returns to the earth, and\r\ngoes to increase its yield.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar situation of this great agricultural country, which\r\nconstitutes at once the strength and the instability of the Republic,\r\nshows us in what spirit and by what method it should be studied. All\r\ndepends upon the yield of the soil, for this is the great dispenser of\r\nthe national wealth; it is therefore the agricultural system that we must\r\nexamine first of all, if we wish to arrive at a solution of the problems\r\narising from the present condition of the Argentine or predict its future.\r\n\r\nTo follow out this general plan, we must consider the country first\r\nof all from two standpoints: we must examine into its production and\r\nits markets or outlets, in order to learn the true conditions of its\r\nexistence, the value of its soil, and its sources of revenue.\r\n\r\nWe shall then proceed to examine its administrative machinery, showing\r\nhow the Argentine lives and progresses as a nation, and to analyse its\r\nfinancial and monetary organisation with reference to the economic\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe two portions of this scheme are closely connected, and their study\r\nmust lead us to the same conclusion, that the Argentine is a nation in\r\na state of growth, and, like all young nations, still uncertain of its\r\nfirst steps; but it is animated by a spirit of initiative, and urged by\r\nthe breath of progress, which may lead it to a high destiny among the\r\ngreat productive countries of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ARGENTINE NATIONALITY[15]\r\n\r\nIs there an Argentine nationality, and what is its significance in\r\n    respect of the territory it occupies?——The formation of this\r\n    nationality.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the qualities of the Argentine people.——Sense\r\n    of progress; remarkable faculty of assimilation: character\r\n    essentially practical.——The fusion of the Latin genius with\r\n    Anglo-Saxon energy.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the political world, with its instability and\r\n    lack of organisation, and the economic world, which manifests\r\n    intense vitality and national progress.——The necessity of\r\n    developing the national idea, and of raising it above material\r\n    questions.——The slow elaboration of a new race born of the\r\n    various elements of immigration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: We must here explain that the Argentine possesses two\r\ncurrencies: the piastre or dollar, whose value is 5 francs, and the paper\r\npiastre, which by the law of conversion is equivalent to 2 francs 20, or\r\n1s. 7·2d.\r\n\r\nAs for weights and measures, the decimal metric system has been adopted.\r\nIn surveying large areas, the square league is occasionally employed as\r\nunit, which contains 2500 hectares, or 5628 acres = about 9-1/2 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nWe should also explain that the Argentine Republic, of which the Federal\r\ncapital is Buenos Ayres, is divided into fourteen autonomous Provinces\r\nand ten national Territories. The Provinces, in the order of population,\r\nare as follows: Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé, Córdoba, Entre Rios, Corrientès,\r\nTucuman, Santiago de l’Estero, Mendoza, Salta, Catamarca, San Juan, San\r\nLuis, La Rioja, and Jujuy.\r\n\r\nThe national Territories are: La Pampa, Misionès, Nequen, Rio Negro,\r\nChaco, Formosa, Chubut, Santa Cruz, the Andes, and Tierra del Fuego.]\r\n\r\nTo present a complete picture of the Argentine, it is not enough\r\nto describe its configuration, its great rivers, its climate, its\r\npopulation, its forms of agriculture, and the value of its soil; all\r\nthis is a dead letter, and will by no means yield us the secret of the\r\ncountry’s future, unless we first resolve one question of a sociological\r\ncharacter: Is there an Argentine nationality, and what does it signify\r\nin respect of the territory which it occupies? Could one, for instance,\r\nestimate the importance of the United States merely from the point of\r\nview of their agricultural and mineral wealth, without taking into\r\naccount the work and the character of the admirable Anglo-Saxon race,\r\nwhich has adapted itself to American soil, and has succeeded in obtaining\r\nfrom it its full value?\r\n\r\nAnd could we explain the fact that certain countries of South America,\r\nwhich also, thanks to their natural wealth, have all the elements of\r\nrapid development, have remained stationary, and hardly count as nations,\r\nif the question of race did not throw light on the mystery, showing us\r\nthat with the most favourable factors of the soil, a ferment is essential\r\nto start the growth of the seed?\r\n\r\nConcerning the Argentine, this then is the problem which we have to\r\nconsider, if we wish to see further than the present moment, and to judge\r\nin what measure its progress may be consolidated and even accelerated. In\r\nother terms, we must understand whether the Argentine must depend upon\r\na fortuitous grouping of individuals brought together by the various\r\nstreams of immigration, and having no common tie but the desire to enrich\r\nthemselves, or whether these various elements are destined to become\r\nfused, and in time to form a true nationality, with its own traditions,\r\nits own ideal.\r\n\r\nThis latter is naturally the end to be pursued by the Argentine\r\nGovernment, if it wishes to prepare for the future by making moral and\r\nmaterial progress go hand in hand. Its _role_ is not to manage the\r\ncountry like a directing syndicate, but to direct all individual efforts,\r\nall initiative, and all other available forces, to the same national and\r\npatriotic end.\r\n\r\nIt was this idea that a President of the Republic, Señor Quintana, felt\r\nit his duty to enunciate, when, upon assuming the Presidential authority,\r\nhe stated, in his inaugural message: “I am the head of a nation which has\r\nin America an ideal”; and he added: “There is one common characteristic\r\namong us that was discovered as early as the colonial period, in the\r\nmagnitude of plans of campaign, in the clamour of intestine conflict, in\r\nthe government of the constitutional period; it is, that we all bear in\r\nour hearts the sense of our future greatness.”\r\n\r\nHow far can these aspirations be translated into facts? That is a\r\nquestion we must examine seriously and with an absolutely unbiassed\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nWe cannot study this question of the Argentine nationality in books;\r\nfor a country which has been so rapidly carried away on the tide of\r\nmaterial progress has but little time to examine itself. Neither has it\r\nbeen able to form a literature or a sociology which might reflect the\r\ndominant characteristics of the generation; it is only by an inquiry and\r\nan analysis of the facts that we can isolate this element of nationality\r\nfrom the various foreign elements which have contributed to its formation.\r\n\r\nOne factor that facilitates our task is the clear-sightedness of the\r\nArgentines themselves, who are the first to recognise, with abundant\r\ngood-temper, their own shortcomings. They are almost exaggerated in their\r\nself-criticisms when depicting themselves; and our work has been cut out\r\nfor us in avoiding too hasty generalisations and in softening certain too\r\nrigorous judgments, although these emanated from men who were certainly\r\nin a position to understand the tendencies of their generation.\r\n\r\nOne principle dominates the whole question: it is that which a\r\ncontemporary historian expresses in these terms: “When peoples come into\r\ncontact they begin by an exchange of their faults.” Such an observation\r\nmight well apply to a people like the Argentines, who are not yet settled\r\non their own foundations, and are constantly increased by immigration.\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of the Latin race have contributed to form this people:\r\nSpain and Italy have made the largest contributions, and France has also\r\nin her time contributed her share. The Argentine has even assimilated a\r\nBasque population, of especial interest on account of its aptitude for\r\nagricultural work, and its adaptability to its new surroundings.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Anglo-Saxons have also entered the Argentine, to mingle\r\nwith the Latin element, and have given great assistance in opening up\r\nthe country, by setting an influential example of initiative, progress,\r\nand energy. This penetration of the Latin race, a little indolent and\r\ninactive as it is, by the energetic and progressive Anglo-Saxons, enables\r\nus the better to understand the good and bad qualities of the Argentine\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nIn short, if we are to obtain an unbiassed view of the national\r\nphysiognomy of this adolescent people, we must remember that its good\r\nqualities, like its faults, are the result of the commingling of the\r\nvaried elements which have entered the country by immigration; elements\r\nthat have mixed and reacted upon each other, so that their dominant\r\ncharacteristics have finally appeared in the Argentine character.\r\n\r\nThere is one gift which we cannot deny this people: intelligence,\r\njoined to a remarkable power of assimilation. It also has that gift of\r\nenterprise, that sense of progress, which are found in the Anglo-Saxon\r\nraces, and which have found such magnificent scope in the United States.\r\n\r\nA young nation, without a past, the Argentine is not impeded, like most\r\nof the Latin nations, by a load of custom, prejudice, and routine,\r\nhampering its motions and impeding its progress. Profiting by the\r\nexperience of others, it knows how to adapt itself to the best; taking\r\nits good wherever it finds it. It creates nothing, invents nothing, but\r\nappropriates all new ideas, which find upon its soil the conditions\r\nfavourable to a rapid expansion. It is, indeed, formed after the likeness\r\nof its own soil, which produces without effort and lends itself admirably\r\nto every kind of culture.\r\n\r\nThis sense of progress is certainly the most characteristic trait of the\r\nArgentine, and the one by which it is distinguished among the other Latin\r\nnations of South America. Uruguay, for example, which possesses a soil as\r\nrich, and offers the same facility of transport, has given no proofs of\r\ninitiative and vitality to lead one to hope that she has really entered\r\nupon the path of progress. It is the same with Paraguay and many other\r\nStates, which have not succeeded in accomplishing any of the changes\r\ndemanded by modern civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine, on the contrary, has always known how to derive benefit\r\nfrom whatever source was available, thanks to the current of immigration\r\nwhich keeps it in permanent touch with foreign countries. It has also\r\nassimilated the inventions and the methods of more civilised nations,\r\nand has attracted men capable of applying them. At the head of the great\r\nadministrations of the State, one often finds specialists from Europe\r\nor the United States, who bring the fruits of their experience, and\r\nincrease the intellectual possessions of the nation. The departments of\r\nrailroads, navigation, public works, and hygiene, thanks to these happy\r\nselections, offer every security of efficiency in operation.\r\n\r\nOne may say, it is true, that this is the result of foreign influence;\r\nbut what does the origin of all these improvements signify in respect\r\nof the future, so long as they become incorporated in the life of the\r\nArgentine and contribute to its evolution? One thing which proves that\r\nthe instinct for progress is at the heart of the national temperament is\r\nthat it is found in the lower strata of certain public services in which\r\nthe foreign element plays no part. The administration of the police,\r\nfor instance, and that of the posts and telegraphs, to cite no other\r\nexamples, are conducted with as great a regularity as in any European\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThus, while allowing that the initiative of all improvements comes from\r\nabroad, we must not overlook the fact that the Argentine has assimilated\r\nthem with the utmost facility, and that this gift of assimilation forms\r\nto-day a valuable portion of the national patrimony.\r\n\r\nDespite its eminently cosmopolitan character, which is a peculiarity of\r\nits development, the Argentine Republic has succeeded in retaining its\r\nown personality among so many diverse elements. It is the type of the\r\nmodern nation, whose ideal is that of the United States——_business_. A\r\nman is _zonzo_ or _vivo_——a fool or more than capable——there is no medium.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view the Argentine is at the apex of its period; it\r\nhas no use for abstract ideas or immortal principles; its ambition being\r\nabove all to sell its corn and cattle and to enrich itself. Behind the\r\nagitation of the political parties there is no other object than this:\r\nto share in the exploitation of the country and to enjoy its wealth.\r\nThe heroic period is over for the Argentine; its independence is to-day\r\ndefinitely assured; it pursues no dreams of conquest now, but seeks only\r\npacific victories for its products in the great international markets.\r\n\r\nProsaic as the present generation is, it is not, from our point of view,\r\ncompletely without nobility; it loves its native soil and glorifies it;\r\nnot, assuredly, after the fashion of Virgil saluting the Latin soil,\r\nfertile of heroes, but as a land productive of rich harvests, and the\r\nsource of material prosperity. This it is that explains the powerful\r\nattraction which the Argentine exercises upon all those who have trodden\r\nits soil. The country progresses with such rapidity, the value of the\r\nsoil increases in such proportions, that the most indifferent end by\r\nbeing drawn into the stream. Those who come to live here without any idea\r\nof final residence make up their minds to settle as soon as they hold the\r\nsmallest parcel of property. When a man has lived some little time in the\r\nArgentine, and has watched the spectacle of its rapid development, he is\r\nquickly seized by the business vitality which forces him to take part in\r\nthe great movement.\r\n\r\nThis love of the Argentine for his land may certainly have its noble\r\nside, but he knows nothing of the moving spirit of poetry which clothes\r\nthat love in the old countries of Europe, where man becomes attached\r\nnot only to the cultivable land, but to all the memories of the native\r\nvillage; the familiar hills and meadows, the old church, and all that\r\nputs us into communication with the soul of places. It would seem as\r\nthough one holds more closely to the earth that demands the most labour,\r\nthe greatest efforts, even the greatest disappointments.\r\n\r\nNo one was ever more attached to the land than the Boer, who lived at\r\npeace in an ungrateful soil, indifferent to the mineral wealth which it\r\nmight conceal. It was this land, where he lived an independent life, that\r\nhe defended so stubbornly; not the gold, which was yet the true wealth of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine also has seen pass over its soil the same rude generation,\r\nhaving no other dream than independence. The “guacho” of old, a mixed\r\ntype of the Indian and Spanish races, the true son of the pampa, was\r\ntruly attached to the immense plain upon which he lived at the call of\r\ncaprice, a wild rider in every sense. To-day the type tends to disappear,\r\nas civilisation, and more especially administration, everywhere make\r\ntheir influence felt; as the ancient virgin pampa is transformed into\r\ncultivable soil, bristling on all hands with barbed wire. As he was not\r\neasy to domesticate, nor break in to any continuous labour, the “guacho”\r\nhas been supplanted little by little by the foreign farmer, the colonist;\r\nand to-day he is almost submerged by the wave of immigration which has\r\ninvaded the country, and which forms now the major part of the population.\r\n\r\nFrom the men of this new generation one must ask no other love for the\r\nsoil than that which is born of the profits they draw from it. They can\r\nmove indifferently from north to south, from east to west; the soil for\r\nthem is everywhere the same, provided the harvest be good. But, apart\r\nfrom that, they nevertheless love this land of promise, and interest\r\nmakes them its children.\r\n\r\nFrom this generation, whose principal traits we have noted, it seems that\r\nwe may in the future expect great things.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, if the world were to return to its old ideal, that of glory\r\nor imperialism, we hardly know what place the Argentine would find in the\r\nscheme of things. It is unsuited to a military policy; it has no ambition\r\nto measure itself with neighbouring nations, which are far more eager for\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nBut if we stand on the economic plane, the only one which interests us,\r\nwe must allow that this generation is well armed for self-defence in\r\nevery field of the commercial struggle. From the fusion of the Latin\r\ngenius with the Anglo-Saxon energy has issued a new product, extremely\r\ncapable in business, full of practical sense, and very open to progress,\r\nwhich will be fully able to hold its own in a century in which money\r\nis the great instrument of domination. This race, formed haphazard of\r\nimmigration, is yet the very race for Argentine soil; between the two\r\nthere is a correspondence, an adaptation, as perfect as if it were the\r\nresult of long-continued design.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the Argentine nationality appears to a foreigner under\r\ntwo distinct aspects; there is its political side, characterised by\r\ninstability and lack of organisation, and the economic side, in which\r\nan intense national life and progress are manifested. Will this truly\r\nabnormal situation, containing both very bad and very good elements,\r\nperhaps, terminate favourably, making of the Argentine people not merely\r\na rich, but also a great nation? Will the development of public affairs,\r\nleft so far to the hazard of politics, even reach the plain of our\r\neconomic development? Will the Argentine nation eliminate, under the\r\npressure of material progress, the leaven of anarchy left behind by\r\na century of civil dissension? This is the secret of the future; this\r\nis the great achievement which remains to be accomplished in order to\r\nconsolidate the present prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nIn short, we must not lose sight of the fact that this prosperity has\r\nhitherto been less the work of man than of nature, which has been\r\nprodigal of her gifts to this fortunate land. This is a thought which\r\nhas been expressed in a speech in the Argentine Senate, in which Senator\r\nUriburu shows that Providence is always coming to the rescue by repairing\r\nthe fault of the State.\r\n\r\n“It is Providence,” he says, “which so opportunely sends us the rains\r\nto water our lands and to raise our marvellous crops; it is Providence\r\nthat has given us the greatest Minister of Finance we have ever known,\r\nour fertile soil and our clear sky; the supreme Minister who looks after\r\nall our needs, who saves us from all difficulties, and who, despite\r\nour errors, continues to ensure the greatness of the Republic. Let\r\nman appropriate his work, but let him render unto Cæsar that which is\r\nCæsar’s.”\r\n\r\nAnd now if by some impossibility the situation were to change: if in\r\nspite of the enormous extension of cultivated lands a period of bad\r\nharvests were to follow the present period of fat cattle: would there not\r\nbe reason to fear that the whole national edifice, founded as it is on\r\nprosperity, might become disintegrated, and crumble under the stroke of\r\nadversity? This is the peril we must indeed seek to avoid; it is for this\r\nreason that the intervention of a strong power seems necessary, in order\r\nto restrain the germs of evil brought by so many races, and to prevent\r\nthe Argentine from falling back into the state of anarchy and revolution\r\nwhich for her is only a distant memory.\r\n\r\nTaking even a more elevated standpoint, we may add that in order to\r\namalgamate all the elements of immigration and to attach them to the\r\ncountry, through good and evil fortune, we need another solvent than\r\npersonal interest or profit. To create a people it may suffice to give it\r\na body, but to make it live it must also be given a soul, at whose breath\r\nthe collectivity of individuals will be transformed into that moral unity\r\nwhich we call the nation. This is a question of prime importance in\r\na country such as the Argentine, where the struggle for existence has\r\ntaken a particularly keen form, which scarcely favours the development of\r\ndisinterested sentiments.\r\n\r\nIt is for the State to develop among its people this national idea, and\r\nto turn all individual efforts to its profit. Its duty is to raise its\r\nauthority above the medley of interest, to restrain ambition within a\r\njust limit by the influence of moral and patriotic ideas, and so to\r\nensure the reign of justice and social peace, without which national\r\nprosperity will never be more than ephemeral.\r\n\r\nIn imagining, from this aspect, the formation of a nationality, we have\r\nno intention of criticising the country; still less do we deny the\r\nprocess of evolution which has gradually transformed its organisation.\r\nA nation is not created in a day, especially when it is a question of\r\na country so young as the Argentine, which in less than a century has\r\nissued from the struggle for independence, and even to-day has hardly rid\r\nitself of the revolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\nFor a nation to become self-conscious, centuries must pass; traditions\r\nmust be formed, and the great moral or intellectual forces of\r\nhumanity——religion, science, literature, even poetry——must develop the\r\nsense of a collective life other than the life of business. And hitherto\r\nthe Argentine has had no time to produce generations of thinkers,\r\nphilosophers, and historians; still less poets. The most it has are\r\nstatisticians, who give it the precise figures of her commercial balance.\r\n\r\nWe do not doubt, however, that, thanks to material progress, this slow\r\nelaboration of a new race will eventually be completed. In the first\r\nphase of her existence as a nation Argentina, according to the spirit\r\nof her Constitution, fraternally opened her doors to all who wished\r\nto inhabit her soil. No restriction was placed upon the entry nor on\r\nthe permanent immigration of foreigners; on the contrary, legislation\r\nand social customs combined to favour immigration. The result is, that\r\nthe new arrivals have regarded themselves as alien, in matters of\r\neconomics and politics, to the nationality with which they have become\r\nincorporated; believing that their mission consisted solely in creating\r\nand circulating wealth, while regarding the solution of the great\r\nnational problems with indifference.\r\n\r\nBut to-day the Argentine has entered upon a new phase; it must no\r\nlonger merely receive, it must also incorporate all these elements of\r\nimmigration, and, without awakening antagonism towards the foreigner, it\r\nmust set to work to absorb him into the soul of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis faculty of assimilation is a virtue of the American soil. The\r\nUnited States have proved as much for North America, and it now remains\r\nfor the Argentine to do the same for South America. The new generation\r\nof immigrants, having struck root into its hospitable soil, must live\r\ncompletely in the national life, absorbing those feelings of patriotism\r\nwhich animate the new citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo give expression to these loyalist tendencies, we will confine\r\nourselves to quoting the memorable words which were spoken in the\r\nCongress of Wisconsin, by an American congressman, born in Germany, the\r\nHon. Richard Günther; words which were equally applauded and approved\r\nin Latin America. We shall perceive, through the very exaltation of his\r\nphrases, what unreserved devotion a naturalised foreigner may bring to\r\nhis new country:\r\n\r\n“We know as well as any other class of American citizens where our duty\r\nlies. We labour for our country in times of peace, and we shall fight for\r\nher in time of war, if ever such time arrive. When I say our country, I\r\nnaturally mean our country of adoption, the United States of America.\r\nAfter passing through the alembic of naturalisation we are no longer\r\nGermans; we are Americans. Our attachment to America cannot be measured\r\nby the length of our residence here. We are Americans from the moment\r\nwhen we reach the American shore, until the day when we are laid to rest\r\nin an American grave.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\n                    THE ARGENTINE FROM THE ECONOMIC\r\n                               STANDPOINT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                     THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE ARGENTINE\r\n\r\nCLIMATE——SOIL——Geographical situation of the Argentine; its\r\n    boundaries, its area.\r\n\r\nClimate of various districts.

From east to west it occupies a width of 20°,\r\nbetween 54° and 74° of longitude.\r\n\r\nIts territory is bounded to the north by Bolivia and Paraguay; to the\r\neast by Brazil and Uruguay; to the west by Chili. Its boundaries by land\r\nare 2980 miles in extent on the west; 993 miles on the north; the river\r\nboundaries on the east are 745 miles in length. Finally, the shores of\r\nthe estuary of the Rio de la Plata and the Atlantic form a stretch of\r\n1614 miles; all of which represents a total boundary-line of about 6334\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe superficial area of the Republic has not hitherto been calculated\r\non the basis of a geodesical survey; it has been arrived at only by\r\ncalculation from charts which are more or less approximate. According\r\nto the estimates most worthy of credence, and allowing for the latest\r\nrectifications of the frontier, its present area is equivalent to\r\n11,328,321 square miles. This is about six times the area of France,\r\nwhich contains only 203,905 square miles. The Province of Buenos Ayres\r\nalone is more than half as large as France.\r\n\r\nThe seasons in the Argentine, compared to those of the northern\r\nhemisphere, are of course reversed. The summer corresponds to December,\r\nJanuary, and February; the autumn to March, April, and May; the winter to\r\nJune, July and August; and the spring to September, October, and November.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of climate, the Argentine may be divided into three\r\nregions; those of the coast, the centre, and the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe coastal region comprises the Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé,\r\nEntre Rios, and Corrientès. The average annual temperature is about 66·2°\r\nFahr.; at Buenos Ayres it is only 62·6°. The average summer temperature\r\nis about 77°, that of the autumn 64·4°; of the winter, 53·6°, and of the\r\nspring, 62·6°. The hottest month is January, when the average is 77°; the\r\ncoldest is July, with an average of 51·8°.\r\n\r\nIn this coastal region the extremes of temperature are 107·6° in summer\r\nand 41° in the winter; but these temperatures are both exceptional.\r\nHowever, a temperature of 95° is very usual on summer afternoons. It is a\r\nvery unusual thing for the mercury to fall below freezing-point in winter\r\nor to remain there. Snow is also a very rare phenomenon, only to be seen\r\nperhaps once in five years.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of the Argentine climate in general is that the temperature\r\nwill change very rapidly during the day, or even during a few hours; the\r\nchange representing sometimes a difference of more than 36°, especially\r\nin the spring, which is the most usual season for these rapid variations.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the coast region——that is, of a country consisting almost\r\nentirely of plains——is, in general, influenced by the winds, which blow\r\nin gales at all seasons. Northerly and southerly gales are the most\r\ncommon; the first especially are very frequent. In Buenos Ayres one\r\nfinds, during the summer, an alternation of sea and land breezes; the one\r\nduring the day, the other during the night.\r\n\r\nThe northerly winds are always hot and even suffocating; they influence\r\nthe nervous system, afflicting some people with neuralgic troubles.\r\nWhen these winds blow, the air is charged with electricity, until, the\r\ntension of the atmosphere having grown insupportable, a tempest comes to\r\nrestore the equilibrium, to give place to another wind, coming from the\r\nsouth-west, and known as the _pampero_. This wind does not often last\r\nlong, but it attains a velocity equal to that of a full hurricane. The\r\n_pampero_, so called because it is formed in the region of the pampas,\r\nis a wind full of ozone, and as such plays its part in disinfecting the\r\nvitiated air of the urban centres. But the effects of the _pampero_, and\r\nespecially of the south-westerly winds, on the Rio de la Plata, where\r\nthey produce a violent swell, are sometimes terrible.\r\n\r\nAs for the rain, there is no regularity in its fall; which naturally\r\ntends to render the results of culture and of cattle-breeding variable.\r\nRains are more frequent in summer and autumn than at other times; while\r\nthe least rainfall is that of winter. At Buenos Ayres it is rare for a\r\nmonth to pass without rain, which is often torrential, and accompanied by\r\nhail.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the central region, if we except the mountainous portions\r\nof the Provinces of San Luis and Córdoba, is distinguished from the\r\nseaboard region by its greater dryness and its sudden variations of\r\ntemperature. In the plain the summers are very hot, and it is not\r\nuncommon to see the thermometer at 104°; while during the winter there\r\nare very hard frosts. As on the coast, northerly and southerly winds are\r\nthe most frequent. Rain is rarer than on the coast, and falls almost\r\nexclusively in summer and in autumn: with rare exceptions the winter is\r\nperfectly dry.\r\n\r\nIn the Andean region the climate varies according to the height above\r\nsea-level, but is always characterised by sudden variations in the daily\r\ntemperature, and by excessive dryness. On the eastern slope of the\r\nAndes and the plateaux of the north it never rains. These regions are\r\ncontinually swept by furious winds, which make agriculture impossible.\r\nTo the intense heat of the day succeeds the cold of the night, with\r\ndifferences of temperature that sometimes amount to 68° in twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Argentine, with a few exceptions, has the reputation\r\nof being extremely healthy, on account of the sudden changes of\r\ntemperature and the dryness of the air predominant over the greater\r\npart of the country. These atmospheric conditions are, to be sure,\r\nnot favourable to affections of the lungs; but, on the other hand,\r\nthey contribute to prevent epidemics. We find that among adults and\r\nadolescents the figures of mortality are no higher than the average\r\nfigures for the healthiest countries in the world. The statistics drawn\r\nup by the City of Buenos Ayres even show that foreigners have a longer\r\nexpectation of life than the indigenous population.\r\n\r\nIn matters of climate one must be careful not to become confused, as so\r\nmany Europeans do, between our Argentine Republic and the neighbouring\r\ncountry of Brazil, which is nearer the equatorial zone. Favourable\r\nto human health, the Argentine climate is also, as we shall see,\r\nparticularly favourable to most kinds of agriculture and to the breeding\r\nof cattle; from this point of view it is a privileged land, which calls\r\nonly for labour to become productive.\r\n\r\nFor a greater part of its area the Argentine soil unites the geological\r\nand climatic conditions favourable to the production of cereals and for\r\nstock-raising. It is in the fertility of the cultivated lands and the\r\nrichness of the pastures that the whole economic value of the country\r\nresides.\r\n\r\nAccording to recent investigations by competent persons, the surface of\r\nthe Argentine is largely composed of sandy soil; but a sandy loam is\r\noften found, also, more rarely, a gravelly clay; but there is very little\r\nactual clay. Other soils, such as absorbent calcareous earth, are not\r\noften found. In the subsoil a sandy clay abounds, the occurrence of clay\r\nand calcareous earths being greater in the subsoil than in the soil.\r\n\r\nFrom the chemical point of view, the high percentage of potash——which\r\nremains practically undiminished——long ago attracted the attention of the\r\nagronomist. Phosphoric acid is also found, though in less proportions.\r\nLime is often found in small quantities in the best soils in those\r\ndistricts most devoted to agriculture; and nitrogen is often abundant,\r\nexcept in the southern region of the Republic, and in some parts of the\r\nwestern region, where the rains are less frequent, the winds violent,\r\nand the vegetation poor and stunted.\r\n\r\nSaltish soils are of frequent occurrence in the west and south, but in\r\ngeneral the salt is not in sufficient proportions to hinder agriculture,\r\nespecially when suitable means of culture are employed.\r\n\r\nSoils of great fertility are found in the central and southern regions,\r\nand occupy vast areas in the Provinces of Buenos Ayres and Santa Fé, and\r\nin parts of Córdoba and Entre Rios. “There are areas which are apparently\r\nof poor fertility,” says M. Charles Girola, from whom we derive these\r\ndata, “which yield magnificent crops, thanks to irrigation or a better\r\ndistribution of the water supply; especially in the west and the\r\nsouth.”[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Investigación agricola en la República Argentina_, by\r\nCharles Girola, Agronomic Engineer, Head of the Agronomic Bureau in the\r\nMinistry of Agriculture. (1904).]\r\n\r\nBut in the Argentine Republic experience has shown that there is scarcely\r\nany soil which is not capable of profitable use, either for agriculture\r\nor stock-raising. It is very frequently remarked that lands which for\r\na long time had been regarded as poor and almost sterile, unfit for\r\nexploitation, are to-day converted into admirable natural or artificial\r\nprairies, feeding numerous herds of sheep or cattle; or have more often\r\nbeen cleared by the colonist, and are now yielding excellent crops.\r\nThis wonderful transformation is chiefly due to the pasturing of flocks\r\nand herds, which break up and enrich the soil; also to the fertilising\r\norganic matter contained in the turf; and finally to the addition of\r\ninnumerable dead insects, which are brought by the wind and form a\r\ndeposit on the soil, which acts as a kind of natural manure.\r\n\r\nThese favourable conditions of fertility are all united in the region\r\nknown as the _Pampa_, which occupies the greater part of the temperate\r\nzone of the country. It consists of immense and virgin plains, which\r\nstretch to the horizon almost without landmarks or changes of level, and\r\noffer admirable opportunities both for agriculture and stock-raising.\r\n\r\nNearly all those Argentine lands which to-day bring fabulous prices were\r\nreferred to, at an earlier period, as “lands good for nothing.” For this\r\nreason a considerable premium should be put on the theoretical estimate,\r\nmade _a priori_, of the areas suitable for advantageous cultivation, in\r\nproportion as human labour works its transformation.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate, except in the most approximate manner, the\r\ncultivable area of the Argentine. It should be not less than half the\r\ntotal area, or, in round figures, 370 millions of acres. Of this estimate\r\nat least two-thirds represents land suitable for stock-raising, leaving\r\navailable for the production of cereals about 122 millions of acres; of\r\nwhich, at the present time, only a fifth part is under cultivation. We\r\nmay see, by this simple comparison between the future and the present,\r\nthat agriculture has still a great future before it and a large margin of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nTo give a true idea of this power of production, it is enough to recall,\r\nwith M. Emile Daireaux, who has described the great farms of the\r\nArgentine pampa, that the plough, under the most favourable of climates,\r\nmeets no obstacles in the way of hills or forests; not a tree, not a\r\nrock, not even a pebble in the soil. All European crops give there an\r\nabundant harvest, without expenditure upon manure, without shelter for\r\nthe stock; the colonist may even content himself with a modest wattled\r\nhut, protecting him from the mid-day sun or the cold breeze of the night.\r\nThe soil is everywhere friable; no painful struggles retard the speed of\r\nthe plough, which traces at one stretch a furrow miles in length without\r\nturning the ploughshare. The plough is drawn by four horses, reared at\r\nhazard in the open air, knowing no grooming, no complicated training; and\r\nsometimes a single hand is able to manage two teams and ploughs.\r\n\r\nThanks to the frequentation of these lands for centuries by horses\r\nand cattle, these alluvial deposits, rich in natural manures, have an\r\napparently inexhaustible fertility. Awakened by labour from its eternal\r\nsleep, the soil is so vigorous that one finds numerous instances where\r\nthe same grain, sown for twenty successive years in the same place,\r\nyields always the same abundant harvest.\r\n\r\nThe only serious scourge which can menace the creative power of the\r\nearth, independently of the always to be dreaded drought, is the invasion\r\nof locusts.\r\n\r\nThese invasions take the form of flying armies of locusts passing between\r\nearth and sky, and revealing their passage by the semi-darkness they\r\nproduce in the regions over which they travel. Leaving the hot deserts of\r\nthe tropical regions, the locusts advance in their phalanxes, sometimes\r\n50 or 60 miles across; swarm succeeds swarm uninterruptedly for several\r\ndays, leaving behind them no trace of vegetation. They till the wells,\r\nstop the trains, by opposing veritable barriers of their bodies, obstruct\r\nthe rivers in which they drown, and sometimes even, by the accumulation\r\nof their bodies, form a bridge over which the rear-guard can pass.\r\n\r\nSerious though this danger may be, especially in the more exposed\r\nprovinces, such as Santa Fé, we must say, in honour to the Argentine\r\nRepublic, that it has never paralysed initiative; as is proved by the\r\ncontinuous increase in the area of sown soil. Very fortunately, too, this\r\nplague, like that of Egypt’s in Pharaoh’s dream, is intermittent, and an\r\ninterval of seven years often passes before its return. Moreover, various\r\nmeans are being put into practice for defence against this formidable\r\nevil; means for preventing the reproduction of the insect, or of checking\r\nits development before the period of flight.\r\n\r\nA special organisation has been formed under the name of the “Commission\r\nof Agricultural Defence,” in order to coordinate and direct the work of\r\nprotection from the devastations of the locust, and considerable sums are\r\ndevoted to this object every year. Regiments, mobilised along the line\r\nof passage, sweep the agglomerated masses of insects, in dense ridges,\r\ntowards the ditches full of quicklime in which they are buried. Hundreds\r\nof tons of locusts perish thus, but unhappily the plague seems neither\r\ncured nor diminished.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See _Le Correspondent_ of the 10th of February, 1905,\r\ncontaining an article by M. Emile Daireaux.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RIVERS\r\n\r\nThe economic progress of the Argentine Republic is intimately connected\r\nwith the development of its means of communication, its traffic-ways.\r\nThe railways and the ports have been the chief factors of the country’s\r\nprosperity, as by facilitating the outlet of agricultural products, they\r\nhave allowed the soil to attain its whole value.[18] It is therefore\r\npertinent to state, in some detail, how the Argentine is equipped\r\nfrom this point of view, and the part played by such equipment in the\r\ncommercial development of the country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Perhaps it need hardly be explained that the meaning of\r\nthis statement is that the rent of agricultural land reaches its par\r\nvalue when it is absolutely accessible——say, beside a port. With high\r\nocean freights and low railway freights any land upon a railroad would be\r\nalmost equally accessible economically——that is, it would reach almost\r\nits whole value.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nBy the truly providential nature of its soil, the Argentine is not\r\nonly marvellously fertile, but is also a country largely opened up by\r\nwaterways, and offering exceptional facilities from the point of view of\r\ninternational exchange.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable peculiarities of this country is that its rivers,\r\nwhich are, as it were, inland seas, accessible to vessels of the highest\r\ntonnage, and, penetrating the very heart of the most fertile regions,\r\nplace it directly in communication with the exterior. What is still more\r\nnotable is that these rivers flow with an almost constant current over\r\nlevel beds, between perpendicular banks, so that the river-banks form a\r\nseries of natural ports, with wharves of indefinite length. Nature has\r\nwell prepared the way for the handiwork of man.\r\n\r\nThe hydrographic system of the Argentine Republic falls into three main\r\ngroups: (1) the rivers tributary to the basin of the Rio de la Plata;\r\n(2) the rivers which terminate their course in lakes or pools, or lose\r\nthemselves in forming marshes or salt swamps, and are finally absorbed by\r\nthe porous soil of the Pampa; (3) the rivers which empty themselves into\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nTo the first group belong all the rivers which water the Provinces of\r\nCorrientès, Entre Rios, Chaco, Jujuy, and Salta, a portion of those\r\nof Santa Fé, Córdoba, and Buenos Ayres, and the Territories of Chaco\r\nand Misionès. To the second group belong all the water-courses of the\r\nProvinces of Tucuman, Catamarca, Santiago de l’Estero, La Rioja, San\r\nJuan, Mendoza, San Luis, the greater part of those of Córdoba, and part\r\nof those of Buenos Ayres. To the third group belong also a portion of\r\nthe rivers of Buenos Ayres, and all the rivers of Patagonia. As we have\r\nseen, the waterways of the Province of Buenos Ayres come under all three\r\nheadings.\r\n\r\nThe best-known river of the Republic, and that which gives the Argentine\r\nits name, is the Rio de la Plata, formed by the junction of two rivers no\r\nless important, the Parana and the Uruguay. It forms an immense estuary,\r\nwhich pours into the ocean the waters of a whole hydrographic system, a\r\nvast basin occupying nearly 1,540,000 square miles, or a fourth part of\r\nSouth America. This estuary is 25 miles wide at its head, and where its\r\nwaters reach the ocean attains a width of no less than 217 miles, its\r\naverage width being 111 miles; and its superficial area covers 13,475\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nApart from certain hindrances of the nature of islands or sandbanks, the\r\nRio de la Plata offers relatively easy access to vessels of the highest\r\ntonnage making for Buenos Ayres or towards the interior. Its level is\r\ninfluenced by the tides of the ocean, and also suffers very violent\r\nchanges when the easterly or south-easterly winds pile up the waters of\r\nthe sea in the estuary.\r\n\r\nThe river which is the continuation of the Rio de la Plata towards the\r\nnorth, and with it forms the vital artery of the Argentine, is the\r\nParana; its length is 2980 miles, of which about one-half flows through\r\nArgentine territory. Its width varies from 22 to 31 miles, and its\r\naverage annual flow is estimated at nearly 39,000 cubic yards per second,\r\nwhich represents one and a half times that of the Mississippi, twice that\r\nof the Ganges, four times that of the Danube, five times that of the\r\nNile, and nearly a hundred times that of the Seine. It receives, in its\r\nturn, as an affluent, the Paraguay, a river which traverses the country\r\nof the same name, and thus places it in communication with the sea, by\r\nway of the Parana and the Rio de la Plata.\r\n\r\nThis network of rivers forms a magnificent series of waterways. Rising\r\nfrom the central provinces of Brazil, the Parana passes through the\r\nrich afforested regions of Chaco, communicates by means of its affluent\r\nwith Paraguay and South Brazil, and then flows through the Provinces of\r\nCorrientès, Entre Rios, and Santa Fé; that is, through the regions of\r\ngreat forests and wide holdings, and then empties itself into the inland\r\nsea of the Rio de la Plata, where it mingles with the Uruguay, another\r\nmeans of communication between the Provinces of the East and the Atlantic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nConcerning its navigability, here are some data taken from an interesting\r\nlittle book by M. Georges Hersent on the port of Rosario:——\r\n\r\n“During nine months of the year the navigation from the sea to the port\r\nof Rosario presents no difficulties to the great transatlantic steamers;\r\nindeed, it may be said that their maximum draught is limited only by\r\nthe depth of the ‘Canal Nuevo,’ the new channel of Martin Garcia. Ships\r\ndrawing 22 to 23 feet can load at Rosario and leave directly for the open\r\nsea, or come to discharge their cargo at the port.\r\n\r\n“During the period of low water, which lasts for barely three months\r\nin the year——from September to the end of December——there are only two\r\nchannels with a less depth than 21 feet, that of Las Hermanas and that\r\nof Paraguayo. In the former, the island of Las Hermanas separates the\r\nbed of the river into two channels, of which the one most in general use\r\nhitherto has a depth of only 20 feet; but vessels may avoid it to-day, as\r\nthe western channel has been dredged and deepened, and is of more than\r\nsufficient depth.\r\n\r\n“The second channel, which used to present some difficulty, is that\r\nof the Paraguayo, where there was only 17 feet of water. This state\r\nof things was happily not permanent, as the National Government has\r\nundertaken, at this spot, the work of deepening and levelling the Parana,\r\nwhich was completed in the course of the year 1904.\r\n\r\n“We may add that the State is engaged in maintaining, over a minimum\r\nwidth of 108 yards, a depth of 19 feet below the level of low water\r\nin the channel of Martin Garcia, and of 21 feet 1-1/2 inches over the\r\nwhole course of the Parana, as far as Rosario. This maintenance will be\r\nnecessary only at certain points in the river, as the depth of the latter\r\nis in general considerably above those figures.”\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, the real commercial value of the Parana lies\r\nin the peculiarity of its banks, which make it along its whole course a\r\nseries of natural quays. These banks form in many places almost vertical\r\nwalls, and as the bed of the river is almost everywhere 25 feet below\r\nthe surface, it follows that ships of large tonnage can not only ascend\r\nthe river as far as the city of Rosario, or even to Colastiné, but can\r\nmoor themselves alongside the banks as to a quay, without any labour or\r\npreparation being necessary.\r\n\r\nAt some places——as at Rosario for example——the bank properly so-called\r\nis overhung by low cliffs, forming a kind of promontory raised many feet\r\nabove the water-level, so that it is possible to utilise this difference\r\nof level in loading cargoes. By means of inclined planes or gangways,\r\ncalled _canaletas_, the goods collected in warehouses built upon the\r\nbanks are quickly, thanks to the slope of the gangways, run into the\r\nholds of the vessels moored to the banks. It will be admitted that these\r\nconditions are unusually favourable to navigation, and explain the\r\nextraordinary development of a country in which nature has thus surpassed\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nRegarded as traffic-ways, these rivers play a part of the highest\r\nimportance, by giving easy access to the sea, without re-shipment, to\r\nprovinces more than 600 miles inland, such as those, for instance, of\r\nChaco and Corrientès.\r\n\r\nThe Rio de la Plata affords a natural traffic-way, accessible to all\r\nvessels, between Buenos Ayres and Montevideo, which are more than 120\r\nmiles apart. All the large transatlantic steamers which used some time\r\nago to put in at La Plata now come up to Buenos Ayres, which has thus\r\nbecome the headquarters of a dozen wealthy steamer-lines engaged in the\r\nEuropean service.\r\n\r\nThanks to the works established for the deepening of the Parana and the\r\nregularising of its course through the sandy districts, great steamers of\r\n10,000 tons can to-day go up to Rosario: steamers of 6000 tons can easily\r\nreach Parana or Colastiné; and special boats built for the river service\r\ncan ascend as far as Corrientès, and from there towards Brazil, Paraguay,\r\nor Uruguay: a distance of more than 1200 miles.\r\n\r\nBesides these “flowing roads,” we must mention others, which, although\r\nof less importance, are none the less destined to exercise a beneficent\r\ninfluence over the economic life of the premier province, and the\r\ndevelopment of its agriculture, thanks to the cheap transit which they\r\nwill offer in time to come. We refer to the network of canals which the\r\nGovernment of the Province of Buenos Ayres has projected or put in hand.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this book we announced the construction of a\r\ncanal 155 miles in length, which would unite the Mar Chiquita, its\r\npoint of origin, and Baradero, its terminus; embracing in its course\r\nthe following centres of rural produce; Laforcade, Junin, O’Higgins,\r\nChacabuco, Salto, Arrecifes, and Baradero. This enterprise, which was put\r\nin hand at the expense of the Province of Buenos Ayres, failed with a\r\ncrash. After the work had been enthusiastically commenced, after several\r\nmillions of dollars had already been spent, it was discovered that the\r\nwork could never be completed in a successful manner, nor could it ever\r\nyield a return for the sums raised, which were thus swallowed up in this\r\ndisastrous enterprise.\r\n\r\nMen whose technical competence allowed them to speak with authority——for\r\ninstance, the engineer, Luis A. Huergo——basing their statements on\r\nscientific principles, had estimated that the undertaking could never be\r\npractically realised; and, as we have seen, the result justified their\r\npredictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PORTS AND HARBOURS\r\n\r\nThe nature of the river-banks being such as we have described, the ports\r\nutilised by trade along the course of the great Argentine rivers are very\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nAfter La Plata and Buenos Ayres, which share the traffic of the northern\r\npart of the Province of Buenos Ayres, we must mention Campana and\r\nZarate, for at these two ports also the exports of frozen meat are very\r\nconsiderable; San Nicolas, a great centre for cereals, whose harbour is\r\nto be transformed and equipped by the new concessionnaire, the “Société\r\nAnonyme du Port et Entrepôt de San Nicolas”; and Villa Constitución,\r\nwhence the produce of the south of Santa Fé and Córdoba is exported, and\r\nwhose capacity is 7000 to 8000 sacks a day.\r\n\r\nAfter Rosario, which is the second centre of the Republic, the chief\r\nports ascending the Parana are as follows: San Lorenzo, Diamante, Santa\r\nFé, Colastiné, Parana, Esquina, Goya, Bella Vista, and Empedrado.\r\nCorrientès is the last important commercial centre on the banks of the\r\nParana.\r\n\r\nAll these ports had an annual tonnage amounting to 2,188,000 tons in\r\n1906, 2,366,000 in 1907, and 5,396,000 in 1908, so that the statistics\r\nfor these three years of the traffic for the Parana, including Rosario,\r\namounts in round figures to 9,891,000 tons, for the distance of 804 miles.\r\n\r\nAt Santa Fé work has been commenced on the installation o£ a more modern\r\nharbour; the Province, by consent of the State, has devoted a sum of\r\n£6,000,000 to this undertaking. There has also at times been a question\r\nof equipping the port of Colastiné, which is one of the principal centres\r\nof export for cereals and the timber brought by the French railway system\r\nof Santa Fé. The average trade passing through this port amounts to\r\nmore than 500,000 tons, and, so far, there has been no need to add any\r\nimprovements to the natural advantages of the river-banks. We see by this\r\nthat there is no need to create ports on the Parana, only to utilise or\r\ndevelop existing conditions.\r\n\r\nWe give below a table of the trade statistics of the principal ports of\r\nthe Argentine Republic, remembering that with the exception of Buenos\r\nAyres their trade consists largely of the exports of produce:——\r\n\r\n              _Traffic in Registered Tons at the following\r\n                   ports in the years 1907 and 1908._\r\n\r\n                              1907            1908\r\n\r\n  Rio Gallegos[19]           63,500          41,000\r\n  Madryn[19]                118,000          19,900\r\n  Commodore Rivadavia[19]    59,000           1,990\r\n  Ushuaia[19]                25,000          11,800\r\n  Diamante                  131,000         375,000\r\n  Santa Fé                  127,000         440,000\r\n  Parana                    253,000         636,000\r\n  Esquina                   117,000         374,000\r\n  Goya                      163,000         404,000\r\n  Bella Vista               136,000         399,000\r\n  Empedrado                 116,000         306,136\r\n  Corrientès                230,000         504,433\r\n  Rosario                 1,089,000       1,924,000\r\n  Buenos Ayres            6,471,000       7,555,000\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The tonnage of these ports is for the years 1904 and 1906,\r\nno corresponding figures being obtainable for 1907 and 1908.]\r\n\r\nThe premier port of the Argentine, and we might add of South America, is\r\nBuenos Ayres, which in extent and connections rivals the finest ports of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIt consists of two harbours, of which one, situated at the mouth of a\r\nlittle river called Riachelo, is frequented principally by steamers of\r\nlight draught and sailing-ships; the other is known as the Port of the\r\nCapital, or more commonly Port Madero, from the name of the contractor\r\nresponsible for the harbour works. The port contains, altogether, four\r\nbasins and 6-1/3 miles of quays, four of which are situated on the flank\r\nof the city. Along these quays are disposed immense warehouses, able to\r\ncontain 29 millions of tons of merchandise, as well as great flour-mills\r\nand grain-elevators, with a capacity of more than 200,000 tons, which\r\ncost more than £1,000,000 sterling.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The net capacity of the customs warehouses is over 400,000\r\ntons; as products remain there on an average for two months, we have an\r\nannual figure of 6 × 400,000 = 2,400,000 tons. This is the maximum of\r\ngoods per annum which the customs depôts can at present receive.]\r\n\r\nThis harbour has cost in all some £7,000,000, and every year a sum of\r\nnearly 3 millions of paper piastres, or £200,000, is spent upon the work\r\nof maintaining the channel of approach at a proper depth. At the season\r\nwhen the traffic is densest, the port holds as many as 1400 steamers\r\nand sailing-vessels, loading and unloading. It is evident that, with\r\nthe constant increase of commercial activity, further enlargements will\r\nsoon be necessary. The Government is at the present moment considering a\r\ngigantic scheme of improvement, with a view to which several groups of\r\nEuropean contractors have already submitted estimates.\r\n\r\nIn order to give some idea of the importance of the plant at the disposal\r\nof exporters at Buenos Ayres, we need only speak of the great market or\r\n_embarcardero_ for live-stock. It covers an area of 350,000 square yards,\r\nof which 117,000 are occupied by buildings; its capacity is 40,000 sheep\r\nand more than 1500 cattle.\r\n\r\nThere is also another notable establishment, reputed to be the largest in\r\nthe world: the Central Produce Market. The building is of four stories,\r\ncovers an area of 180,000 square yards, and cost £830,000.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the quantities, in metric tons, of products\r\nentering the market between February and September in 1905, 1906, 1907\r\nand 1908.\r\n\r\n                           TONS OF 2205 lbs.\r\n\r\n                    1905     1906     1907     1908\r\n\r\n  Maize               721    6,882    9,600   10,742\r\n  Wheat            34,246   50,379   73,245   47,566\r\n  Flax              1,115    3,636    5,584   10,757\r\n  Barley               83      368    1,361    1,695\r\n  Oats              1,688    3,624    6,685   15,737\r\n  Hides and skins  17,713   18,541   17,115   22,371\r\n  Other products    1,786    1,838    1,804    2,155\r\n\r\nBesides these products, in 1906 there were 87,400 tons of wool entered\r\nat the market; in 1907, 84,600 tons; and during the first nine months of\r\n1908, nearly 43,000 tons. If the year 1908 seems to show a great decrease\r\nin the entry of wools, the fact is really due to the larger amounts\r\nentered in October, November, and December, which are not included in the\r\nfigures for 1908.\r\n\r\nThese figures show the importance of this establishment to Argentine\r\ntrade. It is not a mere depôt, as one might suppose, but a veritable\r\nExchange, where important transactions take place in all the chief\r\nproducts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe port of Buenos Ayres owes its rapid development to this excellent\r\nequipment. In 1880, before the scheme of works was commenced, its trade\r\namounted scarcely to 660,000 tons; since then it has maintained a\r\nconstant increase, and now reaches the figure of more than 13,000,000\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nBelow is the inward and outward trade of the port of Buenos Ayres:——\r\n\r\n  Years.    Tonnage.\r\n\r\n   1897     7,365,000\r\n   1898     8,115,000\r\n   1899     8,742,000\r\n   1900     8,047,000\r\n   1901     8,661,000\r\n   1902     8,903,000\r\n   1903    10,269,000\r\n   1904    10,400,000\r\n   1905    11,589,000\r\n   1906    12,582,000\r\n   1907    13,295,000\r\n   1908    15,111,000\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the value of these figures, we must compare them with\r\nthose relating to the principal ports of the world, where we shall see\r\nthat Buenos Ayres occupies, in matters of tonnage, the twelfth place\r\namong the ports of the world. The tonnage of Hamburg and Liverpool, which\r\noccupy the first two places, is only about 40 per cent, greater than that\r\nof Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the port of Buenos Ayres is chiefly due to the fact\r\nthat it handles nearly all the imports of the Republic——84 per cent, in\r\n1908——while of exports it handles 51 per cent. This confirms what we have\r\nalready said of the absorption, by Buenos Ayres, of a great portion of\r\nthe vital forces of the country, which develops it disproportionately to\r\nthe rest of the country. The equipment of the new ports of Rosario, San\r\nNicolas, and Santa Fé, and the enlargement of the port of Bahia Blanca,\r\nwill constitute a useful task of decentralisation, favourable to the\r\neconomic future of the country.\r\n\r\nLa Plata has the advantage over Buenos Ayres of a deeper basin, which\r\nrenders its harbour accessible at all times to ships of the highest\r\ntonnage. Until 1903 it was the point of call for the large transatlantic\r\nliners outward or inward bound, which observed fixed hours of arrival and\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of La Plata, 3 miles from the town, contains about 2700 yards\r\nof quays and immense warehouses, capable of storing 600,000 sacks of\r\ngrain. It is the terminus of the lines of railway serving the richest\r\ndistricts of the Province of Buenos Ayres, and is destined to undergo\r\nfurther developments, as the provincial Government intends to connect it\r\nwith the agricultural centres by a network of light railways. This is the\r\nprincipal port to-day for the exportation of the agricultural products of\r\nthe central Pampa.\r\n\r\nOn account of the economic importance of this port, the State has\r\ntaken it over from the provincial Government, in consideration of a\r\nprice of £2,360,000, with a view to nationalising it and exploiting\r\nit for the benefit of the Argentine State. This measure will allow of\r\nthe organisation and the improvements which may be necessitated by the\r\nincrease of its traffic. On the other hand, there is constant talk of\r\nconnecting the port with that of Buenos Ayres by a canal some 29 miles\r\nlong, which would form an artificial extension of both harbours.\r\n\r\nRosario holds second place in the Argentine, both in the matter of\r\npopulation and in the extent of its trade. It is the true agricultural\r\ncapital of the Republic, and the principal outlet of eight Provinces,\r\nwhich use the Parana as their waterway. In his little book on the port of\r\nRosario, M. G. Hersent speaks of the advantages of its situation in the\r\nfollowing terms:——\r\n\r\n“Situated in the very centre of an immense tract of country which is\r\nextremely rich and fertile, which to-day furnishes more than half the\r\ncereals exported by the whole Republic, Rosario is the necessary outlet\r\nof the harvests of nearly the whole Province of Santa Fé of the whole\r\nof Córdoba, and of a portion of Entre Rios; three provinces, whose area\r\nis almost equal to that of France. It is the market for the sugars and\r\nalcohols of Tucuman, the timber of Catamarca, and the minerals of Rioja\r\nand Chaco, which are so far exploited only in a rudimentary fashion.\r\n\r\n“In order to fulfil this economic need of vital importance to the\r\ncountry, Rosario enjoys the most complete and efficacious means of\r\naccess and penetration. Five great railroads converge upon it, bringing\r\nto it all the products of the interior, especially grain and cattle.\r\nThis network of lines, whose rapid creation has been one of the most\r\npowerful factors of the development of Rosario, already contains more\r\nthan 2700 miles of permanent way; in 1899 the traffic in the Rosario\r\ndistrict already amounted to 3,400,000 tons of merchandise, consisting\r\nchiefly of the produce of the soil. The extension of this railway system\r\nis proceeded with in a more or less continuous manner, so as to increase\r\nthe value and the opening up of new countries. Very shortly the line to\r\nBolivia will have its terminus in Rosario.\r\n\r\n“But that which gives this port, so well equipped, an incomparable\r\nvalue, is the magnificent Parana, which, on the one hand, places it in\r\ndirect communication with the sea, and on the other unites it with the\r\ninterior by a waterway of several thousand miles in length, constituting\r\na means of transport as easy as it is economical, which brings it all the\r\nwater-borne traffic of the upper Parana and of the Paraguay.”\r\n\r\nThe statistics given above show the important place which this port has\r\ntaken in the last few years, and the continued increase of its traffic,\r\nwhich to-day amounts to some 3,000,000 tons per annum, whereas in 1899 it\r\namounted only to 1,600,000 tons.\r\n\r\nHitherto these results have been obtained with a rudimentary equipment,\r\nand by utilising the fortunate disposition of the river-banks; but the\r\nintense pressure of traffic occurring at this point proves the necessity\r\nof a large harbour, which would allow the products of the interior to\r\nfind their outlet towards the Parana and the sea. The need has given\r\nbirth to the means without waiting for modern improvements.\r\n\r\nTo-day the port of Rosario has entered upon a new phase, which may clear\r\nthe way for a still greater development. Its exploitation has been made\r\nthe object of a concession which, in 1902, was granted to a French\r\ncompany, having at its head Messieurs Hersent & Son and the Creusot\r\nworks, on condition that the latter should undertake the equipment of\r\nthe port on modern lines. The scheme comprises, among other items,\r\nthe construction of over 2 miles of quays and a dock which will, with\r\nthe existing quays, give a total of 2-3/4 miles; the construction\r\nof warehouses, the mechanical equipment of the quays, and also the\r\ninstallation of a grain-elevator of large capacity, which will load a\r\ncargo of 5000 cubic yards in four hours.\r\n\r\nTo-day this scheme is nearly realised, and Rosario will be able to meet\r\nall the requirements of a perpetually increasing trade. The new railway\r\nlines, which will soon reach the port, will complete its organisation.\r\n\r\nAs recompense, the Government has granted the concessionnaires, for\r\nforty years, the monopoly of gathering all harbour dues over a radius\r\nof 7·4 miles around the city of Rosario, and over a distance of 12·4\r\nmiles up-stream and down-stream. The State shares in the takings of the\r\nconcession to the extent of 50 per cent. of the net profits after the\r\nexpenses of exploitation are deducted, which are estimated at 40 per\r\ncent. of the receipts, and after the subtraction of the sums necessary\r\nfor paying the interest on and redeeming the capital engaged.\r\n\r\nFrom all these data concerning the ports of the Parana, it will be\r\nseen that great efforts are now being made to increase the means of\r\ncommunication in proportion to the economic expansion of the country,\r\nand to multiply and facilitate outlets upon the points nearest to the\r\ncentres of production. These efforts are also tending to decentralise the\r\ntraffic, to the profit of a larger number of ports: in order to avoid\r\nthe over-crowding of a few great centres to the detriment of other parts\r\nof the country. This policy will have happy results: firstly, from the\r\npoint of view of the export trade, since it will decrease the net cost of\r\ntransport; and secondly, from the standpoint of the import trade, as the\r\nimports, instead of converging upon Buenos Ayres and thence proceeding by\r\nrail, will reach the neighbourhood of the inland centres of consumption\r\nmore directly and at less expense.\r\n\r\nFor these same reasons serious improvements have been carried out at the\r\nport of Bahia Blanca, which is situated on the sea-coast in the south\r\nof the Province of Buenos Ayres, whose importance has increased more\r\nespecially since the opening of the military harbour to commerce. Bahia\r\nBlanca is one of the termini of many railways of the south; it is thus\r\nconnected with the regions of agriculture and stock-raising on a large\r\nscale, which are able to send their produce directly from this port to\r\nEurope. The wool trade is particularly brisk there, and the cereal trade\r\nalso, since the Pampa has been transformed into a wonderful agricultural\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSeconding this development, already stimulated by the Southern Railway\r\nCompany, which built the harbour known as “Ingenio White,” the Buenos\r\nAyres and Pacific Railway Company has also commenced at Bahia Blanca a\r\nmagnificent harbour, called Galvan Harbour. Built of reinforced cement,\r\nit is equipped with powerful grain-elevators, built of stone, splendid\r\niron warehouses, sheds, etc. This harbour, when completed, will have\r\ncost some £10,000,000; it has already a considerable trade, which will\r\nincrease in proportion to the agricultural development of the great belt\r\nit is intended to serve, which includes the Provinces of San Juan, San\r\nLuis, Mendoza, the Territory of the Central Pampa, and a large part of\r\nthe Province of Buenos Ayres. The importance of this harbour will also\r\nbe increased by the various railways which will unite Bahia Blanca to the\r\nremote districts of the Republic. The French company, now building a line\r\nrunning between Rosario and Bahia Blanca, will also have its own harbour,\r\nthe Puerto Belgrano, and is actively carrying on its construction.\r\n\r\nFinally, the creation of a harbour has been projected at Mar del Plata,\r\nthe fashionable watering-place of the Argentine, and another in the Bay\r\nof Samborombon, two hours from Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the Argentine possesses at the present time, in the matter\r\nof ports, an equipment capable of keeping pace with the growth of its\r\npowers of production. Its rivers are truly arms of the sea, collecting on\r\ntheir banks, thanks to their numerous ports, the products of the central\r\nProvinces, which are thus connected with the Atlantic over a distance\r\nof more than 600 miles. It is the same on the Atlantic sea-board, where\r\nadvantage has been taken of the least natural facilities afforded by the\r\ncoast-line to multiply the outlet to exportation, in proportion as the\r\nprogress of agriculture has travelled south.[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Among the principal ports of the south we may cite Madryn,\r\nRio Gallego, Commodoro Rivadavia, and Ushuaia, in Tierra del Fuego. These\r\nports, by a wise disposition of the Government, seeking to increase\r\nthe population and encourage progress in the southern regions of the\r\nRepublic, have been made free ports; that is all the operations of the\r\ndouane may be effected without the payment of fiscal dues.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that this great organisation can only yield the true measure\r\nof its value in years of good harvests, since upon the latter all\r\ncommercial activity depends; yet it must be recognised that, however\r\nlargely the future has been discounted in equipping these ports, the\r\nestimates of future traffic have scarcely ever hitherto been deceptive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                                RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nRapid development of the railway system——Tabulation of its\r\n    extension in each Province——Table showing the general results\r\n    of its exploitation——List of the lines actually running.\r\n\r\nList of railway companies, with the length of their roadways and\r\n    their returns——The difficulty of obtaining exact figures——The\r\n    tariffs of the railway companies——Form of concessions, and\r\n    suppression of guarantees.\r\n\r\nComparison of the railway system of the Argentine with the railway\r\n    systems of other countries——Proportion of mileage to area and\r\n    population.\r\n\r\nExtension of the system in the near future, owing to the numerous\r\n    concessions granted——The mileage of these concessions——\r\n    Insufficiency of plans and previous examinations——Examination\r\n    of the most important concessions for which the capital is\r\n    already guaranteed——The dimensions which the railway system\r\n    will attain after the concessions are realised——Programme of\r\n    narrow-gauge construction; its value.\r\n\r\nMeeting of the Argentine with the Chilian railways crossing the\r\n    range of the Andes——The aerial mining railway in the Province\r\n    of La Rioja.\r\n\r\nRailways in relation to agricultural development——Insufficiency of\r\n    transport at the moment of harvest; its causes and remedies——\r\n    Necessity of a better organisation which shall respond to the\r\n    stress of production.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same progressive spirit which the Argentine has manifested in\r\nthe improvement of inland or maritime waterways is to be seen in the\r\nestablishment of its network of railways. Here again development has been\r\nrapid, and results plainly effectual in making the wealth of the country\r\navailable. To cite one example only, it is thanks to the railways that\r\nagriculture and stock-raising have been able to attain to such large\r\ndimensions in the Province of Buenos Ayres; a Province far less favoured\r\nthan its northern neighbours in the matter of waterways. All the lines\r\nrunning south have greatly contributed to the transformation of the Pampa\r\nand the increase of the cultivated area over an immense radius where\r\nbefore there was nothing but untilled soil, which was hardly suited even\r\nfor stock-raising.\r\n\r\nThe railway has thus played a great part in civilising the Argentine;\r\nraising new wealth from soil as yet unexploited, joining up the chief\r\nagricultural centres, and affording them an outlet to the rivers\r\nor the sea. The railway has also been auxiliary to the colonising\r\nmovement, stimulating the creation of new settlements along its track by\r\nconcessions of soil.\r\n\r\nThis latter work is not yet terminated, if we are to judge by the great\r\nnumber of concessions now under consideration, in which the initiative\r\nis due to the State or to private individuals. On the other hand, there\r\nis a great tendency to build cheap narrow-gauge railways, in order to\r\nsave expense either in building or in working, so as to obtain a final\r\nreduction of the freight tariff. In short, we find, in the case of\r\nrailways as well as in the case of waterways, that while the continuation\r\nof good harvests is counted on, there is also an effort to keep up, by\r\nmultiplying the means of transport, with the economic expansion of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1854 that the Government of the Province of Buenos Ayres\r\ngranted the first railway concession, for a line 24,000 _vares_[22] in\r\nlength, running west from Buenos Ayres. In 1857 a first section, some 6\r\nmiles long, was opened for traffic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The _vare_ is equivalent to 886 millimetres, so the length\r\nof the line was about 13 miles. At that period, in the region of the\r\nconcession, the _vare_ of land had only a trifling value.]\r\n\r\nAfter these humble beginnings the railway system of the Argentine\r\ndeveloped with great rapidity; on the 1st of November 1908, its total\r\nlength was 13,700 miles, representing an average development of nearly\r\n273 miles per annum. All the Provinces are represented in these figures,\r\nbut of course in very unequal proportions; as the opportunities of\r\nconstruction have not been everywhere the same. Their installation has\r\ngone hand in hand with agricultural development; and the Provinces most\r\nadapted to agriculture have also been favoured with the most plentiful\r\nmeans of transit, as the following table will show.\r\n\r\nAmong these Provinces we must note Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé and Córdoba\r\nas the three which have made most agricultural progress; for they\r\nalone furnish more than 80 per cent. of the total exports. Among the\r\nTerritories La Pampa has the greatest mileage of railways; a mileage\r\nwhich will very shortly be doubled, to judge by the number of new lines\r\nprojected, which in the near future will cross it in every direction,\r\nthus facilitating the outlet of its abundant produce.\r\n\r\nIt is in the last ten years that the network of Argentine railways has\r\nreached its full expansion, as is shown by the second table; which also\r\ngives the amounts of capital invested in these undertakings.\r\n\r\n           _Mileage of Railways on the 1st of November 1908._\r\n\r\n

railways at present in operation is thirty, this figure\r\nincluding the railways and cable tramways or mechanical traction lines in\r\nthe country districts, both public and private, as in either case they\r\nserve for the transport of produce. Of these thirty lines twenty-seven\r\nare worked by private companies and three by the State. The latter are\r\nlines of no great value, which the Government has itself constructed,\r\nor which it has had to take over, either in the general interest or to\r\nredeem their heavy guarantees.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of comfort the great Argentine railways leave nothing to\r\nbe desired, and many Europeans, out of touch with the rapid changes of\r\nthis progressive country, would certainly be much astonished to learn\r\nthat one may cross the Pampa or reach the foot-hills of the Andes in\r\ntrains equipped with sleeping-cars and restaurant-cars of the latest\r\ntype. Perhaps there is rather less ornament and fewer carpets than in the\r\nEuropean sleeping-cars, but the same cleanliness will be found, the same\r\nservice, the same conveniences.\r\n\r\nThe rolling-stock is also the object of incessant improvements. To give\r\nonly one example, the Southern Railways Company has placed in service a\r\nnew type of locomotive, with two pairs of double-expansion cylinders.\r\nThese engines have ten wheels, of which six are coupled and four mounted\r\nin the front on bogies; their maximum power enables them to draw an\r\neffective load of 2160 tons up an incline of 1 in 500. As for the goods\r\nwagons, their capacity is 40 tons in the broad-gauge lines and 25 tons on\r\nthe narrow gauge.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics, on the 1st November 1908, the various railways\r\nhad in service 2992 locomotives, 2031 passenger-cars, and 33,800 goods\r\nwagons or trucks.\r\n\r\nThe companies are enabled to import free of tariff, during the first ten\r\nand sometimes the first twenty years of their tariff, all their fixed and\r\nrolling stock; it is thus to their advantage to obtain from abroad the\r\nmost effective equipment, in order to obtain the greatest possible profit\r\nfrom the governmental favour.\r\n\r\nThe table given below contains various data as to the various\r\nconcessions; it gives the gauge of the lines, their mileage, and the\r\nprofits of the principal companies.\r\n\r\n         _Railways and Steam Tramways of the Argentine Republic\r\n                      on the 1st of January 1909._\r\n\r\n                         RAILWAYS IN OPERATION.\r\n\r\n (Length includes branch lines but not auxiliary lines or loop lines.)\r\n\r\n                           I.

We may cite, as example, one of the Southern lines, such\r\nas that running to Bahia Blanca _via_ Tornquist; a line built almost at\r\na loss by the Southern Railway Company of Buenos Ayres, but which to-day\r\nis yielding over 4 per cent., thanks to the agricultural development\r\nwhich has followed its course. According to figures of reliable origin,\r\nthe traffic of this line between the stations of General La Madrid and\r\nBahia Blanca, has increased from 63,580 tons in 1888 to 458,750 tons in\r\n1908, or an increase of 620 per cent, in twenty years, and even so these\r\nfigures do not include the through-goods traffic between these points.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, we may say that the revenues of the Argentine\r\nrailways more often than otherwise exceed expectation, even in the case\r\nof new lines. On the other hand, it is difficult to reduce the expenses\r\nof working, on account of the special conditions of the traffic, which\r\nis only heavy at the time of harvest, instead of being distributed\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\nWe must warn the reader that the summary just given is of only\r\napproximate value. To avoid wounding the susceptibilities of the State,\r\nor in order not to justify demands on the part of the State for lower\r\ntariffs, certain of the railroad companies publish far lower profits than\r\nthey really make, by means of transforming a portion of their profits\r\nto the reserve or redemption accounts. With the same object, they sink\r\nconsiderable sums in land purchase or in permanent-construction work.\r\n\r\nOther companies, on the contrary, hoping that the State will eventually\r\ntake over certain of their lines, seek to augment their returns\r\ntemporarily, in order to obtain a better sale price.\r\n\r\nWe may safely say, however, the administrative methods of the greater\r\ncompanies being what they are, that on the whole the average revenues are\r\nabove rather than below the figures we have given. Accounts are conducted\r\non a basis of very cautious evaluation, in order to lessen the shock of a\r\nbad harvest.\r\n\r\nAs for the tariffs of the various companies, they are still very high, as\r\nalways happens when there is no competition.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the prices of freight per ton, according to the articles\r\nand the distance they are carried:[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The Argentine “tonne” weighs 35 lbs. less than the English\r\nton being 1000 kilogrammes, or 2205 lbs. in weight.]\r\n\r\n                      Up to 50 kilometres       300 kilometres or       700 kilometres or\r\n                         or 30 miles.               180 miles.              421 miles.\r\n\r\n  Wheat           4s. 9·4d. to  5s. 6·5d.   10s. 11d. to 14s. 9·6d.   14s. 9d. to 17s. 2d.\r\n  Wool in bale    5s.   8d. to 12s.   9d.   26s.  3d. to 39s.  11d.   39s. 2d. to 58s. 1d.\r\n  Wool in sacks  14s.  11d. to 18s. 3·6d.   47s.  6d. to 58s.   9d.   72s. 3d. to 93s. 3d.\r\n\r\nA factor that makes these freights seem even higher is a comparison with\r\nthe maritime freights, which fell in 1908 to a very low figure. The\r\ntransport of a ton of cereals to a port of embarkation 3000 miles distant\r\nwould cost a farmer four or five times as much as the freight from that\r\nport to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn a country like the Argentine, presenting an immense level surface\r\nto the eye, which can hardly distinguish the slightest landmark or\r\ndifference of level, it would seem as though the building of railways\r\nshould have been particularly inexpensive, especially as for ten to\r\ntwenty years all materials could be imported free of duty. As a matter\r\nof fact, however, the cost of construction has been very high in the\r\ncase of certain lines; either on account of the land speculation which\r\nhas followed their establishment, or because the estimates were exceeded\r\nhaving been established without any serious control on the part of the\r\nState. This explains how it is that these companies, having an enormous\r\ncapital to redeem, cannot at the present moment lower their rates.\r\n\r\nIn the Argentine the railway companies are not established as in France,\r\nby right of a concession limited to a certain number of years.[24] The\r\nconcession is granted without conditions, excepting the reserve that it\r\nmay be redeemed by the State; and this reserve may be applied at any\r\ntime whatever, conformably with the expropriation law. The conditions of\r\nredemption are in most cases established on the basis of the revenues of\r\nthe last five years, increased by 20 per cent., so that the clause can\r\nscarcely be carried into effect to the profit of the State in the case of\r\nlines yielding good profits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: A clause fixing the term of the concession——that is, the\r\ndate upon which the line, with all its buildings, etc., will pass into\r\nthe hands of the Government without any payment on the part of the\r\nlatter, was inserted in the case of two railways only, and for a term of\r\nfifty-five years. These two lines are the railway from Villa Mercedes to\r\nLa Toma (the old North-Western Argentine), to-day a section of the Andean\r\nNational, and that from San Cristobal to Tucuman, to-day the Southern\r\nSection of the Central Northern. Both are guaranteed by the nation; but\r\nthe nation having become the proprietor, the above clause has of course\r\nnot taken effect.]\r\n\r\nThe State and the Provinces have guaranteed dividends in various ways.\r\nThese guarantees were granted very liberally when the Argentine was\r\nseeking to create and develop its railway system, but the Governments\r\nhave not shown the same readiness to honour their signatures in times of\r\ncrisis. We shall see in the financial section of this book that the State\r\nhas had to contract loans in order to redeem its obligations, and to\r\nliberate itself from engagements it had been unable to keep.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: The French company of the Santa Fé Railways, which had a\r\nguarantee from the Province, which guarantee was never paid, obtained in\r\nexchange, by arrangement, the complete ownership of its lines.]\r\n\r\nAt present the Government no longer gives guarantees——not even to\r\nencourage the construction of lines in regions which offer little\r\nattraction from the point of view of traffic. It prefers to build them\r\nitself, in order to increase the extent if not the value, of the systems\r\nit already owns; or has recourse to companies or private individuals for\r\nthe construction of new lines, but without guarantees of any sort.\r\n\r\nHaving given these details of the railway system, we have still to\r\nconsider of what expansion it is still capable. In comparison to other\r\nAmerican States——excepting the United States, whose colossal progress\r\nin this department permits no comparison with other countries——the\r\nArgentine is in the first rank in the matter of its railway mileage.\r\nWith its 13,250 miles in operation on 1st January 1909, it surpasses\r\nboth Mexico (with 8390 miles) and Brazil (with 10,080), the two American\r\nStates which, being the wealthiest and having the largest populations,\r\npossess very extensive railway systems. If from the same standpoint we\r\nthen compare the Argentine with France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, England,\r\nGermany, and Austria-Hungary, we find that it occupies the fourth rank.\r\nBut it goes without saying that these figures do not mean anything very\r\nprecise, except in conjunction with those denoting the area and the\r\npopulation of the Argentine. They are indications rather than exact\r\ncomparisons.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the number of miles of railway in operation to that of\r\nthe area in square miles of each country, we shall find that among\r\nthe nations of South America the first place is no longer held by the\r\nArgentine, but by the little Eastern Republic of Uruguay, for in the\r\nformer country the ratio is only 1.25, while in the second it is 1.67,\r\nMexico ties with the Argentine, with 1.25. Here is an example of the\r\nstrange conclusions to which statistical inquiry sometimes leads us,\r\nsince it follows from the preceding figures that Uruguay, with only 1207\r\nmiles of railway, and 71,990 square miles of territory, holds apparently,\r\nfrom this standpoint, a higher rank than the Argentine.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the mileage of the railways of each country to the\r\nnumber of its inhabitants is an exacter method. We find that for every\r\n10,000 inhabitants the Argentine has 23.59 miles of railway, while Brazil\r\nhas only 6.49, Uruguay 10.96, Chili 3.98, Mexico 7.12, and Venezuela 3\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nAll this is explained in the following table, whence interesting\r\ndeductions may be drawn.\r\n\r\nThe mileage of railway given for the Argentine should be regarded as\r\nprovisional, for, unlike those European nations which have almost\r\nattained their uttermost expansion and equipment, there is still much\r\nto be done in the Argentine before the whole of its territory can be\r\nserved. Certainly the principal lines are already constructed, but others\r\nwill assuredly be built, which, apart from their immediate utility, will\r\nultimately pay, owing to the manner in which they will increase the value\r\nof the soil which they will traverse.\r\n\r\nThe constant expansion of its network of railways is for that matter a\r\nnecessity to the Argentine, as for all new countries, in which there\r\nare no roads fit for wheeled traffic. Rather than go to the expense of\r\nopening up such roads, which would be an unproductive investment, the\r\nGovernment prefers to favour the creation of lines of railroad which may\r\nin time become instruments of production.\r\n\r\n              _Mileage of Railways in the Argentine Republic\r\n                   as compared with other Countries._\r\n\r\n  Column Headings:\r\n    A: COUNTRY.\r\n    B: Area in Square Miles.\r\n    C: Total Number of Inhabitants.\r\n    D: Mileage of Railways in Operation.\r\n    E: Mileage of Railways.\r\n    F: Per 100 Square Miles.\r\n    G: Per 10,000 Inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                    |         |          |             |      E\r\n           A        |    B    |     C    |      D      |------------\r\n                    |         |          |             |   F  |  G\r\n  ------------------+---------+----------+-------------+------+-----\r\n  Argentine Republic|1,080,460| 5,792,807|1908   13,740| 1·268|23·73\r\n  Brazil            |3,283,360|16,000,000|1904   10,390|  ·315| 6·49\r\n  Uruguay           |   71,960| 1,103,040|1904    1,207| 1·674|10·97\r\n  Chili             |  294,800| 3,399,928|1903    1,354|  ·464| 3·98\r\n  Peru              |  681,370| 4,539,550|1904    1,184|  ·232| 2·59\r\n  Mexico            |  749,070|13,607,259|1903    9,698| 1·263| 7·12\r\n  Venezuela         |  362,780| 2,619,218|1903      523|  ·143| 1·99\r\n  Bolivia           |  482,240| 2,180,710|1903      701|  ·148| 3·20\r\n  Columbia          |  437,180| 4,501,000|1901      410|  ·093|  ·91\r\n  United States     |3,726,960|91,794,102|1904  213,770| 5·882|23·28\r\n  France            |  206,540|39,961,945|1904   27,365|13·735| 7·12\r\n  Italy             |  104,060|33,640,710|1903   10,016| 9·058| 2·97\r\n  Spain             |  194,250|19,027,855|1904    8,601| 4·219| 4·51\r\n  Belgium           |   11,330| 7,238,622|1905    2,853|25·116| 3·94\r\n  England           |  121,020|44,587,106|1906   23,048|19·009| 5·17\r\n  Germany           |  208,180|60,641,278|1905   34,103|16·349| 5·62\r\n  Austria-Hungary   |  242,820|49,931,906|1905   24,288|10·074| 4·87\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is true, as we stated in the first edition of this book, that numerous\r\ndemands for concessions permitting new lines to be built have been\r\npresented to and granted by the National Congress. But it is also true\r\nthat only a very small number of these projects have been realised, as\r\nmany of these undertakings were unable to find the capital necessary to\r\nflotation in the foreign markets; this has been true particularly of the\r\nEnglish market.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there are among these concessions a few projects which\r\nseem to be capable of immediate realisation; these are concessions\r\ngranted to already existing companies, for the extension of their\r\nsystems, which have the necessary capital at their disposal.\r\n\r\nAmong new lines in active construction we must cite that for which the\r\nconcession was granted to MM. de Bruyn and Otamendi: a narrow-gauge\r\nrailway in the Province of Buenos Ayres. This concession has been taken\r\nover by a French company, and may require a maximum capital of £8,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis undertaking, which is really the extension into the Province of\r\nBuenos Ayres of the network of narrow-gauge lines, exploited by the\r\nFrench company of the Santa Fé Railroads, includes several long lines\r\nstarting from Rosario, crossing the most productive and thickly-peopled\r\nregions of the West, and terminating at the three great centres of\r\nexport: Buenos Ayres, Bahia Blanca, and La Plata.\r\n\r\nThis undertaking, which has been well thought out by its promoter and\r\npresent director, the engineer Girodias, is based upon two ideas; one\r\nbeing to build cross lines connecting the principal railways of the\r\nsouth and the west in agricultural districts where these two lines\r\nhold an absolute monopoly; the other is to extend to Buenos Ayres the\r\nnarrow-gauge system of the north and north-west. This system consists at\r\npresent of 3444 miles of railways, having their terminus at Rosario; it\r\nis therefore most desirable that these lines should be prolonged towards\r\nthe south, and especially as far as the capital, in order to avoid\r\ntroublesome transhipments. This will be a great advantage, for example,\r\nto the sugar-growing districts of Tucuman.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, this new narrow-gauge system is already working\r\nfrom Rosario to Buenos Ayres, the equipment being excellent, and westward\r\nas far as Nuevo de Julio. The first results have confirmed the forecasts\r\nas to the development of traffic in this region.\r\n\r\nAnother concession for a line on the same basis is that obtained by Mr\r\nDuncan Munroe, for the establishment of a narrow-gauge railway between\r\nRosario and Buenos Ayres, to be a prolongation of the “Central Córdoba”,\r\nof which he is the Director. This scheme, thanks to the support given\r\nby the “Central Córdoba and the Córdoba and Rosario,” has been put into\r\nexecution, and is on the eve of being opened to the public.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to unite Rosario and Bahia Blanca——the two chief Argentine\r\nports——by a line crossing the Province of Buenos Ayres in its most\r\nfertile region, is also on the way to completion. The construction of\r\nthis line is being actively pushed, so that it is hoped that the line may\r\nbe open for service in the course of 1910.\r\n\r\nThis important line is being built by French capital, the executive being\r\nknown as the Rosario and Puerto Belgrano Railways Company.\r\n\r\nThe National Congress has also granted to existing companies, which can\r\noffer all requisite guarantees, the authorisation to construct new branch\r\nlines, which will attain a total length of 3370 miles, and will absorb\r\na capital of £25,000,000. Of this total, 797 miles will be built by the\r\nWestern Railways Company, 874 by the Southern Railway Company, 328 by\r\nthe Pacific Company, 192 by the Central Córdoba, 427 by the Rosario and\r\nPuerto Belgrano Railway, 190 by the Province of Buenos Ayres Railways, 87\r\nby the French Company of the Province of Santa Fé Railways, and 476 by\r\nthe Central Argentine Railway.\r\n\r\nApart from the capital of companies already established in the Argentine,\r\none may already detect a new stream of foreign capital destined to build\r\nnew railways. It is announced, indeed, that a new railway system, 223\r\nmiles in length, will shortly be built in Entre Rios by German capital,\r\nwhich has hitherto been shy of this kind of undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Buenos Ayres also proposes to construct and exploit\r\non its own account a narrow-gauge line running from La Plata in the\r\ndirection of the fifth meridian. For this undertaking French capital will\r\nalso be solicited.\r\n\r\nFinally, the National Government, not wishing to remain inactive in the\r\nmidst of these civilising activities, has just obtained the approval of\r\nCongress for a vast scheme of populating the southern territories of the\r\nRepublic; a scheme initiated by an ex-Minister of Agriculture, Dr Ramos\r\nMexia, the basis of which is the construction of over 1200 miles of\r\nrailway, along which new centres of colonisation will gradually be formed.\r\n\r\nThis is the great object of the present Government. It has taken shape\r\nin the form of a law, having as its especial object the development of\r\nthe national Territories, and having regard both to the creation of new\r\nrailways and the progress of colonisation; problems closely connected\r\nwhere the opening up of a new country is concerned, and value is given to\r\nits soil.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted by the Government is first of all to build the railway,\r\nwhich is the great instrument of civilisation; then to profit by the\r\nincreased value which the land will immediately take on along its\r\ncourse, by dividing and selling it with a view to colonisation. The most\r\nimmediate result of this policy is that the soil, which has hitherto been\r\nuncultivated or abandoned, rapidly attains a double or treble value. The\r\nsame thing happens when irrigation works are carried out, as they may be\r\nin certain districts, rendering productive soil that has hitherto been\r\nuncultivable for want of water. We may cite the Rio Negro among those\r\nTerritories in which recent attempts have been made to realise the value\r\nof the soil, and towards which the attention of capitalists as well as\r\ncolonists has lately been directed.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the carrying-out of these schemes, the State usually has\r\nrecourse to contractors who accept payment in Government bonds, with a\r\nmargin of profit sufficient to pay them for their enterprise. We may\r\ntherefore say that the affair is good for every one, and that it is as\r\nmuch to the advantage of the State as to the profit of the capitalists\r\nwho take up these proposals.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we wish to estimate the probable development of the\r\nArgentine railways, basing our figures not on the concessions granted,\r\nwhich already amount to a length of more than 9000 miles, but on the\r\npossibilities of obtaining capital, we may reasonably give 4500 miles\r\nas a probable figure of growth. To this figure we must also add that of\r\nthe lines now under construction, either on behalf of the State or by\r\nexisting companies, which on the 1st of January 1908 amounted to a total\r\nof 4800 miles, of which 973 belonged to the State railways and 3827 to\r\nprivate companies.\r\n\r\nWe may thus legitimately estimate that in the coming years the Argentine\r\nrailway system will be increased by some 6200 miles, making a total of\r\nnearly 19,000 miles. But to keep to solid fact, we must add that such\r\ndevelopment depends on continued agricultural prosperity, the rapid\r\nincrease of ploughed lands, and, above all, on a brisk immigration; for\r\nthese conditions are indispensable to all fresh progress in the Argentine.\r\n\r\nIn this large increase of railroad construction we may perceive at\r\nthe same time the application of a new programme. The State to-day\r\nespecially favours the construction of a second network of economical\r\nrailways, running between the broad-gauge lines or even crossing them\r\ndiagonally——completing them, in fact, and duplicating them. The aim of\r\nthis policy is not only to respond to the development of traffic caused\r\nby abundant harvests, but also to lower freights by the establishment of\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nAs an element of the future railway system of the Argentine, we may also\r\ninclude the lines of communication with Chili, across the Cordillera,\r\nso soon as they are open to through traffic. At the present time the\r\nTrans-Andean railway on the Argentine side of the range has reached the\r\nfrontier of Chili at Las Cuevas, 10,000 feet above sea-level; and on the\r\nfurther side the Chilian Government is hastening the work of construction\r\non its own Territory, so that it only remains to complete the two miles\r\nof tunnel in order to open the whole line to traffic.[26] Once in\r\noperation, the journey between Valparaiso or Santiago and Buenos Ayres\r\nwill occupy less than forty hours, while at present, by the sea route, it\r\ntakes twelve to fifteen days, and involves the difficulties of navigating\r\nthe Strait of Magellan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: This line is now open.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe line is narrow-gauge, and some 8-1/2 miles of it is worked on the\r\nrack and pinion system. The highest point will be about 1480 feet above\r\nsea-level, in a tunnel 1·92 miles in length, of which 1·05 miles will be\r\nin Argentine and ·87 on Chilian territory.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Railway has also a line which at present runs as far as\r\nNeuquen. The Directors of the company have ordered the continuation of\r\nthis line into Chili, going by way of Antuco, thus establishing a direct\r\nroute between the south of Chili and the agricultural districts of the\r\nArgentine.\r\n\r\nDespite the formidable barrier raised by the range of the Andes, the\r\nArgentine and Chili, two nations having the same origin, with a common\r\nfrontier of 3000 miles, are destined, by means of their railways, to an\r\nincreasing closeness of relation. Chili is a country poor in cereals,\r\nand in especial does not raise sufficient cattle for the needs of her\r\npopulation. On the other hand, she produces wines which are highly\r\nappreciated in the Argentine. There may thus spring up between the two\r\ncountries an exchange of products, which the railways will certainly\r\nincrease, and which will give the Argentine railroad system the benefit\r\nof international traffic.\r\n\r\nTo complete this sketch of the Argentine railways, and of the progress\r\nthey have realised, we must not fail to speak of the construction of an\r\nindustrial traffic-way which has established a remarkable record——not\r\nonly in South America, but over the whole world. We refer to the\r\nsuspended railway, constructed in the Province of La Rioja under the last\r\nPresidency of General Roca, in order to carry down to the plains the\r\nproduce of the famous Famatina and Mexicana mines.\r\n\r\nThis suspended way, which is over 21 miles in length, and which cost\r\n£76,000, is, in the words of M. Civit, the Minister of Public Works,\r\nwho inaugurated it, the longest traffic-way of this kind in the two\r\nworlds.[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: As for the probable profits of this line, the Minister\r\nmakes the following statement: “In counting on a minimum traffic of 50\r\ntons a day during nine months in the year——an amount based upon the\r\npresent yield of the mines——and deducting 50 per cent. of the gross\r\nreceipts for working expenses——which is a maximum——we find that to obtain\r\n6 per cent, interest on the capital employed, it would be sufficient to\r\nreceive 3·36 paper piastres, or 7·6 francs (6 shillings ·96 pence) per\r\nton of ore, whereas the mining companies with the present resources pay\r\n20 piastres.”]\r\n\r\n“It glides amid the snows and the tempests, crossing abysses thousands\r\nof feet in depth, and ending at a height of 15,000 feet. The highest of\r\nits towers is as high as the summit of Mont Blanc, and the mines, into\r\nwhose bowels it enters, will take their place, like those of Rio Tinto\r\nand Bilbao, in the commerce of the world, as the agricultural products of\r\nthe Argentine have already done; thus drawing all eyes to this privileged\r\ncountry, which is set apart for the most brilliant destiny.”\r\n\r\nIf we now consider the part played by the railways in the general\r\ndevelopment of the Argentine, we are forced to recognise that in a\r\ncountry so essentially agricultural, the railroad is an indispensable\r\nauxiliary of production.[28] The Argentine Republic is a large country,\r\ncontaining 1,155,000 square miles of territory, and is barely peopled by\r\nits 6,000,000 inhabitants; it will therefore be understood that instead\r\nof following the population, as in Europe, in the Argentine the railway\r\nprecedes the population. In the Argentine the railway is like a magic\r\ntalisman, for wherever it goes it entirely transforms the economic and\r\nproductive conditions of the country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Among matters still under consideration in the Argentine,\r\nwe may mention the concession for the port and railway of Samborombon,\r\nwhich would connect with a system of narrow-gauge railways leaving\r\nSamborombon, which would be a great Atlantic port, and running to the end\r\nof the Territory of Pampa Central, thus facilitating the export of its\r\nproducts.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the matter of transport agriculture will shortly\r\nenjoy improved conditions; there will be greater facilities for bringing\r\nits products to the ports of embarkation, and placing them in the\r\ncentres of consumption. But what are these conditions at present? What\r\nis the precise relation between the railways and agriculture? Are they\r\nsufficient for the rapid transport of the harvests? This inquiry, which\r\nis of immediate interest, has been made by M. Emile Lahitte, Director\r\nof the Division of Statistics in the Ministry of Agriculture, with his\r\nusual competence and practical good sense. We will take certain useful\r\ndata from this source, without prejudice to other data which we have\r\ncollected, while profiting by the experience of other personalities\r\nequally well informed.\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic peculiarities of agricultural production\r\nin the Argentine is the fact that, conversely to the production of the\r\nUnited States, about 80 per cent. of the harvest, and perhaps even\r\nmore, goes to fill foreign markets, leaving only 20 per cent. for home\r\nconsumption; and not only is it necessary to export this surplus, but it\r\nhas to be exported with as little delay as possible. In the United States\r\nthe annual cereal harvest amounts to about 4000 millions of bushels, of\r\nwhich scarcely 10 per cent, or 12 per cent. are destined for export. The\r\nrest remains in the granaries, and is manipulated, during the rest of the\r\nyear, in response to the needs of a population of 80 million inhabitants.\r\nBut in the Argentine, supposing the harvest of wheat, flax, and maize to\r\namount to 400 million bushels, one might count upon the exportation of\r\n320 millions, the 80 millions remaining for home consumption.\r\n\r\nFrom the commercial point of view, agricultural production thus depends\r\nchiefly on the importing markets. This is so far the case that if we\r\nlook into the monthly figures of exportation, remembering that threshing\r\nbegins at the end of December and continues sometimes into March or\r\nApril, we shall find that by June three-quarters of the year’s export\r\nhas already been shipped. The exportation of wheat in 1907 amounted to\r\n100 million bushels, and by the end of June 79 million bushels, or 79\r\nper cent., had already been shipped. The quantity of maize exported\r\nduring the same year was 48 million bushels, and in October, that is,\r\nfive months after the harvest, 40 millions had already been shipped; that\r\nis, 84 per cent. The statistics of the carriage of cereals by railroad\r\nalso clearly prove the pressure and congestion existing in the months\r\nfollowing the harvest.\r\n\r\nFrom this peculiarity it follows that there is always a struggle\r\nlatent between the exporters of agricultural produce and the transport\r\ncompanies. In some cases, as in 1905, this struggle took the form of\r\njudicial protest; the chief export houses sued the “Great Southern of\r\nBuenos Ayres” for damages in respect of unjustifiable delay in the\r\ntransport of cereals.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that the railway companies are not always\r\nthe cause of such delays in export; there are other factors also which\r\nwe must take into account and consider in relation to the national\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nOne of the elements which influence the regularity of transport is the\r\namount of cargo-room available at the ports. When there are many steamers\r\nand sailing-ships in port the shipping rates fall; the exporters hurry\r\nto make contracts with the shipping lines, and in order to be in time\r\nto avoid surcharges, they demand a large number of goods wagons of the\r\nrailways, which the latter naturally cannot always produce. The law\r\nstates that the railway companies must maintain a goods service equal\r\nto the normal demands of the traffic; and the demands created by the\r\naccidental causes we have mentioned are not normal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the shipping contracts are high, or the prices in\r\nthe consumers’ market low, the buyers will be unwilling to despatch their\r\ncereals to the ports of embarkation, and the railway companies can do\r\nnothing to clear their stations of large quantities of accumulated grain,\r\nwhich they cannot forward, since the buyers will not give the order for\r\ntheir despatch.\r\n\r\nDuring a recent harvest both these phenomena were observed; on the\r\nSouthern Railway the harvest was abundant in quantity and good in\r\nquality, but only a small number of steamers were lying in the terminal\r\nport (Engineer White Harbour); every exporter in the district wanted to\r\nship at once, but the railway could carry only what it was capable of\r\ncarrying in a normal period.\r\n\r\nIt was another affair in the districts served by the Central Argentine\r\nand the Buenos Ayres and Rosario Railways. Here the wheat was scanty\r\nand of poor quality, and the buyers had sent very little to their port\r\nof embarkation——Rosario. They preferred to send their purchases to the\r\ngrain-elevators of Buenos Ayres, where, by means of blending the central\r\nwith the southern wheat, a special grade of flour was produced, superior\r\nto that produced in the districts served by the above two companies.\r\n\r\nThe best solution of this question of the responsibility of the railway\r\ncompanies toward the despatchers would be a rule that the railways should\r\nbe obliged to despatch in the course of a day only the amount of produce\r\nsent to the stations during the same lapse of time. But the exporters are\r\ngenerally Argentines, while the railways are usually in foreign hands;\r\nso that this solution, though equitable, would not be regarded with much\r\nfavour, and it is probable that the railway companies will be called upon\r\nto remedy this situation, so unfavourable to Argentine commerce, at their\r\nown cost.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how far the railways have responded to the increase of\r\nagricultural productions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official statistics, in 1895 the Argentine Republic\r\ncontained 8760 miles of railways, and the merchandise transported by the\r\nvarious railway companies during that year amounted to 9,811,100 tons.\r\nIn 1907 the railway systems had increased to a total length of 14,000\r\nmiles, while the produce carried during the preceding year amounted to\r\n28,394,500 tons. These figures represent an increase of rather more than\r\n59 per cent, in railway mileage, while the transports had nearly trebled\r\nin twenty years.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authorities, between 1897 and the end of 1907\r\nthe rolling stock and the capacity of the goods cars increased in the\r\nfollowing proportions:——\r\n\r\n  Year.      Number of Cars.      Capacity in Tons.\r\n  1899           32,897                369,764\r\n  1900           34,118                398,736\r\n  1901           35,503                432,342\r\n  1902           36,288                466,667\r\n  1903           36,334                480,498\r\n  1904           38,724                570,600\r\n  1905           42,623                688,308\r\n  1906           48,840                878,886\r\n  1907           52,405              1,029,122\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we obtain the increase in the number of cars of\r\nproduce and their contents in tons; but it is more to the point to know\r\nhow their rolling-stock is utilised. According to M. Lahitte, the normal\r\ndistance travelled by a goods car is 6210 miles in a year; but to judge\r\nby the statistics its actual record is always in excess of this figure,\r\nsince in 1902 the distance travelled exceeded 8910 miles per car. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that the rolling-stock has been run to its utmost\r\ncapacity; but it is also evident that in practice the cars have not been\r\nloaded to their utmost capacity, as the normal load is 4·37 tons per car,\r\nwhile the average load actually carried has been hardly 1·70 tons.\r\n\r\nIt follows accordingly that, in spite of the distance travelled per car,\r\nthe companies have only profited to the extent of 39 per cent, of the\r\ncapacity of their rolling-stock; but we must not forget that there is\r\nalways a difference between theoretical capacity and effective capacity,\r\nwhich varies according to the nature of the load. This fact is further\r\nexplained when we add, as we must, that out of a hundred cars sixty-nine\r\nmake the journey loaded while thirty-one go or return as “empties.”\r\n\r\nWe see from these data that although the Argentine railways possess more\r\nthan enough rolling-stock for the rapid transport of all agricultural\r\nproducts to their ports of embarkation or destination, yet in practice,\r\non account of the abnormal character of the traffic, the railways only\r\nvery imperfectly perform the services which they ought to perform, while\r\nthe fault can hardly be imputed to them.\r\n\r\nBut this trouble will disappear as soon as the large buyers of cereals,\r\nin place of expecting everything from the railway companies in the\r\nmatter of rapid transport, while they themselves wait to despatch their\r\ncrops until the international prices are favourable, finally decide to\r\nbuild the granaries and warehouses which they now demand of the railway\r\ncompanies. To simplify the task of these companies, elevators should be\r\nerected at the stations which serve the important agricultural zones, so\r\nthat the cereals could be graded before loading them on special cars,\r\nwhich would then transport them to the elevators of the principal ports,\r\nwhence they would glide into the holds of vessels specially prepared\r\nfor the trade. But all this would require materials and plant which the\r\ncountry does not so far possess; yet with the rapid agricultural progress\r\nof the Argentine, the plan should be easy of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the data we have given, the method of despatch is\r\nquite unlike that practised abroad. While in Europe the railway depots\r\nonly receive goods for immediate transit, the Argentine grain-merchant\r\nexpects the depôt to serve him for a warehouse until the moment he\r\nreceives a telegram and requires the railway to transport to the port of\r\nembarkation, without delay, the large quantities of grain accumulated at\r\nthe stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                      IMMIGRATION AND COLONISATION\r\n\r\nImmigration is a vital problem for the Argentine——Table of the\r\n    population per Province and per Territory.

The territory of the Republic has an area of more\r\nthan 1,130,000 square miles, and its population amounts to no more than\r\n5,792,807, which gives a density of 5·1 persons per square mile. One\r\nshould also recollect, in order to grasp the true significance of these\r\nfigures, that of those 5,792,807 inhabitants, 157,963 inhabit the 43,000\r\nacres which form the site of Buenos Ayres; so that only 4,634,841 remain\r\nto people the rest of the country, a fact which still further lessens the\r\ndensity of the population.\r\n\r\nThis density varies in different regions and in different Provinces;\r\nthus the eastern or coastal region, formed by the Federal Capital and\r\nthe Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé, Entre Rios, and Corrientès, has\r\n17·08 inhabitants to the square mile, while that of the centre, which\r\ncomprises Córdoba, San Luis, and Santiago de l’Estero, has only 5·8.\r\nAs we penetrate further inland the density grows still less, until in\r\nthe western or Andean region, formed by the Provinces of Mendoza, San\r\nJuan, La Rioja, and Catamarca, the figure is barely 2·7. In the northern\r\nregion, embracing the Provinces of Tucuman, Salta, and Jujuy, there are\r\n5·23 inhabitants per square mile.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the National Territories——in one of which more than one\r\nimportant European people could find room to spare——that we find the\r\nlowest density. There the desert reigns in all its desolation. The\r\nTerritory of El Pampa, whence so much wealth has been drawn of late\r\nyears, and whose area is 56,200 square miles, contains barely 52,000\r\ninhabitants; that of Rio Negro, whose area is 45,600 square miles,\r\ncontains but 16,000, while in the Territory of Santa Cruz, situated on\r\nthe shores of the Atlantic, in which there are important ranches, and\r\nwhich might contain a numerous pastoral and maritime population, there\r\nare only 1742 souls to its 58,890 square miles. All these figures prove\r\nthat the Argentine is, without metaphor, a desert nation, and that for\r\nthe present and for a long time to come, its peopling will constitute its\r\ngreat national need.\r\n\r\nTo this affirmation we must add another no less certain: that in the\r\nnormal order of human events, and in accordance with the economic and\r\nsociological laws that govern European nations, there is no country in\r\nthe world which assures the labourer who establishes himself upon its\r\nsoil of such perspectives of wealth and welfare. All things compete\r\nto make it a paradise of immigration: the softness and variety of\r\nits climate, the richness of its soil, the extent of its territory,\r\nthe enormous inland waterways which cross it, and the facilities of\r\ncommunication with the European consumers of its produce, with whom the\r\nArgentine is connected by one of the most reliable ocean traffic-ways in\r\nthe world.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: The distance of nearly 7200 miles from Buenos Ayres to\r\nthe French ports is crossed by the great transatlantic liners in from\r\neighteen to twenty-one days. The Argentine Parliament has voted a law\r\nauthorising the Government to give a subsidy of £400 monthly to any\r\ncompany adopting the refrigerator system and undertaking to make the\r\nvoyage to Lisbon or Vigo in fifteen days.]\r\n\r\nThe United States, which have hitherto been the objective and centre\r\nof attraction to which men of initiative have converged from all parts\r\nof the world, are beginning to experience all the troubles familiar to\r\nEuropean nations as the result of an excessive population.[30] It is for\r\nthis reason that they are striving, by all the means in their power, to\r\nrestrain the stream of immigration that pours upon their shores.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The population of the United States is hardly yet\r\nexcessive; the country is very much more than self-supporting, and many\r\nStates and Territories are sparsely settled. The real source of trouble\r\nis that many of the national resources are locked up in the hands of\r\nTrusts or private owners; and the effect of railway combinations and of\r\nproduce trusts all over the country is resulting in a state of affairs\r\nsimilar to that produced by a lack of communications and also an effect\r\nsimilar to that of over-population. It is obvious that both causes make\r\nfor emigration, as the English immigrant in Canada, who finds all the\r\nbest locations occupied by Americans, has cause to know.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nAustralia, which was also only recently one of the great centres of\r\nimmigration, has during these last few years suffered terrible economic\r\nshocks, of which the effect has been to divert the stream of new\r\narrivals.[31] Moreover, as a rival of the Argentine, Australia has two\r\ncauses of inferiority: her rigorous climate, which exposes the country\r\nto violent extremes of temperature, passing from intolerable heat to\r\na bitter cold, and, on the other hand, a distance from the European\r\ncountries to which she exports her products double that between the banks\r\nof the Plata and Europe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Here again the trouble is partly due to the back-blocks\r\nbeing taken up by large settlers, and still insufficient means of\r\ntransit.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nHaving thus made it clear that the Argentine Republic is in an\r\nexceptional position to attract and to support a large European\r\npopulation, the time has come to measure the distance travelled, and\r\nto note the progress realised, so that we may see whether the results\r\nobtained are in proportion to the perfect adaptation of the soil to\r\nimmigration.\r\n\r\nWithout being too pessimistic, we are forced to recognise that all\r\nefforts hitherto made by the Argentine to increase its population have\r\nhitherto remained without appreciable effect.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: It is one of the disadvantages of immigration from a very\r\npoor country where there is no political oppression, that immigrants will\r\nreturn to it, after saving money in a country where money is cheap and\r\nthe standard of living higher, as the work of a few years will establish\r\nthem comfortably in their native country. This is especially true of\r\nItalian emigrants. The evil will doubtless be overcome by a measure\r\ncomparable to the “Homestead Act” of the United States, in conjunction\r\nwith national loans of capital or of farms as going concerns, to be\r\nbought by payment at a low interest, which would result in a population\r\nof peasant owners in comfortable circumstances.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nColonisation, that is, the peopling of the country, was inaugurated in\r\nthe Argentine by the initiator of all true progress——Rivadavia——who\r\nfounded the first colony of Santa Catalina. This work was intelligently\r\nand enthusiastically continued by Mitre and Rawson, in 1863: it was\r\nthen vigorously pushed by Sarmiento during his extremely progressive\r\nadministration; but as a matter of fact, in spite of all these efforts,\r\ncolonisation has not given the results that were expected of it. To\r\nexplain this lack of success, we must suppose that the work has not been\r\npromoted according to the indications of science and experience, and that\r\na variety of events, uncontrollable by the human will, has thwarted the\r\npraiseworthy intentions of the Government. Otherwise it is impossible\r\nto account for the fact that the Republic contains less than 6 million\r\ninhabitants, whereas its soil would support 100 millions.\r\n\r\nTo attain the primordial object of peopling the country, the Argentine\r\nhas had at its disposal, among others, one very important means——the\r\npublic lands——a means which other nations in similar circumstances have\r\nemployed with excellent results, but which in this case has unhappily not\r\nproduced the same happy effect, being manipulated by inexperienced or\r\nthoughtless hands.\r\n\r\nVarious laws have been voted in the Argentine, tending to augment\r\nthe population by means of colonisation. All systems have been tried\r\nsuccessively, and one and all have failed. “This failure,” says M.\r\nEleodore Lobos, in an extremely instructive volume published under the\r\nmodest title, “Notes on the Land Laws” (_Annotations sur la législation\r\ndes terres_), “is an incontestable fact, and must be attributed not\r\nonly to economic, administrative, and political conditions, but also to\r\nthe freedom with which the soil has been divided into lots of enormous\r\narea, and the obstacles opposed to the easy and secure acquisition of\r\nsmall properties. In other terms, our politicians have effected the very\r\nreverse of a rational colonisation, and have established a system of\r\nlarge properties instead of subdividing the land between the colonists\r\naccording to their productive capacities.”\r\n\r\nThis error was recognised by the Government more than fifteen years ago;\r\nbut the influence of speculators, who profit from this short-sighted\r\npolicy, has been more powerful than all attempts at reform.\r\n\r\n“To understand the matter,” says the same author, “we have only to see\r\nwith what indifference to the public weal the executive, during the last\r\ntwenty-five years, has disposed of 67,817,000 acres of uncultivated soil,\r\nwhich formed part of the national domain. The laws voted were impotent to\r\nprevent the disposal of these public lands in large parcels, so that the\r\ndisposal of these lands failed to draw the population which these vast\r\ndomains could support.”\r\n\r\nThe real beginning of Argentine immigration was when the tyranny of Rozas\r\nwas overthrown on the 3rd of February, 1852, and a regular Government\r\nestablished, which voted a fundamental law of which the object was “to\r\ncherish the general welfare, and to secure the advantages of liberty to\r\nevery citizen, to posterity, and to all people of the earth who desire to\r\nlive on Argentine soil.” From this moment a powerful current of European\r\nimmigration set in; turned aside from time to time by financial crises,\r\nplagues,[33] and war; but never completely arrested. Industry, commerce,\r\nand agriculture, which had so far slumbered, received a considerable\r\nstimulus from this new source. In a single year more immigrants entered\r\nby the port of Buenos Ayres than had for many years entered the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: The term used, _fléaux_, would probably include\r\nyellow fever, drought, locusts, cattle disease, bad harvests, etc.,\r\netc.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe public administration did not take the trouble to keep an exact\r\nrecord of the number of immigrants before the year 1853; and between\r\n1854 and 1870 we have simply the number of new arrivals, without any\r\nfurther details. Only since 1870 have the official statistics classed\r\nthe immigrants according to nationality, and only since 1881 have they\r\nrecorded other details, such as sex, age, profession, education, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six months of 1854, 2524 persons entered the country; in\r\n1855, 5912; in 1856, 4672; in 1857, 4951, in 1858, 4658; and in 1859,\r\n4735; or 27,452 in six years: that is, far more than had entered during\r\ntwo centuries of colonial life.\r\n\r\nIn the decade formed by the years 1860-1869, the number of immigrants\r\nincreased to 134,325; in the years 1870-1879, to 264,869; but the highest\r\nfigures, no less than 1,020,907, were reached between 1880 and 1889. But\r\nwe must confess that during this decade certain artificial means were\r\nemployed to recruit the population in Europe; such means as gratuitous\r\npassages, which brought to the Argentine a number of useless people,\r\nunfitted for any productive task whatever.\r\n\r\nDuring the following decade, 1890-1899, which saw the terrible banking\r\nsmash and the loss of public credit, as a result of every kind of excess,\r\nthe immigration diminished slightly——to 928,000 persons——and at certain\r\nmoments emigration also made itself felt, in such proportions that it\r\namounted to a veritable exodus. The departure of those who failed to make\r\nmoney in the Argentine or find the work they sought amounted to 552,172,\r\nthe largest figures that have so far been recorded.\r\n\r\nUnhappily this double stream of immigration and emigration has continued\r\nup to the present. Thus, in 1900-1904, 601,682 immigrants entered the\r\ncountry; but, on the other hand, 384,000 emigrants left it. Such figures\r\nas these denote a grave disorder in the assimilative faculty of a nation.\r\nMatters were no better in the three years 1905-1907, since although\r\n781,796 immigrants entered from Europe and from Montevideo, 324,687\r\nemigrants left during the same period, leaving a total of only 457,108 in\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nIn the previous period, from 1900-1904, the diminution of the current of\r\nimmigration was explained by various causes: in the first place, by bad\r\nharvests, the suspension of important public and private undertakings,\r\nthe fear of war over the frontier question, the dearness of living, the\r\ndifficulties experienced by the immigrant in settling in the national or\r\nprivate colonies: the excessive price of land and the high rents in the\r\nmore promising agricultural districts, the insecurity of life for man and\r\nbeast, the abuses of the authorities, especially in districts remote from\r\nthe centres of population, and the tardy, costly, and faulty nature of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nBut since this period many of these causes have disappeared, thanks\r\nto the splendid harvests of the last few years, and to the period of\r\nrapid economic expansion upon which the Republic has entered. It is\r\ndifficult, under these conditions, to explain the still existing lack of\r\nimmigration, which denotes a disorder of the assimilative faculties of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes likely to prevent immigration there is one which must\r\nnot be too closely insisted upon: the increasing cost of living. But\r\nit is the European mode of life that is dear, while in the country\r\ndistricts existence costs next to nothing, as the colonist himself\r\nproduces practically every alimentary necessity.\r\n\r\nWe must also note that every year numbers of harvesters arrive from\r\nEurope, earn good wages, save money, and return to their native countries\r\ndirectly after the harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, 1906 and 1907 the migratory movement was represented, as we have\r\nseen, by 781,795 immigrants and 324,687 emigrants. If we allow that each\r\nof these latter took away with him a sum of £30, as the Department of\r\nImmigration has calculated, it follows that from this cause alone nearly\r\n£10,000,000 left the country during this period of three years.\r\n\r\nHere are some figures taken from an official publication dealing with the\r\nmigratory movement, which relate both to immigration and emigration, and\r\nshow which European countries have chiefly contributed to the current\r\nof immigration. Italy and Spain, as will be seen, furnish the greatest\r\nnumber of immigrants.\r\n\r\n                     _Immigration and Emigration._\r\n\r\n  Year.    Immigrants.    Emigrants.

Girola.]\r\n\r\nFar from encouraging the promotion of a class of small land-owners, the\r\nState has assisted in the establishment of enormous holdings, which are\r\nthe chief obstacle to the peopling of the country. In place of dividing\r\ninto small allotments, accessible to modest fortunes, the great stretches\r\nof land near the railways or the ports, and offering them for sale at low\r\nprices in the European communities from which a number of immigrants come\r\neach year, as is done by the United States, Australia, and Canada, the\r\nArgentine administration has subjected all the operations of purchase to\r\nlong and wearisome formalities which quickly exhaust both the savings and\r\nthe patience of the purchaser.\r\n\r\nArgentina, then, if she wishes to solve this vital problem of\r\ncolonisation, which is for her the problem of immigration, must give\r\ncareful thought to the adoption of some well-devised scheme, with the\r\nobject of subdividing the present great parcels of land, and of attaching\r\nthe agriculturalist to the land he tills, by allowing him to become\r\nits owner. Without this necessary reform, the country will continue to\r\nexperience the phenomenon of temporary immigration; the immigration of\r\nmen who return to their own countries as soon as they have been able\r\nto save a little money: a process exceedingly prejudicial to the best\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n                    THE ARGENTINE AS AN AGRICULTURAL\r\n                                COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                              AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nNATURAL CONDITIONS——THE CONSTITUTION OF PROPERTY——The three\r\n    principal agricultural districts——The northern, central, and\r\n    southern districts——The division of crops and their varieties.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of rural property——The division of property——The\r\n    great estates, called “estancias,” and their dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks of large properties——The necessity of a better\r\n    subdivision of the public lands——The division into lots of\r\n    large tracts of land, in order to encourage colonisation——The\r\n    system of exploiting property.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION——Progress realised in the last seventeen\r\n    years——Comparative yield of the chief products, wheat, flax,\r\n    and maize——Lucerne; the importance of the crop and the\r\n    excellent results obtained.\r\n\r\nIncrease of the area under seed——The total area cultivated in the\r\n    agricultural years 1908-1909——The great agricultural belts.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Buenos Ayres, its agricultural development and its\r\n    crops——The Province of Santa Fé——The Province of Córdoba——The\r\n    Territory of the Pampa Central.\r\n\r\nAgricultural machinery, its importation from abroad, and especially\r\n    from the United States.\r\n\r\nTHE AGRICULTURAL YIELD——The yield of the soil in the different\r\n    Provinces——Exceptional results in certain districts——Detailed\r\n    calculation of the yield of a wheat farm——Two instances of\r\n    great wealth realised by immigrants into the Argentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Natural Conditions——The Constitution of Property_\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic, which we are now about to consider from the\r\ngeological and hydrographical point of view, offers, by the mere fact\r\nof its physical constitution, an immense future for agriculture on the\r\nlargest possible scale, and at the same time for stock-raising and the\r\nrural industries.\r\n\r\nWe find that the country contains three principal agricultural regions:\r\n(1) the region to the north of the provinces of Santa Fé and Entre Rios;\r\n(2) the central region which runs southward from the limits of the\r\nnorthern, as far as the south of the Province of Buenos Ayres and the\r\nTerritory of La Pampa, including a portion of the Territories of Rio\r\nNegro and Neuquen; (3) the southern region, which runs southward from\r\nthe limits of the central region, down to Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nThe first region is characterised by a hot climate, with regular rains in\r\nthe eastern parts; in the west the rainfall is less frequent. The central\r\nregion enjoys a temperate climate; there, as in the northern region, the\r\nrains are regularly distributed in the eastern parts, but are very rare\r\nin the west, which is subject to long periods of drought. In the southern\r\nregion the rains are less frequent and the climate is more severe, with\r\nthe exception of the west and the extreme south, which are also in a\r\nrainy belt.\r\n\r\nAfter long experience a kind of natural selection has come into\r\noperation with regard to agriculture; the various crops are to-day\r\ndistributed nearly as follows: Cereals, such as wheat, barley, oats,\r\nmaize, and millet,[35] are cultivated more especially in the region\r\nformed by the Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé, Entre Rios, Córdoba,\r\nand the Territory of the Pampa, which latter is _par excellence_ the\r\ncereal-growing district. Maize, however, is grown over a still wider\r\nregion; it is cultivated with success in the whole of the central and\r\nnorthern regions of the Republic. Rice can also be grown in these\r\nregions; its culture is being developed in the Provinces of Tucuman,\r\nSan Juan, Mendoza, Salta, La Rioja, and Jujuy, and also in Corrientès,\r\nFormosa, Chaco and Misionès. The Provinces of Santa Fé, Entre Rios, and\r\nBuenos Ayres are also capable of producing rice.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Millet is an article of diet among the Latins of Southern\r\nEurope. The ordinary “minestra” or soup of the Italian wayside _albergo_\r\nconsists, to English eyes, of a pint of hot water poured over a cup of\r\nbird-seed. Pounded, it makes a kind of cake or bread; when boiled it\r\nswells slightly and is partly digested.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Investigación agricola_, by Carlos D. Girola, 1904.]\r\n\r\nOleaginous plants, such as the castor-oil plant, sesame, and the poppy,\r\nfind favourable conditions of growth in the north, while linseed,[37]\r\ncolza, and rape prosper in the cereal districts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: It should perhaps be stated that the flax or _linen_ plant\r\n(Fr. _lin_) so often mentioned in this book, produces not only the flax\r\nor linen fibre of commerce, but also linseed, with its valuable products,\r\noil-cake and linseed-oil; the first used for fattening cattle, the second\r\nfor paints, varnishes, oilskins, and “inlaid linoleums,” as well as the\r\nbasis or “skrim” of ordinary oilcloth.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane is cultivated in the northern region, but especially in\r\nTucuman, in part of Santiago de l’Estero, Salta, Jujuy, and Corrientès,\r\nand in the north of Santa Fé, Formosa, Chaco and Misionès.\r\n\r\nThe vine is cultivated chiefly in Mendoza and San Juan, where the\r\nconditions of soil and climate are favourable, and where it is\r\nmethodically irrigated by the canals which water the whole of the\r\nvine-growing districts; but the wine and the dessert grape can be grown\r\nin the whole of the central region. It also prospers in La Rioja,\r\nCatamarca, Salta, and Entre Rios.\r\n\r\nStock-raising is followed especially in the Provinces of Buenos Ayres,\r\nSanta Fé, and Entre Rios, and in the south of the Province of Córdoba;\r\nand in a great part of the Pampa Central.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristics of Argentine agriculture having been\r\nconsidered, we must now inquire how rural property is constituted; that\r\nis, among how many proprietors or tenants the 35,000,000 acres under\r\ncultivation at the end of 1908 are shared.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, for example, we know by the census of 1900 that the\r\n840,000,000 acres given over to agriculture are divided into 5,739,657\r\ndistinct holdings, giving an average of about 142 acres per holding.\r\nIn France, according to the statistics for 1892, 11,250,000 acres were\r\ndivided into 5,702,000 holdings, the average extent being about 21 acres.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to obtain similar figures for the Argentine? The national\r\ncensus of 1895 gives us certain data respecting the division of rural\r\nproperty in this country. The 172,000 holdings, agricultural or pastoral,\r\nwhich were included in this census, had an area of 20,295,000 acres,\r\naccording to the declarations of the owners; and comparing this figure\r\nwith the area actually under cultivation, amounting to 12,800,000 acres,\r\nwe find that only about the half of these holdings is tilled and sown,\r\nthe rest being left as pasture.\r\n\r\nThis census also took note of the area of each agricultural holding,\r\nand although the result of this inquiry has not been published, a\r\nsimple division of the number of acres by that of the holdings gives\r\nus an average of 118 to 123 acres per holding; a figure that would be\r\nsatisfactory enough, if it came anywhere near the reality.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Cf. Censo Nacional_, vol. ii. p. xli.]\r\n\r\nThe national inventory gives only these data in respect of this subject.\r\nAs we see, they are far from complete; but even if they were, the\r\nprogress of agriculture during the last few years has been so great that\r\nto-day they would only possess a purely historical interest.\r\n\r\nHappily the agricultural census (including a census of stock), which was\r\ntaken during the first half of May 1908 throughout the whole Republic,\r\ngives us some valuable information on this head.\r\n\r\nThis inquiry affected 222,174 holdings, agricultural or pastoral, which\r\nhad a total area of 450,000 square miles, the area of the Republic being\r\n1,134,700 square miles. This is how these 222,174 holdings are divided:——\r\n\r\nThere are 53,954 holdings measuring from 27·2 to 123·4 acres; 48,323 of\r\nless than 25 acres; 46,553 of from 250 to 740 acres; 29,624 of from 125\r\nto 247 acres; 12,992 of from 743.5 to 1234 acres; 11,104 of from 1236 to\r\n2470 acres; 2968 of from 2970 to 9260 acres; 2052 of from 9260 to 12,350\r\nacres; 1157 of from 12,350 to 24,680 acres. Holdings of more than 24,680\r\nacres are relatively rare, in comparison with the rest; 423 have an area\r\nof from 24,680 to 30,870 acres; 781 of from 30,870 to 61,750 acres; 168\r\nof from 61,750 to 114,250 acres; 65 of from 114,250 to 123,440 acres, and\r\nfinally there are 104 holdings of more than 123,440 acres.\r\n\r\nThese figures, compared with those of the census of 1895, reveal the fact\r\nthat in thirteen years the number of rural holdings has increased by\r\n50,174, and that the area given over to the two forms of usage, which lie\r\nat the base of the wealth of the Republic, has increased by 276,760,000\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this extraordinary development during the last few years,\r\nfrom the point of view of the distribution of the soil, the Argentine\r\nis still in a primitive, indeed, almost in a feudal state, by reason of\r\nthe enormous tracts of lands which are monopolised by a small number\r\nof owners. These owners utilise their enormous properties in raising\r\ncattle on the great ranches known as “estancias,” or employ them for\r\nagricultural purposes, when they do not prefer to leave them in a waste\r\nand unproductive condition, waiting until time and economic progress\r\nshall give them a value which their own efforts are incapable of giving\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThese “estancias”——that is to say, the most usual system of utilising the\r\nsoil——vary in area from 12,000 to 180,000 or 200,000 acres; some are even\r\nover 330,000 acres in extent. Many of them are only a few hours distant\r\nfrom the city of Buenos Ayres, or border on the outskirts of important\r\nurban centres.\r\n\r\nSuch tracts of land given over to stock-raising and owned by private\r\nindividuals would be inconceivable in most European countries, where\r\nprivate holdings are small; nor are they much more usual in a new country\r\nof vast area, like the United States, where more than half the cultivated\r\nlands are divided into farms of less than 100 acres each, and where\r\nholdings of more than 1000 acres, whether under seed or in pasture, are\r\nthe exception, the average of all properties and holdings being 143 acres.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, without a lengthy demonstration, how far\r\nthis state of affairs goes to retard the general development of the\r\ncountry. It is equally easy to understand that in order to stimulate\r\nthis development it is necessary before all else to secure an increased\r\nforeign population, by attracting it through the powerful bait of landed\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe great obstacle in the way of the agricultural development of the\r\nArgentine arises essentially from the faulty property system; from\r\nthe fact that enormous tracts of land are held by a few men; from the\r\nestablishment, in short, of the most odious system of _latifundia_ ever\r\nknown. This trouble arises from the lack of foresight with which the\r\nState has parted with enormous tracts of land, which have passed into the\r\nhands of speculators or large land-owners, who have left them untouched,\r\nwhile waiting for the value of their holdings to rise.\r\n\r\nIn the national territories, according to the deputy Joachim Castellanos,\r\nwho is busily lighting the system of _latifundia_, there are belts\r\nof land, now private property, which are divided in the following\r\nproportions: 2,470,000 acres into holdings of from 25 to 99,000 acres\r\neach; 7,400,000 acres into holdings of from 99,000 to 198,000 acres each;\r\nand 7,934,000 acres into properties of 190,000 or 200,000, and over. This\r\nmeans that there are 17,280,000 acres of useful and cultivable land, in\r\nthe hands of unenterprising capitalists remaining, unproductive, used to\r\nincrease neither the population nor the production of the country.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Speech delivered on 21st September 1903.]\r\n\r\nThe principal author of this deep-rooted evil is incontestably the\r\nArgentine State, which has squandered its rich inheritance, by allowing\r\nit to pass into the hands of speculators, instead of dividing it\r\nequitably among the new colonists. The subdivision of these great tracts\r\nof land, now concentrated in the hands of a few large proprietors,\r\nis, to-day, one of the necessary conditions of the development of the\r\ncountry, and it is with reason that influential voices are raising\r\nthemselves, in Parliament and in the Press, to proclaim this economic\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe great “estancias” of 180 square miles in area, covered by immense\r\nherds of cattle, must finally, says M. F. Segni, author of an\r\n_Investigacion agricola_, be divided into small concerns of from 4000\r\nto 12,000 acres, which would, with fewer animals but a better system,\r\nyield a greater profit both to the owner and to the country. The old\r\nsystem of large ranching must gradually give way to an intensive system,\r\nwhen stock-raising, combined with agriculture, will employ a larger\r\npopulation, attract more capital, and realise better results.\r\n\r\nThere is happily no need to be greatly pessimistic on this point, as\r\nwe can already perceive a tendency to the subdivision of property,\r\nwhich comes from the powers of the State as well as from land-owners or\r\ncommercial companies. Thus the land law of 1907 was passed solely with\r\nthe object of preventing large monopolies; it prohibits the acquisition\r\nfor the benefit of a single person of any portion of the national domains\r\nof greater area than 6170 acres. The importance of this step will be\r\nunderstood, when we remember that the State has still to dispose of 212\r\nmillions of acres of desert land, suitable for agriculture, and situated\r\nin territories which are rapidly becoming peopled.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are certain business concerns which, as owners\r\nof enormous tracts of land, are dividing them into small lots, which\r\nthey are offering freehold to prospective farmers at fairly moderate\r\nprices, and facilities of payment are offered at the same time. Among\r\nthese firms we may mention the “Sociedad Anonima la Curumalan,” owning\r\nsome 600,000 acres of land in the southern portion of the Province of\r\nBuenos Ayres, suitable both for cattle-raising and for agriculture,\r\nwhich is selling land at from £2, 2s. to £3 per acre, according to the\r\nquality and the situation, payable in three or four years; the payment by\r\ninstalments being increased by an interest varying from 7 to 9 percent.\r\nyearly. The “Stroeder Colonisation Society,” which has exploited a large\r\nbelt of agricultural country; the “Compañia de Colonisation del Rio de la\r\nPlata;” the “Estancia y Colonia Trenel,” founded by the great Argentine\r\nland-owner, Antonio Devoto, and a large number of other companies and\r\nsyndicates are working on the basis of enabling the colonist to acquire\r\nhis own land, and are doing successful business.\r\n\r\nA striking example of progress in this matter of the subdivision of\r\nproperty is furnished by the statistics of the Province of Córdoba for\r\nthe years between 1898-1899 and 1905-1906. During this period 3,193,600\r\nacres of land, out of a total of 9,823,300 acres, which represent the\r\ncolonies and settled land of the province, have been sold to farmers;\r\nthat is, nearly a third. Thanks to this subdivision, the number of\r\ncolonists in this province who have become the actual proprietors of\r\nlarger or smaller holdings has risen to 4568. What is happening in\r\nCórdoba is also happening more or less rapidly in the other agricultural\r\nprovinces; and it is by this method that the Argentine will one day\r\nsucceed in abolishing the _latifundia_, whose progressive disappearance\r\nis a condition of further development.\r\n\r\nWe might multiply the instances of land-owners or commercial enterprises\r\nwhich are helping the labourer to buy land, for the system of dividing\r\nthe land into small allotments, selling it at a cheap price, and allowing\r\npayment by instalments, is every day becoming more widespread. The\r\njournals are full of announcements of the sale by auction of lands which,\r\nuntil to-day, have never felt the ploughshare, and are now given over\r\nto colonisation. One also hears men speak, as of an accomplished fact,\r\nof the method initiated by several railway-companies which propose,\r\nby means of their own capital, to bring into the market and increase\r\nthe value of the vast tracts of uncultivated land which they own on the\r\noutskirts of their systems.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, in spite of this tendency to the subdivision of the soil, the\r\nmost usual system of working the land is still that of letting it at a\r\nfixed rent, or for a certain proportion of the yield in place of rent,\r\nor by a profit-sharing system, under which the tenant receives 50, 40,\r\nor 30 per cent, of the harvest. The large land-owners, who are the most\r\nnumerous, prefer the former method, and often impose on the farmer the\r\nobligation of leaving a crop of lucerne on the land in the last year of\r\nthe tenancy.\r\n\r\nThe chief drawback of this system is that the labourer never becomes\r\nthe owner of the soil he cultivates, so that he is not actuated by the\r\npowerful ties of property, which should attach him to the country and its\r\ndestinies. On the other hand, too, the tenant tries to obtain from the\r\nsoil the largest profit he can, without troubling to consider whether\r\nhe is exhausting it or not; he leaves not even a tree behind him as a\r\nmonument of his tenancy. But in spite of all these drawbacks this system\r\ndoes furnish the colonist with means to buy land cheaply later on, and\r\nin another district. Such is the history of many farmers, who began by\r\nhumbly labouring under the conditions above described, and are to-day\r\nrich land-owners, possessing enormous tracts of land, which they work in\r\nthe way that they find most profitable.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the agricultural methods employed\r\nvary according to the situation of the farms, their fertility, and the\r\nmeans of communication. Agriculture, properly so called, establishes\r\nitself and spreads along the waterways or railways which facilitate the\r\ntransport of the harvests. The crops principally grown cannot afford the\r\ncost of transport at a greater distance than 180 or 190 miles by railway\r\nfrom the nearest point of embarkation or consumption, and the nearest\r\nrailway-station must not be further than 18 or 20 miles. There are only\r\na few crops of greater value that can be profitably grown at greater\r\ndistances, their higher prices covering the increased cost of transport.\r\n\r\nThe region consisting of the Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé,\r\nCórdoba, and Entre Rios, which is the richest in cereals, is also that in\r\nwhich the greatest number of small farms are to be found. The statistics\r\nfor 1901-1902 show that out of 37,434 farms 13,150, or about 36 per\r\ncent., were worked by their owners; 18,819, or 50 per cent., by tenants;\r\nand 5465, or 14 per cent., by _métayers_——that is, tenants who give up\r\nfrom half to two-thirds of the crops to the owner of the land. Other more\r\nrecent statistics, relating to the Province of Santa Fé, give the number\r\nof farmers owning their land at the time of the harvest as 6747, or 32\r\nper cent., and the number of tenants as 14,227, or 68 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the farms, especially those cultivated by the owners,\r\nsays the _Investigación agricola_, have an area varying from 60 to 250\r\nacres. Farms held on lease or by payment of part of the harvest are\r\nusually larger, especially in the former case, and the work is done with\r\ngreater expedition, but as a rule less perfectly and without the same\r\nstimulus. Farms varying from 750 to 1500 acres and more which employ\r\nday-labourers are still less numerous, since as a general thing nothing\r\nis gained by employing them. On the other hand, however, there are large\r\nfarms whose owners in reality only supervise matters of administration,\r\nand which are divided among tenant-farmers or _métayers_, paying so much\r\nper cent, of the harvest, or a rent in kind, according to the crops and\r\nthe conditions agreed upon. In such a case the proprietor or colonist is\r\nnot actually an agriculturalist, but a business man, who more often than\r\nnot has not sufficient knowledge to assume the scientific or even the\r\nrational direction of the operations on his estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Agricultural Products_\r\n\r\nHaving considered the physical conditions of the Argentine soil,\r\nthe regions given over to particular forms of agriculture, and the\r\ndisposition of rural property, the moment has now come to consider what\r\nareas are at present respectively producing crops of various kinds from\r\nseed, comparing them not only with the area of each province, but also\r\nwith the statistics of previous years. In making this inquiry, we have a\r\nvaluable starting-point in the _Censo agropecuario_, taken in the month\r\nof October 1888; the first serious undertaking of the kind ever attempted\r\nin the Republic under competent direction.[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Cf. L’agriculture et l’élevage dans la République\r\nArgentine, d’après le recensement de la première quinzaine d’octobre\r\n1888_, by F. Latzina, printed by P. Mouillot, Paris, 1889.]\r\n\r\nIn an introductory chapter the Director of this census says: “It is\r\nonly eleven years since the products of Argentine agriculture have been\r\ngreater than the country’s needs. For example, the quantities of wheat\r\nexported before 1878 were so small as to be negligible. Now we see that\r\nin eleven years we have reached a point at which we export 8,800,000\r\nbushels of wheat (1887), 255,000 bushels of flour (1888), 14,470,000\r\nbushels of maize (1887), and 3,248,000 bushels of linseed (1887). Those\r\nwho will look into these figures will perhaps agree that they represent a\r\ngreat progress for so short a time.”\r\n\r\nThe area of agricultural land in cultivation, according to the census\r\nof 1888, amounted for the whole Republic to 5,984,790 acres, of which\r\n2,014,000 acres, or about 33 per cent. were under wheat; 1,979,830 acres,\r\nor 33 per cent., under maize; 963,320 acres, or 16 per cent., under\r\nlucerne; 299,050 acres, or 5 per cent., under linseed; 71,420 acres, or\r\n1·2 per cent., under barley; 97,660 acres, or .9 per cent., under vines;\r\n52,020 acres, or ·8 per cent., under sugar-cane, and the rest under crops\r\nof no great importance.\r\n\r\nThis point of departure being established, let us pass over the follies\r\nof and the damage caused by the frantic speculations of 1888 and 1889,\r\nas well as the financial failures of 1890, and let us call a halt at the\r\nyear 1895, in which the country, still under the effect of a terrible\r\ncatastrophe only lately undergone, had recovered itself and resumed work\r\nwith a fresh ardour: the only proper remedy to heal its wounds, and to\r\nset it once more on the paths of progress. This inventory of the progress\r\nrealised by the Argentine during seven years of misfortune is all the\r\nmore interesting in that the second national census was taken at this\r\ntime, thus precisely marking the economic, democratic, and political\r\nprogress of the country. We find that in 1895——limiting our inquiry to\r\nthe four principal cultures——the progress realised during these seven\r\nyears was as follows:——\r\n\r\n  Products.          1888                 1895            Increase in Seven Years.\r\n               Acres Cultivated.

During this period, moreover, an important change\r\noccurred; one which encouraged production by placing exchange upon a\r\nsolid basis: we refer to the law of monetary conversion, which gave paper\r\na fixed value and abolished the discount which had hitherto affected all\r\nprivate commercial transactions.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the figures of the years 1895 and 1902, we find that the\r\nprogress was as follows:——\r\n\r\n  Products.          1895                 1902            Increase in Seven Years.\r\n               Acres Cultivated.

Unfortunately, the culture\r\nof linseed has suffered a decrease of 554,036 acres; a result to be\r\nattributed partly to low prices, and to the loss of a certain proportion\r\nof the previous crops.\r\n\r\nAs for maize, we see that in 1904-1905 5,648,988 acres were sown, a\r\nfigure which represents an increase of 27 per cent. over the 4,450,060\r\nacres of 1902. Yet the yield was only 131,155,000 bushels in 1904-1905,\r\nwhereas in 1903-1904 it was 163,300,000 bushels. This sensible decrease\r\nwas felt chiefly in the Province of Buenos Ayres, where the loss was one\r\nof 31,490,000 bushels, out of the total loss of 32,145,000 bushels, while\r\nin the Province of Santa Fé the yield was almost unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe average yield in 1904-1905 for the whole country and the entire area\r\nof land under seed may be estimated as 23 bushels per acre, as against\r\n31.4 bushels in 1903-1904. The harvest of 1904-1905 would thus have left\r\na large deficit, had not the increase of sown lands compensated in part\r\nthe diminished yield of the soil per acre. This fact is a witness to the\r\ntruth of the important fact to which we have elsewhere drawn attention:\r\nthat the Argentine need no longer as before fear a bad total harvest, by\r\nreason of the enormous increase of sown lands.[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Years hence, when the limit of expansion has been reached,\r\nor expansion for any cause has diminished, the inevitable exhaustion of\r\nthe soil may cause some bad years, unless more scientific methods take\r\nthe place of the policy of obtaining large yields at any cost; but the\r\nchange will probably be gradual. TRANS——[.]]\r\n\r\nSince 1905 the agricultural expansion of the Republic has assumed\r\nconsiderable proportions, thanks to the splendid harvests, which have not\r\nonly attracted a greater number of cultivators, but have also enabled\r\nthese already established to take in and cultivate new land.\r\n\r\nExamining only the figures relating to the harvest of 1908-1909, we\r\nfind that the area sown in wheat, linseed, and oats has increased to\r\n20,342,920 acres, which are divided, according to the figures issued\r\nby the Statistical Division of Rural Economy of the Ministry of\r\nAgriculture, in the following proportions:——\r\n\r\n                    Acres under   Acres under   Acres under\r\n  Provinces.

We refer to the fodder known as lucerne,\r\nwhich in 1890 was grown only on 1,480,000 acres, and on 1,729,000 in\r\n1895; while to-day no less than 7,412,000 acres are under lucerne.\r\n\r\nThis crop is a new source of wealth for the Argentine. Its growth\r\nhas arisen from the increased value of lands which were until lately\r\nconsidered unfit for the production of cereals. These lands are now\r\ngreatly in demand, and of late years great fortunes have been made out of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLucerne serves two different purposes; it is exported as dried fodder,\r\nor is used at home to feed and fatten cattle. Hence the lucerne farmer\r\nmay either graze his holding or mow it; so that there are lucerne\r\nfarms and lucerne “estancias,” or ranches, each having its distinct\r\ncharacteristics.[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Lucerne is exported chiefly to Brazil and South Africa.]\r\n\r\nThe farms are mostly near the stations of the chief railway-lines\r\nwhich lead to the ports of embarkation, and consist of holdings of\r\n150 to 250 acres, cultivated by small proprietors, or more generally\r\nby _métayers_——tenants who pay in kind. The mowing, drying, raking,\r\ngathering and stacking of the lucerne are operations which last from\r\nOctober to March; the embalement, or packing into bales, which are\r\npressed and bound with iron, by means of a press worked by horse-power,\r\noccupies the rest of the year. There is also a form of exploitation which\r\nis more elementary and also more rapid: the cutting and immediate sale of\r\nthe crop as green fodder; this method is in use on farms near the cities.\r\n\r\nBut the great lucerne belt, which occupies by far the greatest proportion\r\nof the sown lands, is composed of the “estancias”, which are composed\r\nof fields or farms of lucerne destined for the feeding and fattening of\r\nanimals, chiefly cattle. These exist of all sizes; from the “estanzula”\r\nto the largest ranches. _Latifundia_ sown with lucerne are common in\r\nthe south of Córdoba, and there are instances of immense green savannas\r\nof from 35,000 to 50,000 acres——roughly, from 50 to 80 square miles in\r\nextent——consisting entirely of lucerne farms and belonging to a single\r\nlord and master. There are several settlements or colonies of this kind\r\nin this region; such as the Colonia Maria Soledad, situated at Carnerillo\r\nand at Chucul, including some 42,000 acres of lucerne farms; and the\r\nDuggan prairie, which has 32,000 acres of lucerne. Properties of 15,000\r\nacres are numerous.\r\n\r\nAccording to the last statistics published, the culture of lucerne is\r\ndistributed as follows: Province of Buenos Ayres, 1,235,000 acres;\r\nProvince of Córdoba, 1,235,000; Province of Santa Fé, 740,000; Pampa\r\nCentral, 300,000; Province of San Juan, 200,000; other Provinces,\r\n250,000; giving a total of some 4,000,000 acres. At the moment of writing\r\nthese lines this area should certainly have increased to a total of 7-1/2\r\nmillions of acres.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great progress already achieved——it was not less than\r\n25 per cent., for instance, in the Province of Córdoba in 1903-04——the\r\nculture of this species of forage is still in its infancy in the\r\nArgentine; it is bound to increase notably, on account of the superb\r\nresults to be obtained, both from its use as fodder and on account of the\r\nmanner in which it will transform a certain kind of uncultivated soil\r\nwhich grows nothing but tough grasses of slow growth and low nutritive\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nOne of the first economic effects produced by the growth of lucerne on\r\na particular estate or in a given neighbourhood is that it increases\r\nthe value of the land on which it has been sown. On this point several\r\ncases have been cited which would seem incredible, were they not easily\r\nverified. Fields which three or four years ago were sold for 2 paper\r\npiastres per acre are to-day worth 30, and lands which were sold for 25\r\nto 30 piastres are now sold for 80 and 100 piastres.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Probably the reader need not be told that the roots of\r\nthe lucerne plant accumulate enormous quantities of nitrogen-yielding\r\nbacilli, thus producing organic compounds in the soil, ready for use by\r\nthe next crop sown. The old practice of sowing clover and ploughing the\r\nroots into an exhausted field revives the land in this manner.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nLucerne farms also increase the value of the land in their neighbourhood.\r\nIt is enough to use the phrase, “good land for lucerne,” and the land\r\nreferred to will immediately realise a high commercial value.\r\n\r\nOf the profits to be derived from lucerne when exploited in a rational\r\nand up-to-date manner, we may judge from a single instance reported in\r\nthe Buenos Ayres _Standard_: a league[45] of meadows sown with lucerne in\r\nLa Penca, in the south of the Province of Córdoba, has yielded in a year\r\na profit of £30,000; and in another year it actually produced a profit\r\nof £42,800. This journal also adds that a league of similar land in New\r\nZealand would be worth no less than £360,000.[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: This league is that of 2500 hectares, or 6175 acres; making\r\nthe linear league 3·14 miles.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Cf._ _Anales de la Sociedad rural Argentina_; Art., _El\r\nPais de la Alfalten_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe constant increase of sown lands is certainly the most notable feature\r\nof the agricultural situation. It is the more interesting to note\r\nthat of late years this development has been due to the nation’s own\r\nresources, as after the politico-financial crisis of 1890 the current of\r\nimmigration and colonisation which had assisted agriculture in previous\r\nyears was almost completely checked. As soon as the flow of immigration\r\nis re-established——and it seems to us that it is already recovering,\r\nthanks to the attractive power of the abundant harvests rather than to\r\nany political or administrative measure——we shall certainly see that the\r\nagricultural yield of the Republic will receive a fresh impulse from this\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe 35 millions of acres sown in 1908-9 represent a little over 4·07 per\r\ncent. of the entire surface of the country, as compared to a percentage\r\nof ·008 in 1888. Besides this, we must not forget that according to the\r\nfigures of the agricultural and pastoral census of 1908, 646,620 square\r\nmiles, or rather more than 39 per cent., are employed in the feeding of\r\n67,211,754 sheep, 29,118,625 horned cattle, 7,531,376 horses, 465,037\r\nmules, and 285,088 asses.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we admit the possibility of considerably increasing, by\r\nmeans of the intensive system, the yield of cultivated soil, we see that\r\nit will also be possible, on the same stretch of land, to increase the\r\nnumber of head of cattle; so that it is permissible to conclude that the\r\nArgentine Republic can still conveniently give up a third of her surface\r\nto colonisation, without in the least affecting or damaging the industry\r\nof stock-raising.\r\n\r\nKnowing the extraordinary progress attained by Argentine agriculture\r\nduring the last twenty years, as well as the development of each of\r\nthe particular crops preferred by the Argentine farmer, we must now\r\ninquire in what regions of the country this expansion has made itself\r\nparticularly felt. For this purpose we will divide the Republic into\r\ngeographical belts, confining ourselves here to an examination of these\r\nProvinces in which agricultural progress has been particularly notable,\r\nand limiting ourselves to the three principal forms of culture:\r\n\r\n         _Total Surface cultivated during the Agricultural Year\r\n                              1908-1909._\r\n\r\n        Geographical Belts.

This latter has taken an\r\nimportant place in the national production, and so rapidly, that we may\r\nstill prophesy a notable expansion of its resources. The other productive\r\nbelts have in proportion made less progress, excepting the Province of\r\nMendoza, where vine-growing has been developed, and that of Tucuman,\r\nwhere the culture of the sugar-cane has made great strides.\r\n\r\nThere, for the moment, the progress of agriculture has halted, as the\r\nother districts will only be developed later on, when the populations of\r\nthe former regions overflow, unless some hitherto unexploited source of\r\nwealth——such as the quebracho in Chaco——attracts capital and labour.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the last harvest the Province of Buenos Ayres was in the\r\nfront rank in the matter of wheat, no less than 6,184,180 acres being\r\ndevoted to that cereal. This enormous area represented an increase of\r\n2,933,920 acres since the year 1901-1902, and of 5,254,310 acres since\r\n1895. If we compare this figure with that of 1888, when only 609,560\r\nacres were under wheat, we find an increase of 5,574,570 acres.\r\n\r\nOf the 6,184,130 acres of wheat sown in the Province of Buenos Ayres in\r\n1908-1909, 3,620,300 acres, or 53 per cent., were in the region known as\r\nthe “Centre and South” (the first and second groups united), formed by an\r\nassemblage of fifty-six cantons, of which some, although they were only\r\nlately affected by the movement which has turned untouched and desert\r\nprairies into green fertile fields, are to-day important centres of\r\nproduction, having a considerable influence upon the commercial balance\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThe real development of agriculture in the Province of Buenos Ayres\r\ndates only from 1895. Until then it was considered merely as a country\r\nespecially adapted for stock-raising, and this false conception was so\r\nrooted in many minds that it was believed that agriculture was out of\r\nthe question, except in the Province of Santa Fé. Comparing statistics,\r\nwe find that the latter Province had 992,080 acres of wheat in 1888 and\r\n2,470,000 in 1895, while Buenos Ayres boasted only of 510,090 and 906,490\r\nacres in the same years.\r\n\r\nIt was much the same with linseed; the figures being 180,300 and 657,020\r\nacres in Santa Fé, and 108,650 and 160,550 in Buenos Ayres. Maize formed\r\nan exception; while Santa Fé, in the two years given, had only 150,670\r\nand 429,540 acres under maize, Buenos Ayres had 1,259,700 and 1,652,430\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nOnly in the agricultural year 1901-1902 did Buenos Ayres step in front\r\nof Santa Fé, and attain such crops of wheat as until then were unknown,\r\nleaving all competitors far behind. In the matter of linseed, for which\r\nSanta Fé has always had a special predilection, that Province has always,\r\nsince 1885, maintained its superiority over Buenos Ayres. As for maize,\r\nBuenos Ayres retains its superior position, although it is just to admit\r\nthat in 1901-1902 the other Province made considerable progress.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Buenos Ayres, we must mention that the second place in\r\nthe culture of wheat, is taken by the region known as the West, which,\r\nwith its 1,471,360 acres, or 29 per cent. of the total, forms, like the\r\nanalogous region in North America, one of the great grain districts\r\nof the Argentine. In this region there are cantons, such as those of\r\nNueve de Julio, Lincoln, Pehuajo, General Villegas, Trenque Lauquen,\r\nand others, which, reputed from all time unfit for agriculture, have\r\nsurprised every one by revealing themselves as absolute mines of\r\nwealth. This region has been touched, it is true, by the magic ring of\r\nthe railroad, which has unrolled in these new territories, so full\r\nof unexploited wealth, an immense network of tracks, whose marvellous\r\neffects make us think of the tales of the _Thousand and One Nights_.\r\n\r\nIt is in this region that we have seen, as the logical result of the\r\nagricultural awakening, the most surprising increase in the value of\r\nthe soil. These prices mounted by leaps and bounds; from £1, 15s. to\r\n£3, 10s., from £3, 10s. to £7, from £7 to £8, 16s. per acre, and even\r\nmore; yet one is forced to admit that this increase, though apparently\r\ncapricious, has a real enough foundation, since it is based upon the\r\nremunerative qualities of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Santa Fé, the cradle of the agricultural settlement in\r\nthe Argentine, there are at present 820 colonies and cultivated lands, of\r\nwhich the surface under seed embraces an area of 7,223,980 acres, divided\r\nas follows: Wheat, 3,259,920 acres; linseed, 2,037,990 acres; pea-nuts,\r\n29,390 acres; lucerne, 1,787,280 acres; other crops, 111,400 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Córdoba has furnished another of the Argentine’s\r\nagricultural surprises. Neglected, not so long ago, by the stream of\r\nimmigration which set in for preference towards Santa Fé or Buenos Ayres,\r\nCórdoba began to attract the attention of labourers when the latter\r\n(discouraged by some calamitous years in Santa Fé) were drawn thither by\r\nthe fertility of its soil, the scarcity of swamps, the regular rains,\r\nthe cheap land, and the proximity of centres of consumption and ports of\r\nembarkation, and by the facilities of transport offered by an extensive\r\nnetwork of railways. There the labourers set up their tents, and their\r\nnumbers increased day by day; there they devoted themselves to the\r\nstrenuous task of reclaiming the virgin soil, and there, in return, they\r\nobtained magnificent harvests, a veritable benediction of grateful nature.\r\n\r\nThe results surpassed all expectation; to such a degree, that to-day\r\nthe Province of Córdoba is one of the first colonial centres of the\r\nRepublic, and the Province which offers the most brilliant future to the\r\ncattle-breeder and the agriculturalist. To-day the transformation of the\r\nsoil progresses so rapidly as to astonish both natives and foreigners.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the enormous development of this Province, it is\r\nenough to say that in 1898-1899 it counted 176 colonies and 71 settled\r\nestates. In 1905-1906 these figures were respectively 348 and 190.\r\nThe size of these colonies has increased in the same proportions; in\r\n1898-1899 their area was roughly 3,800,000 acres; it increased to\r\n8,910,000. Of this enormous area, reclaimed and cultivated at the time\r\nof harvest in 1898-1899, some 3,150,000 acres represented wheat, 434,500\r\nlinseed, and 355,000 maize. We must also mention another important crop,\r\nwhich covers a large area of the Province of Córdoba; lucerne, which is\r\nrepresented by some 2,240,000 acres.\r\n\r\nBut the most surprising fact concerning the Province of Córdoba is not\r\nthe vast area under the plough, but the prodigious increase of crops\r\nof every kind. Thus the area sown with wheat, which in 1898-1899 was\r\n1,588,800 acres, was 2,417,920, in 1903-1904 and 2,695,620 in 1904-1905.\r\nIt is the same with linseed; in 1898-1899 184,490 acres were sown; in\r\n1903-1904, 439,830 acres. These figures give some indication of the vast\r\nagricultural future which lies open before this Province.\r\n\r\nAnother agricultural revelation has been afforded by the Territory of\r\nPampa Central, which in 1888 had only 14,900 acres under the plough;\r\nsome 11,000 being in maize, 2100 in lucerne, and 300 in wheat. In 1895\r\nit contained 25,520 acres under culture, and in 1903 308,750 acres were\r\nbearing crops of various kinds; wheat, 71,630 acres, and maize, 419,900;\r\nand in 1908-1909, the Pampa contained 913,900 acres of cultivated soil;\r\n790,040 under wheat, 74,000 under linseed, and 49,400 under oats.\r\n\r\nIn the space of twenty years the Pampa, once regarded as a sterile waste,\r\nalmost impossible of cultivation or of settlement, has seen a great\r\ndevelopment. It contains to-day more than 80,000 inhabitants; twenty\r\ncentres of population: about 914,000 acres under cultivation; 464,645\r\ncattle; 4,809,077 sheep, and 281,537 horses; with an annual export of\r\nproducts estimated at 15 millions of paper piastres, or £1,280,000.\r\n\r\nIts soil has greatly risen in value; the square league of 2500 hectares\r\n(or 6175 acres, or a square nearly 3·14 miles on the side, or just under\r\n10 square miles) sells for anything up to 100,000 paper piastres, or\r\n£8800; and even in the remoter cantons it will sell for £3500 or £4400.\r\nThis extraordinary progress has been accomplished quite recently; it\r\ndates back hardly three years, and the prices tend to increase each day.\r\n\r\nBefore completing this sketch of the agricultural products of the\r\nArgentine, according to the official statistics, we must remind the\r\nreader that the total of these products increases by leaps and bounds,\r\nso that the figures given must be regarded as strictly provisional,\r\non account of the great development to be foreseen as new centres of\r\ncolonisation are formed. The Pampa Central, of which we have just spoken\r\nas a very mine of wealth, is capable of producing in the future enough\r\nmeat and grain to nourish a great part of the population of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the Argentine men employ, for the more important crops, such as\r\nwheat, maize, linseed, lucerne, etc., the latest and most perfect\r\nagricultural implements and machines; cultivators, ploughs, drills,\r\nharvesters, etc., etc. We have not space to mention all; but it is enough\r\nto say that in the regions where farming on a large scale is the rule,\r\na progressive spirit is in the air, which impels the owners of great\r\nestablishments, and even simple settlers, to furnish themselves with the\r\nvery best machinery, for which they sometimes pay considerable sums. That\r\nagriculture has achieved the rapid expansion of which we have just given\r\ndetails, notwithstanding the little help which immigration has lately\r\nrendered, is due principally to the employment of the perfected machinery\r\nin common use.\r\n\r\nThe best types of ploughs, harrows, drills, and reapers of all\r\nkinds——binder-reapers, traction-engines, winnowing and thrashing\r\nmachines, all of the best construction and the most recent model——are\r\nfamiliar to the Argentine farmer, who makes constant use of them.\r\n\r\nThe owners of the great “estancias” make all necessary sacrifices in\r\norder to work their estates in the latest and most perfect manner.\r\nThe machinery comes from the United States, and facilitates all the\r\noperations of _la grande culture_. Two or three years ago, for example,\r\nsaw the advent of a new machine, simple and of moderate price, which\r\nreplaced the reaper and thrasher, by performing both operations at once\r\nas it moved. It reaps the ears of corn, winnows them, grades the grain,\r\nand pours it into sacks; leaving the straw, it is true, but the value of\r\nstraw in the Argentine is negligible. All these operations are performed\r\nas the machine progresses; four horses are enough to draw it. With this\r\nnew machine corn that is standing in the morning is reaped during the\r\nday, and by the evening is ready for despatch to the port of embarkation.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the extent to which agricultural machinery is used\r\nin the Argentine, we may mention that in the period 1890-1904 there were\r\nimported from abroad, mostly from the United States, 459,006 ploughs,\r\nofficially valued for customs purposes at £1,331,409; 22,783 winnowers,\r\nvalued at £277,976; 98,470 reapers, valued at £2,041,982; 37,824 drills,\r\nor sowers, valued at £176,268; and 4770 thrashing-machines, valued at\r\n£1,250,184. From 1898 to 1904 13,725 maize huskers were imported, valued\r\nat £340,479.\r\n\r\nTo complete these data we append a table, giving the number of\r\nagricultural machines imported in the course of the years 1905, 1906,\r\n1907 and 1908:\r\n\r\n                              1905        1906       1907          1908\r\n  Ploughs                     66,404      84,948     59,196       29,775\r\n  Winnowers or huskers           790         785        134           98\r\n  Reapers                     14,492      20,739     17,334       18,722\r\n  Drills or sowers             7,911      25,447     13,975        9,528\r\n  Harvesters                     706       2,011        226        1,866\r\n  Thrashers                      909       1,136        490          969\r\n\r\nWe must also mention that there has been a great development of factories\r\nin the Argentine, which turn out agricultural machinery and implements;\r\nsome of these have been established with large amounts of capital,\r\nand possess an equipment fully equal to that of the best equipped\r\nestablishments of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Agricultural Yield_\r\n\r\nHaving now considered the agricultural progress achieved in the\r\nArgentine, the areas under seed at different periods, the prevailing\r\ncrops, and the regions in which agriculture is more especially\r\nestablished, we must now study the results of agriculture; that is to\r\nsay, its yield, and shall attempt to forecast the future reserved for the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated, there are no complete statistics available,\r\nsuch as there are in the United States and in other countries, which\r\ngive in detail the cost of working farms of various sizes, and the\r\nprices at which the latter sell their produce; and it is only from such\r\ndetails that we can calculate the net profit of each acre. But, despite\r\nthis lack, we can probably find the data we require by resorting to the\r\nopinion of those competent in such matters, either because they are\r\nthemselves practising farmers, or because they have set themselves the\r\nsame problem as that we are facing.\r\n\r\nIn the good lands of the Provinces of Córdoba and Buenos Ayres, and in\r\nthe Pampa Centrale, the hectare may yield the settler 50 piastres (in\r\nnotes), or £4, 8s.; in other words, £1, 15s. 7-1/2d. per acre; provided\r\nthere is no hail, and if he escapes the other agricultural plagues.\r\nSome estates this year have produced as much as 2000 kilos of wheat per\r\nhectare, or 29 bushels per acre; yielding, at $6 per ton (the Argentine\r\nton of 2205 lb.) a yield of 120 piastres[47] (paper) per hectare, or £4,\r\n5s. 6-1/4d. per acre. Estimating the expenses at 25 to 33 per cent.,\r\nthere remains a profit, let us say, of £3, from which we must still\r\ndeduct some 10s. for rent, so that the labourer draws a final profit of\r\n70 piastre notes per hectare, or £2, 10s.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The piastre note is approximately worth 2·2 francs, or 19·2\r\npence——1s, 7-1/5d.]\r\n\r\nIn one particular establishment, not far from the station of Labenlaye,\r\non the Buenos Ayres Pacific line, the yield of a family of _métayers_,\r\nwho cultivate 125 to 150 acres, and pay a quarter of the crop to the\r\nproprietor, and also work on the cattle-ranch on days when there is\r\nno work in the fields, make an annual profit of £88 a year. This is\r\nequivalent of a profit of from 10s. 4d. to 14s. 4d. per acre, earned by\r\ncultivating the soil as _métayers_ or tenants in kind, retaining 75 per\r\ncent. of the crop; but it must be remembered that this is absolutely\r\na net profit: all the labourers’ expenses, the cost of nourishment,\r\nclothing, and other current expenses, are all debited first; so that the\r\n£88 may be saved or spent or invested.\r\n\r\nBut an argument more eloquent than all the arithmetical demonstrations\r\nwhich we might draw from particular cases is the well-known fact that\r\nevery year a large number of labourers become the proprietors of the\r\nholdings they cultivate, or acquire other holdings in the neighbourhood.\r\nIt is by no means an exceptional thing for those who cultivate a tract\r\nof land to draw from it in a single year a sufficient sum of money to\r\nacquire it for themselves, while reserving the expenses of sowing and\r\nother work to be done before the next harvest.\r\n\r\nTo support this statement, here are a few exacter details as to the\r\ncapital required to reclaim a holding and its approximate yield.\r\n\r\nAccording to calculations furnished by a man of great experience in\r\nmatters of colonisation, the capital required by a family of four or\r\nfive persons cultivating 250 acres of wheat, including the expense of\r\ninstallation in the first year, may be estimated as follows:——\r\n\r\n                                          £  S.  D.\r\n  Two Ploughs, sulky type                21   2  0\r\n  Two Harrows, threefold                  7  18  0\r\n  One Roller                              4   8  0\r\n  One Husker or winnowing machine        39  12  0\r\n  Twenty Oxen                            88   0  0\r\n  Two Horses                              8  16  0\r\n  Two Carts                              35   4  0\r\n  Harness, chains, implements, etc.       8  16  0\r\n  House, corral, well, fencing          105  12  0\r\n                                       -----------\r\n                                       £319   8  0\r\n                                       -----------\r\n\r\nThe family or the colonist who does not possess such capital will find\r\nrich proprietors or colonists who will furnish him with implements,\r\ndraught animals, and seed corn, as well as the necessaries of life. The\r\nharvest over, the seed corn is reserved for the next sowing; the expenses\r\nof the harvest are deducted, and the net profit is halved, one half going\r\nto the proprietor, and one to the colonist. It is thus that the majority\r\nof immigrants begin to earn the capital which enables them to become\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\nFor bachelor immigrants there is another method, which gives excellent\r\nresults: they place themselves with colonists who possess some capital\r\nas “interested servants,” or profit-sharing labourers, lending their\r\nservices from the ploughing to the harvest of wheat and linseed. They\r\nreceive for their services food, board, and 6 or 7 per cent. of the\r\ngross profit of 100 hectares. They put the sums received during three or\r\nfour years out at interest, and have then sufficient money to buy the\r\nnecessary implements and to become tenant farmers. Three or four years\r\nlater they buy land on the instalment system, and finally become large\r\nland-owners; one may count by the hundred those who have followed this\r\ncourse, have become the proprietors of wide tracts of land, and have\r\nto-day made large fortunes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he is a land-owner the colonist or farmer has already an\r\nalmost certain future before him, as the net profits he obtains each year\r\naccumulate in geometrical progression, unless some fatality pursues him:\r\na thing that is of sufficiently rare occurrence.

This is\r\nunusual.]\r\n\r\nIn short, a profit of about one pound per acre.\r\n\r\nThe above figures relate to the property known as “La Vizcaina,” in the\r\nDepartment of Bolivar; it consists of 123,800 acres of agricultural land,\r\nor 183 square miles, and is the largest agricultural farm in the Republic\r\nbelonging to a single owner or held by a single tenant. It must be\r\nmentioned that, on the whole, the land is high; it has never been invaded\r\nby locusts; the depth of the mould or upper soil is considerable, and the\r\nproperty has two railway stations built upon it and a third about 2-1/2\r\nmiles distant, which facilitate the despatch of the harvests.\r\n\r\nThe above figures do not give a precise idea of the farmer’s situation,\r\nsince agricultural land is let for four years, and in four years, six\r\nharvests may be obtained (three of wheat and three of maize), which\r\nsensibly diminishes the cost of working and increases the profits in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nWe may use the same table as relating to linseed, substituting £7, 18s.\r\n6d. per ton, or thereabouts, for the sowing, and £1, 1s. per ton for\r\nthrashing. In this district linseed-farming is accompanied by certain\r\nrisks, on account of the scanty rain and the late frosts; sometimes the\r\nharvest is 7, 8, or 10 quintals (metric) per hectare; but it is usually\r\nonly 3 or 4.[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: In normal years, if the fields have been well worked, one\r\nmay count on an average of 36 bushels of wheat per 2-1/2 acres, or 14\r\nper acre; 36 bushels of maize per acre, and 12·5 bushels of linseed per\r\nacre. On virgin land the results are often of great interest; for it is\r\nnot uncommon to obtain over 20 bushels of wheat per acre, (1 bushel = 60\r\nlbs.).]\r\n\r\nIn order that these figures representing the farmer’s profit shall give\r\na true idea of the reality, it must be remembered that besides the wheat\r\ncrop he can also obtain another and equally profitable crop of maize in\r\nthe same year, and he may also increase his profits by fattening pigs\r\nand raising game and other products which command a ready sale in the\r\nneighbouring towns.\r\n\r\nThese examples must not of course be taken as representing a general\r\nlaw; the net income of course depends upon the cost of production and\r\nthe yield of each harvest, and these two factors may vary infinitely,\r\nwhere the crops under consideration are as large as those raised in the\r\nArgentine. But what we may affirm is that, besides a certain number of\r\nfarms lying fallow, there are hundreds of thousands of acres of virgin\r\nsoil, purchasable at a low price, on which it is enough to cast the seed,\r\nafter a superficial cultivation, in order to obtain a splendid harvest.\r\nIn conditions as favourable as these, and using machinery which enables\r\nthe farmer to cultivate enormous surfaces with little labour, there are\r\nalways serious probabilities of success for the agriculturalist. This it\r\nis that explains the great increase of cultivated lands during the last\r\nfew years, whether virgin lands divided and sold by the owner, or lands\r\nleased to tenants who pay in kind or give up a percentage of the crops.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a country whose soil gives such wonderfully abundant yields, great\r\nfortunes, and fortunes rapidly made, are common. The Argentine, like the\r\nUnited States, has her legendary type of immigrant, who has progressed in\r\na very short time from extreme poverty to great riches, by applying his\r\nenergy and initiative to agriculture or stock-raising.\r\n\r\nHere are two of the most notable and best-known, examples.\r\n\r\nA few years ago there died in the Argentine one of the greatest landed\r\nproprietors; a man named Santamarina, whose life-history is worth\r\nrelating.\r\n\r\nSon of a small farmer of Galicia, Santamarina decided, when about twenty\r\nyears of age, to seek his fortune in America. His means not permitting\r\nhim to meet the expenses of the voyage, he resorted to the classical\r\nprocedure; he shipped as a stowaway on a vessel about to leave Vigo on a\r\nvoyage, to Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nDiscovered on the voyage, the captain had compassion on him, kept him\r\non the vessel and landed him, fifty years ago, in the capital of the\r\nArgentine; without any resources, and sustained only by the hope of\r\ngaining a livelihood more easily than in Spain.\r\n\r\nSantamarina immediately made his way towards the great plaza, where the\r\nproduce of the country was at that time sold; and there, hoping to secure\r\na job, he spoke to a man who was conducting a wagon, and whose business\r\nit was to bring wool from the country into the Buenos Ayres market.\r\n\r\nThis man, seeing him strong and willing, offered to share with him\r\nhis work as wagoner; but he first inquired of Santamarina whether he\r\npossessed a knife, as at that time in the Argentine it was the necessary\r\ninstrument of defence, and at need, of attack, and was also employed in\r\nall the usages of the nomad life.\r\n\r\nSantamarina had no knife; but he had a piastre, which the captain had\r\ngiven him before he left the ship, and with this piastre he bought a\r\nknife, which served in this partnership as his only capital.\r\n\r\nHaving led the common wagon for some time, Santamarina had saved enough\r\nto buy a better one for his own; then, chance aiding him, he purchased a\r\nfew sheep whose wool he sold; and finally, by dint of work, he succeeded\r\nin saving sufficient capital to buy a little land and start sheep-raising\r\non his own account. This was the beginning of his success; little by\r\nlittle Santamarina bought more sheep and more land, and became in the end\r\none of the greater landed proprietors of the Argentine. He died in 1904,\r\nleaving a large fortune and a name justly honoured throughout the country.\r\n\r\nTo-day a visitor to his magnificent “estancia” of Tandil may still see,\r\nunder a glass shade, the knife and a model of the wagon which were the\r\nfirst instruments of his fortune.\r\n\r\nThe second story is more commonplace, but no less true. Twelve years ago\r\ntwo Neapolitan immigrants came to settle at Rosario. To gain a living,\r\nand no doubt in memory of their former trade, they founded in partnership\r\na _boliche_; that is, a bar for the sale of drinks. When a certain time\r\nhad elapsed, their business being far from prosperous, they decided\r\nthat one or the other of the two was one too many, and so determined\r\nto separate. But which of the two should retain the _boliche_? They\r\ndrew lots to decide the point; and he whom chance favoured retained the\r\nbusiness alone, while the other went in search of his fortune elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe latter, far from allowing himself to be discouraged, made for Rosario\r\nharbour, in search of a new trade: he assumed that of a dock-labourer or\r\nlighterman. This was at the time when the growing of maize was beginning,\r\nin the Province of Santa Fé, to give satisfactory results. Our hero,\r\nhaving spent some time in carrying sacks of grain upon his back from the\r\nquays to the vessels about to sail, conceived the idea of buying, with\r\nhis savings, a sack of maize, and to sell it retail, in the country, for\r\nthe purposes of seed. This first venture having succeeded, he continued\r\nhis operations with a larger number of sacks; then, finally, he abandoned\r\nthe trade of porter in order to enlarge his new business, which from that\r\ntime increased by thousands of sacks, and soon became a great export\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThanks to the development of the culture of maize in this region, he has\r\nbecome one of the greatest merchants and speculators in this product, and\r\nenjoys to-day a fortune of many millions, while his companion, less happy\r\nin his affairs, still keeps the little drink-shop in Rosario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n           THE PRODUCTION OF WHEAT IN THE ARGENTINE, COMPARED\r\n              WITH THE YIELD OF OTHER EXPORTING COUNTRIES\r\n\r\nThe world’s wheat-harvest——Comparison between the statistics of\r\n    consumption——The conditions of production in Russia and in the\r\n    Argentine——Comparison with the United States, India and Canada——\r\n    The prospects of the Argentine export trade in wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving described the progress realised by the Argentine Republic in\r\nthe course of the last few years, it will be not without interest to\r\ninquire what are the resources of those nations which are, or may be, the\r\ncompetitors of the Argentine in the world-market and in the production\r\nand consumption of wheat.\r\n\r\nHere, according to the most reliable sources, are the figures relating\r\nto the average yield of wheat in the whole world during the last sixteen\r\nyears:——\r\n\r\n                                       Period                  Year\r\n                                     1894-1903.        1904.          1907.\r\n\r\n  Europe (bushels of 60 lbs.)      1,468,000,000  1,656,000,000  1,652,000,000\r\n  America            ”               684,000,000    756,000,000    889,000,000\r\n  Asia and Australia ”               295,000,000    396,000,000    458,000,000\r\n  Africa             ”                43,000,000     57,600,000     54,800,000\r\n                                   -------------  -------------  -------------\r\n             Totals (approx.)      2,490,000,000  2,865,600,000  3,050,000,000\r\n                                   -------------  -------------  -------------\r\n\r\nWe see that the European production of wheat represents nearly 59 per\r\ncent. of the world’s production, for a population which, according to\r\nthe calculations of M. Levasseur, consists of about 411 millions of\r\ninhabitants. If we reduce this figure by one-fourth, thus eliminating\r\ninfants and the aged, we find that this population disposes of only 272·8\r\nlb. of wheat per head, or 521·2 lb. less than the “type” or standard\r\nration of 793·8 lb. per annum, recommended by the Bureau of Experimental\r\nStations of the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, after long\r\nand patient research.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this inquiry into the distribution of wheat production among\r\nall the countries of the world, we shall be able to judge of the rank\r\noccupied by the Argentine Republic, and by so doing to rectify an error\r\nwhich is frequently committed, the error of confounding exportation and\r\nimportation, which gives this country a very different place to that\r\nwhich is its right.\r\n\r\nHere are the figures showing how the production of wheat is distributed:——\r\n\r\n          COUNTRY.

This quantity represents an average of\r\n151·5 lb. per head per annum, or a deficiency of 249·7 lb. per head.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: There seems something improbable about this figure. For\r\none thing, very few people could eat over 2 lb. of wheat——representing\r\nover 3 lb. of bread——per diem; and white bread forms no important part of\r\nthe diet of most populations. Probably the figures represent the amount\r\nof bread _necessary_ to a hardworking labourer, whose dietary consists\r\nchiefly of bread——a diet only common to the south of England.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe population of Germany, estimated at 59 millions, has only 147·4 lb.\r\nof wheat per head, making a deficiency of 644·6 lb. per inhabitant.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom furnishes its 42,500 inhabitants with only 50·6 lb. of\r\nbread per annum, leaving a deficiency of 741·4 lb. per head.\r\n\r\nThus Europe, which, without Russia, produces more wheat than the rest of\r\nthe world, does not produce enough for her own consumption, low as it is.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to seek out these wheat-producing countries\r\nwhich are in a position to make up this deficiency. Now at the present\r\ntime there are very few such countries; they are Russia, the United\r\nStates, the Argentine Republic, Canada, and India, and among these it\r\nis the Argentine for which the most important place seems to have been\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\nRussia has hitherto been one of the great providers of wheat to Europe;\r\nbut it would seem that this position is not one that she can retain.\r\nRussia is far from having attained the degree of agricultural evolution\r\nwhich the Argentine has achieved; it is true that she exports 80 per\r\ncent. of her wheat harvest, but then the Russian peasant eats only rye\r\nbread. Of the 326 millions of acres of cultivated land in Russia, 30\r\nmillions only are devoted to wheat, or rather less than double the area\r\nused for the same cereal in France, or just double the wheat-area of the\r\nlast Argentine harvest.\r\n\r\nIn the wheat-belt of Tchernoziom, the black earth is all in cultivation,\r\nand its extent cannot be further increased. Fertile though this soil may\r\nbe, and although its depth is from 12 to 40 inches, the results amount to\r\nno more than four or five grains of wheat for each grain sown. The last\r\nharvest gave about 5·54 bushels per acre, while the average in France is\r\n20 bushels.\r\n\r\nThese results are due chiefly to the poverty and ignorance of the Russian\r\npeasant; it often happens that his wheat crop no longer belongs to him,\r\nhaving been sequestrated by the tax-gatherer in payment of unpaid taxes.\r\nOn the other hand, the Russian peasant cannot procure agricultural\r\nmachinery, the price of which is increased by exaggerated tariffs.[51]\r\nHe cannot even obtain draught animals, his wretched resources not\r\nallowing him to procure them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: More: when it is provided for him he frequently will not\r\nuse it; or it undergoes a series of remarkable accidents, so that the\r\nharvest has to be gathered by hand. This is more especially the case\r\nwhere he is reaping another’s harvest, when his object is to ensure the\r\nemployment of more hands. He is unable to understand that machinery means\r\nwealth and development. It is only fair to say that it seldom does in\r\nRussia, as he cannot easily get more land of his own, and his master’s\r\nestate is often hemmed in by others.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nIf to these factors we add the progressive exhaustion of the soil, we see\r\nthat the production of Russian wheat for export is very near its limit;\r\nthe more so as the home consumption of wheat tends to increase with the\r\neconomic development of the country. We can hardly wish otherwise than\r\nthat these peasant farmers, habituated to a life of poverty, should\r\nthemselves consume some of the wheat they produce, instead of contenting\r\nthemselves with rye.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare this picture of Russian production to that presented\r\nby the Argentine.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that is responsible for the superiority of the Argentine Pampa\r\nover the Russian steppes? It is the inexhaustible fertility of a virgin\r\nsoil, which produces abundant crops, without necessitating artificial\r\nenrichment, nor even the system of the rotation of crops. The soil yields\r\nharvests of 20 bushels to the acre, without exhaustion, producing for\r\nmany years in succession, as it is doing now in Chubut, in the south of\r\nBuenos Ayres, and in Córdoba, while the yield of the Russian harvests is\r\nonly 5·5 bushels.\r\n\r\nFor the exploitation of this wealth, Argentine agriculture employs the\r\nmost perfect machinery to be obtained in the world, employing thousands\r\nof horses also, to drive it; while the Russian peasant has to work\r\nwith his own hands, having neither machines nor horses to multiply his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say of the prosperous and fortunate situation of the\r\nArgentine colonist, who is not only enabled out of the fruits of his\r\nlabour to have bread and meat in abundance upon his table, but is often\r\nin process of acquiring, and that without long delay, the earth he\r\ncultivates. His happy lot has nothing in common with that of the Russian\r\npeasant, the veritable serf of the soil, who never gets so far as to eat\r\nthe smallest crumb of the wheat he has harvested.\r\n\r\nThe one labours under a soft, benign sky, which does not expose him\r\nto the rigour of extreme temperatures in an atmosphere of freedom and\r\nbrotherhood which make for energy, while the other labours at his\r\nfurrow in a severe and unequal climate, and under a system of political\r\noppression which crushes his individuality and diminishes the value of\r\nhis efforts. A comparison between the social and economic conditions\r\nof agriculture in the two countries inclines us to conclude, without\r\nprejudice, that Russia cannot be considered a dangerous rival to the\r\nArgentine or the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of the United States of America is incontestably the first\r\nwheat-growing country in the whole world; and it is interesting to\r\nconsider whether this country, which is also the greatest exporter of\r\nwheat, will remain in the future, in spite of the growth of internal\r\nconsumption, a formidable rival to the Argentine in the markets of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLet us first of all consider what great progress there has already been\r\nin the production of wheat in the United States.\r\n\r\n  Year.

Thus we find that in 1875 the\r\nyield was 12·3 bushels per acre; 17 bushels per acre in 1879; 11·7 in\r\n1883; 14·9 in 1892; 13·4 in 1899; 10·5 in 1902; 10 in 1903; and 13·6 in\r\n1904. Thus in spite of the increased yield, the results per acre have not\r\nincreased, and the average of 1904 is inferior to that of 1879; while in\r\nFrance the average yield has been one of 20 bushels per acre from 1900 to\r\n1904.\r\n\r\nThe national census of the United States for 1900 contains a graphic\r\nchart, which represents the average yield; from which we find that only\r\nin the north-west, certain districts of the west, and in a portion of the\r\nStates of Washington, Oregon, and California has the production equalled\r\nthis maximum of 20 bushels per acre; in most other localities, which\r\nafford the vast majority of cases, the yield has varied between 8·5 and\r\n15·6 gallons per acre.\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at the production of the United States, we must inquire\r\nwhether this great nation is increasing its exportation of wheat\r\nproportionately, and how far such exportation may prove an obstacle to\r\nthe development of the Argentine.\r\n\r\nThe following figures representing the years of the largest export of\r\nwheat, will throw light upon this matter.\r\n\r\n  Years.

But we must not forget that although the\r\nincrease in population is constant, that of production is not——indeed,\r\nthe harvest of 1901 amounted to only 273 million bushels of wheat, as\r\ncompared to 280 millions in 1877. There is a decrease in years of bad\r\nharvests, but the population naturally knows no such decrease.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of wheat did not increase between the census of 1890 and\r\nthat of 1900; the average remained 424·6 lb. per head, representing a\r\ndeficit of 368·8 lb. below the standard allowance of 793·4 lb.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as the population increases by about 1-1/4 or 1-1/3\r\nmillions per annum, while consumption remains stationary, we may conclude\r\nthat if this country has not yet reached its maximum of wheat-production,\r\nit is very near that stage, and that the moment is approaching at which\r\nall its wheat harvest will be absorbed by internal consumption, to the\r\ndetriment of the export trade.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned India as a wheat-exporting country; but it is no longer\r\na rival to the Argentine in the conquest of the international markets.\r\nHere is the comparative table of exportation from India and the Argentine.\r\n\r\n  Years.

On the other hand, it is known that India\r\nexports only 10 per cent. of her harvest, although her extremely frugal\r\npopulation consumes only 1·26 lb. of wheat per head, instead of the 793·4\r\nlb. we have taken as our basis of annual consumption. We see then that\r\nthe production of India, if her population consumed a normal amount of\r\nwheat,[52] would not satisfy the national requirements, so that far from\r\nexporting wheat she would, on the contrary, be forced to import large\r\nquantities from without.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: There is really no such thing as a normal consumption of\r\nwheat, especially for India. The amount consumed is a matter of climate,\r\nlocal or national foodstuffs, fuel, methods of cooking, etc.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n_Canada_ is among those wheat-growing countries whose competition is most\r\nto be feared; and this for many reasons——geographical, political and\r\neconomical. If Argentine statesmen do not seriously apply themselves to\r\nattracting a foreign population, and to reducing the expenses which press\r\nupon the inhabitants, the Argentine will run the risk of being supplanted\r\nin the future by this important British colony.\r\n\r\nCanada, from many points of view, presents a singular analogy to the\r\nArgentine Pampas. Like the latter, it is an almost desert country, its\r\narea being 3,190,000 square miles (nearly 2 millions more than the\r\nArgentine), with a population of 5,371,000, or slightly less than that\r\nof the Argentine; and like the latter, Canada is a country in process\r\nof formation. A similarity which completes the comparison is that the\r\nexports of Canada consist principally of the products of agriculture and\r\nstock-raising. Her principal client for wheat is England; in 1906-1907\r\nthe harvest was 84,470,000 bushels, and 41,033,000 bushels were exported;\r\nor almost exactly half.\r\n\r\nHere we should remark that the Canadian Government is making every\r\neffort to increase the population, and spares no pains to attain its\r\nobject. In contrast to what has been done in the Argentine, where the\r\npublic lands have only served to form _latifundia_, and to enrich a few\r\nindividuals, the soil in Canada is sold by the aid of accurate maps,\r\nwhich are accompanied by a mass of information upon questions that may\r\ninterest prospective colonists; more, the purchaser is given all kinds\r\nof facilities for payment, as well as for meeting the first expenses of\r\ninstallation. Thanks to a rational and active propaganda, immigration is\r\nabundant; the figures for 1903 were 128,364, compared with 112,671 in the\r\ncase of the Argentine. Finally, Canada contains 19,500 miles of railways,\r\nas against 13,600 in the Argentine.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing data we may conclude that the countries capable of\r\nexporting wheat are far from numerous, and that the area sown with\r\ncereals throughout the world is comparatively small. Hitherto wheat has\r\nbeen grown on an extensive scale in the United States, Russia, and India;\r\nthe agriculturalist demands everything of the soil and gives it nothing,\r\nso that the alternative will soon arise of losing the harvest, or of\r\nrestoring fertility to exhausted soils, by means of costly manures which\r\nwill absorb enormous sums. Then the legend of new countries will have had\r\nits day.\r\n\r\nTo resume: there exists an enormous discrepancy between the needs of the\r\nconsumer and the production of wheat; and the Argentine Republic, thanks\r\nto a concatenation of favourable economic and physical circumstances,\r\nis certainly in the best position in a great measure to supply this\r\ndeficiency. But to obtain the desired result it is indispensable that she\r\nshould still increase her population, and that the colonist should find\r\nupon the hospitable Argentine soil not only the guarantees of liberty and\r\njustice, but conditions propitious to his evolution as a land-owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                             STOCK-RAISING\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the; old “estancia”——The principal\r\n    stock-raising establishments: description, extent, number of\r\n    heads of cattle and favorite breeds——The great “estancias” of\r\n    the South and Patagonia.\r\n\r\nApproximate area of the soil devoted to cattle and sheep; general\r\n    estimate of the numbers of cattle and sheep——Results of\r\n    the census of 1908——The capital represented by Argentine\r\n    stock-raising.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of agriculture and its future, we must mention another\r\nindustry, which is the second source of national wealth——the pastoral\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the rapid rise in the value of land, and the\r\nmultiplication and selection of animals, the old form of Argentine\r\nstock-raising is undergoing, at the present time, a profound modification\r\nthroughout the country. The traditional ranch or _estancia_, on which\r\nthe animals browsed at will on vast prairies enclosed by wire fences,\r\nexposed to all the variations of the weather and all the vicissitudes\r\nof the temperature, feeding only on the grass of their pastures.\r\nThis old type of estancia is gradually disappearing; is undergoing a\r\ntransformation into carefully-managed farms, on which artificial prairies\r\nare constructed; farms with lucerne fields of 12,000, 25,000 or 50,000\r\nacres, surfaces difficult for a European to conceive.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: A field of 12,000 acres would be, for instance, 4 miles\r\nwide and over 4-1/2 miles long; one of 25,000 acres, 6 miles wide\r\nand 6-1/2 miles long; one of 50,000 acres, 7 miles wide and 11 miles\r\nlong.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe science of pedigree herds and the culture of carefully-enclosed\r\npastures have created, says a distinguished writer, the true pastoral\r\n_industry_, in which stables and barns and sheds take the place of the\r\nancient “corral.”[54] The wealthy owner drives from the railway station\r\nto his estancia in a carriage; the old rustic ranch-house is transformed\r\ninto a true country-house, sometimes a veritable _château_, with a park\r\nand gardens. There are estancias within a hundred leagues of Buenos\r\nAyres which we remember as desert country in the power of the Indians,\r\nwhere now traps and carriages of English type are seen crossing the\r\nplains, where folk dine in evening dress in luxurious homes. The European\r\nstock-breeders have driven back the Gaucho to the great estates on the\r\nborders of the desert.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Cf. Costumbres y Creencias populares de las Provincias\r\nArgentines_: A lecture by M. P. Groussac at the World’s Congress at\r\nChicago, June the 4th, 1893; published in _La Nacion_ of the 23rd of\r\nOctober 1893.]\r\n\r\nNothing would be more difficult——and for our part we renounce the\r\ntask——than to say which are the first stock-raising establishments of\r\nthe Republic; whether by reason of their extent, the numbers and the\r\nbreed of their animals, or the magnificent dwellings of their owners.\r\nEstablishments of this type are to be counted by hundreds, by thousands.\r\n\r\nNevertheless——though exposed to the danger of falling into inevitable\r\nerrors or omissions, for lack of precise information——we must not forget\r\nto mention the _Estancia San Juan_, founded by Señor Leonard Pereyra,\r\nat a distance of 25 miles from Buenos Ayres, and a mile and a half from\r\nthe La Plata, and consisting of over 40 square miles of meadows in full\r\nluxuriance. Then there is the _Estancia San Jacinto_, belonging to Señor\r\nHugel T. de Alvear, an establishment reputed as one of the foremost\r\nin the country, which embraces an area of 244 square miles, or about\r\none-third the area of the county of Surrey. Of this enormous area some\r\n64 square miles are under lucerne, and support 100,000 Durham cattle,\r\n100,000 Lincoln sheep, and 10,000 horses.\r\n\r\nThe _Estancia la Gloria_ of Santamarina & Sons, situated at Laprida, in\r\nthe Province of Buenos Ayres, comprises 145 square miles, and supports\r\n20,000 cattle and 60,000 sheep.\r\n\r\nAnother establishment, which might be taken as a model, is the _Estancia\r\nSan Martin_, the property of Señor Vincent L. Casares; which is situated\r\nat Cañuelas, and covers an area of some 30 square miles. The specialities\r\nof this establishment are the breeding of draught-horses——Morgans,\r\nHackneys, Shires and Clydesdales; the breeding of cattle——Durhams,\r\nHolsteins and Swiss——of which the finest individuals are kept for\r\nbreeding, and the second-grade animals fattened for export; the keeping\r\nand selling of bulls of the three varieties named for general breeding\r\npurposes; and finally the breeding of pedigree rams of the Lincoln\r\nand Negrete breeds, and also of pure cross-breeds and of pure-blooded\r\nYorkshire pigs. The horses from this estancia have a merited fame\r\nthroughout the Argentine, and are even beginning to be known abroad.\r\n\r\nA portion also of this estancia is an establishment known as _La\r\nMartona_, which alone supplies three-quarters of the milk consumed in\r\nBuenos Ayres, and which also manufactures butter for home consumption and\r\nfor export.\r\n\r\nAnother of the great stock-raising establishments of the Republic is\r\nthe Señor Carlos Casares’ _Estancia Huetel_, about 150 miles from\r\nBuenos Ayres, on the Southern Railway. It occupies an area of some 240\r\nsquare miles, all enclosed by wire fencing, and divided into forty-two\r\nstock-raising establishments, with fifty-seven shepherds’ houses and\r\nfive managers’ houses. This establishment contains about 62,000 Durham\r\ncattle, 87,000 Lincoln sheep, with pedigree rams, imported or born on the\r\nestancia, and 4200 Clydesdale horses, draught-horses and saddle-horses.\r\nAbout 11,000 acres are sown with lucerne, and 5000 with maize, wheat,\r\noats and linseed. There are fifty-six or more imported bulls, and notably\r\none of the finest of his race, the celebrated Aguinaldo, winner of the\r\nfirst prize awarded by the Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\nThe park of this estancia draws the attention of visitors; it is 500\r\nacres in extent, and contains some 520,000 forest trees, 870,000 shrubs,\r\nand 35,000 young trees. The total number of trees on the estate is over 2\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThere is a school on the estate, all the expenses of which are paid by\r\nthe proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe _Estancia San Jacinto_, owned by Señor Saturnin J. Unzue, also merits\r\na special description. It is a few hours distant from Buenos Ayres,\r\nand covers an area of some 55 square miles. It supports 10,000 cattle\r\nand 30,000 sheep. On this estancia the Durhams have been brought to a\r\ngreat pitch of perfection. The stud is famous for its saddle-horses, and\r\ncontains 140 pedigree animals, imported or born in the country.\r\n\r\n_Las Palmas_, belonging to Colonel Alfred T. Urquiza, would figure as\r\na model establishment in any country in the world. In the Province\r\nof Buenos Ayres, in which it is situated, it would be difficult to\r\nfind a pedigree stock-raising establishment so well organised, and so\r\nwell adapted to its purpose. The estate consists of some 4000 acres,\r\noverlooking the majestic Parana de las Palmas, with its green islands,\r\nwhich reach as far as the Rio de la Plata. Here about 3000 beasts are\r\nannually fattened for export. The cattle are shorthorns, and the horses\r\nHackneys.\r\n\r\nYet another establishment, which must be reckoned one of the best in the\r\nArgentine, is the _Cabaña San Gregorio_, belonging to Señor Gregorio\r\nVillafañe; an Argentine who in strict justice ought to be mentioned as\r\none of the first breeders in the country, on account of the intelligent\r\nefforts and pecuniary expenditure devoted by him to improving the breeds\r\nof cattle, sheep, and horses, during many years of personal labour.\r\n\r\nSeñor Villafañe’s establishment is not of very great extent, its area\r\nbeing only 18,000 acres, but is notable for the great number of its\r\npedigree cattle and the purity of type to be observed in his sheep. He\r\ndevotes himself chiefly to breeding Durham and Hereford bulls, Lincoln\r\nrams, Hackney and Clydesdale stallions, collie dogs, fox-terriers, Brahma\r\nfowls, Catalans, Dorkings, and Plymouth Rocks.\r\n\r\nWe must also mention the _Estancia San Pascual del Moro_, the property of\r\nSeñors Adolfo and Rufino Luro. It is famous for its stud of race-horses,\r\nfrom which issued, in 1904, the great winner of the season, Old Man.\r\n\r\nThis long list of breeding establishments would still be incomplete\r\nindeed, did we fail to make special mention of the _Estancia Chapadmatal_\r\nof Señor M.-A. Martinez de Hoz, who has made the greatest efforts to\r\nraise his establishment to the level of the best European models.\r\n\r\n“Equal to the best in Europe,” was the judgment of a competent and\r\nimpartial observer, Colonel Holdich, who, in his last book, entitled _Los\r\nPaises del Fallo del Rey_, bestows upon it this well-merited praise:——\r\n\r\n“A well-known estancia, that of Señor Michel-Alfred Martinez de Hoz,\r\nnear the Mar del Plata, surprised me by the singular character of its\r\nsurroundings. The soil, with its irregularities, had the look of an\r\nEnglish park. Little hills and knolls, one after another, stretched\r\naway, covered with their golden harvest, with soft undulations, to the\r\nprecipitous borders of the sea; instead of the eternal barbed-wire fence,\r\nliving hedges were already springing up, dividing the fields and the\r\npastures. On the highest hillocks rose stacks of oats, carried up from\r\nthe fields in the high-wheeled wagons characteristic of the country-side;\r\nand there the stacks were being rapidly built by hand-labour. It was a\r\nbeautiful rustic scene.\r\n\r\n“Lower to the right, on the softer soil by the banks of a stream, which\r\ndescended babbling to the sea, through beds of rushes and buttercups,\r\nwas a pasture; here, standing in the branches of the bank, were the\r\nShire horses; they formed animated groups, and placidly watched our\r\nmovements; they were the most magnificent examples to be found out of\r\nLincolnshire. Further down still, on drier soil, was a troop of mares,\r\nof an English-Creole cross, with their foals. These animals were for\r\ndraught, and the excellence of their breeding is proved by the registers\r\nof the Argentine Rural Society, which record the prizes awarded to the\r\n_Estancia Chapadmatal_.\r\n\r\n“In a higher part of the estate, in a quarter reached through long\r\navenues of poplars, which lead thither from the house, and where the\r\nground is covered with forests of eucalyptus or willows, are the bulls\r\nand cows. The Argentine stock-breeder does not consider expense when it\r\nis a matter of importing good English cattle for breeding purposes. The\r\nchief estancia has a series of breeding bulls, which are led before the\r\nvisitor, each by his special keeper, with the same pomp and ceremony as\r\nthe stallions which precede them in the brilliant review. It is not only\r\nnear the capital and the principal centres of population that we find\r\nthese model estancias, which afford their owners every European comfort.\r\nThey are to be found also in the extreme south of the country, in the\r\nsolitudes of Patagonia, near the 50th degree of south latitude.”[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Cf. Annales de la Sociedad Rural Argentina_, No. 4, 30th\r\nApril 1902, p. 159.]\r\n\r\n“From the River Coyle, from Puerto Gallegos and Magellan Straits, to\r\na point near Last Hope,” says an Argentine traveller, Mr George J.\r\nM’Lean, who visited these regions a few years ago, “the country is\r\nfairly peopled, and one comes across estancias, such as _El Condor_, the\r\nproperty of Messrs Wood & Waldron, an establishment of 337,500 acres,\r\nwith a wire-fenced enclosure containing 160,000 sheep, equipped with\r\nforty steam shearers, with hydraulic presses, and sheep-dips warmed by\r\nsteam calorifier. It is a common thing to find estancias, many of which\r\nare fenced with wire, feeding 40,000, 60,000 or 70,000 sheep. The most\r\nimportant are united by telephone, by which means they communicate not\r\nonly with each other, but with Puerto Gallegos or Punta Arenas. I have\r\nspoken down these over a distance of 300 miles. In the Chilian portion\r\nof Tierra del Fuego, there is a telephone connecting Cape Dungeness with\r\nPunta Arenas, and also to the channels of Last Hope.”\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Santa Cruz is the _Estancia San Julian_, belonging\r\nto the San Julian Sheep Company. This “estancia” has an area of 296,000\r\nacres——462·5 square miles——and contains 70,000 sheep, with an annual\r\nyield of 90 per cent. of lambs, or 63,000.\r\n\r\nIn the same Territory is another very prominent estancia, the property of\r\nthe Patagonian Sheep and Farming Company Limited. This embraces an area\r\nof 471,000 acres——734 square miles——the area of a medium-sized English\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the same Territory is a vast property of 700,000 acres——1060\r\nsquare miles——belonging to the Bank of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Chubut, which for some years has been a favourite\r\nlocality for European capital and European immigrants, and which contains\r\na large French colony, there is a very important estancia belonging\r\nto the Lochiel Sheep Farming Company Limited, which covers an area of\r\n327,000 acres, and contains 35,000 sheep.\r\n\r\nAnother foreign company established in the southern part of the\r\nArgentine, “The Argentine Southern Land Company,” possesses 1,518,000\r\nacres of land, of which 859,000 are in the Territory of Rio Negro, and\r\n659,000 in that of Chubut. This company was established in 1899, with a\r\ncapital of £230,000, later reduced, on account of business misfortunes,\r\nto £140,000, which is the present capital. On this company’s lands are\r\n45,000 cattle, 40,000 sheep, and 4300 horses.\r\n\r\nIn all these establishments, and in many others which we are unable to\r\ncite, as it is difficult to obtain precise information concerning them,\r\nwe find that, thanks to the intelligent efforts of their owners in\r\nseeking to import the best breeds of the most famous European breeding\r\nestablishments, there are now many stallions, bulls, and rams of the\r\npurest blood and of great value, which are either imported or selected;\r\nand through these the general stock of the country has reached a very\r\nhigh quality of race.\r\n\r\nAll stock-breeders, even the smallest, are aware to-day of the great\r\nadvantages to be obtained by crossing selected animals with sires of\r\npure blood, and the result has been a great advance in the stock-raising\r\nindustry. The statistics of importation show that in nine years, from\r\n1899 to 1907, plus eleven months of 1908, there have entered the country\r\nfrom England, where the Argentine breeder usually seeks his stud animals,\r\n10,040 bulls and cows, and 35,094 sheep. These two figures alone show\r\nthe importance which the Argentine breeder attaches to the improvement\r\nof the breed of his flocks and herds. The prices paid for these animals\r\nare sometimes extravagant; in one case £3520 was paid for a bull; but\r\nland-owners willingly pay such sums in the certainty that such sires will\r\nbring them considerable profits.\r\n\r\nThe area at the disposal of the Argentine stock-raiser is still\r\npractically unlimited. We need only remember that of the 750 millions of\r\nacres which roughly represent the area of the Argentine soil, one-half,\r\nor some 375 millions of acres, are adapted to stock-raising.\r\n\r\nOf this enormous area some 185 millions might be sown at once with\r\ncereals and fodder, notably in the coast Provinces, in Córdoba, and the\r\nPampa, and there remains as much more for stock-raising, without taking\r\ninto account the millions of animals that might be nourished by intensive\r\nculture in the cultivated zone. This extension would allow of the\r\nexistence of 40 million cattle and 200 million sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Results of the Census of Stock taken in 1908_\r\n\r\nWhat is the amount of stock at present in the Argentine Republic? We are\r\nin a position to answer this question, one of the present writers, Señor\r\nA. B. Martinez, having been appointed Director of the last agricultural\r\nand pastoral census, which was taken during the first fortnight of May\r\n1908, according to a law passed by Congress. The work which sums up the\r\nresults of this important undertaking is in three volumes, and is at\r\npresent in the press; thanks to which fortunate circumstance we are able\r\nto anticipate its publication, and to give our readers the benefit of\r\nthis investigation.\r\n\r\nThe census of agriculture and stock-raising, undertaken over the entire\r\nterritory of the Republic, has revealed the existence in Argentine\r\nterritory of 29,116,625 cattle, 7,531,376 horses, 465,037 mules, 285,000\r\nasses, 67,211,754 sheep, 3,945,086 goats and 1,403,591 swine.\r\n\r\nIf we compare these results with those of the two previous censuses, that\r\nof 1888 and that of 1895, we obtain the following table:——\r\n\r\n  CENSUS.      Cattle.     Horses.      Sheep.       Swine.\r\n   1888      21,963,930   4,262,917   66,701,097     403,203\r\n   1895      21,701,326   4,445,859   74,379,562     652,766\r\n   1908      29,116,625   7,531,376   67,211,754   1,403,591\r\n\r\nWe see from these figures that in twenty years, between 1888 and 1908,\r\nthe number of cattle has increased by 7,152,695 head; and in thirteen\r\nyears, between 1895 and 1908, by 7,415,099 head. The number of horses has\r\nincreased by 3,268,459 between 1888 and 1908, and by 3,085,517 between\r\n1895 and 1908. Sheep have increased by 510,657 between 1888 and 1908, but\r\ndecreased by 7,167,808 between 1895 and 1908. Swine, far from numerous\r\nif we compare their numbers with these obtained from other countries,\r\npresent a continual increase: 1,000,388 between 1888 and 1908, and\r\n750,825 between 1895 and 1908.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of 700,000 in the numbers of sheep in thirteen years is\r\nin keeping with what has been observed in the principal wool-producing\r\ncountries. Authorities assure us that of the 400 millions of sheep\r\nwhich existed in various parts of the world in 1873, there remain to-day\r\nbarely 300 millions. In Germany, for instance, to go by the _Journal\r\ndes Économistes_, the number of sheep has dropped from 19 millions to 7\r\nmillions in a space of twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this constant diminution are numerous. First of all\r\nwe will take the development of agriculture, which has expelled the\r\nsheep. According to an eminent collaborator in the census, “The sheep\r\nhas to walk, must walk far and wide, must walk always, in order to eat\r\nsufficiently——unless he does so, his food will be too costly; he is\r\nessentially a vagabond, and he consequently requires a great space and\r\ncontinual supervision.”[56] For these reasons the European small farmer\r\nprefers, if he can, to keep one or two cows in his cow-shed and suppress\r\nthe sheep entirely.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Probably the sheep would pay better if kept more as cattle\r\nare kept. The theory of long marches only applies to enormous flocks, so\r\nthick upon the ground that they must walk miles a day, eating all the\r\ntime. If the whole herd of sheep on a large sheep-farm were divided into\r\nmany small flocks, and the farm into, say, ten times as many pastures,\r\neach flock might be turned for two days into each pasture, so that it\r\nwould have three weeks’ growth on it before the flock returned: or, if\r\nlarge enough to feed the sheep twenty days, it would have twenty weeks in\r\nwhich to recover——time to grow a crop of leguminous fodder, after which\r\na splendid crop, or series of crops, of cereals could be grown upon it.\r\nUnder such a system the sheep would wander less, fatten quickly and be\r\nmore tender. English sheep-farming is on an infinitesimal scale, but the\r\nprofits from a small flock changed from pasture to pasture are often very\r\nconsiderable.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nSheep-breeding really gives encouraging results in regions where the\r\narea of the soil and the prairies is out of all proportion to the number\r\nof labourers available for its culture. Land given up to sheep cannot\r\nsupport the high rents paid by the producers of cereals; this is the\r\nprincipal cause of the decline of sheep-farming all the world over.[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Other causes are: the invention of mixtures of cotton\r\nand wool; the use of silk and mercerised cotton; and the production of\r\ncellular or netted cotton and linen underclothing, which is healthier\r\nand cheaper than wool, and equally warm; also the improvement of\r\nwool-bearing breeds, through which fewer sheep will produce the same\r\nquantity of wool. The export of cheap beef from America is another active\r\nfactor.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the total number of beasts of various kinds,\r\nclassed according to purity of breed:——\r\n\r\n  Species.

It is enough, for our purpose,\r\nto mention that in 1895, in the Province of Buenos Ayres, out of 100\r\ncattle, 6 per cent. were of pure blood: 49·2 per cent. were cross-bred,\r\nand 50·2 per cent. were of native breeds; and that thirteen years later\r\nthese figures were transformed into 6·2 per cent. of pure blood, 85·1\r\nper cent. of cross-bred cattle, and 8·7 per cent. of native breeds. This\r\nimprovement in the Province of Buenos Ayres is repeated in the other more\r\nproductive Provinces, and in the case of other species of animals.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that the number of cattle in the Argentine Republic is\r\nover 29 millions; this number may be analysed, according to sex, age,\r\netc., in the following manner:——\r\n\r\n                              _Year_ 1908.\r\n\r\n  Male calves           3,820,443\r\n  Heifers               3,511,412\r\n  Bulls                   886,450\r\n  Bullocks              4,687,027\r\n  Cows for breeding    12,825,904\r\n  Milch cows            2,163,900\r\n  Oxen                  1,221,489\r\n                       ——————————\r\n                       29,116,025\r\n                       ——————————\r\n\r\nIt now remains to consider the value of the animals registered as\r\nexisting in the Republic in the year of census 1908.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 this value was estimated at 1,136,780,411 piastres (paper), which\r\nwith the exchange at 300 per cent. was equivalent to 378,926,803 piastres\r\n(or dollars) in gold, or £75,785,360, 12s., while the latest census gives\r\na value of 1,481,282,245 piastres in paper, which with exchange at 2·27,\r\nis equivalent to 651,764,187 piastres in gold, or £130,352,835.\r\n\r\nIf now we analyse these figures, dividing them among the various species\r\nof animals, as given by the censuses of 1895 and that of 1908, we obtain\r\nthe following table:——\r\n\r\n  Species.           1895.                  1903.\r\n  Cattle          £44,568,493            £82,604,353·4\r\n  Horses            5,099,281·4           18,112,761·4\r\n  Mules               666,159·6            1,985,374·6\r\n  Asses               131,914                251,235\r\n  Sheep            24,525,101             25,287,598·6\r\n  Goats               389,139                732,322\r\n  Swine               405,272              1,379,192\r\n                  -------------         --------------\r\n                  £75,785,360           £130,352,837\r\n\r\nWe see from this that, in spite of the moderate valuation of the stock in\r\n1908, its value had increased, in thirteen years, by nearly £54,600,000.\r\n\r\nKnowing the numbers and the value of the live stock of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, a last question arises of the highest interest. What place does\r\nthe Argentine hold among those nations in which stock-raising has reached\r\nits highest development?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we have resorted to the most authoritative\r\npublications available, with the result that we are enabled to draw up\r\nthe following table:——\r\n\r\n                                                Species.\r\n\r\n       States.

Yet an examination of the\r\nabove figures is encouraging, for in view of the progress accomplished\r\nbefore the previous census, the Argentine may justly regard her flocks\r\nand herds with pride, and continue to increase them, thanks to her\r\nclimate, the fertility of her soil, and the energy of her inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: It must be remembered that of two beasts of equal purity\r\nof breed, and in perfect condition, the Argentine would be reckoned\r\nas being of the lower value. The reason of this is economic and very\r\nsimple. The Argentine bullock is affected by competition and pays tribute\r\nto the breeder, the railway company, the refrigerating company, the\r\nshipping line, the European buyer or salesman, and the retail salesman.\r\nConsequently it is worth less in the Argentine than in the States, where\r\nthe selling-price is artificially inflated, and where the value of a\r\nbeast to the breeder, since he has only to pay freight and the profit of\r\na large company, which is sometimes the breeder and the railway company\r\ntoo, is naturally far greater. It must not therefore be supposed that\r\nbecause the Argentine horse or bullock is cited as of lower value, that\r\nit is inferior. Its value is lower, just as good land in the Argentine is\r\ncheaper than in New York State.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                         THE VALUE OF THE SOIL\r\n\r\nDifficulties in estimating this value——Principal factors of\r\n    valuation——Examples taken from lucerne fields and the forests\r\n    of quebracho——Despite adverse circumstances, and with a few\r\n    exceptions, there has always been a tendency for the price of\r\n    land to rise——Alienation of lands acquired by conquest from the\r\n    Indians; their enormous present value——The rise of value dates\r\n    from 1902, and has hitherto continued without relapse——The\r\n    causes of this rise, and its rational principles, according to\r\n    an authoritative opinion.\r\n\r\nExamples of valuation drawn from the sales of public lands——The\r\n    rise of prices in the Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Córdoba, Santa\r\n    Fé, and the Pampa, with figures indicating the prices realised\r\n    in some large recent transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is more difficult than to determine the value of land in a\r\ncountry in the course of formation, like the Argentine Republic, in which\r\nit undergoes considerable increase from one moment to another; not only\r\non account of general progress, but also from special reasons, such as\r\ngood harvests, the construction of a railroad, etc. In the same region,\r\nin the same district, two neighbouring tracts will often have a different\r\nvalue, accordingly as they have or have not a permanent water-supply, or\r\nas they are more or less adapted to agriculture, nearer to or further\r\nfrom a railway, a station, or a centre of population.\r\n\r\nFor some years now, two new factors of valuation have come into being:\r\nthe culture of lucerne and the planting of quebracho wood.\r\n\r\nSince farmers have known of the enormous——the fabulous——profits to be\r\nderived from fields of lucerne, every buyer of land inquires first of all\r\nif there is water available; that is, if the subterranean water-level is\r\nnear the surface; as on that factor depends the existence of the lucerne\r\npasture for many years.\r\n\r\nIf upon investigation it is found that there is water the land, by this\r\nsole fact, acquires an enormous value in comparison to what it would be\r\nworth if it were unfit for lucerne.\r\n\r\nAn important newspaper, published in Buenos Ayres in the English tongue,\r\nthe _Standard_, has shewn that the price of land in Victoria (Australia),\r\nwhere the acre is worth from £4, 6s. to £9, compared to the prices paid\r\nfor land in the Argentine suitable for sowing lucerne (that is, in the\r\nsouth of Córdoba and San Luis, where there are no invasions of rabbits,\r\nwhere there is no drought, and which are half-way, so to speak, to the\r\nEuropean markets) proves, by comparison, the low value of Argentine land.\r\nEven when near a railway, such lands may be bought for 17s. 6d. or £1 per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the above affirmation, the _Standard_ has made the following\r\ncalculation: Let us suppose an expense of 6s. 5d, per acre for the\r\nexpenses of sowing and cultivating an acre of soil (including sowing it\r\nwith lucerne at £2 per cwt.), it follows that the acre costs from £1, 3s.\r\nto £1, 8s., and the square league of 6175 acres (representing the work of\r\neighteen months) about £7920. Adding £880 for fencing and watering, we\r\nfind the price of the square league (9.648 square miles) amounts to some\r\n£8800.\r\n\r\nWhat, according to the _Standard_, is the profit to be drawn from this\r\nsquare league? It will fatten some 4500 head of three-year-old cattle,\r\nwhich may be bought at £4, 8s. per head, and seven months later sold\r\nat £7, 18s. 6d.; this will give a profit of £3, 10s. 6d. per head, or\r\na gross profit of £15,862. Deducting £7040[59] for expenses (allowing\r\nfreight to the extent of 10s. 6d. per head), there remains a net profit\r\nof £8800 per league per annum, or 100 per cent. on the outlay. If such\r\nare the results to be obtained from the transformation of an uncultivated\r\ntract of land into a lucerne pasture, it is not surprising that rural\r\nproperty is so quickly attaining so high a value.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Apparently made up of half the cost of the lucerne pasture,\r\nplus freight and labour; as two sets of beasts can be fattened in a year\r\nor a little over.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nIn the case of quebracho——a very hard wood which is useful for building\r\nand constructive purposes, and from which an excellent tannin can be\r\nobtained——matters are much the same. Having had experience of the large\r\nprofits to be derived from the manufacture of quebracho extract, and\r\nthe splendid dividends paid by the companies engaged in the work, men\r\nor business, anxious to invest their capital to advantage, hastened to\r\nacquire forests of quebracho, with the result that the price of such\r\nland suddenly rose to a level hitherto undreamed of. Tracts situated\r\nin the Chaco——a region where quebracho abounds——which were selling a\r\nyear previously for £88 the square league of 9648 square miles, rose in\r\nprice to £880, and this latter price can by no means be considered as a\r\ndefinite maximum.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of lucerne and quebracho is also, though on a much smaller\r\nscale, true of linseed or wheat, when after an abundant harvest the\r\nland-owner or farmer procures the requisite capital for the purchase of\r\nthe land he has been cultivating and pays a good price for it. There are\r\nhere elements which confound all calculations made in advance, and make\r\nit difficult to fix even an approximate value on the soil.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment there is no basis for such a valuation. A farm\r\nselling to-day at 20s. per acre, may to-morrow sell for 26s., the day\r\nafter to-morrow for 32s., and so on, until prices are reached which\r\nastonish the first vendor, and give him the melancholy conviction that he\r\ndid ill to part with his land. For this reason, the best thing one can do\r\nto-day is to hold on to the land.\r\n\r\nThe value of rural and urban property has gone on increasing more and\r\nmore rapidly for more than forty years; and although there have been\r\ngreat fluctuations in prices, the rise has always been constant in the\r\nlong run; owing to the increase in the population, the consolidation of\r\npolitical institutions, the construction of far-reaching railway systems,\r\nthe prodigious development of international traffic, and, as a natural\r\nconsequence, the great increase of public wealth.\r\n\r\nTo gain an idea of the entire significance of this increase in values,\r\nwe must go back to the more than modest prices of rural property which\r\nruled before the later development of the upward movement. It is enough\r\nto recall the fact that in 1879, with the object of procuring funds in\r\nsupport of the expedition which General Roca was leading against the\r\nIndians of the wilderness, an expedition which resulted in the conquest\r\nof 226,800 square miles of territory, the Government offered for sale\r\nan enormous tract of land at the price of £80 the league (about £9 the\r\nsquare mile), the purchase-money to be payable over five years. But the\r\ndevaluation of these lands was so great, and faith in their remunerative\r\npossibilities so inferior, that very few accepted the offer. Many did so\r\nrather as a patriotic loan than as a serious investment. Others did so as\r\na mark of personal deference towards the men who were at the head of the\r\nGovernment. But all have been abundantly rewarded, since much of the soil\r\nwhich they were able to obtain at £35 the league is selling to-day at\r\n£26,000 and £35,000. More than one of the great private fortunes in the\r\ncountry had no other foundation than this.\r\n\r\nThis depreciation of rural property continued still unchanged for a dozen\r\nyears; so much so, that in order to tide over the crisis before the crash\r\nof 1890, the Government, which so disastrously handled the affairs of\r\nthe nation, had the evil inspiration to offer for sale in Europe, by\r\nvirtue of the law of October the 15th, 1889, those very 24,000 leagues\r\nof land obtained by conquest by General Roca’s expedition. The sale was\r\nto be effected at the figure of 10 francs per hectare——about 3s. 3d. per\r\nacre!——payable half upon purchase and half at the end of two years. No\r\nlimit was set to the powers of purchase of any one buyer; each could buy\r\njust as much as his purse would allow. The law, in palliation of this\r\nincredible operation,[60] promised to apply the whole product of the\r\nsales to the fund for converting the issue of the guaranteed bank-notes\r\nof famous memory. Providence, happily, which more than once has taken\r\nthe Argentine under its especial protection, prevented this disastrous\r\nalienation of territory from taking place. Had it been otherwise, the\r\nRepublic would have sold for a mess of pottage a magnificent portion of\r\nher territory, a country large enough to house more than one European\r\nnation, and which to-day perhaps would be in the hands of a company or a\r\nforeign government——a new state within the State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: It must be remembered that this tract was four and a half\r\ntimes the size of England!——and this enormous country, in the heart of\r\nthe Argentine, was offered for sale to foreigners! The process of buying\r\nit back when the terrible folly of the act was once obvious, would have\r\nbeen equivalent to making the country tributary for years, and for\r\nenormous sums, to Europe.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe depreciation of rural property continued for some years. Thus,\r\nin 1897, the Government sold by tender to the highest bidder a large\r\nportion of its best lands, at the price of 3750 piastres, or £330 the\r\nsquare league (about £36 the square mile), payable in five years, with\r\npermission to pay in bonds of the patriotic loan, which then stood at\r\nabout 75 per cent.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: The piastre note, was then worth 1 franc 71——1s. 4·4d.,\r\nor 34·2 per cent. of the par value. It was later fixed by law at 44 per\r\ncent.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThis situation continued until 1902——a year which saw the settlement of\r\nthe old question of the Chili-Argentine frontier; a year of abundant\r\nharvests and enormous development in the stock-raising world; a\r\ndevelopment which took shape first in the export of cattle on the hoof\r\nand then in the despatch of great quantities of chilled or frozen meat\r\nto the English markets; a year which also saw the advent of a financial\r\nstability resulting from the “law of monetary conversion,” which gave a\r\nfixed value to paper money, the medium of all commercial transactions in\r\nthe interior. Then came a steady and decisive rise in the value of landed\r\nproperty in general and of rural property in particular.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of this movement the value of the soil has steadily\r\nincreased; the last price is always greater than the previous one,\r\nalthough the latter may have appeared stationary, if not final. This\r\nbeing the case, we ought to ask whether this general rise responds\r\nto permanent and sufficient causes, or if it is only the result of\r\ncapricious speculation, affecting landed property now as at another time\r\nit affected paper money.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this question, Señor Roman Bravo, one of those Argentines who\r\nare most familiar with all the complex aspects of land valuation,——for he\r\nis the Director of the house of business[62] which transacts the greater\r\nproportion of such operations——has at our request summed up, in the\r\nfollowing terms, the causes which at present determine the increase in\r\nthe value of property:——\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: The sales by auction conducted by this house during the\r\nfirst six months of 1905 amounted to £2,376,000.]\r\n\r\n“The economic life of the country offers at each step signs of further\r\nprogress. The enlargement of ports, the extension of railways, the\r\ndredging of channels, the development of the building trade in the\r\nchief city of the Republic, all show the spirit of enterprise at present\r\nanimating the individual and the people. Commerce and vigorous industries\r\nreinforce these elements of prosperity and welfare.\r\n\r\n“But it is in matters of land purchase that we best perceive the material\r\nexpansion and the intensity of the forces in action. Without going back\r\nto the year 1904, we have only to consider the transactions of the last\r\nfew years to realise that, both in the capital of the Republic and in the\r\nnational Territories and the Provinces, the period has been a fertile one\r\nin the matter of transactions in landed property. There has been no more\r\nactive period since 1889; and this time the facts have an explanation,\r\na natural and logical sanction. Agriculture and stock-raising have so\r\naugmented the sources of national wealth that in a few years the balances\r\nin favour of the country have reached the figure of nearly £20,000,000.\r\nThis is the effective cause of the increased value of the land: to which\r\nwe must add the confidence which we all feel in the gradual development\r\nof the forces which labour has released, to the benefit of public\r\ntranquillity.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising examples of the increased value of the soil,\r\nand of the interest awakened by sales of land, is to be found in the\r\npublic and official auction of national lands which took place in the\r\nmonth of April 1905.\r\n\r\nThese sales were to be effected on account of those who had bought these\r\nlands in analogous circumstances in 1897, and who had not paid for them\r\nduring the delay stipulated by the law. The whole surplus over the price\r\nestablished by the previous sale, less deductions for interest and other\r\nexpenses, went by law to the original purchaser. The auctions were\r\nconducted in the presence of a crowd of speculators, capitalists, and\r\nlabourers, eager to invest their money in so remunerative a speculation,\r\nsince in the Argentine all are convinced that the purchase of the soil is\r\nthe best form of saving. The result of the sale was that in many cases\r\ndouble the original price was obtained; three times the price in some\r\ncases, and in some five times the original price was realised.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Pampa Central an area of 933,680 acres was offered\r\nfor sale, the previous price being £49,693; the sale price was £135,297,\r\nrepresenting an average price of £842·6 per league, or 2s. 8·7d. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Chubut, 265,278 acres were put up to auction, the\r\noriginal price being £5243·5, and the sale price £25,361·6, or an average\r\nof £590·28 per league, or 1s. 9·7d. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Santa Cruz an area of 98,800 acres was put up for\r\nsale, the first price being £3391·34, and was sold for £9477·6, or 1s.\r\n10d. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Chaco, in which especial interest was felt, as the\r\nlands in question bore forests of quebracho trees of great value (the\r\nquebracho industry being then in vogue), higher values were obtained,\r\nrepresenting five times the original sale price. The lands to be sold\r\nin this Territory represented a surface of 123,500 acres, and were\r\nfirst disposed of for £4948. However, a price of £24,170 was obtained,\r\nrepresenting an average of £1208·24 per league, or 4s. 6·9d. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Rio Negro 74,100 acres were put up for sale, which\r\nwere previously sold for £3058. They realised £8712, or £726 per square\r\nleague, or 2s. 4·2d. per acre. The general result of the sale was that\r\nthe Government did a splendid stroke of business; but the transaction\r\nwas still more to the profit of the fortunate first applicants, who, for\r\nfailing to comply before a given date with the conditions established\r\nby law, were rewarded by receiving the price of sale less the price at\r\nwhich they bought; sums which to many of them represented a considerable\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nSince that period the value of land has continually increased, as we see\r\nfrom the following information, which was given us by the “General Bureau\r\nof Lands and Colonies” of the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1906 and 1907,\r\nthis Bureau sold by public auction a large section of public lands, and\r\nthe prices obtained were far higher than those we have recorded above.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Rio Negro, in August 1906, 497,600 acres were sold at\r\nan average price of 9s. 8d. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn March 1907, 314,974 acres of land, situated in the Peninsula Valdez\r\n(Chubut) found a buyer at 6s. 7-3/4d. per acre.\r\n\r\nNumerous sales were effected in 1907 in the Pampa Central. Among others,\r\nwe may cite the following: 18,520 acres sold at 10s. 6·7d. and 4640 at\r\n10s. per acre; a lot of 18,750 acres at an average price of 6s. 9·7d.;\r\n7500 at 6s. 5d.; 151,410 acres at 4s. 4.8d.; 1235 acres at 3s. 7·6d.; and\r\n12,350 acres at 3s. 11·3d. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn October of the same year, auction sales were held in various portions\r\nof Pampa Central, the results being as follows: 16,425 acres at 8s.\r\n10·24d.; 5390 at 8s. 2·3d.; 40,137 at 10s. 3d.; 24,700 at 7s. 4·3d.;\r\n306,050 at an average price of 3s. 8·5d.; 24,700 at 3s. 7·8d., and 9182\r\nat 6s. 7·8d. These examples are given to show the variety of actual\r\nprices, according to the situation and the yield of the land.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of private sales, it is difficult to keep track of rising\r\nvalues on account of the number of sales which take place every day. We\r\nwill try, however, to give a few examples, to arrive at some approximate\r\nvalue of the Argentine soil in the year 1905.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Buenos Ayres, which is the most thickly populated and\r\nthe wealthiest in the Republic, is also that in which rural property has\r\nreached its highest value. In the district of Lobos, a few hours from\r\nBuenos Ayres, a field of 170 acres, known as the Atucha Meadow, was sold\r\nfor £26, 7s. 2d. per acre; another of the same area for £59, 8s. 9d. per\r\nacre; another of 635 acres for £12, 1s. 0d. per acre, and another of 587\r\nacres for £14, 4s. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the region of Rojas, also some hours from the Federal capital, the\r\nland on which stood the “San José,” “Santa Barbara,” and “La Matilde,”\r\nestablishments belonging to Señor Roberto Cano, and whose area was 15,800\r\nacres, was sold for an average price of £8, 8s. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Dolores, not far from Buenos Ayres, a meadow\r\nbelonging to the “Montes del Tordillo” estate, composed of 18,850 acres,\r\nwas sold for 19s. 1·4d. per acre. In the section of Lincoln 10,000 acres\r\nwere sold at prices varying from 48s. to £5, 2s. per acre. At Trenque\r\nLauquen, one of the belts of land in Buenos Ayres which has seen the most\r\nrapid rise in values, sales have been effected of 22,000 acres at prices\r\nrising from £1, 18s. to £3, 6s. per acre, the average being £2, 8s.\r\n\r\nIn this same section, some 8 miles from the railway station of Primera\r\nJunta, 1976 acres were in 1907 sold at prices varying from £2, 8s. 3d.\r\nto £5, 12s. 9d. At General Pinto the land belonging to the “Filadelfia”\r\nestate, 23,198 acres in extent, was sold at an average price per acre of\r\n£2, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\nIn the department of Olavarria 19,856 acres were sold in 1908 for prices\r\nvarying from £3, 7s. 8d. to £7 per acre, the average being £5.\r\n\r\nIn the department of General Conesa, 11,085 acres, facing the Bay of São\r\nBorombon, and 23 miles east from San Dolores, found a buyer at an average\r\nprice of £1, 3s. 4d. per acre. In the department of Coronel Pringles, the\r\nestablishment known as El Bombero, situated some 19 miles to the west of\r\nTres Arroyes, divided into thirty-one lots of from 370 to 4940 acres, was\r\nsold at prices running from £2, 1s. 1-1/2d. to £4, 2s.\r\n\r\nAmong these sales of 1908 which attracted most attention were those\r\ntransacted in the Province of Buenos Ayres. These included a tract at\r\nExaltacion de la Cruz of an area of 914 acres, near the railway station\r\nof Cardales, which, sold in small lots of from 58 to 180 acres, obtained\r\nan average price per acre of £29.6 per acre. At Lomas de Zamora the land\r\nof the establishment “Santa Ines” were sold to the Sansinena Company for\r\n£13, 3s. 6d. per acre. In the department of Azul, a meadow known as “La\r\nVanguardia,” of an area of 2080 acres, 11 miles from the town of Azul,\r\nfound a buyer at £7, 16s, per acre. The San Miguel estate, near the\r\nManzanares railway station, subdivided into thirty-six lots, was sold at\r\nan average price of £10, 5s. per acre. On the 19th of August 1908, in the\r\nsame department, 741 acres fetched a price of £12, 9s. 2d. per acre. At\r\nGeneral Belgrano, less than 2 miles from the railway station, 3294 acres,\r\ndivided into five lots, were sold at prices varying from £8, 11s. to £10,\r\n13s. 10d. A tract of 499 acres about 1000 yards from Jeppener Station, in\r\nthe department of Brandzen, was sold at the rate of £12, 5s. 9d. Finally,\r\nat Burzaco, at a distance of 2500 yards from the station, 494 acres of\r\nland attained the fabulous figure of £42, 15s. per acre.\r\n\r\nThese are high prices in comparison with those ruling formerly, and at\r\npresent they are firmly maintained.\r\n\r\nThe prices of lands suitable for agriculture vary greatly, according\r\nto their distance from the great city of Buenos Ayres or the port of\r\nBahia Blanca, and their proximity to a railway station; accordingly as\r\nthey have water near the surface, and are thus adapted to the growth of\r\nlucerne; and according to the terms of payment granted by the vendors.\r\nThere are, of course, other factors as well.\r\n\r\nAmong many other examples, we will cite the 588,050 acres of land at\r\nCurumalan, ten hours from Buenos Ayres, the property of a syndicate\r\nwhich bought them in 1903 from Messrs Baring Bros, of London, at a price\r\nof £807,575. Up to July the 1st, 1905, this company had sold more than\r\n247,000 acres of land directly to agriculturalists——Russian for the most\r\npart——at prices varying from £2, 10s. 8d. to £3, 4s. 1d., allowing them a\r\nterm of three or four years for payment, plus an interest of 8 per cent,\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Córdoba is, after the Province of Buenos Ayres, that in\r\nwhich the land has most rapidly risen in value. Transactions in rural\r\nproperty are very numerous and represent an important figure. In the five\r\nyears from 1899 to 1903, about 9,386,000 acres have changed hands, and in\r\n1904 alone 3,820,830 acres were sold.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give an account of these transactions by reason of\r\ntheir number; but to cite only the most important, we may mention a\r\nblock of 61,750 acres in the department of Juarez Celman, belonging to\r\nAlejandro Roca, which was sold at public auction in the early part of\r\n1905, at prices varying from 17s. 10-1/2d. to £2, 6s. per acre. In view\r\nof the prices which the buyers realised later, they made a splendid\r\nbargain; none of them sold for less than double what he gave. In the\r\nUnion department of the same Province, 59,904 acres were sold at prices\r\nvarying from 13s. 3d. to £1, 16s. 11d. per acre.\r\n\r\nAnother important sale, effected also in the early part of the same year,\r\nwas that which took place in the department of Tulumba, fifty miles from\r\nthe colony and railway station of Morteros on the Central Argentine\r\nrailway. The block sold comprised an area of 20,826 acres, and the\r\nprices obtained varied from 1s. 5.8d. to 2s. 2d. per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Santa Fé, the appreciation of land values has of late\r\nyears been neither so great nor so rapid as in Buenos Ayres and Córdoba;\r\nthe reason being that it was this Province which initiated the colonising\r\nmovement in 1856, by the foundation of the Esperanza Colony, so that\r\nits land values had already undergone sudden augmentations in previous\r\nyears. In the five years from 1899 to 1903, the sales have amounted to\r\n£5,831,160 acres, and in 1904 to 2,026,420 acres. In the department of\r\nGeneral Lopez 23,487 acres were sold for prices varying between 2s. 4d.\r\nand £2, 18s. 3d.\r\n\r\nWe may also note a tract of 8204 acres, 8 miles from La Serna railway\r\nstation, which in 1908 was sold for £1, 12s. per acre.\r\n\r\nThe Provinces of San Luis and Santiago de l’Estero were the last to take\r\npart in this movement of appreciation of land values. The former, in\r\nespecial, has from this point of view been a revelation to every one. As\r\nsoon as it was discovered that the soil of this Province was admirably\r\nadapted to the formation of splendid meadows of lucerne, its value\r\nrapidly rose from 1s. 5-1/2d. to 6s. 5.7d., 12s. 11d., and 19s. 5d.\r\n\r\nWe must, in particular, mention a meadow known as the “Agualapada,”\r\n98,000 acres in area, which on the 27th of July 1908 was sold at the rate\r\nper acre of 5s. 4d. 53,219 acres of land, some 13 miles from the railway\r\nstations of Nueva Galia and La Fortuna were bought at an average price of\r\n10s. 3d. per acre. In the department of Pedernera 16,043 acres, divided\r\ninto five lots, found purchasers at prices varying from 16s. 2d. and £1,\r\n1s. 2d. to £1, 15s. 9d.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have already said, it is in the Pampa——in that vast country\r\nof 56,170 square miles in area——larger than England——which was\r\nincorporated in 1880, after the expedition led by General Roca——that\r\nthe most surprising examples of appreciation are to be found. There all\r\nis undergoing a continual transformation; each year the plough opens\r\nwider furrows for the seed; the sowing of lucerne is rapidly increasing;\r\nstock-raising establishments are to be found in the very confines of the\r\ncountry; and a large network of railways, in operation, in construction,\r\nor under consideration, promise to surround it on every hand, to\r\ncirculate its products and to facilitate exchange. All these wonderful\r\ntransformations are being effected under our eyes, day by day; so that it\r\nis not surprising that the value of the soil follows this tide of energy.\r\n\r\nIn the Pampa Central, of late years, we have seen land suitable for\r\nlucerne, with water 10 to 30 feet below the soil, not far from populated\r\ncentres, and with means of rapid communication, fetch prices which\r\nquadrupled those it had touched eighteen months earlier, selling for\r\nas much as £3, 11s. 3d. per acre. In more than one case land which was\r\nbought for £880 the square league was afterwards sold for £8800.\r\n\r\nAmong the sales of 1908 was one of a meadow of 18,525 acres, six miles\r\nfrom Utracan Station, which, sold by order of the law, fetched a price\r\nof 17s. 10d. per acre. In another part of the same Territory 7698 acres\r\nwere sold in a single lot, on the 1st of October 1908, at the rate of £1,\r\n4s. 7d. per acre. In the Alfalfa Colony, during an auction sale, several\r\n_chacras_, or small farms, attained prices varying from £1, 19s. 3d. to\r\n£2, 2s. 9d. per acre.\r\n\r\nBy the Catrilo railway station on the Western Railway, situated in\r\nthe same Territory of El Pampa, is a field whose owner, M. Mathias R.\r\nSturiza, was offered £61,600 for it; two years earlier he had bought it\r\nfor £5280.\r\n\r\nCompetent authorities assure us that in the neighbourhood of Santa Rosa\r\nde Toay, the capital of the Territory of the Pampa, the value of the\r\nfields has been shown by recent sales to have increased by 300 per cent.\r\nIn the department of Victoria, in the same Territory, fields which a\r\nwhile ago were offered at 2s. 1.5d. per acre, are to-day selling for £1,\r\n1s. 4d.——ten times that sum.\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief manifestations of the economic phenomena of the\r\nappreciation of land values; one of the most interesting of the problems\r\nwhich present themselves to the observer of the modern Argentine\r\nRepublic. Is it a true symptom of national vitality, or must we see in\r\nthese data the warnings of a period of commercial crisis, characterised,\r\naccording to the learned economist Juglar, by the rise of all values and\r\nby frantic speculation?\r\n\r\nEvents, which unroll themselves amidst our feverish Argentine activities\r\nfar more rapidly than in other countries, will not be long in giving us\r\nthe answer to these questions.[63]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: The importance of the sales of rural property is to-day so\r\ngreat, and speculation so eager, that the prices given here, according\r\nto information gathered barely a few months ago, appear to us already as\r\nancient history.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                        AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nSUGAR-CANE——Area of plantations——Statistics of production——\r\n    Legislation affecting sugar——Consumption.\r\n\r\nVINES——Area of vineyards planted——Production, consumption——\r\n    Imperfect quality——Competition of foreign imports.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO——Area of plantations——Value of the product——Defective\r\n    preparation.\r\n\r\nTHE MULBERRY——The culture of the silk-worm might be established in\r\n    the Argentine, but at present exists only in an experimental\r\n    condition.\r\n\r\nMATÉ——Large consumption of this product.——Statistics of foreign\r\n    importation——Districts suitable for its growth.\r\n\r\nCOTTON——Physical conditions proper to its growth——The first\r\n    favourable results in the Argentine——Its introduction into\r\n    Chaco——Lack of manual labour for the development of this\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\nRUBBER——Existence of rubber plants in the Argentine——An unexploited\r\n    source of wealth.\r\n\r\nARBORICULTURE——On account of the diversity of the climate, all\r\n    fruit-trees can be grown in the Argentine——The various fruits\r\n    cultivated in different regions——Amelioration of the products.\r\n    The trade in fruit——Its development possible on account of the\r\n    inversion of seasons as compared with Europe——Refrigeration\r\n    applied to the transport of fruit——Regions particularly\r\n    suitable for fruit-growing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the culture of cereals, such as wheat and maize and linseed, and\r\nthe important grazing and cattle-breeding industries of the Argentine,\r\ntogether with their dependent industries, there are other forms of\r\nagriculture and forms of natural produce, some of which have already\r\nattained a great importance, while others are destined to become equally\r\nimportant in the near future; that is, if the progress of evolution in\r\nthe Argentine follows, as there is reason to hope, its natural upward\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n_Sugar-cane._——Among the agricultural industries the culture of the\r\nsugar-cane assumes the first rank. The cane is cultivated principally in\r\nthe Province of Tucuman, in which Province are established the greater\r\nnumber of the sugar factories existing in the Republic. The cane is\r\nalso planted, and flourishes, in portions of the Provinces of Santiago,\r\nSalta, and Jujuy; in the north of Santa Fé, in Corrientès, and in the\r\nTerritories of Formosa, Chaco, and Misionès.\r\n\r\nSugar-planting is an industry of considerable antiquity in the Argentine;\r\nbut it has attained a remarkable development chiefly in the last ten\r\nyears, owing to the high price of sugar and the establishment of numerous\r\nfactories equipped with perfected machinery; owing also to the notable\r\nprofits which the industry offers.\r\n\r\nThe result has been an excess of production, which led the industry\r\ninto a dangerous crisis, from which it is now in a fair way to recover.\r\nThose who suffered the most were those who had abused their credit by\r\nbuilding expensive factories and laying down costly plant; and those who\r\nhad planted sugar in soils unsuited to its culture, or in regions of\r\nunfavourable climate, or where the means of transport were insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe total area cultivated in 1907 was estimated at about 172,900 acres,\r\nof which 14,029 were in the Province of Tucuman; 11,115 in Southern\r\nChaco; 6916 in Salta; 3952 in Jujuy, and 2717 in Santiago de l’Estero;\r\nthe rest being divided among various other regions of the Republic; these\r\nfigures representing an increase of nearly 24,000 acres over those of\r\n1895. These 172,900 acres of cane give an average yield of 30 tons of\r\nsugar per hectare, or 11·727 tons per acre, representing a total yield of\r\n132,160 tons of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of sugar refineries are to be found in the Province\r\nof Tucuman, where there are thirty-two. In the other sugar-growing\r\ndistricts there are only thirteen, which are distributed as follows:\r\nThree in Jujuy, two in Santiago de l’Estero, one in Salta, one in\r\nMisionès, six on the banks of the Parana River, two in Santa Fé, two in\r\nCorrientès, one in Chaco, and one in Formosa.\r\n\r\nThe net cost of producing the cane, ready for delivery, is about 5 to\r\n7 centavos[64] per 10 kilograms. Taking as basis a yield of 30,000\r\nkilograms per hectare and a sale price of 12 centavos, the growers would\r\nmake a net profit of 140 piastres per hectare; or, with the value of the\r\npiastre note at 2·2 francs, of £4, 2s. 6d. per acre. Thus sugar-planting\r\nis a profitable industry under normal conditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: The centavo is 1/100 or ·01 of the piastre. In metallic\r\ncurrency it is equal to the American cent, and nearly to the English\r\nhalfpenny; in paper it is worth a little over one-fifth of a\r\npenny——·22727 pence.]\r\n\r\nThe outgoings and receipts on an acre of soil planted with cane may be\r\nestimated as follows:——\r\n\r\n                       RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n  By sale of 12 tons of cane, at 12·8d. per\r\n      cwt.                                       £12 16  0\r\n\r\n                       EXPENSES.\r\n\r\n  _Cost of Planting——_\r\n    Tilling and preparing soil                    £0  9 11\r\n    Lining out and fixing shoots                   0 16  4\r\n    Shoots, preparation, etc.                      0 12  9\r\n  _Cost of Harvesting——_\r\n    Cutting 12 tons of cane                        0 14  2\r\n    Preparing the cane                             0 14  2\r\n    Transport to factory and extras                2 13  5\r\n    Interest on the land, or rent, taxes, and\r\n      redemption                                   1  1  3\r\n                                                  ————————\r\n                                                  £7  2  0\r\n                                                  12 16  0\r\n                                                  ————————\r\n                                Net profit        £5 14  0\r\n                                                  ————————\r\n\r\nWith an increased consumption of sugar, the culture of the cane will\r\noccupy a far greater area of the belt in which it is already established.\r\nIt is, however, limited by the interests of the manufacturers themselves,\r\nwho limit production in order to keep up the price of sugar, and so\r\nobtain higher profits; sugar of native preparation being protected by\r\nlaws which strike at the importation of foreign sugar.[65]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: This is an interesting object-lesson in the working of\r\na tariff. Foreign competition once abolished by the increased prices\r\nof foreign articles, the native manufacturer will always minimise, and\r\neven destroy, the protection afforded by the tariff, by increasing his\r\nown prices. If he cannot do so naturally he will do so by lessening his\r\noutput; with the result that sooner or later the tariff will actually\r\nincrease foreign imports and still further limit home production.\r\nObviously the only circumstance under which it can permanently profit\r\neven the manufacturers is this: a tariff so high as to make importation\r\nruinous; when the home producer will raise his prices until they are\r\njust below the line of unprofitable inflation; which, from the context,\r\nwould seem to be the case in the Argentine. The consumer must suffer, and\r\nusually the _employé_.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1907 2,498,000 lb. of foreign refined sugar were imported, their value\r\nbeing £181,755; but on the other hand 140,370 lb. were exported during\r\nthe same year.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the price of sugar will not fall too low, as this\r\nmight bring about the ruin of an industry which is worth encouraging\r\nand preserving: but it is essential, on the other hand, to oppose an\r\nexcessive inflation, which would diminish the consumption of this\r\nvaluable alimentary product, and would force the consumer to pay the\r\nexaggerated profits of a small number of manufacturers and planters. This\r\nis the inherent peril of excessive protection.\r\n\r\nThe law of 23rd January 1904 and the regulation of 25th October of the\r\nsame year have provided for this condition. One must not forget that all\r\ncommerce is conditioned by the law of supply and demand, and that to\r\navoid overloading the market with produce, production must be limited,\r\naccording to circumstances, and in proportion to actual requirements; and\r\nbeyond the limit of absorption the productive energies of the country\r\nmust be diverted to other cultures or industries, more remunerative and\r\nmore certain as to results.[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: See the important work entitled _La Culture des Plantes\r\nIndustrielles dans la République Argentine_, by Carlos D. Girola,\r\npublished in the _Recensement de l’agriculture et de l’élevage de la\r\nNation_, Vol. 1. 1908, from which these data are extracted.]\r\n\r\nOf all the sugar sold in the Argentine, only part is refined; there is\r\nat present only one refinery[67] in the country; namely, the “Refineria\r\nArgentina” of Rosario. The greater proportion of Argentine sugar is\r\ndelivered to the consumer in the form of “moist” or brown sugar, which is\r\ngraded according to its colour and the care taken in its manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The thirty-two factories hitherto referred to would\r\npresumably be crushing-mills, where cane is crushed, the juice evaporated\r\ninto syrup or molasses and in some cases dried, the product being “raw”\r\nsugar.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThere are in several districts, and especially in the neighbourhood of\r\nMisionès, rudimentary factories where an impure sugar known as “rapadura”\r\nis prepared, which is sold in cubes or tablets. We have no precise data\r\nas to the production of the various grades of sugar.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twelve years the manufacture of sugar has been greatly\r\nimproved, as a consequence of the crisis through which the industry\r\npassed, which demonstrated the necessity of perfecting the methods of\r\npreparing and refining the “sap,” etc. To-day a yield is obtained of\r\n7-1/2, 8-1/2, and even 9 per cent. of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe capital sunk in the sugar industry in the Province of Tucuman amounts\r\nin round figures to £4,136,000, and is distributed as follows: Land,\r\n£1,232,000; plantations, £440,000; machinery, £1,496,000; buildings\r\n£968,000.\r\n\r\nIt will be as well to give some retrospective data here, which will show\r\nhow far the production of sugar has developed during the last few years.\r\nIn another chapter we shall deal with the production of sugar from the\r\nindustrial point of view.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1884 the harvest was 24,000 tons; in 1894, 75,000 tons; and in\r\n1895 it amounted to 109,000 tons, or an increase of 352 per cent. in\r\neleven years. In 1904 the yield was 134,000, or an increase of 360 per\r\ncent. over that of 1884. In 1905 it was 137,000 tons; in 1906, 180,000;\r\nin 1907, 113,000.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that the Argentine Republic underwent a crisis in the\r\nmatter of sugar, on account of excessive production; and that like other\r\nsugar-producing nations she has had to facilitate the export of the\r\nsurplus by granting a bounty to exportation.\r\n\r\nThis premium or bounty was conceded in the following manner: a law of\r\n1894 forced the producer to pay 6 centavos per kilogram, or ·576d. per\r\nlb. on manufactured sugar; but offered him a bounty of 16 centavos\r\nper kilogram——1·536d. per pound——on all sugar exported under certain\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThis law ceased to be in force on the 31st of December 1904; but\r\nwas replaced by another, of the 1st of January 1905, by which the\r\nmanufacturer who did not export 25 per cent. of the sugar he produced\r\npaid 15 centavos per kilogram——or 1·44d. per lb.——on a quarter of his\r\nproduce, or on the proportion which he did not export.\r\n\r\nThese two laws contain a radical difference. By the first, the State\r\nreceived 6 centavos per kilogram upon all sugar manufactured, of which\r\nit restored 4 centavos for each kilogram delivered for consumption, and\r\nthen restored 16 centavos for each kilogram exported; thus keeping to\r\na minimum tax of 2 centavos on sugar delivered for consumption. By the\r\nsecond law the State received nothing on sugar leaving the factory, as\r\nthe producer confined himself to giving an undertaking for the value\r\nof 15 centavos per kilogram on a quarter of his manufactures, which\r\nundertaking was returned to him if he exported a quarter of his produce;\r\nso that in case he did export his produce the State gained absolutely\r\nnothing. But according to a resolution on the part of the Government,\r\npassed in April 1905, the tax of 15 per cent. was suppressed, together\r\nwith the obligation of exporting a certain percentage of the sugar made.\r\nThe sugar industry thereupon entered upon a new period of absolute\r\nliberty, and at the same time was deprived of official protection.\r\nIn this matter the Argentine Republic acted in accordance with the\r\ninternational agreement of Brussels, which suppressed the sugar bounty.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of sugar during the eight years 1897-1904 was 780,000\r\ntons, or 97,000 tons per annum. This consumption has not actually been\r\nuniform; for instance, in 1897, about 80,000 tons were consumed; while in\r\n1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907, the figures were respectively about 115,000,\r\n162,000, 127,000, and 109,000 tons.\r\n\r\n_Vines._——Another important branch of agriculture in the Argentine is\r\nviticulture, which is more especially utilised in the Provinces of\r\nMendoza and San Juan. To give some idea of the development of this branch\r\nof agriculture we may state that in 1885 80,376 acres were planted with\r\nvines, while to-day the figure is over 139,000. Of this total 74,620\r\nacres are in Mendoza and 30,580 in San Juan. The different species of\r\ngrape are selected from the best to be found in cultivation in France and\r\nother vine-growing countries.\r\n\r\nThe vineyards have been laid out under favourable conditions, yet their\r\nproduct leaves something to be desired. Moreover, bad wines have often\r\nbeen put on the markets, sour wines, and wines adulterated with water,\r\nwhich have discredited the native wines, and have led many to doubt\r\nwhether the Argentine wine industry can ever really take root.\r\n\r\nThe factor which has chiefly contributed to this disastrous result is the\r\nlack of capital from which the industry suffers; the result being that\r\nthe processes of fermentation and maturing are not given sufficient time.\r\n\r\nPressed by their liabilities, the Argentine vine-growers hurry over\r\ntheir wine-making, so as to put their wares on the market as quickly as\r\npossible, in order to meet their engagements. The general result, apart\r\nfrom exceptions as honourable as few in number, is that the industry\r\nproduces decoctions of a kind, but not wines.\r\n\r\nDespite these unfortunate conditions the consumption of the wines of the\r\ncountry has reached a very considerable figure, which fact has greatly\r\ncontributed, thanks to very heavy customs duties, to the exclusion of\r\nforeign wines. In 1899, to go back no further, the total consumption of\r\nwine in the Republic was 322,431,166 pints, of which 237,600,000 pints\r\nwere of wines of the country, and 84,800,000 of foreign wines (not\r\nincluding those imported in bottles). In 1900 304,440,000 pints were\r\nconsumed; 221,760,000 of native wines and 82,680,000 of foreign wines. In\r\n1901, out of 327,360,000 pints, 242,880,000 were of native and 84,480,000\r\nof foreign wines; in 1904, of a consumption of 373,120,000 pints,\r\n307,000,000 were of native and 66,120,000 of foreign wines.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the total consumption of wines in the entire Republic, according\r\nto the office of National Statistics and Administration of Inland\r\nRevenue, amounted to 638,843,680 pints, of which 558,096,000 were of\r\nnative production and 100,747,680 were imported.\r\n\r\nThe production of native wines is limited, as we have seen, to wines for\r\ngeneral consumption. The finer varieties are imported.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of wines of quality in 1907 reveals a considerable\r\nincrease since the previous year; which is yet another proof in support\r\nof the many to be found in this book of the excellent economic and\r\ntherefore gastronomic conditions of the country. The large and profitable\r\nresults of the harvests enable the people to place fine wines upon their\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nThe customs, which are always a faithful barometer of the degree of\r\nwell-being which a people enjoys, afford us a proof of what we have\r\naffirmed. In 1907 there passed through the customs houses, coming from\r\nabroad, 59,520 dozens of bottles of champagne, 1988 dozens of sherry,\r\nplus 31,438 pints in the wood; 6925 dozens of port, plus 113,843 pints in\r\nthe wood; 516,520 dozens of vermouth; 27,624 dozens of semi-fine wines;\r\n1249 dozens of French clarets, and 8111 dozens of sparkling wines. The\r\n_vins ordinaire_ imported represented a total of 100,748,680 pints.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the area of the vineyards in existence at the\r\nend of 1907 was of 139,132,630 acres, their value being £18,400,000. As\r\nfor their yield, it amounted to 1,121,523,300 lbs. of grapes, or more\r\nthan 518,000 tons, with an estimated value of £3,680,000.\r\n\r\nThere are, in the Argentine Republic, 3097 establishments devoted to\r\nthe exploitation of the vineyards and the making of wine, disposing of\r\na total capital of some £4,320,000. Their products amount to 66,762,000\r\ngallons of wine, representing a value of £4,720,000.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the production of the Argentine with that of the principal\r\nnations of the two Americas, we obtain, for the year 1907, the following\r\ntable:——\r\n\r\n  Argentine Republic             556,096,000 pints\r\n  Chili                          475,200,000  ”\r\n  United States                  281,160,000  ”\r\n  Brazil                          56,320,000  ”\r\n  Peru                            17,248,000  ”\r\n  Uruguay                         16,192,000  ”\r\n  Bolivia                          5,576,000  ”\r\n  Mexico                           3,168,000  ”\r\n\r\nThe Argentine wine industry, in which millions have been engaged, is, as\r\nwe see, on the road of progress. It has to-day accomplished a rapid and\r\na very considerable development, which might well, in the near future,\r\neliminate the imported product from the market, at least in the case of\r\nwines for ordinary consumption.\r\n\r\nLike the sugar industry, the wine-growing industry has gone through\r\nits crisis. On the one hand the abuse made of credit in establishing\r\nwarehouses, cellars, and costly plant, and on the other defective methods\r\nof manufacture which brought the product into discredit, produced a\r\ndeep-rooted depression, from which the industry has hardly yet emerged.\r\nIt cannot look to the future until it perfects its means of preparation,\r\nworking out its brands with the aid of time and patience.\r\n\r\nThis industry, says an eminent writer, gives work to more than 100,000\r\ninhabitants, and represents, as a matter of national wealth, a value\r\nin vineyards and factories of some £19,000,000; it produces annually\r\n£4,840,000 worth of merchandise, contributes £6,950,000 to the general\r\ntrade, and surpasses in importance, both in the capital employed and\r\nin its products, the sugar industry of the country, which in 1907\r\nmanufactured sugar only to the value of £2,772,000.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: See _l’Industrie viti-vinicole de la République Argentine_,\r\nby Ricardo Palencia, an essay published in the _Recensement de\r\nl’agriculture et de l’élevage de la Nation_. Vol. I. Buenos Ayres.]\r\n\r\n_Tobacco._——For a long time the tobacco-plant has been cultivated in the\r\nArgentine; for we find, in various zones, conditions very favourable\r\nto its production; but its culture has by no means as yet acquired the\r\nimportance of which it is capable, and is very far from satisfying the\r\nneeds of national consumption.\r\n\r\nThe exports are insignificant: 37,983 lb. in 1906, and 16,612 lb. in\r\n1907, of the respective values of £539 and £226. The lack of care brought\r\nto the cultivation of the plant and to the preparation of the leaf,\r\ntogether with incomplete experience from the industrial point of view,\r\nhave contributed to check the increase of plantations, which ought to\r\noccupy a far larger area than they do.\r\n\r\nTobacco is grown chiefly in the northern region composed of the Provinces\r\nof Corrientès, Salta, and Tucuman; it is also grown to a less extent in\r\nthe Provinces and Territories of Misionès, Formosa, Chaco, Catamarca,\r\nLa Rioja, and Jujuy. It may be grown equally well in the central region\r\ncomposed of the Provinces of Buenos Ayres, Entre Rios, Santa Fé, and\r\nCórdoba; and even further south. There were formerly, and are still,\r\ntobacco plantations in the Province of Buenos Ayres, which appeared\r\nto promise a fair future for tobacco-planting; but all is as yet in a\r\nrudimentary condition, and the industry makes no appreciable progress.\r\n\r\nThe areas planted with tobacco in 1895 and 1907 were as follows:——\r\n\r\n                                               1895.     1907.\r\n                                              Acres.

As it has not been practicable\r\nfor us to verify these figures we must suppose that in 1895 there was not\r\nso large an area planted as the figures would lead us to believe.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: See _La Culture des Plantes industrielles dans la\r\nRépublique Argentine_, by Carlos D. Girola.]\r\n\r\n_The Mulberry._——The culture of the mulberry-tree should perhaps be\r\nincluded in that of industrial crops, since its leaves are the food of\r\nthe silkworm.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Spanish Conquest, says Carlos Girola, the engineer,\r\nour competent guide in the matter of industrial crops, the silkworm\r\nwas raised in the Province of Cuyo, and silk was woven there on the\r\nhand-loom; but, on account of the facilities of transport, imported silks\r\nbrought such a competition to bear upon the hand-made native article that\r\nthe silkworm industry gradually dwindled and finally became extinct.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments have of late years proved that the silkworm can be\r\nraised over a great part of the country; and that it has the best chances\r\nof development where the population is densest, labour most abundant,\r\nand the houses of the workers largest and most comfortable, as in the\r\nProvinces of Buenos Ayres (North) and Santa Fé, and in parts of Entre\r\nRios and Córdoba. So far, however, there is no demand for the native\r\ncocoons, and it is so difficult to place them that at present one cannot\r\nrecommend the silkworm industry except as an experiment or a speculation.\r\n\r\nThe mulberry-tree grows and flourishes excellently on the greater portion\r\nof the Argentine soil, and especially in the central and northern\r\ndistricts, where it springs up quickly and vigorously. It is greatly\r\nto be desired that it should be more widely cultivated, and that its\r\nwider cultivation should go hand in hand with the development of the\r\nsericultural industry, which in some countries constitutes one of the\r\nprincipal sources of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe mulberry also furnishes an excellent wood, and its leaves may be used\r\nto feed cattle as well as silkworms. Instead of planting trees which\r\nare of no industrial use, the mulberry should be given the place of\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n_Yerba Maté._——The “yerba maté,” or maté shrub, is met with in the woods\r\nof Misionès, where it grows in irregular clumps of varying extent. It has\r\nbeen known since the time of the Jesuits, who were the first to plant and\r\ncultivate it, as is proved by the plantations which to this day exist in\r\nthe territory of the Argentine Missions (Misionès). With the leaf of this\r\nplant infusions are made, as with tea, coffee, cocoa, etc. The matheine\r\ncontained in the leaves is possessed of properties at once tonic and\r\nstimulating.\r\n\r\nThe infusion of “yerba maté” is usually made in a receptacle shaped like\r\na pear with an orifice at the smaller end;[70] it is imbibed by means of\r\na silver tube having at one end a bulb pierced with holes, which performs\r\nthe office of a strainer, and is known as the _bombilla_. This method of\r\npreparation and of use is now tending to disappear; and maté is now often\r\nprepared in the same way as coffee, the result being a very refreshing\r\ndrink, very valuable in the country districts for the refreshment of\r\ntravellers. Statistics prove that the consumption of maté is continually\r\nincreasing; and as the national production is insufficient, recourse is\r\nhad to importation from Brazil and Paraguay. The amount of these imports\r\nfor 1907 was as follows:——\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Usually a gourd is used, of either spherical, ovoid, or\r\npear-like shape, with one end sliced off; it is commonly polished and\r\ncarved, often by Gauchos or Indians. Each drinker has his own gourd and\r\n_bombilla_, the latter being necessitated by the use of the leaf in the\r\nform of a powder.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n                                           Pounds.

There is thus a\r\nvast field of development for this branch of agriculture, especially in\r\nthe Territory of Misionès, which offers all the conditions favourable to\r\nthe culture of the plant.[71]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: See _La Culture des Plantes industrielles dans la\r\nRépublique Argentine_, by Carlos Girola.]\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these figures, and by the desire to replace the forests of\r\nilex, destroyed by improvident exploitation, attempts have been made to\r\ndevelop the culture of maté; and the first results appear to augur well\r\nfor the future of this undertaking.\r\n\r\nM. Thays, Director of the Parks and Promenades of Buenos Ayres, to whom\r\nwe owe the floral and arboreal embellishment of the Argentine metropolis,\r\nwas the first to overcome the obstacles to the artificial culture of the\r\nmaté shrubs from the seed.\r\n\r\nThe development of the plant is fairly rapid; the plucking of the leaves\r\nmay be commenced at the end of six years, and sometimes earlier: the\r\ntreatment necessary for its cultivation is very much that demanded by\r\nordinary orchard trees. Its longevity is great, and so far it is not\r\nknown to be subject to any disease.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of maté may spread beyond the Territory of Misionès, into\r\nthe favourable soil of Corrientès, Chaco, and Formosa; possibly into\r\nother parts of the northern and central regions; and it may give way to a\r\nmore intensive culture. M. Thays has obtained specimens of maté from seed\r\nin the Botanical Garden of Buenos Ayres, where he has grown it in the\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\n_Cotton._——Of the various territories of the Argentine, none lend\r\nthemselves so well as Chaco, Formosa, and Misionès to the cultivation of\r\nthe cotton-plant; not only by reason of their climatic conditions, but\r\nalso on account of the composition of their soil.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-plant is indigenous to the islands and sea-coasts of the\r\nTropics, and its geographical limits of cultivation, on either side of\r\nthe Equator, run to 40° of latitude in the north, and in the south to\r\nabout 30°, but never as far south as 35° or 40°, in spite of the probable\r\nsuitability of those latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe plant hardly suffers from the greatest heats of a tropical summer,\r\nwhile very cold weather interrupts its organic functions. It requires a\r\nhot, moist atmosphere for its development, but the moisture must not be\r\nexcessive, or the plant will grow too rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless thanks to these natural conditions that cotton-planting\r\nattained to a certain degree of development in the Territories of Chaco,\r\nFormosa, and Misionès as soon as the tillers of the soil became aware of\r\nits profitable nature.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this valuable textile is not, however, new to\r\nthis country. It was grown long ago, chiefly in Misionès, during the\r\nadministration of the Jesuit Fathers, who made from it cloth for their\r\nown use, and also for purposes of trade. But with the expulsion of\r\nthe members of the celebrated Company of Jesus, and the resulting\r\ndepopulation of the countryside, decadence overcame this branch of\r\nagriculture, and finally an almost total extinction, until to the people\r\nof the country it was no more than a memory.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1894, cotton was sown as an experiment in the Territory of\r\nFormosa; a few grains of the “Louisiana” and “Sea-Island” types, brought\r\nfrom the United States.\r\n\r\nThe results were excellent, and encouraged the sowing of larger areas.\r\nThere are now, in the various colonies founded in Chaco, which grow\r\npractically nothing but cotton, some 13,600 acres under cotton. It may\r\nto-day be asserted, says an official report, that Chaco is in the van\r\nof the Republic in the production of cotton; by reason of the area\r\nunder cultivation, the quantity of cotton picked at each harvest, and\r\nthe importance of its trade with the Buenos Ayres market.[72] In the\r\nshort space of two years, from March 1902 to March 1904, the exports\r\nfrom Barranqueras, the port of this region, amounted to 850,564 lb. of\r\ncotton and 286,831 lb. of cotton-seed. From this we may well augur,\r\nas the above-mentioned report asserts, that Chaco will become a great\r\ncotton-producing country, on condition that various refractory factors\r\nare eliminated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: See the notable monograph entitled: _Investigaciones\r\nalgodoneras en los territorios del Chaco, Formosa y Misionès, año 1904_,\r\nby the agronomical engineer, Fidel Macial Perez, upon whose data we have\r\ndrawn for this book.]\r\n\r\nThat the reader may form some idea of the future in store, during\r\nthe economic development of the Argentine, for the cultivation and\r\nexploitation of cotton, he need only refer to the following calculation\r\nas to its results. The land in Chaco given over to cotton yields, in good\r\nyears, an average crop per acre of 1785 lb. of cotton “in the pod”——that\r\nis, fibre and seed together. Selling the cotton at the very low price of\r\n·96d. per lb.——and the present price of cotton runs to 1·16d., 1·44d.,\r\nand 1·65d. per lb.——the minimum yield would be £7, 2s. per acre, even\r\nwith prices as low as we have indicated. As for working expenses, they do\r\nnot exceed £4, 5s. 6d. per acre, unless by some trifling sum, according\r\nto locality; so that the average profit would be about £2, 16s. per acre.\r\n\r\nThis is the cost of production of an acre planted with cotton during the\r\nfirst year. Later the expenses diminish by 25 per cent., so that the net\r\nprofit might reach £3, 11s. 3d. per acre.\r\n\r\nOne of the great obstacles in the way of the full development of this\r\nindustry is to be found in the lack of hands indispensable for the minute\r\nand delicate operations connected with gathering the crop. It has even\r\nhappened, during the last few years, that in certain districts as much as\r\n3s. 7d. per cwt. has been offered for selected cotton, and in others as\r\nmuch as a third of the results of the harvest. But we may be sure that\r\nwhen the native farmer and the foreign agriculturalist once awaken to the\r\nextraordinary profits which cotton yields, its production will assume a\r\nfar larger scale.\r\n\r\nAs the growers have to deal with an industrial branch of agriculture in\r\nprocess of establishment it has not yet been possible to draw from it all\r\nthe profit that is secured in other countries: cotton-seed, for example,\r\nin the United States especially, is a considerable source of wealth,\r\nbut in the Argentine the growers have scarcely begun to utilise it by\r\nthe extraction of its oil. But there is a beginning: several mills have\r\nlately been established for this purpose. The agronomic expert Macial has\r\njustly remarked that we only require spinning-mills and looms for the\r\ncycle of the cotton industry in Chaco to attain its completion.\r\n\r\n_Rubber._——Another source of forestal wealth in the Argentine, and one\r\nwhich is for the moment unexploited,——principally because of local\r\ndepopulation and a lack of means of transport——is the extraction of the\r\nrubber contained in certain tropical plants.\r\n\r\nLately, for example, competent observers have discovered that the true\r\nrubber-plant, the _Ficus elastica_, exists in abundance in the north-east\r\nof the Republic, and in the Provinces of Salta and Jujuy, between 23°\r\nand 26° of south latitude, and 62° and 66° of west longitude. It is this\r\ntree which has given such value to the Brazilian territory of Acre and to\r\nvarious other regions of Brazil.\r\n\r\nVarious plants yield rubber: one species, of a family known as\r\n“lecherones,” grows in the darkest and dampest parts of the forest;\r\nothers, called “heveas” in Brazil, are much thinner in the stem; and\r\nfinally there is a third kind, the “liane” or rubber vine.\r\n\r\nThe first variety, that of the “lecherones,” gives a yield of 17-1/2 to\r\n22 lbs. of gum per annum; there are forest lands containing as many as\r\n50,000 plants to the square league——over 5000 to the square mile——while\r\nthe poorest districts produce 2000 to the league. Considering the present\r\nhigh prices of rubber, we may obtain some idea of the great wealth of\r\nthis region. The method of exploitation is easy and simple; the country\r\nis indubitably healthy, and with labourers paid at the rate of 3s. 7d. to\r\n15s. 9d. a day a considerable profit would remain.\r\n\r\nTo-day men of initiative are busily seeking to exploit this new source\r\nof forestal wealth, which ought in time to become another centre of\r\nattraction to men and to capital.\r\n\r\n_Arboriculture._——There is another kind of culture which is destined in\r\nthe future, although at present it has only the smallest importance,\r\nto become an industry of considerable moment; the culture, namely,\r\nof orchard trees, of which we must mention the rapid progress. Given\r\nthe immense area of Argentine territory, endowed with the most varied\r\nclimates, from the snows of Tierra del Fuego to the semi-tropical heat of\r\nCorrientès and Jujuy; from the temperate warmth of the coast to the more\r\nrelaxing temperatures of the mountains of Córdoba or the Andean frontier,\r\nand containing land at all altitudes above the level of the sea, it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that all the fruit-bearing trees of the world can\r\nlive and flourish in the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn the northern region, and especially in Corrientès, Tucuman, Salta,\r\nLa Rioja, Catamarca, Jujuy, Formosa, Chaco, and Misionès, there are\r\nto-day groves of oranges, mandarins, lemons and limes of various kinds,\r\nfigs, and pomegranates. At Tucuman and Salta “chirimoyos” and “paltas”\r\nare cultivated. Almonds, olives, Barbary figs, ananas or bread-fruit,\r\nbananas and “guayabos” may also be grown in this region; but unhappily\r\nthe fruit-growing industry is at a standstill, on account of the lack\r\nof labour which is so great a difficulty in all departments of the\r\nindustrial and economic life of the Argentine.\r\n\r\nIn the central region we also find the mandarin or tangerine (in the\r\nnorth of Entre Rios and Santa Fé), lemons (in Entre Rios, Santa Fé,\r\nand Buenos Ayres), the grape-vine, especially in Mendoza and San Juan,\r\nand also in La Rioja, Salta, Catamarca, Córdoba, Santa Fé, Entre Rios,\r\nand Buenos Ayres. Peaches, prunes, apricots, cherries, apples, pears,\r\nquinces, medlars, and figs are grown in all these districts, and chiefly\r\nin the Province of Buenos Ayres, and the islands of the delta of the\r\nParana. In the same region we also find almonds, walnuts, hazel-nuts, and\r\nchestnuts, but grown on a small scale only. There is a fair production of\r\nlemons; and the olive grows well under favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the southern region there is no fruit grown, except on a few estates\r\nin the Rio Negro and in the valley of Chubut. Yet peaches, apricots,\r\nprunes, cherries, apples, and pears will flourish in certain localities;\r\nwhile walnuts, filberts and chestnuts might be grown on an enormous\r\nscale on the Andean slopes, where the rains are more frequent and the\r\natmosphere more humid.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, on account of the large profits made by those\r\nengaged in agriculture and stock-raising, and above all on account of the\r\ninsufficiency of the population, which is the prime cause of which we\r\nhave already spoken, the industry of fruit-farming has been practically\r\nignored, and what little has been undertaken has followed no definite\r\nplan, such as the careful selection of stocks and slips and saplings, the\r\npreparation of the soil, and the efficient protection of the trees. But\r\nin spite of all, very satisfactory results have been obtained, which have\r\nrevealed the fertility of the soil and the excellence of the climate.\r\n\r\nBut quite lately we have seen a remarkable development in this branch of\r\nagriculture, which seems to promise a fruit-growing industry comparable\r\nto that of other and more advanced countries than the Argentine. To-day,\r\naccording to Girola,[73] more care is expended upon the planting and\r\ncultivation of the trees, as the growers have acquired the conviction\r\nthat it is better to produce quality rather than quantity, and that\r\nfruit-growing demands, like other departments of agriculture, the careful\r\nselection of varieties at the time of planting; as well as incessant\r\nimprovement by means of careful grafting, and the application of special\r\nprocedures to the elimination of noxious insects, and the prevention of\r\nparasitic or other maladies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: See the chapter _Arbres Fruitiers_ in the _Investigation\r\nagricole_, by C. P. Girola, reproduced in the _Annales de la Société\r\nRurale Argentine_ for January-February 1905.]\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it follows that the fruit-farmer is gradually\r\nacquiring rational methods, which will soon attest to their beneficent\r\ninfluence by transforming the old orchard-plantations, which were with\r\nreason described as forests of fruit-trees, into gardens of carefully\r\ncultivated plants, yielding crops very greatly improved in the matter of\r\nquality and the beauty of the fruit. On the other hand, the sellers of\r\nfruit-trees have at the same time been learning more as to the qualities\r\nof different varieties, and how best to select them, in order to place on\r\nthe market those which will secure the largest profits to the grower, and\r\nto propagate the most popular species.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of fruit-trees is far from occupying its proper rank\r\namong Argentine industries. It is distributed in an irregular fashion;\r\nsome kinds of fruit-trees abound in certain districts and are rare\r\nor unknown in others; and it is impossible for growers in the latter\r\ndistricts to obtain them at profitable rates, on account of the\r\ndifficulty and scanty means of transport.\r\n\r\nAs for the fruit trade, it has hitherto been very limited, and confined\r\nalmost exclusively to the sale of fresh fruit, as with the exception\r\nof the factory of the “Tiger Packing Company” and a few others, which\r\nprepare canned peaches, etc., in syrup, all growers of fruit for public\r\nconsumption offer it for sale only in the fresh state.\r\n\r\nYet amid the feverish activity which characterises the present situation\r\nin the Argentine, the fruit trade receives a greater impulse each year;\r\nnot only in the matter of home consumption, which has been popularised\r\nby the aid of such companies as the “Co-operative Fruticola,” which\r\nendeavours to supply the consumer with articles of the first quality at\r\nreasonable prices, but also in the matter of export to large foreign\r\ncities. The export of fresh fruit should soon form an important branch of\r\ncommerce in the Argentine, as it does already in the United States and in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of a fresh-fruit trade with foreign countries the\r\nArgentine is particularly favoured by circumstances; for on account of\r\nher geographical position she is able to profit by the inversion of the\r\nseasons with regard to Europe; that is, by placing summer fruits on the\r\nEuropean markets in the middle of the northern winter. Another advantage\r\nwhich the Argentine will enjoy on these markets is the fact that she has\r\nto reckon with no formidable competitors; for those countries that might\r\ndispute her place, such as South Africa, which is situated in much the\r\nsame latitude, or Chili, which grows a variety of good fruit, have not\r\nthe abundant fertility of the Republic; or if they run her close in this\r\nrespect, as is the case with Chili, they are separated from Europe by a\r\ngreater distance, which considerably increases the price of transport.[74]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: And also of refrigeration; the fruit being “chilled,” that\r\nis, kept slightly above freezing point.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nProfiting by the admirable physical advantages of the country, once this\r\ntrade has obtained the indispensable assistance of rapid and convenient\r\nsteamers, with special holds or refrigerating chambers for the storage\r\nof large quantities of fresh fruit, we are certain that it will not have\r\nlong to wait for profitable results.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago one of the authors of this book sent to Messrs\r\nGarcia, Jacobs & Company, of London, as a commercial sample, a batch\r\nof peaches preserved by chilling, and according to the testimony of\r\nthese merchants the peaches of Buenos Ayres may well be the subject of\r\na successful business, provided that fruit of the superior varieties be\r\nproduced. Entering into detail, Messrs Garcia & Jacobs added that the\r\nbest qualities sent had sold satisfactorily; they ended by stating that\r\nconsignments reaching London in the months of March, April, and May\r\nshould yield considerable profits.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment many others were made by various persons, until\r\nfinally, thinking the moment had come for establishing the fruit trade\r\non a solid and lasting basis, the Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company\r\ndetermined to fit their steamers with special “chilled” chambers or holds\r\nfor the transport of fresh fruit.\r\n\r\nThe first consignments have not been completely satisfactory, as in this\r\ntrade, which is now being undertaken on a very large scale, every one\r\nhas a great deal to learn; from the producer, who plants the varieties\r\nof fruits which he thinks most suitable for export, the farm labourer,\r\nwho gathers the fruit, and the man who packs it in special cases, down to\r\nthe steamship company, which has to confide the care of the refrigerating\r\nplant and the holds to a competent technician, whose duty it is to\r\nmaintain a constant temperature, appropriate to each species of fruit.\r\nBut even under these still imperfect conditions the progress achieved has\r\nbeen very remarkable, and justifies our assertion that a large export\r\ntrade in fresh fruit is perfectly practicable.\r\n\r\nThe exhibitions of fruit which the Government of the Republic organises\r\nannually, with much practical good sense, have greatly helped to\r\nattract attention to the fruit-growing industry, and at the same time\r\nto stimulate competition and improvement. These exhibitions have been\r\na veritable revelation to everybody, for very few people suspected\r\nthat the Argentine produced so great a variety of the best species of\r\nfruit-bearing trees; or that she could rival other countries in the\r\nmatter of production.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-fruit trade is not, in the Argentine, as it is in the United\r\nStates, favoured by the existence of refrigerator cars, placed at the\r\ndisposal of the producers by the railway companies, and capable of\r\ntransporting enormous quantities of fruit from one end of the country to\r\nthe other. But this innovation, like so many others demanded by industry\r\nand commerce, will come in time, when the population has increased, and\r\nnew markets will be permanently opened to the producer. At the present\r\ntime such fruits as are intended for home consumption, like those\r\nselected for exportation, have not far to travel before reaching their\r\ndestination, as they are usually grown near Buenos Ayres; particularly\r\nthe peach, which is the fruit most in demand on account of its superior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nAlthough the entire Argentine territory lends itself admirably to the\r\nproduction of fruit, there are particular districts which by nature are\r\nespecially fitted for the plantation of fruit-trees. Among such districts\r\nwe may cite the islands which form the delta of the Parana, which are\r\ncovered with an extremely rich soil and magnificent growths, and are\r\nirrigated during certain seasons of the year by the waters of the river,\r\nwhich deposit on them a richly nutritious silt, like that which the\r\nfamous waters of the Nile leave upon its Egyptian banks. There flourish a\r\ngreat variety of fruit-trees, from peach and apricot, pear and apple, fig\r\nand quince, down to the “diospiro kaki,” and many other species.\r\n\r\nAnother region which has commenced to attract attention by reason of its\r\nmagnificent fruits is that of the Rio Colorado; it will one day be as\r\nfamous for its peaches and apricots as California is to-day. At a short\r\ndistance from Buenos Ayres is another favoured district, producing in\r\nespecial magnificent peaches; it is that of the village of Dolores, in\r\nthe Province of Buenos Ayres, whose exquisite fruits figure on the best\r\ntables of London and other European capitals.\r\n\r\nAs we see from these data, fruit-farming is making rapid progress in the\r\nArgentine: it may succeed in time in capturing not only the home markets,\r\nbut also the most important foreign markets.\r\n\r\nAs for the preparation of fresh fruit in syrup, as well as the\r\nmanufacture of dried fruits, both of them industries well developed\r\nin the United States, they still exist in the Argentine only in a\r\nrudimentary condition; but in view of the rapid progress achieved each\r\nyear in the Argentine, in this as in other industries, we may hope that\r\nthey will soon develop and establish themselves securely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART III\r\n\r\n                   THE ARGENTINE FROM THE COMMERCIAL\r\n                      AND INDUSTRIAL POINT OF VIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                             FOREIGN TRADE\r\n\r\nThe important part played by the foreign trade of the Argentine——\r\n    Table of imports and exports during recent years——Explanation\r\n    of their respective movements——Favourable condition of the\r\n    commercial balance.\r\n\r\nMethod of ascertaining the statistics of exports and imports——\r\n    Errors in evaluation——Notes on the import duties on various\r\n    articles——Variations of the customs duties——Export duties;\r\n    their transitory character——The trade in bullion.\r\n\r\nIMPORTS——Their classification according to their countries of\r\n    origin——Value of imports from each country, with indications of\r\n    the principal articles imported——The Argentine dependent upon\r\n    other countries for a large number of manufactured articles——\r\n    Concentration of imports at Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nEXPORTS——Their classification according to origin——Value of exports\r\n    from each district, with indications of the chief articles\r\n    exported——Decadence of the French trade with the Argentine and\r\n    its causes.\r\n\r\nTabulation, according to importance of the principal products\r\n    exported by the Argentine——Remarkable increase in agricultural\r\n    and pastoral exports——Search for new outlets.\r\n\r\nEventual denunciation of commercial treaties——Projected new treaty\r\n    with France——Causes of the superiority of English, German, and\r\n    North American trade in the Argentine over French trade.\r\n\r\n“Dumping” in the Argentine——A new client for the Argentine——Japan——\r\n    Elements which make for the development of commercial activity\r\n    in the Argentine.\r\n\r\nThe commercial balance——Results of the commercial balance——Its\r\n    prime importance in respect of the prosperity of the country——\r\n    It is this balance which compensates the issue of capital for\r\n    the benefit of the foreign debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole activity of the Argentine Republic is reflected in the\r\nstatistics of its external commerce, which gives the true measure of its\r\nprosperity. All the vital forces of the country, its river traffic-ways,\r\nits railways, its ports, its business centres, all aid in the development\r\nof the commercial movement, which lives only by means of international\r\nexchange. We have thus reached one of the most important points of our\r\nstudy: that from which we can best judge the place held by the Argentine\r\namong the great markets of the world.\r\n\r\nConsidered under its general aspect Argentine commerce may be summed\r\nup as follows: the exportation of raw materials and the importation of\r\nmanufactured articles. We mention exportation first by design; for it is\r\nthe exports, as we have already pointed out, that regulate the purchasing\r\npower of the country. There are no reserves in the Argentine which permit\r\nthe country to preserve its power of purchase much in excess of the\r\nmovement of capital produced by the sale of the harvest.\r\n\r\nThis situation cannot be clearly expressed in figures; for we can prove\r\nthat as late as 1891 the sum of imports was greatly in excess of that of\r\nexports. In normal periods one must, in fact, take into account a new\r\nfactor; namely, external credit, which allows the Argentine to increase\r\nher power of purchase above her actual resources. When, on the contrary,\r\na crisis arises, the imports rapidly follow the movement of the exports,\r\nthe country no longer being able to depend upon credit nor to cover by\r\nloans its unfavourable commercial balance.\r\n\r\nWe give below, taken from the publications of M. Latzina the statistics\r\nof foreign trade since 1861, which is the first year included in the\r\nofficial statistics.\r\n\r\nThe foreign trade of the Argentine has passed through two distinct\r\nphases; from 1861 to 1890 the imports were usually larger than the\r\nexports; while since 1891 the exports, except in 1893, have been\r\nconsiderably the larger.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that this reversal took place after the year\r\n1890; that is, after the financial crisis which so violently shook the\r\ncountry, and deprived it of that external credit which had hitherto\r\nbalanced the insufficiency of exportations. In 1891 the imports fell to\r\n£13,441,400, from £28,448,000, or a fall of more than 50 per cent. from\r\none year to the next. Thenceforward the imports progressively increased\r\nto £37,400,000 in 1904, varying by a few millions each year, while the\r\nexports reached their present high state of development through the\r\nprogress achieved by agriculture.\r\n\r\n                                                                Commercial\r\n  YEAR.

If we except\r\ncertain periods of exceptional importations, referring, for instance, to\r\nthe entry in bulk of large amounts of raw material for the construction\r\nof new railways, we see that the imports, as compared to the bulk of the\r\npopulation, represent from £5, 5s. to £7, 18s. 7d. per head, while the\r\nsame figure for exports is £7, 10s. 7d. to £10, 12s. 0d., according to\r\nthe condition of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIf we now examine the recent results of foreign trade, we find the\r\nsituation summed up by the following figures for 1908, as compared with\r\n1907, 1906, and 1905:——\r\n\r\n                         1908          1907          1906           1905\r\n\r\n  Exports            £73,201,068   £59,240,874   £58,450,766    £64,568,768\r\n  Imports             54,594,547    57,172,136    53,994,104     41,030,884\r\n                    ------------   -----------   -----------   -------------\r\n  Excess of Exports  £18,606,521    £2,068,738    £4,456,662    £23,537,884\r\n                    ============   ===========   ===========   =============\r\n\r\nThe commercial balance in 1908 was thus £18,606,521 in favour of the\r\nexports, as against £2,068,738 in 1907, £4,456,662 in 1906, which latter\r\nsum was £19,081,222 less than in 1905.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the exports for 1909 will prove\r\nto have been fully as large as the year before, for the recovery of\r\nthe wool market and the enormous maize harvest will have compensated\r\ncertain deficits in the matter of corn and cattle, which suffered in the\r\npreceding year from frost or drought.\r\n\r\nAs for the harvest of the current year, it is wiser not to say too much\r\nat present, as the lack of rain has deranged the sowing season.\r\n\r\nBefore commenting in any way upon the figures relating to foreign trade,\r\nwe must make one remark in respect of the method followed in making out\r\nour balance-sheets, etc. In the case of imports, the valuation of the\r\ncustoms is taken, and in the case of exports their current market price\r\nin gold. But this procedure has the demerit of yielding results which are\r\nnot in strict correspondence with reality; the most we can say is that\r\nthey enable us to make a strict comparison of one year with another.\r\n\r\nThe valuations according to the customs are from 20 to 30 per cent.\r\nabove the true values in the case of the majority of articles, and are\r\nsometimes merely fantastic.\r\n\r\nTo gain some idea of the disturbing factor which arises from the\r\ncalculation of imports upon the basis of customs estimates, which\r\nestimates are the basis of the figures of the National Statistics, we\r\nneed only take the figures relating to coffee as an example. In 1899 it\r\nwas valued at 30 centavos in gold; in 1900, at 20; and in 1902, at 12\r\ncentavos (7·2d., 4·8d., and 2d.). This decrease of over 5d. in three\r\nyears only enables one to judge of the instability of this rate of\r\nvaluation.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of the tariff paid by certain imports into the\r\nArgentine.\r\n\r\nThe 50 per cent. tariff strikes principally at the importation of\r\nwoven stuffs, carriages, harness, furniture, perfumery, ready-made\r\nunder-clothing, boots and shoes, hats, and similar articles not burdened\r\nby specific tariffs, for there is a host of articles which pays the\r\nentrance duty in this way. In practice this _ad valorem_ tariff of 50 per\r\ncent. frequently becomes a tariff of 100 per cent. or more, on account of\r\nthe arbitrary nature of the customs valuations.\r\n\r\nThe 45 per cent. tariff affects stockings, socks, etc., exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe 40 per cent. tariff affects bales of unbleached linen, all kinds of\r\ncotton cloth and calicoes, dressed leather, articles of lace made of pure\r\nsilk or silk mixtures, or of thread; woollen blankets, and blankets of\r\nwool with cotton warp, or bound or bordered; also laces and silk thread\r\nor thread of mixed silk and woven stuffs and any other articles of silk\r\nor silk mixtures, including floss silk, etc.\r\n\r\nThe 35 per cent. tariff applies to woollen stuffs in general, whether of\r\npure wool or mixtures.\r\n\r\nThe 25 per cent. tariff affects all merchandise not burdened by a special\r\ntax. That of 20 per cent. affects bar, strip and ribbon steel, and\r\nunbleached cotton cloths.\r\n\r\nThe 15 per cent. tariff affects oak, cedar, pine, spruce, and tissues of\r\nsilk intended for bolting flour. The 10 per cent. tariff affects certain\r\nchemical products, and also cocoa, tin, machinery in general, agave\r\nfibres, jute, and hemp fibre for making mats, etc. That of 5 per cent.\r\nwhich is the lowest, is imposed on turpentines, steel wire for fencing,\r\nploughs, jewellery, sulphur, cotton, whether raw or in the thread for\r\nindustrial purposes, sewing-thread, sacks, and other various articles.\r\n\r\nBesides the above there are some ninety-five articles or products on\r\nwhich specific duties are imposed.\r\n\r\nSince 1900 a legislative factor, at first sight unimportant, but in\r\npractice of the greatest advantage, has to a certain extent modified\r\nthe vexatious character of the Argentine tariff. This factor consists\r\nin the relative stability imposed by Congress on the customs law, by\r\nthe suppression of the annual revision to which the rate of valuation\r\nwas subjected, which change has allowed commerce to establish its\r\ntransactions on a definite basis; whereas they were formerly contingent\r\nupon the continual modifications of the said tariff. This step, like so\r\nmany others, was initiated by the ex-Minister, Señor José Maria Rosa.\r\n\r\nExaggerated values were always at the base of these tariffs, and the\r\nabuse became so notorious that the present Minister of Finance, Dr Terry,\r\nwas himself obliged to recognise “that reform was essential in the matter\r\nof the rectification of all these valuations, in order that the Customs\r\nAdministration should not strike indirectly at imported products by taxes\r\nfar in advance of those intended by the legislative power.” A new tariff\r\nhas been in force since the 1st of January 1905, and although it also has\r\ngiven rise to a certain degree of recrimination, it is none the less an\r\nimprovement upon the former state of affairs. As for the export duties,\r\nhere again we find notable discrepancies between the valuations and the\r\nmarket prices which ought, on principle, to serve as their basis. They\r\nwere established after the crisis of 1890, and as they were now no longer\r\njustified by insufficient resources, they were suppressed by Congress\r\nreckoning from 1906.\r\n\r\nThese customs duties on exported goods were established by the Argentine\r\nConstitution, but not in a permanent manner. The Charter enacted that\r\nthey should be in force up to 1866; but at that time, the country being\r\nat war with Paraguay, a Convention was convoked, which postponed the\r\nsettlement of the matter for some years.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the export duties were suppressed; but in 1900, after the\r\nterrible financial crash, they were once more established, in order to\r\nrelieve the heavy burdens and engagements of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThese duties were from 4 to 100 per cent. _ad valorem_, and were\r\nprincipally directed against leathers and hides, wool washed or unwashed,\r\nostrich plumes, tallow, fat, animal oil, horns, etc.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen by this simple enumeration, these duties weighed upon the\r\nby-products of stock-raising as they left the country for the markets\r\nof foreign consumers, and this after they had already been subjected to\r\nother heavy charges, in the shape of land taxes, customs duties on wire\r\nfor fencing, and many local taxes, while agricultural products escaped\r\nscot-free. For this reason it has always been considered that the export\r\ntariff had no equitable basis, and all the Argentine Administrations have\r\nfor this reason endeavoured to suppress it, as the Congress finally did\r\nin 1905. Whether we are dealing with exports or with imports we always\r\nfind, as we have seen, an inflation of prices on both sides, so that\r\nthe figures of the official statistics have not so much an actual as a\r\ncomparative value.\r\n\r\nThere is still one important item to be remarked in respect of imports:\r\nit is that the import duties in recent years have been first raised then\r\nlowered. Additional duties amounting to 10 per cent. were established\r\nwhen the dispute with Chili seemed about to end in war——that is, on\r\nthe 29th of January 1902——at which time a supertax of 5 per cent. was\r\nadded to the tariff which had already been in force since 1899. Since\r\nthen these duties have been finally suppressed (in January 1904). It is\r\nobvious that with these variations we have not always the same basis of\r\nvaluation, as the imports are variously affected by these variations\r\nthemselves, so that all exact comparisons are impossible.\r\n\r\nWe must also take into account the value of the imports which are not\r\ncontrolled by the customs. Competent persons have estimated that these\r\namount to about 20 per cent. of the goods passing through the customs,\r\nwhich represents a sum of about £2,000,000.\r\n\r\nAgain, the figures we have quoted do not include the movements of\r\ncurrency or bullion, which during the last six years have been as\r\nfollows:——\r\n\r\n  Year.

The imports from Germany, worth\r\n£7,569,417 in 1908, are of all kinds, and include almost every kind of\r\nproduct consumed by the Argentine. On account of her various industries,\r\nmetallurgical products holds the first place; then come woven fabrics and\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n_The United States_ send principally agricultural material, petroleum,\r\nand pine timber; the imports for 1908 were £7,119,400 in value; or\r\nnearly twice the value of the Argentine exports to the States. This\r\nsituation is explained by the fact that both countries export the same\r\nproducts——cereals and cattle, etc.\r\n\r\n_France_ comes fourth, with £5,295,385 worth of produce in 1908. Her\r\nproducts, like those of Germany, are very numerous in kind. The largest\r\nimports are of woven fabrics, wines and spirits, metallurgical products,\r\npharmaceutical specialities, and perfumery. Taking the item of wines\r\nand spirits alone, the Argentine imports £228,000 worth of bitters and\r\nvermouth and £202,560 worth of wines in the wood.\r\n\r\n_Italy_ sent £4,982,649 worth of imports in 1908. From Italy the\r\nArgentine imports the largest quantity of wines and of bitters, valued\r\nat £922,938; olive oil accounts for £394,133, rice for £295,667, cheese\r\nfor £181,949 (the weight of this import in 1907 being 2,274 tons); in\r\nshort, all the articles most in demand among the Italian emigrants. Woven\r\nfabrics attained a value of £927,857.\r\n\r\nFar below the countries already named, with an amount of produce less\r\nthan half that imported by France, comes _Belgium_ (£2,550,674 in 1908);\r\nthen _Brazil_ (£1,457,189), and _Spain_ (£1,723,622). Belgium sends\r\nprincipally metallurgical products; Spain her wines and oils and salt.\r\nBrazil sends only a dozen or so of products; the most important being\r\ncoffee, tobacco, and especially the yerba maté; a herb analogous to tea,\r\nand used as a beverage in the country districts. Brazil and Paraguay,\r\nwhich supply it to the Argentine, sent £1,046,183 worth of the herb in\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nThe table given below shows what are the principal products imported by\r\nthe Argentine Republic, and show the considerable increase which has\r\ntaken place in all branches of importation:——\r\n\r\n                                   1906.        1907.        1908.        1909.\r\n                                                                     (1st six months)\r\n\r\n  Alimentary products            £3,532,509   £4,183,187   £4,709,819   £2,226,053\r\n  Beverages                       2,358,808    2,526,748    2,655,956    1,155,965\r\n  Textile materials and fabrics  10,826,008    9,466,638    9,982,267    5,787,076\r\n  Mineral oils, and chemical   }\r\n    and pharmaceutical         }  3,092,766    3,254,653    4,048,175    2,174,871\r\n    products                   }\r\n  Woods, furniture, etc.          1,122,444    1,272,008    1,262,573      728,178\r\n  Iron, machines, materials,   }\r\n    implements, utensils, etc. }  6,988,461    6,632,228    6,015,097    3,401,912\r\n  Coal and other mineral produce  4,182,160    4,126,910    4,979,839    2,229,224\r\n  Various products[75]            21,890,946   25,709,763   20,960,820   10,544,272\r\n                                 ——————————   ——————————   ——————————   ——————————\r\n  Totals                         53,994,102   57,172,135   54,594,546   28,507,351\r\n                                 ==========   ==========   ==========   ==========\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Under this heading of various products are included railway\r\nmaterial——rails, chairs, locomotives, etc.——to the value of £4,672,486\r\nin 1905, £7,011,072 in 1906, £10,464,150 in 1907, £6,015,097 in 1908,\r\nand £3,401,912 during the first six months of 1909.

An essentially agricultural nation, she has\r\nnot as yet developed her industrial equipment, nor has she been able to\r\nundertake the transformation of the raw materials at her disposal into\r\nmanufactured products. The development of her agriculture is the object\r\nwhich has hitherto absorbed all the initiative and all the capital of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is this dependence upon foreign countries for so many articles of\r\nprime necessity that makes the cost of living in the Argentine so high.\r\nAll these articles have to pay customs dues varying from 5 to 50 per\r\ncent. _ad valorem_; dues which still further increase the exaggerated\r\nvaluations of the Customs Administration.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, these imports are by no means so decentralised as\r\nthe exports; they are brought as near as possible to the centres of\r\nconsumption, so that they shall not be forced to pay fresh freight dues\r\nin the interior. The Customs House of Buenos Ayres handles 84·9 per cent.\r\nof the imports; Rosario 9·2 per cent.; La Plata 1·9 per cent., and Bahia\r\nBlanca ·8 per cent. As we see by these figures, the Federal Capital\r\nalmost monopolises the imports, whence arises its disproportionate\r\ndevelopment as compared with the rest of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EXPORTS\r\n\r\nHere is the table of the exports of the last three years, arranged\r\naccording to their destination, in order of importance:——\r\n\r\n  DESTINATION.          1906         1907         1908         1909\r\n                                                           (1st six months)\r\n  Great Britain[76]    £8,644,807   10,743,230   15,644,944   10,207,653\r\n  France               7,152,671    7,552,409    5,782,750    4,761,514\r\n  Germany              7,883,439    7,284,611    6,950,399    4,280,523\r\n  Belgium              5,124,279    5,918,426    7,155,637    5,531,015\r\n  Brazil               2,378,263    2,803,686    3,019,115    1,729,824\r\n  United States        2,666,422    2,188,087    2,604,647    2,411,460\r\n  Italy                1,381,225    1,043,893    1,581,571    1,508,815\r\n  Holland                595,047      834,818    1,059,934      623,634\r\n  Spain                  514,515      387,121      519,920      248,823\r\n  Chili                  277,107      370,133      307,501      297,018\r\n  South Africa           791,606      303,118      172,088       24,662\r\n  Uruguay              1,006,880      275,328      154,891      112,329\r\n  Cuba                    49,478      144,896       57,891       42,046\r\n  Bolivia                 65,719      121,610      118,745       75,616\r\n  Paraguay                41,003       36,530       42,733       17,166\r\n  Other destinations     755,324      598,740      921,081      792,241\r\n  Shipments to order  19,122,949   19,252,891   27,085,119   17,710,457\r\n                      ——————————   ——————————   ——————————   ——————————\r\n                      58,450,766   59,240,874   73,201,068   50,354,688\r\n                      ==========   ==========   ==========   ==========\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: It should perhaps be explained that the totals are\r\ncorrectly converted from the Argentine values, but are not the exact\r\nsums of the columns of figures, as these latter are for economy of space\r\nprinted without the following decimals that result from conversion.

In 1907 she\r\nspent £3,739,509 on chilled meats; £1,843,954 on cereals——wheat, maize,\r\nand linseed; £1,212,471 on wools; £193,834 on butter, and £379,810 on\r\nsheepskins and cowhides, dried and salted. Australia also imports wheat\r\nand maize from the Argentine.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: These figures are for 1907 except where otherwise\r\nstated.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe export trade to England is still capable of a far greater expansion,\r\nif England will only determine to allow cattle on the hoof to be imported\r\nonce more; an import she denied herself some years ago, on account of\r\nanthrax, and one which the Argentine is eagerly begging her to resume,\r\nunder proper sanitary regulations.\r\n\r\nIt is England which has hitherto preserved the closest balance between\r\nher exports to and imports from the Argentine, and no other country\r\nhas so far been able to oust her from her dominant position in the\r\nArgentine foreign trade. From this we see that the ties which unite the\r\ntwo countries have nothing factitious about them; a fact which is still\r\nfurther emphasised by the statistics of English capital employed in the\r\nArgentine.\r\n\r\nGermany holds the second place, with her £6,950,399 of imports from\r\nthe Argentine (in 1908: £7,284,611 in 1907). After England, she is the\r\ngreatest consumer of Argentine wool; the exports of this product in 1907\r\namounted in value to £2,846,213. Other articles absorbed by Germany are\r\nhides (to the value of £1,045,417), and cereal products——wheat, maize,\r\nlinseed,and bran——(to the value of £1,013,426). The German imports from\r\nthe Argentine do not, however, include cattle or chilled meats.\r\n\r\n_France_, up to 1876, occupied the first place on the scale of Argentine\r\nexports. To-day her imports from the Argentine amount to £5,782,750\r\nonly (1908), or nearly £10,000,000 less than the English imports (in\r\n1907 they amounted to £7,552,409). Her purchases in the Argentine are\r\nconfined to a very few products, of which the chiefest is wool, the value\r\nof the export in 1907 being £4,908,510, or a little less than half the\r\nentire Argentine production. Then come hides, to the value of £1,508,764;\r\nthen linseed, maize, and wheat to the value of £309,956, £322,473, and\r\n£271,488 respectively, the whole imports from the Argentine in 1907 being\r\n£7,552,419.\r\n\r\nThe French system of Protection has so far stood in the way of the\r\ntrade in Argentine cereals, and has absolutely prohibited the entry of\r\nanimals or chilled meat. The interests of the French agriculturalists and\r\ncattle-breeders have hitherto come before the interest of the consumer,\r\nwhich is to obtain the products necessary to life in the cheapest market.\r\nBut overtures are being made, by the common agreement of both countries,\r\nwhich may eventually open the French market to Argentine meats, in return\r\nfor certain concessions granted to France, relative to the exportation of\r\nher own products——her wine, silks, woven fabrics, etc.\r\n\r\nThe marked and progressive decadence of the Franco-Argentine trade ought\r\nto rivet the attention of French capitalists and statesmen. Hitherto\r\nnumerous ties have connected France and the Argentine. The fundamental\r\ncode and the legislative system of the South American Republic have been\r\nimpregnated by the spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity proclaimed\r\nby the French Revolution. The Argentine mind is fed upon French\r\nthought, science, and literature. It is now, however, to be seen that\r\nthe intellectual influence of France is losing ground, as well as her\r\ncommercial influence, as to-day the sense of national fraternity is based\r\nupon solidarity of interest.\r\n\r\nNow the decadence of French trade with the Argentine is truly alarming.\r\nIf we consult the publications of the National Department of Statistics,\r\nwe find, for instance, that in the thirty-one years from 1876 to 1907\r\nthe German exports to the Argentine have increased by 2450 per cent.;\r\nthe Belgian, by 1002 per cent.; those from the United States by 1898 per\r\ncent.; Italian exports by 907 per cent.; English by 992 per cent.; but\r\nFrench exports have increased only by 204 per cent.\r\n\r\nCompared with other nations, France has least been able to hold her own\r\nin the matter of trade with the Argentine. In 1876 the importations from\r\nFrance formed 23·2 per cent. of the total imports; while in 1908 they\r\nformed only 9·9 per cent. of the totals, making a proportional diminution\r\nof 13·3 per cent. in thirty-two years. Our imports from England,\r\nhowever, which in 1876 were 24·9 per cent. of the total, had increased to\r\n34 per cent. by 1908; representing a proportional increase of 9 per cent.\r\n\r\nWe are thus justified in concluding that all our efforts to develop\r\nthe current of Franco-Argentine exchange will contribute powerfully to\r\nfortify the influence of France, and the sense of confraternity between\r\nthe two Latin nations.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the decay of the French trade have been recapitulated in an\r\nofficial document despatched in 1904 by the French Chamber of Commerce in\r\nBuenos Ayres to the Minister of Commerce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese causes may be summarised as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. The exaggerated duties to which many of our products are\r\n    subjected on entering the Argentine.\r\n\r\n    2. The competition of local industry with the imports of\r\n    certain products.\r\n\r\n    3. The dearness of labour in France, and the consequent cost\r\n    of manufacture, which in many cases no longer permits us to\r\n    struggle against our competitors.[78]\r\n\r\n    4. The imperfection of our equipment for making certain\r\n    articles.\r\n\r\n    5. The persistence of our manufacturers in disregarding the\r\n    tastes of their _clientèle_.\r\n\r\n    6. The insufficiency of the credit granted by French\r\n    manufacturers and merchants as compared with those of other\r\n    competing countries.\r\n\r\n    7. The frequent lack of technical knowledge on the part of\r\n    foreign commercial travellers; a lack which almost always\r\n    prevents them from benefiting as they should from direct\r\n    contact with their customers.\r\n\r\n    8. Finally, in the matter of navigation, the expensive\r\n    character of our vessels, and the resulting dearness of\r\n    freight.[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: The case of France is especially interesting, because\r\nher tendency is towards self-sufficiency——the reverse of the policy of\r\nnearly all other countries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: See _Rapport à M. le Ministre du Commerce sur les causes\r\nde la diminution du commerce française dans la République Argentine_,\r\n1904.]\r\n\r\n_Belgium_ imports some £5,918,426 worth of produce from the Argentine\r\n(£7,155,637 in 1908). She receives much the same articles as Germany:\r\n£1,456,196 worth of wool, and £2,285,174 worth of cereals, of which\r\n£1,551,228 goes for wheat. We find a new item figuring in the Belgian\r\nimports——extract of beef——to the value of £173,885; this extract is made\r\nby Kemmerichs, the rivals of Liebigs, who manufacture their extract on\r\nthe Uruguay.\r\n\r\nOf late years the Argentine has gained a new client——_South Africa_.\r\nDuring the Boer war an extensive export trade sprang up, in live animals,\r\nchilled meats, and cereals, and this trade has been maintained. The value\r\nof the exports to South Africa in 1908 was £172,088 (£303,418 in 1907.)\r\n\r\n_Brazil_ also imports alimentary products from the Argentine: cereals,\r\nand especially wheat and flour. The value of the exports to Brazil\r\nin 1908 was £3,019,115. Between the two principal countries of South\r\nAmerica——Brazil and the Argentine——economic relations are promoted by\r\nconvenience; Brazil furnishing the produce of its prosperous and varied\r\nforms of agriculture——coffee, yerba maté, tobacco, etc.——in exchange for\r\nArgentine cereals and cattle.\r\n\r\nIn North America, on the contrary, the Argentine finds few outlets for\r\nits products, as the two countries have almost the same products. The\r\nexports to the United States were £2,188,087 in value in 1907; £2,604,647\r\nin 1908; consisting almost entirely of hides, wool, and extract of\r\nquebracho for tanning; while, as we have seen, the exports of the United\r\nStates to the Argentine reach the value of £7,100,000.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Government has given much thought to the disadvantages of\r\nthis commercial situation; it has sought means to remedy it, but so far\r\nhas adopted no practical measures. It has also endeavoured to conclude a\r\ncommercial agreement with Brazil, but without success, because in South\r\nAmerican states questions of race-antagonism often give rise to the\r\ngravest problems. This fact also explains why the attempts to establish a\r\ncommercial treaty have so far failed.\r\n\r\nIn his last message, however, the President of the Republic admitted\r\nthat negotiations were in progress with a view to opening up new markets\r\nand to increase the mutual trade of the Argentine and other countries. He\r\neven announced that a commercial treaty with Chili was almost completed.\r\nOn the other hand, as arbitration treaties have just been concluded with\r\nBrazil and the United States, we may infer that these countries are not\r\nsystematically opposed to any understanding with the Argentine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHolding positions far inferior to the foregoing countries are: _Italy_,\r\nwhich in 1908 received £1,581,571 worth of Argentine products,\r\nprincipally maize and hides; _Holland_ receiving £1,059,394 worth of\r\nimports, comprising linseed and cereals (maize and wheat); _Uruguay_,\r\nimporting live-stock, meat, sugar, hides, etc., to the value of £154,891\r\nin 1907 (£275,328 in 1908); _Spain_, importing maize, hides, and fats to\r\nthe value of £387,121 in 1907 (£519,920 in 1908); and _Chili_, importing\r\nArgentine produce to the value of £370,133 in 1907 (£307,501 in 1908),\r\nconsisting entirely of cattle and mules.\r\n\r\nFinally we must mention _Austro-Hungary_, although that country has very\r\nlittle commercial contact with the Argentine. The imports from Austria\r\nand Hungary amount to some £500,000 or £600,000 (£578,932 in 1907,\r\n£658,700 in 1908), and the Argentine exports, principally wheat, amounted\r\nto a value of £150,395 in 1907, and £214,227 in 1908.\r\n\r\nOne department of the foreign trade of the Argentine cannot be\r\nprecisely classified; namely, that of the products which are loaded on\r\nvessels which make seawards, and those which, coming from the river\r\ncustom-houses, are transported to Buenos Ayres, there to be transhipped\r\nfor foreign countries. The value of such exports was £19,252,891, in\r\n1907, and £27,085,119 in 1908. This sum includes the value (£18,654,153\r\nin 1907) of agricultural products, wheat and maize, despatched to order\r\nbut without exact destination, whether to Saint Vincent in the Cape Verde\r\nIslands, Las Palmas in the Canaries, or Falmouth in England.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows, in the order of their importance, the products\r\nexported by the Argentine during the three years 1906-1908 and the first\r\nsix months of 1909, so that we may see at a glance what branches of\r\nproduction have most rapidly increased:\r\n\r\n                                 1906.         1907.         1908.         1909.\r\n                                                                      (1st six months)\r\n  Products of Stock-raising   £24,827,397   £24,764,041   £23,023,691   £16,213,533\r\n  Products of Agriculture[80]   31,530,938    32,818,324    48,335,432    32,986,430\r\n  Forestal products             1,184,372     1,068,471     1,269,447       794,772\r\n  Various                         908,168       590,037       272,497       359,952\r\n                              -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------\r\n               Totals         £58,450,875   £59,240,873   £72,921,067   £50,354,687\r\n                              -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: The agricultural exports for 1906 wore sensibly lower than\r\nthose of 1905, on account of a decrease of £3,864,392 in the exports of\r\nwheat.]\r\n\r\nWe see that agricultural products were responsible for the enormous\r\nincrease in the trade statistics of 1908. They represented 66 per cent.\r\nof the total exports, and had increased nearly 50 per cent. in one year.\r\nThe products of stock-raising have not increased; on the contrary, there\r\nis a falling off of more than £5,000,000 between 1905 and 1908, the value\r\nin 1905 being £28,208,597.\r\n\r\nWe see from the preceding data how greatly agriculture has developed\r\nin the Argentine during the last few years. To realise precisely how\r\ngreat this development has been, we need only recall the fact that the\r\nexportation of corn is now 10,000 times greater than it was thirty years\r\nago: maize has increased by 800 per cent.; fodder, by 80 per cent.:\r\nlinseed, by 70,000 per cent.; flour more than 600 per cent.[81] These\r\nfigures show how rapid the growth of the Argentine has been, and what\r\nprogress has been realised in spite of temporary crises.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Latzina, work already cited, p. 510.]\r\n\r\nIf we now consider the progress of external trade, not from year to\r\nyear and in detail but as a whole, and over a large period, we can no\r\nlonger doubt that this trade is destined to accomplish still greater\r\ndevelopment. Importation too, the field for which is somewhat restricted,\r\nmay also realise a greater progress as the population increases. Again,\r\nonce the Argentine develops her industries with greater energy, it is\r\nonly natural that larger quantities of raw material will be imported, to\r\nbe transformed into manufactured articles.\r\n\r\nAs for the increase of exports, we have only to turn to the data already\r\ngiven concerning the annual increase in the area of sown land, and the\r\nimportance of those lands which have yet to reach their true value,\r\nbut will do so as soon as the stream of immigration supplies them with\r\nsettlers and colonists.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the creation of a network of economical light railways, and the\r\nopening of new ports on the great rivers, will give the export trade new\r\nfacilities, which will naturally result in an increased trade.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this book we remarked that there was still an\r\nunknown factor in the future of the foreign trade of the Argentine.\r\nNow there is, in the Presidential Message, an allusion to the eventual\r\ntermination of the commercial treaties with the principal nations, with\r\nthe intention of suppressing the “most favoured nation” clause, and of\r\nopening up direct negotiations.\r\n\r\nVery fortunately this measure has had no practical consequences, for the\r\nrevision of treaties is a delicate piece of work for a nation essentially\r\ntributary to the foreigner, if one wishes to avoid the risk of provoking\r\nreactions which might compromise the results already obtained.\r\n\r\nThis “most favoured nation” clause, which the Republic inserts in all its\r\ntreaties, has, for the rest, by no means impeded the enormous expansion\r\nof the Argentine export trade which we have already noted. We must\r\nconclude that the termination of commercial treaties, with the object\r\nof effacing this clause, has become, even in the case of distinguished\r\nstatesmen, a continual obsession, although it is justified by no decisive\r\nargument, and might well expose the country to dangerous vicissitudes.[82]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: One may with profit consult a notable report on _La\r\nclause de la nation la plus favorisées_, presented to the Minister of\r\nAgriculture by the Divisional Chief, Richard Pillado.]\r\n\r\nOn certain points, however, the customs laws of the Republic might well\r\nbe revised in such a way as to stimulate foreign trade.\r\n\r\nThus with regard to France official negotiations have already been\r\nopened, with the object of affording the Argentine certain facilities\r\nin the introduction of her chilled meats; while in return French wines\r\nand woven fabrics, etc., were to be given a preferential treatment. Just\r\nas the basis of this arrangement appears, we have as yet no reason to\r\nsuppose that it will be ratified by the two nations concerned, or that it\r\nwill soon be put into execution.\r\n\r\nTaking a more general point of view, we are obliged to admit that if\r\nFrench commerce, and especially French industry, have not won the place\r\nwhich should be theirs in the Argentine Republic, when we consider the\r\nmagnitude of Argentine exportation to France, it is because French men\r\nof business and manufacturers have started from a false principle, from\r\nwhose consequences they and the Argentine are still suffering. Instead\r\nof following up the rapid evolution of the Argentine, the French have\r\npersisted in regarding it, from afar off, as a nation scarcely yet open\r\nto civilisation and progress. They used to seek to get rid of remainders,\r\nold-fashioned articles, and out-of-date equipments in the Argentine,\r\nas they do to-day in China and Africa. Such railways as are built with\r\nFrench material are an example of this practice; their installation\r\nleft much to be desired, and it is only lately that they have made some\r\nefforts to support comparison with other lines.\r\n\r\nThe English, Germans, and Americans of the States were better advised.\r\nHaving studied with greater care the country and its tendencies, they\r\nwere able to initiate it into the paths of material progress. Those\r\nrailways which were built by English contractors or companies are models\r\nof perfect adaptation to the needs of the country. The equipment of the\r\ntramways, furnished by the United States, may be compared with that of\r\nthe principal capitals of Europe. In the matter of electric lighting the\r\ngreat German companies have installed the best German plant.\r\n\r\nThe same observations may be made of a large number of other products\r\nimported from abroad. There is nothing better in the United States in the\r\nmatter of agricultural equipment than that possessed by the Argentine; as\r\nfor stock-raising, we have only to remember that it is to South America\r\nthat England sends her best bulls, rams, and stallions.\r\n\r\nBut from these remarks it must not be concluded that the Argentine\r\nhas bought too dearly the glory of an equipment which is modern as\r\ncompared with that of the old European nations. Of late years it is\r\nrather the reverse that has been true. The leading industrial countries,\r\nbeing anxious to sell off their stock on account of an almost general\r\nover-production, have been propelled towards the markets of exportation\r\nin order to get rid of their surplus. From this has resulted a\r\ncompetition from which the Argentine has in many cases profited, by\r\nobtaining industrial products under particularly advantageous conditions.\r\nSuch has been the case in the matter, for example, of rails; the German\r\ntrade offered them at £4, 16s. per ton, at a time when the European\r\nprices were considerably higher; Germany, however, was supplanted by the\r\nfactories of the United States, which supplied them at £2, 8s. per ton.\r\nThis is an application of the new economic process known as _dumping_,\r\nwhich consists in developing production as far as possible, in order\r\nto lower the net cost of production, and then to sell at this net cost\r\nprice, in foreign markets, all that the producing country fails to absorb.\r\n\r\nAll the nations we have cited are the actual consumers of Argentine\r\nproducts; but it is to be hoped that yet other markets will be opened,\r\nattracted by the abundance and the quality of these products.\r\n\r\nAmong these countries disposed to trade with the Argentine we must\r\nmention the Japanese Empire, which is endeavouring to develop its trade\r\nupon a reciprocal basis, and has sent a commission of delegates to Buenos\r\nAyres, who were instructed to obtain complete and practical data as to\r\nthe possibility of establishing a mutual trade with the young South\r\nAmerican nation.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese commissioners have accomplished their trade with the earnest\r\napplication characteristic of their countrymen, and after studying the\r\nquestion for more than a year they have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nmany Argentine products, and among them wools, hides, and flour, might\r\nfind an extensive outlet in Japan; but only if imported free from the\r\nexpenses imposed by the European middleman.\r\n\r\nPursuing their investigations, the Japanese Commissioners discovered\r\nthat the great difficulty in the way of a direct trade between the\r\nArgentine and Japan consists in the fact that there is no direct line\r\nof steamers; but this obstacle might be overcome by an arrangement with\r\nthe Toyo-Yusen-Kaisha Company, which would establish a direct service to\r\nBuenos Ayres _via_ Cape Town in forty-five days; at present the voyage\r\ntakes seventy days. This arrangement would lead to a reduction of 75 per\r\ncent. on the freights.\r\n\r\nFlattering, however, as the prospects of this new market may seem,\r\nthere is one item in the plan of the Japanese Government which gives\r\nrise to considerable reflection on the part of our Argentine statesmen:\r\nnamely, the proposal to introduce Japanese agricultural immigrants into\r\nthe Argentine; that is, immigrants whose presence would in many ways\r\nbe inconvenient; against whose presence the United States and other\r\ncountries have reacted, and whose very presence in the Argentine would be\r\ncontrary to the sense of the Argentine Constitution, which imposes upon\r\nCongress the duty of encouraging _European_ immigration.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this study of the foreign trade of the Argentine Republic\r\nand its remarkable development, we cannot do better than quote the\r\nenthusiastic words by which an Argentine statesman terminated a study of\r\nthe same question, thus summarising all the various elements which concur\r\nin the development of the commercial activity of the nation:\r\n\r\n“Despite the scanty population, and the small proportion of our\r\nagricultural resources which has as yet been exploited, the production\r\nof the Argentine is considerable. The herds grazing in our pastures show\r\nthe state of progress which stock-raising has attained; the harvests\r\nwhich cover the plains of Santa Fé and Buenos Ayres have made the name\r\nof the Argentine Republic known on the markets of Europe as that of a\r\nflourishing agricultural country; sugar, the product of the cane-fields\r\nof Tucuman, has enriched that Province and the national industry, and\r\nvery shortly the vines grown in the valleys of the old Province of Cuyo\r\nwill achieve a yet wider development, and will give still more abundant\r\nvintages.\r\n\r\n“The smoke-stacks of manufacturers overlook many of the cities of the\r\nRepublic, and certain native products are now being transformed, as raw\r\nmaterial, into finished articles by the nation’s labour. Industries based\r\nupon the vitality of our production, and supported by the public powers\r\nsolely in a rational and equitable degree, are developing themselves\r\nwithout being forced to resort to the exaggerated and always mistaken\r\nassistance of an excessive protectionism. In short, our foreign trade,\r\nupon whose promising results we have already commented, will in its turn\r\nfortify the economic organism, which is the basis of the welfare and the\r\npower of nations.”[83]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: See _Memoria del Departamento de Hacienda_, by T. M. Rosa,\r\n1899, vol. i., p. 170.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE COMMERCIAL BALANCE\r\n\r\nIn a country like the Argentine, which has no accumulated reserves, and\r\nhas not become the creditor of foreign countries by investing its capital\r\nabroad, a favourable commercial balance (that is to say, the realisation\r\nof an excess of exports over imports) is a matter of considerable\r\nimportance. Now this excess was £18,600,000 in 1908; a record, if we omit\r\n1905, which proves clearly that the Argentine has entered upon a period\r\nof exceptional prosperity from the economic point of view.\r\n\r\nTo understand the full significance of this commercial balance, we must\r\nbear in mind the financial situation of the Argentine, which has a\r\nforeign debt of £74,200,000, demanding a yearly interest of £3,907,200,\r\npayable, of course, in gold. In order, then, that the country may be able\r\nto keep its engagements, the total value of its exports must cover the\r\namount due on the year’s imports and must also cover the interest to be\r\npaid on the foreign debt, the dividends earned by the railway companies,\r\netc., and the expenses of maritime transport.\r\n\r\nAll that we have considered up to the present shows that the productive\r\ncapacity of the Argentine is limited to the results of agriculture and\r\nstock-raising. With the exception of these two elements we may say\r\nthat the country produces nothing, transforms nothing. Industry is as\r\nyet in its infancy; internal trade is undeveloped; the mercantile\r\nmarine is of no importance. For this reason the Argentine must perforce\r\nemploy the results of its agricultural exportation in procuring what\r\nit lacks——objects of prime necessity, or raw materials of all kinds.\r\nWe can thus understand what an influence a change for the worse in the\r\ncommercial balance may exercise on the destinies of the country. If there\r\nis a bad harvest the deficit must somehow be made up; and as Argentina\r\nhas not as yet saved enough capital to allow her to live on her own\r\nreserve funds, it is at such times that a loan becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nThus each bad harvest helps to increase the foreign debt, to say nothing\r\nof the financial disturbances which it may create.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why, after a certain number of years of abundant\r\nharvests, the Argentine has not as yet established this financial\r\nreserve, which would serve to lessen the blow of a bad agricultural year,\r\nand compensate the deficient exportation of a year of lean cattle. The\r\nanswer will be found in the figures which we print further on, relating\r\nto the amount of foreign capital invested in the Argentine; in Government\r\nbonds, shares in railway companies, or other undertakings, public or\r\nprivate. According to our estimate, this sum amounts approximately to\r\n£317,200,000, representing an annual drain of £18,400,000 in the shape of\r\ninterest, dividends, or redemption money. This is assuredly the outlet\r\nby which much of the country’s savings escape, for we may truly say that\r\nthe Argentine, which is in a sense so much international territory, works\r\nmore for other countries than for itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, as we shall see, this exodus of capital takes place also by other\r\nmeans; notably by the emigration of those natives or foreigners who\r\nleave the Argentine to settle in Europe. It is not rare, among Argentine\r\nfamilies, to see certain members, having made their fortunes, emigrate to\r\nenjoy their incomes under other skies. This applies yet more frequently\r\nto foreigners. The Italian, for example (and more Italians come to the\r\nArgentine than natives of any other country), the Italian is given to\r\ntransforming his savings into money of his own country; either with a\r\nview to returning, or because he cannot on the spot find security or\r\nfacility for the accumulation of personal property.\r\n\r\nSo at the present time there are two distinct movements of capital; two\r\nmovements of contrary direction and absolutely distinct. Firstly, money\r\nflows into the country in payment of exports; secondly, money flows\r\nout of the country in payment of imports; and also in consideration of\r\nforeign capital invested in the Argentine. From these two movements,\r\nin times of prosperity, a third movement arises; a movement which\r\nbrings foreign capital into the Argentine, where it finds employment in\r\nimportant undertakings, due to Governmental or to private initiative. But\r\nalthough this influx of capital may mean further national progress, it\r\ndoes not permanently affect the commercial balance of the country, as the\r\nrevenue deriving from it benefits the foreigner.\r\n\r\nWhatever point of view we assume, we must always arrive at the same\r\nconclusion; that the whole economic life of the Republic depends upon its\r\nagricultural exports; its commercial balance has no other counter-weight\r\nto help it to overcome the burden of debts contracted abroad by the\r\nimportation of merchandise or of capital. For ten years now the sense of\r\nthis commercial balance has been constantly in favour of the exports,\r\nand there has even been a remarkable progress, scarcely interrupted at\r\ncritical moments. But ten years is only a brief period in the life of a\r\npeople; and however favourable the future outlook may appear, we must\r\nalways be prepared for a possible deficit, for a minus balance, as the\r\nresult of a bad harvest or some grave political crisis. These, in a\r\ncountry without reserves of capital, are contingencies of which we must\r\nnever lose sight, and which force us to express our appreciation of the\r\nfinancial or economic system of the Argentine with a certain reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                     THE GREAT ARGENTINE INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nThe principal industries of the country are related to agriculture\r\n    and cattle-breeding.\r\n\r\nSUGAR-PLANTING, BOILING, etc.——Capital engaged——Tucuman the chief\r\n    centre——Production and exportation——The sugar crisis——The\r\n    Rosario Refinery.\r\n\r\nFLOUR EXPORT TRADE——Capital invested——Equipment, steam flour-mills,\r\n    grain-elevators——Production and exportation.\r\n\r\nREFRIGERATION——At present the chief industry of the country——Number\r\n    of establishments——Table of exports of frozen and chilled\r\n    meats——Capital invested——Development of the industry.\r\n\r\nDAIRY INDUSTRIES——The large establishments devoting themselves\r\n    to these industries——Butter; cheese——Exports of butter; the\r\n    development of which the dairy industries are capable.\r\n\r\nBREWERIES——Chief establishments——Production and consumption of beer\r\n    during the years 1902-1907——Suppression of imports of foreign\r\n    beer.\r\n\r\nSPIRITS——Decreased production of spirits.\r\n\r\nLOOMS, TANNERIES——Weaving and tanning are industries which\r\n    at present exist in the Argentine only in a rudimentary\r\n    condition, despite the conditions which are favourable to their\r\n    development.\r\n\r\nQUEBRACHO WOOD——The centre of production——Applications——Companies\r\n    engaged in the industry——Their results——Value of the products\r\n    and the large profits to be expected.\r\n\r\nTIMBER TRADE——Varieties of timber and hard woods.\r\n\r\nFISHERIES——First results of this industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industry of the Argentine Republic is more or less independent upon\r\nits agriculture and stock-raising, which contribute the raw materials for\r\nthe manufacture of various alimentary products. Among those industries\r\nwhich are thus dependent on the produce of the soil we must mention,\r\nas the more important, sugar-boiling, flour-milling, the chilled-meat\r\nindustry, the making of butter, cheese, and oil, brewing, and distilling.\r\n\r\nBesides these industries, the majority of which are flourishing and\r\nsuffice for the needs of the country, we must mention others which\r\nare still in a rudimentary state, but which seem to have an assured\r\nfuture, on account of the abundance of raw material; namely, the weaving\r\nof woollen and cotton fabrics, and the preparation of leathers. We\r\nshall therefore have occasion to remark upon the conditions of their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n_Sugar Factories._——The sugar industry has fairly remote antecedents in\r\nthe Argentine. Dr Latzina traces it back to the Jesuits; the inventory of\r\ntheir goods, drawn up at the time of their expulsion in 1767, proving the\r\nexistence of a field of cane and a sugar-mill.\r\n\r\nDespite its respectable antiquity, the sugar industry only began to be\r\nof significance towards the middle of the nineteenth century, at which\r\ntime it was established in Tucuman, whose soil appeared to be favourable\r\nto the cultivation of the cane. Since then it has developed gradually,\r\nbut it is only during the last ten years that it has spread to any\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\nWe have given the details of this development, together with figures, in\r\nthe chapter dealing with the industrial branches of agriculture, in which\r\nwe spoke of the laws affecting this industry.\r\n\r\nTo-day the number of sugar-mills or factories is thirty-one; they belong\r\nto limited companies or to private persons, and represent a total capital\r\nof £4,224,000, to which sum we must add another of £2,640,000 as the\r\nvalue of some 160,200 acres planted with cane, at the rate of £16 to\r\n£17 per acre, and £369,600 as the value of the Rosario Refinery; which\r\ngives us a total of £7,233,600 invested in this industry. The largest\r\nundertakings used to be in the hands of Señor Tornquist and M. Hilairet,\r\nnow both deceased, to whom the country is indebted for the great progress\r\neffected in this industry.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the position of this industry, we must recall the fact that the\r\narea of Argentine soil planted with sugar-cane at the end of 1907 was\r\n172,900 acres, which yielded an average crop of 12·4 tons of cane per\r\nacre, and produced about 130,000 tons of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe sugar industry has been developed in this country, as in so many\r\nothers, by the system of export bounties or premiums, which has since\r\nbeen suppressed. Twenty years ago the Argentine had to import nearly all\r\nher sugar from Europe——more than 100,000 tons per annum——while to-day she\r\nproduces far more than she can consume, and has to export the surplus of\r\nher production.\r\n\r\nAlthough the progress accomplished was so rapid, it was not effected\r\nwithout certain misunderstandings, caused by excessive production. At\r\nthe end of the sugar crisis of 1896-7, which occasioned the closing of\r\na number of factories, attempts were made to regulate the industry, at\r\nthe instance of the leading makers. To-day there is a syndicate which\r\nregulates production within the limits of exportation and production, and\r\nserves as a sales agency for all the factories.\r\n\r\nThe sugar industry of Tucuman has the advantage as part of its equipment\r\nthe Rosario refinery, which receives the raw sugar of Tucuman and\r\nsubjects it to the various processes of crystallisation and bleaching.\r\nIts output during the agricultural year 1906-7 was 107,621,800 lb. of\r\nrefined sugar; during the year 1907-1908 it was 120,552,220 lb.\r\n\r\n_Flour-milling._——Flour-milling has had much the same history as the\r\nsugar industry. Although the industry was established in the Argentine\r\nas early as the sixteenth century, it has only been properly developed\r\nduring the last twenty years. Before this period the Argentine was\r\nsupplied partly from Chili, as its power of production had not kept\r\npace with its population. To-day the situation has been completely\r\ntransformed, since the enormous development of agriculture; not only does\r\nthe flour produced suffice for the country, but since 1878 an export\r\ntrade has sprung up, amounting to 39,000 tons in 1902, 72,000 in 1903,\r\n107,000 in 1904, 144,700 in 1905, 129,000 in 1906, and 127,000 in 1907.\r\nBrazil is the Argentine’s best customer for flour, having imported 84,000\r\ntons in 1904, 103,000 in 1905, 114,000 in 1906, and 118,300 in 1907.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain was the second-best customer for flour, having imported\r\n14,800 tons in 1904, 24,400 in 1905, 5400 in 1906, and 1200 in 1907;\r\nto-day the exportation is negligible.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are 600 or 700 flour-mills in the Argentine,\r\nrepresenting a capital of from £2,200,000 to £2,640,000. Buenos Ayres\r\nhas two, which have been lately installed on American models. They are\r\nsituated on land belonging to Madero Harbour, and comprise a fine and\r\npowerful equipment, with grain-elevators, silos, and granaries. One\r\nis the property of the Belgian Steam Flour-mills Company, and has a\r\ncapacity of from 12,000 to 14,000 tons. The other, with a capacity of\r\n80,000 tons, was built by the efforts of two great railway companies, the\r\nBuenos-Ayres Rosario and the Central Argentine. We have seen that no less\r\nimportant installations are shortly to be built at Rosario, by the French\r\ncompany which holds the harbour concession.\r\n\r\n_The Refrigerating Industry._——Among all the Argentine industries the\r\nmost important is that of chilling or freezing meat and other foodstuffs.\r\nIt is gradually replacing, in the export markets, the salt meat or\r\n_saladeros_ industry, which formerly was the only industry in the\r\ncountry dependent upon stock-raising. The latter industry is carried on\r\nprincipally in Buenos Ayres, Santa Fé, Entre Rios, and Corrientès.\r\n\r\nThe principal refrigerating establishments are the following:——\r\n\r\n_The Sansinena Frozen Meat Co._, with a capital of £600,000, and the\r\nwarehouses known as La Negra, at Buenos Ayres and Bahia Blanca, in the\r\nquarter known as _Cuatreros_.\r\n\r\n_The River Plate Fresh Meat Co._, with a capital of £453,600, whose\r\nwarehouses are in the Province of Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n_The Palmas Produce Co._, which is a component part of James Nelson &\r\nCo., and has a capital of £500,000, exploits the district of Campana.\r\n\r\n_La Blanca_, with a capital of £300,000, established at Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n_The Plata Cold Storage Co._, with a capital of £403,805, situated at La\r\nPlata.\r\n\r\nRecently another refrigerating establishment has been inaugurated at\r\nZarate, the property of the _Smithfield and Argentine Meat Co._, with a\r\nmechanical equipment allowing 150 bullocks and 600 sheep to be killed per\r\ndiem. Its capital is £200,000.\r\n\r\nTo this list we may add the _Kemmerich Products Co._, which manufactures\r\nextracts of beef. Its capital is £480,000, and it is established at Santa\r\nElena, in the Province of Entre Rios. This company owns 2700 square miles\r\nof land, 340,000 cattle, 20,000 horses, and 50,000 sheep.\r\n\r\nThe exports of the refrigerating establishments for the last seven years\r\nare given in the following table, which shows the enormous increase in\r\nthe export of quarters of beef during the last few years.\r\n\r\n                 _Exports of Frozen Meat_ (1901-1908).\r\n\r\n

+-----------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe capital invested in the refrigerating industry, including both share\r\ncapital and loans, is estimated at £4,449,825. The profits obtainable\r\nmay be judged by the dividends paid by the most important of the\r\nrefrigerating companies: the Sansinena Frozen Meats Co., in 1902, paid 50\r\nper cent. out of the exceptional profits realised by the sale of cattle\r\nin South Africa during the Boer war. Since then the dividends of this\r\ncompany have fallen to 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the development of this industry is the closing of\r\nEnglish ports against cargoes of live cattle, for fear of anthrax. It is\r\nby the help of this prohibition that the refrigerating companies have\r\nconquered the English market, which to-day takes up the greater part of\r\nour frozen meat, as before it took our cattle. Steps have of late been\r\ntaken with a view to re-opening the ports under a pledge of sanitary\r\nmeasures; but nothing decisive has been done, on account of the protests\r\nof English cattle-breeders, and also of the refrigerating companies, most\r\nof which have been created by English capital.\r\n\r\n_The Dairy Industry._——Among the industries connected with\r\ncattle-breeding there is one which, without having the same importance\r\nas the industry dealt with above, has yet a certain margin of\r\ndevelopment. This is the dairy industry, with its derivatives, butter and\r\ncheese-making.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine breeders having imported excellent Durham or Dutch\r\nmilch-cows, the dairy produce is of the finest quality.\r\n\r\nLarge establishments, of which one, La Martona, belongs to a private\r\ncompany, have been installed for the purpose of supplying the city of\r\nBuenos Ayres with milk. It is estimated that the daily sale at the\r\ncounters of _La Martona_ amounts to 10,000 glasses; the sales of _La\r\nMarina_ amount to 6000, and of _La Granja Blanca_ to 10,000 glasses.\r\nAll these approximate figures refer to the summer only, and the sales\r\nacross the counter by the litre, for family consumption, and the house\r\nto house distribution, are not included in these figures. Besides the\r\nabove establishments there are many cow-keepers in the city, as well as\r\ndairymen who receive their milk by rail.\r\n\r\nAs for butter and cheese, it was estimated at the time of the census of\r\n1895 that there were 357 establishments devoted to this industry. In the\r\nmatter of butter the Argentine does more than suffice to itself——though\r\nten years ago this was not the case——but to-day it exports considerable\r\nquantities to England, Brazil, and South Africa.\r\n\r\nTo give the reader some idea of the dimensions which the butter-making\r\nindustry may attain in the future, we need only cite the following data:——\r\n\r\nAccording to the national census of 1895 there were 22,000,000 cattle in\r\nthe Argentine Republic, of which only 1,200,000 figured as milch cows;\r\nthe value of the latter being not less than £14,000,000. Butter-making\r\nand cheese-making were very restricted industries, especially the former,\r\nand the statistics of 1895 mention an export of only 500 tons. But the\r\nimpulse was already given; and the combined efforts of agriculturalists\r\nand cattle-breeders, directed towards the improvement of the bovine\r\nspecies, were about to give an extraordinary impetus to the butter-making\r\nindustry. Let us see how the situation has improved between 1895, the\r\ntime of the last national census, and 1908, the year in which the\r\nagricultural and pastoral census was taken.\r\n\r\nThis latter inventory has shown that in 1908 the Argentine Republic\r\ncontained 29,119,625 head of cattle, of which 2,163,900 were milch\r\ncows and 12,825,904 were cows employed for breeding purposes. That is,\r\nconsidering the milch cows only, we do not find a very extraordinary\r\nincrease since 1895, although all agricultural and pastoral industries\r\nhave undergone such a remarkable development. It is extremely probable,\r\nhowever, that a certain number of milch cows are counted among the cows\r\nemployed for breeding purposes, as the latter do produce milk, whether\r\nfor consumption on the farm or for commercial purposes. Here are the\r\nfigures of the exportation of butter from 1895 to 1908:——\r\n\r\n  Year.    Number of Tons Exported.

Counting upon a daily yield of 17·6 pints of\r\nmilk per cow, valued, in its original state or in the form of butter or\r\ncheese, at 2d. per litre, or 1·136d. per pint, we obtain a sum of £64,000\r\nper diem, or £23,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nBut these calculations are purely theoretical. One thing, however, we can\r\nsay to the credit of the country, and that is that its dairy industry\r\nis admirably adapted to the requirements of a great city such as Buenos\r\nAyres, which must perforce obtain that essential aliment, milk, under the\r\nmost favourable conditions of price and quality. An extremely perfect\r\nequipment enables the industry to utilise its by-products. The problem is\r\nnot whether the Argentine can produce such a quantity of butter, but to\r\nwhom it can sell it, for in America Brazil is its only customer, while in\r\nEurope it has to struggle against the competition of such countries as\r\nFrance or Switzerland, which countries it would be difficult to displace.\r\n\r\nAs for cheese, we quote only from memory; its production is practically\r\nlimited by local requirements. The most important establishment in this\r\nline is that belonging to Señores A. & R. Luro, on their estate, San\r\nPascual del Moro. Here the “moro” cheese is made, an imitation of the\r\nRoman cheese, which is consumed in large quantities by the Italian colony.\r\n\r\n_Breweries._——Although not directly dependent upon the produce of the\r\nsoil, since the country produces no hops, and, very little barley,\r\nwe will nevertheless mention the industry of brewing, as one which is\r\nat present in a prosperous condition. It is undertaken by a number of\r\nlimited liability companies, of which the most important, due to the\r\ninitiative of M. Bemburg, is the _Brasserie Argentine de Quilmes_, a\r\nFrench company with a capital of £360,000, which brews about 3,960,000\r\ngallons of the 8,360,000 gallons consumed by the nation.\r\n\r\nNext, with a much smaller output, comes the Bieckert Company, with a\r\ncapital of £362,880, and an output (in 1904) of 1,349,390 gallons; the\r\n_Cerveceria Palermo_, with a capital of £132,000, and an output of\r\n1,264,690 gallons; the _Rio Segundo_, in the Province of Córdoba, with a\r\ncapital of £80,000, and an output of 423,810 gallons; and the _Fabrica\r\nNacional de Cerveza_, with a capital of £120,000, and an output of\r\n540,540 gallons.\r\n\r\nHere are the statistics of production and consumption for the last six\r\nyears of the thirty-two Argentine breweries:——\r\n\r\n  Year.     Production    Consumption\r\n             (pints).

Hitherto, according to Girola, the\r\nnative barleys have been very little used, as they are not appreciated as\r\nthey deserve to be; and the growers, on the other hand, have not taken\r\nsufficient pains to produce a good brewer’s barley. We must hope that\r\nthis situation will soon be changed, and that more pains will be taken in\r\nthe numberless fertile valleys of the Argentine in the growing of barley\r\nand its improvement.\r\n\r\n_Spirits._——The production of alcohol, unlike that of other industrial\r\nproducts, is rapidly decreasing. In 1907 only 3,823,336 gallons were\r\nproduced, while in 1897 the production was nearly 6,600,000 gallons. But\r\nwe must not forget that the duty, which was originally 7 centavos per\r\nlitre (6·72d. per gallon), was in 1898 increased to 1 piastre per litre,\r\nor 8s. per gallon; nearly five times the prime cost of the spirits.\r\n\r\n_Weaving._——In concluding this sketch of the chief industries of the\r\ncountry which are connected either with agriculture or stock-raising, it\r\nis not out of place to speak of those which, although so far scarcely\r\ndeveloped, may do better in time under favouring circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith the development of cotton-planting and a plentiful supply of wool,\r\nit seems that a large number of looms might be profitably established\r\nand operated in the Argentine. But hitherto this industry, of prime\r\nimportance though it be, has been held in check by the expense of the\r\nnecessary machinery and of coal, which has to be imported from abroad,\r\nand the scarcity of labour.\r\n\r\n_Tanning._——This industry too, ought in time to occupy a place of far\r\ngreater importance than it does now; for the raw materials——hides and\r\nquebracho, the best of tanning media, are present in abundance. To\r\nunderstand the stationary condition of this industry we must remember\r\nthat it would require a considerable spare capital, as the hides have to\r\nremain in the vats for several months, during which time the tanner has\r\nneed of capital at low terms of interest, which up to the present time\r\nhas not been available in the Argentine.\r\n\r\n_Quebracho Wood._——Considering its future prospects, we must give a\r\nspecial place to the industry which exploits quebracho timber; converting\r\nthe balks into railway sleepers, or extracting their tannin.\r\n\r\nRed quebracho is found scattered profusely through the hundreds of square\r\nleagues of the country known as the Chaco, which is situated between 24°\r\nand 28° of south latitude, and 59° and 64° of west longitude, and also\r\nin the Provinces of Santa Fé, Santiago de l’Estero and Corrientès. The\r\nChaco quebracho is superior to that of Santiago, which has the misfortune\r\nto grow in nitrous alkaline soil, where the trees do not reach any\r\nconsiderable dimensions. The Tucuman product is good, as it grows in a\r\ndamp soil, when it grows well and is full of sap. Best of all is the red\r\nquebracho of Chaco; it is the richest in tannic products; according to an\r\nanalysis made in the United States, it contains 30 per cent. of tannin,\r\nwhile the Santa Fé product contains less than 26 per cent.\r\n\r\nAlthough quebracho wood is absolutely impervious to rot, and may thus\r\nbe used in building, for piles, quays, sleepers, etc., it is exploited\r\nmore especially for the production of tannin, as more profit is made by\r\nso treating it. A sleeper requires a good-sized log, considerable time,\r\nand much labour, to say nothing of the loss of wood; while the quebracho\r\nextract may be obtained from logs of any size. To-day the value of a\r\nsleeper, loaded on the track, is worth 6s. 2d., while three times as\r\nmuch may be made by extracting the tannin. For this reason the principal\r\ncompanies engaged in the quebracho trade have abandoned the manufacture\r\nof sleepers, so that certain railway companies——the Buenos Ayres Western,\r\nfor example——have had to content themselves with iron sleepers.\r\n\r\nUntil quite lately quebracho wood was sawn into large round or squared\r\nbalks, which were then sent abroad, chiefly to Germany, where the tannin\r\nwas extracted. During the five years, 1899-1903, 1,044,000 tons of logs\r\nwere exported; in 1903, 200,201 tons; in 1904, 252,723 tons; in 1905,\r\n285,897 tons; in 1906, 230,000 tons; in 1907, 246,514 tons; and during\r\nthe first six months of 1908, 127,609 tons. Various foreign and native\r\ncompanies were formed, with large capitals, to convert the wood into\r\nextract of tannin, and to export it in this form.\r\n\r\nThese companies are: the _Compañia Industrial del Chaco_, with a capital\r\nof £348,000 and two factories; one at Las Toscas, in Santa Fé, with a\r\nmonthly output of 1000 tons of extract, and one at Calchagin, in the same\r\nProvince, which produces 600 tons per month. These factories are equipped\r\nwith German plant.\r\n\r\nThis company enjoyed a season of great prosperity in 1904; although its\r\nfactories produced only 12,000 tons of extract instead of 36,000, as they\r\ncould have done, a dividend of 42 per cent. was declared. Since then the\r\nlack of outlet and the low prices have paralysed the development of this\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nAnother tannin factory, able to produce 250 tons of extract, has been\r\nestablished by Herwig Brothers at Pehuajó, Province of Corrientès.\r\n\r\nThe Compañia Industrial del Chaco is also about to erect, at Resistencia,\r\na factory with a capacity of 300 tons of extract per month.\r\n\r\n_El Quebracho_ is the last of the companies established for the\r\nextraction of quebracho tannin, and this also began to work under the\r\nmost auspicious financial conditions. Its factories are installed at\r\nFives-Lille, Province of Santa Fé, on land belonging to the “Kemmerich\r\nProducts Co.”; these have been equipped with the most perfect machines\r\nof German make. The capital of this enterprise amounts to £32,000, which\r\nit is hoped will be repaid by the profits of the first few years. The\r\nmonthly output is 450 tons.\r\n\r\nThe _Mocovi Tannin Co._, floated with a capital of £60,000, has a factory\r\nsome 60 miles east of Los Amores (Santa Fé), and has a capacity of 300\r\ntons per month.\r\n\r\nThe firm of _Hardy & Co._, of Las Palmas, near Resistencia, own a factory\r\nwhich cost £50,000, and produces 200 tons of extract monthly.\r\n\r\nThe _Formosa_ company, which deals in timber and quebracho tannin, has a\r\ncapital of £200,000. This company owns 96 square leagues of forest——some\r\n880 square miles——which are estimated to contain 2 million tons of\r\nquebracho. This company intends to establish a factory capable of\r\nproducing 15,000 tons of tannin yearly.\r\n\r\n_The Compañia Azucarera de Resistencia_, with a capital of £22,700,\r\nproduces 80 tons of extract monthly, and the factory of _M. Benito\r\nPinasco_, at Guaycurú, on the Santa Fé railway line, produces 30 tons.\r\n\r\nBesides these factories, Señors Charles and Joseph Casado, the Argentine\r\nowners of 2800 square leagues of land (over 25,000 square miles), in the\r\nParaguayan Chaco, have established two factories, one at Puerto Casado\r\nand the other at Puerto Sastre, which produce, respectively, 500 and 1000\r\ntons of extract per month.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of quebracho wood is 25 per cent. of extract; but as\r\nthe extract contains a number of resinous and colouring matters, which\r\nmust be eliminated during the process of manufacture, the net yield is 22\r\nto 23 per cent. of solid extract containing 20 per cent. of water, which\r\ncontains 70 to 73·5 per cent. of tannic oxide——that is, pure tannin.\r\n\r\nThe system employed in extracting the tannin is based upon diffusion.\r\nFirstly, the wood is reduced to powder by means of machines which cut or\r\nsaw the wood, into which the logs are fed entire. Then, when the wood is\r\nconverted into sawdust or fine chips or shavings, it is passed through\r\nextractors or diffusers, which separate the cellulose from the tannin,\r\nwhich is finally concentrated to the degree demanded by the market by\r\nmeans of vacuum pans.\r\n\r\nDuring five years, from 1904 to 1908, the exports were: 20,111 tons in\r\n1904; 29,408 tons in 1905; 30,839 tons in 1906; 28,190 tons in 1907;\r\n48,160 tons in 1908.\r\n\r\nGermany and the United States are the chief buyers of this valuable\r\nproduct, which forms the principal wealth of the northern part of the\r\nArgentine.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this book we prophesied a rapid and prosperous\r\ndevelopment for this industry, which had already received a considerable\r\nimpetus; unhappily this prediction has not been realised in practice,\r\nand the quebracho industry has suffered, not precisely a crisis, but a\r\ndiminution of its outlets which has seriously prejudiced its interests.\r\n\r\nThis trouble is due to various causes. Firstly, the ruinous competition\r\nbetween the various firms producing quebracho tannin; a competition\r\nwhich has now happily disappeared, thanks to an arrangement concluded\r\nbetween the principal companies, on the initiative of M. Hermann\r\nSchlieper; secondly, to the almost prohibitive duties which the German\r\nGovernment has imposed upon the importation of the product; thirdly, the\r\nindifference shown by the railway companies in using on their permanent\r\nway sleepers of steel rather than of quebracho, although the latter is\r\nmore durable. It is to be hoped, however, that in course of time these\r\ncauses will disappear, and that this industry will in future recover all\r\nthe elements of progress.\r\n\r\n_The Timber Industry._——Another industry which is equally dependent\r\nupon the forestal wealth of the Argentine is that whose object is the\r\nexploitation of the various and valuable kinds of wood to be found in\r\nvarious parts of the country, especially in the forests of the Chaco and\r\nof Formosa.\r\n\r\nThe variety of costly woods to be found in these forests is astonishing.\r\nRecently more than thirty-three species have been classified, all of\r\nindustrial value; the best known, besides the quebracho, being the\r\nacacia, algarrobo, button-tree, lapacho, bay, the smaller cedar, and many\r\nother varieties, black, white and red.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this forestal wealth a limited company has lately been formed\r\nwith a capital of £352,000, which proposes to erect two important\r\nsaw-mills in the Chaco. This company already owns about 2300 square miles\r\nof forest, and is thinking of increasing its domain by further purchases.\r\n\r\n_Fisheries._——Finally, quitting the forests for the seas, we must mention\r\none other industry, at present unimportant, but apparently capable of\r\nconsiderable development: namely, the sea fisheries.\r\n\r\nOwner of an immense coast-line bathed by the southern seas, the Argentine\r\nhas an appreciable store of wealth at her disposal; which so far has been\r\ndrawn upon only in a modest and almost secret manner, but which is now\r\nbeginning to attract attention, to the great benefit of the country and\r\nof those who have entered upon this industry.\r\n\r\nSince Prof. Nordenskjold wintered in Antarctic waters, Captain Larsen\r\nhas been able to report a source of great wealth, which can be easily\r\nand profitably exploited, in the fishing of these waters; and upon his\r\narrival in Buenos Ayres he put himself in communication with a group of\r\nArgentine capitalists, who decided to form a limited company by the name\r\nof _La Pesca_, with a capital of £32,000.\r\n\r\nThe results of the first season’s fishing was so productive, and the\r\nnumber of whales harpooned and “cut in” so large, that, according to a\r\nreport which has been sent us, this company was able, at the end of the\r\nfirst year, to return the capital sunk in the firm of dividends.\r\n\r\nNaturally such results cannot fail to draw new adventurers into this\r\nindustry, which in turn will increase and develop the wealth of the\r\ncountry, at the same time procuring for the country a class of men formed\r\nby the strenuous labour of Antarctic life; a class of which the young\r\nArgentine navy has the greatest need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                 MINES, ELECTRICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nThe Argentine has not entered the industrial age——She has no\r\n    coal-mines in operation, no natural motive forces of any\r\n    importance.\r\n\r\nMINES——Symptoms of the awakening of the mining industry——Numerous\r\n    lodes in the Andes——The mines of La Rioja and Catamarca——Mines\r\n    in other provinces and territories——Mining legislation.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC INDUSTRIES——Tramways; their development, their perfected\r\n    equipment, and their profits——Progress of electric lighting——\r\n    Telegraphs——Telephones.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS INDUSTRIES——List of various industries established in\r\n    Buenos Ayres, according to the last census, with the value of\r\n    their products.\r\n\r\nComparison between the statistics of 1895 and those of 1904——\r\n    Progress realised in 1908——Workshops and factories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic, as we have already on various occasions\r\nexplained, has not yet entered upon the industrial phase. All its capital\r\nand all its energies tend toward the exploitation of the soil, and as the\r\nresults are greater than the boldest speculator could have predicted,\r\nthe country has no need at present, with its small population, to launch\r\nitself into the unknown by entering the province of industry.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Argentine does not so far possess coal or iron measures\r\neasily workable, and has very little labour at its disposal, and\r\ntherefore should not disperse its activities among too many objects. It\r\nis its best policy to limit itself to producing articles that it can\r\nmake more cheaply than the foreigner; not artificially to develop its\r\nindustries in the shelter of an ultra-protectionist tariff. It would fall\r\nto the consumer to pay for such products of the national industry, and\r\nthe state would lose a serious portion of its revenues.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we may well ask whether the Argentine, in addition to its\r\nagricultural wealth, should pretend to a great industrial future, like\r\nthat of the United States.\r\n\r\nSo far we cannot reply in the affirmative; not, at least, under present\r\nconditions. However rich the subsoil of the country may be, a matter at\r\npresent uncertain, especially in respect of coal and iron measures, which\r\nare the basis of all industries, we must remember that the majority of\r\nthese measures are situated in the region of the Cordillera, 4000 to 5000\r\nfeet above sea-level, over 900 miles from the coast, far from roads or\r\nwaterways, and are consequently very badly situated for the establishment\r\nof industrial centres.\r\n\r\nWhat coal and iron the Argentine may possess is distributed over a region\r\nof some thousands of miles in extent, which does not appear to contain\r\ncontinuous lodes or measures, and in which there are no real valleys or\r\nriver-basins. Putting all questions of tariff aside, but considering the\r\nconstant lowering of freights, we think the Argentine will always find it\r\ncheaper to obtain its supplies from abroad, except such as it can produce\r\neconomically, rather than attempt to embrace all industries in its dreams\r\nof greatness.\r\n\r\nNeither can we expect from the utilisation of natural motive forces a\r\ndevelopment which might in some degree compensate for the absence of\r\nfuel. There are a few waterfalls in Córdoba and in Tucuman, but such\r\nenergy as they might furnish would hardly allow one to hope much from\r\ntheir adaptation to industrial uses. One of the most important of these\r\nfalls is that below the Barrage San Roque, in the Sierra de Córdoba; it\r\nbelongs to the North American Company, “Luz y Fuerza” (Light and Force).\r\nThe company’s plant gives a yield of about 3000 horse-power, which is\r\nemployed, for the greater part, in providing light and motive power to\r\nthe town of Córdoba, and also for the production of carbide of calcium.\r\nAnother installation, belonging to the Molet Company, has a capacity of\r\nsome 700 or 800 horse-power, which is employed in the same manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe falls of the Yguassu, on the upper Parana, some 230 miles above\r\nCorrientès, on the confines of Brazil, Paraguay and the Argentine, have\r\nbeen described as a marvel of nature. It would seem that these falls\r\nrepresent a force three times greater than Niagara; their width is 12,000\r\nfeet, or more than two miles, with a fall of 212 feet. Unfortunately\r\nthis cataract is on the border of the Argentine territory, in a region\r\nof forests accessible only with difficulty, and will probably flow for\r\nmany years yet before any one profits by this enormous natural source of\r\npower.\r\n\r\n_Mines._——Although the industrial future of the Argentine is as yet by no\r\nmeans clear, we must admit that during the last four years there has been\r\na livelier movement in favour of gold, silver, and copper mining, which\r\nhas resulted in the flotation of several important limited companies.\r\nIt was to support these first steps that the Government built an aerial\r\nrailway——one of the boldest works ever attempted in the whole world——to\r\nexploit the rich mines of Famatina.\r\n\r\n“Over the whole stretch of the eastern slopes of the Andes,” says an\r\nimportant official publication[84] which we take for guide, “from Bolivia\r\nto Tierra del Fuego, the existence of numerous mineral-bearing regions\r\nis proved; notably in the Provinces of Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja,\r\nCatamarca, Salta, Jujuy, Tucuman, Córdoba, and San Luis, where traces of\r\nancient mineral workings have been discovered.”[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Description sommaire de la République Argentine comme pays\r\nd’immigration, 1904._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: The Argentine lost much of its mineral wealth when Potozi\r\nand La Paz were lost to Bolivia.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThere are many villages which ever since the Spanish Conquest have\r\ndrawn their sustenance from the gold and silver which their inhabitants\r\nobtain, by rudimentary processes, from the beds of stream or river, and\r\nby plain mining. Also, despite the difficulties of transport, various\r\nwell-organised companies have obtained very fair results from their\r\nworkings, since they obtained their concessions a few years ago. Now that\r\nthe feelers of the railway systems have reached these districts, and the\r\nmining companies have established aerial cable-ways to connect them with\r\nthe mines, we can already perceive a greater vitality in this industry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the wealth of the Cordillera, prospectors are discovering\r\nnew lodes in the interior of the country; but, as always happens, miners\r\nprefer to gather in already familiar districts, rather than undertake\r\nlong journeys, and the labour of prospecting at their own expense.\r\n\r\nThe best-known mines of the Argentine are distributed as follows:——\r\n\r\nIn the Province of _Mendoza_ there are mines of copper, silver-bearing\r\ngalena, gold-bearing quartz, coal, alabaster, slate, and marble, and\r\nwells of petroleum; in the Province of _San Juan_, of gold-bearing\r\nquartz, silver, copper, antimony, coal, sulphur, and amianthus.[86]\r\nIn view of the development which this region may undergo through the\r\nexploitation of the coal-measures, the Great Western Railway has decided\r\nto construct a branch line as far as the coal mines of Salagasta\r\n(Mendoza).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Amianthus——the best quality of asbestos.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe Province of _La Rioja_ has been known for a long time for its rich\r\nmines of metallic silver, and also for its copper mines, whose ores\r\ncontain a high percentage of gold and silver; and for its gold “placer”\r\nmines. It is to facilitate the working of these mines that the aerial\r\ncable-way is being constructed, which will unite Cerro de Famatina and\r\nthe mining centre of Chilecito with the railways. Here, as everywhere,\r\nskilled miners are somewhat scarce.\r\n\r\nThe Province of _Catamarca_, the centre of the Capillitas mining country,\r\npossesses copper mines with a high percentage of silver and gold, which\r\nhave been worked for more than thirty years. These mines, which are, it\r\nappears, very rich in minerals, have been acquired by a foreign company,\r\nand will be the object of an important enterprise; here, too, an aerial\r\ncable-way will be built to transport the ore from the mines to a lower\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThere are also in this region two important smelting works; “Le Pilcian”\r\nand “La Constancia,” which are buried in the depths of the forests of\r\ncarob-trees, which furnish abundant fuel. In other parts are found\r\nsurface veins of copper, silver-bearing galena, bismuth, antimony, mica,\r\ngold-bearing quartz, as well as “placer” mines and coal-measures.\r\n\r\nThe Provinces of _Salta_ and _Jujuy_, which possess rich veins of\r\nauriferous quartz, argentiferous galena, copper, borate of lime, lignite\r\nand petroleum, are famous for the gold obtained from the streams that\r\ndescend from their mountains. Undertakings have been formed with foreign\r\nand native capital, and profitable results are expected. The extension\r\nof the Argentine railways to Bolivia will still further develop the\r\nexploitation of mining districts all through this region.\r\n\r\nIn former times silver mines were worked in the Province of _Tucuman_. In\r\nAconquija also we find mines of copper which must be a continuation of\r\nthose of Catamarca.\r\n\r\nThe Provinces of _Córdoba_ and _San Luis_, besides ascertained veins of\r\ngold-bearing quartz, galena and copper, contain mines of manganese and\r\nwolfram, and well-known quarries of marble, and of onyx, both green and\r\nof other shades.\r\n\r\nIn the Territories of _Tierra del Fuego_ and _Santa Cruz_ the sands along\r\nthe Atlantic coast contain, especially after storms, an abundance of gold\r\nin powder and small nuggets, whose extraction gives employment to numbers\r\nof workers.[87] There also are seams of lignite and of peat. Finally, in\r\nSanta Cruz there are several salt workings, the produce being sent to\r\nBuenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: few years ago a company was formed with North American and\r\nArgentine capital to work the sands in this manner in Tierra del Fuego.]\r\n\r\nThe River _Chubut_, in the Territory of Chubut, brings down fine gold\r\nalong its bed, as do its numerous small tributaries, which rise in\r\nthe Andean slopes. The presence of gold more than 100 miles from the\r\nCordillera tempted some colonists to organise an expedition; at the foot\r\nof the mountain they found gold in nuggets.\r\n\r\nAnother company exploits the salt pits of the Valdez Peninsula, and\r\nanother the quarry of flat granite slabs, known as the Atlas Quarry.\r\n\r\nFor many years now large quantities of gold have been found in the\r\nrich “placers” of the Territory of Neuquen, where copper also has been\r\ndiscovered, silver-bearing galena, coal, and petroleum. The gold taken\r\nout of the washers of Villa Michicó and the neighbourhood is estimated at\r\n330 lb. avoirdupois annually.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of _Rio Negro_ there are abundant quarries of gypsum,\r\nlimestone, and other building materials; in that of the _Pampa Central_\r\ncopper has been recently discovered and is being worked; in that of\r\n_Misionès_ there is native copper, iron, and manganese; in that of the\r\n_Andes_ (Puña de Atacama), there are immense deposits of borate of lime,\r\nas well as veins of quartz and “placers.”\r\n\r\nConsidering the vast extent of these territories, which have never been\r\nseriously explored except at a few points, we have every reason to\r\nbelieve that it will be many years before we have even an approximate\r\nknowledge of the mineral wealth they contain; but the data gathered up to\r\nthe present time augur well for the future of the mining industry in the\r\nArgentine.\r\n\r\nWe will add finally, as a further reason for success, the fact that the\r\nlaw regarding mines is remarkably liberal; the State may not exploit them\r\non its own account, but concedes them to any adult applicant capable of\r\nadministering his own property.\r\n\r\nThe same mining laws are in force throughout the country. To acquire\r\na claim it suffices to present a written demand, containing an exact\r\nindication of the position and nature of the claim demanded, the details\r\nof its discovery, and all other useful information, accompanied by a\r\nsample of the mineral. Immediately upon the presentation of this demand\r\nthe administration enters it with the date of deposition, in order\r\nto prove the right of priority; and directly the concession has been\r\nsurveyed and delimited, the claimant has full rights in his mine and may\r\ndispose of it as he wills. The mine is untaxed, and so are the mineral\r\nproducts, whether sold at home or abroad. The only obligation imposed\r\nupon the miner is that he shall work his mine with at least four miners\r\nduring 230 days of the year; if this condition be not fulfilled, any\r\nother person may demand the concession of the abandoned mine.[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Senator Domingo Perez has just laid before Parliament, a\r\nprojected law substituting a fine or tax for this obligation.]\r\n\r\n_The Electrical Industry._——It is greatly to the credit of the Argentine\r\nthat everything that makes for progress, for an increased welfare or\r\ngreater convenience, is immediately applied by the Republic. The latter\r\nquickly absorbs all improvements and, profiting by the experience of\r\nolder nations, immediately puts new procedures into practice, instead of\r\nlingering in the rut of outworn systems. Thus it was, for example, in\r\nthe case of the electrical industry. The Argentine has no need, in this\r\nrespect, to envy the most advanced nations. In Buenos Ayres——for only\r\nthe large centres can be progressive to this extent——all the tramway and\r\nelectric lighting concerns are most excellently equipped, and are in this\r\nmatter equal to the best installations of England or the States.\r\n\r\nThe electric tramway companies, whose tracks cross Buenos Ayres in every\r\ndirection, are seven in number, forming a network of lines which are\r\ndistributed as follows:——\r\n\r\nThe “Anglo-Argentine” Company, 18·8 miles; the “Capital” Company, 34·7\r\nmiles; the “Metropolitan” Company, 19·8 miles; the “Grand National,” 76·9\r\nmiles; the “Compagnie Lacroze de Buenos Ayres,” 44 miles; the “Southern\r\nElectric Tramways,” 49 miles; and the “Harbour and City of Buenos Ayres,”\r\n6·8 miles.\r\n\r\nThe great event of 1908 was the amalgamation of these companies by the\r\n“Anglo-Argentine,” which proposes to unite these lines under a single\r\nmanagement, in order to form a vast network, comprising all the principal\r\nlines, with the exception of the “Compagnie Lacroze” and the “Harbour\r\nand City of Buenos Ayres.” The total capital invested in this important\r\nundertaking amounts to not less than £14,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that this great financial operation, which will place\r\nthe Anglo-Argentine Company at the head of the most important tramway\r\ncompanies of the world, will not fail to benefit the public, and that the\r\nCompany will also turn its attention to improving its equipment and to\r\nlowering its fares to a uniform rate.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the number of passengers carried by the Buenos Ayres\r\ntramways is constantly increasing, as may be seen in the following\r\ntable:——\r\n\r\n           Passengers Carried.         Gross Profits.\r\n\r\n  Year.    Horse      Electric.      Horse    Electric.   Total Profits.\r\n         Traction.

Today there are 721 miles of gas\r\npipes and 233 miles of electric cables.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the electric lighting companies is estimated at nearly\r\n£2,000,000, and their output at 30,905 horse-power. The electrical supply\r\nis chiefly in the hands of the German Electricity Company, with a capital\r\nof £1,850,000, which has already absorbed the two companies previously\r\nin existence. Its equipment was furnished by the famous firm of Siemens\r\nHalske, which stands in the front rank of German electrical manufacturing\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\n_Telegraphs._——Another mark of progress is the continual extension of the\r\ntelegraphic system. The national, provincial, and private lines together\r\nrepresent to-day a length of 31,215 miles, of which 15,125 belong to the\r\nState; twenty years ago the mileage was barely half this figure.\r\n\r\nAs for telegraphic communication with the exterior, there are two foreign\r\ncable companies, one possessing the cable running to the United States\r\n_via_ Galveston, and the other that communicating with Europe _via_\r\nMadeira. Communication between London and Buenos Ayres is now established\r\nin about forty-five minutes, while a few years ago the average was five\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Telephones._——The telephone is used in the capital and the principal\r\ntowns——Rosario, Córdoba, Santa Fé, Tucuman, Mendoza, etc. Buenos Ayres\r\nis connected by telephone with Montevideo (124 miles), Rosario (190\r\nmiles), and will shortly be connected with Bahia Blanca (437 miles). The\r\ntwo companies established in Buenos Ayres, the “Telephonic Union of the\r\nRio de la Plata” and the “Co-operative Telephonic Company,” represent a\r\ncapital, respectively, of £243,963 and £582,032.\r\n\r\nAll these data, which we merely mention in passing, go to prove that the\r\nArgentine has assimilated all the details of industrial progress, even\r\nin their most improved forms. Experiments in wireless telegraphy are\r\nnow being made with a view to communicating at long distance with the\r\nsteamers leaving or approaching Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n_Various Industries._——At the end of 1908, according to the statistics\r\nof the official industrial census of that year, which was undertaken by\r\nthe Department of Commerce in the Ministry of Agriculture, there were,\r\nin the city of Buenos Ayres, 10,349 factories or workshops, representing\r\na capital of £23,443,144. The sales of these factories, etc., for 1908,\r\namounted to £47,048,773. The raw material consumed was worth £25,223,681.\r\nThe motive power employed in these factories was equivalent to 105,575\r\nhorse-power, and the number of workers employed was 118,315. Of the\r\nowners, 14·8 per cent. were of Argentine nationality.\r\n\r\nIf we compare these figures with those of the municipal census of 1904,\r\nwe obtain the following results:——\r\n\r\n                                     Census of 1904.   Census of 1908.\r\n\r\n  Number of factories and workshops       8,897             10,349\r\n  Capital employed                      £8,733,127        £23,443,144\r\n  Sales                                £16,143,832        £47,048,773\r\n  Motive power consumed (H.P.)          19,458            103,575\r\n  Workmen employed                        68,512            118,315\r\n  Raw material consumed                     ——            £25,223,681\r\n  Masters or owners of Argentine }         12·35             14·81\r\n    nationality (per cent.)      }\r\n\r\nWe see that even in four years there has been a remarkable development\r\nof the industries of Buenos Ayres. This development is especially\r\ndemonstrated by the increase of the capital represented by the sales of\r\nmerchandise or manufactured articles and by the horse-power employed. At\r\nthe end of four years the capital has increased by nearly 300 per cent.,\r\nthe sales by the same amount, and over five times the motive power is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThis progress is certainly remarkable, but it does not perhaps truly\r\nrepresent the actual progress achieved. The Director of the Census,\r\nSeñor Ricardo Pillado, declares that “the general opinion prevalent in\r\nthe offices of the census department is that certain important items of\r\ninformation, relating to matters of great interest, have been concealed\r\nby interested persons. Among such we may cite the value of output, the\r\namounts of sales, the capital employed, the number of employés, etc.;\r\nas the manufacturers are anxious, above all, to shelter themselves\r\nfrom a possible increase of taxation or licences.” So that in spite of\r\nthe satisfactory results of the last census, in spite of the notable\r\nincrease of wealth and industry recorded, the figures given are far from\r\nrepresenting the true significance of the industries of the capital city.\r\n\r\nThe results already given may be classified as follows, under the\r\nheadings of the kind of industry, capital employed, value of produce,\r\nmotive power, and employés engaged:——\r\n\r\n                                                      Value     Number of   Motive\r\n  Industries.

Of a total of 105,575 horse-power, 12,505 are furnished\r\nby electricity, 90,655 by steam, 1939 by gas, and 476 by naphtha.\r\n\r\nAmong those industries which are still in a state of infancy we must\r\nmention the chemical industry; this is limited to a few candle and\r\nsoap factories, sulphuric and nitric-acid works, scent distilleries,\r\ndye factories, etc., whose produce is insufficient to the needs of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe match factories, on the other hand, furnish a good article and are\r\nsufficient to the country. The consumption at present exceeds 200 million\r\nboxes per annum.\r\n\r\nWe must also mention the existence of a few paper-mills, glass furnaces,\r\nand various works where certain agricultural necessities are produced:\r\nsuch as iron wire, fencing, etc., and also certain wheel factories; but\r\nhere again importation furnishes a great proportion of the articles\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                BANKS, THE BOURSE OR STOCK EXCHANGE, AND\r\n                           LIMITED COMPANIES\r\n\r\nBANKS——International character of Argentine banking——Evolution of\r\n    banking machinery——List of the principal banks, with amount of\r\n    capital and business done——Conditions peculiar to Argentine\r\n    banking; the lack of moveable reserves——Rates of interest on\r\n    account, on deposit, and on advances——Statistics of the deposit\r\n    accounts of the principal banks——Exchange operations: their\r\n    decrease since the determination of a fixed monetary ratio——The\r\n    Clearing House; the importance of its operations.\r\n\r\n_The Bank of the Nation_——Its history——The formation of its\r\n    capital——Political interference in the nomination of its\r\n    Directors——Statistics of its accounts——Rapid increase of\r\n    deposits——Difficulty of realising capital——The resumption of\r\n    payments.\r\n\r\n_The Bank of the Province of Buenos Ayres_——Its reorganisation——Its\r\n    present prosperity.\r\n\r\n_Mortgage and Loan Banks_——History of the _Banque Hypothécaire_ of\r\n    the Province of Buenos Ayres——Bankruptcy——Arrangement between\r\n    the bank and its creditors——Proposal of reorganisation——Laws\r\n    relating to mortgage in the Argentine——The National Mortgage\r\n    Bank; statistics of business done——Joint-stock loan companies;\r\n    their capital and amount of business done.\r\n\r\nTHE STOCK EXCHANGE (BOURSE)——History of this institution——Its\r\n    importance; its functions; amount of business done——The\r\n    decrease in its transactions since the cessation of speculation\r\n    in currency or the monetary ratio.\r\n\r\nThe Bourse is a private establishment——Its membership and its\r\n    regulations——Statistics of business done during the last\r\n    ten years——Securities quoted on the Buenos Ayres Bourse——\r\n    Decrease in the total amount of business done during the last\r\n    five years——The monetary reform of 1901 as a factor of this\r\n    decrease——The place occupied by the Stock Exchange in the life\r\n    of the nation.\r\n\r\n_Joint-stock Companies_——The development of joint-stock companies——\r\n    Legislation affecting such companies——Abuses committed in the\r\n    formation of such companies, due to speculation——Statistics of\r\n    capital invested in joint-stock companies before and after the\r\n    speculative crises of 1890——Revival of such companies, in a\r\n    sense more consistent with the development of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any sketch of the commercial life of the Argentine, we must include\r\nthe Bourse and the banks, which play an important part in the business\r\nlife of the community, owing to the facilities which they afford to all\r\nkinds of commercial transactions.\r\n\r\nTo-day such transactions represent a considerable figure, and involve a\r\nmovement of capital amounting to scores of millions. There is obviously\r\nneed of an organised body designed to simplify this movement, and to\r\nplace at the disposal of trade the means of effecting its exchanges with\r\nthe least possible displacement of capital.\r\n\r\n_Banks._——It was inevitable that in the Argentine the evolution of\r\nbanking should be towards an international character, since the trade\r\nof the Republic is almost entirely with foreign countries. Moreover,\r\nthis trade is very largely in the hands of foreigners: French, English,\r\nGermans, Italians, Spaniards, Belgians, or Americans from the States;\r\nwhich fact has resulted in the formation, in the city of Buenos Ayres,\r\nof various groups of banks, corresponding, in respect of their founders\r\nor their capital, to these various nationalities. Each of these\r\nestablishments is in constant communication with the country of its\r\norigin, and seeks to gather round it clients of its own nationality.\r\n\r\nBoth in the matter of importance and that of organisation the banks\r\ndoing business in the Argentine leave nothing to be desired. As we shall\r\npresently see, the sum of the capitals of all these banks amounts to a\r\ntotal of nearly £26,000,000; a sum which appears to be amply sufficient\r\nfor all the present requirements of trade.\r\n\r\nWorking under a system of free competition, and handling a considerable\r\ncapital, they have been induced to offer greater and greater facilities\r\nto trade, in order to increase the number of their clients and the volume\r\nof their operations. Moreover, the suppression of the gold premium has\r\nremoved one of their chief sources of profit; so that they have been\r\nforced to obtain, through the extension and perfection of their ordinary\r\nbanking operations, the compensatory increase of business which allows\r\nthem to maintain the volume of their profits and their dividends.\r\n\r\nOne cannot subject these banks to a rigid comparison; each of them\r\nconducts its business for the benefit of clients of its own nationality,\r\nand in consequence must accede to their usages. The English banks, for\r\nexample, have as their clients railway companies, a large number of\r\nexport houses, and steamship lines, on account of the ties which connect\r\nthem with the London market and its principal financial groups. The\r\nGerman Bank principally serves German industrial houses, and also German\r\nexporters. The French Bank of the Rio de la Plata, owing to its relations\r\nwith the Paris market, and its strong position in Buenos Ayres, is of\r\ninestimable service to French commerce in the Argentine. The Italian\r\nbanks share the custom of the Italian colony, which, on account of its\r\nnumerical importance, gives rise to a great deal of small business.\r\n\r\n_The Banco Español del Rio de la Plata_, which has branch establishments\r\nin Paris, London, Genoa, and Madrid, is in direct relation with the\r\nfinancial circles of those cities, and facilitates all banking operations\r\nbetween the various Spanish-speaking countries. Founded by the financiers\r\nof Buenos Ayres, and afterwards enlarged by French capital, the Spanish\r\nbank, which has admirable premises, has succeeded in surrounding itself\r\nwith a _clientèle_ of great landed proprietors, by offering them all\r\nkinds of facilities for the conduct of business operations connected with\r\nthe sale of national produce. Their branch establishment in Paris is the\r\nfavourite bank of the numerous Argentines who go yearly to Europe on\r\nbusiness or for pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn this congeries of banks the Argentine is represented by two great\r\nestablishments: one of these, the _Banco de la Nacion Argentina_, is a\r\nState institution which, in addition to the business transacted with\r\nthe Government, runs cash and deposit departments like other banks;\r\nthe other is the _Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Ayres_, whose origin\r\nwas in the reconstruction of the historic bank of the same name, the\r\ncollapse of which was provoked by the terrible financial crisis of 1890.\r\nThe excellent results of the last three years which we shall presently\r\nconsider in detail, allow us to predict a brilliant future for this\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nWe shall give, in the following table, a list of these banks, in the\r\norder of their establishment, with details as to their capital, reserves,\r\ntransactions, and dividends.\r\n\r\nAs lately as the year 1907, it was extremely difficult to obtain exact\r\ninformation as to the operations of financial establishments, as there\r\nwas no law obliging them to publish periodical statements of their\r\nposition. From this state of affairs resulted this curious fact: that\r\nif one wished to ascertain the situation or study the operations of\r\nthe English banks, for example——establishments which effected their\r\nbusiness transactions by the aid of funds deposited by inhabitants of the\r\nArgentine——one was forced to resort to the records of the London Stock\r\nExchange, in order to examine the reports and balance-sheets presented\r\neach year by the administrative Boards to the shareholders residing in\r\nEngland. But, very fortunately, thanks to a decision of the ex-Minister\r\nof Finance, Dr Eleodoro Lobos, this omission has been remedied, and it\r\nhas been decreed that all financial establishments must in future supply\r\nthe Ministry of Finance, during the first days of each month, with an\r\nexplanatory balance-sheet giving details of their transactions. This\r\ninformation is made public, so that not only the Government, but anyone\r\ndevoting himself to the study of commercial or financial affairs, may\r\nobtain an exact knowledge of the situation of the leading banks, and\r\nthence of the market, or indeed of the country in general.\r\n\r\nAll these banks work with a relatively large capital, which is mostly\r\ndeposited. To understand the situation we must remember that banks are\r\nobliged, in the Argentine, to keep going by their own means, and are\r\nnot allowed the resource of mobilising their turnover by rediscounting\r\nat the Bank of the Nation. The latter, indeed, is rather a competitor\r\nthan a prop; since it also seeks the custom of private clients. Thus the\r\nfunds at the disposal of the banks consists of their own capital and\r\ntheir deposit accounts——these latter varying greatly from one period to\r\nanother——and they cannot benefit by the supplementary force arising from\r\na credit at the National Bank.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------+---------+-------------------------+------------+----------\r\n                                        |         |         Capital         |            |\r\n                   BANK                 | Founded +------------+------------+   Reserve  |   Last\r\n                                        |   in    | Subscribed |  Deposited |    Funds   | Dividend\r\n  --------------------------------------+---------+------------+------------+------------+----------\r\n  London and River Plate Bank           |  1862   | £2,000,000 | £1,200,000 | £1,200,000 |    20%\r\n  London and Brazilian Bank             |  1862   |  2,000,000 |  1,000,000 |  1,000,000 |    15%\r\n  British Bank of South America         |  1863   |  1,300,000 |    650,000 |    600,000 |    13%\r\n  Italia y Rio de la Plata              |  1872   |  1,200,000 |  1,200,000 |    242,600 |    10%\r\n  Español del Rio de la Plata           |  1886   |  4,400,000 |  3,346,671 |    738,848 |    12%\r\n  Francès del Rio de la Plata           |  1886   |  2,400,000 |  2,350,340 |    140,562 |     9%\r\n  Nuevo Banco Italiano                  |  1887   |    264,000 |    264,000 |    103,400 |    15%\r\n  Popular Argentino                     |  1887   |    429,836 |    427,251 |    197,296 |    11%\r\n  Anglo-South-American Bank             |  1888   |  2,500,000 |  1,250,000 |    750,000 |     9%\r\n  Banco de la Nacion Argentina          |  1891   |  9,697,600 |  9,697,600 |  5,332,319 |    ——\r\n  Banco Aleman Transatlantico           |  1893   |  1,000,000 |    880,000 |    159,232 |     9%\r\n  Banco Popular Italiano                |  1899   |    110,170 |     79,752 |      3,696 |    ——\r\n  Banco del Rio de la Plata             |  1902   |     88,000 |     87,340 |      6,864 |    10%\r\n  Banco de Credito Argentino            |  1904   |    247,280 |    148,783 |       ——   |    ——\r\n  Banco de la Provincia de Buenos-Ayres |  1906   |  1,760,000 |  1,760,000 |     89,320 |    10%\r\n  Banco de Galicia Buenos-Ayres         |  1905   |    264,000 |    264,000 |      2,438 |     4%\r\n  Ernesto Tornquist & Co.

Without this faculty of rapid\r\nmobilisation they cannot enlarge, by operations of short duration, the\r\nsums which they receive in deposit, and consequently cannot allow any\r\nappreciable interest on that portion of their capital. Some banks are at\r\npresent paying 1 per cent. on current accounts; others, and notably the\r\nNational Bank, allow their depositors no interest. For deposit accounts\r\nat three months the interest is usually 3-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs for the rates of discount, these have fallen considerably in the\r\nlast few years; partly on account of the increasing competition between\r\nthe various financial groups, and partly on account of the abundance of\r\ncapital after several years of good harvests. After standing for a long\r\ntime at 7 and 8 per cent., the average rate for first signatures tends\r\nnowadays to settle at 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis is a fact which may surprise those who believe that the monetary\r\nsituation of a country is always affected by the premium on gold, but we\r\nshall see, in the chapter on finance, that there is, as a matter of fact,\r\nan influx of gold into the country, and that its movable resources have\r\nnever been more abundant. The circulation of notes is now guaranteed by a\r\ncash reserve of more than 65 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe banks receive deposits at sight, at thirty, sixty, ninety, and one\r\nhundred and eighty days. They also receive deposits on the “savings-bank”\r\nsystem: that is they pay 3-1/2 or 4 per cent. upon deposits not exceeding\r\n5000 to 10,000 piastres in paper money, or 3000 to 5000 in gold\r\n(according to the particular bank)——that is, £440 to £880 in notes, £600\r\nto £1000 in gold——on condition that if the money is withdrawn under sixty\r\ndays no interest will be allowed. After the lapse of sixty days the money\r\nmay be withdrawn at the will of the depositor, and the interest is added\r\nsince the day of deposit. Small savings deposited on this system attain\r\nto considerable proportions, and the public is becoming more and more\r\nfamiliarised with business of this kind.\r\n\r\nOne item that differs very sensibly from European usage is the rate of\r\ninterest charged on current debit accounts. As the Argentine has no law\r\nregulating this rate, there have been times, happily now past by, when\r\nthis rate has been as high as 10 and 12 per cent. Of late years the\r\nGovernment has paid, as a maximum, 6 to 7 per cent. and that in moments\r\nof disequilibrium, when international complications were feared, and the\r\nbank rates had risen in England and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFor private individuals conditions are also easier, on account of\r\ncompetition, and 7 per cent. has become practically the average rate. In\r\ncertain banks the rate on debit accounts has even fallen as low as 6 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe following table indicates the movements of the principal accounts,\r\nduring the years 1906-1908, in the case of the various banks which\r\npublish their balance-sheets, in the Argentine.\r\n\r\nOn an international market like that of Buenos Ayres exchange operations\r\nare naturally most attractive. Since the suppression of the gold premium,\r\nwhich has reduced the risks to a barely sensible amount, these operations\r\nno longer retain their old speculative character; but, on the other\r\nhand, the profits to be drawn from operations of this kind have greatly\r\ndiminished, so that business has gained only in safety and extent. We\r\nmay here recall the fact that speculations in gold, which amounted to\r\n1,234,000,000 piastres paper (£108,592,000) in the year 1899, had fallen\r\nto 211,000 piastres in 1904, and have now entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in order still further to avoid all risks, such business is\r\nnow done by means of cable transfers, instead of by cheques at one month\r\nfrom date as formerly; thus avoiding as far as possible any variation in\r\nthe rate of exchange. It is chiefly during the period of exportation that\r\nthese drawing transactions become of great importance.\r\n\r\nExchange business is transacted on a gold basis; that is, on the basis\r\nof the gold piastre, which is equivalent to a dollar, or to 5 francs\r\nof French money, or 4s. of English; as for settlements, they are made\r\nindifferently in gold or paper, on the basis of 44 centavos, or ·44 of a\r\npiastre in gold, for one piastre in paper.\r\n\r\nFormerly the rate of exchange used to vary very perceptibly with the\r\nseasons. The banks used to buy during the export season, which for\r\ngrain and wool lasts from December to March, and consequently profited\r\nby the abundance of the market to discuss the price. They then sold to\r\nimport houses during the slack season, sometimes making a profit of 6 to\r\n10 centimes. Now competition has greatly reduced these margins, which\r\nscarcely vary at all, in a normal season, except to the extent of an\r\ninsignificant fraction.\r\n\r\n

the face values, of the notes.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the sales of money are now extended over a far longer period than\r\nbefore, as the export season itself has been extended by new products,\r\nsuch as maize, chilled and frozen meats, etc., which do not necessarily\r\nfind their outlet at the same time as the rest of the harvest. Thus the\r\nbanks have no longer any incentive to hoard reserves of money, as they\r\nare no longer certain of selling them a few months later.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions here enumerated are of course subject to certain\r\nsmall variations, according to the kind of trade or industry. The large\r\nlandowner, the grazier, the farmer, the cattle-breeder, who has no money\r\nat his disposal but that coming from the sale of his products, can only\r\nprocure credit, no matter what his wealth may be in land, at a rate far\r\nhigher than that which is demanded of the large commercial houses of\r\nBuenos Ayres. But as we have especially attempted to demonstrate, the\r\nArgentine banks are to-day splendidly equipped with capital, so organised\r\nas to assist commerce by services of many kinds, and, finally, their\r\ncharges have been abated, by the action of competition, to rates which\r\none would hardly expect to find in practice in a new country.[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: The deposits in the Argentine banks at present amount to\r\nnearly £80,000,000.]\r\n\r\nAs the latest sign of progress we may mention the establishment of the\r\nClearing-House, which commenced operations in 1893, upon the model of the\r\nLondon Clearing-House, under the able management of the under-manager of\r\nthe Bank of London and the Rio de la Plata, Mr Hogg. This institution, as\r\nits name indicates, serves to strike the balances of the sums which the\r\nvarious banks may owe one another, the balances only being actually paid\r\nover. The total sum represented by the operations of the Clearing-House\r\nin 1908 was over £352,000,000. This figure includes the transactions of\r\nthe principal banks of Buenos Ayres, with the exception of the National\r\nBank, which does not make use of the Clearing-House.\r\n\r\nBetween 1893 and 1899 the business done at the Clearing-House underwent\r\na notable and continual increase, and in 1899 amounted to more than\r\n£350,000,000. Since that time its operations temporarily decreased in\r\nvalue, owing to the suppression of the gold premium, which put an end\r\nto exchange speculations, which formerly kept the Clearing-House busy;\r\nso that in 1903 and 1904 the total amount of the operations was barely\r\n£264,000. Since 1904, however, these figures have gradually increased,\r\nand in 1907 and 1908 they once more exceeded £350,000,000. To-day the\r\nbusiness is purely commercial, rendering any exact comparison with the\r\ntimes when speculation played the principal part extremely difficult.\r\nBut if we could subtract this latter element we should certainly find\r\nthat the compensations based on commercial operations have greatly\r\nincreased, since the figures of 1899, although less by those representing\r\nspeculative transactions, have not appreciably diminished.\r\n\r\n_The Bank of the Nation._——To complete this account of the banks of\r\nBuenos Ayres and their operations, we must give an account of the working\r\nof the most important of them all: the _Banco del Nacion_. This bank is\r\nof especial interest, on account of its relations with the Argentine\r\nGovernment, which guarantees all its liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the Nation came to birth at an extremely critical moment in\r\nthe history of Argentine credit and finance. In 1890, after the double\r\npolitical and financial crisis which was then affecting the country, as\r\na consequence of the errors and abuses committed by the Governments,\r\nat a time when all the official credit establishments in the country\r\nlay moribund, disorganised, and discredited, the Government of Signor\r\nPellegrini, called in to inherit the confusion of that which had just\r\nfallen, found itself faced with terrific problems. It attempted to\r\nsolve the banking problem by founding a new institution, to which it\r\nassigned a capital of 50,000,000 of piastres——£4,400,000——the shares\r\nto be offered for public subscription. To the subscribers it promised\r\na certain intervention in the administration of the bank, at the same\r\ntime reserving to the State the right of appointing the president, just\r\nas the French Government appoints the president of the Bank of France.\r\nIn order as far as possible to guarantee the shareholders and the public\r\nagainst the errors and abuses which had formerly been so disastrous,\r\nit established certain restrictive rules in the charter of the new\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nAt another time there was much discussion as to whether the Government of\r\nSignor Pellegrini, whose patriotic intentions no one doubted, would not\r\nhave done better to rescue the old _National Bank_, which was tottering\r\namid the ruins of the crisis, and whose assets, administered by the\r\nnew institution, might have given better results than did liquidation,\r\nthus saving the State much expense; but this question is no longer of\r\nimmediate interest.\r\n\r\nAs was only to be feared, the public, after the spectacle of such\r\nstriking examples of the lamentable end to which official banks are\r\nliable in countries formed by the chances of immigration, and devoid\r\nof established traditions: wherein there exists no sanction for the\r\nsuppression of undoubted abuses: the public, we shall see, regarded the\r\nnew institution with mistrust, and abstained from buying shares. The\r\nGovernment, disappointed in its attempt, was compelled to replace the\r\nsystem of public subscription by an issue of notes, which explains why\r\na purely official bank was created, instead of the mixed bank which had\r\nbeen proposed.\r\n\r\nRealising that the success of a bank depends far more upon the confidence\r\nwith which it inspires the public than upon its organic charter, Signor\r\nPellegrini’s Government, together with those that followed it, took care\r\nto place at the head of the _Banco del Nacion_ only men who were capable,\r\nby their good judgment, their technical competence in banking business,\r\ntheir social position, and their knowledge of the business world, of\r\ngiving prestige to the establishment, and surrounding it with the\r\natmosphere of respect and confidence which was necessary to its success.\r\nThus in spite of its official origin the bank was able to find support in\r\npublic opinion, and to render important services to industry and commerce.\r\n\r\nA study of the accounts of this establishment, during the years\r\n1904-1908, reveals a steady and prosperous progress, which has\r\nincontestably placed the Bank of the Nation at the head of all similar\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nA glance at the following table will prove this. It contains the balances\r\nof the three principal accounts, upon the 31st of December of the five\r\nyears from 1904 to 1908 inclusive.\r\n\r\n  Year.      Bills in Hand.        Overdrafts in       Deposits.\r\n                                 Current Accounts.\r\n  1904         £8,486,326              £14,384        £12,561,969\r\n  1905         11,842,611            2,589,167         15,501,340\r\n  1906         13,364,585            1,907,818         15,163,974\r\n  1907         16,502,621            2,731,314         18,008,501\r\n  1908         19,049,798            2,897,008         20,713,375\r\n\r\nWe see from these figures that in five years the business done has\r\nincreased by more than 10-1/2 millions of pounds; the overdrafts in\r\ncurrent accounts by nearly £300,000 (in four years, 1905-1908), and the\r\ndeposits by more than £8,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the Nation has one hundred and ten branch establishments\r\nscattered all over the Argentine, and their number is continually\r\nincreasing. Here are the figures relating to the three principal accounts\r\nin these branch establishments during the same period:——\r\n\r\n  Year.      Bills in Hand.        Overdrafts on       Deposits.\r\n                                 Current Accounts.\r\n  1904         £5,111,481             £3,744          £5,187,982\r\n  1905          6,987,847            349,427           6,842,559\r\n  1906          8,557,900            570,350           7,707,001\r\n  1907          9,848,713            860,899           8,433,003\r\n  1908         11,196,690            744,119          10,210,650\r\n\r\nWe find here, among the branch establishments, an increase of over\r\n£6,000,000 in the bills in hand; nearly £740,000 in the overdrafts on\r\ncurrent accounts; and over £5,000,000 on the deposits.\r\n\r\nThese exceedingly satisfactory results have been obtained by the National\r\nBank by means of a nominal capital of £9,680,000. We use the phrase\r\n“nominal capital” with intention, for although this sum figures on\r\nthe balance-sheets of the bank, we must remember that in this capital\r\nare included State bonds, which would have furnished, had they been\r\nnegotiated, an available sum of £3,212,000 in paper-money, and that the\r\nnet profits of the year 1908 are also included, amounting to £644,036 in\r\npaper, which by law must go to increase the “Capital and Reserve Funds.”\r\nThe two accounts, after the deduction of the sums accruing to them as\r\nprofit, amount respectively to £9,697,946 in paper-money and £1,303,248\r\nin gold. It follows from this that if the _Banco del Nacion_, instead of\r\nbeing an official institution, were an ordinary bank, it would have been\r\nable to pay its shareholders a dividend of 10 per cent. upon its paid-up\r\nshares.\r\n\r\nThe data we have just given prove abundantly that the Bank of the Nation\r\nhas been directed by a hand as firm as it is prudent, and there is every\r\nreason to suppose that it will continue in the future to serve public and\r\nprivate interests as well as it does to-day. The forecast we predicted\r\nin the first edition of this book will have proved mistaken; a forecast\r\nbased upon the authoritative opinion of an eminent Argentine statesman,\r\nwho affirmed that the official banks “bore within them the germs of the\r\nmoral and financial ruin of the country.” He even added that one should\r\nnever “incorporate a bank with the political administration of a State,\r\nbecause sooner or later it will be used as a political weapon.”\r\n\r\nWe must here pay our respects to the memory of Dr Ramon Santamarina, a\r\nformer president of the Administrative Council of this establishment,\r\nwhose premature death was a great loss to the bank and to the country. It\r\nis, indeed, to his intelligent and circumspect management of affairs that\r\nwe owe a great measure of the happy results obtained.\r\n\r\n_The Bank of the Province of Buenos Ayres._——There is in the Argentine\r\nanother important financial house: the _Banco de la Provincia de\r\nBuenos-Aires_, which has lately re-arisen from its ashes, by the aid of\r\nthe _Banco del Comercio Hispano-Americano_. This also was a victim of all\r\nkinds of abuses, committed to its detriment, by the administrations which\r\nsuccessively directed it.\r\n\r\nThe bank was reorganised in June 1906, with a capital of £1,760,000,\r\nof which sum half was furnished by the Government of the Province and\r\nhalf by the shareholders, with the proviso that this capital might be\r\nincreased to £4,400,000, which was done at the end of 1908. According\r\nto the business done by this bank from 1906 up to the present time, we\r\nmay predict for it a great future, provided that its presidents, learning\r\nfrom the past, guard it resolutely from the influence of political\r\nstruggles and the demoralising factions from which it has suffered in\r\nthe past. The new establishment enjoys all the prerogatives, exemptions\r\nand privileges which were accorded to the old bank; it is the obligatory\r\nreceptacle in which are deposited, gratuitously, the funds of the\r\nprovincial administrations and the courts.\r\n\r\nThe most delicate point in this conjunction, namely, the manner in\r\nwhich the administration of the bank should be conducted, has been so\r\ndetermined as to assure the preponderance of the private interests of the\r\nshareholders of the bank over the official interests of the Government.\r\nThe administration of the bank is confided to a council, composed of a\r\npresident appointed by the Government of the Province of Buenos Ayres,\r\nand twelve directors, four of whom are nominated by the Government and\r\neight by the private shareholders; an arrangement which constitutes an\r\nexcellent guarantee of proper management.\r\n\r\nFrom the balance-sheets of the last three years, and the figures\r\ncontained in the reports of the directing board, or Council of\r\nAdministration, we may judge the activity displayed by this bank, and the\r\nprogress realised since its re-establishment.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, are the amounts of the deposit accounts as taken upon\r\nthe 31st of December of each year, from 1906 to 1908 inclusive, as well\r\nas the bills in hand and the overdrafts on current accounts.\r\n\r\n                   Deposits.            Bills        Overdrafts on\r\n  Year.       Paper.[91]     Gold.      in Hand.     Current Accounts.\r\n  1906      £4,610,309    £179,431    £3,419,809        £467,342\r\n  1907       4,920,561     396,108     3,953,903         565,670\r\n  1908       5,716,441     409,690     4,785,044         477,310\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Actual value in gold.]\r\n\r\nThe extensive business done by this bank, which is evident from the\r\npreceding figures, has produced considerable profits, which amounted to\r\n£109,298 in 1906; £220,551 in 1907; and £246,884 in 1908.\r\n\r\nIn the latter year the net profits reached an average of 14·02 per cent.\r\nof the total capital. This flourishing state of affairs allowed of the\r\npayment to the shareholders of a dividend of 9·5 per cent. in 1907 and 10\r\nper cent. in 1908, without prejudice to the reserve funds, which amount\r\nto £73,920.\r\n\r\n_Money-lending or Mortgage Banks (Banques Hypothécaires)._ There are two\r\ngreat official institutions of this kind in the Argentine: the _Mortgage\r\nBank National_ is progressing in a normal manner; the other, the\r\n_Mortgage Bank of the Province of Buenos Ayres_, is painfully achieving\r\nthe process of liquidation.\r\n\r\nWe must explain that this institution, which worked for a number of years\r\nwith average regularity, collapsed violently in 1890, on account of the\r\nscandalous abuses committed by the management in the matter of loans, and\r\nthe pernicious introduction of electoral politics into the conduct of\r\nbusiness. This is one of the most lamentable pages of the administrative\r\nand financial history of the Argentine during the last few years.\r\n\r\nAfter numerous efforts had been made at various times with a view to\r\nmaking an arrangement between the bank and its creditors by means\r\nof an exchange of its bonds of mortgage for new bonds of the _Rente\r\nProvinciale_, a satisfactory agreement was at length arranged, which\r\nput an end to the irregular situation of the bank, in a manner as\r\nadvantageous for the creditors as for the Province.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report drawn up by the representative of the Government,\r\nthe liabilities of the bank amounted, on 30th June 1906, to £19,725,636;\r\nand to set against this colossal debt the bank possessed the assets,\r\nlargely precarious, represented by 503 loans on mortgage, of which the\r\nprincipal amounted to £1,967,704, while unpaid or overdue interest\r\naccounted for £6,568,440; or a nominal total of £8,536,140.\r\n\r\nThe assets also comprised certain other items, amounting to a total of\r\n£2,186,184.\r\n\r\nSome of these assets had a real value and could be considered as capable\r\nof realisation. Among these were: the money in the bank, the bank\r\npremises, the mortgages, and the special accounts with the Provincial\r\nGovernment; these items constituted the best class of assets. The\r\nremaining assets were more precarious, and their investigation gave rise\r\nto serious criticisms.\r\n\r\nTwo classes of assets, for example, which were apparently of considerable\r\nimportance——those relating to hypothecary credit and to personal\r\nshares——were far from representing the value which was shown on the\r\nbalance-sheet.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the probabilities of the realisation of certain\r\nclasses of assets, in case of need, a liability of £19,725,636 was\r\nopposed by assets equivalent to £6,242,039, leaving a deficit of\r\n£13,583,595. In other words, the assets represented only 31 per cent. of\r\nthe liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe Government’s representative, having analysed the effective revenue\r\nat the disposal of the Province, and allowing for the probable progress\r\nby which it might benefit in the immediate future, declared that the\r\nPublic Treasury could not put aside more than £308,000 for the purpose\r\nof guaranteeing the dividends on the shares of the Bank; but that this\r\nsum would probably be increased by £44,000 during the next five years,\r\nand by £48,400 at the end of ten years; thus assuring the creditors of\r\nan interest of 3-1/2 per cent., and a proportional amortisation of 1/2\r\nper cent. An arrangement on this basis was proposed to the creditors of\r\nthe Bank at a general meeting, held at la Plata in November 1906, and was\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nWe must add that at the present time the Provincial Government is\r\nconsidering a scheme designed to infuse new life into the _Mortgage\r\nBank_. This system consists of founding a limited company in which both\r\npublic and private interests would be represented; a state of affairs\r\nvery like that already in existence, and yielding excellent results, in\r\nthe case of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nThe great official establishment for loans on mortgage in the Argentine\r\nis the _Banco Hipotecario Nacional_. This bank grants loans upon real\r\nestate in the capital, provinces, and national territories. It issues\r\ncedulas which bear an interest of 5 to 6 per cent., with an amortisation\r\nrate of 1 to 4 per cent., which are quoted at about par on the market, so\r\nthat the holder, after the deduction of expenses and commissions, obtains\r\na satisfactory interest. The value of cedulas in circulation at the end\r\nof 1908 amounted to £11,871,108 in paper (actual value) and £1,876,530 in\r\ngold, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these official establishments, there are various private\r\ncompanies, founded by means of foreign capital, which issue loans on\r\nreal estate in the capital of the Republic and on land in some of the\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\nAccording to our information, these companies employ a capital of nearly\r\n£15,000,000, divided as follows:\r\n\r\n  Argentine Railway Loan Co., Ltd.                    £827,600\r\n  River Plate Trust Loan and Agency Co.              2,705,422\r\n  Société de Crédit Foncier de Santa Fé                511,120\r\n  Mortgage Co. of the River Plate                    1,997,717\r\n  River Plate and Gal.

Plata         286,194\r\n  Argentine Mortgage and Agricultural Co.               80,000\r\n  The Standard                                         541,488\r\n  Crédit Foncier Argentine                           3,016,340\r\n  Compagnie Pastorale Belge Sud.-Americaine          1,350,102\r\n  Société Hypothécaire Belge-Argentine               1,583,130\r\n  Banque Hypothécaire Franco-Argentine               1,487,160\r\n  Société Rurale de Bahia Blanca                         3,960\r\n                                                  ------------\r\n                                                   £14,894,233\r\n                                                  ============\r\n\r\nHigh as these figures are, however, they represent only a portion of the\r\nforeign capital employed in this class of transactions, for considerable\r\nsums are advanced by private persons who wish to obtain the high interest\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\nThese companies lend only gold, that they may escape the fluctuations of\r\nthe paper-money market, and usually limit their operations to dealing\r\nwith properties in the capital or in the Province of Buenos Ayres, doing\r\nbusiness with the rest of the country only in a very limited degree.\r\nAlthough Argentine legislation is extremely advanced in the matter of\r\nloans and mortgages, the lender fears, in the case of certain provinces,\r\nto encounter difficulties in practice, or delays of legal procedure in\r\nthe case of foreclosing. The interest on mortgages, which during the year\r\n1908 was maintained at about 9 per cent., is to-day showing a tendency to\r\nfall, on account of the abundance of money in the Buenos Ayres market;\r\nthe rate is now as low as 8 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is in the capital of the Argentine that mortgage operations are most\r\nactive. During the decade 1889-1908 the amount of loans upon property\r\nreached the sum of £37,241,000. This amount was lent upon 40,996\r\nproperties; and of this total £7,603,000 was lent in 1908 alone. The\r\nmortgages effected upon rural properties, throughout the entire Republic,\r\nfor the years 1903 to 1907 inclusive, amounted to £37,920,000, and the\r\nmortgaged property amounted to nearly 80,000,000 acres. In this total the\r\nProvince of Buenos Ayres was represented by £16,880,000; that of Santa Fé\r\nby £3,240,000; that of Córdoba by £6,240,000.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic possesses one of the most perfect systems of\r\nmortgage in existence among modern nations. To prove this statement\r\nwe need only explain that the Argentine laws do not recognise secret\r\nmortgages; nor do they admit any privileges in favour of married women or\r\nminors in respect of special mortgages. Neither does such a thing exist\r\nas a general mortgage, nor are there any privileges taking precedence\r\nover the right of the mortgagee.\r\n\r\nThe mortgage, like every action which affects or modifies the right of\r\nthe proprietor over immovable property, must be signed before a notary\r\nand registered by the Conservator of Mortgages. Before drawing up the\r\ndeed, the notary must, as in the case of sales, demand a certificate\r\nstating whether the property is or is not free from charges. Although the\r\nright of the proprietor is perfect as to possession, the law tends to\r\ngive property a certain degree of mobility; thus for this reason the term\r\nof a sale with power of redemption is three years, the term of a lease\r\nten years, and that of the registration of a mortgage ten years; but all\r\nthese terms may be renewed upon expiration. The term of ten years in the\r\ncase of mortgages does not affect the _Banco Hypotecario National_, nor\r\nthe _Banque Hypothécaire de Buenos Ayres_, nor the _Banque Hypothécaire\r\nde la Capitale_, in virtue of the special laws which created these\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n_The Bourse or Exchange._——The first Commercial Exchange or Bourse, or\r\nlet us rather say the first institution to fulfil the functions of an\r\nexchange or Bourse, for we cannot give that name to the market which\r\nformerly existed in Buenos Ayres, was inaugurated in 1810 under the\r\nname of the Chamber of Commerce——_Sala de Comercio_. It was composed\r\nexclusively of members of the English colony, and offered them, besides\r\nthe usual advantages of such establishments, the attraction of a\r\nwell-furnished library.\r\n\r\nThe documents available do not tell us how long this institution lasted,\r\nnor whether at a later period it opened its doors to the Argentine\r\nelement nor whether, being finally transformed, it served as a basis for\r\nthe organisation of the exchange as it is to-day. The only thing certain\r\nis that in July 1834 the first members of the association met in the Via\r\nSan Martin, there to establish the Bourse, of which the inauguration took\r\nplace on the 1st of December following.\r\n\r\nBefore this date there was a financial group known as the “Sociedad\r\nParticular de Corredores,” which was known as the _Camuati_, and which\r\nbusied itself with mercantile transactions.\r\n\r\nThe Bourse retained its original premises until the year 1862, when it\r\nwas installed in another building in the same street, at present occupied\r\nby the Caisse de Conversion, or Bank of Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome years later, the premises being too small, it was proposed to build\r\nother and far larger premises, sufficient to meet the ever-increasing\r\ndemands of the institution. In 1881 an extraordinary general meeting was\r\nheld, with a view to forming a company to undertake the construction of\r\npremises to house the “Sociedad Bolsa de Comercio.” But the company was\r\nnot formed until 1883, when it acquired the site on which the Bourse now\r\nstands; and its official inauguration took place two years later.\r\n\r\nSince then the Commercial Exchange has enjoyed a period of continued\r\nprosperity; it is to-day the first commercial centre of Latin America.\r\nIt exercises a great influence over the commercial and economic life of\r\nthe Republic. It is the sole establishment of its kind, having judicial\r\npowers, open to all mercantile transactions, and establishing, under\r\nthe stress of supply and demand, the prices of the products of labour\r\nor commerce. Having the power of fixing the value of merchandise by\r\nquotations of paper-money, it is, more than any other institution,\r\nliable to exceed its functions; but it bears within itself, in its\r\nadmirable organisation, the means of repairing its own errors and of\r\nremaining the faithful regulator of prices and values.\r\n\r\nThe most eloquent commentary upon the importance of the operations\r\neffected by the _Bourse de Commerce_ is the simple enumeration of their\r\nvalue at various periods, for we then realise the enormous development\r\nwhich they have achieved in a period relatively short. In 1886 the\r\ntotal of the business done was $173,000,000 paper, £34,600,000 face\r\nvalue; in 1887 it was $254,000,000 (£50,800,000); in 1888 $432,000,000\r\n(£86,400,000); in 1889 $469,000,000 (£93,800,000). The total value of\r\nall business effected, liquidated or not, cash or credit, during the\r\nyears 1890 and 1891, amounted to $18,000,000,000 (£1,584,000,000) and\r\n$7,000,000,000 (£616,000,000), respectively.[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: The values before 1900 are face values, as the actual value\r\nof the piastre note fluctuated. They must not be taken as actual values\r\nany more than in the case of Indian rupees.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThese figures, in their simplicity, cover the history of an interesting\r\nperiod of the financial life of the country. The wave of speculation\r\nwhich turned all men’s heads began to rise as early as 1887, and in\r\n1891 was at its greatest height; it then crumbled into foam, having\r\nshattered the most deeply-rooted of banking houses, compromised the\r\nnational credit, changed brilliant illusions into melancholy realities,\r\nand sown desolation and ruin in many a home. After the catastrophe\r\nthe total value of business done rapidly fell, and we see it falling\r\nviolently from one year to another——from the $18,000,000,000 of 1890\r\nthrough the $3,376,000,000 of 1895, to the $835,000,000 of 1900; a year\r\nwhich experienced a condition of affairs which was destined to produce a\r\nbeneficent influence upon the economic life of the country.\r\n\r\nIn this total of $835,000,000 of paper-money we find that transactions in\r\ngold amounted to $774,000,000 paper money, corresponding to $66,800,000\r\nof gold negotiated; while in 1899, the whole business done in the Bourse\r\nstill amounted to the respectable sum of $1,295,000,000 paper, of which\r\n$1,234,000,000 represented operations in gold. From one year to another\r\nthe total sum of the business transacted in the Bourse had diminished by\r\n$460,000,000 (paper).\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of this notable decrease was the “law of monetary\r\nconversion.”\r\n\r\nThis law, which has been in force since 1890, fixed the value of 44\r\ncentavos, or $44 gold, for the future conversion of paper-money, and\r\nenacted that the Caisse de Conversion should receive the gold and deliver\r\npaper, and _vice versa_, at this same rate: a rate equivalent to 227·27\r\nper cent. The effect of this reform was thus, if not to destroy, at least\r\nvery largely to limit unbridled speculation, which made itself especially\r\nfelt in the value of the paper piastre.\r\n\r\nSpeculation in gold being suppressed, the volume of business transacted\r\non the Bourse de Commerce of Buenos Ayres grew gradually less and less,\r\nfalling finally, in 1904, to $37,312,000 paper, of which $19,968 stood\r\nfor gold.\r\n\r\nAfter 1904 the total sum of these operations was still further reduced,\r\nthe figures for 1908 being incredibly low. Thus the total, which in\r\n1905 had attained £45,400,000, rose to £57,800,000 in 1906, fell in\r\n1907 to £16,880,000, and in 1908 to £12,560,000. To-day the activity of\r\nspeculators is concentrated upon operations in mortgage bonds and the\r\nshares of various companies; each class of operations amounting to some\r\n£5,000,000. These figures show that the Bourse de Commerce loses from day\r\nto day some part of its importance as the regulating centre of mercantile\r\ntransactions; but it would be an error to measure the economic vitality\r\nof the Republic by the amount of business effected on the Bourse, since\r\nan examination of the situation shows us that the Argentine has never\r\nknown a period of more obvious prosperity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving explained the new phase upon which the Buenos Ayres Bourse has\r\nentered, we must now consider its organisation and its usages, and the\r\nregulations under which it operates.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we must remark that the Bourse is not an official\r\ninstitution, but a private establishment, founded and supported by a\r\nlimited liability company, the “Bolso de Comercio,” which is recognised\r\nas a judicial body.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to other Exchanges, and that of New York in particular,\r\nthe number of shareholders is unlimited, and varies from time to time.\r\nIn 1886 there were 2959; in 1891, 4901; in May 1905, 3709. To become a\r\nmember of the Bourse one must be presented by two shareholders, admitted\r\nby the Council Chamber or Committee (_Chambre Syndicate_), and must pay a\r\nmoderate entrance fee, as well as an annual subscription.\r\n\r\nAccording to its rules, the object of the Bourse de Commerce is to\r\n“offer a place of meeting to these members, where they may discuss and\r\neffect all manner of lawful business; and to facilitate and negotiate\r\nall commercial operations by giving them security and legality.” It also\r\nundertakes to represent commerce and production in general before the\r\nauthorities of the country, or before private undertakings; it supports\r\npetitions relative to their interests, in order that laws about to be\r\nproposed, or those which are being adopted, shall be equitable and shall\r\nfavour the development of commercial transactions. Its object is both to\r\nensure the unity of commercial usages, and in case of need to take the\r\ninitiative in all questions of economics which may affect commerce in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe management of the Bourse is effected by the Council Chamber——the\r\n_Chambre Syndical de la Bourse_, which is entrusted with the general and\r\nofficial representation of the institution. It is this authority which\r\npermits or refuses the official quotation of all stocks, shares, loans,\r\netc., issued according to the laws of the country of their origin and by\r\nlegally constituted bodies.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the stockbroker can only be fulfilled by persons\r\npreviously authorised by the Council Chamber, after they have\r\naccomplished certain formalities, and have proved whether they have\r\nattained their legal majority, have experience of business, and have\r\nenjoyed a good reputation, all of which must be guaranteed by three men\r\nof business of known responsibility. The number of such brokers is not\r\nlimited, and may be increased or decreased according to circumstances. In\r\n1905, for instance, their number was 385. They are not obliged to give\r\nsecurity nor to make any deposit as guarantee before practising; they\r\nhave merely to pay a small monthly subscription.\r\n\r\nThe regulations of the Bourse contain severe provisions against brokers\r\nwho infringe any of the numerous prohibitions affecting them; such as\r\naccepting orders from clients whose identity has not been proved; from\r\npersons known to be insolvent, or from incapable persons; or acting as\r\nintermediary in negotiations where there is reason to suspect that the\r\nparties involved are not proceeding seriously. Brokers who infringe these\r\nrules or others——who do not, for example, meet their engagements——are\r\nsuspended by the Council Chamber of the Exchange.\r\n\r\nAll operations must be declared in an audible voice by the stockbroker\r\nto the recorder (annotator), in order that the latter may inscribe\r\nthem upon the blackboard. The vendor and the buyer must then exchange\r\nmemoranda, in order that the transaction shall be definitely confirmed\r\nand made valid. All transactions effected on exchange[93] during official\r\nhours are copied, with the prices, from the blackboard into the Journal\r\nof Sales; these latter being also published in the _Boletin de la Bolsa\r\nde Comercio_; or, as we should say, the Stock Exchange Bulletin. The\r\nsettlement of all transactions concluded is effected through the Council\r\nChamber, with the aid of the _Bureau de Liquidation_, or Settlement\r\nOffice, under the supervision of an official liquidator, appointed\r\nat a general meeting of the brokers, who charges a percentage on the\r\nsettlements which he effects.[94]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Literally, “at the basket.”——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: The brokerage in 1/4 per cent. on the sale or purchase of\r\nbonds, shares, debentures, etc., and is charged on the face (or nominal)\r\nvalue of the amount changing hands. A charge of 1/2 per cent. is also\r\nmade on all operations on Exchange.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal rules of the organic charter which regulates the\r\noperations of the Stock Exchange of Buenos Ayres, and such is its method\r\nof operation. Let us now examine the total amount of its operations\r\nduring the period 1895-1908, and how they may be analysed:——\r\n\r\n  Year.               Piastres (Paper).

If this law had had no other effect, this result alone would\r\nhave justified it as wholly beneficial to the interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the quotations of the above period mortgage bonds hold the second\r\nplace; they represent about 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nBeing dominated by the spirit of speculation, which expended itself\r\nprincipally, indeed almost exclusively, upon monetary transactions, the\r\nBourse had no time to devote itself to more legitimate business. Thus\r\nthe public funds represented only some 3 per cent. of this total; then\r\ncame shares and debentures of various companies; and last of all banking\r\nshares, the amount of these being insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe nominal value of all the securities which were quoted on the Buenos\r\nAyres Bourse in 1907 amounted to $554,791,932 paper and $127,763,525\r\ngold, or an actual total of £74,374,395, and an analysis gives the\r\nfollowing results:——\r\n\r\n                                Dollars (Paper).

We have seen this in the case of Italy\r\nand Austria, which had an important foreign debt in France, and have\r\nconsiderably reduced it during these last ten years of economic progress.\r\n\r\nIt will certainly be the same in the case of the Argentine when, thanks\r\nto a series of good harvests, its available or fluid assets have\r\nincreased beyond what is absolutely necessary for the development of\r\nagriculture. Investments will be made not only in land or in live stock,\r\nbut money will be invested in stocks and shares as well, and notably in\r\nthe Government stock of the country.\r\n\r\nAs a symptom of this tendency, we may mention that interest on the\r\nforeign debt, the coupons for which have hitherto been payable abroad\r\nonly, is now payable in the Argentine as well, in order to facilitate\r\nthe purchase of this stock in the Republic as a staple investment. The\r\ninternal debt is also the object of more extensive operations, now that\r\nthe seventeen loans which constituted the old debt have been unified,\r\nand now that a special call is to be made upon the internal credit of\r\nthe county with a view to undertaking vast public works. To enlarge the\r\nmarket for this Government stock the authorities have just decided that\r\nits coupons shall be payable on the principal foreign markets.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the course of time the market for industrial stock, bank\r\nstock, and railway shares will gradually become less restricted, in\r\nproportion as the public fortune becomes more extensively subdivided,\r\ninstead of being concentrated, as it is at present, in a comparatively\r\nsmall number of hands. The only thing that may compromise this future is\r\nthe excessive speculation which we find, unhappily only too often, in\r\na country where gambling is a dominant instinct. This excess, with its\r\nnatural sequelæ in the form of financial crises, might end by driving all\r\nserious clients from the Bourse, and in destroying the excellent elements\r\nwhich Buenos Ayres possesses for the creation of an important financial\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n_Limited Companies._——In the vast progressive movement which increases\r\nin force yearly throughout the Argentine Republic, the Bourse of Buenos\r\nAyres has yet another part to play: that is, to facilitate the formation\r\nof collectivities of capital under the form of joint-stock companies,\r\nsince the spirit of enterprise exhibits itself by preference under this\r\nform. Collective effort is to-day more and more replacing individual\r\neffort; the Argentine must therefore learn how to employ this weapon\r\nof associated capital in order to promote new undertakings, and, by\r\npopularising movable values or securities by the help of the Bourse, to\r\nraise up new resources to the country’s profit.\r\n\r\nOur study of the chief manifestations of Argentine life and its\r\ncommercial machinery would thus be incomplete if we did not give some\r\naccount of the public companies of the Argentine, the legal formalities\r\ndemanded of them upon their formation, their mechanism, and the\r\nvicissitudes through which they have passed at various interesting\r\nperiods of Argentine history.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of public companies is subjected by the Commercial Code\r\nto rigid formalities, in accordance with the most advanced principles of\r\nuniversal legislation upon such matters, in order to assure their proper\r\noperation as well as the interests of the shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe indispensable conditions of the formation of such companies are\r\nthe following: the number of associates must not be more than ten; the\r\ncapital of the venture, or its first issue, must not be less than 20 per\r\ncent. of the total, and must be entirely paid up; the shareholders must\r\ncontribute 10 per cent. of the capital actually subscribed, a sum which\r\nmust be deposited in an official or private bank; the company must be\r\nconstituted for a fixed term, and must be authorised by the Government,\r\nwhich cannot refuse its authorisation if the functions, organisation,\r\nand articles of the company are in conformity with the code, and if its\r\nobject is not contrary to the public interests.\r\n\r\nTo gain the right to publish the prospectus appealing to possible\r\nshareholders, the company must also conform to the following rules: it\r\nmust indicate the date of the provisional formation of the company,\r\nmust mention the place where the charter of the company was drawn up\r\nand registered, and what journals have published the articles and the\r\nGovernmental authorisation; it must give details of the object of the\r\ncompany, its capital, the number of shares, and the conditions of\r\nsubscription and payment; it must explain the exceptional advantages\r\nclaimed by the founders of the company, and convoke the subscribers to a\r\ngeneral meeting, which must take place within three months, at which the\r\ncompany shall be definitively constituted.\r\n\r\nThe law formally forbids the founders of limited companies to reserve\r\nany sum or advantage whatever, in the form of shares, debentures, or\r\nfounders’ shares, in exchange for concessions gratuitously granted by the\r\nGovernment. It concedes them a maximum of 10 per cent. of the capital, or\r\n10 per cent. of the realised and liquid profits during a term which must\r\nnot exceed ten years.\r\n\r\nThe founders or administrators of any company are responsible, jointly\r\nand severally and without any limit, for all that has been done in the\r\nname of the company up to the time of its definitive constitution,\r\nwithout appeal against the latter, if it take place.\r\n\r\nIf the company be finally constituted, the expenses and the consequences\r\nof all proceedings undertaken to that end by the founders will be charged\r\nagainst the exclusive account of these latter, nor will they have any\r\nresort or recourse to appeal against the subscribers.\r\n\r\nIn the case of limited companies which are not legally constituted,\r\nthe founders, administrators and representatives are, conjointly and\r\nseverally and without limit, required to restore any sums they may have\r\nreceived for shares issued, and also to pay the debts of administration\r\nand the losses that may be incurred by third parties by the failure to\r\nfulfil obligations contracted in the name of the company.\r\n\r\nOnce a limited company is constituted, its administrators contract no\r\ncommon or personal responsibility for the engagements of the company, but\r\nthey are responsible, personally and conjointly, to the company and to\r\nthird parties, for the failure of execution or the improper employment\r\nof their mandate, and also for the violation of laws, regulations, and\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\nAll companies are obliged to appoint at least once a year a censor chosen\r\nby the general meeting, who directly represents the shareholders, and who\r\nsupervises the proper conduct of the company, and the accomplishment of\r\nthe legal formalities which concern it.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Code contains many other enactments which tend to ensure\r\nthe correct and legal constitution, as well as the proper conduct, of\r\nlimited companies: but those we have cited will suffice to show that the\r\nlaw-maker has striven to use the utmost foresight, with the object of\r\nguaranteeing the interests and the capital confided to such companies.\r\n\r\nDespite this prudence and foresight, we are forced to recognise that the\r\ninstitution of such companies, which constitutes a powerful economic\r\nlever when they are correctly administered and established with a view to\r\ncommercial and industrial utility, is at present discredited on account\r\nof the abuses committed in its name at the time of the great crisis of\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nThe institution of limited companies is so intimately connected with\r\nthe financial disasters of that period that its history is to a\r\ncertain extent the history of speculation, and it has suffered all the\r\nvicissitudes of speculation.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, when Buenos Ayres was federalised and became the permanent\r\ncapital of the Republic; when public tranquillity was confirmed, with\r\nthe conviction that it would be long before it was disturbed; when the\r\npublic expenditure was increased, thanks to the employment of credit and\r\nthe issue of paper currency; when, in short, the prospect of universal\r\nprosperity had awakened energy and initiative; there began to pass\r\nthrough the country a light breeze of speculation, which was soon to\r\nbecome a tempest; and the limited company, which until that time had\r\nexisted in a modest, inconspicuous degree, quickly assumed a greater\r\nimportance, with a more definite, more concrete form.\r\n\r\nThe companies floated in 1882 and in the three following years were not\r\nvery numerous, and their capital was insignificant as compared with\r\nthe capital of those that followed: yet a very marked impulse towards\r\nprogress was already perceptible, as much in numbers as in capital.\r\nThus the sum of 10 million piastres, the amount of the nominal capital\r\ndeclared by the limited companies in 1882, rose to nearly 13 millions in\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nBut as the fever of speculation and affairs grew higher and ever higher,\r\nthanks to the aid of the credit too liberally granted by the banks,\r\nwhether mortgage or money-lending banks or otherwise, and as at the same\r\ntime all the paper thrown upon the market was immediately absorbed, to\r\nthe great profit of those who issued it, the limited company followed\r\nthe upward march, although this movement did not always correspond with\r\nthe idea of progress. Thus we see with surprise that from 13 millions\r\nof piastres (paper) in 1885, the capital of the companies rises to 34\r\nmillions in 1886, to 95 millions in 1887, to 196 millions in 1888, and in\r\n1889 to 378 millions; and in these two latter years the fever has reached\r\nthe period of greatest danger.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the economic-financial crisis, long delayed by artificial means,\r\nburst over the country with terrible force, and a revolution broke out\r\nsimultaneously. Under the weight of this double disaster the banking\r\nhouses tottered on their foundations, soon to fall in ruin; credit,\r\npersonal or secured, vanished absolutely; the paper currency, already\r\ndepreciated, fell to a still lower value; industry and commerce were\r\narrested in their progress, and the whirligig of speculation, which had\r\nso far gone merrily but giddily round, came to an abrupt standstill. As\r\na natural reaction, the formation of companies, which speculation had\r\nstimulated to excess, was stricken with an almost complete paralysis; so\r\nthat we see the capital of these companies, which in 1889 had risen to\r\n378 millions of piastres, fall in 1890 to 190 millions, and finally, in\r\n1891, to the modest sum of 13 millions.\r\n\r\nThese, rapidly denoted, are the salient lines of a sketch of the\r\nvicissitudes of speculation and the affairs of the capital during the\r\nlast ten years; a picture which begins with the rosy tints of hope and\r\nillusion, and ends in the sombre colours of bankruptcy and ruin.\r\n\r\nThe branches of trade and industry which are most largely represented by\r\nthe limited company form another question of interest. It is certainly\r\nvery difficult to discover the true social idea which these companies\r\npursue at flotation, for behind pompous titles which seem to express\r\na true national progress, such as the construction of harbours, the\r\nfoundation of colonies, the building or management of railways or\r\ntramways, the opening up of new districts by means of canals, etc., there\r\nlurks, only too often, a mere scheme of speculation in shares or land.\r\nJudging, however, by the actual operations effected by these companies\r\nduring the course of their existence, we can class them according to the\r\nobject declared at the time of flotation, and at the same time give the\r\nstatistics of their capital.\r\n\r\nThe capital of all the companies floated since 1882 amounts to 950\r\nmillions of piastres (paper), or £83,600,000. Of this sum £14,320,000 was\r\nfrankly intended to promote speculation in land; £13,200,000 was applied\r\nto railways (including the purchase of the railways of the Province of\r\nBuenos Ayres); £12,144,000 to insurance (a form of employing capital much\r\nin vogue at the time), and £12,056,000 to banking affairs, which in some\r\ncases were only the mask of speculations in stock and in land.\r\n\r\nTo make our sketch complete we ought to give, instead of the nominal\r\ncapital declared by these companies, the capital actually paid up;\r\nas we know that it is not every company that has at its disposal the\r\nsum mentioned in its articles, but that many have to be content with\r\nthe payment of one or two instalments, while others cannot even find\r\nsubscribers. Knowing these data, and being cognisant of the present\r\ncondition of the companies, we should then be able to estimate the\r\namount of loss which they have inflicted upon the country.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this investigation is impossible, for lack of information,\r\nand we can only state that millions of pounds of private fortunes were\r\nlost or stolen in the limited companies of the period.\r\n\r\nAfter the crisis of 1890 there was, as there was bound to be, a great\r\nmental reaction; especially in matters relating to the institution of the\r\nlimited company; and the latter was so discredited that for several years\r\nnot a penny could be obtained for investment in undertakings of the kind.\r\n\r\nBut it was not possible that such an important element of economic\r\nprogress should be entirely suppressed on account of the abuses committed\r\nin its name. Very slowly it came into favour once more; but thanks to the\r\nlessons of experience the new companies were concerned in the foundation\r\nof undertakings of genuine industrial and commercial value. Thus the\r\ncompanies floated in 1902, 1903, and 1904 represented a nominal capital\r\nof $803,979,000 paper (£70,950,352 actual value), and those founded from\r\n1905 to 1908 (inclusive) had a nominal capital of £72,573,445, which may\r\nbe analysed as follows:——\r\n\r\n  Land                                  £1,676,959\r\n  Railways                               6,059,791·7\r\n  Insurance                             13,593,981·5\r\n  Banks                                  9,251,958·1\r\n  Industry                               7,295,793·2\r\n  Commerce                               6,856,762·3\r\n  Agriculture and stock-raising          7,218,579·7\r\n  Navigation                               440,000·0\r\n  Colonisation and Immigration             203,996·3\r\n  Tramways                               5,113,303·1\r\n  Hygiene                                  564,759·5\r\n  Telephones and telegraphs              1,349,983·8\r\n  Mines                                  7,332,286\r\n  Mortgage Companies and Real Estate\r\n  Companies                              4,098,448·1\r\n  Gas and electric lighting                759,249\r\n  Savings Banks                            667,598·8\r\n                                       -------------\r\n  Total                                £72,573,450\r\n                                       =============\r\n\r\nThe mere list of the above investments is enough to convince us that\r\nthe day of merely speculative companies is over, when shares were mere\r\ntravesties, more or less justified, as in the years which preceded the\r\ncrisis of 1890. Now speculation in land is represented by a sum of less\r\nthan £1,700,000; while insurance is represented by over 13 millions,\r\nbanks by more than 9 millions, industry by 7 millions, agriculture by 7\r\nmillions, and mines by about the same amount. These latter investments\r\nbelong to the category of “eruptive” stock, for, like a volcanic\r\neruption, they rise suddenly to great heights, to fall, a little later,\r\nleaving nothing but smoke and ashes.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of company formation, as in the matter of operations of\r\nthe Bourse, we see that the Argentine has re-entered the normal path of\r\nprogress. Under these two manifestations, which reflect the economic\r\nactivity of the country, the tide of affairs continues to increase, but\r\nthe spirit of speculation no longer turns it aside, no longer undermines\r\nthe organisation of the nation’s commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART IV\r\n\r\n                           ARGENTINE FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                          THE ARGENTINE BUDGET\r\n\r\nThe financial situation——Continual increase of national\r\n    expenditure——Great and rapid progress since 1891——Insufficiency\r\n    of the means adopted to moderate this increase——The Budget\r\n    Extraordinary and the Special Legislation Budget.\r\n\r\nCauses of this increase of national expenditure——The increase of\r\n    administrative requirements caused by an increasing population;\r\n    this is the most natural cause, and that most easily justified——\r\n    Increase of the public debt——The intervention of the State as\r\n    the promoter or guarantor of important public undertakings——\r\n    Exaggerated military expenses.\r\n\r\nThe total sum of national, provincial, and municipal expenses.\r\n    The proportion per inhabitant——Comparison with other foreign\r\n    countries in the matter of administrative expenses.\r\n\r\nThe national revenue——The revenue as organised by the Constitution,\r\n    and its analysis——Indirect taxation——The customs the chief\r\n    source of revenue——Direct taxation; its origin in the\r\n    Argentine; its justification; its yield——Revenue of the\r\n    industrial undertakings belonging to the State: railways,\r\n    sewers, posts and telegraphs——The exploitation of the State\r\n    lands.\r\n\r\nElasticity of the receipts, which follow the development and\r\n    progress of the country——The accelerated increase of\r\n    expenditure, and the resulting chronic deficit——Necessity of\r\n    serious reforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of an increase in the national expenditure: a phenomenon\r\nwhich makes itself felt under monarchies as well as under republics, in\r\nthose countries which have long centuries of life behind them, as in\r\nthose whose independent existence has barely begun: this phenomenon is\r\nfelt in the Argentine Republic more keenly than in the older nations of\r\nEurope. Our book would present a serious lacuna if we did not, before\r\nspeaking of the increase of the Argentine budgets, inquire first of all,\r\nas closely as we can in a work of information, what are the causes which\r\nhave led to this continual increase in the national expenses. We must\r\nknow, in short, whether this increase is due to general causes, produced\r\nby administrative necessities, and connected with the mere progress of\r\nthe country, or whether on the contrary it arises from special factors,\r\npeculiar to the social and political conditions of the country, and to\r\nthe practical defects of its Government. If we examine the amounts of\r\nthe Argentine budgets for a number of years, we shall see that, with a\r\nfew rare exceptions, they have always increased, and at a more or less\r\nextraordinary rate. Even in the years when the country was groaning under\r\nsome profound economic or financial crisis the same thing was to be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nNot to go back too far in our retrospective study, let us take as a\r\npoint of departure the year 1891, which year is a veritable landmark in\r\nthe history of the Argentine people, since it was in that year that the\r\npolitical and financial crisis which broke over the country attained its\r\ngreatest intensity. We find that in 1891 the expenditure authorised by\r\nthe national budget——not the expenditure actually effected, with which\r\nwe shall deal further on——amounted to $41,230,349 paper and $20,315,446\r\ngold, or some 31 millions in gold, or £6,200,000.\r\n\r\nFive years later——in 1895——this expenditure had increased to $76,000,000\r\npaper and $15,000,000 gold, or $37,000,000 in gold, or £7,400,000. Since\r\nthen, with rare exceptions, the budgets have followed an ascending scale.\r\nIf, indeed, we concern ourselves with the sums actually realised, instead\r\nof those proposed by the budgets, we find that the amounts of the later\r\nbudgets are these: in 1898, $75,000,000 gold and $119,000,000 paper,\r\nor $121,000,000 in gold, or £24,200,000; in 1899, $31,000,000 gold and\r\n$104,000,000 paper, or $77,000,000 in gold, or £15,400,000; in 1900,\r\n$24,000,000 gold and $105,000,000 paper, or $69,000,000 in gold, or\r\n£13,800,000. Reducing to gold the sums estimated in paper, we find that\r\nsince 1901, that is, since the time when the value of the currency was\r\nestablished on a fixed basis, the following sums have been expended: in\r\n1901, £14,200,000; in 1902, £17,600,000; in 1903, £15,600,000; in 1904,\r\n£17,200,000; in 1907, £20,200,000; in 1908, £20,200,000; there has thus\r\nbeen a rapid progress.\r\n\r\nThe budget for 1909 amounts to $270,000,000 paper, or £23,812,800. In\r\nthis total are comprised two items: one of 15 millions of piastres in\r\npaper, value £1,320,000; the other of 3 millions, or £264,000, which are\r\nset aside to meet the expenses of the _fêtes_ of the first Centenary\r\nof the National Revolution. If we subtract these two items, which are\r\nnecessitated by extraordinary expenses, we find that the increase of the\r\nadministrative expenditure over that of 1908 amounts to £1,760,000.\r\n\r\nWe ought here to remark that these figures do not include the sums\r\nrealised by the Government by means of the issue of stock: a procedure\r\nwhich constitutes an interesting chapter of Argentine finance.\r\n\r\nWe see, from these data, that the increase of the national expenditure is\r\na constant, almost an inevitable factor, which occurs year by year in the\r\nArgentine administration. It now remains for us to inquire if unavoidable\r\ncauses exist which force the State to spend without reflection, and,\r\nwhen funds are lacking, to contract loans which grievously burden the\r\nfuture; or whether, on the contrary, we have here a fault rooted in the\r\nsoil of new countries which have no serious administrative traditions,\r\nand in which the spirit of order and economy has not yet grown to the\r\nstature of a national virtue. In the Argentine Republic the increase\r\nof public expenditure responds to causes which differ from those which\r\nare active in the countries of Europe; though we do not say that the\r\nlatter do not also exercise their influence. A new country, inhabited\r\nby a sparsely-settled population, in possession of a rich but desert\r\nterritory, its economic organism as yet barely developed, the Argentine\r\nhas not yet produced a class of men practised in and prepared for\r\npractical administration. It is, on the contrary, afflicted with\r\nundisciplined political parties, full of impatience and of ideas of\r\nprogress which cannot be immediately realised. It is not surprising that\r\nin the Argentine the increase of public expenditure responds to causes\r\nunlike those to be observed in other States, which number the years of\r\ntheir lives in centuries; which enjoy perfected administrations, possess\r\na large class of men prepared for the science of government and finance,\r\nand whose needs, far from increasing, tend to restrain such expenditure.\r\n\r\nSo, considering the question under its most general aspect, we believe\r\nwe shall not depart very far from the truth if we suggest, as the\r\ncauses which produce the constant increase of the Argentine budgets,\r\nthe following facts: (1) the increase of administrative requirements,\r\ncaused by the increase of the population; (2) the increase of the public\r\ndebt; (3) the depreciation of the currency until a recent period, and the\r\nincreasing dearness of the necessities of life; (4) national and foreign\r\nwars (which causes now belong to history, and have happily ceased to\r\nexercise their influence in the Argentine); (5) the intervention of the\r\nState as manager or promoter of expensive public works; (6) the cost of\r\nan imperfect and expensive administrative machinery, and the wastefulness\r\nof the Government and of Congress; (7) a lack of control in the handling\r\nof revenue and expenditure; (8) increased military expenditure. Under\r\nthis last heading we may include the heavy expenses which the Government\r\nhas been forced to meet in order to maintain the integrity of its\r\nfrontier and to avoid a war with Chili. Between 1889 and 1903 it has\r\nemployed for this purpose a sum of £13,000,000.\r\n\r\nA brief examination of each of these causes will suffice to show that\r\nthey have been truly presented, and will also demonstrate the degree in\r\nwhich the phenomenon we are studying exhibits itself.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the first factor is assured and indisputable; it is\r\nenough to enounce it; it will be admitted without further criticism.\r\nThe increase of the Argentine population, although it is not precisely\r\nall that might be desired, because it is not equally distributed, being\r\nlarger on the coast than in the interior, is none the less considerable.\r\nThe first national census of 1869 gave a population of 1,877,000 for the\r\nwhole country; that of 1895 gave 4 millions; an increase of more than\r\n2,100,000, or of 4·8 per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\nSince 1895, although the Constitution orders a ten-yearly census, no\r\ncensus has actually been taken. But according to the most reliable\r\ncalculations, the population of the Argentine amounts at present to more\r\nthan 6 millions of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that an increased population must also mean an increased\r\nadministrative expenditure, as more telegraphs are needed, more bridges,\r\nroads, and railways, a larger police service, more lawyers and judges,\r\nand more schools and teachers. No sensible person would pretend that\r\nthe national expenditure could remain unchanged, while all else was\r\ndeveloping and prospering. If the national revenue increases at an\r\nextraordinary rate, on account of the development of the population, it\r\nis only logical that the expenditure should increase likewise; but in a\r\nless proportion, it is true, as is proper under a good administration.\r\n\r\nBut this is not to say that it is permissible for administrators\r\nentrusted with the annual duty of presenting an estimate of public\r\nexpenditure to do what is occasionally done, with such deplorable\r\nresults——to estimate also in an exaggerated fashion the increase of the\r\npopulation, in order all the more to inflate the budget. The profound\r\nfinancial crisis, which affected the country in 1890, had no other cause.\r\nEverything is risked by the abuses of official expenditure. We have the\r\nproof of this in the fact that the economic possibilities of the country\r\nhave never been so great as in these moments of financial crisis.\r\n\r\nThe continual increase of the public debt is another of the causes of\r\nexaggerated budgets. Since the first loan of £1,000,000, contracted by\r\nthe Province of Buenos Ayres in 1822, which was later transferred to the\r\naccount of the nation, until the present time, when, if no new loans\r\nhave been contracted, at least the Government has put into circulation\r\nmillions of stock which it was holding in reserve, the public debt has\r\ndone nothing but increase, and in considerable proportions, attaining\r\nin 1909 to an amount of $371,000,000 gold and $237,000,000 paper,\r\nor £95,000,000 in all; and this, without including the last loan of\r\n£10,000,000 contracted by the Government in March 1909.\r\n\r\nAnother permanent cause of the increase of public expenditure is that\r\nwhich arises from the intervention of the State, as guarantor or promoter\r\nof costly public works.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Constitution has very wisely instructed Congress to\r\n“promote the introduction and the establishment of various industries and\r\nof immigration; the construction of railways and navigable waterways; the\r\ncolonisation of the lands belonging to the nation, and the importation of\r\nforeign capital and the exploitation of the rivers of the interior, by\r\nmeans of protective laws, temporary concessions, privileges, and awards,\r\nwhich shall be an incentive to emulation.”\r\n\r\nIn these sentences the writers were inspired only by the embryonic\r\ncondition of the country for which they legislated. In the\r\nold-established European nations, where great accumulations of capital\r\nexist, where everything is done by personal initiative, where the\r\ncommercial and industrial spirit is highly developed, many of the\r\nprescriptions of the Argentine Constitution would be useless or out of\r\ndate. But here, where capital is only beginning to exist, as a result of\r\nthe large commercial balance left over from each year of international\r\ntrade; here where, to use the phrase of an Argentine thinker, “we\r\nare naturally rich but economically poor,” the State has to turn to\r\nall trades; it has to go into business as contractor, encourage the\r\nestablishment of industries by means of premiums or bounties, and\r\nstimulate the introduction of capital and of immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe last of the causes we have cited as determining the increase of\r\npublic expenditure in the Argentine, is the increase of military\r\nexpenses. We do not here refer to the extraordinary expenses which the\r\nGovernment had to support for a number of years, in order to acquire the\r\nelements of naval and territorial defence wherewith to meet the possible\r\naggressions of a neighbouring State, but the ordinary annual expenses for\r\nthe upkeep of the army and the navy.\r\n\r\nUp to 1902 these expenses followed a scale of accelerated increase,\r\nand the country met them as a necessary sacrifice, dominated by the\r\nconviction that by this means it could evade the greater calamities of a\r\nwar; and quieted at the same time by the promises which were given that\r\nonce the danger had passed the expenses would naturally decrease.\r\n\r\nUnhappily it was not so. Although the international horizon was clear\r\nof the cloud which had threatened to disturb the tranquillity of the\r\ncountry, the army and navy estimates showed no signs of abatement; on\r\nthe contrary, they showed a tendency to increase. Thus in 1902, when\r\nthe international question was in an acute stage, and a rupture was\r\nmomentarily expected, these estimates amounted to £2,816,000.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1909, with peace and tranquillity reigning on all sides,\r\nthe war-budget still amounts to £1,980,000, and the naval budget to\r\n£1,452,000; or to more than £3,400,000 in all. We repeat that these are\r\nordinary, not extraordinary budgets, whose amount is always considerable,\r\nand which have to be met by means of sums raised by special financial\r\nlaws, or authorised by simple resolutions of the Cabinet or Council of\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\nTo these military expenses we must add the sums required to pay the\r\nretiring gratuities of officers, and these already amount to a veritable\r\narmy. These gratuities, granted under the provisions of an irrational\r\nlaw, have contributed to deprive the army of a large number of soldiers\r\nwho might still be serving with honour and distinction.\r\n\r\nBut large as these expenses are, they are altogether eclipsed by the\r\nexorbitant sum of £14,920,000 voted by Congress in 1908, which, divided\r\ninto eight annuities, is destined for the purchase of munitions of war,\r\nships, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine, by consenting to such expenses, which are as excessive as\r\nthey are unjustified, is thus deliberately entering upon the policy of\r\narmed peace, which has produced such lamentable results among the nations\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe figures we have already given, which relate to the National Budget,\r\nrepresent a portion only of the expenses which weigh upon the inhabitants\r\nof the country; for they do not include those amounts requisite for the\r\nsupport of the provincial and municipal administrations of the entire\r\nRepublic. The amount of all the budgets together——national, provincial\r\nand municipal——amounted, in 1908, to £29,200,000.\r\n\r\nEach one of the six-million inhabitants of the Argentine must thus\r\nannually contribute nearly £5 towards the support of the public\r\nadministrations. But in reality this contribution is still heavier,\r\nas the expenses which figure in the budget are only a part of the\r\nadministrative expenses, and we must still add the expenditure authorised\r\nby special laws or resolutions of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThis proportion of £5 per inhabitant is enormous; to understand how\r\nlarge it is, we must compare it with the amounts charged in other and\r\nmore advanced countries. On the other hand it is stated that some 30\r\nper cent. of the whole national expenditure is absorbed by the salaries\r\nof the administrative employés, functionaries, ministers, etc., and by\r\npensions and retiring gratuities.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon this abnormal situation, a sometime Minister of Finance\r\nremarked some years ago, in an official document which attracted\r\nattention by the energy and sincerity with which it was written:——\r\n\r\n“Our budgets have constantly increased of late years. It is notorious\r\nthat the personnel of the Administration is excessive, just as it is\r\nnotorious that useless and expensive sinecures have been created, with\r\nthe sole object of giving places to persons whose influence has been\r\nsuch that the State has undertaken to support them. Bureaucracy is\r\nincreasing; industry, commerce, and all the spheres of free endeavour and\r\nof individual effort are abandoned by the sons of the country, who seek\r\nsalaried employment or the exercise of intermediary professions which\r\ndemand no effort. The number of young men who waste their time in seeking\r\na place, instead of devoting their activities to work, in a country\r\nwhich offers wealth to all who will employ a little energy, a little\r\nperseverance, is surprising. But all want an easy life, even though it be\r\npoor and without horizon; all wish to live on the budget, and in order to\r\ngain their object they exhibit all kinds of ingenuity; they go seeking\r\nrecommendations, and employ every means at their disposal.\r\n\r\n“This host of pertinacious beggars of place results in the creation of\r\nnew employments and new services, all equally useless. The national\r\nand provincial administrations pay more than $65,000,000 in salaries\r\nand pensions. Each inhabitant contributes six golden dollars——£1,\r\n4s.——towards the upkeep of an army of employés, which is an enormous\r\nsum. The public services of other countries cost, per inhabitant: in\r\nSwitzerland, 4s. 9·6d.; in the United States, 6s. 4·8d.; in England,\r\n8s. 2·88d.; in Holland, 9s.; in Austria, 11s. 2·88d.; in Belgium,\r\n12s. 0·48d.; in Germany, 12s. 0·96d.; in Italy, 15s. 9·6d.; and in\r\nFrance 19s. 2·88d. These figures, taken from Paul Deschanel’s work on\r\nDecentralisation, show us that we have outstripped all other nations in\r\nthe matter of expenditure on the administration; even France and Italy,\r\nwhere bureaucracy is regarded as a calamity and as one of the causes of\r\ntheir economic decadence.\r\n\r\n“We must check this avalanche by suppressing all useless employments and\r\nall superfluous services. It is essential to turn our young men aside\r\nfrom their present path, in order that necessity shall force them to\r\nexercise their energies in the vast field which is offered them by a\r\nnew country, full of natural wealth, with a fertile soil and a benign\r\nclimate.”[96]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: See _Mémoires des Finances de 1889_, by J. M. Rosa, Vol.\r\nII., p. 174.]\r\n\r\nThe reaction which Señor Rosa, in his genuine patriotism, had hoped for,\r\ntook place a little after his departure from the Ministry of Finance; but\r\nunhappily its direction was the reverse of that he anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe have examined the expenses of the public administrations; we have\r\nmeasured the weight of the public debt; we must now examine the treasury\r\nreceipts, in order to discover what are the most important sources of the\r\nrevenues which fill it, and what elasticity they possess.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Constituents, after having explained, in the sententious\r\npreamble which serves as a preface to their great political code, what\r\nplace was theirs who were building the great edifice of the State, turned\r\nto consider from what sources the revenues for the Treasury might be\r\ndrawn, in order to satisfy the necessities of the administration of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTo this effect they enacted that these resources should be: “The taxes\r\nupon imports and exports; the sale or allocation of lands forming part\r\nof the national territory; the postal revenues, and the other taxes,\r\nwhich the General Congress will impose equitably and in proportion to the\r\npopulation; also such loans and credit operations as the same Congress\r\nshall decree for the urgent needs of the nation, or for undertakings of\r\nnational utility.” (Article 4).\r\n\r\nHas the foresight of the Constituents in establishing these sources\r\nof revenue been justified? or, in other words, were the elements of\r\nrevenue created by the fundamental charter efficacious? A little study\r\nof the system of Argentine revenue will show that of all these sources\r\nenumerated, the only ones that have a permanent and fertile existence\r\nare those relating to the customs receipts; that is, to the duties of\r\nexport and import. The others either give poor and uncertain results,\r\nsuch as the sale and allocation of national lands; or are of a perilous\r\nnature and to be used with restraint, such as loans and transactions on\r\ncredit; or they are drawn from services which produce revenue only within\r\nnarrow limits, such as the Posts.\r\n\r\nBesides the sources appointed by the Constitution for normal requirements\r\nand ordinary periods, the same charter enumerates another source to be\r\nresorted to in exceptional cases or for purposes of defence, when the\r\ncommon security and the general welfare of the State may demand it. This\r\nsource is the imposition of “direct taxes, during a fixed period, and\r\nequally proportioned all over the Republic.”\r\n\r\nIt follows from these limits that the principal effective source of\r\nrevenue intended by the Constitution to form the Federal Treasury is\r\nthat of indirect taxation. So far the new fundamental code has not only\r\nfollowed the example of the principal nations, and hearkened to the\r\ncounsel of economic science, but has also put into effect an eminently\r\npractical and far-seeing procedure.\r\n\r\nSeñor Alberdi, who of all writers has most profoundly studied the system\r\nof revenue established by the Argentine Constitution, has stated that\r\nindirect taxation is the most fruitful fiscal resource, as is proved\r\nby the customs revenues, which are relatively greater than those of\r\nall other taxes put together. The indirect tax, adds Señor Alberdi, is\r\nrelatively the most equitable, as every one pays according to his tastes\r\nand his powers of consumption; the foreigner as well as the son of the\r\nsoil.[97]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: See _Sistema económico y rentístico, Obras de Alberdi_,\r\nVol. IV, p. 419.]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the Constitution was far-seeing and lucid in its\r\ndefinition of the character of the revenues of the National Treasury:\r\nthat is, in fixing upon the customs duties, the sale and allocation of\r\nland, the products of the Posts, and other contributions to be imposed\r\nby Congress for normal situations in a proportional and equitable\r\nmanner; and also in deciding upon the imposition of direct taxation\r\nfor determined periods, and relatively equal all over the country, for\r\nexceptional and abnormal times.\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentator quoted above, when the Constitution left\r\nCongress the faculty of establishing, equitably and in due proportion,\r\ntaxes of other kinds, and abstained from naming them or limiting them\r\nto a fixed number, it was because it wished to give the legislature the\r\nright of adopting all those recognised by economic science, in order that\r\nthey might be imposed according to the principles of the Constitution\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIf we now cast an eye over the table of the national revenue, we shall\r\nsee that in 1908 the nation collected, in the form of direct taxes,\r\nthe sum of £583,344; in the form of indirect taxes, £4,803,920; for\r\nthe remuneration of services, a sum of £1,023,440, which had not the\r\ncharacter of direct taxation; as the usufruct of land belonging to the\r\nnational domain, and the profits of national undertakings, £2,510,240;\r\nand as capitation fees, £8,000. We must also include in the receipts the\r\nsums contributed by some of the provinces, and by the National Bank,\r\nto the service of the national debt; guaranteed, on their account, by\r\nthe National Treasury. If we add together all these sums, which for one\r\nreason or another were placed to the account of the nation in 1908, we\r\narrive at a general total of £22,392,160.\r\n\r\nThis revenue may be analysed as follows:——\r\n\r\nThe group of direct taxes is formed by the land-tax of the city of\r\nBuenos Ayres and of the National Territories, which figures in the\r\nbalance-sheet as a sum of £320,320. In reality the product of this tax\r\nis greater——amounting to more than £616,000——but the nation is by law\r\ncompelled to give a certain proportion of this sum to the Municipality\r\nand another to the National Council of Education; what remains when these\r\nobligations are satisfied belongs to the Government. The commercial and\r\nindustrial licences of the Federal capital and the National Territories\r\nform the second class of direct taxes, their yield being £245,520; but,\r\nas in the case of the land tax, the Government has to give part of this\r\nsum to the city and part to the Council of Education.\r\n\r\nThe indirect taxes are those which produce the largest yield: they\r\ninclude the customs duties upon imports, which in 1908 yielded\r\n£12,036,000. The consular duties brought in £100,000; stamps and fees\r\naccounted for £118,000.\r\n\r\nBesides the resources furnished by the indirect imposts of the customs,\r\nthere has since 1891 existed in the Argentine another kind of indirect\r\ninternal duty, which is charged upon consumption, and which every day\r\nacquires a greater importance, in proportion as the country is developed\r\nand as wealth and population increase.\r\n\r\nThese duties were established at a critical moment of the country’s\r\nhistory, and they mark a degree of evolution in the financial system\r\nof the country. In 1891, when the liquidation commenced of the\r\ngreat financial crisis which had completely overturned the economic\r\norganisation of the Argentine, the strength of the country was broken,\r\nthe Treasury was empty, and there existed a public debt which was all the\r\nmore grievous in that the paper currency was absolutely inconvertible,\r\nand decreased in value daily, in the midst of all the difficulties which\r\ncharacterised that terrible time.[98]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: See _Memoria del Ministerio de Hacienda_, 1890, p. 72.]\r\n\r\nThis overwhelming situation resulted in the establishment of indirect\r\ninternal imposts; that is, the branch of taxation which is levied on\r\nthe national industry and national production; but which is, in all\r\ncontemporary nations, one of the most fruitful sources of revenue; the\r\nmore so as its collection demands few sacrifices on the part of those who\r\npay it.\r\n\r\nThe realisation of this fortunate idea, which effected an important\r\ninnovation in the revenue system, was due to the administration of\r\nSeñor Carlos Pellegrini, in which Vincent-Fidel Lopez was Minister of\r\nFinance, and was perhaps the most important and meritorious act of the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nDuring this first year of 1891, the receipts furnished by this branch\r\nof taxation did not attain to the expected results; they amounted only\r\nto £224,682, distributed as follows: Alcohols, £123,511; beer, £23,549;\r\nmatches, £76,617; banks and companies, £982; total, £224,660. Out of a\r\ntotal collection of $75,501,077 paper and $497,120 gold, or £6,743,518,\r\nthe yield of internal duties amounted only to 3.29 per cent. Four\r\nyears later, after the administration of internal duties had undergone\r\nconsiderable modifications and improvements, so that the system of\r\ncollection had become more exact, these imposts furnished the Treasury\r\nwith £676,946, which out of a total collection of $29,805,651 in gold\r\nand $28,958,460 in paper, or £11,571,076, amounted to 5·85 per cent. of\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the budget voted by Congress increased the general revenue to be\r\ncollected to $33,492,000 in gold and $47,835,000 in paper (deducting from\r\nthis last sum 12 millions of paper produced by the shares of the National\r\nBank and 2 millions as the profits of the Bank of the Nation), or in all\r\n$148,000,000. The yield of internal duties had increased to $19,360,000,\r\nor 13 per cent. of the whole revenue.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the domestic imposts produced £4,000,000, or 17 per cent. of a\r\ntotal collection of £22,400,000. The chief element of this revenue was\r\nfurnished by the duty on the consumption of alcohol, which produced\r\n£1,496,000. The tobacco duty came second with a yield of £1,760,000.\r\nMatches yielded £269,000; beer, £308,000; insurances, £61,600. These\r\nfigures show how rapid has been the increase of the revenue from internal\r\nduties on consumption.\r\n\r\nIf we disregard that portion of the revenue which is raised by imposts,\r\nand examine the yield of the industrial undertakings exploited by the\r\nnation, we shall find that as yet they are far from constituting any real\r\nresource for the Treasury, and far from compensating the large amounts\r\nof capital employed. Comparing the yield of these undertakings with the\r\nworking expenses, we find that the balance, as a general thing, is on the\r\nlosing side.\r\n\r\nThis is the case with the four railways belonging to the nation, whose\r\nyield, in 1905, was £1,012,000. The working expenses, the renewal of\r\nrolling-stock, and repairs of the permanent way, completely absorbed the\r\nrevenue. We must hope that this ruinous state of things will disappear\r\npresently, when the network of State railways is completed, and the lines\r\nunite important centres of production, and the system of administration\r\nis perfected.\r\n\r\nAfter this miserable result we may point with relative satisfaction\r\nto another important industrial undertaking of the Government: the\r\nsanitation works of the city of Buenos Ayres. Apart from the hygienic\r\nadvantage, which is already very evident, the financial results are\r\nworthy of attention, as they show that this undertaking will very shortly\r\ncover, if not the whole, at least a portion of the interest on the\r\ncapital employed.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary working expenses of this undertaking amounted in 1908 to\r\n£258,202, while the revenue amounted to £673,200. This left a balance in\r\nfavour of the Treasury of £415,000, of which a great part was employed,\r\nby virtue of special laws, in the enlargement of these works, which\r\nenlargement will still further increase the revenue. The financial result\r\nof this undertaking is a conclusive proof that such enterprises, when\r\ndirected with method and intelligence, are always profitable to the State.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service, which the authors of the Constitution expected to be\r\na considerable resource, has hitherto given only negative results; the\r\nreceipts have not hitherto covered the working expenses. The ordinary\r\nexpenses of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were £1,144,000 in\r\n1908, while the effective receipts for the same year were only £936,320;\r\ngiving a deficit of £207,680. In reality this deficit was far greater,\r\nbecause fresh expenditure was necessitated by the construction and\r\nrepairs of telegraphic lines, and certain purely nominal receipts,\r\narising from the franking of official correspondence, were put on the\r\ncredit account.\r\n\r\nIf we now proceed to examine the revenue derived from the national\r\nestates, we find that its most important item proceeds from the sale and\r\nallocation of the public lands. This revenue, which figures among those\r\nenumerated by the fundamental charter as forming the resources of the\r\nTreasury, has by no means produced what it should, owing to the lack of\r\nmethod or foresight in the management of this important administrative\r\ndepartment. In 1908 this source produced only £278,080; and this sum\r\nrepresents a considerable increase over previous years, especially over\r\nthe year 1904, when the revenue was only £27,368. But when we take\r\nthe fact into account that the nation still possesses 212 millions of\r\nacres of land, which are situated in territories whose population is\r\nrapidly increasing, and which will shortly be well served with railways,\r\nwe perceive at once that these lands, which are a powerful source of\r\nattraction to immigrants, may also in time become a very important source\r\nof revenue.\r\n\r\nThe revenue derived from the exploitation of industrial undertakings\r\nand from the national domains being thus eliminated from the list of\r\neffective revenues, as being nominal or insignificant, we see that the\r\nnation has no other positive resources than the customs duties and\r\nimposts upon consumption. This explains the development of the budgets\r\nof the last few years, in which the domestic and indirect duties have\r\nincreased the fiscal receipts.[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: See _Memoria del Ministerio de Hacienda_, 1895, Vols. IX.\r\nand XI.]\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of the present situation of the Argentine\r\nis the remarkable elasticity displayed by the increase of the fiscal\r\nresources. At the present time few countries in the world present a\r\nsimilar spectacle. Here, more than in any other country, the official\r\nrevenues are in direct relation to the result of the harvests and the\r\nexportation of the products of the ranch; so that the table of fiscal\r\nreceipts is a kind of infallible barometer, which measures the degree of\r\nwealth and prosperity of the general population.\r\n\r\nIf——not to go back too far in our investigations——we take the thirteen\r\nyears from 1895 to 1908 as an example, and if we convert into gold the\r\nsums received in paper, according to the average rate of exchange for\r\neach of these years, we find, in the first place, that in 1895 the\r\nTreasury received £7,600,000. Since then these figures have increased\r\nin rapid progression; passing from £7,600,000 to £8,600,000; thence\r\nto £10,000,000; thence to £10,600,000; thence to £14,600,000; but in\r\n1900, through economic causes such as the loss of harvests, anthrax,\r\nthe closing of English ports to Argentine live-stock, joined to such\r\npolitical causes as the fear of complications with Chili, the revenues\r\nfell to £13,000,000. But progress was not long in establishing itself\r\nanew; in 1904, the revenue was £15,200,000; in 1907, £21,200,000; and in\r\n1908, £22,400,000, which is the highest figure the administration has\r\never known.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate this enormous progress at its true worth, we must take\r\nthe fact into account that it was precisely during these years that\r\nthe nation released several sources of revenue which had previously\r\nbeen taxed; such as duties levied on the export of natural products,\r\nand on natural or artificial wines, and additional duties levied on\r\nimportations, all of which represented a respectable number of millions\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\nThus in thirteen years, from 1895 to 1908, the fiscal receipts have\r\nincreased by £14,800,000, or by 194 per cent.\r\n\r\nSuch a result cannot but be satisfying, and it would be the most eloquent\r\nproof of the intense vitality of the Argentine finances were it not for\r\nthe still more rapid increase of official expenditure. This also has\r\nincreased, rapidly and enormously, more often than not exceeding the\r\nrevenue, and leaving each year a more or less important deficit, which,\r\naccumulating from one year to another, has finally to be converted into\r\na consolidated debt, whether foreign or domestic. “The practical result\r\nof the budgets from 1863 to the present time,” says an official document,\r\n“has been an uninterrupted series of deficits.”[100]\r\n\r\nIn the face of this situation the patriotic advice which the Minister of\r\nFinance, J. M. Rosa, gave the Government and the Congress in a memorable\r\ndocument some years ago, is more than ever applicable.\r\n\r\n“We must do our utmost to economise,” he said, “by restraining ourselves\r\nand reducing our expenses to the absolutely indispensable. It is only\r\nby applying ourselves to the work of simplifying our administrative\r\nservices, by suppressing useless formalities and superfluous employments,\r\nby scrutinising the least details of the public expenditure, that we\r\nshall succeed in making large economies. It is certain that to purge\r\nthe administration of its ancient vices, to sweep away all useless\r\nappointments, to refuse to find vacant places at the bidding of power and\r\ninfluence, and to establish the strictest rules of economy, is a task\r\nof no mean difficulty; but we cannot stop to think of the animosity and\r\nthe vindictive temper which it may arouse when duty renders such conduct\r\nnecessary.”[100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: See _Memoria del Departamento de Hacienda de 1899_, by\r\nJoseph M. Rosa.]\r\n\r\nIf Argentina truly wishes, not to compromise her lofty destinies, but\r\nto remain a centre of attraction to the labourers or the disinherited\r\nchildren of fate to whom she offers the resources of her fruitful soil;\r\nif she aspires to be, in the twentieth century, the great centre of the\r\nworld’s emigration, as were the United States in the nineteenth century,\r\nshe must obtain an administration both methodical and economical; careful\r\nof the public moneys, and at the same time open to all material progress.\r\nIt is thus that she will win the confidence of men and of capital; that\r\nis, of the two elements which she must still multiply in order to become\r\na great nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                            THE PUBLIC DEBT\r\n\r\nStatistics of the public debt on the 1st January 1909——History of\r\n    the public debt——The first loans.\r\n\r\nThe financial crisis——Consolidated loans——The Romero arrangement——\r\n    Loan for the rescission of guarantees——The internal public\r\n    debt——The total of the Argentine public debt, and its annual\r\n    cost in dividends and redemption——The proportion of financial\r\n    charges as compared to other budgetary expenses.\r\n\r\nThe burden of the public debt is heavy, but not unduly heavy in\r\n    relation to the productive power of the country——The necessity\r\n    of restraining further issues and of converting old debts——The\r\n    efforts of the Argentine to improve her credit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the vicissitudes through which the Argentine has passed in the course\r\nof the nineteenth century have left their traces upon the history of the\r\nNational Debt.

It may be analysed as follows:——\r\n\r\n                           FOREIGN DEBT.[101]\r\n\r\n                                 Circulation             Annual Cost,\r\n                             on 1st January 1909.

This establishment, although\r\nbelonging to the Government, bears the cost of its debt out of its own\r\nresources. Eliminating these £16,000,000, we find that the external debt,\r\nwhose cost is borne by the Treasury, amounts not to nearly £63,000,000,\r\nbut to £47,000,000.\r\n\r\nWe shall ultimately have occasion to inquire how far this debt weighs\r\nupon the resources of the Treasury, what the burden per inhabitant\r\namounts to, and how it stands in relation to the debts of other\r\ncountries. For the moment we must glance backward in order to realise\r\nthe historical conditions under which this debt was contracted, and what\r\nits destination has been.[102] The first credit transaction effected by\r\nthe Republic abroad was concluded a few years after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. In 1822 the Province of Buenos Ayres, which had always\r\nbeen the heart and head of the Republic, taking its place, indeed,\r\nunder certain conditions, and under others representing it in foreign\r\ncountries, was fortunate in having at its head a progressive Government,\r\nwhich, by its profitable initiative, has left ineradicable traces behind\r\nit. The President was General Martino Rodriguez; the Ministers included\r\nBernadino Rivadavia and Manuelo-Josepho Garcia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: See, in _The North American Review_ for May 1902, an\r\narticle by Señor Alberto Martinez, entitled: “National Debts of the\r\nWorld. IX. Public Debt of Argentina.”]\r\n\r\nThis Government cast its eyes over the empty surface of the vast\r\nArgentine territory; it saw immense wealth unexploited, for lack of the\r\nnecessary elements; it realised its great need of material progress,\r\nand understood, with a just and clairvoyant judgment, that of all these\r\nneeds the most urgent were the construction of a port for the exchange of\r\nproducts with the outside world, the instalment of a water supply which\r\nwould ensure health to the inhabitants, and the establishment of villages\r\nalong the line of the new frontier, serving as desert outposts, and\r\nconstituting a military pale to withstand and confine the irruptions of\r\nthe savage Indians.\r\n\r\nFor the realisation of these then important undertakings of public\r\nutility the Government of 1822 resolved to obtain the necessary\r\nresources, by raising a loan of a million sterling, giving as\r\nconsideration a dividend of 6 per cent. and an annual redemption of 1 per\r\ncent.; the House of Baring to act as agents for the loan. Unhappily the\r\nexecutive power employed the resources furnished by this transaction in\r\nfounding a bank which had a very short existence, and the intended public\r\nworks were not effected. More than half a century elapsed before their\r\nrealisation.\r\n\r\nThe loan was issued in 1824, and was taken up in entirety at a discount\r\nof 30 per cent., so that the Government received £700,000. For many\r\nyears, at the time of the Rozas tyranny, and during the ensuing period\r\nof national dissolution, the payments on this loan were suspended; not\r\nuntil 1856, when the tyranny was overthrown and the Argentine nation\r\nreconstituted, did the Government of Buenos Ayres instruct Norberto de la\r\nRiestra to come to an understanding with the creditors, and to offer them\r\nthe punctual payment not only of the future dividends, as they fell due,\r\nbut also of all those overdue, on deferred stock at 11s. 2d., at 2 per\r\ncent. interest, with an annual redemption of 1/2 per cent. This debt is\r\ntoday extinguished, and has left no traces on the budget.\r\n\r\nThe second loan contracted by the nation after its reorganisation\r\nwas intended to cover the expenses of the war to which it had been\r\nunreasonably provoked by the tyrant of Paraguay in 1865; and this loan\r\nhas also disappeared from the ledger of the public debt.\r\n\r\nThe third national loan was contracted in 1870, the sum being £1,042,978,\r\nunder the Presidency of Señor Sarmiento; and the capital was required for\r\nthe accomplishment of public works. This loan and that preceding it were\r\nfinally converted into others which carried a lower interest.\r\n\r\nThen these transactions were followed by others, of which we will briefly\r\nenumerate the details.\r\n\r\nThe railway loan, authorised by the law of the 2nd of October 1880, was\r\nto raise the sum of $12,000,000; a sum required for the extension of the\r\nCentral North Railway as far as the town of Jujuy, the Andean line as far\r\nas San Juan, and for the branch line to Santiago de l’Estero. It bore\r\n6 per cent. interest, with an annual redemption of 1 per cent. It was\r\nissued in London, in June 1881, for the amount of £2,450,000, at a price\r\nof 91 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe loan entitled “The Public National Funds,” which was decreed by the\r\nlaws of 12th October and 28th June 1883, enabled the Government to pay\r\nfor the shares in the National Bank (to-day in liquidation), which it\r\nhad acquired. This loan, bearing 5 per cent. interest and 1 per cent.\r\nredemption, was issued in May 1884, by Baring Brothers, at a discount of\r\n84·5 per cent., and amounted to £1,683,100.\r\n\r\nThe loan entitled “Harbour Works of the Capital,” authorised by the law\r\nof 27th October 1882, was contracted for the construction of the new\r\nharbour which the city of Buenos Ayres required for the development of\r\nher foreign trade. An issue of $20,000,000 in gold was decreed, bearing 6\r\nper cent. interest, with 1 per cent. redemption.\r\n\r\nThe “Public Works” loan was created by the law of 21st October 1885; its\r\namount was £8,400,000, and its object the unification of certain loans\r\nrequired for various undertakings. The shares bore 5 per cent. interest\r\nwith an annual redemption of 1 per cent. The sum issued was £8,333,000,\r\nof which £4,000,000 was placed in London, in January 1886, at 80 per\r\ncent., and the remainder in January 1887 at 85-1/2 per cent. This loan\r\nwas guaranteed, as far as the interest was concerned, by the customs\r\nrevenue, and the representatives of the investors had on this pretext\r\nreserved certain rights of control over the administration of this\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThe “Central Northern Railway Loan” was divided into two series. The\r\nfirst, authorised by the law of 9th October 1886, was of £4,000,000;\r\nbut of this sum only £3,968,200 was issued, as follows: to London, in\r\nJune 1887, £1,300,000 at 91·5 per cent.; in April 1888, £1,500,000\r\nat 94 per cent.; in May 1889, £1,168,200 at 97 per cent. The second\r\nseries, authorised by the law of 30th October 1889, amounted in all to\r\n£3,000,000, of which only £2,976,000 was issued. The two loans bore\r\nan interest of 5 per cent. and a redemption of 1 per cent.; they were\r\ncontracted to allow of the prolongation of the Central Northern Railway.\r\n\r\nThe “National Bank” loan, created in virtue of the law of 2nd December\r\n1886, authorised an issue of £2,058,200, to enable the Government to pay\r\nthe debt which it had contracted towards the said Bank. The bonds were\r\nissued at 90 per cent.; they bore an annual interest of 5 per cent., with\r\na redemption of 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe “Treasury Bonds Conversion” loan, authorised by the law of 21st June\r\n1887, was employed, as its description indicates, in the consolidation\r\nof a debt contracted for a short term. The issue required was $5,078,330\r\npaper, but only £624,000 was actually realised.[103] The stock carried an\r\nannual revenue of 5 per cent., with 1 per cent. redemption, while the old\r\nTreasury Bonds have an interest of 9 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: The sum of $5,078,330 is equivalent at the present\r\ndiscount of paper to £446,873; in 1887 the value of the paper piastre was\r\nhigher.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nThe loan contracted by virtue of the law of 15th August 1887 was intended\r\nto balance certain debts on the part of the National Government towards\r\nthe Government of the Province of Buenos Ayres. The issue was one of\r\n£3,973,700, the interest being 4-1/2 per cent. and the redemption 1 per\r\ncent.; it was taken up at 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe “Conversion of Debts” loan, at 6 per cent., contracted in virtue\r\nof the law of 2nd August 1888, was an operation of consolidation and\r\nreorganisation of debts. The issue amounted to £5,290,000. The bonds,\r\nwhich yielded 4-1/2 per cent., with 1 per cent. redemption, were\r\nnegotiated in London, in February 1889, at 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe “Conversion of Hard Dollars” loan was issued in virtue of the law of\r\n2nd July 1889, which authorised an issue of £2,600,000 to be applied to\r\nthe conversion of debts contracted in hard piastres. The new stock was to\r\nyield an interest of 3-1/2 per cent., with 1 per cent. redemption. The\r\nissue actually amounted to £2,659,500.\r\n\r\nThe “Consolidation Loan” (authorised 24th January 1891) was one of\r\nthe most important credit transactions ever effected in the Argentine\r\nRepublic: a transaction which evokes memories of a critical period which\r\nwe ought briefly to recall.\r\n\r\nWhen Signor Pellegrini’s Government came to power, on the 6th August\r\n1890, the country was suffering from a political upheaval, and at the\r\nsame time was entering upon a time of severe financial crisis, “the most\r\nviolent, the most desperate crisis which has ever afflicted the Republic,\r\nand put its honour to the test,” according to the words of Vincenzio\r\nLopez, the eminent finance Minister of that administration.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury had exhausted its resources, in order to increase and\r\nsupport the funds of the National Bank, whose debt to the Government\r\namounted to $47,491,483[104] in paper, and £2,528,224 in gold, while its\r\ndebt to foreign creditors amounted to £3,708,037, and to home creditors\r\n£2,328,800.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: This amount is not reduced to gold, the rate of exchange\r\nnot being fixed at the time.——[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\nIf the situation of the National Bank, which served as the Government’s\r\ntreasury, was serious, that of the National Mortgage Bank and that of the\r\nCity of Buenos Ayres were no less grave. The first owed $1,690,833 in\r\npaper and £111,475 in gold in dividends, and the second was drained dry\r\nby its debts, amounting to $34,646,533 paper and £92,339 gold at home, as\r\nwell as £1,960,000 abroad.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset the Government concentrated all its efforts upon the\r\nsolution of these three grave problems. It proposed the reconstitution\r\nof the National Bank; it would enable the Mortgage Bank to continue\r\noperations, chiefly by repaying the advances which it had made to the\r\nState; and assist the City of Buenos Ayres to meet its engagements in\r\nrespect of the interest of the foreign debt, constraining it to collect\r\nand employ the municipal revenues in a more methodical manner.\r\n\r\nThe prime object of this important transaction was “to give the country\r\na period of economic repose, by provisionally suspending the removals\r\nof metallic currency for the liquidation of the nation’s foreign\r\nengagements,” as the Government declared in the message which accompanied\r\nits proposal. To achieve this end, the creation of a consolidation\r\nloan was proposed, amounting to £12,000,000, and increased later on to\r\n£15,000,000 upon the advice of the lenders, the result being destined,\r\nfor a period of three years, for employment in paying the interest\r\non the nation’s loans and in relieving the Treasury of the burden of\r\nguaranteeing the dividends of the railways.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with agreements concluded between the Government of the\r\nRepublic and the banking houses which undertook to negotiate the loan,\r\nthe banks undertook to accept, during a period of three years, as\r\nconsideration for the debt, and for the effectual guaranteeing of the\r\nrailways, bonds of the loan itself; and undertook, moreover, to accept\r\nthem at par. The issue each year was to be proportional to the sum\r\nnecessary to pay the interest on the debt.\r\n\r\nThe nation, on the other hand, undertook to set aside for the payment\r\nof the interest on the said loan 6 per cent. of the customs receipts,\r\nwhich were subjected to a monthly levy of the amount required, the amount\r\naffected by the prior rights of the loan of 1885 being deducted first.\r\n\r\nThe nation also engaged not to increase its foreign debts, whether by\r\nborrowing or giving guarantees, during the three years fixed for the\r\nissue of the loan.\r\n\r\nThe total amount authorised was £15,000,000, the interest 6 per cent.,\r\nand redemption was to commence at the end of three years, to be completed\r\nin thirty years. Coupons could be paid to the State in settlement of\r\ncustoms duties. Of the above nominal sum, only £7,691,725 was actually\r\nraised, £7,308,275 remaining unissued for the following reasons:——\r\n\r\nUnder the administration of Señor Saenz Peña, when Señor Romero was\r\ninstalled in the Ministry of Finance on the 12th October 1892 he found\r\nthe Consolidation Loan in process of issue, the stock being sold at need,\r\nthe 6 per cent. bonds being guaranteed by the customs receipts; they were\r\nthen selling in London at about 63 per cent. Señor Romero estimated that\r\nif the system of paying debts by means of debts is generally a ruinous\r\none, it was especially so in this case, where the transaction was being\r\neffected by means of bonds so badly depreciated as those of this loan.\r\n\r\nThe first important act of this Presidency was to make an arrangement\r\nwith the representatives of the bearers of the foreign debt, by which\r\nthey consented to a reduced interest for five years——that is, until\r\n1898——the redemption charge being suspended simultaneously. In the\r\nfollowing years, from 12th July 1898 to 12th January 1901, the full\r\ninterest alone was to be resumed, and from 1901 the payment of the\r\nredemption charge would also be resumed.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this arrangement, it was decided to issue no further\r\nstock of the loan, even in cases where the issue was authorised: as,\r\nfor example, in the effective guarantee of railway stock. Holders of\r\nthe latter would receive payment on the basis of the price at which the\r\nshares were quoted. This is why the Consolidation loan issue of 1891 was\r\nconfined to the sum already cited.\r\n\r\nThe “Travaux de salubrité,” or Water Supply and Drainage loan, authorised\r\nby the law of 30th January 1891, to the extent of £6,750,000, in bonds\r\nbearing 5 per cent. interest and 1 per cent. redemption, was created\r\nunder the following conditions:——\r\n\r\nThe Government of Señor Juarez Celman, which preceded that of Signor\r\nPellegrini, was inspired by the Spencerian doctrine, which asserts as a\r\nprinciple that the State is always a bad administrator, and fell into\r\nfinancial and administrative errors which were to cost the country dear\r\nindeed. Thus it resolved to place in the hands of individuals all the\r\nindustrial enterprises undertaken by the nation, among which was the\r\nscheme for supplying the city of Buenos Ayres with water and facilitating\r\nthe elimination of its filth and sewage.\r\n\r\nEvery one very soon saw, however, that a serious mistake had been\r\nmade. The individual firm entrusted with these important services was\r\nexclusively preoccupied in exploiting the public, and its methods\r\nresulted in protests and resistance on the part of the inhabitants\r\nof Buenos Ayres. On 6th August 1890, the Government, Pellegrini\r\nbeing president, came to the conclusion that it was its duty as an\r\nadministration, and was also a matter of political efficiency, to place\r\nthe sanitation works in the hands of the State once more; and with this\r\nobject it obtained an authorisation to contract a loan of £6,750,000, at\r\n5 per cent. and 1 per cent. redemption. Such was the origin of this loan,\r\nof which stock to the value of £6,374,995 was issued.\r\n\r\nThe “Rescission of Railway Guarantees” loan, authorised by the laws of\r\n10th January 1896 and 30th December 1898, was contracted to disburthen\r\nthe State of the heavy obligations which weighed upon it as a result\r\nof having guaranteed an interest of 6 per cent. on enormous capitals\r\nemployed in the construction of railways. With this object £11,699,957\r\nworth of stock was created, and issued at 4 per cent. and 1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe loan for the “Conversion of Provincial Debts,” created by the law of\r\n8th August 1896, was justified by the highest considerations of national\r\nsolidarity, and of the defence of Argentine credit abroad.\r\n\r\nThe enormous debts contracted by the Provinces, unauthorised and\r\nuncontrolled by the central power, quickly resulted in a veritable\r\nbankruptcy, at the end of a period of waste and folly, of unchecked and\r\nuncalculating expense.\r\n\r\nThe nation, which had in no way intervened in the matter of these\r\nloans, and had contracted no obligations whatever on their behalf,\r\nmight strictly have refused to accept any responsibility for such heavy\r\nliabilities; but it is indubitable that the insolvent condition of the\r\nProvinces in the European markets might have affected the credit of\r\nthe nation, the latter being, in foreign eyes, involved in all these\r\nindividual failures.\r\n\r\nWhat President Quintana said in his inaugural address on the subject of\r\nthe peace of the Provinces, which is also the peace of the State, may\r\nalso, with no less reason, apply to credit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the nation could not remain indifferent to the\r\nprecarious situation created by the suspension of payment in the\r\nProvinces. As practically all their revenues were already pledged, so\r\nthat they could not pay interest on their debts for many years, the legal\r\naction of their creditors might fetter their administrations, oppose\r\nserious obstacles to the development of their sources of wealth and\r\nproduction, and, in short, inflict serious damage upon the entire country.\r\n\r\nThese very serious considerations decided the public powers to lend the\r\nProvinces their aid, so that the latter might make equitable arrangements\r\nwith their foreign creditors, and as far as possible free themselves from\r\nsuch heavy liabilities.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were for the most part effected by exchanging the\r\n4-1/2 per cent. stock of interior debt which the Provinces promised\r\nagainst 4 per cent. stock of the foreign debt, which the nation remitted\r\nto the creditors of the Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe total of these provincial debts amounted to £30,355,190, and the\r\nnation, for the complete liquidation of the same, gave 4 per cent.\r\nstock, bearing a redemption charge of 1/2 per cent., to the value of\r\n£17,199,899. The interest and annual redemption charges of this stock\r\namounted to £773,995.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the nation acquired by this arrangement 4-1/2 per\r\ncent. stock of the loan known as the Guaranteed Banks loan to the value\r\nof £9,175,233, the interest and redemption charge (of 1 per cent.)\r\namounting annually to £504,638. Adding to this sum that of £232,000, as\r\nthe contribution of the Province of Buenos Ayres, and £51,220 furnished\r\nby the Province of Entre Rios, we have a total of £827,858 annually.\r\nThe exchange of the internal against the external debt thus produced a\r\ntemporary profit of £53,863 per annum; we say temporary, because the 4\r\nper cent. stock has a later date of redemption than the 4-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe “Conversion of Municipal Stock” loan, authorised by the laws of 25th\r\nSeptember 1897 and 15th December 1898, was raised, to the extent of\r\n£1,540,000, by the issue of stock at 4 per cent. and 1/2 per cent. The\r\nresult of this issue was destined to pay what still remained owing to the\r\ncreditors of the National Bank in liquidation.\r\n\r\nThe law of 5th January 1899 authorised a loan of £6,000,000, intended to\r\nbalance the debts of the Public Treasury; the alcohol duty being offered\r\nas guarantee to the extent of £800,000 per annum; but hitherto the loan\r\nhas not been negotiated, and there is no longer any question of this\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nSuch, briefly detailed, are the antecedents of the various foreign loans\r\ncontracted by the Argentine nation. As for the domestic consolidated\r\ndebt in 1905, it was the object of a complete reorganisation, so that\r\nto-day the history of its origins is not of much practical interest. It\r\namounted, on 1st January 1909, to £7,639,760 in gold and £9,199,581 in\r\npaper, of which £6,900,000 was in gold and £7,700,000 in paper in 5 per\r\ncent. stock, £710,620 in gold in 4-1/2 per cent. stock, and £880,000\r\nin paper in 6 per cent. stock. This gives us a total (in gold) of\r\n£16,839,341, on which the charge in interest and redemption absorbs an\r\nannual sum of £1,004,445.\r\n\r\nHere is the analysis of the internal debt:\r\n\r\n                            INTERNAL DEBT, _1st January 1909_.\r\n\r\n                                 Gold.

This operation\r\ngave the following results: The amount of 6 per cent. stock, including\r\nNational Bank stock, amounted to £5,888,881, or $66,918,300 paper. Of\r\nthis total $50,814,000, or £4,471,632 were converted in the Argentine and\r\n£664,884 in Europe, or in all £5,136,516; the balance then amounting only\r\nto £730,184.

Without this money-box, this “woollen stocking”\r\nof Governmental savings, as M. Neymarck called it, it is certain that\r\nthere would be no trace in the Argentine Treasury of all the millions it\r\nhas paid in amortisation during the last few years; so that the present\r\ngeneration would have cast upon the shoulders of the coming generation a\r\nfar heavier burden than that the latter will inherit as things are.\r\n\r\nReturning to the external debt, we may state that among the loans\r\nwhich figure in the national liabilities are eight, with a capital of\r\n£23,350,139, at 5 per cent. interest; two, with a capital of £7,697,263,\r\nat 4-1/2 per cent.; eleven with a capital of £29,840,315, at 4 per cent.,\r\nand one of £2,004,710 at 3-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe public debt, external and internal, amounts to the following:——\r\n\r\n  External debt      £62,892,428\r\n  Internal debt       16,839,365\r\n                     -----------\r\n                     £79,731,793\r\n\r\nLet us see to what extent the interest on this debt weighs upon the\r\nBudget:——\r\n\r\n  External debt                  £3,794,436\r\n  Internal debt                   1,004,445\r\n                                 ——————————\r\n    Total on 1st January 1909    £4,798,881\r\n                                 ——————————\r\n\r\nIn the tabulation of the foreign debt we have not included the new loan\r\nof £10,000,000, the stock being known as “Argentine Internal Credit,\r\n1909,” bearing 5 per cent. interest and a 1 percent. consolidated sinking\r\nfund, which the national Government has just raised in Europe. This loan,\r\nwhich was readily taken up, was divided in the following proportions:\r\nEngland, £2,960,000; France, £3,200,000; the United States, £2,000,000;\r\nGermany, £1,640,000.\r\n\r\nTaking this new loan into account the total of the external debt is\r\n£72,892,428.\r\n\r\nThe various amounts of interest payable on the whole National Debt,\r\nexternal and internal, converted into gold at the rate of 4s. per\r\npiastre, represent a total of £4,778,882. As we have stated before, this\r\nburden does not weigh exclusively on the Treasury; we must deduct from\r\nit the interest paid by the Provinces and the National Bank, or, a sum\r\nof £687,628, so that the interest paid by the nation amounts in fact to\r\n£4,111,253. Comparing this figure with the total of the general budget,\r\nwe find that the interest on the National Debt amounts to 25·34 per cent.\r\nof the total expenditure, of which 22·3 per cent. weighs exclusively on\r\nthe nation. Finally, we must not forget that large sums included in the\r\nbudget are paid into the sinking fund at a rate which should rapidly\r\ndecrease the debt; a factor which evidently must be reckoned as a\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this enormous debt are we to conclude, with certain\r\nauthors of repute, that when the payment of the interest on the public\r\ndebt absorbs more than 40 per cent. of a nation’s revenue, that nation is\r\nin the most serious situation, not far removed from bankruptcy?\r\n\r\nCertainly the theories of these gentlemen are based upon valuable data,\r\nwhich are deduced from the science of finance, or taken from the actual\r\nexamples of certain nations; but it is also certain that these theories\r\nhave been formulated with the mind directed toward European countries,\r\nin which population, wealth, and all the phenomena of social life are\r\nevolved in a slow and harmonious manner; but for countries like the\r\nArgentine, countries with enormous natural resources, subject to sudden\r\nincreases of wealth and population, where all manifestations of progress\r\nare abrupt, such theories are not true.\r\n\r\nAgain, in order to estimate justly the extent to which this debt\r\nweighs upon the nation, we must take account of the special conditions\r\nunder which this debt was created; a factor which makes international\r\ncomparisons difficult. It is not enough to know only the total of the\r\nNational Debt in order to comprehend the financial position of a State;\r\nfor it may well happen, as in the case of Australia, that the capital\r\nof the loans forming the debt has been employed in productive work, the\r\nyield of which contributes to increase the Treasury receipts.\r\n\r\nNeither can the amount of debt per inhabitant give us a true idea of the\r\nfinancial vitality of a country; for just as a given burden may crush one\r\nman, while another can bear it with ease, so, according to the physical\r\nresources of either, one nation may support a debt with ease which would\r\nutterly overcome another.[106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: M. Alfred Neymarck has shown how broken a reed is any\r\nargument based upon the amount of debt per inhabitant, and how void of\r\nany scientific basis.\r\n\r\n“We have successively passed in review the various countries of Europe,\r\nand by basing our arguments upon facts and exact figures we think we have\r\ndemonstrated that in the evaluation of a nation’s credit, of the price of\r\nits stocks and their rate of capitalisation, the figure ‘per inhabitant’\r\nhas no value and no significance. Such statistics, which are more or less\r\nused everywhere, in France and abroad, by force of habit and routine, are\r\nabsolutely incorrect and incomplete; they have only one sure result: they\r\ninfect the spirit of judgment of those who rely on them.”——In the journal\r\n_Le Rentier_, for the 7th, 17th, and 27th of September and the 7th of\r\nOctober 1904.]\r\n\r\nThe weight of the National Debt must be estimated by its relations\r\nwith the economic system and the conditions of national development.\r\nFor example, in making such an estimate with regard to the Argentine\r\ndebt, we find that side by side with the increase of this debt there\r\nis a notable increase of the national wealth, which should keep all\r\ncreditors tranquil and satisfied as to the liquidation of the obligations\r\ncontracted towards them on the part of the State, although these\r\nobligations might at first sight appear out of proportion to the means of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIf we take, as a mark of national wealth, the value of products exported,\r\nwe have the following figures to go by: between 1890 and 1899 the\r\nvalue of the Argentine exports rose from £20,163,600 to £36,983,200.\r\nIn 1903 it amounted to £44,000,000; in 1904 to £52,800,000; in 1905 to\r\n£64,400,000; in 1906 to £58,400,000; in 1907 to £59,200,000; and in 1908\r\nto £73,200,000.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the exportable products the revenues of the nation\r\nhave also achieved an extraordinary expansion, which has enabled\r\nthe Government to complete important public works, to perfect its\r\nadministration, to acquire and equip the first fleet in South America, to\r\nspread primary and secondary education through its territory, and to push\r\nits civilising agencies to the utmost limits of the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the ordinary gold receipts rose to £6,416,440, while in 1903 they\r\namounted to £8,879,420, and in 1904 to £9,345,708: but in 1899 there\r\nexisted additional importation duties, which are now suppressed. In 1907\r\nthe receipts in gold amounted to £12,900,000, and in 1908 £13,600,000.\r\n\r\nThe same increase is to be observed in the receipts collected in paper\r\nmoney. In 1898 they amounted to £4,201,495; in 1903 to £5,709,749; and in\r\n1904 they rose to £6,086,753, although the duty on wine had been removed\r\nduring the first half of the year. In 1907 these receipts amounted\r\nto £8,316,000, and in 1908 to £8,756,000; figures which represent an\r\nenormous progress.\r\n\r\nThus a country in which the national resources and those of the Exchequer\r\nincrease in so rapid a progression, is evidently in a position to\r\nsupport, without much anxiety as regards the future, the burden of its\r\nNational Debt, however enormous the latter might appear.\r\n\r\nBut such considerations must not, of course, incite the Administration\r\nto violate the financial principles of method and economy, nor lead it\r\nto increase the public expenditure at an unjustifiable pace, in order to\r\nmeet parasitic requirements, or satisfy electoral demands. What gives\r\nrise to such fears is that when there is need for works of a certain\r\ndegree of importance, such as would give a stimulus to the material\r\nprogress of the country, or at least to endow the country with new\r\nbuildings and constructive works, the budget never comes to the rescue,\r\nand the end is always an issue of internal stock.\r\n\r\nOf late years the Republic has enjoyed a pastoral and agricultural yield\r\nsuch as it has never seen in its economic existence. This double yield,\r\nthe result of energy favoured by climate, was not only remarkable for\r\nabundance, but the prices which it commanded in the international markets\r\nwere the highest that have ever been known up to the present. All would\r\nseem to indicate that in consequence of this abundance the Argentine\r\nTreasury would overflow with money; that it would be in a position to\r\nmeet all the current expenses of administration, and also many of the\r\nextraordinary expenses which are demanded by a nation in process of\r\nformation for the stimulation of its material progress.\r\n\r\nUnhappily it has not been so. The ordinary revenue, like the national\r\nproduction, has exhibited a marvellous elasticity: but in spite of that\r\nit has not been enough to cover the ordinary expenses.\r\n\r\nTurning from the shadows that obscure the picture of the financial and\r\neconomic situation, we may, in spite of all, conclude that investors who\r\nhave placed their capital in Argentine loans may be fully reassured that\r\nthe interest will be scrupulously forthcoming. Although the majority of\r\nthe loans have been employed in other ways than those intended at the\r\ntime of their issue, it is none the less true that by their aid certain\r\nworks of national utility have been effected, which could not have\r\nbeen realised without such resources. To cite only two, let us recall\r\nthe fact that the nation has spent £10,976,304 in the construction of\r\nrailways; while the Buenos Ayres Water Supply and Drainage Works absorbed\r\n£6,530,000.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the great Argentine financier Señor Tornquist has said, we must\r\nnot forget that although the country avoided a war with Chili it was only\r\nby allowing £15,000,000 to be swallowed up in ships and armaments; and\r\nthis was done without recourse to the outside world for loans, after not\r\nless than £4,000,000 had been absorbed by military preparations in the\r\ninterior. These sums, representing nearly a quarter of the present debt,\r\nwere spent to avoid a fratricidal war, which would have cost us ten times\r\nas dearly.\r\n\r\nApart from the fruitful application of loans, the creditors of the\r\nArgentine must also consider the sacrifices made by various Governments\r\nto defend and uphold the financial credit of the Republic. The service\r\nof the first loan contracted by the nation——that of 1824——was, as we\r\nknow, suspended during the melancholy period of tyranny and national\r\ndissolution; but hardly was the Argentine family reunited, hardly was\r\na regular Government established, when the latter hastened to resume\r\nthe liquidation of the liabilities which had been contracted. President\r\nAvellaneda, in a solemn moment, has eloquently recalled the facts:——\r\n\r\n“There is a new nation in the process of birth, possessed of the\r\nsentiment of its own greatness; either by a puerile hallucination or by\r\nthe revelation of its destiny. It has barely formed a Government; but\r\nalready it imagines vast schemes; it asks and obtains money from London;\r\nfor capital, although she is represented as hard and having no bowels of\r\ncompassion, knows often a sudden tenderness for dreams.\r\n\r\n“But the dreams of this people are quickly destroyed: then follows\r\nanarchy, with its long and lamentable lapses of self-knowledge: anarchy,\r\ninto which young societies fall, by the very weakness of their native\r\nelements; until at length they are seized by the iron hands of tyranny,\r\nas was indeed the fate of Argentina. And a tyranny that endured for\r\ntwenty years! Wretched nation! Unhappy Argentina! Her voice was all but\r\ndumb, failing in the depths of that abyss!...\r\n\r\n“The bonds of that debt were quoted on the London Exchange; but in\r\ntime they were quoted no more, for they had at length lost all value;\r\neven their name was erased. A day came, however, when the children of\r\nArgentina’s creditors went to search for their bonds among forgotten\r\npapers; and the bonds were redeemed. For many that was a day of\r\nlegitimate surprise; the bearers had offered their paper to their debtors\r\nat any price; but now they were told that they would receive its written\r\nvalue. It was enough for them that they should be paid in future; but\r\nthey were told that even the arrears of interest and amortisation should\r\nbe arranged by means of new stock, which was known as Deferred Bonds.\r\n\r\n“When, among its assets, a nation possesses such a trait in its life as\r\nthis——a trait unique in the financial history of the nations——it has the\r\nright to hold its head erect, affirming its honour and its credit.”\r\n\r\nSince that date, and during thirty-six years, the country scrupulously\r\npaid the interest on its debt, until the disastrous year of 1890, when,\r\nas a result of the financial and political crisis, the most violent the\r\ncountry had ever suffered, the payment of the foreign debt began to be\r\na matter of serious consideration for the Administration. Many schemes\r\nwere proposed to help the State tide over that difficult time; but none\r\nof them included the repudiation of the debt. The Government then at the\r\nhead of affairs accepted the most onerous of these schemes, because it\r\nwas that which was most to the advantage of its creditors.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement then decided on, known as the _Morituri_ loan, or Morgan\r\nloan, has been the subject of severe criticism; but one thing was not\r\nand will not be debated, namely, the noble and patriotic intention which\r\ninspired the authors of this transaction, and resolved them to safeguard\r\nthe worthy traditions of Argentine credit. By respecting their foreign\r\nliabilities they served the truest interests of their country, and\r\nrespected also the spirit of the Constitution, which holds that credit,\r\nand foreign credit in particular, should be the great constitutional\r\nresource, placed in the hands of Governments “for the urgent needs of the\r\nnation, or for undertakings of national ability.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          THE DOUBLE CURRENCY\r\n\r\nThe persistence of the double currency——The history of paper money——\r\n    The origins of the premium on gold, and its almost continual\r\n    increase——The year 1890 and the depreciation of the currency——\r\n    The causes of this depreciation; abuses in the issue of paper,\r\n    caused by a bad financial and administrative policy.\r\n\r\nRemedies suggested——Rosa’s law fixing the value of paper money and\r\n    establishing a _Caisse de Conversion_——Opposition to this law——\r\n    Its beneficent effect upon agriculture and stock-raising, which\r\n    had especial need of a stable medium of exchange——Reserve fund\r\n    created with a view to converting paper money; its vicissitudes\r\n    in the past and its present constitution——The present monetary\r\n    situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the financial history of the nations there are few examples of\r\ncountries in which the phenomenon of two standards of currency has\r\nmanifested itself so persistently and for so long a period as in the\r\nArgentine Republic. This is one of the gloomiest pages of its past,\r\non which are recorded all the errors of its rulers, all the abuses of\r\nspeculation, and all the faults of administration whose cost the present\r\ngeneration has been paying since the opening of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nSince the 27th of May 1820, the date on which the Junta of\r\nRepresentatives authorised a gradual issue of paper money, and another\r\nissue of redeemable and endorsable notes, the latter to be applied to the\r\npayment of debts contracted in the name of all the Provinces during the\r\nprevious Administrations; since 1820, we were saying, until the present\r\ntime, there have been few years indeed during which the Republic has not\r\nbeen under the empire of a double currency.[107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: In 1820 the issue of paper money was 40,000 piastres per\r\nmonth, and that of the notes was the same.]\r\n\r\nOur paper money, says an Argentine publicist, originated in an issue\r\nof 290,000 piastres by the _Banque d’Escompte_, created in virtue of a\r\nlaw of the Province of Buenos Ayres, dated the 22nd of June 1822. Four\r\nyears later, when on the 20th of January 1826 the Discount Bank was\r\ntransformed into the National Bank, the issue amounted to $2,694,856.\r\nWhen the National Bank was in turn converted into the Mint, eleven\r\nyears later——that is, on the 1st of January 1837——the issue had already\r\namounted to $15,283,540. Seventeen years later, when the Mint was\r\ntransformed into the Provincial Bank (1st January 1854), the issue\r\namounted to $203,915,206. During the twenty-seven years which elapsed\r\nbetween the creation of this bank and the passing of the monetary law of\r\n1881, the successive issues of National and Provincial Governments had\r\nincreased the mass of inconvertible paper to the sum of $882,071,156.\r\n\r\nIt was then, with gold at 2500 per cent., that the Government began to\r\nrecall all this mass of paper, replacing it by another issue, of which\r\nthe one piastre notes exchanged against 25, or a piastre’s worth of the\r\nissue which was destined to disappear.\r\n\r\nThis operation, which at a blow reduced the paper currency to a\r\ntwenty-fifth part of its original amount, also brought gold to par.[108]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: See _Las vicisitudes de nuestra moneda jiduciaria en los\r\nultimos 65 años_ (1826-1890), by F. Latzina.]\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the depreciation of paper touched its lowest point: 2483 piastre\r\nnotes were given for $100 in gold. The premium was thus 2383 per cent.\r\n\r\nBut the reader must not take this to be the only surprise that the\r\nhistory of the double standard has in store; others, still greater,\r\nremain to be told. In 1862 the depreciation was even lower, the premium\r\nreaching 2456 per cent., and 2556 piastre notes being given for $100 in\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nThe premium continued to rule high until 1867, being 2569 per cent. in\r\n1863; 2784 per cent. in 1864, 2597 per cent. in 1865, and 2406 per cent.\r\nin 1866.\r\n\r\nWe stated just now that the Republic, during a long period of history,\r\nnever escaped from the inconveniences of depreciated paper save\r\npractically on two occasions, which were unhappily of only too short\r\na duration. The first occasion was when Adolfo Alsina was Governor\r\nof the Province of Buenos Ayres. The “Bureau of Bank Exchanges” was\r\nestablished, its mission being to exchange one piastre in gold against 25\r\nin paper, and _vice versa_. This Bureau was in operation from February\r\n1867 to May 1876, the date of the suspension of metallic conversion.\r\n\r\nAfter this period the value of paper money declined anew. In May 1876\r\nthe golden coin was worth 28 piastre notes; in June, 30; in July, 33; in\r\nDecember, 29.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the average value of a golden piastre was 29 piastre notes; that\r\nis, 100 piastres in gold represented 2900 notes; in 1878 the ratio was\r\n3187; in 1879, 3220; in 1880, 3055; in 1881, 2706.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the second exception occurred, marking another\r\ncheck to the constant depreciation of paper.\r\n\r\nIn November 1881, under the Presidency of General Roca, Señor Romero\r\nbeing Minister of Finance, a law was promulgated establishing a\r\nbimetallic standard in the Argentine. The monetary unit was to be the\r\npiastre of gold or of silver; the first weighing 24.9 grains Troy, and\r\nthe second 383.8 grains, both being alloys containing nine-tenths of\r\nthe pure metal. This law also established the metallic conversion of\r\ndepreciated notes.\r\n\r\nThis operation was a beneficent advance in the economic and financial\r\nsystem of the country; for by establishing metallic conversion it gave\r\nstability to the legal instrument of monetary transactions, and also\r\ncontributed to establish an enviable state of affairs during the years\r\n1883 and 1884, which gave rise to the rosiest hopes for the future. But\r\nby an irony of fate the very Government which had suppressed the double\r\nstandard found itself forced to re-establish it in January 1885. It\r\nshould be remarked that at this time Señor Romero was no longer Minister\r\nof Finance.\r\n\r\nThe country being once more abandoned to the miserable system of\r\ninconvertibility, the depreciation of paper began its downward progress,\r\nrecalling the too celebrated case of the _assignats_, a case one would\r\nhave thought impossible of recurrence in time of peace and among a people\r\nthat had suffered no catastrophe for many years.\r\n\r\nIn June 1885 the premium rose to 50 per cent.; in 1886, it was 39 per\r\ncent.; in 1887, 35 per cent.; in July 1888 53 per cent., finally, in\r\n1889, it proceeded by leaps and bounds; 50 per cent. in January, it was\r\n53 per cent. a month later; in March it was 55 per cent., rising to 120\r\nper cent. in September and October, and 130 per cent. in November and\r\nDecember, despite the empirical measures of alleviation adopted, amid\r\nviolent disputes, by the Minister of Finance.\r\n\r\nThus the Republic entered on the year 1890; a year of grave political\r\nand financial disaster. On the one hand was the revolutionary movement,\r\nprepared by the connivance of part of the army and the navy; on the\r\nother hand, the crushing depreciation of paper, ending in an absolute\r\ncatastrophe which affected both public and private fortunes.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April of that year the premium increased to 215 per\r\ncent.; that is, 100 piastres in gold were equivalent to 315 in paper.\r\nIn July, when the revolution broke out, it stood at 217 per cent. In\r\nNovember the Government which replaced that which had been attacked\r\nby the insurgents prohibited the quotation of gold. Nevertheless, the\r\npremium rose to 225 per cent, and remained at that figure until December.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that, in spite of the downfall of paper, the economic\r\nvitality of the Republic had suffered no serious blow; no war had broken\r\nout, no international complication had occurred; there was, in short,\r\nno organic cause to which the premium could be attributed. Certainly,\r\nthe commercial balance was unfavourable; but that phenomenon has not the\r\nsignificance generally attributed to it. The true causes of this crushing\r\nstate of affairs were exclusively of a financial and administrative\r\nnature. It was the inevitable result of the manner in which paper money\r\nhad been issued to serve the needs of the Government, and to feed the\r\nfurnace of speculation. One cannot forget that at the end of 1886 the\r\ntotal issue of paper amounted to $80,251,380; that in less than two years\r\nit was nearly doubled, amounting to $147,503,911; while in 1890 the paper\r\ncurrency reached the figure of $196,882,500. But this situation, painful\r\nas it was, could not be suddenly changed for the better; other causes of\r\na like nature were about to intensify it. The new President, who came\r\ninto power after the revolutionary outbreak found himself forced, by\r\nvarious circumstances, to increase the existing circulation of paper.\r\nThe new issues amounted to $150,000,000.\r\n\r\nAs was only to be expected, such an issue on the back of the existing\r\npaper currency, which exceeded $196,000,000, could only produce a\r\ndisastrous fall in paper. Its depreciation touched the lowest point in\r\nthe history of the Argentine, or of any other country during the second\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century; the blackboard of the Stock Exchange\r\nshowed an exchange value of 464 per cent. or a premium of 364 per cent.,\r\nin the third week of October 1891. This was the record of monetary\r\ndepreciation.\r\n\r\nAfter 1892 the monthly quotation of gold, in relation to paper,\r\noscillated between 359 and 290 in 1893; 433 and 307 in 1894; 377 and 311\r\nin 1895; 352 and 266 in 1896; 317 and 274 in 1897.\r\n\r\nWe see from these figures that these conditions are abnormal,\r\nextraordinary; and yet, owing to their long duration, they are almost\r\npart of the normal life of the Republic. It is therefore a matter of\r\ninterest to study the causes of such phenomena, in order to decide\r\nwhether they are inherent in the period of transformation through which\r\nthe country is passing, in which case it would be idle to attempt any\r\nreform at present, or whether they can be controlled or checked by the\r\nemployment of means counselled by science and confirmed by experience.\r\n\r\nAccording to the judgment of certain persons who have devoted themselves\r\nto the study of economic questions, the causes which, in the Republic,\r\nproduce the double standard, are of a permanent character, proper to the\r\nperiod of formation through which the country is passing. It is even\r\nsaid that so long as Argentina has not a capital of her own with which\r\nto float herself in the full tide of affairs——such a capital as is the\r\nresult of years or centuries of prosperity——so long will she be a debtor\r\namong the nations, and the system of the double currency must continue.\r\n\r\nWe ourselves are of opinion that the causes which have produced, and\r\nnow maintain the inconversion of the fiduciary currency, are of a very\r\ndifferent character to those implied by the above judgment; and that if\r\nwe consider the economic state of the country at the moment when the\r\ndouble standard was established, we shall find that it was in no way\r\nresponsible for the phenomenon of depreciated currency. The true cause is\r\nthe necessities of the Government; determined either by factors beyond\r\nthe range of debate, such, for example, as the eventuality of a foreign\r\nwar, or by less justifiable reasons, such as deficits in the budget and\r\nreckless issues of paper. In both cases the printing-presses of the\r\nofficial banks have been set to work, in order to tide the Government\r\nover a difficult passage, at the risk of vitiating the instrument of\r\nnational credit by the efflux of inconvertible paper.\r\n\r\nThose interested should read the history of the first issues, exposed in\r\na masterly manner by Señor Augustin de Vedia, in his work on the National\r\nBank; they will see that the excessive issue of notes cannot be explained\r\nor justified by the period of economic formation which the country has\r\npassed through. We must search for other causes in order to explain this\r\nlong and unfortunate period of inconversion, which lasted, with a few\r\nyears’ respite; from 1820 down to 1905.\r\n\r\nWhat, for example, were the reasons which determined the premium on\r\ngold in 1885, under the first Presidency of General Roca? Was it, by\r\nany chance, that any economic calamity fell upon the country? Were\r\nthe harvests lost? or was there a foreign war, or even one of those\r\nrevolutionary risings so common among the South American nations? Did the\r\ngerms of some epidemic invade the country, decimating the population by\r\ndisease and poverty? Was there any violent and ruinous fall in the market\r\nprices of Argentine products?\r\n\r\nNothing of the kind befell. The Government itself, in the message in\r\nwhich it solicited the ratification of the double standard, that “the\r\nnational production, the valuation and the degree of culture of the\r\nsoil, had consolidated the national credit.” The crops were abundant;\r\nand their prices, in foreign markets, were more than fair. The Republic\r\nwas at peace, at home and abroad; thus realising one of the dreams of\r\nthe paternal administration which directed its destinies. As for the\r\npublic health, it suffered no perceptible eclipse in all the Argentine\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nIt has also been said that the commercial balances were unfavourable to\r\nthe Argentine: a country at once a debtor and a centre of immigration.\r\nAnd it has been asserted, too, that the Republic suffered from a sudden\r\nincrease of growth, without having behind it any reserves of accumulated\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe affirmation that the depreciation of the currency, and in consequence\r\nthe establishment of a double standard, arose from unfavourable\r\ncommercial balances, has no scientific basis and is not supported by\r\nprecise demonstration.\r\n\r\n“None of the countries which have suffered the misfortune of a\r\ndepreciated currency have reached that condition purely on account\r\nof adverse balances,” as a Spanish economist, Señor Edouardo Sans y\r\nEscartin, has said with justice. All countries have suffered from this\r\nevil, on account of monetary changes, and the Argentine is only the\r\nlatest example. France towards the end of the eighteenth century, England\r\nfrom 1797 to 1821, Austria and Russia since the beginning of the last\r\ncentury, the United States from 1862 to 1878, Italy since 1875, Paraguay\r\nsince 1870, and the Hispano-American Republics for the last twenty-five\r\nyears: all these countries have suffered from monetary perturbations,\r\nsome through the abuse of paper money or the excess of the fiduciary\r\ncirculation, others through the variations of the relation of gold to\r\nsilver. In none of these countries did the crisis take the form of the\r\nconsequence of unfavourable commercial balances.\r\n\r\nWe find, in fact, that it is not the case that economic causes, resulting\r\neither from the formative period the country has traversed, or from its\r\nlack of accumulated capital, have contributed and are still contributing\r\nin the Argentine Republic to prolong the system of inconversion; the\r\ncauses are exclusively financial and administrative, as we have already\r\nmaintained.[109]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: The famous Italian economist, Eteocle Lorini, maintained\r\nin a book which he published in 1902 (_La Republica Argentina e i suoi\r\nmaggiori problemi di Economia e di Finanza_). that the Republic has\r\nnever possessed money, but only a simple legal tender or instrument of\r\nexchange.]\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at the circumstances which have determined the state of\r\nmonetary inconversion which has afflicted the country ever since it\r\nbecame a nation, we must now examine the remedies which the public\r\npowers have suggested in the hope of emerging from this detestable state\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\nEvery presidency has declared its firm intention of redeeming or reducing\r\nthe paper currency in circulation; but none of them has obtained results\r\nthat we can really regard as final.\r\n\r\nOf all the attempts to terminate the condition of inconvertibility,\r\nto give stability to the currency, and to prepare, in a more or less\r\nproximate future, for the establishment of a sane monetary system, the\r\nmost earnest and scientific, and that which had the happiest results, was\r\nthat which emanated from the proposal presented to Congress in August\r\n1899 by the ex-Minister of Finance, Señor José-Maria Rosa, which has\r\nsince then become law: the present law of the conversion of the fiduciary\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of reform of this eminent statesman was worked out on the\r\nfollowing basis:——\r\n\r\n    1. Immediately to fix the rate at which the future conversion would\r\n      be effected, in conformity with the actual and contemporary value\r\n      of the currency. The fixing of a definite rate was necessary\r\n      in order to consolidate the then existing state of affairs, to\r\n      suppress the premium, and to give transactions a positive basis,\r\n      without indefinitely retarding the possibility of conversion; and\r\n      also to prepare for the liquidation of old issues, and to deliver\r\n      the country to some extent from the gigantic burden of its issues.\r\n\r\n    2. To form a large metallic fund to guarantee this conversion and to\r\n      make it possible for money to become stable during this period.\r\n\r\n    3. To maintain a fixed standard by these two means:——\r\n\r\n        (_a_) The creation, in the _Caisse de Conversion_, of a\r\n          bureau operating as an automatic regulator, in conformity\r\n          with the tightness or slackness of money, and according\r\n          to the necessities of the market; thus making elastic the\r\n          paper currency, the circulation of which might increase\r\n          or decrease, on account of the quantity of gold given out\r\n          in exchange.\r\n\r\n        (_b_) The intervention of the Bank of the Nation in matters\r\n          of international exchanges.\r\n\r\nIt was on these lines that the Minister drew up, and Congress adopted, a\r\nlaw which enacted that the nation should convert, during a fixed period,\r\nat a convenient time, the whole fiduciary circulation into Argentine\r\ngold coinage, at the rate of one paper piastre for 44 centavos of a gold\r\npiastre. This same law ordered the formation of a Conversion Fund, with\r\nresources which it enumerated; and finally it established in the _Caisse\r\nde Conversion_ a bureau for the exchange of paper into gold and _vice\r\nversa_ to all who might apply, at the rate of one paper piastre for .44\r\nof a gold piastre.\r\n\r\nFew laws have been so beneficial as this law of monetary conversion was\r\nto the Argentine Republic. The present prosperous economic conditions of\r\nthe country are the work of this law; it constitutes the glory of Roca’s\r\nGovernment, which gave it birth and enjoyed its first fruits.\r\n\r\nYet we must emphasise the fact that this law, so beneficial to the\r\npublic, was at the outset repudiated not only by the President, who, to\r\navoid subscribing to it, forced his Minister to send in his resignation,\r\nbut also by the principal organs of the press, at the head of which was\r\nthat important journal _La Nacion_, and again by the Professor of Finance\r\nat the University——M. Terry——who was all for conversion on a sliding\r\nscale; that is, for the worst method conceivable, as by maintaining the\r\ncondition of instability he would have adjourned the question instead of\r\nsolving it. But thanks to the rare energy and the intelligent propaganda\r\nof Señor Rosa, the sole author of the law, effectually supported\r\nby Senator Pellegrini and Señor Tornquist, this important step was\r\naccomplished, despite all the obstacles which barred the way.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time this law, so strongly opposed before its birth,\r\nproduced marvellously beneficial effects upon the economic life of the\r\nRepublic. It gave stability to the currency; that is, it endowed the\r\nArgentine with one of the greatest blessings a commercial and productive\r\nnation can enjoy.\r\n\r\nTo be convinced of this fact it is enough to run the eye over the column\r\nof metallic quotations on the Exchange, published in the “Statistical\r\nAnnual of the City of Buenos Ayres.”[110]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: _Annuaire statistique de la Villa de Buenos Ayres._——The\r\ntransactions in metallic values effected on the Buenos Ayres Exchange in\r\n1899 (before the passing of the law), amounted in value to £109,817,116,\r\nor $1,234,579,370 paper, while in 1908 there were none. Any one wishing\r\nto exchange gold for paper or paper for gold to-day, goes to the _Caisse\r\nde Conversion_, where the exchange is effected without any charge.]\r\n\r\nThis law has killed speculation on exchange values, which before it was\r\npassed had assumed scandalous proportions, and went far to developing\r\nthroughout the country that passion for gambling which is even now a\r\ncorroding cancer at the heart of the young Republic.[111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: As the _Annuaire statistique_ declares, in the course of\r\nthe year 1908 no less than £8,160,000 changed hands over the sale and\r\npurchase of lottery tickets and betting on racehorses. This is an evil\r\nthat may grow into a national calamity if nothing is done to arrest it;\r\nand we see with pleasure that the Government has stated its intention of\r\npresenting to Congress the draft of a law prohibiting lotteries.]\r\n\r\nThis law also provided for the formation of a Conversion Fund, which\r\nwas a powerful factor——_si vis pacem para bellum_——in the pacific\r\nsolution of the old frontier dispute with Chili. This fund amounts\r\nto-day to £5,100,000 deposited in the Bank of the Nation, and would,\r\nwithout this far-sighted law, have been swallowed up in the whirlpool of\r\nadministrative expenses.\r\n\r\nLastly, the law of monetary conversion has been the salvation of\r\nagriculture and stock-raising, the two chief sources of national wealth,\r\nby preventing the too rapid change in the value of paper, which is\r\na result that deserves to be considered with attention. The law was\r\npromulgated at a time when a large harvest was expected, and when, from\r\nthat very cause, the depreciation of paper violently increased, the value\r\nfalling from 278 in August 1898 to 206 in December of the same year. It\r\nis certain that at this rate the depreciation would finally have touched\r\n150, to the greater profit of the speculators.\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened had the monetary situation altered so\r\nrapidly? The Argentine agriculturalist or stock-raiser, having paid\r\nall the expenses of production with gold at about 300 per cent., would\r\nhave been forced, by reason of the rapid depreciation of paper, to\r\nsell his products at a price which would no longer compensate him\r\nfor his increased expenditure. This would inevitably have ruined the\r\nproducer——that is, the principal artisan of the national fortune. Far\r\nfrom opening up new lands with his ploughshare, as hitherto had always\r\nbeen the case, he would have abandoned the land already under cultivation.\r\n\r\nWe need not describe the disaster which would have overcome the country\r\nunder such conditions as these: the loss of credit both at home and\r\nabroad. The stream of immigration would have been suspended; emigration,\r\non the contrary, would have increased, taking the form of a veritable\r\nexodus, even of a flight; and each impoverished and disillusioned\r\nemigrant, as he left the Argentine, would have proclaimed that the\r\ncountry was ruined. As a result the Argentine would have been for years\r\npartially depopulated, or at least deprived of the new recruits which\r\nimmigration brings in, and of whom it has such need in order to realise\r\nthe value of more virgin territory.\r\n\r\nWorse still: once the harvest was sold, at prices which could no longer\r\nbe calculated on the basis of the cost, gold, now freed from all\r\nrestraint, like a balloon whose mooring is broken, would have resumed\r\nits upward journey. The melancholy spectacle of 1890 and 1891 would\r\nhave been repeated; gold would have risen by leaps and bounds, in\r\ncontradictory and incalculable rushes, finally to reach the limits that\r\nmean bankruptcy.[112]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: We remember that gold, which on the 9th of August 1890\r\nstood at 35 per cent. when a new Government came into power, had risen\r\nto 425 per cent. by May 1891, and in October of the same year touched\r\n464 per cent.; the highest premium ever known in the long history of the\r\ndouble standard during the last half of the nineteenth century. In the\r\nUnited States during the war of secession, the premium on gold rose to\r\n286 per cent. only (on July the 4th 1864).]\r\n\r\nSuch are the disastrous results which would have ensued had not the\r\nlaw of monetary conversion come just in time to restrain the rapid\r\ndepreciation of paper, and to give money the stability it must possess\r\nif it is to be the faithful and precise instrument of commercial\r\ntransactions, the common measure of all exchanges. Such were the\r\nbeneficent results which followed shortly upon the operation of the\r\nlaw; and we can only regret that it has not always been understood and\r\napplied with sufficient force by those who were responsible for putting\r\nit into practice. The Governments which have followed since then have not\r\nalways followed the ideal of economy and scrupulous administration which\r\nshould ensure the success of this important reform. None the less, the\r\nConversion Fund amounts to-day to £5,100,000.\r\n\r\nAccording to the figures for October 1909 the monetary situation of the\r\ncountry may be summed up as follows:——\r\n\r\nThe total of notes in circulation amounts to $686,291,704 paper,\r\nequivalent to £60,393,670. The Conversion Fund of £5,100,000 in gold,\r\nadded to £34,752,058 on deposit in the _Caisse de Conversion_ and to the\r\n£14,073,515 deposited in the various banks of the capital, forms a total\r\nof £53,925,573. It follows from these eloquent figures that the fiduciary\r\ncirculation, notes, nickel, and copper, is guaranteed in Argentina by\r\nan actual value of 65.9 per cent. of its total; the notes alone are\r\nguaranteed by 89 per cent. of gold.\r\n\r\nUnquiet spirits from time to time, including the enemies of monetary\r\nreform, announce their opinion in the press that this law should be\r\nmodified. Quite lately the well-known journal _La Nacion_, which is\r\ndistinguished by the constancy and fervour with which it attacks this\r\nbeneficent measure, has opened its columns to an enquiry, in order to\r\nobtain the opinion of the public, or at least of persons competent in\r\nsuch matters. Happily common-sense triumphed; the law remains intact,\r\ncontinuing to benefit the whole national economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                       THE _CAISSE DE CONVERSION_\r\n\r\nThe principles on which the establishment of this institution is\r\n    based——The necessity of a rapid redemption of fiduciary money——\r\n    The imperfect success of this programme——New issues of notes——\r\n    New attributes of the _Caisse_ dating from 1899——The exchange\r\n    of paper for gold and _vice versa_——The development of this\r\n    system of exchange——The authority attaching to the _Caisse_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the official institutions which are closely connected with the\r\nissue and redemption of paper money, the _Caisse de Conversion_ demands\r\na special place, on account of the important part which it plays in\r\nthe financial life of the Republic. This establishment was created in\r\n1890, at a moment particularly critical for the credit of the country,\r\nwhen the terrible crisis occurred which ruined several banks and\r\nresulted in a depreciation of the fiduciary currency which exceeded all\r\nexpectation. The Government which presided over the destinies of the\r\ncountry understood that it was necessary, in order to ameliorate such a\r\nsituation, to put some means into practice which should ensure a more\r\ngradual movement of paper, its reduction in no matter what form, and its\r\nfuture convertibility within a short and definite period, as the message\r\ndeclared which accompanied the draft of the law submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to these excellent principles of financial and banking\r\npolicy, it proposed the creation of a Junta or a special Directorate,\r\n“independent in its action, and uniting the necessary faculties for the\r\nrecovery, administration, and application of the elements that must be\r\nconfided to it for the effectual accomplishment of its important mission.”\r\n\r\nAn “important mission” it was indeed that was confided to the Junta by\r\nlaw; for this body was to see the gradual conversion and redemption of\r\npaper money, supervise the strict execution of all the laws relating to\r\npaper money, and oversee all issues of the same.\r\n\r\nWith the object of effecting, sooner or later, the actual and effective\r\nconversion of paper money, the law created a “Conversion Fund,”\r\ncomposed of the metallic reserves of the guaranteed banks, the sums for\r\nwhich these same banks would be debitors on account of the value of\r\nstock bought as guarantees, the public funds issued to guarantee the\r\nbank issues, and all the sums which, in virtue of other legislative\r\nenactments, might be destined to the conversion of bank paper, and\r\nespecially those proceeding from economies made out of the general\r\nbudgets.\r\n\r\nThe Executive attached a special significance to this fund, proposing to\r\nuse it to great advantage in the future; if the succeeding Governments\r\nhad the wisdom to maintain the elements indispensable to the regular\r\ncirculation of the national currency.\r\n\r\nThese details prove that the fundamental idea at the bottom of the\r\ncreation of the _Caisse de Conversion_ was that of effecting, by its\r\nhelp, and by utilising the resources with which it was endowed, a rapid\r\nredemption of paper money. This intention, moreover, was solemnly\r\naffirmed at home and abroad when the contract was signed with the\r\nEnglish bankers for the issue in 1891 of the loan known as the “Funding\r\nLoan,” amounting to £15,000,000; in virtue of which loan the Government\r\nundertook to withdraw from circulation, during each of the years 1891,\r\n1892, and 1893, $15,000,000 in notes, or $45,000,000 in the three years.\r\n\r\nUnhappily the Government’s good intentions had no practical issue; the\r\n_Caisse de Conversion_, from the first moments of its existence, found it\r\nimpossible to fulfil its object.\r\n\r\nSo the proposal to withdraw $15,000,000 a year went no further than a\r\nbeautiful ideal; it never took definite shape as a reality. In 1891\r\n$1,696,676 in paper were burned; they came from an additional customs\r\nduty on certain imports. In 1892 $1,463,424, having the same origin, were\r\ndisposed of in the same way. Besides this a sum of $3,511,600, provided\r\nby the payments made by the National Bank and the Bank of the Province\r\nof Buenos Ayres on account of $35,116,000 lent them by the Government\r\nin order to help them out of a greatly embarrassed condition, was also\r\nburned. The balance-sheet of receipts and expenditures drawn up every\r\nyear by the _Comptabilité Générale_ records only $1,248,032 as burned\r\nin 1891, and $3,586,255 in 1892, or $4,834,287 in two years; a very\r\ndifferent sum to the 30 millions which the Government had promised to\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\nThus the _Caisse de Conversion_, from which the Minister of Finance\r\nhad hoped so much, failed at its birth, and as an institution gave no\r\npositive results. So it was not necessary, as the Minister of Finance,\r\nSeñor V. F. Lopez, pleasantly remarked, to await the appreciation of\r\nfuture Governments.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all; instead of redeeming the promised quantities of\r\nfiduciary money, the Government which was then directing the destinies\r\nof the country——we must believe that it was compelled by circumstances,\r\nwhich are so often more potent than the human will——the Government\r\nactually found itself forced to increase the total of paper in\r\ncirculation by emitting, for various reasons, further issues of notes.\r\n\r\nDominated by circumstances, it issued in 1890 $35,116,000, in order to\r\nlegalise the excess of an issue delivered to the National Bank and the\r\nBank of the Province of Buenos Ayres. In the course of the same year it\r\ncreated an issue of 60 millions more, in order to furnish the National\r\nBank with 25 millions, the National Mortgage Bank with 25 millions,\r\nand the City of Buenos Ayres with 10 millions. In 1891 it issued 50\r\nmillions in order to found the Bank of the Argentine Nation, and finally\r\n5 millions more for the Mortgage Bank. In short, urged by necessity, the\r\nGovernment created $150,000,000 of paper in two years, which on the top\r\nof a previous issue of $161,766,590 in paper was naturally followed by\r\ndisastrous results.\r\n\r\nThe Government which took charge of the administration in 1892 also\r\nmanifested, in its programme, its firm intention of increasing the value\r\nof paper money by its gradual redemption; an operation which would,\r\nof course, be the duty of the _Caisse de Conversion_. To this end it\r\nincluded the necessary sums in the budget, and $865,426 were burned in\r\n1893 and $8,000,394 in 1894. But the results obtained by this measure\r\nwere far from responding to the hopes which were founded upon it;\r\nalthough the Government religiously and with much solemnity, burned on\r\nthe 15th of each month a determined sum of paper money——usually half a\r\nmillion——the value of paper, far from rising, fell further and further\r\nbelow that of gold.\r\n\r\nThe Government finally saw that its plan was useless; and hastened to\r\nexplain itself by the mouth of its Minister of Finance, who declared that\r\n“the executive power recognises that the withdrawal of eight millions of\r\npiastres per annum cannot fundamentally alter the price of our paper; but\r\nwhat it does affirm is that this quantity will be sufficient, provided\r\nthe production of the country increases, provided that the exports exceed\r\nthe imports; that is to say, provided that the international balances are\r\nin favour of the Republic.”\r\n\r\nWe may say in passing that these two desired factors were realised; but\r\nnot the expected advantage, for the Government again made the mistake of\r\nissuing 15 millions of internal stock, bearing interest (£1,320,000),\r\nwhile at the same time it extinguished another debt, also domestic, which\r\ndid not bear interest.\r\n\r\nAll these details prove in a conclusive fashion that the original and\r\norganic functions of the _Caisse de Conversion_ were inverted from the\r\ntime of its creation; converting that institution into a factor of\r\ndepression in all that concerned the paper currency, instead of being the\r\ninstrument of increasing its value.\r\n\r\nAfter this date the _Caisse_ operated as a secondary and harmless\r\ndepartment of the public Administration; leading an almost forgotten\r\nexistence, until the year 1899, when the law of monetary conversion was\r\npassed, which entrusted it with two missions of great importance, which\r\nwere destined to exercise a beneficent influence upon the fiduciary\r\ncirculation, and therefore upon the economic life of the Republic.\r\n\r\nOne of these two missions had as its object the establishment of an\r\noffice for the exchange of paper into gold and _vice versa_, at the rate\r\nof 2.2727 piastres in paper for 1 piastre in gold. The other consisted\r\nin forming a Conversion Fund, to which more or less important resources\r\nwere assigned. This fund amounted in 1902 to £2,400,000 in gold, but at\r\na moment when an international complication was believed to be imminent\r\nthis sum was placed at the disposal of the Government by authorisation of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe Government eventually returned £2,000,000 of this sum, and since\r\nthen the fund has constantly increased, amounting in 1907 to £5,100,000,\r\nas we stated when speaking, in the passages relating to the issues of\r\npaper money affected by the _Caisse de Conversion_, of the results of the\r\napplication of this new law.\r\n\r\nThe law to which we are referring was put into execution on the 9th\r\nof December 1899. On that day the first transaction under the new law\r\nwas effected; the _Caisse_ received 100 piastres in gold, in exchange\r\nfor which it returned the equivalent in notes, in the proportion of 44\r\ncentavos of gold to a piastre note. The balance drawn on the 31st of\r\nDecember showed the existence of £292.6 in gold. At this same date the\r\nfiduciary currency in circulation amounted in all to $295,149,735.\r\n\r\nLet us now look into the operations of the _Caisse de Conversion_ after\r\nthis date.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1900 $18,398,449 (£3,679,690) in gold was received; but\r\nas this sum was eventually withdrawn the fiduciary circulation soon\r\nreached its former figure.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 there was nothing done; that is, the _Caisse_ received no gold.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 scarcely anything was done; £4209 was received, and £3636 was\r\npaid out, leaving a balance of £573. The operations for 1902 began in\r\nOctober, during which month the _Caisse_ received £68, 12s.; it paid\r\nout £67, 12s., so that £1 remained. In November the takings increased\r\nto £1497, and the outgoings were £1466, leaving a balance of £31. In\r\nDecember £2639 were taken and £2102 issued, leaving a balance of £537.\r\n\r\nOnly in 1903 did the operations of the _Caisse de Conversion_ amount to\r\nanything. The two principal causes of this state of affairs were, firstly\r\nthe settlement of the frontier dispute with Chili, a question which had\r\ncaused serious alarm, and had resulted in enormous official expenses\r\nduring the few previous years; and secondly the size of the commercial\r\nbalances. Bearing this in mind, it is not surprising that the amount of\r\ngold in the _Caisse de Conversion_, and, consequently the issues of\r\npaper money, should have commenced to increase and have continued to do\r\nso until they reached the proportions which they have since attained.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 £9,208,284 in gold was taken, and £1,576,625 paid out; leaving\r\n£7,648,229. The busiest months were April, when £2,519,048 was taken, and\r\nMarch, when the takings were £1,738,395. The largest outgoings were in\r\nMarch and July, amounting respectively to £239,133 and £222,104.\r\n\r\nIn succeeding years the metallic reserve of the _Caisse de Conversion_\r\nhas continually increased, thanks to the favourable sense of the economic\r\nbalances of the nation’s trade, and the capital which has entered the\r\nRepublic, to be employed in the establishment of new industries, or the\r\ncreation of railways, tramways, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing the metallic reserve of the _Caisse de Conversion_\r\nhas lately increased to £34,752,058, which, added to the £5,100,000 of\r\nthe Conversion Fund, gives a total of £39,852,058. The proportion of\r\nthese reserves to the paper currency in circulation is to-day 65.9 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law the increase of the metallic balance in the _Caisse\r\nde Conversion_ has inevitably caused, as a natural consequence, the\r\nparallel increase of the issues of notes, nickel, and silver, of which\r\nthe amount in circulation increased to $688,177,998 on 31st October 1909,\r\nor $393,028,267 more than on 31st December 1899, the year in which the\r\nlaw of monetary conversion was voted, and in which the same circulation\r\namounted to $295,149,731.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the emission of paper has increased has caused\r\ncertain journals, and especially those which have been prominent in\r\nattacking the law of monetary conversion (whose beneficial effects they\r\nwere yet powerless to deny) to raise cries of alarm, thinking to see\r\nin this increase a future economic peril, or the seeds of a dangerous\r\ncrisis, due to the inflation which, in their judgment, is produced by\r\nsuch issues. But it is easy to prove that these alarms are not justified\r\nfrom the moment when such issues are guaranteed by a corresponding\r\ndeposit of metallic currency in the _Caisse de Conversion_. Moreover,\r\na very little reflection will show that one cannot help admitting that\r\nthis gold, being the product of the ever-increasing economic balances\r\nof the country, will affect the monetary situation equally if instead of\r\nbeing in reserve in the _Caisse de Conversion_ it is to be found in the\r\nstrong-rooms of private banks.\r\n\r\nAs we may see from these data, the _Caisse de Conversion_ has completely\r\nchanged its _rôle_. It has abandoned its original function, which was\r\nconfided to it by the law; namely, the redemption of the fiduciary\r\ncurrency and the re-establishment of the monetary equilibrium when\r\ndestroyed by excessive issues of paper. To-day this institution is merely\r\na purely mechanical department of the Administration, and its functions\r\nmight be fulfilled, at any rate theoretically, by other administrative\r\ndepartments which are closely connected with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n            THE BALANCE-SHEET OF THE ARGENTINE ACCORDING TO\r\n                      THE INVENTORY OF SECURITIES\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTORY OF MOVABLE PROPERTY OR SECURITIES——The capital\r\n    represented by movable properties, stocks, bonds, shares, etc.,\r\n    is the only kind of capital which lends itself to statistics——\r\n    The great groups of movable properties: National Funds, Railway\r\n    Shares, Insurance Companies, Foreign Banks, Mortgage Companies,\r\n    and agricultural and industrial undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe nominal amount of capital represented by movable values——Table\r\n    of the annual revenues of the same, and the sinking fund——\r\n    Division of this revenue among the different countries having\r\n    capital invested in the Argentine.\r\n\r\nEnglish capital——The importance of English investments in all\r\n    branches of Argentine activity——The benefits of a reaction in\r\n    favour of Argentine capital——French capital; its small value\r\n    compared to English capital——German capital and its rapid\r\n    increase——Approximate valuation of that portion of revenue\r\n    remaining in the Argentine, and of that which goes to the\r\n    various nations having capital invested in the country.\r\n\r\nTHE BALANCE-SHEET——The assets are principally composed of\r\n    exportation values; the liabilities, the value of imports——\r\n    The revenue of investments exported to foreign countries, and\r\n    the total of the sums expended by the Argentine abroad——Table\r\n    giving a summarised Balance-sheet and the balance in favour of\r\n    the Argentine——International exchanges and the importation of\r\n    gold confirm this favourable situation——Argentine capital will\r\n    presently play a more important part in the country as compared\r\n    with foreign capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE INVENTORY OF MOVABLE VALUES\r\n\r\nThe time has come to sum up our conclusions, and we cannot do better than\r\nattempt to present the figures of the movements of the capital invested\r\nin the Argentine, and by stating, as far as possible, its yield. We have\r\nalready had occasion to declare that Europe has not turned her attention\r\nto the young South American Republic for sentimental reasons, nor on\r\naccount of the beauty of her political institutions nor the splendour of\r\nher landscapes. What interests the general public is the extraction of\r\nthe riches of the Argentine soil; the economic and industrial expansion\r\nof the country, and its fitness as a field for investment and original\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nTo respond to this mental attitude we have thought it proper to undertake\r\na dry and impartial inquiry into the value of the capital invested in the\r\nArgentine, and the total of its yield. Capital represented by movable\r\nvalues is the only factor which has in some sense an official existence\r\nwhich is amenable to control; it lends itself to statistics sufficiently\r\nprecise to allow of our estimating, from this point of view, the wealth\r\nof a country; and it is consequently in this direction that we may\r\nsearch for a standard with which to compare the favourable estimates\r\nexpressed in our preceding chapters on the subject of the development and\r\nprosperity of the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\nThis inventory will lead us to other data, which are equally instructive.\r\nIn reviewing the movable values and in estimating their yield we shall at\r\nthe same time examine into the general movement of foreign capital and\r\nits earnings, so that we shall be able approximately to state the amount\r\nand the profits of the capital invested by the various European nations\r\nwhich have dealt with this country.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of these statistics we shall finally see the situation\r\nof the Argentine, which the results of its foreign trade have shown\r\nus only imperfectly, in its true light. Although the country has an\r\nextremely favourable commercial balance, which in 1908 was not less than\r\n£24,000,000, this sum has to support enormous charges for the payment\r\nof interest on loans placed abroad: the dividends of railway companies,\r\nof banking houses, of all manner of land companies, of commercial and\r\nindustrial companies, whose shareholders are abroad, etc. etc. These are\r\nthe sums we are trying to determine, in order to draw up as exactly as\r\npossible the balance-sheet of the Argentine.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will therefore be devoted to estimating on the one hand what\r\nthe country owes to foreign capital, and on the other hand what profit\r\nforeign capital draws from its investment in the Argentine. It is to some\r\nextent the current account of Europe and the Argentine that we wish\r\nto present, taking as our basis the movable values, which are the only\r\nserious data upon which we can base our inquiry.[113]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: In this book we make use of the figures which Señor\r\nAlberto Martinez communicated to the International Statistical Congress,\r\nheld in Paris in July 1909.]\r\n\r\nThe nominal total of Argentine movable values subscribed up to the 21st\r\nDecember 1908 was £474,396,935 (in gold), of which sum £219,513,399\r\nrepresents shares, £104,502,163 bonds, and £150,381,572 the public debt\r\nof the Nation, the Provinces, the municipalities, the capital of State\r\nrailways, and the capital of the Bank of the Nation.\r\n\r\nIf we compare these figures with the inventory of the movable values\r\nexisting at the end of December 1904, we shall find an increase of\r\n£157,173,555. But if we take account of the fact that in the first\r\namount the cedulas of the Province of Buenos Ayres figure to the value\r\nof £15,400,000, while in the second they amount to £10,400,000 only (the\r\namount of shares admitted to conversion by the Government), we see that\r\nthe difference is considerably greater.\r\n\r\nThis increase does not arise exclusively from the new shares issued by\r\ncompanies created during the last two years; a large proportion is due to\r\nexisting companies, which have at last decided to furnish the information\r\ndemanded in view of this new inventory. But a certain number of companies\r\nstill remain outside the inventory, whose stock would increase the total\r\nby 5 or 6 million pounds.\r\n\r\nHere is the list of the stock in circulation on the 31st December 1908:\r\n\r\n    _Summary of Securities in Circulation on 31st December 1908,\r\n                      and their Subscribed Capital._\r\n\r\n

This capital increases daily,\r\nand considering the development of the network of railways all over the\r\ncountry, it is not fantastic to prophesy that in a short time this sum\r\nwill reach the figure of perhaps £200,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe second large group consists of the securities representing the\r\nExternal National Debt, which on the 31st December 1908 stood at\r\n£62,900,000, or £7,400,000 lower than that of the debt in circulation on\r\n1st July 1905. This diminution arises from the redemption of bonds by\r\nmeans of the 6 per cent. Funding Loan, of which the total was £5,600,000.\r\n\r\nIf to the amount of this debt we add the sums represented by the external\r\ndebt of certain cities, the internal debt of the nation, and the internal\r\ndebt of some of the Provinces, we find that the entire Argentine National\r\nDebt forms a total of £130,000,000. We need not examine at greater\r\nlengths the composition and value of these two groups of securities, as\r\nwe have already dealt with them in special chapters.\r\n\r\nAs for the insurance companies and foreign banks, any estimate of their\r\ncapital is difficult; but it is otherwise in the case of the mortgage\r\ncompanies. The capital which these companies have invested in the\r\nArgentine is now of a nominal value of more than £16,500,000. But this\r\nis only a small portion of the foreign capital invested in mortgages in\r\nthe Argentine; for the high interest earned by this class of investment,\r\nwhich a short time back rose to 10 per cent., has attracted large sums\r\nof foreign money which have been invested privately. Señor Tornquist\r\nestimates the foreign capital thus put out in mortgages at £9,000,000.\r\n\r\nWe must call attention to the interesting fact that the amount of foreign\r\ncapital invested in the agricultural and other rural undertakings of\r\nthe Argentine increases day by day. At the end of 1908 this capital\r\namounted to £8,726,037, of which the greater part was the property\r\nof British subjects, who first devoted their energies to agriculture\r\nand stock-raising in the Argentine a comparatively long time ago. It\r\nis the English who have been the most active agents of the rapid and\r\nextraordinary progress of Argentine stock-raising, especially in all that\r\nrelates to the selection of breeds and the best manner of feeding.\r\n\r\nAmong the industrial undertakings, that which has of late years assumed\r\nthe greatest importance is the frozen or chilled-meat industry——the\r\nrefrigerating industry. There are now nine refrigerating establishments,\r\nwith a subscribed capital of £3,993,915. Other industrial undertakings,\r\nsuch as sugar factories, breweries, quebracho mills, and mines, are\r\nbeginning to take a significant place in the list of Argentine securities.\r\n\r\nThe nominal total of all movable values being estimated, at the end of\r\n1908, at £474,396,933, the question which now occurs is, What is the\r\nannual yield of these securities? This is the most difficult point of our\r\ninquiry, and one we can answer only by approximate estimates.\r\n\r\nWhile it is simplicity itself to calculate the interest on the bonds of\r\nthe public debt, whether external or domestic, it is anything but easy\r\nto calculate in all cases the dividends paid by each company to its\r\nshareholders. Some companies do not publish balance-sheets, and others\r\nconfound the profits realised in the Argentine with the profits earned by\r\ntheir foreign houses or headquarters.\r\n\r\nAs far as our present knowledge goes, the revenue of the securities we\r\nhave mentioned may be estimated to be as follows:——\r\n\r\n          _Annual Revenue, of the Securities of the Argentine\r\n                     Republic, 31st December 1908._\r\n\r\n        NAME OR NATURE OF SECURITIES.

Such is the\r\nquestion we must now set ourselves, as one of the most important relating\r\nto the country’s future. Blessed with an immense area of territory,\r\nmistress of enormous and unexhausted natural wealth, and peopled by only\r\n6 millions of inhabitants, the Argentine is a nation still in process of\r\nformation. She attracts men and money from all quarters of the globe; for\r\nshe promises generous payment for initiative and for labour.\r\n\r\nFrom the economic standpoint, then, it is of enormous importance for the\r\nArgentine whether the revenue of her securities goes to persons residing\r\nin the country, or whether, on the other hand, it goes abroad, thus\r\nunfavourably affecting the result of her commercial transactions, and\r\nthreatening to upset the balance of international payments.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a country which exists under the special conditions which\r\naffect the Argentine, where there are no accumulations of capital, where\r\nthe spirit of enterprise is not very highly developed, and where every\r\ncommercial or industrial undertaking of any importance has to look to the\r\nouter world for support, the total of the sums which leave the country\r\neach year to pay for imported articles, to meet the interest on the\r\nNational Debt, to pay the dividends on the shares of limited companies,\r\nand the profits of private undertakings, the interest on capital out on\r\nloan, whether on mortgage or otherwise secured, and finally to remunerate\r\ncapital invested and employed in the thousand different ways peculiar to\r\nthis period of rapid intercommunication——the total of all these sums must\r\nbe very great; something, indeed, like a metallic river rolling across\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nSo much being granted, the moment has come to present the problem: of the\r\n22 million pounds required to pay the interest on loans, the sinking-fund\r\ncharges for their redemption, and the dividends of hundreds of companies,\r\nwhat is the proportion which each year leaves the Argentine to become\r\nspent or invested abroad, assuring the owners of bonds and shares the\r\nbest part of the revenue of a distant country, a country endowed with a\r\nfertile soil, in which industry has a great future awaiting it? And what\r\nproportion of this total remains in the country?\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, it would be necessary to follow the track of each\r\nof the shares or bonds issued, in order to discover the destination of\r\neach; and this is what we shall attempt to do, with the help of the\r\nprincipal banking houses and the great commercial houses in financial\r\nrelations with the outer world.\r\n\r\nAlthough all estimates on such a subject must rest upon the slightest\r\nfoundations, and cannot be accepted as precise statistics, we do not\r\nhesitate to give a few figures as an indication worthy of credence, being\r\ndrawn from the best possible sources.\r\n\r\nTo proceed with due method, let us begin with the most important\r\ndivision of the foreign capital invested in the Argentine, namely,\r\nEnglish capital, which was the first to come from abroad to stimulate the\r\nprogress of the country. According to an inventory made by the banking\r\nhouse of Tornquist & Co., which has willingly given us the information\r\nwe required, the capital imported from England and invested in Argentine\r\nsecurities amounts to more than £290,000,000, distributed as follows:——\r\n\r\n              _English Capital Invested in the Argentine._\r\n\r\n                                                    Capital.

In 1822, when\r\nshe was still insignificant both in riches and in population, Argentina\r\nknocked for the first time on the doors of British capitalists, asking\r\nthem to lend a million pounds to be used for the construction of a\r\nharbour, for the instalment of waterworks in her capital, and for the\r\nfoundation of cities; projects which were never executed; for it was with\r\nthis loan as it was to be afterwards with many other Argentine loans.\r\nThe funds demanded on credit were not employed to further the object for\r\nwhich they were solicited. After this first loan all other Argentine\r\nloans were subscribed by British capital.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no industrial or commercial undertaking has been established\r\nin this country but it has gone to seek the breath of life in the\r\nfinancial houses of the City. Professor Eteocle Lorini said with reason,\r\nin commenting on this fact in his book, _Il Debito Publico Argentino_:\r\n“All the industrial, commercial, agricultural and mining companies which\r\nfurnish our Argentine statistics bear the foreign mark, _limited_; so\r\nthat one ends by getting the impression that one is studying a purely\r\nEnglish colony, for one finds this _limited_ upon all species of\r\nmanufactures; _limited_ after the statement of capitals; all undertakings\r\nare _limited_; insurance is _limited_; the circulation and distribution\r\nof Argentine wealth is _limited_.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the importance of the limited company, it is by no means\r\nto the interest of the Argentine to declare war upon foreign capital;\r\nshe should, on the contrary, respect the far-seeing provisions of her\r\nConstitution, which imposes upon Congress the duty of encouraging the\r\nintroduction of foreign capital conjointly with a foreign population,\r\nbecause both are vital elements of the national development and progress.\r\nBut while we respect this tradition we feel that the Government should,\r\nin counteraction, endeavour to stimulate the application of Argentine\r\ncapital to commercial or industrial enterprises, in order that the entire\r\nresources of the country shall not be developed for the sole profit of\r\nthe foreigner.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lorini, whom we have just quoted, is of the same opinion. “We\r\nare certainly not of those,” he says, “who complain of the introduction\r\nof foreign capital. The more the latter is imported, the more it gives\r\nemployment, and increases yet more the wealth and welfare of the country.\r\nBut we must also add that as more capital arrives from without, so the\r\npayments which the country has to make for the use of it grow larger,\r\nand for this reason the whole financial policy of the Government and the\r\nArgentine should have as its object the introduction of the severest\r\neconomy and the greatest possible thrift; not only that engagements\r\ncontracted may be honourably met, but that in course of time we may\r\nform a national capital, capable of competing with foreign capital, of\r\nreducing its pretensions, and even of replacing it little by little,\r\nshould the latter, for any reason whatsoever, be compelled to emigrate in\r\nvirtue of causes foreign to the economic laws of the country.”\r\n\r\nAfter England France stands in the first rank of those European nations\r\nwhich have had faith in the future of the Argentine, and have risked the\r\ninvestment of their capital in this young and wealthy state. Unhappily\r\nthe total amount of French capital invested has not been augmented, as\r\none might have hoped, by the political and commercial ties which for many\r\nyears have united the two countries, or by the fertile opportunities\r\nwhich the Republic has to offer to the activity and enterprising spirit\r\nof the Latin races.\r\n\r\nThe _nominal_ total of Argentine securities quoted on the Paris Bourse\r\namounted, on the 31st of December 1907, to the value of £78,999,308,\r\nwhich sum may be analysed as follows:——\r\n\r\n  State funds              £52,332,306\r\n  Banks                     10,335,680\r\n  Transport                 12,802,290\r\n  Mines                        548,978\r\n  Various                    2,980,000\r\n                           -----------\r\n                           £78,999,254\r\n                           ===========\r\n\r\nTo prevent an erroneous interpretation of the above figures, it should\r\nbe stated that this total does not represent the value of the securities\r\nactually held by Frenchmen, but only the securities quoted on the Bourse,\r\nwhich is a very different matter. For example, the French Bank of the Rio\r\nde la Plata figures in this total to the extent of £2,400,000, the amount\r\nof its capital actually subscribed, although scarcely a quarter of it\r\ncirculates in France.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there is a very considerable quantity of Argentine\r\nsecurities belonging to capitalists or investors living in France;\r\nsecurities which are not quoted on the Bourse and are not deposited in\r\nany bank. We may cite as an example the last loan of £10,000,000, issued\r\nunder the title of “Internal Argentine Credit 1909.” Of this amount\r\n£3,400,000 was subscribed in France, yet the bonds of this loan, on\r\naccount of a difference with the French Government, have not yet been\r\nquoted on the Paris Bourse.\r\n\r\nWe are thus justified in concluding that the amount we have given as\r\nrepresenting the value of the stock held by Frenchmen——£78,998,854——is\r\napproximately correct; and that the two factors which affect the matter\r\nin opposite senses may be taken to cancel one another.\r\n\r\nWe must also note the fact that the majority of Government funds find as\r\nlarge a market in London as in Paris. For example, the 4 per cent. loan\r\nof 1897-1900, which was entirely issued in London, was only admitted to\r\nquotation on the Bankers’ Exchange of Paris in 1903.\r\n\r\nIn the banking department, the shares of the Spanish Bank of the Rio de\r\nla Plata and the French Bank of La Plata were only introduced to the\r\nParis Bourse at the beginning of 1908; the principal market for these\r\nshares is still at Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nIn the transport department, the General Company of the Tramways of\r\nBuenos Ayres, which has a capital of £1,800,000, can only be represented\r\nin France by a very small proportion of this capital; the shares have\r\nbeen issued principally in Brussels, London and Berlin.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that French influence in the Argentine has been active\r\nfor a long time and in various ways. It was especially the immigration\r\nof the worthy inhabitants of the French Pyrenees which first set in\r\ntowards the Rio de la Plata, where the Frenchmen invested their energies\r\nin many remunerative departments of labour; some becoming farmers, some\r\ncattle-breeders, some giving themselves to industrial work, some to trade\r\nin the cities; thus contributing to the development of the wealth of the\r\ncountry. The French mercantile marine was also the first to establish and\r\nmaintain a rapid and easy transport between French and Argentine ports,\r\nthus permanently uniting the two countries.\r\n\r\nAs for French commerce, it retained, as lately as 1884, a place in the\r\nfirst rank with regard to the exchange of manufactured articles or the\r\nproducts of the soil, the trade being carried on especially through\r\nthe medium of the Rio da la Plata; indeed there was a time when French\r\ncommerce represented 51 per cent. of the total trade of the Argentine,\r\nwhile now it is responsible for only 20·7 per cent. of the total value of\r\nArgentine imports and exports united.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore consider that the part played by French capital in\r\nArgentine affairs is much too small as compared to the function of\r\nEnglish capital, and we must regret that France is not more deeply\r\ninterested in the great movement towards national prosperity.\r\n\r\nAfter France the European nation which has invested the largest amount\r\nof capital in the Argentine, and which has fully understood the true\r\nimportance of the latter country, is Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the remarkable increase and expansion of her industries Germany has\r\nnot forgotten the shores of the Rio de la Plata. She has entered upon a\r\nstruggle with England; all her electrical and chemical undertakings have\r\ntaken root; factories have sprung up due entirely to German capital; a\r\nGerman Transatlantic Bank has been established in Buenos Ayres; the\r\nHamburg South American Company flies its ensign on the ocean, swiftly\r\ncarrying passengers and merchandise between the two continents; a German\r\nelectrical company has established its power-houses in the Argentine\r\ncapital; an extract of meat company is drawing its profits from the\r\nlive-stock industry; several quebracho mills have been founded; many\r\nother factories have been established, and the Germans have thus absorbed\r\na large proportion of the Argentine export trade.[114] The commercial\r\nrelations between Germany and the Argentine increase each day. Twenty\r\nyears ago the exchanges between the two countries represented hardly 19·4\r\nper cent. of the general foreign trade of the Argentine——at a time when\r\nFrance possessed 51 per cent. instead of her present 20·7 per cent. of\r\nthe trade——while in 1908 the exchanges with Germany amounted to 23·4 per\r\ncent. of the entire trade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: In the course of the year 1908 there left Buenos Ayres,\r\nin the vessels of various lines, 10,805 first-class passengers for\r\nEurope, of whom 2750 left by the _German Company of Hamburg_; 2041 by\r\nthe _Royal Mail Steam Packet Co._; 1193 by the _Messageries Maritimes_;\r\n791 by the _Transports Maritimes à vapeur_; 711 by the _General Italian\r\nNavigation Co._; 688 by _La Véloce_; 588 by the _Italia_; 556 by the\r\n_Lloyd Sabando_; 377 by the _Lloyd Italiano_; 340 by the _Spanish\r\nTransatlantic_; and the rest by vessels of various less important lines.]\r\n\r\nWhat is the total value of the German capital invested in the Argentine\r\nRepublic? It is not easy to say with strict accuracy; but according to\r\nthe very authentic information of certain Buenos Ayres bankers we may\r\nreckon that the German capital employed in the banks, commercial houses,\r\n_estancias_, and industrial concerns, and in the German Electrical\r\nCompany, the electric tramways, etc., etc., amounts to £40,000,000. If\r\nto this capital we add that represented by the vessels under the German\r\nflag, which maintain an active communication with the Rio de la Plata,\r\nobtaining a large proportion of the best clients, the total of the German\r\ncapital employed in the Argentine amounts to some £60,000,000.\r\n\r\nWith these data in hand, and an approximate knowledge of the amount of\r\nforeign capital invested in this country in shares, bonds, and other\r\nsecurities, namely some £384,000,000, as well as its approximate revenue,\r\nwhich in round figures is about £18,000,000, plus £1,600,000 as the\r\ngeneral sinking fund charge, or in all about £19,600,000, we may draw\r\nthe following conclusions:——\r\n\r\nWe know that the revenue of the bonds held by the English capitalists,\r\nincluding the sinking fund, amounts to £14,158,337. Again, the amount\r\nnecessary to pay the interest on the bonds of the National Debt, cedulas,\r\ndebentures, and shares held by French, German, and Belgian investors, may\r\nbe estimated at £3,698,779; so that of the total revenue of £18,493,896\r\nproduced by the Republic, there remains in the country a balance of\r\n£4,287,820.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE BALANCE-SHEET\r\n\r\nNothing is more difficult than to bring together the constituent elements\r\nof a national balance-sheet, on account of the complexity of the\r\nnecessary facts which often escape the net of the statistician. Beginning\r\nwith the most important elements of this balance, and, so it seems, the\r\nmost plainly visible——those formed by the movement of exports and imports\r\nthrough the customs——and ending with the most insignificant facts, there\r\nare still a large number of factors for which it is impossible to allow.\r\n\r\nTaking a broad view of the matter, we must first of all observe that the\r\nestimates by which we finally decide that that which leaves a country,\r\nwhether in merchandise or in specie, is of greater value than that which\r\nenters it, are extremely arbitrary. The principal means of appreciation\r\nis the table drawn up by the Customs Administration upon cargoes leaving\r\nand entering the country, but the results drawn from this table are\r\ninevitably approximate. On the one hand the declarations upon which\r\nthe valuations are based are always untrustworthy, as they are made\r\nby individuals who are interested in diminishing the actual values of\r\ntheir consignments. On the other hand, they are influenced by a thousand\r\nother circumstances which the customs cannot take into account, such as\r\nshipwrecks and unfortunate commercial transactions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, merchandise exported is usually valued by the customs at\r\nthe moment of leaving the port of embarkation; that is, when it has\r\nso far paid only very small sums for carriage and transportation.\r\nImported merchandise, on the other hand, is valued at the time of its\r\ndisembarkation, in the ports of arrival or destination, when it is\r\nalready burdened by all the expenses incident to a long voyage; such as\r\nfreight, insurance, brokerage, etc.\r\n\r\nIt very often follows that in calculating the results of a given\r\ntransaction, and in supposing, moreover, that the estimates are perfectly\r\ncorrect, we often find a perceptible difference between the comparative\r\nfigures of exportation and importation, which must be settled (so it\r\nis often supposed) by a payment of cash, whereas in reality the whole\r\ntransaction consists of a simple exchange of commercial products.[115]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: See _Nouveau Dictionnaire d’Economie Politique_, Article\r\n_Balance du Commerce_, by Georges Michel.]\r\n\r\nBesides these general causes of error in the calculation of the principal\r\nelements of the Argentine balance-sheet, there are others affecting the\r\nArgentine which we might call local, which arise from the manner in which\r\nthe customs estimate the merchandise imported. We have seen that the\r\nCustoms Administration bases the collection of duties upon a valuation\r\ntariff, the exaggerations of which have given rise to the liveliest\r\ncomplaints. As for the statistics of the exports of national produce,\r\nthey are based upon the market prices.\r\n\r\nAs for the foreign capital invested in securities, etc., we know its\r\nvalue within a fair degree of approximation. But it is quite otherwise\r\nwith the large masses of foreign capital employed or invested privately,\r\nwhether in mortgages, commercial enterprises, urban or rural properties,\r\nor in a thousand other directions; we know neither the total amount\r\nnor the interest, nor profits which it produces. These profits are a\r\npermanent cause of uncertainty with respect to the establishment of the\r\nnational balance-sheet.\r\n\r\nApart from these causes already enumerated there is yet one other\r\nwhich deserves to be taken into account; it consists of the sums which\r\nEuropeans who are established or have become enriched in the Argentine\r\nsend each year to their families abroad. We have, unhappily, no means of\r\nestimating the importance of this sum.\r\n\r\nFinally, a cause of inaccuracy which is felt at present as it never has\r\nbeen before, has its rise in the ever-increasing number of natives of the\r\nArgentine who leave their country for Europe, their purses well lined,\r\nand themselves ready to spend their money in superfluities or luxuries,\r\nor in travelling from place to place.\r\n\r\nAccording to the information furnished us by the agents of various\r\nsteamship companies, 10,805 first-class passengers left the Argentine for\r\nEurope in 1908, in search of more or less costly amusement.\r\n\r\nWhat will one of these rich South Americans spend abroad? How far do\r\nthe mass of them contribute to increase the sum which the country pays\r\nout across the ocean every year? It is difficult to guess; but if we\r\nestimate, as we moderately may, that each of them spends about £1000,\r\nwe may add on this count only a sum of £1,080,500 to the debit side of\r\nthe Argentine balance. On the other hand, we have not included among the\r\nyearly liabilities the enormous sums which the country pays each year\r\nin ocean freight charges, because in fixing the sale price of exported\r\nproducts the freight has already been deducted, as well as insurance,\r\nbrokerage, commissions, the cost of wharfage, etc., etc. But to give some\r\nidea of the importance of these sums it is enough to say that, according\r\nto estimates worthy of evidence, the Argentine Republic paid in freight,\r\nin the year 1908, for the transport of some 6 million tons of linseed,\r\nwheat, and maize, at the rate of £1 per ton of grain, a sum of about\r\n£6,500,000.\r\n\r\nThese figures having been considered, we may now establish as follows the\r\nbasis of the economic balance of the Argentine:——\r\n\r\nThe Credit side is formed in the first place by the value of the exports,\r\nwhich in 1908 increased to £73,200,000; then by the great and incessant\r\nconsignments of capital on the part of already existing companies, or new\r\nones which are formed to exploit railways, tramways, or other industrial\r\nundertakings, or to undertake the mortgaging of landed property. An\r\neconomic journal, much valued in Buenos Ayres, the _Buenos-Aires Handels\r\nZeitung_, estimates at £8,000,000 the amount of fresh capital which\r\nenters the country each year. The third class of assets is constituted\r\nby the sums brought into the country by immigrants, which are estimated\r\nat £1,800,000. The total of all these sums amounts to the considerable\r\nfigure of £83,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the Debit side we must first of all place the value of imports, which\r\nin 1908 amounted to £54,600,000, including the large arrivals of railway\r\nand tramway material which the country has not to pay for immediately, as\r\nit obtains them upon long credit; this item is consequently much smaller\r\nin reality than it appears at first sight. Then comes the interest on\r\nthe foreign capital invested in the Argentine Republic in bonds of the\r\nNational Debt, in railway shares, tramway shares, and various other\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the revenue of all these securities issued by or in\r\ndirect relation with the Argentine Republic amounts to £22,000,000,\r\nand that of this sum £4,300,000 remains in the Argentine; we therefore\r\nconclude that £18,000,000 leaves the country each year as remuneration\r\nfor investments.\r\n\r\nThen we have also to enter upon the debit side a total of £84,400,000\r\nwhich “seems to leave the country” each year in payment of the debts\r\ncontracted with foreign countries. But in reality this sum is perceptibly\r\nless, for the reasons we have mentioned above, so that we may reduce it\r\nto £80,000,000.\r\n\r\nNow, if we place side by side the Debit and Credit of the nation’s\r\neconomic balance account, we shall find that in the year 1908 there was a\r\nfavourable balance of not less than £3,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that this favourable balance has in fact been obtained,\r\nnot only in 1908 but also in previous years, for there exist two\r\nirrefragable proofs of the fact: the rates of international exchange,\r\nalways favourable to the Argentine, and the uninterrupted stream of\r\nmetallic currency which flows towards the Rio de la Plata. “The state of\r\nexchange,” as Goschen has said in his work on the subject, “offers us the\r\nmeans of ascertaining not only the state of the commercial atmosphere, by\r\nindicating the proximity of disturbing currents, but it also indicates\r\nthem in such a manner that by interpreting them carefully, we may choose\r\nthe line of conduct to be followed in order to steer clear of danger, and\r\nto avoid the precipitate results of panic.”[116]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: C. I. Goschen, _Theory of Foreign Exchanges_.]\r\n\r\n“The attentive observation of exchanges,” says the economist Foville,\r\nconfirming by these words the assertion of the expert just cited,\r\n“suffices to indicate to the minds of those competent whether the\r\nmonetary stock of a country is in process of increasing, or whether, on\r\nthe contrary, there is an escape of currency towards the outer world.\r\nExchange tells us in which direction bullion is being attracted, at a\r\ngiven moment, just as the weathercock tells us the direction of the\r\nwind.”[117]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: See in the _Bulletin de l’Institut International de\r\nStatistique_, Vol. XV., 1906, p. 200: _Les Eléments de la balance\r\néconomique des peuples_, by A. de Foville.]\r\n\r\nNow if we examine the table showing the international variations of\r\nexchange during the last five years we shall find that the latter are on\r\nthe whole high above par; in December 1906 and January 1907 especially\r\nthey attained considerable figures which have never since been surpassed.\r\n\r\nAs for the importation of bullion and the visible existence of gold\r\nin the country, it will serve our purpose to know that according to\r\nthe official figures there was on the 31st of December 1907 a total\r\nof £29,060,000 in the country, which was distributed as follows:\r\n£21,020,000 in the _Caisse de Conversion_, and £8,040,000 in the various\r\nbanks, including the Conversion Funds. A year later, on the 31st of\r\nDecember 1908, these figures attained a total of £34,860,000, of which\r\n£25,340,000 was in the _Caisse_, and £9,520,000 in the various banks.\r\nBut in the course of the year 1909 this upward movement has been even\r\nmore evident, since the total amount of gold in the Republic on the 1st\r\nof November 1909 was no less than £53,800,000, of which £34,800,000 was\r\nin the _Caisse_ and £19,200,000 in the banks or the Conversion Fund.\r\nIt is already therefore certain, if we are to judge by the important\r\nconsignments of gold actually on the way to the Argentine, that by the\r\nend of 1909 the Republic will possess metallic funds to the amount of at\r\nleast £56,000,000.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what a part foreign capital has taken in realising the\r\neconomic value of the Argentine and the influence it has exerted in\r\ndeveloping the country. It is employed in the greatest variety of ways:\r\nin State loans, railways, and every branch of industry. To it we owe\r\nharbours and railways; that is, the principal factors of economic wealth;\r\nit is foreign capital, invested in navigation companies, which puts the\r\nArgentine in touch with all the nations which consume her products.\r\n\r\nHowever, placing ourselves at the standpoint of the laws of evolution\r\nwhich preside over the destinies of the nations, we must admit that,\r\nin view of the present prosperity of the country, the intervention of\r\nforeign capital in the affairs of the Republic must daily lessen, in\r\nproportion as a national reserve of capital collects; as has happened\r\nin the United States, and in all states which are in the first rank\r\nof civilisation. But the term of this economic movement is still far\r\nremoved, and until the day arrives, foreign capital will in all security\r\ncontinue to find employment in navigation and in public works, and also\r\nin those nascent industries which are beginning to exploit the mineral\r\nwealth of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume does not call for a long summary; for we have, we believe,\r\nin the course of our enquiry, thrown sufficient light upon the\r\ncharacteristic aspects of the situation of the Argentine to enable the\r\nreader to judge of the place it now holds in the world-market among the\r\ngreat producing nations. But what does remain for us to do is to sum up\r\nin broad touches the fundamental progress realised in the last few years;\r\na degree of progress to which the country is indebted for its modern\r\nprosperity, and which bears the seeds of its future development.\r\n\r\nFirstly, to deal with the matter of international politics, we must\r\nremember the solution of the frontier dispute with Chili, which for\r\nmore than fifty years was a cause of alarm as well as of expense, and\r\nwhich had threatened to become embittered to the extent of arresting the\r\nstream of European immigration and European capital so necessary for the\r\nimprovement of the Argentine soil. The example afforded by these two\r\nRepublics of South America, which of their own initiative had recourse to\r\narbitration, rather than finally settle their difference by a resort to\r\narms, and then pledged one another to delete gradually from their budgets\r\nthe unfruitful item of military expenditure, surely indicates that a new\r\nspirit is awake in the Argentine, and that she looks to pursue her future\r\ndestinies along the paths of peace and industry.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of economics the capital fact consists in the enormous\r\nexpansion of the two fundamental industries of the country——agriculture\r\nand stock-raising. To measure the ground covered, it is enough to mention\r\nthat in 1900 the total value of the products of stock-raising was only\r\n£12,200,000, while in 1904 this value had increased to £21,000,000,\r\nand in 1908 to £22,200,000. It has been the same with the products\r\nof agriculture; in nine years their export value has increased from\r\n£14,600,000 to £48,000,000.\r\n\r\nUnder the stimulus of this progress an intense vitality has manifested\r\nitself in every department of national activity; the power of\r\nconsumption of the Argentine, as measured by the statistics of\r\nimportation, has largely increased; property has in many places attained\r\nten times its former value; commercial transactions of every kind have\r\nincreased; and new industries, such, for instance, as the refrigerative\r\nindustry, have been created and are prospering. It is therefore\r\nevident that the dominant characteristic of the present situation of\r\nthe Argentine from the economic point of view must be sought in the\r\nremarkable expansion of all the forces of production.\r\n\r\nThe most eloquent proof of this economic prosperity has just been\r\nfurnished by the late census of agricultural and pastoral enterprises,\r\neffected in 1908 by Señor Martinez. The total value of these\r\nundertakings, representing the better part of the national wealth,\r\nattains, as the table on the following page will show, the figure of\r\n£773,000,000.\r\n\r\nNow, to speak of financial matters, there is a third factor, which came\r\nvery opportunely to consolidate the results of the wonderful expansion we\r\nhave spoken of——the law of monetary conversion. While it was laying the\r\nfoundations of the future conversion of the fiduciary circulation, this\r\nlaw created a reserve fund to make it presently practicable, and so gave\r\nstability to the instrument of exchanges; suppressing the gold premium,\r\nso prejudicial to business, and supporting the prosperity of the country\r\nby a fixed and common-sense currency; a support which the country needed\r\nin order that it might develop without checks and shocks, but one it had\r\nhitherto lacked. No measure has contributed more than this to the relief\r\nand improvement of Argentine credit, and to the increased value of the\r\npublic funds, which will before long result in the work of financial\r\nreorganisation.\r\n\r\nThe results of this happy conjunction of political, economic, and\r\nfinancial facts were not long to seek; for in less than five years the\r\nArgentine passed from a state of chronic crisis to the fullest prosperity\r\nknown since her existence as a nation. But to preserve all the benefits\r\nof the progress accomplished the young Republic has still one task to\r\nfulfil: to fortify domestic peace, to perfect her political system, and\r\nto improve her principles of administration; conditions indispensable\r\nto the assured and normal development of the country and its future\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\n     _The Total Value of the Agricultural and Pastoral Farms\r\n               and Estates of the Argentine Republic_[118]\r\n         _(According to the Agricultural Census of May 1908)._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: The details are in round figures, the totals official.]\r\n\r\n  -------------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               | Length of  |                  VALUES IN POUNDS STERLING.\r\n  PROVINCES AND| Iron Wire  |------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n   TERRITORIES | Fencing    |            |            |            |  Machines  |\r\n               |(in Miles). |   Soil.    |  Animals.  |Fixed Plant.| and Tools. |Total Value.\r\n  -------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n  Buenos Ayres |  224,500   |£326,314,000| £65,803,000|£22,599,000 | £7,317,000 |£422,033,000\r\n  Santa Fé     |   68,800   |  92,986,000|  11,714,000|  6,134,000 |  3,182,000 | 114,016,000\r\n  Entre Rios   |   49,600   |  24,483,000|  10,550,000|  3,686,000 |  1,179,000 |  39,898,000\r\n  Corrientès   |   40,600   |   3,190,000|   7,950,000|  1,513,000 |    230,300 |  12,883,300\r\n  Córdoba      |   73,800   |  38,306,000|  10,128,000|  5,934,000 |  2,419,000 |  57,837,000\r\n  San Luis     |   14,000   |   6,047,000|   2,119,700|  1,270,000 |    202,000 |   9,638,900\r\n  Santiago     |    5,560   |   4,472,000|   2,128,000|    891,000 |    144,000 |   7,635,000\r\n  Tucuman      |    9,480   |   4,457,000|   1,501,000|  2,115,000 |    192,000 |  13,265,000\r\n  Mendoza      |    5,100   |  40,045,000|   1,257,000|  2,352,000 |    230,000 |  43,844,000\r\n  San Juan     |    3,160   |   3,462,000|     411,000|  1,602,000 |    126,000 |   5,601,000\r\n  La Rioja     |      716   |   3,170,000|   1,061,000|    809,000 |     36,190 |   5,076,190\r\n  Catamarca    |    1,830   |   3,223,000|     795,000|  1,348,000 |     26,000 |   5,392,000\r\n  Salta        |    3,600   |   3,024,000|   1,756,000|    762,000 |     78,650 |   5,620,650\r\n  Jujuy        |    1,460   |     200,000|     577,000|    241,800 |     19,600 |   1,038,400\r\n  Chaco        |    1,680   |     726,000|     669,000|    155,700 |     37,800 |   1,388,500\r\n  Chubut       |    2,260   |     656,000|   1,642,000|    334,000 |     61,070 |   2,643,070\r\n  Formosa      |      360   |     351,000|     556,000|    134,000 |     15,000 |   1,056,000\r\n  La Pampa     |  113,430   |  10,908,000|   3,693,000|  1,382,000 |    542,000 |  17,525,000\r\n  Los Andes    |      211   |        ——  |      36,900|     35,200 |       ——   |      71,900\r\n  Misionès     |    2,240   |     635,000|     216,000|    233,000 |     22,800 |   1,106,800\r\n  Neuquen      |      398   |     819,000|     887,000|    189,000 |     35,490 |   1,930,490\r\n  Rio Negro    |   10,520   |   2,739,000|   2,440,000|    863,000 |    168,000 |   6,210,000\r\n  Santa Cruz   |    6,560   |   1,003,000|     890,000|    598,000 |     32,600 |   2,523,600\r\n  Tierra del   |            |            |            |            |            |\r\n    Fuego      |    2,700   |     125,000|     460,000|    269,000 |     21,700 |     875,700\r\n               |------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n               |  642,065   |£571,563,430|£130,179,700|£55,477,500 |£16,321,270 |£773,541,930\r\n               +============+============+============+============+============+============\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF ARGENTINA AND ADJOINING STATES.
